The fleeting moment of concern though made John surface from the waves of lust, at least enough to regain some of his senses.
However, judging by the cacophony of wanton noises coming from the speaker, 'forever' wasn't an option and, oh, wasn't John grateful for that!
One corner of his mouth pulled up into an impish smirk, John murmured the next lines; his voice gone low and a bit rough and like a Pavlovian reaction Sherlock's heartbeat sped up a notch.
“You arse.” John snorted. To detect the sudden boyish glee in Sherlock’s eyes was such a relief. Where had it been all the time? At least it wasn’t gone, it had only been hiding.
Sherlock couldn't hear him yet. No use to say it all out loud. John hoped that he was thinking loud enough, that Sherlock would understand anyway. That Sherlock would know.
“Yep, as did you before you shaved yours off.” The glare he gave Sherlock was only half real as he loved Sherlock’s smooth skin just as much.
Yes. It had been. To be so close but Sherlock being so far away. To be unsure about staying, but reluctant to leave. To be worried and at the same time relieved.
John, selective or dissociative amnesia, confirmed loss of memory: doctor skills, acquaintances primary source of social integrity, Sherlock being the one contacted, support interests, answer questions,  foster his self reliance.
He slipped into the back of the car waiting for him. The moment he closed the door, the vehicle took off and merged into the London traffic. He reclined his elbow against the smooth leather lined interior of the car door and pressed his fingers, clenched into a fist, against his mouth. He looked out of the side window without seeing anything. He could feel Mycroft watching him from the seat next to him, but he had no desire to reciprocate. Not that he would ever admit it out loud, but he was in fact grateful for Mycroft's presence. For his silent company, provided without request, uncommented, unquestioned.
Well then, there was nothing to it. He had tried to be gentle. He really had. If John didn't respond to a careful approach, maybe he had to change tactics.
“Yes. No. Everything’s …fine. Yeah, fine.” John nodded frantically, more to convince himself than his friend. “As I said, collect something. Hope Molly’s still in,” John mused, already changing direction to make his way to St. Barts hospital.
“Okay, so, when you—what it felt like—,” Sherlock said pointedly, “called me a prostitute, I think I just snapped. In my past, during the time I was more active in the scene, it was the one thing that was always mistaken. Not only by the kind of people you’ve had the pleasure to deal with,” Sherlock smirked and John winced at the thought of all the offers he had declined with all his might. “But…” Sherlock paused, seemingly lost in memories of that time. “But also by my family—you’ve heard the undertones when Mycroft mentioned Uncle Rudy? Now imagine that exaggerated to not just undertones directed at me until his minions confirmed what I’ve told him multiple times already. Namely, that there wasn’t any additional threat to my sanity, let alone one that included some kind of emotion towards
"If I was making fun of you," he said much more calmly, without any hint of teasing, "I'd never ask you to come home and do exactly that."
“You’ll shorten my hair to a convenient length to wax it afterwards. My research narrowed down to a length of 1,4 to 2 centimetre to get the most effective epilation. So, please, be precise to avoid unnecessary repeats.” he said and pushed it in John’s unsuspecting hands.
"Of course not, John, considering I've not been out of bed yet. You're behaving even more absurd than usual this morning." Sherlock started to roll away from John, but John only pulled him closer, hugging him tight.
Relieved, John grabbed his phone and battery pack, tried to slip into his shoes while at the same time reaching for his jacket, nearly tumbling to the floor. He cursed and finally rushed down the stairs, not even bothering to tie his shoelaces, his shirt only half buttoned up and still partly hanging out of the seam of his trousers. While fumbling with his shirt buttons, he threw open the front door with the intention to stop the first cab he’d run across, only now realising that he had no idea where to go to, because Sherlock was long gone and out of sight.
"Shhhh…" John soothed him, caressing his face, dotting his face with tiny pecks like he had done earlier this day for the same reason
“Obviously.” Sherlock, apparently oblivious to the state John was in or possibly exactly the opposite, held him by his shoulders and animatedly informed a flustered John about his absolutely totally without second thoughts plans; that wicked tease of a man.
Sherlock felt how anger boiled up in him and replaced annoyance and exhaustion. Didn’t John understand anything? Didn’t he see? All the sacrifices Sherlock was making for him, for John? How difficult it was for Sherlock to hold John at arm's length? How much it took him to protect John, to endure the fear that he might fail? Again!
“Why?” Sherlock almost yelled. “Why, John? Can’t you see that this wouldn’t work? Why hang on to something that isn’t good for either of us? Believe me, John. It might not look like it right now, but we’re better off without each other.” Without another word he turned and without hesitation he made his way towards the exit.
"Sherlock, stop that. Just… stop it. Why are you this evasive? Why are you backing off each time I think we're taking one step forward? What are you afraid of?"
And with that it clicked in John's Pirate-muddled brain—this wasn't about John defending Sherlock. This was about Miss Pirate and her… pimp—John still felt sick at the thought alone—penetrating the scene.
Mycroft whirled around without losing an inch of his grandeur and raised his chin. "No, Sherlock, you stop it."
So he had to make use of the only other method on hand - quite literally. He grabbed his phone and hammered his fingertips rapidly against the screen.
Finally, he stood in front of the door. He knocked, not wanting to interrupt the playing by the door bell. Somehow he was certain, that he would be heard anyway. He didn't have to wait long before, true to his expectation, the front door opened. Mrs Hudson let him in, atypically quiet. She didn't say anything, so neither did he, but the way she beamed at him said more than a million words. The joy, the hope, the motherly love, the warm welcome in her eyes
Without being aware how he got there John entered the dance floor and immediately gained appreciating and inviting gazes, very not-subtle touches of his behind and women worthy of staring in the next pornhub blockbuster dancing in his way. He showed them all aside like a mole digging his way through the soil, sole focus on the dazzling creature bewitching her dance partner and actually everyone in her atmosphere; all of them slowly gravitating towards her like planets circling the sun.
"Awww, that’s my girl," Mrs Hudson cooed. "I taught you well, sweetheart. Make me proud!” She made an attempt to pad Sherlock's cheek but he flinched away and bolted for the door.
“That’s… true! That’s… amazing! What…? How…?” John frowned, looked around as if expecting to be spied on. Who knew though…
One morning after a - in more than one way - rough night, John woke to being bathed in sunlight. He relished the moment of warmth and contentment until he felt the octopus  holding him captive stir. He wiggled and turned in his arms to watch the love of his life wake. One of his favourite things.
Mrs Hudson had shaken her head and had donned her dragon persona. She had sat on her chair across the table and had looked sorrowful at Sherlock.
“Come on!” John’s hand found the bulge in his own pants and the jolt of pleasure soaring from his groin made him moan deeply. “Be my eyes!” He was almost begging at this point. “What am I seeing?” He was relieved to hear an equally needy groan from the other end of the line.
That was probably the reason why John was lost lately. Yes, he was happy to be back. Yes, he never regretted his decision concerning Mary. Even if Sherlock had been hesitant about it at first, downright angry actually when they had talked about it for the first time. However, eventually even Sherlock had calmed down.
And here he was, holding his phone in his slightly trembling hand and trying to calm down his respiration rate. Because having amnesia and needing help is a totally different matter than to have given up hope on fixing the conflicts you have with your… your… friend? Flatmate? Colleague?
John had the unsettling feeling of being dismissed, discussion closed. He felt dread creeping in on him from the shadows, caging him in, threatening to suffocate him. Was this it? Had this been
Now however he made his way downstairs into the comfortable cosiness of Greg's boat. He longed for a drink in his hand, plush sofa cushions underneath his butt and some encouraging words out of the mouth of one of the most reasonable people he'd ever met. Even if it would turn out to be a proper scolding, Greg always knew how to find the exact words John seemed to need. He was grateful for Greg's friendship. He had never expected it to get this deep. Greg had always been more Sherlock's friend. But apparently, John had put himself in Sherlock's shadow once again.
He was standing right behind Sherlock now. He could feel the air between them waft, like standing next to a fire, too close yet not close enough. Sparks flying into the air, holding the thrill of danger yet being the most beautiful thing glowing against the dark night sky.
Sherlock however noticed the hand placed between them, palm up, inviting. Sherlock smiled; John Watson
John watched Sherlock's experiment equipment with hawk eyes, which annoyed Sherlock beyond all measure. That's why John had to come up with the most absurd ideas to distract and to please him, after the standards like movie nights or board games had lost their appeal. Sherlock loved playing Twister though, if only to laugh at John's disadvantage of short limbs. Sometimes the inevitable tangling and collapsing resulted in other very pleasant activities, but even that wasn't an all day and every day option.
You can’t imagine my delight when I stumbled over this by accident during my (insanely excessive) research for abandoned buildings in the London area for Sherlock to dance in. One of the ridiculously-happy-research-moments for this fic. I really think I deserve them as compensation for the horribly-frustrated-screaming-moods the idiot boys put me through while writing this fic. They really don’t listen to me. I swear!! Not. My. Fault. All complaints can be sent to the Consulting Husbands, 221B Baker Street, London.
“As I said before, if you paid attention, it would be preferable, if the situation wouldn’t be reversed in any sort of way… so what I actually want to express is, don’t move out, but
"Right you are, love. The only queen I love and care for." He pressed a kiss on top of Sherlock's head. And was rewarded with a sticky layer of… something… on his lips.
John heard the heartbeat again. This time aware of the slight shift in Sherlock’s motions. The little adjustments to match the beat, to match John’s heartbeat. John’s heartbeat attuning to Sherlock’s rhythm. The two of them in sync.
The lyrics kept whirling in his mind, but now he was able to observe them from afar. The words appeared on paper snippets hovering in front of his eyes, as if they only waited to be picked out of the air to be analyzed.
Additionally, wasn't it quite a hilarious coincidence that on top of everything even the music seemed to play tricks on him. Everything and everyone seemed to conspire against him. Of course he knew the song John was playing upstairs! After all, it was from the same album as the song Sherlock had danced to not mere hours ago. Even if his brother kept insisting that the universe was rarely so lazy; this was definitely proving him wrong! At least one satisfying thing about this situation.
“You’re a ridiculous man,” Scott huffed, not succeeding in hiding how flattered he was. John was very proud of himself.
Slowly he came to a halt. Arms raised, relaxed. He bent his knees as if to underline the stability and strength of his stand and he'd like to think of his emotions, too. Tentatively, Sherlock started swaying his pelvis. Trying out his equilibrium. Provoking his body. Challenging it to show any weakness. Any struggle. With growing confidence he became more and more daring until his hips snapped almost obscenely wider and wider, from side to side.
“Sherlock…” John croaked and cleared his throat, but was interrupted by Sherlock yelping and jumping because of his phone buzzing underneath his bum.
The same moment two more men entered the room and joined the gorillas on stage. John stopped in his snail tracks not to give himself away. He swallowed. Fuck, this didn’t make things any easier. Yeah, but… when had things ever been easy regarding a certain dickhead detective who loved to get himself in trouble?
His mouth went dry when she slowly caressed her hips to reach behind and cup her butt on top of her skirt. Leaning slightly forwards and sliding her palms across the round curve of her buttocks she made her skirt shift the slightest bit revealing the hint of a tiny lace panty covering well rounded plush arse cheeks.
"However," the man rubbed his chin in mock contemplation, "I wonder how the news would be received that she's about to leave the country…"
So, he focused on the purity of his movements, on the clarity of the techniques. Pique, arabesque, chassé, soutenue… this was stable, this was reliable, this always remained the same. He had learned it all, had punished his body. Enduring the pain this drill involved had once been the only drug he needed. Oblivion, shift of the focus… this was what he wanted to achieve here! There, that was a place to go in his memories. Punishment for inaccuracy, that was something he could accept, something he could stand, something he embraced.
But wasn’t that extremely selfish? Keep John close for his own sake? How could he ask this of John? When John so clearly understood it as his duty only?
The rest of the trip passed in silence until they turned onto the private driveway to Mycroft's mansion. When the driver stopped in front of the entrance, Mycroft cleared his throat and unfastened his seatbelt.
The moment John inhaled deeply to gather all the bravery he could muster, Sherlock stopped fiddling, raised his head and, while still moving, tossed the object in his hands carelessly aside into the dust. Almost immediately the room was
"How quick is 'quick', Holmes?" John growled next to Sherlock's ear, voice low, lips brushing the shell.
“No, of course, you’re right… sorry.” John said silently. He turned back to his former sitting position, away from Sherlock, facing ahead, not having to look at each other. An emotional gap of the size of the Grand Canyon between them. They stayed silent for a moment, and when they broke it, they spoke at the same time.
Sherlock fidgeted, was restless just standing around, he needed to move, to distract himself, to evade the intensity of John's undivided attention. So he started walking again and pulled John along.
The noises of contented pleasure Scott made didn’t help one bit to keep John’s own over-eager body parts in check. He palmed himself through his trousers and gave his erection a firm squeeze, actually to take off the edge but unfortunately it rather had the opposite effect. His impatience spiraled to the level of a kid waiting to unwrap its presents on Christmas Day. He decided, enough was enough — there'd be no coming from nipple tweaking alone.
John had always been his people-translator. Sherlock wasn't any good at this without John! But he could hardly ask John to deduce himself! What good would that do? Normally, John was very down-to-earth and a realistic and honest person, but not so very much honest about himself!
Sherlock threw himself into his dance and John, released from the intensity of Sherlock’s eyes, took a shuddering breath. He watched Sherlock variating between turns and leaps and miraculously sliding over the dust covered floor. It was a quick shift between fast and slow, bold and small, confident and contained. It looked torn, it looked indecisive. Sherlock’s face expressed it all at once and John wondered how that was even possible.
But then, Greg knew all about it, about his misery, about Sherlock, about it being… more. Weren't even Greg's bloody words the initial spark that fanned the flames?
But John silenced him with a kiss and only hummed a melody he thought might be familiar even to Sherlock against his pliant lips.
“Let’s leave all that behind! Let’s start over again. Back to the beginning, yes? Give us this chance! Give me the chance to prove to you, that this is worth it!” He felt moisture wetting his neck, the sobs now unrestrained but quiet. Sherlock’s shoulders shaking.
Arriving at the Diogenes Club Sherlock directly made his way to Mycroft’s office, rushing down the stairs two steps at a time in such a hurry that it earned him many distasteful looks from the muted gentlemen populating the posh building.
Shifting his feet, doing a half turn Sherlock found it easier to breathe. As if to face away. From what? From his problems, from John, from the temptation to hold on to what is inevitably lost? He knew that facing away only meant that the threat lingered behind your back, that danger was there to take you by surprise. He didn't care. At least he didn't have to watch and witness. Ignorance is bliss. Well, what is wrong with bliss?
He knew when he wasn’t wanted and he wouldn’t let himself be humiliated by Sherlock needing to tell him to leave. He would be ahead of Sherlock. At least this once. Sherlock wouldn’t have to endure him any longer, not one second longer than absolutely necessary.
Sherlock had felt a pang in his heart. ‘Moved out’ was like ‘broken up’, wasn’t it? It was permanent and definite. Sherlock knew what ‘broken up’ meant. He had texted John once, for a case, to ask. John had been very clear in his answer. Mostly ‘to move out’ meant ‘to break up’ with someone. Although, of course there had never been anything to 'break up' in the first place. So why mourn the 'break up' of something that had never had the chance to be 'broken up' and never will get that chance. But then, John had signaled his interest to stay in contact with Sherlock… in which ever way. Sherlock still couldn’t wrap his head around it. Sherlock was confused like seldom before. John had moved out which didn't mean a break up in this case as there had been nothing to break up, but now John wanted to have such a thing and wanted to be with Sherlock? Just maybe, not as flatmates? Nothing of that made sense, Sherlock's mind reeled and made him nauseous. Didn’t John consider Baker Street as his home anymore. Did he already have a different living arrangement?
Suddenly the wrecked person from just a moment ago  had been replaced by a creature of strength, of capability, of grace, of beauty…
When they broke apart, the sight of Sherlock in his full attire, only lacking the heels, fully sank into John's consciousness for the first time; the body Miss Pirate, the face still his detective it suddenly made the metamorphosis, the fusion much more tangible.
“That one time, when you asked for someone to shatter you, to make you feel alive?” John swallowed and Sherlock felt all the dread from that moment raise again. But John looked intensely at him, as if to pull him back from where he was retreating to. “I kept wondering why it wasn't me. Why couldn't I be the one? What was I lacking… I couldn't figure it out. I wanted it so desperately to be me.”
“Exactly, John. We have to do some shopping at the pharmacy tomorrow. And afterwards, you will have the honour of helping me.”
It is not my intention to downplay the severity of this condition by using characteristics for it in this chapter. I rather took some creative license with the song, as Sherlock identifies his current feelings with the syndrome. He's just not sure yet, who is the captor and who's the hostage. That in itself should make him wonder, but he's beyond logical reasoning at this point...
Finally, time for dinner had come and he walked over to Mycroft's dining room. His brother wasn't present yet so he sat alone at the table and tried to get used to it. Sitting alone. Somewhere, which was not home. If he tried not to care, it would be fine, he decided. He let his gaze roam across the elegantly laid table. Unbidden, the contrast to a couch table overflowing with take-away containers imposed on his mind. The sudden sickness and twisting stomach hit him by surprise. He clenched his jaw, averted his eyes to force the unwanted thoughts away. This was the moment Mycroft chose to join him. Quickly, Sherlock tried to regain composure and lifted himself slightly from the chair in a welcoming gesture. Not that he exactly felt like it, most of all the welcoming part, but he knew it would please his brother who then therefore would probably be much more apt to cooperate.
John’s eyes widened, he felt a lump form in his throat. It couldn’t be… could it? But Sherlock had said… John had thought… it didn’t make sense. Why would Sherlock think…
made for my story! I'm still completely blown away that she spent her precious time and wonderful talent to draw this beauty for me!! Thank you again, darling 💕
“Okay, genius. Here’s the deal. No shaving foam until you go to the shops - in person, no underground network or bribing Mycroft’s minions.” John said, calm and determined.
The door to the “strictly girls’ area” opened and a, by now, well known and disliked mob of bright red hair emerged.
To be honest, which John tried very much not to be on this topic, it hadn't even been his first Sherlock themed wank. He had always known that he'd found Sherlock attractive, that in the early days he hadn't been averse to deepen their friendship into something more, that his mind had more than once pondered and wondered about Sherlock's sex life…
John was always complaining about Sherlock's sleep schedules and now he was doing exactly the same. Why now suddenly in such an immensely important moment. How very inconvenient. Sherlock had to understand! He had to know! He hated not knowing!
"Uhm… alright then. Okay, yes.. yes. Okay. Noted." John cleared his throat. Sherlock heard him inhale sharply. Bracing himself? Trying to be strong? Disappointed? Of course he was disappointed! Sherlock had hurt him. Again. That was the
John poured the freshly brewed coffee and added milk and sugar to their liking. He brought the cups over to the table, handed Sherlock his, who held it in one hand while the other nervously fumbled with the edges of the newspaper lying on the table. John sat down again, looking expectantly at Sherlock, who intensely watched the paper getting crumpled and torn.
Now however, he linked his phone to the speaker, searched for the song he had in mind since he decided to come here today. He knew enough songs to find a fitting one for every mood and every problem to solve. Today though, he had to get out all the guilt, all the sadness, all the confusion.
He looked at them for a while, considered, plunged forward to pick some of them before they would float away and examined them thoroughly. He tried to deduce the meaning behind the words, but he had never been good at that. Sentiment. All of it.
Only after cleaning up and getting ready for the night, already lying on his bed and slowly dozing off, he startled from his slumber with a jolt. How long had they even been talking? Fumbling for his phone, he picked it up from the night table and checked the outgoing calls — Fuck. That would cost him a fortune!
The tea alone wouldn't be so frightening. They were Brits after all. It was always tea-time. And tea was the solution to everything. But… Mycroft? Three-piece-suit-Mycroft? Someone-hand-me-the-paper-to-wipe-my-arse-Mycroft? Standing in his own kitchen, no staff to be seen, suit jacket shed, preparing
Finally able to peer around the corner of the doorway, John's breath hitched and his throat burned in the attempt to keep his breathing quiet.
Okay, not aware after all then. John didn’t wait for an answer from his “mate” and soldiered on to conquer the stairs. The bedroom door banged shut, the bedsprings creaked, the flat was silent.
His head fell forwards shaking no without him knowing what he was refusing, declining, ignoring, denying. The strands caressing his forehead, but instead of a soft tickle it felt like pinpricks causing a headache, an ache stretching along his jaw making his neck feel stiff and his brains numb.
“There was this one guy though,” Sherlock thoughtfully went on afterwards, “only one of them who always slipped out of my grasp. And he was the worst of them all. What he did to some of the workers and dancers that had displeased him or refused to work for him… John, I’ve seen a lot and I can bear even more, but…” Sherlock shuddered. “And I knew he was obsessed with me. I suspect, mostly because I resisted every attempt to subdue to anyone. It was a sick game for him, something personal, like a challenge. And I swore to never let him get me and to hand him over as soon as possible. He kept a low profile since I decided to retreat from the scene, when I met you,” Sherlock shrugged a bit… embarrassed? “I thought I could let it go and he… actually I don’t know what he thought and I also didn’t care. I had no desire to cross his path again now you were in the picture.” He tightened his grip on John’s hand. “Then this case came up. Even though he never showed his face, he left clues; unfortunately never enough to convince anyone who didn’t know about our history. However, when you mentioned the Spider and I knew he had approached you, I couldn’t just stand by and watch you be put in danger. Even more so by my own doing. I had to get to him. Alone. Just me and him—like the good old times.” Sherlock huffed out dismissively. Disgusted.
His desk being cluttered with take away containers — it turned out a hot threesome was also nice in food-terms — John leaned back, sipping the umpteenth glass of the bottle of red wine he had found somewhere in his stack, the one he wasn’t completely sure if it wasn’t a leftover from the previous tenant. However, it had only one job and it did it justice — make him feel all warm and fuzzy and slow down his brain enough not to think about… things… he didn’t want to think about. The perfect state to go to bed, he decided. Foregoing putting on useless things as pyjamas or pants, John crawled under his blankets. Fuzzy and warm. Warm and fuzzy. Yeah, he could work with that…
He just hoped everyone else was as captured by this performance as he himself and didn’t notice his state.
He entered the flat and threw Sherlock’s dressing gown which he had picked up from the stairs on top of his jacket which was still dumped on the sofa. Automatically, his feet carried him into the kitchen to the spot they'd last been in before they had left; as if it would help him to understand. The gruesome thought that he had done the same with the pavement outside Barts suddenly occurred unasked and he forcefully shook his head to get rid of the disturbing memories. Why did they keep invading his thoughts, even now, when he was the happiest he had ever been in his life?
. He had even called him. So John remembered him. Trusted him in some way. That had to mean something, right?
John was tired of worrying about Sherlock. It was eating him up to sit at home and to wonder if Sherlock was alright, if he would come back, if anything had happened. He had the feeling he should be at his side, have his back, but wasn’t allowed to do so. He was tired of being left in the dark.
Sherlock opened his eyes, suddenly very much aware of his surroundings. He straightened his spine, sat up so quickly that he got dizzy for a moment and clenched his phone in his fist.
"Most definitely!" John giggled. This guy was completely bonkers. He had never spoken to anyone even remotely as funny as this madman.
He had brought the disc with him to Baker Street, left it behind for the unlikely case that he might show up… against all expectations. Maybe, if Sherlock didn’t want to get in contact with John, he would still take the disc, would still listen to what John had to say. And if not, John had at least tried, What else was left? However, until now there had been no reaction.
But John only reached up to pick just another posh something which Sherlock used to wash his hair with. He showed a bit at Sherlock and carefully guided him down to wet his hair. His partner's eyes closed, fully trusting him to hold him. John scooped the water up in his hands and let it carefully run over Sherlock's hair. When it was all soaked through, he pulled Sherlock back up to cuddle against him so he could spread the shampoo in the wet strands.
Out of breath, short pause, chest heaving, heart racing. No not ready, still able to feel, still able to think, still able to stand on his feet.
John said it as a matter of fact, Sherlock didn't know how to respond. So he kept quiet and wondered if that was what John actually wanted to say.
After a few clicks he had John’s laptop unlocked and started searching his web history. Quickly he found the social media platform John had referred to—tumblr. ‘Of course John would have to choose a site named related to his favourite drink’, Sherlock thought. If it was a community of whiskey lovers and secret drinkers? Sherlock was intrigued.
"Well, that's not exactly an appropriate standard for comparison to calm my mind, now is it?" he huffed.
Sherlock didn’t look up as John caught up and settled close next to Sherlock, grimly poking with his little plastic fork at the pieces of sausage. He ate hastily, propping the sausage with sauce into his mouth, accidentally smearing some of it across his lips and onto his chin without noticing, as he witnessed Sherlock staring into his cup out of the corner of his eye. John looked down into his cup and took in the sausage, the sauce, the bread…. Well it surely wasn’t a posh meal, but it wasn’t exactly roasted intestines either. Now he thought about it, Sherlock probably wouldn’t be disgusted by that either… But the way he saw it, there was nothing to be that dumbstruck as Sherlock now obviously was staring at his food.
Sherlock’s eyes went wide. Mycroft still avoided his gaze, leaning against the counter, watching his own feet.
At those words John felt a knot in his stomach uncoil, a quiver, which he didn't really trust. He didn't want it to be hope in case Mycroft was about to reveal disappointing news. He didn't want it to be dread, because he didn't want to lose hope. Although there was one thing he was certain of. Mycroft would only come all the way to the pier, and apparently on one of his less official days judging by his attire, if it was important. The only important thing between Mycroft and him though was Sherlock.
To see Sherlock this happy and unrestrained after all those challenging and straining last weeks, most of all after the night before, filled John with hope that they had survived this storm without too much damage and with the confidence that they'd manage to sail any troubled waters ahead of them. They'd start over new without ever forgetting their wonderful whirlwind beginning.
It seemed as if he didn’t know the man he had seen in there at all. How had Sherlock been able to hide something like this? Why had he hidden it in the first place? Why hadn’t he told John?
A big "thank you" to everyone who is still around! Thank you all for your patience while I was "having fun" taking a ride on the rollercoaster called Real Life.
John chuckled and resigned to his fate of trying to nourish them the upcoming two weeks by tinned food alone.
"But then, tonight, all I saw and thought of was you. My body might have been with that disgraceful man called Moran. But my mind wasn't. It could never have been, John." Sherlock said seriously and studied John's face.
He tried three more times, but each time he only got as far as the voicemail. It was apparent by then that Sherlock wouldn't pick up the phone. At least he would see that John had called. That he had tried.
is what you want to know?” His disbelief undisguised and plain to see on his features. When John didn’t say anything, because he couldn’t, Sherlock straightened and squared his shoulders.
Actually though, both pics above are not quite realistic for the period Sherlock uses the site, because the walls are already demolished.
Sherlock did get quite eager to spend more time in bed though. John did not object, happy to prove the previously mentioned effect of the famous Watson-beard… or rather MacKelpie-beard that is. When he saw Sherlock shifting on the kitchen chairs, yelping when he got in the tub to take a bath and smearing extra-skin-soothing creme not only on his face, he was very happy to have come up with the punishment following the misuse of shaving foam. Not that he himself enjoyed it any less, but Sherlock was much more self-conscious about his stubble.
,” Sherlock closed his eyes and tilted his head back in obvious pleasure. His hands were now running up and down John’s back as well, crisscrossing their path as if indecisive between aming for hugging him closer or exploring more of him.
John breathed out harshly, took a few wobbly steps to flop himself down in his chair. Watching Sherlock standing there, hands on his hips, tall and proud and beautiful, his throat constricted at the thought of how many times and in how many different ways he could have lost the love of his life this night.
"When we met, all that time ago, at the club… I asked you if you were a drag queen but you denied it." John waited for Sherlock to catch up to that memory.
“You know what it does to me,” he chuckled. “From our first crime scene on. No-one except you has ever made me enjoy myself that much, made me happy. I still don’t know what I’m even doing there apart from conducting light,” he smirked, only slightly as if he just made an inside joke with himself, “but I keep traipsing along like a puppy only to watch you.” Sherlock tried to hide the involuntarily growing fond smile spreading on his face.
“John,” he couldn’t quite get it out. He felt lightheaded, his voice was failing him. But John spoke before he could start to panic, as if to stop him.
Being in a sentimental and disillusioned mood he stood from the crouch and stalked over to their little stereo equipment, which has rarely been used in all the time he had lived here. They hadn’t needed it, either because Sherlock had been playing his violin or Sherlock had been sulking and banning any noise from the flat or Sherlock had been working and not wanting to be distracted. John huffed, only now aware that he hadn’t had any word in those decisions either. What had been his influence in this life of theirs at all?
John, realising what he had said, fumbled in his mind for some kind of graceful way out of this dead end. He had shown his cards pretty clearly there, hadn’t he? Damn…
“And then,” John said with a thick tear-drained voice, “there was you. And you were everything I was always searching for. You didn’t need to kill people to live in a warzone. You didn’t have to fix every criminal’s life to be able to save those in need. And most of all, you didn’t want to please anyone. You didn’t want to fit in, you were just you.” The tears were falling freely now. “And you were amazing. Not a fucking hypocrite, like I was.”
One time Miss Pirate was even hanging upside down, inevitably the skirt was victim to gravity and displayed—to John’s horror—the complete perfectness of flesh and skin and lace and straps and belt and panties… and a Jolly Roger conveniently draped over one particularly private part. John smirked at the wickedness of his partner—he was certain that all the men in the audience were cursing that darn flag whereas John was thinking about a proper way to honour it. Maybe it would look nice as a blindfold…
When he came back to himself he tasted Sherlock's semen on his tongue, felt some of it stick at the corner of his mouth. The man himself was plopped down on the mattress next to him, the way he had been, still upside down; both of them out of breath, chests heaving of heavy breathing.
Aargghh… How? How was it possible that one short call last night had given him wanking material for the unforeseeable future? To be honest… John knew exactly how. That voice. That! Voice! John wasn’t a greedy man — he’d already be satisfied with that voice alone. Or by that voice…? Whatever… He’d buy it canned in a tin if that’d be possible. Although, admittedly, he wouldn’t complain if the lips that were forming those ridiculous words were to be part of the package as well. It must be a sensual mouth belonging to that voice, mustn’t it? Oh well, better not think about it while taking a shower to get laid by someone being Not The Voice…
John would sit at home, waiting for Sherlock to come back, and wondering what the hell was going on.
“Sorry, I’ll stop.” God, embarrassing this. He really needed to get a grip. He was fangirling… uhm, boying rather… over a voice on the phone. How pathetic.
“Oh Sherlock,” he said, voice choked. “Don’t be afraid, love, don’t be scared. Nobody can get to us, when we're together! We’re strong. You’re strong, so strong.”
He registered the lyrics, had listened to them closely. He knew exactly what this was about, for he had felt exactly the same way. It had been one look and his world had changed. He hadn’t yet known the magnitude of that moment, but he had felt something shift irrevocably.
Why didn't John make any sense? Well, he often didn't, but not when it was about his special skills. He always made sense as a soldier, as a doctor, as a conductor of light, as a… friend.
But why would John be that sad? The song… it has been about loss, about memories, about being alone… But… John wasn’t alone, was he? At least not in his home as was claimed in the song. Well, Sherlock was not exactly the kind of person whose company was desirable, but he was there… sometimes.
“You already did, didn’t you?” Sherlock spat. There was a sharpness in it that John hadn’t expected. Sherlock glared at him now.
As treacherous as his brain was these days, he didn’t succeed. The fingertips of his outstretched hand traced patterns on the cover, cold to the touch. Those high thread fabrics always felt so silky and smooth, soft to sensitive skin, but also sleek and impersonal. The feeling of being on a business trip, residing in a posh hotel, was indivisibly connected. Sherlock had never minded, as the time he’d spent in his bed had always been out of mere necessity anyway. There had never been anything intriguing enough for him to spend more time in bed for. His transport needed time to recharge to go on with The Work and that was it. Tedious. Cold hadn’t been an issue as he’d only gone to bed when he was dead on his feet and was sure to fall asleep the moment he touched the mattress anyway.
“Of course…” John huffed, slightly worried that he was amused rather than alarmed by Scott’s statements.
He was gone irrevocably the moment he laid eyes on her face. Alien features, stunningly beautiful in an indescribable way, dark purple painted full lips, looking so soft and sinful all together, sharp cheekbones highlighted by just a slight shimmer of rose-golden rouge and eyes… eyes that made John’s heart stutter. Eyes surrounded by artfully drawn eyeliner and shadow in the same shade of purple, pronouncing their almond-shape, framed by long dark lashes, which had to be fake, John was almost sure.
Sherlock was slumping down and John thought he would fall, was about to rush towards him, but before he knew it Sherlock was straightening up, rising rather, and slumping down again. Fluid waves rolling through his whole body, rising and falling merging seamlessly into one another, again and again. Sherlock's entire being radiating power, strength, resistance. Radiating a message: nothing would hold him down, he would get up over and over again, no matter what it would take.
when he met his old med-school friend Mike at Regents Park, on that one day of all the days that he finally decided to leave his flat and join the world outside; still depressed, still seeing no purpose in life but also determined not to lose
The one night came to his memory when they had sat in their respective chairs, still shaken to the core, frightened by the amount of angst they’ve felt - not for themselves but for the other - but so reassured at the same time because they knew now - really knew - that they weren’t alone anymore.
“We’ve only just met and we're going to... what... live together?” he asked, making sure to add some teasing to his voice.
everyone, regardless which flavour or taste, is welcome here!! We’re one big bunch of queers of all kinds, sweetheart! Welcome to our humble community!! <3<3<3
Silence on the other end of the line. Confused and a bit insecure, Sherlock lifted the phone from his ear and checked the screen. Yes, the caller really was John.
John wondered if the fume building within him was actually visible on the outside—escaping his ears? Setting his face on fire? It most certainly was, as Miss Pirate had the guts to still hold his eyes while she was literally making out with another guy. How dare she? John wanted to look away, but wasn’t able to. So, he had to bear the image of another man’s hands grabbing Miss Pirate’s thighs while she made bedroom eyes at John. He had to witness another man lean forward and press his face between her breasts, while she grabbed his hair and bit her lips, hooded gaze fixed on John. He had to endure the guy’s greedy hands gliding up the most delicious neck in the universe, Miss Pirate tilting her head, looking from under her fluttering lashes into John’s narrowed eyes. When those hands that were not his’ reached the glorious curls and fingers tangled into the shiny chocolate hair to pull it, his churning guts turned into a thunderstorm; because he knew what it fucking did to Miss Pirate—it was the one thing that always, without failure, did his partner in. He fucking knew, that the way Miss Pirate closed her eyes in pleasure was too fucking real.
He watched the man in front of him and tried to take in every miniscule detail. The ruffled hair, the red rimmed eyes, the trembling parted lips, the adam's apple trying to swallow something away, the expanse of pale skin underneath that parted shirt, dusty bespoke trousers, knees digging into the dirt on the floor, legs framed by his own, hands still tightly pressed against his.
Sherlock winced, his heart clenching, his head swimming, because he had fought so hard but had lost the battle. He had been right. Sentiment was found on the losing side after all. John-on-screen raised his gaze, looking desperately into the camera.
John had understood, it was okay. No, not okay, but… He had made it clear in his letter, hadn't he? John recalled his letter, the song, mulled the thoughts he had had while writing it, while watching Sherlock sleep, while taking care of him. He had made clear that he'd take a step back if that was what Sherlock wanted. He had offered to support him in every way Sherlock needed him to. Wanted him to. Right? Would Sherlock still be concerned about John's attraction towards him? Was he afraid John would make an unwanted move on him?
At a loss, Sherlock just typed out his thoughts, ‘whose life would John Watson want to save?’, and swallowed when he saw the first search result in the row.
To escape this hell as fast as possible Sherlock directly retreated back into the halls of the one place he was completely in charge of. This was his sanctum, his refuge, his well organised chaos. He always immediately ended up entering the room he had created to store his John memories. He threw open the wing doors, looking around desperately to find anything that would hold the answer to all these new questions, when the paper snippets started whirling in front of him again.
“No, I know.”  His thoughts got quickly interrupted by that thrumming amused undertone again. “Just a fellow addict looking for the next hit.”
Back at Baker Street John didn’t even know how he had ended lying face down on his bed, but he sure as hell wouldn’t get up any time soon! Neither had he bothered to get out of his coat or shoes nor to pick up anything edible or things like a phone charger.
"No dear, sorry." She looked emphatically at him, pitying even. John had to look away. He swallowed.
John savored the warm buzz spreading in his stomach. Several beers and this quickly finished whisky already did their job to daze the gnawing thoughts roaming his mind. Nonetheless he welcomed the refilled tumblr Greg placed in front of him not much later.
Satisfied with himself and not expecting any reaction for the next couple of hours, Sherlock dropped his phone on the little table next to his chair. He was just about to settle in to sort all this new information when his phone pinged to announce a text message.
Sherlock felt a prickling on the back of his neck, a nervousness he hadn't been thinking he would still be capable of. He felt watched. Surely it was just Mycroft's silly CCTV cameras. Did Mycroft really think Sherlock wouldn't know? Idiot!
"Rosin. But only the Pirastro Goldflex. Obtainable exclusively at J P Guivier & Co Ltd on 99 Mortimer Street in Marylebone."
He squeezed his eyes shut for a fraction of a moment, just to gain back a little self-restraint, to get back his breath under control and to prevent himself from coming in his pants this very instant.
“Dull… dull… dull…” Sherlock mumbled, scrolling through forms that were attached to Lestrade’s emails. When John cleared his throat and threw him a warning glance, he backed down. “Dull for
They spent the evening together, had delicious lasagna. Even Greg had to admit, although reluctantly, that it was an improvement to fish-and-chips every other day. They had fun. They laughed. They talked. About everything but one topic. And John was glad about it, thankful. He loved his friends just a little bit more for it. Only when the skies went dark like ink and the night air started to smell of the first hints of the morning dew they parted. Or rather, Molly left. The first time this evening John felt something like embarrassment creeping up. Not to accompany Molly to the door would be rude. To stand next to them saying their goodbyes would be awkward. So John was relieved when Greg just took Molly in his arms for a quick hug and gave her a little peck on her cheek. He was grateful for their considerate behaviour. Great friends indeed!
Eventually, John dared to move his hand. On first instinct he brushed the curl that had fallen into Sherlock's face, from his forehead behind his ear. This was one of the instincts he had suppressed a million times in the last couples of years. It felt freeing to finally give in. A heretofore unperceived weight was lifted off of him when Sherlock didn't object. Rather the opposite actually. He closed his eyes, seemed to chase the touch, not unlike a cat. This realisation warmed John from the inside with a fuzzy happiness.
There was a link at the bottom of the mail which said exactly the same - 21 guns - and until now John had avoided to open it.
When the mattress dipped under his weight, Sherlock’s eyes popped open and he followed John’s sturdy and controlled movements. John settled between Sherlock’s legs and draped them over his own spread thighs to keep them apart. He reached for the hem of his own shirt to take it off. Sherlock raised one inquiring eyebrow.
As if to underline it John tugged on his shoulders in time with the words he was still quietly singing as if he couldn't make himself stop. It made his forearms slide over Sherlock's shoulders, his hands dangling behind his neck; John's fingers unintentionally tickling the hairs on Sherlock's nape. At least he thought it was unintentional, one never knew with one John Watson.
"I looked everywhere, Sherlock. I couldn't find you. I felt so helpless, so useless… I almost went crazy…"
Great. Good plan, Watson. But...how? It’s not as if he had a sparkling circle of acquaintances and friends left. So, he would have to go out and score somewhere else. Problem was — the days of his youth long gone, the night life of London’s underbelly not quite the same anymore, he didn't even know where to go. And even
"You also showed me what real passion and dedication to work looks like. You had a purpose in life and you shared it with me and with that you gave me one, too. Without knowing you also taught me that one doesn't need substances to feel high. A good chase through the streets of London can do that for you." He winked at Sherlock who luckily smirked back.
He tried to call himself to order, but he couldn’t help the hope bubbling over. However, knowing Sherlock, he was aware that it wasn’t an easy road ahead.
The one thing he was absolutely certain of wouldn’t change under any circumstances, was the warm feeling which spread through his chest thinking of said man. It was comforting and devastating at the same time now he could recognise it for what it was.
"Very eloquently put, Captain." Miss Pirate rumbled, a smug grin making her plush purple lips twitch. "Yes, the… bouncy-thing… was exclusively for you to enjoy. Have to reward my Captain for his excellent services, no?"
Sherlock still didn't dare to believe in a lasting relationship between them, because he not merely deemed it improbable but even impossible.
“Uhm… don’t know… let me think for a moment,” Greg said in mock contemplation, the cloud of fury nearly palpable around him. “Maybe, for a starter, that he’s a fucking idiot. Or… you could have kicked his arse and told him that he’s talking bullshit! What about telling him that
“Doesn’t matter,” he just said and already meant to hang up when John started talking more earnestly.
She had reached over and covered one of his large hands with her small and fragile one, skin crinkled and dotted with aging spots. He had watched how her thumb painted tiny circles on his palm.
“Only because you were distracting me with your inept handling of the trimmer.” Sherlock retorted snootily while nuzzling against John’s neck at the same time.
None of them had spoken. None of them had moved. John wasn't even sure if he had been breathing. He was very sure that he hadn't been able to form any kind of thought. His mind had ceased to function.
Furthermore you'll realise within this chapter that the songs will get a slightly different meaning. They've chosen them, they've talked through them as long as they were separated. Now they're together in one room the music will still be there, even more, it'll become one with the story, it'll be there to add to the plot/athmosphere and... *Sherlock voice* "It just sort of happens..." *Sherlock shrug*
The text alert couldn’t compete with the music, probably wouldn’t have woken him anyway and in the end even the screen went black from lack of energy; the music stopped, the messages remained unseen.
John cautiously ran his hands up and down his partner's damp back, feeling him shiver under his caress.
John licked his lips. Unaware and uninterested in who might observe his reaction, he shifted on his bar stool to make sitting and watching a bit more comfortable in his lower regions. It had only just started but this show already promised to be something special. Not only what the all too present dancing pole implied, but also a performance John had never seen before. Miss Pirate was on fire tonight.
“Right… so…” John cleared his throat. “Back into the lion's den tonight then. Where? How? Do you have a plan? Care to share?”
John was stunned by Sherlock’s pale skin looking so differently from what he thought to know so well. It appeared so much more alive and so much warmer, so much more tempting to touch. Lightened by the sun, it was nearly gleaming in the warm light. His skin seemed to glow and glitter. His dark curls shining and reflecting the sunbeams; ebony turned into a warm shade of molten chocolate, trickling down forehead and temples.
As if snapped out of a dream, Sherlock inhaled sharply, eyes flipping up to John’s. As fluent and quick as an escape artist Sherlock removed his pants and took hold of John’s hand to join him.
“As usual,” Sherlock murmured, smirk poorly hidden. John huffed, this time with nothing but amusement and love.
“If you must know,” Sherlock rolled his eyes for good measure, “I was able to deduce that you weren’t staying at a woman’s place—just friend or more than that—either, which was quite reassuring and…" he coughed, caught himself just in time.
“Whichever way, Sherlock. Please let us try again. We’ve both been through a lot. We’ve learned our lesson. Let’s do better this time!”
It had been a week since his attempts to get in contact with Sherlock. It had been even more since he had seen him. It had been roughly two since the last time he had been here, at Battersea. John couldn’t help the feeling that it had been here where it had all started to go to shit. Even though their situation had been tense before. Even though it actually hadn’t been great for months. But the start of their way down to the point he now found himself in, he could pinpoint to the day he had followed Sherlock to this place after their massive argument. When he had seen him dance for the very first time. Here he had realised what was at stake, here he had realised what he was losing and that he was losing it. And that was already nearly three weeks ago now. John didn’t know why he felt the urge to come back here, but it seemed to be the only connecting point to Sherlock he had left.
John had slept here? Here - neither wherever he lived now nor in his upstairs bedroom. So close... and Sherlock hadn’t been aware of it.
"Considering they only arrested him yesterday and they've only just started to investigate and look for evidence to his story I don't expect it too soon." Sherlock tried to reassure him. "Also, with the staff shortage due to the security measurements it'll take even longer."
“All your body hair lighter than your head’s then?” John really was craving more information about the man. He was also craving a lot of other things though. Please get the hint, Scott, please...
John was impressed by the courage of the man to speak up even though he wasn't exactly sure what he was referring to.
“I don’t even know your name.” John whispered, being sure that it wouldn’t matter anyway what the answer would be.
"Hey, hey, calm down. We're all in the same boat here, right?" the man said in a friendlier voice, but John didn't miss the devious belligerent spark in the man's eyes contradicting his pacifying behaviour. John narrowed his eyes.
"That's different and you damn well know it." John could barely contain his temper anymore. The poorly suppressed anger made his voice waver, made it unsteady.
Stubborn, as only brotherly rivalry could make him, Sherlock stomped his way through the streets. He took the underground, which he abhorred, but he was concerned that the cabby… any cabby actually would recognise him and try to make headlines out of their trip once Sherlock Holmes' again-disappearance got public. Better to avoid that. John wouldn't like it. So he did his utmost best to pick only the empty carriages of the trains, therefore he chose uncommon lines and connections, and if it was unavoidable to encounter people, he tried to hide behind newspapers as good as possible.
For a moment Sherlock just looked at him, scanning his face, searching his gaze. Then he lowered his eyes.
John reached out and gently placed his hand on Sherlock’s chest. The sight of his own skin on Sherlock’s skin, the feeling of a rapidly beating heart under his palm, the slight pressure against his hand caused by the in and out of a living human’s breathing—a living
“And that was a consistent issue, bothering you no matter which situation we were in—club, breakfast, eying me over the edge of your book as if I wouldn’t notice… always the same.”
John sucked in a sharp breath and stared at Greg in horror. He felt lightheaded and there was a faint thrumming in his ears. He wished the ground would open and swallow him up. But when he surfaced again, he realised that Greg was looking empathically at him, friendly, supporting, worried.
!!!” John screamed, leaning on Sherlock’s wobbling chest, unable to hold himself up from laughter. “You’re never ever again allowed to make puns!! Oh God, I…” He didn’t get any further as a new wave of giggles took over until tears fell from his eyes again—this time from happiness and relief and love.
"No, now I think about it… actually not," John was astonished himself. "Are you a cuddler?" he wanted to know.
However, there was still obvious hesitation caused by self-doubt and insecurities; John was determined to slay that dragon as well.
The night was endless agony, ink-black and dreadful. Full of unbidden thoughts. Filled with futile memories. He didn't even succeed in hiding in his mind palace. All he wanted was to be somewhere else. Someone else. Anyone.
Later he thought, he should just have trusted his gut feeling, because suddenly, in the blink of an eye, Miss Pirate was taking firm hold of the pole, swung herself backwards and up in a somersault kind of roll, came standing steadily on her feet again facing the backstage stage area—leaving the audience with the view of the pole pressed against her back, legs spread, hips tilted to accentuate her arse pushed against the metal, hands behind her back still holding onto the Jolly Roger and—John inhaled sharply—cuffed with their own handcuffs around the pole. John’s eyes flipped up, looking for a clue about what was going on, but the back of Miss Pirate’s curly head was all he got to see before the dramatic pirate’s tune accumulated into one last thundering note and the room went dark.
John didn’t miss the fact of Mycroft switching in his form of address, but couldn’t shake the feeling that it only made the serious words even more meaningful. He swallowed hard, never having received this much appreciation by Mycroft Holmes. He was baffled and lost for words. As in slow motion he accepted the envelope, and was surprised by its weight. By now he couldn’t hide the shaking of his hands any longer and didn’t want to. Mycroft would have picked up on his tension and anxiety anyway. Also, the man had been on the forefront of everything that had happened during the last weeks, there was little that still needed to be hidden. And wasn’t that the whole point? Not to hide any longer? Wasn’t that what he had fought for? To accept and express and cherish openly from now on?
“And we’ve barely started…” Sherlock pointed out half-heartedly. “Maybe… maybe do my legs first? Can’t promise that I’d be capable of standing upright… after…”
if this could work. This specifically gave John the confirmation that Sherlock was serious and intended to make this work, to give it a chance.
He took a step closer, looked closer. All the little things John, pieces of a past Sherlock had never had access to. What a wasted opportunity. Cautiously he picked up a picture of John as a kid. He wished he already would have known him back then.
He settled back down next to the couch table and accompanied by the song on this single record John continued to roam his belongings.
“Jesus Christ, you’re not really experienced in this, are you?” A sharp laugh escaped John’s throat despite his short breath. “How do you even keep this job with this kind of talk? Don't you send your clients running?”
Breathlessly waiting for what would happen next, John watched each little movement of Sherlock closely, still bothered by how Sherlock had managed to hide this from him all this time they had lived together. Or had John been too unobservant? Wasn't that what Sherlock accused him of constantly? Had he seen but not observed - once again? How could John of all people have missed that Sherlock's passion wasn't exclusively for The Work?
... in which questions are asked and answers are given, in which confessions are made and concerns laid to rest... in which they refill stock and take stock, in which one case gets closure and one case is solved. In which they find a way back to their old life and start anew.
John swallowed. Speechless. Tried not to break down and lose his mind. He had gone through a lot with his mad flatmate, his best friend, his partner. But this?
It was a printout. The lyrics in printed characters, neatly arranged. Despite his nervousness a fond smile spread on his face when he saw that Sherlock had scribbled notes and additions all over the page. ‘
Alternatingly his legs were stretched outwards to his sides, long, slender. Like roots searching for ground to hold on to. His body bending over as if drawn to them, arms following the motion.
know Scott's voice. He would recognise it, wouldn't he? But then voices could be distorted through the phone. Probably Scott knew about the effect his voice had on people and made use of it for work, sounding completely different in real life? No, impossible! Or not? John could run into him and not recognise him at all! That thought was strangely disturbing.
Only a couple of strokes later, not able to warn the other, he could only gasp before seeing stars, feeling his chest tighten, as he was coming hard, spilling on the strangers hand and his own shirt and trousers. Wave after wave of pleasure ripped through him and his come kept spurting with each tease and stroke the Pirate gave his cock to guide him through his orgasm.
“But… we’re still… friends. Are we?” John didn’t know if he wanted to hear the answer. But he had to know. Sherlock seemed so angry. Was he that desperate to get rid of John?
She now ran her fingers along her neck, down her chest, cupping her breast with her hands and pausing there for the tiniest moment. One couldn’t hear above the music, but one could imagine the little moan escaping her throat. After a very little squeeze of her breasts, which drove John mad, she continued her path sliding her exquisite hands down her belly. John held his breath about what was to come.
Without giving it a second thought, Sherlock headed towards the heavy gates protecting Mycroft's property like a bulwark. Luckily he knew the code to open them. Not so much knew it, but deduced it. 06011977. Even Mycroft had his weak spots. Disgusting. Probably, he would still get notice of Sherlock's little trip, but there'd be nothing for him to do about it. And after all, it had been Sherlock's own decision to avoid the outside world. Now it was his decision to take the risk. Who was Mycroft to stop him.
Calmly the car made its way through the London traffic and regardless of his usual restlessness, right this moment Sherlock was thankful for this slow approach. He needed to calm down, once again trying to think of nothing. This ran the risk of becoming a habit, his brain would shrivel and give up thinking completely at some point.
Sherlock dipped his head again and John expected a kiss. He didn't expect the heart attack Sherlock's low rumbling voice speaking directly into his ear caused him.
He came across articles about his school days, little John in soccer dress, in another one him among his team mates proudly leaning on their squash rackets, a single one about a concert where he played the clarinet - rather badly he had to admit, his parents had never been fond of it either.
The shy shrug and the averted eyes told John that Sherlock knew exactly what he was talking about. After their intense talk the night before he had a suspicion as to why Sherlock would have lied to him at that point. Or rather hadn't told John the whole truth. However, there was one thing that bothered John ever since.
“Of course you can!” Greg squeaked in friendly annoyance. “You know… open your mouth… voice and all… and say it. Easy!”
“You really are, Greg. I don’t know how to thank you for everything. I mean… I don't know what the outcome of this meeting with Sherlock will be, but whatever will happen will be better than before. I couldn't have done this without you.” John swallowed and nodded.
At least, now he could be that honest with himself. That this was what it had always been. The feeling hadn’t changed, but now… it had a name! And he couldn’t deny that name. He didn’t want to deny… that he… loved Sherlock Holmes. Just the thought of it made John’s heart beat faster. Yes. He wanted to scream it from the top of the roofs. He was in love with Sherlock Holmes!
Standing in close proximity, Sherlock observed him for a moment wordlessly. Without letting John go, without stepping back, he pulled his mobile phone out of his trouser pocket and started searching its content. While Sherlock looked down on the screen, John studied his face, marvelled at his profile. Did Sherlock even know how beautiful he was? He wasn’t just a handsome bloke as John had seen many in his life. There were enough people who were pleasant to look at. However Sherlock… he was way out of the ordinary. Extraordinary
“This song…” Sherlock said without looking up, oblivious to John’s rapture. He kept scrolling with one hand, the other still holding John’s wrist tightly. “Ever since the day at Bart’s, when I jumped, it has been your song. I would play it and think of you. On my mission, no matter where I was or what had happened, I would listen to it to remind me what I was enduring it for. It was one of the first things I downloaded when I once again lost my phone, needed a new number or a new identity. I knew it by heart and could retreat to it in my head, when there was no way to actually listen to it.” John got a bit nauseous imagining the scenarios Sherlock mentioned. When apparently Sherlock had found what he was looking for, his head snapped up and he held John’s gaze. “It kept me alive,” he said. “And I never thought I’d ever show it to you.”
OF COURSE purely for scientific reasons, lovely ;-) <3 You’re really adorable, hun! You can freely admit your crush on your not-as-obvious-as-anyone-flatmate John here, darling. Here’s a safe space for everyone! I love all my fellow friends
“Some stores, some random cafes, never staying long enough for us to retrieve him. There was no pattern, no logic to it and you know Sherlock…”. With that he looked directly at John. Holding his gaze for a while before lowering his head.
Give him some big squishy cuddles from us!! I wish you both a nice “sharing of knowledge” and keep me updated how it went if you like!!!
John had moved them away from the door opening so that they were now slowly spinning through the kitchen; at least through those parts where there was enough space to do so without toppling over any of their clutter or Sherlock's experiments. Suddenly, all this held a peculiar kind of beauty he had never been aware of before; as if he had never seen it from this angle or in this light; as if a veil was lifted from his eyes.
and already Sherlock had made a mess of it. Exactly what he had been afraid of. But John had seen, John had understood. The sensation of John’s warm skin still on his hand, the short subtle squeeze telling him ‘I’m here, I’ll stay’ was all the reassurance he needed. John wouldn’t leave. They still had a chance.
John's chuckle turned into a full-blown laugh. Surprisingly, his...genitals, as the man had said, didn't seem affronted in the slightest. Rather the opposite...
Outside he was greeted by a cold night breeze. He turned the corner of the club to stand just out of the wind and lean against the wall a bit to look up. The sky was clear and a thousand stars were reflecting their light towards earth. It had always fascinated him; astrology. Even more so after the beautiful skies of the Afghanan dessert, which were so different from all he knew. “
... in which John is surprised by a variety of offers, his own emotions, creatures of the night, an old name and a new turn in the case.
"And I never thought I'd say this and I can't believe I'm saying it now, but… you also helped me by cock-blocking all my dates." He drew his eyebrows together and mockingly glared at Sherlock, who barked out a laugh which was beautifully echoed by the expanse of the hall around them.
“I can assure you, that your pretty curly head will be as safe as it has ever been. There’ll be absolutely no threat where I am taking you…”
"John, that's not… " she refused but was interrupted by Greg's bark of laughter. A hard slap of Greg's hand on John's shoulder told him he wouldn't get any more out of the two and saw himself confirmed when Greg shook his head.
Each sucking in a breath, they broke apart, staying close, holding each other tight but unrestricting.
"What?" John shouted, as far as that was possible in his wedged-like-a-sardine-in-a-tin-state. "I thought you liked my beard!" As punishment he only intensified his efforts, reveling in the sniggering and wiggling it caused.
Running his fingertips through Sherlock's curls, which felt electrified like light wire and were sending crackling tension over his scalp and down his spine, John swallowed, obviously preparing to speak. The expression on his face could have been used as the illustration next to the word affection in a dictionary. Sherlock waited, stayed quiet. His senses clear enough to know that there was something to be said that was important to John. After a while John cleared his throat and seemed to have found back his voice.
"Sherlock. Just… sit." Mycroft broke his muteness. After a short moment of hesitation he silently added, "Please."
Somehow Sherlock gained the impression that John didn't mind this particular set of "flaws" in the slightest. He remembered all the occasions John had thrown him an amused glance after he had once again rushed through a crime scene, insulted Anderson, delighted about the next mystery to be solved.
Oh shit, this man really wasn’t doing things by half. His plain bluntness was even sexier than any playfulness could be. John exhaled, feeling his denims grow uncomfortably tight.
Procrastinating any longer would be embarrassing so John raised to his feet and with it prompted Mycroft to do the same. The blink and you'll miss it glance towards the bedroom door didn't escape John's notice though. Mycroft tugged on the seam of his waistcoat to straighten it and raised his chin.
These two silly notes in John's neat stocky writing, scribbled down in doctor-y haste, were more than Sherlock had ever expected to see from John again his life. And it was nearly more than he could bear.
“But you’ve only seen me twice,” Sherlock swallowed, his voice was thick and he realised that this was the first time he had spoken since they’d left Baker Street, “how is that enough times to make this assumption?” Sherlock could have smacked himself. Why was he getting defensive again? He knew why. The two times John had watched him had been some of his most unguarded moments. And they had both hurt. And he was still embarrassed about both of them. Breaking down that spectacularly in front of John who had to pick up his pieces afterwards and nurse him back to consciousness
"I was merely trying to understand the reasoning. Why would he bring wine when you clearly said candle."
At the corner of Baker Street he stopped his stride, nerves suddenly prickling up his neck and over his scalp. Looking diagonally across the street he could see Speedy's red awning. Impressive how different such a simple sight can feel. Not long ago in the rain it had felt like desperation and dread, a few days later it had felt like loss and emptiness. Now though, it felt like hope, like confidence, like a thousand bees buzzing through his body.
"Will you never—not EVER—do that again, young man?!" she had scolded him while pushing him into one of the chairs at her kitchen table. "If I have to get
was there with him that morning." Sherlock tilted his head. The annoyance seemed to turn into honest puzzlement.
Each time, the genius somehow managed to summon up a new attire for John—with different levels of daddy-vibes, as the man called it—depending on the role Sherlock wanted him to play; always bespoke and complete. And by complete he meant… well,
The moment the lyrics started he felt his arms rising, his hands gripping his head, his fingers resting  in his curls. He pressed his fingertips firmer into his scalp to register the touch and to feel more grounded, to be aware of the present and to prevent himself from floating and soaring and losing himself as he was so often afraid of.
,” he pointed at the first strip glued to the skin of Sherlock’s shin, “is definitely all three of it! Additionally, it’s completely bonkers!!” he shouted.
This was pure logic. But then, logic never had been John's forte. Maybe Sherlock couldn't expect that much of him in his current situation.
He sighed, half pleased by that image, half frustrated about the situation. Where was Sherlock? What was he doing? Was he safe? What if Sherlock needed him and he wouldn't know? They were on a case after all! John didn’t like that one bit, losing sight of his Pirate, not knowing what was going on. Yes, fine… girls’ area didn’t sound too threatening. But what was there possibly to still be prepared anyway. Hadn’t they done all that at home already? And what was he supposed to do now, huh? Stupid case!
He watched how John's eyelids dropped shut, a traitorous moist shimmer covering his whimpers, the second before his own eyes closed of their own volition.
Last night, when Sherlock had been distracted and John had almost caught him staring and absorbing John’s adorable laugh, he had made a mistake. John had told him about some silly post on his favourite social media platform, assuming Sherlock would know all about it and Sherlock hadn’t corrected him. Then, unfortunately for Sherlock, John had blushed slightly and suggested this evening they could have a tumblr-night instead of their usual movie-night. They’d scroll through their blogs together and show each other their favourite posts. As Sherlock couldn’t imagine John would find it pleasurable to scroll through 243 types of tobacco ash, he feared that John expected him to have some other kind of blog with amusing content. Considering Sherlock didn’t desire to be exposed and to risk jeopardizing an evening on the sofa with a lovely and happy and affectionate and perfect John Watson, research was required.
Eyes closed, starting with a terrible headache, Sherlock mentally scanned his body for further damage. Doing so it was as if he could feel every single one of the 700 muscles and 206 bones in his body. He checked them one by one while naming them, making sure his brain wasn't affected by whatever has caused his current state. But he couldn't detect any signs of major injuries or fractures. Nevertheless he felt like he had been struck by a truck, as if he had hit the pavement.
He reached out to turn the volume down while opening his eyes. His view was blurred by tears and from his eyes being squeezed shut far too long. He cleared his throat and reached forward for the laptop and only then realised a little movement to his left. John turned his head and froze, his breath faltered. He didn’t dare to move let alone say anything.
“We’re here now, Sherlock! Together! We’ve been given this chance to try again, yeah?” Sherlock turned his head and hid his face against John’s neck. John could feel irregular puffs of warm breath ghost down under his collar. Fists were tightly clenching the shirt on his back.
It wasn’t long before Miss Pirate rose again and cheekily donned her hat, and sauntered over the stage, hips swaying. The purple coloured nail of one index finger running over the bare flesh between panty and stockings unavoidably lifted the skirt and revealed the gun to the audience. John could see the flicker of excitement on more than one flushed face among the men gaping at
“”Listen… Apparently Moriarty’s organisation is even bigger than expected. Well, unexpected for everyone but me maybe…” he muttered.
But reality was floating when the fading scent of fresh roasted toast tricked him into expecting to hear the familiar sound of John clattering on in the kitchen - even though the quietness of the flat told him that he was alone.
"Because it... makes me... your property." Sherlock grunted with difficulty, breath harsh, leaving only few breaks to speak. "Your… Oh God, oohhh…" he groaned, barely able to form full sentences anymore, "...your possession..." He increased his endeavours. "And I'm not, John!" he almost shouted, desperately gripping John's shoulders, digging his fingers painfully in John's muscles.
reacted the way you did, Sherlock." He tried to get Sherlock's face in view by shifting the man slightly in his arms. "You avoided that question deliberately, didn't you?" That thought had just popped up in his mind and John wondered if it was true.
He dipped the tip of his tongue between Sherlock's parted lips, seeking for permission. Reflexively, Sherlock's tongue surged forward, making contact, sliding against John's without restraint. John groaned again, forcing a low rumble from Sherlock's throat in response.
So much evidence of John's life at 221b and nevertheless Sherlock could feel the emptiness of the flat. It wasn't the ‘John-had-a-shift-at-the surgery-emptiness’ or the ‘John-had-left-doing-groceries-without-Sherlock-noticing-emptiness’. No, it was no doubt a ‘John-left-for-good-emptiness’. He had even left in such a hurry and in such desperation that he hadn't cared to take his most valuable belongings. Leaving had seemingly been more important at that point than sentiment. That was uncharacteristic for a John Watson. Sherlock summarised his deductions. This was serious. This was final.
He smiled back at her, small but reassuring, and they turned in silent agreement and walked over to the bar.
flattered by your interest. And would I have been honest with myself, I was much more than just flattered." He looked somewhat apologetic at John; waited for a reaction. John only dropped his gaze for a short moment, shook his head slightly and smiled knowingly. When he looked back up there was nothing but fondness in his eyes. He stayed silent so Sherlock carried on.
And to finish the breath-taking appearance, there were those tight tights hugging his legs,  accentuating the muscles of his thighs and arse in a sinful way.
Still, this was true! John was happy when he was together with Sherlock! He’d like to feel reckless again together with Sherlock on cases, chases through London, giggling at crime scenes. He wanted to feel careless and free again, because who cares about decency anyway?
“Interesting.” And back was the confident deep rumbling purr. Holy Fuck, how was it possible for one word to send John’s hormones flying? Was he really that desperate? Well, he hadn’t been at the beginning of the call...
Enduring the dial menu like a pro, pressing option #2 without hesitation, waiting impatiently to be put through and… Shit! … how could he even be sure it would be Scott on the line? Maybe it was his day off? Or there were loads of operators at the same time, like those customer services. What then? Could he ask for Scott? No, probably not. Just hang up and dial again? But there was this access charge each time… How often would he have to try? Should he even try again? What if…
"John," whispered Sherlock, and when John lifted his gaze, the man towering over him was obviously moved.
and read about a man called Eric Grandon, who was showing signs of Gulf War syndrome and post-traumatic stress disorder after six tours to the Middle East. He battled anxiety, depression and suicidal thoughts by keeping bees and claimed that they had saved his life. Apiculture against suicide? There was a thought, Sherlock mused, eyeing his bookshelves where more than one guide about beekeeping was stored. Maybe, all this time, he had had an inkling about the merits of it. Apart from the honey that is…
Reaching one corner he proceeded to big long leaps alternating with fast turns in a big circle, trying to take over the whole room, owning it all, leaving no space for anything else. Just him, just the music, just his movements. Feeling all the power reigning his muscles.
“Silly,” Sherlock huffed but carried on talking anyway. “Well then, after my hair had dried and still no significant effect was visible I tried out the treatment with benzalkonium chloride. Despite better knowledge I held some hope for the effect of the chloride components. It was worth a try,” he shrugged.
He had talked to Sherlock? With Sherlock? Talked with Sherlock without the man being present? This sounded vaguely familiar.
The music faded, John tapped the screen again and silence spread in the room uncomfortably. Even the water seemed to stop sloshing against the outer shell of the boat. Both men cautious, tentative, hesitant.
"Oh, you nutter," John pulled Sherlock in for a kiss. "You're Miss Pirate, wear the damn costume!" he chuckled and pinched Sherlock's bum.
Rolling the tumbler with expensive whiskey he actually couldn’t afford between his palms, he tried to stretch the time as long as possible before he had to make his inevitable way back to his lonely bedsit.
“So… it became… it was… it didn't work anymore. You know how things can get then. Shouting, rows, pouting. You know
“Sherlock William Shezza Elle Holmes, you amazing researching and violin-playing Dancing Drag Pirate Detective… I love you to the moon and back with everything you are and everything you’ll ever be! But don’t expect for one single second that I’ll ever stop being jealous!!!” he said, happy laughter mixing with his tears strained voice.
“Sherlock, what…” John sat up, watching his partner whirl through the door into the hallway and down the stairs.
we understand, you know? But we don't… actually. We just think we do and… And then I mean we both! And then… Shit, does that even make sense?"
"... you're well educated, not actually self-conscious but insecure to go out for some reason, otherwise you wouldn't be calling a mediocre phone sex hotline. Most likely also means you're living alone, without much money, so probably not yet that long in the place you currently live in, which by the way seems to be sparsely furnitured too, judging by the reverberation. You're already bored with a need for company but no overly urgent sex drive, at least not at the moment. Still you chose to call this line anyway, apparently desperate for at least some kind of interaction, which indicates mental issues. With the tendency of avoidance of attachment my guess is PTSD. Otherwise there'd be no logical reason for a man like you to be alone. Combined with the aforementioned indicators it's obvious really: soldier, probably injured in battle. Recently invalided home then. So, again...which is it? Afghanistan or Iraq?" The bastard had the audacity to sound smug. Well, he had any right to though.
Sherlock pulled off the soiled sheets and then laid out his costume on the mattress. Seeing Sherlock handling all the lace and velvet and leather, made John's pulse speed up in joyous anticipation. But Sherlock also pulled a box from the depths of his cupboard John had never seen before. John frowned and walked over to him.
dumb. Even I would notice all the freaking tunnels I’ve just run through and I sure as hell have been on a different platform just there. So yeah, definitely not going the same way back I’d say.” John snarked, embarrassingly out of breath. He definitely had had better days…
“You know it didn’t suit me as well as it does you. Your very own study confirmed it.” Sherlock smirked, but the way he longingly scanned John’s bearded face took away all the effect of his smugness.
John. He had not changed the sound of the message alert yet. It didn't seem necessary, considering it had never been the intention for John to contact him again. The messages came in like rapid fire and left Sherlock no time or chance to respond. He read through them. Eyes wide. And suddenly they stopped.
Although his body had always been something different altogether. He had always claimed it to be just transport - had never treated it well except for his dressing and grooming habits. John had always suspected that
All the while Sherlock kept transforming the melody into trancelike motions. He reminded John of anemones pulled and pushed by the undersea current. His upper body dipped sidewards, arms seemingly limp but controlled nonetheless. Rising, led by long legs, first bowed then stretched towards the desired direction. No edges, no hesitations, no interruptions. Fluid. Molten. Yet, weirdly matching and mirroring John’s drumming heartbeat.
Letting army medals and badges slip through his fingers, thoughts crossed his mind and shifted into one another. Fragments like shards picked from the memory of a past broken into a thousand pieces.
directly filled his body with a steady rhythm, his muscles slowly started to work on their own. Some sort of nervous energy making him twitch, like an itch simmering under his skin, wanting to be scratched but never easing.
John didn’t even know to whom he was pleading, but he felt the immense urge to beg to someone, something, whatever… as long as it would help! He was desperate, felt the path lock around his feet, the road becoming a river with only one destination.
John lifted an innocent looking bag of strips and skin coloured tissues and cloths. Sherlock cleared his throat.
He wondered what the text could mean. Finally, John was awake? Finally, they had spoken after the argument? But that hadn’t been particularly successful, had it? Finally he got away? Finally… what? It didn’t make any sense. Until John glimpsed the time it had been sent: “3:52am”.
“Pompous idiot whining about doing his job. His sole purpose in life is to fix what the current idiots elected to reign this country are apparently incapable of managing. In this case exhaustive tracking, testing, registering and treatment of Covid-19 infected people.” He was furiously typing away on his phone before he dumped it on the kitchen table.
Overall, whatever they were up to, Sherlock seemed to be brimming from energy and excitement. John on the contrary didn't get the impression they made any progress at all. He also didn’t see much difference regarding the spicing up part—not the way Sherlock had implied at least; no danger beyond the usual at the horizon. The only thing that might hint at an underlying threat was Sherlock sometimes asking him to be particularly careful or to keep an eye out or not to mention this or that during his conversations.
