“There's no need for you to be involved,” Michael said, getting up to escort him out. “Just let me worry about tonight, and you can worry about finding a familiar, okay?”
Dean licks his lips. "Because—Bobby almost died, and I thought I was going to die soon, so. I did it."
It’s all kinds of ridiculous. It’s a birthday party for a four-year old, Dean wants to scream. Jack would rather get a shitty Peppa Pig plastic table cover or something with snakes. The only reason he doesn’t say so is because tablecloths will be the last thing Jack will be interested in on that night. It’d be pretty pointless to fight about them.
Using a flint and steel to light his pipe, Dean inhales, lets the smoke sit inside him for a long moment, exhales a silver cloud. “Most ships are unprepared for an attack like that. More often than not, there are no survivors. That’s why it’s our job to kill as many monsters as we can.”
to drive you all the way out here is not ‘nothing.’” Not the most masterful way to divert the topic away from Castiel but hey, Dean’s not known for being subtle when desperate (and maybe a bit flustered). And anyway it works.
“And I’m a doctor,” Castiel goes on, not even trying to pretend he doesn’t need Dean’s help to stay upright. With the amount of alcohol in his blood it’s a miracle he hasn’t fallen asleep yet, but he’s getting there. “I’d make a good impression on your family.”
And Dean couldn’t wait any longer. He yanked Castiel closer, wrapping him in a tight hug. He buried his nose in his throat and took a deep breath. He’d never get enough of this, he thought, loving how easily Castiel fit in his arms. They broke apart only for Dean to capture Castiel’s lips in a fiery kiss that made his whole body tingle.
“Only what’s in articles and online,” Castiel admits, giving him a sheepish smile. Maybe it's fake and purposefully plays up Castiel's expressive eyes, but Dean has to admit it's damn adorable. “But those are not the most interesting parts,” Castiel adds, the end of his sentence left hanging, like he has more to say.
“But that’s just how Kevin is,” Anna said, a sympathetic hand on his shoulder. “He’s always been like that, you can’t just ask him to change.”
With a dramatic sigh, Balthazar drops to sit on the bed, shoving Castiel’s legs away to make room in the process. “I thought we just established that it’s like I’ve given birth to you. You thought I didn’t know?”
Harry and Eddie bring one of their heavier chains. They mumble apologies as they help tie Dean to the mast under Sam’s watchful eye. Dean is trapped in a matter of seconds, but still he fights back. Even from half a ship away, Castiel can see his muscles tensing, chain digging into his skin.
He finds Charlie sprawled on a deck chair, wearing a high cut blue one-piece with white stars. He’s starting to see a pattern in the swimsuits everyone’s chosen. Even Sam’s is a generic shade of blue that fits with the theme of the day. Dean packed his black one. Eh, the others can deal.
“No,” Castiel replies. “What am I supposed to say? ‘Hey, Dean, I kind of eavesdropped on you and Charlie and heard that you may have feelings for a dude named Aaron?’”
He shouldn’t let his emotions get in the way, and more importantly, there shouldn’t have been any emotions in the first place. Cas is doing this for Inias. He won’t betray his memory and what they had for a night of carnal pleasure. Castiel is better than that. Inias
"Alright, it's settled. And what do you want to do now? I don't mind staying here, but it is kind of uncomfortable so I'd rather get us some pillows to sit on."
The pirates around them turn back to whatever they’d been doing before, their curiosity satisfied for now, but more than likely not eager to have Dean come after them.
Dean opens and closes his mouth in quick succession. For a moment, he considers following them and explaining he’s not a nanny, but then again this place is huge and he’s not sure he’ll be able to find the front door again without any help. Besides, Jack is staring at him with huge, curious eyes, and Dean doesn’t have the heart to leave the kid alone. No, it’d be dangerous to leave the kid alone.
Nimble fingers work to untie Castiel's belt, loosen his breeches, and then Dean has his palm pressed over Castiel's dick, and everything else fades away.
“No, I’m not letting it go,” Jo insists. “Because I’m a damn good pirate and an even better hunter, and none of you would have argued about that a few weeks ago.”
“I’ll make sure to deliver them,” Castiel said dryly, but he couldn’t fight back the beginnings of a smile.
It’s stupid to antagonize his captors, but Castiel is emboldened by the knowledge that they need him, and that, at least for the foreseeable future, they’re not going to kill him. He agreed to help them because he had no other choice, but he’s decided he is not going to be nice about it.
“We have eyes,” Sam says, tone carefully even and neutral. If he’s interpreting Dean’s silence for what it is—a nervous breakdown—then he doesn’t show it. “We saw how he was looking at you at Claire’s party. How he looks at you all the time.”
“We’re already on edge with the human hunters growing in numbers, do you really think we need another war with the witches right now?” Bobby asked, a vein pulsing on his flushed forehead.
“Is this about a professional matter, Mr. Novak?” Dean questions. Bobby and Rufus have developed a very sudden and very intense interest in the bottoms of their mugs, but really, Dean knows them well enough to know their antennae are out and recording everything. He better not give them anything they can use against him later.
Sam released a breath he didn’t know he’d been holding. His hands itched to reach and touch her, comfort her in any way he could, but he knew he wasn’t allowed to. “Are you okay?”
Castiel swallows. “I—I only like men,” he admits for the first time in the twenty-eight years he’s been alive. Dean smiles, leans forward to press a chaste kiss to his lips, and Castiel sighs into it.
“I like pies,” Jack says, perking up at the sound of one of his favorite words in the world—and how this boy is not related to Dean remains a mystery. “Are we making a pie today?”
“I know you,” Castiel points out. “Besides, I ran a background check on you before I hired you, remember?”
“Are you seriously trying to act like nothing’s going on?” Dean throws his arms over his head and proceeds to count on his fingers. “You undress me with your eyes every time you see me, you keep on flirting, and touching, and staring. And let’s not even talk about all the times you said we shouldn’t do ‘this’ and then immediately turned around and kissed me.”
“I— uh, I was just visiting Inias,” Castiel said, twisting around in an effort to find an excuse to send her away. Had she looked in his room? Even if she had, she hadn’t found Dean, otherwise they’d be having a very different conversation right now.
They shuffle around the room, careful to make as little sound as possible. Rufus mumbles something in his sleep that sounds like a curse when Claire grumbles at her dad for waking her up, but he rolls over and falls right back asleep. Bobby doesn’t so much as stir when Dean removes his boots and takes his hat off before covering him with one of the sheets he pulls from the fort. He does the same for Rufus, extra cautiously, because Rufus is known to throw a punch first and ask questions later.
Dean pushes a finger over Castiel’s lips—kind of chapped but plush and pink and pretty—to shush him. “I mean that we should give them what they want. Which is us in a happy loving relationship, which requires zero commitment and time outside of family dinners.”
“Samuel’s in jail, right.” Michael pinched the bridge of his nose, taking a deep breath. “Can somebody please explain to me what’s going on around here?”
The cold threat of Dean’s gun pressed right under Castiel’s jaw remains even when the man himself is gone.
Plus it’s more efficient to pass papers and notes to each other over the half-wall separating them than keep sending files back and forth.
," Dean continues without slowing down or giving Castiel an opportunity to answer, "I'd suggest you be a good boy and do as you are told."
Dean keeps his expression blank. “Yeah. Yeah, me, too. So, um, wanna finish setting up the TV in the living room?”
“It’s Halloween,” Charlie says with a grin, following the others inside, and she winks at Jo. “You’re supposed to dress up as something you’re not.”
The sharp sound of tires screeching and repeated honking from the other side of the line makes Castiel wince as he pulls the phone away from his ear. Sam is still firing a hundred questions a second at him, too fast for Castiel to follow.
In response Dean, pressed as he was against Castiel’s knees and thighs, went stiff, and Castiel was quick to backtrack. “It’s none of my business, sorry. I shouldn’t have asked that. I’m just glad to see you…”
And Dean’s going to give it to him. All he has to do is turn up the charm and force himself to have a good time. Easy-peasy. It doesn’t matter if he's ready to collapse from exhaustion. Doesn’t matter at all.
The map leads not only to a location but a specific date as well. They need a summer full moon to reach Lilith, the sea witch.
Chest buzzing like a colony of bees has decided to use it for their  new home, Dean knocks once and sticks his head inside. His heart instantly melts at the sight before him.
He fingers at the small, black bow that is doing its best to choke him and scans the room. Uriel is standing by a grotesque statue, head bent close with one of Castiel’s men, Daniel. Castiel sees red.
“Well, I can’t say no when you’re so polite. But you have to help me clean up so we can go, okay? How about you put all those tiny pieces back in their box?” Dean’s knees will thank him eternally if he doesn’t have to spend ten minutes kneeling on the floor to clean up that mess.
Dean bites the inside of his cheek. Claire is not avoiding Castiel. She’s, most likely, avoiding Dean. But since Dean doesn’t know why (yet) he decides that’s something Castiel doesn’t need to know. (Also yet.)
Dean’s hold on his shoulder became firmer for a second before falling away. “Goodbye, Cas. I can never repay you for helping me.”
The two girls broke apart, alarmed. Dean caught sight of at least one hand moving for the shortsword left on the floor in front of them.
want to talk to her?” Meg asks, an eyebrow raised. She stares at Dean, like she’s trying to look straight into his thoughts and figure him out. At last she nods. “Fine. You go talk to her, and I’ll stay here with Jack to call Clarence. But I’ll be watching you, Winchester, so keep your hands to yourself.”
“I… I didn’t know it could look like this,” Castiel said, and he sounded as breathless as Dean felt.
"Nothing useful," Castiel sighs. There's nothing they can use on the men, except for their guns and spare magazines. Those he gathers to take with them. "Come on we gotta get rid of the bodies and clean up the blood. If the KGB knows about this place we need to clear all evidence we were here when they come looking again."
“It’s fine. I’m trying to encourage my son to get out of his comfort zone and meet new friends these days, so this was a perfect opportunity for me. So, you’re the new nanny?” She walks towards a bench and pats the seat next to her.
Castiel chokes when he tries to swallow. His whole body starts trembling, and he knows the end is near.
Unable to use his mouth to produce any coherent sound, Mick shook his head, eyes frantically pointing to the direction they’d just come from. A vampire. A real vampire was feeding on a poor woman so close to them, and they were letting it. Pulse speeding up, he tried to shove away, but it was like trying to knock down a wall with his bare hands. Sam’s hold on him was like iron.
Charlie and Garth follow her inside grateful for the break, as they rub the sore muscles of their shoulders. Castiel would make a move to follow them, but Dean is still staring at him, brow relaxed, eyes soft, and Castiel's stomach is filled with butterflies. It’s hard to resist when Dean’s right in front of him, and he'd rather stay with him than have lunch any day.
In the photo, Sam is throwing his cap in the air. Dean has an arm thrown over his shoulders. They’re both blurry, caught in the middle of a motion, but the smiles on their faces are as bright as ever. Dean was happy here.
Dean sighs and throws an arm around Castiel’s shoulders. “Hey, he’s a smart kid. We’ll tell him not to use it at pre-school. Give me five minutes to lock, and we’ll go. Okay?”
Rowena raises her chin, authority and pity mixing battling over her expression. “I have no jurisdiction over the Empty, you know that.”
“Him being on this ship is the only reason he’s trying to get better,” Castiel says, trying to comfort Dean. “You made the right choice to get him out of there. Give him a purpose again.”
“You file that report, and I’ll send proof of all of Michael’s secret offshore accounts to the IRS myself. You forget mother, that just because I’m not working for the family business doesn’t mean I don’t know all about the skeletons in our closets. Tax evasion, bribing, fraud. All our family’s dirty secrets out in the open for the whole world to see.”
They say how you start your year dictates how the rest of it is going to go. Dean had a rough start last year, but he thinks things turned out alright. Becoming a nanny certainly wasn’t part of the plan but, in hindsight, it might have been one of the best decisions Dean’s ever made. And not only because his boss’ friends all have expensive cars and are more than willing to try Dean’s services after Gabriel’s stellar reviews.
Dean’s ready to vibrate right out of his body. Pulling his lower lip between his teeth, he clasps his hands behind his back. Acting coy is not just part of their little game, but it certainly makes it more fun. “Do I get anything for my trouble? I did deliver you to your room without any ghost attacks.”
His assistants, Alfie and Indra, wait patiently by his side, darting to grab whatever Castiel needs from his dressing box without the need for many words. Just a gesture of Castiel’s head is enough for the boys to know what they have to fetch.
Distantly, Castiel knows Dean’s talking about his cousins. The truth is he doesn’t care much. Still breathless, skin tingling low at his back where Dean has his palm flat over it, he can barely think of anything else.
There’s no plan when Dean finally arrives at Ellen and Bobby’s. The sky above him is grey and heavy, the air chilly where it touches his exposed face over his scarf. They just might have a white Christmas this year, if the weatherman is to be trusted.
has betrayed him in the worst way. Castiel aches and burns, and wants the world to burn along with him. No. Not the world.
His words hit right on target. Dean flinches back, and it’s only because Castiel knows him so well that he can see he’s hurt him.
“No more deals, Dean,” she tells him, crossing the room to pour herself a glass of whiskey. “I’m sorry, but you know the new rules.”
Dean almost laughs hysterically at that. “Take it to the next level? Charlie, after everything, I’m pretty sure the guy is not into me. I’m pretty sure I make him uncomfortable.”
or one of Claire’s Marvel movies. Sure, Meg and Balthazar might also join them from time to time, but Castiel has made it his personal mission to
“Oh,” she said, snatching her hand back like she’d been burned. “I don’t get it. If you already have a familiar, what are you doing here?”
“Dean,” Cas acknowledges with a curious head tilt, a rare smile gracing his lips. “So, you’re not running away from me anymore.”
Dean doesn’t want to think about that. He just wants to enjoy the time he’s given with Jack and Claire while it lasts.
“So is Dean,” Charlie huffs, pouting. She is still holding onto him, her own sword pressed against his throat.
Sam shuffles over, lowering himself on the seat like he’s trying to hide himself from all the staring. He looks to Castiel, eyes wide, and Castiel gives him an encouraging smile. It’s not the first step to recovery, no, Castiel’s nose can still pick up the traces of opium hanging to his clothes, but it’s the promise of it.
"Oh that's right, I forgot." Michael squinted down at the endless piles of letters he had to answer, lists to check, menus to approve—and still he wouldn't let Castiel do anything. "I guess you're free for the day then."
“Look, the doctors still have a few things to tell us, but you don’t have to be here,” Sam says, his palm huge and awkward on Dean’s shoulder.
He didn’t mean it literally, but Castiel inhales. Holds it. Exhales. “This is more difficult than I thought,” he says. “I mean…” He gestures between them.
He hurries back inside Dean’s cabin, sheet discarded on the floor the moment the door is closed behind him. His clothes are thrown in every direction, but he shoves his legs in his pants, pulls the tunic over his head and forgoes boots completely. He’s still tying his breeches when he returns to the main deck. By then the pirates have gathered in a loose circle around their captain. Dean has stopped struggling, but he gives the evil eye to anyone close enough to him.
Meg Masters was a lot of stuff, but she wasn't one to procrastinate. Castiel appreciated that quality of hers, even if she usually found herself walking a very thin line between teasing and harassment. Mills had said Masters was like that with everyone and he shouldn't take it personally.
“Yeah. Yeah, I think you do,” Dean agrees. “But either way, I’m not looking for anything casual. It’s either all in, or nothing. So, I guess this is
If Castiel ever found a familiar of his own, he hoped he could meet them like Michael had met Dorothy and not in the Familiar Meetings most people attended when they turned twenty-one. Sitting at a table for five minutes with a person before moving to the next was hardly ideal for meeting someone he'd be bound with for the rest of his life, platonically or otherwise. Just because it'd worked for his friends so far didn't mean it'd work for him.
Castiel rows and rows, sweat beading on his forehead, skin blistering under the blazing heat of the fire all around him. He has no time to look where he is going apart from keeping an eye on the ships around him. Their boat falls head first on something solid and small. The crash makes the boat jerk, makes Castiel stumble and fall forward on Garth, his hold on the oar loosening. The oar slips from his hand and falls into the sea, but that’s the least of their problems.
Dean pauses, bloody jacket in hand. Castiel can feel the weight of his gaze. “They knew about this place? That you were hiding evidence of your work for the KGB here?”
Dean rubs the back of his neck. “I didn’t mean to pry,” he says. The only reason he’s said what he said back then was because Castiel wasn’t letting him finish a single sentence and Dean was getting annoyed. Now, It feels unfair he forced an unneeded opinion on Castiel when he never asked.
? he wants to scream. If he knew what all those fancy electro-fucking-something words meant he’d be a doctor himself, not a police detective.
“We’ll have to stop somewhere. I have to clean your wound, then see if it needs stitching, and you definitely need to lie down. Are you nauseous?”
Dean holds a hand up to cut him off. “Look, I said I get it. I don’t like it, but I do understand why you went into panic mode. That’s not why I’m upset.”
"Here's something that has been bothering me for a while now," Dean says. "If they knew you were ready to defect, why wait for the night we were about to transfer you to attack?"
“I’m sure he does,” Hannah said slowly, staring at him. There was something like uncertainty in her voice that Castiel didn’t like.
He’s breathing hard by the time he reaches the castle. The double oak doors are closed, and he doesn’t have the patience to be nice. He whips a spell at them, strong enough to make the old hinges protest as the doors are thrown open. A couple that was hiding in the narrow staircase by the doors yelp in surprise and scurry away. Dean doesn’t pay them any mind. He has more important stuff to do.
Meanwhile Castiel was still frozen in shock. That definitely hadn’t been his intention in coming here. It was the furthest thing from his intention. He took a deep breath, rolling his shoulders back. He needed to relax and find a way to fix this. The guards patrolling the city was one thing, Inias himself looking into this was another. Apart from Hannah, he was probably the only person who knew it’d been Castiel that had sent him away from his position. Once he started thinking about everything clearly, questions were soon to follow, and after questions the inevitable follow up was an investigation. Castiel had to prevent that. And like always, the way to control Inias was through Kevin.
Dean is not happy to admit Castiel is right, but he can't exactly refute his claims, either. He settles for a grunt that can be interpreted both ways.
Castiel sighs. “I’m sure it did.” He accepts the cup and peels Jack off his calf to go and have breakfast. Neither Naomi nor Claire join them, and a small part of him, one he’s ashamed to admit he has, is glad for this. He needs the peace and quiet.
Castiel jumps towards Garth, pushing him away as the head hits the bottom of the boat. It rises again, shaking but angry. Castiel prepares his sword, praying he’ll be fast enough to kill it.
A clear mistake, he realizes after he has opened the door and it’s too late to go back inside and cover himself.
Heat is creeping up Castiel’s neck. He tugs at the collar of his shirt, tries to loosen his bowtie but the damn thing won’t budge.
“Somebody fell in love,” Victor teases, and Ash jumps in to add, “Arthur falls in love in every port, what’s new?”
“I’m not your responsibility,” she tells her scrambled eggs, stabbing them with too much force, all feigned indifference and adolescent pride. “I don’t need a nanny. In case you haven’t noticed, I’m old enough to take care of myself.”
“Well, that’s very inconvenient,” Mick said, clearing his throat. “Because the Men of Letters sent soldiers up north to deal with both vampires and witches at the same time.”
“Word down the line is that Uriel’s busy only because you shit your pants every time a certain name is mentioned.” Meg cocks her head to the side in a ‘well?’ motion. She’s not in the least discreet about trying to get the gossip out of him.
It's the crazy instinct to forget all about this mess and run as far away from both the KGB and the CIA as he can. It's knowing that no matter how much he wishes for the opposite, he can't hold onto Dean for longer than the couple of days they have left together. Kisses before falling asleep are not something he can have. They are only a stolen moment and a well guarded secret at best.
“Maybe,” he says. He has the glass bottles right in front of him now, and on their reflection, he can see Anna moving slowly up to him. Perfect. “But I know that I won’t let Cas go down for something you did.”
Castiel eyes the car wearily. “I don’t actually know enough about cars to judge your progress. I think you’re doing alright,” he adds with a frown that doesn’t inspire Dean’s trust.
He unconsciously brings his hand to his jaw to check, feeling his five-o'clock shadow with his fingertips, and Dean’s eyes follow the motion. They linger on Castiel’s lips for a second too long.
He gulps it down greedily, though too fast, and he ends up choking before coughing half of it back out. Castiel pats him on the back, trying to keep his face from twisting with disgust as spit and drool still hang from Crowley’s chin.
“You know I can’t share any details with you, but yes, it’s a case. I think. I still haven’t been briefed myself. I thought I’d call you first and let you know I’ll be working late and won’t make it for our lunch.”
Charlie tries to grin around a mouthful, but ends up covering her mouth with her hand instead. “Why, thank you, young man. You’re very handsome yourself. Must be taking after your father.”
“Let me go.” Cas pulls away violently. His lips are trembling, but any trace of the affection he had when he used to look at Dean is gone.
“Stayed back to make sure the ship is secured. Should be here in a couple of hours.” Sam’s smile is soft and genuine, in a way Castiel has never seen on him before. “Did Jo come by?”
“What the fuck are you doing down there?” he asks, catching with the corner of his eye Castiel turning away and inhaling sharply.
“Resting.” Castiel checked on Bobby a few minutes ago. He found him sleeping, while Jo and Charlie sat on the other cot watching him.
“I don’t know anything about art,” Dean protests; Claire makes a snide remark under her breath and buries her snort into her palm when Dean kicks her for it. He turns to Castiel for help, only to find him considering him with his head tilted to the side.
When Castiel had first gone through the old surgeon’s stuff, he’d assumed all the aloe extract he’d found was for sunburns, but its actual use becomes apparent as more and more pirates come looking for him, and Singer sends the merchantman sailors his way as well.
“Hey, I was just about to get in the shower,” Dean said, the sound of his voice reminding Castiel of his cocky grin. “There’s only an hour left for our lunch, is that too long a wait for you?”
"Nothing," Castiel was quick to say. "I'm only trying to figure out how to work around a spell's limitation."
His lungs are burning, his eyes bulging out of their sockets, even as everything starts going dark around the edges.
Another sigh. “I am, but there’s nothing I can do about it. I’ll probably pull an all-nighter at the office today.” A pause. “Unless you want me to swing by and watch a movie together later.”
No, wait. That was Dean. Dean, who was raking his fingers through Castiel’s hair, his chest vibrating against Castiel’s skin as he whispered something into Castiel’s ear that made him laugh. It took all of Castiel’s strength to pull himself out of his blissed-out stupor and not fall asleep standing—well,
Castiel is far nicer (both to talk to and to look at). “Dean, you look very cheerful today,” he says, tilting his head in Dean’s direction with a curious smile. There’s some left-over awkwardness after their almost-something at Claire’s birthday but Cas seems determined to ignore it and so is Dean.
take your lovers’ quarrel elsewhere?” Meg’s voice interrupts them, loud and annoying (as ever) and confusingly, coming from the garden. Dean checks outside to see her lounging in a bikini and sunglasses right under the window.
Dean shrugs. Somehow he has produced his clay pipe, and he fills its bowl with tobacco  from a leather pouch that hangs from his sash. “Monsters are not as common as you might think,” he murmurs, pressing the tobacco with his finger, then adding more and pressing it down again. He puts the pipe to his mouth and takes a test draw, nodding satisfied. “We find a lot because we are specifically looking for them. Hell, they used to be less than rare back in the day. It’s only been in the last twenty years or so that monsters have become a real problem.”
He stares at his phone. He stares at it some more. A sense of foreboding settles heavy over him, opening a deep pit where his stomach should be.
written on it; that’s too specific to be for Dean. “I love blueberry muffins,” he confesses. “They are my favorite.”
“Talbot and Masters aren’t even back yet.” Banes pulled his coat on, quickly going through the usual pat-down for badge, gun, and wallet.
“I—I mean—it’ll be fun. It’ll be a good picture to keep for… the memories,” Castiel corrects himself, quickly. His face looks as red as Dean’s feels. Maybe Dean is not the only who has trouble sticking to the whole ‘just friends’ thing after all. Castiel taps two fingers against the papers on his desk. “Um, you have my permission. Is there…is there anything else I can help you with?”
“A purely professional relationship where he just so happens to wander into the garage every time you’re working on a car wearing nothing but a tight pair of jeans and a dirty undershirt?” Charlie cuts him off, head cocked to the side as if to say
. He knows, he knows, he knows. Castiel keeps up the act anyway. It’s the only way he knows how to pull through. “No one touches Winchester.”
Shrieking and screaming starts from inside the house, before the door bangs open and James and Amelia come spilling out, Michael at their heels.
“No, it’s not. You said yourself that people will come out when they’re ready, and I’m not ready. Υou can’t just push me to do it. Don’t be an asshole about this.”
“But you…you…your contract is for a year, and the year is not done,” Castiel stammers out. “You haven’t finished the Mustang, or paid off your loan.”
“Do it,” Sam said without hesitation. He faced away, checkinging the clock in the middle of the plaza for the time. “I’ll go back home and let Dad know. He should be able to send a message to the witches for them to prepare. I’ll meet you at the university stables at first light, okay?”
is somebody here—an artist, a quirky loner, a regular, a neighbor. He’s a grey man, a background character to everyone else’s life movie, and he’s content to stay like that. It’s much more attention than
“Yep, Jody Mills. She’s been searching for that poor girl for close to a month, now. Didn’t find much, not even after your brother showed up. Her friends insist she ran away.” She shrugs with a tight smile, like it’s common for people around here to run away every now and then.
Michael’s shoulders shagged with relief. “That’s a good boy,” he said. “Most of our normal schedule has been postponed, but you’re free to go back to your herbology studies if you want. Staying where guards can always keep an eye on you, of course.”
“What do we have here?” Castiel asked. Dropping to sit like Talbot, he squinted at the coroner, whose gloved fingers were moving all over the body. Mills and Banes had stayed outside, to talk with the police officers who had arrived after the wife’s distressed call and had secured the scene for them until they’d arrived, leaving him to work with Talbot, Masters, and their forensics team, who had already started work, laying out the paths that were safe for officers and agents to use without disturbing the scene.
“Time for the last game of the evening,” Kali calls, clapping her hands to get everyone’s attention. She gestures for them to take a seat. “I hope you’re having as much fun as we are. I know our games have been pretty exciting so far, especially for our two top teams.”
The day is lost to the whirlwind of work, as men climb up and down the hull of the ship inspecting her and patching up everything they can until Crowley's ship returns with what they need for the heavier damage. Crowley's surgeons take some weight off of Castiel's shoulders, helping him look after his men alongside theirs, and setting up a schedule so not all of them have to be down there the whole day. They give him time to rest and eat—if you can call resting and eating the few minutes of shuteye he gets while sitting by Sam's side around midday, and a plate of barely touched food going cold next to him.
“I can’t believe you two actually came!” Anna appears at their side, a glass of wine in her hand, most of it gone already. She looks less than impressed. “Didn’t either of you have to work?”
“Are you sure you don’t wanna come with us?” Jack asks. He has Felix wrapped around his neck like a scarf, and his tiny hands are fisted on the side of Dean’s jeans, holding on for dear life. “You can have my bed if you want. And if Dad doesn’t want to pay for your ticket I can hide you in my bag.”
“How many men are with you?” Castiel asks, knees bumping with Dean as the van takes a sharp turn and makes him lose his balance for a second.
He doesn’t want to go, but when he thinks of what Naomi is willing to put Castiel and the kids through just to get rid of him, his wishes seem tiny and insignificant in comparison. He imagines the strain the report will put on everyone. He thinks of Jack and Claire and how much they crave a normal life with their dad. He thinks of Castiel’s name dragged through the mud, his connections turning their back to him.
“Hey, I’m not saying you shouldn’t be.” Dean slips out of the bed and starts going through the piles of clothes on the floor for his underwear; Castiel’s gaze follows him and although it’s not uncomfortable, last night’s magic is gone. “I’m just saying I would have liked a heads-up before Bal saw me with my dick out.”
Dean beams at them, warmth washing over him. “I can see that, buddy. Sorry for interrupting. I’ll leave you two to it then.”
“Make a wish!” Balthazar tells him, bringing him closer to the pancake nougat tower Dean is holding so he can blow the candle sticking out of it.
Castiel stands across the street from the dark building, shoulders hunched against the chill of the night. His contact at the police station texted him the address a couple of hours earlier but unfortunately couldn’t get him inside. This time, he’ll have to do it on his own.
He’s started a war, and now he’s asking his men to step down. A foolish decision by all means. Just because Castiel is weak, doesn’t mean that Dean is, too. Or that John Winchester is.
a voice that sounded suspiciously like Charlie chanted in the back of his head, only for Dean to shoo it away because a) Cas would never accept an invitation from a guy he buys coffee from, and b) how was Dean supposed to explain Cas to Bobby and Sam?
“I don’t think I’m that adventurous,” Castiel says with a small smile, ducking his head as if they’re sharing a secret. “I think I’ll leave that to you.”
Dizzy with want, Dean tries to open his eyes. He knows he’s not supposed to be doing this, but looking up into Castiel’s eyes, the blue barely visible around his blown pupils, it’s hard to remember why. He hooks his ankles over Castiel’s calves and flips them, Castiel landing on his back with a surprised laugh that quickly turns into a moan when Dean licks a stripe up his hard, leaking cock.
Turning away, Naomi shakes her head. She has a hand on her hip, the other against her forehead, and takes a sharp breath. Chest heaving, Castiel watches as she processes everything he just said. When she straightens her back and turns to face him, she’s wearing a carefully crafted mask of neutrality.
The pirates try not to panic, but they can’t work fast enough, and they know that they are vastly outnumbered. Even one of those galleons carries more than twice the men the pirates have, and it’s not like when they attacked the
Clasping Castiel’s shoulder and squeezing, Dean gives him a fond smile. “Man, and Claire thinks you’re not a dog person.”
Rufus seems satisfied with her promise, and he spends the twenty minutes it takes the cab to arrive playing red hands with Jack calmly. They get him inside the car and give the driver strict instructions about where to take Rufus. That small crisis resolved, they watch the car drive away.
It’s getting dark by the time he makes it back home. His whole body is tingling with discomfort, and his stomach is so tight he’s tempted to empty all its contents on the side of the street.
“He’s innocent. You have to believe me. I apprehended the real culprit,” he says, gaze flickering to Anna’s limp body on the floor.
Maybe he can sneak into Castiel’s room later tonight. No one will notice if he’s quiet and makes sure everyone is asleep before he ventures out. It’s not even sex he’s after. He just wants some more time alone together. They could—
Jo looks over at Castiel, too quickly for him to read her expression but it’s easy to see the nervousness in the way she knits her fingers together tight. “We could… we could always have Charlie do it.”
“Did he shut you out? Didn’t even let you explain yourself?” Claire continues. She fixes him with a knowing stare. “Yeah, welcome to my world.”
“I don’t think your dad can fire you from being his daughter,” Dean says, crossing his arms over his chest. And also, Dean doubts Claire deserves that kind of behavior, whereas Dean… Well, that thought just makes everything worse.
A hand fists into his shirt and Castiel is jerked back. Some of the haziness clears, and he finds Dean staring at him with hard eyes. There’s a muscle vibrating under his jaw, and the hand holding Castiel at arm’s length is shaking. His other hand is curled into a fist in his lap, and Castiel can almost imagine the countdown to the moment Dean’s control snaps and he slams his fist right into Castiel’s nose.
He slides behind the wheel all the same, fingers running lightly over the leather. He could go for a drive, he guesses. Spend some much needed time with the windows rolled down, music loud enough to drown out any other noise. On instinct, he opens the glove compartment to go through his collection of tapes, trying to decide which one fits his mood.
“I don’t have a familiar,” Castiel said, shaking his head in confusion. He should have been able to draw from her without problem. He certainly had no problem drawing from Dean when they tried together.
“Meg,” Castiel repeated. The name felt weird on his tongue. It’d take him a while to get used to this change.
It’s not a question, but Dean shakes his head in answer all the same. “Nah. Not yet. Haven’t met the right person I guess.” Daring to meet Castiel’s gaze again, he gives a half-shrug. “Not everyone is as lucky as you to meet their other half young.”
“If our guests are causing trouble you should let us know. We expect them to show our servants the same respect we show you.”
“Honestly, I think I’d be buried in work most of the time,” Castiel says, his expression darkening. “I work a lot, don’t I? I should be spending more time with them.”
The phone opens with a simple swipe, but it’s not Dean’s conversation with Benny that Castiel sees. It’s his conversation with Charlie.
“Actually can we talk in private?” Castiel asks, shifting his weight from one foot to the other—is the guy
Since no one is that hungry they settle on popcorn. Jack falls asleep tucked against Castiel’s side ten minutes into the movie, and Claire nods off soon after sprawled on the other couch. Dean just turns the volume down and settles more heavily against Castiel’s other side, an arm around his shoulders. Castiel tilts his head back and gives him a sweet kiss to the cheek.
Castiel returned the handshake, trying his best to be pleasant and polite. It wasn’t anyone’s fault he had other things to worry about. He was here, the least he could do was to put in minimal effort.
“And are you? Having fun?” Castiel asks, the barest hint of hesitation in the slight crack of his voice.
It’s not exactly a lie. John hasn’t thrown any major tantrums since Thanksgiving when Bobby was staying with him, and even back then, it only took thirty minutes of talking on the phone to calm him down, promise him that no, Dean didn’t hate him and he wasn’t spending the holidays elsewhere because he was tired of him, and then convince him to stop acting like a brat—Bobby’s words, not his—and eat something.
Firm hands grabbed him as he stumbled forward into Dean’s chest. Castiel could feel Dean’s body vibrating with a chuckle where they were pressed chest-to-chest.
Dean sees his opportunity and takes it. “Cross my heart and hope to die, I was only doing what Bal told me to.” When there’s no answer to that, he knows he’s already won this argument. “And Bal was supposed to wait for you here and yet he and the kids are already at the airport, so maybe, call your butler and figure out where you two got things so mixed up.”
Away from Cas’ comforting body heat, the night breeze raised goosebumps on Dean’s naked skin. Swallowing past his dry throat, Dean shook his head. “I’m sorry. I’ll… I’ll  just go.”
And being worried about Inias was also the perfect excuse to leave his room again. Of course he really was planning on visiting his friend, and hopefully Inias wouldn’t be too mad at him, but it was also a nice alibi if they caught him sneaking around.
Fingers closing around his keys, he pushed himself up, before moving to unlock his door, only for it to open without the key turning. It was unlocked.
His mind goes kind of blank at that particular mental image, and by the time he pulls his wits back together to firmly, once-and-for-all explain he’s a mechanic, not a nanny, so can someone please show him the car he came to see, the doorbell snatches that opportunity right out of his hands.
“Uh, I wouldn’t call it adjusting.” Castiel winced. He wanted to plead Inias’ case, he really did, but this wasn’t the best moment. “He’s doing as well as you would expect.”
“Why don’t you ask the others?” Castiel suggested, offering Dean a solution that would at least not put Castiel in an uncomfortable spot. “They were your friends, last time I checked, not just colleagues.”
“We’re worried about you, Dean.” She chews on her lip, visibly choosing her next words carefully. “Ever since that shipwreck, you’ve been different.”
Dean nods his head. “Won't answer his phone. We drove all the way out here and we still haven't found him. I talked with the guy at his motel, but he wouldn't even tell me which one his room is. I get the feeling he hasn't seen Sam in a while, either. You were working with him, weren't you? When was the last time
Mr. Wilson’s front door closes, and Castiel’s smile slips off his face. The worst part of his job—his real job, not the painting he took up as a hobby and which now serves as his cover—is talking with idiots like Mr. Wilson.
Dean smirks, eyebrow raised, before he crawls lower on the bed, leaving behind a path of kisses and bite marks on Castiel's chest.
Without saying a word, Jack stands up and disappears into the bedroom, leaving Dean to blink after him.
Castiel takes that in, inspecting his surroundings. No cameras that he can see, but it might be worth asking, anyway. There aren't a lot of cars in the parking lot, just five more other than Castiel's Corolla and Dean's Impala, so about a third of the rooms must be occupied. Would any of them have seen anything?
“I only left him for five minutes,” Castiel answers, dealing the finishing blow to the pirate lunging for him. Dean side steps, a sword sliding down where he stood just seconds ago, before turning around and slitting the man’s throat.
And so Castiel surges forward, kisses Dean hard enough that Dean has to push himself back a bit. It’s fast and painful, lips against lips in a bruising embrace, and Castiel takes it, breathes Dean in like it’s the last time. For all he knows it might be.
"Don't you dare, now," she says, shaking a warning finger at his direction. "It's the least I could do after my pie failed you. You just make sure to take those buns to Jody, okay?"
Dean realizes that no one’s gonna jump in and explain. Clearing his throat, he transfers the blankets under his armpit as best as he can and steps up to hold out his hand. “I’m Dean Winchester. I’m the nanny.”
Dean slumped back in his seat. “I don’t know. Working with Benny was easy for some reason. And Novak…”
“But that’s exactly what I—” Sam tried to say again, only for one of their soldiers  to interrupt him by rushing through the door.
Inside the training area, Claire meets the blow of her opponent with the flat side of her blade. She digs her heels in, lowers her weight for a second, and with a battlecry that makes Dean a little proud of her, throws the guy back. The fight is heating up, the blows coming faster from both sides now, and yeah, maybe Dean’s a little biased here, but Claire is better. Faster. Relentless. Every one of her hits force her opponent another step back. Every time she swings her sword, the shield meeting it is a little slower to respond.
His eyes sting with tears, despite all his promises. Cas wouldn't even look at him. Those first few moments, when Cas had stopped in front of his car only to keep running towards his door, running away from Dean, are like a knife through the ribs. He’d hoped… He’d hoped time would have softened the pain. That maybe Cas would be at least ready to listen to him. Instead, Cas didn’t even want to see him. No one to blame but Dean for that.
board in front of him is that this is probably the last time they’ll do this. There’s no doubt in his mind that Naomi doesn’t just want him to quit. She wants him out of the Novaks’ lives. Permanently.
The familiar adrenaline rush that Dean used to get every time Sam dared him to do something when they were kids rushes through him, and the next thing he knows, he’s throwing the door open with enough force to make Castiel jump a little.
Dean lets it flutter to the ground and steps back so there’s a more appropriate distance between them.
“Yep! And Felix was there, too, and Bal let me take him with us everywhere,” Jack declares, cheeks flushed from the excitement. Dean can already predict there’ll be a long recounting of this trip with all the details a three-year old deems important to remember, like what the best flavor of ice cream he tried was.
Someone’s trying to break down the door, and Dean knows he has to do something, he has to stop him, has to stop him—w
“That I’m here to talk about the kids?” Dean raises his eyebrows. He didn’t expect Castiel to be this intimidated by his mother. Or be that worried about
Castiel’s boots go first. Then Dean tugs at his breeches, guiding him to lift his hips so he can slide the pants off, before completely removing them and tossing them aside. Castiel's erection stands red and aching between them.
When Dean fakes an overhead attack, Castiel falls for it. He holds his sword vertically, ready to parry, but Dean shifts his weight, moves to the side and in a single fluid motion that draws all of Castiel’s attention to the flex of his bicep, he brings his sword down on Castiel’s foremost leg.
Castiel watched the bat flying through the low bushes under his window before grabbing a book from his nightstand and muttering a quick summoning spell that brought his broom from the storage room on the lower terrace where all brooms were kept in. Dean was the only one with wings, but Cas could fly, too.
“Stop thinking about Dad,” Sam explodes, throwing his arms in the air. His voice is sharp when he says, “Just because
The Dementor yowls in pain, letting go of his grip on Cas, who collapses to the floor. As the Dementor floats away, Dean runs for Cas. Someone grabs his arm, trying to stop him, and he shakes them off. He falls to his knees next to Cas, cradling his face.
After the news of Inias losing his job, he’d tried seeing his friend, but Kevin had shrugged and said Inias wasn’t feeling up to it. Hannah, on the other hand, was a wild card. She hadn’t confronted him yet about the whole mess of Dean escaping, but Castiel was nervous. He’d chosen her specifically because she’d be the one least likely to immediately rat him out, but that didn’t mean she wasn’t going to come to him with questions.
Mick bowed his head, hoping to appear as submissive as possible. “I only pointed out the obvious. A lot of jobs are dependent on the Winchesters and their fabric trade.”
Castiel fights viciously against his captor, eyes on Alfie, who gets kicked in the stomach as Beard steps above him. With a desperate twist that surely dislocates his shoulder, Castiel breaks free from Baggy Coat’s grip.
Warmth spreads through Dean, reaching the tips of his fingers and melting a little of the ice-cold that’s taken over his inside. “Anytime, kiddo.”
Uselessly holding up the leash, Dean nods. “It’s time for Miracle to pee.” He’s not pissed off anymore. He’s just tired and wary. If Castiel’s here to break it off between them he might as well do it now and put Dean out of his misery. A clean break has to be easier than getting his heart crushed piece by piece while Castiel bends over backwards to please his mother.
She scowls, and he shrugs. Storming out of a stranger’s garage is not exactly the mature thing to do.
Curled as he is against the door, he fishes his phone from his pocket. There’s a stir in the front of his pants, an insistent whining that he’d better get his ass back down to that office and finish what he started which is all kinds of terrifying. Before he can talk himself out of it, he calls Charlie.
“Oh, Bal. If only you were so confident in your ability to satisfy women, too,” she says. “When was the last time you went out on a date?”
His mind belatedly reminds him that Jack and Claire’s mother is dead, but it’s too late for Dean to take that back. It’s too late to do anything but drown in a downward spiral of panic and down his drink, liquid courage that tonight it’s probably in his best interest not to have.
door. “What if they didn’t?” he asks, mind spinning as it tries to catch up with all the new questions that spring up. Is it even possible? It could be, he supposes.
At the last moment, he plants his foot on the floor, instead of fighting the force he goes with it, uses the momentum to spin them around, hands going from the vampire’s back to his chest, pushing, slamming the vampire against that beam and right onto that rusty nail.
Azazel’s fleet hasn’t moved yet, but some of the ships have already started unravelling their sails, chasing the wind even as their anchors have yet to break the surface of the water. The smaller ships have all their guns on their sides, and as the
No, Dean is probably preparing for retaliation already. He thinks he’s the number one target out there. He’s smart, though, and skilled. He’ll know to keep his head low, fortify his defenses, increase the number of guards shadowing him at all times. Will probably do the same for his brother and father.
Cheering, Jo keeps the fire burning in front of them, as the other three push their muscles to their limits and row faster and faster. Unlike the larger ships that can only fire from their sides, the fireguns on the jollyboats are fastened on a flexible joint that lets Jo direct the flame at whichever direction she wants. They don’t need to outrun the ships by much, only get close enough to start their attack.
“Puppies!” Claire gasps, falling to her knees to let the puppies sniff and lick her fingers. Tiny paws try to climb up on her lap, but there’s too much excitement in their too small bodies, and all of them roll to the ground to whine their protests at the obstacle that keeps them away from all the cuddling they deserve.
After a moment of hesitation, Dean takes the seat behind the wheel and starts the car. He pulls out of the parking lot and navigates through the streets with ease. They don't speak, the air heavy between them with everything they haven’t said and neither wants to think about. Castiel chooses to concentrate on his coffee while munching on one of the muffins. They are good, and Dean was right. He
“The table looks perfect to me,” Michael says, though he does cross to them, hands in his pockets. “Cassie, you even got Dad’s fancy tablecloth.”
Dean grabbed the edge of the pocket with his small paws, pulling himself up, until he could stretch his wings and fly. He flew in wide circles above Castiel’s head, before slowly turning and coming back. Shifting back to his human form, he landed right in front of him.
Castiel jerks away, busying himself by throwing the bloody towel in a water basin he found in the bathroom to hide the way his face heats up. He doesn’t need the way Dean makes him feel, nervous and out of control. It’s dangerous, and a metaphorical spit on Inias’ grave, and worst of all, inevitably out of reach. Dean’s not… Dean’s not like
“Well, Thomas and I had breakfast together like every morning, then I had an appointment at the salon to get my roots done. After that I spent a few hours with my sister, went shopping for a gift—my daughter’s friend just had a baby, you know—and then...then I went back home and I—I found Thomas—you saw how he was. What kind of monster would do something like that?” she sobbed, burying her face in her hands. A new wave of tears ran down her cheeks, this time unstoppable.
Unsure of the etiquette in this instance, Dean opts to leave the door open in case Balthazar decides to come join them for—fuck, what the hell is Claire doing here? It’s not like she can just drop by for a coffee. Not because Dean doesn’t want her to, but because if Naomi finds out…
“Of course. Here, Jack. You play with Mr. Winchester now,” Mr. Novak says, pushing the three-year old into Dean’s arms, despite all the protests that are bubbling up Dean’s throat in the confused, and very elaborate form of
"We'll never make it," Charlie says, her face a mirror of the desperation on Garth's and Castiel's faces.
He barely has enough time to recover, or even feel the bite of the cold water as it rains on him and seeps under his clothes. He rows with all his might, Charlie keeping time for him and Garth, a relentless
But, just to be sure, he locks the door and turns on the security system. He is going down to the garage once he’s finished with his sandwich, so he might as well make sure everything is secure while he’s distracted. He doesn’t know what valuables there are inside the house, but he’s not going to find out by reading a list of everything stolen after a break in.
Dean holds the gun out for Castiel to take it back and put it in its holster, hidden under his jacket. He holds a finger up to his lips, as if his next words cause great pain to him. “The only reason I’m letting you go is that you’re going to fix this.”
"Yeah, keep complaining, old man," he yells over the heads of the people around them. Then, noticing the slight blush on Castiel's cheeks, he adds, "Don't mind him, he's only joking."
“That’s not really helping me right now. I mean, what am I supposed to do? Even if I stop messing around with him, it’s not like I can turn off my feelings.”
Tonight, like most nights, if he’s being honest, he’s staying over at Castiel’s house. At Jack’s insistence this time, though.
The two of them used to be a good team and had worked on plenty of cases together, though only that first one became a book. It’s why Dean came to find him after all this time, Castiel is sure.
He doesn’t remember falling asleep. He never does these days. Though he avoids sleep and the dark as much as possible, tries to fight down the claws of panic that sneak under his ribs to squeeze his lungs painfully, he’s too tired. Sleep sneaks up on him most days. Most days he wakes up cold and terrified and hollow and wondering if he’s still curled against the wall down in the basement.
“I don’t know, but I’m going to find out,” John promised. A beat. “My knife is missing,” he added as an afterthought.
Eyes narrowing, Jo pushes off the desk and into Gordon’s personal space. She looks threatening enough that even Castiel is tempted to take a step back. He can’t imagine how intimidated Gordon feels right now.
“You’re bleeding,” Castiel points out, sighing. “Again.” He feels newfound respect grow inside him for Dean, along with curiosity, but it’s not the time for questions yet.
"Alright, guys. You know the drill, go for the usual stuff." Dean stands with his hands behind his back, sweat slowly forming against his temple, gold buttons shining under the sun.
Castiel grabbed his trench coat and threw it over the crook of his elbow. He'd have time to put it on in the elevator. "Not a date!"
Warning for an amputation scene in this chapter. It's right after Castiel kicks Dean out of the captain's quarters.
“I’d never do anything to hurt Dean,” Castiel said firmly. He gave Dean’s fingers a gentle squeeze. “I know that the history between us makes this a little hard to stomach, but if you give me a chance, I’ll prove to you that I’m worthy of your trust.” He turned to smile at Dean, his face softening so much that Dean melted a little inside. Under the light of the tracing spell, his eyes sparkled like a starlit sky. “And of your son.”
The Mustang is hidden under a cover, waiting for him to find the time to clean her properly which he doesn’t feel like doing today, so he heads for the Impala instead. He regrets being so good about her maintenance, because now that he needs something to keep his hands busy there’s nothing for him to do.
The wind slams rain and sea water in Dean’s face, momentarily blinding him, but he presses forward through the night. The roar of the battle vibrates up his spine.
Jack furrows his brow, tongue sticking out of the corner of his mouth just like Castiel’s does when he’s concentrating on something—Dean thinks he might have a heart attack at this point with how cute Jack is—before blowing the candle out.
’ like the middle-schooler he still is at heart. “I’m tired of watching you mope around my living room. And she’s right, you know. So man up and tell us all the truth, or I
“I, I see,” Dean says at a loss for words. The kid must be very lonely if his only friends are his butler and a fake snake, which, that’s
“Because,” Dean says. “He has enough stuff to worry about already. He doesn’t need to worry about Dad, too.”
“Dean,” Castiel acknowledges, dropping the papers he was reading to give Dean his whole attention and a gorgeous smile.
The road stretches out ahead of them, long and endless, and Castiel is already itching to get out of the car. He can’t look at Dean. He
That last part becomes even more evident when Dean drags himself downstairs—after Claire threatens to barge into his room and drag him out herself—to find Castiel in a three piece suit that looks expensive enough to cover Dean’s grocery bill for two months and clings deliciously in all the right places. His hair is slicked back—with gel? He never knew Castiel owned a comb let alone hair gel—so that not even a hair is out of place.
Dean shivered. “Uh, the tomato sauce needs to simmer for five minutes or so on low—Jesus Christ, Cas!”
Dean woke up shivering. For a heart-stopping moment, he didn’t know where he was. Then his eyes focused on the shape of his dresser, the shadow his bedroom door cast against his wall, and he slumped back against the mattress, inhaling roughly.
Castiel knocks on Dean’s door—his daily reports go to him now that Singer has taken more of Dean’s duties around the ship to let him recover, and so Dean has to deal with all the paperwork instead. A tragedy, according to Dean, who told Castiel once he’d rather clean the entire hull of the ship in the middle of a storm than have to stare at papers all day. Castiel had, of course, rolled his eyes. The only paperwork Singer and Dean ever have to deal with are his own reports. Some habits are just hard to break, even if it’s been almost two months now since he first met the pirates.
Dean has to check behind his back to make sure Castiel is really speaking to him. Yep, just him in the room.
“Oh, you guys celebrating with Cas’ family this year?” Ash asks, still nursing his last beer—to keep Bobby company, supposedly, though Bobby stopped drinking hours ago.
“No.” The answer is immediate and non-negotiable. He may be a prisoner, but Castiel is not a criminal, and they can’t force him to become one.
Dean catches the pillow mid-air and drops it on the bed. He turns his most annoying smirk on. “You’re so easy to tease.”
“Look at that,” Meg says, strolling closer in her tight pencil skirt and too high stiletto heels. “The lumberjack is actually a good nanny, who would have guessed?”
Castiel retrieves the gun from his waistband. “This one and two magazines I slipped into my pocket before dragging you out.” He gestures at the duffel bag on the bed. “Clothes and some cash, but it’s barely enough to cover a couple of nights here and something to eat.”
It’s just a crush, Castiel tells himself, even as relief washes through him, almost as strong as the longing to call Dean and hear his voice. To pretend they’re in bed together and talk about their day.
“I’ll have to agree with you.” Cas mirrors Dean’s gesture with his own bottle, a smile playing at his lips. “And once it’s official, Adler will owe us a big bonus and a week of vacation at the very least.”
When he tunes back into the conversation, Dean is introducing them. “I’m Dean Winchester, and this is…” He eyes Castiel unsurely. “My colleague, Castiel Novak.”
It took all his willpower to tear his eyes away from Cas’ pulse point and up to his face. Instead of finding fear or apprehension, like Dean had expected, all he saw was determination, and something warmer, softer, that he really didn’t have the headspace to decipher at the moment.
Bobby shook his head, mumbling how he wasn’t sure, and Sam’d had enough. There was too much he said she said, and he did that but that didn’t happen, and this was the time to act, not talk. “Actually, if anyone’s finally willing to listen to me,” he said, making every single set of eyes in the room turn to him, “the situation is fairly simple. We asked the Men of Letters for their help in defeating Grand—Samuel, but now they are demanding we give them all of our assets, including our stores, stock and houses, in exchange for not getting killed. And I have a plan to stop them. Actually, it was Dean’s plan,” he added, meeting his brother’s gaze just in time to catch his smile. “So, how about I explain that to you?”
On his sword he can see Dean’s reflection. He’s using the pendant as a makeshift mirror to attack the witch without looking at her, and has already managed to land a hit, judging from the blood running down her arm.
"We will," Jo insists, grabbing her from the shoulders and spinning her around, pushing her towards the others. "Grab the extra oars and help them."
Cold dread washed over him. But no. No, no, no, no. He wouldn’t let it get to him. He wasn’t useless, and he wasn’t a coward. He just needed to get back in the game. Yeah, everything would be totally fine. And he’d go have lunch with Cas tomorrow and he’d be fine. Fine. Dr. Roberts was wrong. Cas was wrong, too. Dean was a perfectly functional member of society. As a matter of fact, he was going to prove it. He was going out. Right that second. He was going to get himself a drink, and he was going to talk to people, and he was going to be fine. Period.
“Hey! Sorry, I didn’t mean to interrupt. I saw the lights on and thought I’d check on Jack,” Dean says. “I didn’t hear you guys come back.”
“Yeah, Jack’s with me,” Dean says, not really willing to reveal he’s the nanny. That will only bring about more questions he’s not in the mood to answer.
Castiel exhales, shoulders shagging, like a heavy weight’s been lifted off him. “Good. Good. I don’t have much experience with dates, so it’s hard to tell.”
Dean kept his eyes on Castiel even as he shrugged out of his leather jacket. A shame, because Dean looked really good in his leather jacket. It accentuated the breadth of his shoulders so well, Castiel sometimes had trouble stringing a single coherent thought together while staring at Dean in it. Kinda like he was doing now.
“Take one of us,” Claire asks, holding the puppy against her chest, and Dean takes about twenty pictures from all angles. He even sends the photos to her, though he’s planning on saving each and every one of them like the proud mother hen he is. He can’t help it if that’s the softest and gentlest Claire has ever looked since he met her.
Dean watches him as Castiel shoves his phone back into his pocket. “What did he say?” he asks, already bracing himself for a dressdown.
Putting on his best concerned face, Castiel walked hurriedly towards her. “Hannah, have you seen Inias?”
Castiel is worth it. If he needs a little time to figure some stuff out, Dean will give it to him. Just the reassurance that Castiel is here now, here with him, here to apologize because he knows he hurt Dean, is enough for now. Dean can hold onto that.
themselves, are the far superior class of familiars, because they have direct control over the spell. Now the fae have a long history of living in isolation, far away from all others, so, of course, witches turned to the second best choice—vampires.
Tracking down Gabriel and Kali and hugging them goodbye is the easy part. Even Dean manages to do it, patting Gabe on the back and wishing him the best time on his honeymoon. No one has the heart to remind him that the honeymoon won’t be for another year since they’re too close to Kali’s due date—it’s only three weeks away now.
Checking his watch first—he still has another three hours before Cas arrives—he heads to the front desk. The wallpaper is old but clean, and the biting, synthetic scent of lemon fills his nose as soon as he walks in; a mop and bucket standing against a wall must be the culprit. It's not like the motels Dean's used to hanging around, meaning it doesn't look like it can turn into a crime scene at the drop of a hat.
“Um, I’m glad you’re going after your dreams, Dean I really am,” Sam says, passing the newspaper back.
“It’s okay. It’s okay,” Dean murmurs against Castiel’s temple as he pulls him close and wraps him in a tight hug. “It’s okay, I'm here.”
Sam looks like he’s going to say something else, but then he closes his mouth and nods. “Right. No, you’re right. It’s Christmas, we shouldn’t fight.”
No. Dean won’t go there. He has a date. With Lisa. That’s all that matters today. He can’t stop the smile spreading on his face, and it stays there even when he takes Miracle back inside.
“I won’t say it’s not convenient for me,” Cas said, finally stepping inside, letting the door close behind him and shutting the cold out. “I was prepared to drive around looking for somewhere to get Naomi’s coffee.
“What in the bloody hell do you think you’re doing, Winchester?” McLeod roars. She’s standing above him when Dean blinks his eyes open, her face distorted with rage. The last of the students runs out behind her, and Singer closes the door.
"I meant what I said," Dean says. "About you… I do..." he trails off, the words stuck in the air between them now that the heat of the moment doesn’t force them out of him.
Dean takes a moment to let that sink in. John will live. He didn’t kill him. Okay then. Okay. Dean can work with this. He slips his hand out of Cas’ hold, already feeling the loss, and stands up. He can’t let himself be coddled right now. The hard part has only started.
“I am, your Highness.” Hannah straightened up, quickly glancing in Castiel’s direction. “That’s why I’m here, it’s time for us to head out. Today’s matches will begin in less than half an hour.”
Castiel emerges from his hiding spot to join Dean above the second man, who is struggling away from them. His gun is on the ground a few feet away, and he twists to reach for it, only for Dean to kick it away.
By the time he’s finished with his shower and dressed, the sun is steadily climbing up the sky, its rays chasing away the last of the night chill. His suit jacket will be too warm to keep on in a few hours, but for now it’ll do. Castiel steps out, a bottle of milk in his hand, and watches as Santa Fe groggily wakes up.
“We can,” Dean said, mind racing and yet coming to a screeching halt at every single word that came out of his mouth. “I can cook us dinner at my place. I had this whole thing planned and all the ingredients bought. It’d be a shame to let them go to waste now my family isn't coming anymore.”
"Because you abducted me," Castiel cuts in, but there's no heat behind his words anymore. He's forgiven Dean for all that already.
“Yeah, I got it,” Dean cuts him off. “Gimme a minute. It’d be rude to throw her out on Christmas Eve, but maybe I can distract her by asking her to help me finish the pie. That should appease Ellen.”
The entire room holds its breath. Balthazar looks like he’s about to pass out, which is a shade better than the green color Castiel’s face is turning.
Azazel's pirates bring their guns out, waiting for the moment they'll be close enough to aim. They curse and run up and down the ship, their antics as much to intimidate their enemies as to hype themselves for the battle.
Dean shoves off Castiel and fishes his phone out. He pulls up a picture of a man in a hospital bed, a respirator covering the lower part of his face.
Locking eyes with Castiel, Dean licked his way back up, lips stretching into a playful smirk that was begging for Castiel to wipe it off his face before closing around the head of his cock.
Turning his hand palm up, he threads their fingers together and locks eyes with Dean. “It’s worth it.”
Dean stares back at him, unable to speak. He can’t do anything but keep his hand on Cas and stare at him, mouth stubbornly closed, lest a stray word comes out of his mouth and makes this worse than it already is.
Dean imagined it couldn’t be easy for him. Not only did he have to deal with the disagreement of a small but loud part of his people that didn’t want anything to do with the witches, but his own father-in-law didn’t support him after coming all this way. Had Mary Winchester been sitting between John and Dean instead of Samuel, would things be different? Dean wanted to think they would. The few memories he had of his mother were filled with warmth and happiness. She’d been nothing like her father.
“We don’t talk about Dr. Sexy in this house,” Meg announces, strutting in on killer heels and a blood-red power suit. “Morning, everyone. Bal, coffee please. Black.”
speaking,” Dean tried. “It’s just a friend helping another friend, like cooking together before we go on a picnic.”
Because despite all the promises he made himself, he got attached. Worse, he fell for Dean. And the only way this can end for him is heartbreak.
“Because we miss Dean,” Jack declares, crossing his arms over Felix in a gesture that won’t take no for an answer.
“I think he has a right to be this time,” Castiel said with a grimace. “I’ll have to apologize to him again.”
Castiel doesn’t have the time to frown up at him because in one swift motion Dean pulls Castiel’s hand from around his neck, uses his grip to guide Castiel in an underarm turn that’s too fast for the gentle music and that sends Castiel away from Dean, their arms extended for a brief second. If Castiel had even a drop of dancing talent in him, or even if he’d had the slightest warning, he might have the time to pose at this beat, like Dean does, his free hand thrown behind his head, but he doesn’t. He barely keeps his balance before Dean pulls him back in, sneaks an arm around his back and dips him.
Charlie whistled, impressed as she, too, came closer to inspect the glowing stream of magic. “It’s the only natural bond we’ve ever seen.”
“The swords are fake, Mr. Novak,” Charlie says, giving him a small salute. “Will you be joining us? I think I have a prince’s costume that will fit you.”
Dean is not going to lose it. He’s not. He keeps telling himself that, even as he drives in increasingly bigger circles around the neighborhood. They are going to find him. For fuck’s sake, he’s a sick man who needs a walker to get from the kitchen to the living room, where could he have gone?
the irony) to heart. It’s only now that Dean realizes how much Castiel had been holding himself back before. Not in ogling Dean, no, that has ceased entirely, but in spending time with Dean and the kids.
Sirens rise in the distance, the yelling behind him is abruptly cut off, and Castiel relaxes, knowing that the men after him won’t risk the police catching them.
Castiel’s stomach twists uncomfortably. “I think you’re overreacting. I’m not nearly as brave and noble as you make me sound. Besides, shutting down Project Y will leave your country defenseless.”
“And good morning to you, too, Claire,” Dean says, putting deliberate emphasis on his good manners. Who knows, maybe she’ll get the message.
“Sam! There you are.” His cousin, Christian, came pushing through the crowd, still in his sleeping clothes. It seemed like a lot of people had dropped whatever they’d been doing to come here. It was weird how Sam was the last to realize something was wrong, but maybe sending someone to fetch him from his classes would have looked suspicious.
“Dad has more important things to take care of than disciplining me right now, but I need your help,” Dean said, not missing a beat, and he dropped to sit cross legged across from them. “Cas followed us here, and Dad found him. He has him locked in a room now because he thinks he put some kind of spell on me.”
“Sure, you can take her home today if you want,” Garth says. “They’re nine weeks old so it’s the perfect time to find a family of their own, and I can give you enough food and pads for a couple of days until you can buy your own supplies. I’ve already had a vet over to check them all, but you might want to find someone close to your home, too.”
Dean's mouth twists in a pained grimace, but he lets Castiel come closer, keeps his ground when there are only inches of air between them. The faint, flickering light of the candle on his desk dances in his eyes, brings out the gold in the green.
“Oh, that wasn’t cancelled? Well, good luck then, I guess. I hope you meet the lucky one this year.”
John stirs, something shining with recognition behind his foggy eyes. “Dean,” he croaks. “I found you. I knew I could find you. Did ya tell her? Ya have to tell her.”
He’s already checked on them before dawn, making sure the loblolly boys brought down breakfast and water for the sick and injured, but now that he’s had some food in him, too, he wants to do a more thorough examination.
Words are slow to come to Castiel. He has no idea where he is, other than aboard a strange ship. From the bright stars that shed their muted light inside the cabin through the stern windows, Castiel guesses he’s been clocked out for a few hours at least. By now there’s no chance of rescue coming to look for him.
“You were passed out when we were running for our lives,” he points out. “The cat’s a ‘she’.” He pauses for a moment. “Her name’s Meg.”
Anything that is not useful in the battle is moved out as well, and Castiel packs his notes and what little progress he’s made with his manuscript and adds it to the crates the pirates carry back to the tavern or their houses for safe keeping.
It’s just like Castiel’s luck that the captain of the pirate ship that abducted him tried to kill him last night.
“They have Dean, Bobby,” John snapped, fangs bared. “It’s easy for you to be calm when you don’t have a son for them to abduct.”
“I can find you some nougat,” Castiel promises, the stern lines around his mouth softening. “But then you and Dean will have to go home. Is that okay?”
But there’s another part inside him, the one that still hurts from the wounds that have yet to stop bleeding, that stirs just at the sight of Dean. It yearns for him just as strongly as it yearns for answers. And it makes Castiel furious. He shouldn’t be feeling that. He doesn’t want Dean to look at him and see how weak he is. He wants to show him he’s moved on.
“I wish everyone thought like you,” Castiel said, warmth spreading inside him, both from Dean’s words and from where they were touching shoulder to elbow.
The dog sniffs at him carefully, still unsure of the newcomers. Or maybe she’s just not used to being around so many people. Whatever the reason, bribing her with more nuggets does the trick. She licks Castiel’s closed fist, trying to get to the food hidden in there, and doesn’t even flinch when Castiel scratches behind her ear.
is is left unexplained, "—and as long as you don't do anything out of the ordinary, the Soviets will have no reason to suspect you."
“No. I’m here because of the shipment,” Castiel says. The bartender leaves a glass of whiskey in front of him—no ice, just like he drinks it. “I guess you expect me to thank you? About Daniel.”
Castiel snaps his head around, so blindsided by that question that he forgets he’s not supposed to be looking at Dean. Of all the things he expected to hear, this never made it on the list.
John eyed the hand that was offered suspiciously, then took it and pumped it twice. Dean could see the veins in his father’s hand straining with effort, but the witch didn’t even flinch into what was probably a grip tight enough to crush his bones.
said, that I was, like, not cool just because I didn’t want to hold her hair back while she was puking or whatever. Like it’s my fault that she got herself drunk—”
"Pretend we're going to get drinks until they lose us in the crowd, then we get the hell out of here. Hurry, before they realize we hustled them."
It takes longer than usual to prepare the ship for departure, but it looks like even Singer has decided to take it easy today. He lets the men get away with procrastinating and only curses at them once, when someone almost slips and falls off the crow's nest.
Naomi’s eyes fall to his waiting hand. She ignores it. Sticking her chin out, she nods her head in the direction of Bobby and Rufus. “And are those the new gardeners? If so, then maybe you should hire new ones, Castiel. I saw a hedge that was horribly trimmed on my way up.”
Castiel bites his tongue, lest he says anything that will give him and Dean away. Thankfully, Kali appears at that moment to greet Dean and tell them all about her last ultrasound—pictures included.
“Well, fuck me, Cas, but it sounds like you’re starving,” Dean said, gently moving Castiel’s arm away from his face. The light was too bright, almost blinding, but not as bright as Dean’s teasing grin. “Did you have anything after our lunch?”
He dropped back against his seat, a hand over his swollen belly. “That was delicious. My compliments to the chef.”
Sam’s eyes flick to the top of the staircase where Castiel disappeared a few minutes ago, but doesn’t comment. He settles back in his armchair and, thankfully, they go back to watching Iron Man kick some ass.
The name John Winchester is written on the top of the page with the names of the pirate crew. It’s not a coincidence that Castiel had thought Singer was the captain at first, but if John Winchester used to be the captain, then maybe his son would have been elected after his death. The family business, indeed.
“What if he hates it there?” Castiel argues. “What if he misses being home with us? What if he doesn’t like the kids there? What if the kids don’t like him?”
Castiel can’t see anything except for ghostly faces and pale hands, eyeballs hanging out of their sockets and ribs poking out of rotting flesh, and still he pushes through, swinging at anything that he can see, whether his hits land or not. More men are going down around him, and Dean can’t load his gun fast enough anymore.
Castiel feels like half of his brain has gone numb, and with it, any control he had over this situation. Any plan he had just minutes ago is completely forgotten in the face of another catastrophe: Dean is leaving him after all. Him and Sam both.
He pushes himself up, rubs the sleep from his eyes. He feels like he’s been sleeping for days, and when he checks the clock on the nightstand between the beds, he realizes that it hasn’t been
“The hospital’s been working you pretty hard lately, huh?” Dean asks, accepting Castiel’s answer with a skeptical nod. “You should ask for some time off.”
Except Dean’s not intent on staying silent, too, this time around. “I get it, not everyone understands. People like… like
Dean is leaning against the door frame, head cocked to the side as he takes in the scene in front of him. His eyes linger on Castiel.
The vampire grabs his arm and throws him back with enough force that Dean lands almost on the other side of the barn.
Through the half-wall, he can see the outline of Castiel’s shoulders shaking as he laughs. “God, he’s an asshole isn’t he?”
“Bobby, now,” Dean shouts, gun already dropped and fighting with a crowbar now. He has his back to Castiel, shoulders bumping together every time one of them has to take a step back before lunging for the next sprite to come at them.
The next time Balthazar comes to check on him, Dean gets him to watch the kids for five minutes—“Come on, man, I haven’t even left to take a piss in two hours”—and slips into the kitchen.
“Fine,” Dylan says at long last, tapping his fingers against the desk, a steady beat that scatters through the room. “I thought you wouldn’t agree to my proposal, but it was worth a try anyway. So, you want protection in exchange for copies of the documents you’ve been sending back to Moscow, as well as a list of the scientists and their couriers that are involved in your spy ring? It seems reasonable enough. As a matter of fact—” he unfolds his arms, pushing away from the desk and gestures for Dean to come closer, “—that’s exactly why Mr. Winchester is here.”
Castiel has barricaded himself in his office. Ηe’s been doing little work, if the way he’s lying on the couch with a pillow covering his face when Dean finds him is any indication.
“This is useless,” McLeod declares as she finishes with the last section of wall on her side. “We should be in Azkaban saying our goodbyes.”
“Thirty-three,” Castiel declares and snatches the new glass Benny drops in front of him to hold it high above his head. “Thirty-three and single, and apparently the family’s black sheep.”
He pats Jack on the shoulder and pushes him towards the playground while he finds an empty bench to sit at. This whole thing is a little out of his comfort zone, he has to admit, especially when several women, mothers or nannies he has no idea, pretend not to look at him when it’s clear they’re all staring at him. Dean will soon be the new gossip around the neighborhood. Wonderful.
“You promised,” she snaps, crossing her arms over her chest. “You promised that you wouldn’t just disappear and that’s exactly what you did. You dropped us the moment you had a better offer.”
Dean is exhausted. Yet, as Cas slowly drifts off, his hold around Dean’s middle going slack, Dean stares into the darkness, heart thundering in his chest. Cold washes through him, and all he can do is lie there and think about all the ways he’s letting his wonderful boyfriend down.
“Please, mister, please,” Jack begs. He even turns up his puppy dog eyes. Dean’s heart swells with pride. “Daddy will be so happy.”
Castiel feels his face redden in response. He certainly hopes he makes Dean happy. Just as he hopes they make it out of the coming battle alive so they can still be together.
“So, we’re cool about the Impala,” Dean interrupts, just to make sure he’s not understanding anything wrong here, and Castiel nods, despite his tight mouth that makes his feelings on losing this argument very clear.
Sometimes he wishes she’d just pick someone to hire since she went through all the trouble to narrow down his choices anyway.
Dean retrieves the burgers he ordered and paid with his credit card online from where someone from the hotel staff has left them in front of his door, and returns back to the balcony.
“Now, Jack is not allowed to have cake before dinner no matter what he tells you,” Balthazar cuts him off
The greenhouses where Castiel worked were further down the hill, close to the woods, but he could see them when standing at the lower terrace and looking out at the estate. Witches and familiars were busy putting up spells and protective charms around the Blood Marigolds. From afar, they looked like bees in their hive.
Castiel stops in his tracks, a couple of steps lower than where Dean is, so that he has to tilt his head back more than normal to look at Dean.
“You dance like an old man,” Claire calls over Charlie’s wolf-whistling, making Castiel laugh. At least that means Dean’s saved from the lecture.
Ignoring the firm kick that lands against his calf under the table, Dean says, “So I show up here and everyone thinks I’m applying for the nanny job, so they just drop Jack in my arms and abandon me in a strange house.”
“Jack, where did you go?” He crosses to the kid in two long strides and crouches to pull him into a tight hug. At this moment, Dean almost believes in God.
Lips thinning, eyes burning, Dean shook his head.  There was something stuck in his throat, choking him, and he wouldn’t break down.
“I’m sorry, I shouldn’t have—this was a mistake,” Castiel says, turning his back to Dean and burying his face in his hands as his body folds over.
He has the honey jar in his hands and is ready to open it when there's a thunderous explosion, and the world shakes all around him for a horrifying moment. With a quick glance at Sam—still breathing, still out cold—and he rushes back to the main deck.
“For God’s sake, Mick. Have you lost your mind?” The door swung open to reveal the irritated face of one of the Elder’s servants. “Have you seen what time it is?”
“And you asked me to stay,” Dean says, drawing Castiel’s hand between his palms. When Castiel makes a move to turn his head and check their surroundings again, heart beating anxiously right under his throat, Dean cups his cheeks and pulls him back. “Hey, look at me. Cas.”
There are lips on his, a tongue pressing into his mouth. Dean tilts his entire body into the man above him, rocks his hips for any short of friction he can get, even as a small part of his brain keeps chanting:
Castiel demands, raising his leg in warning of what is to come if the man doesn't reply. Coming across KGB agents out here is unfortunate, but maybe they can spin this to their advantage. It depends on how much torturing the guy can get before he breaks. Hopefully not long enough for more agents to come looking for these two guys when they don't check in.
“No one’s getting drunk. Besides, I’ll stay in my bed, you’ll be in yours and as long as neither of us moves, we’re golden. Come on, we need to unwind a bit. How many opportunities to have fun do you think you’ll get once you’re dealing with courthouses and testimonies, huh?”
They set sail for Homestead, Captain’s orders. Singer’s mouth presses into a thin line when Dean makes the announcement, but he doesn’t argue.
Hair wild like he’d been running his fingers through it, Cas held up the open box Dean had given him, showing him Dean’s number written on the inside of the lid.
“Wanna tell me who pissed in your corn flakes?” she asks, leaning against the bedroom door, arms folded over her chest.
Dean shook his head, feeling tired and drowsy. The night was quiet outside the window—perks of living in a mansion in the middle of a gigantic plot of land, he guessed—the moonlight shedding its silver light over the lawn outside and into the room, stretching on the table between them.
“I’ll have you know that nothing happened to her. She’s in excellent condition, and I intend to return her home like that,” Castiel grumbles, though the way he rolls his eyes is nothing but fond. Dean can tell.
Dean looks up, and Naomi is standing at the top of the stairs. Arms crossed over her chest, she glares down at him. He doesn’t know how long she’s been there, or if she saw him and Castiel come back inside together, but the way her mouth twists with distaste is enough to make any thought of going to see Castiel tonight evaporate.
This is not paper for his notes, this is paper for a manuscript. Paper that will look beautiful once bound together with a leather cover.
Dean’s expression is hard to read, but Castiel can almost see a crack behind his carefully crafted mask of calmness. This is not an easy topic for Dean either. And though Castiel was an adult when he lost his mother and not a child, he kind of understands the pain of losing the one person who supported you from the moment you were born. “I’m sorry for your mom, too. It must have been hard.”
“Dean, Dean, look!” Charlie is not subtle in the way she pulls Dean further inside. “That’s Dr. Piccolo! She’s even prettier up close. Οh my God! How does my hair look?”
“We can call your uncles,” Castiel says, and by this point, Dean is pretty much fighting a losing battle.
“Dean,” Ed said, turning to him with his chest puffed out. “It’s very nice to meet you. Let me introduce myself. I’m Ed Zeddmore and this is my colleague, Harry Spangler. We are the Ghostfacers.”
A shadow looms under the merchantman, growing bigger and bigger and bigger, and the ringing grows impossibly louder with it. It’s loud enough that Castiel almost drops to his knees, hands covering his ears; but he can’t look away, and the shadows break through the surface in a colossal explosion of waves, and water, and
He collapses on his bed head first, boots and clothes still on. Lying there, face pressed into the mattress until he can’t breathe, he replays the entire night in his head, comes up with a dozen instances he could have come clean about him and Cas and convinces himself all over again that not telling them was the right choice. It seemed easier to avoid the subject then. Of course, when Ellen hugged him goodbye and told him she expects to see Cas tomorrow for the gift exchange, Dean, covered in cold sweat and unable to answer, hightailed it out of there.
Castiel resists the urge to roll his eyes. Like the good, dutiful surgeon he is—and he tries hard not to gag as he thinks that—he retrieves his dressbox before finding Dean and Singer on the bow, just in time to hear them give the order: “Run a shot across!”
Castiel grits his teeth. A smart comeback would be useful right now, but all he has is the copper taste of blood behind his teeth. He glares up at Uriel as best as he can.
A shiver slides down Dean’s spine. In an unfortunate attempt to get his nerves under control, he does what he does best. He turns this whole thing into a joke. “No corsage?”
It shouldn’t have been possible, he chanted in his head, taking the stairs up to the university library two at a time. Performing a spell together was a far cry from a bonding ceremony, and it
Castiel rolls the window down to accept the offered breakfast. He eyes the bag suspiciously. “Is that a ham and cheese?”
“I am.” It takes all of Dean’s strength just to stand with his back straight. His breath comes out in short, pained huffs. He waves Castiel away when he tries to come and apply pressure on his still bleeding wounds.
“Hey, don’t sell yourself short,” Dean says. He curls his hand into a fist with every intention of playfully smacking Castiel on the shoulder, but something goes wrong. Some synapse in his brain fires incorrectly, a false signal reaches his fingertips, and instead, Dean uncurls his fist and uses two fingers under Castiel’s jaw to turn his face back to him.
Whipping his head around, Castiel’s grip on the dressbox handle tightens. There’s only one oil lamp in the sick bay, sitting atop a crate Castiel uses as his desk. The light dances around the walls of the room, flickering weakly every now and then. Another whimper, and something moves among the sacks in the corner of the room.
“Hell yeah!” Jo throws her hands up and claps, her cheering loud enough to draw the attention of a few passers-by.
All of the fireflies were soaring between them now, scattering their golden glow against the freckles on Dean’s skin. Under that low light, his eyes were almost gold.
“I don’t care about the lying.” He winces. “Actually, that’s not true. I guess I’m here partly because you lied but also because you didn’t.”
“Thank God we brought lots of booze,” Jo says slyly, not in the least deterred by the fact that she’s carrying neither the cooler with the booze nor the suitcase she made Dean bring all the way out here. She just taps him lightly on the shoulder and tells him, “Put those in the cabin for me will ya?”
Charlie manages to block, face set with determination. Blades clink together, but her hold is not as firm. Jo easily pushes her back, uses her confidence to overpower the other girl.
As expected, Jack perks up at that. “I’ll be a big boy, so I can train Miracle like you and Claire,” he repeats, looking between Dean and his father for confirmation.
“It’s an awesome song,” he says, grinning awkwardly. “But I secretly always loved her version of Reflection from
Castiel drops his pencil, faces Sam full on. Jo’s words are clear in the back of his mind. “Why are you on this ship, Sam?”
They’re both fascinated by the same spot on the floor all of a sudden, though Dean does watch Dr. Sexy pass them by on his way to a buffet from the corner of his eye. There’s a freaking buffet! And Dr. Sexy is eating from it. Dean’s gonna eat sandwiches touched by Dr. Sexy.
To her credit, she does drop her gaze guiltily. At least she recognizes the error of her ways. Jack trails off, landing on the mattress and standing there to flick his gaze between them curiously.
Though Meg seems to consider this conversation over, Dean leans against the wall, watching the two of them for a moment. Then, “Did they find her? Claire I mean.”
“Meg, focus. I can’t go to the gallery opening alone. People will expect me to be charming and chatty, and we both know I can’t be that. You’re the mouth in this partnership.”
as your familiar? To make the radius of your spell larger and the illusion… thicker, or stronger, or whatever it is you need to do.”
“There’s nothing to let out,” Dean says through gritted teeth. Not that it was loud enough for Sam or Charlie to hear it, but it’s the thought that counts. His demeanor is enough to discourage them from any more questions, so at least Dean gets to pick his strawberries in peace.
“Relax. Sammy and Charlie will help me do all that first thing in the morning. All you have to do is show up in your suit and look hot.”
"So." Dean tips his head in Castiel's direction for the second time that day, rolling his shoulders back, annoying grin back on his face, if a little strained. "I guess I'll see you around."
She’s avoiding him for some reason. Dean would know, he’s become a master of avoiding people lately. And for good reason, judging by his little lapse in judgement in the kitchen. Sure, he and Castiel have always had this weird… energy between them, but this was just stomping right over any boundaries Dean had drawn. Like the idiot he is.
“He’s touchy,” Ash comments, the tip of his joint caught between his lips. If glaring could kill, Ash should drop dead anytime now, but Dean’s internal wishing is apparently not strong enough. It doesn’t stop him from trying, though.
“What’s this?” he whispered, unable to tear his eyes away. The glow was casting Castiel in golden hues and soft shadows, and he was breathtaking.
“This is too nice to be a serial killer’s hideout,” Claire says at last and steps out of the car, hands pushed into the pockets of her jacket. She calls over her shoulder, “You coming?”
Dean exhales loudly. “Thanks for staying, Cas.” The words surprise Castiel, and he chickens out. And maybe it’s for the best because Dean says, “Goodnight,” and promptly turns his back to Castiel.
“No offense, Cas, but you look a little blue. I’m surprised you haven’t returned to your warm bed yet,” Dean said, rubbing a hand behind his neck. He looked quite comfortable exposed to the chilly breeze. Vampires probably felt cold and warm differently than other species, just like they did with light.
The door breaks down, dark billowing through the room, and Dean’s alarm goes off. The light is still on over his head.
"Yeah. A small town a couple of hours out of Omaha. He came out here about a week ago. Said he needed to clear his mind after Jess—well, after, and he'd found a case or something."
Dean almost opens his mouth to ask why he’d want to call Lisa, when he remembers he’s supposed to be taking her out tonight. Right. Except there’s no help coming, and he won’t make it. That’s the reason he needed Sam and Charlie to dog-sit in the first place. “Yeah. I better call her. I’ll—I’ll—yeah.”
Castiel leafed through the papers to check the interview notes Masters had written for them from when she’d spoken with the wife at the crime scene.
“Goodnight,” Dean echoes. He gives Meg and Balthazar a forced smile, though by the way they’re staring at him, he’s not very convincing. “And a goodnight to you, too, guys.”
Dean’s hand falls to his side. Adrenaline is still rushing through him, but the surprise at seeing her, makes him paues. “How did you get here?”
Castiel groaned, knees almost giving out, a hand darting to grab onto Dean’s shoulder for support as he fought to remain standing. Blood rushed to his cock, leaving him lightheaded and shaking, everything but the wet heat around him fading away. He held onto Dean, fingers digging in and fighting against every instinct that wanted to thrust forward into Dean's eager mouth.
So really, strictly speaking, Sam wasn’t exactly lying to Eileen. It was quite plausible Dean was away on a business trip.
Sam does notice, and his knowing smirk is too self-satisfied for Dean’s liking. “Shut up,” he growls, hauling the cooler up on his shoulder and stepping neatly past his brother.
“Look,” Dean says, and the words come out of his mouth fast, like if he hesitates he won’t get them out. “I don’t know what you told him, but thank you. He’s never had breakfast with us before.”
Footsteps approach him, and he involuntarily tenses up. But Dean reaches past him and grabs the large box sitting on the desk. “I have a lead. I found out he was working with the local sheriff in his investigation. I figured we could pay her a visit together and ask a few questions. I even have cinnamon buns to bribe her.”
Clearing the workspace and putting Castiel on return-the-pans-to-their-place duty, Dean fills Miracle’s bowl first and then gathers all the ingredients they will need to make burgers. It’s his specialty, and the meal he always prepares when he wants to impress someone.
And so Sam had to go on living, carrying the weight of his worry silently when under the watch of humans.
It takes Dean a few long moments to pick his jaw up from the floor. Then, as he realizes that this is really happening (he pinched himself; no this is not a vivid hallucination) he feels his blood pressure skyrocket—all in all, a welcome change from the awkward lunch he thought he was about to have with his boss who Dean just tried to flirt with and who possibly flirted back in the most bizarre way.
Wait. Should Dean have woken Jack up and gotten him ready? Should he have made sure Jack had breakfast? What about Claire?
But no, seriously. With the air between them cleared, it seems Castiel has taken their new relationship status (and
“You said something happened,” Charlie insists, leaning with her hip against the counter while Dean is trying to pay. “But you never said what.”
Victor and Garth are left to guard the men on the deck while the rest of the pirates search the ship for anything valuable.
She is pointing somewhere on the other ship. Somewhere behind the pirates trying to murder them all. It’s Dean, dusty and stained, and making his way over.
“Hands up,” Dean barks, and Castiel's head snaps around. His shoulders relax, but his hold on Ramsey is unrelenting.
“It’s breakfast time, Mr. Winchester. Maybe your uncles should leave and let the family enjoy their morning,” Naomi says coolly. It doesn’t sound like a suggestion. Deciding that’s enough of her time spent on peasants, Naomi turns her back to them. “Bal, what are you still doing here? Take the bags to my room. I’d like to freshen up before we sit at the table. Castiel, dear, I have wonderful news about Michael’s company. I’m sure you can’t wait to hear it. Walk me upstairs?”
“You’re the captain, I can’t tell you what to do,” Castiel says, watching from the corner of his eye for the smile that spreads on Dean’s face. Something warm and soft blossoms inside him.
“It’s you,” Dean says. He tries to pinpoint where Anna’s voice is coming from so he knows where to aim his spells, but the echo in this stupid basement doesn’t help. It distorts the sound and sends it back to him from all directions. At the very least he has to keep her talking so he knows how close to him she is. “You stole those ingredients.

“Mazeltov,” Dean says, reaching to bump his glass against Castiel’s again. “But that’s a reason to celebrate, not drink yourself stupid with a stranger.”
A blinding light appeared out of nowhere, filling the room and making Dean close his eyes. When he managed to crack an eyelid open, he gasped. He was the one glowing. The light was engulfing him like a river, spiralling around him, gently flowing from his head to his toes and back up, then extending out to continue its path around Castiel. It was like a rope tying them together.
"Oh, what about a list of the basics someone would need to begin hunting? Salt, holy water, that kind of stuff?"
Dean moves to trail wet kisses down the line of his jaw, following the curve of Castiel’s throat until he finds that sweet spot just where his shoulder begins. He bites down.
a cute kid, and Claire seems like she needs someone around the house who understands her. And Castiel needs all the help he can get from what Dean has seen so far. And he’s not hard on the eyes, which Dean will never admit out loud, but yeah, maybe he’s a sucker for a pair of baby blues looking at him with all that intensity.
