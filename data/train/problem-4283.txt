He gives a slight pinch of approval to Dean’s nipple and shoves his other arm under the fabric. Palms circle, slowly leaving their warmth on Dean’s skin, soothing and teasing at the same time.
“No. No, man. This is the first time” He looks at Benny and decides it’s better to be absolutely honest with him. “We never did anything like that before”
Okay, sweetheart, let’s do it. And Benny thrusts with his whole length. That feels wonderful, oh god, just marvelous - to hold him like that and fuck his mouth. Benny bits his lip, still grinning, he’s observing expression of gratification that appears on Deans face.
Benny doesn’t need to be asked twice. He starts with slow, but deep, watching, nearly hypnotised, how his cock is almost out, and then hits again to enter with it's whole lenght.
“It makes sense,” Dean nods. His face holds calm friendly expression. It’s okay Benny. All is fine. “We’re adults, yeah. If you’re okay with everything, I’m okay too”
“Oh, not that bad? Not that bad?? Last time I accidentally put it cold on the head of your precious cock and you didn’t talk to me for two days!”
Benny presses him against the door, and Dean’s lips finally part. And fuck, Benny’s tongue is so demanding against his. So fucking assertive. His hands grab him roughly too.
“Right” Dean finally reaches for this glass of water, he empties it in few gulps and exhales deeply. “Oh, that’s better”
Dean, who has his old habit to take shower right after he comes home from work (man can get a little greasy sometimes, okay?) nods assuredly. He kinda thought they’re going to have thee conversation, but… Cas offers a better option, by all means. Sure, he’s patient enough. Besides, he needs his time to get ready, too.
“I am sure. Dean, he had his first sex with a man. Of course he’s panicking and makes a hundreds of excuses in his head.” Cas sounds, like he’s explaining the thing a to a child.
“No, no. You should rest now, you hear me? Lay down, okay?” he sniffs and tries to smile. I just nod in agreement and put my head back on a pillow. Guess he’s right, I’m still to weak to move, even to speak. But not to listen.
He also remembers his own initiation into Castiel’s beautiful world, and exhales softly. They had so much fun, geez. And now it turned out, they are only getting started.
I know, it’s no use, I know it’s not possible, I know... I know. But I keep doing this, I keep begging. Not for a solace, not because of compassion.
“Finish the paragraph?” Dean continues for him, wrapping hands around his shoulders and kissing the top of his head.
“Yeah...” Benny confirms eagerly, as he looks up at Dean’s face to meet his eyes. And this is the exact moment, when Dean is sure, he’s absolutely sure, that Benny is so fucking into it. And it’s gonna happen now, right now, please. Dean cannot wait any longer, Jesus.
Castiel smiles wider and kisses the top of Dean’s head. “Good” He laughs lightly into Dean’s hair. “Very good. Were you behaving nice this day, my sweet boy?”
Okay, stop. Just bring yourself together. Go to the kitchen, say something funny, like “thank you for the pleasant evening, gentlemen!”, and go home. You can do it. You can panic, when you’re home, where no one will see.
Kissing noises turn into smooching noises, and when their lips are finally break apart, Castiel rises his head up, but Dean continues with kissing his neck.
Dean’s breath is slow and deep, he swallows, he rests his head on the pillow. He looks so beautiful like this, Castiel must admit, so peaceful. He adds second finger, his rhythm is same slow. Dean’s toes curl, responding to pressure, but ease quickly and Castiel kisses his forehead again.
Benny doesn’t look stupid anymore, his mouth turns wet again, especially after he looks at Dean’s face. Damn, he looks so beautiful, cheeks flushed, lips open, heavy breathing coming out of his mouth. He’s so ready.
“…and I just hope, that you’re okay too. With everything. And we can, like… move on? We’re kind of buddies, aren’t we?”
Damn, Dean has a lot of paperwork, actually. He’s gonna spend the rest of the day on it. But that’s okay, Benny’s at the workshop, he’s gonna make sure everything’s fine. That’s his job. He has no reason to go upstairs to see Dean. They’re done with common tasks for today.
Benny smiles. It’s a good smile, he feels good and completely relaxed, finally. Something about this robe has changed the situation.
“Oh, not now!” Cas finally laughs too. “You gonna tell me later, darling” he leans to kiss Dean’s forehead, both giggling like idiots.
Dean is busy with unbuttoning his shirt, there’s nothing under it, and Benny notes to himself, that not only Dean’s ass looks good, his boss’ bare shoulders and chest do certain things to him, too. Or it’s the look that Dean appreciates his cock with, it’s like he’s eating it with his eyes.
Cas approaches, looking into Dean’s eyes. Cups his face with his both hands and kisses him. Dean curls his hand around him.
Castiel waits for the response, he’s patient enough. Meanwhile, he has work to do, so the starts with pulling Dean's jeans and underwear down to his feet. He continues rubbling Dean’s hole with his finger, but it’s already dry, probably, so Cas moistures it again with his spit and resumes his circular motions. He reaches for the nearest chair and makes himself comfortable, sitting right in front of the perfect view.
“Feeling better?” His eyes move from Dean to Benny and back. As they both nod with thank, he looks pleased and steps away to put the glasses into the sink. He rinses his hands with warm water.
This is so stupid, this is so fucking stupid, it’s pathetic… but I can’t keep my eyes of it. “Use super glue to strongly bind 2 surfaces together”.
“Of course you wasn’t. Because you was thinking a lot about it, you were prepared, and it was your decision to do it” Cas continues to explain, making himself a sandwich.
Dean gets up and takes few steps in a direction of doors. I don't even know what I want to say, but his name escapes my mouth, before I can understand.
And you shiver too. Are those my needles got into your veins or are those yours? Jesus, do you have the same idiotic thoughts in your head?? God, we are both so clumsy, so stupid, so fucking stupid! We were so dumb, we are both so dumb! We are…
“We’re grown ups, right? We work together. I mean… I’m your employee and you’re my boss. And I guess, in a professional way, we get along very well. Right?”
Dean knows how. He releases other arm from under his head and sucks on his own fingers. Three at once, to make it closer to Benny’s size.
“What, like, being hanged by one leg or something?” All other BDSM shit he has seen runs before his eyes. If these two into dom thing and sub thing, maybe they’re up to something even weirder?
His vision is slightly blurred for a second, like he just got back from lethargic dream, but he manages to focus on piercing blue eyes.
“Okay, okay,” He says, wiping off a laugh tear from his eye. “Time has come for me to use your bathroom, if we plan to continue drinking tonight”
"Why did you want to embarrass me?" Dean accuses through clenched teeth, his eyes narrow and pointed at Charlie and Benny.
Dean snorts belittling himself. Then Sam is knitting his brows, squinting at Dean, scolds him for it.
Dean holds his serious expression for a second, while Cas blinks, not understanding, until Dean breaks the bewilderment with a big smile, and Cas throws a pillow in his face.
"I've already finished what I came to say." Balthazar straightens up, and gives Castiel a smile, as if they've been polite to each other for the past twenty minutes. "This isn't goodbye, Cassie."
“So, where's your boy? I hear you brought a new handsome guy to town? We certainly need something fresh…”
“She doesn't know shit, Cas. Pam likes to tease, sometimes she goes a bit over the top when she doesn't know the person..." Dean assures. “The truth is that, Lee and I, we had a confusing time together, so it wasn't an outright relationship, as maybe you're thinking… We were 16, 17 years old… Lee wasn't out, I wasn't totally out… we, uh, weren't even out to ourselves for a while… We were friends, he and I still lived in Lawrence. Well, my dad adored Lee at the time... But, we didn't have more than one friendship and I... Umn, I was a teenager with a lot of issues, Cas… I wasn't even remotely as cool about these things as I am now… I'm not proud of how I acted when I still didn't understand what I was going through…”
"Cas, this is all water under the bridge." Dean tries to smile at him. “I think we came here to have a little fun…”
“Like I said, Cassie, I consider you my friend, not just my cousin…” Balthazar shrugs. “You know I never side with those self-proclaimed righteous bastards. And you were always more interesting than them, even before you fell out of favor, in disgrace…”
Not knowing where to start, Dean takes another two, three sips of his beer, which should answer Cas's question.
Castiel had explained to Dean that Balthazar is one of his cousins. His mother, Hesther Grace, had married a very wealthy businessman who lived in London, and Balthazar and Inais Knight were geographically distant cousins, but they were the closest friends Castiel had during a time in his life. Apparently they still had some family and professional relationship with the Novaks, and that didn't please Castiel. After that they ate in silence, and Dean only spoke again to tell him about the last day of filming and post-production before the break for the holiday season.
." She says, making her voice a little deeper, in a failed attempt to imitate Dean, with a clumsy smile “or
"Umm… I know, man." And Dean reaches for Cas's hand on the mattress after sitting down next to him. "But then, how are you doing so far?"
"Not for sure, but I think he needed some time Dean." Sam is firmer. “Being here these days... You can keep pretending it wasn't a big deal, but it clearly is. And Cas was basically immersed in 24 years of Dean Winchester - family plus friends and ex-dates stories in less than three days. It’s overwhelming…Also, you said you wanted to get closer to Adam, and whether you like it or not, Adam was pretty scared… Cas isn’t dumb, Dean. He must have realized that… He probably wanted to give us space to sort out our family problems…”
Benny does, it takes him a minute to cool off a little, breaking a silence in the kitchen with his heavy breathing. Finally, he opens his eyes to see a glass of water near to his face, held out by caring Castiel. He takes it with gratitude, this is a very good idea. He sees Dean finishes his glass and exhales in relief, so he drinks too. Castiel takes both their glasses and asks politely:
Your hair smell of my shampoo. I’ve realised it just now, when you fell asleep on my shoulder. I forgive you, we’ve seen this movie two times already, it’s okay. And I can pretend I’m still watching it, while shamelessly wander my eyes over you, curled in a ball, covered with soft plaid.
“Fuck yeah..” Benny’s voice drops lower with every word. He catches himself on the thought, he’d like to fuck it too. Like, for real. He wants to put his cock in man’s ass. But it’s...
Dean realises the importance of the task assigned for him. He saw the expression on Benny’s face. He understood. Yeah, it’s not about sucking guys dick. It’s about breaking the wall inside his head.
It’s a cozy white kitchen with wooden furniture, with a big square table in the midlle, heavy and solid. His boss, Dean Wichester, is lying on his back, his shirt is damp with sweat and precome, dripping from his hard cock; its the only thing he has on right now. Dean's cheeks are flushed, breath is heavy, he holds his legs spread widely apart. For Benny.
Then... a flash of light. And a voice that is louder than anything, sharpened with anger and... feebleness? “It’s you! You made it loud! You woke them! You made them scream at me!” And then - deafening silence.
“Yes, I want him to go with me. I think he would like a great meal and good company on holiday… I think our mother will like him.” And Dean gives an involuntary smile, so he silently thanks the fact that he's on a phone call and not a video call with Sam.
"Dean, Adam loves our dad… He's at that stage where dad is basically his hero, and you know John is more present to Adam than he ever was to us when we were his age." Sam points. "Seeing a practically unknown guy pushing your dad and then the way John reacted… Adam may not know what was actually going on, but in his confusion, it's not our dad he was scared of."
“Benny” Cas interrups and Benny shuts up immediately. He doesn’t even understand why. But he can’t contradict this voice. Something about it, that makes Benny want to salute and say “Yes, sir”. Cas looks him in the eyes, the look is smooth, but it makes Benny squirm a little.
"What does not cancel the crush factor." She points. “And more than that, now I can say, because I saw it with my own eyes. You like him and he likes you.”
"Dean, you're going to tell me you didn't like the attention and didn't flirt back, huh?" She accuses, but not really sounding annoyed. She shrugs again as she heads behind the bar counter. "I hope Cas isn't the jealous type... God knows I just didn't hold a grudge because I knew she was all a joke... and that you were too dumb not to be flattered..."
"This is Cas." Charlie introduces him, exchanging a suggestive look with Benny, arching her eyebrows, before continuing to speak with some emphasis. “
Dean can't weaken the uneasiness inside him, his heart keeps pounding, and he lets out his breath along with the weight of the doubt he's been holding. Cas stayed. Cas definitely didn't leave and didn't choose to disappear without saying goodbye. They can work this together. He hopes.
“Dean, you didn't do anything that got out of line that day… I was a dick. I am…” He says with a short, self-deprecating laugh. "I'm afraid you're only seeing the best of me, so far I don't know how this is possible... But one day you'll see the whole picture, and maybe it won't be as good as your words describe me..."
And Dean thinks that he never had it, that kind of certainty in the midst of what he still can't predict, as something of his own. Faith? This feeling fit with him as well as the hugs he shared with Cas... Therefore, Dean knows there is a place in the world that Cas shares with him. It's not a perfect place -- Shadows, light and a multitude of colors mix from time to time to bring monsters back to life, there are some unwelcome hauntings, and it's like there are several gaps that still need to be filled... Or perhaps the emptiness can be respected there, for what it is: wait and rest. But he's there with Cas, and he can see it and feel it, he can give himself away and find someone to hold him… someone who chose to come back for him. He can have a face that isn't just a mask change. And Cas is there with him, because somehow he understands that pain often makes you want to sleep, not get up, but also makes you want to fight and grow beyond it. There is so much love in Castiel that it speaks to what Dean feels, and for the first time he thinks it's enough to wait for what will come to happen... Because this could be a new place for them to find home. For them to make it together.
Not that Benny never had a deep throat in his life before, not that he never thought a man can do this, too.
At the beginning of their relationships they used to do it verbally, Dean always had to say it out loud. For both of them to be sure, he wants it. It took him some courage, but with time, he quit mumbling and hiding his expression, it was slowly becoming more and more open on his face. Castiel was so fond of him, so proud. Until one day Dean just looked at him, and plea was written on his face so explicitly, Castiel didn’t need any words.
Your bare legs are sticking out of your robe. You are strong enough to walk around the bunker, and, of course, the first thing you did is get to the kitchen. Oh, you woke up hungry and just wanted to make yourself a sandwich, I see…
Dean places his hands on Benny’s hips, he’s gonna need a good hold to keep the balance. Besides, he wants to touch Benny, he’d like to stroke his thighs, his arms, too. He’d like to slide his hands under Benny’s shirt and touch him anywhere he can reach. But not now. He has another work to do. Also, at this point he’s almost sure, he will have a plenty of time to touch Benny in the nearest future.
He swallows and closes his eyes. Damn, this is so awkward, but… he stands there, with his pulled down pants, completely frozen, his hands on his sides, as they are glued to his thighs, surrending to the sensation. And Castiel keeps on doing that with his fingers, he touches his cock, his balls, over and over, util he is pleased with the result.
“Oh, fuck…” Benny echoes. He puts his palm over his mouth, because it fell open and probably won't close by itself anytime soon.
But yes… yes… Sam’s hand is on my shoulder and he’s right, his voice is very quiet, but he’s right. We should get you out of here. We should put you in bed.
This is exactly what he’s been doing, but hearing these words from Castiel’s mouth - it’s something else.
“Dean. I said. We’ll talk about it. Later. Okay?” He looks into his eyes demandingly, and Dean nods. “I had a couple of very stressful and highly responsible hours. I’ve been highly focused and attentive. As you may have seen, I wasn’t even half-hard, during this, because I was utterly determined to do everything right…” He exhales sharply and puts his hand away from Dean’s mouth to place a kiss over it. Hands move down, to untie Dean’s robe. “I need a break. Don’t you think?” Hands wander over Dean’s naked body, fingers digging into warm skin, as his tongue enters his mouth with obvious need.
Dean can feel Cas' kiss on his shoulder, and some fumbling behind his own ass - Cas uses the towel too. Then just crawls from Dean's back to the front. Finally kisses his mouth.
“Uh-huh” Castiel approves. He places his hands on Dean’s hips and strokes them lightly. “Right here”
Dean reaches to Cas’ shoulder to pull him closer. They kiss, warm and light, soft and tender. They will have plenty of time later to talk about this. Now it’s just thankfulness, appreciation and care.
Benny isn’t sure if his legs not gonna fail him, but he gets up anyway. Dean looks up, and their eyes meet for the first time since Benny left the kitchen. It’s way more than just awkward, but the need wins, and every Benny’s step closer makes their hearts run faster.
“Such a good boy for me. My sweet boy…” Castiel kisses again, palm continuing stroking his skin in circular motions.
The movie evening went just great. It was a good idea to invite Benny to come over to their place, Dean is not sure now, why he was so nervous about it. Cas and Benny get along very well, they met a few times before and instantly liked each other, so why he was so bothered? It’s normal thing to invite friend over to spend some time together, considering Benny is still new in town and he doesn’t have a lot of acquaintances here. And hey, it was Cas' idea, after all!
Dean’s pupils are slightly widened, he’s jittery too. He looks back at Castiel, question in his eyes.
“Umm, no. We’re not very much into that. By difficult conditions I mean something, that is difficult specifically for you.”
Dean knows it's a “yes” or “no” question. He’s not supposed to ask or say anything back, like “Can I?” or “Yes, but..” Castiel wants to hear, if he wants it. So...
Castiel sits on the bed near to the pillow, he takes the other one, puts is on top and adjusts a little, patting it casually, so it lays comfy against the headboard on his left. He takes the towel and puts it on the other side, next to his right thigh. Lube goes the same way. He rises his eyes on Dean and smiles.
“Oh… someone’s in a good mood?” Dean smiles. He rises Cas’ chin with his finger and kisses him softly.
“Fuck.. fuck!” Dean gasps. He can’t touch his own cock, but he can’t help himself with grabbing Benny’s hair, pressing his face closer.
Dean flushes. It’s so unexpected and fast, he’s very surprised with himself. He knew he’s going to tell about it, but… But the tone those words were said with. Goosebumps march.
Benny slows his hand, but he keeps working with his mouth, placing wet kisses all over in between the thrusts. He slows his hand and pulls his fingers out of Dean, he licks in with his tongue instead.
The kiss is sensuous now, demanding. If they hadn’t both come less then twenty minutes ago, they’d probably will be fully hard right now. It’s getting arousing, so it’s time to stop now. They break, they breathe. One more slight touch of lips and they let go their arms and step away from each other, smiling.
Air from Castiel’s lungs is hot on Dean’s neck and shoulder. His hand slowly eases it’s grip on Dean’s hip and falls back. Dean shakes slightly, he wipes his hands on the towel and just stays like this.
“Oh my god stop whining, it’s not that bad!” Cas rolls his eyes, and he uses his whole body to do so.
Far away. From here, but where to? I'd watch the sun goes up and down, up and down, throwing it’s rays into side mirror. Lightening the road or leaving it in darkness, disturbed only by the headlights. I’d listen to the sound that air makes, sliced in half by the windshield. I’d listen to the purring of the engine under the hood, gratefully fed with gasoline.
There’s a firework of thoughts in Dean’s head, he wants so many things, he doesn’t even know where to start. He wants this to stop. He wants Cas to push his finger further, he wants Cas to go down on his knees and lick his hole alongside with his finger, he wants Benny to watch he does so. He wants…
“And we work together. I mean. We are grown ups. Can we be just… grown ups about it? Professionals? It’s not a big deal after all, right?”
That is clearly twenty points to Benny, but Dean chokes. He smacks Benny’s stomach, pushing him back, and when his throat is finally free, he coughs with laughter. Benny turns to Castiel and puts a hand on his chest, like he speaks “god’s honest truth”
"Eh… Well, Cas was already leaving." Dean is quick to say, because the situation is only likely to get worse if he continues to keep the two of them in the same environment.
Castiel swallows hard. One arm across his stomach, with Dean's hand holding his. The other arm bent, with the forearm covering his eyes.
"Wow, this is the guy." The woman smiles mischievously. "I can see why he attracts so much attention."
In the end, she would yell at him, saying that he was broken, that he didn't look like it could be fixed, as she had already tried everything… If not for Ana and, in a short period of time, Amara, perhaps he would never have understood that part of the problem was what their mother was forcing them to do with themselves… Naomi never tried to contact him again after that Castiel left her. Most days he's okay with it, yet he can't shake the feeling that something in him has been broken, or has always been in a state of inadequacy with others.
“Cas, I'm not that good with words…I…” And Dean swallows, squeezes Cas' hand once more, and leans his body in an uncomfortable way that allows him to be close to Cas' ear. “For what matters, I'm here, I'm proud of you, Cas… You're adapting to a reality that wasn't always yours, you're having new experiences at your own pace… You're here, talking to me… Man, I feel that this is big and that you are very brave to face all that you have faced. And you are so kind, Castiel. You don't have to be kind all the time for this to be true. You are thoughtful. You're kind, you're good... And frankly adorable..."
"No, Dean." Sam speaks softly but clear. “What he said to you today, everything he said to you and Cas, but talking about the accident… He had no right to say that, and he knows it. He's full of crap and you can put up with most of it, it's not just today, but you didn't have to… And he has no right to put the weight of that, and especially of something that didn't happen, on your shoulders. I am fine. You're fine... It sucks what happened, but we survived and made the best of it. Honestly, he's the one who can't live outside the timeline where everything went wrong, and I don't wish the same for you. You're my brother and I want what's best for you, Dean.”
He panics, it's been a long time since he's been near a man he's taken an interest in and starts acting like that.
"Well, Andrea and I would still be in trouble if we didn't talk to each other." Benny shrugs, still holding his burger before one last bite. “Sometimes the only solution is to deal with it. But, if you don't want to, if you're not ready..."
Dean sits down next to Castiel and places the popcorn on the table in front of them. Castiel looks confused and awed, a feeling Dean is able to make him feel most of the time. He notices that Dean doesn't bring his father into the conversation, so Castiel decides not to ask about it. He resolves to focus on the most interesting items in front of him.
"And he sings... Or he sang... Before his muse fled Kansas." She says it's nothing. Dean throws daggers with his eyes in Pam's direction, she doesn't seem to flinch. “Speaking of him, do you know that Lee has returned to Lawrence? I went to play at Swayze's Bar last week, and he was there… Apparently now that his father has died, he has taken over…”
"Balthazar." Castiel says, handing the taquito to the customer, distracted enough not to act with the usual courtesy. "What do you do here?"
"Cas, don't answer his cell." Dean replies, his face turned to the road, the tension and nervousness not letting him relax.
"Cas, there is no need for it." Dean shakes his head. "And there's no need for you to punish yourself with a cold either... You're going to get sick... Do you want to go inside?"
"What about your friend, Lee?" Cas added subtly but interested. Dean chokes slightly. "Do you plan on going to visit him now that you know he's back?"
“I don't know if I could have felt more prepared, Dean. You told me about John… I was really surprised at myself there...” Cas says unable to feel a shiver at the thought of how he could not control himself, even if it was just a push, as he has heard. For him it was more than that, it was an impulse, a flash and he acted without even thinking. If there was something there that could have hurt John, intentionally or unintentionally, he fears he couldn't have helped it. And it scares him, those moments when the world explodes into silence and suddenly he feels it all again and all at once beyond his control. "But I feel like I may have spoiled your progress with Adam... Maybe it was too soon..."
Dean borrowed a tablecloth, a blanket, some beers, other drinks and some snacks. They stopped near a playground and Dean held out the towel with the supplies taken from the two plastic bags he was carrying. They could barely see the dirt floor and grass, with the poor public lighting. Cas complained that they could be bitten by an insect or other animal.
“Bad nickname. Better not mention it tonight, she's pregnant.” Jo speaks lightly, but Dean is startled.
“Umn…Cas…” Dean starts to say calmly. "We haven't talked before, so I didn't tell you, but that day I ended up going to Swayze's and I saw Lee again."
As they pass the sign that says they are in Lebanon, Dean breathes a sigh of relief. He allows himself to feel the relief of knowing that soon he will find the people he loves waiting for him, in the house he grew up in, being able to be himself, surrounded by care… He's not one to pray, but he silently prays that Cas is there too, he allows himself to hope in that. Dean wants to share all this with him, the good and the bad, so Castiel knows he doesn't need to be alone when things go wrong, as Dean was never alone. He wants Cas to feel the same.
"I liked Tombstone." Castiel interrupts him without thinking, almost muttering the words, causing Dean to turn to him.
Castiel closed his eyes and felt a thumb brush his cheek again, fingers touching his face, and he realized he was crying. Crying has become something more human and commonplace for Castiel than he expected it to be in his adult life.
All this seems to be a reassuring fact, as if Dean could foresee the whole dynamic of this place, with those people he clearly trusted. His family, large and diverse in a way that Castiel's couldn't be without each of them hurting the other for their differences.
“Knowing you has allowed me to discover so many things about myself that I didn't know, has allowed me to be more than I thought I was capable of… After an experience where so much was not allowed for me, or so much was required… to be able to feel the way I feel now, and share it with someone who understands me? Dean..." Cas gasps but speaks without flinching as he looks at Dean. "Maybe this alternative Castiel could find his way alone, without knowing you, or even find some way to accept himself and be happy... But the things I've been living with you, little by little they've changed the world in me, they mean too much to me. And I want to find out more... So I could exist without knowing what I never had, but the person I am now cannot imagine that kind of universe without deeply regretting not having what I have today, what I found with you… Because it would be to lose a part of myself…”
"I was 22!" Dean says out of reflex, before becoming embarrassed and blushing a little. "I mean--- But that's not the point now." Then he turns his attention to Charlie. “Cas is my friend…”
“You know, my parents' marriage was never really perfect, but until I was four I never noticed anything wrong, I was a kid so… But a little after Sam was born, my dad kept disappearing, I-- I never understood why… Anyway, the bar was his favorite place, I guess… I remember that one day he called, my mom tried to hide her concern, her sadness or anger...I went to her and hugged her, I said I would never leave her, that my father loved her just like I did. I didn't even know why it was important to say that, but I wanted to be there, I wanted my family together, I think that was what love meant to me.
She considered it a bit, but decided not to poke this part of his past, so she continued. “But your crush, Victor Henriksen, will be there with Nancy…”
Cas lets out a small laugh. Then look around. “You don't think it's a little sinister here. Someone might think it's bad for us…”
Castiel's gaze shifts from Sam to Dean rather quickly, he looks kind of mortified to have to answer that first thing in the morning.
- Maybe that fits some level of angst. There are descriptions of internalized homophobia and references to homophobia.
“Not about you caring about me... uh, obviously this is reciprocal. We're on the same page on that.” Dean assures stroking Cas' hand, but then he tilts his head and looks a little sad to Castiel. “But about you getting used to hearing things that hurt you, and thinking it doesn't matter… I sat at the table with John and took a few things… I try to talk about them with him and etcetera, because he's my dad. It's complicated between him and me…I think that sometimes I forget…”
"Keep saying that to yourself, Balthazar." Castiel now looks up and meets the familiar eyes of an old friend once. “I'm not saying you don't have the ability or talent, but I know how my father works… He, the team that works with him… Do you think you will bring your ideas to life and make them have their own identity? I say he will interfere until he takes it away from you... And since you're here, I believe it's more than telling me the good news, because you could have called... Oh yeah, you've been radio silent for the last year... ”
Dean is parked near a gas station, Gas'n'Sip, the place is off the road he takes to work every day, but as he's on his way back from Palo Alto, he ends up stopping there, and oh... Dean was just interested in fueling the Impala and continuing the journey, but he looked out the window of the convenience store and something - someone - caught his eye. Not that he will admit it, he told himself that he needs some supplies after traveling for almost 5 hours, before going straight to work, and that is the only motivation for him to walk into the store.
"Sorry, I was following the last chapter of the reality show here." The girl points to Castiel, who cannot possibly hide his embarrassment.
“You do this often, huh?” Benny surprises himself hearing he's actually asking this question. At least, he made it sound casual and even a little mocking, Dean won’t guess, this is the thing that really bothers Benny.
“No, I mean. That’s cool. That’s, that’s pretty impressive. And you... Well, If you like it that way…”
Okay, as you wish. Dean looks at Benny and snickers silently. Oh man, this is ridiculous, Benny feels like he’s eleven years old kid and he’s about to kiss a girl for the first time. Except for it’s a grown man, his boss, and he is so fucking beautiful, and his lips are so close, these lips are so pink and so soft and so close… damn it.
“I mean… Okay. Yeah, it was… We all do things, you know… sometimes. In certain circumstances, I mean.” He shrugs like he tries to diminish the value of everything that has happened on Friday night, but… but Dean remembers Benny’s face between his own legs. He remembers the eager in his eyes, when he shoved his tongue up…
Benny’s attending a gay sex educational program at the moment. Okay, so far it’s not much differs from the usual sex. Be careful, don’t hurry, let your partner relax and feel good, ask, if you're in doubt. He can do all the above.
Their eyes meet. It is happening, and it’s beyond good. They are almost there, one step left, and they both know it.
“Yes… yes please” Dean is almost inaudible, he lets go of Benny’s wrist, and Benny isn’t sure he’s gonna make it, he wants it to be his dick, not his thumb, and if he’s about to hear any more of Dean’s moans… he is not responsible for himself.
“Yes” Castiel’s facial expression softens visibly. His hand starts to move again, same unhurried rhythm, same smooth pace.
He didn't allow himself to think that way. For months. He was stopping himself every time these thoughts appeared in his head.
Cas pulls Dean closer, wrapping his arms around him. One hand goes to the back of Dean’s head, lips and tongue caress soft skin of his neck. Other one strokes the small of his back, light, lazy circular motions. Cas pulls his shirt up, and then his hand slowly slides down into his jeans, down between underwear and skin. And he can hear Dean’s barely audible “Fuck…..” against his own ear.
Well, it takes few second for Benny to look away from Dean’s ass, as he finally understands Cas’ hand is not going anywhere down. For now. He looks up to meet Castiel’s eyes.
Dean has never in his life seen two men paying so much attention to his ass, it makes him go nuts. This is not just AWESOME. This is a fucking dream come true. And now, he gets to feel Benny’s tongue inside him. He’s almost sure Benny is willing to do it. To do, as he is told. He probably doesn’t realise this yet, but Castiel works him slowly, masterfully, as a master he is. Dean is once again convinced, that his husband is phenomenal, and he fucking loves him more than anything in this world. This guy is the smartest person ever, Dean is impressed with how Castiel got his light mode activated today, just to make Benny comfortable enough, but, never the less, make him do exactly what Castiel wants. An hour ago Dean was absolutely sure Benny’s 100 % straight, though. Now he has Benny’s head between his legs.
“I think we all should think of that” He smiles mildly, as he looks at their faces. Faces, not to be described with words.
“Fuck… Castiel! Please!” It’s a whine, and Dean isn’t sure if he begs for it to stop or to continue.
He takes a step to the side and leans closer to Dean’s face, to meet his eyes. He looks. He gently wipes sweat drops from his husbands forehead and cups his face with one hand.
He looks up at my face, but I can’t meet his eyes. He reaches my neck with his free hand and pulls me closer, so his forehead touches my temple. My heart stops. I can barely breathe.
This name in his head instantly makes him alarmed, better than any clock. Hell, frighten, even. Of course he and Cas had a conversation on the matter already. He knows what to do, and what to expect, and how he should behave, and Cas has assured him.. he's assured him… whoa!
“And now he thinks, it was a mistake or what? I mean... I wasn’t panicking like this. You know… after our first time”
Castiel’s hands move onto his back and pull him closer. He rises his head and rests his chin on Dean’s fly, and his hands become slightly more demanding. Dean gasps.
“So,” – I begin, but stop there. I can feel I’m starting to shake again, I swallow hard. I need to breathe. I need to breathe, oh god.
“If you want to go home, no one will stop you, Benny, it’s deliberately up to you.” Castiel starts, as his fingers run through Dean’s hair.
The blowjob itself isn't about just getting sucked. It’s about fulfilling that one exact, exceptional dream of Benny’s, that has been hidden very good and very deep. Of a man, who actually LOVES to have another man's dick in his mouth.
Your clothes are my old ones, but they fit you so good. Soon, when you’re well enough, we’re gonna drive some place nice and buy you your own. It’s selfish, probably, but I want it to happen as late, as possible; not your recovery, of course, your new clothes, I mean.
Castiel puts the lube back on the towel and rises his eyes on Dean again, giving his own knees a quick tap.
Dean’s deep inhale is audible, he pulls himself a little closer to Benny, and Benny's glance falls right down at his hole, shiny with lube. He doesn’t need to say anything, he’s hard again and he’s about to do everything he wants. He lightly touches Dean with his pointing finger.
«I'm not leaving,» he shakes his head. Yes, he's just walking up to the closet. «I just wanna put a blanket on you»
You look sorry and giving me those puppy eyes, and I swear I want to smile so bad. Not just smile, really. To laugh with my full chest, easy and warm.
“I love you too!” And they start to kiss, like they are alone in their kitchen. Like Benny’s not even there, sitting in his chair, his hand still in the air, with lube all over his fingers. But he surely can’t hold back a smile over the fact that they are sooo married.
Benny starts to snicker again. He can be sucked for hours, believe him! This is definitely not the thing he’s going crazy about. Castiel in not even close, this is so funny. Wide grin sits on Benny’s face as he turns his head to wink at Dean in his usual foxy manner, but Dean has his eyes on Castiel’s. And there’s something in Dean’s eyes, Benny has never seen before.
“Fantastic” he says, grinning wide to the table surface, and Castiel smiles to that. Dean knows exactly WHAT just happened. Everything is fantastic, yeah. Just as Castiel has planned. He slides two fingers in.
I did what I did, because I believed in him, as I always do. And I have no regrets. I did it for myself, too. I set myself free. I did it, to set myself free. It was my choice. My choice… And I left him there, without any choice for him.
Benny swallows fussily. Right now he’s up to pretty much ANYTHING. Even if Cas would like to fuck his ass, hell, he would agree. He’s scared shitless with it, he must confess, but it looks like it feels pretty awesome? So yeah. He’s good with anything these two can offer. But… but he surely hopes his ass is not a thing, after all.
Castiel stops as suddenly as he started, he places one more wet kiss on Dean’s skin and moves back to his previous position. He looks at Benny.
He even bought a decent desk and a cozy sofa. Not that he prefers sitting behind the table over getting under the hood of some nice car, but now he knows it a significant part of his daily life. Emails have to be written, photos and videos have to be uploaded to the website, spare parts orders completed, etc, etc. He’s okay with that. He likes his office.
Benny is ready to jizz into his pants, honestly, he’ve never seen anything like this in his life and it leaves him knocked down.
“But…” Dean needs a second to gasp. “But… ffuck… that’s all. And he’s not gay, of course, but he liked it…”
They spend some time being like this, soft and sensuous, even tender. Then Castiel’s hands grip him tighter, lips became more demanding, as he kisses behind Dean’s ear. He whispers:
He kisses. He holds his lips still. He kisses again. All around, but very close to. Benny is not in a hurry, he takes his time, enjoying every single second of it. He can feel Dean is trembling, he can hear him letting a soft exhale out of his mouth. Benny captures his hole with his lips and starts to move his tongue in circles. He gonna make Dean feel so good, so fucking good...
I take a careful sip, and the liquid miraculously starts to sharpen my vision and clear my mind. Yes, I guess I really am closer to human now, then to an angel. Dean’s grinning.
“Yeah, okay..” Benny grins wider, and all of a sudden drops down and places a wet smooch on Dean’s exposed hole, which causes a loud exclamation to break out from Dean’s mouth.
“Go work?” Dean snickers lightly. It’s a nice, eased laugh. One more assurance, that everything’s fine.
Castiel’s hand is slow, but thrusts go much deeper. Thumb resumes the stroking behind Dean’s balls, but now it presses lightly.
“Yeah, I love you too!” This was loud too, for Castiel. “You fucker.” This was mumbled under his nose, for himself, with a very large smile.
He sticks out his tongue and it slides in so smoothly, and Dean twitches around it so genuinely, and the sound he makes is just… delicious. Benny surprises himself making a sound too, it’s a low growl, filled with lust and impatience. He takes his tongue out and thrusts again, again and again, faster, fiercer.
Dean walks a little impatiently around the room, and looks up at the ceiling before answering. He's to blame for that, Dean has been talking about Cas to Sam, as he has done with the rest of his friends, to the point that Sam, who has never spoken or seen Cas in his life, already calls Castiel, “Cas”. Dean sighs, being fair to Sam, he had commented that Cas wouldn't spend the holidays with his family, so it was kind of understood that he would invite him.
"Jo... He can barely count as an ex of yours." Dean rolls his eyes. "Would you call Pam, for example?"
A memory of when he had to spend his first week at Mary and Ellen's house, against his will, comes back to Dean's mind. He was barely 15 years old and had taken Robin there, and well, his mother caught them together. Dean wanted to feel so grown up, but now he scolds himself, realizing he just acted like any idiot teenager. Mary tried to talk to him, to make sure Dean wasn't screwing up, that they were taking care of themselves... But Dean just yelled at her, saying he wasn't a kid anymore... And things turned out really bad.
“When Samandriel came to meet me the next day at school to study together, I freaked out. I pushed him so hard that he fell, he even cut himself on something… I don't remember well… And I yelled at him so angry, so hateful… I said things no child should say to another, Dean… I yelled at him never to come near me again… He was devastated… I had never hurt anyone like that and I could look him in the eye and know that this was all my fault…”
When his cell phone rings, with Sam wondering where the hell he's gone, and asking to be picked up, Dean is already close to the exit, not having any desire to look back a second time.
"I hope you get better, Lee. I could say it was nice seeing you man, but why lie?" Dean tries to smile, but none of that gets on his expression.
"You got... Are you better?" Dean says with a gasp. A thought runs through Dean's mind, and if Cas stayed just to say 'goodbye'.
"Running away from our father?" Sam points adamantly. “Dean, he wasn't yelling at me and I was scared. I ran to that car because I didn't want to be alone with him, and you were scared, Dean… You didn't have to be scared in your own house, of your own father… Even if he didn't mean to…” Sam trails off, but Dean understands what he meant. “He was the first person who knew about you, who saw you, wasn't that, Dean? How he reacted wasn't good, wasn't right… You shouldn't go through this, Dean. Then or now...”
“…they're a big bunch of old friends, it's fun to see… But there will also be people our age, Jo is Ellen's daughter, she helps her mom with the bar… And I think Sam will join us, by the way… He and Eileen are going to spend Thanksgiving there, and Christmas with her family… And Jody and Donna's daughters will also be there, they're mostly annoying teenagers, but they're nice - don't tell that to them…"
He thinks again that maybe, if all that happened after that summer, -- with Amara heading out of the country, his mother increasingly aware that Castiel would be more of a problem, worst of all apparently, his father offering an easier path, albeit, trying to curb any attempt by Castiel to pursue things for himself… If maybe he could have escaped before, maybe he could feel different than he has felt for so long, until now... However, in the now, he hears a familiar bright voice that seems to take him out of those old resentments and regrets, which makes him look up and see a Dean Winchester inexplicably approaching with a cowboy hat on his head while holding another in one hand, in the other he has popcorn.
"And Nachos too." Castiel confirms. He knows that being a sales associate is not his lifelong dream or goal, but for now, this is the job that has allowed him to be independent, to meet other people beyond the closed world he grew up in. So, for now, he doesn't mind staying there and not in a room watching his father's excesses without being able to object to anything.
“Dean, I could go with you if you wanted…” Cas says serious but soft. “You don't have to worry about me, I'm used to it…”
“I said I hated her, but I also said that she left us, that she didn't act like my mother… I cut her out of my life as much as I could after that… Which didn't help… And one day me and Lee, when I was 16 we ended up drunk in my room, my father was gone and… We were drunk and laughing, so it happened…Lee kissed me and I just accepted, I reciprocated, I didn't even think… I just wanted to… But my dad caught us there, he was so mad... I felt so embarrassed -- he practically kicked Lee out of there and I couldn't even say anything… I didn't want to face him after that and... Then I just remember getting the Impala's keys, Sam followed me scared, and I couldn't send him away before our dad came after me, so I drove, crying , angry, still half drunk and not slowing down… I crashed the car.”
Dean blurted out the words without thinking too much about them, and he began to worry that the silence would take over what came next, making everyone uncomfortable. However, a moment later Charlie bursts into laughter, followed by Benny who apparently didn't take any of it seriously, and even Cas joins them, more restrained but still immersed in that moment.
"Hey buddy." Dean says, hands now stroking Cas' hair. “You know you don't have to give me more details, uh… But I wanted you to know you can talk to me… I was kind of a dick that time, but I swear I won't judge you Cas… You're the kindest guy I've ever met…”
"Well, on the far side of my family I have a crazy aunt who could be our common relative." He says with an amused smile.
"Well, me and Cassie are fine... At least the last time we saw it gave me that impression…” He shrugs.
"He wasn't all wrong, you know?" Dean's voice is low, and out of the corner of his eye he sees Sam shift more uncomfortably in the seat next to him. He must recognize the same spot. “I really put you at risk that day…”
"Ha ha." Sam forces a laugh, sounding grumpy. “She is great, thanks for asking. And you know what I mean. You and Cas, huh?”
“Well I'm fine now. And I'm not coming back.” Castiel says, giving the most steady smile he can. “As you can see I have a job, I'm a sales associate and I'm busy.”
"I don't think my mom is your aunt." Castiel says with narrowed eyes, as if he's thought about it seriously. "Although 'crazy' would be a definition for some of her actions, even if the term is not technically accurate."
“And we can still watch the movie…” Cas adds, still a little uncertain what to do with the time they have next.
They stare at each other wordlessly, Dean's mouth a little open, he then shifts a little, and chuckles.
After a brief moment of silence, Cas says too casually to sound natural. “And Friday you're having dinner in Lawrence…”
Unfortunately, it didn't help, however, that she was also considered a "black sheep" by the rest of the family. Naomi held enough resentment of Chuck to project it onto Amara, even though their relationship wasn't the best sibling bond there could be, and besides, Amara was considered too liberal for Castiel's family. She never settled down to some conventions about how a woman should behave well and not appear emotionally out of control, when all she wanted was to be listened to. She never felt very comfortable saying “amen” during Sunday church meetings, without questioning the Gospel or why it was all used to justify spiteful and prejudiced comments in their dining room. It didn't help, either, that that summer Amara was in the beginning of her relationship with Billie, something seen as a sin by Naomi, who feared the “bad influence” on her children, and without a second thought, took them away from Amara a week before school started. The rest of that summer was reduced to him and Ana practically locked inside that big house, with Zacharias taking care of them and teaching them about the Word of God.
And hearing the affection in Castiel's voice, which somehow adds gravity to a simple moment that shouldn't be a big deal, Dean swallows and smiles as Charlie and Benny watch them closely. When Castiel says goodbye and leaves, Dean knows this isn't over yet.
As he approaches the cash register, the guy who is serving a customer leans slightly toward her after handing her a lottery ticket, gives her an emphatic thumbs-up, and says very intensely:
"Who would I take, Sam?" Dean feigns innocence. “As far as I know, you should be the one to say something, since you're thinking about not going there, and staying with Eileen. And by the way, how is she? Still beating you up during presentations?”
Cas says as if this is obvious, but then his eyes meet Dean's and he finishes speaking with a slight smile.
"Oh it's true." Charlie says, biting her lip, then smiles. "Which was even better, though you turned down that cute guy who was with us, Aaron…”
"It's not that, Jo." He cuts her off. “They went to high school with me... I think they're the first friends my age who, I don't know, are ready to start a family? To marry? Kids? Not in an accidental way... It seemed so far away from us..."
“For you to move on with one of those girls… With any other girl.” He vents. Lee goes back to looking hard at Dean, but with something bruised behind that bitterness. “Having the apple pie life, the normal and perfect life that you wouldn't need to hide!"
"Damn, my intention was to piss you off." Dean responds, teases, and Cas smiles with his eyes closed.
“You…” He says without this going anywhere, but he's smiling, after letting out a good, contagious laugh sound in the air, and Castiel catches glimpses of the green glow in Dean's eyes. He’s beautiful.
Dean doesn't respond right away, which makes Cas worry and start pinching the bottle's label. He heard the noise of maybe a closet opening and closing, and when he speaks, his voice is clear, but not so close.
“I think…” Cas says with his lips forming a soft smile. “About therapy, I can think about, uh, trying… And that I like this idea of not having a single destiny to follow…” Cas intertwines his fingers with Dean's and he says looking up at him, with his face slightly turned towards him. "We are not meant to be."
"I'm sorry, Dean." And Cas shivers slightly. Dean realizes that Cas must also be shrunken by the cold. The night has cooled considerably, but Cas is wearing a jacket too thin for the temperature there.
We drive past the small tidy houses with green yards and gardens, talking over each one of those. Someday, soon, yeah, most likely. That one with blue shutters? Yeah, I like it too.
“Oh, no. That’s not how you do it. You’re more than just friends now, more than co-workers. It’s gotta be something else than a shoulder pat. It’s okay to kiss him now. Don’t you think?”
“Check what?” Dean adjusts the bag, his eyebrows are risen in polite attention, but he’s in a little hurry. He’s about to grab the door handle, but Benny is standing on the way.
Dean rises his ass higher, and feels the towel being tossed under it. Then he feels Castiel’s fingers on his waistband. He pulls Dean’s briefs down, or, in this particular situation, up. Up and up, until his hole is exposed.
I place a huge bowl of hot chicken soup in front of you. "Eat!" I say. "Or I’m gonna start feeding you with a spoon, I swear!”
You know who you remind me of? A cold little sparrow on a twig, who keeps on ruffling the feathers to keep warm.
Dean’s shoulder joints pop quietly, as he stretches his arms above his head, yawning so wide, it could actually bring collateral damage.
«Morning, sunshine. Want some?» Dean puts one cup on a bedside table, as he blows off the steam of the one in his other hand. Surprisingly, I realize I do.
They got a little distracted with a flush of sweet memories, followed with certain amount of kisses, but they do continue on their topic, few moments later.
Come on, Dean wasn’t this stressed yesterday. They even laughed a lot, talking about it, he needs to back himself into that mood again, cause Sunday morning conversation was entertaining, indeed.
Castiel opens the door politely, and Benny is out. He didn't even looked at Dean's face. He just couldn’t.
And they also have no idea, how he likes to do it. How every girl who believed it’s gross of whatever, ended up begging him for it. Because he’s good. He’s very good at his favorite thing.
Benny slides his hands down the inner side of his thighs, fingers digging into his skin. He wants to touch every part of Dean, that he can reach. But yeah, Castiel is right - Benny’s going to need his hands now.
As far as he knows, it is slightly complicated and way more interesting with male asses, with the prostate thing and all that, right? Unfortunately, his knowledge is limited with a few bisexual threesomes videos he had watched accidentally long time ago. That’s it. So he really hopes Castiel will help him here, because his will to make Dean feel good stands strong. But, probably, he can start with his own decisions? He may have a few thoughts here.
Benny almost cries “But why?” as he looks back at Castiel. Dean stares in bewilderment, too. What’s going on?
Your hands are cold. You’re so weak, you can’t stand by yourself, you can’t even speak. But before you passed out, you looked at me. You looked at me, and I saw my own eyes reflect in yours. And that was enough to believe this is real.
“Oh. Yeah. He kinda… I...” Dean doesn’t know how to explain it. It's not the time to make a report on domming and subbing, really.
“I think,” he says, and he stuffs three fingers into his mouth, to make them wet enough “I think…” he says, as he reaches to Dean’s hole “...he is much more relaxed now. I think…” he rubs all three agains it, then uses two to stretch his skin a little to the sides, and the middle one to slide in. “…yeah. You can fuck him with your tongue now. Try” and he takes the middle one out.
Dean starts with tracing his tongue down from the frenulum to the base, and back to the tip. When his mouth is up again, it captures the head in between lips. Holds it. Warms it. Kisses it. Tongue is out again, and it moves from side to side beneath it. He grabs the base in firm grip and sucks the head in, sucks hard. He sees Benny’s mouth opens to that, because, of course he doesn’t break an eye contact. Castiel wanted Benny to look. So Dean makes sure Benny sees the sincere need on his face.
Their lips touch again, their eyes close, their hands move awkwardly to find the way to each other’s bodies. The kisses are light, gentle in an exploratory manner. Its this okay, man? Do you like it? Are you comfortable with it? You sure? Benny holds Dean by the arm, Dean holds Benny by the shoulder. Every next kiss is longer, every exhale in between is heavier, tension grows, as the distance between their chests decreases. They break the last kiss and stay closer than they’ve ever been, breathing the same air. Dean can swear, he hears the unrestrained beat in Benny’s chest. His own heart probably dances to it. He likes Benny, he likes him so much. His damn broad shoulders, strong arms, and smile, that sits in his foxy blue eyes. He’s been dreaming about this man for months, all of him, it’s time to finally admit it.
“Fuck…” Benny breathes out. “How the fuck are you so sweet, boss?” He looks at Dean’s lips, he traces them with his thumb. “So fucking sweet…”
Now he needs to make sure Benny sees and understands what’s going on, because his only view is Dean’s back. Which is as Cas planned. So thanks god, Dean’s belt makes the loud noise being unbuckled.
“Oh, I beg your pardon. I forgot we don’t have any supplies here. Will go to the bedroom to bring some”
Castiel sticks his arm between Dean and the pillow, gripping tight on his ribs, causing to lean closer into him. He kisses his forehead, and Dean closes his eyes, resting his head on Castiel’s shoulder.
“What an interesting combination, don’t you think?” Castiel rises his eyebrows and let a slight smile came up on his lips.
“Dean.” Voice rises slightly, it’s solid and demanding, two fingers enter abruptly, and if Dean wasn’t held by Castiel’s arm on his ribs, he’d probably fell of the bed. But loud exclamation expresses his feels very well.
“Hey, hey! Cas, look at me. Look at me!” Dean holds my face within his hands, I can see that his eyes are still wet.
“It’s not even a denial yet, as we understand this term. I don’t think he’s ashamed over the fact he had sex with a man. I consider it to be more of an… an excuse or something similar. Like, it was an experiment. Like a one time thing. Like… yeah I fuck girls, I fucked a guy. I just had another sex, no big deal… Like... unexpected invitation to the private sex club, and who says No to this? You get me?”
Dean knows Benny is here, he is acutely aware of his presence, like he can feel Benny’s eyes on his back. He’s is watching them, and he’s probably confused as hell. Maybe even disgusted? But no, he’s not like that, he has no prejudices. And if he was really disturbed, he’d say something already, right? Maybe he… maybe he likes it? Why is he so silent? Or maybe he’s so shocked, he can’t say anything? Jesus fucking Christ, how Dean is going to look him in the eyes on Monday morning? Okay, hush. They are not doing anything extremely explicit yet. Yet..! Yes, the want is tangible in the air, but it’s only kissing now. And Benny is watching. Dean is embarrassed, he is so embarrassed. His co-worker, his subordinate is watching him. Dean wants to ask Cas to stop, he wants to apologise to Benny and take a few weeks off not to see his face for a while. He wants... He wants Cas' hand to slide into Dean's jeans and take out his cock. He wants Benny to see it. He is so embarrassed with this thought, and it makes him aroused even more. Fuck.
Today someone was in a desperate need to make an exception and knock on the door. Dean knows who it is.
He nearly chokes on his fingers and lets out incoherent sounds, but it’s so hard, his vision gets unfocused.
Dean exhales. His cock twitches in his jeans, responding to this slight stimulation, and Castiel surely can feel it. He smiles again and leans back to take a look. And to touch with his hand, too - fingers grope gently to asses the progress. Dean bites his lip, trying to hold back a smile, this is so…
There’s an ache in my chest, that has nothing to do with physical pain. It grows inside me, fills everything. But I know, it's good. This is me. I'm back. I'm alive.
“How are you feeling now?” eyes now dry. “Jack told us, this little adventure will damage your grace, most likely will suck out the most of it. No angel ever got to escape from there twice. It will recharge, but now you’re more like a human, though”.
Benny holds out his right hand and looks, fascinated, as Castiel lubricates both his index and middle fingers.
We’re driving back home from the grocery store. You’re texting to someone and smiling. Tell them “Hi” from me.
They have a lunch all together in the common kitchen. That new order is a big deal, actually, it’s gonna bring them a lot of money, it’s a good reason to celebrate. So Dean is generous, and he orders pizza and even beer for everyone. It’s a pleasant atmosphere, they all are in a great mood, and Dean laughs sincerely at Benny’s jokes, and adds some of his own, that make all the guys laugh even harder. Benny laughs too. He asks, if Dean wants another piece of that one with extra cheese but no, thanks man, I’m good.
But I keep thinking “If only..” I keep asking “What if..?”  So many of those. Like there are other paths, and it all could’ve work out differently. They throw me back days ago, then months ago, then years. All my life, since the day I’ve met you. I keep searching for the answer, for the exact point, the moment, when I could’ve say something, do something. And you’d still be here.
“That’s okay” Castiel says as he smiles. They can laugh a bit, it’s a good way to let a tension out, they both have earned to relax a little. Besides,
“As you always do” He grabs Dean’s jeans, underwear and shirt from the floor and leaves the kitchen.
Ding! It’s fucking not even 9 am, and Dean’s vallet has lost a certain amount of it’s insides already.
At this point i'm too weak to even answer. He covers me with a blanket and sits on a bed. “I’ll watch over you tonight” he says. I cant help, but smile.
