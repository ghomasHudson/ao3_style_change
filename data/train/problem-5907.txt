The image is of her wearing Steve’s clothing, but this time it looks like she has nothing underneath it. She has one side of the jacket slipped out, exposing her shoulder. The hand that’s not holding her camera is gripping the front of the jacket, baring her collarbone and a few centimeters below it. She’s grinning coquettishly, with the same dark red lip paint she had when Steve was at the Tower.
“Yeah, you know that country north from the U.S.? I mean, I know the educational system isn’t good here, even though it is slightly better than in Russia, but--”
She gets peered at the whole time the two of them discuss what they want to eat. They settle on a bombay soup each, with a side of spicy buffalo wings for Steve and a poutine for Toni. They buzz the glowing button and order in french.
Steve immediately shoots her an aghast face. He blinks. “What do you mean, ‘still’? Did you--? What?”
She bats her eyes and lets out a long sigh. “Unfortunately, I don’t drink. But we can still talk, if you want to, although I do know a few places quieter than here.”
Clint snorts and ruffles Nat’s hair. “You look more like the damn interrogator in those secret agents movies when you put on
such a technologically advanced phone, since it undoubtedly costed hundreds of hours to design and the same amount in dollars to produce. Not many people know it, but Steve is quite easily impressed by technology.
He stretches his upper body thoroughly and groans a little while doing so, before asking JARVIS where did Toni go.
She has two fresh new glasses of lemonade in hand and a sweet smile on her face. “These are actually our unfinished glasses from before, but I got them refilled.”
From Toni, delivered at 1:51: wow, i haven’t even known you for a whole day and i’m already learning so much
Steve turns around all of a sudden and Toni, who was previously looking at everything surrounding her, save in front of her, bumps into him with a yelp. He keeps her from pulling back by holding her body flush against his, using a hand to press on the small of her back. He starts moving to the beat.
“Well I don't know ‘bout you, but I've looked at them often enough to notice the green in them.” Toni smirks when Steve blushes.
Steve does as she asks and takes another one out of the recyclable mint package. Instead of letting it drop on her open hand, he holds it in front of her mouth, intending on feeding it directly to her. Toni shoots him an amused look, but parts her lips.
“My condolences.” She halts for an instant, taking a sip of the apple juice. "Do you have any siblings?”
“Ah, don’t remind me of Strange. He almost never replied because of his job. I don't even remember how we met in the first place.”
Steve doesn’t add that her being a genius has nothing to do with her family’s wealth. Instead, he says: “I met Howard once. He's very sympathetic.”
She should listen to Pepper and find a way to put up windows. But again, would that really adjust anything about her fucked-up sleeping habits?
After exchanging words that are unmistakably goodbyes, Cherry Red Dress turns around and heads towards the bar, accompanied by a handsome young man. Following a second look, Steve recognizes the man: it’s War Machine. He’s a relatively mainstream, but successful hip-hop artist. Also, obviously, ‘War Machine’ is his stage name; if Steve remembers correctly, his actual name is James Rhodes.
“No, I mean, usually you don’t accept interviews from too far away because you say the hassle isn’t worth it. You’ve literally declined
He looks around him and yup, he was right. The room is double the size of what he saw from behind the glass and even more impressive. He notices with futility that there aren't three vehicles, there are four of them: there's a silver sportscar next to the cobalt one. At the back of the room, an alleyway, likely one leading them outside (Steve can't tell because it goes in a spiral), is illuminated by what looks like flashlights buried in the ground.
From Toni, delivered at 1:44: yea, honestly sometimes i dont even know how im still alive with all the bad habits i nurture
They all laugh, because they all know it was Natasha who abandoned the two guys to go socialize with her 50 other friends.
“Hey! I already gave you a glass, don't steal from me,” Steve exclaims, putting down his now empty plate, planning to tickle her. Before he can even put his hands on underarms, the liquid is gone in mere seconds.
At that, Steve’s heart sinks, because it was the opposite situation that took place. He mimics Clint by plopping down on a seat, feeling gloomy. Fortunately, he didn’t have to voice anything out loud, because Clint scanned him faster.
Steve shakes his head in amusement. Seems like it’s his destiny to be called an old man by every single person he knows.
There are at least ten containers with a different flavour each, which is more than extravagant, but so...
The music stops abruptly. A few seconds later, Toni appears in front of him. The corners of her mouth lift when she sees him, and Steve can tell by his reflection on the panel that so did his.
“Do I need to force you to shower and sleep, in addition to being your feeding grandma, or is that role enough?”
From Toni, delivered at 0:38: lol, rhodey would be insulted at being called mainstream (i agree tho)
“Okay. Let’s go collect it then,” he says lightly. He hops down from his two-wheeled vehicle, setting the helmet in its undersized trunk, then follows Toni to the building. While they’re getting to the top floor, Toni babbles about everything and nothing, frivolous chitchat that Steve responds to with ‘Mmhmm’s. She’s wearing the same white spaghetti strap tank top and skinny jeans she had on when they were hanging out hours prior to now.
He takes a quick shower, his mind still puzzled. Steve tries to think of a reason why she would so randomly act like that, and comes up with a blank page.
After they leave, Toni steals one of Steve’s wings and she moans while she’s munching it. He lays his eyes on her with an amused expression.
She wipes her mouth with a satisfied smile. “My bad. I was thirsty. Steve, your food is incontestably delicious, but bread in general is pretty dry.”
Toni hears the elevator shift, followed by the sound of footsteps that she identifies to be her friend’s.
“I'm cold and your hands are warm. Warm, and big, and they feel so good.” Toni’s eyes open half-mast, but Steve can nonetheless see how much her pupils are dilated.
Steve steps inside gingerly. Toni walks to the table and squirts out what Steve assumes is some disinfectant gel from an opaque soap bottle.
From Toni, delivered at 0:35: this is amazing! omg, what if we have other mutual friends we didn’t know about?
Steve marvels momentarily at the coincidence that Toni interrupted him replying Nat’s texts twice. He sends his message to the latter before tapping on the former’s notification.
As for the second image she received, the more she stares at it, the more she laughs. ‘I can't believe I accepted to model for them. I was really craving for attention.’ She saves it and texts Rhodey, with it attached to the message.
To Toni, delivered at 0:37: I’d say that’s unlikely, considering we’re in rather different business areas, but you have a friend who’s a mainstream rapper, so… I guess what they say is true: nothing is impossible [shrug emoji]
Steve laughs and squeezes her hip a little while doing so. “What happened though? Because, I mean, maybe I'm biased, but I really don’t see how anyone could hate on an angel like you.”
Steve refocuses his attention on the pretty brunette. She was already looking at him, which throws him off-guard. They gaze into each other’s eyes.
Two waiters barge in, but the young couple wasn’t taken by surprise; they heard their shuffling before they penetrated the room, both with one plate on top of each palm. Toni leans back and gulps down her lemonade while the attendants present the dishes.
He's suspecting that he's only seeing half of it, because from where he's standing, he still hasn't spotted Toni. The music is louder here, too, and he can't imagine what it must sound like from inside the workplace.
“My real dad's gone, but yes, I know my mom.” A smile draws itself on Toni’s lips. “She’s an amazing woman.”
While he’s waiting, he slips his phone out to check the time. He doesn’t notice what hour it is, though, because Toni replied; his attention is immediately focused on the text message and the image attached to it.
From Natasha, delivered at 0:18: You know, a reply would be nice. Unless you happen to be doing something explicit. In that case, all faults are pardoned.
“All right, is 6 okay? We can grab a hotdog after, I wanna hear all the details about your date. You went to her place and stayed over, right?” Sam doesn't hide the suggestive tone from his voice with that last sentence.
“The world will always need Captain America,” Steve thinks he can almost see Tony smile, even though he is alighted from inside, filled with light. It’s beautiful, Steve thinks, but it will kill him. “It was the only way. I can see them, Steve. All of them. And they are coming back.” His voice comes from somewhere nearer now, as if he is talking inside Steve’s head, but it is faint.
But life meant nothing, not after he watched Tony die after he held the whole universe within. The sun, on whatever planet they are in, seems to shine brighter, full, it seems fed.
He’s heard of deals with Mephisto before. He was in S.H.I.E.L.D.’s files. A soul for a soul. He remembers the details. Mephisto cannot acquire noble souls without hurting himself. They
He remembers the whispered promises against Tony’s skin that he would never leave him, and he remembers the restrained doubt Tony’s face always seemed to hold when Steve made such promises.
“I see everything, yet I still love you.” Tony says, the violet encompassing him now. “I love you, Steve.” And with a final soundless blast, the violet consumes him, the stones disappear, and Tony is no more— only sprinkles of crystal hung in the air before there is another blast and the particles come together again, Tony dropping from the sky with a thud.
He picks him up bridal style, and walks away. They are in the middle of nowhere, so Steve isn’t sure why and where he is carrying Tony.
He also remembers Tony’s gradual descent into indifference as they fought and fought, as they lost their team.
Tony shrugs. “They left. They tried to stop me, so I fought them. They never stood a chance. Not with this.” He taps on his temple again. “They aren’t you, after all.”
“In part. But I couldn’t live in a world without you in it. Neither can anyone else. They need you. The world needs you.” He hands Steve a drink, and Steve flings it away, pushing him up against the wall once again.
He doesn’t meet resistance in entering the Tower, he goes straight up to the penthouse. He assumes that Tony knows he is coming. His heart beats fast, as if to avenge the days it remained motionless and dead. The thought of seeing Tony again pushes him to justify anything he might have done to bring Steve back, but he knows he cannot.
“I love you. I love you.” He repeats, incessantly. To love something and for it to not exist anymore, is not something he will ever comprehend. Tony, so full of life, destroyed by the very things that defined him. Knowledge and light. So, so much light.
“I sold my soul.” Tony states matter-of-factly. He leans his forehead against Steve’s. Steve can’t find it in himself to pull away.
“Shut your eyes, and look away.” His voice is somehow clearer than it was before, he is the most powerful being in the universe, but he will die. Whoever wields the infinity gauntlet will die, and Tony is only human. Steve doesn’t shut his eyes, nor does he look away.
It’s the ocean. His friends weren’t ever subtle. It feels like a distant memory, back to when he first woke up. Decades in ice, only to be found by the team that would eventually become his family.
Tony’s soul is not enough, either. Steve’s arms suddenly feel empty, and Steve looks down, only to see crystals falling on the sand, disappearing into earth.
It should be impossible that he still keeps his consciousness, but Tony had always been impossible, uncontainable and most of all, stubborn. Out of this world.
“I couldn’t let Mephisto mind control me. Corrupt me. So I did the corrupting all on my own.” Tony confirms Steve’s suspicions. “You are back, so my job is done.”
“Strange?” He calls out, grimacing at the wave of trepidation hanging in the air, consuming every single scrap of hope in his body.
Steve pulls his head away to look at Tony’s face— he almost seems relieved, at peace, his eyes light up for a moment.
Steve barely hears himself shout his name, and he knows, knows, knows that Tony is dead, but he cannot stop himself from hoping that there might have been a reason that Tony did not disappear into the universe.
His gauntlet retreats, and he reaches out to touch Steve’s cheek. “So alive.” He breathes out with content. “Warm, and alive.”
His eyes open to darkness, and if not for the smell of the steel-wooden mixture, he would have thought his sight didn’t return yet. But he knows he is only in his casket. A casket of impeccable quality, whoever had put him in it must have thought he was going to remain dead. As all dead should remain.
He grits his teeth, and kicks the lid open without resistance, his strength not affected by his recent
Steve can’t touch him. It drives him crazy. He needs to touch him, but he is captivated by Tony’s sheer power, forced to watch from the sidelines as the universe consumes him. It’s like a watching an exploding star in its final moments, trying so hard to sustain its existence and solidity when it knows that it’s about to disassimilate.
“What did you do?” Steve walks up to him and slams him against the wall. He smells the same. He briefly closes his eyes and lets the familiar smell encompass him. “What happened to you?”
“Tony.” He chokes, kneeling before him and cradling his head on his lap, and Tony’s eyes are wide open, staring into nothingness when they still retain their warm brown fluidity. He is dead.Maybe the reason is that Tony wanted to leave him something to mourn with.
“I got you killed, I got you back. Sounds fair to me.” Tony states. “Magic is only advanced science.” He adds, tapping on his temple.
“This? I’ve never shown you, have I?” He chuckles in a disconnected sort of way, his hand stuck between their bodies suddenly feeling a lot more stronger and pushing Steve away. He has his gauntlet on, out of nowhere. “It’s called Extremis. I can summon it on command. It comes out of my
. It also means I can control and integrate myself into every piece of technology known to mankind.”
“Tony.” He breathes out when he sees him. Tony has his back turned to him, and he doesn’t immediately react to Steve’s voice. He seems thinner.
He remembers his own shield smashing Tony’s faceplate, and he remembers the utter lack of defiance in Tony’s face under Steve’s fury.
“Shut your eyes,” Tony demands, the suit melting away around him, yet somehow, he still remains, hung in the air, his eyes fiery with the entire data of knowledge in the universe— it should destroy him imminently, yet, he persists, willing everything they have lost into existence again.
“Namor.” He sighs, noting the level of surprise the man seems to possess despite his collected demeanour.
“No, no. No. Please, no.” Steve begs, hoisting Tony up as he feels him sliding down. His body is motionless in Steve's arms, his shirt stained with widening dark red. The knife falls to the ground with a clang.
“Who?” Steve squares his jaw, ready to take him at his word. “How?” He adds. He doesn’t pretend to understand magic or how Strange controls it, but he knows he is the only one who truly can.
“Steve.” Now his voice seems to come from every direction, as if he is talking down to the world from Olympus. It echoes everywhere, and captures its recipient from all sides, forcing him to obey. “I see everything.” The voice sounds delighted, and Steve wonders, just for a second, if Tony was always meant to do this. If he was too much for this world.
“They are coming back.” Tony repeats, voice more shaky now, as if he is barely keeping everything together. The particles composing his body threaten to fall apart, alighted, suspended and full of contained energy. He could create and destroy universes.
“You manipulated Strange. His magic. You must have damaged hundreds of realities. You fought our friends, family.” Steve says, horrified, his forehead still on Tony’s.
Even though Tony sounds indifferent, Steve can see the immense remorse and fear in his eyes. He is in pain. He knows Tony better than anyone.
This isn’t the same. He wasn’t frozen, he was dead. He remembers being shot, bleeding to death on the courthouse steps with Sharon weeping over him.
Steve does not cry. He cannot cry, because this isn’t simply a loss of a loved one. This is a loss of everything. Tony had saved everyone, but Steve had lost everything.
He needs answers, first. He needs to see Strange, as he is the first one he thinks of asking regarding these matters. He would know how Steve was back, and what the ramifications
Steve was going to wield the gauntlet. They had planned it, and Tony said it made sense. Steve could hold out longer, and he would die, but he had a better chance at survival, either way. Tony had lied.
Steve breaks first and leans down, pressing his lips against Toni’s. Her hands fly up to his face in an instant, holding his jaw firmly. He groans faintly, because finally,
“First of all, I need to know where it’s situated exactly. ‘Cause it might be not far from here, but one time, a flock of fans and paparazzi swarmed me after I walked approximately 4 meters in the street.”
“Yeah, it would.” Toni stands up, followed by Steve. “My car is right there. I’m two friends a ride back, do you need one?”
She gulps of her remaining cold coffee and climbs upstairs. An ecstatic squeal comes out of her throat when she discerns two sandwiches on the counter. Pepper must be back from her meeting in DC.
“That’s a distasteful way to bring out what you know is my favourite thing to eat! I know it’s a little greasy and unhealthy, but--”
“I'm telling you, it’s all right, love. You know I couldn't care less about that meaningless shit,” Natasha tries to soothe him, wrapping his waist with her arms and leaning the side of her head against his neck.
“Do you like me?” Steve blurts out. He’s too emotionally drained to care if it’s too direct. He wants to know without a shadow of a doubt how Toni views him.
James and Carol had gone elsewhere who knows how long ago. But instead of them, at Antonia’s right was standing a tall lady with indescribably bouncy golden hair - Emma Frost, a Victoria's Secret supermodel.
“No, it's an incredible gift! It’s going to be a nice replacement for my crappy iPhone,” he jokes. Seeing Toni's unsure expression, he adds, insistent: “Seriously, I love it. And I haven't even tried to open it yet.”
The bouncer gives them an once-over before clicking his tongue and snorting. Toni has a hunch that he assumes they’re just a random couple who believe they’re at any normal bar. She can’t blame him: she’s wearing a burgundy dress that looks more casual than the usual glittery and sexy type girls normally wear when they go clubbing. Sometimes, for some people, casual can be translated to cheap.
Steve follows Toni from behind and frowns when she ignores the elevator completely. Instead, she climbs stairs that were in the opposite direction of the ones Steve used to join her. They appear shortly after in a brightly lit living room. Literal rocks that are three times the size of Steve are placed in various places. Toni has already gone to another room, but Steve lingers where he is to take in the beauty of the place. He lifts his head and admires the circular window breaching a wooden and somewhat imposing ceiling. A couch big enough to fit twelve people on it sits right in front of the wall, which is, like the one in the level below, made of glass. Steve turns around to study the artificial waterfall pouring itself into a thin and long drain. He compliments Toni on her interior design tastes and gets a dazzling smile in return.
His thoughts turn to the moment when they just arrived at the Tower. Steve remembers how his fingers itched to grab a pencil and a paper upon the sight of the outstandingly unique skyscraper. He wouldn't describe it as ‘beautiful’, but it still made his breath get caught up in his throat for no apparent reason.
Although he knew that they were never serious about their advices and were only parodying those merry people in life who genuinely believe that telling someone to just relax actually improves said person's situation, he did really try to follow their guidance, every now and then. But if he was frank with himself, he still felt a bit forced to go out - not by his friends, but by himself. Steve knows he would much prefer to stay home to do something antisocial, like drawing.
Crap. Sam. “Uhh…” Steve casts a furtive glance at the clock, which indicates 18:59. ‘Aw, scrap that. He should be already gone, anyways.’ Steve then feels a twinge of anxiety, worried he's being a bad friend. “I’m fine, I guess?”
“Okay, stop changing subjects and go take a shower,” Pepper chimes in, as she’s thrusting Toni into the elevator. “I will be waiting for you in your bedroom in 10 minutes if you don’t show up in my office, so don’t stall. We have a lot of business to look over and you, miss Stark, have papers to sign.”
Toni’s eyes widen in bewilderment; she didn't realize it’s a french restaurant. ‘Copper Branch’ doesn't sound very... français. Oh well. It’ll be an opportunity to display her excellent french, then.
Steve sees a transparent touch screen next to the glass door, but he doesn't have knowledge of the passcode, so he doesn't pay too much attention to it.
As predicted, it's not the door in which they got in with that reopens when the elevator comes to a stop.
Steve gets up from his stool to serve himself a glass of water. He realizes randomly that he hasn't gone on his daily run, which normally happens early in the morning. Clint is on his Android, leaning his chin against his hand, his elbow supporting the weight. Steve decides to see if he has anything on his own device, and when he opens his Stark phone with his fingerprint, he sees three missed calls from Sam and the same amount of unread messages from Toni. Steve is still amazed at the recollection of how Toni synced his iPhone and his new phone in literally 10 seconds. All of the contacts, and even the message conversations, appeared swiftly.
At the same time, the other man serves Steve with the identical type of soup and a platter of 6 buffalo wings, then proceeds to describe quickly the oil in which they fried the meat in.
Toni separates herself from Steve far enough so that they can see each other's face with having to strain to not cross eyes. Her mouth twitches before she lets out a laugh.
Steve’s nonplussed, having absolutely no clue as to why Toni is so suddenly acting like this, and is almost as freaked out as he’s aroused. He can feel his face heat up from bashfulness, too, and his heart is thrumming loudly. The elevator dings and an old man in a tuxedo enters it, not waiting for the still-there occupant to get out first. Steve clears his throat to try to clear his mind and steps out. He doesn’t know how to react, what to reply, but he doesn’t want to leave it on read: Toni might take his lack of an answer as him being repulsed by her. Well, he knows she wouldn’t think that, but he doesn’t want to risk it.
To Toni, delivered at 1:11: I don’t think that’s the right time for the wishes. Isn’t that at 11:11?
Antonia leans back on one elbow and stares back with a coy expression. From up close, her facial features are even more exquisite. Hollow cheeks, chiseled jawline and azure blue irises. Her dark eye makeup does nothing but complement her eyes’ gorgeous colour. Steve notices an ear cuff on one of her ears’ cartilage. He discovers that he has an ear cuff kink.
God seems to have clemency on him, because none of those happen. Steve straddles his motorcycle after putting on the black helmet and flees easily to his house.
Toni lazily raises her head to look at Rhodey and grunts. “Can’t stop yet. I still have filing to do. Please make me another pot of coffee, baby.”
He pushes the doorbell, and no more than 3 seconds later, it hurls open. Clint is there, drinking directly from the coffee pot. Again.
“Good morning. It’s 9:31AM, the weather in New York City is 32 degrees with scattered clouds and a little wind,” a slightly robotic voice announces, at the same time the manually-tinted windows clear up to leave place for a sunny sky. “You have 9 unread messages on your personal phone and 2 unread messages on your business-only device.”
When they arrived at Charles’ mansion, they were greeted with a cup of champagne and a blast of deafeningly loud music.
After his ninth conversation (or more accurately, his ninth small-talk), he glanced at the nearest clock and heaved out a heavy sigh. It had been only 40 minutes since he stepped into this place. Disappointed, but not surprised.
They move out and Toni leads them straight to the living room, where, on the soft wood brown couch, lies Steve’s precious jacket. He makes a beeline for the garment and drapes his back and his shoulders with it, tugging the collar twice for good measure. If he’s honest, he’d say he still feels like crap.
Such evenings - award shows, celebrations, dinners, whatever - did drain him more than it energized him, unlike in Sam’s or Natasha’s cases, who loved to call Steve an old man because of it. One of their passions was to harass Steve with useless advice such as: “You need to let yourself loose, just relax and have fun, it's okay if you don't win Best Actor!” “This is nothing more than a casual social gathering, just relax and drink a few litres of alcohol!”
Steve’s itching to go talk to her, maybe buy her a drink, but decides that the smartest play would be to wait for her to be alone. Which might not happen: Steve has noticed that girls tend to stay with at least one other person when they’re out. Security reasons, he assumes.
His eyes nearly start to well up with humiliation. Of course he misinterpreted, he should’ve known Toni was just being Toni, constantly flirting and throwing out mildly sexual jokes. Steve lets out a noise that almost sounds like a sob. At least, no one should recognize him: he’s still wearing the helmet, only he keeps the face shield up, because he badly needs to breathe, gasp in and out fresh air, or he thinks he’ll be sick. Steve stays at his spot for who knows how long, the feeling like his heart’s going to shatter not gone yet. He can’t leave right now, not yet, not when he feels like he’s going to fall on the ground if he moves too much.
From fave beefcake, delivered at 7:44: Of course. I do like to work out in general, but now I’m doing extra times for an upcoming role
Toni chooses to stay in her mustard yellow pajama shorts and red tank top, before she steps out of her bedroom and goes looking for her two phones. “Where did I put them, Jarvis?”
From fave beefcake, delivered Thursday at 14:03: You were right. It is a follow-up for the spies movie
While he waits for it to cook on a low fire, - he doesn’t want the exterior of the omelet to be cooked while the middle is still raw and gooey - Steve explores the brown cabinets. He lays his hands on three juice boxes, which he judges Toni for since those overplastified things are so harmful to the environment, and jars filled with biscuits.
From fave beefcake, delivered at 10:44: I'm at a friend's place. He showed me the cover of some magazines you appeared on
The two of them sip their iced drinks for a minute, before putting them down on one of the numerous tables and going straight to the crowded dance floor.
To Toni, delivered at 17:25: But why don’t you keep it? I don’t mind, and it looks objectively way hotter on you (;
“Could we make a boat?” he asked, and the gaze he directed at Tony was guarded but for once lacked any sort of anger or dare.
Steve had never faired well with women, always finding himself awkward and at a loss in conversation. The comradery of other men came naturally, easily, so he preferred it.
Tony held his gaze for a moment longer to impress the fact that they’d be having words about this later – god how he prayed that there would be a later – and held a hand to his lips in the signal for quiet.
The children watched him with distrust (not that Tony blamed them after their last lesson). Not a single one of them volunteered an answer.
The mood around the fire as the evening progressed was relaxed. When the food was ready Tony dished up steaming bowls for everyone, proclaiming it was an old recipe of his mother's. It wasn't (Tony's mother had probably never touched wild hare in her life) but he knew Stefen would eat it if he said it was.
Deiter stared at the secretary; his shock hidden behind a blank mask. Major Rogers, a deserter? It couldn’t be true.
somewhat Jewish. Not when they would do it again (again and again and again) until his brains were smeared across the pavement and there was nothing left of him.
“You told us that we should take pride in our country, that we should respect the authority of our government. You told me it was my duty as a citizen to honor the law and protect the interests of the people. You said that. You’ve always said that.”
This way was better. He would have gotten himself killed and dragged the whole family down. She’d had to do it. He'd forced her. He'd -
Really? He hadn't noticed but he supposed it was possible. It would be a better turn than the last two tutors. Considering James and Natacha had put a dead chicken in a previous governess’ bed, it really wasn't that hard to imagine.
Still he smiled to the young woman, lifting a hand to catch her attention and gesturing to the empty seat across from him. She smiled gratefully and made her way toward his table, apologizing to the boy and his grandmother when she accidently brushed the old woman with her bag as she passed.
“T'as pas de coquilles!”  Clinton laughed down at him, expression so unbearably smug as he reached for the bag of pebbles tied at his waist that Tony wasn’t sure if he was tempted to throw something at the little monkey or laugh.
Perhaps that's what Germany saw in him. Captain Rogers: a fixed star, a rallying point, a shepherd boy for the lost sheep.
Steve stiffened in anger as excited gasps and pleading faces turned towards him in the wake of Bucky's words. Was he out of his mind?
“Anyone ever messes with you make sure you find one of us. And if we’re not around, better to run than to fight. Alright darling?”
Clint nodded and Tony handed him the letter which quickly disappeared somewhere on the boy’s person.
They carried on for a while longer before Becker tried one last time. Worry eating at him. Schmidt was not one to play games with and for some reason the General had taken a special interest in their battalion.
“Sitting in my sitting room.” Stefen replied, ignoring the dangerous way that Bucky was looking at him. “Where were you last night?”
Natacha’s hands began to sweat but she concentrated deeply and they did not shake as she lowered her bread back to her plate.
Stark’s eyes widened marginally but otherwise he kept quiet as a mouse. The whole table watched and waited for Steve to finish.
Stark had been a lucky choice in tutors. Unconventional perhaps, but the power behind his name was irrefutable. The Stark’s had shaped industry, been almost the sole foundation of Germany’s economy after the loss of the Great War. If Steve was a symbol of Austrian strength than Antony Stark was the last living symbol of German resilience.
“You’re a brave girl, Miss. Much more brave than I.” The maid whispered, reaching to briefly squeeze her hand before she turned and scuttled off to join the rest of the house in its mad rush to empty. As for Natacha, she made her way calmly down the stairs to find Charlotte and Frau Hogan. She was the only one who knew after all that there was nothing to fear.
Bucky stepped forward at that moment, gesturing hastily for James to fetch his violin from its case propped up against the table where he’d eaten, and gently knocked Stefen’s shoulder with his.
“I’m no spy. Not for them.” Bucky snapped. He was a lot of things, but he’d never be that. Nodding jerkily toward the glaring man at the bar he asked, “What about him. You trust him?”
Their little band of Bayash had dwindled to almost nothing, ravished by famine and disease and trampled under the feet of both occupying and defending armies. He and Bucky had seen one of the uncles killed over a loaf of bread…
“I wanted six, but your father insisted they’d ruin the garden and since the party is for Sam, he thought that was in poor taste.”
The brothers clamored their way out of the boat onto the dock with the help of Brother Simone, finding renewed strength by the sight of him and a familiar face, crying out joyfully as they hugged their comrade and praised god for their safe return. Bruce followed them more sedately, his limbs stiff with cold but eagerness to get inside the abbey and close to a real fire energizing him. Tony hesitated before following after, turning to shrug out of the blanket Clint must have lain over him after he dozed off and resolutely throwing it over the boy's shoulders.
“I don’t understand. Are you going somewhere?” Steve asked Natacha through a stiff smile, trying to make his voice sound light. On his arm Charlotte laughed gayly, instantly putting Frau Greer and her friends at ease.
“Stark?” It was the uncertainty in the bark that finally made Tony turn. Bucky stood in the door with a tray of soup and water. His knuckles were white where he gripped the edges.
“I… ah god, look at them.” Bucky scrunched up his face, gesturing halfheartedly at Stefen and Stark with his free hand. When she didn't respond, didn’t seem to
Someone had cleaned his head wound and managed to put something of a bandage on it. Had Tony done it himself? Virginia? Had Steve? He could not recall the past hours as clearly as he wanted to but he pushed down the panic at not knowing (
“I’m not in short shorts anymore Cap, I’m not afraid of a blowhard like Anton Vonkov.” Tony snarled viciously but Steve knew him better. There was a caginess about the way he was holding himself and looking anywhere but back at Steve.
Tony was torn from the dark thought when he saw Bucky tense out of the side of his eye, the man straightening and reaching for his gun as the sound of running footsteps in the hall finally reached Tony’s ears. He’d just reached for his own weapon when Hortense came running into the sitting room looking flushed and out of breath.
The poster featured a sketch of an ordinary looking man. Heavy set, with heavy eyebrows and a protruding brow. He was no different from the dozens of people who disappeared from the city every day, except he was Italian, and a profitable fish merchant. That, and he was the third man of that type to go missing only to be found stabbed to death in just a handful of weeks. It was an uneasy time in Pola, and not just because they were on the brink of joining the war.
The prospect of having a countess pay them a visit might have had the house in a tizzy in the past, but it remained a shell of what it once was. Even with Pepper spreading the news that Stefen was on the mend, the staff were slow to trickle back. They could hardly explain to anyone what had really happened, and no one wanted to risk their own health after witnessing his close brush with death.
Black spots filled his vision, threatening to pull him under. Steve looked down at the table, the grains of wood standing out in relief against his dirty fingers. He curled them into fists, clenching so hard his knuckles turned white and he broke the skin. He stared at the fresh trickle of blood with no emotion, and no concern. There finally wasn’t any pain. There was nothing left.
That sounded like Dvorak’s cue to leave. He’d done what he could for Rogers. Beating the fever again was between him and his maker. His chances did not look good, but it was certainly a more merciful death to go this way. Rogers could join his wife, and his new fiancé would not struggle to find comfort elsewhere. Yes. Best all around.
Péter did as Bucky had said and went to the kitchen to search through Willamina's preserves. He knew that Bucky and the others were just trying to keep him safe, but it irked him just the same to be treated like a child who couldn't make decisions for himself. It wasn't as though Péter didn't know there was a chance he could catch whatever his father had caught. But what did they think, that he'd be happy if his father died and then all of the rest of them get sick and he didn't? It should have been his choice, like helping Cameron and Daniel had been his choice. He'd survived that hadn't he? Hadn't he proven by now that he could take care of himself and make his own decisions?
"Anyway, 'I want to be a Nun Vati', my daughter says, like I'm breaking her heart if I tell her she'd be happier married to a man with some real flesh between his legs." Scott prattled loudly, drawing a startled look from the stranger who looked as if he regretted it a moment later.
Not for the first time, Deiter found himself cursing the Major and fighting the desire to go to the prison just so he could shake the man. Of all the things he'd thrown away, the love of a faithful woman was by far the worst. Even now, when any other woman would be crying foul and putting as much distance between herself and the Major as possible, Baroness Schrader only talked of her grief for his mistreatment and her staunch belief that Major Rogers would only ever act in a way that was in the best interest of the people. And she was here now, taking care of his children even though there was no longer any hope they'd ever be married.
"I'm fifteen years old Tacha. How long do you think it’ll be before they ask for more than a smile from me?" Péter answered, meeting her stare with one of his own. Pressing her to see the truth. She might find a way to survive under their control, but it would cost her. He didn't believe even his pragmatic little sister would choose to pay that price.
"What else would a gypsy think in Germany?" Pietro scoffed. "Do you know what the Nazis have done to our people?"
"Just look at the state of their clothes. Perfect rags," Tony clucked his tongue, eyes continuing to bore into Steve's with unconcealed judgment. "And they look as if they haven't eaten in days. Naturally we are going to take care of that."
"You alright Tony?" he heard Clint call, though the boy wisely stayed curled low in his corner, stomach pressed to the bed of the truck. Tony nodded wordlessly in answer and inched his way toward his suitcase, which thankfully hadn't been thrown out of the truck and was resting near Bruce's feet.
With the swiftness of a striking viper Bakhuizen had grabbed him by the arm and pushed him violently up against the door. Tony went still as the ex-soldier leaned very close, eyes glinting murderously and hissed.

Natacha felt her heart squeeze in her chest. Bucky had left around the same time that Tony had. He said it was to visit his sister in Poland but she'd known even then he was lying. He always looked you straight in the eye when he lied. Which would only seem strange if you knew him the way that Natacha knew him. Bucky spent a lot of time looking past people, sometimes just over their heads, or at their noses, but not in their eyes unless he thought it was necessary.
“Don’t you?” Stefen bit out through clenched teeth. He knew very well what Bucky must think. It was unclean. If they weren’t already exiles Steve would have been kicked out of the family.
They both jerked at the same time, surprised at the unexpected voice. They turned to find a young woman, not even eighteen, standing behind them, her dark hair braided under her white maids cap.
"What I am about to tell you can go no further than this room." Stefen warned, and their pact silently made, Tony lowered the glass and nodded. But Stefen did not speak right away.
“Can you come?” he asked, almost meekly, blinking up at Tony with hopeful blue eyes, and Tony squirmed, sudden heat twisting uncomfortably in his stomach.
James shot up almost before she finished talking, troding on Tony’s feet in his haste to follow the woman as she turned back around towards the doors; but Stefen blocked his path with a raised arm planted firmly in the center of his chest.  He pushed James behind him as he stood, and the boy pouted as he rubbed at his chest but wisely fell into line behind his father without complaint. Stefen cleared his throat, and Catherine who had already managed to get a good deal ahead stopped in the middle of the aisle to look back. She seemed surprised to find them where she left them.
“It’s Tony they want.” Steve shot back, turning to glare at the other man until his steps slowed. “Go back. Tell my children not to worry.”
Though his prickly butler could use a shake up or two maybe it was time to put some real thought into the problem. The house was large enough, some space could be cleared somewhere. Steve supposed if he were truly being honest, there was also the fact that the gesture would bring Tony pleasure.
“No, no canceling the excursion,” Tony smoothly interjected, handing Maria carefully off to Bakhuizen, standing in the boat, and watching until she was safely settled. She clutched onto the edge in a white knuckled grip, casting big round fearful eyes up at Tony still standing on the dock and he smiled encouragingly at her. She relaxed some when Tony handed Artur down and he plopped into the seat next to her.
Each one of them seemed to deflate, tension ebbing out of them. Natacha blinked at her tutor, eyes wide in surprise and Steve hummed, irritated. All the fancy pony tricks and the man refused to come right out and say it? Fine then, the children would not be punished and he’d just have to suffer whatever else they came up with to torment him. Spiders indeed!
“Bucky leave it.” Steve interjected, stepping between the two and effectively blocking Tony from the other man’s sight. Bucky didn’t fail to notice the gesture either and looked an inch away from taking a swing at Steve. Steve almost wished he would. He was wound too tight and waiting for Bucky without knowing what had delayed him or if he was still okay had only made it worse. He could use a good fight just then.
“I don’t need a drink.” Steve responded. The thought of one in his current state made his skin crawl. His father used to drink down his demons too, Steve remembered. Somewhere in the back of his mind he could hear the echo of a chair scraping against the floor, heavy boots thudding toward him, and hot breath on his face -
“I know that. Some of the best scientists have been girls, Tony, my teacher, taught me about Marie Curie, and without her we wouldn’t have the theory of radioactivity. But that’s just my point. She was polish right? And a woman, so she wasn’t supposed to be able to do half of what she did. And it’s just stupid, don’t you think?” he asked, desperate to figure out how to say it all, and have someone understand the things he had been wrestling with. He couldn’t risk talking with one of the adults. Even Tony. Because Péter had examined the data over and over and the only conclusion that kept coming up was that everybody was wrong. Dead wrong.
He pushed himself to keep going for as long as he could, until he dropped. He staggered and fell like a sack of potatoes at the base of a tree and passed out before his head even hit the snow. When he woke, the light had changed in the sky and he was numb all over from cold, his lungs aching with every breath. Frostbite, he thought, but there wasn’t much he could do to prevent it in his prison dregs. He didn’t know how long he’d been unconscious and it wasn’t safe here.
“Maria has to go to the bathroom, but she’s scared.” he whispered, pointing a skinny finger over to Maria who was standing now too, her hands bunched up in the hem of her dress and staring morosely at her feet.
Stefen’s eyes flew to find Stark who was holding a cackling Sara upside down, holding her by her two chubby legs and shaking her gently like a sack of flour.
His mother had had another name for it- for the men in the caravan that had fought and come back only half there. She’d called it an irritable heart.
“You can't find me in the dark.” Artur shot back, giggling. Steve leaned his forehead against Artur's, melancholy returning at the boys innocent words to lay heavy on his shoulders.
"He’s still our leader isn't he? It'll be exciting getting to see him, and you lot getting to go up on stage and sing. Anybody would be jealous."
“Good. The children are fine, and your friend is fine too, though he does worry us all with all his barking and brooding.” She answered. Tony swallowed – a little too quickly – and grimaced.
Tony blinked and the scent of his mother’s perfume dissolved, her smile disappearing along with the rest of the vision as the door to Hill House opened on creaking hinges. A man stood there in a secondhand suit with heavily greased hair. The front hall was dark behind him. Decidedly
He’d ignored most of the traffic laws as he’d weaved through the busy streets towards the Grand Hotel (glad not for the first time that his uniform was enough for the police to look the other way) his rented motorbike humming beneath him in company with his thoughts.
“The days are starting to get a little longer,” Tony mused. “I imagine spring will be here before we know it.”
He was back in the hall, most of his weight slumped against Tony, the wall bracing them both. Even still, Tony was trembling under his weight. Steve could feel it.  There were other hands on him besides Tony he realized. Bucky was behind him (always behind him) and he was helping shift Steve’s weight off of Tony’s smaller frame. How had they gotten out here?
"While I'm sure we're all very excited, sit back down and eat. I for one refuse to be seen in Vienna with children who don't know how to behave at table."
It was sleek and compact in comparison to the big boxy units Steve had seen on occasion during his service. The receiver and preselector panels were fashioned from aluminum with a matte-chromium finish and the receiver case was copper-plated steel, along with the sturdy feet at the base. One look at it was enough to tell Steve that Tony must have spent the bulk of his wages on the materials.
“Natacha?" his voice was thick with something dark and raw, but as his eyes moved from her father in the bed and back to hers, she didn’t see the condemnation she deserved. She realized he still must not know… and then she shattered. She felt the control snap within her like a distressed thread holding too much weight. Her breath left her chest in one hot, aching, whoosh and she recognized the terrifying groaning sound that filled her ears as coming from herself.
Many of the soldiers who’d seen action in the Great War and who’d been called back to duty were being sent to the asylum in Munich.
Steve had been sat near Göring, once again the prime pet on display with Charlotte and his family placed at another table what felt like an ocean away. An ideal strategy as old as time: divide and conquer. They called it an honor, placing him as near to the supreme leader as they could get him without upsetting the fragile egos of the higher officials, but Steve saw through it.
Bucky and the band had just started up familiar chords on the strings and it felt like an opportune time to intervene.
“Perhaps you could share with your father?” he suggested, hoping that the child’s desire to be close to his father would win out over the fears that came with sleeping in a new place. It was a good gamble because Tony could see the moment the idea took hold and the resulting war that crossed the little boy’s expression.
The room tilted. Steve gasped, trying to force air back into his chest. Tony’s face seemed to be floating away, as if he were floating off on a stream. But that couldn’t be right. There wasn’t any water. If Steve could just focus, swim to the surface and take a breath, he could do what he had to do to find Péter. Tony could help. He had to make Tony understand –
He threw himself back from the center of the lane, managing to catch himself on the low stone wall encasing the gardens of a trio of houses. Steve struggled to catch his breath as the cab disappeared up the lane, blinking back the spots from his eyes. It was only then that he noticed the distant wail of sirens and the peculiar air of hush that had fallen over the city, the way it got when people suddenly drew back into corners to mutter and whisper all at once.
She knew that very well. She was not a real woman like Ginger Rogers, no matter how he teased her. It was silly to have tried to make him jealous, and she wasn’t sure at all why she had in the first place. She’d hardly know what to do with a real beau if she had one.
Zimmerman's eyebrows twitched in what Dvořák could only assume was bafflement, it was so hard to tell with him.
“But then they stopped coming. That was bad because the whole family was starving and nobody could find work unless they were willing to get shipped off to the salt mines, and that was a death sentence. So you’d go stand in a line all day hoping for a days work and they’d take one look at you and spit.
"There, right there." Tony jabbed a finger violently at Steve, his face twisted up in anger. "Is it so much to ask, that you operate like you intend to survive!"
In the case of Captain Rogers and the Lehnsherr Twins this unfortunately or perhaps fortunately depending on the point of view proved to be true.
“It’s the most valuable secret in the world right now. Only Schmidt and two senior officers know it. But there’s hope,” Jann said just as Bucky’s heart was sinking into his stomach and his eyes snapped back up to meet hers. “You know one of them. Schmidt ordered Major Dvorak to accompany the escort because he and Stefen served together, led the same men. They want everyone to see him hand the traitor over to the Führer. Show a united front. Do you think he'll help?”
He stared up at the bright blue sky for a dazed, brilliant, moment before he sucked in a lungful of air and he flipped over, managing to get his feet under him just in time to dodge a kick to the ribs.
Tony scoffed – because he doubted peeling potatoes was going to be any great cure for boredom – but reached inside the bucket for one of the slick little spuds anyway.
The captain had noticed. Tony had watched as his blue eyes had followed his son's ghost like wanderings, but Stefen had still not said anything. Waiting for…waiting for what? Permission? He was the boy's father for god’s sake. Why didn’t he just
“Berlin. Salzburg, what does it matter? It changes nothing.” Tony said and Steve jerked. How could he say that?
The days were moving by too quickly. Stefen’s mornings filled with meetings and paperwork as the army mobilized itself and prepared to take its first steps into what inevitably would become a war for the world (for life as they knew it).
“Are you holding them hostage? Honestly Stefen this is ridiculous. Who would teach your children if I swanned off to Berlin with their father?”
Hortense had ducked inside, presumably to spread the word, and as Bucky crossed the threshold, the warmth from the ovens washing over him like the touch of an angel she reappeared from the pantry with Willamina in tow. Another smile cracked Bucky’s stiff face as the large woman sucked in a hard breath and wrapped him up in a fierce hug.
“I’m with Stefen on this one. That sounds like a last resort.” Tony squeezed his hand supportively and Stefen’s shoulders sagged in relief. He would have gone with whatever Tony thought best without fight, Tony realized sadly. The fight had all been drained out of him, but Tony was resolved they’d put it back.
He was saying something low and clam, holding out his hand but Bucky couldn’t hear a word of it over the howling in his head. It was amazing, how even in that din he could still hear the subtle
Even still, Tony couldn’t stay still for long. In Bakhuizen’s bag Tony found a few extra tools that Stefen had brought along for cleaning and Tony had promptly gone about disassembling the two weapons. They were mostly clean already of course, save the grime and heat from their recent firing. They were clearly well taken care of but it was always good to know what you were working with after all.
"But isn't it? You still think you're the one who has to do all the fighting. You're the soldier. I'm just supposed to sit by with my thumb up my ass looking like- What was it you called me Bakhuizen, a pretty boy?"
here, and one day it would be whole again. One day they’d find Rachol and the girls. She’d forget her polish husband and come to live with him and Stevie, and James – the little know it all – would be teaching his cousins how to say happy Christmas in Romany. Bucky swallowed and shook himself to shake off the cold fingers of the past, but the clinking sound in his ears and filling up his head did not fade. God damn it. Why wouldn’t it fade?
“It’s good, but it doesn’t beat the wings.” To further prove his point, he eats another one of those. “And I’m pretty sure that poutine could give me diabetes. I can practically see the cholesterol leaking out of the sauce.” Toni tries to suppress a laugh at his observation.
For a grown adult, none of these are very healthy or nourishing - except for the carrots, onion and peppers. Other than that, the kitchen seems a little bit too clean as well, even for someone who doesn’t necessarily eat 3 meals a day. It looks like it’s been barely used, really.
She has a sarcastic, dry humour that is topped off by cheesy one-liners. She has a cocky surface to her personality, but isn’t really boastful, per say. Steve feels like if he dug deeper, he’d discover that it’s nothing but an armour that hides a marshmallow-soft heart.
“Ah, right. Almost forgot.” Toni trots to the living room. “Perhaps I was mistaken by the buzz that all the ingested lemonade caused,” she winks at him, “but you seemed to be really awed at my phone’s technologies the first time you saw it, at Charles and Erik’s party. So, I made you a personalized one.”
Steve snorts and gets out of the residence when they are done exchanging goodbyes. He walks to the elevator and presses the button with an upside down arrow. He distractedly thinks about Toni, wondering how much fun it’d be to play games like that with, since she’s even more competitive than Steve himself. The shaft finally reaches the 26th floor and Steve is glad there’s nobody in it already. He finds being in a closed space with a stranger to be one of the most awkward things there is.
Steve closes the lights and climbs back to bed, with the brightness that his phone screen emits illuminating his face.
“I probably shouldn’t even waste her time by talking to her. She is clear-ly out of my league. I mean, Forbes? That’s just- whew. And at this age?”
He contemplates for some time before settling on making bread omelet sandwiches, because it’s relatively simple and he has all the required ingredients at hand. He kicks off by chopping the plants, and although he has to admit he usually wouldn’t use carrots for that recipe, he believes Toni needs her vitamins D.
“This was certainly unexpected,” she asserts, after breathing out an abrupt sigh at the sweet sour taste.
At midnight, Toni easily persuades Steve to withdraw from the discotheque before they both die of exhaustion.
He types out ‘Sorry, I just got home. (Alone) And ma’am yes ma’am, I will tell you everything tomorrow’ and just as he’s about to press Send, a notification appears. A grin forms on his smile and his heart flutters: it’s from an unknown number, but he knows that it’s Toni’s.
Natasha smiles back. “If you say so.” She slips into a serious expression that sends chills up Steve’s spine, to get in character, and adjusts imaginary glasses, before demanding in a cool tone, “Tell me about what happened during the night you and Miss Stark hung out.”
The truth is, at first, Toni was only planning on making Steve another one-night stand. Sure, seeing him and his friends’ ridiculous attempts at sneakiness was cute, but he was just another man after Toni’s body, wasn't he? Plus, she hadn't gotten laid since weeks, and Steve was a sight to see. So what changed Toni's mind and pushed her to ask him out?
He was getting old anyway, nearing 35. To add fuel to the fire, he had been doing this stuff for 11 years: his first blockbuster movie was when he was 22. His career stayed steady enough for him to still be a relevant actor to this day, which meant that a notable amount of invitations poured yearly into his mail.
He’s baffled when he pulls open the refrigerator’s door: there’s essentially nothing, besides for a couple of brown eggs, a half-consumed bag of multi-grain bread (who puts their bread in the refrigerator?), hardly any vegetables and condiments.
“You’ve been working and studying these since this morning. And I know that you haven’t slept for a while, Pepper told me. I’m concerned about you, Toni. I’m concerned about you.” He offers a small smile.
To test things out, he commands the Stark phone to unlock. The screen morphs from a white blankness to a colourful home page, where several apps are already downloaded. An English automated voice startles him.
Steve eyes down at his figure and scrutinizes his outfit. He loves to wear tight shirts and all, but it’s decidedly more cozy to sleep either shirtless or with a baggy top. However, his wax men’s jeans are, as promised by Natasha, still extraordinarily comfortable. Not that wearing that beats slumbering in boxers only, of course.
Steve hears the stairs make a grating sound. He glances in that direction and sees Bucky and Natasha coming down at last.
“Oh, there’s another sequel? Are you going to invite me to the premiere again? Because that’d be real cool,” Clint asks, not missing a beat from what’s supposed to be a conversation about something confidential between Steve and Natasha. Before either of them can reply to Clint, they get interrupted.
To Toni, delivered at 1:35: We worked on the same set for a thriller movie about secret agents. There was a sequel. I remember we became friends rather quickly. She was constantly trying to find me a girl to date
Steve receives the cup with the most ice cubes and takes a big gulp. “Thanks.” He looks at her, wondering why she kind of just skipped his previous question. She seems to have guessed what he was thinking about, because she bends down to sit on the stairs and pats next to her. Steve takes the invitation and does the same. She leans on his shoulder and cuddles closer. Steve wraps an arm around her
“Anyways, uhh, thank you again for supporting my new song! It’s very much appreciated, thank you!” he finishes with a big, awkward smile. The song starts with the guitar strums, and even though it’s been starting to annoy Steve’s ears, he’s got to admit that the melody is really nice.
“Come on, boys, let it go. I really don’t give a shit about them. It’s not like I ever promoted them, so whatever.”
“You see right through me,” Pepper humours her. “But really, I wasn’t exaggerating about the paperwork. You have a mountain of bills, contracts and letters.”
God knows how he managed to stay on the list of top 100 most successful actors anyway, instead of getting swiped away by the wave of new hit actors. He’s grateful for it, of course, and makes sure he communicates his thanks during the rare times he says his prayers.
“Well, you could count my best friend James Barnes as my brother. We've known each other since we were teenagers.”
Toni remembers that was the first time she used wax to remove hair from her body. It was a painful experience, but hey, even she had to admit that her folded legs looked very nice in the picture. They also looked unnaturally shiny - photoshop, definitely.
“My mama, Sarah, died of pneumonia. My dad died not long after from an illness, too. We were kinda poor.”
What happened was rather meaningless: they were in the process of selecting a movie to watch when Sam called. It was about one in the morning, but he and Sam call each other often enough at odd hours that he didn't think it'd be any urgency, and Toni coaxed him into muting the phone, claiming he'll definitely call again and disturb them. Steve still tried to convince her Sam won't, but minutes after he did, Sam called him again. Steve recalls her triumphant smile, but thankfully she didn't bother saying ‘told you so.’
Toni wakes up snuggled up in Steve’s strong arms, both of them settled on the comfortable sofa in front of her gigantic TV. She relishes in the pleasure of his natural heat; he’s like a goddamn oven. She takes notice of his leather jacket thrown on the floor in the corner of her eye, before her eyelids fall back and she drowns in darkness.
“I agree with Bucky. You deserved to win, it's impossible with the kind of fan base you possess that you didn't get voted the most in any of the categories.” Clint runs his face with both hands. “God, I hate those fake award shitshows.”
“Do any of you know who’s the lady over there?” Steve ‘subtly’ points at Cherry Red Dress with his chin, and 3 heads turn. Steve cringes because he’s sure the designed person had spotted them.
put on your shirt, though.” She smirks as Steve slides his hands from her waist down to her hips, then even lower, cupping her ass.
Toni puts her hands on his biceps before resting them on either sides of his face. The two of them stay in that position for a minute, content with their closeness.
Toni in a shower. Mmh. Steve blushes at the idea of water raining down Toni’s nude body, but not out of embarrassment.
He opens Toni’s purse, not without asking for her permission first, and fumbles with one hand, the other still holding his halfway empty glass. Toni shakes her head and takes custody of his drink, smiling a little. “What are you looking for anyways? Do you need a tampon or something?”
She rolls out from under her beloved navy and white-striped Shelby car, her back against a car creeper. Toni reaches for her coffee mug with a tired arm and takes a long sip before getting up and grabbing her cellphone. Seeing that it’s a message from Steve, and not Pepper, she elects to not ignore it.
“Bonsoir, oui. C’est au nom de, uh, Antonia Stark, réservé à 7 heures,” she somehow gets out with a heavy accent.
Steve luckily finds a parking space, near the Tower, and nudges the kickstand out with his foot. He’s at lost, ignoring what he’s supposed to do next. He doesn’t even know where he’s supposed to join her inside the massive skyscraper, not that he has either the password to enter it to begin with, or the crucial chip for the private elevator. Steve whips out his blue-green phone, hoping Toni sent him some kind of instructions. His heart stops.
Steve let's out of a sigh. He was beginning to believe something bad had happened. A laugh echoes in his ears, before a grunt is heard: Sam does that when he stretches. “I'm sorry too, for not picking up yesterday. Why did you call?”
They get if off immediately. They talk about anything and everything for what feels like 20 minutes. Steve shares more personal anecdotes with her than he's ever shared with anyone in such a short span of time. They mutually make each other laugh to tears with their respective stories. He learns that Toni's not only an entrepreneur, but also a mind-blowingly brilliant mechanic. She has three doctorates and got her double Masters from university when she was sixteen. Sixteen.
“Yeah, Buck’s a real ladies’ man. He really loves girls. Well, right now, he only loves one girl, but you know.”
He still can’t believe how he found someone who he just gets along with so well. He feels as if they’ve known each other their whole life, and sure as heck already cherishes her as if that was true, which is a feeling he didn’t think was possible within 5 hours of knowing someone. For the gazillionth time today, he gets overcome with the impulse of wanting to kiss the adorable, genius of a human being in front of him.
Steve sighs. The name Stark did ring some bells. Their legacy was initiated by a businessman named Howard Stark, whom he knew a little bit and met once, years back from now, at a charity event. He knew Howard had a child, but didn't have the faintest idea that it was a daughter, and even less that she was this young.
“Mmf… Yeah I'm alright.” Steve hears him shift, then yawn. “Mmh, sorry, you woke me up from a nap, actually.”
Steve wraps his fingers around her hand and surprises Toni by bringing it to his lips and leaving a chaste kiss on the back of her hand, instead of shaking it like she expected. He can imagine Sam and Bucky smirking at him and praising his whooing skills in his head. “It’ll be my pleasure to please you, Toni.”
“Steve! There you are!” yells Bucky from behind him, making Steve whip around. Scott Lang, one of those pop singers whose songs are exasperately overplayed on the radio, is with them, his right arm anchored around Sam’s shoulders.
Steve stares at her in astonishment. Toni chuckles and feels her face colour from the genuineness of Steve’s admiration.
To Stane, delivered at 10:10: The answer will always be no, Obi. Perhaps you should switch to Hammer Industries if you want to produce weapons so bad. I promise I won’t get mad and come after you.
“Well, what’s your explanation?” she retorts, propping herself onto the surface of the shiny kitchen island, her figure towering Steve from above.
Then, his mind drifts to when Toni was so, so close, that he actually believed for a second she was going to lean up and kiss him. He doesn’t want to admit it, because he would then get angry at himself for acting so entitled, but he was truly disheartened by Toni’s rejection. At least that’s what Steve thought it was. Why else would she so plainly avoid Steve kissing her?
Steve knows there's no point in complaining about it, but he still feels a twinge of frustration for Natasha. He agrees with what Bucky and Clint say.
To Toni, delivered at 1:15: Ah, right. But I have to warn you first, if we just go around anywhere in New York, we will get swarmed by either paparazzi or fans
From Toni, delivered at 1:13: ok i just remembered that we need to discuss about the place and time for our date next week
He would normally feel guilty for straight out ignoring a friend’s calls, but he got too absorbed in how Toni was squeezed, almost cramped against him, her hair’s shampoo scent flowing to his nose, that he completely forgot about it fast enough. Hopefully, Steve was right about Sam not calling him for a serious matter. He still decides to reply to Toni before Sam, because he’s old-fashioned and likes to follow the rule ‘Ladies first’.
“That's intense. You are, as a matter of fact, more like the characters in my own movies than I am.” Steve allows himself a smile when his comment makes Toni chuckle.
Noémie comes back with two glasses of lemonade, ice floating on top and a delicate slice of a lemon tucked over the round corner. Steve takes them from her tray, says ‘merci’ and puts one down in front of Toni. She looks at him with an incredulous expression that breaks into a huge grin. She opens her mouth like she’s about to say something, but then quietly seizes the drink and slurps.
Mariah and him knew each other, because she used to help him with his economics. She unfortunately left for another job after less than a year, but they parted on good notes. It was never anything more than a purely professional relationship between them, anyways.
“Where’s Nat? Don’t tell me you abandoned your dame for Scott,” Steve jokes, faking an scolding tone. “That is very not gentleman-y of you.”
To Natasha, delivered at 1:08: That’s very nice, Natasha, but I don’t want to know about either yours or Buck’s love life
She scruffs those thoughts away with her shower pouf and then starts to wonder who the fuck conceived that wacky name. Then she remembers that Rhodey calls them loofahs, which is so much worse, because the first time she heard somebody use that term, she googled it and came across images of some nasty cucumbers.
They dance and pant in close proximity non-stop, although she does force them to change positions; Toni missed looking into Steve’s eyes and had a hard time doing that with her back against his burly chest.
He creates a contact for her and hesitates between saving it as something ridiculously full of emojis and personal, and saving it just as her name, like with all of his other contacts. He chooses to stay with the tradition.
From beloved redhead <3, delivered at 7:51: This is only the hundredth time you’ve told me, but thank you.
“So, I thought that it would be pretty practical for us to have each other’s numbers.” He adds his number to her contacts and passes her phone back.
Toni knows it’s a bit hardcore for a first date, but the nightclub is extremely near and she doesn’t want for them to part just yet. As a matter of fact, she would have requested to simply stroll around the streets, if Steve wasn’t one of the most recognizable actors worldwide.
Steve scoffs and abruptly straightens himself up, their faces now close enough to kiss. He takes off his t-shirt with one hand and throws it away. Before Toni can even react, he attacks her neck, biting harshly and licking several spots. Toni shivers and tilts her head so he can have better exposure. Steve's hands are low, holding her ass, and he lowers both of them carefully, him on top now.
The next song played radiates a completely different vibe: it’s an alternative song full of energy. People are jumping around and moving fast. Steve feels like an oven had been turned on and is slowly raising the room’s temperature, bit by bit. Or perhaps it is just Toni’s proximity that is making him flushed?
most attractive person he’s ever seen. That says a lot; during his career, he's seen a fair share of beautiful people when meeting fellow actors, actresses and rich - therefore, well-groomed and chic - people.
Steve shouldn’t be surprised by Toni’s thoughtfulness, but he still is. Then again, maybe it’s mainly for herself; she is reknown too, just by a different type of public.
“Sounds fun,” Toni comments sarcastically. She plays with a strand of her iron curled hair. “I’m lucky: they can’t do that to me because I have 3 real estates and they never know which one I’m at. Sorry, if it sounds like I’m bragging.”
Steve’s level of anticipation for this date is almost unfamiliar, and last time he’s felt so giddy was probably when he dated his first celebrity. He quickly learned that social status does not erase one’s boringness.
“Hey, I haven’t heard from him for a while. Tell him that if he wants to, he’s more than welcome to join us for supper.” Clint chimes in, acting like he’s one of this place’s owners.
Steve looked at Tony and saw the same realization dawning there.  There were forms of currency older than coin itself, and desperate times increased desperate measures. He glowered at the closed door the man had exited through. Putting the child out during business hours might be necessary but the streets were dangerous.
“What else am I supposed to say, Tacha. You heard father.” Peter countered their sister waspishly, throwing a hand out in the direction the grown-ups had left in, frowning at her.
“Just the one.” He answered grimly and Bucky nodded, his eyes narrowing speculatively on their truck.
“Of course not Captain. It would be extremely difficult for a man of your importance to do as he wished when he wished it.”
He could tell that she was not entirely comfortable in the arena of parenthood, but that was only to be expected. He had to give her credit for putting forth an effort at least. She’d asked permission to steal Natacha from her lessons that morning in order to take the girl with her to a breakfast with the Christian Women’s Charity Society.
“Maria Santiago. I told you about Jarvis and Ana, our butler and our cook at Hill House,” Tony began and Steve nodded. Tony spoke of Jarvis and his wife with more warmth than he did his own parents at times. “Well the reason Jarvis stayed here in Pola so often instead of following us to Hamburg was, he had a niece who became his ward. I never did hear the whole story there, but when her parents died in Spain, they brought her to be schooled here.”
"They can and they will." Natacha reminded him sternly. "Tony is not god Péter, he will have no say. The only reason he wasn't arrested right alongside Father is because they want him to build ships."
“You’re too kind.” Tony thanked him with a small nod, ducking quickly inside in order to hide the small smile he couldn’t help as Bakhuizen grumbled under his breath and shut the door hard behind him.
"Jesus Stark! Warn a guy." Bucky cursed as his weight fell against Tony and the smaller man struggled to keep him from falling into the dirt. Tony could smell the blood before he could see it. It had stained the sleeve of Bucky’s right arm a slick maroon.
And with that Stefen pushed open the doors to the music room and let it shut smartly behind him leaving Tony alone in the hall. And though Tony had expected punishment and not received it, strangely that door between him and the family he was becoming dangerously invested in felt like a punishment all its own.
Dizzy with relief his eyes looked for Tony again. He wasn’t strong enough not to. Even from this distance, Steve thought he recognized the expression the monk wore. The flash of those eyes, the cocked eyebrow and his lips parting just so in a triumphant grin.
The reason for Tony’s disappearance was simple. Building a frog tank was easy (just a matter of cutting wood, pounding nails, and constructing a latched top with a grate) and only required the sacrificing of the broken clock.  Catching frogs was a lot harder and had never been something Tony had done much of as a boy to begin with and he wasn’t particularly skilled at it now as an adult. It took him far longer than he’d anticipated to catch one of the damn things that fit what shaky description James and Ian could provide. So long, that by the time he made his way to the room that Artur shared with James and Ian Pepper had already put the children to bed for the night.
, and flipped it open to a random page, though really, there were no random pages in any of his books. Every time he opened one it was like restarting a conversation with an old friend.
Tony woke not long after Stefen each morning, and as had become his practice he dressed and made his way downstairs to join him in the garden. It was not often that anyone else besides themselves was up at this hour, but that morning when Tony shuffled down the stairs it was to find his Nonna sitting at the table within the kitchen. There was a tray with a set of mugs and a steaming ceramic jug set before her, but her grey head was bowed and her hands clutched together in prayer.
Since it was too risky for Tony to leave the abbey until the heat had died down some and they could be certain the abbey was not being watched, he and Bruce had been stuck there waiting it out.
A giggle burbled up from in Ian’s chest and he clamped his lips shut over it but just ended up snorting loudly.
"He threw the knife." Natacha's fingers tightened in Bucky's shirt, her heart thudding like a drum behind her ribs as his meaning sank in.
There was still something of a disappointed pout on Péter’s face as he accepted the compromise but Tony could hardly blame him, just as eager to chase their line of theory until it became a reality. He agreed with Péter. The boy was uncommonly intelligent in a way that Tony found invigorating. Together they might just have been able to figure out the impossible.
Six coo-coos he counted, until it was blessedly quiet once more. The bird either flying off or having attracted whatever female it was calling to.
Tony was saved from having to come up with any sort of reply when Artur, dragging Maria behind him, approached the captain and tugged on his jacket to get his attention.
“There will be some shifting of duties, which will mean longer hours for us all, but that is no excuse to let the house fall to shambles. Everyone will do their part or suffer the consequences. Anyone who wishes to stay at the house rather than continue their commute is encouraged to do so, and should let Frau Hogan know in a timely fashion so we can have the rooms cleaned, ” Herr Hammer added in addition.
He was humbled by the number of civilians who had volunteered to aid the coup. It was one thing for soldiers to put themselves in harm’s way but, Frau Boehringer was a house wife. Oster had mentioned she'd just had a grandson. Grimm was married with young boys.  And yet they were all of them willing to commit treason. It made him think of Tony at home with the children, ferreting messages between the Abwehr and the English. Not because Steve had asked but because of how he was made.
Bucky put his hands up in and shrugged his surrender and Steve backed off, though he fixed him with a gaze as steely as ice, with no room for argument. Bucky fought back the urge to smile at the big idiot and sighed. Because Steve really had stuffed his brain in his cock and somebody had to make him see sense.
VOICE: The life of the world, its conflicts and achievements, its news and fun, its leaders and its common people.
He took a steadying breath and turned to follow the hallway to the children's rooms, murmuring a quiet command to Frau Hogan to check the boys, when the monk spoke again.
"But we'll be leaving soon. Charlotte and I will marry after the Holiday -" Steve saw her eyes widen out of the corner of his eye, but he kept on. She'd agree because they had no other choice.
Around them the other children’s good mood began to sink, worry tightening their faces. Bucky wasn’t having any of that, damn whatever Stevie thought the danger was.
Bucky wasn’t sure yet what he was going to do about that, because as true as that was it was also undeniably true that Stark was good for them. He’d been good for this family.
“Ian, come on, you ought to rest.” Tony tried to keep his voice gentle but he was quickly losing patience. What was it about the Rogers that made them act like mules? You couldn't perfect anything in a day.
“Perhaps not.” Tony allowed, his tone so unaffected Steve wanted to growl at him. He just clenched his jaw and moved past the monk, intent on fetching the bedding and putting things back to rights; but Tony caught his arm and held tight even when Steve tried to shake him off.
"Tony, what’s going to happen to us?"  Maria asked suddenly, jerking Tony out of his thoughts. She was looking up at him, her eyes swimming with anxiety once more; and he knew that what she wanted wasn’t the truth. For a horrible moment Tony was torn inside, because he’d promised never to lie to the children, but he wanted desperately to give them to her. Even if they were lies, her faith in him would be a foundation for hope that would brighten days she had yet to realize were numbered.
It was silent for a long drawn out moment. Tony waited anxiously, knowing the plan was brilliant but also knowing there was a chance that either of them might not see it that way.
“I was in just as much danger here in Salzburg.” Tony scoffed but he didn’t meet Steve’s eyes. He leaned away, putting distance between them and Steve held himself back from chasing after him.
“I’m sorry. He’s a fool if he let them take away something so precious.” Tony couldn’t help but think back to earlier in the study with Stefen, and how terribly betrayed the captain had looked when Tony tried to give his gift back.
! Steve had to take it back so he wouldn't have to look at his brother and see a dead man. Didn’t he get it. Didn’t he see? There was nobody left after them. Nobody left in the world to remember them or even put out a goddamn bowl of food after the gadje tossed them in their graves.
When Tony and the boys managed to haul the tree back to the cabin and hang the sled in its place beside the back door, he waved them inside, instructing them to leave the task of creating firewood for later. For tonight at least there were more important things to think about.
"It is," his sister replied quickly when Ian failed to speak, casting him an annoyed look out of the corner of her eye. "We're very honored to be invited."
“Goodness, Herr Stark, is there anything you can’t do?” Charlotte quipped with a winsome smile in the man’s direction and he twitched, clearly startled to be addressed by her. His conversation with the captain had been rather exclusive.
"I’m afraid you don’t look very much like a monk, Herr Stark,” came his dry reply. Tony ground his teeth keeping his lips shut for once. Smile, nod, and say yes that was his mantra for the unforeseeable future.
Unless, Maria perked up with hope blooming in her chest. Unless they refused to come out. Then he'd have to stay to make sure they were fed and nothing bad happened to them. Maria opened her mouth, but when she glanced behind Tony and saw the policeman still standing behind him, watching, she squeaked even worse than Artur. She wished she wasn't so afraid all the time, and that grown up people didn't make her as nervous as they did but bad things happened when they got upset. She’d always been warned to be quiet when Father was home and not to make him upset with the sound of her voice. But that was before Tony had come. Everything was different now and that was why he had to stay. He just had to!
She was a whirlwind of movement, pulling out the contents of a basket he’d barely even registered that she’d been carrying under her arm, and plating a virtual feast from an assortment of jars and bowls, seemingly before she even needed to take a breath.
“You’re not making sense Stefen-Just stop and think!” She heard Charlotte insist as she cracked open her bedroom door to find the pair of them stood in front of Father’s bedroom.
“Just let me clean up and I’ll go start their lesson –” Tony was already stripping off his gloves but Stefen caught his hands, that concern still etched all over his face.
It took a moment but Tony nodded, and though his gaze was still slightly glazed there was steel behind it.
They were under a lot of pressure so it was only to be expected that they would both suffer withdrawnness and darker moods, but Tony still worried. About Péter especially. He was vulnerable in a lot of ways that his sister wasn’t. Softer, but no less brave. Tony was tired of seeing him come home with black eyes and excuses for them that only a dullard would believe. And it was a niggling worry in the back of his mind that Péter for all that he was a gentler spirit than Natacha was still a Rogers. He had enough split knuckles to go with those black eyes to prove it.
And damn, there Steve went with that tilt to his head. The slight one that meant he was already half way to not listening and plowing on with his own plans. Stubborn bastard.
“Ah Péter it’s alright. Your dad he’s just… he’s just trying to protect you. He sees these skinny arms and thinks ‘my baby, a soldier?’ No way!” Harry shook one of the skinny arms in question and Péter reluctantly smiled, a chuckle bubbling out of him. “But we are men now, and the Reichland needs us. We are her sons and if we won’t fight for her honor, who will?”
They’d bargained not just their lives but the children’s, and he wasn’t sure if either one of them would take it back. Why pretend otherwise?
He’d just decided to say ‘forget it’ and come up with some convenient lie if Hortense or Julia happened to notice he’d spent the entire evening in the captain’s room, when a sound drifted in through the window from down below in the gardens. It sounded to Tony like the sound of a car door slamming.
When Pepper and the others silently followed suit Tony gritted his teeth and mimicked the motion, though he refused to say the damn words. He’d already said enough for Natacha to bury him. One more little act of defiance was hardly going to change anything.
She'd found him bent over the sink, blood smeared on the porcelain, shirt off and skin mottled with deep purple bruises. For what seemed like an age she’d stared at him, eyes wide with horror, then she’d seemed to come out of it in a split moment. She’d pursed her lips, turned on her heel and left him. Steve's stomach had dropped but she’d returned a moment later with a medical kit and had silently seen to him.
, was the way they fed them off their own tables if they were unable to find work; the way that they filled spare rooms, and spare beds with incoming refugees.
Tony's heart fluttered within his chest, realization dawning as the words sank in. The garden was where the children said their mother had always held their birthday parties. Informal and gay affairs for the Rogers and their neighbors, full of music and dancing.
“… so, since U-235 is far more potent than U-238. We’d have to isolate it and frankly progress in the area of isolating these kinds of isotopes is still very new.” Tony explained. The bed was littered with open books, papers and charts which had finally arrived from the abbey, curtesy of Bruce. Péter scribbled furiously in the journal on his lap, his face screwed up in thought.
The monk took a sip of his soup in a strangely dainty manner for someone of his energy and answered, “Oh, no Captain, it’s meant to be a secret between the children and I.”
In front the path continued winding upward into the trees, the top of the peak obscured through their canopy. An impossible climb his weakened body insisted, but Tony and the children were up there.
Before he could explain that it had been a gift from the captain, she flitted away with a cheeky wink to join Bucky and the members of the band who were setting up nearby. Coulson’s warnings of her name being on a watch list, and the certainty that she would be followed from the party and possibly detained and questioned about the whereabouts of the war book filled him with fear for her.
“I’m sure he did his best for you,” Stefen murmured, and even twenty years later there was a part of Tony that wanted to scoff and bitterly reject the platitude out of hand, but he forced himself to consider the words and how they were meant. And then to accept that there was a certain amount of truth in them. Hughard had tried only it was too little too late, and if Stefen wasn’t careful he was going to make the same mistake.
“He takes risk… Not enough to compromise us, surely. But you know, it is enough.” Lieutenant Becker had admitted anxiously in the confines of Dvorak’s office only a few days before Dvorak left for leave. Despite his assurances otherwise, Becker had been unable to hide the lines of anxiety deepening in his face, even behind years of training. No doubt he was regretting the faith they’d all put in Rogers. The man was unravelling and if they weren’t careful he’d take them all down with him.
Bucky paused in his playing to draw his gaze back to where the kids were playing in the water. His eyes were drawn to Ian who was cutting a noisy line up and down the length of the dock, dogged in his efforts to become an accomplished swimmer and pleased as punch at the completion of each lap.
He’d intended to live out his days here… looking out the window over the familiar architecture and the apartments squeezed wherever they could fit, he even imagined he might have been happy. But then the army had asked him to do a promotional tour and Philips had brought to him his concerns for the state of the country with Austria’s fragile new government and no police force or real army to speak of. Steve had seen no other way forward but to do his part. And then, while on tour, Margrit had come along and Steve had found happiness in measures he’d never dreamed of. Home to him became Salzburg with Peggy and she’d taken home with her when she'd left.
“Yes.” Susann answered after a brief pause. “I learned a lot from my father, he’s a surgeon, I even had some schooling. With the war on… well I wanted to help.”
Whether Péter realized it or not his friends were heading to war. You did not put children in uniform and teach them to march unless you were preparing an army. It chilled Tony to think that Péter might very well know and not care. Or worse, relish it.
He needed a key. In and out quick as anything and on the off chance he was caught, nothing gave someone the appearance of authority so much as a key.
“It's about time.” Bucky drawled “Charlotte's only been throwing herself at you for months. Well as much as woman like that ever does. When-”
“No, I'd not heard that.” Steve peered at the rest of his staff. “Had you?” he turned the question on to his chauffeur.
Tony looked at Clint who sprang into action, opening the suitcase and fishing around for the stamped documents the abbot had given them. He handed them over to the Warden who barely looked at them before reaching for the pen sitting in the inkwell on the desk and scratching his signature.
“How so?” he enquired, curious and she leaned toward him, whispering almost conspiratorially. “Everyone is built a certain way. You Tony, are a builder. You can love broken things because nothing is truly broken to you. It’s just waiting to be improved or remade. That’s why you feel bad when you can’t make things better.” She said, as if she weren’t completely stripping him with her words. She was a marvel, this confident child with the wisdom of someone twice her age and the weary gaze to match.
“Need their sleep.” Tony interjected, squeezing his hand encouragingly. “Take a breath Stefen. There’s no reason to charge in there like bulls. We’ll go slow and steady and you’ll be glad you didn’t wake them unnecessarily when you see that they are fine where you left them.”
The thought of closing his eyes to sleep with Artur ill terrified him, unable to shake the fear that he’d slip away while Steve slept the way so many of his comrads had done in the mountains, that he’d wake to shake Arturawake only to realize his body had gone cold in the night that the sleep that gripped him was final. He tensed up, clenching his teeth tightly together prepared to shake his head adamantly before Tony’s hand slipped over his.
"I'll always fight if it means I have the power to help people.” Steve answered. “With that power comes a responsibility, but my first responsibility is to you... I've not been a good father, I know."
He’d never appreciated until meeting Captain Rogers how painful it must have been for his mother to live apart from her kin and torn from all the things that had once defined her.
“They will need to see some proof of course, but I am willing to relay your terms to my superiors. Let's discuss them shall we, Mr. Stark?”
He didn’t say anything, but his iron grip around Tony’s middle spoke volumes and Tony held him tighter.
“Five. H-he collapsed two days ago,” she recounted with a slight tremor. She kept her eyes fixed on Stefen lying on the bed, and Tony got the feeling she was forcing herself to look. That she would have just stood there until the sun rose, committing his devastated body to memory if he’d let her. She was almost whispering as she finished, “I was too scared to give him more.”
He didn't learn it until after the children had finished their meal and Bucky had emerged from Stefen's office a few hours after, but Tony had been right. Bucky had not found Péter.
she did. Tony kicked himself. They all took for granted how mature she was, how consistently levelheaded and undemanding in comparison to her siblings, but she was still a
“Franz loves us. He’s not a coward!” She flayed underneath him. He grabbed her face, squeezing her head between his hands as if he could pop it like a ripe tomato, screaming into it. “Your brother betrayed his blood to save his own neck. Open your eyes! Why do you think the SS spared the two of you?”
He rubbed at his face again.  Hadn’t Virginia promised to wake him? Why had she let him sleep so long?!
If Bucky had not walked in when he had, Steve had no doubt he would have kissed Tony. A mistake brought on no doubt by the intimacy they’d shared and easily avoided in the future when he wasn’t so caught off guard.
Steve glanced at him, his brow furrowed in confusion, his mind still stuck on Stark’s words (hearing Stark’s voice the way he imagined he would have said them) and Bucky gestured at the letter impatiently. Steve glanced down at it in shock like he’d not realized he even had a letter in his hand to begin with.
If James were here- but he wasn’t! She stubbornly reminded herself, setting her cup down with conviction. James was gone, and she was no wilting flower either. She was Charlotte Shrader, Count Maxwell Schrader’s only daughter and the fiancé of Major Stefen Rogers. It was up to her to bring them all down from the ledge he so dangerously held them over, to assure the safety of both the man she loved and Margrit’s poor children. She would have her way.
“Burn that, soon as you’ve read it. I’ll be back in two days.” The boy reminded him. He turned to leave, but seemed to remember at the last moment. “Oh and Coulson says good luck to you Captain, you’re gonna need it.”
“The finest. And it will be the finest of parties. Fine china, wine so expensive it will make you sick, opera singers…”
“Look, I have no problem with Harry. I’m sure he’s a nice kid. But let’s limit the climbing up the side of the house in the dead of night and trying to give Tony heart attacks bit in the future, yeah? Do that for me and we’ll just consider this whole thing a secret between you and me.”
But he knew he’d catch it by the ear for it later if Pepper found out, which she would of course, because he'd learned from past experience it was better all-around not to sleep with the maids. At least not the ones in your own house. Too much tears and fuss when they inevitably fell in love with you or got jealous of each other.
He left them about a half a mile in the wrong direction, their numbers depleted and circled back to where he’d found them. There was little he could do about his tracks in the snow besides take the time to make them as confusing as possible. He took sudden twists and made winding circles, only to retrace his steps and create muddled forks on his path that would slow them down until they got dogs. The dogs would come soon enough, along with more men. Balancing the urge to just go as fast as possible and to proceed carefully and strategically in a way that would give Steve the best chance was like walking on a razor wire.
“Natacha is in town, Harolds gone to pick her up. The others are on their way to my home in Vienna.” Charlotte answered after a pregnant pause.
“You must learn to slow down. No one is going to take your food.” She admonished with a smile. Artur nodded, his cheeks going a little red, and murmured a thank you before tucking right back into his meal.
“I can’t! I can’t, I can’t! Why doesn’t anybody ever believe me?!” The boy was hollering at the top of his lungs at Natacha who was standing in the doorway of the boy’s room, her mouth pursed tightly in disapproval. Tony could see why as he came up behind her and was able to see James sprawled pathetically on the floor, red faced and in nothing but his shirt and underwear.
“No.” Tony heard himself snap, surprising even himself but he said it again, firmer as all eyes turned to him. “How dare you come here with that.”
And Tony had known then, that whatever was going on was bigger than he could possibly imagine. There was life and death hanging in the balance and any little change in the wind could mean something unimaginable.
almost as badly, was that your mouth tended to get ahead of you. At least if your name was Tony Stark it did.
“These are your new play clothes.” Tony informed her distractedly as he worked at freeing the fabric.
Henry Reynold Osborne (Harry to his friends) had been Péter’s playmate since they were small boys. Their mothers had been good friends, but their fathers less so. Harry’s father Norman was an important business man from old money who had married into even older piles of it. Norman Osborne was the sort who looked down on people born into the wrong class. Péter had once overheard Harry’s father remarking to a fellow party guest that it was a shame for high born ladies to serve as nurses, because then just about any low born soldier could get ideas. He’d known Harry’s father was talking about his parents and the fact that Péter’s father had been born on a farm to nobody of account. It had made him angry and Péter had shouted at him and kicked him in front of everybody. Mother had been embarrassed and had sent him away without supper when he refused to apologize, but later when he’d told them what Harry’s father had said she’d told him that people like Norman Osborne were fools who didn’t know any better, but that he still had to mind his elders.
Hadn’t Tony been tutored privately and forbidden from doing anything that Hughard deemed too ‘Jewish’ or might lead someone to suspect he came from that stock? Hadn’t Hughard paid people to conveniently forget that Maria Carboni was a convert on Tony’s birth records? And hadn’t he, upon suspecting potential betrayal, arranged for Tony to be tucked out of sight in the one place he couldn’t be touched, even if it meant stripping away his entire identity?
“I still fail to understand how going to live with this Nazi is going to be less risky,” Tony grumbled.
God, Stefen looked like shit, but he was the most beautiful thing Bucky had ever seen and he was alive. Maybe not for long though, because Bucky heard the roar of engines not far off and ducked low again. A line of vehicles made their way along the bottom of the ridge toward the two men. Bucky’s trigger finger itched but he stayed still, biding his time. If Schmidt and the others were here then Bucky’s men were either dead or forced to retreat. There wouldn’t be any backup coming.
“Nothing, nothing’s happening,” Father said as he swung her up into his arms and brushed back the stray strands of sweaty hair that had fallen out of her night braid.
“His asthma.” He murmured lowly and Tony’s frantic mind did manage to remember it had been on the list of the children’s illnesses. Honestly that list had been so long that it had all begun to blur before Tony had even finished reading what was wrong with Péter. He felt a flash of guilt, because somewhere along the line after he’d become suspicious of Péter’s heart condition he’d begun operating under the assumption that he need not mind that list at all.
She liked him. He made her father smile and laugh and act like himself again. She’d tolerated him just for that at first, but it was far more complex than that now. She liked Tony for Tony. He challenged her where the other tutors had never bothered. He didn’t believe her when she said all she wanted was to be a proper young lady and get married soon. As frustrating as that was, it was, deep down, a relief. But not one she could afford to indulge in. It was Tony’s honesty and the way he demanded honesty from each of them in turn that was so dangerous.
Péter wondered if that were true. Natacha could do it, probably better than any of them. The little ones were young enough that their memories would dull with time, and they'd parrot the things they were taught. But Péter would never forget. He’d seen what they did to people and he could
“You see! I told you what he is like Baroness.” Hammer barked, pointing one thin accusing finger in Tony’s direction. “I’ve tried to tell the Major, but it’s as if he has put some sort of spell on him. He ought to be reported to the police! I’d have done it myself if I weren’t afraid he’d turn the Major against me.”
Stanislov’s man had not wavered in his faithful dogging of Tony’s steps, making it impossible for Tony to return to his teaching post. The Rabbi had plenty of other work for him, which Tony undertook with a glad heart to keep Stanislov’s underling occupied. It was only by keeping up the appearance that they would be able to escape the net drawn around them now, and Tony knew he must appear to be falling into the trap that had been set for him.
"Damn." Bucky cursed, running his hand through his hair. "We've got to get them out of there Stevie."
“I checked at the station. He’s not been arrested. Perhaps he’s made it home by now?” Grig suggested when he and Steve met up again in front of the bank.
“Son.” Steve corrected, an image of Ian, holding his shirt and all its missing buttons in hand the night before he’d left to report to his post filling his head. “Ian’s ten. Natacha’s twelve and about to be thirty.”
He inched forward, eyes drawn to the door to his right where the low sounds of distress were emanating. Stefen’s room.
When had he said that? Well, naturally most of them would be relieved. The Hogans would most likely make their way back to England to be with Virginia’s family. Hammer and the other servants had families and lives of their own in Austria, but he’d never said anything any which way about where the staff would go.
“I’m thinking that it would be a shame to miss Péter while he is home. And it’s so close to when dear May is to come visit. Let me talk to Herr Schmidt. What the officials want is for you to put on a show Stefen, and there is no spectacle so wonderful as a party. And I do throw such gay parties.”
“But it’s our understanding you attended the Academy of Sciences in Berlin?” Hoch questioned hopefully.
"I don’t care.” Bucky snapped. “If I had my way you’d have this plan drilled so far down in your head it’s deeper than instinct. Because when things go to shit and you're staring down a gun, instinct might be all you have. "
In times like these, compliance was everything and as it had been true from the beginning of time, a strategic match offered a woman protection and resources she couldn’t find anywhere else. As the wife of Major Stefen Rogers she would continue to be respected, her voice a leading one within the League of German Women. She held no illusions that she could do much of anything at all about the Nazis, but could continue to do her part to make schools better, working conditions improved, and support those politicians whom she was sure would eventually overcome the Nazi Party once people realized how truly mad Adolf Hitler was.
“One, it will teach you not use me as a way of avoiding things. And two, there’s no reason that they shouldn’t. The cat is already out of the bag about their talent, and they sing whenever your General Schmidt calls for it anyway.”
His own feelings weren't any easier to sort out. He'd never been free to indulge in his attraction toward his own sex, let alone anything deeper. Arguably he wasn't free to do it now, except there was nothing as freeing as the knowledge of imminent death. He couldn’t be certain of when, only that it was coming and that he was determined he wouldn't go to his death denying the few things that still brought him happiness.
“Franz, please.” she repeated, and her brother whirled on her, one finger jabbing viciously in Steve’s direction as he shouted. “You know who that is! You’ll kill the entire family!”
“I’m alright.” She repeated until slowly his hands stopped roving. His eyes pulled up to meet hers finding her gaze was steady on him. A stranger stared back at him from a familiar face.
"Stefen they'll kill you!" Tony barked his throat raw around the words. He gripped the hands Stefen had on him desperately, until his fingers were white where they dug into Stefen’s skin.
They were all of them thin and worn, carrying the fatigue brought on by weeks of hard labor with little food to support them.
Péter said all this as if he were delivering a report. Short, clipped and removed. Steve couldn't bring himself to be to irritate with his standoffishness. The boy had learned it from him after all.
hit him like a speeding car, a shuddering breath eeking out of his chest as slowly every tight muscle in his body eased, leaving him feeling weak and drained.
He made his way to the back until he was facing the row of smaller buildings directly behind the hall. There was less damage back here, as only a few of the buildings were owned by Jews. It felt safer somehow to call out.
He’d turned the page only to have a detailed diagram slip from between the folds and land on the desk.
They were too old to fuss but he could feel the way Péter and Tacha deflated, their eyes dulled as if they’d expected such an answer from the first.
That, he might have been able to stomach on its own truth be told (Germany was hardly the first country to fabricate some far nobler history for itself than had actually occurred) but he just couldn’t bring himself to read all that tripe about the inferior blood of Jews (and anyone else who just happened to not be blond haired and blue eyed) and the inherent degeneration of character that was sure to be the death of good moral Germans everywhere as a result of their mixing. It was enough to make his blood boil; and seeing as how setting himself aflame seemed rather counterproductive to the goal of surviving these mad times he found himself in he’d settled for burning the documents.
“If there’s one thing the French know it’s food.  This is ten times better than the gruel they’re serving up on the Homefront. I was there with the Women’s Auxiliary until I was recruited by Special Operations under SIS.” She reminisced, reaching with one hand to tuck a spring of hair that had completely fallen loose from its roll behind her ear. There was something hyper feminine about it, enchantingly so given the juxtaposition of their surroundings.
"Please ignore me. It will fade," she insisted but Deiter ignored her and reached for his hand radio.
“Vienna, Graz, Berlin, everywhere! Does it matter at this point? I thought if I could keep Salzburg- but I have orders….” He trailed off, muttering furiously under his breath and making less and less sense, before his head snapped up once more, hope burning in his eyes as he begged. “You could speak to them. People listen-”
“It’s a love song, bambina.” He rubbed his face and translated the lyrics Bruce had sung for him in the dark.
“Yes, Frau Rogers was very fond of the outdoors.” Pepper remembered, certain fondness creeping into her tone that kept Tony feeling subdued. “Ian and James might remember something of how it’s done but the little ones… I’m afraid it has been some time since we’ve had time for swimming.”
Steve had met Peggy’s aunt May only once. She’d managed to make the trip after Péter was born, adamant that she be there for her niece when she knew Peggy’s mother would not be. But then again, May had understood Peggy better than her mother ever had, since she herself had traded the life of an affluent young woman for a love match with a poor Englishman.
"It’s war Tony. I don’t get to choose what happens. I thought I was being fairer to you, keeping my distance so that when… if the worst happened, you wouldn’t grieve. I’ve grieved. I’ve grieved till I was drowning in it…” Stefen swallowed thickly, his voice sounding strangled in his throat. His glassy eyes shifted away, no longer able to meet Tony’s, but he continued anyway. “But now I think I was really protecting myself. Only I couldn’t stay away. I’m not as good as you think I am.”
Sometimes Steve couldn’t tell whether he was the last rational man left in the entire household, or if he had slipped off some edge and lost his mind altogether. The worst part was he didn’t really care. It didn’t matter in the end if he was sane or not. The danger was all the same.
“Stefen, you terrible fool. They’ll take it all if you defy them this way. Can’t you see that?” The baroness sighed, relaxing slightly at the sound of father’s quiet tone. She shouldn’t relax, Natacha thought. Father was at his most angry when he was quiet.
Stefen bent and pressed his lips to the crown of Artur’s head, his soft head of hair tickling Steve’s cheeks, the clean and sweet
Tony watched those powerful arms as they rose and fell in quick breast stroke, watched his strong back supporting James, Artur or whichever child had won his attention that moment. He watched and watched, stomach tightening with a strange discomfort.
“We’re going to brunch with the Baroness.” Natacha supplied helpfully and Stefen nodded quickly, finding himself babbling.
“Danke, Frauline.” He closed the door pointedly in the young woman’s face and then frowned down at the tray in his hands.
Tony turned and situated Sara in her basket, tucking the braid Pepper had done up that morning back into her head scarf.
But Péter was not his father. He was skinny, had a bad heart, and still suffered from the occasional bout of cold induced asthma. He was so far behind in school his last tutor had told father he could not take the state exam, meaning he couldn't even go to the local college with the other boys his age if he wanted to.
No more. The thought came sudden and strong. No more. He could still hear the strains of Bucky’s violin if he concentrated hard enough, feel the parchment he used to sketch on scrape under his fingertips, smell the coffee and sweet scent of baked bread on the air.
The little girl who cried at dirt on her dress seemed far away now as she thrashed ungracefully in the water, smiling big and bright as water dripped into her mouth.
"It appears that the man they were sent to stay with proved to be a black hearted lout. The children have wisely run away from him. I was in the garden when I saw them at the gate. They must have walked all the way back from Voggenberg."
“An old friend of your Da, who you don’t talk about unless it’s to share some memory that makes me wish I knew how to beat the dead,’” Stefen returned with a pointed drawl and Tony was torn between scowling at his ill-timed perceptiveness or licking his lips because his gypsy was showing.
Tony was surprised Ian didn't shrink from the sudden onslaught, all three turning on him at once. Morons.  He took a step forward but was stopped when Stefen, who'd given the simplest of answers, amended as Ian’s eyes widened in fear.
“I defend the integrity of our academics; I don’t risk my life and all of yours. There’s a world of difference.”
“Sir, you've not heard? Can't take the main roads till tomorrow morning. Roads all torn up from the parades this week.”
"Don’t think insulting me is going to distract me. You think you can win here by playing the system? You can't. You saw what they did. They hosed up the blood, but they’re still clearing the glass off the street.”
Grief slashed through him, sudden and deep, like riding a bicycle and accidentally running into a post. He hadn’t touched the mandolin his grandfather had made him since he’d buried his wife but now he craved it. He wanted the weight of it in his lap and the smooth wood underneath his fingers. The same way it had always been, from his grandfather’s hands to his. He wanted Tony and the children surrounding the light of a campfire in the woods, while he and Bucky played the instruments Steve’s grandfather had made them. That was it. All he needed and wanted in the world.
Stefen’s door was firmly shut just as it always seemed to be since the arrival of the twins, and standing just outside it Tony could hear him speaking lowly to someone. Bakhuizen no doubt, the two of them neck deep in treason. And it was gratifying to know that he’d been right about Stefen in that regard, that he hadn’t just been projecting his own wants and wishes onto the man because of his own wayward heart but because Stefen well and truly believed in the things he was fighting for.
When the show wrapped, Natacha was one of the first out of her seat and Tony hid a grin as he stood and clapped with all the rest. The dancers took their bows, and the spell that had hung over the room for two hours began to break as the master of ceremony came on to remind them all of the curfew and urged them to get home safely. Even so, the feeling of walking within a dream lingered, hanging on like a sweet perfume in the air as they left with the crowd and began to make their way home. The streetlamps lit their way, illuminating the snowflakes drifting down lazily from the sky.
The fellow, a Herr Buchem, understood perfectly well what Bucky was getting at and agreed to meet Bucky outside the pub once every third day with any news or tidbits. That business settled, Bucky inquired with the barkeep about a room for rent and then made his way next door to the inn, where he rented a room for the night and left a number and instructions for getting in touch with his tailor, alerting them that he’d need his best suit sent to the post office.
“The class overflowed again.” She answered, reaching for her coat hanging on one of the hooks by the door. She got herself into it, barely pausing to finish. “I volunteered to help get the new room set up.”
“The wandervogel are dreamers. Silly children with backward thoughts who refused to grow up.” Natacha challenged and Tony smiled, because if she thought he was going to ask the children to start challenging the thoughts of others and then get mad when she challenged his, she was mistaken.
Becker watched, perplexed. He was used to the way Rogers hounded and demanded the best at all times from the men, but whatever hell fire had been lit under Major Rogers ass had to be burning strong because the fever fervor the man had subjugated them too this last week was inconvenient to say the least.
The door in the front hall rattled and both men froze. Tony’s heart hammered in his chest, ears straining for sound, his eyes watching Stefen as he did the same.
“It will be very dangerous… but I think you are right Captain Rogers, if Austria is too free itself from this madness then it is up to the people. We must cry out for liberty.” Franz stated with a level of conviction that seemed to suck the air from the room.
He snatched up one of three reports he still had to go over. Major Rogers’ careful type glared back at him. The black inked letters mocking him as his vision swam. Dvořák blinked and threw the report back down, rubbing his eyes harshly.
Right down to the furious way his lips tightened when he spotted Péter and his eyes took in Péter's swollen eye and the cuts on his face.
Which really had to be a damn lie, or at least kin to one Tony huffed. If that little display was anything to go by Stefan was just as powerful in the water as he was out.
Exhaling deeply Steve sagged against the railing, and thank god for it or he might have fallen. Head swimming dizzily, he imagined pitching forward to the floor below. The fall would be quick, and he didn’t mind the sound of that. Except Tony was down there and he’d have to see it.
An undercurrent of snickers passed over the room and Aleksy looked around, brow wrinkled in confusion and distress as she shrank in her seat. Most of what Natacha had said was lost on the Aleksy, but not on her siblings. James, the little troll, was chortling loudly into his hands, only quieting when Tony called for quiet.
Tony tried not to heave an aggrieved sigh but it was a near miss. Anina Broise was a fine singer, if you liked lovely and female. Those (unfortunately) where her only qualities. Tony maintained that a woman like her, better than her even, could be found in every lounge or concert hall across the country.
The tremors in Stefen’s muscles were slowly subsiding as the days went on, but he still found sleeping difficult. Even with such little strength, Stefen’s nerves often twitched and jumped as if his skin were trying to leave him. He would jerk himself out of sleep with a gasp of pain more often than not, so when he did manage continued sleep Tony was loath to wake him.
“Theys treating you right, ain they Tony?” Clint barked through a mouthful of cake, casting Hammer with a downright menacing glare. The butler actually paled, mouth opening in a silent o’ of apprehension and Tony hid a snicker in his cake. The Brothers had sure tried to polish the boy up and make something civilized out of him, but they’d not done any better at it with Clint than they had Tony.
Tony’s face cracked in a jubilant grin, his heart pounding as relief rushed through him in a dizzying swell, before he remembered to scrabble for the pen and pad he’d kept ready in wait and scribbled down everything he’d just heard.  The broadcast was short and to the point, repeated once and then cut out.
“They want me and the children to dance like monkeys, distracting the Führer’s audience from the trick happening right before their eyes.” Stefen grit out bitterly and Tony stroked his fingers gently over his collar bone in a silent bid to soothe.
As he spoke Tony ushered the children toward the table, gesturing toward his empty chair and frowning momentarily at the obvious predicament before turning toward Virginia in the doorway and saying, "Pepper, be a dear and bring us some extra place settings won't you?"
“They’re going to have to do more than cry before all is said and done.” Bucky grunted from where he sat on a stool by the window. Every few moments or so he would glance out it, keeping an eye on the streets below.
His lip curling Steve clawed at the damp stone underneath him, scraping his fingers until they ached. But no matter how hard he tried he couldn’t seem to push himself up. It didn’t stop him from trying.
From here, things certainly looked that way; but Tony couldn’t accept the inevitability of losing the children and laying down their lives in Hitler’s war. Certainly not lying down. Inevitable?
Tony could feel James glaring at his back but he was fine with it, amused even. He was no stranger himself with stealing food off of other people's plates (fasting had never been Tony's favorite way to applicate The holy father and unfortunately it was all the rage amongst monks) James was just sloppy at it. Fil would have caught James and had him cleaning out the old bee hives in the blink of an eye. And after Ian's show of (admittedly ridiculous) loyalty in taking the fall for James’ tantrum earlier that day, the boy ought to be far more gracious.
"Is that where you're from?" Péter asked curiously and she shook her head, mouth tightening in a dark scowl.
"It is. Yesterday, Frauline Werner had all the girls in our group line up. She measured us and took notes, then she had Sophie and me stand at the front. She had the girls point out our genetic strengths and weaknesses. Sophie's hair is blond and fine but her eyes are brown. My eyes are blue, like Father's, and my hair is red like the first Germans. My waist is perfect for child bearing but Sophie is too skinny for bearing healthy children."
“You need to break them up.” Steve stared at the man hard, one eye on the increasingly agitated crowd with fear tightening in his gut. “Before they become a mob.”
"How does it feel to be fifteen?" Tony asked turning back to Péter, finding himself very happy in the rare moment of peace between the four boys. Péter's chest puffed out a bit despite his nonchalant shrug.
“It was a trying day for all of us I think, not just the little ones… You weren’t well earlier.” Péter hedged and there was something too observant in his eyes, too knowing, that made Tony want to squirm. He’d been playing a dangerous game with his life saying the things he’d said to the children that day, giving in to a panic attack and all manner of erratic behavior when the reason why it was so important for him to stay in control was playing out right in front of him. Péter was an extremely intelligent boy and Tony had been
"Good yes, but good enough yet to sing for princes?" He shook his head doubtfully. "You'll have to work very hard to be ready for that."
“Now let’s see what we have here children. Once you’ve made your final selections I’ll take your measurements and tailor them to you.” To Steve she said, “If you give me the address to where you’re staying I can have my girl deliver them to you in the morning.”
"I'll be back." He repeated without inflection, and then he turned and was leaving, disappearing down the hall in long strides without looking back.
His throat was tightening again. He cleared it and looked back up at Bucky who was watching him closely.
He watched as Ian carried the tray over to the dressing table and set it down firmly, before straightening up and meeting Tony with an expectant stare and hands fisted on hips.
“Please, Péter. Won’t you ask him?” Artur begged prettily, tugging on Péter’s shirt sleeve. He didn’t seem to have any trouble begging Péter to stop being so stubborn where his father was concerned, Tony thought with fond amusement. “I want to hear Vati play the mandolin! It’s not fair everybody has heard it but me.”
Tony, Steve and the children escape Pola and head to France. Steve prepares himself to say goodbye to his children, and Tony plots for a future where they can all be together.
A voice inside asked. It sounded like her mother. Natacha could almost see her, standing at the cupboard door with her hands on her hips. The slight hint of a smile in the corner of her mouth betraying the strictness of her tone. Only mother was dead, and this time Natacha hadn’t sat on Harry Osborne for being a stupid braggart, she’d
There was no sight like the sight of Baroness Schrader carrying waste pans with her sleeves rolled up to her elbows and her hair falling out of a bun, but the woman just kept a polite smile firmly fixed and arched those dainty blond brows of hers whenever she caught Tony staring.
Tony had taught them all about the city they called home so Péter knew the history of the Jewish Quarter, a small section of Salzburg that at various points in the city's history had been the designated area for Jews.
Tony could feel disapproving eyes boring into him and he looked up to find Stefen watching him with a deep frown set on his face, eyes following the hand Tony held his glass with like he was contemplating batting it out of his hand.
Was that the way it was going to be between them? Tony with his walls (his damn secrets and the lies he told to keep them) and Steve ramming them down only for Tony to retreat behind another?
“Look up, so that I don’t see my neighbor fall beside me?” Tony flinched inwardly but he held Stefen’s stare. Blood for blood was only fair he supposed. But it stung to hear Stefen say, “perhaps you can live that way Tony, but I can’t live only concerned about my own survival.”
“Doing exactly what you taught him to do.” Tony interrupted with a growl, slapping Steve’s hand away from his chest. “He’s your son! Trying to prove he’s like
For Steve’s part he let it be known where he was staying and when the invitations to dinners and well to do lunches poured in he surprised Charlotte by being the one driving their social calendar for once. He sat through readings and even an opera on the sixth day.
Stefen was becoming predictable in his choice of intimate friendships. It was hard not to feel like the odd man out.
“Before the ink has dried on your dismissal papers,” she promised. “I can forgive your brash nature and your inappropriate refusal to address me by my proper name, but I will not let harm come to these children.”
“Melange?” Tony turned at the sound of Stefen’s voice to his right and nearly jumped, finding the man’s face much closer than he expected. The captain was leaning close to peer down at the contents of his cup. When his eyes flicked up to Tony’s he found them strangely intent. Too intent for coffee.
“Yes. He was a Jew. He was supposed to clean up the streets but he wasn’t any good at it. He made those boys mad so they punished him. They made him bleed.” James licked his lips as he furrowed his brow in deep concentration, staring hard at his father. “Is he like the snake in that story? The one those boys were bullying. Should we have stopped them?”
Unless... Steve’s eyes widened as the thought occurred to him. The possibility of her having feelings for him were slim to none. They had never been much more than friends and Steve was very aware that in recent years his friends had done more suffering through than enjoying his company.
Tony had come to their room that morning in a crisp pair of white trousers and a dark blue double-breasted jacket with gold buttons. He wasn’t wearing the hat, but James had peeked at enough of Ian’s stupid books about soldiers and other boring things to know what he was looking at and what it meant.
Toni tiptoes and presses a kiss on both of his cheeks, the last one deliberately too close to his mouth. She then turns around and heads back inside the mansion while texting, presumably to the people she's giving a lift to. She looks back at Steve one last time, while holding the entrance door, and they smile at each other, before she disappears out of his sight.
“I can’t believe I still have so much to take care of even when I’m not the official head of the company,” Toni huffs, opening the shirts closet. “Should I wear my Bruce Lee t-shirt or my Duran Duran t-shirt?”
“But we had to ask,” Hoch quickly interceded. “Young men make mistakes and the Führer is nothing if not forgiving. If you felt up to the opportunity, Obadiah assures us he’d be willing to work with you. Help refine what gaps in knowledge you might be missing. You do understand what’s at stake here don’t you Herr Stark? If you two were to succeed, you’d be awarded the highest honors.”
It would be unprofessional to roll his eyes but it was a near thing. Always so self-righteous in his martyrdom.
“General, the subject-I don’t- there is more testing to perform and I need the subject docile.” That other voice said, more anxious now, but the hand did not release him. Instead cool fingers slid down his throat grasping and squeezing his windpipe like a snake.
“What the hell is Stark up to now?” Bucky wondered at the scene. Steve wondered that himself as the children paused at the sight of the car, their expressions torn between excitement and anxiousness. Their wariness made something funny pull in Steve’s chest.
“The war in France is not going well.” She announced before she’d shrugging out of her coat. “Talk is, they’re on the retreat from the German forces. Of course, now they’re refusing to take refugees, feh! The Americas are still accepting some, but oy vey they are stingy with their limits. Shanghai opened its doors just in time. China. Can you imagine? I tell you, the lord in his wisdom.” She breezed through with a shake of her head, only stopping to drape her coat over the back of a kitchen chair. The next thing Tony knew she was squeezing him in a hug with impressive vigor for a woman of her years.
“We should go while we still have the cover of dark,” Steve instructed. He caught Pietro’s eye and inclined his head stiffly toward the door. The boy grabbed his sisters hand but didn’t move and Stefen’s heart tugged when Tony laid gentle hands on their backs and pushed them forward and followed Steve and Bucky as they made their way out toward where Harold waited with the car.
"Is it because of what Natacha said?" Ian asked next, casting an anxious look in her direction but when she made no motions to stop him, he went on. "The Germans don't like you because you don't listen. They know you won't do the bad things they're doing?"
Ian was sitting up in his bed, hair still spiked from where his head had rested on his pillow, sleepy befuddlement quickly turning to fear and alarm at the sight of Steve looming over his bed in the dark.
it. That uppity police captain had made it clear. They wouldn’t just take his word for it, though that had been incriminating for more than a few unlucky bastards out there.
The captain took a slow deep breath – the movement of his broad chest catching Tony’s eyes and making his hand burn enough to drop it.
He wasn’t naive. He knew houses like theirs had always run that way, and that some people thought there should be a greater distinction between the classes, but it was a new era. The Great War had made men equal in a way they hadn’t been before, and Péter’s parents had always approved of that change. The Klein’s had never been just staff here. They were friends, and weaved into the fabric of what had made the villa home. It must feel like a betrayal in some ways, to leave this way.
Zimmerman shrugged his shoulders and went back to his cards, his expression slowly morphing into irritation as he focused once more on his hand.  Steve wondered if Tony was any good at cards and then tried not to snort. It didn’t matter if Tony was any good at cards, Steve was sure he’d count them anyway.
Yes, if Stark Industries could actually produce even half of Hitler’s desires, the German Navy would have no trouble at all battering its way all the way to Britain’s shores and beyond, but one look was all Tony needed to know they’d never get there.
"It's over seven hundred miles between Dachau and Budapest." Tony pointed out, trying to keep some of the panic he felt out of his voice and hearing it bite instead. Stefen turned and looked at him with a flat expression, and said, "We know the dangers Tony.  But we can't leave those men there to die."
Khalmmer closed the door softly behind himself, and then came slowly into the room until he was standing behind Steve like a too large shadow. The silence between them was heavy with tension, and the hairs rose on the back of his neck.
“-study when you're finished. Ask Virginia for my whereabouts if I'm not.” Steve finished as if Bucky had not even spoken.
“How about two for the price of one?” he bargained. Honestly she was the daughter of a German officer, one on the rise at that. She should be fluent in more than German, no matter what the ideology was. It was just logical.
They had to wait a bit for the applause to die down after that, and the raucous shouting for an encore had Bucky looking to Tony questioningly, but Tony shook his head, jabbing his finger at the edge of the stage where Julia had reappeared, Stefen’s mandolin in hand. The captain also turned to look, and spotting it he visibly blanched, shooting Tony a look so desperate with worry he was sure Striker could see it from his table.
Steve staggered into the shower room, tripping over the bare heels of the men in front of him. The naked press of bodies continued to close in around him and he made a b-line for the nearest bench, crowding around it with ten or so other men. With only twenty minutes allotted for bathing he got to it. Quick scrapes with the soap, then passing it along to the next person. There was hardly enough time to scrub his genitals, let alone feel any sort of cleanliness from the frenzied action. His incisions stung, lighting up his skin from head to toe.
The edge of Rogers’ mouth twitched as if he might smile, but he seemed to know not to. He simply nodded, resting his other hand briefly upon the younger boy’s shoulder and departing with a gentle squeeze.
And then he moved around Tony, leaving him there blinking after him sluggishly before the normally quick witted monk finally realized the captain intended to answer the phone, conversation done.
The days fell into a routine, which finally broke as the longest hardest December that Tony could remember neared its end and Christmas loomed. Pepper’s urging for Tony to start taking better care of himself had escalated, resulting in her and Stefen ganging up on him to guilt him into taking a few hours here or there to see to his own needs. The early days of Stefen’s recovery had required so much of his constant attention that everything including regular meals and sleep had fallen to the wayside. Even though Stefen was through the worst of it they still had to be vigilant. The experience had compromised his system in ways they might not even discover for years.
“That so?” Bucky laughed swinging at Steve’s weaker side. He countered the blow, grappling for Bucky’s shoulder in order to pull him in close and bring his knee up.
He shot up in bed, realizing suddenly that he was not hearing the sounds of a live bird but those of a clock. The pale light outside the window told Tony what the clock already had. It was morning and the staff at the inn would be arriving soon. He was still in Captain Rogers bed.
The captain landed with a thump on the bed his voice cracking out of him as he continued to issue orders.
“Not sad… just missing someone.” As far as explanations went Tony knew it was paltry, but Ian didn’t seem to need much more than that.  Tony took a fortifying sip of his espresso, surprised and delighted by the sweet smell of chocolate that enveloped him as he drew the cup closer to his nose and the rich flavor burst over his tongue on the first sip.
What would that other Stefen Rogers have said and done, if he was walking here in the golden light of autumn with the man he loved?
Charlotte was not excluded from that, but the captain had suffered bouts of madness before and come back from them. Surely, he would again? Perhaps, James would come back soon (he always did) and he’d drag Stefen out of his room and make him smile again with his crass jokes.
Tony’s door was still locked. From that moment in Hasenkamp’s office Steve had been wrapped in a cloud of red hot focus, it narrowed his vison, kept him calm when he wanted nothing more than to throw caution to the wind. That tight grip on his control was unraveling as he fumbled with the key, trying to jam it into the lock and not succeeding because of the unsteadiness of his hands.
“Virginia?” He snapped, worry tightening his gut once more, his hand itching to reach for the pistol tucked into his jacket.
. No imagination. Always depending on what was in front of them and not what could be. “The metal I developed is strong and lightweight. Why not use that?” he smirked, enjoying drawing out the other man’s discomfort.
But Tony had no time to take himself apart or let himself cry and worry about the future. What right did he have to do any of that? His future was set wasn’t it? He was safe because Hughard had falsified his birth documents and paid the right public official to ignore it. He was safe because Hughard had sent him to St. Péter’s abbey and to the world, Antony Stark was just an ordinary monk. Tony was safe because he was Captain Roger’s lover. He got to sit in the lap of luxury, safe and comfortable, while better men risked their lives.
The ballroom had mostly emptied, the late stayers drifting to the parlor room for drinks and smokes and more intimate conversations. Which only made it that much more obvious really that Stefen had gone missing. Again. That had been just fine with him, at first. Christmas or no, familia or no, Bucky still itched to put Stefen’s head through a wall every time they were forced to be in the same company for more than three minutes. He was angry. That's just how it was.
A sane man would have just started running, hands bound or no, but Steve was not sane. Had not been sane for weeks. He thought nothing of turning around to stare at Dvorak, even with the sound of gunfire in the forest behind them and the mystery of his transport crashed amid the trees and all of his jailer's dead, save one.
"I do know. I'll make sure of it." He answered, turning from the window, from the children, toward the car where his captors waited. Fancy title. Fancy uniform. But it was all just smoke. He was as much a prisoner as Stefen was, his cage was just more comfortable. He could only imagine what hell they were putting Stefen through right now. Except if he did, he knew he'd go mad with it, and he couldn't fail the children that way. He wouldn't let Stefen down. He'd do what he had to in order to keep them safe. Whatever it took.
He batted away the voice of doubt, sounding painfully like Stefen in his head. Tony knew the risks. And it would be riskier still with the younger children, but the alternative was worse. Worse was keeping the children holed up like animals, living on fear and crippled by ignorance, playing god and giving them no chance without him.
“The Pope is adamant that Italy must not be like the Germans, who would resort to slaughtering their own people, but Germany insists nonetheless Italy must get rid of her Jews.” Grig began, speaking lowly with a furtive glance toward the house. The children would be waking up and sitting down to breakfast by now. “They’re allowing us to form a delegation, so that we can work with domestic and foreign allies to assist Jewish families with emigration.”
“Shut up!” someone hissed in warning from behind him. Steve loped on his unsteady feet ignoring them and shaking Herschel's shoulder roughly. “Don't! You’ll get sick.”
“Do you mind?” Tony gestured at the pieces. He perhaps should have asked before, but better to ask forgiveness and all that.
Tony sighed with pleasure after the first sip, the aromatic smell of it thick in his nose even as the sweet nutty flavor flooded his tongue. He’d say one thing for the Rogers household, their kitchen stocked some of the best coffee he’d tasted in years. The coffee at the abbey was steps away from being declared an actual sin against God (Tony should know; he’d written the petition and sent it off to His Holiness himself).
Farkas steepled his fingers together, observing Tony stoically for a moment as if he were looking under his skin, before he decided to answer.
“But there are too many variables, too much chance you’ll miss or get taken down before you can take the shot. You’ll be dead and that will be it. There will be no chance left for your girls.” he pressed, holding Dvorak’s stare. “The Reich won’t be stopped by one man, Dvorak, but hundreds. The same people whose morale will take a brutal blow when the symbol of their hope is crushed right before their eyes. You think Hitler isn’t afraid of those people? He wants them broken.”
The old man… Péter could still see his eyes, hear the sound of boots thudding against his flesh… he’d never seen anything like that before. It had scared the little ones… and rightly so. But he couldn’t be scared. There was a reason behind what Johann and Bobby had done, even if it had been a frightening thing to witness. That was part of being an adult. You had to protect yourself, protect the people you loved, because there were bigger and scarier things out there.
“This could change the course of history Tony.” The agent pointed out unnecessarily. “After what you did at Dachau I thought – ”
It all happened in flash. Bucky knocked his hand away, swinging his other fist with the intent to hit him square in face. Stefen twisted out of the way, stumbling backward and Sara cried out, sliding off the chair in a tumble of blankets. Shouting, Tony saw it happening and lunged over Ian to try and stop him. There was a scrape and clatter as Ian scrambled out of the way and fell out of his chair.
Tony looked away, unable to face the intense scrutiny of the captain’s eyes and picked up his cup once more. He could tell that Stefen wanted to ask him things but Tony was thankful when he didn’t. It was impossible to speak on this subject without remembering his own lonely childhood but this wasn’t about him. He could have admitted to Stefen that he’d heard the end of his conversation with Herr Bakhuizen, could have pressed the man to think of his children’s welfare and send them abroad already to secure his own wellbeing.
When Tony and Péter arrived at the news office, the secretary was skeptical about letting them in on the grounds of a spontaneous school lesson, but once Péter made noise about his budding enthusiasm for journalism and Tony hinted at a sizeable donation from the captain, they were let inside with astonishing swiftness. The chief editor, who introduced himself as Herr Soren Bischoff, came out himself to give them the tour, and it wasn't even half boring. Péter was perfectly enthralled with the busy news room, and they were both excited by the printing press and eager to see the inner workings of the dark room.
"Captain," Pepper greeted Stefen with a prim curtsey, Willamina following wordlessly. "Is there something you needed?"
The air of excitement in the room intensified ten-fold but the children seemed to instinctively know to keep quiet, their eyes watching their father carefully as he continued to eat. Stefen acted as if he hadn’t even heard Tony, his movements unhurried as he lifted fork to mouth and chewed.
“Major Rogers is not a civilian, and he was already taking his own risks.” Coulson pointed out calmly. “Though what happened with the coup was regrettable.”
Steve swung around as Maria appeared from behind a group of women in sparkling dresses, her eyes wide with excitement. He intercepted her in one jerky motion, crouching down to her eye level, his hands clutching at her waist. Before he could say a word or chastise her for disappearing - as if it were her fault he’d failed to keep eyes on her - Maria shoved something small and wooden into his face.
“Dark hair, medium height, her face was made up. The lips were red. She had a dark coat on. He says Pisani seemed
The music room. Steve was livid about the little trip Tony had taken the children on but for some reason it was hearing that Tony had disobeyed this particular order that rubbed the rawest.
“I was born in Austria myself Major Rogers. You’ve been a fascination of mine for many years and a subject of much study.”
No Tony. Where had he gone? Damn it! Logically Steve knew Tony couldn’t be far, it hadn’t been that long since he’d last seen him, he was most likely off seeing to personal needs, but it didn’t stop the anxiety from clawing at him to know where Tony had gone.
“Does he know?” With a swell of anger Bucky jerked his head toward Stark. “Does he know what that means?”
He turned back to the little girl and, on a whim asked, “comment ca va?” Testing out the theory of her French blood.
“What’s the delay here?” Tony demanded as he ran up, huffing for breath and trying to look suitably terrified and indignant.
Tony craned his neck with the others to see who had spoken and smiled when he saw Joshua, standing up from the table he was sharing with his wife and sons. Cameron was helping him to pull an accordion out of a black music case beside his father’s feet. At the sight of it cheers of enthusiasm broke out among the other guests.
Oh and his command voice too! Even if it weren’t the best damn thing for Steve, Bucky would have dug his heels in just for that. When was Steve going to realize that had never worked on him?
“I don’t hear anything now.” Bakhuizen replied shortly, his cold dead eyes pinning Jürgen in place like something out of the pictures and he backed up a step, a shiver going down his spine.
Sagging with relief, Tony turned and nodded to Péter, trotting over to help him collect his siblings, his own heart beginning to pick up speed in his chest as he traded one anxiety for the return of another. It had been hours in those barrels. In the cold. God they must be near frozen. If only they’d been able to procure wool instead of thin burlap!
pungent in his nose, and then he heard it, the sound of low groaning that seemed to pull him forward like a magnet until he’d walked halfway to the bed without realizing it.
Tony blurted out the first thing that popped into his mind and watched as the first hint of real emotion cracked the cool expression that Bucky wore, surprise and palpable grief flashing through his eyes before he shut it away.
Stefen exhaled softly next to him and Bucky became aware of a strange tension in the air. He looked up to find Stefen staring out over the water… but no, his gaze was fixed slightly lower than that, watching Stark fixing the boats down by the water’s edge the same way he was.
Bucky let out a breath of smoke and turned away from the window, setting off with a brisk pace but not a frantic one. Not a run just yet. He strained his ears and heard it when the guy got out of the car. The car door shut with a thunk that carried on the quiet street. Bucky didn’t slow, didn’t look back to give away that he’d heard or he was paying attention. He threw aside the stub that remained of his smoke, reaching inside his coat again under the guise of fishing out another. His fingers wrapped around the handle of his Colt and the frantic pulse drumming in his ears began to settle.
“Natacha was wrong. You know that, right bambino? Ian loves you.” Tony murmured tiredly, resuming his stroking of James’ head. “He’s not showing it well now, but you hurt him.”
Tony had sent Antonia back to the family two days prior with a letter to the children, reassuring them of his love and how their fortunes would soon improve. A risk perhaps, but he doubted Stanislov’s man was bold enough to stop her and search her person even if he did recognize her from her previous visit.
Tony hadn't been seriously drunk in a long time, but after leaving Péter and the others he’d felt a thirst the likes he hadn’t felt since his first year at the monastery.
“They believe so. The rebels were pursued. Both parties crashed, and there are no known survivors.” Khalmmer recounted slowly and the bottom fell out of Steve’s stomach. “Frankly the fires from the crash ran so hot they can’t confirm whether which of the bodies they found belong to the traitors and which belong to our men. It’s an unpleasant situation….” Khalmmer trailed off, concern flickering over his face as he took in the way blood had drained from Steve’s face and the tight grip he had on his glass.
but there was no fixing to be done. Only escape. Tony followed her lead and went back to his work helping Ian.
He was hiding something. Dvořák wasn’t sure if it was important enough for him to care. If it was personal then that was what it was, it had nothing to do with him.
If Stefen had held any grand plans for how they’d spend the following day, free from any and all obligations, they seemed to have been cast out the window in favor of sleeping the morning away in Tony’s bed. They got a minor fright in the morning when the girl had come with breakfast, jerking them from their sleep. But thankfully the maids knew better than to enter without being bid entry.
“Bucky, we’re in public!” he ground out but Bucky, almost as incorrigible as the child Steve had named after him, continued on louder than before, uncaring of their potential audience.
Steve watched the door swing shut, heard the lock slide into place and swallowed back the return of the lump in his throat. Brave woman.
Steve had been on his way to his study, still on edge from a meeting with General Schmidt. Try as he might he hadn’t been able to shake the uneasiness the meeting had left him with. Steve had looked up from his papers to see Artur sitting on his knees next to Maria in the garden brandishing that stick. He’d heard his son's voice, still sweet with youth, start to sing and thwack the bushes, his little arm swinging the stick in sharp arcs. The body of the bush shaking and spasming violently, and all the while Artur was singing. Singing and stabbing.
Yes he’d be just fine with that: regulated to the kitchens with the cook Willamina and the other night staff. It was better there anyway, to be in the kitchens with the room to move about freely without the social constructions of a formal dinner weighing on your shoulders. He’d always hated formal dinners.
“Lovemaking? I’m not delicate Tony,” Stefen scoffed, and as if to make his point for him the rise and fall of his breath pushed the rigid evidence of his lingering desire against Tony’s ass. Warmth curled in Tony’s belly, his groin tightening, and he bit back a grin.
But, Tony thought, resolved once more, this was his fight (and what would be would be). It was a small thing perhaps: change one family, change seven young lives (hopefully for the better) and take them back from the hands of those who had taken his own family. A fool’s rebellion maybe. But his.
“Did I win Tony? I was very quiet, wasn’t I?” Sara asked inquisitively, her round face scrunched up with uncertainty, searching for approval.
But the sight that met him upon popping the lock and opening the door was not any he could have prepared himself for. The attic was dark but a small pair of windows let in the sporadic flashes of lightning that lit up the night sky.
“None of our options are good Bucky, but the honeymoon is the best one we have.” Steve pleaded with his back.
Crossing back to his open trunk he reached for a stack of trousers. He paused, clutching them in his hands as he took a breath. You don’t get anything without effort.
Steve stared hard at her but she didn’t appear at all ruffled by it, meeting his gaze evenly as she clicked toward them on her low heels.
From downstairs somewhere, the sound of a piano started up again, hesitant, with plenty of fumbles but not a completely unpleasant sound.
Just one truck with two individuals was better odds than it could have been, but not great. They’d gotten here before Tony could and there was a chance the other children were trapped inside. He’d left Péter on lookout. Had he seen the truck coming with enough time to get the others and flee to the woods? Tony’s eyes moved up to the loft. The window shutters were still tightly closed. If Péter and the others had escaped into the woods it hadn’t been from the loft, and with the chance that they might still be inside Tony couldn’t just sit and do nothing.
“It does look that way, doesn’t it?” And when the captain opened his mouth to speak once more Tony tilted his head and beat him to the punch. “I’m afraid I’ve never been much of a follower, so when I find fault in your orders, and I usually do, I am forced to follow my own judgement.”
So Virginia had gone behind his back and contacted Bucky before Steve could get around to it. From the looks of the postdate it had to have been a few hours after he’d returned home. He couldn't decide if he was annoyed or impressed. Judging by his insults and thinly veiled orders she must have told him about the assault, something Steve had decidedly left out of their phone call.
Tony looked out and spotted Striker sitting amongst a row of fellow S.S. officers sitting near the front, his eyes glued on Stefen like a hunter watching prey and Tony shivered. But he only realized what Stefen was really about a moment later when he raked his eyes over the crowd a final time and happened to spot Beultin in the back of the room, almost in the shadows, speaking intently to an unfamiliar man in a non-descript suit. The pieces were moving, and Stefen was making sure he held Striker’s attention.
But until then, ladies from the German Labor Force were meant to visit today for Kaffee und Kuchen. If Stefen did not have the kindness to pull himself together, it was up to Charlotte to prop up the family image.
