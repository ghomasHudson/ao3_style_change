Sherlock turned his face to look at his brother, asking him, Sherlock, for a favour.  A big favour.  One he couldn’t get from anyone else.
The ice cube traced down his neck, and Sherlock seemed to love lapping and sucking up the icy trail of water off his hot skin.  It was so good, the cooling of his skin, followed by that warm, attentive mouth.  Soft licks across his skin.
John ran his hands over the pleasing roundness of Sherlock’s ass.  It was one of the things he found most attractive on his flatmate.  Sherlock knew it, wearing tight trousers perfectly tailored to show it off.
He just hoped it would go that way.  The staff had worked hard the last few weeks, making the house and grounds look better than ever.  The guest list was scrutinized by Sally and Greg, having the best in attendance.  No potential clients tonight.  They had all done what they could to prepare.
He could only hope that tonight would.  Dressed in immaculate black tie, Sherlock knew he looked his best.  He had come into his own after turning thirty, getting some muscles over his skinny frame, his face becoming a bit less angular, in better balance with his eyes and prominent cheekbones.
“You were just as into the cases as I was, and shot a guy for me,” Sherlock continued.  “I think everything changed for me from then on.”
John was feeling a bit tired now, from the exercise and the warmth of the tea and the fire.  He shifted sideways in his chair, extending his warm, dry-socked feet towards the fire, and almost sighed at good it felt.  Now just to shut up his whining flatmate for a bit so he could have a nap before dinner.
John turned, facing one of his former patients, Russell.  Seeing him always sent a surge of old emotions John had to repress, struggling to keep his expression neutral.  The man had been a frequent client of Sherlock’s when John first worked in the house as a doctor.
John’s heart was beating faster from stress and anticipation by the time they stopped in front of Mycroft Holmes.  Claire introduced the man to John, and smiled as she departed.
John was distracted from his thoughts when Sherlock reached over into the bowl and pulled out an ice cube.  It was something they had played around with last summer, but hardly something new.  John relaxed, reaching over for one of the towels they kept nearby.  Something else they’d learned in the last year.
Sherlock was shocked for a few seconds, but then wrapped his arms around John tight.  John grunted at that, swearing softly and shifting to be in even fuller contact, sinking against him.  Sherlock wasn’t just warm now, he burned.
This was so different.  Having a partner concentrating on his pleasure so much.  Taking such enjoyment from it.  John smiled, pulling Sherlock closer for a deep kiss.
Sherlock felt like he had been punched, the attack affecting him more than he expected it to.  He took a few breaths, regrouping.  “So good, one of the most prominent widows of the country frequently requests my counsel.”
He ran a hand along Sherlock’s right arm, feeling the muscles shifting with his strokes.  “Fuck, this is like my own private sex show.  A beautiful man, lost in his pleasure.  Sweaty.  Tasty...,” he leaned closer to lick at a drip of sweat running down Sherlock’s neck.
“Um,” John said, shifting on the step, “I really should get home.  Rosie will be wanting to try her cupcake.”  He held up a clear plastic container with a pink frosted treat inside, tied up with large blue ribbon.
“What would that involve?” Sherlock asked, his eyes going down to John’s lips in a most distracting way.
Sherlock grinned at the pieces, his eyes lighting up with an idea, and he put them in his mouth.  John could see his cheeks bulging a little on each side, the only warming before Sherlock took him deep into his mouth.
John could only grin to himself and nibble on some shortbread as the four Holmes got involved in an intense discussion about germ theory.  They were surprisingly well read on the topic, even Mycroft.  He could have added more to their conversation, but held back.  This was about the four of them.
Sherlock dropped down on to the bed, still breathing hard, sweaty and flushed.  His limbs were slack and completely relaxed now, in a way John rarely saw him.
Fuck.  John closed his eyes at those words, feeling a surge of pure desire shoot through him.  “Yes, anywhere,” he replied, his voice a bit strangled.
Now, he eased in slowly, knowing Sherlock would take the first few inches easily, but the rest would be much harder.  He didn’t want to overwhelm Sherlock, have him think it was too much.  The thickness was the initial challenge, and John made sure he was well lubed, using shallow thrusts as Sherlock relaxed more and more.  He wanted it, pushing back against John, groaning at the intense sensations.
John sighed, and took off his own winter gear.  He had a thick parka, but found it a bit too heavy to wear snow shovelling.  It was hard physical work that got his heart pumping and warmed him up.  A thick jumper, a scarf, gloves and thick boots were all he usually wore for this.  They were soon stored away neatly, and John headed up the stairs, carefully avoiding stepping on the wet spots with his dry socks.
His nipples got teased mercilessly, Sherlock fascinated by how hard and tight they became under the ice, and sucking them eagerly, warming him, making the nipple soften to a more normal state.  Repeating it again and again, until John was arching off the bed, panting with need.  “Fuck, Sherlock, your mouth,” he groaned, at the combination of sucking, licking and light biting.
Sherlock moaned, his head hanging down as he pushed back towards John.  “Fuck.  Yes, yes, John,” he begged breathlessly.
Mycroft drew on his coat, doing up the buttons.  “Very observant, little brother.  Thank you for the opportunity to see the operation you have here.  Over the years, I have been in places in the same line of business as this, but have never seen one run so effectively.”
John put his hands on his shoulders, centring Sherlock before him again.  “You look perfect.  Almost too good.  I’m tempted to muss you up.”  He leaned in, giving him a light kiss.
But instead it was a calm, serene setting.  Mycroft rose from a sofa as they drew near.  “Goodnight, Miss Davenport.  Good to meet you.”
Sherlock stood before his brother, his posture straight.  Ready for more harsh words.  “So, you are leaving.”
“There you are,” John said loudly, acting like he hadn’t overheard anything.  It took a lot, steeling his face to appear neutral as the brothers straightened and turned towards him.
John let out a chuckle, drawn towards him.  “Sorry, just ignore me.  I’m in a funny mood,” John said, a weak excuse.
“Sherlock, please,” he replied, pulling John into a hug.  “How about Rosie takes over your old bedroom?”
From then on, after rugby practices, he would check out other men in the showers.  He looked the same.  Eventually, on a drunk night, a friend explained it all.  John was not a grower.  His erect penis got slightly thicker, but did not change much in length.  After that, he kept sex focused on his partner, hiding his cock from direct view and wandering hands.  He developed his techniques.
Dipping his head down, John captured Sherlock’s lips in a deep, hungry kiss.  Almost immediately, he felt Sherlock’s arms and legs wrap around him, pulling him in closer.  John couldn’t help but groan at feeling something hard pressing against his hip.
He wished he could be there at Sherlock’s side, supporting him.  Arguing on his behalf.  Pushing Mycroft to go past the incorrect assumptions most of society had about Sherlock Holmes, the infamous Courtesan.  Make him see him as the intelligent, caring and successful man he was now.  Be as proud of him as John was.  But this was Sherlock’s fight, and John could only support him before and afterwards.
“It’s not that,” John stated firmly.  “You are good with her.  It’s just I don’t want to move her and then have things not work out.  She’s been through so much lately, she needs some stability.”
“Yes.  No sex or as much as you want. I just want to be with you,” John said, and meant it. He hasn’t dated anyone for a few months.  Maybe it was a part of getting older, and not needing sex as much.  He could take care of his own needs.
The weather experts kept promising thundershowers to cool everything off, but it just made the air humid.  Things didn’t even cool off much at night.  He hadn’t been sleeping that deeply.
She immediately shook her head.  “It’s why I’m standing here.  So I can see when he comes in, and signal to my staff.”
A/N:  This isn't really a kink of mine, but it was brought up in a Johnlock Facebook group, and this fic idea popped out of that.  I can see John being such an attentive lover, using his hands, mouth and toys to blow his lovers' minds, that he still earns the 'Three Continents Watson' name.
The sofa wasn’t that wide, so of course they were in full contact along the length of their bodies.  John felt a surge of awareness with this, but was also almost instantly aware that Sherlock’s body was colder than his own.  Swearing, he wrapped his arms around the man tightly.  “You damn fool,” John grumbled, his face pressed against Sherlock’s shoulder.
They pulled back the covers, laying down, and turned to face each other.  John moved first, kissing Sherlock and pushing his hands into his hair.  It quickly became more intense than the other times they had kissed, and John pulled back, breathing fast already.  They had amazing chemistry and he didn’t want to overwhelm Sherlock.  Take it too fast.
Nodding at the women, John walked briskly towards the veranda.  He slipped out.  It was a mild autumn night, fully dark now, with lanterns along the paths lighting the way.  Many couples walked along them, wanting time alone, away from the party.
John scoffed.  “You really have a selective memory.  Have you already deleted from your Mind Palace how much you were complaining about being cold an hour ago?”
“Good.  Because you are doing that to me tomorrow,” Sherlock said, stretching out beside John, looking like the cat that got the canary.
His vulnerability had John gathering him close, hugging him hard.  “You never have to see him again.  Shall we ask Lestrade to get his strongest men to throw him out?”
Kneeling between Sherlock’s legs, John kissing and stroking all over his back, just lost in it.  Sherlock shifted a bit underneath him, and John lost his balance a bit, falling against his ass.  Even though they were both wearing underwear, they both froze.  John was hard, and he was sure Sherlock could feel it.
“No!  I certainly am not!  To be treated in such a manner on a public street!” The detective huffed, his upper crust privilege coming out more strongly than normal.
“You’re doing so good, baby.  You feel so hot and tight,” John said, pressing a few kisses on Sherlock’s upper back.
“Feeling warmer now?” he asked, rolling his shoulders and curling his back into a stretch.  His stomach gave a bit of an empty grumble.  Time to make dinner.
“Man, you look so good like this.  I can’t tell you how many times I fantasized about you over the years.  Trying to picture you having sex.  Trying to imagine you jerking off.  But it never looked as good as this,” John whispered, his mouth close to Sherlock’s ear, looking down his body at his large hand moving in a steady rhythm over that hard, beautiful cock.  One that he had sucked and fucked so many times.
His mother was silver-haired also, with it swept into an elaborate updo.  She was slightly pudgy, sitting down gingerly on the seatee with her husband.  What struck John the most were her eyes, which matched Sherlock’s exactly.
He headed back to the ballroom, still full of many wealthy and influential people in society.  Unashamed of being seen in the home of the notorious Courtesan.  This was an invitation only gathering people worked hard to come to.
Those sage green eyes flicked upwards to meet John’s, a smirk on his lips.  “My libido seems to be limited to army doctors that I live with.”
Arching an eyebrow, John pinned him with steady gaze. “What about Irene Adler?  Something was going on between you.”  It had bothered him like crazy, and he had been so jealous.  Counting those stupid moaning text alerts.
Sherlock thought about it, really thought about it.  He had been raised by nannies, went to boarding school for half his childhood, and then to university.  He had travelled in Europe afterwards, and started down the unfortunate path that led him here.
“Would you roll over?” John asked gently.  Sherlock had explored his shoulder scars thoroughly, and he wanted to do the same for his back.  In a way, allowing these marks from the past to be touched in such an intimate way was a way of accepting the other’s past.  Acknowledging it.  Knowing how bad it had been, how painful, and showing they weren’t bothered by it.
John resisted kissing him again.  They needed to talk it out.  “Um, well, being exclusive.  Not dating other people-“
Mycroft just showed a pleasant expression as he wrapped a scarf around his neck, and drew on gloves.
Sally gave a small shrug.  “They are both unlikely to show much in public.  Far too restrained for that.”
-A/N:  Thank you for reading!  This little sequel wasn't really needed, but there were some comments asking for more about the relationship between Mycroft and Sherlock, and I decided to explore it.
“We could have an elegant dinner party, full of the best guests and food.  Wine and dine him, make him wait until afterwards for a private audience with you.  Let him see you for the man you are now,” John added.
John loved the reaction, and knew Sherlock was getting close.  “Mmmmm yes.  I want to watch you cum, Sherlock.  Wrap my hand over yours as you stroke out each shot, covering your chest with thick stripes.  Make a good mess for me to lick up.  Lick you clean.  Want every drop.”
Sherlock moved to be on his side, facing John.  “I think we needed that time as just flatmates and friends.  Getting to know each other so well.  When you finally kissed me, it just felt so right.”
“Let’s take it slow.  We can figure this out together,” John said, breathing a bit harder as Sherlock moved back to kissing near his ear.
John touched the scars, and then kissed them all.  Sherlock had been tense at first, but by the end, he was relaxed, and breathing harder.  John loved his reactions, his small moans and gasps.
He had the upper hand for sure.  It took a lot for Mycroft to send the letter, to show up here tonight, to mostly act civilly.  This was The Moment.  He had the power to say yes or no, to make a huge difference in his brother’s life, his professional future.
Her eyes widened at the question, more direct than most people would dare.  She straightened to her full height, her gaze unflinching.  “That is correct, sir.”  Her tone was stern, almost challenging.  A mama bear defending her cubs.
She levelled a knowing look at each of them in turn.  “And what I just saw?  Was that you giving Sherlock his birthday present?”
He was looking better.  His skin had a healthy colour back, his eyes were clear, and he’d had a good enough appetite to eat two cupcakes during their visit with Molly.
Scoffing, Sherlock unlocked the door, and waved John inside.  He shut and locked it behind them before answering.  Some things just needed privacy.
-"It's not the size of the boat nor the motion of the ocean, it's whether or not the Captain can stay in port long enough for all the passengers to get off." is from someecards.com.
Mrs. Hudson tilted her head slightly, obviously wondering what he was getting at. “That is correct.  He started his own practice.  Did you want to see him as a patient?”
Turning his head, Sherlock looked down at John warmly.  “But it was different with you from the start.  You kept saying how brilliant I was at that first crime scene, and in the cab, and it wasn’t faked to just have sex with me.”
-Queen Victoria:  She was the Queen from 1937, at age of 18, to her death in 1901.  After her beloved husband died in 1861, “Victoria plunged into deep mourning and avoided public appearances. As a result of her seclusion, republicanism in the United Kingdom (the political movement of moving from a monarchy to an elected head of state) temporarily gained strength, but in the latter half of her reign, her popularity recovered.” (Wikipedia)
Chuckling, John thought fondly back on the their first meeting in the lab at St. Bart’s.  “I already know about your violin playing and not talking for days when you are in your mind palace.  Or do you have some new bad habit?”
“Does he always change so much?  Throwing insults at you, and an hour later calmly inviting us for a meal?” John finally said to Sherlock quietly, as they headed back to their wing.
John had been hard for what felt like ages, so into pleasuring Sherlock, to make the experience as good as he could.  His erection had faded a little, but quickly came back completely.  He groaned, clutching at Sherlock’s head as he sucked and licked.
They made their way back towards their wing, John’s arm slung along Sherlock’s lower back, their heads close together as he explained what had happened.  At the lab, Sherlock pulled out some clean glass slides, and they smeared tiny samples from the test tube on them.
John almost jumped when he felt something pressing against his thigh.  Realizing what it was, he glanced over at Sherlock.  Was this a thing now?  Was he going to let Sherlock tuck his feet under his leg whenever they were sitting close to each other in the living room?
Sherlock sat up, pulling the blanket over his body.  John sighed, and did the same. The mood had been totally spoiled now.  He took Sherlock’s hand in his, and was happy that he allowed it.
“Next you’ll be telling me about people  sleeping in the same sleeping bag to stay warm,” Sherlock said, rolling his own eyes.
“Fuck, yes,” John said softly, cuddling closer to kiss his neck.  Loving the scent of sweat and sex on him. He watched as Sherlock swept the lube over his hard cock.  “Mmmmm that is so hot.”
With his other hand, John cupped Sherlock’s cock, stroking fast with lots of lube.  He knew the signs, knew Sherlock was close, and just wanted it to be great for him.  “That’s it, baby.  Give it to me.”
He started with his neck, kissing slowly all over it, like he had wanted to for ages.  By the time he kissed Sherlock’s collarbone, he was already breathing faster, and shifting restlessly on the bed.  John claimed his arms next, stroking his smooth skin, kissing down along it.  Licking the thin skin of his inner elbow, feeling the pulse beneath his lips jump.  Massaging his hands, those long fingers.
a result if you are trying something new on me?”  He had learned to get full explanations and examine the facts closely before agreeing to Sherlock’s schemes.
Rolling his eyes at his flatmate’s disregard for his transport, John turned to face him.  “What you wear is fine when it’s above freezing, but when the temperature drops, you should really wear the boots and layer with a jumper.”
I imagine Sherlock giving her good, unbiased information, as he seeks no personal gain of money or power from her.  He also advised on who she have around her, using his deductions and investigative skills to weed out the greedy gits, and bring better people into her sphere.
John grinned, glad that Sherlock wasn’t having any post-sex regrets.  “The weatherman said this cold snap could  be around for the rest of January.”
John nodded.  “I won’t do anything you haven’t done with me, OK?  Just exploring your body.  Getting to know what you like.”
John stretched out beside Sherlock.  His breathing was back to normal, his eyes closed.  “Are you OK?”
“Well, Mycroft is at least seeing the full scope of Sherlock’s success and influence here.  When they do talk in private, I think it will go better than their last meeting,” John said.
“They have some British training bases there,” John said with a shrug.  “I learned how to treat hypothermia.  Saw some cases of it.”
John awoke to bliss.  A warm body pressed along his own, an arm draped over his chest, and lips planting teasing kisses against his neck.  John moaned softly, shifting closer.
John nodded and urged Sherlock further into the room.  “Let’s talk with our guests like we normally do.  I’ll watch Sally for her signal.”
Mycroft shook John’s hand, his grip firm but not too tight.  His gaze was direct and assessing, his eyes a deeper green, with more hazel tones, than his brother’s. “Dr. Watson, I have heard much about you.  Pleased to finally meet you.”
“Woo hoo,” Mrs. Hudson called out, knocking once before opening the door.  “I just finished this shortbread.  It’s best hot from the oven.”
The comment put a warm glow deep in John’s chest, and he smiled in return.  It felt amazing that they had been together this long, and still felt so strongly about each other.  “When this night is over, we will test that theory.”
John had prepped him thoroughly, with lots of lube and working his fingers in gradually.  He teased Sherlock lots, occasionally stroking his cock or rubbing more firmly on his prostrate.  Working him up to this perfect, almost delirious state of desire.
He had several long term girlfriends that he had eventually allowed to explore him more fully.  They had been kind, giving him head or an occasional fuck, but he could tell they weren’t really into it.  Doing it out of duty mostly.  Instead, he used his mouth, hands and toys to keep them satisfied, and quickly took care of himself.
“I was holding back before, you know.  I am aware you are no longer a whore, but you are still a pimp.  A flesh-monger,” the taller man sneered, leaning over Sherlock.  “A complete disgrace to the family.  You disgust me.”
Mrs. Hudson dropped what she was holding with a clatter, and rushed to his side.  John was already squatting beside Sherlock, checking for injuries.
It was something John had never expected, when things became sexual with Sherlock.  He had always been focused on his partner’s pleasure, and was extremely good at oral sex.
Eventually Sherlock stirred against him, climbing off the sofa to head to the washroom.  When he came back, he held out his hand to John.  “Come upstairs with me?”
Sherlock simply smirked, his eyes warm.  “Well, we need to test if it’s quicker to warm me up without clothes still, don’t we?”
They both turned their attention back to the movie.  It was one of the better film noirs, with a good storyline and a very beautiful actress, glorious in 1950s fashions.
After many exchanged letters, Sherlock had agreed to come for tea.  It was a shorter, less formal visit than a full meal.  John was happy that it wouldn’t be a long evening of forced politeness.
John’s eyes met his again, a heat in them that was totally new but so, so welcome.  Sherlock felt an answering surge of warmth through his body, his heart thumping now.  He opened his mouth to gasp at this, and somehow they were kissing.  Wet and hot.  Warm lips pressing together.
“No, no...,” John said quickly, and searched for the right words.  “If it was just the two of us, it would be easier.  But with Rosie...”
Claire had effortlessly charmed Mycroft Holmes, and already had him smiling and chuckling as she led him to the buffet table.  He soon had a plateful of delicacies and a glass of fine champagne.  She introduced him to many of the guests, but John could see the man already knew many of the more influential ones.
Both Sherlock and John were struck speechless at those comments.  It was such a change from the heated words from the garden.
At least the clinic had allowed the staff to dress casually and had fans and open windows.  John had worn a thin t-shirt and loose cotton shorts, not caring that it didn’t look that professional.  Sarah had worn a strappy sundress, her long hair up in a messy bun, and sandals.  She could hardly complain about the rest of the staff.
“No, no,” Mycroft quickly replied.  “But he lives here now, doesn’t he?  In the same wing as my brother?”
“Are you humming?” he chuckled.  “That sounds like a Christmas carol, a week too late.  I’m surprised you didn’t delete them all, actually.”
Mycroft stood quickly, very angry now.  “You are refusing to help?  You?”  He paced away, and back again, agitated.  “I should have known better than to come to this glorified whorehouse.”  He waved a hand over the house and grounds.
“Thanks, Mrs. Hudson,” Sherlock said, warmly but also dismissively.  “We are managing fine in that respect.”
They talked it over, long into the night.  The next day, he sent a reply to Mycroft, inviting him to the next monthly ball.
“Perhaps you’d better show me my room then?  So I can make sure it’s suitable?” John leaned in for a quick kiss.
He heard raised voices, two men obviously arguing.  He could make out an occasional word.  “Disgrace”, “disgusting”, and “peddler of flesh” were some of the ones that set the tone.  By the time he could see the men, Sherlock was sitting on the bench, his head hanging low, his shoulders slumped.  Mycroft was standing over him, barking out further insults.
of what John & Sherlock could likely see in their microscope.  Watch it on mute.  Around 20 second mark, Red blood cells (RBC) are very visible.  Around the 40 second mark, the larger White blood cells (leukocytes) can be seen.
-Reform Act 1867:  “Before the Act, only one million of the seven million adult men in England and Wales could vote; the Act immediately doubled that number. Moreover, by the end of 1868 all male heads of household were enfranchised as a result of the end of compounding of rents.  The overall intent was to help the Conservative Party, yet it resulted in their loss of the 1868 general election.”(Wikipedia)
Sherlock paused in putting a handkerchief in his pocket, sending an amused glance his way.  “With you, always.”
“Fuck...” John groaned, stretching out on the bed naked, not even covered with a sheet.  A fan was blowing over his body, but not helping much.
Sherlock climbed over John, lying between his legs, already hard.  Frotting as they continued to kiss.  John grabbed the vial of oil they kept on the bed stand, and passed it to him.
Sometime in the last year, they had realized that Sherlock had a bit of a thing for John’s dirty talk.  It amused John, since he didn’t think his voice was half as sexy as Sherlock’s, but he wouldn’t argue against what seemed to work.  He liked having this power over him.
Sherlock scoffed lightly, rolling on to his back.  “You mean if I’m fool enough to accept Mycroft’s invitation.  Fool enough to give him another chance to attack me.  To give my family another chance to reject me.”
John thought, getting off the sofa and being drawn to Sherlock like he was a magnet.  Sherlock held out his hand when he was near, and tugged John towards his bedroom.  Arousal kicked up hard inside John at that.  Who would have thought they would be together in Sherlock’s bed even yesterday?
“Not now?” John asked, glancing down at his boyfriend’s erection.  He was tired, but he wanted to please him too.
John nodded, and started the fire. He poured them large brandies.  Sherlock had already stripped off his shoes, tailcoat jacket, and was working on the tight cravat at his neck.  John did the same, getting rid of all the confining formal wear.  They took off everything except their underwear, crawling under the blankets on the huge sofa, sipping their drinks.
Sherlock gave a noise of protest when John got up, but then curled up on his own chair, legs tucked under his blanket.  He stared into the fire moodily.
Sherlock eventually nodded in response to his father's query.  “There are many fascinating developments in science these days.  I have been able to replicate Pasteur’s experiment-“
Sherlock was breathtakingly gorgeous like this.  Completely naked, his ivory skin smooth and perfect, a little flushed in places.  His hair mussed from when they were kissing in the kitchen, before moving to the bedroom.  His knees spread wide on the sheets, giving John the best access he could.
John eventually pulled back, taking Sherlock’s hand as they walked back to the house.  They sat close together after that, on the sofa as they sipped tea to warm up.  John wanted more but didn’t want to scare Sherlock, or screw up their friendship.
An hour later, the three Holmes were standing at their doorway as Sherlock and John got back into their carriage.  Once on their way, John hugged him hard.  “I’m so proud of you.  That was a difficult thing to do.”
It took many more ice cubes to tease and trace over John, and Sherlock hardly let any water hit the towel.  He slurped and sucked at his skin like it was a John-flavoured lollipop.  His favourite flavour, apparently.
-Alhumbert Prize:  Pasteur won this prize in 1862 for “disproving the doctrine of spontaneous generation. Under the auspices of the French Academy of Sciences, his experiment demonstrated that in sterilized and sealed flasks, nothing ever developed; and, conversely, in sterilized but open flasks, microorganisms could grow.” (Wikipedia)
Sherlock pulled him up the stairs, and within seconds they were in his bedroom.  John pushed him on to the bed, crawling over him like he’d fantasized doing so many times.  The kissing was intense from the start, a simmering need that had grown since that first kiss.
Sherlock was looking back at him calmly, and John just shrugged internally and shifted to allow Sherlock to slide his feet in place.  His flatmate would complain a bit less if his feet were warm.
“It’s the perfect time.  The house has never looked better, the consorts have never been in such high demand.  And wherever I go, the name ‘William Scott’ seems to keep coming up,” John chuckled, patting Sherlock’s thigh.
“Come on, let’s get you inside and warmed up,” John said, trying his best to keep a straight face.  He grabbed Sherlock’s arm to guide him into the building, and set his shovel down in the entranceway.
“I think you’re OK,” John said after a couple minutes, standing back up.  He extended a helping hand towards Sherlock.
The trio watched Sherlock and his brother talking as they walked around the ballroom.  Eventually, Sherlock led Mycroft  out to the veranda and to the manicured gardens beyond.  A quiet place they could be alone, and finally talk freely.
Sherlock smiled widely, his eyes shining.  “It is so ridiculous.  Why should I care what these pompous windbags think about me?”
Sherlock had turned just then, and seen the look on John’s face before he could change it to a more neutral one.  His eyes widened, and he seemed to freeze in shock.
John smiled, glad Sherlock could joke a little.  “Hardly old.  And hardly boring.  You love being the Queen’s favourite advisor, gleaning information from the network you have developed.”
Leaving the west wing, he looked around the impressive foyer with staircases flanking each side, fine tapestries on the walls, and a dome of glass above it all.  Staff were rushing around, efficient.  Likely a hundred people living and working beneath this roof.
It had been a shock.  Sally had brought the letter straight to them in their wing, not waiting for a meeting of the senior staff.  It was obviously a very private matter for Sherlock, and she knew John would support him.
That last action had John grabbing Sherlock’s head, and shifting down to kiss him.  Harder, deeper than he had before.  A really sexual kiss.  Open mouths, panting against each other.  His tongue teasing in, pleased when Sherlock reciprocated.
Rocking his hips, John pressed his hardening cock against Sherlock’s briefs.  At least sex was a good distraction from the heat.  It would make them hotter, but after another cold shower, maybe it would tire him out enough to actually sleep.
Maybe it was his lack of experience or long suppressed sexual side, but he explored John completely.  John had never had a lover touch and kiss him all over, and was surprised at how many erogenous areas he found.  Sherlock learned to play him like his violin, drawing out his pleasure.  John had never felt so accepted and treasured.
Sherlock rolled his eyes.  “That was just dirty talk, John.  You were just saying that to make me cum.”
“I caught some of that, at the end,” John said, pulling Sherlock into a dark shadowed area.  “So, he wasn’t affected at all by what he saw here tonight?”
Mycroft spoke, even though Sherlock was still turned away.  “The election will likely be called next year, with three times as many votes being cast.”
“Let me do that for you,” John said, chuckling, and hopped up on to the vanity.  He spread his legs wide and guided Sherlock to stand in front of him.  He undid the crooked bow tie and concentrated on tying it correctly.  “You need to calm down.”
Eventually the kiss ended, and Sherlock buried his face against John’s neck, breathing fast.  John was not much better, sure that Sherlock could hear how hard his heart was thumping.  He felt wonderful, his whole body pressed up against Sherlock,  rubbing his hands up and down his back.
Prep was quick but thorough, and they both groaned when finally fully together.  They shifted and found a good rhythm, hitting all the best spots, panting and straining together.  It was fast, messy and glorious.
John gave him back his stool, standing behind him as he peered down into the scope.  “You see the smaller round ones?  If you look closely, they almost look like donuts.  Those are the red blood cells.”
Sherlock rolled away to peel off his underwear, looking so delicious completely nude. John ran an appreciative hand along the elegant curve of his back, delighting in the shiver that ran down Sherlock at his touch.  After a year, it was amazing that they were still so into each other.  He’d never had it this intense, for this long, with anyone else.  Was it from both being men?  Having higher sex drives?
“We will need to share all those old fantasies,” Sherlock said, sitting up and stretching.  “Quick shower?”
It was always about a 50/50 probability that Sherlock would eat when presented food.  John tended to just set it out and hope for the best.  Sometimes, he would wrap it up and put it in the fridge if Sherlock didn’t eat it.  Sometimes he’d leave it near him, hoping the berk would eventually notice it and eat the cold food because it was convenient.
Just then, Mrs. Hudson opened her door and bustled into the hallway, carrying some recycling for her bins.  She gave a hoot of surprise, seeing them on the steps.
Chuckling, John had to nod in agreement.  “OK, OK... not in that verse anyways.  Why are you singing it anyways?”
John shook his head, exasperated.  “I don’t want some idle chit chat.  I meant about Sherlock and his brother.  They must have come back by now.”
After all that build up, it wasn’t long before Sherlock was shuddering and moaning beneath him.   John came seconds after that, pressed hard against Sherlock’s beautiful ass.
“Careful!” Sherlock admonished with a shudder, pulling off his gloves and working on the buttons of his coat.
As he watched, John’s eyes widened slightly, and then dipped downwards.  Staring at Sherlock’s lips in a way that made him feel self-conscious.  Making him feel desperate to lick them.
He didn’t have much time to ponder it before they were under the hot water.  Wet soapy hands were going everywhere, even less inhibited after what had just happened.  John felt comfortable with this, knowing he was pretty fit.  Sherlock spent a lot of time on his scar, and John reciprocated.  The light was better here, and they took their time.  John liked feeling Sherlock’s hands on his slick skin.
“But the lyrics simply refer to winter conditions.  No mythical saints or savoirs, no virgin births.”
Sherlock got up.  “Yes, if you are comfortable with that,” he said, chuckling, and held out his hand to John.
Sherlock gave John’s dick a few long licks, when it looked like his erection was flagging slightly.  “Calm down, doctor.  As much as I’d love to rim your cherry flavoured ass, this is just water frozen in a condom.  You are prepped, and I will keep it moving.  No chance of ice burn.”
Sherlock gave him a small smile.  He hadn’t heard that story before.  “John is too busy with his practice.  He also mentors new doctors, and helps older army doctors get established in London.”
The letter was short and simple.  A bald request to meet with Sherlock William Scott Holmes.  Signed Mycroft Holmes, with all his titles and honorariums.  The use of his full name proved he knew Sherlock Holmes was the medium William Scott.
It was like a slow paced duel, their sharp foils causing many small cuts and injuries.  Circling each other, looking for an unprotected spot to strike next.
Sherlock was insanely curious, wanting to do and try everything.  For someone who claimed he had little interest in sex, John was surprised how often cuddling on the sofa led to more.  He was the one holding back, being more experienced, not wanting to pressure Sherlock into more than he could handle.  Lazy kisses became more intense, and hands started going under clothing.
“You go from drug addict to whore to what?  A flim flam artist?  Plundering widows of their fortunes with far-fetched dross?”  He turned to look back at the massive house, with light shining out of its many windows.  “Congratulations, little brother.  You must be quite spectacular at it.”
“Me too,” John said quickly.  “But I thought you were asexual.  I still fantasized about you often.”
There are many things that should never go near a vagina, and ice lollies are up there. The ice can stick to the delicate skin of the vagina and cause real trauma and damage.
His father had a full head of silver hair, with some waves that hinted at it being curly when he was younger.   His square face reminded John of Sherlock’s, and so did his tall, slim frame.
Having a plan in place helped relax Sherlock slightly.  He shifted into his Courtesan persona, holding a glass of white wine in his left hand, shaking guests’ hands with his right.  Greeting and chatting with them as they worked through the crowd.  John mostly guided them along, his eyes often on Sally and the doorway.
Within a few minutes, they were lying together in an exhausted but satisfied heap.  Sherlock traced a hand down John’s sweat-slick back, and John pressed a open-mouth kiss against his neck.
“He obviously wants something from you, or he wouldn’t request a meeting,” John had said gently, holding Sherlock close, stroking his back.
Pretty soon, the ice was gone and John was lost to the bliss of Sherlock’s normal blow job technique.  Sucking him deep, swirling his tongue, flicking around the head.  His lubed fingers playing around his ass, working inside as Sherlock took him deep.  Tapping and stroking over his prostate as John shuddered and moaned.
He pushed Sherlock, relishing his shocked look as he fell back onto the unmade bed, his long limbs inelegantly splayed.  Chuckling, John climbed over him, grinning down at his flushed cheeks and glittering eyes.  Had Sherlock ever looked so delicious?
Sherlock’s whole body tightened up, his back arching.  John almost cried out at how tight his ass was around his hand, but just pressed firmly against his prostrate, stroking even faster with his other hand.  Sherlock came hard, groaning, shuddering all over, a huge load spurting out on to the towel beneath him.
Sherlock took a deep breath, letting it out as he closed his eyes.  “I’m trying, but after how badly things went last time-“
“So, you’ll move back?  With Rosie?” Sherlock pulled back to say, his eyes glowing but still a glimmer of doubt there.
Gradually, John could feel him relaxing, becoming more himself.  “Do you go to the manor house still?”
It was a while before John returned to the ballroom.  He grabbed a glass of wine, and drank it fast.  The ball was still going on strong.
London is having its snowiest winter ever.  The city doesn’t have enough snow ploughs or other ways to keep up with it, and has asked the citizens to pitch in to keep the city functioning.  John has taken on the task of keeping the area in front of 221 Baker Street accessible, including Speedy’s, who supplies him with free coffee and cookies in gratitude.  Sherlock is, of course, scoffing at all this civil minded do goodness, and is grumbling every time he tries to get around London for his cases.
Sherlock had supported the Queen, discouraging her contact with those he knew were awful, and encouraging the best and brightest to be with her more often.  They formed connections with her, but also with each other, and Sherlock was already seeing the results.
It was a good start.  John could see them eventually going to concerts and plays with Sherlock’s parents.  Re-establishing some sort of relationship there.  Mycroft was more crafty and self-serving, so it may be better to have a cautious connection with him.  John would be there, supporting Sherlock through it all, watching that he didn’t get hurt again.
“Maybe you could take a really hot bath.  Warm up that way?” John said, feeling a bit exasperated.  It was like living with a six foot toddler at times.  But his doctor instincts kicked in.  “Turn your chair towards me.  I need to check your feet.”
“You are thinking far too hard,” Sherlock said softly, kissing close to his ear.  “Did you change your mind about this?”
Mycroft was looking at him as well.  Sherlock considered if he had changed as much.  Mycroft likely had memories of him as a college graduate, all lanky limbs and a skinny, boyish face.  Or that horrible time Mycroft had appeared in the opium den, his face tight with disgust.  Sherlock had been skinny, unwashed, and sweaty.  Hair tangled and dirty, face unshaven, clothing in rags.  He doubted the quick glances Mycroft had of him more recently in London society had erased that image from his mind.
Sherlock rested his head on John’s chest.  John was stroking a lazy hand through his messy curls, enjoying how relaxed Sherlock was against him.  He was practically purring.
Clothes started coming off, and it really hit John then.  Were they really doing this?  Was it taking things too fast?  He hadn’t been with a man since his army days, and he didn’t think Sherlock had much, if any, experience either.  But was it better like this?  Having sex now, before he moved back in?  Testing the waters of this new thing between them before committing to more?
Setting a large ceramic mixing bowl on the bedside table, Sherlock crawled on to the bed, lying on his side next to John.  Not touching, since it was too sticky hot for that.  “Come on, John.  I promise you’ll like it-“
He took his time on his scars, remembering treating most of them during their years together.  He pressed a soft apologetic kiss to the bullet scar near his heart, and his eyes met Sherlock’s.  He gave a little nod, and John continued on.
Crawling over his prone flatmate, John grinned down at him.  “I vote for testing it out now,” he whispered, and gave Sherlock a very thorough kiss.  It felt good when Sherlock groaned in response, his legs and arms coming around John to get him even closer.
With his hands still on Sherlock’s head, John followed his request.  This was one of his favourite things, knowing he didn’t have to hold back, that Sherlock could take it all.  He sucked and flicked his tongue as John thrust into his mouth, getting closer and closer.  He came hard, pushed in all the way.  Sherlock took it all, swallowing it down.
It was a little cooler and wetter from the ice, but Sherlock’s mouth was just as talented as ever, sucking him so deep John almost forgot his name.  “Fuck, fuck, fuck...,” he panted, arching upwards.  “That’s brilliant.  I’m so close, Sherlock.”
That had John bursting out laughing.  “Is that going to be your new excuse not to dress properly for this weather?”
John steered him into the doctor’s office, picking up a test tube with a stopper on the end.  “I have something kind of exciting, actually.”
John sat up, and stared down at his boyfriend.  He lifted up his wet hand and defiantly licked it clean.  When he was done, he leaned over and gave Sherlock a deep, raunchy kiss.
John kissed the side of his neck, feeling sleepy now.  “Did you really jerk off, thinking about me?  Back then?”
They left the west wing, locking the door behind them, and moved towards the ballroom.  The orchestra was already warming up, and uniformed staff were rushing along the corridors, laden with trays of food and bottles of wine.  The monthly party was always a chance for the house staff to pull together and shine, completely dazzle the guests.  Word had gotten out that this party was even more special, and they were rising to the challenge.
Eventually, Sherlock steeled himself, and suggested they get some air in the garden.  His brother met his gaze and nodded slowly.  This was it.  Away from everyone, their polite masks would come off.
Turning towards Sherlock, he slowly unwrapped his scarf from around his neck.  There was snow still clinging to it, and it was shaken free from the motion. Most ended up on the floor, but some went into the upturned collar of Sherlock’s Belstaff coat, and touched against the bared skin of his neck.
The thought of Sherlock rimming him made John close his eyes, the thought intensified by that very tongue swirling around the tip of his cock.  He groaned as Sherlock pushed the condom more firmly, and felt the icy phallus entering his ass.  The combination of feeling that fullness, the stretch, along with the coldness in such a hot place was almost too much.
He chuckled, shaking his head.  “My father carved me a wooden pipe for Christmas one year.  I tried to learn how to play it, but was quite awful.  Eventually my older sister snatched it and threw it into the Thames.”
Sitting down on the bench, Sherlock stared into the dark water of the pond.  “How could she help, if I decide to discuss it with her?”
Sherlock pushed him on to his back, his eyes gleaming.  “Can I touch you?  Everywhere?  I’ve been wanting to for so long.”
John knew the garden well, and cut through it.  He headed to a deep area with a willow tree and a bench.  Sherlock’s favourite spot.
He nodded.  “Some information,” he started, pausing to think of how to phrase it.  “That doctor, Watson…”
He had gotten his reputation in the army as ‘Three Continents Watson’ because of it.  Many of his female partners said they had never had good oral sex before, as most men didn’t really understand the female body.  He took his time, learning what each woman liked, and took great pleasure in giving her orgasm after orgasm.  He usually would just stroke himself as they came, getting off on it.
Sherlock lifted his head, blinking a few times.  Adjusting from looking through the microscope to looking around the room normally.
John looked into those darkened eyes, and knew he had hit on something.  “You wanted it, didn’t you?  How often were you in your bedroom, just like this?  Naked on the bed, fucking your fist, while I watched the telly ten feet away in the living room?  Such a dirty, dirty boy...”
Finishing his drink, John set down his glass, and snuggled along Sherlock’s side.    He ran a hand down his chest, loving the smooth skin, with barely any chest hair.  After the year together, he knew the gentle caresses Sherlock liked.  They were comforting touches, not meant to be arousing.  John knew Sherlock needed time in his mind palace to sort this out, and just wanted to stay at his side for that.
Sighing, Sherlock had hugged John tighter, taking comfort in their embrace.  “It’s likely something political.  He wants to exploit my connection with the Queen.  I’m sure that’s all there is to it.”
-I think John in this fic is slightly smaller 'downstairs' than average, but doesn't have a micropenis.  Small enough that he feels a bit self-conscious about it with lovers, but it looks normal when flaccid.  Not much of a grower.  But he makes up for it with his 'special skills'.
“Tuck your feet under my leg,” John said, grabbing a throw from the back of his chair to drape over his body.
They got up, John taking Sherlock’s hand, something they had done lots the last few days.  On their walks, under the table at meals, under a blanket on the sofa.  But this was different, heading to Sherlock’s bedroom together.
Sherlock sighed, thinking.  “Playful, raunchy.  So open, vulnerable.  But that’s what makes it so intense.”
John hugged him tight.  “I love you so much, Sherlock.”  Living together, fully sharing their lives, had deepened that bond for both of them.  “You know you have a family here.  Me, Mrs. Hudson, Sally, Greg, Claire.  We all love you, and will be here for you, no matter what.”
Sherlock’s sharp eyes were scanning over his brother, taking in what John just had, but likely much more with his deduction abilities.  He was still and silent.  John waited, watching for his response.  Was he ready for this?  Even with all their planning and preparation, it all came down to Sherlock.
That got a weak chuckle, and Sherlock pulled back, looking a bit more himself.  “No, no.  What’s the point.  He will leave soon of his own accord.  But what did you pull me away for?  Was it actually something?”
Sherlock released John’s hand.  “OK if we mostly undress?”  His hand was already on his shirt buttons.
The ice in the bowl was melting too, and Sherlock fished out a couple smaller pieces.  John sighed, half-relieved that the ice was almost gone.  As pleasurable as this had been, he had been aroused for a long, long time, and just wanted to cum.
He nodded to himself.  He had seen it with his own eyes, and just needed conformation.  “Thank you.  I think it is time for me to leave.”
But Sherlock took a half-step closer, making John realize that they were about the same height with where he was standing.  Sherlock really had beautiful eyes, an intriguing mix of jade green, aqua blue, and gold.  He stilled, caught up in them.
Walking naked, hand in hand, to the shower with his boyfriend.  Knowing they would instinctively cuddle together all night, even though it was so hot.  Unable to stay away from each other.  A relationship that started during a heatwave, and was still sizzling hot.
It had been an ongoing debate between them, ever since the snow started accumulating on the streets.  John had told him to use warmer footwear outside, but Sherlock had turned up his nose at the idea of wearing winter boots.  It had gone as far as John even buying him a pair, but they sat untouched by the door.  John bugged him about ruining his hand-stitched Italian dress shoes, but even that hadn’t swayed the stubborn detective.
“Come on,” John said, pulling him down a corridor.  “Lestrade just got a good bottle of French brandy.  I think we could both use a glass or two.”
It was a good jab at his brother.  Mycroft surely knew that the Queen’s favourite advisor was the infamous medium William Scott.  He had seen William Scott in action a year ago, and privately confronted Sherlock behind the screen.  It must be torture for a monarchist like Mycroft, knowing his younger brother had her ear.
Sherlock wasn’t a very emotional person, but John looked at him a bit closer at the tone of his voice.  Was he OK?
Sherlock opened his eyes about halfway.  “After that?  I will be OK for a month,” he purred with very naughty grin.
Sherlock shook his head, sweaty curls clinging to his sweaty skin.  “I’m too horny and hot for that now.  Would you just talk to me, while I...,” he said, picking up the lube bottle and pouring a generous amount into his hand.
-This idea popped into my head yesterday and I wrote it just for fun.  Maybe they could have ended the series this way or make 4.3 about them adjusting to living together as a couple instead of all that Eurus stuff?  Lol
Along with the heat came an awareness.  They touched each other in passing, and longer when John was treating one of his injuries.  But this was different, longer.  Body against body.  Full contact.  Sherlock rarely has this with anyone.  Especially not John.  John...
Sherlock was panting hard, his body tensing up as he got closer and closer to the edge.  He dropped his head to his pillow, resting the weight of his upper body on to his forearms, rocking back against John’s thrusts.  “Yes, yes...,” he moaned.
That whisper made Sherlock let out a panting gasp, his chest heaving, turning his head to look at John.  Still stroking.
He was about to scramble off him, kneeling again, when Sherlock rocked upwards, pressing back against John.  He moaned himself, pushing back.  They started rocking together.  John’s hands went to Sherlock’s hips, dry humping against him, kissing against his back.  Sherlock was moaning softly, his hips moving too.  John realized he was rocking against the bed, and shifted to be in even tighter contact.
-Lydia Becker (1827-1890):   She was educated at home, like most girls of that time, and studied botany and astronomy in her 20s.  In 1862, she won an award for a scholarly paper on horticulture.  She was one of many female scientists who had frequent correspondence with Charles Darwin, and she sent him a copy of her 1864 book ‘Botany for Novices’.  “Becker had a particular interest in bisexual and hermaphroditic plants which, perhaps, offered her powerful 'natural' evidence of radical, alternative sexual and social order.”  In the fall of 1866, she went to a meeting where votes for women was discussed, and got involved in the early phases of the Suffragette movement.  She strongly believed that there should be the same education for girls as boys, and that widows and single women needed the vote as much (if not more) as married women.  Women over 30 got the vote in 1918, all people over 21 in 1928.  It was reduced to 18 years old in 1968. (Wikipedia)
Knowing better than to expect an answer when Sherlock was like this, John went into the kitchen.  Soon, the soup was heating up and he was slicing cheese.
John chuckled, carding his fingers through Sherlock’s hair now.  “I never thought I’d be grateful to have someone ask me to look at a sore tooth.  As soon as he opened his mouth, I could see his gums were so swollen with infection.  I lanced the area, collected the discharge, and he felt a bit better.  I gave him the name of our dentist.”
But then there was something very cold, and very hard, pressing against him, pulling John out of his sex dazed state.  “What? Wha-“ He tilted his head up, looking down at Sherlock.
Shifting down the bed, he traced a new ice cube down John’s fully hard cock.  Moaning loudly, John looked down at the gorgeous man lying between his outstretched legs, slurping his way up the side of his erection, and knew he was a very lucky man.  His hand went into Sherlock’s hair, clenching into the curls, when he swirled the ice around the tip, and then took it into his mouth, tongue repeating the motion.  “Oh my God,” John moaned, closing his eyes tight at the sensations.
Sherlock’s expression shifted to one of concern the longer the silence continued.  “Oh John, forget I said that. I’m an idiot.  You are still welcome to stay here, just as friends, of course-“
“This time you are prepared.  We all are.  It will go better.  You are on your home turf, after all,” John smirked, patting the completed tie.
He kept his eyes closed, feeling Sherlock trace lightly over his skin.  It was thorough, those fingertips making John feel more alive, sensitized, with every area he touched.  Sherlock seemed to map out his body, and John was sure he was cataloguing it all.
“The buzzer.  Sally is signalling us,” Sherlock said to John, who was already pulling his clothing straight.
He had never expected this, Sherlock taking the lead.  He thought he would be the one making Sherlock comfortable, like a shy virgin or something.  But it made sense.  Sherlock was satisfying his curiosity about John’s body, in a way a friend couldn’t.
“Like what?” John asked, really interested.  Sherlock hadn’t had that much sex in his younger years, a fact that still shocked John.
John tugged him closer, and kissed Sherlock.  It took a second or two, and then they seemed to sink into it, into a real kiss.  John’s hand slid to the back of Sherlock’s head, tilting him to a better angle, keeping him close.  Really kissing him, letting out all the emotions he had buried over the years.  It didn’t take much for them all to come rushing back, eager to be let out.  Finally.
The biscuits did smell good, and John carefully took a bite of the warm buttery treat, but still managed to get some crumbs on his jumper.  He brushed them away as he popped the rest into his mouth.  As he chewed, he thought he heard an unusual sound, and gazed over at Sherlock.
John was breathing faster from all this attention already, and he let out a small moan.  “Yes, yes, Sherlock.  You can do anything you want.”
“Sherlock still plays his violin, and we go to performances like that quite often,” John said, but then wondered if he had sounded too familiar.
Making up a couple large mugs of tea, John carried them out to the living room, and set them down on a table.  He shifted his own chair to be closer to the fire and moved the table to be beside it.  He passed one mug to Sherlock, who held it with both hands and took small sips, still staring moodily into the fire.
John was shovelling hard after the latest snow dump, feeling warm and even a bit sweaty from the exertion.  The snow banks are almost as tall as he is now, making it even more work, having to lift the shovel higher and fling the snow on top.  He’s got a rhythm going, and doesn’t even notice that Sherlock has returned, and prior to entering their building, has stepped close to tell John something.  Instead, he gets a big shovelful of snow right in the face.
He had said the words without thinking, and they seemed to hang in the air between them.  The room seemed suddenly too quiet, and Sherlock could only look at John, still so close, feeling incredibly aware of the sound of their breathing.  His own heartbeat seeming to get louder, and faster.
“Ages and ages,” Sherlock murmured, pressing a kiss against John’s neck.  “I knew we had a special connection right from the start.  You saw me for who I truly was and still wanted to be my friend.  It grew from there, as we did case after case.”
Sherlock’s hand cupped over him fully, and John jolted at the sensation.  It had been a long time since someone had touched him there.  He closed his eyes, resisting the urge to push up against that warm hand.  It was a confusing jumble of sensations and emotions.  Lust, arousal, need against shame and embarrassment.  Wanting to pull away, at the same time he wanted to get closer.
“As if you are one to talk.  You chase criminals in bespoke suits and Italian shoes, even when there’s six feet of snow out there,” John shot back, but with little heat.  It was an old debate.
John loved the view, the obscene, raunchy sight of his hand up Sherlock’s tight ass, stretched snugly around his wrist, dripping with lube.  The wet squelch sounds mixing with their panting, and the creaking of the bed.  Good sex was noisy and a bit nasty, and he loved that Sherlock was just totally surrendering to it all.  Completely in the moment and loving it.
He was cut off by Sherlock moving, his intent clear.  Within a minute, he was pinned down and Sherlock was taking him in his mouth.
It was automatic.  John hadn’t even realized that he’d walked into 221B Baker Street and was on the first step before he stopped, and turned around.
“Yes, but I have an ‘unfortunate romantic attachment’ to you as well.  Would that bother you?” John grinned, unable to resist teasing him.
Taking a deep breath, John let it out slowly as he thought it over.  “Your parents must be elderly by now.  They likely want to see you with their own eyes.  It could be closure for you all.  Face up to your past, look them in the eye, and let them judge you for who you are now.  I know you as a self made man, building up a successful business and considerable wealth.  You have overcome drug addiction and got through those years of being the Courtesan.”
“Um, OK,” Sherlock said, shifting to lie on his back.  “But I should warn you.  I’m not as responsive as other people.  I’m not as sexual.  Maybe it’s low hormones or just the way I am.”
Rolling his eyes, John again tried to keep it together as he bent to pick up the gloves Sherlock had dropped on to the floor, and set them on a side table.  He helped Sherlock take off his long coat, and hung up.  “Why don’t you take off your shoes here and go upstairs to warm up?”
“Um, together?” John asked, a little stunned.  Again, things happening faster than he ever expected with Sherlock.
Grabbing a damp facecloth, John cleaned up his hands and Sherlock as well as he could.  Most of the lube was mopped up anyways.  They could take a hot bath later on.
It felt like the orgasm was ripped out of him, his body surrendering to the intense sensations, and Sherlock keeping it all up.  Eventually John weakly pushed at his shoulders, “Enough, enough.  Shit, Sherlock...”
But Sherlock pulled away, pushing John on to his back and practically diving under the covers.  John could only groan again, pushing his hands into Sherlock’s hair as he took him all in.  It was shockingly intimate, entirely unexpected, and had John cumming hard within a couple minutes.
“Mr. Holmes, can I get you anything?” Mrs. Hudson asked him.  She had met him earlier when Clare was touring him around the ballroom.
John rolled his eyes at Sherlock throwing his own comments back at him, and took Sherlock’s hand.  He felt the familiar nervousness of being fully naked with a new partner for the first time.  It was a bit of a relief that it was after they had just orgasmed, since it would be OK to be soft.  Unerect, he looked like other men.  Should he say something now?  Warn Sherlock what to expect?
Clothes came off between heated kisses, dropped carelessly on to the floor.  John was already so aroused, having not been with anyone for ages.
“It better not be a fucking ice lolly,” John groaned, head flopping back against his pillow.  “I’ve had to warn so many people at the clinic against it.  It’s even been in the news.    Infections, irritations, damage...”
After a few minutes, John pulled back for some air.  Sherlock whined in complaint, kissing his way down his neck.
“Mr. Holmes, I could say the same to you.  Welcome to our home,” John replied, his most charming doctor demeanour on display.  He had been dealing with the upper crust as patients and as guests at these parties for years now.  He had no illusions about men like this anymore.
After a few minutes, Sherlock nodded to himself.  “Then don’t move in here.  Not yet,” Sherlock added, sensing John was about to object.  “Let’s set up a room for her upstairs, and you can keep your apartment for now.  She can start staying over with me some weekends, and maybe you will stay over too.  Or maybe she can stay with her aunties for a weekend, and you can be here.”
-A/N:  A drabble for a hot summer day!  Feeling bad for how hot it is this year in Europe & in many areas.  I’m in Western Canada & it was so smoky the last 2 summers from forest fires you could hardly enjoy being outside.  This year, it’s been raining almost every day for two months, way harder than normal.  Luckily, it’s not enough to flood and it’s making everything grow like crazy.  No smoky air, but hard to plan BBQs & other summer stuff with so many thunderstorms.
Sherlock smiled slowly, his Courtesan persona like an impenetrable wall.  “Only in certain circles,” he replied smoothly, taking a sip of his wine.
“Not so good, I’m afraid,” Russell said with a grimace.  “I’m sorry to disturb you at a party, but could you give me some medical assistance?”
Right now, only staff were rushing around, getting everything ready.  Guests were not due for another 30 minutes or so.  Sherlock toured around the room, still holding John’s hand, his sharp eyes taking in every detail.  By the time they were back at the doorway, John could tell he was satisfied with the set up, at least.
Sherlock glanced at John, still in his serene, Courtesan persona, but John knew him well enough to see his nerves.  He took his hand, giving it a squeeze.  “It’s time, yes?”
After finishing the meal, John sat back and got comfortable with his blanket to watch the rest of the movie.  Sherlock shifted too, leaning back against the armrest with a pillow under his head.
His brother pressed his lips together, but gave no verbal answer.  But he might as well have screamed it.
John pushed down the urge to refuse, not wanting to be pulled away from seeing what happened with Sherlock.  But the house doctor was away tonight.  “Oh, yes, of course,” he conceded.  He led Russell out of the ballroom, and into the resident doctor’s office.  “What seems to be the problem?”
Sherlock had totally shifted into science mode, sitting on his stool, peering through his microscope, adjusting the focus.  John was glad he had such a good distraction at hand.  This was their happy place, where they still spent hours each week dabbling in whatever interested them.
John felt a flush of pride, standing at Sherlock’s side.  He knew in that moment that he could handle this.  “Good to meet you.  Enjoy the party,” he said to Mycroft.  He gave Sherlock’s forearm a comforting squeeze before letting go.
“Not at first.  But by the time we finally... yeah, so, so often.”  Sherlock admitted, his skin flushing a bit.
“You really should come round soon for supper.  Mother and Father haven’t seen you for a decade, I should think,” Mycroft said, and started towards the door when Claire waved to signal his carriage was out front.  “And bring Dr. Watson, of course.”
After a few minutes of that, John curled his fingers towards his palm, making a firm fist.  “Can you feel that, Sherlock?  My whole hand inside you?  Do you want me to fuck you with it?”
Mycroft turned to face his brother, his easy smile slipping, his lips pressing together into a firm line.  “Sherlock.  Or do you prefer to go by William Scott these days?”  There was a bit of bite to his tone, a flash of challenge in his eyes.
“Perhaps coming to visit me while I recovered has brought those old memories back a bit more,” Sherlock said, glancing downwards.  “Thanks for helping me through it.”
Sometimes it was better to prove a point instead of arguing about it.  At least that’s what John told himself as he pulled back Sherlock’s blanket and laid down beside him, before tugging the blanket over both of them.
John scanned the room, usually very good at picking Sherlock out of a crowd.  He didn’t see sign of him either.
Sparks were there right away, even if it was a bit awkward at first.  Sherlock hadn’t kissed anyone for a long time.  John was quite expert at it, stepping closer and tilting Sherlock’s face to the perfect angle.  Arms wrapped tight around each other, they shared kiss after kiss on that snowy lane.
Sherlock noticed his diverted attention, and followed his gaze to the doorway.  John felt him stiffen with tension, and his eyes flicked to his face.
Sherlock moved off, stroking him as he moved his talented mouth to his balls, taking them inside.  John was soon arching off the bed, panting in pleasure.
John chuckled, tilting his head to give him better access.  “It’s good to have you finally admit it.  It would also mean doing more of this, as long as you are comfortable with it.”
It hadn’t been the best blow job he’d ever had, but it was certainly the most enthusiastic.  Sherlock’s eyes gleamed as he let John go, licking his lips.  There was no sign of disappointment.
“You did act up when Irene or Janine were around,” Sherlock purred, kissing along John’s jaw.  “But I was just as bad when you were dating somebody, doing everything I could to disrupt your dates.”
Before John could decide anything, Sherlock’s hand was rubbing over the head, precum making his hand slick.  John moaned, loving the sensation, and was even more lost to it when Sherlock’s erection pressed against his ass.  They rocked together, faster and faster.
“It must be your brother.  I’m coming with you this time.  If he’s making a scene in front of your guests, I’ll help Greg’s men drag him off the property.”
Sherlock met his gaze, not saying anything.  His eyes were searching, looking for something.  It reminded John of when they first met, when he was so thrown off by this intense, younger man, with such sharp, observant eyes.
That had Sherlock pulling back, his eyes searching John’s.  “You would be willing to be in an exclusive relationship with me with only kissing?  No sex?”  He seemed surprised.
John didn’t know if he should bow apologetically or tug at his forelock.  What was the proper thing for a peasant like himself to do to appease the nobility?  He chuckled, mostly to himself, at the thought.  Glancing at his work, he decided he had done enough for now.
Sherlock jumped back from John quickly, but slipped on something, falling backwards with a big flailing of arms and long legs.  He landed hard, letting out a grunt of pain.
Letting out a little whimper at that dirty image, Sherlock tensed up, his whole body shifting on the bed.  He was getting close.
John felt Sherlock bouncing his leg a little, and reached over to take his hand.  It was a blatantly a gesture of a long term couple, right in front of Mycroft.  Mrs. Hudson had told John about his questions at the party, and knew he understood the nature of John’s close relationship with his brother.  It was highly illegal, with many rich and powerful men fleeing the country to avoid harsh punishments.
It had been a few days after Christmas.  They were staying at the Holmes country house, an hour out of the city.  John didn’t mind Sherlock’s parents, but Sherlock needed breaks from being around them so much.  They ended up bundling up to go on a long walk.  It started snowing, big fluffy flakes, and John’s breath had caught just watching Sherlock staring upwards in wonder.  Snowflakes were landing on his dark curls, his face, his long, dark coat.
He awoke later, not really sure how much time had passed.  Blinking, he rubbed his face and glanced around.  Sherlock was mostly in shadow, the firelight flickering over him, and he seemed to be looking his way.
He had come home exhausted, stripped off his sweaty clothes, and taken a long cold shower.  Drank a couple litres of icy water.  Now he was lying naked under a fan, but feeling hot again.  When would this ever end?
Saying that earned John some more intense kissing.  Sherlock had started out a bit awkwardly, but was a quick learner.  John lost himself to it.
Something deep inside John surged, a wave of emotion, and he urged Sherlock upwards into a tight hug.
Sighing, John tried to quell his concerns.  He had been with Sherlock after that meeting, summoned by Claire.  Sherlock had been quiet and withdrawn, staring into the fire.  Clearly disturbed and upset.  It took a lot to get him talking.
Sherlock swallowed audibly. His eyes were flicking between John's hand and face. John saw the stunned expression on his face, noticed the way he instinctively let his legs fall out more to the sides in response to the touch.
Watching Sherlock at work again is mesmerizing, John can’t tear his eyes away from him. There are three different phones laid out in front of him on the hood of a police car, and Sherlock is going back and forth between them, scrolling, mumbling to himself; so acutely present for the task at hand.
”Go lie down,” he said in his best military tone, snapping his fingers, pointing with his whole arm out towards the sitting room. To his amazement, the dog turned around and shuffled away along the corridor.
John couldn't resist letting his two fingers push further in, stopping just before the point where he thought Sherlock would gag. He watched him carefully for his reactions, vigilant of any sign of discomfort, but there were none. Instead, suddenly, Sherlock reached up a hand and put it on top of the one John was using - not to stop him, but to encourage him to keep going. Sherlock's eyes were distant and intense, all at once, as he was taking John's fingers in his mouth so obediently, and John's entire body felt on fire.
”You’ve hardly told me anything about last night,” Mary said at the dinner table, causing John’s heart to jump. ”How the hell did you manage to get that pissed?”
Just before Sherlock turned the corner on the staircase, John saw him put his hands in his hair to ruffle up the curls, in the same way he always did in front of a mirror. It was such a tiny, harmless thing to do, but it still caused John to clench his hands into tight fists.
At this, John grabbed Gabriel by his shirt, shook him around, and pushed him up against the hard wall.
He spent the entire night awake, his laptop eventually getting so hot it made the skin on his thighs turn red.
”Wouldn’t the bed be better?” John already knows it’s a losing battle, yet can’t refrain from asking, each and every time.
Sherlock had a bit of a hard time adjusting to spending the night away from Baker Street, which made it more difficult than usual to go to sleep. His flat had been his sanctuary for so long, and even though this place was, objectively, much nicer in every way, and bigger and had two bathrooms and even a terrace overlooking Hyde Park, it still wasn’t easy.
Then John seemed to have decided to step it up a notch. He was beginning to thrust harder, faster. Sherlock was hard again, his cock pressed tightly down against his stomach as John kept pushing into him.
”I don’t know, Gabe.” Sherlock reached under the table, put his large hand on Gabriel’s denim clad thigh, stroked it a few times. ”I don’t know and I don’t care.”
John’s sitting leaned back into her fluffy white sofa, amongst a mountain of throw pillows in soft colours, a glass of wine in his hand. He feels slightly buzzed even though he hasn’t had that much to drink; Rebecca seems to be a bit more tipsy. She’s inching closer and closer, giggles, keep touching his arm. He can feel the warmth of her body against his.
”Look! Do you remember? It was that day we spent at the beach - oh, look at that, Sherlock!” She’s beaming as she pours over the images. ”You were in your pirate phase. That hat! You refused to go anywhere without it.”
Then again, this entire situation was unlikely. Guilt, perhaps. Would probably try to call him in the morning, apologize profoundly. “I hope we can still be friends,” things along that line.
John's palm pressed over his length, and then he felt John shape his hand into a fist and give one earnest, experimental pull through the fabric.
”Sherlock-” John blinks, worries his lip. ”Why are you so angry with me? What’s wrong? I’m sorry but I just don’t understand?”
Sherlock looked away, and for a brief moment, John felt bad about pushing him like this. Then he remembered all the stuff that Sherlock already had figured out about him, and decided that it was only fair to even the score a bit.
But then, just as he was getting ready to leave, a car crash victim had come in and the following two hours had gone by in minutes. Time always seemed to stop when he was in surgery, being so utterly focused at what he was doing.
“Listen,” John said. “I made a terrible mistake in marrying Mary, and I'll admit I've been more than a little blind. But for your information, I have taken a lot of steps along the way to correct that now. Last night is not representative of how things will be.”
John repeated the motion, now with more precision. Slowly, slowly, he moved his hips so that his cock glided along the length of Sherlock's. It caused his entire body to tense in anticipation.
”Back at the house, Victor showed me the letter. At first I couldn’t figure it out, but then I realised it was a skip code. Every third letter, and then it made sense. Long story short; turned out Mr Trevor had gotten himself into trouble when he was young. Had a debt, and embezzled money from the bank where he was working to pay it off. Had intentions to return the ’loan’, as he saw it, to the bank as soon as he could, but we all know how that story usually goes. Was caught, sentenced, but shortly after there was a riot and he took the chance to escape. Built a completely new life in Australia, made a lot of money trading gold. Returned to England as a wealthy man, new identity, determined to be a better person. But, his past eventually caught up with him. Starting with my deduction of those initials, that night. Ending with a stroke brought on by the blackmail that old acquaintance subjected him to.”
”I didn’t think you did… this sort of thing.” John is slowly combing his fingers through Sherlock’s hair.
”Yeah,” John says. ”Because it’s always true. But you know, tonight.. What you did tonight. That was different.”
Sherlock looks up, sees him smiling. ”I didn’t mean- You are most definitely not making me uncomfortable, Sherlock. Quite the opposite. I just thought that, you know. Maybe we should slow it down a bit, I don’t know, talk about… this? We’ve both had a bit to drink tonight, and also, I don’t know, exactly, how you-”
John would have thought that Sherlock's deductive skills would have been lessened by being, well, distracted, but apparently, no such luck.
John’s knees were too weak to support him any longer, and he slid down against the tiles until he was sitting, shaking all over, gasping for breath, warm water still splashing over his head, and he hoped he hadn’t made any noises that Mary could have heard.
It’s funny, John thinks, how this triggers such a massive urge in him to step in on Sherlock’s side, to stand up for him, to fight for him. He’d felt it the very first night they’d met, and he feels it now, just as strongly.
” he was saying, still in a half whispering voice but a bit darker and definitely more insistent, his hands suddenly lowered and combing through the guy’s hair, almost but not quite holding his head.
The group of school children left the room. He was standing in the artificial, moist heat, surrounded by tropical plants and free-flying butterflies, and suddenly felt in good spirits. This was turning out much better than he had anticipated.
John put his hand on the front of his pants. They were tenting severely, a large damp spot had formed on the fabric. The touch, the hint of possible release, made him shudder. Sherlock met his eye.
”No, of course, John, you couldn’t have. I’m merely trying to help you understand a little bit more about Sherlock and the way his mind works regarding these things. Alright, so, we were talking about ’love’. Leads me seamlessly into the topic of your wedding.”
John pressed Sherlock up against the brick wall of the restaurant exterior. Sherlock was looking at him with crazy eyes, his pupils were dilated to the extent that only a thin line of his irises were visible.
John wondered, and felt a surge of jealousy rush through his chest. He tried to tell himself that this was, of course, absolutely unreasonable on his part. He'd just given Sherlock his very first blow job, hell, even been the first one who'd ever gotten to touch him sexually. So if Sherlock had kissed a few people, that surely was –
John tries desperately to stop himself but it’s already too late. He pulls, somewhat perfunctory, on his hair but Sherlock doesn’t move. John closes his eyes and lets himself be immersed in the unreal sensation of Sherlock swallowing repeatedly around him as he comes.
How the hell could he have been so stupid! He had rushed into a marriage with someone he barely knew, and then stayed with her, despite the terrible, terrible things that Sherlock had uncovered about her. Stayed out of duty and for the sake of the baby. How could anyone expect an arrangement like that to hold? This was the way John's thoughts had drifted throughout the day.
As soon as John heard the front door close, he picked up his phone. Text or call, that was the question. He figured it was more likely to get a reply via text, since Sherlock almost always let his calls go straight to voicemail; but then again, more likely to persuade Sherlock to meet up with him if they were talking.
”John Watson? What the hell are you doing here, mate? Haven’t seen you in years, you certainly pick your timing, huh!” He laughs. Greg looks surprisingly fine, John thinks, given the circumstances. Yes, he’s gotten a bit older as well - hair greyer than John’s, a few extra comfort pounds around his waistline - but all in all, it’s still the same Greg.
In ideal weather conditions, the walk would probably take about an hour and a half. Now, he figured most likely three, maybe even more. John pulled the hood of his parka over his head and put on the gloves that he had shoved into his pocket this morning in a lucky guess. With a determined pace, he started to trudge through the ever building snow.
”John! How lovely to see you again!” Sherlock’s mum comes out in the hall, wipes her hands at her apron, then gives him a big hug. He takes out the gift bag he’s brought, containing two bottles of Champagne and a large box of Prestat chocolate.
And then, he was back in his bed, with John next to him. He let his palm rest against John’s chest, stroked over the sparse, coarse hair there. Unreal. Simply unreal.
“Haven't you figured it out by now, John! Sherlock is simply not cut out to handle this kind of drama. We are talking about an individual who emotionally is level with your average twelve-year old! Fortunately, he has the intellectual capacities to recognize this about himself – why do you reckon it took five years before you saw him in any type of relationship? He knows his vulnerabilities.”
An eternity later, the guests have finally cleared, the left over food has been put away and they have made the fifteen minute drive to the grey stone church where Midnight Mass is held. Daddy and Caroline are staying home with Uncle Rudy, which is a relief in many different ways.
Instead, Sherlock looks around, takes it all in again, after all this time - the bright colours of the stained windows; the elaborate patterns of the two large silver candlesticks on the altar; the white linen, the gold, the psalm books in front of them; the hymn board with its shiny mahogany frame.
The mattress shifts when Sherlock leaves the bed. John opens his eyes just a tiny bit, and sees a glimpse of Sherlock, walking very quietly out of the room. When John hears the hallway toilet door creak, he finally dares to exhale.
He switches from his thumb to his index finger, pushes in to the second knuckle and Sherlock is squirming, his cock is pressed hard against his stomach. A pool of shiny precome is forming there. John lets his other hand make trails in the wetness, but without touching his cock.
“..or you fucking me. That's what I fantasize about, John. And I've even used, you know-” Sherlock paused. A pink flush spread across his already flustered cheeks,
”I’m truly sorry for putting you through this, Mary, but to be fair, this marriage didn't exactly get off to a flying start, with you lying about your entire identity and then almost killing my best friend!”
The way Sherlock’s tongue had flickered against his own, inside the warm wetness of Sherlock’s mouth. The way his lean, strong body had rocked up against him as John pressed him down on the bed. The gasp he had let out when John first dared to put his hand over his cock, found it hard underneath those thin trousers.
Fighting the snow, John managed to speed up into a jogging pace. He pushed through the crowd, calling out the familiar words.
”Stand up on your knees, John.” John obliged, got up to stand on shaky knees while Sherlock positioned himself in front of him. He put both of his large hands on John’s hipbones, and then stretched out his tongue. He let it swirl around John’s cock, and John could see everything from this new angle. He cursed again.
The word ’Angel’ appeared, in a warm golden color, it floated around for a while. And then it was joined by other words: ’I love you’, written in some sort of fog that would surely dissipate if he dared to touch it. He watched the words dance before his eyes for a moment, and then carefully placed them back in the room for all things Gabriel.
”Sherlock,” he began carefully, and saw him immediately tense up again. ”I’m sorry if I’ll make you uncomfortable now, but I just have to say it.”
When Gabriel had returned from America after his long exile, Sherlock had offered him to stay at Baker Street for a couple of nights, to give him time to find a place in the city. But one day had turned into another, and it had been so remarkably easy to pick up where they had left off. Or rather, in a better place, since where they had left off the last time hadn’t been all that good.
”Hey,” John says, and it’s in a different tone now; still happy but more serious. ”My point was. Seeing that we’ve spent a large number of nights together, in various and less than optimal locations. Perhaps it wouldn’t be that difficult to share this bed for a couple of nights? There’s plenty of room for both of us.”
John can’t help but smile a little at this, bowing his head down to place a gentle kiss on that lovely mouth. ”Trust me,” he says, briefly kissing Sherlock’s lower lip again, ”I’m a doctor.”
Sherlock was facing away from him still. He hadn’t expected John to react this way. Didn’t yet know what to make of it. Perhaps he’d made an incorrect assumption. Best to wait to see what John would say next.
With that, his mind was made up. He would return the favor. He would protect Sherlock by not pushing him, by not standing in his way. He would NOT be the cause of any more distress for Sherlock, even if that meant never seeing him again.
Sherlock’s entire body felt on fire. He heard himself making a constant stream of small, needy sounds, but couldn’t be bothered to keep it down. It would have been impossible, anyhow.
He took it all in, just like that, and John heard himself making some kind of primitive sound at the intense feeling and the mind-blowingly hot visual of seeing his dick disappear completely down Sherlock's mouth.
John had moved his hands away from Sherlock’s ass. Instead he was using his body weight to press Sherlock back against the counter, and he was starting to rock into Sherlock, in a slow but urgent pace. Sherlock quickly caught on, moving his hips in rhythm with John’s. He noticed his shirt buttons were being undone.
Sherlock walks into the kitchen, then stops abruptly. It’s - clean. It’s actually more than clean, it’s… It’s the way it hasn’t been for a very long time. Not since… John. He lets his hand brush along the worktop. It feels nice. Not sticky, not crumbly, not grimy. Looks like a proper kitchen again.
”One evening, just a few days after I got there, we were sitting over a glass of port after dinner. Victor began to talk about my habit of observing; about how I could figure things out by inference. His father thought he was exaggerating, so he challenged me to deduce what I could of him.”
The next time John would run into Sherlock, it would already be summer again. A heat wave would linger over London, and life would be starting to seem a bit more worth living.
John sees the exact moment when Sherlock looks up from his book and realises what is about to happen.
But John is pretty sure, now, that Sherlock needs him. Just as much as John needs him, only in a slightly different way. Because together, they’re invincible. Separate, they’re both lost, each in his own way.
”Mary and John, I’d like you to meet my friend Gabriel Smith-Sinclair,” he said in an overly formal tone. ”Gabriel, allow me to present Mary and John Watson.”
John reaches out, puts his hand on Sherlock’s arm, his throat tight. ”I’ve missed this. Missed you. Very much.”
Sometimes, he ruminated about what was happening, tried to sort out what he was going to do, never really finding any answers. And sometimes (okay, often), he indulged in the sexual fantasies.
John scrambled out in the kitchen to make some tea while Sherlock lounged in the sofa, looking very relaxed and very happy. Just as John was feeling, himself.
”Alright,” the kid says, after a long moment, and John can feel the collective exhale of relief around him. ”Tell me what to do with me gun.”
”What can I tell you, John,” Greg said. ”Of course I invited him, but, you know. It’s not like he’s bloody likely to show up.” He chuckled. ”Though maybe now with that boyfriend of his, who knows.”
It was already past noon. They had walked across the street and over to the café in Hyde Park, and managed to get the table in the corner.
John nodded, but he was very unsure of what to say next. Or rather, how to phrase it and how to find the courage to bring it up. Finally, he just decided to get it done. There would be no more elephants in the room this time.
”Not that word, please,” Sherlock cut in. ”Sure, yes. Sadie’s a hunting dog. But it doesn’t matter, John, see, that’s where these idiots go wrong! All living things respond in the same, predictable way to the principles of classical and operant conditioning.”
“Substance-induced psychosis, most likely. Mr Holmes has definitely gotten a whole lot better during his stay here, but it’s still not that easy to predict the track to full recovery. As I’m sure you know, Dr. Watson, a little more than fifty percent come out of this within a few days to a week, but we need to realise it could also be months. And for some…”
”The older I get, the more I feel that I-” he paused, ”that kids would be a wonderful thing to have in my life.” He spoke quietly.
Sherlock was right, he thinks - as always. John has really let himself slide since he moved out. Too much take away, too many evenings spent in front of the telly. That will all change now, though.
John flopped down next to Sherlock, put his right arm around him and pulled him very close. Sherlock returned the embrace. He felt completely content, at peace.
John is systematically combing through his hair, dirty from God knows what. At the temple, there are chunks of hair lumped together by dried blood. John wets a flannel with water and some soap, and uses it to dissolve the knots, carefully dabbing it around the laceration in Sherlock’s scalp.
He leaned forward again, and this time, he opened his mouth, let Sherlock's cock slide in as far as he could comfortably accommodate. He felt Sherlock trembling. John sucked tentatively, and this caused Sherlock to moan so loadly John faintly worried that Mrs. Hudson would be coming worriedly barging up the stairs within soon.
Weeks later after another lovemaking session he will pour out to Sherlock how he’s wanted to put his mouth on another bloke for years, decades even, and once he met Sherlock he was sure that was the bloke he’d dreamt about. For now, John weeps at just how fantastic it is to know that he’s where he’s meant to be. Despite whatever shitshow may be occurring roundabout them, whatever else they may yet have to deal with, the cosmic tumblers have finally clicked into place and allowed these two souls in this universe to find one another.
He slides inside me ever so slowly, a look of wonder and amazement on his face. For my part, I am ready to cry, not from pain, but from joy.
John drifts out of the crowd to hang back by the wall and wait for his lover, in whose stunning hands lie John’s heart and soul and (quite often) his body. From a few yards away and out of the corner of his eye he spots another man who looks to be about ten years older than Sherlock wearing tight leather pants and a transparent button-down shirt left stopping Sherlock as he makes his way back over to John. The man smiles just a bit too broadly and leans a bit too closely into Sherlock’s personal space.
“Rosie.” Sherlock wraps the name around his tongue, trying it out, the faintest smile playing around his lips and eyes misting over. “Your daughter.”
John gently grasps Sherlock’s hand and leads him to a chair at the table and, as befits a proper English gentleman, pulls out Sherlock’s chair and allows him to sit before sliding it closer to the table.
you. I thought you didn’t feel things that way, that you were married to your work. You said it once and I believed you.
John’s heart is pounding out of his chest; he is so uncertain of what to expect, but the thought of holding his own daughter for the first time – a person who previously did not exist – almost overwhelms him. He goes to the loo and grabs some water in order to be able to sit with Rosie for at least an hour like the nurse wants him to. John – having not prepared for this beforehand – has to take off his button-down and undershirt so that Rosie can lay on his bare chest, but puts his button-down back on again so as not to freeze.
“I have not deleted any part of planning your wedding, your stag night, your wedding day, or any subsequent contact we have had. They are painful memories, yes, but they involve you, and I am unwilling to delete any memory in which you are present.
“It gives me great pleasure,” Victoria intones authoritatively over all present, “to present the newlyweds to you: Mister Sherlock Holmes-Watson and Doctor John Watson-Holmes. As my people would say
This is the happiness we all deserve after so much pain. It's still a little bittersweet, but there is definite reward here. :)
There are a few sniffles from the crowd as they watch these two speak to one another, eyes locked, as though there were no one else around. The years of words unsaid, or of words spoken past one another, the years of regret, of loss, and of loneliness, all have led them to right here, right now, promising lives to one another.
“As you both know, your sweet Rosie has anencephaly, which in her case means she is missing the upper parts of her skull and brain. Normally when a baby has anencephaly, we would never have done all the things we did at delivery to resuscitate her; we would have kept her comfortable but we wouldn’t have taken extraordinary measures.  We’d have allowed nature to take its course while Rosie stayed in your arms. The reason we did what we did was to allow you to see her alive because you were not able to be present at her birth, since her mother was in theatre under general anaesthesia.
Slowly, he begins to unbutton my shirt, lavishing me with kisses, and I am lightheaded. He knows what the feel of his mouth does to me, and he continues to do it. He tells me over and over how lucky he is to be my husband, and how he has waited forever for the right time for us to make love in this way. He caresses the skin of my chest. If there were a deity I believed in, I would be thanking them for the gift of my husband John Watson in this moment.
The answer seems to satisfy Sherlock. Owing to his medical background, John has no questions, and if he does, he is too emotionally wrung out, bone-deep exhausted, to know what to ask right now.
. I cannot fathom that something I want so much with a man to whom I would give my soul can possibly hurt, but I trust my beloved John.
“Mmmmm, sooner rather than later, John,” Sherlock breathes out. His voice is tinged with a whimper of desperation.
He takes a seat offered him by the nurse and gingerly, like a flower he doesn’t want to bruise, John places his index finger inside his daughter’s tiny hand. When her fingers curl around his, John understands in that moment what kind of love brings grown men to their knees.
John reels under the weight of those words. As a physician he knows them but as a father it is too much.
'Epistola' is one of several Latin words for 'letter,' and you will quickly see why I've chosen this as the chapter title.
They stumble into Baker Street dead on their feet, emotionally drained at the day’s events, but there are things they must confront before they go back to the hospital, where they know they will be asked to say goodbye to Rosie. John has asked the doctors and nurses to give them a night for them to come to terms with it. Grieving on a night of rest will undoubtedly be slightly easier.
"Doctor Watson, your pants," grunts Sherlock, the only four words he can manage to string together coherently.
“Sherlock, let me finish, please. You were talking to Rosie so tenderly. What you don’t know is that I overheard what you said to her. I heard you talking and didn’t want to disturb the moment for you, so I waited. And what you said. About….me. I heard you.” Johns hand clenches and unclenches.
After swallowing the last pulse of come, John pulls off, tells Sherlock how utterly gorgeous he is when he comes, and leans up to kiss Sherlock’s mouth, bracketing his body around Sherlock’s, when he realizes that he’s crying. He kisses Sherlock, the salt of Sherlock’s come and the salt of his own tears mingling on their lips. They kiss like this for what feels like forever.
Rebecca stands quietly by Rosie and her fathers as Doctor Smithson explains what the nurses have no doubt heard many times over. He explains that Rosie’s life support will be gently and gradually withdrawn, starting with the most invasive and ending with the least invasive, in order that her final time on earth be as comfortable as possible for as long as possible. In Rosie’s case, this means the endotracheal tube connecting her to a ventilator will be removed first, followed by her cardiac leads and pulse oximetry probe, and lastly the intravenous line going into her umbilical vein giving her the medications that have been maintaining her blood pressure. Any medications needed from here on out will be given in small amounts under Rosie’s tongue to be absorbed into her system. The doctors and nurses silently pray that she will not need any medications, that her death will happen quickly and peacefully. John and Sherlock would too, if they prayed or knew what to pray for.
“Excellent questions. For starters, all babies are kept warm in utero, and anything we can do to recreate the uterine environment will, we believe, help Rosie feel more comfortable. We can use heated blankets to help her stay warm, we can swaddle her if you want us to so that she feels secure, and we will not do any more procedures to her. No more poking, prodding, and definitely zero needles. If she displays signs of pain, or if it looks like she is working hard to breathe, we can give her a small dose of oral morphine to ease both the pain and the work of breathing. Of course, the best source of comfort will be for her to be held and loved by her family. She can stay skin to skin, just like she is with you now, Mister Holmes, for as long as you and her father want. In any case, she will sense your presence when you are close to her, so we encourage unlimited family presence.”
“Jesus Christ, you beautiful man, let’s get you off in both our hands,” John gasps after the last tremors of orgasm have abated.
Sherlock’s eyes well up with tears, and John’s betray him as well, despite his determination to keep his lips pressed into a thin line and take care of business with the stoicism that had served him well in Kandahar.
. No time to do a proper abdominal prep, just put her to sleep, throw some antiseptic on her belly and cut. Getting baby out quickly will be their top priority.
Sherlock picks up the petri dishes and lays them back down, then the tongs, the graduated cylinders, the beakers, the safety goggles, then the container of eyeballs, and all the other pieces Molly has found for Sherlock’s perusal. He is honestly not sure what to pick up first, and of course he wants to take it all home. “This is quality equipment; dreadful for them that they can’t use it, but excellent for my plans at home,” Sherlock muses with a grin spread from ear to ear.
The two men shower and change into their pyjamas, and John brings his pillow down from the second bedroom.
“Of course I do; you’re my best friend and right now the person helping me keep my head on my shoulders.”
“I believe you understand what I am saying,” Dr. Smithson continues, “but I want to state it explicitly. We don’t expect Rosie to live long; normally, babies born alive with anencephaly live anywhere from a few minutes to a few days. It is exceedingly rare that they live longer than that. We will help you as much as we can while she is with us. As her father, you are welcome to come and visit her anytime, and you or her mother can bring one support person of your choosing. Normally we do not do all the things we have done for Rosie when we are caring for a baby with anencephaly, but we felt it very important in this case to keep her alive until you could see her. We were able to place intravenous access through her umbilical vein instead of poking her skin, so we were able to avoid causing her pain.
After several more minutes of John’s three fingers inside me, he crooks his fingers – he is a physician, I remember – and brushes my prostate. It causes a deep, warm sensation inside my pelvis and I moan loudly, begging him to do it again. He obliges me. I still want his cock, but this is….quite agreeable.
Dr. Smithson reassures John that he is far from the first father to buckle in the knees at the burden of words dispensed by a stranger.
John is a man who keeps things bottled up, afraid to spill over, terrified of others’ reactions if they see his vulnerability. Years of an abusive alcoholic father taught him to keep to himself, the more unobtrusive the better. This, though, is the single most important thing John has ever done.
John exhales loudly, cracks his knuckles, and rubs a hand over his stubble. “Yes and no. She’s stable for the moment. Mary lost a lot of blood before she died and it affected Rosie’s heart and kidneys, but they were able to give her fluids and meds to help compensate. But she-……..she has-“ John’s voice cracks, “……she has anencephaly.”
”Can I bring lunch?” John speaks so quickly it takes Sherlock a little while to process what he’s saying.
“You use flannels to clean up the ejaculate, you stuff the used ones down the bottom of the hamper and you think I don't notice.” For the first time, Sherlock flashed a quick smile. “Which of course, I do.”
”Erm, well. Yes, I suppose there was. He was working a lot, around the clock I think. And there was… well there was some other stuff as well. Although I can’t really say, I- I didn’t see him that much to be honest. My wife and I recently had a baby, and…” John became quiet again, thoughts swirling around.
”What the hell was Lestrade doing in a patrol car?” Sherlock spits out. He’s gone from mellow to absolutely focused in no time, eyes wide, body tense, his full focus on what Sally is telling him. This is the Sherlock that John remembers, from all those years back. Hasn’t changed.
Sherlock was relaxed by now, and able to fully enjoy it when John slowly started to fuck him properly. He hung his head down between his arms, and was able to see a little bit of it all. His erection had waned as John had entered him, but the sight that met him was enough to cause his dick to start to fill with blood again.
Sherlock was standing, alone, casually leaned against a wall. He was dressed in a slim, dark suit, and John noticed his hair was a little bit longer than usual. The locks fell in a slightly unruly manner over his head, touching the collar of the suit jacket in the neck.
”Take a break, why don’t you doc. It’s just a little coke, no need to get your pants in a twist here.”
’ and smile, then refocus back to the amazing fact that he was allowed to trace his fingertips in circles on Sherlock’s smooth, pale chest. That he was allowed to feel this happy.
Sherlock looks down into the floor. Swallows, his throat feels tight. John apparently takes pity on him, because he’s coming closer, gives Sherlock’s upper arm a quick brush.
“To freedom.” John emptied his glass, coughing a bit as the strong liquor made it's way down his throat.
“That is not what I'm referring to. John, allow me to be blunt. To my brother, you were the sun in his universe. For five bloody years, you were all he ever talked about. The only one he would listen to. When you walked into a room, you were all he would see. And yet! Who was it that gracefully accepted to be the best man at your wedding? Who stood by you in every step of the way towards your marriage to Mary? Who even took a man’s life to keep you and Mary safe? My brother, the dragon slayer.”
”It’s been a while,” John said without thinking, and then braced himself for the inevitable comeback.
”Say hi to your little nugget from us,” Mummy says, which Sherlock finds excessively stupid since Rosie obviously has no idea who any of them are.
John sighs. ”It’s New Year’s Eve. You should’ve given yourself some time off, instead of spending it running around town chasing criminals.”
With great fondness he thought about what had been his favorite part of that night, Sherlock and him sitting in their chairs at Baker Street, laughing and being silly and very drunk.
”Do you know what I’m saying?” he asked, and when Sherlock managed to say yes, he was rewarded with another soft kiss on the lips.
All that work, wasted in a matter of an evening. And then John had said that thing and acted like he was actually going to kiss him. That, he couldn’t even begin to comprehend. Sherlock had never been able to form a proper understanding of what John was thinking about him.
He’d felt insanely relieved when they had parted ways in the late afternoon - John to drop of Anna, and Sherlock to go straight home to recuperate before dinner. The flat had never before seemed so wonderfully quiet.
”But it’s just words! If I say the exact same words, and I say them because I really want you to feel good about being with me, then what difference does it make?”
”You say that you love Sherlock, but look at your recent actions! He was in a bad state after you got married. You weren’t there to see it, but I was. And I was more worried for him than I’ve been in many years. But then, completely unexpectedly, Gabriel showed up again. And suddenly, things got better.”
”Don’t think you have to get up on the barricades for my sake, John. I rarely find it’s worth the while, myself.”
He had turned to John and was now staring intensely at him, with a look that John interpreted as…disdain? The previous warmth that had been lingering between them, just before, was all gone.
Those were words that Sherlock had never once said out loud. Nor had he heard them spoken, to him that is, before he had met Gabriel. His parents were caring and respectful, but not the types to get all mushy like that with their children. Most of the time they hadn’t been home anyway, and nannies had come and gone in a steady stream, usually taking off by slamming the front door, with tears in their eyes and promising to never return.
He tears himself away from the image for a moment, tries to catch Sherlock’s eyes. What he’d really like to do is to just get up and hug him, squeeze him tight. Sherlock meets his eyes with an unsure look on his face. John smiles.
John’s arm, the one he’s supporting himself on, is trembling from the strain. He’s stopped kissing Sherlock and is just leaning his forehead against Sherlock’s, they’re both slick with sweat, hot breath on Sherlock’s face.
A little shiver of excitement runs through him, even though he knows that Sherlock in all likelihood does not mean it the way John’s just read it. Still… can’t he allow himself to dream a bit? Quickly, he replies.
It was John. It really was. Last time, this had ended so badly but that had come later. The night they’d shared, fifteen months ago, was still firmly locked in as a happy memory and he had refused to let it get tangled up with the painful aftermath. Refused.
John held himself up on his elbows, one on each side of Sherlock’s shoulders, and then he grabbed Sherlock’s face, took it between his hands; leaned down and kissed him.
The list. Mycroft. Mummy, maybe. Lestrade? Yes. Molly, hm, yes. Anyone else? He considered. This would have to do.
The champagne turned up the buzz, and an hour later, John found himself standing with the others by a neon lit bar in the restaurant’s large outdoor space.
Somehow they ended up in bed, again. And somehow they managed to spend the better part of the Saturday there, too, with variations of the same kind of activities they had been up to before, but most of the time just lying tangled up in each other, talking.
”I… I just think he’s been really busy and I mean, so are we. It’s just how it is. The priorities are different right now. Don’t worry about it. I’m sure we’ll pick up eventually,” he said, hoping Mary would drop the subject. Thankfully, she did.
”It’s a good thing, then,” John said with a smile before he kissed him again, ”that you’re anything but.”
Sherlock never asked anyone for advice. He wondered if he’d ever asked John? He certainly could have. Certainly had gotten it without asking, on many occasions. John always knew the right things to do.
”Ready?” said Sherlock, by now almost jumping with excitement. He reminded John of a little boy on Christmas - which in a way, John thought, was precisely what he was.
”John!” a voice called out. Nigel, the clinic's pediatrician, was waving his hand from a table in the corner. ”It’s about bloody time you broke free for a night,” he said with a laugh and a rough pat on the back as John joined them. There were about eight people there from work, and someone quickly shoved a cool pint into John’s hand.
The girl leaned forward to do the same. He noticed she wasn’t able to coordinate her lips sufficiently to blow the air stream in a focused direction, but choose not to try to correct her. He blew again, a bit harder. The girl did the same. She was looking back and forth between the butterfly and him, smiling.
Eventually, it seemed to work, because she calmed down and stopped shouting. She sat down in the arm chair again, rubbed her face, exhaled. John remained silent, took the opportunity to regroup and collect himself.
”Thanks John, but I actually need to leave,” Sherlock said apologetically. ”There’s, eh, somebody waiting for me at home.”
But he had hidden John’s identity discs, nestled them inside a tied up scarf, pushed it all the way back in his underwear drawer.
He was of average height and weight, olive skinned, with short hair. He had thick framed glasses and was wearing jeans, trainers and a hooded sweatshirt, with a print on the front depicting a set of DJ-type earphones. Indian decent, upper middle class background, oldest of three siblings, parents still married.
”You did,” said Sherlock, and John was very pleased that he could still get Sherlock to blush once in a while.
.. that was what his mates in the army had begun to call him, after a while. He’d acted like he hated it, would never in a million years have admitted that it actually had made him secretly proud.
“What was that?” John said rather loudly. He wasn't going to let Sherlock so easily off the hook this time.
He didn't want Sherlock to in any way feel rejected or ashamed, and also, he surprised himself in feeling that he didn't mind, not one bit. So, he swallowed, swallowed again, kept Sherlock's cock in this mouth until the jerking and bucking had stopped completely, then he let go. Above him, Sherlock was leaning back in the chair, panting violently.
The chief physician standing at the edge of his bed was a woman in her early sixties. Her gray hair was elegantly styled, and her eyebrows perfectly shaped and filled in with a pencil. She held herself with a ballerina’s grace.
He grabbed Sherlock, one strong hand on his arm, the other back around his neck, and pulled him away, pushed him out from the dance floor and away from the crowd.
In the backseat, only John and him, a thick bullet proof shield between them and the driver. It seems surreal, sitting there with John less than an hour after saying what he’d thought was their last good bye.
”Loo? Go first if you want.” John nods towards the door, and yes, come to think of it, he actually needs that quite badly. Still half hard but manages, anyway. Washes off quickly and brushes his teeth while he’s at it.
They all broke out in a loud laugh, and even John couldn’t help but join in. Sherlock’s grumpy expression gave way, now he was basking in the attention from the others. And in the midst of laughter, John finally managed to catch Sherlock’s eyes, and to his enormous relief, he could see that his defenses were down at last.
”I can’t stop thinking about you, Sherlock. These last few months, I’ve missed you so much I thought I’d go crazy. I feel like-”, he hesitated for a moment, spoke in a quiet voice, ”like we belong together.”
He was taking medication to be able to fall asleep, but each night he would wake up in the early morning hours in a cold sweat, from the same nightmare about Sherlock falling, falling, falling; always startled awake with an anguished scream the second before Sherlock hit the pavement.
It was building up, furiously, maddeningly. The telltale feeling in his groin, the rising tension in his body-
