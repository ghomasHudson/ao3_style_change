The light from the window roused John early the next morning. He shifted slightly, but felt long arms enveloping him. A smile played across his face, and he snuggled his head closer into Sherlock's chest. It was warm and lovely here.
He was dressed in his old army uniform, clean and sharp as his days in the war. Fatigue pants with a thick, dark olive belt. A grey shirt tucked neatly into them. His pants were cuffed twice above the aforementioned heavy combat boots. A chain peaked its way out of his shirt, looping around his neck. The outline of two circular pieces of metal jutted out underneath the fabric around his chest.
Sherlock clambered to the floor, inserting himself between John’s legs, his long fingers wrapping around John’s thighs and squeezing with pure desperation. Sherlock wanted John, wanted to please him, wanted to do
“You have no idea how much the sight of you taking my cock down your throat turns me on,” John whispered heavily. “It turns you on too, doesn’t it?”
John grimaced, flattening the blanket back in place. The absence of Sherlock’s warm body was abrupt and unwelcome. He looked up, more alert.
But, the fatigues did something for him. He paused, his mind taking calculations. Yep, definitely did something for him.
“That is not my name, soldier. You will address me as Captain Watson or Sir at all times. Is that understood?” John cut him off, his tone firm. Heat pooled around Sherlock’s groin, and he fought to suppress a moan.
Confusion tugged at John’s sleepy mind. Surely Sherlock knew that John knew. It was pretty obvious. But, for some reason, Sherlock didn’t want to make it explicitly known. Was he embarrassed by it? Trying to suppress it? Did he think John would rebuke him for it?
Sherlock’s eyes flitted open, and he cleared his throat. He leaned back up, placing a hand against John’s chest. John caught the hand with his own.
John tightened his grip on Sherlock’s neck briefly, pushing him back forcefully. Their mouths separated with a wet pop.
“You’re going to make me fall back asleep if you keep doing that,” John griped, though he had no real objection to the touches. He never did.
John’s feet were planted shoulder length apart, his hands clasped behind his back. His face was set, his mouth in a thin, authoritative line. His hair was neatly combed to the side, the front swept up with gel. He tipped his chin up at Sherlock, cocking an eyebrow. Sherlock forgot how to breathe.
“I know. As do I,” Sherlock said. He turned fully, and John took a small step back. The chair underneath him squeaked in protest.
, his chest glistening with sweat, the dog tags slapping wildly against his skin, that dark olive belt still loose on either side of John disappearing into Sherlock, the spitting image of a captain, of Captain John Watson, in his fatigues and those damn combat boots, and Sherlock threw his head back against the mattress with a wail as John angled himself perfectly to catch his prostate with each maddeningly hard thrust.
“You think you have what it takes to be part of my regiment?” John asked, a bit quieter now. He took the silky fabric of Sherlock’s shirt between his fingers, rubbing his thumb over the first button.
now, and he was Sherlock’s, and John still found himself in denial about it sometimes. He had been in denial about having feelings for Sherlock in the first place, but when they finally came around to realizing it, finally confessed it and lived in it… it was just right. It had always been right, from the moment John had laid eyes on the man staring into a microscope at Bart’s. Some things never changed.
Sherlock removed his shirt next, his long, lithe fingers unbuttoning his cuffs, first the left, then the right. He shrugged the garment off with no hands, the silky fabric leaving his skin exposed to the air, first his shoulders, his upper arms, his forearms, swinging it around his body as it cleared his hands. The shirt joined the dressing gown, laying on top in a heap.
Sherlock stalked across the room, his loud steps reverberating throughout the small space. He picked up his red dressing gown from the back of his armchair, pulling it over himself before sitting down hurriedly. His left leg came up over his right, his ankle resting neatly on his right knee.
him. But it didn’t. God, it didn’t; it did the exact opposite. His eyes shot up to John above him, and his breathing stuttered to a standstill.
A sound caught his attention. A very loud sound; clamping footfalls in John’s old room. Sherlock cocked his head slightly. Was John in his old room? What was he doing up there? John’s distinctive gait moved slowly, coming to rest at the top of the staircase.
After a few minutes, John’s mind was beginning to slow, and his breathing became more even. John’s thoughts began to wander, and eventually they settled on the unexpected blowjob he had received earlier in the day from Sherlock. His mind played with the tendrils of the why’s, but John knew. He had pulled rank on a young corporal that day, and it had set Sherlock off.
Sherlock didn’t reply, just stared back at him, the silence of the room loud with the ticking of the ancient grandfather clock in the corner.
“Thanks, I think,” He replied, eyes darting around them. “I…” He started, contemplating his schedule,
“How are you doing?” She asked simply, directly. It wasn’t a question he heard often and it wasn’t one he had a ready answer to. He grunted a little in response.
“Yes,” John called back, stepping away, clearly flustered. His hand coming up to the back of his neck again, gaze roaming; the sky, the ground, his feet, “I should…” He said to Sherlock.
John shook the thought away, realising quite suddenly that this was somewhere he intensely didn’t want to be. He put down his half-finished drink on the nearest table and pulled the tinsel from around his neck, discarding it at the same time.
“Can I borrow your phone?” The stranger asks suddenly, drawing John’s attention back from the rush of scenery. He turns to find both his new travel companion and the catering assistant staring at him.
“Of course I did, Sherlock,” John’s voice was barely more than a desperate whisper, he raised his face to smile at him, “Of course I do.”
Inside, John was framed clearly in the window, rifling through the side pockets of his pack, looking for something. Sherlock watched him, willing him to look up, to look at him, but the man behind the glass kept searching, unaware of his audience.
“Oh, that’s a shame,” Mrs Hudson said, she was a terrible actor. “But it will give me a chance to get over and see Mrs S, she had her op a few days ago, I said I’d pop out and get her a few bits…”
“So,” Johns says when the silence reaches its peak. “I should probably ask if you’d come away from the edge?”
Since that evening alone in a strange restaurant he’d thrown himself back into his life in the present: a drink with Mike in the local, lunch with Molly, this cake with Mrs Hudson. There was even the suggestion that he and Mary “go for a drink sometime”. But he wasn’t sure what to make of that yet.
Sherlock, his attention drawn despite his best efforts, turned from the window to study the bright reception around them. The office seemed to be doing everything in its power to give the impression of success: the high floor, the large windows with a view that everyone passing was far too busy or blasé to notice, the fish tank. Frankly, the fish tank seemed a little too on the nose, the creatures within it hanging disinterested half way up a glass box, separated from the world outside.
The expression is still the same however, nothing will change that, a kind of knowledge about the eyes, as if he’s forever deducing. John recognises it as the same one he’d worn the day they’d met, all those years ago in St Bart’s and then again, in this room, when he’d presented the surroundings to John with pride. It had even made an appearance in the seconds before their first kiss, right there, on that sofa. John knows it better than he knows the expression he sees every morning in the mirror.
“A jumper,” One of the nurses had told him as he was wrapping up his shift, “On the roof. Causing a bit of a stir,” she’d added as blue lights had flashed past the window, reflecting tiltingly on the vibrant pink of her hair.
“Looks like it’ll have to be.” John’s tone is defeated, even as he holds a stranger down. “Soft ones.” He clarifies, eyeing the thinness of the man’s wrists. He looks like a strong wind could blow him over.
“This is Angelo,” She offers to John, her gaze flicking between the two of them. “Angelo and I have known each other forever.”
John looks over at the woman opposite him as the waiter waves them to their seats. It’s their first date and so far it seems to be going well: a friendly greeting, a kiss on the cheek. She’d even laughed a little as John had cracked a rather lame joke about the uselessness of the London transport system, holding the door open for her to step inside.
“I mean, well…” John started haltingly, “If there was someone, someone that didn’t know what the world looked like…”
“You didn’t seem to do a lot of it at the last party,” Molly pointed out, “Just lurked in the shadows and disappeared home without saying goodbye.”
Before another thought. This time of Sherlock’s foot, reaching out from his perch on the sofa, tapping at a broken shard of plate glinting in the bright dark of the London night.
“I know you’re an Army doctor and that you’ve recently been invalided home from Afghanistan. I know you’ve got a brother with a bit of money who’s worried about you  but you won’t go to him for help because you don’t approve of him – possibly because he’s an alcoholic; more likely because he recently walked out on his wife.” John says nothing as the stranger continues, “And I know your therapist thinks your limp’s psychosomatic – quite correctly I’m afraid. That’s enough to be going on with, don’t you think?”
Stunned John lets out a short breath, sinking back into the sofa that seems to have miraculously found its way behind his knees. As he sits he realises that he’s still clutching the photo that Sherlock had been studying previously. It is of his wedding day. John and Mary standing beaming before a crowd of equally euphoric looking people. John is the happiest of all, looking as if he’s just won the lottery; his arm looped protectively around the waist of his beautiful new wife. Who has pink hair.
John still doesn’t know what to do. What to feel. Anger? Joy? Confusion? Perhaps a dumb stare will suffice. Dumb. Dumb in every sense of the word.
“Little brats,” The mother offers instead to John under her breath. Leading John-the-younger out of the curtained area with such force that the child is practically suspended aloft by his left forearm.
As he finishes speaking he slowly drops his arm, his aim arcing downward to the pile of discarded clothing and explosives on the floor.
It was some time after that that Sherlock, half way through his third beer of the evening, realised he’d not seen John in some time. He went in search.
It was as he dropped his face away from the stairs that his eyes caught on the old writing desk in the hallway and he noted passively that his letter was still in the pigeonhole, unclaimed. Then something tugged at his subconscious and he looked again. Rather than the white sheet of paper he’d tucked there, this sheet was blue. He stepped forward and retrieved it. On the front, in bold looped cursive was one word: John.
Raised voices across the room. John lifts his head to study the table beside them: a harassed looking mother with her three young sons, none of whom seem to want to sit calmly at a table and drink milkshakes when it is more entertaining to playfight with their brothers. The woman sees him looking and flashes him a tired smile.
John stopped, dumbfounded at the question. He had to take a shaky breath before opening his notebook again.
“Left it at home.” John dead-panned, still preoccupied. “Have you seen the results for the patient in 328?” He asked instead.
“Your rank is new.” The man begins, eyes flashing up to John’s face “You’re nervous. You have a medical band packed into the outside pocket of your bag, but you aren’t wearing it. Something you should to be proud of. But you aren’t. That tells me that at this point in your life it is the soldiering that comes first, not the medicine.”
The holidays came and went, Christmas barely more than a jolly light in the peripheries of Sherlock’s vision as he continued to work on the case. Plans were firmly in motion now, the gears turning finally in Sherlock’s direction,
He doesn’t resist, momentarily stilled to wordless understanding of John’s frantic action, he allows himself to be touched. To be held.
“John,” Sherlock’s voice is a low rumble. Across the space. Across two feet of it and books and papers and notes and Mrs Hudson’s nice wood floor, and broken crockery and broken promises.
On the screen was a picture of a picture: an old-fashioned Polaroid showing the prone body of a young woman stretched out on a burgundy carpet.
“A doctor!” Her sunshine mood seems to step up a notch, “No wonder. I could see that you know, you’re the caring type, I can tell. The way you stepped in when I was in such a fix. And offering to help me home! You really would be a right one to look after my Sherlock. If I was the matchmaking kind… I wonder if he would,”
Then abruptly something shifts: a tone, a feeling, an aura of something not quite in the room. John feels disconcertingly like some unseen finger has pressed the pause button.
“I’m merely pointing out the efficiency of using wheeled transport rather than relying upon your significantly reduced mobility,” Sherlock explains,
“I certainly hope so, Sir” John replied, grunting a little as the bars on the bed took the weight his cane usually bore,
“Bison, yes,” Sherlock’s real concentration was on the item he was unwrapping. Mrs Hudson turned back to him just as it appeared from it’s plastic prison.
“Well,” There could be something like a smile on Mycroft’s face as he leans back a little from the word, before he shakes his head fractionally: “I should get the doctor.” He says efficiently, striding from the room.
John politely decides not to point out that she was so recently eager to set him up with whoever this Sherlock chap is.
“I understand that you wish to continue with this doctor business…” Sherlock continues, John’s smile dies.
“Well, if you ever fancy bringing some of that sunshine down to my dark corner of the hospital, you know where I am.”
“Yes,” She stood up, making a shooing motion with her hands. “And I need to change, so you need to leave.”
John swims up through layers of unconsciousness to emerge into a bright white room; honeyed sunlight slanting in through the blinds on a distant strange window.
“Yeah, something called...” Lestrade was shuffling things around on his desk, the noise over the phone was unmistakable. “Cylidate. Not common, but her tests were positive.”
“We’ll write,” Said the third man dramatically, a hand on his heart in a mockery of a lovelorn sweetheart being left behind.
“It’s not your fault.” John’s eyes open again, to a startlingly familiar tableau. “It’s just… You keep… You keep saying things you’ve said before.”
“Well, good for Dr Osborne I guess.” John has a new respect for the man. “I didn’t know he had it in him.”
“You do know?” John’s words are so low he half wonders if he said them aloud, the question only half formed. “You should know. If you don’t, you should.”
John stares back at him with a sense of peculiar unreality. This man looks nothing like the Mike Stamford he knew at Bart’s.
So now the thanks! Thanks to all those that have read and reviewed so far and been so patient with me as I’ve updated. I think I’ve probably annoyed and confused you all in parts; alternatively you’ve been sitting patiently waiting for me to get to the point already.
John let himself through the front door of the building with shaking fingers, unheeding of whether or not the noise he made would draw the attention of Mrs Hudson. Once on the other side it took only three steps to cross the front hall and unceremoniously stuff the paper into the pigeonhole.
“And not that I don’t appreciate the man power you’ve assigned to this, I do” John says, looking around at the truly staggering amount of people currently stomping around in his living room, “But,” He looks back to Lestrade: “There’s something you’re not telling me.”
He no longer knew what to think regarding his correspondent. When he’d first seen the new letter, he’d grabbed for it eagerly, expecting another taunting missive from his mysterious M; something including a veiled reference to the new case or a new intimidation tactic. Instead he’d received a bizarre reference to a future date, and, well, neckwear.
“You know what,” he said, catching the eye of the patient, “Hold this,” he said to him, handing the man his cane, before removing the brakes from the bed, “MRI?” he asked the nurse,
John is sitting on the side of a now frustratingly familiar hospital bed, fully clothed and, for the first time since he awoke, shod in something more than hospital issue slippers. Sherlock stands before him, that beautiful suit and dramatic coat, his hands curled around the handles of the offending wheelchair. He shakes it slightly.
Sherlock’s fingers traced across the back of John’s hand, not the first time he’d touched him but so much more intimate than a handshake.
But John doesn’t know how to go on, how to articulate the strange awkwardness in the room. It crosses his mind that perhaps this was how it always was, before, when he wasn’t talking to a version of Sherlock created by his own subconscious. Of course the real Sherlock would seem a little different, if only by the fact that his every word isn’t dictated by the deep recesses of John’s mind.
“Sherlock…” There’s a voice over the man’s shoulder and a figure comes in to view: Lestrade, the officer from earlier. “I won’t have you badgering the witnesses.”
“Yes.” His voice is deep and somehow befitting of his features – pale and dark in equal measure. “An unfortunate consequence,”
“There’s been a fourth,” John hears him say into his phone, produced from nowhere. He's sitting bolt upright on top of John, his pale chest still glowing faintly in the dark room.
“More than I should probably admit to you, as a doctor I mean.” John continues. “Certainly more than my fair share.”
Then a noise, above him, ringing loudly in the silence of the house: a thump and something that sounded like the click of a sole on a floorboard. John’s eyes raised slowly to the ceiling above his head.
Sherlock told him about his cases, the people and the mysteries, and between them he told John of his life: his days living in London, more of what he loved of the city.
John inhales slowly, remembering the confusion, the rush of his words and the pitch of his voice. It was real. It could have been yesterday.
“You’re planning on getting dressed today?” Mrs Hudson asked from the threshold, the light from the hallway shining into the room from behind her.
“I guess it wasn’t much of a leap,” John feels a smile tug at the edges of his mouth; even as he drops his head to sigh back into this coffee cup.
“That sounds more like you.” Lestrade nods, turning away from them to walk back towards the uniformed figures in the hallway. John watches him go, seeing him speak with one officer in particular; a bear of a man who seems to struggle to fit himself in the narrow doorway.
Sherlock continues: “One loophole in that: Moriarty himself could call them off. I could have made him call them off. People are uncomplicated,”
“I didn’t know you so well then...” Molly’s eyes had filled with tears, she looked away to hide them. “He and I were friends.” She sniffed, “At least, I think he would have called me a friend… Can’t believe it’s been two years.”
He paid the driver with haste, thanking him profusely for the piece of blank receipt paper and the pen that he’d made use of on the journey across London. The note he’d written was now clutched close to his chest as if made of something precious.
“Any more mince pies?” Sherlock asked, as he was forced from his flat in the face of his boredom to see if Mrs Hudson might have the answers to keeping him entertained.
A man knocks into him roughly from behind, offering no apologies. John turns in time to see him push past impatiently, a long coat and a cloud of black curls.
He steps forward, and with effort drops to his knees in front of the man he loves, burying his head in his lap.
John goes on. “What I’m trying to say is; I know what death looks like. And it was you. Lying there. On the pavement. Covered in blood. I saw that. Do you have any idea how often I see that?”
“Yours,” Sherlock responds, “Theirs,” He nods down at the street below him, John thinks this may be the first time he’s added a physical gesture to support something he’s said, scare tactics aside. “All of you going about your lives, without seeing.”
It took John a full week and an embarrassing amount of aborted drafts to finish the reply. From the moment he’d been reminded of that strange encounter from all those years before, there had been something niggling at John’s subconscious. The whole experience had been too weird, to incongruous with everything else in his life.
Sherlock flew from the police car the moment it pulled up outside, fist banging on the front door. It was 10:30 on a Thursday morning, she had to be home.
Back to the notes, and the memories. His tea half-drunk by the time he surfaces from them: consumed automatically from the mug in his left hand while his right holds on to the past.
A full three seconds passed as John stood in the beam of her gaze, before finally she seemed to process the information he’d provided.
“Sherlock,” Sherlock corrects, taking it, “Good to meet you too, John,” But suddenly his smile fades, his cool fingers around John’s tightening as he steps forward to drop his face close to John’s ear. “John,” He says again, this time in a voice that is more intimate than a stranger’s should be, “Can you hear me?”
“I’m not sure.” John replies, but is aware that the words have stopped meaning anything. He’s no longer concerned with the sounds from his mouth, only the past remembered image of the person in front of him. A dark shirt: open at the collar, dark curls, pale eyes flashing in the streetlamp glow of the London night.
“You too, Mrs Hudson,” He turned to give her a kiss on the cheek before letting himself out into the bright summer day.
“And where’s the brother now?” John looks over at her for an instant and catches a flash of bright green eyes.
It had been cold when he set out that morning, the world holding its breath for the possibility of snow. It was that dark time of year in the come down after Christmas, when the world realises that winter isn’t all twinkling lights and jollity, but biting cold, grey skies and long nights.
She smiles in response, seemingly unaware of the fact that he is staring at her as if she were the last person in the world he expected to see standing in the hallway of her own house.
“We sat here and…” John said, dazed. He glanced behind him and back to Molly, his chest contracting at the memory of the day: the hopelessness, the fear, the desperation of the time after, the time he’d spent trying to save a stranger on the pavement.
If John didn’t know better he would wonder whether the sore feeling in the back of his throat was the threat of tears. The only thing John can think of to do against it is to lean forward and touch their lips together.
“I’m not sure what it is I’m going up to do.” John says, turning to the window as the train begins to pull away and watching as the faces of those left behind blur into obscurity. “It’s not as if I’m in much of a position to help out, financially, as you took great pleasure in pointing out.”
“Prepared for if the damage is permanent.” There’s a finality in the words that ups the rate of John’s heart marginally.
Finding he is still holding the mugs John sets them down amid the papers on the table, leaving his hands free to automatically pat at the non-existent pockets on his hastily constructed outfit. He realises the futility quickly, leaning to sift through the papers instead. He finds it beneath a stack of memories.
“He’s good, thanks, I think,” John replied absently, glancing at his menu. “You’ll be able to ask him yourself,” John continued, “Soon,”
The lift arrived and they stepped inside. Lestrade pressed the button for the fourth floor. They stood in awkward silence while they ascended.
John looks back at the chart he’s been handed on his way into the room. Yes. Stupid. The moment his beautiful dream had been shattered by his monotone alarm at some god-forsaken hour this morning he’d known that today couldn’t possibly be a good one.
Sherlock remained silent, his mouth working but no suggestions presenting themselves. His floundering was so uncharacteristic that it had her look back at him.
An hour later and the pot had been drained and the delicious freshly baked cake reduced to crumbs on their plates.
The man uses them as a tether, pulling John closer, curving and capturing John’s mouth against his own in one movement.
But he cut himself short when he looked back to the desk to find his roughly torn-off sheet was no longer there. Instead, in its place, was a neatly folded piece of blue note paper.
“You lasted half an hour longer than I expected you would,” Lestrade said, appearing through the door beside him,
“Lestrade, and the yarders. Turns out that cracks appear in a story pretty quickly if the person telling it disappears rather spectacularly overnight.”
“And it’s been very confusing, complicated and vaguely awkward speaking with you,” John repeats with a smile. Sherlock matches it slowly.
“You realise this isn’t the Edinburgh train?” He asks in faint Cockney accent as he scrutinises Sherlock’s ticket.
She made her way carefully in to the room, setting down a tea tray on top of a second box, perched on top a third, which was in turn atop the coffee table.
The man jumped off a roof, disappeared into the night, seemingly faked the whole thing and then put John through hell. But he’s here. John is damned if that’s not the best thing that’s happened to him in a long time.
“You told me to.” Sherlock’s face was barely a hairs-breadth from John’s, so close he could feel the words against his lips.
“Stop it!” John’s voice is louder. Anger again. “Stop that. Stop talking about it as if it’s something clever that you did Sherlock! The “cause and effect”, the details. The little things that made me think what I wanted to believe. I didn’t want to believe that Sherlock! I didn’t want to believe the person that meant the most to me in the world had done that. Done that to himself!”
“If you’re sticking around for a while we might need some new crockery,” John says as he makes his way back into the sitting room, tea in hand.
“Those three people aren’t the only ones who care about me.” Sherlock continued, the noise above growing, drowning out the sounds of London below. Sherlock had to raise his voice to be heard: “You forgot someone.”
“Well yes.” The man says with amusement, “She’s my eyes.” He finishes with a smile, his sightless stare giving the gesture a vague quality.
“No, not that either,” He replies with a smirk, mentally preparing himself for whatever she’ll offer in reply to this.
“Mrs Hudson.” Sherlock offers in explanation, gaze flicking up, John can only think he means to motion to the door behind him.
“Oh! Happy birthday,” A small voice cut in, and Sherlock was forced to acknowledge that he and Lestrade weren’t alone.
John couldn’t go back to work straight away. He knew it didn’t matter that there were things to attend to, or that he had rounds, or even patients. He knew he wouldn’t be able to do his job with those letters tucked in the pocket of his coat.
The Russian version of the Little Prince always creeped John out, but Sherlock loved the serene and surreal film. John had never been clear whether Sherlock understood every word of the Russian script or not a syllable, but either way, it absorbed the curly headed boy, caught between adulthood and infancy, innocence and wisdom, time and eternity.
Mrs Parkham released the boy from his chair, and John took his hand to support him as he toddled off towards the spacious bathroom.
"I think there's one corner over here we haven't explored yet, William Sherlock Scott of the Antarctic Holmes. I wonder what's behind these trees here?" asked the doctor, rhetorically. The Little hurried onwards.
"Ok. Take the boiler suit off again. No, you know how to undo poppers Little One. Just pull. No, like... Yes. Hold onto my shoulders while you step out of the legs. That's it. Now sit on my lap for a moment, and I'll undo your shirt for you. And pop your arms out? Trousers... No, you'll have to stand up for a moment. No darling, not the pull-up. No, you need that. Unless?"
Sensitive to any implication that he was not a real toddler, Sherlock's wails increased in volume. John was instantly stricken with guilt.
Sherlock looked as if he couldn't believe his luck in being allowed to sit so close to anything as dangerous as fire, and sat very still for fear of alerting his Daddy to the lapse of rules he had unaccountably permitted.
The Little Detective maintained what he felt was a dignified silence, sitting on his tin throne with his trousers round his ankles.
The Detective returned to his search, while the Doctor operated on the daisies, putting into practice long-forgotten skills to thread together the pretty flowers. Sherlock crawled back and forth, and after a few little journeys John leaned forward and placed a garland around his Little One's neck.
"Have you got your coat? And your Bunny? And you did a wee?" Sherlock nodded to each of these, so John gathered up the discarded pile of things, and ushered himself and his boy out of the door and into the back of a waiting car.
John struggled an awkward load of bags and coats and wellies under his left arm, and held out his right hand to Sherlock, who did not take it, but instead clung to the doorframe more tightly than ever. Sensing that his Little One's behaviour was truly a reflection of anxiety rather than pure naughtiness, the caregiver put down his miscellaneous collection of things, and pulled the boy towards him for a reassuring hug.
"You don't have to eat it all," laughed the farmer. "My husband and the farm workers will be eating after you. Eat all you want, but don't forget to leave room for cake!" She gestured to the pine dresser, where the largest, most beautiful Victoria Sponge sat on a stand, just waiting to be eaten.
"I did a bad thing and then I told a bad thing," answered Sherlock in a small voice, looking down at his bare knees.
"Ooh, you are a clever boy, Sherlock. Come here and give an old lady a kiss and tell me what else you did."
"Thank you, it's great to be here. We'll just, err... What do you say to the nice lady Sherlock? Sorry, he seems to have gone a bit shy. We'll be back in a moment"
However, as the Detective had deduced, the grown up was pretty keen to go himself. Sherlock began to squirm frantically but refused to let his caregiver help him out of his trousers, and John knew that the situation was reaching crisis point. Accepting the inevitable with a sigh, he moved his hand away from the other man's trousers and towards his own, and unzipped his flies.
"Rah" roared the dinosaur in reply, and soon the whale and dino were fighting it out for supremacy on the waves.
"Now then, this bit's difficult, so I'll put the crumpet on the toasting fork for you. There you are... So, kneel right here, that's it, and hold it over the flames. Alright?"
. That one's EASY!" And just like that, the Little Detective was off, prattling on about the drivers and passengers in the other cars on the road: the man going about his daily business as a tax inspector; the woman leaving her husband; the couple who had accidentally brought the wrong baby home from hospital in 1971 and never found out. John half-listened while scrolling through his phone to check arrangements.
Sherlock looked suspiciously at the proffered oatcake, before grabbing it and nibbling daintily at its edge. John returned to the kitchen, laid his head quietly against a cupboard door for a moment before decanting the milk from the cup to a baby bottle. Going back, he sat down by Sherlock, who now had biscuit round his mouth and down his shirt, and probably even in his nappy, but seemingly none in his tummy. John guided the detective's head against the front of his jumper, and Sherlock laid back quietly against him, taking the nipple as it was placed near his mouth, and began to suck. Soon his eyes were drooping closed with exhaustion, but he continued to drink hungrily, while John rocked him gently by his shoulders, making little shushing noises to keep him calm and settle him. As the bottle emptied, John stroked across Sherlock's cheek bone and exclaimed softly,
Settled comfortably with his back against the sofa, Sherlock sucked contentedly on a juice box, and bounced up and down excitedly as John put on his Captain Pugwash DVD. The doctor patted his head, and left him to shower and get dressed. Faint cheering and booing wafted from the living room as the crew of the Black Pig took on the evil scheming Cut-Throat Jake. John was always puzzled by the occasional gasps of surprise that accompanied scenes of mild peril: how Sherlock could possibly find anything remotely unexpected in a DVD he had seen so many times before was a persistent mystery to John's adult mind. It was adorable. And reassuring: while the detective was so engrossed in the TV he would not be getting into mischief during his Daddy's absence. John took advantage of the downtime to read a little, but when he heard the closing credits ring out for the fourth time he felt that he had left his little boy to his own devices for long enough.
"Oh," thought John, "This might not have been a good idea." He suffered through animal noises of varying levels of verisimilitude and noisy vowel sounds until the end of the song, and then turned off the music.
"I played on the SWINGS and I was in the LEAVES and Daddy didn't know where I was and he looked everywhere and I was in the LEAVES and he couldn't find me."
"Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!" they both grunted together in unison, laughing. John gently sat the Little Detective up.
"No, an accident is an accident: it's not naughty, and Daddy wouldn't be cross about that. Ever. So what did you do that was naughty?"
"Yeeaahhh…!" yelled Sherlock running towards a big pile of leaves and jumping right in, laying on his back and starfishing to make leaf angels, and for the joy of hearing and feeling the leaves rustling and crumbling beneath and around him. John laughed out loud at the happy scene, and settled down under a tree with a book and a flask of tea, but largely ignored the reading matter in favour of enjoying the sight of his boy playing. It was so rare that Sherlock had the chance to run around like a normal healthy child really needs: excited contentment was spreading from the detective in delightfully infectious waves.
"Oh Daddy! A playground! Can I play Daddy? Can I play on it please?" begged Sherlock, eyes round with wonder.
"Daddy beautiful too", he smiled up at him. The two continued to sit, happy and quiet until John's eyes began to droop, and Sherlock began to squirm away.
"Ok, out we get," encouraged John, holding his arms out with a fluffy towel patterned with a farm scene watched over by a benignly smiling sun. Sherlock heaved himself out of the bath and into his Daddy's arms for a warming hug.
"No. You nearly had an accident on the way here. No Sherlock. Although now you've taken it off, why don't you go and sit on the toilet and see if you can go while we're here?"
"That's my good boy. I'll remind you to think about it, and you won't be in trouble if you have an accident, ok?"
John wiggled his toes appreciatively towards the blaze, returning to his tea and his book, and wallowing in a sense of cozy well-being. After reading a couple of chapters his eyelids were beginning to droop, and half an hour later he snored himself awake to find his book had fallen to the floor, and its place in his lap had been taken by a sleeping detective wrapped in his arms. Despite the warmth from the fire, John's fatherly instincts caused his to worry that his nappy-clad Little One would be cold, but these same paternal feelings also prevented him from waking the boy to dress him. He leaned forward and pulled the woolen rug from the back of his chair, draped it over Sherlock's legs and feet, and cuddled the child more closely to him to keep out the chill. Sherlock stirred and nuzzled his head into John's shoulder, and soon began to blink awake.
"Ok Big Boy, I don't think Mrs Hudson needs to know about that bit." blurted John, blushing furiously. "Why don't you show her some of the lovely leaves you collected, hey?"
This was a polite fiction: the childishness of the detective's dress needed to be more ambiguous to escape censure in public. When his little one had been clad in dark green cotton cargoes with a comfy elasticated waist and had a cosy cable-knit jumper pulled over the frog t-shirt, John took a moment to ruefully consider the fact that most of the contents of his own wardrobe could be considered as essentially child-appropriate. He comforted himself with the thought that at least he was wearing snug red y-fronts under his jeans, rather than a nappy like Sherlock!
"Well, that was lovely singing Sherlock, but we wouldn't want you to wear out your voice, would we?"
On returning to the living room the doctor found the baby asleep. Loath to wake him, but knowing he would be better off in his bed, John roused him as little as possible, pulling him up under his arms and supporting him to the bedroom.
"You can have one last go on the swings, but you have to try to go for a wee first" said John seriously.
"Not quite yet. I think it might be Mrs Hudson who was ready to go to sleep," laughed the Doctor. "How about we watch a film before bed, hey? You think about what you want to watch, while I go and get us some snuggly blankets and cushions."
John gathered up supplies, bundled himself and his charge into coats and shoes and out of the front door. Predictably, a conspicuously inconspicuous car drew up, and the pair clambered in. The doctor buckled the detective in place, and handed him his bunny to keep him busy and quiet during the journey.
He held out green and white striped jersey shorts with a drawstring waist for Sherlock to step into.
John kept up a steady stream of quiet chatter in the car: about the joys of tea to come; the cozy fire; the story he would read at bedtime. Sherlock became steadily less responsive, and eventually dozed off, much as his caregiver had hoped.
"Brilliant choice," affirmed John. When he had been gently towelled dry, Sherlock lay back on the edge of the bed for John to tape him snuggly into a nappy which was cheerfully patterned with pastel-coloured lions and monkeys.
John sat back in his armchair, enjoying the scene as his excited little boy relayed the events of the morning with immense detail and little coherency. Despite the incomprehensibility of the story, the exchange seemed to be providing great satisfaction to both narrator and listener. John tuned back into the babble in time to hear Sherlock explain:
The lower infant lip wobbled slightly at this word which had so recently been the cause of so much trouble, but bravely steadied itself at the sight of the plate of savoury treats.
John continued to transfer crumpets from plate to fire to plate to while Mrs Hudson loaded them with butter, marmite or honey, according to the preferences of each. Sherlock (honey) was soon a sticky mess, but his good humour was entirely restored, and he submitted to his face, hands, arms, hair and legs being scrubbed clean with a flannel between crumpets by whichever grown-up was closest at the crucial moment. When the trio could eat no more, John returned to his armchair and held out his arms for Sherlock to come and rest on his lap.
"Careful of the teapot dear, it's hot," broke in Mrs Hudson, pulling back curious little hands keen to explore the shiny crockery.
The next morning, John was woken by wailing, and he honestly couldn't think of a better start to the day. He pattered downstairs into Sherlock's room.
"OK Little One, time for bed, I think," said John, rubbing small circles on the boy's back to lessen the shock of waking. "Someone is tired out. And I think you are too, Sweetheart".
The Doctor looked slightly anxiously at his Little One on grown up furniture, but he should have known not to worry. Mrs Parkham ("Call me Elaine, dear") bustled round and buckled the big boy into a sort of harness which attached to the chair to keep him securely in place, and then pulled a shelf out from under the table which slotted above his legs. John prepared a heaped plate of savouries for himself, deciding that it was least complicated to let Sherlock choose items from John's plate, rather than overwhelm him with the selection on the whole table. Sherlock pointed at a sausage roll, and John built himself a thick ham sandwich with hot mustard and creamy butter which had been made right here in the farmhouse kitchen. Mrs Parkham poured a cup of tea for herself and the Doctor, and brought over a tippy cup of barley water for the child.
John tucked his Little One up on the sofa. Sherlock held Bunny under his arm and stroked its soft furry ear with his right thumb and inserted his left into his mouth with his fingers hooked over his nose. At times the boy leaned forward, mouthing the words along with the characters. At others, he nestled amongst the cushions or against John's shoulder. As the film progressed, the nestling became more frequent than the leaning, and John made up a bottle of warm cocoa and slipped the rubber nipple between the sleepy baby's lips. By the end of the closing credits, the sound of suckling had been replaced with slow snuffly breathing, and the good Doctor was trying to decide whether to rouse the boy to get him into bed or whether to lay him down to spend the night on the sofa, when the bottle dropped from Sherlock's grasp onto the floor with a soft thud, waking the infant.
The older man also felt in need of a rest to recover from Sherlock's long morning play in the fresh air. Shedding shoes and coat, as soon as he had made a cup of tea, he sat down in his armchair to read as many chapters of his current novel as he could before his toddler awoke and demanded his attention again. John loved looking after Little Sherlock - it took a lot less tactical manoeuvring than dealing with his adult counterpart - but a few minutes alone for a bit of self-care was still a welcome reprieve. Sherlock's headspace age might remain unaltered by the passage of time, but John's joints certainly were getting older.
"Car is stole... Affaire... Needs a wee... Left the oven on... Needs a wee... Looking forward to something on Thursday... Bursting for a wee... Really bursting for a wee..."
Sherlock nods wearily. John leans over and picks up a floppy soft brown cuddly toy and takes Bunny and owner to the living room. He guides Sherlock to the corner, presses gently on his head, and hands him his rabbit. The detective takes it and hugs it eagerly, before slumping forwards with his head against the wall. John bends down to kiss the top of his head before heading to the kitchen.
"This," thought John - tea in one hand, book in the other, and a merry little boy in front of him - "This is what happiness looks like. Screw what the world might think of us."
"Eat your food, Sweetheart," coaxed the caregiver, as a lump of cereal splashed out and landed in Sherlock's hair. John congratulated himself for choosing breakfast before bath!
"I think that's ready now... Yes. I'll put it on a plate and you can carry it very carefully to Mrs Hudson."
Washed and relieved, the pair returned to the farmhouse kitchen with its traditional scrubbed wooden table, flagstone floor and large unlit inglenook fireplace. But neither noticed these charming details, distracted as they were by a feast of fresh goodies. Golden Scotch eggs, heavy pork pies, flaky sausage rolls, chilled lemon barley water, rosy apples, downy apricots, a baked ham, fresh cottage loaves, and salad leaves just picked from outside the door.
Sherlock issued his caregiver a dark look for spoiling his fun, but soon resumed playing peaceably enough. The whale and dinosaur now seemed to be being taught about the scientific properties of bubbles, and also, more importantly, how to pop them. John resumed shaving to the conversational sounds of a T-Rex and a cetacean who apparently did not mind being patronised by a 6-foot baby.
Sherlock wavered, indecision etched in every line of his face and body. He didn't want his nappy changed, but he didn't want a smacked bottom either.
"What noise does a lion make, Little Monkey?" prompted John, who pretended to cower as Sherlock roared and bared his teeth.
"Come here. Over my lap." He stroked the boy's hair for a moment to remind him he was still loved although he was being punished. Then the father raised his hand, and smacked his friend twice quickly across his bare behind.
"Oh, good choice Sweetheart," praised John. "Now, put the other toys back in the basket. Well done! Ok, come over here and let Daddy help you into the bath. No, give me the toys for a moment. Good boy."
It was only a few steps over to the barns, so the farmer drove them out of the farmyard, over a small stream, and down to a large duck pond, before bringing the party back to the main entrance to the sheds. The tractor slowed to a halt, and John lifted his boy down from the trailer, and gave his hand a squeeze as the three happy people went on to the main event.
Making a quick recovery from the disappearance of his beloved Pugwash, Sherlock looked up questioningly. It wasn't often that he got to go out in Littlespace.
Daddy attempted to look stern at this further breach of manners, but instead burst into laughter. He might be setting a poor precedent, but the look of astonishment on the boy's face was just too funny. Sherlock began to laugh too, more out of sympathy than understanding, and was soon rolling around on the rug kicking his legs in the air and clutching at his nappy area. Once the Doctor had calmed himself, he stroked Sherlock's back and helped him to breathe more slowly to calm him down.
"Alright, Little Frog, let's hop to the lounge and you can watch cartoons while Daddy gets dressed."
"No. You disobeyed Daddy, and then you lied about it. I told you to go to the toilet before we left the flat, and you clearly didn't, but then when I asked you, you said you did! Why did you do that?"
"Hello dears! Did you have a lovely time playing outside Sherlock?" cooed Mrs Hudson, who had been a co-conspirator in organising the morning's outing.
Unable to resist, John snapped a photo of the Little in the leaf pile, his auburn hair blending with the autumnal foliage. The doctor crouched down by Sherlock and began to bury him in the leaves.
"SEESAW!" yelled Sherlock, and against his better judgement John helped him to climb up before seating himself at the other end. Sherlock loved the feeling of flying through the air, but the old soldier's knee soon began to bother him, and he was forced to persuade the excited Little to choose another game instead. John held the boy by the shoulders, grounding him and keeping him focused.
"One last go in the playground. I'll call Uncle Mycroft to pick us up in half an hour, yeah?" As Sherlock's face began to fall, John added swiftly "What about the seesaw? You haven't been on that yet."
"I do it myself!" exclaimed the boy in an offended tone, as if such a matter could never have been in doubt. He happily began to mould the mush into hillocks in his bowl, before splatting it flat with his green plastic spoon.
John placed them on the edge of the bath where Sherlock would not need to lose sight of them, making the whale do a little dance to make his boy laugh. He held both his hands while he stepped into the bath, and helped him to sit down without slipping. John placed the two toys into the bath, and the book on the side within reach. Sherlock submerged the whale with one hand.
"No-o-o!" shrieked Sherlock, who was apparently horrified by the suggestion and began shovelling thoroughly mashed cereal into his mouth faster than he could swallow it. As much seemed to end up on the detective as in him, and John tried not to look at the state of the table and surrounding floor. Having finished his juice while playing with the solid food Sherlock began to roll the lidded cup with his right hand while trying to finish his food with his non-dominant left. This did not go well, and John was just thinking that Sherlock had perhaps eaten enough and could be let down from the table when a panicked look shot across the boy's face.
John sighed, and thought for a moment. It was a warm day, and if he was complaining he was too hot now, he would be even hotter running around outside.
One last magical run through the leaves, swing through the air, and slide down the slide (John knew he was weak to give in), and it was time to go. It wasn't often that it was possible to spend Little time outside, and both men were sorry to leave, but Sherlock looked weary, and John didn't want him to get over-tired and fractious. Time to go home.
"Oh. Well, I can feed you with this sweetheart." At this the sobs become more passionate and more distressed.
"So are you now," replied John, catching Sherlock in a hug as he arrived at the bottom of the slide once again. But Sherlock was in no mood for hugs right now, and was soon off and running towards a set of swings.
John pulled him in to a reassuring side hug, and as his baby nestled wearily against his shoulder, the good Doctor leant towards the intercom.
Sherlock leaned forward, plucked a nearby daisy, and slowly picked off the petals one by one. When he had completed his important task he crawled away, picking and gathering flowers before returning and depositing them in John's lap.
"What was all that about, hey?" A comforting squeeze to Sherlock's drooping shoulders. "What was so bad about getting out of a smelly old nappy and into a nice clean one?"
The boy was still tense and upset, but the crying began to abate and eventually resolved to occasional hiccupping sobs between shaky intakes of breath.
Removing his hand from Sherlock’s hair, John found his way down to his belt. His fingers unbuckled it slowly, the two ends pushed to the side. The buttons of his pants came undone, the fly slowly unzipped. Sherlock groaned. All he could do was wait. Wait and burn. It was tantamount to torture at this point. His cock throbbed, still restricted in bloody clothing. Sherlock resented his clothing at this very moment. Envy washed over him as he watched John work to free his own erection.
Sherlock strode over to the dresser, pulling out a clean outfit. He shed his pyjamas quickly, leaving the clothing on the floor.
John fell on top of him, his arms giving out. The room stilled, the two men’s shuddering breaths seeming almost foreign, much too quiet compared to moments ago. John’s body twitched lightly, his skin pulsing with aftershocks. Sherlock stared at the ceiling, still trying to contemplate all of it. The weight of John on top of him was grounding, both of their chests warring against each other as both of their breathing struggled to return to normal. John's wild heart beat resonated through Sherlock's body, matching his own.
John’s fists subconsciously balled up the impossibly soft blanket around him, as his mind reeled with possibilities. It was a little over the top, really. Nonetheless, a wicked smile spread across his face. He enjoyed pulling rank. But pulling it on Sherlock? The genius, the world’s only consulting detective? The man who had to get the last word with everybody? Arousal rushed in heated waves over his body.
Sherlock was impatient now. Too impatient. “Captain Watson,” he almost spat out, a question and a statement rolled into an almost irritated tone.
“Yes, sir,” Sherlock replied, a bit more assuredly now. His cock throbbed at the sound of his own voice admitting submission.
“Good morning.” Sherlock’s voice was more awake than John had expected, and he lifted his head up to peer at him.
“Right. Don’t leave me to sleep alone tonight, understand?” John said a bit louder now, hands slipping off of Sherlock.
“This is what you wanted, wasn’t it soldier?” John hissed into Sherlock’s ear. Sherlock could do nothing but nod into John’s neck, needy whines punctuating each stroke of his cock. It was everything,
“I love you, Sherlock,” John replied quietly. His hand snuck up to touch Sherlock’s neck, feeling the smooth skin under his fingertips. He tapped his neck lightly.
Sherlock’s breath quickened. He closed his mouth, suddenly conscious that it was still hanging open. His eyes began to wander, scraping over every minute detail of John’s appearance, making sure to store it away tightly in his mind palace. It would never leave, no matter how long he lived.
Sherlock reached his hand over to John, grabbing him by the chains of his dog tags, pulling John’s mouth onto his. John responded immediately, hand threading through Sherlock’s curls, their lips moving together slowly, tongues sliding languidly over each other. A couple of minutes passed before they separated. Sherlock smiled, pressing his forehead to John’s.
John’s eyes were wild, his formerly well manicured hair a mess and damp with sweat. His lips twisted into a devilish grin as he pushed Sherlock’s legs up to his chest. A wild animal ready to devour his kill.
“I wouldn’t be adverse to indulging that complex,” Sherlock replied, running the still-slick chain of John’s tags through his fingers.
“You know, you might have created a complex for me,” John said, slipping his arm over Sherlock’s chest, snuggling into his side.
He made quick work of his shoes, unlacing them and pulling them off along with his socks in one movement, setting them neatly on the wall.
,” John breathed out, his voice starting to shake. His cock was starting to swell against Sherlock’s skin.
“John,” Sherlock said, John whipping back around to look at him. “I love you. More than you could know.”
“I’m sorry to be leaving so early,” he said, moving to sit on the side of the bed. His hand stretched out, grabbing John by the back of the head, leaning down. John craned up to meet Sherlock, their lips meeting in a passionate kiss.
“It’s our day off, Sherlock,” John said, a hint of seduction rising in his voice. “Don’t let Lestrade get in the way of that.”
“Well, I’m quite pleased that's all over with,” Sherlock said, hanging his coat on the hook behind the door. “As expected, the chemical properties of the clay on the victim’s throat gave me enough information for the Yard to properly convict the strangler.”
, and Sherlock smiled. He brought his eyes back down to meet John’s, and John was palming at his still flaccid cock. Sherlock estimated it would be some time before he was hard again, his refractory period being at least twenty minutes. But whatever John planned on doing with Sherlock, he needed it now. He continued on.
“Captain Watson,” Sherlock addressed him teasingly, and John lips pulled into a mischievous smirk as well.
Lestrade had told him he was turning off his mobile today, and the entirety of the office was instructed not to contact Sherlock in any way. He thought he was forcing Sherlock to take the day off himself, but it was quite the contrary.
“Alright,” John replied, his hand stroking over those soft, dark curls again and again. Sherlock hummed, a deep contented sound in his throat.
“No, sir.” A small smile played at Sherlock’s mouth; he was fully committed to the role now. Only short, sharp answers. Sherlock was familiar with the way soldiers were expected to act in the presence of their superiors. And he would play the part of soldier well for John.
“Did you find that satisfactory, Captain Watson?” Sherlock asked, a rush of adrenaline pumping through his veins. A slight smile tugged at his lips.
John lifted his head, his mouth positioned at Sherlock’s ear. His teeth caught the lobe, sucking on it. Sherlock cried out again, his hips snapping into John’s grip.
“Captain- Watson-” Sherlock stuttered out, having trouble even forcing his vocal chords to cooperate, unable to finish the thought out loud.
John walked his way over to Sherlock, slowly, his boots accentuating each step on the hardwood floor, his hands still firmly clasped behind his back.
“Not even Lestrade could keep me from you. Not Mrs. Hudson, not Mycroft, not even Moriarty. Not today, John,” Sherlock said, abruptly rising from the bed.
Sherlock felt… bad. It was an unnatural slew of cases, unmoving and almost difficult. Almost. He didn’t mean to give off an uninterested aura. Quite the opposite, really. Sherlock missed him too. Craved his touch.
He breathed in, the smell of Sherlock potent and intoxicating on the bed. He nestled his head deeper into his pillow. Sherlock didn’t spare any expense on bedding, and John was grateful for it. It made for a much better sleep, that, good bedding and someone to share the bed with. John hadn’t slept as well as he had the last few months as he had in years.
John’s eyebrows lifted up, somehow only now just aware of how much of a mess Sherlock was at the moment.
, as if that word could touch the experience, was rapidly cooling on his skin. “You have no idea what you do to me in those fatigues,” he added with a grin.
“Thank you, John,” Sherlock said quickly, before taking a sip. He set the mug back down carefully, his eyes flickering to make sure nothing was in the way.
They moved against each other hungrily, and John moaned quietly. Sherlock’s tongue darted into John’s mouth, and John grasped at Sherlock’s arm desperately. Christ, Sherlock wasn’t being fair to him this morning.
He seemed completely normal, even after having shoved John up against the back of the door when they came back from their case that day, slipping to his knees immediately and sucking John off a tad forcefully, stalking off to their room after John took less than three minutes to come. He had emerged thirty minutes later when John had set dinner on the table.
His cock throbbed again, catching John’s attention. Sherlock brought his hands up to his shoulders, carefully peeling off his dressing gown, letting the fabric slide down his arms, caress his back, before holding the garment out in his right hand, letting it float to the ground with a
A smile formed over his mouth. Sherlock shivered. He had no idea what to expect now, now that they were here. The same place where Sherlock snuggled John in the early hours of the morning, wide awake, stroking his recently-greying hair as he slept peacefully, deep breaths pulling Sherlock into bliss. The memories flooded over Sherlock as he looked to the man in front of him now, legs spread wide, cock still hanging between them, grey shirt begging to be ripped off of his chest, his combat boots twitching slightly as John readjusted his foot. God, Sherlock needed to get off. Needed it more than he needed air.
Sherlock’s pulse picked up, heat spreading through his skull. He had never seen a rough John. Was it his birthday?
Sherlock cried out as a second finger entered him, twisting and pumping in and out, his prostate being brushed expertly by the doctor with each pulse.
Before thinking about it, Sherlock’s hands reached up to his nipples, flicking over them, rolling them between his fingers, a low moan escaping his throat as he tipped his head to the ceiling. That was sure to catch John off guard.
John was far gone. His eyes were closed, his face a thing of beautiful pleasure. Sherlock wasn’t quite sure if he was dreaming or not, but if it was a dream, then it had to be the best dream in existence.
Sherlock moaned, his mouth forced open by John’s eager tongue. He fought back with his own, the two warring, tasting each other, John licking up whatever remnants of his own come remained in Sherlock’s mouth. Sherlock pressed into him harder, grasping onto the sides of John’s neck with both of his hands, his knee forcing its way between John’s and the edge of the armchair. He thrust forward, his cock finding purchase against John’s waist, and little noises escaped his throat with each thrust.
Sherlock slammed the door behind him, taking the steps up to 221B two at a time. The steps groaned and squealed beneath his footfalls. Sherlock was in a great mood, his coat swirling about him as he reached the landing to the flat.
Sherlock growled, his movements being guided by the hands pressing down on him. He lifted his eyes to John, surprised to see John staring right back at him. His teeth were clenched together, his eyes wide open.
John’s head snapped up against him. His hand released Sherlock’s cock, fingers exiting him, and a whine escaped Sherlock’s throat as he did so, his almost inevitable orgasm subsiding.
The sound of boots striking the floor hit Sherlock’s ears again as John slowly rounded him. He could feel John’s eyes grazing his form up and down.
John opened his eyes, blinking to adjust to the darkness. He cast his gaze over to where the door was, outlined in bright light coming in from the hallway. He chuckled sleepily. Sherlock would be in for a surprise tomorrow, then.
John glanced down at the small movement. “Eager, aren't you? And beautiful, too, there's no denying that.”
A short, muffled laugh rumbled in John's throat, and he finally stood in front of Sherlock. Sherlock kept his eyes firmly planted on the fridge, but his focus was solely on the small sliver of John he could catch in the lower field of his vision.
John took in a calculated breath. He and Sherlock had been overworked as of late, and John missed him. The past couple of weeks had been hard on them both, case after case piling in. The final one finally solved, though, meant that tomorrow would be the first day off for them in quite a while. John had hoped to start it off early tonight, but the stature of Sherlock now meant that he would be late to bed. John was almost used to it by now.
But then, the contact was gone, and John was gone. Sherlock bit off a frustrated whine trying to escape from his throat.
Sherlock rolled his eyes. John popped up, zipping up his fatigues, catching Sherlock’s outstretched hand to haul him to his feet as if he weighed nothing. His strength never failed to make Sherlock dizzy. John turned, tugging at Sherlock’s hand.
John stood before him, but this wasn’t the John Sherlock knew. This was the John Sherlock had only caught glimpses of, only seen when absolutely necessary. He was something out of Sherlock’s wildest, most secret dreams.
John appeared in the doorway, and Sherlock almost felt as if his mind was short circuiting. He blinked furiously, trying to clear the illusion from his mind’s eye. But it stayed the same when he opened his eyes fully again.
“You’re amazing, John,” Sherlock huffed out, still trying to catch his breath. He tilted his head to the left, catching John opening his eyes with some effort. A smile played on his exhausted face.
John sat in silence for a moment, contemplating. A sigh escaped his poor, mistreated lips. He started calculating times. Sherlock would probably be gone for two hours, if not a bit longer. It would give him enough time to shower, eat, and dress. More than enough time to come up with a game plan. Some more time to actually muster up the courage to do what he was about to do.
“Fuck, Holmes,” John spit out, his words quivering slightly. He panted, chest heaving. Then he bent over, getting as close to Sherlock’s left ear as he could while continuing to fuck Sherlock’s throat.
Sherlock scoffed. “John, you really are quite unobservant.” He gestured to his stomach and chest where evidence of his
John uncrossed his arms from behind his back, and his right hand wandered up to Sherlock’s face, fingers gently caressing Sherlock’s jaw line. Sherlock wanted to give in, wanted to press his face into John’s palm. He fought the urge, standing as still as a statue. Sherlock was taking cues from John now. He would not do a thing unless John told him to.
“Yes, Lestrade’s expecting me this morning,” Sherlock said, pulling his black trousers up over his legs. John forgot to reply as he watched Sherlock dress, watching the way the fabric of his clothing accentuated every angle as it was slid on. He didn’t know how Sherlock had stayed single for so long when he looked like
John's eyes locked onto Sherlock's. The chain and tags slid out of Sherlock’s mouth, the discs sliding down slowly over his outstretched tongue, catching them between his teeth in show. Sherlock grinned at John's guttural groan at the sight. His eyes grew hard again, resuming his onslaught on Sherlock.
He was coming, liquid forcing its way down Sherlock’s throat, John’s fingers twisting into Sherlock’s curls. His hips snapped up off of the chair, driving his cock as far as he could into Sherlock, apparently wanting the whole of his torso to follow through as well. Sherlock’s lips met the skin of his base, John’s cock bucking on his tongue, held there until he was certain he wouldn’t be able to breathe if John didn’t let go.
It was too much. Heat started to pool in his core, threatening to burst. He didn’t want to come, not yet. His body was shaking, sweat coating every inch of his skin, his breaths coming out in small hyperventilating gasps. John was lost, beginning to push his erection against Sherlock.
John leaned down, catching Sherlock’s mouth with his. It was a simple, loving kiss, and the two broke off after a few seconds.
John mouthed at Sherlock’s shoulder blade, a growl vibrating the skin. “You want my fingers in you, don’t you, soldier?” His thumb massaged along the ridges of Sherlock’s hole, and he pressed his eyes shut, wanting to scream.
Sherlock licked his lips, tasting salt. “I don’t think that’s possible, sir.” His voice was quiet, and he knew it would set John off. Good.
John stared at Sherlock, standing in the middle of the floor space, never taking his eyes off of him as he stepped over to the bed in three short strides, plunking down onto the side of the mattress.
Sherlock laughed out loud, smile infectious. “Now, when have I heard that before?” he asked playfully.
Sherlock tapped the back of John’s head twice with his fingers, an unspoken command. Their mouths separated as Sherlock let John’s head fall back onto his pillow.
Sherlock’s breath hitched as he came to his deduction. A million thoughts crash-coursed through his mind before John’s boot clad feet even came into view.
Sherlock’s grin was still plastered on his face as he swung back around to his microscope. “Of course not, doctor. Keep the bed warm for me.” He picked up a pen, scrawling something on the notepad to his right.
Sherlock smiled. It was everything, and nothing could have pleased him more. John, with or without fatigues. With or without his title as Captain, or Doctor. John would always be John to Sherlock. His John.
The footsteps started to descend the steps, and Sherlock analyzed them. Still unsure, still… nervous. But confident. Cocky. He was wearing heavier shoes, why heavier shoes? The way he was walking down the stairs indicated he was not going out, the gait was too careful, not casual at all, but yet he still wore heavy shoes.
“Captain,” his voice was too strained, too broken. “Captain Watson, please, I can’t-.” He swallowed hard, coating his dry throat.
“But you’re a bit mouthy, aren’t you?” he noted. “Seems like I need to be a bit rougher with you. Will that be a problem?” he asked.
“You’d think a strangler would be more conscious about washing his hands before strangling someone,” Sherlock sarcastically noted, then shook his head clear. “Lestrade told me no one was to contact me today, as if they’re doing me a favor. Now, John-”
“Hmm. Definitely noted,” Sherlock replied. “Though, I did tell you, did I not?” he playfully added after a few beats.
He began driving his cock into Sherlock in a frenzy, pulling Sherlock toward him with each stroke. John was gasping, pulling in air greedily. Sherlock’s eyes were beginning to roll into the back of his head, slowly losing control of himself, the only thing his mind could focus on was the feeling of John, John,
The click of the bottle came again, John slicking his cock. He lined himself up with Sherlock’s entrance, and slowly eased himself in. Sherlock groaned, his back arching as the head of John’s cock stretched him open. His legs instinctively wrapped around John’s waist, pulling him all the way in. It was glorious, the feeling of John filling him up, his hands gripping onto Sherlock’s hips with an iron grip.
A gasp escaped his mouth as John flattened his hands on Sherlock’s chest, warmth spreading from his palms. A grin split John’s face. His hands began to move, thumbs kneading his flesh, sliding down to his stomach, brushing at the trail of hair leading from his navel that disappeared into his trousers. The touch reached out to the vees of his hips, tracing the dips in his flesh. Sherlock tried to suppress a groan, his hips arching out slightly, his cock begging to be touched.
“I- I can’t, oh Christ-” John barely got the final word out. A strangled noise twisted from his mouth.
Sherlock didn’t need a day off, not really. His mind never tired, never faltered. It thrived off of work.
“I’m going to fuck you now,” John directed at Sherlock, hands peeling his now sweat-soaked grey shirt off. “I’m going to fuck you until you think you can’t handle it anymore. Is that clear?”
Sherlock hummed, pulling John in tighter. His hand ran through John’s short hair, and tingles spread through his skull. John snaked his arm around Sherlock’s waist, fingertips sliding under the hem of his shirt, playing at the delicate skin of his lower back.
“Hmm,” John hummed, eyes sliding down Sherlock’s front. Sherlock saw his eyebrows shoot up momentarily at the sight of what was probably the most obvious erection in human history. Sherlock felt a pang of embarrassment, showing John how much some simple commands from him could turn him on like the flick of a light. His right hand fidgeted nervously at his dressing gown.
Sherlock flew forward, his mouth hungrily devouring John’s cock, his hand grasping the base tightly. John cried out, possibly breaking character a bit, but Sherlock didn’t care. All he was focused on was John throbbing in his mouth as he bobbed up and down, precome pumping out onto his tongue every time it swirled around the head and over his slit. He hallowed his cheeks out, creating a vacuum, languid sucking noises sounding throughout the sitting room. God yes,
“Not at all, captain,” he replied, the small smile still threatening to blow up into a full-fledged grin.
“Morning,” John replied. His sight was bleary. “How long have you been up?” His mouth opened wide in a yawn, and he brought his free hand up to rub away the sleep in his eyes.
John looked down at him incredulously, pausing a beat before answering. “You’re more skilled than you look, soldier,” he slipped back into captain easily, but looked a beaten wreck. Sherlock almost laughed at the downplay of his skill; John had admitted many times that Sherlock’s blowjobs were only barely second to actually fucking him.
“I miss you,” John said quietly, leaning forward into Sherlock’s hair, breathing in deeply. The smell of luxurious shampoo mixed with the outdoor air permeated his nose. John pressed his lips to the top of Sherlock’s head, and he felt a hand slide onto his, thumb rubbing his skin.
John sunk a finger into Sherlock. Sherlock’s mind halted. The finger pushed all the way in, and an unfamiliar sound rang out in the room as it crooked inside of him. Was that him?
John’s hands worked quickly, buttons slipping out of their holes in quick succession all the way down Sherlock’s chest. Sherlock’s skin prickled with the sudden rush of cool air.
Sherlock opened the door with a flourish, slinging his jacket off of his body with one swift movement.
Of course, Sherlock had made it no secret that he was attracted to this side of John. But he never wanted to push him on it, thought it would have made John uncomfortable. Afraid it would have made John disgusted, even. Things like this were delicate- maybe past Sherlock would have had no problem crossing that line, but present Sherlock wanted to actually keep John, not lose him because of his borderline-inappropriate kink. He loved John too much.
“I know,” John said, pressing a kiss to Sherlock's neck. An odd pause filled the room. John breathed out a bit too forcefully.
“Before we begin,” John started, his fingers running through Sherlock’s curls, “Do you have a safeword, soldier?”
John smiled, his gaze slipping down to the floor. His feet shuffled forward, unwillingly, loathe to part with the man and his microscope. His hand wrapped around the doorknob to Sherlock’s room. Well, their room, now. John was still trying to get used to calling things theirs now. Their room. Their bed. Sherlock was
Sherlock rested his hands on John’s hips. “I’ll try not to be too late tonight, alright?” His reassuring tone flooded over John. He smiled. When Sherlock wanted to be charming, he could have John in his hands like putty.
John took hold of his cock with his right hand, taking Sherlock’s chin with his left. He guided his cock to line up with Sherlock’s mouth, smacking it down onto his tongue once, twice, three times. Precome flew off of the tip, spattering Sherlock’s taste buds with salt. John groaned, smearing the glans across his tongue repeatedly.
It seemed John loved Sherlock even more. He would have never thought in the whole of eternity that John would do this for him.
Sherlock opened his mouth to respond before a tangled moan forced its way out of his throat, the dog tags falling out to meet empty air. John had his hand firmly wrapped around Sherlock’s aching cock, pumping the forgotten thing up and down in his fist.
John cast his eyes downwards briefly before bringing them back up. He squeezed Sherlock’s hand. “I love you, Sherlock. More than
Sherlock gave John’s hips a tight squeeze. “I love you, John.” His voice was low, dark and passionate. The detective’s lips tugged up into a grin, and John melted. He couldn’t resist that smile.
“You don’t think I know, Holmes? You don’t think I see how bothered you get when I pull rank on poor, unsuspecting blokes? Do you think I’m stupid?” John growled. His left hand joined his right, forcefully undoing the top button of Sherlock’s shirt.
John eased down just as the lack of air was becoming uncomfortable. Sherlock let his cock slip out of his mouth, a small gasping noise coming from him as he sucked in air. John’s breathing above him was ragged, uneven. The two sat in silence for a bit, the only sound their gasping breaths, in and out, Sherlock’s hands resting on John’s thighs, John’s hands still curled around Sherlock’s skull. Sherlock cleared his throat.
John put a finger under Sherlock’s jaw, tilting his head up. Sherlock locked his eyes onto John, and John’s face contorted with pleasure. His cock was still covered with the fabric of his boxers, but he was palming at it with his right hand, eye contact never broken from Sherlock as he moaned quietly, his eyebrows furrowing.
John cursed again, a string of expletives as Sherlock rolled his nipple between his finger and thumb.
After what seemed like an eternity, John let out a quiet chuckle, his face pressed into Sherlock’s neck. Sherlock paused, and a laugh forced its way out. He dragged his hand up John’s sweat slicked back to his head, carding his fingers through his hair, not a memory of hair gel left. Shame.
John’s breath hitched then, and he sunk his cock into Sherlock as far as he could, fingernails indenting into Sherlock’s hips. His orgasm washed over him, Sherlock feeling him throb and pulse inside of him, filling him with warmth. A choked gasp fell out of John’s mouth as his hips came to a stop.
John set the mug to Sherlock’s right, who was currently staring into his microscope on the kitchen table. His long fingers were carefully manipulating a glass slide into place, before reaching out to grab the cup instinctively. John peered at him for a touch longer than necessary.
His body convulsed under John, his cock throbbing violently, pushing out streams of come onto his stomach, his chest, the bedsheets next to him. Sherlock wailed, a long uninterrupted moan as John attacked his throat, biting down and sucking on his skin, pain mixing with pleasure.
John let out a laugh. “They are clean. Besides, I think there’s worse things on this bed than my boots.”
John’s fingers explored, running the outline of Sherlock’s jaw, up and over his cheekbones, down to his lips, burning Sherlock’s skin every inch of the way. Sherlock’s lips parted slightly under the pressure, hot breaths rolling over the fingertips tracing the shape of his mouth. The touch glided over his chin, down his throat slowly, before resting on top of the fabric of his dress shirt. John paused.
Then Sherlock felt a hand grasp onto his curls, and he was being dragged across the room, pain prickling across his scalp. His back hit the bed forcefully, and his mind produced thousands of thoughts. The pain should shock him, should turn him off, should
He saw it in the looks Sherlock gave him, the slight upturn of his lips into devilish smirks, the way Sherlock momentarily broke character when John pulled rank on those around him on cases. He could see the way Sherlock brought his thick coat closer together in haste, but John could see the erection already forming against his leg. Of course no one else saw. Even Sherlock was trying to hide it from John. But John wasn’t daft.
With no hesitation this time, Sherlock took a step forward. He could feel his heart beating out of his chest.
And just like that, Sherlock whipped out of the bedroom, and John heard him flying down the staircase to the front door.
Sherlock moaned at this, his own cock thrusting forward and unexpectedly finding purchase with John’s armchair. He scooted closer, rutting into the fabric of the chair, the friction not enough, not enough, dammit. He groaned in frustration, the sound muffled as John continued to bury his cock into Sherlock.
Boots. John was wearing boots. But the only reason he would be up in his old room would be to put on boots he didn’t have in his normal wardrobe. Much heavier than standard men’s boots. His old combat boots.
Sherlock shrugged a black suit coat over his burgundy dress shirt, turning to look at John. He smiled at him, eyes combing his blanketed figure down then back up.
Sherlock peeked up, his dark curls partially blocking the view of John on the bed. The man looked ready to pounce as Sherlock slid his black dress trousers down.
“Strip for me,” John said, breaking the deathly silence in the room. “Not that I can’t tell you how I would take you just like this, with your shirt open and your fitted trousers shoved down to your thighs. But I want a show.” John paused again. “Slowly, if you please.”
In the months after Sherlocks shooting there was a part of John that had watched and hoped (largely fueled by that one longing look?) that perhaps, now that John had moved back to Baker Street, Sherlock might show that his feelings went beyond the friendship they had known before Sherlocks fall.
What about Irene Adler? He seemed pretty interested in her. And then there was that whole thing with Janine?
Sitting next to him was a man that John didn’t know; a very attractive man and more importantly the strange man was holding Sherlock’s hand.
And John could see it now. Sherlock Holmes was really very upset. He was also on the verge of tears and barely holding his own anger and hurt in check.
The simultaneous yes and no that he received was rather comical, but the obvious tension between the two brothers was far from amusing.
He’d been honest with Mary when He’d thrown the usb into the fire that day at Sherlock’s parents, but that was before Sherlock had shot Magnusson to protect Mary. Before he’d realized that the woman he’d married, didn’t have one ounce of gratitude in her for all the things Sherlock had done to preserve her marriage and quite possibly her freedom.
He’d been walking towards the bench that overlooked his favourite spot, when he’d heard a very familiar laugh.
He folded his arms and gave the other man his best I am a soldier and a doctor with infinite patience stare, and waited for Sherlock to answer.
Long minutes seemed to pass before John finally remembered that as wonderful as kissing Sherlock was; it would perhaps be even better if they talked about things before they got too carried away.
Sherlock had informed him that the mission that John had failed to ask about or even mention; the one that Mycroft had very handily got him out of, was apparently supposed to be one that Sherlock could not have possibly survived.
Long before then, John had realized he’d made a huge mistake taking Mary back. Most days the only thing that kept him there was his duty to Julia and guilt over what he’d done to his best friend because of that choice.  Any residual feelings he’d had for the woman he’d married, had died the day he’d come home from his meeting with Sherlock and realized exactly what she had cost him.
Making the impulsive decision to shelve any more questions for later along with his worry over the text he’d seen, he slid both hands to the back of Sherlocks’ neck.
Deliberately avoiding the other man’s intent gaze, John removed the nearly empty bottle from Julia’s slack mouth and placed it on the floor beside the couch. Levering her up onto his shoulder he rose from the couch. Still carefully avoiding Sherlock’s eye he patted Julia’s back gently to wind her and then turned to the bedroom to put her down.
It’s been not quite nine months since he made the decision to forgive Mary and take her back; nine long months of raging arguments and tension and the intermittent boredom of his ordinary life.
“I hope for your sake Doctor Watson that you never realize just what you’ve lost. My brother may be many things, but I do know him well enough to say this much.  Being loved by Sherlock was a gift and a privilege, one that you threw away because you were too unintelligent to know better. In this life we seldom find someone who has the capacity to love the way Sherlock does and I truly pity that you will never know what that might have been like. Enjoy your life John Watson... I pray it will be worth what you have lost this day.”
“I refuse to discuss this with you, now will you kindly get out of my way so I can go. “Sherlock snarled.
He had informed John that he was to under no circumstance to contact his brother and that as of ten minutes ago Sherlock’s number would be blocked so he needn’t bother even trying. He also advised him that the locks had been changed at Baker Street and Mrs Hudson had been alerted to the fact that if she allowed John entrance, then Sherlock would move out post haste.
But when it really came down to it the thing that John really couldn’t deal with; was the absolute cloying sense of sadness and disappointment that he experienced every time he thought of how easy it had been for Sherlock to just walk away from their life.
Sherlock trailed off and John found himself freezing at the suddenly resolute look on his best friends face.
Even worse than that he didn’t think he could live with the scorn he might see in the other’s eyes, now that John had finally realized his true feelings for the detective.
“And you think I’m forgetful you great duffer.  Well I suppose we make quite the pair really, what with me forgetting my phone and you the keys.” She frowned and looked thoughtful.
Had Sherlocks’ hunting down and the destruction of Moriarty’s web remade him into a different person? One that was far closer to the sociopath that he’d always claimed to be.
By the time the baby was born he’d known his marriage to Mary was more than just a mistake, it was a trap and one he couldn’t see a way out of.
To be truthful, it’s bothered John more than a little that ever since he’d become engaged to Mary, Sherlock had seemed to become distant in a way he’d never been when they had lived together.
He’s scoffed at himself when he said the words and there were actual tears in his eyes as he met John’s. But he acknowledged that he had finally realized just how wrong he’d been, when John had very obviously shied away from his attempt to tell John the truth about his feelings on the tarmac. That he’d seen the look of relief in John’s eyes, when Sherlock had changed his mind and turned his final admittance into a joke; rather than admit to the feelings that he now belatedly realized John didn’t want to acknowledge.  That it wasn’t that John didn’t realize that the tension between them had always been due to their deeper feelings, it was that John didn’t want them to exist at all.
All these months later, John still remembered how those words had cut. Something in the region of his chest had actually clenched as Mycroft left the cafe and it still ached all these months later.
When Sherlocks lips met his something inside John let out a victorious whoop, even as all thoughts beside the feel of Sherlock’s mouth on his fled.
His mouth turned down as he met Sherlock’s angry look, and he belatedly remembered the actual reason for his visit.
Looking back as he sat on the bus, he remembered how grateful he’d felt for her undemanding company; how lovely it had been to be with someone who didn’t pry or ask questions about the famous detective.
As devastating as all that had been, it had been Sherlock’s final parting shot that had put the last nail in the friendship.
Oh she’d said she’s sorry in the beginning, but it always seemed to come with a disclaimer; as though it was Sherlock’s fault that he got shot, or that it was John’s for choosing not to see who she really was. She had made it more than clear that even though John didn’t want to know about her past; it didn’t change the fact that she had one. Nor did it change the fact that she felt like she had no other option that night.
His heart pounded, and for the first time since he’d read the text on Mary’s phone, John was absolutely positive that Sherlock Holmes did not sleep with his wife.
“I love you John Watson and the thought of you not being in the world somewhere is simply unthinkable.” His mouth turned down in a grimace, his expression apologetic as he continued.
“Bloody Mycroft and his tedious theories.” He muttered. Sherlock turned back to face John, his mouth turning up in a derisive smirk.
“What I want to know is if the reason you refrained from contacting me was because my brother threatened your wife, or if in fact it was because of my unwanted affections for you?”
Sherlock then informed him that he might as well know, since he was too much of an emotional coward to ever see it himself, that not only had Sherlock jumped off a building to save John’s life, but he had also done everything in his power to give John what he thought he wanted by protecting the woman that had not only shot Sherlock, but had in fact been the actual sniper responsible for Sherlock’s jump in the first place.
John needed for them to be on the same page; he needed to understand what Sherlock wanted from him, to make him understand that the kiss they were now sharing was everything to John. That if they took this further and Sherlock changed his mind it would be the end for John. He had to know without any doubt where he stood with the man in his arms.
He’d known that whatever Sherlock had seen on his face that day on the tarmac it was not, no matter what Sherlock might have thought, because John had known of Sherlocks feelings and hadn’t wanted to acknowledge them. Yes he’d known Sherlock was most likely going to say something of importance that day and yes John had flinched from that, but in actual fact he’d just wanted to avoid breaking down in front of Mary and Mycroft.
Mycroft’s eyes flitted the length of John’s body, and a brief frown crossed his face. And though whatever he deduced from his inspection wasn’t readily apparent; at least not to John, he did rise from his perch on John’s chair to give a brief nod, before turning to face his brother.
He couldn’t stand to look at her and barely ever touched her. And even the fact that he knew she was most likely having an affair was more of a relief than anything else. At least if she was getting it from somebody not him, he was off the hook. The few times he had managed to fuck her; back when they were both still pretending that everything would be fine, it had made him physically sick afterwards and no amount of hot water could scrub the away the soiled feeling touching her left behind.
He’d understood on some level; that from the moment he stood up from the chair in Lannister Gardens that the rage he felt, far outweighed the upset and betrayal that he should have been feeling. It just hadn’t occurred to him to ask himself why at the time.
It wasn’t that surprising when he thought about it. Mary made a point of never taking her phone into the loo, not after an incident years ago that involved soap in the eyes and a full sink of water.
Something in Mary’s eyes flickered at the mention of Sherlock’s name, and just for a split second John found himself hard pressed to keep up his casual cheerfulness in the face of his wife’s perfidy.
Encouraged by the somewhat confused look on the detective’s face John took a deep breath and continued.
He got the part where Mary was a lying bitch who had married him as some sort of long term plot. And that the child he’d been so concerned that he’d be a bad father to, was in fact, not actually his. It was the part that seemed to imply that the baby was Sherlock’s that seemed to be his stumbling block.
Sherlock looked puzzled and a little worried but that light bulb expression that John had half expected to see was not there.
Trying not to grind his teeth in resentment, John did his best not to think about how angry she would have been if it was him that had forgotten his phone.
When John tried to argue the fact that it wasn’t Mycroft’s place to decide that for Sherlock, Mycroft had stilled and given John the first glimpse he’d truly seen of the real Mycroft Holmes and the true reason he practically ran the country.
“How could you do this to me Sherlock? I thought we were friends. Why would you keep something like this from me? Were you afraid to tell me or did you just get off on the thought of fooling me yet again?”
When Julia Watson woke up for her bottle four hours later it was to a very very tired and extremely happy John. Fortunately she was much too young to wonder why her daddy was being accompanied by a man wearing a sheet and little else.
That of course led to the realization that if what he’d felt for Mary was obviously not unconditional, then he’d clearly married her for all the wrong reasons.
So yeah, maybe he’d been too quick to dismiss who’d she’d been. Too quick to destroy the only real truth that she had ever offered willingly.
When Sherlock opened his mouth as though to speak; John shushed him before he could ask whatever question it was that he could see in Sherlocks eyes. He needed to get this out without interruptions or he was going to bottle out of the whole bloody thing.
John ran a hand through his hair and scrubbed wildly at his face in an effort to shake himself loose from his thoughts.
Instead of being devastated by her betrayal; John found himself aggravated that even with a bullet in him, Sherlock was acting like he and Mary were the best of friends. That everything that had just gone to shit in John’s life was merely an inconvenience. A misunderstanding; easily sorted with a chat and a nice warm cuppa. And it burned him to admit it, but part of that was his jealousy of the way that Sherlock had treated her right from the start.
Had the real reason she had shot Sherlock been because she was carrying his child; was she afraid he’d tell John?
But of course, as soon as he finds himself sitting down to gaze out the window on the homeward bound bus, his mind does exactly that.
All in all, he thought he’d done a pretty good job at appearing clueless. And considering that Mary must think that it was his default setting anyway, he thought he might be in the clear.
Julia was asleep in het cot and Mary had gone out for the evening. Most likely to see her latest boyfriend rather than the book club she used as an excuse. Not that John cared.
Sighing heavily, John picked up his book and attempted to distract himself from his circular thoughts.
And he certainly never would have married Mary if he’d known just what Sherlock felt for him. It might have taken him some time to forgive Sherlock, but he would have got there a bloody lot sooner than he did if he’d known the true reason why Sherlock jumped.
“I’ve spent the last eight months cursing myself for being such an emotional fool that day in the cafe. I let sentiment rule my better sense and my brothers’ words colour my decisions. But by the time I had cooled down and come to my senses I realized that I had most likely burnt my bridges, so to speak.  When you failed to contact me I was of course devastated, but after my behaviour I felt it was only just. I attacked your integrity and your friendship for me and I embarrassed both of us with my unwanted feelings... or so I believed at the time. I resolved to finally let you have peace in your life so I stayed away.”
He stood up from the couch. Suddenly deciding that he couldn’t deal with the agony of being close to Sherlock when he knew that Sherlock no longer cared in that way, he moved towards the kitchen.
For months he’d told himself that the grief he felt over the loss of Sherlock from his life was because he’d been stupidly blind to the other mans feelings and because of that he’d hurt someone he’d never wanted to hurt.
There had been a moment at his wedding just after Sherlock had played the violin piece he’d written, where for a brief instant he’d thought he’d seen something in Sherlocks expression. A sadness and longing, which had made John’s heart, leap in his chest. But when Sherlock had urged him and Mary to take to the dance floor only moments later, John told himself he was imagining things. And when Sherlock had grinned at his joke, John deliberately pushed the incident out of his mind, all the while berating himself for clearly drinking far too much champagne.
Opening the door with his key his only thought was of the drink he badly wants and the five minutes of downtime that he’s unlikely to get.
Sherlock Holmes loved John Watson and that when it came down to it; it was quite possibly the best piece of news he’d ever received.
John quickly lay Julia down on her blanket on the lounge room floor and hurried after his former friend.
“Look... I hurt you and I didn’t mean to, but there was no way you would have believed anything I said back then and by the time I’d thought it all through I realized that you and Mycroft were right about one thing... I didn’t deserve to have your love... let alone you friendship.” He looked back up into Sherlock’s startled features.
Ultimately what started out as gratitude had slowly blossomed into a warm and comfortable love. And John found himself thinking less about the grief of Sherlocks loss and more about the good times that he had spent with the other man.
He’d just been so absolutely speechless with anger; or that’s what he tried to tell himself as he stared down at the barely touched drink that he was still clutching.
“Regardless of what I may have indicated earlier to Mrs Hudson, I must at least thank you for driving Mycroft off, even if it’s only for an hour or two. He’s been absolutely obsessed with the idea that... well you know, you heard him. “
The nagging pain in John’s chest that he’d lived with all these months ceased as he immediately when numb with shock. Seconds later it returned with a vengeance, when the man holding Sherlocks hand pulled him into his arms and kissed him.
There was heavy regret in his heart as he met Sherlock’s worried gaze, but there was also a huge amount of joy and relief that came with those thoughts.
“Of course I’d known since the pool incident that you were important to me,” He swallowed nervously.  “But I managed to convince myself that it was your worth to me as part of the work that made me fear your loss.”
Finding out that Mary had been the one to shoot Sherlock, was the most bizarre experience of his life, for more than one reason.
“Thank you for organizing all of this. I couldn’t have done it without your cooperation and I know I’m the last person you would have wanted to help, so I really do appreciate everything you’ve done for me and Julia.”
“Dunno really.... I’d just reached a really low point in my life and I went on this really bad bender” he offered evasively.  “Then Harry tracked me down and sobered me up and told me I had to get out. She’s the one who told me I should just go ahead and have Mary arrested; That I wasn’t helping Julia or myself staying in such an emotionally abusive relationship.” He snorted.
Maybe all that stuff she told the papers about him was true. Maybe it wasn’t a coincidence that Mary shot him the same night John had told her that Janine and Sherlock were seeing each other?
Shaking his head to clear his troubled thoughts, John rubbed at his eyes and tried to focus on the world outside the windows of the bus and the distance he’d left to travel.
“Just so Doctor Watson, then I will leave you to try and talk some sense into my brother. He is treating this far too lightly in my opinion. Perhaps you will have better luck in persuading him than I. Good day John, Sherlock.”
John moved to the Kitchen and extracted a bottle from the fridge. He placed it in the warmer to heat and then headed for the bedroom.
It was in the ambulance on the way to the hospital that it had finally hit home that the man whose blood he was currently wearing; was undisputedly the most important person in his life. That in fact he’d made a dreadful and irredeemable mistake in marrying Mary, when it was obviously Sherlock who was the centre of John’s world and always would be.
Mary’s mobile phone was clutched in his hand, the knuckles of which were white from the force of pressure that he was holding on to it with.
“Doctor Watson, perhaps you would like to join us and give your opinion on the matter. I rather thought lurking was more Sherlock’s raison’de entre, but it appears that as with most things, he has managed to corrupt even you.”
“I love you Sherlock Holmes in every way there is, and if that makes me gay then I’m absolutely fine with it. Now I think you should take me to bed and let me show you every single fantasy I’ve ever had about that rather spectacular mouth of yours, yeah?”
Loving you may have been the single most painful experience of my life John Watson, but at least now I can be relatively sure that I can love... and regardless of what my brother believes, for that alone I must thank you. I wish you and Mary joy of each other. Goodbye.
But now as John studied the phone in his hand, it was the John Watson that was married to someone who’s initials AGRA were the only real truth he knew about the woman he’d wed. And that John (The one that Sherlock would have recognized) decided it was time he did a little snooping for his own piece of mind if nothing else.
He’d stood up from the table, straightened his coat adjusted his scarf and taken one last hard look at John’s furious face and thanked him.
Crossing the road to catch another back to his and Mary’s flat, John tries very hard to keep his thoughts from wandering to places he doesn’t want them to go.
He’d tried to be excited about becoming a father; something he’d never given much thought to before his wedding. But the shameful truth was that his daughter hadn’t even been born yet and he was already worried that she was the only thing that was keeping him in his marriage. Along with that came the fear that he would end up like his own father; resenting her because of that very same fact.
Mycroft had ripped the veils away from his eyes and suddenly John had seen every one of Sherlock’s actions in a whole new light.
When he’d asked Sherlock what was wrong, he’d gotten his third shock of the day, though it wasn’t to be his last.
Sherlock had looked at John in a way he’d never looked at him before and John had been shocked to recognize it as disgust.
Sherlock’s eyes widened and much to John’s complete consternation he was then treated to seeing Sherlock pale before blushing a shade of red that John hadn’t known he was capable of.
Well what had he expected really? Mycroft wasn’t likely to piss on him if he was on fire. The only reason he’d even helped with the whole Mary thing was because of her having shot Sherlock.
“Well in this particular instant I can honestly say you are most welcome. I will be sure to keep you updated on Mrs Watson’s progress, but I rather think you have seen the last of her. Now I think that concludes our business, so I’ll be off. I have a somewhat pressing situation in China that needs my attention.”
“Sherlock? He’s happy isn’t he? I know I’ve no right to ask, but I saw him in the park a couple of weeks ago and he seemed to be happy”.
He’d spent a very tense two days waiting to see if Mycroft would even agree to enacting Harrys’ plan. It wouldn’t have surprised him one bit if Mycroft had refused. It was after all only what he deserved.
“She was a bloody awful mother Sherlock. She never even held her right from the start and barely paid her any attention unless she was crying so much that it annoyed her. Don’t get me wrong, she would feed her and change her if she had to, but she really had no mothering instinct at all. She even admitted to me that the pregnancy was an accident and she’d only kept the kid because she thought it would keep me tied to her. I don’t know how many blokes she slept with before we got married, but she was pretty annoyed when she realized that Julia’s colouring was a dead giveaway that she couldn’t possibly be mine. Didn’t even need a DNA test, she admitted it straight up, but she said that she’d thought at the time that it was probably David’s, her ex from the wedding, so she’d thought she could pass her off as mine.”
Okay they were obviously not talking about Sherlock sleeping with John’s wife... so what the hell had Sherlock so upset?
Well according to her best friend Kerry Matheson all parents were weird like that. It was just part of being an icky adult or so her friend said. And well truthfully, she thought with a very Sherlock type shrug, she was pretty used to having the weirdest ones on the block anyway.
Sherlock would never be more than the brilliant best friend that John could get his adrenalin rush from; the man that would always have his back even if it meant destroying his life and health to do it, because to admit that Sherlock actually had real emotions would be unthinkable .
Moving as stealthily as he’d ever moved out on manoeuvres in his long gone army days, John moved to the edge of the clearing and carefully peered through the foliage that concealed him.
John leaned closer to the door; straining to hear more as Mycroft’s tone dropped back to normal levels, becoming more like the reasonable man that he worked so hard to project to the world.
Christ. How could he have been so fucking blindly stupid? How had he missed the fact that he was in love with Sherlock?
Tonight though... well tonight he was going to have a conversation with a certain consulting detective. And if he didn’t like the answers... well he’d just have to see, he supposed.
Sherlock had said right from the start that he was Married to his work and the relationships were not his area, so John had no one else but himself to blame if he’d gotten his hopes up.
“That day in the cafe you could have knocked me over with a feather. I had no idea you felt that way about me and the thing at the plane that you think you saw... well it was because I was doing my best not to break down in front of your brother and my bloody wife, not for the reason you thought.”
He was still trying to get his head around it all, when Mycroft Holmes slipped into the seat that his brother had so recently vacated.
John didn’t know what to say; he was still stuck on the fact that if it wasn’t for Mycroft, Sherlock would have flown off and John would have never seen him again.
If he caught a cab now, he might just be lucky enough to get to the clinic before she discovered he hadn’t arrived on time for his shift. And if he was extra lucky she might also assume that her phone had been lost in her morning travels.
“Sherlock... What did you mean when you said that I might find your feelings abhorrent? What feelings are we talking about?”
“Well considering that I arranged for it to happen in the first place it’d be a bit daft if I was upset now, wouldn’t it.
And knowing that Sherlock had found happiness with someone else, at the cost of his John’s wilful blindness, was the final push that he’d needed.
He smiled and tried to seem happy to see her, while at the same time attempting to gauge if she had any idea that he knew the truth about their marriage, and the baby she was carrying.
“There was also the fact that if I did not see... then I would also be less inclined to sabotage the relationship for my own selfish desire to have you return to Baker Street” he admitted somewhat sheepishly.
And yes; John has to admit that Sherlock has changed. He seems more thoughtful and quieter than the man who jumped from Bart’s. More prone to stop and think before speaking his mind. Well, at least when it came to the people closest to him.
Sherlocks’ eyes widened again at Johns’ words but the blaze of joy that lit his features was unmistakable.
He couldn’t believe he’d been so blind. If he had asked more questions when Sherlock had first come back everything might have been different. Instead he’d let his rage and jealousy dictate his actions and used it as a deliberate wedge between them.
When he did finally start to speak it was with a question rather than the explanation that John wanted.
John sighed wearily at the other mans snide tone and reminded himself that it was only due to Mycroft that he was finally free.
Three hours later John was jerked awake from a very uncomfortable doze in his armchair to someone pounding on his front door.
“Three weeks ago I was in Regents Park and I saw you...well I saw you kissing some bloke and I fucking near died. It took seeing you in some other tossers arms for me to actually finally get it... but boy did I get it. I’m in love with you Sherlock and it’s only fair that you know that you were perfectly right with what you said that day.  Well except for the part about me rejecting you because I knew how you felt” he added “that part was a load of old bollocks. I had no bloody idea about myself let alone you. I know that I fucked everything up and I can’t change what happened, but I just wanted you to know how I feel. I only stayed with Mary because I didn’t know what else to do... not with all her threats, but after seeing you that day I finally decided I’d had enough of punishing myself. I guess I figured having lost you completely was the final straw.” His mouth twisted derisively.
“So I stayed and tried to make the best of things for the baby’s sake, but it was never gonna work Sherlock because I couldn’t lie to myself and I’m an even worse liar when it comes to others... Mary specifically. It took her maybe a week to work out that I didn’t want to be there and maybe a month more before she started showing her true colours.” he offered wearily.
He parted his own lips and gently sucked at Sherlock’s lower one until the man in his arms got the message and opened his mouth again, tentatively meeting Johns questing tongue with his own.
It was Sherlocks’ continued intent to forgive and forget and his encouragement for John to do the same that had finally made John admit what he hadn’t wanted to.
He obviously wanted to kiss John, he just didn’t seem very confident in doing it. So John did the only thing he could, he took control.
Sherlock immediately stiffened in his arms and moved as if to pull away, but John was having none of that. There had been far too many stupid misunderstandings for one day; there was no way he was going to let Sherlock think that what they had just done was anything but right.
He understood the words he’d just read; it was the context that his brain seemed to be having the problem with.
Sherlock didn’t say a thing as John left the room and John found himself torn between the desire to have Sherlock stay and his fear that if he did stay it could only hurt worse in the long run.
“I also said sex did not alarm me John... I may have not been interested in Victor but I still do know how seduction works.  As a matter of fact I had known Victor since University and it made it quite easy to convince him I was interested in pursuing a more carnal relationship.”
“Yes John I mean it. Why else do you think I rushed over here when I heard about Mary?  Imagine my surprise when I got here and discovered it was you that had had her locked away.”
John’s mouth left his; the urge to explore the long expanse of neck that had tempted him for years; finally overcoming him. First he sucked a dark bruise onto the skin just below his jaw and then he slid his mouth slowly downwards until his nose was nestled in the hollow of Sherlock’s collarbone. Inhaling deeply, he licked and sucked his way across to the opposite side and then back up to take possession of the taller mans mouth once again.
He went on to say that it was now apparent that he had fallen prey to his own bout of sentiment in ever thinking that John had cared even half as much for Sherlock as he had for him. That it was obvious that John’s deeply repressed feelings of inadequacy and his latent bisexuality had been the only reason John had been so eager to follow along in his wake. That his supposed friendship was more about John’s need to feel like he still had some sort of purpose after being invalided home from Afghanistan, rather than any actual respect for Sherlock. And that Sherlock was disgusted with himself that he had been so ready to believe that John actually cared about Sherlock as a person.
John barely had a chance to absorb that distressing piece of information before   he’d then gone on to ask if John really was that stupid.  If it had even occurred to John that killing someone in plain view of half a dozen witnesses might incur more than a slap on the wrist; a slap in the form of a mission that any of the more qualified MI5 agents could have taken.  Of course he hadn’t been coming back; that was the whole point. He’d spat derisively.
According to Mycroft the man who had once described himself as a high functioning sociopath, had been tortured and beaten to within an inch of his life to protect the people he cared about and the one he cared the most for had, on his triumphant return home, attacked and punched him, even as he was still healing from that same ordeal.
Mindful of the role that he was playing, he waited for her to answer; doing his best to seem like the contented husband and expectant father.
“I remember a chair in a room,” John starts, but Sherlock’s face scrunches suddenly. “You know that part?”
He drops his head into his hands: clutched before his mouth in an unconsciously desperate imitation of a pose he’d seen so many times in his flatmate.
Then the noise again, unmistakably footsteps this time, crossing the hardwood floor of the room above him, followed by the sound of the sitting room door. John’s stomach dropped as he leapt to his feet, whirling to look back up the stairs.
The end of John’s order is lost in a strangled shout from behind the counter. John and the pink-haired girl who had been serving him turn together to watch as two men rush past the doorway behind her. One is hurrying backward as if defending himself from the figure pressing toward him: a tall man with a dark coat and a threatening look on his raw-boned face.
Just as Sherlock felt he probably should be asking her something about her life, perhaps about her previous role or where she had trained, or myriad other questions that less socially-inept individuals might offer without even a moment’s hesitation, Lestrade appeared.
“That’s better,” She said, coming over to him and lightly looping her arms around his neck, “I like it when you smile.”
“I just assumed.” She said with a shrug and a smile, “You said you were a friend of Mike’s and so is he…”
The man is turned away from him, staring down at the street below, dark hair above a long winter coat, flapping nauseatingly in the wind.
“I’ll leave you boys to talk,” She says, reaching her cheek up to Sherlock automatically as she passes him and smiling slightly as he kisses it with practised ease. Witnessing it John is reminded of the weeks she’s had to become adjusted to his presence again, the weeks he’s missed.
Remarkably he finds a seat in a relatively quiet part of the train, by the window, pleased when the space beside him remains empty despite the hordes of travellers boarding. As they stutter out of the station he even prepares to spread out and take full advantage of his apparent good luck at traveling without a stranger pressed close against his side. However it is at this moment that a dark figure swoops in and takes the empty place.
She let herself through the tired old gate and into the small garden opposite the hospital, holding it for him to pass through before turning and tracking over to sit on the single bench.
John struggles to remember quite how he got here. Something to do with a guy who had reminded John of someone he used to know, stopping to talk to him on the street as they both wound their rather convoluted ways home from a bar. Something about that guy’s rather flirtatious suggestion that home and comfort and sleep and water were for the weak. The strong came here instead. The strong shucked off their shirt and pushed themselves between the writhing figures on the floor to pulse and jump and shout and dance.
Sherlock’s gaze held on him for a moment, before he stepped out of the lift and headed unerringly to the one door standing open in the corridor. It was painted a deep red, the brass number 403 fixed proud and shining in the centre. Behind it the room was in perfect order.
He didn’t see a new calling card for some time. So long in fact that Lestrade had to scold him each time he searched the crime scenes too thoroughly. Disturbing evidence. Apparently.
The phone call, despite its terrible timing, had been just what John needed: the re-ignition of a friendship that had slipped between the many hours they’d both been putting in at the hospital. John seemed to be continuing the habit of making friends.
“You just said I was,” Slowly John can feel himself falling from that delicately balanced knife edge of shock, and into something like hysteria.
It strikes John then that he should probably have had some kind of powerful epiphany as he pulled himself from unconsciousness those few minutes before. Perhaps he should have been painfully unaware, ready to face another faceless day without Sherlock in it. Until realisation dawned and he remembered: remembered the figure in the doorway, John’s own name spoken in the voice of a memory, the shouts and the accusations. The smiles and the touches and the words. So many words. More than John feels he’s said in a lifetime.
“Would you have let me in?” Mycroft held his gaze and Sherlock was the first to look away, a gesture akin to surrendering the point.
“What the hell have you done to me Sherlock?” John asks, a slow smile on his face, he’s not quite sure what he’s referring to. The question can be applied in so many ways.
Minutes later and he’s sitting back in his chair, taking his first pull on his beer as he looks over the discarded papers.
“No, no really. I’m fine.” To prove it John reaches out for his pint, taking a drink “Trust me. I’m a doctor.” He can’t resist adding.
John looked around himself, at the street, the blue sky above, the unseasonably warm weather and 2010. Very clearly 2010.
“What do you think then Sherlock?” Mrs Hudson asked, calling back to him from the sitting room, “There’s another bedroom upstairs,” She said, and he gave her a look, “If you’ll be needing two bedrooms?” She continued.
“An unfortunate necessity,” Lestrade sighs, tone downtrodden for a moment, before they both turn back to face each other.
“Lestrade, what day is it today?” Sherlock asked suddenly, turning his intense stare away from the man.
“Well there’s no need to take that tone…” She started, not coming any further into the room. A pause, “Is this what you’re looking for?”
“You, Mary over there,” Sherlock replied, nodding in her direction, they were stood with their backs to the makeshift bar, surveying the room of partygoers. “And Griff, if he shows.”
“…she’s with a client at the moment,” The receptionist was telling Lestrade as Sherlock tuned back in.
Sherlock was checking the lock on the window above the sink. For the third time. He became aware of the vacuum her lack of chatter had created and turned to look at her. Her eyes were wide and worried but her stance was resolute. She said nothing, just watched him desperately.
It’s late in the day. John sits at a table alone, steaming cup of coffee set out before him while the muted sunshine of a London sunset falls through the blinds at the window at his side.
“Good.” Sherlock said when he’d finished, the closest he came to praise. “Meet me there in an hour.”
“And you were warm.” John affirms, fingers moving slightly, tracing patterns on that tiny patch of Sherlock he is currently clinging to. Remembering.
Even sorted into the correct order their form was random; some short, some long, some as detailed as police reports, others just unrefined thoughts:
Sherlock has been knocked off balance, sprawling on his backside on Mrs Hudson’s nice wood floor. His long fingers automatically reaching to the juncture of impact.
“You spoke to Mrs Hudson?” Sherlock seems to be existing outside the nonsense commentary John’s mouth is automatically releasing.
The female uniformed police officer with the delicate face and green eyes has the decency to look affronted.
“Yeah,” John replied. They were sitting together at a small weathered old table outside a pub, making the most of the dying rays of the summer sun before it became too cold or dark of an evening to brave the outdoors.
“All I deduced from that tea is that it would be an ineffective weapon,” He tosses over his shoulder.
“John?” Sherlock asks, John was right, he is close, Mycroft lingers near the doorway, a rare look of unfettered surprise on his face.
“What should I be expecting from this thing then?” John asked after a slightly awkward pause. Molly turned a questioning glance on him, “It’s my first. Are we talking drunkenness and debauchery? Or awkward conversations with consultants about the dangers of hospital acquired septicaemia?”
A wave of relief washed over John, so powerful he had to raise his hands to the back of his head, forcing the air out of his lungs as his heart pounded wildly in his chest.
John pushes it toward him without thought, realising as he does so that he’s somewhat shown his hand; now the stranger cannot fail to realise that he is watching.
“I’m sorry Sir,” She replied, “I can’t let you see him.” She continued, exactly as she had the first time. This time she followed it with: “Your name isn’t on the list.”
“What are you feeling now?” Sherlock asks, voice a low rumble. Close. John has to look back into his face and finds himself caught in that stare.
“How do you feel about the violin?” The deep voice of the man John is beginning to suspect he has been brought here to meet breaks back into John’s thoughts.
Lestrade opened his mouth to respond but was immediately distracted, as was Sherlock, by a skinny, middle-aged man in pink trousers walking very quickly towards them.
Sherlock continued: “And Stephanie Preston? And…” He wavered as he realised he’d failed to catalogue any of the other names; they’d been inconsequential details at the time. “…the Cylidate?”
John blinks at his own words spoken back to him in a velvet voice. The voice of his dreams. He stares for a moment.
“Alright,” As he speaks he pulls his scarf from his neck, pushes back at his coat so it falls across the arm of the sofa. He is staying.
A figure had emerged onto the landing. John craned his neck to see, but they’d already begun to descend the steps; out of sight.
“So, what I’m thinking is,” Lestrade kept on, “Why did she and the boyfriend fall out about a job she no longer had?”
“Don’t be ridiculous," It’s Sherlock speaking, his words sharp with the extra edge of petulance he uses only when he’s talking to his brother. “I’m telling you,”
“Yes,” Mrs Hudson says before John gets chance to open his mouth. “John and I have been having a nice chat.” A smile, she’s looking at John: “It’s so lovely to have him back, isn’t it Sherlock?”
It’s a quiet Tuesday night in Baker Street. Not that any night is loud any longer. He is still here. Just him. Only one seat sits in the centre of the room now, facing the shadow where a second used to be. He moved it some time ago. That chair. It sits in what he now strongly remembers to refer to as “the downstairs” bedroom. Ownerless. As if it’s always been.
