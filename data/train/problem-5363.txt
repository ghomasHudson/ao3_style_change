The soft glow lighted up their faces, and Dean noticed a broad smile on Cas. He observed the veil with love and care, gently holding it with his fingertips, while Dean couldn't look away from his peaceful expression. The last time he had seen something similar, the angel was taken away from him. Well, not an angel anymore. It took Dean everything not to cup Cas’s cheeks and tell everything that was building up inside him right here and there, but it could wait. Now they had time.
"Is it because you tried to read it too?"
“It worked!” Sam screamed, unable to hide his relief.
Dean pronounced the last words softer, searching for any sign of resentment, but as Cas's pupils doubled in size, and his lips parted slightly for an inhale, he continued.
One timid brush of the lips quickly gave way to a kiss full of emotions. Everything fell at once: the walls that they’d built over the years crumbled under the tenderness and desperation, and hopefulness, and hands moving to cradle the nape of Cas’s neck, and thumbs stroking the soft skin behind his ears, and the clutching to the worn-out coat with dirty spots on the back, and pressing closer together, body to body, heat to heat. And it was too many teeth and too little air, and it was too much and not nearly enough. It was perfect.
Cas frowns. He’s refused to take it off ever since Dean gave it to him.
“What are we? Rich?” Dean scoffs. Sam chuckles in agreement.
"You don't—"
In Cas’ defense, he’s getting pretty good at making Dean come twice a night. It’s almost a standard thing.
“Why?”
This chapter finishes the doozy of info-dumping we saw in TEA. I purposefully didn't rehash it word for word, but the important parts still come through. If you didn't read TEA and want to know more about what Sam is saying, and his conversations with his hallucifer, go read chapter 5 of TEA
We are entering countdown to catching up with Sam's story! I've reconstructed the ending not one, not two, but about FIVE times, and it's come out that we're gonna have more than 30 chapters. So have no fear, it won't be a rush ending. I'll be able to update our total chapter count once I'm done rewriting and reconfiguring everything! (as of now I'm guessing around 34 chapters total)
Their audience is only growing. Bobby’s got solid wards set up, but those will only last so long. Dean doesn’t think they’re set up for a siege. Crowley and Abaddon will slip out of an exorcism, he’s sure, and they can’t use the angel banishing sigil without affecting Cas.
Andrea keeps the car between her and them, which Dean can’t necessarily blame her— a vampire with two hunters should be nervous. But he feels mildly insulted that after everything they just went through— are they like vampire married through Benny or something? That she thinks he’d kill her for kicks.
Dean laughs, “You think I’d be out here with you assholes if I had the chance to shoot God?”
The thought of letting Cas out of his sight, out of the house, out of Dean’s reach, terrifies him. Cas could get into all sorts of trouble. He could get hurt, he could be attacked, he could talk himself into something stupid and Dean won’t be there to try and pull him back from the edge.
She completely ignores him, staring past Dean into the house, “What are you hiding in there? I want to know.”
It’s only later that Dean realizes Andrea never returned his shirt. Why the hell would she keep it when she spent so long complaining about how it smelled like him? With how sensitive vamps are to scent, Dean thought she’d have gotten rid of it as soon as she could, rather than smell like him a second longer than she needed to.
— fists still stings in his skin.
“We’ve got you, Dean. We take care of our own,” Benny says. Dean nods weakly, and matches Benny’s breathing.
Dean’s not going to get carried through purgatory like some damsel. He forces himself to pull away from Cas.
Dean looks down at himself. He’s fucking
“Of course I don’t like it,” Cas says, “but it might be for the best. The things God has done, has allowed… the world, and everyone in it, deserves better. I think Sam is right to champion that.”
Bobby’s been like a father since before Dean realized that was the space he was filling. Sam is Dean’s annoying kid brother. And while they haven’t known them their whole life, Ellen and Jo? They’re family. The
“You just told me you had an insane number of orgasms. I think I’m allowed to get a few answers,” Sam says.
“It’s fine,” Dean says.
The water is finally cold enough, so Dean fills his glass and chugs. Refills, chugs. And third time’s the charm. He immediately throws it all back up. Spits, rinses his mouth. And now he’s in a worse mood than before. He rinses his mouth, spits into the sink.
“I’ve been reading,” Bobby says, takes a slow breath, “ever since we did the detox fuckup on Sam. And thank god I did— because if you keep pushing him Dean, he’s going to break.”
“Then you need to learn how.”
. And it wasn’t even the full thing!
“Excited,” Dean corrects him, undoes the button on Cas’ other wrist, “but, uh, yeah. A little nervous. Never done this before.”
Dean weighs the pros and cons of having to let go of Cas, to give Cas the chance to run while he changes the wards himself.
Sam rolls his eyes, and pushes himself to his feet. Good, okay, he’s gonna get in Dean’s face about this. Dean can handle that.
“Is there gonna be repercussions for what Sam did?” Bobby asks.
For all that Dean thought angel blood would be miraculous, or fill him up and make him fighting fit again in an instant, it doesn’t. He goes to sleep hungry most nights, but all of the aches and pains he developed from purgatory life and lack of proper food are gone by the time he wakes up. While he’s lost a decent amount of weight again, he notices that he’s stopped wasting, and is holding on to the muscle he’s building up.
“I remember,” Benny says, “don’t worry, let me take care of ya.”
When Dean doesn’t respond, because he’s limp in Cas’ grip, because he wants him to just fucking finish it,
him, warts and all, and Dean’s never had someone who wanted him, just for being
“Thanks for the help,” Sam says.
“Dean,” Cas says softly, “if… if it is this difficult… physical intimacy isn’t something I need. Especially if it causes you this level of anxiety.”
Not for the first time, Dean feels sickening relief that Dad died.
helped Bobby do the grossest autopsy ever. It’s the first decent sleep Dean’s gotten in what feels like months.
Benny rumbles a growl, “Word has it the angel is pissing off leviathans. We are
“Yes,” Cas says, “if I enter the Kingdom they will either kill me, or enslave me.”
“No,” Dean corrects.
Dean can’t make out Sam’s conversation, but he’s pretty sure it’s a conversation. One sided. Sam was never one to really sleep-talk, but he picked up a lot of weird habits and tics while his brain was taking the great fall. In the year that Dean was gone, Sam seems to have mostly put himself back together, but even humpty dumpty still had his cracks.
“Frank’s got a lead on those numbers,” Dean says, “he thinks they’re coordinates.”
This is a fucking trap. But whatever it is has Sam.
“So Sam is off his rocker again,” Dean announces, “we need to go hard on getting him back on track.”
Dean’s definitely seen Cas at his worst now. They’re still in it. And Dean… Dean wants to take out the leviathans. Wants a beer on Bobby’s back porch. He’d like it if Cas could join him.
“Yes,” he finally admits, “though… the intensity of the moment has passed. I feel less likely to act on it.”
Sam’s face lights up, and he stands up straighter, “I— yeah. Of course. I want to help.”
, Cas said, years ago on these same steps.
, Dean reminds himself. Which forces him to face the terrifying question of
why Sam wanted this to be a brothers-only trip.
“So whatever Sam did, he did it to save you. Not hurt you. We’re gonna figure out what it all means later,” Dean promises, “we gotta deal with— with this shit, right now. But whatever you are, you’re still Cas.”
Sam looks desperate, “It
A timid knock at his door.
"Thank you," Cas says, and his voice sounds small as he adds, "I'm glad to not be alone."
the sudden drop in temperature like he just jumped into cold water. There’s a jarring sensation as he feels the pressure of angel magic holding him suddenly lift off. Dean hits the floor. Everything goes white for a hot second.
?” he snarls. It hurts! Everything hurts! He’s so fucking tired. Fuck going downstairs to see Sam. If he’s dead he’s dead, nothing to be done. Dean wants a nap!
“You gonna be okay?” Dean asks.
“I told you I want to
and his eyes are puffy like he’s been crying, and like he might start crying again. And then Sam inhales. It’s shaky, shallow, but he holds it a second and then exhales. Dean breathes with him on the next round. They breathe together until Sam stops shaking.
“Dean?” Sam calls, and the doorknob rattles.
“Shh,” Benny reminds him, and doesn’t move.
Dean tries to swallow, gags. Benny rolls his eyes at him.
“You’re human,” Benny drawls, “you
“What are you getting at?” Dean asks.
“You have no power here, Dean Winchester,” the woman hisses, “Castiel is under
“Insects, well, social invertebrates, are much closer to angelic than any other creature on this plane,” Cas admits, and Dean sees him pause where he wonders if he’s said something insulting, “they are still very, very different. But they would be the closest.”
“It won’t be a problem,” Cas assures him, because Cas can manipulate his body to be hard for as long as he wants, and not come until he wants to, and then Cas says, “how long do you want me to fuck you for?”
“I did…” Cas hesitates, looks away. Dean hates how Cas can’t look him in the eye anymore, ever since he came back from the dead, “I thought— I didn’t realize you were still here.”
“They’ll won’t hurt you,” Cas says, “they’ll do worse.”
like that— and Dean comes to really like the way Cas does some things. Like how Cas holds his head with both hands to kiss him, like Cas won’t let Dean go until he’s kissed him senseless, how he holds Dean like Dean’s something precious.
“Your dad ever laid a hand on you, for anything, and I’ll drag him outta heaven to put him down behind my shed,” Bobby snaps, angry enough that Dean doesn’t doubt that he’s being honest.
“Of course,” Dean says. This is his family. Cas included. Dean will do anything for them.
“I didn’t have anyone else to call, I swear,” he says, “it’s not like I
“It’s a bad idea,” Benny explains, “if you want to get back we can’t detour—”
But it’s nice to have someone else around that isn’t Dean’s little brother.
They get Sam back onto the cot. He sways like he’s gonna pass out at any second, and he’s got his teeth barred like an animal. He’s started bleeding from his nose and eyes again.
“No, that— that’s insane,” and Dean’s grouchiness from being woken up, no matter how pleasantly, fades away entirely, “I— I seriously came
, that reminds Dean to close his eyes before they get burned out of his skull. Cas got knocked out of his vessel! He’s in his natural state.
Cas has nowhere to go, trapped in the wheelchair. But to his credit he doesn’t flinch as Death waves a bony hand over him.
“Then do it or shut up,” Sam snarls to no one.
,” Dean’s back arches as he moans. Cas keeps his hands tight on Dean’s hips, pinning him so Cas can swallow everything.
"Oh, oh shit," Dean realizes, "shit, sorry. I forgot."
“Like what?”
“And that… that was it? With a demon?”
“Goodnight,” Cas says. Dean makes a soft noise in response.
. He’s too groggy to know what it was just yet.
that you’re the prime steak in this whole world. And you go about fucking bleeding in front of a vampire.”
Even as keyed up as he is, with the glowing eyes, Cas looks offended.
Dean mumbles a quick, “Yes sir,” and goes back to stress-eating.
The longer Dean can avoid hiding in this cave the better. It’s stupid small, and he won’t be able to stand upright. Benny’s going to lay down a log across the entrance so it’ll be basically invisible. In theory, Dean should be totally safe. They even restocked on some ‘snacks’ for Dean to munch on. He hates it. He hates this whole plan but hasn’t been able to argue his way out of it.
“I’m not really into guys,” Sam says, “like, I’m straight but I guess if the right guy came along I’d try?”
“Need a hand?” Dean asks.
Armor? What— and Dean glances between Sam and Cas before he realizes this is a psychic thing.
Dad’s dead and gone. Dean thinks of the unmarked grave on Bobby’s lot. Of Dad’s ashes left to scatter in the wind. Dean doesn’t want to follow him down that road.
leviathans sneak up on Dean with no warning.
“I don’t know what to do,” Dean admits, “I— I don’t know how to fix stuff for you. I don’t know what the answer is.”
Home is when Mom was alive. That short window of Dean’s life that gets harder and harder to remember as Dean gets older, to the point that he’s not sure what’s real memory and what’s fabricated from stories Dad told him, or that he assumed from the photos he found in Dads journal.
how amazing Cas is, from the beginning.
Cas has to get off of him to get his pants off, and Dean takes some deep breaths to compose himself and get his brain back in gear, because this is happening. Holy shit it’s happening.
Cas doesn’t emote it, because of course emotions are hard, and it’s wild to see that he’s still wearing the same vessel, but it's so familiar that Dean lights up at the sight of him.
Dean cuts him off, “what I’m trying to say, is: we’ve all fucked up, okay? Done a lot of shit we aren’t proud of. But we’re still here. And Sam and me? We get up and we decide to keep saving people. That’s what we want to do. I don’t— I don’t know what you want, Cas. But we can find what it takes for you to get up in the morning and keep going.”
Do you ever think about Dean in that gap year between s5 and 6, where he thought his brother was in hell for eternity and he was desperately trying to carry out Sam's last wishes by 'being normal' having a few moments of dancing in the kitchen and laughing so hard he was actually happy for a second? And then remembering his brother and feeling so guilty that he'd break down on the spot??
This is the majority of what Dean and Benny got up to in Purgatory, and as far as Dean’s concerned, it’s almost sex. Mostly. Close enough. Right now.
“Oh,” Benny realizes, and shakes his head, “I don’t give out pity parties. You want it Dean, you gotta say it.”
“I don’t want to do this,” Dean says, “if that’s any—”
“They’re better than your PBR,” Sam says.
(See the end of the chapter for
Cas scowls, “I wanted to have sex with you to make you orgasm. I don’t require small pleasures in comparison to how your soul responds.”
Next chapter takes us to the events of ch7 of TEA. You will want to make some time on Wednesday to read the update, I promise ;)
“I— I was all up in both of you,” Sam grimaces, “I know too much.”
Dean almost says ‘yes sir’. His whole face heats up as he catches himself.
“But I didn’t,” Sam reminds him, “and if I did it safer, next time. If we plan for it better, then maybe— maybe I can save the ones who really need saving.”
“I’m speaking with Sam,” Death corrects him, “eat your food before it gets cold.”
“Yeah,” Dean agrees, “I need a little bit before it’ll be good for me again.” He wonders if he should have gotten his pants off too, but Dean hates being naked when he doesn’t have to be.
Cas gives him space. Dean breathes heavily, laughs. Cas settles down so his feet are on the floor again.
Turns out it’s easy to fall back into things with Cas. And it turns out that, after all this time, after everything they’ve been through, there’s still so much that’s the same for them.
Cas clears his throat, and looks to Bobby, “Yes. There’s never been a celestial with a soul before. This is… this is all unprecedented.  But it may work in our favor. With all of the injuries done to Sam’s body, if there is an angel in him it may take some time for him to heal.”
“You smell a little too good,” Benny clarifies, and drops the body to the floor, “we gotta fix that.”
“Sam!” Bobby shouts. No response.
Dean needed a big cry <3
(See the end of the chapter for
Benny drops his secondary fangs, as if Dean had forgotten that Benny is a fucking vampire who would love to drink him dry.
“This couch sucks,” Sam says, “let’s take Cas upstairs to rest.”
“That is…” he starts, and squints as he thinks.
“Equal chances,” Dean challenges, and between the two of them he knows he’s the better killer, that he’ll finish the job before Sam can, “may the best man win.”
is up with your taste buds?” Sam asks.
“Hey,” Dean scolds. Maybe that one was a little too harsh. Cas is the ace up their sleeve. The only reason he doesn’t smite anything is because the leviathans would be able to sense it. He's basically fighting with a huge handicap.
. Of squatting in abandoned houses, tying Sam down to sleep, so he wouldn’t try and kill himself for the hour or two Dean needed to sleep. Of counting down the days to when he could secure Sam’s spot in heaven, of looking forwards to the
was not a first kiss,” Dean tries.
He doesn’t burn up, like Cas said a monster like Benny would. That’s gotta count for something, for Dean, right?
Cas muses on it like it’s the most important question he’s ever been asked.
— and he spears her through the heart.
“Shut up,” Dean snaps, “I’m not losing him!”
Sam spits one last time, presses his head to the cold porcelain of the tub while he breathes deeply. Dean perches over him, unsure in which direction to spring.
“I chose you over the orders of heaven, something that no angel has done since the fall of the Morningstar,” Cas says, “I chose a
Benny... my beloved...
“No, you don’t,” Dean snaps back into action, “knock it off.” He checks quickly over his shoulder. Bobby isn’t in earshot, can’t have heard that.
Sam glares at him, like he wants to argue that he’s fine, but he’s obviously
“What’s going on?” Bobby asks.
He dreams about watching Cas walk into the water. And then Dean follows him in.
“Was that Castiel’s power?” Naomi asks.
They’re going to have to go into lockdown on Sam again— he’s slipping too far from reality. Back to specifically eating healthy brain foods or whatever Bobby found, and Dean will have to start sharing a bed on the regular with him again. Maybe Bobby has more of that research he did on supporting people with ptsd or anything Bobby looked into that might help them account for Sam’s centuries of being tortured by Satan himself.
“I’d get up and hug you but my ass is out,” Dean jokes.
“Can they track it to Sam?” Dean asks.
“Are you serious?” Dean snaps, and Death turns his whole head to glare at him.
Dean looks down at Cas, at Cas’ blue eyes, his half-open mouth, laying out on Dean’s bed and his heart skips a beat. He loves Cas, and Cas knows. Cas loves him. Cas is here, wants to be here, with Dean. It seems too far-fetched to be true, after all the false starts they’ve had over the years.
Dean breathes out heavily, “Cas, man, this is—”
“Yeah, well, he likes you more than me.”
Sam turns his head, but his eyes don’t track to where Dean is standing. Dean hates this. Cas says he’ll recover in a few days, like when he went blind before.
He tries to pull away, but Cas’s arms are an iron grip around him and he’s forced to stay. Head tucked under Cas’ chin, chest-to-chest. One hand to the back of his head, the other around his back. It’s… it’s not unlike the time Dean made Cas spend the night with him, when he didn’t want Cas to be alone. When that was all he had to comfort Cas. Dean strains against Cas’ unbreakable grip until it becomes clear that Cas won’t relent to him on this. He admits defeat and lets himself be held.
“Abaddon,” Crowley greets with a sneer. Or maybe that’s just how it looks when his face has no lips.
Dean puts some distance between him and Cas. As much as he can, anyways. Clearly Cas needs some space to get his head on straight. He gave Dean space after Dean kissed him, Dean can return the favor.
Cas who is his best friend, who might still be in love with him, who saw how rotten and monstrous Dean is and what hell turned him into, and who then chose to rebel against everything he knew to help save the world. Who died, and came back, twice now. Cas is meant to be in Dean’s life. They’re meant to be together, which is why Dean has to find Cas, find
"We had an appointment," Cas says, playing dumb. And since seeing him laughing and sarcastic and emotive in the future, Dean recognizes all of those things in Cas now. He knew Cas was smart, but hell, since when was Cas
Bobby doesn’t seem to notice anything different about him. Dean’s not sure what to make of that.
Does Sam want to prove he’s right, that his hallucinations are true, and that Sam knows things about heaven that Cas doesn’t? Or does Sam want to prove he’s losing his mind again?
He sees Castiel poised right at this cliff edge, the same one Dean’s been standing on for so long now. Sees him for the first time not as some Other, some terrifying, unknowable force to be rallied against, but sees him as a son, grappling with a powerful father who he loves, and wants to please, but can’t live up to what his father wants.
“Okay,” Dean agrees, because he’s not Sam’s keeper, not anymore. They’re equals and it’s Sam’s powers, and Dean’s going to have his back no matter the choice.
Dean nods along, thinking as well. He thinks he can remember a few of the women along the way.
“I don’t think they’re coming,” Sam announces.
Warnings for this chapter: canon-typical violence! The kind that happens when squishy human bodies get bulldozed by wavelengths of celestial intent using other human bodies like battering rams.
of two feet. This is… there’s more feet. A mob?
Dean shakes his head, “No, and Bobby’s people haven’t found anything more either.”
that Dean’s throat tightens up. Sam’s going to be okay.
“Don’t you fucking say that!”
“But Lucifer’s song is distorted,” Sam realizes, “because of hell.”
Cas’ palms hit the table. His eyes go wide. He looks at Sam, betrayed.
freaking man in— jesus christ,
“You’re up?” Bobby asks, “how’s—”
“If— what if I— what if I didn’t want, you know, more?” Dean asks, “you said— you said you were okay with that. What do you even want, then?” What does Cas even get out of loving Dean? All Dean does is bring in more trouble and problems.
“Am not,” Sam scoffs.
“What the hell do you think you’re doing?” Bobby snaps.
“I’m quite old,” Death reminds them, and Dean recalls Death’s boast to Cas back when Cas was off his rocker with leviathans, that Death would one day reap God himself, “I’ve been around for a very long time. So I’ve come to learn the signs,” and he pauses again to finish his chocolate bar.
Welcome home Dean!!! And Benny, you will be missed!!! (spoilers: he will be back)
Dean nods. He’s so scared to talk. What if he just starts crying? Or screaming?
“Piss off,” Dean snaps.
“Lots of problems here,” Death agrees with a quick glance around the room. He frowns down at Cas, “you have a seraph without a leash. Do you understand how dangerous that is?”
He feels Cas hug him back. Dean wants to stay here, right here, in this safe space with his face turned into Cas’ throat, with his senses all full of Cas and his angel smells and his warm arms and where he doesn’t have to think about being digested or stored away or whatever the hell the leviathans were doing with him.
“He’s smart,” Dean protests, feeling suddenly like he has to protect Sam’s virtue. Sam’s practically a genius. If anyone could figure out some weird mumbo-jumbo psychic shit, it would be Sam.
He acted unimpressed, but his shy smile said it all: Cas couldn’t withhold his delight.
"Alright. And Eileen.” Dean caught her eye and pointed the finger at Sam. “Don't let him do something stupid."
“You know me?”
Cas dismissively threw the grace extractor in his pocket and let the veil hang from the chain. It kept shining as he elevated it to face level and examined the object from different angles. Dean touched the glass lightly; the hair on his hand rose from the electrical sensation that ran down his arm. His eyes were drawn to the glowing force contained in the small place. It wasn’t the first time he saw grace, yet for once, it wasn’t just someone’s grace. It was a part of Cas.
He could’ve sworn that Cas’s already big eyes became twice as large. His voice sounded more hoarse than usual when he added:
As he moved to the shelves, Sam and Eileen stepped inside and wandered off. The books were written in a variety of ancient and modern languages and were scattered in no particular order everywhere. Their condition differed from proper to atrocious, the pages being held together by the sheer power of centuries-old dust. Once approached the second next table from the door, Sam picked up the most durable volume from the pile and opened it.
Sam shoves Dean into the passenger seat. Dean’s experiencing the world in such vivid clarity, but his body isn’t up to speed. He can see faces at the door to the gas station mart, sees people staring at him. If people keep clustering like that they’re going to summon the leviathans. They can sense the vibrations of large groups, they can
Dean’s brain clicks into overdrive— that word, the woman, she said something. Cas is under a spell, but what kind of spell can control an angel? How can he undo it?
“It’s not,” Andrea says. She crosses her arms across her chest. Blinks tears out of her eyes.
Dean forces himself to breathe through his nose. His heart’s hammering in his chest. He’s never asked anyone to share in this responsibility before. Never trusted anyone else with the most important person in his life.
“God established laws for his toys. You’re breaking those. You’re changing his playthings, and it might be enough to get his attention.”
him. How much more obvious could Dean get?
“You, uh, you aren’t surprised?” Dean asks.
“If it was enough for him to feel it, I’m sure other angels could. And considering how pissed he just got, I bet the other angels are even angrier about it. And you know how shitty heaven gets when they’re mad about something.”
“Take care of Sam,” Dean reminds his reflection, and he looks down at his hands. He didn’t hit Sam hard enough to bruise, but he feels the hits all the same, “good fucking job, moron.”
Did it work? Dean wants to believe it did.
“My hero,” Dean jokes.
Cas brings Bobby back. Says he has more work to do in heaven. And he’s gone.
NEW CONTENT HERE WE GOOOOO
“He’s sinking. Call to him—”
Sam’s impressed by how far they got on the puzzle, and even manages to secure a few more pieces while Dean and Bobby finish cooking. Cas is in the wheelchair while the rest of them crowd around the table. Cas grabs for his hand, and Dean doesn’t pull them down out of sight. He leaves their hands up on the table where everyone can see.
Their
'dem has dean told cas about benny and the mate bond?' no. 'but DEM why are you setting up a cheating sub plot??' i'm not!!!!! i promise. the bennydeancas thing does not get solved this story, and it's not an infidelity plot i promise <3 everyone gets a happy ending!!!!!
Dean rears his head back, cracks the angel behind him in the nose and he sees stars— it’s like head butting a wall— but the angel falters for a second and Dean’s jumping forwards to get to Sam. Someone grabs the back of his jacket, he feels angel magic— all invisible and impossible to fight against, grab him— and he feels
Dean takes point as they head out. He’ll kill anything that gets in his way. It’s his turn to protect Cas, to prove that he’s not a deadweight.
Cas pauses, "Oh. I misunderstood. I thought the help was real, not sexual—"
“Don’t go far,” Dean orders. Cas walking away is almost enough to put him out of the mood. Almost. But Cas promised not to run off, and Dean trusts him.
Oh yeah. Dean should probably do something.
“What’s the last order you were given, before you rebelled?” Sam asks Cas.
Cas’ head tilts a few degrees to the right. He narrows his eyes.
. Sam knows Dean’s soft, Sam knows Dean’s fooling around with Cas, Sam
“I don’t think you could,” Benny remarks, and before Dean can argue he adds, “you’re wasting away, Dean. Even if we start walking now, I don’t know if you’ll make it to the exit.”
Dean’s confused silence prompts Cas to add, “your strength, your boldest attribute, is that you submit to nothing. Especially not me.”
Sam takes initiative and heads for the den. Dean follows in a daze. They put on something. There’s teams, a ball, a field. Dean barely sees it.
example of how to care about people.”
Dean lasts no time at all before the bed is too soft, too open. He’s exposed, he’s stuck and sinking in how soft it is. Something is going to come in, he knows it, something huge and awful like a leviathan, all fangs and acid and fear and they’re going to swallow him alive. He’s small and soft and can’t do anything to stop it.
, the leviathan calls, saying the words like they’re names, or titles,
“If you hit Vegas and get married without me, I’m gonna kill you,” Sam shouts.
Smears his awful human blood across Cas’ mouth, really lays it on him, so that Cas will be so disgusted he’ll have no choice but to kill Dean. Tries to sell it, like he’s been queer this whole time, like he wants Cas to fuck him. He shoves his tongue into Cas’ mouth.
Cas places a hand on Sam’s chest, and there’s the tell-tale glow of grace under his skin. It illuminates the tendons and bones in his hands.
“I’m sorry,” Dean says.
“You need all the rest you can get,” Benny reasons, “and if you’re that upset about it, you can blow me when you wake up.”
“How’s Cas looking?” Dean asks.
I've been thinking about doing something a little weird, due to the massive size of this project, that when
“I’m sorry,” he says.
Dean doesn’t have anything to argue against that. What do you say to that?
he wanted this.
There's a wrenching motion, a ripping sound, and something thick and slimy flails as it’s pulled out of Dean’s throat. He gasps in fresh air, sobs, because oh fuck it was
If you have any questions for the wrap-up, you still have time to ask! I'll figure out exactly how I'm gonna be posting/answering them in time for our final chapter so I'll let y'all know what tag to look for on my blog if you're curious about foreshadowing or story structure.
“It’s okay,” Dean assures him, “it’s been a rough time.”
“Is that because you don’t… have memories of it?” Dean says carefully, “or because you don’t want to do it? I don’t want to force you into anything you don’t want.”
Dean looks up, and realizes what’s blocking the light.
“Uh, demons?” Sam repeats.
“Remember what I said before— half the fun is in getting there,” Dean says.
“Well we reek of sex, and, I’d rather not feel all soul-drained by myself,” Dean figures, “so, care to join me?”
But for the first time, he can’t… he’s not sure
"Don't ever change," Dean says. He hopes Cas hears all the things Dean can't say.
"I don't know how to love right," Dean admits. He’s thinking about pages that can never be un-bent. He’s thinking about red, hot knuckles from hitting. He’s thinking about Cas’ loyalty and how Dean has always let him down.
“I don’t want anything to happen to him,” Dean promises.
“You don’t get like, I don’t know, flavors from, you know, what you eat?” Dean asks.
“Who the hell are you?” Dean asks.
Sam’s lips curl like he’s going to snarl or bare his teeth, “Set me off? Like I’ll go darkside?”
“Without you I wouldn’t have made it back,” Sam admits, completely genuine, “you’re the most important part of this."
Yeah. Dean can remember Lucifer’s temporary host. The sad-looking guy who’s body was slowly burning away from housing an archangel it was never supposed to encounter.
A part of Dean wants to. He wants to see how many he could get. By the end of his year in purgatory he was able to handle a few mooks at a time on his own, and he never let
“I… I didn’t— I thought I had overstayed my welcome,” Cas confesses, “I didn’t realize you—”
Dean and the relief that Sam knows him is a cold shock, not a comfort, “Is that okay?” Sam asks.
“Plus the trials— it’s a spell, it’s magic. That’s what I’m doing with Cas,” Sam argues.
“How— how is it— how are you?” Dean tries to check in. His abs are starting to burn, he’s not sure he can hold this angle too much longer without a break.
It’s enough to make him sick. He can’t even drink his beer.
. Dean’s heart leaps out of his chest and does somersaults in his brain. Dean’s going to quit hunting and become a full-time bee house maker. Holy shit. Holy shit. He wants to make Cas smile like this forever.
“You’ve always had free will! And— and fuck, if you don’t, if this seraphim shit is real— then I’ll make sure we get you set free. Because free will, that’s what all of this: you, me and Sam? That’s what all of this has been about. We stopped god, the devil, heaven, hell,
Benny gives a quick tug on Dean’s jacket, “We gotta go,” he whispers. And when Dean’s legs are too locked up to move, Benny pulls him again, right to his feet, “now!”
“Doesn’t mean he’s fine,” Dean says.
“And you’re doing great,” Dean agrees, and thinks of what Dad would say. Would Dad even be holding Sam’s hand? Would he ignore it until Sam went quiet again, and assume all was handled?
Every single time he’s lost Cas races through his mind. One, two, three—
“Dude, you were basically dead this morning,” Dean deflects, “you don’t get to check in on me right now.”
Dean tries to wave Benny off. The motion gets both Cas and Benny’s attention.
(See the end of the chapter for
"I'm gonna go help Benny with his shit. Should only take a day or two. You coming?" Dean asks.
“You mean possess me?” Dean checks.
Dean laughs, “Oh boy, yeah. Dad would
Cas is like a toddler who's teething. Just discovered he can CHOMP and now wants to bite everything. RIP Dean, but at least you're kinda into that haha.
Dean loves Cas because Cas chose him. Keeps choosing him, and choosing to come back to him. Because Cas saw him at his worst, and stayed anyways… it can’t be a lie. It can’t. It
Dean pushes himself to his feet. His knees creak.
He looks to Cas. Who’s alive, despite everything. Cas is staring at him, openly fond. Dean ducks his head, smiles.
Sometimes they play games. Run hypotheticals. How would you kill this monster? What would you do in that scenario? What’s the first thing you want to do when we get home? If you could kill one person on earth, no consequences, who would it be? How would you do it?
trend towards strong attachments to men he’s attracted to (whether he’s aware of it or not).
“Hymns I understand,” Cas says, “worship. It… the sense of communion, of raising voices together. It’s almost angelic, or striving for it. This is… not that.”
Sam sniffles.
Dean feels pathetic every time he drags Sam to come to bed with him. Like Bobby’s going to judge him for being a grown man with a grown brother who wants to be the little spoon. Cause he should. This is embarrassing. They aren’t kids, and Dean can’t figure out anything better to help his brother’s massive trauma other than cuddling him at night like he’s a fucking baby.
Sam is all that matters.
I really wanted to emphasize the fact that Dean is the /only/ human in a realm of monsters. He's incredibly outgunned and out of his element!!
Cas’ frown intensifies, “You can’t sleep?”
These are almost worse than the screaming days.
“He’s gonna taste so good.”
The angels look predictably upset about it.
“Okay,” Dean agrees, “I can do that.”
“You’re so naïve,” she sighs.
“I didn’t know!” Sam protests.
“Dean!” Bobby snaps. He looks upset that Dean even thought about it.
The angels lunge, moving so fast that Dean’s eyes can’t track them. There’s sparks, like someone set off fireworks— Sam yells, and drops to his knees, and Dean’s hit with a recoil of angel grace, like a pressure wave, that knocks him back on his ass. His broken leg wipes the rest of his thoughts.
“Love?” Dean repeats, and he mentally kicks himself.
Vamp snarls, tries to break his wrist to make him drop his weapon. Dean twists, goes for the vamps eyes with his bloody hand. Scratches the skin, can’t get enough of a grip to gouge. The vamp stumbles back, lets him go. Dean hits the ground, twists to take it on his shoulder. Wolf is jumping forwards— he gets his sword up, core tight,
want him? Cas even said what he feels for Dean he
“Nah,” Benny shakes his head, “you leave an impression.”
Sam shakes his head. Because that’s
being the weird one, “you want engaged sex, I want to make you orgasm. I thought this was an acceptable compromise.”
“Yes,” Cas says, looks over the monster and then points to the left arm, “they were right-handed. The left will have a higher fat content.”
Dean whimpers, has to pull away. Cas pauses.
, he knows for certain that Cas is
Dean’s aware that his knuckles are hot. From hitting Sam. From being so frustrated that Sam won’t clean up his messy trauma, won’t recover nicely from being locked in hell with the fucking devil that it’s an inconvenience to Dean.
By Dean’s count he’s been on the run for a week. But he’s lost all sense of time. The endless twilight, the constant light fog and unchanging cool temperature make for the feeling that time doesn’t even exist here. Nothing changes. There’s no morning, no day, no night.
He’s collapsed on the floor, and Cas is kneeling over him.
“Yeah!” Dean snaps, “of course that’s ‘all’ this is! I’m telling you I’m a big flaming queer— there! You happy?”
“Bees?” Dean checks.
Cas frowns, “If this is bad—”
“This is an emergency,” she says. It's an agreement, it’s an opening for him to talk.
And we've covered season 5! I do firmly believe that Dean and Cas kissed at some point in the s4-5 era, but they refuse to talk about it because they're both silly beans. So, I made sure it's real in my story haha.
Cas to look at him the way Cas always looks at him: like he loves him. How easy and good this could be if Dean was a chick, all the heartache they could have saved over Dean’s queer fiasco. And Dean’s getting too caught up in his brain, in the emotions he’s barely got words for, let alone what he can even say out loud.
“I’m your ticket out,” Dean says. Tries to smirk. Even his smile falters.
“I’ll take care of Cas,” Dean promises, to cut Bobby off from having to recount the horrible memory of having to kill the woman he loved, “besides, he’s more likely to have to save my ass.”
“He smells amazing.” Another voice.
Lucifer. Cas what do you make of that?”
“What does that mean?” Dean asks.
noticed that, because he kept kicking Dean under the table to make him stop.
They have to pause so Cas can get his clothes off. And then Dean has to teach him how to use a condom properly.
Cas looks down at their shoulders, brow furrowed, and then he slowly leans into Dean. It’s not
“My family is not what I thought,” Cas admits. He and Dean are sitting on the hood of the impala under an open night sky.
Dean picks the robe up off the floor with his free hand and does a test sniff. Like a week of bed rest ago it might have passed, but now it just stinks.
“Massive. You better hope we never run into one, because then we’ll be fucked.”
“Dean,” Bobby says, disappointed.
? The two of them spent so much time together, training Sam, that it hadn’t occurred to Dean that they would also, y’know, talk about stuff. Or shit they have in common. Dean glances over to Bobby, again. He suddenly feels like the odd man out here. Bobby shrugs. They’re just two normal guys, sitting in a room with an angel and the psychic he’s been training.
“No,” Cas says, “extremely powerful magic such as bending time lines is beyond me without access to the power of the host. But barring catastrophic damage, I am designed to be self-sustaining. I will survive. Although… will it be an inconvenience if I am around more?”
“So do you,” Sam says.
Benny clicks his tongue at him, “The exit? That’s for me to know, or else, what’s the point of working together?”
“Are his eyes?”
Death takes another sip.
human. The connection to source is so fundamentally different between angels and humans that I don’t think Sam could understand anything I show him.”
The two vamps standing over Dean move to fight. It takes the boot off his hand, and he grabs for his sword. The vamp on his back grabs him by the hair, yanks, and arches Dean’s back to keep him from reaching. Dean strains against her, wills his stupid hair to break before she scalps him. That vamp is still whistling and—
And then Sam makes stupid fingerguns and shoots them at him. God, he’s
WHEW. As you've probably guessed by this point, I AM cherry-picking what events I talk about in relation to the Actual Spn Plot and which emotional beats I hit or make up for this story. In my mind the leviathan plot is very much ongoing and happening, but that's a lot of extra words when we've all watched the episodes. Hence the leviathans not showing up a huge amount. But the boys are still fighting them! And you can picture the Spn episodes as Sam's (relatively) good days.
Dean’s stomach drops at the thought, “Shut up! He’s gonna be fine!”
Cas listens to every word Sam says with the same focus he gives everything. It’s hard to look at Sam, to see the way his eyes look to the imaginary devil he’s talking to, so Dean focuses on Cas.
Dean isn’t sure how long it’s been since he mentioned that. Oh. And Benny remembered?
It’s a shape without form. In fact, he can’t even
It’s good that Cas is so focused at times like this, because the closer Dean gets to coming the less coherent he gets. Between pinching his own nips, and going hard at his own dick, when Dean lets out a low, gutteral moan, Cas lunges forwards to kiss him. He spreads his fingers. Dean yelps in his mouth, brings up his hand to grab Cas and hold him as they kiss. Dean can barely hold it, panting. Cas relaxes his fingers, strokes again at Dean’s prostate. Dean works his wrist faster, drags his thumb over the tip of his cock.
, “I want you no matter what, okay? You and me, we’re in this together.”
Fuck, Dean did. He was going to take Sam and him out, back while Sam was falling apart. But that… that was different. Was it? That was to end Sam’s misery. Dad wanted to kill Sam because he thought his own kid, his own flesh and blood, was evil.
“It’s
Cas looks shocked, “I thought it was… just the stimulus?”
“It sounds nice,” Dean admits.
Unless there’s an angel hiding in the body.
Leviathan.
Dean always thought women were the ones with curves. Benny’s got a body like a man, a
“Weight is irrelevant,” Cas says, “though theoretically I am limited if the action requires enough force that it would cripple my vessel faster than I could heal it. Which bed should I put Sam in?”
“Okay,” Cas agrees, “okay. I’ll go with you.”
It’s Dean’s turn to roll his eyes, “You’ve hated me since we met. Why?”
They made it.
Dean glances around, takes in their surroundings properly. There’s his machete. Looks like someone pulled a tree stump in to help conceal the opening of this little cave, which means they’re planning on being here for a while.
okay welcome back!! Thank you everyone for all the kind words last chapter. I can't believe we're here!!
It’s also Cas who comes up with the solution, when they realize that they won’t be able to make it to this supposed portal Benny knows about before Dean starves to death again.
He and Benny weren’t supposed to be in touch after purgatory. That was the deal. Their alliance lasted until they crawled out of Benny’s grave, and went their separate ways. Dean’s a hunter, Benny’s a vampire. They can’t get along.
Sam’s face twists into a grimace, “I just, uh, I remembered some stuff. Bad stuff.”
But he can ignore the pain, fake some smiles, and play the role that Sam and Bobby need.
“We can ward off the room, to potentially keep him out of the rest of the home,” Cas says, and he startles them all, including himself, when he yawns.
Dean walked them into this conversation, so he can’t let Cas wallow in those thoughts.
He doesn’t have anywhere else to go, since choosing Dean. Dean wants to be worthy of that choice.
“Well, despite my unhappiness with how he is handling things, I cannot get involved. Checks and balances, remember? But you… you three,” Death pauses, glances at Bobby, “four, I suppose. You have made yourselves delightfully third party. Neither demonic, divine, or entirely human. Dean and Robert aside, of course.”
“You did,” Dean insists. He can’t— he can’t lose Cas.
Cas glares down at Dean from his vantage point in the chair. But he pushes himself to his feet, and Dean realizes in that second that Cas might not be able to say no to him, and maybe
It doesn’t work.
Cas closes his eyes, and smiles, “Yes. It’s beautiful.”
“Ladies,” Dean jokes through gritted teeth, and because he’s looking into their faces now he can’t see the flashing lights and he’s got his brain back to himself, “there really isn’t enough of me to go around.”
self harm, suicidal idealization, suicide attempts, intense psychotic episodes (aka breaks from reality, some with violence to the self), and some ableist language as is Spn-Standard.
“So now we have a record to beat,” Cas decides.
“Yeah, you look like shit,” Bobby breathes out, “you don’t feel like killing me, do you?”
Cas isn’t around every day, but he tries to drop in when Dean goes to bed. Dean’s getting spoiled, if he’s being honest. Can spend a day throwing shit at Sam, to see if Sam can catch it with his psychic powers. Can work on the car, eat a great meal. He’s learning to cook real food, now that they have a kitchen they can properly stock. And then he goes to bed and has sex so great that he sleeps for a whole six hours straight. Rinse and repeat.
“Oh come on!” Dean groans. Death gave him his soul back! He shouldn’t be needing to touch Cas to feel less carved up inside.
This forest is open. Clear. The moon is high in the sky. And that’s what almost breaks Dean. The moon! It’s night! No more fading half-light, no more longing for the passage of time. He’s home.
We're out of purgatory!!! Starting now, if you'd like, you can start spotting and drawing connections between this and events/chapters in
Okay. Love makes beer tasty to angels? Dean learns something new every day.
“Don’t worry about me, I’ll be fine,” Benny offers, “and— ah, nevermind. You’re strong. You’ll be okay.”
he’s an angel, his mind clocks that it’s enough blood that a human should be dead.
Sam has been abandoned, agitated and astray for too long. Dean needs to get him in line, follow Dad’s orders, before he has to start thinking about the one time he disobeyed. If maybe he should have followed blindly.
“I’ll, um, I can try meditating. See if I get a vision on anything,” Sam offers.
. Benny kisses him, grabs him to pull him closer. Dean wants to touch him everywhere and simultaneously doesn’t know where to start. Benny’s beard is a weird sensation against his face, not something he’s used to. It scratches with his, throws Dean off for a moment, and then Benny opens his mouth, tongue slides into Dean’s, and Dean thinks
The bunker is home, but they’re still hunting. Sam gets visions of people in danger, and they take off with that as their only lead. Sometimes that leaves them spinning their gears for days trying to figure out where they’re supposed to be, and sometimes it means they show up just in time,
If you're keeping track: this coincides with the last half of chapter 1 of Sam's pov!
“What is that— angel aphrodisiac?” Dean guesses, and he gets backed into the door. It’s really hard not to kiss Cas, not when it feels so amazing, not when Cas gets a hand under Dean’s shirt and his fingertips feel like they’re setting off sparks in Dean’s skin and—
Cas’ gaze flickers to their entwined fingers, “This may make your need for secrecy regarding us difficult. I’m sorry.”
Cas’ eyes are backlit with grace, and he’s braced with one hand outstretched back to Dean and Benny, but he’s turned to look away from them. The woods are quiet around them. The woods are never quiet— there’s always someone dying. Unless… everyone is dead.
“I’ll, uh, I’ll start, I guess, if you… I don’t know. Wanna watch?”
“We’re
Cas is quiet for a moment before he says, “I don’t sleep.”
Dean yanks on Cas’ tie, because he can, “Do it.”
“I don’t know, man. Changing monsters into— I don’t know, still monsters? But with options? It sounds dangerous. It also sounds like the kind of thing angels are gonna notice,” Dean says.
“How’d we get separated?” Dean asks, “did someone grab you?”
Cas stands ready for a second, poised with sword ready and watching the space the angel just left. Dean holds his breath.
“Is that wise?”
“Where are your pants?” Dean demands. Sam kicks him back.
“I’m tired,” Dean whines. Can’t it wait until later? Cas can just… lay down right now, or something. Or they can get Cas into a bed so he and Dean can have sex.
Dean’s a nervous eater, and having a vampire who hates him ride shotgun while they wait to find out if their people are going to come back alive is more than enough to make him nervous. So they go to a diner to kill a few hours. They’re in the closest town to where Dean jumped earthside, so it’ll be a short drive once Sam calls that he and Benny are earthside again.
“Stop it!” Dean cuts him off, and he grabs Cas by the front of his jacket, like Dad grabbed him when Sam snuck out on Dean’s watch because how could Dean let Sam get away when Sam is
Well, not directly.
“Pullout might not work. Cas kinda left it a big mess,” Bobby reminds them.
for how it’s resonating in Dean’s skull, “I will not become a parasite again!”
Oh shit, right. Angel mojo.
“I’m sorry,” Dean says again, “I don’t have anyone else—”
to go back to heaven. There’s no way he would go back, not without saying something.
“And this one was prime material?” Dean guesses, “poor bastard.”
Which means he’s been free for a while. And hasn’t come looking for Dean.
Dean frowns, looks between Death and Sam again. Both Bobby and Cas look surprised. Death visited them before? And told Sam to stop? And Sam didn’t listen?
“Hey,” Sam says, and knocks his knee against Dean’s, “it’s okay. I get it.”
“It’s— it’s me,” Cas says. The glow of his grace hasn’t worn down, so his eyes are practically white at this point. He’s shaking so hard it would be scary if Cas
“But you’re here, so, you’re mates again,” Dean reminds her. She can’t be saying what he thinks she’s saying.
Dean glares at him, “Aren’t you reading me the riot act about how Cas
“You and Sam and your healthy alternatives,” Dean scoffs.
The two newcomers took out the first three in no time. These guys mean business. Dean pushes off the tree. Keeps his breathing even. Shoulders square, head up. Don’t show weakness.
He’s asleep before the first commercial break.
“Holy shit,” someone says, “it— that’s him. That’s the human.”
“You are definitely still the weird one,” Dean argues.
“You could try it,” Bobby offers.
“You said he went blind before?” Bobby checks.
Dean doesn’t call him on it, “Well, there’s supposed to be a shipment coming in tonight. We’re gonna stake it out, find out where the meat is coming from.”
“If there’s nothing, then why the tears?” Dean demands. Dad would do this, to help walk Dean through pain sometimes. Find the logic, realize the extra emotions are useless. Power through it.
Dean doesn’t trust himself to not say something stupid, so he nods in agreement.
Cas lowers Dean to the ground just as Benny jogs into the clearing. He’s carrying Cas’ vessel, and sets it down with intentional gentleness. Dean should be cooler than this, should be stronger, but his legs feel like jello and he wants to curl into a ball and freak the fuck out.
And he is. In fact, Dean can feel that he’s even gained back some of the weight he lost. He pushes off of Cas to look at himself. He looks like a normal human again. His wrists don’t look like Skeletor, he can’t count all of his ribs. He doesn’t look like a kid wearing Dad’s clothes anymore.
“You done?” Bobby asks. He’s got the same tone he did when Dean hit Sam, when Bobby thought Dean was being too much like Dad.
“What?” Dean demands. What does he say? What can he say in defense of himself?
“We found a way to change me back,” Dean explains, “before I fed on anyone. It wouldn’t, uh, work on you. Sorry. ”
There’s only one small glimmer of relief: the leviathans think Cas is with Dean. It means they haven’t gotten to him yet either. Dean can still take him home.
“What did you do, Sam?” Death says, “I’ve never seen anything like it. And not a collar or handle on him. Well…” Death looks over his shoulder at Dean, “you’ve got one leash. But it’s a weak one.”
“What the fuck does that mean?” Dean asks.
Dean inspires in Cas. Would it have made Dean into another mouth, another set of teeth? Would he have been in that darkness forever, only knowing endless hunger with no way to satiate it?
Dean crosses the space between them, throws a leg over Benny’s thighs. Straddles his lap to make his point clear.
“You don’t want to do that!” Dean snaps. He twists his neck hard to look over his shoulder. Three whole vamps, fuck him.
“I won’t take you out, because I won’t have to,” Dean says, and he looks down at his shoes, “you’re gonna do right this time. It’s going to be okay.”
“What is wrong with you?” Dean asks.
“What’s up?” Sam asks when Dean barges into his room. He’s doing
Alarms go off in Dean’s head. He’s flirting. With a man. Dean should redirect the conversation, make it clear that he’s not queer. That he’s just shooting the shit.
okay, that is very different from fingers. He wants to look anywhere
Sam eats a lot. He devours every salad and quinoa bowl he can get his hands on like he’s the hungry hungry caterpillar or something. It’s too soon to be putting on weight, but, Sam already looks like a human again and not a corpse just waiting to die.
Dean is about to offer otherwise— he’ll take care of it, he will, so she doesn’t have to handle her lovers corpse— but she’s already standing, vampire strength showing in that she’s not even struggling to lift Benny’s body despite her small frame. Dean wraps Benny’s head in his jacket.
touch Sam like that again.”
“Is he—”
“I’m up— Sam, how’s Sam?” Dean asks, heart in his throat, “and Cas? Are they—”
No time for speculations. There are things to kill.
“No! Not without you!”
Dean gets the jump on Cas this time. Cas is surprised, or willing enough, to let Dean push him back against the door. He likes the roughness of Cas’ stubble against his, likes the way Cas curls his fingers to the back of Dean’s head, fingernails scratching in his short hair, pulling him close.
Cas frowns, “I cannot contract or pass along any infections. It’s not necessary.”
“Oh, so now you think maybe we should have let them keep fucking up his head? Treating him like a dog?”
“Dean’s right,” Bobby agrees, backing Dean up, “let’s take a time out, come back in—”
“Do what?” Dean asks.
“You’re not sleeping,” Cas points out.
A bad guy. A monster. Someone awful enough that the only way to escape him was to kill him. For all that people talk shit on John Winchester, for all that Dean feels morbid relief at being free from Dad, at least Dad was never bad enough that Dean had to kill him.
to an angel yes? Sam said he
, Cas told him.
“How did he touch your grace?” Dean demands, “aren’t you being careful?”
“What if we institutionalized him?” Bobby asks, “put him under a fake name, let the people who know how to handle this shit handle it. And we come back and get him when it’s safe again.”
Dean tries to take the praise. Truth be told, he’s exactly the kind of killer his Dad raised him to be. But he’s queer too, he figures. Win some, lose some.
“No!”
“If you think that makes me an easy meal, you got another thing coming,” Dean growls.
The can in Dean’s hand makes a loud noise as he squeezes it too tight. He forces himself to relax his hand.
Benny notices Dean staring. Mouth curls into a smile, the way that makes him look hot. He shifts his stance, inches his leg forwards, lifts the knee and— and
“Hey,” Dean says, and then wonders if he should wink. He’s so awkward.
As long as Dean doesn’t fuck up, he knows he can prove that he’s still useful.
Sam rolls his eyes, “Cas thought it was funny.”
“There are other factions that will challenge her,” Cas sighs, “I can only assume this is the calm before the storm.”
“I’m sorry,” Sam grimaces.
“You mean like a vision?”
He wants Bobby to wake up and call him. Fuck it, he’d even accept if his Dad showed up out of the blue.
“I’m not— we’re not—” Dean’s got to stop being a big queer so he can be friends with Cas. So he can go back to having a normal life. Besides, Andrea is right
“Any bit helps,” Dean agrees.
“In purgatory,” Cas starts, because that’s the obvious thing to bring up. How gung ho Dean was about fucking dudes.
Dean hates that question. Bobby should know better to ask it. But in terms of Cas, of how it feels to have Cas nearby, when Cas looks at him and sees Dean, when Cas knows Dean and chooses him… yeah, that feels pretty good. Cas wants Dean to be his home. Cas wants to
“Where? Your bed?” Dean scoffs. And he feels his stomach churn at the thought of Sam outing him right now, of Bobby suddenly understanding why Dean’s losing his shit over Cas and realizing how pathetic Dean is.
“And what do you mean by
“Hey, hey, whatever’s going on, we’re gonna figure it out,” Dean promises him. He drops to one knee so he can pull Cas’ hand away from his face. Cas resists him at first— it’s like trying to pull a parked car, but then he relents and lets Dean move him.
“Why would God set a plan in motion that is wrong?” Cas demands. His eyes light up in the dark. For a brief second the headlights of every car in the motel parking lot come on. Including Dean's car. Dean gets the sense that his hackles are up. Cas gives his head a small shake and all the lights turn off.
“Now try with that.”
Sam wants that, is asking for it, and even though Dean would rather pull his fingernails out than try and describe how badly he misses Cas, he remembers his new mantra:
“What?” Dean scoffs.
him.”
Shouting behind him. It sounds fucking tribal with all the hooting and hollering. This is some ‘most dangerous game’ bullshit, and Dean is
Cas doesn’t kiss him.
Dean doesn’t know how long Benny is actually gone for. They seal Dean in with a big log that should hide the entrance from curious eyes. Small bits of half-light spill in, so Dean can see when he squints. There’s not a lot of room in here. He can almost stretch out when he’s lying down, which is nice.
They manage to finish the puzzle now that Sam’s here to help.
“Me?” Dean almost laughs, and looks down at Cas’ unconscious vessel on the cot, “dude, I am not angel quality—”
So this chapter is coming to you from a very happy author who smells like coconut tanning oil and was vibing too hard to Muse's re-release of Origin of Symmetry lol.
“How are you feeling?” Cas asks.
Death makes a sweeping gesture towards Sam, “long live the new king of hell.”
could say, should say, should talk about. Could talk about. Cas lifts a hand, sets it over Dean’s on his shoulder, and with a small shift, their fingers curl together.
Bobby nods, like this makes sense. Dean breathes a sigh of relief at not being a dick and throwing Sam under the bus for sleeping with guys too.
Cas glares at Dean like he’s the crazy one, “No. It’s not that. It’s— I don’t like you being subservient, like you’re something to be owned. You are Dean Winchester.”
happy?" Dean counters.
Dean even took him to the brothel to get him laid. Christ. Now this is awkward as fuck.
Cas makes a soft sound, his hands come up to cup Dean’s face to kiss him.
“Didn’t you say you knew too much?” Dean asks.
He doesn’t like the taste of come. It never gets any better, even when he knows what to expect. Kind of hates how it fills up his mouth. Only now is Dean realizing what good actors most chicks are, when they say they like the taste and swallow without flinching. But Benny fucking
It looks like someone exploded all over the upholstery. There’s blood
He has to ask Sam if Sam wants to die. And then what? They line their pockets with rocks and walk into the ocean together? They go back to the impala, find some garage, and lock themselves in until the fumes take them out? Does Dean soothe Sam, makes sure he’s comfortable, and then shoot his brains out before eating his own gun?
“Easiest way to keep a secret,” Benny confirms, “is if no one knows about it.”
“He’s dead?” Bobby realizes.
“It was good to see you, Dean,” Benny says, and pats Dean’s back once before he steps away.
And we're off to Purgatory (my beloved) on Wednesday! Which means we're technically about to catch up to the start of Sam's story :)
messing around with a dude, and tucks his shirt into his jeans. Wait. Why did he do that? He never tucks his shirt in. He untucks his shirt.
This isn’t normal for him, he’s distantly aware of that. He’d be worrying himself sick over Sam and Cas downstairs, probably crying and cradling Sam in his arms until his brother wakes up. And then running outside to help Bobby with whatever situation is out there.
?” Sam realizes.
?” Sam asks.
“So heal him,” Dean demands.
“Dean?” Cas asks, and reaches out, sets a hand on Dean’s arm. He’s turned his shoulders, facing Dean, and it leaves him open.
The floor is much better, thank you very much.
He also recognizes the pain in Cas. Even when they’re doing their best not to see each other, they’re still so similar. Dean had one job: take care of Sam, and he fucked it up royally. He’s never been good enough.
“What’s wrong with your armor?” Sam asks.
“What the
The dark? His lamp was on.
There are Fun Zoology Facts at the end of this chapter. Enjoy!
Easy enough to convince Cas with that. Second finger definitely feels too soon to the point that it might even hurt. But it’s over so quickly, Dean’s body adjusting, that Dean thinks he actually enjoys it.
, weirdo. ‘m tired. Sleep now.”
One of the things Dean talked about nonstop in Purgatory was eating all the pie he could get his hands on. He’d even eat cake, just for the sweet flavor. So when he and Bobby are watching the cooking network, and Dean boasts he could do better, and Bobby challenges
“But I’ve been seeing him,” Sam notes, and takes a nervous breath, “he’s been talking to me— I said— oh god I said
Benny notices his hesitation.  He’s always read Dean too easily.
Eat, drink and be merry because tomorrow they’re all going to die.
And now: WELCOME TO PURGATORY!!!
Dean wants to say yes. To slip out, to try and keep Sam totally unaware. But he can only imagine the fallout if Sam comes looking for him, or worse, if something goes wrong with Sam and he doesn't know how to get in touch with Dean.
Cas hesitates, then says, “you and Dean do have the sigils to hide you from heaven’s eyes. Will you be safe?”
“You’re welcome,” Dean says, and steps back. He hasn’t lost control of himself. Not yet. Purgatory is trying to change him, but Dean has to resist it.
Dean remembers sitting on a park bench across from Cas, looking at kids playing and the sun shining. Now it’s the two of them, here, at what could be the end of the world.
Cas sniffs the coffee curiously.
Dean’s stomach lurches. He breathes slowly. Don’t let the panic overtake him.
Cas manifests in the air, coat flared out and body curved, as he delivers a kick to the underside of the vessel’s head that shatters her jaw. She stumbles back from the hit— a normal person would have gone flying, might have even lost their head— and then Cas has landed on his toes, and he’s spinning to stab with his sword in his backwards grip.
“We don’t have time,” Sam agrees, and looks away from all of them to an empty space, “what do I need to do? Okay, okay, yeah. Like that. Dean—” Dean pays attention now that he’s being addressed, “I need you beside Cas. So I can touch both of you. Bobby you should go,” Sam says, “this isn’t going to be pleasant.”
“Fluffy as hell,” Dean assures him, “now are you done soaking? I feel like it can’t be that warm anymore.” And his ass hurts from sitting on the toilet to keep Cas company.
Instead he likes finding out that Cas’ wrists are sensitive, that pressing a kiss to the blue veins there, to the white scars across them that Dean drank from in purgatory, makes Cas’ eyes light up. That Cas likes being provoked, or goaded into showing his strength. That he likes leaving marks, and is absolutely fascinated when Dean explains hickeys. No matter how trashy they are. That when Cas flips them over, to pin Dean to the bed, his eyes glow and the lights flicker.
“How mindful of you. You came all this way to tell me this?”
"Finally free."
The grace appeared to be finally out of the body, reaching just above the center of the barrel, and Dean waited for a second just to be sure that there was nothing left. Once he received a squeeze on the shoulder, accompanied by a low ‘mm-hm,’ he carefully took the needle out and put the cap on it. Now, his full attention on Cas, Dean was able to assess the damage.
As soon as Dean parked the Impala by the side of the road, Cas sprinted out of the car. He left his still full cup on the pavement near the door.
“I was informed.”
“That’s it,” he said, took the syringe out of the pocket, and handed it over. “You can extract it.”
“Not an option.” Cas shook his head, deep crinkles forming between his brows. “The Empty is the only place that holds celestial beings and demons. If closed, chaos will unfold.”
