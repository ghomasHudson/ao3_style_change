It’s Sherlock turn to blush. John likes it on him.
He intended to pretend to sleep. What Sherlock hadn’t intended was to actually fall asleep. His years on the streets kicked in with the quiet opening of the door.
He hears John talking then after a time, the door closes. His patient has left. He hears John’s feet softly padding up the stairs.
“No one is perfect, not even an ingenious serial killer who gets close enough to her victims to administer the sedative. That’s the key. The sedative is not ingested, yet is transferred somehow to the victim. It must be through the skin, but how.”
“You are certainly a good catch,” she said as John shut the door.
“John, it is impairative that we speak about my memory returning.” Sherlock reads John so well.
“There are many forms of extraordinary,” Mycroft says, and John wants to pound his face until it’s a bloody mess. “Common does not necessarily mean one is unintelligent. You know that, doctor.”
Sherlock knew. It was Shame. He was sitting beside the man in the car.
“Yes. It was nice to meet you, Sherlock.”
Mycroft raises his eyebrow. How could Mycroft question that? They’re brothers!
He goes into his flat, gets Sherlocks meds, some food. He’s for shite at taking care of himself. John knows Anthea will track him on his mobile and leaves it on the table. He checks his service revolver still stuffed in the back of his jeans. He may need it although he hopes not. It’s beginning to get dark.
“But there
“Released for good behavior, or did you escape?”
“A shame you can’t appreciate that characteristic.”
as part lake, part quarry, but I think John does that enough in the story. What I do want to do is write a bit about how I wrote this story--a bit of meta processing. This story began long ago as another work that sat in my old desktop computer and never came to fruition. I had part of the first chapter written and that was all. I liked the premise, yet had a hard time where to go with the young protagonists. Although it's a story about John coming out, I wanted a secondary plot. I didn't have it.
He has nightmares of sand and blood. Part of it's his past; the other part is the novel he read about this island. It all melds together. A crack of a rifle and hard thud to the ground. Blinding pain that shoots from his shoulder to his fingertips. Then another series of dreams seep in. All repetitious. Tedious, as Sherlock would say. Dreams where John dabs salve all over Sherlock's arms and legs. He's done it so much in the past, it's a part of their shared history. Instead of wounds it's mosquito bites. He sleeps fitfully through the dreams. He's unsure how many times he wakes to Sherlock forcing water or his nasty salty hydration stuff down him. He is sure that Sherlock hasn't left his side. He helps him get up to piss on more than one occasion. He's always hovering beside the bed when he wakes—curls unruly and wild from the humidity of the ocean air along with white worry-lines creasing his lobster-red face.
It seemed fitting that the memory of what happened between two strangers be forever locked at Rest Area 818.
Sherlock’s eyes glowed an unearthly green as they parted.
John completes a mental eye roll. “Um, that means you need to
“I have the cure,” her voices lilts from behind the door.
Sherlock nods and bounces on this toes. “You may be of help.”
The next day, his mom's eyes were swollen and her face blotched when his dad stumbled in the door, still drunk. Harry left for school, but he couldn't go, wouldn't go. Not to leave his mom to this man who pretended that he was still their father.
“In part. But it’s a generous offer. You’ll have a salary. Not much, but it will pay for food, your share of the flat. Economically, it helps me out too.”
“Yes, I believe that to be the point of all this,” Sherlock agrees, moving his fingers around inside John's hot hole. He bends and laps around John's puckered-tight heat where it's trapped his fingers inside. He takes a moment to slide his tongue back and down to John’s tailbone before coming up and around his fingers again.
The door swung open.
He'd learned about the secret rendezvous site by chance, sitting in Martha's Truck Stop at three in the morning. The truck stop was only three miles from the place his family had rented him until school would begin. It was tedious waiting for the summer classes to start. There wasn't much to do, but he did like watching the customers here. His landlady ran the place, and she gave him free refills of coke and coffee.
Christ, the man was just inches above him in the bed, and John couldn't stop thinking about him or that wicked reoccurring dream he kept having about his roommate. The dreams were so vivid, so life-like. He'd had dreams like this before, but not about sex and especially not about sex with a man.
“Most of the flowers chosen for the hothouse attract the butterflies and bees housed within. Note how the vents are covered in fine mesh. I stumbled upon it in my study of the city, its streets and hidden spaces. It’s the only place I can recall that a person would have those particular flowers during this time of year on— as you pointed out— their socks.”
, as you say, is not reading a book where I know what's going to happen after the first page, much like that biology textbook you're reading."
Sherlock spins around, facing John, and cups his chin, brushing his finger through his beard. "There is something more I wish to do with you, here while we're alone together."
"The last intelligence Mycroft received on her, she was living in Belize, then she fell off the map. It's entirely unlikely she would be here."
I open my lids, and it's the blue eyes staring into mine that keep me from falling back into the cave.
For the first time Will glimpses up at John. “Not true, John Watson. A few days ago, I would have thought I divined it somehow. You showed me I am not. I was the transparent one to you.You taught me something about myself. I simply used logic and observation to determine the password.” Will points to the keyboard where the keys were most worn. "This smear across the
“I’m not suggesting. It’s already been suggested for the world to see. The latest online information with lies filtered in with some truth, and the truth is that Pandora’s Box was opened up and released targeting those with a specific genome— one that almost everyone had.”
They lie side-by-side almost tumbling off the couch but hold each other in place. Neither one wants to be the one to let go.
As each day ticks past, John's misery increases.
I begin to shake and do not try to hide it. While I have to use some of my acting skills to convince Paylar, this is not pretense. In fact, I believe I am about to lose consciousness. Even Paylar notices. I clutch my coat for security.
“Want me to help you take these off?” John asks. Sherlock nods in a daze. And counts: 168 with a regular rhythm.
He’s washing one of the large double windows in the living room, and I’m washing the other while Rosie plays with a toy truck on the Agra rug, using the large geometric patterns in it for roads.
He pulls out the cell Beca Bellin provided. It’s a reminder of what he will no longer have. Ironic he’s using it to text Helena. He’s coming around the side of the building along the drive and isn’t surprised to see the black sedan driving slowly behind him.
The way he said my name, so familiar, so sincere. I shook my head.
John wakes all tangled in Sherlock Holmes: a leg thrown over his, right arm wrapped around him. He’s so bloody gorgeous that John can’t help but touch him. As he tentatively brushes against Sherlock’s long back, he admires the smattering of freckles. He needs to get up and use the neighbor’s loo but as he untangles himself, Sherlock wakes. The moan that escapes Sherlock sends blood and heat to parts of John that already are a bit stiff.
“When did you eat last?” John asks. “At least let me get one of the nurses to bring you a tray.”
“A passphrase? Codeword? How was I intended to answer? Some sort of trick.”
John promised Sherlock’s mum he’d bring her son home. Two months later, he does. For Christmas.
Hard to keep track of time, but judging by when I'm brought meals, I've been on this damned tub for nearly ten days now. The men who serve me meals give me no straight answers—especially since I DON'T SPEAK FRENCH. They keep repeating something that I'm pretty sure means island paradise. I doubt that. The only paradise I want right now is my hands around your neck.
“They thought I was knocked out from the morphine. And they would have been looking for a man. People see, but they don't observe.”
“That so?” John smiled. He might as well be polite. “Where’s that?”
“Here, give me your hand,” he says, “and I’ll help. I’ll steady you. There ... that’s it. Watch that foot. It’s slippery with the bag on it. I’m not having you fall over and hit your head again. I’ll take care of you.”
When Sherlock fired up a second joint, paranoia struck John to the core. It was most evident in his flicking eyes and twitching jaw. Watching Watson squirm caused a most unusual sensation inside Sherlock's chest.
“I made soup!” Sherlock exclaimed. “Tomato. With crackers.”
“It was the result of losing my arm and Alphons. After I found that by simply pressing my palms together, then touching a chosen solid object at hand, I could call on the elements. Using whatever element that object possesses, I can wield objects, fire, air, and water.”
“Why ever would I want to write as a ghost,” Sherlock huffs. “I’d be dead. How could an incorporeal being use a laptop?”
I feel nothing. I am crushed and buried beneath the rubble. I can hide here from the world and no one will find me, but the one's Merlin warned me about have found this secret place, and they push off the boulders.
He comes thinking of John Watson. He hopes soon he’ll come with him.
“What’s wrong?” he asks.
“One of you is lying. And you both want something. What is it that you want?”
“If you decide to wake me like this, I will be,” he says pulling the sheet up over his waist. “I need to get up and go the loo, then after, we can talk about this.”
John blinks and blushes. Will is quick. He caught the familiar usage of her first name. “Um, yes. Dated her for a short time. Very short. We just didn’t...jive. Nice enough woman.”
He didn't want to think about his roommate this much, but he couldn't seem to stop. Just like he couldn't stop dreaming about his roommate.
“You are, at least until your memory completely returns and you become all soft and humane again,” she says.
"You have more to lose than I do," Mary states. "Your partner, Kate, and your daughter. You really think you can keep them safe?" It's a Mary foreign to John. Her threat is cold, mechanical.
"He didn't agree. In fact, he threatened the wrong person."
It feels like I’ve been struck with a brick. John blamed himself for doing nothing! I can no longer sit by. I kneel in front of John.
“Our relationship.” John sits up. “You said it’s about us.”
“What if you have a boyfriend...or girlfriend or some other person you don’t remember?!”
He walks through the scrub and across the dock to get a bucket of water to sluice off the sand and sweat before going into the boat. Each time he picks his way along it, he says a little prayer that the dock will hold. He's decided to eat and take a kip. There's not much else to do. Still, he keeps himself alert just in case he has a visitor. He looks through the books that were left and picks up the novel. He even finds a pair of his reading glasses. He sighs. What he really could use are sunglasses.
The familiar steps of Mrs. Hudson echoe up the stairs. She pops her head inside.
John usually didn't take time to notice what girls wore, but Molly was hard to miss. She had on a red and purple floral print dress bright enough to be seen even from the front of the auditorium.
, huh? You think that's where you got 'Hawkins' from?"
While the body had been removed, the crime scene remained undisturbed. It was indeed gruesome. Blood covered the floor.
“He means the bugs, John.”
From that day forward until the day the foundry closed, John never again resented the odd, foul smell on his dad's clothes because he knew that that was the invisible badge of honor his dad wore.
The whoosh of a door swinging open stops their words.
-------------------
“Nice ta see you again,” he says as he turns around and smiles. I also remember that. His false smile and the gold tooth.
He remembers an umbrella. It’s not very extraordinary. But...
I’ve got the catman firmly by the ankle, and he’s clawing at the steps as I drag him down with a thunk, thunk, thunk. I’m almost to the bottom, and I grab his other leg to pull him down the last two. I take a hold of a handful of leotards and pull. His not-so superhero tights slip down, leaving his arse exposed and up in the air.
"I'm here to interview a patient, actually. Molly probably told you about him — impersonated a doctor? Shouted to everyone that Sir Arthur's wife had poisoned him? Quite the turn-up. I'll try to catch you after."
I went to Dr. Bellin with a list of measures we should take to catch the man, including security guards, telling her I believed he was the one responsible for the thefts. She nixed my ideas for further security measures. Even said to “remove those useless cameras.” So I was sort of seething when Mike, Molly, and I went shopping after work. I wasn’t any closer to catching him, and Dr. Bellin had pulled my authority to catch the man. I didn't really need anything just then, but it's best to go in groups these days. Trips to a supermarket wouldn't have been worth mention before Pandora. But we were long enough without a properly stocked one that I get curious to see what it’s got in.
“Sophy, you are making a mistake,” Sherlock says through the pain. “This is not about the past. Think of now. I am a asset you can not ignore. Think of all I can give you.”
Shame asked John.
On this particular stakeout, John tracked our suspect to the door of the woman who was the suspect’s alibi for the night of murder. She’d told John and I she’d only just met the suspect. I, of course, knew better from the way she nervously flicked her eyes. I told John as much, but he, however, had believed her story. I admit she gave an outstanding performance about how their chance meeting at Tesco led to him walking her home because “he was a true gentleman.” I suppose she was attractive if one liked a slim, toned body in a short skirt. John wants to believe in someone’s innocence. That’s what is so amazing about him: he sees everyone without guilt, while I see guilt in almost every place I look.
Sherlock eyes grow wider. There behind his past self on the video in large, white helvetica font painted on the side of the building is “Bocks Pharma.”
“You kept her,” Sophy struggles out, unable to let it go. “You confined her. Confused her. From what. She could. Have been.”
“I believe I’m in a paradox of sorts,” Sherlock begins. “I wanted to remember and now that I do, I am less certain of who I really am.”
“Until the next time we meet,” she says.
“I was. I took a wrong turn awhile back.”
“Come, John,” Sherlock says, standing up with the cat cradled in his arm, purring. “I wish to got home.”
______________
“I didn’t expect to see you again so soon,” John says.
The inside is stately and stiff to him. He’s not impressed. He’s certain that he’s never cared much for fine furniture or fancy furnishings. He likes nice things, but he’s decided that he likes comfortable in a home more.
“She is dangerous.” John says, and points to the note. “Always.”
have a son who’s sucking the life out of
"I see it, John. Have you known me to miss something so simple?"
Or Sherlock could be the one to move out instead of him. Get a place off campus. Live with Moriarty. Why else did Sherlock warn John away from him? Because Moriarty knew what Sherlock was. They were two of a kind. The way Sherlock couldn’t let go when talking about him--Sherlock might as well move in with him.
“And myself.”
“If I never remember, then no one will have the key to re-creating or mutating Pandora. Problem solved. If you shoot me, then problem solved too.”
He can't go. But a part of him wishes… “Thank you, Mrs. Hudson.”
“Something about inside information regarding a few of my department,” Greg says. “But Sherlock didn’t say who or give any specifics.”
That’s another reason why he needed to leave.
William is still thinking about the idea of home during the short drive back to John's, and this leads him back to considering the rooms he doesn't want to tell John about — the ones filled with the information he uses to understand what people keep hidden. The rooms themselves feel like home, the layout so completely familiar he moves through it without any effort. But what kind of home is filled with impossible things? Not just impossible: macabre. Unsettling. File cabinets buzzing with flies. Display cases of exit wounds. He finds half completed chemistry experiments in labs. Jars with heads and hands and toes and eyes. He finds rooms with bodies stacked in crypts. He’s fascinated and afraid every time he opens the vault drawers. He is mad or a murderer? Why would he keep these macabre images in his head? What sane person would enjoy studying a corpse to see how fast it dissolves in different solutions?
Here I go dissecting the Aquarium scene and calling foul. As a fandom, so many have written superior meta on this. So much never made sense, but most of all for me it never made sense to have John do nothing. This chapter (and the next) offer my fix it.
“I can’t say as I like being kept in the dark,” Greg frowns. Sherlock just ignores Greg’s stare.
“Might as well have been. It was open.”
There have been days when I believed that her catatonic state was of Mycroft’s making. With emotions, she became unpredictable. In the state she’s in, she can do no harm.
. The protagonist was also an American football player, a quarterback, just as in the movie
“I believe I said that,” Sherlock said.
She seemed amused. “I never had a garden,” she replied. “Always wanted one though.”
Thank you, hotshoeagain for the beta and pointers.
John pats William on the back for the second time in the evening. “Or a locksmith. As far as criminals, I'm the one who just took a potshot at someone."
“Message? What’s the message?” John asks.
Sherlock’s hands move boldly down to capture that need. "Bed," he whispers.
“Not for the better.”
Mycroft greets them with Mummy standing all giddy behind. She races around her eldest son and throws herself into Sherlock’s arms.
When he’s dropped off at the door of 221b, Mrs. Hudson practically suffocates him with hugs, kisses,
“Until next time,” Sherlock replies, with that, Mycroft leaves.
“All you’ll need to do is look at her. You’ll know,” Anthea says.
Sherlock followed him behind the building and into the brush.
Still nothing.
"Do you have a girl friend?" Sherlock asked, voice echoing off the ceiling just above him.
“Mm,” Sherlock says, straddling him. “I do have something else for you,” Sherlock says. “But I plan to take my time to give it to you. I'll begin by kissing all your sensitive, hidden spots. I’m going to make you gasp and plead.” He nips John’s neck and licks his ear. John groans in approval.
"Then, let me ask you this at least. Have you noticed anything out of the ordinary in my brother's behavior?"
“Before you say no, I have one more proposition for you. Actually, it was Mike who suggested it. The more I thought on it, the more it makes perfect sense. I could use a flatmate.”
duties."
Mycroft ignores the anger aimed at him as he looks over John’s shoulder at the posts.
He took my hand. "I...I love you," he barked out.
Sherlock slaps another mosquito. John's secretly happy that they seem to really love his blood and leave John alone. Actually, he can see why they view him as a preferable meal. Tender flesh. Sweet tasting.
I have to dislocate my thumbs, but I get my wrists out of the ropes. I sway to the side to snatch the Glock from Norbury’s coat. My fingers brush against the barrel, but I am still teetering back and forth. Norbury realizes my hands are free. My free arm wraps around Norbury’s neck—more for balance than to overcome him.
I sat back heavily on the couch.
I don't care what you think your reasons are. There is no good reason. Kidnapped. Again. Only this time you're not rescuing me, you're the cause.
“Stop! Yes, you’re a wanker at times, but you didn’t let it happen. You had an impossible choice. You say you remember what you were like? I know you, and you’re for shite at interpreting human emotions! Tell me what you did as a consulting detective for Scotland Yard? How many crimes did you solve?”
John, no. I gave my heart to you long ago, but you never realized. You still don’t see. Although a BAMF never misses the mark, at least John Watson does when it comes to identifying the object of my affections.
“Thank god for Molly. She’s always there for us in a clutch,” I said. John eyes me warily. “Or Sandra?”
Listening to “I Can’t Get No Satisfaction” and “Paint It Black,” the morgue remains rather slow— a few straightforward post mortems. Causes of death, natural. They bag and label the clothing and personal effects. They leave jewelry on the bodies as always. He also decides that while The Rolling Stones aren’t truly classical, he’s going to learn to play “Wild Horses” on the violin.
“I was thinking, John. What if we decided to change a few things.” I glance over at him.
“Or a criminal.”
My left hand brushes over my occipital lobe where the tiny chip is embedded.
Sherlock blushes. John laughs, but another part of him can't wait to taste him. They need to get out of this blasted sand trap first. Despite their precautions, he feels as though every niche and cranny is gritty with the stuff.
A second wonder, Sherlock is actually eating too. The third is that John’s apron could look so enticing on Sherlock. John appreciates how the blue stripes compliment Sherlock’s eyes and how the cotton clings and pulls against Sherlock’s chest as he lifts his fork to his mouth.
don’t you end of being one of them with your senseless questions about my past. I had such high hopes for you.”
Not that my initial ideas have done any good. I thought we'd stopped the thefts, but a few days later I asked security to check the new camera, and it wasn't working. We found the camera's data cable had been very neatly cut, except for the one line that powers the little red indicator light. Quite impressive really. Or so I think now. I was livid when I found out. I asked around and realized that people were definitely missing cash and cards. More was gone from the pharmacy. They'd trusted my security measures. Now I've let them down. Then this mystery doctor manages to get access to an ID badge, giving him Carte Blanche to the whole hospital.
"I did. I had some of the biscuits in the tin."
“The details. The who and what. Some truthful observations about some of his officers and the consequences that will follow if Lestrade does not act on my observations. And also a hint about what his role is in all of it.”
Without my chemical crutch, my body betrayed me. My omega scent glands responded to the alpha's and their mixed aroma mingled, filling the lab. The alpha's eyes never left mine as he circled the bed. He stopped and sniffed me as if I were the most intoxicating fragrance he'd ever known.
He steps out of the police vehicle as Anderson grunts goodbye, and it’s raining. Of course it is. He climbs the stairs to the flat. His one set of footsteps sound so hollow, and Blackbeard’s lonesome meow at the door sounds like John’s future.
————————————-
“I’ll get his legs, you grab him under the arms,” says Calhoun.
At least two other people held it. I’ve ruled out Mycroft: Eurus knew he would never want to touch my heart, literally or figuratively. Moriarty? Not his fingerprints, and besides he vowed to burn it out of me, not fold it up. Mary? She knew I had a heart. She aimed at it. As for Mary’s knowledge of Eurus? She must have known about Eurus. Her prints would be easy for me to check, yet I have not. I do not need to do it to know the truth.
But, for John, it was seeing our suspect pull out a key and opening her front door that rankled John to his core. He knew then that he was wrong about her.
“Would you like to join us for breakfast? Coffee?” John asks.
"Really? That's all," John said. "I'm sure you got right out of them, what with your being double-jointed and all. I've seen you sitting and doing that yoga right over there on the rug next to the desk. Do you have bones?"
To give her a bit more space, he stands and walks across the room. He touches the stuffed bear on the chair near the windows, then steps up to the bookcase with his back to her to give her a few more moments to compose herself. Of all the books one stands out. It’s a well-worn copy of
“That is not why.”
John bites the pillow and shifts his knees in closer. Sherlock slips another finger inside, opening him. His other hand skims over John's hip to steady himself. His fingers pop out, and he takes hold of the base of his cock and pushes the tip against John's opening. It's been some time since John bottomed for anyone but he feels relaxed, centered.
“How?” John asks. “How could she even think it would work?” John sways in his chair, and I want to go to him, but stay seated on the couch.
“Wait,” John says, his eyes fixed on Sherlock’s mouth. “I’ve been wanting to do this since I woke up this morning.” He pulls Sherlock toward him as John stands to meet him.
“Dinner first?” John asks.
“And this one! That’s not
Yes, wait until after three. That way he could avoid Miss Stephanie.
“I’m not a hero, and don’t make me into one.” John barks out. He holds out his left hand. "You figured out my shoulder wound. But did you also notice my intermittent hand tremor?"
He reminds himself he’s doing the right thing as he steps down the stairs.
"You should have said something sooner."
Of course she introduced us to Victor Frankenstein's portrait. He had a prominent place in the rather long hallway of Frankenstein history. He appeared a handsome older gentleman, but not one who fit the name—or, at least, my preconceptions about how he should look. The man on the wall resembled Father Christmas more than my imagination's portrait of Mary Shelley's mad doctor.
He makes himself at home and finds more doubled ziplock bags of flour and sugar (he assumes it is since he can't read the labels) and tea, although he's not sure what kind. Someone has added bay leaves to what looks like powdered milk. Possibly. And pilot bread. There's biscuits in tins. And crisps, which he opens and finds stale despite the extra ziplock bags. He sits down at the dining table to take a break from the heat and puts his feet up on the extra bench.
"What? This is the most exciting thing that's ever happened to me. You think I'm gonna say no to this? I'm keeping the job."
"I'm also sure he wasn't offered it, but that he could easily make it seem as if he had," Sherlock said. He licked his lips.
“What?” he struggles to say.
"If you get worse, I'll have Rodrick fetch him. What's this do-gooder doctor's name?"
Sherlock dragged me in on top of him and cocooned us together inside his Belstaff. Our bodies were...how shall I say? Lined up.
Over a year later, and Eurus still continues to pull strings.
“Just stop.”
He hadn't realized it at the time, but his dad had made a decent living during those years. And despite the demands of his job, his dad had seemed happy then. His blue eyes sparkled with accomplishment; his body was muscled and lean from long hours of exertion. John bragged to his friends about how his dad could lift his mum up off the floor and twirl her around like she was made of feathers.
“Jesus, Sherlock...I mean
John strains to hear more, but Greg and Sherlock step farther away. Greg voice raises a few times—  something about “close calls” and “stupid choices” when Mycroft clears his throat. He’s standing next to John and lingers near as the paramedic rechecks John’s blood pressure. How did he miss Mycroft? He’s like a damn stealth cat. Even as Mycroft squints down, John feels a bit like Mycroft’s prey.
————————-
"Why should we ever do what Mycroft wants and follow his direction in another one of his envelopes? Maybe we should never leave this island. Serve him right. We should make this sex holiday permanent," Sherlock grouses as he sits on their bed. He's holding a heaping bowl of
"All the work study arrangements have been made through Sebastian Moran," he said and licked his fingertips. "I haven't seen Moriarty again since I ran into him."
The sun comes up. I know the windows need cleaning. I can see streaks and shadows the light casts as it filters through. I caught Mrs. Hudson on her tip-toes standing up on one of her wooden kitchen chairs, washing them last Tuesday. I made her climb down and scolded her.
“I guess I need to start with Afghanistan.” He wipes his face with his hands and sits  down at the table. “At the time I attributed what happened to me to a combination of trauma and morphine. But it wasn’t. I died there, Sherlock. But it wasn’t my time, so they brought me back.”
“You move around the board to gather clues.” John continues to explain the rules, which William concludes are ridiculous. “You know,” John says, “you’ve never done that thing with me like the other hospital staff. Where you tell me what I am, what I did.”
“You keep calling me little brother, but it doesn’t feel complimentary,” Sherlock says, taking a seat on an old iron cafe chair.
“This John Watson is so sentimental. Look at this quilt. His grandmother pieced it together using remnants of John’s old clothes. I bet he cherishes it. Hmm. Maybe I should set it on fire. Or better, set John Watson on fire.”
“It seems he’s in need of medical attention.” she says, “but I’m afraid you’ve come too late.”
“Blackwood,” Sherlock says, “was a part of it.”
“Shut up!” she yells. “On your knees, all of you.”
Or maybe John has come to his senses and realizes that Sherlock
He wakes to a melancholy melody. Sherlock is playing the violin.
"Wait. Not the dildo."
Despite being angry, John seemed to have temporarily forgotten Sherlock’s butting in on the date as he watched Joe Pendleton’s exploits in
"Neither can I."
"Yer own stupidity got ya where you are. You had to jump from the roof and break the fall with yer arm.  Should have put that chip in yer head sooner. That won't happen again."
“Yeah, I know. I already wasted too many years by changing degrees.”
Now they were on an island together. No one there to know. No one there to judge. No one there but them.
The next morning, he wakes to knocking on the door and muffled voices. John staggers out in his old flannel bathrobe. With coffee in one hand, Sherlock stands next to the flat door in his old blue dressing gown and scrubs. A second later, John is jarred awake with a huge hug from the inspector.
“I can get us some coffee first to warm you up.”
“But the door was locked from the inside!”
Sherlock thrusts his coat into John’s arms, then kneels down to look under the benches. “It serves a purpose. Think John! In Lord Blackwood’s case, his death settled some sort score with her.”
"It is. So-o good. And I do have what you call the munchies. I smoked some cannabis with Wiggins not long ago."
“They are real, but they aren’t about you,” John told him.
“Would you like to go to a movie or something tomorrow night?”
Sister Katherine slips in next to her, spying at us over her spectacles. “It’s nice to know that there’s a place for even the Mr. Rude’s in the world. Fitting it’s in a morgue. No offense, Molly.”
And her hands, the tiny calluses on her fingers. From friction. A hand gun. John must have noticed. And she’d recently fired a rifle. She had a tiny bruise under her eye and not from trapshooting. Every movement and mannerism screamed she was not  American. Like Moriarty, she oozed genius. She’d dissected Sherlock methodically.
“More than likely.”
While they’re waiting at the bottom of the stairs, I pull out my mobile and call Mycroft. He owes me this for keeping information from me. Most of all he owes John.
, worked for MI5 and -6."
John cringed. He knew that insane laugher. He hated it with every atom inside him.
“He has a Santa hat,” Mycroft grumbles. “I would gladly trade him.”
. What does that even mean? Sounds threatening. Most likely one of Sherlock's bloody cryptic messages that he's supposed to figure out how to decode. He's not allowed on deck even though a heavy ocean swell pitches the ship and he's not convinced it won't capsize. He's seasick beyond caring that he'd drown. In fact, he's pretty sure that it would be a relief.
She sees the recognition in his eyes and takes his limp hand and shakes it. “Marilyn Rebeca Moriarty. Pleased to formally meet you at last. I only wish my brother could witness this. Me besting you instead of him.”
He moves stealthily around the outside of the house, keeping just out of the security lights’ reach. Behind boxwood bushes and ash trees, he looks for access back inside and finds a lone window propped open. He steps cautiously up, and he smells someone's burnt toast lingering in the kitchen.
“I guess we’re being excused then,” John says.
“It's not for you to be sorry about. It took a long time and therapy for me to realize that it wasn’t PTSD that I had— I just missed the war.
"Don't thank me. Do your job well. That's the thanks I want."
He cursed to himself as he zipped his jacket up to his chin. October was an unpredictable bitch. Rain spat down on him and the cold winds whipped and taunted him. Only a couple of hours ago, the sun was warming his cheeks, he was ridiculously happy and thought he might be in love. Now he had no umbrella, no hat, and a missing heart.
She’s wrong. Someone will come. However, his mind can’t recall why he believes it—
Sherlock hated waiting. It was only one step ahead of boring and another behind hot dogs.
"That a boy!" his dad would yelp and cheer when John hit a pop up. Harry played outfield. She'd squint into the sun and let half of the balls hit the ground, but she had a grand time collecting dandelions while waiting for a ball to come her way.
“Really. This could prove eventful.” John falls back on the bed with a giggle. He crooks his finger, motioning Sherlock to him.
Finally Sherlock understood why it was so distressing to John. He felt a pang of panic himself as he read. This could prove to be a most unfortunate turn. Sherlock knew that this might well be a major setback to his plan to get John out of the closet and into his bed. A scare like this would only push John deeper inside himself. This called for an immediate distraction on Sherlock's part. He picked up the new deck of cards and opened them.
“Even if true a person loving one’s own brother is not defining characteristic or distinctive in anyway.”
“Yes. I know.” Over John’s conversations over the last two days, John realizes that Will does all he can to push most people away. It’s like he wants people to hate him. Other the other hand, John seems to be the exception. At least that’s what Beca picked up on in her conversation with Will.
Sherlock’s long fingers dig around the chest, then pull the chest out of the sand and set it between them. The wood has blackened, iron bands rusted, the small padlock hangs with sand in its keyhole.
“I’ve already said as much on numerous occasions. Do keep up,” Sherlock says. He looks all around him.
When the man appeared, John followed with caution. Despite the suspect’s odd appearance, John judged him a dangerous man. John’s uncanny skill at detecting threats while remaining undetected is unmatched. Camouflage is John’s mien. His oatmeal sweaters and checkered shirts make him invisible to most. He seems a common man, but hidden beneath those clothes resides the sage healer, the compassionate captain, and the unrelenting warrior.
“Good.” William remains staring down. “You weren’t sleeping well.”
"Yeah, I guess we're two right idiots." He places a hand over Sherlock's.
"Sex. Intercourse. I would like to have it someday. With you. Soon."
“That’s not what I hear, dear brother. I was told you’ve learned to fish.”
———--
"It must be. Reading the book last night was very strange. It was like it was about me. But I'm less sure of what I know about myself than I did before. Though it explains the constant dreams of the sea."
Sherlock's mouth was close to mine, almost touching.
“Mycroft.”
“I don’t see why she didn’t send something more personal,” John says.
"Magnussen effectively threatened his life. I won't risk losing John."
. Gave him a secret message. Left to save him. Maybe he’s asking himself the wrong question: How could John not love him?
Before they'd actually had sex, all he wanted was to bend Sherlock over give it to him. Well, now that he'd had actual sex with Sherlock, he wanted it again. And again. And again.
Sherlock thinks that fairly good admission of guilt that he has more than just some of his memory back, but she’s not following that line of thought. Sophy is off somewhere else.
John nods with a deep frown. I’ve said the wrong thing. I hadn’t meant to bring that up.
While Sherlock appreciates John’s blushing, he can’t help be frustrated at how John can be so obtuse at times. How does John not understand that Sherlock’s comment was a hint? Sherlock would love to make lots of interesting things happen in this room and in John’s bed. He was so sure that John was interested in a sexual relationship.
“Oh, Sophy! I’m surprised at you! It’s
“I think the soup is burning,” John said.
He searches through her room anyway, but finds nothing that she didn’t plant for him to see. No secret panels, nothing behind pictures, paintings, or bookshelves. He does, however, learn what motivates Miss Sophy Kratides as he looks through her dresser.
I clamp my mouth tight to keep myself from screaming.
“That’s tomorrow. On Christmas. Keep the antlers on! I do like you both as reindeer!” his mum says.
“Mycroft? No, Sophy. I remember. John. I…”
John studied Mary closer, remembering Sherlock’s words to observe. She was dressed differently than most students here. Sure, she had on jeans and a sweater, but the jeans were neat, and looked new and her sweater newer. Even her tennis shoes were unscuffed except for a small grass stain on the side; they looked like she just bought them. Her nails were short, with neutral beige polish chipped in the center of some of the nails. Where she held the mug, she had a small callus on her thumb. Looking at her again, he realized she was possibly older than what she first appeared—maybe in her late twenties, possibly early thirties.
I never particularly liked Morris Albert’s ear worm of a song “Feelings,” but I admit that it has penetrated my brain far too often over the years. Psychologists have analyzed what makes these songs stick in our heads. Here’s an explanation.
As he eyes his brother warily, he detests the fact that Sherlock’s superior mind doesn’t understand Mycroft as well as one brother should understand another. Sherlock recalls much of their childhood together, and later at uni when Mycroft “helped” Sherlock through his addictions. Watching the Mycroft sitting in his chair, Sherlock understands less and less of Mycroft’s motives. Does he help Sherlock out of obligation, to save face with his peers? Or because he genuinely cares? Why does he help him now? Is he helping Sherlock or helping himself? Sherlock wonders who his brother really is and what he represents.
Sherlock stopped at what students referred to as "the Party Store" to buy a few foodstuffs. More of the Pringles, cigarettes, a loaf of the horrible American bread that John seemed to like, along with a jar of peanut butter and a deck of cards.
“Time for me to start rounds, I’ll be back.” Mike waves as he heads out the door. The man watches John from the bed, faint tension lines of pain around his eyes and mouth. John thinks he looks rather confident for being injured, tied to an IV, and alone with a man who chased him across a rooftop. Good, maybe he’ll feel like answering questions.
It was dark inside the cabin—only flickers from the fireplace illuminated the room, sending Sherlock’s long shadow across the pine planks of the floor. He moved the rocker closer to the fire, then walked over to the kitchen window where he stood watch. He frowned as he peered through the slats.
“Really?”
Now, he wants to explore the limits of his desire, and that desire centers around John Watson. What might John’s calloused, compassionate hands feel like? Sherlock relishes this as he takes his own cock in hand and strokes the length with his long fingers. How might John’s mouth feel? How would those lips look around Sherlock’s cock? How would it feel to have John breech him, take him, fill him with his perfect cock?
“He took them off because there were none of these to he had.”
“Don’t you worry, Mrs. Hudson, I know where he is,” he reassures her. “And I’m going to find him— just need to get a few things upstairs.” John starts up the stairs, but turns to her after two steps. “If anyone comes looking for me, you haven’t seen me.”
"Actually, the lyrics are 'baby let's pretend we could always be together.'"
"The past few hours, Dr. Watson. But he's been stinkin' like that fer a few days."
,’ yet I can’t access it.”
“I shouldn’t have to point out that helping your brother didn’t work out so well for you last time,” John says.
Nothing. Mycroft must have sent her to spy on Sherlock.
John slaps Sherlock's bum as he stands.
John smiled. Any other time he would have flipped over a hot girl handing him her number. He thought of all the possible reasons why he wasn’t happy about it as the elevator door opened.
Her hand seems so small and insignificant in Sherlock’s, yet the gentle strokes from her thumb have the power to still her son’s troubled mind.
She turned around and faced John. She was about his height in her sneakers, and her blue eyes flickered in the moonlight.
Sherlock lips curled up in a wicked smile as he leaned in, a breath away from John's mouth.
made public! How did you do this?”
Marilyn Frankenstein referenced her note again. "Also in the freezer. Come, I'll show you." She stepped across the floor between pools of blood and gore. Sherlock and I followed.
John didn’t want to go out there any more than Sherlock did, but they couldn’t leave them to die. Sherlock may say he doesn’t care now, but guilt was insidious. He would regret his actions one day. Maybe not in months or weeks, but years.
“Some alchemist.”
"Yeah." He wants to say it's Sherlock who is magnificent. He almost does.
“You checked on me last night,” Will says. “Thank you.” The word sounds as if it’s foreign to Will, which makes John a bit sad. It also makes him wonder what he remembered. He wants to help him find out who he is. Make life manageable. He's not sure how he's going to do it, but he thinks he's the one to try.
"You can throw yourself against that door all you wish, but you aren't going to break it down. And shouting will not bring her back. She's not going to open it."
He hadn't been quick enough.
“Your name is worth remembering.”
Sherlock does remember how much he loved his sister. And that she loved him. He knows she did. She was confused and confined. She never had a mind palace. Maybe if she’d had a place to store all her thoughts she wouldn’t have burned it all down.
"Odd? In what way?" Sherlock had asked.
I reach the top, pull out the books, open the panel, but the arcanum, the locked chest it was within, is now gone.
William nods. “Many times. I recognize the symptoms and treat them,” he answers.
He knows it’s true. He sees it in Molly’s face.
“Watch me Papa,” she says and makes one of her silly faces and sticks out her tongue.
I gave him a wink.
“It’s adequate,” Sherlock says as they continue down the causeway. “If lucky, you can find artifacts on the beach. The tricky tides and narrow access has caused many shipwrecks over the centuries.”
“It was perfect,” John whispers. “Having us there. You, the great detective; your brother, the British government. And me. Hard to keep that type of thing from a doctor, although you did it without Eurus.” I flinch as he says this bitterly.
. She wanted to be Laura Ingalls."
“Right then. I’ll get you discharged. My shift ends in an hour.” He turns to leave, then thinks twice. “You should know that Mrs. Hudson, our landlady, often walks in without knocking. Also I have nightmares. Sometimes I scream and break— things. Lamps and such.“
Anthea taps her fingers on the seat. The train is almost to Paddington Station. From there, they’re to go somewhere by car into the London countryside where Sherlock’s supposed family home resides.
love in return.
. Sherlock's riddle! He picks it up and reads the back cover:
“That would be great,” John said.
I say, “
Thomas shakes his head. John understands the paramedic's frustration, but his concerns run toward Sherlock not Sophy. Through his haze, John recalls their mum’s words. How Sherlock blocked Eurus from his memory. How Eurus burned the family home, did it as they slept. She tried to kill them all. What effect is listening to all this having on Sherlock?
“Sophy. I’ve given you a gift. Please take him. But you are missing the best gift of all. Someone you want more anyone, even me. He’s just outside these very doors.”
As John rights himself racing around a skip, he changes his mind: the man isn’t a gazelle— he’s a spider monkey. The man leaps up and over the skip, then catches the fire escape ladder and swings up with the same effort John uses to step up onto a curb. John leaps too, but when he catches, agonizing pain shoots into his shoulder. But he doesn’t let go of the ladder. He dangles and catches his breath. He bites his lip with the determination of a bulldog and follows the large feet rung by rung up all five stories. All these weeks John staked out to catch this man, wondering who he is. Now he wonders what he is. A demon or an angel?
“He’s a bit abrasive, but he also has this charm about him, don’t you think?” Molly says, smiling brightly at John.
Sherlock continues to take his time. First frotting, then preparing John with long, wet fingers, until finally, finally, he pushes inside.
John frowned and did an about-face, and was about to forward march back out the door.
“Especially not those duckies,” I say. “They won’t fit in the tub.”
It’s like a blinding light goes off inside his head. Pain shoots through his skull, but he keeps himself passionless, stiff, and blank. “The game,” he repeats.
John stays on the edge of the makeshift mattress, and he closes his eyes. It’s all innocent. Sherlock just offered a place to rest, is all. He dozes off listening to Sherlock’s steady breathing.
He laughs in my face and pulls my hair. The stench of his breath forces me to struggle to turn my head. He yanks my hair harder and spits in my face.
she asks — then I’ll answer. And that's
Thank you. We'd love to know what you think of the ending and story.
“Leave with him,” Sherlock said.
Mycroft cringes.
John bursts out laughing. “What?! No! You're not a serial killer any more than you are a psychic.” John sucks in a deep breath, lets it whistle out. He knows Will is missing something, and so is he. “What about this as an explanation? You're in some profession where you face death. You don't know that you're not a doctor. All doctors are taught to be detached. Seeing death every day, you have to be. It comes at you in other ways.  Nightmares.”
He blinks and shades his eyes with his hand. It's so bright that it takes him a few minutes to adjust. After the musty air belowdecks, the humid, warm breeze is welcome. It's steady but languid and carries with it fragrances of plants strange to him. And iodine. He's not sure why he smells iodine mixed into the general low tide sort of smell of the water's edge.
A part of me hopes I’m wrong, that my brother would not do this to my sister. Another part of me understands why he would. John is correct. She is dangerous. She knows that she’s done harm, but does she understand? Is that why she would retreat into herself? We assume she had no guilt, no sense of right or wrong. But that may have changed. Or maybe we were being fooled yet again.
“Don’t even start.”
"What?" John pushed his books aside and moved to the edge of the bed. "No. You're certain? I mean, he didn't seem the type."
“Since you came into my life, I no longer feel that way.” Yes, his cheeks continue to warm, but a part of him welcomes it.
Sherlock snaps his hips.
Until this dream, my nightmare has never deviated. This time it changes. I am not back on the path alone without my father--instead, I am still in the cave.
Despite his words, Moriarty's voice was hungry. Looking back much later, Sherlock recognized that his tone was not at all like Sherlock's detached demeanor at a crime scene.
Except … he was no longer in a bean bag chair, and there was no Snoopy banner hanging on the wall, but there was Mary. Why was he in Mary’s dorm room with Sebastian Moran? Oh, yeah. He was drugged.
It was almost nine-thirty, and John still wasn’t back. The soup was cold, but Sherlock could warm it up fast.
"I'll give ya one more shot at it. Change this ta gold."
"There's something else. I don't know if it was by choice or not, but I get the feeling you've been pretty much alone in all this until now," John said.
I blinked at him and recalled John’s words.
And what ate at John most was Sherlock’s obsession with Moriarty.
I climbed to my feet and reached for Sherlock's hand.
Bolts of lightning shoot from the orb. The chimeras are no more. In a fraction of a second, my world blows apart as well. My arm is ripped from my body. Gory shreds of my mangled flesh and bone are sprayed across the cave walls and are mingled with the remains of the chimeras. All that is left on my arm is the jagged bone of my humerus above the radial groove.
"Late night?" Professor Doyle asked.
Mrs. Hudson answers, half awake and completely annoyed. With no real finesse, he asks Mrs. Hudson where John is.
Sherlock picked up one of the traps and carried it up to the rocking chair near the fire. The traps were older and rusty, but well-oiled. Sherlock pried open the trap’s jaws. It took a bit of hand strength and would be much easier to set using a foot. The springs were taut, but it wasn’t that difficult to wrap the chain around it to set the trap. The center was a circular flat pan. When an animal stepped on it, the trap was sprung and clamped around the animal’s leg. Probably some larger fur-bearing creature such as the beautiful fox he’d seen. The person who set them intended to capture them for the fur. As Sherlock turned the trap in his hands, he couldn’t help imagining that these were means to a gruesome end. The animals snared would endure a painful and panic-filled wait until they died of either exhaustion, blood loss, or hypothermia. If any were still living when found, Sherlock doubted its end would be any easier—possibly clubbed to death by the trapper. He was happy that he hadn’t found any animals in the traps himself.
Moran reached behind and pulled his gun out of his belt and let it rest on John’s temple. John knew he should be nervous or upset. Instead he felt angry. Never a cruel person, John was surprised that he had a satisfying vision of ripping off Moran’s arms and legs like wings off flies.
He'd done it.
“She was impressed with you. She said we should hire you.”
"I'm staying up for a bit, I need to think about something else." Will lets John check his eyes and reflexes.
His eyes go to an old stuffed bear, toy pirate sword and hat along with a magnifying glass set in a cherished space on a well-used walnut writing desk. Next to the bed against the wall rests a violin case. A large mahogany bookcase lines the wall parallel to it.
It explained his muddy dreams. No coincidence then that when he finally was able to pry his eyes open, Sherlock had somehow transformed into Sebastian Moran.
“Carolyn told me Mary gave her mother the gun,” John says. “I still find it hard to believe. If that’s true, Mary would have checked the gun and seen that there were live rounds in it.”
Sherlock opens the envelope. A flash drive falls out into his palm. He pulls out some papers.
"Dick and Jane and Go Dog Go."
Sherlock gazes at the amazing man he loves.
John gasps as Sherlock pulls him in for another knee-trembling kiss.
That’s all it takes. Relationship confirmed as Eyebrows grabs Sherlock’s shirt and begins to drag him into the front seat.
He clears his throat and looks directly at Sherlock, ignoring John, who is becoming angrier by the second.
John sleeps fitfully slumped down in an old chair next to the bed, which gives him time to observe this man. He’s handsome in an unconventional way. His jaw too long, mouth too large, cheekbones too pronounced. When open, his eyes were ghostly color of green and blue. His lips thick and bowed. Hair a wild mass of curls. His large hands like that of a surgeon with tapered fingers and the long, large palms of a psychic. His feet just as big and toes just as long. He looks alien and beautiful. John makes a lot of guesses watching the man on the bed.
Sherlock laughs, and it's bright and playful. "My John. My John, forever."
“He said you’d be suspicious,” she said. “He told me to tell you this: ‘Don’t be angry. He will make it up to you. He said that he’ll make you Cambell’s tomato soup served with Ritz crackers, but this time he’d make sure not to burn his hand.”
One more deep thrust, and John spurts out, adding to the sticky mess that’s already on his tummy.
"Please, Captain Watson. Let's pretend."
“If you’re sure? I wouldn’t mind. I hope it doesn’t have to do with James. He mentioned something about knowing your roommate.”
Molly turns on the radio and tunes it to oldies, although Sherlock wonders what the term oldies actually means. Shouldn’t oldies be classical composers like Chopin not something called the Rolling Stones?
“John, you’re brilliant! I do like that one,” Sherlock adds with a smirk in his voice. It’s a photo of Mycroft in a fuzzy pink footie pajamas surrounded with crumpled up wrapping paper and a host of colorful ribbons and bows.
"Remove your pants, captain," Sherlock orders in his deepest baritone.
"Good. Take this address and phone number. They're for my research assistant." The professor handed John the note.
“That might not be so easy. He wants to take John and Ms. Kradites to London! Some  private, posh hospital— as if Cardiff Royal Infirmary isn’t good enough,” Greg says.
Will worries he’s upset him. He knew it was a bad idea! John sits back across from Will and continues the game. He doesn’t act angry. Just a bit sad. He picks up the dice and throws, but he’s quiet. Will thinks he kept a lot to himself that he could have revealed. But he didn’t. He’s glad to know these things just the same. That John came to Cardiff to forget, yet he keeps mementos all around him so that he won’t. That Mary liked lilies; she kept them in the vase on that very same table, the water ring beneath. That there are days when John puts his service revolver to his head. He saw a few blond and grey hairs in the hammer, but he hasn’t pulled the trigger because there are people who still need him. People like Will. Finally, that John keeps a journal on his laptop to help him cope. It’s open, and at a glance, he’d read the page. It’s about him, and for some strange reason, it makes Will glad.
“John!” he gasps. “I had an incredible dream! Mycroft was there. We were on board a ship together, and we were hiding in apple barrels just like Jim Hawkins! I overheard plans to mutiny the Hispaniola and get Captain Flint’s treasure! I think my subconscious might be telling me something.”
“There’s not much here. Some worn old furniture. Old pictures. Old carpet. Books.”
“She would have the perfect use for John,” Sherlock says, “but it may mean putting John in harm’s way.”
John was shocked at how agitated Sherlock had suddenly become. Cards scattered as Sherlock fell backward. He lurched up and smacked his head against a wooden slat on the bottom of the bunk bed.
John lifts one hand to cup Sherlock's face and kisses the bridge of his nose. There's a particular freckle there that he suddenly finds enchanting. John laughs. Now, he's pining over cherry-brown spots on his nose.
“John, please. We will.”
Sherlock eyes follow John's hand as he rests it on top of Sherlock's knee.
Sophy is the connection. Not surprising she turned up the same time all the bodies did. But is she the actual murderer or is it someone else in her circle?
He was not happy. He spat at John between shivers. John was disappointed it wasn’t Moran—just some hired henchman of Moriarty’s.
“You think Sherlock discovered the marker it targeted,” John says.
“Yes. Once.”
Normally, John would laugh. Instead, John sighs and turns to me. “We need a bite.”
“How was your date with our Mary Morstan?” James asked, tapping the pen against his cheek.
I nod and begin. “While you were abducted from a costume birthday party, you did indeed know those who abducted you. In fact, it was the same men who have been blackmailing you over the last six months.”
Sherlock picks up his book, bear, and magnifying glass, shoving them in the abyss of a coat. The cat follows at their heels. After a few blocks, Sherlock picks the wayward cat up and carries him.
Although my eyes aren’t open, I know he did as I asked. I am not in hospital. The kind doctor cools my forehead with a flannel. I can think. I slowly open my eyes.
"I really need to make an appearance. We should be off."
Directly in front of them was an acupuncturist, out for the evening with the wife. Although he’s cheating on her—no it’s an open marriage—they have two children, approximately ages three and five. Also a white angora cat.
She gives him the iciest smile. Not for the first time, looking at Sophy Kratides, he thinks she’s a bit touched.
because it was the first station to accurately predict this storm's intensity.
Before they lowered him into the ground, I crushed the red rose petals and sprinkled them over John’s coffin. I waited until almost everyone was gone and bowed my head. Those left thought I was praying. I wasn’t. I was asking John the same thing he’d asked me after I jumped. I was asking him not to be dead.
“Ah, if you didn’t notice, you’re bloody brilliant. I guess you could call our director a bit of a maverick. She saw something in you and thought you’re worth the change. Beca’s rather unconventional in her approach to running the hospital, but it works.”
“You bloody well better tell me now. I won’t have you keeping secrets again.”
Will grunts in reply as he marks another spot. John returns to his novel and watches Will out of the corner of his eye. His phone beeps with a text from Lestrade.
John smirks into his hand.
Thank you to those who responded on AO3 and Tumblr. We are grateful for the Kudos and comments and applaud all of you in return. Johnlock has some of the best fans of all. I can’t list everyone who commented but these six fans left comments on almost every chapter:  jobooksncoffee, itsneverjustheartdisease, 1butterfly_grl1, ylc, hubblegleeflower, and Purrfectlmt.
“He’s not ordinary.”
"How can I not tell? You never get those squinty, bloodshot eyes like most people or reek of pot. In fact, I never smell it on you."
“Aye, matie! Whatever you ask,” John says.
Greg's mouth twists. "Can't really comment on an open investigation."
“Let you go? In this case, not go through with Mary faking her courageous death scene,” I say. “You speak as if you gave Mary a choice between betraying you and life, and she chose betraying you. That is not what happened.”
"No one works for nothing."
“Why, yes, quite ready for it to end. And no, I don’t have surgeries scheduled on Sundays unless there’s an emergency.”
"Why are you asking about my gun?"
“I don’t understand why he stayed there. He wasn’t all that interested in the movie until the end. It couldn’t be comfortable sitting there with us.”
John’s already made coffee. I get out of bed and pad out of my room. Rosie is eating breakfast and kicking the booster seat
Getting ready for his early morning Psychology class, John kicked himself for staying up so late the night before. The dreams he'd had were worse. God, he was having sex in them with his roommate. How could he look him in the eye again after that?
They prepare tea and toast in silence. It’s almost domestic. So normal. Yet this man who sits across from him who is anything but normal.
“Probably worse in some parts of London. We were fortunate that part of the Yard was still with us. Our business lost most of our people, but we still had enough necessary to keep secure.”
“I think I’ll take you up on your offer as a test,” she says to Sherlock.
John took another bite. Sherlock narrowed his eyes and swore to himself he would end up dying from priapism.
Norbury and his accomplice drag me out of the boot and slam me on the pavement. I manage to save my face from hitting the ground, but my bloody palms pay the price. I'll be pulling bits of gravel from under my skin later. Norbury rolls me onto my back with his foot.
bruise,” Mycroft says, touching his cheek.
“I think I sustained a fairly severe head injury. I just happened to ‘collapse,’ you say? Nobody ‘helped’? Checking what I remember to get your story straight?” He reaches for the call button.
John wants to make sure he doesn't do something as humiliating as passing out again. He's conscious that Sherlock is monitoring the kiss as he cautiously parts John's lips with the tip of his tongue. John's moan of approval brings Sherlock's mouth completely over John's. If he needs to revive John, he's ready.
Sorry for posting so late in the day. Beware! High angst inside. :)
He had driven to the service area—or what Americans called a rest area—a few days later. He'd got the message to hook up from the stall wall and a leaking biro for his trouble.
“Don’t you go expecting me to do this every night,” she says, taking the empty tray downstairs.
“I sure am, thanks to you. Nice to have a soft place to lay my head and a full belly. It wasn’t hard to convince some of the boys to help after your generosity. Greasing the palms never hurts either. That brother of yours must have some deep pockets.”
William doesn’t think it’s brilliant, but the he thinks way John licks his lips is. He could make a pass, but he decides he likes John too much to try. He made John sad for a bit. No need to make him uncomfortable too. He says goodnight and climbs the stairs. Will stares at his new ceiling. It’s free of cobwebs, and there’s no candle to cast long shadows, only the moonlight shining in his window. He rather likes the moonlight and decides not to pull the shades. No need for a light with the moon so bright. It’s looking at him, smiling down from way up there.
“Just knowing you’re still alive eases my soul. And don’t think I am not going to make you sit down with me and explain what’s happening.”
“What did you have for dinner? I had to eat tuna, beans, and peaches from cans.”
Sherlock thought it had worked. No more bodies, and the killing spree ended. When he'd come to the United States, he thought it might be over—that Moriarty had gone on to his next obsession.
Not long after, Sherlock looks up to see John stepping from the bath freshly shaved with a towel around his waist, empty mug in hand, skin and all golden and glorious. As John pours another mug, Sherlock checks the status of a blog he’s monitoring.
“There’s always some detail I miss.”
John wasn’t surprised that he'd been leaning against the door, listening in.
"I did."
"Drink this," he says, giving John a sip of water. He takes a drink, then closes his eyes to drift off to swabbing salve on Sherlock's freckled arms.
“You have no choice.” Norbury barks out a laugh. “Shovel in some of the damn concrete. Thank god it’s fast drying. I don’t know how long I could stand to listen to your arrogant mouth.”
they are,
The initial message John writes is easy to read through the glass of the bottle. The words are printed neatly with the nub of a pencil he'd found:
Well, there'll be no hope of getting off this island unless he suddenly becomes some sort of mechanical genius or learns to sail. He wonders when Sherlock plans to show up. Is he already here? When will he arrive? How? What will John do when he finally faces his kidnapper?
“John, I know it must be awful getting robbed and shot, then on top of it all, losing your roommate. But you’ve got friends who care.”
“That’s right. But I wasn’t certain it was you,” Sherlock said. He stepped over to the dresser where the soup was warming. “The first few days, I wondered. It was this that made me certain.” Instead of checking the soup, Sherlock opened his underwear drawer and reached into the bottom. “Here, these belong to you.”
“Why did he take off his shoes?” John asks, curious. “He could have done the same.”
He and Mycroft and their father searched and searched and searched. Sherlock's throat ached but he kept on calling. He blamed himself for not taking proper precautions. He should have had Redbeard on his leash. He shouldn't have become distracted. His greatest fear was that Redbeard had fallen off the cliff near the lighthouse, into the ocean to drown.
“What did you give him?!” John screams again. She laughs, spitting in his face as she does.
He could still see that one morning during his second week of school when his teacher told his mum that there was a problem: Sherlock refused to color inside the lines.
“Are you alright? I don’t know you well, but you do seem a bit on edge.”
More was splattered against one wall of the kitchen and across the cupboards. On the chopping block, bits of flesh and bone coated the top and dripped over onto the floor. A large blood-covered cleaver rested in the center. Sherlock ignored that, instead dropping to his hands and knees to inspect the floor.
Sherlock decided to put the bottle of Jack Daniels to good use. He unscrewed the phone’s mouth and earpiece, then took them to the sink and doused them in the whiskey. After that he wiped down the rest of the handset with his saturated handkerchief.
“Or it could jog his memory,” John suggests.
Sherlock picked up the shopping bag and slipped around the desk, pulling the contents out and on to the desk as he skimmed the article.
John shifted his old Camaro into reverse and sped away.
never even wanted to speak to me before," John replies. "Now she's messing with me."
“Sherlock. That’s an unusual name.”
John gets a pained glare in return. “Is any of this relevant to getting me pain medication?”
“I’m sorry, neither of them are coming in today—meetings of some sort to attend. Anything you’d like me to pass on?”
"Why? Do you know him?" he asked. "If that's the case, then it really is a small world."
“Certainly a woman of such impeccable taste would not want such a vile creature around her person.”
“I’d love to, John.”
As John climbs down the companionway ladder, he surveys his new surroundings. So much better than the dark dungeon he was in. On the port side he walks through an adequate galley with a two-burner propane stove, what looks like a fridge lid, and a decent-sized sink with hand-pump. The galley is well-stocked. John digs around and finds canned goods in the bilge along with tins and jars. Not one can has a label. The contents of each ziplock baggie and rust-spotted can are hand-labeled in permanent marker. In French. Frustration ahoy!
like it’s an order. John was an army captain. He takes charge. It all feels so familiar.
The once polished concrete is pitted and covered in dust and grime from disuse with clear, recent footprints. He counts them. Sophy brought an impressive number of men just to catch Sherlock.
“But you do. You care for John Watson.”
He hears John talking to Mike. And someone else. Sherlock steps out into the living room to see all three men at the door.
“You must have read it over and over as a child. I read
Sherlock had the irresistible urge to hug him. He knew it was entirely possible that John might lash back, but he hugged him anyway.
Sorry that it’s been a day or two since my last entry. Life has been seriously busy, and Sherlock is back in his room upstairs! Sherlock, the madman, has been getting himself and our new feline flatmate, Blackbeard, acclimated to 221b.
This is an example of a character in the story taking ahold of the author and leading them down a different path than intended. From the story’s conception (which was long ago and far, far away), I’d always intended for the reveal to John to be the turning point of the story. I’d even thought of ways that John might uncover it then, confront Sherlock. Even as John carried the envelope back, I intended for Sherlock to keep his mouth shut about it. Imagine my surprise, when Sherlock gets a mind of his own and blurts out at the end of this chapter, “The other man in the photo is me." I almost deleted it, then I realized that this was the best possible plot turn for the story and gave me an entirely new avenue to explore.
Will helps John with the crates from the trunk and sets them outside of the garage of his new home. “I promised Mike I’d lock it up for the night and keep it safe.” They both have a laugh. After what happened, it seems silly. “Mrs. Hudson keeps hers here, and it’s never been touched.” John snaps the bolt lock shut.
"I do."
"Well, yeah, you do that. I want a living roommate. I hate to have to get another." John pulled his backpack next to him. "I hate to leave like this, but I got to get to class. I think you have one too, or aren't you going to that again today?"
“Yes.
Mike is more shocked than Sherlock. “Yer giving Sherlock a rose? And I don’t get one?!” Mike hangs his head in mock despair. “I'm heart broken! You’ve known me longer!”
He loves me. John loves
"Anything for me?" John says bitterly. "Where'd this bloody bottled water come from? I ran out days ago and have had to boil that mosquito soup from the tank ashore in this fucking heat. What are you talking about, anything for me? What the hell does that even mean to you? And couldn't you at least have left me some sunglasses?"
Sherlock stood. “Despite being formulaic, the movie was surprisingly entertaining,” Sherlock said, brushing the popcorn kernels off his trousers.
The label on the prescription bottle for the mysterious itching was proof positive.
I tried it and my heart turned out pretty well.
When would he realize Sherlock found his condoms and lube? John was most likely tired and hadn't even realized he'd left his capo and pick on the bed, but he might notice that his electric guitar case had been moved and figure it out then. Or it could happen later, when John went to play his regular guitar and wouldn't be able to find them. Maybe he'd ask Sherlock if he'd seen them.
