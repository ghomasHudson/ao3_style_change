“But why does he leave the sign if he’s trying to throw us off? And doesn’t a murderer always have a motive?”
All of this explains why he lets Stamford buy him a cup of coffee, and why he sits down on the bench next to him and unloads a small part of his trouble. Everyone understands money trouble, and it usually has the effect of distancing people from him. Maybe Mike will leave if he asks him for a loan, and then this awkward conversation can be over.
He wants this opportunity very much.
“Why would he do that?“
“If I find him, I can prove both things.”
He does look then, beginning to understand. The scars are old, but still obvious. Inside his elbows there are dark marks, at least a few years old, purplish-brown against the paleness of his skin. They will fade with time, but skin remembers. He will always know they are there.
psychosomatic.
“Faked— it?”
They walked out together. “They’re using the segment tomorrow night,” said Lestrade. “How many rumours do you think we’ll see popping up on social media?”
I shrug. I did have an appointment with Ella, but she kept pushing me in the wrong direction.
“Divorce papers have been filed.” Mycroft adds sugar to his tea and stirs. “If he needs any representation, let me know.”
“Nice.” It was a bad taste in his mouth. “Lestrade seems to think I’m such a gifted actor that I could convincingly fake niceness and make people like me.”
Warning: Bullying; minor character death.
Doctor Gurung can find nothing wrong with John. She asks him about the
I felt Watson’s hand on mine then, and opened my eyes to see him looking at me with concern. “All right?” he whispered.
): Well! I confess that you are an unemotional machine!
He meets her eyes. No smile, but he nods.
“No.” Sherlock doesn’t look up.
instead of whatever word they’d agreed was appropriate, but the audience just laughed. It felt good. They were having fun.
. Over the course of the filming, it was obvious that John was unhappy.”
“You were an addict?” It’s hard to picture the man sitting opposite him, a man with so many advantages, as a junkie. He has money, family, intelligence. He’s good-looking in an odd, striking way. He’s interesting, even compelling. Brilliant at many things. The kind of person you might meet once in your life. “How did that happen?”
“The person I sleep with every night, with whom I have sex, just introduced me to his ex as if I were someone he shares the rent with, not a bed. How am I supposed to react? I don’t go around announcing my orientation, but I would not hesitate to tell anyone that you’re my lover.”
It was actually the ideal place to commit suicide, if you wanted to tamp down speculation. Had John known this when he planned his trip there?
Matt gives him another brilliant smile. “Nice to meet you, John. So, am I making a ridiculous assumption, or could you use a night out?”
He feels his eyes practically bugging out of his head and wishes there were someone else here to confirm that Sherlock Holmes is a complete lunatic.
“You’ve said. I’m not sure you can reach any conclusions about yourself from her experience, though. And it isn’t
“We were never friends,” Sherlock replied. “Off set, we barely spoke.”
He was keeping his composure fairly well, he thought. He would not give this woman the satisfaction of flustering him.
They warn him that Sherlock is a sociopath, but John puts that down to jealousy. They seem surprised that John would still be with him. And Sherlock has now disappeared, leaving him behind.
“No, absolutely not.” Sherlock set down his glass.
He looks up. “Why does everybody want me to be gay?”
John waits, listening to Mary’s phone ring. When he hears her pick up, he doesn’t waste time on greetings. “What happened?”
Fine, they’re not friends. But Watson doesn’t have it in his heart to hate Holmes anymore.
The cab had stopped and the driver was waiting. As he reached in his pocket for cash, he realised that the driver hadn’t spoken at all, not through the entire trip. Some cabbies were like that, while other chattered away, regardless of whether you replied or not. He looked up and saw a pair of dark eyes watching him in the rearview mirror.
That seems like a lot of work. He doesn’t want to talk to Harry when he needs to figure out where he lives. He’ll call her tomorrow, if he remembers.
“Calm yourself. Sixty seconds, Sherlock. Deep breath. It’ll be fine. You’re a pro, and you know what to do.”
Once the inspector was gone, Holmes chuckled. “You have a great gift of silence, Watson. I had expected to you give the game away before I had my tale told.”
The John Watson I saw that night at the Landmark was a different man from the one I left when I stepped off the roof at Barts. I hadn’t known this Watson before, the one who thought he looked good in a moustache, who was wearing an actual suit for what was obviously a date, who was about to have dinner in a restaurant that had a wine list. My John never let the stubble grow, even on his day off, and never thought of growing a moustache. He didn’t like suits, would put on a tie and jacket over the same checked shirt he wore to work if he had a date, and would rather order a beer than decipher a wine list.
“I know about sex,” she said, pulling her feet up onto John’s chair. “We studied sexual orientation in health. But they wouldn't tell us how boys have sex with each other. Actually they didn’t tell us much that was useful. Stuff about condoms and herpes and HIV. Boring. But my friend Jason told me how boys have sex. He said—”
Mr Grimshaw looked down at me from his lofty height. “Would you like to go to school, Master William?”
The appointment with Dr Eccles is at five, but John already been thinking about what they’ll discuss. Ordinarily the idea of visiting a therapist makes him uncomfortable, actually embarrasses him, but now he really needs someone impartial to share with, to help him figure out this whole mess. Sherlock has been distant, even icy since the last time they had sex— or tried to. He flushes with humiliation just thinking about it. He never realised that there were so many ways to fail at being gay. He hasn’t had years to adjust to his sexual orientation; he’s only had a couple of months since he even acknowledged that his feelings might be more than just fantasy. And Sherlock is no more inclined to discuss such things than John is.
it, it's fine. It's
"Yeah, you just go ahead, I'll wait out here. Not my kind of place." He explained, letting go of Sherlock's hand.
"You didn't complain when I got you that dodo skull for your birthday," John shrugged, boldly going to sit on the detective's pristine bed and hopefully offering forth his cracker once more.
Shaun groaned when John's hand finally slid from his body and John immediately checked to see he was fine. When he was sure he was, he slicked between Shaun's thighs, gently fingering his largely dilated hole while he started fucking his thighs in short, quick bursts.
could." John murmured, eyes raking over Sherlock's skin, lips tightening as he took in the marks that bastard had left on his pale skin earlier.
Shifting up the man’s expensive shirt a little, Sherlock caught a glimpse of another tattoo. Feigning ignorance, he ran a long hand over the Latin script. "That's pretty. What does it mean?"
Shaun rocked back against John, his hand a blur at his own groin. "Oh, god yeah. God...like that. D-do it like that."
"Prat." John grinned, pulling back to undo his fly....and then pausing. "Um...Sherlock?"
Sherlock rolled off of his doctor obediently, eyes lightly closed, his damp body limp, and a silly smile on his sculptured face.
Sherlock wasn’t really wired to suffer nudity-related embarrassment, so he just sat up and took stock of himself, after tiredly folding the oatmeal jumper and re-housing it under his pillows. If nothing else, he had discovered some fairly interesting facts regarding repeated onanism and corresponding semen output.
"I think I'm gonna have to...you know. Stop all this."
John hollowed his cheeks, sucking back on Sherlock's cock, causing him to spasm on the bed, pushing his hips up greedily into John's mouth. Pleasure zinged through his body, up his spine, clouded his head and made it hard to think.
“…Not quite.” Sherlock took a fortifying breath, staring stoically ahead, and took John’s pleasantly-warm, smaller hand in his own. He let the breath out in a shaky exhale, gnawing on the inside of his bottom lip.
“What proof do you have?” Gregson demanded.
“We are,” said Greg. “I mean, we work together well, and sometimes meet up for a pint.”
doing the Work. He misses them at crime scenes, talking through the evidence, chasing suspects. That’s not good, because it’s what got John clonked in the head a few weeks ago and turned him into someone different. He can’t let that happen again, so it’s better if they don’t consider any cases. He doesn’t want any new personalities; he’ll stick with this John Watson, damaged though he may be.
I sighed. “Let me sit. I’d like a cup of tea.”
“Murray. Don’t you remember him?”
She clasps her hands together and makes a
“Even if you don’t…”
I spent the rest of the day in a daze, seesawing between hope and despair, with random side trips into fear. I’d sent word to Mycroft that we needed to talk, but had not heard back from him. Not knowing what to do with myself, I began going through the flat methodically, observing what I could, applying all my skill to deducing what had happened to Watson.
“Well? You’ve seen it before.”
All because he walked away from Sherlock, still believing that he hated the boy who outed him.
“Let’s have some tea.”
I had grown old. My family was gone, except for my nieces. Greenwood Manor was sold when my cousin Edwin finally died of alcoholism, the glassworks long bankrupt. What little was earned from the sale came to me. I used the proceeds to buy myself a cottage in Sussex Downs, where I now planned to live.
John considers himself straight. One day he will meet a woman and marry her. Sherlock knows this because that’s what people do.
He nodded. “I said you’d hired me to assist you with cases and that you wanted me to have an education. I didn’t let on that I suspected his motives. I feared I might have been overly suspicious, seeing some intention that wasn’t there, so I didn’t say anything to you. I was afraid you’d pull me out of the class. He’s a good teacher, Holmes.”
“Yes, but…yes. It’s fine. You’re just the last person in the world I would have down as an animal vigilante.”
And the fact, John thought as he tugged Sherlock's trousers down, relishing the ripping tear he heard as he yanked at them, that Sherlock had goaded him into this, had manipulated John the whole time- all day long- was just...it made him... Christ...it made him want to spank the little brat.
ordered it! Let me in this instant- I can hear his heart monitor beeping from here!"
Sherlock glanced at the familiar facade of his regular clothes shop, then back at John who was looking away down the street, uncomfortable and frowning. "What's wrong? Why don't you want to accompany me?"
The detective frowned tiredly, wheezing, his forehead crinkled and his pale eyes tightly shut. He suffered a few, full-body shudders as a couple of unexpected aftershocks from his orgasm tremored through him. Chest heaving, he licked the remaining particles comprising John's taste from his heart-shaped mouth, before endeavouring to make use of his vocal chords. "What?" he uttered breathlessly.
"-and here I am. Ready, willing, and able."
Sherlock whimpered and pressed himself closer, making sure his softening cock stayed lodged inside John and fumbled between them, grasping John's cock, which he had let go of in the midst of his orgasm, again and pumping it quickly, hand hot and wet from sweat and precome.
"...It...it doesn't matter," John responded, his face wincing in an awkward half-smile, half-grimace, his dark eyes betraying the truth of an apparent deep feeling of unsettled disappointment.
John wriggled slightly with quiet glee, loving the sound of the word on Sherlock's shy lips. "God, I could listen to you talk about orgasms for hours," he chuckled. "And when you got tired, I'd give you a couple more to talk about."
John immediately pulled away, turned off the toy and gently removed it (to the shuddery, breathless gasp of his partner), and set it aside. He leaned up to untie Sherlock from the bonds he'd ensnared him with, gently lowering his arms to the bed, wincing when Sherlock moaned in pain at the change in position.
When John woke the next morning, he had already reached down to palm his morning erection…before he remembered his rash promise to Sherlock the day before.
"You can't be serious."
John didn't respond, just laved a few messy, token kisses upon Sherlock's spine, and then took himself in hand, wasting no time in slicking then nudging his swollen tip between the other man's cheeks, steering it up and down a few times, groaning thickly.
"Well, it stopped you complaining for two minutes," John responded weakly, his fists clenching in unconscious anxiety. "Goodnight Sherlock. Happy New Year. Well, nearly."
"Better for seeing you." Shaun said, grabbing his own food and nudging John. "You got some time? Later? Yeah?" He wiggled his eyebrows suggestively.
!" Sherlock's spine bowed when John licked a wet line up his cock. He tossed his head back, shouting helplessly when John did it again, moving to take him in his mouth-
"Want to do something for
"I...I don't know exactly," Molly said, and Sherlock could tell she was gnawing on her thumb as she hesitantly continued. "I just...I just wanted to let you know, I didn't think...well..."
He stretched his arms over his head, wincing happily at the resultant pull and tug on his sore, abused muscles. It was a deep, glorious ache and Sherlock revelled in it for almost a full minute, twisting this way and that to make his muscles spasm and pang and smart. If he hadn't been already shagged out, he would have been incredibly aroused by it.
Piss. Off. - JW
"Do you want me to stop?" John asked, his voice a low purr in Sherlock's ear. "Do you want me to stop, Sherlock? I will. I'll let you do up your trousers again and we'll walk all the way back to the hotel."
“Toast. Now,” John instructed distantly, not looking at Sherlock. He licked his left thumb and forefinger and turned the page of the paper, gaze intent.
The detective shrugged. It had seemed a reasonable query. “Must be fun.”
“I thought you’d say that. The greater good, John, the greater good.”
turn."
John's cock throbbed irritably, as if asking him what the hell he was waiting for, and a sleepy little moan from Sherlock as he insistently pressed himself against John made up his mind. He shifted, aligning his hip better to give Sherlock more to rub against, and John reached down, his eyes fixed on Sherlock's body, and started stroking himself.
"It’s fair, love. I’m still going without sex and I'm still proving a point. But just because I’m going without…doesn’t mean you have to." John's hand moved another inch closer to Sherlock's cock, a spurt of pre-come weeping from the tip. Sherlock very quickly made up his mind.
Even the brief, repeated little kisses on his fingertips, and the inside of his elbows, were curiously satisfying and made his heart swell in a way he didn't really understand.
"Can I...can I come in your hair?" John suddenly asked in hopeful, bashful anticipation.
"Why in the hell-" John started angrily but Sherlock cut him off, blurting out-
Huffing, he shifted further down in the bed, spread his legs a bit more to grant himself better access to his body, and slowly but inexorably pushed a second finger in alongside the first, biting his lip at the not-unpleasant stretch and slight burn.
That was how John found himself with his pants around his thighs and Shaun on his knees eagerly sucking him off.
“Well yeah, but mostly because you know that if you didn’t, you’d drop dead. You don’t
“Maybe deep down, you just don’t want to. Maybe you should stop being so stubborn. Maybe you should get out of your Mind Palace a bit more. No wonder you’re so pale, you’re always indoors.”
John grinned wickedly. "I try. Another?" At Sherlock's nod, John eased a second finger into his arse, biting his lip as Sherlock's hole contracted around his fingers, a presage of how it would feel around his dick.
Long fingers grasped his hand, stilling it, and John gave Sherlock a questioning look.
Sherlock vocalised a voracious, barely-restrained growl of pleasure, before sobbing quietly and pushing his prick insistently, possessively, into John's throat.
"T-talk to me." Sherlock commanded in a shaky voice. "Tell me...tell me what you would do to me if you were here."
“Oh, yes! Is it still there? How does it feel?" Sherlock asked excitedly, grinning widely, and extending one long hand to John's bare stomach, as if palpating for residual ejaculate.
"Yes." Sherlock said slowly, not understanding the sudden, inexplicable shift in John's mood. He'd been expecting John to use him for his pleasure and...had been very turned on by the idea. He'd expected John to come down his throat- as he'd seen done in pornography- and afterward, he'd cuddle Sherlock and that would be the end of their row.
The door and its lock were incredibly flimsy at best and nobody ever actually bothered to try and sequester themselves alone in the shower room. His heart jumped with worry when he realised that his second question was,
John's words repeated back to Sherlock on a loop, running through his head and Sherlock felt his bottom lip wobbling alarmingly, his eyes starting to smart, and he desperately tried to get control of his emotions before he embarrassed himself. John's instincts, honed over many months of dealing with his love, told him exactly what was happening and he saved Sherlock from embarrassment by hugging him tightly, letting Sherlock hide his face in John's shoulder, and playfully groping Sherlock's backside, making light of the situation.
bit lacking when compared to Sherlock's toy. Remembering its considerable girth and length, John amended that. Maybe more than just a tiny bit lacking.
Sherlock merely smirked, and poked his tongue out at his doctor.
Sherlock nodded, inhaling shakily. "I know that but…Imagination is a burden. I can delete most of the details, but some fragments remain," He mumbled, frowning and snuggling even closer to his doctor so not a centimetre separated them. "I don't want you to mention them and I don't want to have to think about them again. Ever."
Sherlock's eyes darkened at the presence of his doctor standing beside him in only a thin towel, the scent of cheap hotel shampoo and the heat of damp flesh drawing him irresistibly.
He hadn't come in 3 weeks. It was by far not the longest he'd ever gone without sexual pleasure. Not even close. He'd gone 6 months before without an orgasm and not even cared or noticed. But this was vastly different.
"The roof's caved in Mrs. Hudson. Sherlock had nothing to do with it." He gave his boyfriend a swift look. "Did you?"
John teased the tip of Sherlock's cock with the wet entrance of the flesh jack, easing it down over his cock, and Sherlock's head fell back against the pillow.
"Didn't you see it, Sherlock? Didn't you
The shattered doctor gingerly propped himself up into a sitting position, grimacing as he felt Sherlock's release leak from him and onto the mattress. He sighed, making a mental note that he really needed to invest in more bedsheets.
Sherlock licked his lips, glancing down shyly. "Will you...will you take me to bed?"
"Wait for what?" John asked, straightening and moving towards Sherlock, his fingers picking open the buttons of his shirt as he walked.
Sherlock grinned wolfishly, leant down to lap up the tempting hot droplet, and then gritted his teeth as he pulled back, re-adjusted his wet hands underneath John’s hips, and began to pound into his doctor as violently as he could, the headboard banging deafeningly against the wall, mattress screeching. With a feral growl of effort, Sherlock increased his pace, the sharp smack of wet skin on skin maddeningly glorious and deafening.
He licked his lips, self-conscious. "Um...I guess-"
“OKay...okay, let's...I'm ready. I'm so ready," John laughed. "Christ Sherlock, where do you want to do it?"
Sherlock sniffed and realised that his diatribe was essentially a suicide note, and therefore cleared his throat, standing up tall, and taking a fortifying breath.
“You promised me a smutty story, Sherlock. You failed to shock me, so now you have to man up and tell me about it.
Shaun responded with admirable composure, and a sickening smile. "You're a lucky boy."
"Not much...to talk...-" John broke off, gasping, hips pumping fervently into the circle of Sherlock's hand. "T-tighter...that's it...like that...you're doing fine, sweetheart. Perfect....Oh-" He shuddered, his entire body convulsing, as he orgasmed.
He ached for it. After today -
"Oh...yes, that's it...that's
His doctor was deeply flushed, his turbulent blue eyes fixated on his detective with a dark look. It suggested that Sherlock’s shocking comment had cemented the fact that the brunette would pay dearly later.
Molly was trying to think of something constructive to say in response to that shit-storm of imagery, when the detective interrupted her thoughts.
He could feel it there, just below the surface, just waiting to be unleashed.
"You're gorgeous." John teased, tweaking one of his curls. "But after today's stakeout I think we both need a shower." He kissed Sherlock quickly before trotting down the hall to start the shower so it'd be warm.
"So you thought I was just...and you were okay with that?"
what I want to do with you," John muttered, swallowing with a faintly-unattractive gulp, his indigo eyes somehow dark and bright at the same time. As he spoke, he divested himself of the rest of his uniform.
He continued for nearly two minutes in relative silence, before the smaller man’s stifled snuffles of laughter became audible.
drugging me. You haven't set up cameras in my room or something, have you?"
In the sudden silence, Sherlock's ears were ringing from the sounds of gunfire and he blinked rapidly, trying to disperse the resonance in his head.
Sherlock stood insensate as his doctor suddenly jerked violently, and shuddered, his right hand grasping the showerhead with brutal force as he ejaculated with a few short, sharp, repressed gasps and thick sighs.
“I’m waiting for my massage,” the doctor said calmly, and the detective frantically looked around the room before remembering that he had left the pricey oil in the living room. John heard him scramble with the door lock, and heavy feet pound distantly away before returning with even more fervour. The door slammed, and he giggled softly as he felt Sherlock throw his weight onto the bed beside him with absolutely zero grace. He giggled harder when the action apparently brought up a little bit of residual dust and caused Sherlock to let out a series of small, high-pitched sneezes that never sounded as if they belonged to the tall, broad-shouldered man in question.
squash, anyway? Tennis for people who had no friends? Sherlock sighed, absently watching the squash players shaking hands, glaring when the camera cut to one of their girlfriends in the stands, pretty and blonde, applauding her boyfriend and beaming proudly.
"Yes, it's just...it's a
"It's not like you have room to talk." John reminded him, lifting his head to see where the vibrator had got to.
John gasped, laughing awkwardly. "…I've…this would be the first time, I've…"
…" John sped up his thrusts as he felt Sherlock's muscles begin fluttering around him, knowing the other man was close, the knowledge making the arousal in his own body coil tighter, spark and flare.
." He promised and that, coupled with the sentimental name, sent a shiver of pure arousal through Sherlock's core. He followed after John on stiff legs, hoping to be called 'darling' again. Perhaps right before he came. He thought the flood of chemicals that were induced by the moniker would feel nice at orgasm.
John's ears felt as if they were ringing, his heart thudding in his chest, and he wasn't even aware that he was gripping Sherlock's hips hard enough to leave bruises behind. "You didn't."
After a minute of kisses which were of a short-circuiting intensity, Sherlock pulled back, huffing inelegantly for breath, and quite frankly lost for words. "You, um...we were…I'm...what?"
and across his perineum, sparking pleasure along his nerve endings and making his vision go slightly fuzzy at the edges.
"If we did it again...you know...'seventy-nine'...if you were...
"Do you...still love me?" Sherlock hated the wobble in his voice but couldn't stop it. He didn't know what he'd do if John didn't, he realized, imagining John moving out and the two of them stop speaking.
"Uh, yeah, I was...but his meeting ended early and so...thought I'd look you up." John stepped closer to Shaun, making his intentions clear. "Thought we could...I thought, what we did last time...fucking blew my mind." John laughed, his blush barely visible on his suntanned face.
Sherlock nodded, heart pounding in his throat at the idea of finally having sex-
, you must be going mad with it. I concede." He said quickly. "I concede, John. I want to make you come. Please."
“You like cats then?”
Sherlock glanced over the message, before chuckling and clumsily hauling himself back onto the mattress.
," Sherlock snapped irritably. "You're getting your rocks off somewhere and I know it's not in the vicinity of
"Of course." Sherlock frowned, not sure what John was getting at. He understood John was jealous of Chaucer but...surely he didn't think... "John..." Sherlock began hesitantly, but John had already seized his hand and was dragging him into the park.
“…You’ve been watching too many films.”
"I care because..." John sank down onto the edge of Sherlock's bed. "Because I feel...the same way."
sweeter, my dear."
"John, I was being serious-"
Sherlock's throat went dry. He wanted to reach out and touch John, turn him around and kiss him, grind his cock against his thigh and have John smirk knowingly at him, reach down and tug at his dick.
"John!" Sherlock yelped at the sudden pinch to his bottom.
"Wanker." John growled.
Looking a bit like a fish out of water, Sherlock shrugged off his dressing gown and made his way closer to John who smirked and pressed something on the CD player to make the 'sex song' play on repeat. He turned the volume up a fair bit too, as the rainstorm became almost deafening, battering the windows and hissing against the walls of the flat.
The only answer to his call was the lingering echo of the front door slamming shut, and Sherlock felt a frown crease his eyebrows. With a huff and pulled his head back into the bathroom, slamming the door with enough force to shake the frame.
John smirked, casually wiped a few beads of sweat from his forehead and damp, sand-coloured hair, and left the room, to the pronounced, insistent groans of his detective. He made his way to the living room and picked up his discarded, abused phone, quietly amused, once again, at the number of missed calls.
How old is their child? They were at uni when they met, he said, so maybe she’s a teenager. Lestrade has a teenaged daughter and says it’s the worst.
“We must agree how the couple’s motivations will be proved. I say that marriage assumes love. You must prove that money is the motivation.”
“No. That was a surprise to us both, I think. After the case was solved, we came back to the flat, and… It just happened.”
Neither John nor I spoke. John was frowning, a puzzled crease appearing between his eyes. Though it wasn’t the moment for such thoughts, I was thinking how much I’d like to kiss that little crease. And other places.
“I couldn’t, John. You’re my pressure point. If I had told you, I have no doubt that you’d be dead now.”
“I thought she might.”
“I have studied boxing, Watson. You are shorter than I am, which means your blows to my face will lack the power of a taller assailant. You need only mark my face. Now, strike!”
John apparently doesn’t have shared custody. Does he feel guilty? Does he miss his daughter? Does he still love his wife, who rejected him?
Going to this party, getting up in front of the group and giving a performance— in some ways it’s more unnerving than going into battle. There, he always knew his role: expect incoming, save lives, try not to get killed. This is new. Maybe if he knew Matt and his friends better, if he’d been to parties like this before—
“And?”
“It was an experiment. I fixed it when I was done. I’m not sure why plumbers are so highly paid when it’s merely pipes and valves. At any rate, Mr Milverton’s staff may need my services today. I believe they are having some trouble with the water pressure.”
He thinks about the beehives, the cottage he has imagined in Sussex. That might happen, but there will not be anyone standing at the door, calling him in for tea. Sherlock will be alone. That’s the way it must be. Alone will protect him.
I sat back on my heels, looking at him with amusement. “I’m going to fuck you in this chair. Do you know why?”
There is a moment while it’s happening when I don’t believe it’s real. Another moment when I know it’s real, but think it can be fixed. You’re not dead. I’m a doctor, and I can heal you. We’ll take you inside on a stretcher and assess your injuries, and it’s not as bad as it looks. You open your eyes and smile at me. You’re going to be all right—
He’ll never get tired of this. All the cups of tea, the morning production of eggs and toast. The evenings, the conversations and the silences. He will be old someday, and even when he gives up the Work, there will always be something to do, and he will always have
Mrs Bellamy approached with a younger man in tow. As I had predicted, Mr Allen was a young, good-looking in a willowy way, with pale blond hair that kept falling across his forehead.
His face serious, Watson had stopped unpacking our clothes and stood watching me as I studied the few words Lestrade had written. “What is it?”
“True,” Holmes replies. “But I would guess that in any group of adolescents, you will find self-harmers. Boys were doing it when we—“ He stops, lets out an impatient sigh. “But you’re right, we should look at any signs of stress in the boys.”
“I’ll have to see—“
I decided that John should know what was happening.
“I think we should stay together from now on,” he tells Watson. “Just to be sure we don’t lose each other.”
I listened as Watson settled into the room next door. The bedsprings squeaked as he climbed into the bed, and the light under the door went out.
He might have been… intrigued. It’s rare to be
“I’m fine, Sherlock.”
Sometimes he dreams of Afghanistan. He remembers how they all counted on one another, made sure everyone was okay. He sees the faces of the ones who didn’t make it home, some dying as he worked on them.
The others were staring at him, waiting for him to say something rude.
He sighed. “True. But it isn’t as if you would be raising your own offspring. That’s what a wife is for. Separate worlds, yours and hers. Think of how many couples we know who rarely see one another. Even our own father, when he was alive, was hardly ever around. There’s the shooting season, and hunting season, and the fishing trips to Scotland. When in town, there are evenings at the club—”
“Let’s go home.”
“He’s seeing a counsellor. I don’t know why he wouldn’t tell me. He’s hiding something.” He holds out the evidence, the business card he found on the floor.

and spotted me. His eyes widened, and then his face crumpled. Staggering a bit, he grabbed onto the railing to support himself, and wept.
I’d thought about joining too, but only because I have a military kink and enjoy ogling half-dressed soldiers. Now that I had John, looking for men in uniform to ogle was no longer a problem. I looked at him half-naked every morning when he made breakfast. On weekends, he wore his camo pants.
“But, Mr Holmes— surely, you can’t mean that you’ve killed a man for nothing! You’ve spent your life working for justice—“ The young man struggled for words, then fell silent under the keen gaze of the old man.
. “Now, why did you call me? Do you have any scripts for me?”
“I’m sorry, but we don’t give out phone numbers or addresses for drivers. If you give the note to us, we can pass it on.”
I closed the door behind us, grabbed him and drew him into a kiss.
kill them. It’s sort of a game, you see. A wager, which I intend to win.”
“His death.
” he read.
Ella says nothing, patiently waiting for him to say more. Well, it is rather a bombshell, him announcing that he’s in a gay relationship. Did she see that coming? Did she deduce his sexuality from the way he held his tea or cleared his throat or something? Or maybe she’s just falling back on her training, putting on that face that is meant to encourage him to say more.
, she’s written.
“You need to drop this, Sherlock.”
John drinks because life has backed him into a corner and he doesn’t know what to do other than sit there and stare back at it until one of them decides to strike. He drinks because it’s not a fight he can win, and not one he can sit out, and he’s paralysed, torn between caution and reckless abandon. He drinks because nothing is fair, he’s got a limp and two therapists while Sherlock Holmes has an amazing life, so brilliant and amazing that he has to stalk Watson and make sure he knows it.
After five minutes of wordless pacing, Holmes abruptly announces, “I’m going for a walk, clear my head a bit.”
“Don’t be an idiot,” Sherlock says, sloshing more tea on himself. “You can’t just go barging in and asking questions. Abusers know how to protect themselves. If anyone else is being abused—“
Not that Mycroft would care. My grief is his advantage. “Will he return?”
One of those few genuine seers I came to know was a woman calling herself Maria Morozov. She pretended to be Russian because it gave her more credibility, but was actually from Manchester. I thought her a fraud at first because during the seance she spoke to the dead relatives of her clients, while real ghosts hovered around the circle. She saw through me at once.
Moriarty chuckled. “You must teach your bull pup to heel, Holmes. His hackles are raised and he looks like he might want to bite me.”
He pours himself another glass, swirls it and lets himself be mesmerised by the way it catches the light. His father spent every evening romancing a glass of whisky, slowly drowning himself, letting his life slip away.
“I used the evidence to lead Scotland Yard to an erroneous conclusion. The position of the body, the trajectory of the shots, the condition of the desk—“ I shook my head. “It was child’s play, really. Your story was ridiculous. And why did you include me? You might have said you were there alone.”
Nodding, he sat at the small writing desk, took out his notebook and filled his pen.
This is not normal.
Watson shakes his head. “Tragic.”
At first Brook seemed startled by their reaction. For a moment it looked as if he was about to go off script. A rabid expression passed over his features, but quickly resolved into a smug smile. He took a small bow and strode off stage as the audience heard Mrs Hudson crying for help.
Snapping my book shut, I rose and stalked to the bedroom. He would search our desks, I assumed. Watson’s revolver and my own I had put back in their usual places. When I returned to the sitting room fully dressed five minutes later, Lestrade had found the two revolvers and was holding at a slip of paper which he’d taken from an envelope on my desk. It was Milverton’s note.
“No!” said Molly.
I tell him.
“Doctor Watson is a witness,” he says. “We will require tea.”
It’s not a boat, he realizes. It’s a swimmer, closer than he looked. People do swim across the channel. It’s twenty-one miles at the narrowest point, but the straits are a busy shipping lane, so a swimmer usually has a boat alongside them as they swim.
“He’s not in at the moment.”
We sit in silence for a while. She’s put her notebook aside, and is just waiting. She knows why I’m here, but wants me to say it.
so I figured they knew what they were getting into when they hired me for this
Being difficult to get along with wasn’t a persona he deliberately cultivated. As long as he could remember, people had found him unlikeable. They recognised his intelligence and his talent, but those traits, while admirable, were not endearing. People might praise him, but couldn’t love him.
He does miss Watson, and he doesn’t. He misses his warm body, next to him in bed. He misses the questions, the arguments. John Watson remains, but in a state Holmes can’t reach. If there is any way those fragments can come together and recreate the man, he would bring it about— in a heartbeat. He doesn’t know how.
. These are the things he needs to start doing.
Holding his breath, he retreats to the kitchen. He lets it out slowly.
might describe it, he thinks. “My wife and I are divorcing, and that’s a bit of tension. But Sherlock’s been wonderful. Amazing.”
He frowned. “You think it’s a bad idea. Why?”
Watson shrugs. “I didn’t think he was. Maybe there are others like us, but with seven billion people filling the planet, we might never meet one. Though the world was a lot smaller then, it’s a quite a coincidence that the two of us ever met.”
He googles everything he doesn’t know about head injuries and interrogates the doctors who come to check on John. He interrogates the nurses too, asking why the tea is so bad, when bringing water to a boil is a simple matter for people trained in medical things. Perhaps more training is needed, or they might buy better quality tea bags. He asks when John will be able to come home. They will be glad to be rid of him, he can tell, and maybe that will speed up John’s release.
Billy came up with the morning paper. I opened it and read the account of last evening’s adventure. “Well, two suspects are said to have escaped justice. One of them sounds a bit like you, Watson. No mention of the arrest, though. I suppose Lestrade decided it was simply too difficult to explain. Oh, there is mention of a woman who was seen leaving the premises moments before the alarm was raised.” I lowered the paper and looked at him. “Watson, there is something I need to understand. Why did you give a statement? There wasn’t enough evidence to convict you of murder, and I could have finessed the burglary charge. Why did you feel it necessary to create this ridiculous cover story?”
I feel my fate in what I cannot fear.
“Well, it was a rough day for Molly, no lie.” Lestrade frowned at him, a question on his face. “You okay, Sherlock? You seem… preoccupied.”
“Yes, I’m his boyfriend,” I decided.
“Take them,” she replied, stepping towards me.
Just to be sure, he adds, “I love you, John.”
Halfway down the stairs he stops, foot in midair.
Is this disinhibition? Is John going to start kissing him and sneak into his bed at night—
“Depending on how you write it, this could spell the end of the series. It will destroy the dynamic between the two main characters.”
Before things can become more awkward, Mary leads David away, and they are alone once more.
It was time for a distraction. “Let’s have sex,” I suggested.
your sexuality? Or are you just playing at being gay? Using me as a distraction?” He huffs angrily, drops into his chair. “I thought you were committed to this.”
Teenaged girls are going through puberty. They hate their parents and run after boys. They dye their hair awful colours and wear too much makeup. They giggle and cry and slam doors.
He’s trying, really trying, to be the old John Watson. Some days it feels like he’s reaching the top of that hill, and other days it feels like he’s just been kicked back down to the bottom.
“Mmm?”
“John and I weren’t actually friends,” he said.
. That’s right.
“Are you still afraid?”
John gives a wet laugh. “Yeah, he does. I shouldn’t have hit him.”
“Ungrateful boy!” my aunt exclaimed. “Are you not humbled to be offered such an opportunity? Will you question this good man who is willing to take you in, wicked child?”
Maybe that’s why he’s been angry with Sherlock, because he’s reminded John who he used to be, back before he got lost.
“Would you have grieved? I mean, once you stopped being angry with me?”
He stood before the door of 221B. His keys were in his pocket, his mind elsewhere. It was still raining. His coat was wet, his feet cold. He blinked at the door knocker, recognising where he was. Inside, it would be dry. He might make tea. He might start a fire and get warm. All good ideas.
He shrugs. “I ran into someone I knew back in school. Like, when we were sixteen. Back then, he told everyone I was gay.”
I’d wanted to kiss him, as I said, from the first. I made a mistake the first day, though. He asked me if I had a boyfriend and, a bit sidetracked by his deep blue eyes and his dimples, I replied, without considering the implications,
He’d almost forgotten about the killer. The only reason he’d moved over to Baker Street was because Holmes threatened to sleep on his floor. Right now, Holmes looks like he could sleep on the train platform. And Watson needs to think; he needs to be alone.
“You’ve already seen who I am.”
“I wanted to get an idea how much we could ask, if we do sell. This is our house, but you’re not here now. You have a place to live, and I want a place that’s mine, John. I feel like I’m living in the past here.”
I pictured myself alone in our rooms, the lonely nights and silent mornings. No Watson clattering in our little kitchen, getting my tea ready to serve the moment I awakened. No one to take notes and organise my files. I imagined taking cases without him, all joy of the chase gone. His practice would grow as his family increased, and he would have no time for me. He would become successful, even renowned, while my own practice dwindled. Eventually he would regard me as a brief and possibly shameful incident in his past. He would put me out of his mind. I would grow old on Baker Street, alone and friendless.
Gives you a different perspective, doesn’t it? Every night you think about that gun, contemplate ending it all, but you never think about a psycho with a gun waiting in the alley for you to walk by, grabbing you and threatening to kill you, do you?
“How did you know her?” It’s one of Molly’s grandchildren asking. She’s not young, probably in her forties, and looks a bit like Molly.
He gapes for a moment, digesting the facts that a) he’s
John mentioned that Sherlock’s family used to invite him to the shore each summer.
“You’re not lying,” Sherlock said. “But you’re not telling the whole truth. Don’t worry, I’m not going to push you for an answer. But you need to know that your friends— Mike and Molly and Greg, and even Phil and Sally— have mourned you for years. It was a cruel thing to do to people who cared about you.”
“You said
On my first night, I lay in my narrow bed, feeling restless and truly alone in the world. I’d had no choice about coming to Greenwood Manor or leaving there. Though I’d been kept there, my material needs provided, no one had really cared for me. I was not loved. I was a burden, an obligation, an unwanted beggar.
Victor, who left Sherlock when he found out that he
“Ah. You’ve seen John, then.”
that day, that first class. The uniform ought to have made him look like any other boy. What was it, then? Something in the way he combed his hair, perhaps. Maybe his tie wasn’t quite right. Walking into that room, he could smell his own sweat. He took the only empty seat, right next to a boy with dark, curly hair. Training his eyes on his notebook, he heard snickering and whispers.
real sex, you know,” Sherlock mumbles sleepily. “We don’t have to—“ He sighs. “Just having you here, like this. It’s enough.”
Holmes makes an impatient gesture. “I don’t eat when I’m on a case.”
Sherlock stood in the doorway, looking a bit lost. “I don’t remember you telling me to get milk.”
, he reminds himself.
“Really?” John stares at his flatmate. He and Sherlock still have a lot to work out; he doesn’t want to push them into anything. They’re fragile, and John’s life— his daughter, his ex-wife— are things Sherlock will have to accept if they’re to be together, but that will take time. He can see that Sherlock has thought about this, though. He never expected that, and it brings tears to his eyes. “You really mean it? You don’t mind?”
The fact that John says he loves Sherlock means very little, he realises. Love is an emotional thing, a state of mind that impedes rational thought. John
“Not really. When I talked with the police, I remembered a few details. Mostly it’s a blur, though. Like a dream.”
Oh, and here’s a door. How convenient.
My aunt did not agree. Perhaps if I had brought money with me, she might have found a morsel of affection for me in her heart, but there was nothing left of my father’s business when he died. The house in Colchester was sold, and my uncle brought me to his home in Yorkshire, a village called Dourwich. The house was known as Greenwood because it was surrounded by a small wood. That green shelter was the only attractive feature of the house.
“The only thing I’m worried about is my stalker. If he makes one more remark about how he’s my biggest fan—“
“I’m fine.” He gives David a tight, insincere smile.
“Why would Alex have a weapon?”
Molly says,
He’s crossing Russell Square one day, thinking about his worthless life (so worthless, he can’t think of a single thing to say about it in the blog his therapist insisted that he start), when he hears a voice. Not a familiar voice, but a persistent one.
“Where are you going, Watson? Sit down. I predict that this will be interesting.”
“Always. It’s human nature, Watson. Adolescents are insecure and quite insane. Engaging in dangerous or disgusting acts is a form of masculine bonding; those who refuse to engage are silenced, one way or another, lest they tattle on the participants.”
“If it were a crime, and he were a suspect, I’d say,

Sherlock’s attention is suddenly diverted back to the street. “There— that cab!” He grabs his coat. “Let’s go!”
looks like.
It breaks John’s heart a little to hear Sherlock so hesitant, so unwilling to believe that John is willing to accept him, scars and all. “I don’t hate you.”
He accepted the call. “Hi, Mary… Yes, she’s here. She brought a friend— yeah, no. I didn’t invite them… Yes, I know you didn’t… Well, okay. See you soon.” He ended the call and faced the girls. “Ariel’s mum is coming to get you both.”
“I think that we should toast Alex Tribble,” Molly said, raising her glass towards Sherlock.
And finally, John’s been spending time with his family. He has a right to do that; the problem is that Sherlock doesn’t trust Mary. John has been worried about his daughter, and was angry that Mary wouldn’t answer his calls and texts. Very manipulative of her, holding the daughter hostage— for what? What does she want of John? She’s a published author, probably brokering deals for more novels, maybe screenplays. She doesn’t need anything from John.
not himself, that a shapeshifting alien had replicated him, and stowed the real Jason somewhere. The fear was that the alien had killed him (though Rich Brook’s acting was so lame that nobody would ever believe him a murderer). He swore them to secrecy.
“Not Mike?”
“I see,” she said. “And what will be your specialisation?”
When I lifted his skull from the ground, he smiled at it, as if recognising himself. I placed it in the box with the other bones, covered it with a canvas tarp, and took it away with me.
he told him. Just hormones.
Sherlock forgot his lines completely. He moved his jaw up and down, but nothing came out. Around the periphery of his vision, he could see his cast-mates grinning at him.
he breathes.
“You’re an actor. What’s the big deal?”
Alternating POV John and Sherlock, switch indicated by the horizontal line.
“There’s no room here, Rosie,” John says. “We can see each other, go out and do things together, but I don’t see how—“
He looks thin. I noticed that night that he’d lost weight. It’s hard to discern a physique when it’s draped in an ill-fitting suit, but it didn’t look like he’d been biking to work, trying to slim down. Not a trying-to-get-buff kind of thin. More like he’d been ill.
We were shown into the sitting room, where my mother was enthroned in her chair, talking to my brother. Dressed all in black silk, her iron-grey hair was pulled into a rather severe chignon, her face surrounded by pressed ringlets, the fashion of another age. She frowned as I entered, followed by Watson.
By some luck, John hadn’t bled out, but it had been a close thing. Four pints of his blood, spilled in the alley. Too close for Sherlock, who knew that losing John in such a stupid manner, on such a trivial case, simply could
It was time for a conversation.
It’s after midnight. The conversation with Sherlock has keyed her up a bit, and she’s spent the last hour reading a book just to make herself sleepy. As she’s ready to finally turn out the light, the bell rings. She gets out of bed and presses the button to reply. “Who’s there?”
Morstan smiled. “And he kissed you.”
“You’ve been stood up,” Holmes says, sliding into the seat opposite Watson. A smug expression graces his stupid handsome face. Not exactly handsome, but striking. Though Watson is not thinking about that now. Or ever. Definitely not.
A few days later he met a man willing to kill him, for money. He stabbed Holmes, and as he bled, tied rocks to him and sank him in the river. When he finally woke, naked on the bank, it was as if no time at all had passed. He was not enlightened.
. John was important, and he hadn’t figured that out yet. It’s hard to remember what it was like before John shot the cabbie and stood behind the police tape, looking inconspicuous. He can’t even remember the Sherlock that got up that morning and didn’t think about cleaning up the mess for his new flatmate, who was meeting him later on. What was that Sherlock thinking? Did he have breakfast that day? Did he take a shower? Did Mrs Hudson bring the mail up and twitter at him about nonsense? Did he ignore her?
The cab ride home was silent. Watson took my hand and held it, but didn’t ask.
John thinks of all the things he’s ever wanted to know about Sherlock, but has never asked because it has never seemed a good time. Sherlock has a way of warding off questions with just a look. An armour that does not allow anyone in, not even John. He’s wondered about a lot of things, but asking has never been an option. Sherlock never has to ask; he simply deduces. John is terrible at deductions, as Sherlock often reminds him.
“I’m not saying that. Only you know what you want, John. I notice that our conversations about this tend to lead in the same direction. My observation is that you think dating is something you should be doing, and women are who you should be considering. But you hesitate, back off from actually meeting women. That’s what I see. I only want you to think about why you may be hesitant, whether you’re uncertain about dating in general, or dating women specifically.”
“You’re a sociopath?”
“As gay, she means,” John said. “I’m not worried. Straight people have been playing gays on the big and small screen for years. And whether anyone wants to recognise it or not, gay people have been on both screens as well, mostly playing straight characters. We’re actors; playing other people is what we do.”
He rose from his chair, looking at Watson, who sprang up, his eyes on the document case.
“Your boy,” he said, taking the offered seat. “Is he trustworthy? Discreet? I am thinking only of your client.”
“Who would assault a clergyman? Do you really think she will believe this story?”
He nodded. “And you will be donning no disguises?”
(See the end of the chapter for
Mycroft, all-seeing, says nothing. He lets him in, and Sherlock goes straight to the guest room and falls asleep
“What— what are you doing here?” He leaned the bat against the wall. “Never mind, I already know. You recognised me that night when you rode in my cab. I don’t know how, but you did. And you just have to be right, don’t you, and prove you’re a fucking genius? Christ.”
“I know it’s hard. Say it now, what you wanted to say.”
I hope you understand. I’ll never forget you. And I’ll probably keep talking to you sometimes, even though you hardly ever reply. But I can’t keep doing this. I can’t keep imagining you, talking to you, replaying the moment when I know it’s real.
“I hate her. She’s completely unreasonable.”
Watson looked directly at me. “Of course. As long as he is happy with my contributions to our partnership, I will continue to work with him. If he is dissatisfied, he may replace me, of course. He is not one to keep such sentiments to himself.”
“And have you decided what it all means?”
“Think about home, Sherlock. You’re going to come home to me.”
The small art gallery was called Hands, its sign featuring the handprint of a child. On display were wall art, table art, hand-painted figurines, some tapestries, and an assortment of jewellery. He wasn’t especially fond of contemporary art, and the collection of collages he saw on entering did not impress him. Walking up and down the narrow space, he examined the offerings, trying to imagine people making money from such rubbish.
“How do you reconstruct this, gentlemen?” I asked. “One pistol fired, a bullet in the holder’s neck, another in the ceiling.” I pointed out Milverton’s bullet, which they had overlooked.
Pen. – SH
"Like that?" John grunted, as if he were the one penetrating Sherlock and not the other way around. "Give me another. Come on, Sherlock."
Fuck.
"Well. Yes. That's…good to know. You're very welcome, dear. It was…nice to meet you." She gestured helplessly, clearly at a loss. "Run along now. We'll call…well, perhaps you'd better call us, John."
"Because I love you too."
They both inadvertently jerked as another brutal shock of deep, deafening thunder and startling blue lightning pervaded the flat.
John raised his eyebrows a little, absolutely not inclined to argue with his lover. He circled Sherlock's prostate one more time, then pulled out. No sooner had he done so, than Sherlock rolled onto his front and pushed himself onto his hands and knees. John stared open-mouthed as Sherlock, after a second's thought, placed one scarred, anchoring hand against the headboard in anticipation of getting fucked hard. John stripped himself completely in record time.
John didn't deign to answer, just sequestered himself back in the barren hospital bed, and stoically refused to let himself burst into tears.
, Sherlock, don't play." John instructed firmly, giving Sherlock a stern look, watching as Sherlock obediently swabbed the hot, wet flannel over himself, curiously and slightly shakily raising his other hand to his wilted black curls, where his slim fingers encountered a few errant globs of semen. Sherlock grimaced.
Sherlock's hands flew like magnets to John's waist, but he was too stunned to reply to the kiss before John pulled back, looking ridiculously...fine. His voice was noticeably croaky, and Sherlock tentatively extended a few fingers to his throat, just to caress.
"Argh," Sherlock sobbed suddenly, frowning as if in pain, as John rubbed his prostate repeatedly, relentlessly, worshipping the innocuous little bump of nerves. Sherlock's passage clenched reflexively tight, creating the slight sensation of pins and needles in his finger, and John could practically feel his fingertip wrinkling in the pulsing, moist heat of Sherlock's core.
Sherlock swallowed reflexively. "I...I don't know. Maybe just...touch. But...I might-"
them. John would want a demonstration with a few of them…or he might be amenable to letting Sherlock use a few on
"He'd probably love that," Jason responded snarkily, heralding another scarcely repressed wave of giggles.
That did it. John hissed a disturbingly-restricted, tear-soaked breath, and buried his face in the soft, warm skin of Sherlock's throat, making a gargantuan effort to hold his breath in an attempt to stem his grief. Sherlock wrapped his arms around him, mindful of John’s injury, and pretended he didn’t notice the wetness creeping down his neck where John’s face was pressed against him. The detective winced as the stoic grip on his hand began to quite painfully grind his finger bones together.
John glanced at Sherlock's hardened crotch under his silky blue dressing gown and boxers and rolled his eyes. "
He pondered the various terms Shaun and his boyfriend used between them, complete with giggly emoticons and capitalized "LOL's" Some of them Sherlock had never even heard of-
"No more massage, okay? You can just...just hold me, if you want...God," John whispered forcefully as he realised how laughable his words had sounded, clear in the otherwise noiseless gloom. "You're impossible to ignore though, you know that full well."
It wasn't long, though, before things evolved.
good?”
hot," John muttered, blushing self-consciously. He dragged his hands down Sherlock's extensive spine, humming appreciatively at little twitches of muscles and damp skin. He stopped when he got to the detective's wonderful backside, plump and muscled and yet wonderfully bouncy. He knew this because he gave a few playful taps to the rosy mounds.
John looked self-conscious, as if he expected Sherlock to sneer at his present or say something rude. He twirled the flower in his hands, eyes locked on it and not Sherlock. "I wanted to apologize...properly and all that. And I thought..." He trailed off, sighing, and wordlessly handed the rose to Sherlock, lips thinned down and obviously expecting scathing rejection.
"Good." John smiled at his already wrecked lover. "Think you can hold off while I open you up?"
"So is it just Sherlock being Sherlock that's hard-
“Sherlock, you can’t be my first. But you can be my last, if you want.”
Shower.
Their landlady was waiting for them at the door of 221, grinning, arms open and waiting for them.
The doctor wanted to scream at his repressed climax, instead biting fiercely into the fabric of his shirt sleeve, head crushed against his right arm, thrusting vaguely and only distantly acknowledging the hot, fresh semen that spurted over his left hand, and with the faintest wet sounds, on the carpet under his desk.
"S-Stay on the phone...I need to come, John," the detective stuttered frantically. "Where are they? Your phone isn't..." There was a faint, muffled groan, "...isn't enough."
"Trying to," came the gritted-out reply, Sherlock whining with frustration. "
But...he was still highly reluctant to move.
"I want to." Sherlock gritted out. "I'm not a child."
Sherlock's stomach, tying itself into nervous, sick knots gave a lurch as he stared at the spot John was patting as if he'd never seen a bed properly before. It was a handful of seconds before he could make his legs move, wrenching them from where they'd been almost locked into place by fear and moving, hesitantly and jerkily, over to the bed.
Slowly, mindful of making too much noise, Sherlock began a deliberate, firm rhythm at his cock, pumping his hand over the swollen shaft with brisk, business-like strokes designed to get him off in a hurry. He hadn't done this in ages- hadn't felt the need- but since his and John's first kiss, Sherlock's libido, usually quiescent and dormant, had taken a sudden upswing. It'd clambered for his attention on a daily basis, whereas before he'd barely felt the occasional twitch.
Rejection, in any form, was a hard emotion to deal with. Not necessarily one in itself, but what accompanied it. Sherlock was not used to the bitterness it inspired, or the self-loathing, the self-consciousness that prickled at his skin. He had never had a reason to doubt himself before - well, he had, but he had long since learned his features were adequate enough in appearance to manipulate man or woman.
Molly shook away her thoughts and nodded, gesturing nervously for him to sit down. She swallowed, dark-eyed, as he shook snow from his glossy black curls, and swept his coat out behind him elegantly before sitting down on the comically-small plastic chair.
John's eyes narrowed. "That, and all that work made you hungry." When Sherlock looked offended but swanned into the kitchen on his own, John laughed and followed after him.
to be fucked into oblivion," John murmured casually, taking his lunch and re-constituted orange juice over to the grubby barracks table.
"I can't
John sighed. "I wouldn't care if you lasted two seconds or two hours, love. Just so long as you're letting me shag you, I'm happy.”
He let go of Sherlock’s slim, white wrist and watched as his flatmate unconsciously rubbed a thumb across the sensitive skin. He figured the safest way to go about this was to play along with whatever hair-brained theory was behind Sherlock’s belief that any of this made sense.
"Good, yeah?" He managed to get out, chuckling as Sherlock took another bite. And another. And then another. "Might want to slow down- you don't want to make yourself sick just because you like it." John cautioned, knowing it wouldn't do any good for him to say anything. When Sherlock found something he liked, he enjoyed it with a gusto and enthusiasm that bordered on the obscene. He invariably made himself sick of whatever it was he loved and never touched it again. It'd been that way with vanilla cupcakes. The almond milk. Chocolate covered blueberries. Mrs. Hudson's biscuits. John hoped Sherlock didn't do the same with sex.
to the shower seemed impossible.
Sherlock staggered to his feet with a pained grunt, and leant one hand on the gritty, bone-cold wall of the room where he had been about to be tortured. His knees, wrists, ankles, torso, face…everything throbbed and stung agonisingly.
John grinned at the teasing pinch on his arse and didn't even have to turn around to know who it was. "Hey, you." He laughed as Shaun pressed himself against John.
He deposited their pet in the living room, checking he had enough food and water, and then returned to the bedroom with a sulky, belligerent expression on his pale face. Closing the door, he gave his doctor a piercing stare.
Sherlock nodded, straining up into John's kiss and John indulged him, slanting their lips together, smiling at Sherlock' contented sigh. He stretched himself out along Sherlock's side, tenderly kissing his beautiful, infuriating, genius, bastard, man-child.
Sherlock's face twisted as he silently agreed with John. "Come wherever then," he huffed grouchily.
“Oh,” Sherlock muttered and then paused all movement as John’s words filtered through his brain. “
"Sherlock!" John tried to ease himself out of the chair and hissed in undisguised agony as his stitches stretched. "For God's sake, I need this. Please give it to me?"
Shaun leered. "I know all about what John wants. Rough and fast and hard. We did it enough - loads of times. Not easy to forget getting fucked like that."
"Course you did." John blithely replied, raising up and pulling a face at the slick amalgamation of come and olive oil on his crotch. "Think I'm for a shower." He gave Sherlock a suggestive smile. "Want to join me?"
“My jokes are always in poor taste according to you,” Sherlock countered easily as he slumped back down to the bed with a sigh, stretching out his long legs only to curl them back up and turn aside to face John. He pillowed his face on his hands and gazed at him, having the nerve to look annoyed at being woken.
"Shh, it's alright. We're nearly there. If you're ready?" John asked breathlessly, still pulsing his soaked fingers inside Sherlock, his other hand instinctively going to his own cock and priming himself with a few rapid pumps.
The vague pleasured noise that John responded with resulted in a full-body, powerful pulse that almost sent Sherlock over the edge, burdening him with the tell-tale signs of a tempting orgasm – the helpless jolt of his pale, muscular thighs, the clench of tight stomach muscles, the wonderful, if momentarily-frightening breathlessness of an imminent climax.
Sherlock gripped John's hand as they neared the upmarket restaurant twenty minutes from Baker Street. The precipitation had ceased momentarily, but the sky was still a plump, indecisive bulk of un-shed rain clouds.
We want to thank everyone who followed this story, and everyone who took the time to drop us a review and let us know what they thought. We've appreciated each and every one.
–" Sherlock started tetchily…but trailed off as his eyes, widening in shock, took in John's suddenly naked body.
John was grinning happily even before the masculine whoops, drunken claps and yells of encouragement assaulted his ears over the ruckus of the pub.
And then Shaun was coming, moaning, painting the tiles with streaks of come. John tiptoed to peek over Shaun's shoulder at the mess on the wall. His stomach flipped with a strange mix of revulsion, and fascination.
The morning was cool and bright and tasted of a London summer, of heat and congestion and energy. Holding John's hand, having sensed his growing discomfort as they got closer to the shops he frequented, Sherlock finally was jerked to a surprised stop as John stopped short on the pavement.
." He reprimanded feebly, disgusted with the way the fluid had matted his hair together, and John had to turn away to hide his grin.
John chuckled openly, his boyish, thin-lipped grin as enticing and enchanting to Sherlock as it had ever been, even when he was teasing him. "Actually, no. She's one of my...what would you call them - conquests?"
Sherlock, hunched awkwardly in his chair, frowned, and with one hand between his legs, nodded and acquiesced. He pulled on himself with slow, steady strokes, feeling that he would love to climax soon and have this whole embarrassing ordeal over and done with, but physiologically, he was still a long way behind.
. You never actually hurt me, John. You get a bit…zealous and forceful at times but we both enjoy that. Hardly what Anderson was referring to."
that way?"
much?” he teased, speaking against John’s mouth with a laugh and an arched eyebrow. “If I had known that plastic rings did it for you, I’d have bought a whole tub full a lot earlier.”
"You've already said that."
John abruptly stood up and, with stunning acuity and skill, disabled Sherlock with a few sharp, precise blows from expert palms and fists. Wrestling Sherlock to the bed, John quickly tied the momentarily incapacitated detective to the headboard with Sherlock's own scarf- handily pooled on the bedside table- and straddled Sherlock roughly.
"Open up, dearest," he crooned in a horrible mime of a lover's voice. "Down the hatch-"
"What are you like in bed then?" John murmured conversationally, resisting the urge to paw at the tickle of his ear.
(See the end of the chapter for
"What are you doing?" He frowned, bewildered at the strange sight in front of him.
Sherlock choked and coughed on his quick intake of air, and bucked with a small spurt of pre-ejaculate. An engrossing sight that John knew he’d never be able to forget. Not that he wanted to. Sherlock then stared widely, overwhelmed and shaking, completely stunned by what had coursed through him at such a simple, fleeting touch. By the sounds of it, Sherlock was almost on the verge of hyperventilating; his penis flushed a darker shade of red.
There were a few beats of stunned silence before the cupboard door was yanked open and Mrs. Hudson bent over to glare inside. "Sherlock Holmes, get out of my cupboard this instant! I know for a fact Rufus Shinra's not a real person - he's a character in a video game. Now get out here now and explain what this is all about!"
"Do you want to have sex?" John whispered in an astoundingly attractive, feather-light, innocent tone. Sherlock jerked away, eyebrows snapping together, and gave John a surprised, searching look.
?" John asked through gritted teeth, as he began a feverish pace with his wrist, soaked with a surprising amount of pre-come, so much that small, translucent drops were plopping rhythmically from his fiercely-rapid hand, to the hatefully-overpriced carpet.
thinking about it now.
happened!”
Sherlock let out a forceful, irritable breath, then spoke into his mobile once more in a grating baritone. Sweat was still wrinkling the tips of his long fingers and his dark curls were soaked against his pale forehead. "John. I am aware we are going to fight later when you get back. Perhaps even physically. I look forward to it, as long as you end up de-stressing yourself. But there is one single thing that I would like you to give me, if you can."
Sherlock sighed theatrically, though the deep purplish smudges under his eyes and his shivery fingers reminded John that his lover was, as usual, choosing intransigence over acceptance of his own deteriorated state. The detective swayed a little, one spidery hand gripping the arm of his leather armchair as he fought against the consistent throb of pain that plagued almost every part of him.
Sherlock narrowed his eyes and pursed his mouth, dropping his hands to his sides, “Yes.
He had great hopes for this day in particular - being an 'anniversary' of sorts (and having been the one to impregnate John with the idea that it was a vastly important one), and knowing that his flatmate was sentimental about such things.
what had happened earlier?
John used his other hand to hold Sherlock's hips still, caressing his prostate in time with his tongue, knowing the tell-tale tightening of Sherlock's muscles and wanting to bring him to orgasm before he could convince him to fuck him.
The doctor bit down on his right thumbnail in a vague sublimation of a curse. "You look fucking amazing." John confessed honestly, huffing in irritation at the refusal of his body to co-operate with the frankly-overwhelming lust which churned enthusiastically, but redundantly, through his system.
"Just a bloody suggestion." Shaun muttered, taking a swig of his drink, glaring over John's shoulder as Sherlock came back, sliding into his seat and glancing around the table, obviously picking up on the tension.
A slightly chilly draft insinuated its way into John's room from the open window, causing the older man to twitch his exposed arm vaguely. The previous, record-breaking heat of the spring day had rapidly collapsed into a cool, starless night and the open window provided an enchanting, cool tang of London midnight air, tasting of pollution and the residual sweat of a working day. The cool air swirled in the room, mixing into a delectable cocktail with the sleep-tainted, mouth-watering musk that was John Watson.
"Such language." John rebuked teasingly, sinking to his knees behind Sherlock and hoping the floor was sanitary. "Honestly, the mouth on you. Wherever did you get such an idea?" He spread Sherlock's arse cheeks apart, blowing air against the tightly closed hole. Sherlock's breathing faltered.
"Of course I didn't post the photo." Sherlock scoffed. "No one else gets to know what your face looks like when you orgasm.
"Suck." He ordered, thrusting into him faster, and the resulting wail was undeniably one of arousal, despite the underlying pain that seemed to taint it. Shaun flailed, one hand grabbing John's hair and frantically tugging at the short strands. John eased up his grip, allowing him a desperate gasp of air before cutting him off again. Shaun sucked fervently on the gun, bobbing his head and deep-throating the gun's barrel as if the hard shaft in his mouth was a sensitive, angry cock.
"How do you...?"
Sherlock usually experienced post-coital John in much more domestic, relaxed settings, certainly not in the back of a grubby black cab with an out-of-date tax disc and faulty heating. The rapidly darkening evening was just nudging over the line of 'comfortably cool', and becoming distinctly, pervasively chilly. John seemed unflappably happy beside him, holding his hand and squeezing it (fondly? Possessively? Both? Sherlock wasn't sure).
"'People?' What people? Do you?" Sherlock asked, frowning, before waving his hand in a sudden act of anxiety. "
The door was locked. Of course. John shouldered at it, trying to get it open and he heard someone curse inside, then-
He afforded a tiny instance of sentimentality by giving the outdated smartphone a brief peck as he settled himself onto the mattress once more.
"Love you," he murmured loudly, as he pulled back slightly from Sherlock's baby-soft, stunned lips.
"S - Sherlock?"
'Please' won't work on me. – JW
"I'd like to...put my fingers inside you."
the next…” He looked back at John deliberately.
"Is that something you think about a lot then Greg?" teased John, nodding as the bartender asked if John wanted another one. "Course he has one, and he's not an alien." John kept his tone light, but the undertone was almost defensive.
Beneath him, Sherlock was falling apart, rutting his own hips wildly through the air, cock slapping wetly against his stomach and huffing through his mouth a series of grunts and moans which made John dizzy to hear.
Sherlock moved back, leveraging himself up onto his expensive leather armchair and smoothed his sweaty palms down his thighs to stop them from shaking. "Don't." He said when he saw John reaching for the small blanket on the back of his own chair, obviously about to cover himself up. "I...I want to see you…while I do it." He murmured, hoping John wouldn't say it wasn't fair that Sherlock got to see him naked and he didn't, etc.
"Oh, god, this is really happening," Sherlock uttered, aqua eyes dilated to a delightful, demonic darkness.
John lowered his voice as a group of their comrades strode by, chatting and ribbing each other. He leaned closer, keeping his hands innocuously by his sides. "Don't worry. It's okay. We've got at least an hour. I found a new spot on patrol...no-one will be going past there again till 2. I'm gagging for it." He murmured, buzzing with anticipation. Shaun chuckled dirtily.
“I fell in love with you yesterday and I didn’t want to.”
pineapples too-" John started, only to receive a withering glare.
.” Sherlock eagerly sank to his knees, John still muttering filthily.
John had enjoyed himself.
John let out a long breath, mouth open but unable to speak. His face was pained, his body curling in on itself. "Please don't think it's you, Sherlock. Please. It's not, I swear."
Sherlock’s crinkly, tired smile widened and he nodded vaguely, an expression of utter bliss on his face.
They quickly spied John's friends who had snagged a large table in the corner and were already drinking and laughing. Sherlock trailed after John, feeling out of place in the crowd, not knowing how to act.
"J-John can we...can we...just a bit more? I'm- I'm nearly there." Sherlock admitted through gritted teeth, thankful for the blindfold so he didn't have to look at John while he said it.
," the DI chuckled, signalling the bartender again.
"For the rest of our lives." John agreed happily, more amused than put-off by Sherlock's description. "Together."
"Left...left me?" John asked, frowning, trying to keep his train of thought while Sherlock discarded his shirt, shimmying his hips to get his wet trousers off.
Sherlock choked again, fingers scrabbling at John's shoulders, scoring red marks across his back and John hissed.
erupt
"Alright." He said, shifting on his feet, leaning heavily on his cane as his leg gave a twinge. "If that's what you - no. Fuck this. Why? The least you could do if fucking tell me why. After all this time- what? Is it someone else?" John demanded, shoulder wound pulling as he heaved in deep breaths.
"I just should have known, that's all. It's fine. It's sweet. It's fine," John soothed him, shivering a little at the delicate scratch of nails upon his sleepy skin.
The detective grimaced, squeezing viciously hard at the base of his cock, but a dormant, hands-free, and painfully drawn-out and lazy orgasm seeped through, unusually unsatisfying.
And tried.
"I don't think
...you can come now."
"Called in the middle of a lover's quarrel, eh?" He asked, clearing his throat and avoiding looking at John. He paced toward Sherlock and away from a clearly simmering John. "Well? Tell me what we've missed."
A single finger swirled through the blood covering his chin and he watched, with disgust, as the man above him sucked the digit into his mouth, slurping at the blood with obvious relish.
! Come on." He drew back the blanket enticingly. "Up you get."
"Hello?" Molly sounded happy, ecstatic, and Sherlock could visualize the huge smile lighting her face.
A mere thirty minutes later, John was being pulled down Baker Street by his hand, stifling a yawn and groggily appraising the cool, dove-grey sky.
Sherlock's eyes dilated. He hadn't realized John had noticed him secreting Molly's lube into his belongings but now he was glad for it. He then flicked his gaze tellingly to the open curtains, where a watery midday light filtered through. "...Right now?"
Suspicion. Lots of it.
The doctor’s thighs were sticky from multiple re-applications of lube, his throat was painfully dry and his breaths shallow, and the anguished frown he wore from being refused an orgasm repeatedly was birthing a headache. His features were wet with perspiration, his skin displayed a dark pink bloom of over-worked and unsatisfied exertion.
"Seriously?"
the way to the living without being able to kiss you."
Sherlock needed to go further, though. Shaun's Facebook posts were telling, but nowhere near as informative as he would have liked.
"Mmmmf." John's noise of agreement ghosted along Sherlock's skin and Sherlock shivered.
"I've had enough." Sherlock announced abruptly, standing with a flourish of his overly heavy, sweat-damp coat. Swiping a long hand across his wet forehead, he fixed John with a dark glare, supplemented with a wordless pout. He kicked the chair he'd been sitting on for good measure before storming towards the exit, re-adjusting his collar to restore the suffocating but comforting woollen barrier between himself and the rest of the world.
"Shit!"
“I know all about the dribbling,” Sherlock scoffed good-humouredly, and suddenly there was an explosion of hot, mint-scented breath against John’s face as Sherlock shuffled closer. “I don’t mind the risk. I like to live dangerously.”
"Will do." He promised, lavishing quick, confident kisses on the soft, white skin of Sherlock's inner thighs. It was overwhelming. White hot heat was rising through his groin, tingling up his spine, constricting his chest and surging through his throat. Sherlock blinked rapidly, trying to parse all the sensations he was experiencing as John stroked his thighs, peppering kisses closer and closer to his erection. Sherlock quivered, eyes wide, tense and waiting...
"Sherlock? Sorry to wake you..." John trailed off as Sherlock sat up in bed, his sheet pooling in his lap, leaving his chest bare and almost glowing in the darkness.
John had made himself very clear, though, on more than one occasion: he thought they should be taking things slow. Unhurried at an almost glacial pace. Sherlock smiled fondly but exasperatedly at his sleeping John. He was grateful John was the way he was...but he didn't want to move as slow as John was suggesting.
"Is that something you're interested in? Dirty talk?"
Sherlock's face contorted in irritation as a delicious, happily apricot coloured London morning sun exposed itself beyond the slightly-grimy kitchen window, showering the flat with intense light. Sherlock blinked against the glare, trying to understand, his face a grim, frustrated portrait, clearly showing an inexpressible anguish over the whole situation.
and he realized he didn't have any lubricant- stupid! He should have bought some- a lot- after the other night but he hadn't thought-
"What, no stir-fry?" Sherlock replied flippantly, letting out an exaggerated, bored sigh. His gaze had already flickered around the featureless room, and had seen no evidence of bladed weapons as yet - the assaults had been purely manual. He subtly continued trying to stretch the tough leather bonds that were currently tethering him, kneeling, to four sturdy rings in the gritty floor.
"Go?" Sherlock's eyebrows snapped together and he gave John a look as if he'd gone mad. "We're not-"
“Are you going to kiss me back this time?”
"Oh." John hummed, taking a bite of his own toast. "I thought you might have injured yourself last night when you snuck into my room for a wank. Dangerous business, that."
Sherlock gave an aborted moan, his erection, which had faded in the face of too many choices, returning in full. He was very much aware of how good it would feel, what John had said, how much he wanted it. "I...yes. That. That’s more than…That is...if you're amenable...I would like that, John."
The pleasure scraped through John with agonising, heady slowness, his own short fingernails raking purchase on Sherlock's ribcage. He had never felt anything quite like it, and the sense of not-quite-enough was stinging him, forcing a litany of gasps and grunts and sobs from his gritted teeth. He had never been this consistently vocal, and he couldn't rein it in. He thudded his sore, hungry cock harder, more inelegantly, inside Sherlock.
"That depends on what you want." Sherlock countered smoothly, tipping his head to the side coquettishly.
"Sherlock. You're stunning. Fucking gorgeous." He shook his head. "How do you not see that?"
“You are in so much trouble, Doctor.”
"Wait, Sherlock. Stop, I...that- all that- has nothing to do with my wanting to change rooms.”
true," John uttered in a broken growl, licking his lips and pressing up against Sherlock, inhaling the other man's gasp of surprise before commandeering his mouth in a tight kiss.
Sherlock glanced around, titillating himself with mini-deductions as he passed through the terracotta-coloured décor and dark gloom of the restaurant, eyeing the billowing candles that were clearly obtained from an inferior Turkish supplier, and the cutlery which had only been through a sub-par dishwasher fifteen minutes ago after the first wash had proved ineffectual. The reason the dishwasher was sub-par was because the owner, recently going through a bitter divorce judging by the arrangement of the tables, hadn't been able to-
"They do not." Sherlock protested, then looked up at John, worried. "Do they?"
a child) or he would reach for the drawer and use a toy.
the detective had said thoughtfully.
Sherlock wiped his streaming eyes which was the result of nearly suffocating on his toast, and breathed deeply, relieved John wasn't angry. "I thought I'd gotten away with it. You were...wait…what do you mean, 'hot?'" he asked indignantly.
She pulled her hand from her cat-print jumper hurriedly, her knuckles catching on the bra strap with a loud 'snap.' Sherlock just blinked at her as she blushed furiously, clearing her throat and trying to tidy herself up.
Sherlock slept like the dead- once he actually
"It's...whenever you're ready, love.”
John frowned, blinking, trying to make his fuzzy brain function. He couldn't have dreamed up all that had happened...He'd not made the whole thing up. That just...he hadn't.
The brunette’s cat-like eyes flashed wider in a shock of aquamarine. A faint, airless pause followed.
“John, what are your opinions on spanking?”
Pausing long enough for Sherlock to note that he was considering lying, John nodded after deciding the truth would be best, "It...crossed my mind."
John didn't know if he or Sherlock was more surprised by his failure to reprimand him for the undeniable intimacy that Sherlock had created, and was sustaining rather gleefully.
Lestrade pulled him back, forcibly flinging John back into the car.
Afterward, John wanked Shaun off, letting him spool onto his hand with a barely discernible grunt and watched, with wide eyes, as Shaun licked his ejaculate from John's palm.
, but...don't you understand what we had, even before all this? I mean..." John exhaled tremulously. "You
"You're amazing." He said, watching as Sherlock's eyes sparkled back at him. "Now, shall we go and view the exhibit, Mr. Holmes?" He asked, offering Sherlock his arm.
John shivered, teeth bared and his lined face squeezed into a picture of agony. "Sherlock...god...Fucking kiss me!" John practically screamed, frightening Sherlock into stillness and silence for a few seconds. He quickly obeyed, falling on John like a wild thing and pressing their lips together, inadvertently grinding his cock against John's prostate. John jerked, screaming against Sherlock's lips as he came. Sherlock struggled valiantly against John's body, which bucked and twisted sharply, loosening Sherlock's station within his lover, his shaft slipping free with the most modest of slippery sounds. He hissed in pain as John's right hand seized a prize of his sweat-damp hair, yanking thoughtlessly as he howled out what appeared to be a terrific orgasm.
John couldn't help but chuckle sweetly, as he lay down, and expounded his instructions as if he were telling Sherlock how to use a new microwave, a playful glint in his eyes and a teasing, fond lilt to his voice. "Well, first we snog a lot. Then you nab Molly's stolen lube, and open me up with your fingers. We’ll take our time with that. And when we're ready...you penetrate me and thrust until hopefully, we both come."
Sherlock's knees gave out.
Sherlock inhaled his bit of toast, crumbs going down the wrong pipe, and coughed so violently, hunching suddenly over the table, that John's smug smile vanished and his doctorly instincts caused him to scramble to Sherlock's side, one hand protectively spread across his back.
"N-no! I want to." Sherlock insisted, trying to force his stubborn body to just relax. He wanted this. He didn't know why he was so nervous. "I want to." He repeated firmly, catching John's hand and pressing it, decisively and insistently, against his groin. His cock had gone a bit soft from nerves, but he hoped the gesture conveyed his message.
"John," Sherlock managed to utter, swallowing again, hypnotised by the sight of his long fingers disappearing into his partner at a rapid, dizzying speed, and, according to John's face, shamelessly and openly expressing his pleasure. "John," he whispered shakily. "Tell me how it feels."
"...Sorry?"
hard.
Sherlock, wriggling just a bit to make John grip him tighter, was more than aware of how his words had affected John. "I did. It was a wonderful face, John. Beautiful. And I wanted the world to know how much I pleasure you-"
Sherlock laughed self-consciously, and was about to pull John down for a 'probably redundant but still enjoyable' mutual orgasm attempt, when John's phone bleeped antagonistically from the bedside table.
“Because you shroud everything in cryptic waffling to stop people actually figuring out what you’re saying. Trying to maintain your mystery and all that.”
Luke grunted, thumbing on Sherlock's mobile. Samuel hissed.
Still, closing the curtains was a must. Near-darkness would make things considerably easier. There was no way he'd be able to do this in any kind of functional light intensity.
His eyes still closed, but with the bright dawn piercing them irritatingly, John groaned and kicked down the bedsheets which felt sweltering. He sighed happily at the cooler air over his body. Satisfied, he nuzzled against the warm flesh beside him, only vaguely recognising that it was a hip he was nosing sleepily, and not a sharp-featured face.
"God, yes...
Shaun shook his head. "No one...ever wanted...oh, fuck Watson. Fuck me." He dropped onto his elbows, changing the angle, and suddenly it was easier for John's hand to slide further inside. Shaun keened.
Then, John had caught a glimpse of Patricia, one of the regular nurses, as his office door swung closed behind one of his patients. She'd been wide-eyed, positively craning her neck to get a look at John as if he were an attraction in a zoo.
"Jesus- fuck!"
"Boyfriend? You're...you're John Watson's
He wasn't going to think of that now, he sternly resolved. He was going to have a nice, relaxing wash and not remember the young man from yesterday. The young man- too young to be dying- whose hand he'd helplessly held as he slipped away after John's best efforts-
Sherlock gave both John and Mrs. Hudson an injured look before stomping downstairs. John hoped he'd gone to get some towels.
John grinned and snapped his fingers commandingly, and the brunette raised his eyes in obedience, pupils dilated, the aqua maelstrom of his irises temporarily burdened with a black lust.
"No, I...yes," Sherlock rushed to explain. "...I'm just a bit...not as good as you." He muttered, in what John thought was probably the most cringe-worthy, yet adorable thing he had ever heard in bed.
"Try me." John almost growled from across the room and Sherlock squirmed, his hand moving faster.
John sighed, relenting, but still embarrassed. "No...you haven't done anything wrong. It's just...well, you get a bit eager and...I want our sex life to stay private, all right, Sherlock? I don't want random strangers knowing what we're buying that...
“Why won’t he just go away?
He knew he shouldn't be in John's room without permission...but he wanted...he wanted
not know this, but you have a G-spot, you know. Right...about...
John gave Sherlock a look from beneath lowered brows, clearly letting Sherlock know he was aware of the childish pout and wasn't going to put up with it much longer. He still clasped Sherlock's hand in his own, towing Sherlock along behind him like a dark, sulking thundercloud in a redundant coat.
With a hefty sigh, John reluctantly turned back to face the man, "I'm not going to apologise. I'm
deeply into the firm flesh of his thighs. Christ, but Watson always knew how to get him going.
Sherlock eyed the man, trying to pick up on any information he could, grasping at straws to find a way to escape. He almost missed the lunchbox...but he already knew what was inside. His stomach sank.
John, stunned briefly into a happy silence, preened at the lazy praise.
Sherlock shifted and pressed their legs together, comparing their knees for a moment or two as he slipped an overly warm arm around John’s bare shoulders, “
"Probably because you're the one who told me to start eating pineapple. I...thought you knew." John trailed off, watching as Sherlock placed one...two…three spiky fruits into their trolley. John stared in utter disbelief as Sherlock scooped up two large armfuls of pineapple and tossed them into the trolley before giving it a brief glance, obviously calculating how many more he could feasibly fit inside it.
"What?" John laughed. "No, Sherlock- I'm talking about our
Today, though, the stare made John want to sink through the floor.
The pieces suddenly slotted into place for John. He sighed, stiffly leveraging himself into a sitting position and peeled the covers back from Sherlock's head.
"Are you ready?"
know what you look like because otherwise you'd know you're fucking beautiful and my cock is so hard I could-"
"Come here." John said- no, Sherlock realized,
“Y…Um…if it’s so troublesome to have my clothes lying around in your Mind Palace, you could always just clean up a bit,” John quipped, trying for humour. It sounded as flat and awkward as it felt.
John shamelessly let his mind wander to where he might be right now, if there hadn't been a case. Perhaps he'd keep Sherlock up all night and see how many orgasms he could give him. And when dawn broke, he'd massage him into a doze and then wank all over his shoulderblades...
– but you just…” He touched his mouth with his fingertips, still stunned and apparently unable to form coherent thoughts or sentences.
...not long...not...oh,
With a muffled laugh, Sherlock wove his arms back around him, kissing John contentedly, “I rather think that was the
"I asked you a question, Sherlock. Apparently you've chosen not to answer," John said, his voice cracking a little and he had to clear his throat before enunciating anything else. He shivered as a piercing lightning strike illuminated the bedroom, casting Sherlock's skin an even more violent blue than his usual, pale translucent flesh allowed. He kept up his barely-there caress of Sherlock's cock, watching with rising need as his love twitched and jerked and strained into the touch like a dying man in his final throes.
“I’m a doctor, for God’s sakes, I know these things.”
“Trust me Sherlock, you are utterly transparent. I’m just choosing to be opaque.” The doctor delivered a few teasing, chaste pecks to the brunette’s plump lips, then paused as the sound of two unfamiliar cars pulling up in the street below, right outside 221B, alerted him to the real world. As he lifted his head, a stagnant, throat-coating London summer breeze pushed through the open window, bringing scents of deep-frying, exhaust fumes and the vague heaviness associated with an overcrowded, overbuilt city.
shouldn't have laughed." He paused and Sherlock listened to John take a deep, deep, deep breath. "I'm sorry."
Sherlock watched John's eyes narrow, sparking as he became just as angry as Sherlock was. Not just as angry, Sherlock thought, there was no way John could feel the level of anger, hurt, and betrayal he was currently experiencing at finding out John preferred his own paltry hand to him.
Choosing not to correct John on Chaucer's real name, letting the jealous epithet stand, Sherlock rummaged in the bag, pulling out handfuls of fabric and tossing them to John. "Those are all for you. I got you more than the one pair. All in silk."
Sherlock quirked a brow. "Only a bit?"
Just as she upped the speed on her vibrator, forcing it inside herself with slippery, almost-numb fingers, she heard a few words from the broken doctor that nearly pushed her over the edge.
to do this?” Sherlock said with a shocked and croaky tone to his voice. “Have
, he thought a bit wistfully, if John would hold him or...or perhaps throw an arm around his middle...but Sherlock didn't want to wake John, was reluctant to disturb him. If he did wake John just to suggest such a thing, it was highly possible John would just get grumpy about it.
wanted. John deserved to get something from all this too.
"I want to convince a man to penetrate me, or, should it take another turn - penetrate another man. The circumstances are irrelevant. Advice on the means to do so would be welcome."
"Good morning, Sherlock." John murmured, voice low and happy. Sherlock could feel his own face burning, and his mind was infiltrated immediately with factoids about arousal, capillary action, and blood flow. Forcibly pushing these thoughts aside, he swallowed hard and his long, pale fingers alighted in John's ash-brown hair for the briefest touch, before he pulled back abruptly. Sherlock's heart was hammering and his mouth was uncomfortably dry. John smelled wonderful- a combination of clean soap, tea, and the spicy scent of the lotion he used to shave with.
“…Yes?”
"Well…I know people sometimes give me presents for no reason. In the summer. It was…recent? " Sherlock queried doubtfully.
"Okay…that's…yeah. Okay, Sherlock." John murmured breathily against the detective's nape. "Let's..uhm…let's do each other. Face to face."
The next few words from Sherlock were emitted so casually that John’s heart took a good few seconds to remember to stop with shock.
"I need to know how to get someone to have sex with me."
"Yes."
John chuckled, blushing a bit, and shook his head before he began to head towards the stairs. “Right, I’m officially leaving that conversation there. You …” He paused, looking properly at Sherlock for the first time, his face settling into a frown that was far too familiar. “What have you been doing?”
His fingers shook as he reached out and took the rose from John, plucking it from his fingers and staring at it as if he'd never seen one properly before.
He grinned into the dark, shaking his head. It seemed he needed to have a talk with Sherlock in the morning.
Sherlock huffed and rolled his eyes- a selfie, honestly, what were they, teenage girls?- but obligingly rose up and caught John's lips in a fervent kiss, distantly aware of the tinny clicking noise which signaled John was taking a picture. John pulled back his phone and broke the kiss, a little abruptly Sherlock thought, slightly irked at the treatment, and he winced as John pushed the screen into his line of sight, his sleepy, pale eyes watering at the bright intrusion.
John bit his lip, giving Sherlock a mischievous look. "Listening to you gasp and moan while you touched yourself...of course it was hot. And then at the end..." He trailed off and Sherlock stared at him, trying to work out if he were being made fun of or not. But no, John was perfectly serious...and if the sudden bulge in his jeans was anything to go by, he was enjoying the memory of last night.
"John...
"Just...just a bit." Sherlock prodded, needing to see John touch himself, feeling like a starving man he was so desperate to see John orgasm. It felt like an obsession.
John didn't need to bend over like that in order to get something on the bottom shelf at Tesco. And he didn't need to
“I’m taking you back.”
"Yes." Sherlock beamed at her. "So...do you have any? I assumed you might own some...forgive me if I'm wrong." He grinned sweetly, fondness and anticipation obvious in his eyes.
John scoffed indignantly. "She's our landlady, Sherl, not your mother."
"Like this?" John wheezed, feeling his own climax approaching, surging hard and fast. "You like this?" He blinked sweat from his eyes and squeezed Shaun's cock. "Gonna come?"
“In as much as I have contemplated sex, there always seems to be penises involved. As opposed to…anything else.”
"Flowing."
Recuperating somewhat, John’s eyes softened and Sherlock’s deep-crinkled grin eased into a sweet smile.
He groaned without thinking when Sherlock tentatively sat down, the detective staring down at the state of his own slick, greedy cock as if he had never seen such a thing before. Sherlock looked up at him with clear, pale eyes and parted lips, before abruptly sucking two long fingers into his mouth and then hooking them between his legs, pushing eagerly and gaining immediate entrance.
"Ok. That's fine." John's voice was brisk and matter-of-fact, his taking-care-of-people voice, and Sherlock let himself relax at the familiar sound and slump back onto the bed, making a disgusted face as the damp sheets clung to his back and legs. "Sherlock...I'm going to change the bed before we sleep. There are enough body fluids on there to fill a pint glass. Try and take the sheets off, okay? I'll be back in a sec."
"Down to your knees." A rough voice ordered an he quickly complied. "Where is he?"
John's scalp prickled, knowing Sherlock was close, and he watched, jerking himself just as fast, wanting to see the moment-
Sherlock reached for the dish on the bedside table, munching on another chunk of pineapple. Between juicy mouthfuls, he managed a few words. "Anyone else of interest?"
Sherlock mashed his lips to John's, kissing him roughly and desperately, backing him up until John's back hit the wall, vaguely aware of the carrier bags dropping soundly to the floor, uncaring when there was a faint clink of glass breaking and a wet sound of something leaking within the plastic bag by John's right foot.
John was gutted and he couldn't choke down his groan of disappointment when Sherlock's stunning body was once again hidden from view. "Sherlock...please, let me see. We can..." he cleared his throat. "We can do it together."
Sherlock scowled as he watched John saunter from the bedroom, displeased that he was already looking for another job. Sherlock had thought he would have the newly - unemployed John to himself for at
Sherlock pushed back instead of answering, clearly impatient, and John took his own hard-as-diamonds cock in his hand, lining up with Sherlock's glistening hole...and pushed. They both moaned when the head popped past the first ring of Sherlock's muscles.
John let his fuming lover direct him, one pale, cool hand seizing his, through what seemed like multitudes of beautifully-appointed, gloomy hallways adorned with the kind of stunning antiquities that John would give anything to own, and that the owner no doubt hardly even noticed, except when the cleaner failed to dust to his specifications.
"I think we need a new rule." John said, smiling ruefully at Sherlock. "You are not allowed to watch porn."
"Right?" Sherlock stuttered as John executed a particularly well-timed squeeze.
"Did you say Rufus Shinra?"
Finally, heaving the sigh of the greatly put-upon, Sherlock weakly reached up and grasped the top corner of the bottom sheet, giving a few half-hearted tugs in an attempt to dislodge it where it was firmly tucked beneath the mattress. His shoulder gave a painful spasm of protest at the movement and Sherlock winced, hissing and going lax against the bed. He'd definitely be sore tomorrow and the idea, instead of making him annoyed, filled Sherlock with quiet delight.
“It’s been seven months. Not ten. You’re exaggerating. As usual,” Sherlock said with a rumbling voice, still sounding somewhat entertained by their conversation. “Interesting to know that your heterosexuality goes out the window after seven months though. Very interesting.”
"We should get back." John finally managed once their laughter had died down. "I'll go first and you wait a few minutes then follow me. Yeah?"
"Oh, I'm sure it'll...perk right back up in a minute." Sherlock said dismissively, not caring in the least if it did or not. Either way, he needed John distracted. "You're...very skilled at doing that." He said, as John started gently stroking his soft cock.
It was always so tedious- and boring- when John got a job and was gone most of the day.
John's footsteps paused for interminable seconds, then started again, this time in the direction of the sofa. Sherlock's heart rate kicked up and every hair on his body seemed attuned to John like a lightning rod.
"…And if you don't come before then...I'll leave you like this." John threatened, voice low and dark, and Sherlock gasped sharply. He couldn't tell if John was lying or not. He didn't think John would leave him without orgasming, didn't think John would be that cruel...but Sherlock also knew he'd behaved badly today…John was angry. It was entirely possible.
Shaun's fingers suddenly gripped his buttocks hard-
Lestrade asked, smirking. And behind him, Mycroft loomed, rolling his eyes.
"My face?" Sherlock asked, squirming against the onslaught of John's kisses, which he trailed across his collarbone and up his neck, teeth nipping at his earlobe, provoking shivers.
In real life, Molly had had similar feelings for Sherlock, and he dealt with them no better than his character. Mostly he pretended he didn’t notice, and sometimes made remarks that made her draw away, looking sad and defeated.
. People are no longer reaching around us to get a quart of milk or a tub of yoghurt. They’re watching us.
“I’m not a little kid,” she replied haughtily. “I’m almost fourteen. And I don’t care if you’re kissing and doing other gay stuff.”
Perhaps I’d been too harsh with the young man. Well, Poor Philip would eventually figure it out.
Everyone turned and looked at him. Molly opened her mouth to reply.
Tonight, I would call to mind all the years we’d been together, remind myself how lucky we were that we had one another.
Watson dropped into his chair with an exasperated sigh. “Who is he, though? Why court the lady and then leave her at the altar?”
Her smile was inscrutable, and a bit smug. “I can guarantee you that no one will forget. And you’ll thank me.”
For Sherlock, it would be a test not only of his acting, but of his impulse control. He wanted badly to put his fist in Brook’s face, but he couldn’t be the one who ruined this. His own career might survive, but it would damage his relationship with his co-stars. Surprisingly, it mattered to him.
what you were doing? Those notes— you were asking me for a
“No brother. Just a sister.”
I wrapped my own dressing gown closer. A bit more harshly than I’d intended, I replied, “What do you want?”
Reminder: John is not dead. Nobody dies. Happy ending ahead.
“It’s Rose. Why did they give me such a stupid name? I think I’m going to change it.” She cocks her head at him just the way John does, barely suppressing a smile. “Your name is Sherlock. That’s an even weirder name than mine.”
“You called me
I wept that night in my cold bed, and wished that John would visit me.
“I’ll see you later,” he says. “Don’t wait up.”
“Why did he do it?” He whispered the words, more to himself than to Molly. “What would push him to that point?”
He smiles. “You sound like my flatmate.”
Emma’s smile grew colder. “Let’s put him in the Red Room.”
How Murray had convinced a female to marry him was a minor mystery as well, one not worth the energy it would take to solve. “Send them something appropriate from us.”
He shook his head. “I want to see you grow up. I never got to, so you must live a long life for both of us. Die when you’re old, Sherlock, when you’ve had a life. I will be waiting.”
"Holmes,” he said. “You have impressed upon me the importance of observation. Though not perfected, the habit is ingrained in me. When I considered what I should say, I knew it had to agree with the evidence.”
“She will not marry for
Sherlock’s eyes move over him, taking in every little detail. “Please,” he says, gesturing to the chair opposite his own. He’s poised for a moment, as if he intends to pull John’s chair out and help him get seated, and John feels his face heat, feeling more than ever like a pitiful old man. Once it’s clear that John doesn’t need help, Sherlock takes his seat.
“So you call your old rehab buddy.”
, and it’s obvious that you’ll have a long and interesting career, if you can settle in and enjoy it. We’re doing this now because we were part of something that many people loved. Those fans grew up with you and John and Molly and Mike, and now have children of their own who have probably watched all the reruns. We’re doing this for them, repaying their loyalty. And for John, who was our colleague and friend. It’s a meant as a tribute to him. He died so young, before we got to see who he would become. We don’t want him to be forgotten, do we? That’s why we do this.”
“I have solved it.” I smiled into my friend’s sightless eyes. The theatrical makeup hadn’t been necessary at all. He wouldn’t have seen even the smallest change in me, let alone the shedding of fifty years. “My longest case.”
“Yes,” I agreed, reasoning that this would be less upsetting than the truth, that it was the skull of a child who had died in an epidemic many decades earlier. “It is there not to excite fear or disgust, but for… research purposes.”
People often tell him that the reason to go to a class reunion is so you can see how much worse other people have done, how much hair they’ve lost, how much weight they’ve gained. It makes you feel better about yourself, he’s been assured.
“Come along, Watson,” I said. “It’ll take us hours to get home at the rate you’re walking.”
He sits, head bowed, and doesn’t speak for several minutes. She waits.
Gesturing at his pyjamas, and perhaps the obvious bulge growing there, John grinned. “I’m not going anywhere, except maybe to bed. Get showered and join me.”
“We argued.” Mary’s voice is tearful. “Well, that’s fairly normal. She went into her room and slammed the door. This morning I had an early meeting. She never gets up that early; I thought she was still in bed. A little while ago the school called to say she’s not in class and they were wondering if she’s ill. I came straight home. Her bed was empty, not slept in.”
“We’ll arrive at the school after dinner time,” Holmes says. “If you want to eat, we should do it before continuing our journey.”
Watson nods. “He said we could just talk. He… I remember the look he gave me, like he felt sorry for me.”
Does he? He understands that he’s going to move in with Sherlock. He’s going to follow him on cases, listen to him spouting off deductions, being rude to everyone, and solving every mystery, brilliantly. It will mean sleepless nights, stupid arguments, a messy flat, endless cups of tea, and a constant stream of snark. He’ll be called
Holmes’s flat is interesting, like the man himself. Even though the furniture is clearly old and worn, the room is less of a tip than last time. It feels comfortable, lived in, like a place you’d feel happy to return to after a day of work, or after a long trip. An eclectic set of furnishings, very bohemian. That’s the only word that describes it; he can almost imagine a Victorian Sherlock sitting in that overstuffed chair with a pipe, his knees drawn up, puffing and furiously thinking about his latest case, blue smoke-rings chasing one another up to the ceiling.
This comment deepened Watson’s blush to scarlet. He cleared his throat. “One learns to be professional. One cannot think of them as ladies when they are in need of care.”
She cooks for him, and while he eats, he explains. She’s a scientist, so his explanation focuses on what he understands of the science. Ageing has always been the problem, the slow decline towards Death. Telomeres, the ends of chromosomes, gradually shortening as the body ages— if that process could be reversed, if cells could continue to divide as they do in a young body, maybe immortality would be more than a cliche in science fiction stories.
He makes tea and eats a piece of toast, looking around his small room.
“Another boy was doing it.”
I didn’t have long to wonder. When he reached the dock, he looked up, scanned the crowd,
“Sherlock Holmes,” he says. “Call Sherlock. He’ll… want to know.”
“Hello, Alex.”
But Sherlock wasn’t sentimental. That was John. If the contest had been about who was going to cry the most when it was over, John could easily win that. He couldn’t walk away from this, though. Not until it was over.
“Why didn’t you?” I ask.
He smiled.
“You have my word.”
“So, he just wandered off the street and got a job personifying diarrhoea?”
His obvious disbelief when he objects,
Tea time comes and goes. When he hears the front bell ring just after six o’clock, he stops playing his violin and listens. Mrs Hudson has opened the door and is speaking to someone, her voice firm, then questioning. Then a male voice answering, followed by her feet on the stairs.
Sherlock hesitated. “I have questions.”
And what would John want? The extent of Magnussen’s abuse wasn’t clear, but it had certainly left scars on John. He came back to London because he was tired of hiding, but that didn’t mean he was ready for a serious relationship. Even if he wanted to be here, he might not be ready for that. He was a victim of abuse. He might not want—
Something tore at him when he saw her holding a gun. Mary couldn’t die— John needed her, and Rosie would lose her mother. Sherlock would have to die so Mary could live. If he’d survived this long only to die like this, it was worth it.
I snorted. “That would rather give away the whole game. No, I plan to get inside her house and find the portrait.”
And you’re friends, as well.” She seemed to be expecting some sort of admission.
Lestrade smiled. “Special occasion?”
He turned so that he could see John’s face. Still unable to tell a lie without giving himself away, he could tell. Struggling with something, he seemed to be reaching a decision about Sherlock, perhaps whether he could trust him or not.
He shrugged. “I have informers in many walks of life. As it happens, I have another target who knows your boy rather
“I think it’s kind of sweet. Your brother, sentiment. Maybe we can set up a blind date for them.”
“Wormwood.” John frowns. “That a mushroom?”
And John took Sherlock’s hand in his, and said, I
Holmes: But I always play your favourites afterwards, Watson. You must admit that's true.
Here’s the thing. I’ve taken two so far, and each time I had one of those dreams, the ones where it feels like I’m awake and Sherlock is there and it’s all real, actually happening. If I had a dozen pills, I would ration them. But I have just one.
Restless, Holmes sits in the chair opposite, folds his hands to keep them still. He’s not sure what he’ll do when Watson leaves again. That must not happen.
“I will take you away,” I said. “I don’t yet know where I’ll put you, but I won’t let them dig you up.”
“It’s wish fulfilment,” she said. “We give viewers what they want, and they stop watching. I suppose sales of
John could see who the loser was going to be. As he danced with Sherlock, saw him smiling at him with such love, he hated that it wasn’t real. But it was too late. He had to go through with it, even if Sherlock wasn’t serious about any of it.
He smiles around a mouthful of eggs. “I might need a nap before that happens. Is that all right?”
“Go away.”
Just a quick intake of breath. When she let it out, it was gone. She’d never actually been jealous of John Watson, and at that moment she’d actually felt sorry for him.
But this is not a fantasy. There is something mutual here.
“They see it that way, and Henry knows.”
“Good. Yeah, I’d like that.”
“Oh, do come along!,” I chided. “Our suspect is away and his staff are abed. We must get in and out quickly.”
“Well, we won’t ever know, will we? Unless you and Mike already have our second date planned.”
He opens the door of his flat and flicks on the light. It’s home, or what has been passing for home these last months. Almost a year, he thinks, since he was wounded, since everything changed.
“What did you tell him about me?”
“Mister Watson!” The older man exclaimed. “No— it’s Doctor Watson now, isn’t it?”
“Might have been— what?”
“We’ll see. He’s busy right now on a case. Maybe when that’s done.”
“Right. Well, I doubt the showrunners would do that, but if it happens, I’m fine with it.”
Holmes: Everything escapes you, my dear Watson. I'm afraid that your conclusions are invariably erroneous. When I said that you stimulated me, I meant, to be frank, that in noting your fallacies I have occasionally been guided towards the truth.
“I made an inference. Molly is not very social, and most of the people she knows are doctors. And you must have trained at Barts with Stamford.”
Your voice shakes.
John gives up. “Fine. What don’t you know about me?”
“In chemistry class. You made fun of me because I was failing and told me to come to your room if I wanted help. You helped other people cheat. I was just wondering if you would have done the same for me.”
“Civil partnership,” the detective replied. “All the signs are here, Greg.“
“You’re not a freak—“ he interjects.
“The tattoo parlour?”
So it ends, again.
He feels John arch towards him, his mouth opening to Sherlock’s tongue. He places his hand behind John’s head, bringing them closer. Soon their bodies are pressing against one another, and Sherlock can feel the answer to his question. He wants to be every romantic cliche for John, to invent entirely new ways to love him.
“I don’t really want to.”
Until then, I needed to establish myself in some profession so I could afford to live.
But I had trouble deducing him. There are people, like my brother, who are able to spot a gay person at a hundred yards. This is called gay-dar. For all my observational skill, I do not possess this ability. While I could spot Afghanistan and the alcoholic sibling and the psychosomatic limp, I could not tell whether he fancied men or women. He looked at both with equal interest. Bisexual, perhaps. He did tell Mrs Hudson that
“She’s a teenaged girl who has just found a tool with which to bludgeon her mother. Of course she’ll want to stay in touch.”
“Is this a complaint?”
“I think not,” he said, glaring at the box. “Unless the box is of interest for some reason, he can save himself a trip.”
in the place where she works
There’s never a good time to have this conversation, but it has to happen soon. He doesn’t want to upset this contentment, though. He just wants to sit here, pretending things are as they used to be, Sherlock and John silently having tea together. Of course he wants more. He wants John to call him
He gives a small huff of incredulity. She knows that he’s not doubting her. It’s that he can’t believe himself, that he didn’t see this coming. He’s in love with John, as any fool can see. But for all his observational skills, Sherlock has no idea how much John cares for him, never expected him to grieve so deeply.
Sherlock had been grumpy and languid when he had left, dribbling onto his pillow endearingly, and John had ruffled his hair and made his way out. He might not have otherwise bothered, but since Sherlock was seemingly so thrilled at having an 'anniversary' to celebrate, he thought he had better do his bit and pick up some supplies and a few knick-knacks.
Sherlock gulped. "Yes." He kissed John again, pressing his lips as hard as he could against John's, wanting to convey how much John meant to him and how very much he wanted him. They snogged indulgently for a few minutes and just as Sherlock eased back, determining this was probably violating John's definition of "waiting"… John sighed and pushed Sherlock forcefully back against the wall.
," Sherlock said almost inaudibly, scowling in frustration. "Want to see what..." he paused, and cleared his throat, shuffling slightly on the rumpled bed. “What your second orgasm looks like.”
"I'm proving a point."
"I'm...god, was that too much? I'm sorry I don't know what I was...look, you can hold the bag in front of you until we get a cab and I-"
“Stop being annoying,” Sherlock said in reply with a sullen tone, storming over to try and both snatch the cracker from John’s hand and flick off the paper crown.
Ten minutes later, Sherlock was writhing, his lean legs trembling violently as they rested on his doctor's shoulders. He sat on the edge of the sofa, John kneeling on the floor between his jerking legs, holding them apart with considerable effort and teasing him with the tip of his tongue.
John's face crinkled delightfully as he chuckled. "I think it's probably time to go home. What do you think?" Without waiting for a response, he turned, downed his lukewarm vodka shot, and then planted his hands upon Sherlock's slim hips.
He blinked away a body-heated droplet of sweat as he winced with a selfish pleasure at the sound of the taller man's voice rising in inadvertent octaves behind him.
"I wanted you in every possible way." John murmured, ducking his head and giving the other nipple the same treatment. "I loved you...before...then...now...I probably always will." He admitted, raising back up so he could seal their lips together again. "You're...you're...part of me." He whispered against Sherlock's lips, flushing at the incredibly stupid, sappy way that sounded but he didn't know how else to say it, didn't know how else to convey to Sherlock how much he had wormed his way into every facet of John's life, leaving behind an indelible mark.
Knowing Sherlock was close, that his shaky, out-of-rhythm thrusts were drawing to a close, beckoned John's own orgasm that much closer. He whined, thrusting into Sherlock's fist as rapidly as he could.
"It looked like flirting to me."
- which had nagged at John's mind all morning.
Sherlock watched John's dressing gown fall and a devastatingly-naked John bend and flex to pull on his underwear, jeans, and the striped jumper that Sherlock would never admit he actually adored.
They’ll have to go to the shops if they want to make the chicken thing, with the vegetable things, and that sounds like too much effort. They open a packet of flatbread and slice some of the cheddar that isn’t hosting a mould experiment. Sherlock finds a bunch of grapes that are not very shrivelled.
Through the crowd of bustling travellers, I can see Mycroft Holmes, sitting in a coffee shop. That’s not what startles me. Mycroft in an airport is nothing out of the ordinary. He must travel a lot. His face isn’t well known, so he doesn’t worry about being spotted, doesn’t need an entourage of handlers and assistants. Maybe he has a bodyguard, probably that solid-looking bloke at the other table who’s pretending to read a newspaper.
But John Watson was most definitely not gay. By the last year of the show, he was dating female stars, a new one every month, which created even more media frenzy. In spite of the attention, he seemed a bit embarrassed by all the fuss, and certainly hadn’t put on any airs when they were filming episodes.
His hand shakes a lot now, and it looks like he’ll never lose that souvenir of Helmand. Nerve damage, limited mobility. Even if he were tall enough to reach the top shelf, that arm won’t raise above his shoulder. And his leg aches, but nobody knows why. It might be in his head, but the pain is real.
“Oh, who cares about the girl!” I slumped back in my chair. “Perhaps you’d rather I went through with it, just to honour my promise to her.” At Watson’s horrified look, I laughed. “No fear of that happening. I have a hated rival for her affections, who is ready to cut me out the minute my back is turned. She will fall into his arms and have forgotten the name Escott before the week is out.”
John gave another glance at his phone, then glanced at the door, making sure it was shut and locked. He sighed. "God, Sherlock. I bet you're so hard right now. You've been wanking ever since I let the flat, haven't you? I can hear it in your voice. I can hear...hear how desperate you are. You're gagging for it, aren't you, love?"
? Why?” Sherlock asked, though he was barely paying much attention. His face was slackening and tightening with quickening ripples of pleasure while he writhed his hands to grip and twist the bed covers between and under his fingers. The blush of arousal had now travelled down his body. It splattered his entire chest, half of his stomach, his pelvis, and the inside of his thighs in a rich adorable pink.
. I didn't think it would be...so..." John laughed breathlessly, running a hand through Sherlock's wild curls and scrunching them gently in his fist.
Sherlock glared at Mycroft, hesitating before thumbing out a message and sending it.
Sherlock shuddered, watching their entwined hands working over his cock- but his legs gave a violent wobble, his knees threatening to buckle, and he gave John a plaintive look. "...N-Not here...bed...please," Sherlock murmured with a deliciously choked baritone. He swallowed thickly once more, his grey-green eyes flickering. "I can maybe...try in bed."
"Well, it's only been true for a week." John admitted, hips shifting on the bed as he watched Sherlock's fingers splay against his clothing. "Still not used to it." he huffed out a quick breath, digging his fingers into the duvet to keep from reaching and freeing his cock from the confines of his jeans to hurry things along.
"You're not
"Have you...done that before?" The detective croaked, clearing his throat and sitting up against the plump pillows, glancing down at his still-tremulous muscles with fascination, before dragging the sheet from the lilo to cover his modesty.
Sherlock gratefully kissed him. "I thought you only wanted to have sex."
"Well. I'll just...erm.."
A lazy, drawn-out hum answered him. "Yes, John." Sherlock sounded either drunk or almost on the brink of sleep. John smiled affectionately, wishing he were there to see Sherlock all boneless, debauched, and post-coital. Sherlock always got lazy after he came and John enjoyed snuggling with his detective during those times.
"You don't...mind?"
"We've kept the crime scene intact for you. Thought you'd need to take a look."
"If you want me naked, strip me." John replied simply, lips moving down the column of Sherlock's throat and latching onto a pale section of skin, suckling at it gently. Sherlock's skin broke out in shivers and he fumbled at the buttons of John's shirt. The round discs slipped between his fingers, elusive and seemingly beyond his shaky control. John's sensual attack on his neck- now the other side- making Sherlock wonder if he would have a matched pair of bruises- wasn't helping, was leaving Sherlock scattered and lost. Finally, knowing John was distracted, Sherlock quietly snapped off the buttons from John's shirt as he went, catching them in his hand and pocketing them as stealthily as he could.
They both woke embarrassingly late the next morning, in an overheated, tangled cocoon of duvet, intertwined awkwardly with each other and glued by a gossamer-thin layer of sweat. Both men were stubbornly ignoring the cool, bright sunshine searing through the open curtains, desirous of a bit more darkness, but neither willing to actually move and do something about it.
is centred on penetration after all. Pleasure can be garnered through several other—”
There were a few minutes of pleasant quiet, the London-tasting breeze cooling the room with intermittent gusts, the TV humming away.
"You are! Maybe not in a classic sense. In the way the rest of society thinks of and defines beauty. Your nose is too big. And you have grey hair. And there are lines and wrinkles on your face. But," He desperately said, watching John's smile melt away, "I think you're...you're the most gorgeous, stunning man I've ever met."
"Take that as a yes." John said wickedly. He stripped off his jeans the rest of the way, tossing them to the side, and peeled off his shirt, tossing it cheekily to Sherlock. "Well? Going to get undressed yourself? Or are you wanting to be clothed when you fuck me?"
“You’re not helping yourself with puerile jokes like that, John.”
wet. It's like a...well, it's
Sherlock nodded but then gave him a rough squint, “We…we
"It's all right." John murmured, pressing Sherlock's face harder against his stomach, hiding his tears because he knew Sherlock wouldn't want anyone from the Yard seeing him so vulnerable. "Whenever you're ready, I'll take you home."
"Remember what? You stealing a bloody plasticised baboon liver from the museum- no, Sherlock, I don't remember that." John strode further into the kitchen to peer at the thing. "How'd you even get it out of there?"
John fists clenched, and the resulting jolt of pain in his left arm did absolutely nothing to ease his vitriolic mood. Buzzing with frustration, he glanced at the bedside table and growled quietly at seeing nothing breakable, nothing to create the sort of cathartic, audible crash of destruction that might appease him enough not to just slap the childish detective sharply round the head and be done with it.
"Perhaps you were the wrong person to..." Sherlock lingered on the words, still watching the smaller woman practically squirm under his presence.
flat is okay with me, are you?”
Sherlock skulked at the doorway to the kitchen. The smell of frying bacon (organic, streaky), sausage (artisan, rare-breed) eggs (omega-3 enhanced) and mushrooms (English-farmed buttons) was alluring, was almost enough to pull him further into the room. But he remained lurking in the doorway, unsure…until John stunned him by turning to him with a massive, fond grin, a greasy spatula in hand.
There followed a long thirty seconds of swollen silence and Sherlock's laboured breathing. "...What did you want?" He asked, sounding distinctly troubled and irritable. John shrugged.
John panted, his face wrinkled with the exertion of multiple orgasms, his thin lips parted to suck in the cool, home-tasting air of the bedroom, and his bare, damp chest heaving.
gingerly inserted his long-fingered right hand into his pyjama bottoms. He gulped as he touched himself, wincing with a mixture of distaste and arousal as his fingers and thumb detected his own warm, slick, traces of pre-come.
"Sherlock, I've explained to you over and over again. It's not you, for fuck's sake. Just give me some time."
John fought back a chuckle. Only Sherlock could make an official, life-long commitment sound so clinical.
"Maybe we should go." John murmured quietly, not wanting to draw attention to them. Sherlock's eyes narrowed as he stared at the gang of young men now only a few yards from them. A swastika tattoo decorated the side of one's neck, while various other ones sported symbols affiliating them with a well-known gang which had been the perpetrators of a string of burglaries, murders, and drug trafficking. Sherlock had seen the file at Lestrade's behest. Not that these men were the ones who'd done such things. But they
"I- I...behaved badly during lunch with your parents." Sherlock stuttered, trying to make his brain work so he could apologize effectively. "Unforgivably so. Horribly. I shouldn't have said what I did. I'm s-sorry." Sherlock flinched hard when John enveloped the head of Sherlock's aching cock in his mouth and swirled his tongue around the head, making fresh pleasure burst inside Sherlock's body. "
I'm sure you are. I'm not coming to help you. I can be as stubborn as you. – JW
"So I can do incredibly naughty things to you."
"You're a fucking bastard, Sherlock." John hissed, eyes narrowed in anger. "Selfish and ever only thinking of yourself. You
"Well, that's understandable considering I haven't had a shag in ten months. Mostly due to you. What can I say, I'm craving intimacy," John snorted, eyes closed and feeling less sleepy, but still relaxed. "And if you insist on staying here, don't complain if you get molested."
The bathroom door immediately opened and Sherlock emerged, looking both hopeful and surprised. "You do?" His eyes raked down John's body and a tiny line formed between his eyebrows. "I thought twice in one day would've been your limit, John. A man of your years typically has a slower refractory period…but it seems I've misjudged."
_-_-_-_
He was barely listening to anything that was being said. There was no
John sullenly did himself up as well, smearing sweat from his forehead. Shaun was on his way out when John grabbed his hand in a gesture that couldn't be misconstrued as anything except romantic, and gave him one final, intense kiss.
"Thank you. That was...if I hadn't already been knackered that would have been...."
"What?" John asked, pulling away and Sherlock yanked at him again, sending John sprawling on top of him on hands and knees.
Sherlock huffed another minty breath against John’s face in exasperation, “You caught me. That was my plan all along,” He sarcastically drawled as he pulled his hand away. “Why would I do that, John? – You’re being absurd.”
Sherlock followed John's anxious gaze with a bemused frown, wondering what the problem was. "Have..." he swallowed and looked fittingly awkward and contrite, like a dog which has learnt what constitutes bad behaviour but had given in to temptation nevertheless. "...have I done something…wrong?"
"I want him to hear us. Goddammit, Sherlock." John breathed.
here?" John couldn't stop his emotions from mirroring Sherlock's sarcastic bitterness, mostly because he felt Sherlock's attitude was uncalled for and he was getting a little fed up of the petulant child act.
"Life would be simple if my 'fancies' extended merely to breaking into your fridge, Mrs. Hudson. I have an emergency. It requires maternal advice."
John grinned to himself and stretched, before thumbing through his apps, wanting to entertain himself with something cheery before he went back to sleep, to try and prevent him falling back into the same nightmare. It worked sometimes. It depended on how bad things had been, how distracting the apps could be.
John leaned in again, grinning, his indigo eyes slightly unfocussed after he had moved onto shots from his beers. "You need to piss. You should probably go," he chuckled.
John mewed out a little confused noise, insistently bumping his bare backside against Sherlock. “Sherl? Why’d you stop? You were just getting to the good part,” and the dirty smirk was evident in his voice, even though his face was muffled by the warm pillow.
Alcohol had been involved, that was for sure. Quite a lot of it, in fact. But that didn't change the fact that, after seven weeks, this particular scenario had played out in John's head so many times it was practically imprinted on his retinas.
. I'm...so close but...I can't...can't...unnng."
"Please, John." Sherlock crooned, pasting on his best innocent expression when John's eyes opened, glazed and slitted in pleasure. "Please, will you come on my face?"
The first push of a slick finger in his arse made John gasp and arch. It didn't hurt. Surprisingly. Not in the slightest. Shaun's eyes glittered, black and playful, above him as he wiggled his digit in John without finesse but still managing to catch his prostate. Stars exploded in John's vision. In his inebriated state, John decided now was a perfect time to ask the questions he had been putting off for nearly two months. And if it wasn't, well, sod the consequences. His voice slurred as he tried to enunciate through too much whisky, laying in an unusual position in a desert war zone, and the fact of a strong, knowledgeable finger up his arse.
Afterward, they sat in silence in Molly's bright, cheery sitting room. At least, John had described it to Sherlock as bright and cheery but Sherlock remained dubious. There were pictures of cats on the wall.
He frowned and turned to John. "What was that for?"
He revised that idea when the belt whistled through the air and cracked- stingy and sharp and painful- against his arse. This wasn't going to be very good.
"Come on." John stood just as the one who had been peering into the water had a foot planted against his arse by one of his comrades and he was kicked into the lake, followed by a few bottles flung with surprisingly accuracy when his head resurfaced. Swearing extravagantly, he pulled himself from the lake on wobbly legs, swaying, rivers of tepid water pouring off of him.
"Webcams?"
Sherlock swallowed heavily. "Whatever you want."
Sherlock frowned after him, with half a mind to not even go downstairs just to be petty. Except...he nibbled his bottom lip. If he went downstairs with John, he could keep asking his questions.
John gasped, his fingers spasming in the duvet as he cursed. "Fuck...Sherlock..."
John swallowed heavily, feeling a distant pulse of arousal which he suppressed. Now wasn't the time- they were both knackered. "Yeah. Of course…. Do you think of me when you use that gigantic beast?"
“…’Use as much of me as you can?’” The suggestiveness slipped like syrup from John’s thin lips, the emanating implications so strong that Sherlock could practically taste the sex-scented sweetness in the back of his own throat.
John winked. "I'll be gentle."
"I suppose it's too much to ask that you hold my hand on the way to the sticky, beer-stained, eight-year-old, wobbly, Tunbridge Wells-bought table," Sherlock muttered in John's ear, barely audible as a table of men dressed in rugby shirts started singing a loud, very vulgar song.
John flinched at the inquisitive, violin-calloused fingertip that began dotting and delicately stroking across his exposed glans. He swallowed hard, watching Sherlock's fingers run softly along his cock, again and again, the barest of teasing caresses. John's cock twitched its way to full hardness- the sight of Sherlock on his knees, all his concentration centered on his cock doing things for John's libido which were dark and sinful. Sherlock's eyes were fixed, with almost scary concentration, on every little pulse of blood in the veins of John's rapidly-hardening shaft, every minuscule ooze of clear fluid at the tip, every unconscious bob of the plump dark member. It was unnerving.
“What’s cryptic about wanting to sleep?” Sherlock asked with a quirk of one eyebrow, expression unchanging from its annoyed state as he continued to stare at John, eyes lidded drowsily. He sighed irritably after several seconds more and shifted his position with a bounce of the mattress, jostling John. “Go back to sleep, John.”
close," he illustrated, holding his finger and thumb a little apart. "One or two more inches would literally have been enough."
"...John...I don't want you to talk about...about the other people. Your…your
"Amazing, isn't he?" John murmured to Lestrade good-naturedly. "Ignore his attitude. He didn't get enough sleep," he grinned, and the naked lasciviousness on his face was impossible to misinterpret.
Sherlock let out a soft breath of relief when John turned the water off and stepped out, getting their fluffiest towel to dry Sherlock with.
Sherlock wordlessly reappeared, his arms full of towels, and Mrs. Hudson took one, spreading it ineffectually on the soaked floor.
." This time, he was entirely certain what caused the convulsive shiver down Sherlock's spine.
Sherlock held the half-empty bottle up to the weak light and watched the thick liquid swirl slowly within. Extending his left hand, he pumped a little of the flavoured lubricant onto the tip of his index finger, sucking it ponderously. He hummed, contemplating the flavour. "Nice. Cherry-flavoured is rather pedantic, predictable, but it will serve our purpose." He smiled at John. "I wouldn't want to use it when I sucked your cock, though. It would ruin the lovely flavour of your penis."
-nine,' Sherlock and yeah, I'd be up for it if I were...'up' for it. It's just...I was soft and...All that stimulation...with nowhere for it to go...got me a bit wound up is all. It'll go away, though."
John was surprised by a long, hard hand covering the bottom half of his face, smothering his mouth. Grey-green eyes, doubtful, curious, and hopeful, transfixed him, as did the plump, open cupid's bow lips, the ice-white skin, and the supernatural cheekbones.
"You didn't think this through at all, did you?"
Except…
Shaun took the choice out of John's hands, turning around and crowding up against him, slipping a wet hand down between them and wrapping it around John's prick. John gasped, eyes flaring wide, and Shaun smirked. John had no choice but to grip onto him in what looked like an embrace to stop himself slipping, falling, and breaking his neck in a piss-stained barracks shower. He averted his face, resting his chin on Shaun's shoulder so that the other man wouldn't be able to watch his expression as he came. Which, he knew, was imminent - the Irishman certainly knew what he was doing and was employing a series of dizzyingly-good moves that pushed John closer and closer.
Sherlock cocked his head to the side, eyes flicking over John's face, clearly debating.
thoroughly.”
would have heard me, Sherlock thought, but shoved the thought aside. He still felt weak from his orgasm, limbs nicely trembly and loose, but already his mind was whirring, turning to the idea of reciprocating, of doing that to John. Still in the process of getting his breath back, Sherlock self-consciously re-adjusted his pyjama bottoms, dismissing his discomfort at the drying, rapidly cooling semen within them. Standing on wobbly legs, he made a quick mental recap of how porn...'people' pleasured others with their hands. Recalling John's admonishment, he decided not to say a single word during the act.
"John, it's-"
"That won't be a problem. I've come to talk to you, if I may?" Sherlock cleared the distance in a few long strides, gesturing to the chair opposite Molly.
John smiled at his breathless anticipation, kneeling up and steadying himself between Sherlock's legs, placing the head of his cock at Sherlock's entrance.
"Were you embarrassed, John?" Sherlock smiled innocently at his angry lover as he got up and sailed past him, unconcerned, into the kitchen to continue working on his experiment. "I hadn't noticed. I don't know that I said anything wrong or out-of-the-ordinary."
"Few times." Shaun grunted. "Been wanting to bugger you for bloody weeks." He added another finger and John's body, relaxed from too much alcohol, easily opened to accommodate him.
John finally relented and leaned down, shouldering Sherlock's damp thighs and grasping Sherlock's buttocks, hauling him upward as he leaned down, sucking Sherlock's cock into his mouth. Sherlock emitted an undignified, shuddery, high-pitched groan, and his muscles all clenched violently. He howled when John began sucking him earnestly, wasting no time, no more teasing, seemingly determined to get Sherlock off as fast and as soon as possible. And Sherlock, shaking and crying out, careered at break-neck speed towards his orgasm.
“And you’re being tiresomely childish,” Sherlock complained and tried to pull his hand away with a half-hearted glare.
Sherlock's features darkened in discomfiture, and he swallowed, his succulent pale throat bobbing. "No John, your…your tongue, in … …I saw it on the internet," he murmured, gesturing one long, pale hand towards his crotch.
Sherlock was reclining on the sofa, his breathing slightly laboured from both prior exertion, and the hot fumes of the cigarette on which he now sucked luxuriously. As soon as he had returned to the flat, he had stripped his pleasantly-aching frame of damp clothes, and eased on his cold pyjamas, which he had put in the fridge before leaving that morning. Now, forty-five minutes and three cigarettes later, he closed his pale eyes and hummed contentedly to himself. His rare jaunts, when he ventured on them, always drained him in the most delightful way imaginable, and the shivery aftermath was one of the few times he would happily give in to utter indolence.
"It's not appropriate-"
"Well...I know you're going to...squirrel all this away because you don't understand it, and it's going to bug you, and you're going to dwell on it, but can you do me a favour and try not to ask too many questions? Just know that something I...planned went a bit...well, quite a
"If you don't cheer up, there's going to be one in this flat," John muttered darkly, wincing at a particularly deafening bang, as a firework seemed to explode directly above the building.
"It feels a bit...wrong," John muttered, regretting his admonition to Sherlock two days previously. He was the one who had insisted on accepting the invitation to Lord Ingram's party.
“Anyway, those things cost a fortune,” John said airily, scrolling through his emails. “You might be flip with your money but you’d be more likely to, I dunno, borrow someone else’s. You’d be too lazy to set it up yourself, and you wouldn’t ask me to do it.”
He turned his phone off, tossing it to the side, and nestled in alongside John, burrowing into his chest and breathing in his sleep-warm smell. He wouldn't have this for days...he intended to make the most of it.
The ashen-haired army doctor gritted his teeth as he gave a sharp, unexpected grind against Sherlock's bare, vulnerable, desperate shaft.
Deciding to leave his shirt on- John hadn't said taking it off was a requirement to getting his cock sucked- Sherlock's fingers popped open the button and dragged down the zip of his trousers…but he made no further move. His face tingling and burning with the effort of his anxiety and arousal, Sherlock swallowed, voice breaking in a way that John found irrationally irresistible. "...You...might not like it?"
Sherlock gasped, going rigid, and his cock twitched, trying valiantly to get hard.
That was until John caught him well...with his hands on another soldier.
“I’m already marrying you, you daft twat,” John replied fondly, mussing his detective’s wet and wilted curls.
Sherlock rang the bell again.
John, though, pulled away and reached for the lube he knew Sherlock kept hidden in the bread box. He unclicked the cap as he reached between Sherlock's arsecheeks-
"You know what? I agree with
Sherlock, squirming on the mattress, torn between wanting to strangle John and hoping he was coming back to finish him off, watched as John made his way closer to the bed, his eyes trained on his mobile.
Sherlock bit his lip, frowning worriedly, wondering what to do. He didn’t know how to make the suddenly horrible situation between himself and John better. He was never good with these sorts of things.
"What- Sherlock, that's not it at all." John stressed, anger suddenly wilting in the face of Sherlock's argument which, if taken at face value, meant he’d hurt his boyfriend, made him feel unwanted. "You still...uh...fulfil me."
Pen. – SH
John huffed a small, private laugh at the thought of Sherlock as any kind of animal - 'cute and furry' would not be the immediate adjectives.
!" John managed, snickering wheezily as his fingers tightened in Sherlock's damp ringlets. "...Ah, God, I'm close.
He glanced at the time on the laptop. He had approximately half an hour before John came back from his irritatingly routine morning food shop.
"That. On your arm." John nodded at the small cut on Sherlock's exposed arm, the skin around it discoloured by a bruise.
"The...but he does the evening news." John whooshed out a breath. "I need that drink."
John was not amused.
"Patience, Sherlock." John intoned, shoulders stiff as he pivoted around. His eyes slid over Sherlock before he turned away, throat bobbing. "I'm going to fix dinner," he muttered. "Why don't you go and shower?"
"John." Sherlock's voice was rough with sleep and he rubbed his eyes, yawning. "Are you wanting morning sex?"
Sherlock beamed with a gorgeous, malicious grin, and turned to pat John, who was still wheezing, on the back. "Oh, yes...he does grow. Or I mean, he
"I am sorry, Sherlock." John repeated, watching Sherlock twirl the flower between his fingers.
Sherlock shuddered, a crack in his control showing, and the way his eyes fluttered when he added another finger made John moan. Color suffused Sherlock's face and traveled down his chest, staining his pale skin and John could see his chest heaving with suppressed breaths as he tried to stay calm.
"I thought you said you'd always come and save me," Sherlock mumbled distantly against John's throat, nuzzling him vaguely for comfort.
It’s on the desk. – SH
"Well then. Now." He nodded and gave John a tentative smile, eyes skittering to the tent in John's boxers and then quickly away.
Making use of his most manipulative acting abilities, Sherlock grinned his crinkly grin and ruffled his newly-short, soaked dark curls, before placing a hand on Molly's upper arm, leaning close to her. "I'm sorry for this inconvenience. I wouldn't have asked if I didn't really need help."
“Go, Holmes— I’m for it!”
He’s grinning, taking off his jacket and hanging it on one of the kitchen chairs. “Are you throwing a party, Sherlock?” He nods at Lestrade, gives Mycroft a tiny scowl.
“Look,” demands Sherlock. “You see, but you don’t observe.”
John has grown used to the highs and lows, but some days it would be nice if there were a note, just a small hint as to what he ought to do about dinner. They don’t have an organised plan for who cooks on what nights. Sometimes they cook together; sometimes John cooks. And every now and then, Sherlock creates something amazing.
Mycroft shook his hand again and patted his shoulder. “You always surprise me, Doctor Watson.”
“If I am as clever as you suggest, I would have disposed of them. Now, allow me to at least see Dr Watson, to make sure that you haven’t been mistreating him.”
Feeling a warm hand on his forehead, he nuzzles into it. He’s having a lovely dream, one where his head is in John’s lap and John is running his fingers through his hair.
She’s pursing her lips, studying him with the same intensity that he’s inflicting on her. She knows him well, probably better than he’s ever known her.
I set the bottle on the coffee table. “We were never,” I begin.
Sherlock raises one eyebrow, but invites him in. Crossing the threshold, he leaves his things by the door. He’ll take them upstairs later. Or maybe he won’t have to.
“You have me. And I still need my boy.”
Existence will continue, but the life he built for himself has been destroyed. All is lost. Soon he will be arrested, charged with the death of James Moriarty. He will be sentenced to life in prison, outlive the prison that confines him, and become a mystery to be solved. He will be studied, like a specimen.
“What made you want to kill yourself?”
It’s a philosophical consideration, but also a personal one. For Sherlock, it never has been necessary before, but now it seems like the burning question. It isn’t as if he can walk away. They share a flat. He can’t avoid seeing John. And he finds he doesn’t want to. He wants this to work, all of it.
Frowning, he realised that he’d made a mistake. The bedroom door was
Sherlock smiles. “You’re assuming it was a man.”
A gut feeling might be wishful thinking. Or it might be what he remembered one of his professors describing:
“Of course not, dear,” said Mrs Hudson. “We all love you.”
“Come here, you romantic seductor… deductor... deducer…,” John says, grabbing his dressing gown. “I deduce that you are seducing me.”
“It isn’t that simple, Harry. This isn’t a phase, something I’m going to grow out of. I can’t just—“
He needs to know what to do. His gift is not solving puzzles, it’s triage, seeing the options and making a choice. Shooting an enemy, saving a friend.
“No.”
But the insults did not stop and I could not always ignore them, though I tried. My pride would not let me accept their words. I did not understand why Edwin always called me
Angelo returns with a candle, gives John a thumbs up, and walks away.
“Oh, my, yes!” said Bellamy. “I’ve read your stories in the Strand, my boy. A very exciting life you lead, for a doctor.”
They don’t really talk. They discuss cases, and dinner, and what needs to be picked up at the shops. They don’t even talk much during sex. With Mary, he much preferred letting things go, not confronting them, but now he can see how that’s worked out, and he’s not willing to let Sherlock drift away as Mary did. What’s happening between them is a result of not talking. That’s what Jay Eccles said.
“What do you suggest?”
He laughed. “You have deduced wrongly.”
After dinner they watch a show about gangs in Victorian London. Sherlock has seen it before, and hopes John will find it interesting. John is more apt to choose reality shows, which Sherlock finds boring. Compromise is necessary, he thinks, but maybe he can find something they both like. John likes history; Sherlock likes crime.
“Thank you,” Holmes says. “Your questions were helpful.”
His phone buzzed. Without thinking, he looked at the screen.
They all admitted that they hadn’t seen an actual ghost. I hadn’t either, and had begun to form an theory on this subject. I’d seen what happened to bodies after death, and knew that Nature takes things apart, bit by bit. Nothing is lost, except whatever it is that we call the
“I still don’t understand,” she says.
“But,” he says. “But…”
“What?” Watson looks around. His eyes are bleary, but the place looks just as it did when he left for the pub. “I tidied up.”
I’m thinking about him anyway; I may as well sleep in his bed tonight.
“Yeah, I guess. I’m rubbish at being gay.”
“I think we should call the police,” she says.
“Look, I think we need to talk,” John says. “We haven’t been communicating very well, and I, erm, want to talk about… things.”
“I know. But sometimes you forget to eat, and it affects your mood. Blood sugar, you know.”
“I was married. I loved Mary when we… well, by the time she was pregnant and we got married, there were problems. But I just assumed that all marriages are like that. My parents fought constantly. I think my dad had affairs, too. But I never cheated on Mary. I just found myself… thinking about… well, looking at men. And it wasn’t like waking up and realising,
But Sherlock will have to wait; first he has to do something about Rosie. Locating her before she gets into any trouble is his priority. With any luck, she’s off somewhere pouting, maybe the library. Where does she go with her friends? Where does she feel safe? He has no idea. Mary must know, and has already checked those places.
“You’ve never worked with Magnussen. I have. I had a minor part in that Jack the Ripper series he did. He’s a bastard.”
“I didn’t expect him to be... angry.”
But there are other ways to kill yourself. Less violent ways. Even paracetamol can kill you, if you take too much.
Why did she do it? He doesn’t understand. Was it for John? It couldn’t have been for Sherlock. She must have seen it, though. A woman that perceptive would know how he felt about John. Maybe she thought John needed him, too, more than he needed Mary.
he said. But he could. If anyone could do it, Sherlock could.”
Soon after I arrived at Greenwood, my aunt had proclaimed me an
“Not unless they’re delusional.”
“Don’t be obtuse, John. I mean, the word
“I am.” He gave me a final squeeze. “I wonder if my tailcoat still fits me.”
And then he’s gone, the door letting in a draft that chills Watson, even in his warm little corner.
“Hi, Greg. It’s John. Look, my daughter is missing. She probably slipped out during the night. We’re frantic, really, and if there’s anything you can do— well, I don’t know what to do. Give me a call when you can.”
“No time for that now.” She handed him a bottle of water. “Pull yourself together. Two minutes.”
is a subject pronoun—”
I moved my jaw, tested my neck by turning my head back and forth. “No worries. A very precise hit, indeed.” Gingerly, I felt my face. “I’m sure you left an authentic mark. No one will doubt that I’ve been assaulted.”
“Wait,” Lestrade said. “They approved it, without…” His voice trailed off.
Anderson shook his head. “I don’t believe this.”
If this is a dream, it’s the most vivid one I’ve ever had, even counting the nightmares after Afghanistan. It might be wishful thinking, too. It answers all my fears in a way that dreams never do. It lets me believe that Sherlock is alive, that he has faked his death and plans to return to me once he’s finished the work before him.
No one is paying any attention to me here, even though I’m rather conspicuous in my pyjamas and dressing gown, my feet bare. I must look like an escaped mental patient. Nobody looks at me.
The wall behind me was not marred; Milverton’s shot had gone wild, into the woodwork near the ceiling.
“Well, maybe we should rethink that position.”
“In this case, I do not. But I will trust you to lay aside your assumptions and give a fair assessment.”
Thank you, dear readers, for all your wonderful comments! I've so enjoyed sharing this story with you.
“You haven’t done it yet. Which is why I’m here. She won’t hear of it, Sherlock.”
“What kind of event?”
“No, it isn’t all right. We don’t… we don’t do these things. We don’t hold hands and kiss. You’re not gay. We’re just friends.”
Better than dragging it out for weeks, thought Sherlock. Fortunately, there wouldn’t be much cast promotion ahead of time for the reunion broadcast. There might be some interviews afterwards, but Mike could be selective for both of them. Once summer arrived, there would be filming for
Mrs Hudson was up next. Fake Jason would find her at home and she would challenge him. As he cornered her, tiny but feisty, she would stab at him with her knitting needles, but ultimately he would overpower her. When Fake Jason locked her in the cellar, the audience reacted with dismay, booing the character.
He doesn’t answer her calls, at least not if it’s evening when she wants to talk.
Now a dull panic settled in my gut, imagining him in a land where heathens were eager to kill Englishmen. Watson had run into danger plenty of times for me, and I knew he was neither a fool nor a coward. This did not set my mind at ease, though. A man who has nothing to lose makes reckless choices.
I was twelve then, a taller boy than others my age, with large hands, long fingers. The moment I had the violin in my hands, I felt that I had found something that had been missing. I took the bow as he directed and carefully drew it across the strings.
If he hadn’t threatened to sleep on Watson’s floor.
Another gusty sigh. “Yes, Watson, I am.”
“Of course. Bowtie. He’s a teacher, right?”
Mike was giving him a sympathetic smile. The server delivered two more pints.
This didn’t mean that he was as poor as the place looked. Parsimony seemed to be an ingrained trait in some people, learned from their parents. John’s family had come from Northumberland; Sherlock had heard it in his accent when they first met. By then John had already learned to sound like whatever a role demanded, but his mother had a working-class accent she tried hard to disguise. It was clear that the family depended on John’s income.
as the height of her career.”
“When I say I’m not using, I mean I have no intention of doing that again.” He means it, he realises. It’s not self-deception. Even on that terrible night when John left— when Sherlock made him leave— even then, he didn’t think of using, not even for a moment. Not even a cigarette. It simply didn’t occur to him. That’s how much he’s changed, and the credit for that goes to John.
This girl was in her early teens, short for her age, blond, blue-eyed, and wearing an Aran jumper. I deduced that she might be related to John Watson. Perhaps a distant cousin, a niece several times removed. She studied us back with equal curiosity.
Maybe I’m an addict in my heart-of-hearts. I’ve always had that fear, that something would tip me into that dark place and I’d drown. That’s what happened to my father. And it’s happening to Harry, too.
Holmes: Confessions?
He did get clean, though, not only because Mummy cried and Mycroft forced him into rehab, but because he had an idea of what he wanted to do with his life. Not piracy, not knight-errantry, but solving puzzles.
Happy? If your giant brain has deduced anything about Harry and I—”
She hands him a mug and they sit at the table. Sherlock stirs sugar into his, staring idly at nothing.
“He will come home!” I cried. “He must! Oh, he sounds desperate! Mycroft, you must see to it at once! Oh, my poor Watson!”
As he trudged up the stairs to his own flat, he thought about his options. Not just for this evening, but for the future, something he hadn’t cared much about when he started acting. He had turned twenty-eight in January, having survived drugs, and it looked like he might actually make it to thirty, a number he’d never thought to see ten years earlier. He had a brighter career than most actors his age. If he made good choices, he could expect to get leading roles until he was ready to retire. This was what he’d dreamed of when he gave up the drugs and started his career in earnest. Any way you measured it, he’d arrived.
