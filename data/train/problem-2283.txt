, pale and soft lying on the couch like a maiden in repose, his coquette fingers tapping against each other in prayer position, innocent, yet sinful. There’s a lovely pink flush and dewiness to his porcelain cream complexion that, had it been any other omega, John would account for a fever or sign of incipient heat.
Sherlock's fingers dance coyly over the pages as he flips through them. He must know he has two sets of very hungry Alpha eyes fixed on his every movement when he twitches his upturned nose and taps a fingertip to his full bottom lip in thought, a comprehensively coquettish act, yet John’s eyes cannot help but linger on the soft pink flesh beneath Sherlock’s finger. Heat instantly pools to his groin.
his traitorous brain unhelpfully supplies. Sherlock shivers despite the thick blankets. How easily he had taken out Gardner. Those broad hands grabbing Gardner and throwing him with pure brute strength...
“Christ, Stacey, call for an ambulance.” The second officer finally stumbles inside, wide-eyed, having just caught the action.
Dizziness swarms him immediately, the ache from before renewing its attack so viciously, it sends him doubled over with pain. No longer is the random soreness spread out in all his muscles, suddenly everything spikes outward from the epicenter, his lower abdomen and ass. Sherlock bites his hand to keep from crying out.
John’s body snaps towards Sherlock. His eyes narrow. “What the hell was that? Greg?” John suddenly vibrates with a possessive snarl that takes Sherlock by surprise.
Growing up, Sherlock always hated being an omega. The idea that he needed some large strong Alpha to protect him and a large hard cock to fuck him has always been infuriating to him.
John’s face is narrowed and hard as he strides back to him. "We're leaving." The low growl John spits out makes Sherlock shiver and forget to thank him, and before he finds his voice to say anything, a large, warm hand encloses around his bicep and drags him outside.
He sighs as he looks over his shoulder at his reflection in the mirror, mouth falling open. He looks remarkably, almost stupidly, voluptuous, his round globes popping out like melons. Scrounging around for one of his larger sized trousers, he considers when he’ll have time to make a visit with his personal tailor. These will have to do, he thinks, pulling on the relaxed trousers.
“Ah, Giles, I see you decided to pop by. Having trouble with a cold case, I expect.” He looks over from the couch on which he had thrown himself in order to seem busy.
And meanwhile John is forced to stand, arms crossed, solid like a statue unable to do a damn thing but continue to breathe in the omega’s luscious scent. His frustration is an approximation for what he had felt with Gardner the day before, only this is much worse. Gardner was a small-dick Alpha who posed a danger to Sherlock, and Sherlock being who he is, teased and taunted him, because that’s how Sherlock’s brand of sex kitten deals with Alphas - John learned this lesson on day one. And John knows his role easily. Defender, Supporter, Protector.
After several long minutes mentally debating the options before him, the omega decides against indulging his sudden urges. A nice strong cup of coffee should do the trick. He throws off the sheets and hops out of bed.
up a wall and I don’t have to spend nearly as much time with him as you do. How you don’t bend him over your lap and spank that tight little ass of his is beyond me. You really do have balls of steel.”
And now, it continues to prove helpful as it can addle the mind of the most dangerous thug as soon as they realize it‘s an omega who solved their crime.
It's at this moment John takes a step forward. A single step, almost casually taken, but John's natural earthen, woodsmoke scent becomes a bold onslaught that fills the room, a rush of pheromones overpowering both omega and rival Alpha. Sherlock feels lightheaded, overwhelmed really - the hot, spicy musk of John's angered Alpha joins atop John's familiar and unique dark, smoky notes.
He has just enough control left to keep from doing that, but not enough from tasting the omega’s beautiful throat.
Sherlock glances towards his closet. Inside, tucked away behind several other boxes of clothes and outfits and disguises, is a surprisingly large if rarely used box of dildos that prove he isn’t actually asexual, despite his weaker than average libido. He’s always known this. He simply doesn’t want to have sex with other people.
, as though... John hardly wants to put a name to it. But Sherlock is definitely playing some game, his lashes fluttering coyly and fanning across his soft cheeks as he takes the folder Greg hands over.
He steals glances at John, trying to remember why he should resist the urge to put his head on the man’s shoulder. Hasn't he been told time and time again that staying alone protects an omega? That a friendship with an Alpha is dangerous, if not impossible?
John is standing nearby, like a looming statue close behind him, arms crossed and jaw clenched, watching with narrow brow while Sherlock argues with the increasingly irate Alpha. Sherlock feels an innate sense of security and comfort that allows him to act more bold. oddly comfortable and reckless, knowing John, with a strength of presence only a powerfully masculine Alpha can provide, is with him. He's sure it has nothing to do with protective, sexual jealousy. John has certainly shown he prefers every other woman and omega to fucks his cock inside
Blindly, he reaches a trembling hand to his night stand. It takes a good three minutes while his body is wracked with shivers for him to inject the needle in the bottle and then himself. It takes a while for the drugs to counteract what his body is pushing forward, but ultimately, the drugs are strong enough to win out and the cramps, shivers, and panting subside.
Biting his lip, he silently steps into the living room. When he passes the stairs he hears John and Lestrade upstairs. Sherlock can hear Greg chuckling.
John moves without knowing it, crowding the omega away from the front door and towards the far wall. “You know his name after all?” He’s nearly frothing with hurt and jealousy and sexual frustration.
Then again, it makes perfect sense. John isn’t the sort to settle down, and Sherlock certainly doesn’t want some knot-headed neanderthal Alpha barging into his life and ruining his independence. In that case, why can’t he get John out of his mind? Every part of the solid man is powerful yet moral, animalistic yet controlled, just like an Alpha should be.
Sherlock’s nose twitches. He has caught on as well and stays close to John. John nearly crows with triumph as Greg opens the door to leave.
The dark, spicy petricore of his own Alpha arousal along with Sherlock’s lighter, delicious notes fill the room.
If Greg doesn’t react, at least Sherlock hears John’s pitiful roar for attention. Sherlock’s eyes dart to John, and for an instant, John sees a mix of genuine guilt behind those sky blue irises.
It took a visit to an omega tailor for Sherlock to come to terms with his new body, his new way of life, and find a new outlook on his life. Now he knows all too well the power his slim pale body and ripe ass have over the opposite sex… Well
“Going to claim you,” John growls deep in his chest. The pulse of blood in his veins is thick with need, his Alpha roars to
John reaches his hands behind Sherlock to those luscious, plump globes he has fantasised about ever since seeing Sherlock bent over in the lab. John slams his hips forward in a single rut against Sherlock’s skinny frame, and Sherlock cries out again. The sound Sherlock makes is just the invitation his Alpha needs so he does it, again, and again, and again.
“John!” Sherlock screams, and hits against Gardner’s wrist to release him. A millisecond later Gardner does, but only because John slams into his midsection, sending George crashing to the floor only for John to pick him up and send him hurtling into the nearby wall.
It happens all too quickly. Were Sherlock not still fighting the dizzy spell, he might have seen it coming, but as it happens, Gardner has a hand in his curls before he realizes that the Alpha must have decided he might as well go all out. Behind him he hears John snarl, deep and dark and animal.
“Gavin, maybe you should get back to your office. I’ll text you with the culprits later.” Sherlock lilts, popping up off the couch.
It’s that taste of his skin - paler than snow and sweeter than sugar - and the sight of Sherlock arching his neck to bare its vulnerability before the Alpha that a wall of carnal possessiveness  slams into him, fiery and fierce, abruptly breaks down John’s control, leaving an dark hunger erupting low in his gut. His cock throbs from pure, molten
His dietary habits are erratic at best and he has lost even more weight in the wake of his most recent case-fueled fast, so his trousers are loose as they slip up his thighs smoothly, however at the swell of his ass… they catch. Sherlock tries again and has to tug them up. When he tries to tighten the clasp and realizes he can’t; panic floods him as a flashback to when he tried to pull up his favorite pink skirt and being unable to zip it up at the back. He was inconsolable and his mum had to sit him down and explain to him how omegas will experience physical changes preluding a heat. As typical for male omegas, one of these changes is his ass, which will become swollen to better tempt Alphas. Similarly, female omegas experience swelling in their breasts.
He feels… good. Good, though perhaps not as good, as he should be feeling. The case is over and it was a huge success — he should be elated, and have the urge to finally eat something after his long rest. Instead he feels lazy, indolent, stifled by an unknown source.
Sherlock’s eyes widen and flutter, his tongue darts out and to flick across his bottom lip before his teeth press against it; he clearly realizes his mistake.
as his brother always teases him. It’s not necessarily true, but the loss of control is what frightens him. He knows enough about the world to know most omegas would do well to keep true to Sherlock’s personal motto: alone protects me.
There are those Alphas who get more than a bit infuriated by seeing Sherlock is outsmarting them. He doesn't mind that, what he does mind is how at times like this when Sherlock finds his annoying omega instincts taking over.
Soon after, a female officer, Nancy or something, comes over to make the arrest. She’s supposed to have backup, surely. Her partner is slow and still making his way from the car when George makes his move.
He quickly became addicted. He managed to beat the addiction with the help of an intervention, but continued to dabble with some drugs. After many experiments, he was able to concoct what would become his favorite solution of non-addictive drugs and a potent suppressant, only to be taken once a month. He hasn’t had a pre-heat in almost five years. Until now.
this little brat of an omega. This time when he thrusts his hips forward his iron-hard cock makes contact against the pure plushness of Sherlock’s firm, fleshy-round buttocks.
Sherlock gasps and makes little broken noises. The contrast of innocence and sinfulness of Sherlock’s mouth is an impossible temptation. John again uses every single ounce of his willpower to stop from plundering it. Instead he lightly scrapes his teeth against the extended column one more time before beginning to rub his bristly stubble against Sherlock’s jaw and neck.
“I had to go,” she told him.  “My son was getting into a lot of trouble and his father couldn’t handle him.  I had to spend more time with my boy, and it meant that I wouldn’t be able to carry on with my job.  Besides, Mycroft was sixteen and responsible enough to look after you before your parents got home from work.”
With nothing better to do, he went out to the supermarket but then Sherlock sent him a text demanding that he join him at Scotland Yard immediately and that it was urgent. When he arrived, having abandoned his almost-full shopping basket at the side of an aisle before hurrying out of the store, Lestrade looked at him in surprise when he burst into his office. When John explained that he had been summoned, Lestrade gave him a sympathetic look before telling him that Sherlock had rung him as well, saying that he was coming over to look at some reports on a cold case – a cold case that was
My Mum never really understood but, bless her heart, wanted me to be happy and – to my surprise – called me Callie from that day on, only occasionally and accidentally slipping into my original name. And when I started calling myself Ariane DeVere for fic-writing and macro-making purposes, she just nodded and accepted that too.
He looked into John’s eyes. “But she’s going to be fine about it,” he told him. “I guarantee that she’ll have seen this coming; and I have no doubt at all that she’ll continue to be a friend to both of us. Besides ...” He shrugged and gave John an evil smile. “There are going to be occasions when I’m busy on a case and haven’t got time to satisfy your rapacious sexual appetite, so who knows what might happen?”
John stomped into the kitchen, hauled the bags onto the table and began to unload them, grumbling quietly. For a while there was no sound from the other room, then Sherlock emitted a high-pitched whine which continued for several seconds. Alarmed, John hurried into the lounge to be greeted by the sight of Sherlock sliding in slow motion off the sofa and onto the floor, apparently unable to prevent himself.
to come because otherwise Sally Donovan would have come and tried to talk to you about it, and it would be much harder for her. It was bad for her, that night at the house in Brixton when you came over to me, all arrogant and cocky and showing off to your new colleague, and said some awful things about me and Sally and then flounced off into the house with that smug smile on your face. And you were
She glanced across to where Sherlock had sat down at the other side of the bed.  “I would never have admitted it at the time but I had a much better relationship with Sherlock than with Mycroft.  He was too independent to need much support from me, but Sherlock and I were good friends and I became his sort of confidante.  We spent a lot of time together, talking about everything under the sun.  We’d take his dog outside and chase him round the garden while Sherlock told me everything about his day, or I’d help him make pirate costumes for him
“Oh,” Sherlock said disinterestedly, then perked up and looked at John expectantly. “Did you bring the reports I wanted?”
Sherlock sighed pointedly, then lifted his head and looked at John. If he registered the fury in his flatmate’s face, he chose to ignore it.
The room was colder than the rest of the flat and John realised that one of the windows was slightly open.  Putting his toiletries onto the bed he walked across to the window and closed it, then turned and wandered idly around the room.  There were no major memories to hurt him here, and he even smiled slightly when he remembered Greg helping him to haul a drugged and mumbling Sherlock into the room and dump him onto the bed after his first encounter with Irene Adler.  He was about to pick up his stuff and leave when his gaze fell on the wardrobe in the corner.  He grimaced.  Mrs Hudson hadn’t said anything about Mycroft visiting to remove any of Sherlock’s possessions, and John assumed that Sherlock’s clothes were still in the wardrobe.
There was a burning behind his eyes and he wondered whether letting the tears come would be a good thing for Sherlock to see or not, but he blinked them back knowing that once he started to weep, he might not be able to stop.
Dedicated to anyone who sat with me in the Returns queue at the National, especially if we got chatting. I was staggered how many online
John frowned at his departing back.  Something was seriously wrong.  It was bitterly cold outside but Sherlock hadn’t bothered to pick up his scarf and gloves from the coffee table.
“You don’t have to beg,” she told him.  “Take him out on your next case and just casually mention it.  See what he says.”
“I have no idea whether there’s an under-Channel version of the Mile High Club but shall we see if we can start one?”
John had had many terrible days since Sherlock’s death.  That Saturday seemed worse than most of them.  When he first got to 221 he felt fairly strong, especially after spending some time with Mrs Hudson; she was very weepy when talking about Sherlock’s and John’s time living in her house, and John went into doctor mode and was kind and sympathetic with her.  When he managed to get away he went straight up to the second floor and emptied his wardrobe and chest of drawers, putting everything into the same boxes he had used to move in all that time ago and which had been stored in the spare bedroom next to his ever since.
John pulled back a little and looked up into his eyes. “We’re going to be fine,” he reassured him. “Go and get beaten up by the gang at the Yard and I’ll get thrashed by my sister, then we can face Sarah together. And then ...” He pulled Sherlock closer and spoke softly against his lips. “Then we’re going home.”
John looked across to Sherlock, who eventually shrugged in agreement.  John cleared his throat.  “All right,” he said.  “What about The Aluminium Crutch?”
“Yes,” Sherlock admitted, “when I was very young.  Mycroft sneered and told me that only little children needed such things.  He persuaded me to get rid of it.”
He glanced across to John, saw the look of devastation on his face and grimaced at his thoughtless comment.
“I can’t stay here,” he told her.  He picked up his toiletries with one hand and offered the other to her.  She took it and stood up and they left the room, Mrs Hudson closing the door behind them.  Leaving her to make her way back downstairs, John went back to his bedroom and packed up the last box.
“You’ll have to make the locks on flat C totally unpickable except by a genius,” he said.  “Maybe you should move Bart the bear downstairs where she can’t get at him?”
along with the chorus. He grinned to himself, imagining Sherlock’s reaction if he ever caught John singing such a ludicrous set of lyrics. But that reminded him that he was mad as hell at Sherlock and that this was the reason he was in this cab with a crazy cabbie and his ridiculous music in the first place. He scowled, the mood spoiled.
But now ... now his life was insane, and annoying, and frustrating ... and fun, and enjoyable, and utterly unpredictable. Every day was worth getting out of bed for; every adventure filled him with excitement; every near-death experience made him feel alive. Even the irritating moments – no food in the flat, running aimless errands for Sherlock, being dragged away from work and all the subsequent arguments – were worth getting annoyed over. Because he had a reason to be alive. He had a reason to live. He
“I never searched his bedroom,” John said quietly.  “You always started in here while I did the lounge, and then we both did the kitchen.”
“You should never have got him for me,” Sherlock said angrily.  “I hate being this sad.  And I hate you.”
: This was meant to be a silly one-off ficlet, but comments from some of my readers inspired an idea for a second chapter.  Since then my plotbunny had even more inspiration, and this will now be a four chapter story.
“I texted Mrs Turner and asked her to come round,” John said quietly.  “I know I should stay with her.  She’s in such a state, but I just
“Look,” he said, forcing himself to stay calm.  “It’s not practical.  That flat would be a death trap for Rosie.  There are stairs everywhere and the bedrooms are on a different floor to the living room and the kitchen. And the kitchen’s a disaster area at the best of times.  Jesus, Sherlock, the stuff you keep in the fridge – imagine once Rosie can reach high enough to open the door and take stuff off the shelves!”
Emily smiled.  “I hope you don’t mind me saying,” she said, “but when I phoned you after seeing your advertisement, one of the reasons the job interested me was because of the names of your sons.  They are so delightful and fascinating.”
When he came back to the living room later there was no sign of the box or its contents, and Sherlock never mentioned it.  John wasn’t surprised; his instinctive purchase had been stupid.
“No. Don’t you dare say a bloody word if you want to live beyond the next eight seconds. I’m sick of it, Sherlock. I’m sick of being treated like this; I’m sick of feeling like I’ve got no real purpose in life ... and I’m sick of
“Oh, Sherlock,” Emily said sadly.  “Redbeard was very ill and in a lot of pain.  You know that.  It would have been cruel to keep him alive.”
Part of Harry’s present had been two large bars of good quality chocolate, and after days of rich Christmas pudding and mince pies, John craved something light and easy to eat. Eggs, sugar and salt were in the cupboards and it took no more than half an hour to finish the preparation, then a patient wait for a couple of hours while it set in the fridge.
And now Lestrade looked out over the congregation, pleased that so many people had come. He turned his eyes to the coffin. “You always
“Sherlock, you know that Martha Hudson bought herself a big property in Baker Street a couple of years ago, using the money she inherited from that maniac of a husband of hers?  She told you about it in one of her nice letters that you never take proper notice of, and to which you never reply.”
Never, in the eleven years I have worked alongside Holmes investigating the supernatural, have I ever met an amateur occultist who did not at one point commit murder. It was a worrying trend, and explained the presence of human flesh on the dinner table.
And through the water I heard the song of the depths, calling out to me, telling me how much I was missed, how much I was loved. The current caressed my scales, tickled my fins, teased me with gentle touches and beckoned me with a lover’s whisper to return to the deep, to the place where the detritus of the world came to settle, to the heart of the abyss.
“As much as I would like to lavish you with all the tenderness you deserve, I am afraid that further discussion of these gentler emotions must wait.” Holmes sighed. “The matter of those inventive amateur occultists must be dealt with.”
I wasn’t sure if my leg could take much more running, but I was more upset by the callousness of Holmes’ words.
The poor man was forced to endure Holmes’ fawning attention during the entire walk to the parlour. By the time we reached the room, the colour of his face nearly matched his hair.
“So it was Ms Talbot who committed the murders?” I said. It was a sickening thought, that she was the one who killed her fiancé’s brother.
“The town was in a panic,” Ms Conliffe said, “But one week ago, my brother Charles went missing, and just yesterday…”
I awoke that morning earlier than my custom to an empty, cold bed. This was not unusual, as my dear friend and bedmate Sherlock Holmes is wont to rise with the sun, but a quick glimpse out the window revealed nothing but darkness. This was odd, as Holmes prefers to lurk in the dark during the late hours of night, rather than the thin strains of morning. His disappearance, therefore, filled me with some trepidation.
The man pinning me to the floor laughed. “Sounds like it’s rowdy tonight. You’re in for a fun time.”
Against the protest of my leg, I lowered myself to a kneeling position. Ms Talbot, or perhaps her alien inhabitant, growled at me, a sound full of cosines and tangents, but I remained where I was. It was there, from my place on the blood-covered floor, that I extended my arms and spoke to both of them.
But then the image shifted, and Holmes was running from Ms Talbot and the lines, except instead of fleeing successfully, they caught him, shoving him down, ripping at his arm, tearing off his skin until his blood was the only colour left in the photograph.
“Neither am I, my dear fellow, and that is what concerns me.” Holmes squeezed my hand, and tugged me towards the edge of the clearing. “I believe that it is time we visit the Hambleton estate.”
“Do pardon our intrusion,” said Holmes, “But myself and my travelling companion seem to have lost the trail. Might we ask for some directions, please?”
“Please tell me they marked out the section relating to this poor creature.” I said, keeping my own voice equally low as I gestured towards the chalk-bound abomination beside us.
Holmes chuckled. “I do find your concern for my welfare endearing, even if it is unnecessary. I doubt there’s anything around these parts that could harm me.” He pushed back his chair and stood. “But if it puts your mind at ease, then by all means, let us be off.”
magnificent about taking drugs.  You of all people know what they’ll do to your brain long-term.  Good lord, you only studied the effects of hard drugs last term.  What possessed you to think of taking some?”
From the quality of the sound it was clear that this was a CD rather than a radio station and John ducked his head and tried not to laugh out loud. Never a big fan of ABBA’s music, he had nevertheless been inflicted with it a great deal during his childhood because his mother had loved the band and would often have their albums playing while she was doing the housework. He and Harry had heard them so many times that they had known many of the lyrics by heart and, despite declaring that the songs were old-fashioned and rubbish, would frequently sing along without realising what they were doing, much to their mum’s delight.
Sherlock opened his mouth. He was probably about to correct John over the number of seconds he had been indoors; and if he did, John was going to punch him very hard indeed and this time he
Sherlock and John finished their farewells to her, left the room and made their way outside to walk back down the long driveway towards the road.  Both of them felt shocked by everything that had been said to them and they walked in silence, unable to think of anything to say to the other.
“My husband lost his job a year ago when the company closed down,” Mrs Holmes told her.  She grimaced.  “So far he’s only been able to find employment with a firm which requires evening work. It’s not very well paid; and now that Sherlock’s at primary school I’ve decided to go back to work part time at the university.  I used to be a professor of physics and mathematics there before I had the children, and I’ll be lecturing there again.  I’ll be doing afternoon classes, but then they offered me regular one-to-one coaching sessions in the late afternoon.  It pays too well to turn down, but it does mean that neither of us will be home in time for the boys when they get back from school.”
that she’d been crying. Oh, she washed her face before we left the house, and presumably borrowed a spray of my deodorant, but even in the car I realised how dark the circles were under her eyes, and she didn’t have any make-up with her.”
Mrs Holmes nodded her understanding and looked down at her notes before raising her head again.  “You understand that we’d need you to come in every week day afternoon during school term time, from three o’clock until seven thirty?” she asked.
her, and she wants to be there for him. So when he asked her to marry him, she accepted. It was a quiet ceremony; I was surprised that he invited me but I was pleased to attend.”
It took him another few minutes before he found a parade of shops but he was relieved to see a minicab office amongst them and went inside to request a cab.
“Obviously not,” John replied tightly. Turning to storm out of the office, he forgot that he had left the door open and banged heavily into it, smacking his forehead against the wood and swearing loudly. Lestrade’s hastily muffled snort of laughter didn’t elevate his mood at all and, rubbing his head ferociously, he stomped out of the office and headed home.
day, but recently the sneers and insults of the big boys have become more hurtful and frequent. It’s not
“Oh, you don’t need to worry about Janet bothering us today,” Mrs Draper assured him.  “She’s at school.”
“Sherlock, dear, you can think of far worse ways of spending your money.  And now that you’re starting to make a name for yourself, Mr Consulting Detective, and that nice detective inspector is starting to trust you, you need a look to go with it.  And if you buy that coat, you won’t be able to afford bad things for a very long time.”
A persistent tickly cough, and advice that over-the-counter medicine would actually be cheaper than if John wrote a prescription. The patient seemed indignant at being offered the less expensive option, believing that prescription medicine must by its very nature be more powerful. A tired explanation that ‘expensive’ didn’t mean ‘better,’ and a disgruntled departure full of mumbling that next time she would go and see Doctor Sawyer instead.
to go back to the place he still thought of as home, but it simply wasn’t possible and therefore Sherlock’s suggestion was upsetting him.  It wasn’t specifically Sherlock’s fault that John’s rage was rising and so he shouldn’t take it out on him unless it later transpired that Sherlock was deliberately provoking him.  Right now, that was unlikely.  If anything, Sherlock was simply being thoughtless.
We just reached the corner when we heard a loud stamping of feet and I turned around to see Sherlock reloading his gun and tilting his head questioningly.
‘I am done now,’ Sherlock jumped up, blood running down his ankles, and turned to me, ‘You want to take a look?’
The window was fully open from outside, the curtains fluttering in the wind. Right under it, on the floor was lying a black sports bag, almost ripping apart from whatever was inside. Starting from the window there was a trail of bloodstains leading all the way to the bed, where Sherlock was sitting.
I could tell him it’s okay. I could tell him that I forgave him the moment he appeared on the doorstep one month ago, fully wet under the falling rain. I could tell him that he could do anything and I would still forgive him because my life was nothing before he came and nothing when he was gone.
‘I used to,’ Sherlock replied, closing his eyes. He took a small breath, ‘Mycroft trashed it all when I was gone,’
‘I know who you really are…’ I didn’t even notice how the gun slipped out of my hand and the sound of it falling down on the floor made me flinch, ‘It’s okay. I am here now,’
‘You killed people, John,’ he was almost whispering now as if he was telling me a secret, ‘Many people. Don’t tell me you didn’t like it…’
Finally, I gave up, put the book down on the table aside and got up to go upstairs when I heard a loud bang like something heavy dropped on the floor. I froze, unsure where the sound came from, but then I heard it again, even louder this time. It was accompanied by a strangled moan.
I reached my hand out and carefully touched his face with the tips of my fingers. His skin was so cold but soft. If someone told me I would be here, in his bed several weeks ago, I’d laugh in his face. But here I am.
This is officially the last chapter with jumping in time: from this chapter on it's going to be just one storyline unfolding and I am hella excited about writing it (I can't even predict myself what's gonna happen haha).
‘I never miss anything,’ his eyes flashed, but he immediately suppressed his emotions, straitening up, ‘I am glad that you’ve been of use for once,’
I got used to this. After Sherlock came back from his two years hide-and-seek from the world game, he became much less talkative. Most of the time he would just grab his violin and stare at one point, sharply pulling the strings one by one and making the instrument make strange, twitchy sounds.
I had not taken above a couple of steps before I heard a loud beep coming from my pocket. I took my phone out and its screen immediately got covered with tiny water drops.
‘What?’ I sat up, looking at him confused. Sherlock swallowed hard and I hurried to wipe his forehead from tiny sweat drops going down his face.
I hid my phone in the pocket, waving to the passing cab. I was lucky enough for it to stop and in less than 10 minutes I got out of the car and turned around, standing there motionless.
I gave him a sympathetic look, not really knowing what to say. We both knew he meant Sherlock only. I still remember the time when several weeks after Sherlock “passing” Greg begged me to help him with some strange case of a mysterious vanishing of a well-known American politician, who came here on some sort of business. Even though I knew I would be completely useless on my own, he stood his ground.
Sherlock reached out his hand, his gaze sought my eyes insistently. Several seconds I just stood there, staring at him in bewilderment. Once it struck me, I started frantically shaking my head.
‘Rabble?’ I chuckled, pointing at the blond man that held a woman that could be his daughter by the waist, standing before us in the queue to get in, ‘Isn’t that Boris Johnson?’
I swallowed, trying to keep a straight face. Mycroft’s eyes were now piercing me and it felt like I was being x-rayed.
‘Easy as pie,’ Sherlock replied, ‘We just need to get past dozens of security guards in a mansion stuffed with individuals, who are all, one way or another, involved in the unstable situation in our country or the whole world,’
I turned around to see Greg’s face in the window before it disappeared. He probably thought I was beating up the corpse here or something.
‘I am not here because of you, silly,’ he grimaced like Sherlock said something incredibly stupid and then nodded in my direction, ‘I am here because of him,’
‘He was aggressive and she clearly started a new relationship judging by the lack of the ring and the lock screen on her phone,’ he handed it to the inspector, ‘Human nature,’
‘C’mon now, Sherlock,’ Sebastian smiled, ignoring him and looking straight at me, ‘I am just trying to get acquainted with your precious boyfriend. Don’t be rude,’
‘I feel bad for John. You should tell him what really happened,’ Greg whispered suddenly. Mycroft closed his eyes, feeling his mind slowly shutting down. He hadn’t have any problems with sleep since his bed became no longer empty every night.
It didn’t feel like a thousand butterflies inside. Instead, I felt incredible… relief. Like I’ve been holding my breath for years and finally, I was able to breathe out. Like I’ve finally been set free.
The case of Jane Underwood reached its dead end. Fred Underwood vanished into thin air. None of his entourage could tell when he was last seen. But nobody was surprised by that: this fellow was always very reserved about everything that was going on in his life or business.
‘I kept thinking about… coming back home,’ Sherlock looked up and our eyes met when he continued, ‘Coming back to you.’
The man looked down at his list, his finger going down the black lines. Finally, he found what he was looking for and made a little mark. He looked up, looking at me questioningly.
His eyes were wet. I couldn’t believe it. Maybe it was just the light from the fire, or maybe it was just my imagination, but Sherlock’s eyes were wet as he continued.
‘Don’t tell me I made it up for myself,’ I looked right into his eyes as if I was trying to read his mind. That would be a very useful skill at that moment, by the way, ‘What did I do wrong? I just tried to help,’
His voice sounded so soft and quiet that I almost felt guilty for my actions. Sherlock tried to take a small step forward, but I tilted my head to the side, pointing the gun at his. He stopped and lifted one of his eyebrows.
‘Don’t worry. They’ve done worse things. Much worse…’ he grinned and then leaned in to whisper in my ear, ‘I suggest we resume after we are done here,’
Suddenly we heard the sound of the bedroom door opening. I could only catch a glimpse of the dark blue silk robe flying after its owner before it disappeared behind the closed bathroom door.
‘Is it bad?’ Sherlock said, folding the paper back and putting it away, tilting his head, ‘I thought you weren’t very fond of anarchy and chaos,’
Greg opened the door and walked in, leaving it open for us. I already headed in the direction of the growing awful smell, mentally preparing myself for the worst picture, when a sharp movement of Sherlock’s hand on my chest pushed me back and pressed my back against the wall. Before I could resent or get surprised a large chunk of old plaster from the ceiling fell down on the spot where I had been standing a few seconds ago.
Behind the translucent curtains, the numerous silhouettes of guests were moving around, indicating that the party must have been in its full swing. Even so, the driveway was full of continually arriving fancy cars and their owners hurrying to the main entrance.
‘What the hell are you doing?’ I whispered through clenched teeth as we walked in the grand foyer. Sherlock took his coat off me with unusual gallantry and negligently threw it in the direction of the house worker, who tried his best to catch it.
Now when the adrenaline stopped pumping, the terrible smell of rotting stung my nostrils. I suppressed the urge to vomit and looked around to find the source of the smell. My gaze fell on the black bag under the window. I completely forgot about it.
Greg let out a quiet giggle and an unusual warmth spread somewhere inside of Mycroft’s chest. Amusing.
‘Where were you all this time?’ I asked while removing his coat, ‘Why didn’t you call me if you needed help, you idiot…’
‘Everything will be okay,’ Sherlock lifted his hand and placed it on my cheek, making my skin crawl. I leaned forward without realizing it, ‘As long as you are on my side…’
It felt like a slap. Right into the feels, as they say. I clenched my jaws and fists, feeling the nails digging into flash.
He lifted an eyebrow slightly. And something about this haughty glance made me tremble. It was so familiar that I might have frozen for several seconds and only roused myself when Mycroft cleared his throat loudly.
I couldn’t believe it. My ears started ringing and I couldn’t look away from my hands, shaking and fully covered in blood. I watched it run down my fingers and fall down on the concrete floor. And I felt satisfaction.
I covered my face with my hands, growling in despair. It was all my fault and I had no one to blame for it.
Long, sharply-chiselled face, a goatee and high forehead made a very disagreeable impression. You could see that Mr Magnussen was used to getting anything he wanted at once. And was clearly unfamiliar with refusal. He looked like a typical businessman, but something about him made you feel vulnerable and miserable.
‘Indeed, dear,’ a big plate with a perfectly fried toast, egg and beans landed on the table right in front of me, ‘Here you go,’
But when he appeared, his eyes so distant, his face covered with scars of unknown origin and his mind being completely in another place, I just couldn’t. I couldn’t make myself to say even a word. I just let out some strange sound of surprise and a complete mess of feelings as I threw myself forward pulling him as close as I could.
‘Y-you want me to come?’ I knew I sounded desperate and I didn’t care about it. For once in my life, I was not afraid of what he would think of me.
‘There’s something I should say before we do what we do tonight…’ he looked down for a moment, blinking fast like he was plucking up his courage. He looked up again and I could see that he was afraid, ‘I’ve meant to say, always, and I never have…’
Sherlock squeezed the doorknob and turned around, giving me the softest smile I’ve ever experienced seeing on his face. My heart officially declared its death.
I smiled, expecting Sherlock to be impressed. He chuckled coldly instead. The unreadable expression came over his face as he gave me a long stare and then turned to Lestrade.
‘Moriarty said it was just the beginning and if I didn’t surrender, he would hurt you much more,’ I looked up, meeting his eyes filled with a strange mix of sadness and pity. I snorted.
Sherlock quickly shifted backwards, his hand slipping down my chest. He awkwardly pressed his lips together and I finally noticed about six people, who just walked out of the crime scene, looking at us like they just saw something paranormal. Well, seeing Sherlock looking uncomfortable must be such a thing after all.
‘Jane Underwood is known for being arrogant and scandalous. She even has her own revealing secrets of celebrities show on her husband’s TV channel. She had many enemies. No wonder she ended up like this,’ I licked my lips, sitting up and looked up as Sherlock approached fully immersed in his deductions, ‘Her husband, Fred Underwood built his career in the same way: his previous wife was rumoured to be beaten up by him. And what do we see here? Bruises of varying degrees, the ligature marks on her neck and the fact that she’s not wearing the engagement ring are speaking for themselves,’
Greg also nodded, his lips pressed together as he turned away for several seconds and I heard him sniffing the air abruptly.
Mycroft, on the other hand, was fully engrossed in muttering something into his phone, covering it with his palm for about half an hour now. Finally, he finished and glanced back at Sherlock.
‘I wouldn’t hold on too much hope,’ Sherlock mumbled. He paused and looked around the room, ‘There. C’mon,’
Whoever that Sebastian was, I was more than sure I’d snap his neck at once if I stumbled upon him now.
The lights were out, but the room was lightened up by the lights of the night London: the walls were fully made of glass and there was only one heavy scarlet curtain that was usually unfolded during the day or important meetings.
‘Strange to see you here,’ she smiled widely as she quickly approached me, holding a deep bowl with… human brains? ‘Well, both of you,’ she giggled nervously, ‘I just bumped into Sherlock on my way in some time ago,’
My eyes slid down to the end of the sheet, where dark-brown curls were visible. Suddenly it was as if I had received an electric shock. I started back, bumping into Greg, who gave me a concerned look. He must have asked me something, but I couldn’t hear him. All I could think of were the curls under the white fabric.
‘I… I am just scared of what’s he going to ask for,’ I said so quietly as if someone else apart from him could hear me, ‘I haven’t willingly killed a man since Afghanistan. Not sure if I can do it now and…’
I slowly approached it as if it could open up and something would jump out of it. I held my breath as the smell grew stronger with each step. I leaned down and grabbed the zipper, pulling sharply.
I am not even sure which way of losing him was worse: thinking he was dead for two years or him acting like I barely existed now.
‘When I was there, tied up in a damp underground chamber in Serbia, looking at the floor painted with my own blood, all I could think of was this place,’ Sherlock put the violin down on the table and turned around, not looking at me even for a moment.
He didn’t reply. My heart skipped a bit and my hand reached to his neck to check the pulse. I sighed in relief.
He gently laid his hand on my waist and a moment after we were already moving, following the rhythm of the music. I grabbed him like he was a life preserver and surely stepped on his feet once or twice, but he omitted the comments.
My eyes were fixed on the barely visible contours of fields and lonely houses behind the window, while my mind was rushing back and forth. I was familiar with this feeling: tingling sensation throughout my whole body, slightly shaking right hand, the left one - completely still. I knew what I felt. Excitement. And I hated myself for it.
‘He must have hurt himself,’ I said with a touch of pride in my manner, ‘Little scratches on fingers, wrists or arms are inevitable,’
A light knock on the door distracted my thoughts from eating up my brain from the inside. I looked up to see Sarah’s face showing in the small gap of the opened door.
I felt a heavy coat landing on my shoulders. Sherlock still had a very pleased look on his face as he grabbed me by the arm and pulled in the direction of the house.
I got up, quietly cursing everything and everyone and trying to ignore enormous red stains on my pants. Lestrade opened his mouth in trying to say something, but failed and started looking very busy and calling for examiners. I exited the room, manoeuvring between white-suited people in masks, like a guilty child.
‘I am not talking about that, no,’ I said, biting my lower lip to stop myself from bursting out with laughter. Considering Sherlock’s pouting it wasn’t the best choice, ‘The coffee is marvellous, thank you,’
‘Charity? No, not really our thing. Give him our sincere apologies,’ Sherlock replied immediately. He approached me, putting his hand on my shoulder, ‘We are incredibly busy,’
I bit my lip, thanking heavens he couldn’t see my face right now. I bet I was blushing like a schoolgirl.
‘This is a remarkable case, Lestrade. Thank you,’ his hand dived into the pocket of his coat and pulled out a small set of instruments, ‘Let’s start then,’
‘Yes,’ I exhaled, turning his way. He frowned, unconvinced. I leaned in so that our foreheads could bump into each other if the car accidentally hits a bump, ‘Not really… I…’
His lips bumped into mine so suddenly I shifted back a little, but he immediately pulled me back and as one of his hands dived into my hair, the other one went all the way down my pants.
‘And I am not,’ I replied caustically, narrowing my eyes, ‘I just thought that selling my soul to the devil would at least change something,’
A thundering crash echoed through the stairwell. The bustle of the policemen on the lower floors stopped and a dozen heads popped out from different levels.
Sherlock turned around, frowning. Then he put his hands on my waist, carefully pulling me closer, and looked right into my eyes, not moving any closer as if he was asking for permission. I licked my lips, looking down at his and nodded affirmatively, giving him a quick encouraging smile.
‘Charming,’ Moran smirked, turning around and moving towards the exit door. He stopped for a moment and looked back in our direction, ‘We will be in touch,’
I was heading to the door to bring another one when his hand grabbed mine. I turned around to see him grimacing, his face damp with perspiration.
‘So all we have to do is to sneak into Magnussen’s office without getting caught?’ I asked. It took Sherlock a great effort to take his eyes off his rival. He tilted his head to give me a meaningful look, reminding me of our agreement. Like I could forget.
‘Your what?’ my eyes widened as Sherlock let go my hands and frowned, looking even more lost than before.
I heard someone’s quick footsteps getting louder and finally, Sherlock ran into the room and stopped as if suddenly rooted to one spot. I looked at him, breathing heavily and saw his eyes, widening when he noticed the body on the floor.
‘I am here because Jim sent me. Believe me, I had enough of you the last time we were getting rid of that Underwood guy,’ he sighed with a theatrical vast sigh, ‘He was so loud and problematic, wasn’t he?’
‘I am done with the soldier boy,’ Sebastian looked at Jim, satisfied, who has just walked around the table and slumped into a chair, exhausted, ‘He’s with us,’
‘You know he’ll never be a competition to you,’ he shrugged his shoulders, ‘But he’s important. Without him and Johnny, we won’t finish what we started all these years ago,’
I started at a sudden touch of a cold hand on my cheek. I looked up to see Sherlock looking at me with such softness in his eyes as if he wasn’t dying in my arms right now. And for a second I forgot about everything. My heartbeat slowed down and the only thing I could see now was his eyes light up in the dark.
It was like some sort of competition: our tongues were fighting for dominance and it was slowly growing into something more.
‘He says that some important American will come and he needs you to keep an eye on him,’ Greg said, shrugging his shoulders. Sherlock grimaced like he just heard complete nonsense.
Sherlock sighed, blinking fast and I could see how nervous he was so I squeezed his hands slightly, trying to comfort him. He smiled quickly and then looked up, his eyes shining in the moonlight.
Sherlock didn’t respond to him in any way. If his eyes hadn’t been open and flickering occasionally, Anderson would have wondered if he was comatose. He carried on anyway, wondering whether anything he had to say was ever going to get through.
He glanced round to see John’s answering nod. “Yes, I’ll talk to Dave about it,” he continued. “He could pay me a small fee for every old person I run over because I’m saving him some money.”
And then Sally divorces him and takes away his beloved children, his best friend gets married and moves abroad, and his brother Is busy with his own work. Then the aneurism diagnosis comes, and now he doesn’t care any more; all he wants to do is to outlive other people. Everyone’s so stupid – they deserve to die. He hears the first whispers about the mysterious “Moriarty” and finally tracks him – or them? – down and is put on the path to a less boring finale to his life.
Thankful that even during the worst period of his grieving process his PTSD hadn’t flared up and so neither his tremor nor the limp had returned, he finally felt ready to start working again and found a permanent GP role in a surgery in the suburbs, far away from the Baker Street area.  He registered with several local estate agents, visited a few places which they offered and eventually settled on renting a small but pleasant basement flat which even had its own garden.
She smiled.  “We never did come up with a proper description of my role.  I was a sort of part-time housekeeper and cook to the boys, helped with homework, talked with them and generally looked after them while their parents were at work.”
“It can’t happen,” he told her.  “Even if I wanted to – and I’m not saying that I do – my priority is my work, and I can’t allow any personal feelings to get in the way.  Emotions would only distract me.  Allowing myself to feel any kind of romantic attachment to John or anybody else would be a dangerous disadvantage.”
If you think that the Polish cabbie was crazy and unrealistic, I agree. And that is the man who drove me home after a painful and uncomfortable hospital appointment. All I wanted was to sit in the back of the car and feel sorry for myself, and my driver did and said exactly the things that I have related here – including almost running over the old man who got in his way, dithering about which route to take, and playing an ABBA CD all the way home (including
“Are you sure you’ve thought this through properly?” he asked.  “I mean, you’re doing everything to make the place safe for Rosie, but Sherlock, she’s a kid.  She’ll be noisy, and she’ll be unwell at times and want attention, and she’ll be having hissy fits at other times, and she’ll interrupt you all the time when you’re trying to concentrate, and as she gets older she’ll be talking and distracting you and she’ll want help with her homework when you’re trying to think ...”
what he would say if he were here, but you haven’t let yourself think about it. You’ve thought about nothing but finding and dealing with his killer, and once you had done that, you decided you had nothing more to do and it was all right to take your own life.”
The second character was only on the stage for about a minute, and it was another forty minutes or so before he reappeared, charging in from the rear of the stage wearing a long coat that flared out behind him in a way that seemed oddly familiar and Oh.
“If you don’t tell him and he finds out later that you knew, do you think he would forgive that?  He’s having enough trouble trusting you already.  You have to tell him.  He won’t thank you for it, but he has to know.”
“This is ridiculously short notice, John. Why didn’t you tell me about it before?” Sherlock complained irritably down the phone.
more than amazing,” he continued. “I can’t even think of a word. You’ve got a better dictionary in your head than me ...”
‘Do you really have to do this, freak?’ she grimaced, leaning closer to get the attention of Sherlock, who calmly lifted up the victim’s sleeve to reveal enormous bruises all over her skin, ‘We have ten more people to work with the body after you and you better not mess up the crime scene,’
‘Put your hand on my shoulder,’ Sherlock said with patience. I followed his directions, ‘Good. Now relax and repeat after me,’
‘Don’t go…’ he mumbled quietly. I bit my lip and wrapped my arm around his shoulder, hiding my face in his messed up hair.
‘If I could go back and do it over again…’ I could feel my heart bumping into my chest and I gripped the armrests of the chair when he came closer and swallowed hard, ‘I would never hurt you like that,’
He quickly moved towards the tall white doors on the opposite side of the room, dragging me with him.
‘Of course,’ he replied, ‘Now go kill someone or whatever you do in your spare time. I need to think,’
When I said I would never regret what happened, I didn’t lie. I’d never do it: I dreamt about it for years. But now when the endorphin levels in my blood lowered, I found myself completely not ready for whatever Sherlock was going to tell me.
I looked at Sherlock, who was still staring in her direction. His eyes were flashing and his pale face was paler still in his emotion.
One by one we slipped under the yellow line we learned to ignore over the years as we approached the last floor.
‘I placed the memory in my mind palace,’ Sherlock moved closer, burying his nose in my hair, ‘So it will stay there forever,’
Greetings to you, my fellow johnlockians, who came here to read some fantasy of mine :D This chapter isn't that long, but it's one of my favourites for now because of the warmth it has (let's hope I won't decide to ruin everything at once hehe).
I probably looked like I just saw a ghost because Molly looked completely terrified. It took Greg several tries to wake her up from her trance and make her bring the form.
Magnussen smiled wanly. His hand made a hardly noticeable gesture in the air. A whole flock of people dressed in dark inconspicuous suits immediately hurried to drag the tables and other furniture to the walls, freeing up space in the centre of the room.
A man walked out from the shadows and we saw a tall blond man with his arms wrapped on his chest, smirking.
‘But why would he kill her so violently?’ Greg asked, coming closer. Sherlock rolled his eyes, sighing dramatically.
Sherlock’s smile disappeared and his face assumed a strangely cold expression that made me freeze for a moment. Just for a second. And then it was gone.
‘Thank you…’ I mumbled and walked through the doorway with my head down, trying not to face anyone. Including Sherlock. I heard him quietly follow me and closing door behind us.
I used to be afraid of that word. I spent years running away from my own heart and suppressing my desires. I got trapped in a hopeless situation and I had no one to blame, but myself. I felt something, but denied it to the point when it was physically painful to be around him.
But it would never happen. Because I am me, and he is him. And it will never change. Our obsession with danger brought us where we are now and my fantasies are most certainly going to stay fantasies.
He was in the kitchen, standing with his back to me. There was a delicious smell of fried bacon and toasts in the air and my stomach responded with a loud rumbling.
I was trying to get enough of that brief intimacy, knowing perfectly well that when he wakes up, he probably won’t remember anything at all. And I was okay with that. I accepted the fact that he would never love me back a long time ago. It was hopeless right from the start.
‘You have no idea how much the pile of unsolved cases on my desk grew over these two years,’ he said a little disappointed, ‘I’ve never thought I would need you two so much,’
I opened my mouth to tell him what I thought about him acting like a complete moron, but before I could, a black shiny cab stopped a meter away from us and Sherlock quickly jumped in, not saying a word. The car sped away as quickly as it appeared.
The place next to me was empty. Instead, there was a spare set of Sherlock’s home clothes at my feet. Initially, I looked around for my underwear, but gave up and got up, putting on a dark blue t-shirt that I was almost drowning in and a pair of loose striped pants just like that. My eyes met their reflection in the mirror in front of me. I bet Sherlock found the biggest clothes he had for me.
A loud cough brought me back to reality. The car wasn’t moving anymore and I could hear loud music muffled coming from outside. More importantly, I felt two pairs of eyes staring at us. I backed away harshly, trying to ignore Greg and Mycroft’s shocked face expressions and Sherlock stifling a snicker.
I tried to focus on the truly enormous building before me. An ancient three levelled mansion, the roof of which was supported by a row of Roman columns, was lightened up by additional lights at its base. The high windows of the first floor must have belonged to the living room.
‘Please do stick to the plan, brother,’ he put the phone in the pocket and sighed as if he knew the plan was already doomed from the start, ‘Magnussen is not the best option for demonstration of your volatility and pride,’
‘We both know it’s not true,’ Sherlock slowly moved closer and for some reason, I froze and couldn’t move even a muscle. His forehead bumped into the gunpoint, his eyes still on me, ‘You always knew what I was about. From the first day. And that is why you stayed. And that is why you killed that taxi driver. Because you knew we were the same…’
I looked at the empty evening street, panting. He left me standing here in the middle of the road, like some kind of an idiot, my legs covered in blood, so easily. I asked myself again why the hell was I still helping this narcissistic, irritant Spock, who barely appreciated anything I did no matter how much I tried to understand him.
Mycroft’s phone was blowing up in his pocket again and now was impossible to ignore. He answered and his voice lowered to inaudible for human ear again. Lestrade bent over to tell something to the driver.
‘You don’t have to pretend with me…’ Sherlock’s hand gently rested on the gun, slowly lowering it down. I closed my eyes, not being able to fight back. I never could.
‘Secret services, I know,’ I interrupted, lowering my head and running a hand over my face, ‘I read his file…’
I gave a bleak sigh and clutched Sherlock’s hand in despair. Deep down in my heart, I was now hoping that this tune would go on forever and we could stay here, running away from our duties.
I almost ran out of the room, bumping into Greg again. I wanted to get out of there as fast as I could, but he was holding me by the elbow.
‘You could’ve talked to me!’ I cried, shaking my head in outrage, ‘You could’ve told me about everything and we would sort it out together!’
Greg called me the other day saying that they officially close the case for now as a result of lack of any proof if the main suspect was guilty or not.
Hope you'll enjoy this new chapter, which is slightly (or very much) bigger than the first one because it's about time to really stop talking in riddles and reveal the storyline hehe
Mrs Hudson quickly said her goodbyes and went back to her little kingdom of never-ending TV morning shows and radio, leaving me alone with a ghost of someone I used to know.
My eyes were slowly closing, but Sherlock started getting a fever and I kept running back and forth, changing wet towels on his forehead.
I moved my hand away and Sherlock frowned in his sleep, his hand groped for mine and a moment later he pulled me closer. His face hid in my neck, making my skin cover with goosebumps from his breath.
Instantly his hand grabbed my arm and squeezed it so hard I almost let out a moan. Sherlock’s eyes were burning me with a look full of anger and some strange desire. I bit my lip, my eyes going up and down from his eyes to his lips.
‘We had so many and still, you can’t recognize them,’ Sherlock smiled fondly and turned back to our nearly burnt by now breakfast, ‘Do you think order-in works at 8 am?’
‘People do little else,’ he quickly retired from the room, stopping before the door to give me a sliding look, ‘Get dressed. I’ll call the cab,’
I was beginning to feel uncomfortable in the suit that Mycroft kindly lent me for this evening. The dark blue fabric, fitted too close to my body, was making me feel exposed. I couldn’t get rid of the thoughts about how obvious I must look in my “disguise”. The last time I wore a tuxedo must have been my father’s funeral. Not the best memories for sure.
‘Okay, okay…’ he lied down, patting the empty place next to him, ‘But only if you stop staring at the walls and accompany me,’
I reflexively grabbed Sherlock’s hand and he wrapped his fingers around mine at once. Moran looked down at our hands and laughed to himself sarcastically.
I pulled away, still pressing my forehead against Sherlock’s, and smiled when I heard him groan, disappointed.
If only I could talk to him just once more. If only I could tell him that he was a hero. He was my hero. He was always enough for me. The hell with all of his flaws. At that moment I was just looking at his closed eyes and all I could think of was that I would sell my soul to meet his blue-eyed gaze once again.
‘Are you, guys, okay?’ I heard Lestrade’s voice muffled like I suddenly went underwater, ‘I forgot to tell you that here they have very weak…’
We both laughed and I felt better. My forehead laid on his shoulder and Sherlock pressed his cheek to mine. The melody slowed down and now we were just swaying to the rhythm of the orchestra. I closed my eyes and tried to forget that we were possibly in great danger, surrounded by a considerable number of strangers and a likely criminal mastermind.
‘Sounds nice,’ Greg said, blinking fast. He looked at me as if he was waiting for me to explain, but then just closed his eyes and threw his hands in the air, ‘It’s not like I didn’t suspect anything, but…’
‘You won’t get away with this so easily, Sherlock,’ I held my breath and put my hand over his. I felt him slightly startling and I looked up to see him blinking at an inhuman speed, ‘I want to know the truth,’
The street was so empty and quiet that I started to doubt if it’s not some kind of a strange dream. But the pain was real. I knocked on the door, leaning against the doorpost. I closed my eyes, seeing spots.
I looked down at his hand and back at his face. He lifted his eyebrows and bowed slightly, steadfast. My heart was close to its stopping and I did the only thing I could. Accepting my fate, I took Sherlock’s hand and let him pull me round with him.
I wanted to lose myself in him completely. I wanted to forget about the halfway through mission and just stay here and now forever: Sherlock’s hands gripping my hips and pressing his against mine, the taste of blood that we now shared and my fingers pulling his hair, making him let out stifled moans.
‘It’s not a date or anything. I know that things between us… Got a little awkward after we… You know,’ she smiled, nervously tucking a strand of hair behind her ear, ‘But I think we could still stay good friends and colleges,’
‘Focus on the task, will you?’ Sherlock said, almost sarcastically, ‘Aren’t you my spouse?’ He faltered and grabbed my glass, taking a pretty big sip and grimacing immediately. After that he got rid of it, putting it on a tray of the passing-by servant.
It took me several minutes to force myself to get up, supporting myself against the wall. I took a bunch of small breaths, grimacing from pain every time and managed to make my way to the door of our flat, practically falling onto it.
He laughed bitterly. “I remember the first time you showed up at a crime scene with Doctor Watson. It’s really ironic, because things happened that day that are so relevant to what you just did, and when I realised that, I ...” He paused for a long moment, looking down at his hands. “I had to come.”
‘Don’t even think about it,’ he told himself silently.  Looking inside could only cause him pain and it was stupid to even consider it.  But there was a sudden and unreasonable yearning to see those ridiculously expensive suits one last time and, after hesitating for a very long while, John finally pulled open the door and looked inside.
When he opens his bedroom door his nose is hit with three individual scents. First a familiar scent - John’s burning woodsmoke and earthiness is, as usual, heavy in the air, and even impossibly stronger; Sherlock can practically taste it on his tongue. Under that he detects Lestrade’s own Alpha scent, though lighter than John’s musk. And then, most baffling, there is the very light, very soft, yet still noticeable scent of… himself. Sherlock has always had a rather freakishly delicate scent for an omega: strawberries, vanilla with floral hints, but too light for most to smell. But now he can definitely sense a soft note of himself, bubblegum with vanilla. Most odd is that he’s able to perceive it at all outside his room, because he has remained inside his bedroom since early evening the day before.
getting up for the day, the drugs doing their job to perfection. Prancing a bit with rejuvination to his limbs, he goes to his walk-in closet. An interest in fashion is a classically omega interest that Sherlock, who tends to be especially vain, has taken to heart. He doesn’t always enjoy his biological instincts, but he can’t deny how easily his omega assets turn heads whenever he steps out. Omega fashion is designed to accentuate those features: tight trousers to showcase his slender legs and narrow hips, and most especially his full ass in the back and the lack of bulge up front. Tight shirts show off his svelte body.
The house wasn’t just abandoned: it was nearly falling apart. The heavy smell of already begun rotting process and the total air humidity made me close nose and mouth and stop myself from a natural reaction. This smell was too familiar from my Afghanistan past when I had to cut off my best friend’s leg that couldn’t be saved on my own under the unstopping shooting. Good ol’ days.
My eyes locked on a wide white door with two tiny windows in it. Morgue. I stopped unwillingly as I approached it. I felt a sudden cold shiver down my spine. The main lights inside were out, but I still could see somebody’s corpse underneath a white sheet.
‘It’s not a difficulty for me to cook you some proper breakfast. I am not letting you leave the house with just a coffee another morning, John Watson,’
‘Sherlock, dear… Do you remember what happened to you the last time you didn’t listen to me?’ Sebastian said, as if by chance hitching up his jacket and revealing an enormous hunting knife. It threateningly flashed in the moonlight and the memory of Sherlock’s white shirt slowly being painted with his dark-red blood made me flinch. The blood was pumping in my veins and I had to clench my fists to try to keep myself focused, ‘Do you really want that to happen again?’
I walked out of the hospital when it was somewhere after half-past eight. The streets were wet cause of recent rain that was still falling about half an hour ago. Sidewalks were shining in the soft light of the street lights that just turned on. I turned up the collar of my coat, trying to shut out the cold humid wind coming right to my face, and hid my hands in the pockets.
I opened my eyes in amusement. It was the first time he said something personal to me, not something concerning getting the insides of our refrigerator.
‘A little,’ I felt my cheeks burning. I licked my lips, approaching him. I still felt like everything that happened last night was a dream and had no idea how to act around him. I leaned on the countertop with one hand, watching him flip the bread on the pan, ‘How is your stomach?
Suddenly he closed his eyes and I could see them moving fast underneath the eyelids. I touched his cheek, getting concerned in earnest. What if showing weakness is not prescribed in the instructions to Sherlock’s mind?
I pulled myself up, standing up and helping him to lie down. Sherlock groaned quietly, but didn’t say a word when I tore apart his shirt to see a round lacerated wound surrounded by a growing bloodstain. It looked like the one who did it twisted the knife inside of his body. I pressed my lips together, pressing my hand to the wound.
Don’t get me wrong, I have nothing against Molly. And in the beginning, her feelings for Sherlock and her willingness to help him at first call were adorable, but over the years it started to slightly annoy me.
At once, I was thankful that it was dark enough for Sherlock not to see that my skin colour turned five shades redder.
