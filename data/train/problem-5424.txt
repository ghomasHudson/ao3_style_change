In the beginning of her disease, Peggy’s husband, Daniel, took care of her. Despite being old himself, he made sure she washed herself, she ate her dinner, and she would pick up the phone. But after his death, somebody else had to start taking care of her. When Tony then heard that neither of her children were able to take her in, he decided to make sure she would be as comfortable as possible.
Everybody nods in understanding. Steve and Tony get back on their feet, their hands holding each other in a strong grip. Though the Quinjet has been blown up, so they can’t make a quick return to the tower. They have to wait for a bit, it seems.
“I used to be before I moved,” he says. Peter snorts, trying to imagine Ned in one of those costumes but not able to do it. “So who is going to be there? The X-Men? Fantastic Four? The Defenders?”
Steve yells, louder than Tony has ever heard him yell before. With his shield raised, he starts running again. Going faster and faster, relentlessly, Steve digs his way through the multiple enemies to get to the monster. The murderer.
He knows Aunt May hasn’t mentioned it for a reason; she’s always being careful around him, measuring her words carefully as if afraid to trigger him or something. And while Peter still feels like he’s not really in complete control yet, he is aware that, somehow, things are going slightly better. Despite the small setback last week, even.
Maybe this wasn’t a good choice she was going to make, maybe she could handle this differently, but who would care? Her reputation couldn’t get any worse, as people clearly looked down at her.
“This is for PTSD,” she states the moment she sees it. When she says it, everybody looks up at Tony to search for confirmation. He can only nod sadly.
, really? The only sympathy she’s shown him is when he was just about to get dumped, giving him cryptic messages about the both of them being fools when it comes to love.
“You know, how about that’s not any of your business, okay?” she snaps before putting her hand against her lips. “Oh my God, I didn’t mean to snap! It’s just… personal.”
“Yes, can I help you, sir?” he asked politely, but Yaël saw him frown a bit. This boy had the worst poker face ever. Yaël hoped he’d be able to stay kind to Wade, otherwise he might get fired.
There stands Peter, walking exactly where Tony just walked, looking younger, stronger in a way. Tony watches as Peter looks at something on the screen Tony is currently finding himself in front of. For a long while, that’s all he sees. But then, Peter moves again, having a quick look around before leaving the wagon again. After that, the screen goes dark again.
When the lock clicked for a second time a little while later, Yaël waited to see if anyone was walking in again, but nobody did. With a wide grin, Yaël opened the door and faced the light coming from the hallway.
“Something… Wait, you don’t even know what happened? Let me take a look at you.” It seemed like Steve finally acknowledged her presence. He grabbed her shoulders with both hands. He checked her for something, probably wounds or scars, and then he mumbled “How are you even still alive…?” He let go of her shoulders and stood there like that for a moment, frowning, thinking. Yaël decided it was best to give this man the time he needed to process this weird happening.
“I know all of you constantly think that I’m joking, but I care for your son. A lot.” Wade sighs. “I would go back, be the hero myself, but it’s not my thing to do.”
“So, what can I help you with?” Raido asked her, it was weird to hear English coming from his mouth.
“Are you alright, Steve?” he asks. Steve keeps his eyes closed but he nods, though his face looks pained.
“So, can anybody recapitulate for the people who weren’t there?” Bruce asks, holding a hand up the moment he enters the room. He’s only been told the footnotes of everything, much like Bucky and Hope have been.
As I'm currently writing the 27th chapter, and I felt the sudden strong need to thank each and everyone of you. I'm literally blown away by all the kind comments. I'm glad people like the story! I've been on this since a little more than a year ago, though it's been since Homecoming that I've continued writing since chapter 4!
“I’ll keep you updated on his situation,” Steve eventually gets out. May, next to him, isn’t even moving.
“I’ll figure that out after a while. First I just want to… spend some time with him,” Peter says. “Of course, that would work if he would actually
“I just don’t know what are my own thoughts anymore…” Peter says. “It’s like there’s two opposite sides inside my head; the one telling me I love MJ, and the other one telling me I desire the Cat. It’s driving me crazy.”
A week is not that long, Tony has to admit. Especially when there’s a whole lot of props that they need to arrange.
“Because of our son, right?” he asks carefully, feeling a little bit smug when he sees her open her eyes in surprise.
“If I send you a sample of some of the fabric and the web-fluid, you mind checking it out for me?” Peter asks in a hurried voice.
, you suddenly start crushing on Michelle Jones of all people?” Peter asks with a frown. Harry punches him in the arm without looking to the side, only watching to where MJ disappeared to.
And everybody looks in fascination as Thor gently puts Mjölnir down on her lap. She doesn’t seem too affected by it, though her eyes are staring right at the weapon, face slightly turned into a frown. Then, without a word, she reaches out her hand towards the hammer. When Thor wants to pull it back, she gently slaps his hand to the side.
“Draw me a flower,” Yaël answered dryly, while leaning with her elbow on her desk. Who would think such a brute could draw? He told her he had ‘many years of practice’. She didn’t even bother to reply that she was older than him.
Steve, too, looks good. Having lost the beard in the beginning of the summer, he’s changed nothing at all. He keeps his hair a little bit longer than he normally would, but other than that, he’s back to his old self. Everybody in their crazy family knows well enough how much Tony has mourned the loss of the beard, since he kept complaining about it all the time.
“Yes. I love art very much. It’s the complexity in things, but also the variety in it. Like, there are paintings in so many genres, but then there’s sculptures as well, and I love just finding the connections between the two of them.”
Peter talks with the twins, even shows them his room and allows them to mess around on their tablet. He starts a conversation with George, listens in on Harry’s discussion with Vision. After twenty more minutes FRIDAY announces Paul and Betty’s arrival. They’re the children of Lisa Sousa, Aunt Peggy’s granddaughter. They’re both twenty and twenty-one years old, in college for an education Peter can’t really remember. Their mother and her husband, Stuart, are still on their way.
“A bar; he needed distraction, I needed distraction. It was a win-win, I suppose.” For a moment, it was quiet, but not in an awkward way. The silence made Yaël slip away in her own thoughts. She had never been in a relationship after Loki, she wasn’t that dumb and naïve, but Bucky hadn’t been just a one-night-stand either, like she had made Steve believe.
“Eh, I’ve seen some horrible things in life. I’m sure this isn’t going to top that,” Clint disagrees. “If you’re all too chicken, I can just tell you the result in the end?”
“Eh, not really. Well, I haven’t really met him face to face yet…” Logan, or Wolverine, whatever you prefer, hung around the school every now and then. Yaël had already seen him from afar a few times, but they have never spoken to each other yet.
“I don’t- I don’t feel well,” he admits before grabbing his stuff and hurrying out of the class to find himself a small, secluded spot where he can get back to his senses. After hiding in the boy’s restroom, he locks himself up in a little stall and dials down Tony’s number. He knows he shouldn’t disturb him with this stupid business, but it’s not like he can call Steve now.
“Tony’s intern? You must be a big deal, then, since I’ve never heard of Tony getting an intern,” Otto says, clearly surprised.
They stay there for a while. The sun moves position just slightly, but the blinding light disappears. The garden looks normal again, no longer magical. The gardeners are returning from their break, not even looking at the pair next to the fountain.
Getting the movie ready to play, Tony waits on the couch for Steve to arrive. For just a few seconds, he closes his eyes, enjoying the alone-time they’re given.
Peter knows it’s risky, the others seeing him hang out with this little group. Given the reaction Spider-Man had yesterday, people might put two and two together. But they’re all ‘heroes’ here. Everybody respects each other’s privacy.
Tony, who, for a second, glanced a bit surprised at Yaël for having his back. Not that she really was having his back, but she couldn’t stay there if Tony disapproved it. They would only annoy the crap out of each other.
“Yes. I’ll prepare the landing platform for the ship to come down. FRIDAY will let you in. You know where Peter’s room is.”
The four of them fall asleep on the floor somewhere during their viewing of a ‘say yes to the dress’-rerun, though overnight Peter notices Yael leaving the room and returning hours later. They’re awakened by Vision, who comes with the news that they should get breakfast. With a groan, the four get up and follow the Android.
Neither does he see Tony run out of the car and puke into some bushes the moment Peter is inside of the building.
.” There’s a light, though sad, smile on her face. Tony’s heart suddenly skips a beat, suddenly afraid for what she’s clearly hesitating to say.
“Maybe two times is a bit too much before bed,” Tony mutters against, only barely audible. Steve kisses his cheek.
“I don’t- I don’t know how to look at Steve without remembering Siberia. And he might love me, and I might love him, but in the end it doesn’t change what happened.”
took the tape!” James says, pointing towards Clint with clear surprise on his face. Good, acting time.
“It’s what I do,” Peter says with a smirk. Johnny finally stands up and heads towards his room to get dressed for the occasion. Peter just clears his throat before jumping over the couch. In her surprise, MJ starts laughing when the pillows jump up and down along with it as he lands.
“Stop staring like that,” Peter mutters. Natasha raises her eyebrows and suddenly stands up, putting her hands on her hips.
After the lesson starts officially, Peter starts taking notes. Given that it’s his final year at this school, he wants to make the best of it. Besides, he’s a bit out of inspiration to work on any improvements to his suit.
After that, MJ starts walking towards the door, leaving the apartment. Peter passes a hand through his hair, vaguely aware of the shifting noise behind him. When suddenly a hand rests onto his shoulder, he jumps away, turning around towards the Cat with his hand held up as a stop-signal.
“Hi Natasha,” Peter says, happy that he got the permission to call everybody with their first name here. Wanda, he would have done so anyway, but the others? No, he waited for permission on that one. “You’ve been working out?”
“So, I can go home tonight?” he asks. Did he ask it before? The way everybody seems to groan and roll their eyes indicates that maybe that’s not the case.
They put her down in a sort of chair that immediately kept her chained, as an old man came to her with a scissor-looking machine in his hands. No...THE SCISSOR-MACHINE WAS HIS HAND!
“Care to come and eat a bit, sport?” he asks. The two girls on the bed suddenly jump on their feet. That’s when Steve gets a look at their robes as well. Mantis is in a long dress with mostly black and green colors. Shuri’s are a combination of brown, purple and black. They look absolutely stunning, he must say.
“Now where are your blueprints?” Peter mutters out loud, hoping that the question will cause for FRIDAY to help him out again. When there doesn’t come any answer, Peter just shrugs and starts going through different drawers to see if he finds anything.
“Uh, no not the Iron Man suit. It’s something for a new guy, he said,” Peter answers then with a shrug. Then he gets a poke on the head from Michelle.
“It’s okay, after what they’ve been through, they won’t let something silly like this break them apart,” he says, waving it off. He has no doubts that later, would he ever get married, he’ll get in arguments like these as well. Besides, the subjects aren’t
“Holy shit it actually works,” he mutters out. He smiles, happy with the result. It’s been a while since this idea has been going through him. Mostly, it’s been Shuri who gave him the initial idea of the previous armor he had. The one that originated from the Arc Reactor attached to his jacket. But Tony wanted something that wasn’t dependent of the reactor. He needed something he could give Peter, so the kid could protect himself at any moment of the day.
“I don’t know what your natural habits were on that planet of yours!” Wade said while handing her the beer.
“No, I’m just asking for you kindness and compassion,” she answered, trying hard to stay calm. “By the way, I want to achieve something else by working here as well.”
“Of course,” Steve says before Tony could even say what he means. “I’ll get his stuff. You need anything else?”
“You want this, too, don’t you?” Tony asks. Steve frowns for a short moment, before realizing what this is all going to be about.
“Oh, no, no, not really, Yaël. I mean, you didn’t know what you were doing, and he wasn’t really capable of looking at you differently after that.” Yaël felt a tear running down her cheek even though she didn’t understand what Cap was talking about. Someone didn’t like her, and she wasn’t sober at all, enough reasons to cry.
“I don’t-, Shall I-“ the man looked tired as he rubbed his eyes. He thought for a minute. “Do you want me to read it out loud?”
“You know, Steve… I don’t really like your name,” Tony teases. It gets a reaction from Steve, who pulls away and puts a frown on his forehead. His surprise is quite an amusing sight.
“Uh..” Holy shit, Loki was giving her a heart attack, but it seemed he was giving himself one too, still being conflicted about the relationship-thing. “I have to go,” he mumbled as he turned towards the door. He almost seemed to be…angry.
say that Tony’s not worth it. It feels like multiple stabbings, hitting him right in the heart. Carefully, he looks up, his eyes finally meeting Steve’s.
The two next to Tony nod, and they gently walk out of Tony’s hold. He turns to look at them, giving them a wink before blowing them another kiss. Then he starts walking towards the middle of the stage.
“OH MY GOD THIS IS THE HAPPIEST DAY IN MY LIFE!” she shouts, running back to her usual spot while hugging her phone. Steve awkwardly shuffles back towards the chairs with Tony and LL. Meanwhile, Peter jumps up on his feet, clearing his throat and pointing towards the door.
They don’t show it, never when there’s someone else around, but Peter knows what he saw. And he’s glad for it; because he knows this is something that might help Tony, a lot. They’ve all been sad for such a long time, but now they can start being happy again.
The keeper looks at Mrs. Cooper with a shrug, not seeming all that intent on keeping Peter here. The woman stays quiet for a long time, but eventually sighs as she looks down. Then she shrugs.
“Because it’s classified Avengers-business,” Tony concludes. “Just because your father was an Avenger doesn’t mean that you get to know all their secrets.”
But after Rhodey, there’s more of them. Tony and Wanda together is difficult. She nods at him, clearly uncomfortable at having to be friendly to him after all those years of hatred. Tony says that he doesn’t take it personally, but Pepper knows he does.
“I’m not sure, they’re just not using it anymore since SHIELD fell, though we’re not really a part of SHIELD anymore, anyway.”
But when the two agree to get Peter so they can discuss this between the three again, it’s not too long until they realize that Peter ran off.
His last appointment is around five, which means that he can return home after that one; which actually means he’ll go back to the compound instead, having avoided his penthouse up until then. He’d rather waste his time with Sam Wilson’s dumb jokes than having to spend another lonely night up there.
“Shuri,” T’Challa says, though clearly amused. The Princess lets go of Peter before turning towards MJ with a bright smile. To her, she holds out her hand for a shake. MJ takes it, looking amused as well.
“Don’t feel so well? Yaël, you look like you’re going into an attack, this didn’t happen in this memory…” He pulled off the piece of fabric she had bound around her head to cover her eyes.
Suddenly, Yaël’s surroundings changed. Tony, Peter and Steve turned to shades and then disappear to make place for a new shade. Again, after looking at it for a few seconds it became clear: it was Peter falling. Now, Yaël really, really wished she could look away, but she had to be cursed, because the only thing she could look at, was how Peter knocked against the ground in a murdering tempo.
Tony takes a few seconds of silence. A few scientists pass them by with their small monitors in their arms. A few people in scrubs and isolation-masks approach the crash-site again. As they perform their inspection, Tony turns around, slapping Fury gently on the back.
How did Harry even escape? He thought they’d capture him that first time? He should have asked, but only thinks of it now…
“My buddy Peter here has been feeling down. You think you could boost him up at least for the wedding?”
“Yeah, sure,” Peter responds. Then he follows Tony outside again. In the hallway, he sees the three talking to the man Peter recognizes as the King of Wakanda. He can’t hear what they’re discussing, but it’s put on hold when suddenly Vision appears, takes Wanda’s hand into his own and gives her a gentle kiss on the mouth. After that, he flies off again without giving Wanda the chance to respond.
“Ah, well, in that case,” Tony returns, taking Steve’s face into his hands and pulling him closer for a kiss. Peter averts his eyes, noticing the other Avengers still standing there, keeping their distance. Dr. Strange is seated down on the ground, with Wanda hovering over him as she looks after him. Peter has no idea how the battle against Mordo went but given that the guy is currently knocked out and being restrained, Peter figures they defeated him in the end. The destruction around them might be another dark stain on their names.
They take the subway, probably making too much noise. When they get to the festival, there’s loud music playing. A playlist is set up from what could be the seventies. People of all ages are dancing on the dancefloor. As a quick survey, they check out what exactly there is to be found around here. There’s Mexican, Chinese, Turkish, even French specialties. Somewhere, even, Peter spotted some deliciously-smelling Belgian Waffles he already knows he’s going to take one of.
“You woke up here without knowing how you got here? I’m pretty sure that Venom possessed you and used your body to travel all the way here. But… if he’s let go of you, that probably means-“
“Rogers! Visitor!” she calls out. Through the window, Peter can see one figure look up. Where he would have expected orange uniforms like on TV, he’s dressed in all white. His beard has grown since last time Peter saw him, and his hair, despite an attempt to make it look neat, looks like it’s everywhere.
Mr. Stark just stares at him for a little while longer, but then he lets out a breath and just shakes his head.
“Elizabeth, right,” Steve gets out. When one of the guards turn to look at them, he waves at him with a smile. Toomes does the same thing. They might be arm wrestling, for all they know. “Now, just imagine if somebody would drop a building on Elizabeth’s head. I doubt you would like that, would you?”
Peter stays quiet after that, looking down at his hands as he waits for Cap to return. His fingers are tangled together, and his lips pressed into a thin line while his foot shakes up and down.
“So you met this guy before, right?” MJ whispers into his ear while they wait for the doors to open. Peter leans back towards her.
At one point, Bruce tried to take a sample from the suit’s fabric. They cut off a piece of the suit, expecting it to fix itself back eventually. But with the sample they’ve gotten themselves, it seems stubborn as well. Holding it in a small container, Bruce tried to take it to a microscope. He wasn’t fast enough, seeing as the small piece dissolves into a black goo and evaporates itself into the air, disappearing from view.
Yaël was still running, but this time away from Peter. She made some sort of string out of the water of the pond behind her, and steered it at the green creep. Without even a hand gesture, Yaël made the string bind itself around the ankle of the Green Goblin. He fell down and got carried over the ground as Yaël made the string pull her victim back.
“Still looking up that strange black stuff we found at the crash-site,” Bruce explains. “It’s alien, that’s about all we know. I’ve been thinking about calling Strange for assistance.”
“If you want to, I can do that,” the Goblin says in his usual screechy voice; a voice that doesn’t fit Harry at all. Then he releases is grab on Peter a tiny bit, giving Peter the feeling that he’s about to fall. He lets out a shout, and suddenly grabs on to the Goblin’s hands in an attempt to hold on to something.
“Yaël, wake up, girlie…” it was Wade’s voice. She tried opening her eyes, but the sun stung so badly she kept on blinking. “Hi,” he said with a smile while carrying her out of the trash.
“Yeah, as if. I can help,” he mutters out, grabbing his mask from the ground and putting it over his head.
And sure, his medication in the past managed to make him feel a bit… ‘horny’ on some unfortunate occasions, but never really has that been directed at somebody. He mostly just took care of it on his own and never made a big deal out of it.
” he answers, closing his eyes for a few seconds before opening them again. When he does, he notices the board looking at him with questioning glances.
Tony can’t remember how often he’s awakened in a room with a heart-monitor reading him. Waking up in medical causes for him to notice too much noise around him the moment he’s out of his sleep. For some reason, though, this time Tony seems to be extra aware of it.
It’s not a question, not an invitation. If Felicia wants to follow him into the city, he’s not going to stop her. Heck, maybe talking to her will do something about this horrible mood he’s been having lately.
Now, it’s not like Johnny is heavy or anything, but nonetheless, after tonight, he’s pretty wired. By now, all he wants to do is get to bed and catch some sleep. He’s a bit out of breath when he gets to the third floor. Once he’s inside their apartment, he marches towards Johnny’s room, throws him down on the bed and heads out.
“Good evening, Peter,” Steve says, pulling his hand away. Peter just hums at him, hearing Steve make his way towards Tony. Then, at last, he looks up. Tony is still seated at his desk, working on whatever he’s working on. Steve is leaning over him, looking over his shoulder to see what’s going on. Peter can see the super soldier passing his hand over Tony’s back.
“Okay, yeah, uh, whatever,” he mutters out. Then he stuffs his mouth full of food and tries to divert his eyes from his family around him. A day of not being embarrassed around them would be great, thank you.
“You’re doing just fine on your own on that front,” he jokes. Peter rolls his eyes and leans back in his chair. Hidden behind Ned, who is seated before him, Peter takes out his (own) phone and checks it for messages. There’s something from May, giving him an update on Tony’s situation (it hasn’t changed). Next to that there’s another message from Wade Peter’s ignoring once again.
“It’s alright, Peter, they’re gone now,” she assures him. Peter blinks open one eye and slowly starts to lower his hands. Finding his dad standing there behind Natasha, he lets out an exasperated breath.
Peter hums in understanding, though still a bit curious. He knows about Dr. Octavius, of course. Ned once wrote a piece on him, and Peter had read through it to check for spelling-errors. He’s done some good work, but nothing really note-worthy that would get him in the papers.
Shit, the fight against that Mordo-guy! How did that end up? If they left him lying there, that must mean that everybody’s probably knocked out as well! Peter puts the mask back on and starts running. He vaguely recognizes where he currently is, knowing Midtown well enough after going to school there for many years. He takes the familiar shortcuts, barely aware of the few people on the streets looking at him curiously.
Slowly, he opens it up, blinking when he gets inside the dark room. He notices Peter lying on his bed, his hands on his belly while he looks up at the ceiling. He doesn’t look up when Tony walks inside, doesn’t give any affirmation that he noticed him entering the room.
“I shouldn’t- I just- I don’t want to lose you,” Steve admits shakily. “I l- love you, and I’m sorry.”
He likes to think that there are a bunch of people out there that love him, now. Steve, he’s sure of. The guy tells him every day before they go to sleep, and each time they wake up. The rest of the team… well, they’ve never particularly spoken out the words, but neither has Tony, really. They care about each other to a point where Tony might figure he’s loved as much as he loves the team in return.
“Oh, hi, Wolvie!” Wade snickered when Logan turned around to face him. “Missed ya,” the big raisin added with a wide, playful grin. Wait, was he triggering Logan while she was standing there too? Oh, no, Yaël had nothing to do with this! She didn’t want the Wolverine’s wrath upon her, so she tried to escape, but got pulled back instantly.
Having never really gotten on the receiving side of compliments given by his father, Tony hasn’t much to go on when it comes to parenting. Sure, his mother has been there a small bit for him, but mostly it’s been Tony chasing after Howard and always ending up with a door slammed in his face.
“Just kill me now,” Peter mutters. It’s not that he doesn’t like Liz; Hell, if he’d never have met Gwen, he would have fallen head over heels for her. But now, even though everything tells him that, yes, she could be a potential girlfriend, that scenario would be in a whole other universe. One where Gwen wouldn’t have been there.
“Oh no,” Peter groans out, throwing himself back on his bed and hiding his eyes underneath his hands.
“No, or, uh, yeah, kind of. Maybe… Nobody knows,” Yaël answered while rubbing her sore leg. Maybe she’s a bit more grateful for Hilde pushing her wheelchair this time, as her hand still didn’t feel alright yet either.
close to just calling May,” Tony mutters, but at the same time he’s afraid of what May will say about this. The chances are too big that Peter might crawl on another wall in her presence. They can explain the de-ageing even more easily than the fact that her nephew has been Spider-Man for the past two years.
“Uh, yeah sure, when can I come and get them?” Peter asks while clearing his throat. Above him he can see War Machine and Iron Man flying by, probably on their way to some sort of trouble downtown. Maybe he should see if he can be any help.
Simultaneously, the monitor next to him indicates that very same fact. The beeping becomes fast, notifying probably everybody at the nurse’s station. It goes on and on, until there’s a sudden crash. The sound is gone. He feels something on his back, aware of something he didn’t have before.
“Viz, you know you can call me ‘Dad’ if you want to,” Tony jokes, slapping the guy gently on the shoulder, but only getting a confused look in return.
“Hey Gwen,” Peter says lowly in a greeting. Of course there’s no answer, but every time he’s spent here, he’s always talked to her, and his mind often offered an answer that she’d probably would give. So with keeping his eyes closed, he can perfectly imagine her standing there next to him with her little bonnet on and her knee socks. Her blonde hair is soft and perfect as always, and her blue eyes are as sweet as he can remember.
A few people go to talk with Steve, ask him about the latest update on his life. Bruce even carefully approaches Natasha and the two get to a gentle conversation Peter doesn’t stick around to listen to. He checks on Yael, on Wade, and even goes to talk with Wanda.
“Good, then maybe you could help him with the test the way you helped me? They both failed, so I agreed to help them,” Peter suggests. Bruce snorts but then nods.
Ignoring all that, Yaël continued “Maybe I can make you like me a bit more, somehow. Well, or hate me less, whatever, that would be a step forward too.”
Wade finally found what he was looking for: a bottle of hair dye. He raised his hand, holding the bottle, with full glory. Yaël raised an eyebrow.
“Ain’t…gonna…happen…” Yaël huffed, still trying to break free from Hela’s grasp. When Thor andBrunnhilde tried to get to Hela, she made spears and threw those at them, so they needed to duck away again.
“Dude, you’re so lucky,” Ned even tells him when they’re on their way to class. Peter doesn’t respond.
Closing the door behind them, Tony realizes once again that he’s now officially ‘alone’ with Steve. Peter is asleep in his bedroom (and how weird is it to be able to say that?), and Steve is just standing there in front of him, looking at him like’s he’s inspecting Tony.
The Sokovia Accords. That’s how he calls it. A whole new ‘rulebook’ that would manage every enhanced individual that wants to use their powers for good. Reed goes through the book with full interest. Johnny just glares at it, and Sue, too, doesn’t feel particularly fond of it.
“I know! Get there!” he snaps back. There’s no time to be kind right now. His son’s life is on the line! He can’t even afford to be sad about all the corpses he has to run over. They can mourn about that later.
“I convinced the boss I’m clear,” Tony says with a wink, groaning a bit when he stands up and Peter, who had been in the middle of drinking, chokes on the hot liquid.
“Say, will you ever tell me why you don’t like Yaël all that much?” Peter tries, thinking back of all the times his father mentioned his purple-haired friend. Tony snorts, but keeps reading on whatever literature he’s found on his tablet.
Usually she’d just stare into the woods from her cage while the blonde man would just stare at her with his blue eyes. Why was it this time all so different?Yaël’s heart started to race even faster as she started to panic. Why the heck was she locked up like some kind of weird, wild lab-animal?
Tony shrugs. “That’s a story for another time,” he says, clearing his throat. “Listen, Peter. I think there’s something I need you to know.”
FRIDAY answers. Sassy girl, Tony snorts before going to the turnabout-thing. It looks a bit out of place, as if it’s much newer than the other stuff. After a slight pull, he understands that it’s probably been installed much later.
At lunch, their break lasts an hour. Somebody brings in sandwiches, and most of them head outside to get a bit of fresh air. Peter just goes and sit with his friends for a bit. Nobody says anything when Johnny sits with them, pretending like he’s been part of the group since the beginning. Nobody minds, either. Wade even seems to like the sudden addition.
There have been a few occasions in which Peter has been wondering what exactly he did to derserve this. Sure, his Dad loves him, and so does Steve, and he now has a whole family of Avengers out there that cares about him. But as it is, he can't help but wonder once or twice why he couldn't have just been normal?
“And that’s why I love you,” Tony says with a grin. Steve winks at him, heading out of the room without saying anything else. That’s when Tony lets out a long sigh, sitting down on the bed again and putting a hand on his hurting leg. He shouldn’t have been walking like that so carelessly, but it seems like even Steve has forgotten about it.
Catching their breath, nobody says anything. Peter is already wearing his mask again, leaning forward with a hand on his stomach. Giving it a quick look, Tony notes that there’s nothing to be seen on the suit. But bruises can always hide underneath.
"It's still cold, but I'm sure that's no problem for you," Peter says with a grin. Johnny snorts before blowing into his drink. In just a matter of seconds it's heated up. Then he holds out his hand towards Peter.
Breakfast goes on without much more said. Peter finishes his plate, thanks Steve for preparing it, and then moves towards the living room to take a good look inside that tablet. It’s best to give the adults a little moment together after all.
“I’m sorry for being so distracted, too,” she returns. It seems like they both understand they need to work on talking to each other more. After getting rid of Venom, that’s the first thing Peter’s going to do. Phone calls, bi-weekly visits, whatever else.
His head aches, his stomach feels just as horrible. What exactly happened? He remembers going to the party with Johnny, but everything pretty much became a blur after that. There’s a slight memory of Felicia an Johnny dancing together. He remembers Flash telling him something – actually telling him instead of shouting it at him. Peter groans once more as he realizes his curtains are on the floor.
Steve doesn’t respond anymore, meaning that he’s thinking about it. That’s all Tony could ask for, really. He just takes a deep breath and closes his eyes for a bit. He barely even realizes he’s fallen asleep until he wakes up under the covers, Steve’s hand on his arm with Peter cocooned safely between them.
getting yourself a girlfriend!” Ned says enthusiastically. With a mouth fallen open, Peter turns to his friend.
“Where is he?” Peter asks. It’s on that instant that a strong chill passes over Peter. While he’s been on edge the entire evening, this time it seems different. It’s like an immediate danger, coming closer. Steps, a person, a bit bigger build than Peter, nearing them.
An apartment isn’t all that great without the awesome roommate, he figures. He needs to get talking to Johnny soon, make sure they get all their shit cleared out quick! While yawning, Peter starts walking to his bedroom.
Cure for Wellness: The doctors are put in front of a mystery when it comes to the matter of the Green Goblin
After that, Peter is gone, and as if an unseen force has pushed him, Tony falls down onto his chair and his whole body just becomes so heavy that he feels like he might sink through the floor. His chest is hurting; from his quick breathing or his fast heartbeat, he doesn’t know. He’s actually sweating, and he doesn’t know if he’s imagining his muscles tensing and relaxing continuously.
And the Avengers hurry inside the Quinjet at last. Before the hatch closes, Steve blows Tony a kiss, but all Tony does is glare at him. He’s enjoying this; making Tony wait. The asshole. Tony waits until the q-Quinjet is out of sight before he turns back to get inside again. He decides to just get to the kitchenette and prepare a coffee. He could just watch some TV, or maybe try and finish his last invention, but with how riled up he is right now, he figures he might start breaking things without meaning to.
Peter takes a quick look around. They’re not all seated on the same couch. Wade is seated on the ground, eating strawberry-flavored popcorn (which Peter tasted and personally found disgusting). On the complete end of the couch are Ned and Harry. The former is already falling asleep, while Harry is pretending all he can not to act on the jump scares. He’s failing, though, since Peter can feel the couch moving every time it happens.
There are times where Tony would say that being a parent is the best thing in the world. That time is actually almost always, but that’s probably because his son is just the perfect son, in his very honest opinion. Peter does well at school, he doesn’t do any illegal stuff, doesn’t smoke or drink, and when he brings home a girl – not often – it’s a really kind one who can deal with the fact that Peter’s not really that into… yeah, no, that’s not really a thing Tony needs to be thinking about.
Rhodey walks off, heading towards where Tony is pointing him to. Pepper, on the other hand, keeps on glaring down at him.
Yaël felt a bit nervous as she was standing in front of door, leading to the compound’s gymnasium/training room. Something flew passed right next to her ear as soon as she opened the door. With a shocked yelp, Yaël looked aside to see what it was. An arrow, stuck in the side of the door, was still wiggling from the speed it had been making.
Neither is he mentioning the thousands of subtle glances the two adults here are giving each other. They’re like lovestruck teenagers, and Peter is almost ready to run out of the room from the frustration they’re creating.
“Yeah, that’s alright,” he says, picking it up from the ground and handing it to her before holding out his hand. Chrissy gives him her phone and quickly starts posing with the shield.
Peter sighs, then. They shouldn’t feel guilty about that; they couldn’t know, after all. It’s not like Peter ever really spoke about it.
Peter shoves him in the arm because laughing along. Leaning back to the side, he crosses his arms and gives Tony a fake glare.
Tony sighs. He can’t stand this, can’t stand the idea that his boy is sick like this. It seems like May has equal difficulty dealing with it, the way her eyes stay stuck on Peter’s form.
Now, the fun part…Yaël bowed down to pull out her shoes and socks and started hissing already as she couldn’t avoid pressing her upper body against her wound. After a few minutes, which felt like hours, she could finally start wrestling herself out of her pants. Sometimes she even needed to take a break.
Peter nods, agreeing with that fact. He’d been there during the protest, after all. She dragged the whole decathlon team along! It had been cold, snowing, and even Peter, who was wearing his suit underneath, was shivering from it.
Tony sighs, leaning his head to the side until it’s resting against Steve’s chest. Without speaking they start up the movie. It feels good, indeed almost as if they’re back to that first month together, where Peter still went to high school. That time where most of their troubles hadn’t happened yet.
“That’s okay, baby. We’ll make a rain-check, alright?” Not that he was intending on having sex right now. Seeing Steve drunk has mostly been fun , but it hasn’t exactly improved Tony’s lust for the evening. Tony undoes his belt and pulls his pants off in one swift motion.
Missions had been easier than dealing with his feelings. Of course, Steve hadn’t really understood what he had been running from at the time. He just blamed it on his discomfort being around Stark, because that’s what it was after all.
“I’m kind of starting another revolution, wanna join?” Didn’t she have to wait for Loki? But on the other hand, would Loki have waited for her? He’s probably long gone already. He hadn't even informed her about a plan of some sort.
It’s not that things are going crappy at school. The classes aren’t too hard, Ned is by his side, and even Michelle isn’t as annoying as always. But no matter how nice everybody is being today, he’s still having a horrible time.
“You do know I love you, right?” Tony suddenly feels the urge to say. Steve’s breath catches in his throat. Then he closes his eyes, leaning into Tony’s touch gratefully.
He repeats it every time. Again and again, and for the past three hours he hasn’t had another one of these panic attacks. It’s going good for now. He’s fine, so far. There’s been visitors, but only for a short amount of time. Out of respect for the other patients on the department, visiting hours have been reduced to two hours a day, those hours being divided on two different moments during the day. Pepper’s been here earlier, telling him about what’s going on in the outside world, what she’s telling the press. Tony wants to ask her about Happy, but he’s afraid that if he talks, he’ll forget again.
Oh and the cheekbones, his cheekbones were pure art. Yaël finally straightened her back and threw him a small smile, as nervous as she was, she really wished he’d just stop talking to her. Yaël sat back down and sipped from her water, trying not to look at the guy. It was almost funny how Yaël noticed she needed a lot of alcohol to be able to talk to gorgeous-looking creatures. Well, even then she skipped the gorgeous ones and she just went for the normal ones who didn’t stress her out at all.
Shit, Peter thinks that he’s starting to understand it. Thinking back to one of Strange’s lessons he once decided to give when Peter found himself at the Sanctum (he only had to deliver him something for crying out loud), Strange did say something about the multiverse. With other words…
“Cool,” he answers, not finding any other words for it. Eventually the two sit down at the desk. Tony opens the case, takes out the book Steve’s group corrected and puts it down on the table. T’Challa, seated in front of Tony, takes it and gives the pages a quick look.
“Cem,” she interrupted him, remembering bits and pieces of the story. Cem, her dad, had been a big, muscular man with a grey beard, long, grey hair that was almost always braided and happy wrinkles of laughter under his eyes. His grey hair fitted with his blue eyes, blue because of being able to steer water, like a piece of art.
“You’ve got to be kidding me, mom!” Peter calls out in annoyance, sitting in the park after getting the booklet back and taking his time to go through it again. He drops the journal down on the grass and leans his head back against the tree he was sitting in front of. Talk about cliffhangers, for crying out loud.
Quickly, Tony gets dressed, hurrying out of the hotel room without bothering to be quiet anymore. If he wakes up those girls, he doesn’t particularly care.
“Hah! You should have seen your face!” the guy shouts out in full amusement, hands resting on his stomach as he leans back in his chair and throws his head back in his shoulder. “No no no, I was kidding, I just need the bill, and then I want to hire you as my personal pizza-delivery boy.” That last one is said with wiggling eyebrows, and Peter knows full enough when he’s flirted with and when not, and this, right now, is the guy full on suggesting things.
But Peter doesn’t take that lightly. He finally turns, and gets himself off the ledge. Then he points towards the boat. The whole scrap of useless junk.
“Fine, just… stay away from him, okay? I know it sounds kind of… mean from him, but I really think he can’t handle it right now.” Yaël cocked her eyebrow at Steve and he simply stared back. They were doing a little who-would-win-the-imposing-stare-battle, like real adults do. Steve stared at her to make sure she got the message and Yaël stared back just to show him he’d not impose her by staring like that.
“There was no reason for me to complain, of course, but then they died” Mr. Stark then continues, and then his eyes meet Peter’s, and he looks serious. “I was only a little bit older than you are when I was diagnosed with major depressive disorder. It almost killed me, too.”
“Eh, yeah, kind of.” That was vague, and unfair. She had the right to know what she had done, but Steve was persistent and kept his mouth shut. His lips even turned a bit white from pressing them together after Yaël tried to get the story out of him by keeping asking questions while poking him.
“Excuse me!” Yaël snapped back. “Isn’t that exactly what you’ve done to me?! Remember? The Chitauri?!” Loki lost his self-assurance for just a split-second, Yaël noticed as his eyebrows dropped for a moment. He almost looked sad... And then it was gone again.
“Be safe, okay?” he asks. Peter can’t believe how much he’s grown on the man in such a small amount of time.
“Yeah, so maybe you should put on some clothes,” Wade told her. Yaël looked down. She was still walking around with only a towel bound around her body from getting out of the shower.
“Eh, you know, I found myself with a lot of free time and I could use a break,” Mr. Stark then says. He leans forward to turn on the heating and then leans back in his seat. “Besides, I thought I would take you along for a little ride. I expect you could use some distraction, no?”
“Now, for the matter of the Avengers and their role in the former disagreement with the accords,” the man starts immediately afterwards. Peter closes his eyes and sighs. He’d forgotten that they’d indeed not discussed this yet. Tony notices his discomfort and squeezes his shoulder for a moment.
Peter sighs before reaching for his phone again. He doesn’t care how late it is, he just searches for Harry’s number and presses down to call him. Right now, he needs somebody to talk to. And sure, he knows he has a lot of people that are currently located in America that he can reach, but right now the only person he needs is his old best friend.
Tony frowns but then decides not to worry about that right now. It’s not his biggest concern right now, though he might have to keep a closer watch on the kid if he can manage to bypass FRIDAY’s system.
“What’s wrong, Peter?” she asks in a worry. Of course, she’s always the first one to come at his side whenever something even seems to be going wrong. She might like his company a bit
“We were wondering who takes it in the ass,” Clint says, crudely. The coffee comes up the wrong way, and Tony almost literally spits it back out until the three men are covered with it. Steve’s red face now not only has shame on it, but also anger.
If the people had been shouting earlier, now they’re all just breaking each other’s ears and their own throats. Despite that, despite the fact that LL and Chrissy try to keep the program going, Tony refuses to let go of Steve.
“I need to go,” Peter mutters, clearing his throat before pulling his hood back up. Behind him, the doors burst open, surely with Tony storming outside.
the time, obviously – but he’s such a heavy sleeper that Peter walking by with heavy footsteps would not wake him at all.
“Dude, if your girlfriend would be in the hospital wouldn’t you want to go and see her?” Sam counters.
“There you go,” Yaël mumbled as she tried not to step on the unconscious bodies while searching for keys. The more keys they had, the quicker they could release the prisoners instead of fiddling with the locks for too long.
But once Steve returns with Tony right behind him, there seems to be a sudden shift in his mood. He’s smiling when he watches the grumpy billionaire sitting down on the stool next to Peter, already preparing another coffee for him to drink. All Tony says when the cup is handed to him is a grunted ‘thanks’ before he points down as a signal for Steve to just put it on the counter. Peter watches it all happen with lots of confusion going through him.
, and that’s when Peter figured out that the man wasn’t on a business-trip somewhere; he was just simply not showing up for work.
“There was stuff happening, people were getting hurt and I couldn’t just run out like you wanted me to. I had to stop him before people got hurt!”
“In case you’ve forgotten, I’ve designed a few quinjets. I can make the trip in about two hours! Now get dressed, we’ll leave in fifteen minutes.”
“Oh my God, what happened?!” he asks, already pulling at Peter’s arm until it’s hanging over his shoulder. Mr. Stark does the same, and together they start guiding him back inside. Peter wants to protest, because he can walk fine on his own – thank you very much – but then decides against it when he feels how much his back aches, again.
Steve opens up a door for him, nodding inside as a gesture for Peter to move forward. Peter hesitates only a little bit before clearing his throat and getting in.
“I broke up-? Why would I do that? Peter where’s Steve? Why isn’t Steve here?” Tony’s breathing gets harder, and he starts to sit up despite the strain it puts on his body. Peter frowns in worry; Tony’s never reacted like this! Mostly it’s just ‘oh’ or ‘okay’. He’s never been in panic about it.
Peter swallows, forcing himself to walk forward a bit, but still not arriving at the door before he stops himself once more.
“THANOS KILLED HULK’S FRIEND!” he shouts out. Tony doesn’t listen further to it. Having finally reached Peter, he drops down on his knees and reaches out for him. He’s aware of the other person lying down on their back. Loki is already sitting by them, so Tony can only just imagine who it is.
Shit, Pepper’s here. Tony scoffs while rubbing his forehead. He grunts while attempting to sit up. He fails.
Ned shrugs. “You convince him to do the DNA-test again? I’m sure he’ll believe you once he’ll get the truth.”
This is the third time already that the Goblin has gotten the better of him. This is not okay. Peter hurries towards the mirror to look at his neck, finding dark bruises where Harry’s fingers had been. Touching them hurts, so Peter stays away from it, grabbing a hoodie and putting it on. It hides the bruises enough for Aunt May not to notice.
So when someone knocked on the door of her apartment, Yaël was rolled into a blanket, watching series, drinking a small glass of whiskey. She hoped the liquid would make her feel warm. Yaël growled as she heard the knock and rolled herself back out of her blanket.
“Alright, you can come,” Tony finally says. Peter jumps up into the air, running towards Tony and wrapping his arms around him. As he hugs him tightly, Tony lets out a small chuckle. “Just promise me you’ll stay away from Johnny Storm, alright? I don’t need his bad influence to get on you!”
She woke up in a metal hallway that seemed to be donut-shaped. With a grunt, Yaël rubbed her head. Jesus Christ, how many times was she going to get knocked out again? And where the hell was she?
Tony is tinkering with a heating layer he’s going to add into the fabric of the suit when Peter curses and something falls down to the ground. Tony startles, immediately glancing to where Peter is sitting   finding him at his usual desk – because he’s already got his
“Uh, it’s past four in the afternoon?” Peter remarked. Yaël gave the coffee-machine a little loving tap for giving her the warm drink. Then Peter’s words sunk in.
That would all have been better than this. Not being recognized by your own parent? Peter blinks twice before looking back up at the girl.
“I’m in pursuit,” he snaps, throwing himself back in the air and racing towards the guy. In only a few seconds does he land right in front of him. The man jumps back in surprise, his dark, messy blonde hair swinging in front of his face for a moment. He’s unshaven, looking vaguely familiar in Peter’s eyes.
“Liz, hi,” Peter greets her. Liz nervously pulls her hair behind her ear and shuffles a bit on her feet.
Johnny counters that. Tony rolls his eyes. Of course, boys will be boys and Peter is still a teenager, but Tony would have hoped he’d known better than to sneak into Strange’s place.
Steve entertained them for twenty minutes or so. They couldn’t give them more. Tony called out for Peter, Steve guided the Avengers back to the elevator and promised they’ll do some group-activity tonight. Bruce stays, though. He’s shown interest in coming to Octavius’ demonstration, and Tony figures it wouldn’t hurt that much if he would tag along.
Peter smiles before wishing Harry good luck. They dropped him off very early in the morning, and he’s been on the way for almost ten hours already. Peter’s still a bit sad that he’s gone for such a long time, but he believes that travelling will really help the guy.
Pepper’s not giving him her annoyed glare, which probably means that she’s agreeing with him here. Good, because he would have seriously doubted her sanity if she’d actually gone with their idea.
“Cab-drivers are crazy, these days,” is all Peter says. Mr. Stark just gives him a long look before sighing and nodding back towards the elevator. Peter nods as well, straightening his shirt a bit and throwing Lincoln a nervous glance. The guy holds his thumbs up.
Writing has been getting a bit better again! Hurray! I missed last week's mid-week posting because I ran a chapter short, but this time I have a few more written down! So here you go, some more actual shit. I'm sorry. I'm still sick, my ears are constantly ringing and I've been listening to the Ring of Fire by Johnny Cash on repeat.
On his way to the kitchenette, he comes across Peter’s phone on the counter. It’s vibrating, a vaguely familiar tune indicating that he’s getting a phone call. Tony takes the phone into his hand, but doesn’t pick up.
“Tony, stop it!” Steve calls out, grabbing Tony’s arm and pulling him to a stop. Tony freezes, keeps on standing there unmoving. He needs to pull himself loose, needs to get away now. “Can’t you understand that I’m trying to talk to you about something?”
“Dude, aren’t you supposed to get your flirt of the day right now?” Peter tries. Johnny blinks in confusion before looking around. That arm around Peter’s neck never really disappears. Johnny hiccups before being pushed forward, even closer to Peter.
“I’m pretty sure Steve loves that.” Pepper has this fond look on her face. “But, Tony, I’m sorry about what I said earlier. About Peter…”
Once the elevator announces that he’s up, Peter steps through the doors and looks around for a bit. There’s only one large door that he sees; the only entrance to the Penthouse that he knows of – except for maybe the balcony, but Peter’s not ready to try that one out again.
“Can you just… give me a moment to process this? Please?” Peter suddenly begs of him. Tony feels sadness coming all over him. He just wishes he wouldn’t have had to tell Peter all this. But, he deserves to know.
As it turns out, Wade and Johnny Storm aren’t the best combination. In an attempt to prove who is the biggest lightweight, the two end up drunk off their asses and causing destruction almost everywhere they go. Jean Grey is sitting at the bar a little further away, using her telekinetic powers to clean up their messes. Sue tries desperately to pull her brother away from his drinking partner.
“I don’t know!” he grumbled, obviously frustrated “I’ve been breaking my head about this, but I just can’t get to a simple plan.” Yaël saw Peter frown in annoyance as he kicked against a stone, which flew into the pond.
“I can take the suit,” Tony starts, voice cracking. Natasha squeezes his shoulder in reassurance. Tony sniffs, drying his eyes before continuing. “But you know that won’t stop him. He’ll always find a way to be Spider-Man.”
Peter had muttered out, not bothering to mask his voice any longer. Steve had stopped in his tracks for a moment, clearly thinking. After that, he disappeared anyway. And Peter got back to his feet, deciding to annoy Sam and Barnes for a moment. Then there was the giant dude, the Star Wars reference that came too close to revealing who he really is – especially to Tony. Ever since Rhodey’s drop and Tony’s angry shout, he’s been lying on his back, waiting for Happy to come and pick him up.
“So, how did you two meet?” May asks. And now that’s a story Tony is curious about, too. To him, it seems like Felicia was somehow always there, no?
“Wow, he must really be angry, then,” Tony mutters. He reaches out his hand towards the phone and takes it in his hand. Checking the time, he sees that it’s only nine in the evening, but probably past visiting hours. There are another few missed calls on the screen, all of them of Steve – of course, since nobody else has this number. Tony sighs, closes his eyes and puts the phone against his chest.
“Yaël, I’m pretty sure that you’re talking about a father-daughter dance, so maybe we have to wait for that when you get married, right? Since you’re not my dad and I’m not your daughter either.” Yaël looked up, still holding him, ready to dance.
He can’t make two steps before there’s a chilling sensation going over him. Something is being thrown at him! Peter pulls his head back, and surely something comes flying right in front of him, missing him only by a few millimeters.
“Why don’t you try getting your brush by using your powers?” he said casually while he was still baking. A string of water was already bringing her brush before the guy could even look up.
Sharon is somewhere at the side, drinking and talking with Natasha. Peter still finds it weird to see her as a blonde, but he figures he can get used to it. He prefers the red hair, though.
Of course some people had noticed Yaël and Loki walking out of the shower-department together and splitting their ways afterwards. In the following hours, she got stared at and heard gossips coming from all around her. To what fucking planet did she have to move to not get stared at?
I still feel like I'm forgetting a lot of things. If that's the case, don't be afraid to point them out so I can make sure to round everything up in the following few chapters.
assistant for that,” Mr. Stark says. Peter pulls the shirt all the way down, wondering if this one shouldn’t actually be considered as a tent, instead. It’s obviously big enough for it, anyway. “Okay, now just stand here.”
“Well, I told her that I showed my homework to Francis to have him check it out, but then Dum-E put it away somewhere when he cleared my desk so I forgot about it, but then she thought that I was just making it up because who would call their robot Dummy and-“
Peter feels himself grin when the guy presses a button to open the door. The students jump back in surprise, making a little path for the two to pass.
But before he can say what he wants to say Mary announces that they’ve arrived. Tony gets himself out of the car and quickly follows the woman inside. It’s extremely weird to hang out with her again. Almost as if nothing has changed. Except for the way he feels about her, that is.
“Tony, can you stop joking about this? You could have died! Can you just imagine how Steve would have reacted?”
Even after Harry’s asked the question, and though MJ hurried off right after she said ‘yes’, both Ned and Peter can’t but stare at their friend seated at their table with a surprised yet confused expression. After all; why
Oh, please, Yaël reacted bitterly in her mind. But Charles was right, she really didn’t need to destroy the city once again. So she breathed in deeply and closed her eyes. When she opened them again, the cab driver, who actually looked scared as hell, pulled over at the cab at the airport. Yaël threw the door of the car open, took her stuff and got out, to be greeted by young Charles.
“I feel fine,” he admits. “Maybe a little headache, but I guess I can’t complain too much about that.”
"Yaël, please don't play with fire against me, you have enough tricks up your sleeve without putting me ablaze."
“Go ahead.” Yaël took her phone and opened Steve’s text. Indeed, she hadn’t answered. He had texted her the day after she got at the school, so, two days ago.
“Tony, I’m going to help Thor rehearse his vows, I’m not going to play some sort of game or something,” Steve mutters, still leaning forward while he waits for his kiss.
After a few minutes, Tony even pushes against Steve’s shoulder, making them roll over until Tony’s laying above Steve. Resting on top of him and not bothering to lighten his weight, he pulls his head back at last and just rests it on Steve’s chest.
“It’s the least you can do after ruining my relationship and using me to break into my dad’s stuff!” Peter shouts at her. Felicia’s eyes go wide at that comment. Then she scowls.
That’s what they’re being called. If anybody asks Tony, it’s just a knock-off from the Avengers, but who is he to judge?
He isn’t lying when he says that he’s on his way to the tower to hang out with Tony for a bit. He’s saying the truth, but he’s just not mentioning that he’s doing a few more stops on the way. So he gets off the train a few stops too soon, goes to buy his stuff at Delmar’s Deli-Grocery, hurries himself into a small alley, and gets out of his clothes.
To be honest, Tony wants nothing more than to see Steve. He misses him, so much that it constantly hurts the scar on his chest. He’s on a permanent feeling of suffocation, and at night the nightmares have become too real now that there’s no Steve there beside him.
Having her in front of him, he realizes that any kind of romantic love he felt for her has now disappeared somehow. He loves her still, yes, but something’s shifted.
“So what’s his name?” Yaël thought for a second, back then, the man once told her what his name was, but he never repeated it in her dreams.
He still breathes heavily, eyes constantly squeezed shut as he tries to hold in the tears. He hates feeling like this. This shouldn’t happen anymore, yet it still does lately… Dr. Wynedell already had a blood sample taken to find out if there’s reasons as to why his medication seems to be failing lately.
“The fact that you have more chance there to bump into Logan, so you can annoy the shit out of him?” Yaël’s horse went down. It was a white one with golden and dark-green detailing. “No, I mean, okay yes, that too… Wait a minute, he also loves to hunt me down! Don’t tell me he never annoyed you so much yet that you wanted to behead him!”
“Can you use that override code of yours to get FRIDAY to send us back to the Compound?” he asks. Peter nods, instructing FRIDAY to do so, then, and receiving an affirmative. Then, after a short goodbye and a quick thanks, the two are off, the suit holding Mr. Stark inside and carrying Steve along for the flight. Peter watches them go until he can’t see them anymore.
A small ‘oof’ escapes his mouth when he’s thrown on the couch. Steve then leans over him, lips only millimeters apart from each other. The two men are smirking, only vaguely aware that Peter is sleeping in the room a bit further away. They can’t make too much noise.
Tony lets out a heavy breath but nods as he holds out his hand towards Bruce. Wordlessly, he pulls him back onto his feet before nodding to the side.
Tony finishes filling in the form, afterwards offering the paper back to Peter with his pen pointing at an empty line.
About a week after Tony’s admittance in the hospital Steve figures he’s had enough of it. He’s stronger than T’Challa’s guards, and they won’t shoot at him. At all. What makes him hesitate even more? Steve’s about ready to run out of his room and hurry to T’Challa’s plane when suddenly somebody knocks on his window. Steve turns around, finding Natasha standing there.
been trying to get me to try it out, but I have been hesitating between here and Oscorp,” he says. Tony raises an eyebrow at the mention of Oscorp, but he doesn’t take it personal at all; Oscorp is good for the
“I feel great, especially now,” Peter says, pulling away from Natasha while the grin on his face stays wide. After that, Peter turns towards Barnes, who is still standing next to Natasha, though a bit awkwardly. “We’ve met before, but I’m Peter.”
Tony stays quiet, face falling and all color draining from his cheeks. His mouth has fallen open, and immediately,
“Other than constantly suing us for destruction of your property and slandering the entire organization? The constant boycotting and insulting? Nothing much, really.”
“This is awesome,” Peter mutters, taking another good look at what his father is creating. “That way you can protect yourself when you don’t have the suit near?”
How was this man actually ably to look so calm, serene, like nothing that she would be able to do could freak him out? Yaël told him about her two dreams and he just kept listening, he didn’t interrupt her once. After she told the story, she didn’t feel like she was a weirdo or anything.
“I don’t think it’s that easy, Johnny,” Reed starts, but Johnny shakes his head before standing up as well.
Tony can see on Peter’s face that there’s something bothering him when he gets out of his bedroom. He figures it’s probably that sudden Avengers-meeting in the elevator that surely caught him off guard. And for what reason, even? They all just simultaneously decided to come up and watch some TV together? Do they need group-activities
That is, until he walks on something. Looking down to see what’s under his foot, he finds, much to his surprise, that the whole floor is covered with toys. Plushies, squeaking things, Barbie dolls. Tony leans forward and takes one of the dolls into his hands.
“Why not?” Peter asks in response to Tony’s remark. The inventor shrugs without taking his eyes away from the tablet.
Dr. Palmer falls quiet when Peter walks inside. Happy notices him immediately and takes a step to the side, giving Peter room to get closer. Tony is just blinking, but the moment Peter is standing next to him, he smiles at last. A cold chill passes through Peter when he sees the yellow color of Tony’s skin. That’s not how he left him last night.
Yaël turned back to Peter. “How do you plan to get to know him?” she asked. Peter’s story was kind of sensational. But she didn’t want to disrespect him, because for Peter it seemed to be only stressful, so she didn’t show him how excited she was.
By the time they’ve practically pulled out the entire wall, The reaction implodes. Peter grabs both Steve and Tony and swings them out through a broken window to avoid the flames that come up before they’re sucked back inside. The three of them are outside when all the noise has died down.
“You’re all idiots,” he mumbles. He puts his cup down on the table and gets into the long hallway that leads to the front door of the building. One of the biggest reasons as to why Peter wants to get her personally is because she’s never been to the compound before.
“Well, eh,” Wanda muttered, “Stark knows he is his son now…” Oh, did he? Great! That was actually great news, but Yaël couldn’t hold her own sarcasm. She tried fighting it, she wasn’t stupid. It was clear Peter had been too busy and that he had been unfortunate to get into such an accident with Harry again. This had been no fun for him, Yaël knew that, but she couldn’t help herself.
“Da- uh… Mr. Stark? I haven’t seen you in a while,” Peter says quickly, hating the fact that he’s back to ‘mr. Stark’ right now.
“There’s a bathroom right behind you. Most people use these when they feel the urge of taking off their clothes.”Of course, Wanda’s reply was more morally correct than Yaël’s, but yet she deserved a high-five from Yaël for dissing Peter. The teenager glanced at them sarcastically while continuing to put the suit on.
She would have helped him figure it out. She would have been by his side when he’d have his talk with Stark. She’d help him find his words when Peter couldn’t.
Peter turns around in surprise, seeing the Black Cat standing there with her hands on her hips. The lipstick she was wearing is a bit smudged. He clears his throat, averting his eyes from those strong green eyes, or that cleavage that suddenly seems to be standing out even more.
“Dad, what are the ‘accords’?” Peter asks, shouting it into the hallway. He knows Tony is still in his room, preparing a suitcase that he would bring along. That means that he won’t be back soon.
“Wait a minute-“ Peter mumbles out. He does indeed remember Gwen mentioning something about an ex, but she never called him by name. After all, they had been only fourteen back then; no relationship is serious at that age!
“I met somebody, too. It was MJ, I don’t know if you remember her from school?” Gwen nods. “We were together, not for that long, though. The suit kind of ruined it…”
After a little while of just staring at a complicated painting hanging on the wall, Yaël’s hand suddenly hurt. She looked down and saw that she unwittingly had put her cup on glass the table in front of her and she had started scratching the rug of her left hand. A handling that always indicated that Yaël was panicking. It was a reaction from the accident. Even though she always tried to hide it, panic was a common trait of hers.
“You keep on being saddled up with our problems all the time,” Tony mutters out. He can’t help it, he feels guilty. Sure, nobody can blame Peter for feeling the way he is, but Tony just can’t believe that he put Steve through the exact same situation once before.
“Peter!” Tony shouts. He runs to Peter, pulling his sunglasses from his face and showing his tired, red eyes. The moment he reaches Peter, the teenager is pulled into his arms, holding him in a strong hug. “Don’t
“Yeah, I’m fine Mr. Stark,” Peter says. He smiles, but it’s not visible through the mask. Tony then goes to shake Susan’s and Reed’s hand.
Peter noticed Yaël’s thoughts had drifted off, so he decided to let go of the subject and her be wherever she was in her head.
“No! We’re just friends, we have nothing planned,” he mutters out, trying not to think back on that almost-kiss during senior prom.
So, there’s enough reason to go for biochemistry, right? But, then, why do his eyes always move back to the electrical engineering folder on his bed?
“Hey Bruciebear, I’m sending you more stuff to your tablet,” Tony says, only using his mind to do so. Bruce’s tablet makes an affirming sound after receiving the files.
This must be the ‘badassium’, Peter figures. He watches as Steve puts it down on Mr. Stark’s bed, who opens the box and takes the pincer into his hand. Then he nods towards Peter.
Steve smiles and shakes his head. After everybody has gotten their weapons, Tony leans towards the table where he starts writing a few things down. Peter, Harry and Wanda hold up their hands, giving each other a high-five. Even if they're not going to win this, they'll still have fun at least.
“Thank you, I’ll just take them with me,” Peter tells her. The woman – Peter remembers that her name was Linda – nods and smiles even wider than before if that’s even possible (she almost looks like the dental-model they didn’t pick because of the most exaggerated smile).
He might be appearing calm all the time, and he tries his damnest hard to appear it, but if he’s completely honest he feels like he’s about to break apart at any moment. Not only did Peter’s small ‘I don’t feel so good’ trigger him in many ways, the idea that whatever’s going on with Peter might have been inevitable is sickening even more.
The tower is dark when Tony arrives back. There’s a quinjet on the landing platform, the sunlight is shining brightly onto his skin – a stark contrast in comparison to the cold he felt back in Siberia – and the inside of the penthouse is clearly darkened.
“No, Tony, you have to stay here,” Rhodey says, squeezing his shoulder once. Tony blinks a few times, but then frowns.
Not that that was bad, right? No, that wasn’t bad! Loki probably didn’t even care about her, never had. But why would he even care to visit her dreams then? Whatever, Yaël had a George- errr- Jason running around on earth who was definitely more handsome than Loki, less unpredictable and had the same who had amount of arrogance.
“But you can be one, with powers like yours!” What could Yaël say? That she didn’t feel like a person to look up to? That she had the feeling she has done some horrible things in her past? She was no example, no hero. Yaël couldn’t even fully control her own powers.
Maybe they don’t need to crash, after all. For a moment, he had actually forgotten that he’s Spider-man.
Clint). Natasha and Barnes stepped out. So did Bruce and Rhodey. Vision’s still there, but Wanda took some time off. Sam’s only doing a few missions…
“You just don’t understand, boys,” Harry says after a few minutes of silent staring. Harry takes out his phone and starts going through it. He doesn’t have a lot of numbers, and he’s not even allowed to get a Facebook account despite his false name. The thing is mostly for show, to play games or to listen to music. “You’re right, why MJ? Well, I’ve been with fake girls all the time. They only cared about my money. But now that I don’t
“I’m trying to prove a point to Wilson here,” James explains, pointing towards Sam, who rolls his eyes in return.
? Don’t even try to shit us here, Parker.” Michelle says, loud enough for the guy behind them to hear. Unfortunately, that person turns out to be nobody other than Flash, who seems more than happy to push Peter’s face against the table for no reason other than to be annoying.
“Say, Rhodey, why do I even have to be there? Nobody knows who I am?” Peter asks when he’s sure Rhodey’s in the bathroom to put down the clothes. He knows there’s going to be reporters, people will take pictures. It will be kind of obvious when a random kid will just be appearing there, right?
“Care to go to Washington?” he asks, a little uncertain in his words. Peter blinks a few times before nodding. After that, they’re off to the compound, where they take one of the smaller quinjet and lift off, away from New York.
Peter walks on, getting out of what seems like the living room and instead finding himself in front of some stairs. Seated on it is a girl, who looks like she’s already passed out. Peter carefully shifts her so she’s leaning against the wall instead of being hunched forward. He’s sure her back will appreciate that a little bit more.
Mr. Stark just waves it off before facing Peter again. Then he nods towards the chair he had been sitting on, pointing at the backpack. Without having to say anything, Peter understands completely what he wants. He hurries back inside the office, takes his bag, and then hurries after Mr. Stark, who is already making his way out.
“There must be stuff for drawing blood around here,” she utters to herself as she starts looking around. Tony just shivers on the spot, blinking a few times before taking the vial into his own hand. The blood is a usual red, cold to the touch through the glass. In here is currently the stuff that’s killing Peter. It’s strange how this works. Tony has since long given up trying to find out the details about time travel. It’s a lost cause.
“I was, uh, I found it in your office. Tony left it here. I was going to check up on Harry and-“ he stops talking. His heart is beating like crazy, because he’s
Peter blinks then. Does… does Harry not remember anything of what happened after he took the venom? Is that why they haven’t talked about this sooner? But what will happen when he finds it out, then? Will he snap again?
Hope you enjoy the chapter. Proof read by myself, so please point out anything I've missed. It's about 1:31 in here, I had an evening shift at the hospital, and I'm exhausted, so I might have missed a few things!
“Well, uh… it’s mostly fine, I guess? It’s mostly that the Avengers are heading out again tomorrow in search of that guy, and Dad doesn’t really seem happy about it.”
“I hear from MJ who heard from Felicia, who heard from Johnny who I think heard from May that you weren’t doing so hot, so I figured I’d come back and help bring my best friend back on his feet,” Harry says, shrugging like it’s not that big a deal. Then he looks down at Peter’s entire form. “You were heading out?”
“Mr. Tony Stark?” he asks in surprise. Tony’s mouth falls open. Mary just looks at their son proudly.
“If I’m honest, I have no idea what we’re dealing with. It’s like he’s got almost all the symptoms at once. Joint pain in his hands, visual disruption. His hearing has gone to shit again but I suspect the MRI caused that to his regulator.”
“Wait, Hela did that, didn’t she? Goddammit!” Yaël gave Hilde a few minutes to curse. Then, when the woman was finally silent and was just staring at the wall angrily, Yaël dared to ask.
“A gentleman never kisses and tells,” he says dismissingly before opening his arm towards Steve, waiting for him to hook his own arm into it. “Shall we go, Cap?”
“As you wish, Iron Man,” Harry says, doing exactly what Peter expected him to do. The hands under his shoulders slip away, and Peter feels himself lowering down a bit. Except, his grip on the Goblin’s arms is strong.
They stay there for about two hours, until Tony decides he better gets Peter home before May is going to report him as kidnapped by his own father. They hug Peggy in a goodbye, Tony gives her a kiss on the cheek, and then they’re on their way back to New York.
Bruce rolls his eyes. “No, I don’t remember. I just remember… being so angry at one point, like somebody I cared about had died, which is weird since none of us got killed, right?”
He needs to go on patrol to clear his head some more. And after that, he should try and catch up with his dad, maybe even apologize. No, surely apologize. Peter passes a hand through his messy hair before turning around.
“So, this is what it’s like to have a big family,” Harry says all of the sudden, leaning against the wall with his arms crossed and a light smile on his face. Then he turns back to Peter. “Is this what you’ve always dreamt of?”
me, but it’s not like I’ll run in to him, right? Besides, if he’s so butthurt about it, he can just kiss my-“
“Shhhhhh-it!” Steve slurs out, rolling down on his back and staying like that for a moment. In those short seconds, Tony almost thinks of him as a turtle that has rolled and can’t get back. “Bucky you ch-cheated!”
“Don’t worry, I have a little Angel called ‘Helen Cho’ watching over me.” Then he scoots forward, taking out a pen and opening the book. “Now, let’s get this over with as quickly as possible, and hopefully we’ll get you out of here after the meeting next week.”
“Yes, dear,” Steve mutters in response, giving Wanda, Vision and Natasha a short wave. After that, they’re out of the common room. Natasha crosses her arms, glaring towards the three men on the other side of the table.
Yes there will be a timestamp where, finally, we will get other POV's, in which we can further explore Steve's thoughts on Peter being Spidey
“Peter? Hey!” His eyes hurt. So does his throat. Is he crying? He can’t even feel it anymore. “Please, just breathe.”
“I love Peter. If anything, I feel like he’s my son as well,” he assures Tony. “The only reason I’ve been taking care of Peter is because I want to, not out of some sense of duty.”
“They let us out for good behavior. Isn’t that great?” Clint, who is holding a few small presents in his hands, marches towards the tree as if he’s been living here for a few years as well. Sam stays standing at the door for a moment, making sure that Tony doesn’t get a stroke from the sudden excitement.
“You know that could take weeks,” Tony says, feeling something heavy inside of him all of the sudden. The idea of them leaving while he’s left behind here… it doesn’t sit too well with him. They could be in danger, and he’ll be here. All these inventions around him that could help them, but he can’t use them.
“You’re not alone, Mr. Stark,” Peter then says, trying to mute away the sound of the phone-call. He squeezes Mr. Stark’s hand, trying to smile at him but wondering if he’s actually managing it. There are tears rolling down his cheeks, too.
Tony can only stare at the super soldier; the last time he’s seen Steve dressed like this was back at the party right before the Ultron disaster happened. He’d been eyeing the soldier already back then, but never really thought anything of it because he was still with Pepper. Now, though, he can’t remember how he would not have kissed the guy on the spot.
Natasha makes them go completely on foot. Since it’s December right now, it’s cold, at the verge of snowing. Despite it not being
May looks at Tony, who is still holding the journal in his hands. Steve is still next to him, equally silent. Before Strange can continue, Tony gets on his feet and approaches the sorcerer-slash-neurosurgeon.
“This,” she panted with tears in her eyes, “is how my powers got released for the very first time.” Yaël wanted to look back at Raido, but X grabbed her chin and forced her to look away. So she looked at the king, who looked at bit shocked, but signed at Nilla, who quick and smoothly, even though she had just stabbed herself several times, crept up to memory-Yaël and knocked her down with the back of her blade. The castle stopped collapsing and started to immediately rebuild, as the king and a few of his servants were steering earth.
“YAËL, GET UP AND OPEN THA DOOOOOR!” she heard a familiar voice yell from the hallway, crawled out of her bed and stumbled towards the door. “Yaël, sweet muffinpoodle!” Wade said as she opened the door. He immediately hugged her, but he hadn’t grown back to his full height, so he planted his face between her breasts. Yaël somehow had the feeling he had planned that, as he didn’t retract for a few seconds.
The outfit fits. To keep it hidden, though, he’s given a pair of sweatpants and a loose hoodie. It’s something he would absolutely not wear in public, not to mention live TV, but he figures the ends justify the needs. When he gets shown where he needs to wait, Tony goes to stand there, putting his hands in his pockets. He’s quickly joined by Peter, who looks like he’s ready to just die on the spot.
The silence is deafening. Peter has to use all the power in his body not to fall forward again from that massive ache in his chest. He wishes he could call May, but she forgot her phone in New Asgard. He knows this, she said so on the Quinjet, when they were back on their way here.
“Steve, what did you mean when you picked up the phone? Have you been talking to Tony lately?” He has to ask, because it’s strange. Tony in his delirious stage, when he keeps on forgetting things… it’s possible that he’s been calling Steve without any knowledge that they’ve broken up. He can’t imagine how hard that must suck for Steve.
“Oh, good! I was just going to ask you when you-“ Yaël started pushing them towards the door. She didn’t know Korg that well yet, but she had learned he talked a bit too much during the most impossible moments.
“He thinks it’s too high a risk,” he explains. Peter nods, looking down at his hand fidgeting in the covers.
“I thought she was dead?” Yaël turned around and looked the two gossiping girls, who were looking at her from the opening of the door, right in the eyes. She cocked her eyebrow and crossed her arms. The two girls looked terrified and quickly ran away. There were a lot of students recognizing her and asking questions, but Yaël didn’t feel like telling her whole life-story to a bunch of kids. She quickly checked the washing machine again before going back upstairs.
Given that Peter’s often with his head in the clouds he sometimes forgets to grab a copy of the Daily Bugle along with him, which is rather stupid since he’s the official photographer for the paper, after all.
After a speech from Peggy’s oldest son, granddaughter and then her grand-niece, everybody seems to be moving outside again to watch the burial. Once again, Steve and Sam stay away from them, and Peter stays close to Tony as they watch his Aunty Peg being buried under the ground next to her late husband.
“Did he do something with it?” Tony asks carefully. Strange glares at him without stopping his steps.
While he loses Bruce almost instantly after they walk inside – the guy sees some people he hasn’t seen in a long while – both Steve and Peter stay by his side the entire time. With his hand still holding on to Steve’s, it’s not that hard to lose him. Peter, on the other hand, looks a bit like he’s out of his comfort zone. The people that are here are clearly businessmen. Tony recognizes most of them from past interactions during important parties. All dressed up in fancy suits or skirts, Tony’s glad they’ve decided to dress up for the occasion.
Peter looks back at the guy he’s come close to call Uncle Bruce. Giving him a sad look, he puts a hand on the guy’s shoulder.
Now, Yaël didn’t have a good feeling about Wade and Logan walking around in the same building. Luckily, she had a break and as she went to the kitchen, the place where all the teachers hung out during their break, she noticed Wade and Logan both went another way. With a relieved smile, she let herself fall down in one of the chairs. Scott walked in too, grabbing a coffee and before he could even ask while she was smiling, Wade suddenly sprinted in, wearing his Deadpool-costume. He tried to keep the door shut behind him.
Peter shakes his head, huffing out a disbelieving sound. “What, so I wouldn’t be too surprised when the guys arrive in New York and you’re suddenly not standing there?” he asks, realizing he’s snapping a bit at the guy.
“Oh, how I love to hear you say ‘shit’,” Tony mutters before he can think of it. “Uh, I mean, I don’t really think it’s any of your business, isn’t it?”
it,” Mr. Stark suddenly says, laughing a bit before walking back towards Peter and holding out his hand. “Now, get up. I want to see what you’ve done with it.”
“My son stays out of this,” Tony suddenly returns, feeling his hands ball into fists almost immediately.
“I, uh, I need to speak to my Aunt for a moment,” he says, uncertainly. The nurse looks back at May, and then nods.
“You’ve been behaving like this… I don’t know! You’re starting to get out of control, Peter! What happened?”
“Yeah, sure! I’m on my way!” Miles answers happily. He turns to look at MJ and Ned, the both of them already holding up their hands.
Steve frowns at him, but then sighs and nods, leaving the room again. Tony puts the arc reactor down and seems to look everywhere but at Peter. The teenager wants to ask how he’s doing, if he’s already doing better, but Peter knows it won’t be that easy.
“So you want to get to know your daddy, Peter?” Wade randomly asked while he started digging into his backpack and pulled out a bag filled with bread. Yaël raised her eyebrow. What the hell was Wade planning to do?
“I have to work tomorrow, but if you want a drink…” she said while pointing at the apartment building. It was meant to be red, but it could use fresh paint… or a fresh building.
“Dad!” he shouts, running up towards Iron Man and waiting for his father to jump out of the suit. When that happens, he shouldn’t be too surprised that he’s pulled into a strong hug. Tony puts a hand behind his head to hold him closer to him.
“Good.” Steve looks up when Tony finally arrives. What was taking him so long? Peter frowns a bit when he sees his father there. He’s ready to roll his eyes when he catches the worry on Tony’s face. What could possibly have happened that would make Tony doubt him this much?
More often than not he’s hit, but he doesn’t let it stop him. Somewhere during the whole exercise, he even started to have fun in it, finding Wanda and easily convincing her to team up on this to get them back.
she returns, ever so helpful. Everybody now looks at Tony, wanting to know what he’s going to do. Even May and Rhodey move away from the Kitchenette to find out what the drama is about.
Susan laughs and nods in understanding. Then she takes Reed’s hand, who is distracted with his phone, and pulls up his fingers to her lips.
“Dad! Stop it!” Peter almost shouts, pulling the phone away again. Tony is shivering as Peter clears his throat and swallows. “Sorry, Steve. Dad was panicking because you aren’t here. I just thought he should hear your voice for a moment.”
“Don’t worry, I think we’ve all learned our lesson,” Tony jokes back at him. He waves at the three making their way out, dropping on the couch the moment the door closes behind them. Then, there’s a relieved sigh coming out of his mouth.
the son they have. It’s never been official either, but it’s just… always kind of been like this. “But in my world, you two had help to get back together. My help.”
Steve listens again, not knowing where this anger keeps on coming from. He’s never reacted this strongly to anything. But, at the same time, the idea of anybody hurting Peter… it makes Steve feel like he’s ready for murder. That’s not really okay…
It’s obvious that there has been as much attention put into Jane’s hair. It has grown a bit in the few months that she’s been here. It’s been put into multiple little braids, decorated with small white pearls. A big part of the braids is put together in one bigger braid. Her loose hair is curled, hanging over her back.
“Peter?!” the girl calls out. And it’s in that surprise that Peter realizes who he’s talking to. Because he was constantly almost being attacked, he didn’t stop to think about it. Just those few seconds of respite, his mind clicks in, his chest aching at the realization.
“Ladies and gentlemen, if you may please be seated, we’ll begin shortly,” he says. Despite the accent, his English is really good, Peter notes. He’s never really heart T’Challa speak, not even in Germany. The idea that he’s fought alongside a King is really mind blowing.
fine! You look like that creep used you as his personal punching bag, which he probably did!” he tells him. Then he turns around and addresses the few people standing there. “Somebody get Dr. Cho here!”
“Well, this surely isn’t reality, Yaël,” he said while waving his hand to point out the darkness “Anyhow, how are you?”
“You gonna ruin every birthday present like this from now on?” he asks jokingly. Steve just grins playfully before leaning forward and kissing Tony gently on his lips. It’s soft and slow, especially pleasant when Steve’s fingers slowly caress his skin. Tony gasps for breath in the short few seconds that they aren’t kissing, but other than that they never let go of each other.
Hulk stormed towards them and grabbed Thor, still holding Yaël, and Brunnhilde right before he jumped extremely high. Yaël closed her eyes, succumbing from the pain at last.
Tony hasn’t left his side since he flew Peter all the way here to the compound. As he was on his way, Steve had called Helen and the others that they needed a room ready for him. That’s how they got to look after him almost immediately.
Steve noticed that Yaël had no answers, herself, so he asked her what she had been doing the whole year when she was gone and she told him everything. Yaël told him about the coma, about the tests, about the bullshit with Fury and her respect for X.
After that, Tony walks around the table to get to his seat next to Peter. There’s one more empty seat next to Tony, reserved for Bruce. Just when Peter is about to ask where he is, Bruce comes up from behind him.
“So what do we do?” the Valkyrie asked. Loki looked at his brother and stated he was not, never ever, going to do ‘Get help’. Yaël grinned. Even in war, these two brothers were acting like toddlers.
Then she shook her head, trying to make the thoughts disappear, and yawned as she pottered the poorly folded, wrinkly, ragged map out of her pocket. A seagull landed next to her feet.
“I wouldn’t know, I kept bumping up against everybody, and accidentally almost ran over a few kids so they moved me to a private room,” Yaël replied. Brunnhildeshared a room with her though, which was lucky because it was a huge assignment for Yaël to undress and get in her bed. So sometimes, without Yaël asking for it as she was a bit ashamed she needed help for something she was used to doing on her own perfectly, Hilde busted her fighting with her clothes or wheelchair and helped her out.
“Nobody knows, actually,” Steve sounded doubtful. “You haven’t seen each other since the Chitauri attack. Thor took him back to Asgard.”
There’s nothing much that she’s talking about. It’s mostly formulas and drawings, a text about how Mr. Stark accepted her request for research and offered to help her with it. There doesn’t seem anything weird about it; it’s mostly the equations of whatever formula she seems to have decided to use. Peter’s a bit confused as to why exactly it is that Mr. Stark is involved seeing as it was not really his area of expertise, but back then the guy still made weapons. Those must have been developed with the help of some scientists, right?
“Yeah, uh, that would be nice,” Tony says with a shivering voice. Dr. Wynedell is quiet for a few seconds before speaking again.
“You really are a blessing, Spider-Man,” the woman behind the kid says, taking Peter’s hands into her own and shaking them gratefully. Peter only bows his head towards her.
“Loki, cover me!” she said as she let herself fall down onto her hands. The closer to the water, the easier this
“No, no, you go do your thing. I’ll be here, or maybe we’ll go back to the compound? It’s about time we finish that suit, isn’t it?”
“I, uh, I do?” Peter calls out, uncertainly, thinking back of his friends currently stuck in the Compound.
Anyway, chapter warnings in the end notes. There's lots of medical stuff in here. Like I said, the nurse in me took over. I've done my research and pulled out my school notes of last year, so if there's anything wrong, blame my teachers and the internet ;-)
“Too bad, I think you two would make a great couple,” May then states with a light smile. Tony and Steve, too, nod with wide grins. Peter feels his face flush even more before he clears his throat.
“What the-?” Tony mutters out. This is just getting weirder and weirder, he realizes. He takes the journal from Steve and reads it over again and again.
Peter had told him with a grin, glad that even Tony seems to understand that they’re not ready for the ‘dad’-card.
The lights on the ceiling of the passage flashed in the windows of the cells as Yaël walked passed them. Again, Yaël scanned her card and waited for the light to turn green.
Johnny sneezes a few times. Peter doesn't point it out, but just hands him paper handkerchiefs to blow his nose. The news is on, but nothing much is happening.
“What?!” Yaël’s voices echoed through the iron hallway. “Who put me in the board in the first place?!” she asked, trying her best to be a bit more quiet. What dumb piece of salmon would do that? The last thing Yaël wanted to do is interfere with important stuff.
“I, eh, I kind of got stuck in one of those dreams I told you about.” So as she told him about the Conversion Disorder and everything that happened, she tried to make it sound like it was nothing.
“MJ, I’m the girlfriend,” she says quietly so the journalists wouldn’t hear, nodding towards Peter. Shuri’s face falls for just a short second before the biggest grin in the world appears on it. Then, MJ, too, is pulled into a strong hug. In the corner of his eyes, Peter can see the King slapping his forehead through his laughter.
That said, all the way in chapter 35 there's already things that will lead to Infinity War happening. Oh lord, where is this story going? I'm sorry beforehand, because the ideas Caspinn and I have are going to bring lots of feels.
When the two are at the kitchenette to start with the dishes, Peter sees Vision stare back at Bruce. He’s silently hovering in the air, probably not even noticing it, while he’s drying off one of the plates Peter’s just handed to him.
Once Tony returns with a cotton drenched in cleaning alcohol, he feels Peter’s eyes on him. He’s aware the teenager is looking at him with those big brown peepers, but he tries not to let it show. He doesn’t need Peter to start asking questions, because first Tony needs somebody to talk about the issue with.
“I won’t,” Peter promises, still trying to translate Nat’s message but unable to do so with all these balls flying around.
Then Tony’s on his back, on a soft mattress that could almost be more heavenly than his own at the tower.
Peter nods and goes to stand up. Harry does the same, following Peter to the door and exiting the room as well. When Peter and Tony turn right to head to the exit, Harry stands still.
“Why I don’t like him so- you know your mother used to work with him, right?” she asks, and Peter nods. He knows because he read all of her journals
“I love you, Peter. You do know that, right?” he asks. Peter puts his head on Tony’s shoulder and closes his eyes.
“Yo, girlie!” Wade came out of nowhere and draped his arm around her shoulders. Logan suddenly stopped as soon as he heard Wade’s voice, Yaël almost bumped into him.
It's a conscious decision to keep this story strictly Tony-Peter-centric. There are no other POV's, since the story is only about them two. If they don't know somebody's feeling about something, they won't know until it's specifically said to them. With that in mind, I have prepared timestamps where we can finally get inside of Steve's head for a few of the situations in here! :-)
“Yes, Dr. Cho is with him in medical. Doing some tests. I’m looking at the blood results right now, it’s really incredible how much a little piece of Steve’s liver can almost completely change a person,” Bruce says, still sounding surprised while looking at the papers.
“You people should not be meddling with affairs that are not yours,” the guy calls out, suddenly sounding angry. Peter looks, horrified, as he prepares another spell and promptly blows up the Quinjet with a hard explosion that literally seems to come out of nowhere.
