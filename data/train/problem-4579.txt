The acrid smell of smoke is startling, so he starts to heave himself rapidly out of bed, but it only takes a few seconds to register that it smells like burnt bacon and pancakes.
He keeps grumbling about it as he gets out of bed and slips on some pajama pants and a henley, but his chest feels warm and full from imagining Cas and Jack trying to surprise him with a birthday breakfast.
"Happy Birthday to me," he agrees against Cas' lips. They curve into a grin beneath his own, and he can't resist pressing forward for another soft, lingering kiss.
Jack-as-God has been as good as his word about not interfering cosmically with humanity’s existence, but Jack-the-kid had only stayed away from home for a few weeks, before showing up at their door with a sheepish smile and a human Castiel in tow.
Miracle hops onto the bed, jumping over Dean and settling into the space next to him, her nose a cold, wet pressure against his cheek that’s followed by her tongue licking at his face.
Back when they’d first brought Miracle to the bunker, and even despite how much Dean - surprisingly - adored her, he resisted the licking and made half-hearted attempts to train her out of it. Now, he just pats a hand on her side and mumbles, “Least someone’s giving me kisses this morning.”
Cas and Jack snap their heads around to look at him, wearing identical wide-eyed looks of guilt. There’s flour streaked across Cas’ cheeks and up into his hair, neon green oven mitts clutched in his hands, and Jack looks like he’s wearing half of the pancake batter on his shirt. The stainless steel table in the center of the kitchen is strewn with dirty bowls, eggshells, and open bags of flour and sugar. There’s a smoking pan next to all of it that has the charred remains of what once may have been bacon still smoldering away in burnt fat.
Dean gets to fall asleep and wake up next to the love of his life every day, his brother is still alive and thriving, Eileen by his side to kick his ass into shape so Dean doesn't have to, and Dean gets to see Jack more days than not, and even Claire makes it a point to come by at least once a month for dinner and to kick Dean’s ass at mini-golf. Life, even when it involves Cas and Jack making one hell of a mess in the kitchen, is pretty damn good.
The kitchen is a disaster, breakfast is beyond saving, the noxious smell of burnt food heavy in the air, and the obnoxiously cheerful 'Happy Birthday!' banner taped to the wall is starting to slip, but Dean already feels like this might be the best damn birthday he's ever had.
A high pitched beeping starts, originating from the smoke alarm in the kitchen, and it’s followed by the loud ‘clang’ or some kind of pot or pan, making Miracle’s head pop up and ears perk forward. Dean sighs. “Let’s go see what those two are doing to my kitchen, huh?”
It’d been easier to pretend that it didn’t bother him when he constantly had Sam to look after, or an apocalypse du jour to worry about, but now that God is no longer a spiteful megalomaniac and is, in fact, his son - well, the world doesn’t seem to be on the verge of ending quite so often.
"Oh, I'm surprised," Dean says, beaming. He crosses into the kitchen and throws an arm around Jack's shoulders, drawing him in and planting a hard kiss into his hair. There's pancake batter in there, too. "And hey, it's the thought that counts, huh?"
Birthdays growing up were little more than just another day; sometimes his dad got him a ‘present,’ usually in the form of some kind of weapon that a kid had no business wielding, but sometimes John would gloss over it completely, even when Sam would go out of his way to remind their dad what day it was and get angry on Dean’s behalf at the non-response. Getting older, he’d perpetuated this routine, waving a dismissive hand on the day of, and doing little more to celebrate than buying himself an extra slice of pie at whatever diner they found themselves.
“I told her we are a couple and that we just moved in together, to make her stop hitting on me, sorry,” Dean whispered in his ear as they walked away, sneaking an arm around Castiel’s back for appearances, sending chills down Castiel’s spine. He cleared his throat before answering.
“Oh,” he breathes and presses a kiss of his own to Dean’s lips, the beer making itself known. He had always been a lightweight.
“Yeah, that must be it,” Castiel answered absentmindedly, wondering what he had done to scare Dean away without even talking to him this time.
He’s also learnt that he hates it when Dean says ‘good night Cas’. He hates it when Dean leaves for his own room.
They fall asleep close together a while later, after even more kissing, sharing one pillow and facing each other. The last thing that Castiel thinks of before letting sleep take over is ‘thank God for stupid brothers with stupid birthday gifts’.
Three hours later he’s sitting in one of the stranger lecture halls for today’s lecture on Shakespeare. The course is elective, and since Castiel is Castiel he couldn’t help himself. A whole course with only Shakespeare.
“Oh, I’m sorry,” Castiel begins, “I wasn’t aware that I’m supposed to bring something.” He tries to convey that he isn’t familiar with the term ‘party trick’, but the man just laughs. On his nametag is written DEAN in large letters. Dean takes a sip from his beer and looks at Castiel. Castiel glances back and it isn’t until now he notices that this ‘Dean’ is good looking. Ridiculously good looking come to think of it. He wears an ugly green sweater with a reindeer on, and across it was written ‘Oh Deer’ in bright red. Castiel actually laughs.
“There he is, the man in question!” Castiel heard Dean say, feeling a hand pulling his arm, dragging him along to the girl in the yellow shirt. He smiled slightly at her, before looking nervously at Dean.
“What’s the deal with these friggin pencils? They’re like, super tiny. Imagine Sam writing with one, he’s like, huge,” Dean mused five shelves later. He looked at Castiel who was frowning again. “Oh right, you two haven’t met, but I swear, when you see him, he’s a giant. I call him Gigantor, or Sasquatch,” he continued.
When Dean opens his eyes a while later, hips still rolling, although a bit quicker than earlier, they’re hooded with lust, and a blush is spreading on the freckled cheeks Castiel has come to adore. Dean eases up closer towards Castiel’s stomach, letting his hips roll down two inches away from Castiel’s groin. Too far away. Not near enough. Castiel growls and grabs onto Dean’s hips, trying to urge him closer.
“Nu-uh, it’s called striptease for a reason, babe,” Dean says and remains seated where he was. He rolls his hips again and begins to slowly remove his T-shirt, revealing more and more skin. Castiel almost moans, but stops himself. This is too perfect to be true. He presses his fingers harder into Dean’s hips, starting to grind up against the stripper on top of him. God, he never knew it could feel this good.
Castiel turned around and saw Dean crawl out from under the mechanic bull, a wrench in one hand and a rag in the other.
“Cas? You know that you can tell me everything, right?” Dean finally says when Castiel refuses to try again, pointedly looking at their hands resting on Dean’s stomach. Dean shrugs his shoulder to get Castiel to look up at him, and not being able to refuse him, Castiel gives in. Worried green eyes meet his and he swallows. Dean really means it. He can tell him everything.
“Well, I have some sad news folks,” Dean said suddenly, and the audience quieted down. “The bull’s broken, so no ridin’ tonight. Must’ve ridden it real wild last weekend!”
The Roadhouse erupted with cheers and Castiel caught Balthazar smirking at him and nodding in his direction. Castiel frowned, and almost choked on his beer when the wall behind him disappeared. It hadn’t been a wall, but a thick black curtain, blocking the bar from the slightly elevated stage, now flooded with lights. Castiel no longer sat at the back of the room, but right in front of the bar. He shot a dirty look back at Balthazar and Gabriel who just shrugged innocently.
No, wait, the last thing he’s learnt is that he loves when Dean whispers a second good night and then presses a last kiss to his lips, before running back to his room, only to send him a text two minutes later.
The first time they kissed was a couple of weeks ago. It wasn’t that special. It was fantastic, but it wasn’t all this built up tension, electric sparks, heavy breathing and desperate moaning people talk about. It was just a quick, gentle press of lips against lips as Dean said goodbye outside of the coffee shop where they first met.
“Erhm,” came a voice from behind them and they broke the kiss, still holding onto each other. They turned to look at the source and met the stern look of an older lady, standing with her small grandchild, who looked at them with wide eyes. Castiel blushed and mumbled an excuse, while Dean only giggled.
“You know, the ones with the man of your dreams on them? The ones you can’t stop staring at when you leave the house for once?” Balthazar laughed and winked at Castiel’s growing blush.
“I don’t think I have one,” Castiel says, frowning. Is this actually something that people spend time thinking about, or practicing, to be able to show off at company dinners or friend’s parties?
“How you all doin’ tonight?” Dean almost whispered into the microphone, and someone in the audience shouted,
“Yes, of course, make out is- oh, perfectly fine,” he breathes and Dean laughs against his neck, running his hands down along Castiel’s sides and up again. Dean’s lips find his again and Castiel opens up eagerly, licking into Dean’s mouth with a fierce determination. He wraps his legs around Dean’s and pushes him even closer, if possible.
“We’re closed, you can come back lat-“, a voice called from the stage, before suddenly stopping. “Hey, wait!”
“Dean, are we- I mean, I want- I think-,” he tries, but shuts up when Dean pauses the movie with the people doing things and turns to look him in the eyes. All the attention, all the time. Dean
Castiel really didn’t want to join his friends for a night out, he was in the middle of his thesis and probably already a week behind on his work. He was more stressed than he had ever been, including the time when Balthazar had tricked him into going to a strip club. Yet another reason not to join his friends tonight, who knew where they might end up?
He fiddled with the label on his beer bottle, tearing away piece by small piece, his mind wandering back to his thesis. He really loved what he was studying, but he was still waiting for inspiration to strike. He had re-read the same articles, googled on the same subjects and stared at the same blank screen for weeks now and he just grew more and more frustrated. He knew he wanted to write about children and their access to libraries, but he just couldn’t find the right angle.
The spotlight followed Dean across the stage to the mechanical bull in the center. He gracefully mounted the bull and raised one hand to tip his hat at the audience before holding it above his head, his fingers slowly counting down to one.
Castiel knew it was rude to stare, but he couldn’t help himself. It seemed he never could when it came to Dean. Today Dean had a tight grey T-shirt that showed his biceps and ripped jeans, a small sliver of skin showing when Dean reached up to his rub his neck. Castiel became acutely aware that he was still in his sweaty clothes from cycling and that he still wore his bike helmet, his dark hair sticking up through it.
“I’m far from perfect,” Dean answered, something telling Castiel that Dean had told himself this more than once. “But does that mean-? You waited for me?”
“Or he got real lucky,” Gabriel smirked and wiggled his eyebrows, “did you smuggle Dean into your room last night?”
“If you’re sure,” Castiel said, fiddling with the sleeves of his trench coat. It had been less than a week since they first met, the day that Castiel had moved in. It had been less than a week, but Dean had already helped him unpack almost all of his stuff, and cooked him dinner three nights. That had all been nice, it felt comfortable and conversation flowed easily. But this? Going to IKEA, that is something couples do, families with children, newly-weds moving into their picket fence house. Not neighbors that barely even know each other. Castiel had agreed to Dean driving him, it was only logical after all. But walking around and choosing furniture and decorations for his new home? That felt so
Castiel had never been this flustered, and probably this turned on, his entire life. He took a big sip of his beer with closed eyes, trying to calm himself and willing his blush to die down. He turned back around to glare at his friends again but came face to face with Dean instead. The recently faded blush returned with full force.
“You might say that, you should see my collection at home, I’ve got everything from Bergman and Fellini to Mel Gibson and Leslie Nielsen,” Dean from sales says, looking proud. Castiel thinks for a minute.
“Dean?” he finally asks, closing his eyes instead of looking up at Dean. He feels Dean’s whole chest vibrate as he hums in affirmation. Castiel takes a deep breath and intertwines their fingers before finally turning towards the stripper-mechanic-nerd-boyfriend? sitting next to him.
“’m fine,” he mutters and allows the man to help him up. He reaches down to pull up his boxers, and the guy averts his eyes again, looking intently into the shower cubicle. Yet another point for straight. Or he’s just polite.
“Oh no, I won’t have that on my conscience, I drive my new neighbor to IKEA and loose him in there, oh no. I’m coming with you,” Dean replied, half -jokingly, half-serious.
“My name is Castiel,” he mumbles and shakes Dean’s hand as he tries to cover his notebook with his other arm, but only succeeding in shoving it down on the floor between them. At least it lands face down; the last thing he needs is Dean seeing that he’s sitting in class, drawing his face.
”Alright, so here’s the plan,” Dean said as he pulled into the enormous parking lot, eyes searching for an empty spot, almost impossible on a Sunday. “We go in, get what you already have decided for, three BILLY shelves or whatever, and then straight to check-out. IKEA is a labyrinth of crazy, and if you’re not careful you’ll be stuck with meatballs and kids forever. No ‘I’m just going to look around’ or ‘I’ll just grab one of these as well, one can never have too many candles or napkins or toilet brushes or whatever else cheap shit they have in there’, you with me, Cas?”
Castiel once again fell asleep watching Dean’s hat on top of his wardrobe, wondering why he didn’t just leave it at the bar and tried to forget that this had even happened.
He stumbled into the shower and let the embarrassment of the previous night wash off him and willed himself to follow through with his plan. He couldn’t afford to be this distracted right now anyway, he had a thesis to write and a degree to complete.
“Folks, may I ask you to remain in your seats and boots and welcome our very own Dean Winchester up on the stage!!”
“Well, I’m pretty good at German. So I can say a lot of things in German, for example Zwischenkieferknochen, which is a bone is the face, supposedly first discovered by Goethe, the man who wrote Werther’s Suffering, one of the great romantic novels, which caused a suicidal wave through Europe after its release, since the protagonist, Werther, kills himself in the end,” Castiel says, Dean’s eyes gone wide. “Who’s the nerd now?” Castiel adds quietly, eliciting a laugh from Dean.
“Why? Why couldn’t you let me leave?” Castiel asks breathlessly, already knowing the answer, or at least hoping that he does. Dean moves one of his hands from where it’d been holding onto Castiel’s shoulder to gently cup his face, thumb stroking along a cheekbone.
Three hours later Castiel has learnt that Dean moved into his dorm the day before (since his last roommate had very loud sex apparently), that he played Ferdinand in a summer production of the Tempest last summer (the reason he knew all the lines so well) and that he takes his coffee black, no sugar.
The guy apparently takes Castiel’s groaning as a sign that he is not, in fact, okay, so he crouches down and rests one hand on Castiel’s shoulder. Oh perfect. He has nice hands. And when Castiel opens his eyes to meet the stranger’s, he gasps. His face is even better up close. His
There's an awkward pause where Cas continues to glare and Dean’s mouth hangs open. Cas is giving him that look like he's about to kill him or pin him to a wall, Dean isn't sure, but it's carting his mind off somewhere he doesn't want to go. Cas indulges in human pleasures, plural? What other kinds of—
His eyes slide past Cas to the Lincoln, which gleams in the parking lot lights that are just beginning to turn on. “So, still riding in the old pimpmobile, huh?”
Dean holds his hand out and a stocky but very tired man in a brown uniform takes it, squeezing only gently before moving on to Sam’s. “Agents,” he addresses them gruffly, and jerks his thumb back to his office. Sam and Dean follow him through the quiet Belleville police station, entering a door that has
A whisper of noise filters out from somewhere down the hall as Cas walks past, but Cas doesn’t pay it much attention. He knows Dean will sometimes put a movie on as background noise while he drifts to sleep, and Cas figures he’s done so tonight.
Cas understands something very clearly in that moment: Dean has not said what he means. But he’s going to pretend that’s what he means until the day he dies, unless Cas does something about it.
Dean scowls at the road, one hand gripping the steering wheel a little too tightly. His mind goes straight to the livid scar on his forearm that's currently hidden, dormant under layers of flannel and canvas. He's been trying not to think about it, for just this once. "We're already almost there, Sammy,” he says, his tone coming out lighter than he feels. “A little late for playing hooky, dontcha think?"
For the next half hour, they fill Cas in on the details of their vamp hunt, and Dean slowly mows through his pie, knowing he's stuffing himself a bit too full and wishing he had more stomach. He can feel himself coming back down, so he elbows Sam, who's sitting on the ground between him and Cas.
Dean looks up in disbelief. It takes him a second to understand that he's not hallucinating and the gravelly voice that's just ordered does, in fact, belong to Cas.
He takes a breath to say something, but he can’t remember how to speak any earth languages all of the sudden, and he doesn’t think he has the air to, anyway. So he doesn’t.
Notably, the state of the drawing room doesn't seem to match the meticulous, upper-class vibe of the house. To an outsider, it seems like someone’s been camping out in here for several days, though Sam knows Missy's brother only died yesterday morning. There's a box of tissues on the coffee table in front of him, and a wastebasket full of used ones off to the side. A bottle of antacid tablets has tipped over next to the tissues, and the rest of the table is littered with crumpled napkins and two precarious stacks of dirty plates, one in particular that looks like it could topple at any second.
Dean walks slowly forward until he’s standing right in front of Castiel as he reads, face open and honest.
The audience booed at first, but it turned quickly into wolf-whistling and whooping at Dean’s last comment.
“Yes, you left,” he finally replied, “after your performance. I assumed you didn’t want to see me, so I thought I’d spare us both the awkwardness and just swing by today instead.” He gave Dean a small smile, “I guess that didn’t really work out…”
“Thank you for- I mean- I need to go, I-” Castiel mumbles and gathers the rest of his clothes in a bundle, probably crushing his glasses in his hurry, but he can’t really care. He just needs to get away, get back to his room and sink through the floor there instead.
But before he can even begin to think about things like that there are things they need to talk about. Like the fact that Castiel hasn’t had sex in five years. Like the fact that he’s scared of what Dean will think of him. Like the fact that he is falling head over heels for Dean, caring, loveable, sweet, gorgeous Dean, and was two seconds away from saying ‘I love you’ when they last met. This is insane, they’ve only been dating just under three months. Things shouldn’t move this quick. Not for Castiel at least. But, on the other hand, it’s not exactly like they’re on the Romeo and Juliet speed level.
The next time Castiel fell asleep watching Dean’s hat, it was perched on top of Dean’s dresser, watching over him as he drifted to sleep, safe in Dean’s arms. It had also witnessed their first kiss from its place on top of the bar, and all the kisses that followed.
“Shit, I’m sorry,” Dean exclaimed, “I told Ash to tell you why I left, but I guess he didn’t.” Dean looked truly sorry and for a moment Castiel almost let himself believe that it had all been a misunderstanding, and that Dean actually was interested.
“Well Cas,” Dean smiled, suddenly his confident self again, “In that case, do you want to join me in feeding some calves?”
“I don’t understand that reference. How are whales a failure? They’re brilliant, prehistoric creatures that are quite graceful.” Castiel’s brow furrows in confusion.
“No, dude, of course not! I trust you completely,” Dean replies. Sam raises his eyebrows at his brother.
“Sam invited me, so, yes. Why? Is that a problem?” Cas breaks out the crazy-intense gaze, his baby blues locking onto Dean’s green eyes with the accuracy and force of a homing beacon.
“Nice,” Dean says aloud, settling back onto the pillows to enjoy some low-quality but nostalgia-inducing content. Not even two minutes later, he hears the locks click on the hotel room door and Dean flails for the remote, panicking that he’ll be caught.
Once they’re safely in the office with the door shut and out of earshot of any passersby, Cas turns to face Dean with his arms crossed over his chest.
Castiel blushes in a way that Dean thinks is absolutely fucking adorable and takes a drink of his beer.
Benny sighs. “He just said some stupid shit, and I said some stupid shit right back,” he says vaguely.
“The fuck did you just say?” Dean spins to face Rocker but finds any further progress impeded by Jesús grabbing his left arm firmly.
He walks over to Dean and puts his hands on his shoulders. “First of all, I accept your apology. But I want us to work on not bottling things up until they cause you to lash out in anger, because it was
He’s not sure what he was expecting a “fixer” to look like, but Dean is confident that, prior to meeting her, he never would’ve described Charlie.
“What the hell, man? I thought I finally got you back for scaring the shit out of me all those times.”
“How are you feeling?” Cas asks, arranging himself so he’s laying along Dean’s side since he’s still star-fished across the mattress.
The next pitch is fouled straight into the dugout, smacking against the backrest right where Dean had been sitting.
Charlie takes off her headphones when she sees Cas and Dean re enter the kitchen. “What’s the verdict, kiddos?”
Sam’s contract had kept him with the Royals until this past off-season, when Bela had brokered a blockbuster deal to send him to the Angels. The two Winchesters were playing for the same team for the first time in a decade.
Dean takes a deep breath. He knew this was coming—that there would be some question about his sexuality and/or his relationship with Cas—but he hadn’t really prepared any specific response beyond his usual, “I have no comment about my personal life.” But as he’s standing there, having been selected by a record number of votes to his fourth-consecutive All Star Game and openly accompanied by the man he loves, he decides to respond with a bit more openness than he generally grants the media.
Dean laughs loudly and grabs him around the middle, pulling Cas flush against him and leaning in to press kisses to Cas’ stubble-covered neck.
“Sexuality is a spectrum!” Charlie sweeps her arms around her. “Some people like boobs. Some people don’t. Some people like everything, and some people like nothing.”
“I know.” Cas presses a kiss to Dean’s temple. “I’m going to talk to Dr. Moseley about your test results some more, and you should rest. Hopefully we can go back to the hotel soon.”
“That’s exactly what I mean! You have no idea if you even really want this… whether or not this is just a phase for you.”
Dean crosses his arms over his chest and huffs out a breath. “I’m fine, Sam. I just wish you’d checked with me
“That kid just pitched a no-hitter, yet he can’t remember to close the front door to a house that’s not even
Dean blushes and rubs at the back of his neck, but holds her gaze. “Thanks, Charlie. That means a lot.”
Dean tightens his hold on the strap of his duffel bag, takes a deep breath, and walks into the clubhouse Friday morning. A thunderclap accompanies his entrance, creating an even more dramatic feel to the already tense situation, and Dean sighs.
started? Nah, I’m good.” His knee was not, in fact, good. Neither were his hips or his right rotator cuff. At just twenty-eight years old, his body felt about ninety. Aches and pains were normal for players his age, particularly for catchers, but his limbs currently felt like they were breaking down piece by piece. There’s no way in hell, though, that he would ever admit anything like that to these vultures. “Isn’t this supposed to be about Samsquatch? His hair alone should warrant at least two thousand words.”
“Thanks, man. See you tomorrow.” Dean refills his glass from the tap before heading into his bedroom. He’s feeling jittery and a bit amped up, visions of Cas’ chiseled jaw dancing in his head like some warped version of
. Listen: I’m sending over a specialist to your house. She’s going to fix this whole fucking fiasco. Now, I need you to uncurl from the fetal position and get your shit together, Winchester. We can play this however you want, but I promise you, this will be fine.”
Cas doesn’t respond right away, instead doing the little head-tilt move that usually means he’s considering something. “When I first asked you about bottoming, you seemed ambivalent. What’s changed?”
“Yeah, ‘course,” Dean replies. “Pretty sure it’s in my contract that these two have input into my care, anyway.”
Dean rolls his eyes and crosses his arms over his chest. “Repercussions, for you? What’s gonna happen?
, Dean. And before you accuse me of favoritism ‘cause I raised your scrawny ass, I’d say the same to any of my players. You know how serious concussions can be, and we ain’t messin’ around with this. You hear me?”
“Dean!” a reporter Dean recognizes from the Los Angeles Times calls out frantically when he sees him approach. “Did the news regarding your sexuality have an impact on your brother’s performance tonight?”
Cas moves towards Dean, resting his hands on his shoulders when he gets close enough. “Yes, I believe the story goes that Alexander wept when he realized that he’d defeated all known enemies.” He uses his index finger to pull Dean’s chin down so that Dean is treated to Cas’ Soul Penetrating Squinty-Gaze™.
By Labor Day, the Angels have a four-game cushion over the second-place Astros in the AL West and Dean is starting to let himself think seriously about the postseason.
“Besides,” Dean continues, “the only person that’ll see us coming and going in one car is Stacy, the security guard at the gate.”
Even as he thinks this, his mind supplies him with a barrage of images of exactly what it would be like to date Cas.
and belts out song after song, the gridlock melting away as he merges onto the 91 towards Anaheim. The music helps him mellow out a bit, and Dean does his best to keep his focus on the present moment and try not to spiral too much.
“Oof!” Dean says, hefting Jack up onto his hip. “You’re getting too big! Two years old and you practically weigh a ton. I can barely lift you!” He pretends to drop him.
“I know that. But I— I want to be. And that scares me, not only because of my aforementioned track record, but also because it’s a huge violation of ethical standards. And mostly because I really like you. I love spending time with you. I look forward to seeing you every day and that terrifies me.”
Dean scoffs. “Dude, again with the goddamn pity party! I’m not trying to make you feel guilty about how we grew up! I have no regrets about that shit. You hear me? None. I’m just trying to remind you that I wouldn’t ask you to stop seeing someone without having a reason.”
But then he swipes through the next few, and smiles. “Wow, we’re a pretty good-looking couple, huh?”
He shivers a bit, torn between accepting that he has to listen to Cas and being turned on at the steel in his voice while he’s giving Dean orders. OK, so maybe he
Eventually Dean retreats to the bathroom. He looks at himself carefully in the mirror, taking in his flushed cheeks and small, red love bite at the base of his neck with a grin.
He looks over to Sam’s cubby where his brother’s back is turned to him. He can see the name “Winchester” emblazoned over the number 12 in bright red on his back, and he smiles. As if sensing eyes on him, Sam turns and quirks an eyebrow up at Dean.
“Hey,” Sam puts the medicine ball back in its crate and runs both of his hands through his hair. He doesn’t say anything, instead he stares at the floor intently like he’s waiting for it to open up and swallow him.
Dean grabs Cas’ hands and holds them to his chest. “No! I’m super-sorry about your cat, Cas. But I thought Richard was a person. I thought you were telling me that your ex of
, Sam. Your head is so far up your own ass right now, I doubt you even know what inning it is. You haven’t been thinking about the next pitch at all! You’ve just been blindly accepting whatever sign I flash, which you’ve never
Sam makes a frustrated noise. “It’s not about the milk, Dean. When were you going to tell me that you’re dating Castiel?”
“And with that, gentlemen, I bid you adieu.” Gabriel bows to Cas and turns to Dean. “I’d think it goes without saying, but you jock-types are pretty thick-headed. So, you do you anything to cause my baby bro here any pain, and I will make that time you got beaned in the nads last season look like a fucking walk in the park. Capice?”
Dean’s in such a good mood that he even acquiesces to an interview with Joe Buck, one of the TV announcers (and one of Dean’s least favorite on-air personalities). Clearly the intern sent to ask him if he’d mic up and answer a few questions is expecting a negative response, because the kid looks shocked and has to run back to the dugout to grab the equipment.
“Now’s the time in the conversation when you give me a hug and don’t say ‘I love you, Ellen,’ but I know you do, anyway.”
It didn’t hurt that Sam’s own growth spurt had him clocking in at over six feet when he was a freshman, joining the high school team for Dean’s senior year. That season the Winchester brothers earned nationwide attention for their talent: Sam for his stoic, commanding presence on the mound and Dean for his ability both behind and at the plate. According to the press, theirs was a feel-good story, perfect for sandwiching in between the macabre reports of war, crime, and politics. In the evening news, they were just two handsome American brothers turning to baseball to overcome their broken home. Dean would tell anyone who asked that he and Sammy had grown up just fine, thanks, nothing broken about them (his interviews were usually cut out of the final broadcasts).
remembers Jo dating Kate. Looking back on that summer, Dean remembers being a complete asshole to Jo. Now he thinks he finally understands why: he was fucking
Cas is sitting in his bed, shirtless and propped up against his pillows just as Dean is, but he’s wearing his reading glasses and he’s bathed in just the soft light of his bedside lamp. He looks incredibly sexy in a way that Dean knows is unintentional, which just adds to the wave of want that crashes over him.
Dean leans into Cas’ touch. “This fucking sucks,” he mutters, the fight draining out of him. He knows that concussions are serious business and he has no desire to become a statistic, but it’s the
“Hardly, although my mother will be the first to tell you about our connections to the Carnegies and Astors.”
Dean had felt momentary guilt a few weeks ago when he’d realized that his best friend was no longer his brother, but his boyfriend.
, actually. And even if you lose some endorsement deals, you’ll get others. Plenty of brands are happy to have queer spokespeople.”
A good 45 minutes later, Dean emerges from the bathroom with a towel wrapped around his waist, feeling the same combination of nervousness and excitement that’s been buzzing within him all day. All of the prep had been a lot easier than he’d built up in his head, and while it’s not something he’d want to do every day, it’s not the worst thing he’s done for sex.
Dean stares at the bedspread and takes a drink of water, trying to calm down more. His thoughts are so tangled up in his head that he can’t focus on any single thing except
“Again, you stubborn ass, you should maybe think about whether or not you want to be with him. I’m 99% sure Cas is interested in you, considering I legitimately thought you two were already dating. He looks at you like you hold the key to the universe.”
Cas doesn’t answer but bends down and reaches under the sink, standing up again holding the top to Dean’s electric razor.
He turns the water off and wraps a towel around his waist. Wiping some of the condensation away from the mirror, he gives his reflection a hard glare. “Nut the fuck up, Winchester. Your life is fine the way it is. Better than fine! You’re a goddamn professional baseball player, and you’re acting like a little bitch. Now go eat some red meat.”
Dean thinks for a moment. He can’t imagine a situation where he’d tell Sam to ignore his feelings or not go for the thing that would make him happy.
“Fine. We can talk to Bobby, if it’ll make you feel better. And if we decide to keep doing this,” he waves a hand between the two of them, “then we’ll talk to Jo and Gabriel”—Cas grimaces—“and whoever else we need to, to make sure we’re being as, uh, ethical, as possible.”
“No, man, that’s not what I meant! It’s great that you did that.” He rubs the back of his neck, uncomfortable and unsure how to proceed, now that he’s inserted his foot firmly in his mouth.
Dean, however, has been making dumb mistakes all day, completely distracted by their appointment. Telling Bobby that he and Cas intend to date means that not only will he be outing himself (by himself, thanks Sam) for the first time to someone in his family, but it’s also making this Thing with Cas very real. And real equals friggin’ terrifying. What if Cas decides Dean isn’t worth it after one date? Then he’ll have had this serious talk with Bobby for nothing.
The deep tone of Cas’ gravelly voice causes Dean’s dick to throb and he’s in such a hurry to get a condom that he knocks most of the items, including an open bottle of lube, off the nightstand onto the ground.
He quickly shampoos his hair, willing the fantasies away. And that’s the main problem, isn’t it? This is all a
“Tell you what, boys,” he’d said before shuttling them over to Ellen’s, “I’ll make sure you get signed up for little league this summer, ok? You two got some natural talent, and it ain’t fair to deny you the joy of this game just ‘cause you got a daddy who can’t keep his damn head on straight. Besides, I’m sure Ellen will want to sign Jo up, too. That girl’s got too much energy for her own good. Running around the bases oughta tire all three of you chickens out.”
“And then today he spent all afternoon after training scrubbing the place down like we were welcoming the Queen of England.”
, I would be violating the ethics of my field. That’s not something I take lightly. Added to this is the fact that perhaps you’re just experimenting with being involved with a man.”
“No, you’re trying to get me to forgive you by doing whatever I tell you to do, ‘cause you think that’ll make me happy.”
“Dude. It’s completely different! Can you imagine the fallout if I had a public relationship with a dude?! My career would be
Stupid Sam and Benny wanting him to happy. Encouraging him to go for something he knew wouldn’t pan out for him.
I’ve been, terrified to really examine my feelings about wanting to fuck men because it’s not OK for a professional male athlete to be gay. Thanks for clearing that up for me!”
“How’re you doing? Want a third?” Dean asks and then pulls Cas’ earlobe into his mouth, letting his teeth scrape just a bit.
The home plate umpire jumps forward and puts himself between Dean and Rocker. He points a meaty finger at Ash over Rocker’s shoulder. “That’s a warning, ace! Cut this out, boys, or I’ll throw all your asses outta the game!” he calls.
, on the way back to the hotel) had explained that the best treatment was simply rest. He needed to let his body heal and that meant no workouts, minimal exertion, and definitely no playing baseball. Dean could cause himself serious, lasting damage if he gets concussed again.
All Star Game: every year in July the MLB puts on a game between the American League and the National League featuring players from each team that've been voted in by the fans. Whichever side wins gets home field advantage (i.e. the first games of World Series will be played at the home field of the winning league's team). It's essentially just a big scrimmage between the top stars of from around both leagues, and it's usually very fun and with minimal drama. It also gives the players an almost week-long break during the regular season (which consists of 162 games!).
“Oh, shit, are you OK?” Dean asks worriedly while trying to relax his body to adjust to the intrusion.
“I guess we can thank your immune system,” Cas responds. “Past experiences aside, I really do want this with you. Now, if you’re amenable.”
“Doc, what are the legal implications of this?” Bobby asks, folding his arms across his chest and regarding the two men with a furrowed brow.
one of them. The home crowd boos enthusiastically at every Angel player and is deafening in their support of the home team; Dean can clearly hear fans heckling and jeering at him when he’s behind the plate. Luckily, this season has given Dean ample opportunity to hone his skill at ignoring the stupid shit that’s shouted at him, and he lets the taunts roll off in favor of focusing on the field.
Rufus Turner, the intense, no-nonsense pitching coach that Bobby brought with him from Kansas City, was one of the few people who was able to get through Sam’s thick skull when he was on one of his holier-than-thou tirades.
April rushes by and suddenly it’s May. The Angels find themselves in third place in their division, and while they trail the first-place Rangers by only four games, it feels like more. The offense has been struggling and Sam is the only starting pitcher with an ERA under 3.50.
One thing about dating Cas (especially when he goes full-on Doctor-Mode Cas) is that he is fastidious as fuck when it comes to safe and healthy sex. Dean’s nightstand, once stocked with half a bottle of lube and maybe two condoms, is now home to several types of lube, latex (and latex-free, although neither of them have an allergy) gloves and condoms, and a variety of wipes. Regardless of clean bills of health, Cas insists on barriers for sanitary reasons.
The noise around the stadium sounds far away to Dean, like his head is underwater. His focus is on Smith, who steps up to the plate—crowding it, as expected—and taps his cleats with the barrell of the bat. Dean ignores the slight throb of his hips and sets up, giving Sam the signal for a four-seam fastball, just a little inside, in an attempt to get Smith to back the fuck up.
“Yes, that’s good. I want to watch you get yourself off while I fuck you through it.” Cas’ fingers are gripping his hips tightly, and Dean hopes he leaves marks. He wouldn’t be able to look away from the sight in the mirror of Cas pounding into him, even if the zombie apocalypse started outside the bedroom door.
“I’ll take a beer. Thanks.” He looks around the loft. “Great place you’ve got here. Do you and Dean own it?” Before Sam can answer, Dean decides he’s been feigning nonchalance long enough and joins them.
He knows he should shower, that he should eat. But he just stays on his bed, replaying the conversation over and over, trying not to hold onto the moment of hope that was sparked in his chest when Cas had said, “Do you want it to be?”
Cas looks up and smiles warmly, marking his page and setting the book on the nightstand. “Everything okay?”
Dean frowns, trying to remember if he’d shoved any in his travel bag, when he hears Cas’ triumphant “A-ha!” followed immediately by him falling onto Dean and accidentally elbowing him sharply in the side.
At one point in the second game, though, Benny and Rocker have an exchange that causes the Yankees first base coach to step between the two men. For a moment, Dean is worried that there’s going to be a bench-clearing fight, but both men back down and the game ends without incident.
Dean shrugs. “I’m fine. Long day.” He shuffles over to the refrigerator and pulls out a beer, not caring about the inevitable headache that’ll follow drinking on an empty stomach.
Arms laden with dishes, Sam makes his way inside, shooting Dean and Cas an odd look before closing the screen door to the porch.
But instead of being calmed by the gentle touch of his boyfriend, Dean took a seat several rows behind Cas, planted his headphones over his ears, and, glancing around to make sure no one could see his phone screen, turned on Enya.
Dean wonders briefly if he’s actively having a stroke, causing his brain to vomit up the worst case of accidental innuendo he’s ever suffered.
“I want to go back in time twenty minutes, to when I was sleeping peacefully and had no idea about any of this shit.”
Less than thirty seconds later he feels his phone begin to buzz and grabs it, his stomach doing a small flip when he realizes that Cas is FaceTiming him.
“You’re quite literally thousands of votes ahead of the second-place catcher. Fans have set records in the past week, all of them rushing to vote for you.”
Sam furrows his brow. “OK, well, clearly I fucked this up. I thought you were ready to come out to me or whatever. I’m so sorry, dude. I didn’t mean to like, freak you out.”
“Hang on,” Dean says and twists so that Cas is dropped onto his back on the sofa. Dean maneuvers them so they’re laying on their sides, pressed together on the narrow cushions. He caresses Cas’ jaw, letting his fingertips brush along the dark stubble that lines his face. “You’re fucking gorgeous,” he whispers before he leans in and kisses him again.
out of Rocker. Believe me. But again, it’s not like I can put on a fake moustache and fool Bobby into letting me get behind the plate. What else can I do except focus on helping the guys beat these assholes as best I can? And there’s the whole thing of not wanting to get CTE and lose my mind.”
“Besides,” Dean continues, “I’m meeting with the new team doc after the workout today. I’m sure he’ll preach at me about the healing properties of tofu.”
Well, thar she blows. A very short, insanely fluffy epilogue will be up soon! I hope you all enjoyed this main part of the story, and that maybe some of you will be inspired to watch a baseball game or two.
And he’s spent the past twelve hours still feeling the echo of Cas’ lips against his, imagining what it would be like to be able to kiss him whenever he wants to. Of what it would be like to have someone as supportive, thoughtful, and dependable as Cas at his side.

“Yeah man. I’d rather pitch both games of a doubleheader in July than sit through another day of meetings.”
“I’d call it ‘wastin’ time bein’ a couple’a idjits’.” Bobby walks into the clubhouse and gives Dean an annoyed look before he claps his hands loudly. “We can spend time braiding each other’s hair and gossiping later. Everyone out on the field in two minutes!”
“Looks like we’re back in that ‘Dean and Cas can’t speak without being awkward’ thing, huh? But uh, yeah, no. No Boy Scout over here. So, catcher’s honor? I swear I’ve been getting so much out of working with you man.”
Instead, he shrugs one shoulder. “I think it’s just discipline at the plate. I was chasing a lot of pitches, trying to golf ‘em out of the park. I’ve calmed down a bit,” he replies. “Plus, I’ve been eating my Wheaties every morning.” He winks at the camera.
“Again with the shutting up before I shut you up!” Dean scoots his chair back from the table and it scrapes loudly against the floor. He stands up and grabs his tray.
“Apparently she got calls from Nike, the Gap, and Absolut Vodka this morning. Nike wants me to participate in some Pride Month photoshoot thing, and the other two want to do some ads with both of us? I’m not sure. She was sorta vague. But, dude, brands actually
There’s one out and no one on base when Rocker steps into the batter’s box, so Dean makes his decision, knowing that Ash will follow his lead. He points his middle finger straight down and taps the inside of his left thigh with it. He keeps his eyes locked on Ash, who nods solemnly back at Dean in agreement.
give you some advice. Best-case scenario:  your shoulder holds out this season, your sprained ACL has healed enough in the past few months to let you play, and your hips won’t hurt any more in September than they do today. But how long will the band-aids last? Your rotator cuff is going to keep getting worse, until the tissue tears cause you so much pain you can’t keep playing without having surgery. Your already-weakened ACL might actually tear the next time you steal a base or hop up to throw someone out. And your hip pain could be anything from tendinitis to bursitis to simple inflexibility. If we don’t look at these issues now, you could be cutting your career short by years.”
Anger immediately washes over Dean and he clenches his jaw. “I’m not gay,” he responds tersely, “so you’ll have to be more specific about what you think I’m ‘kidding’ about.”
He looks around the patio but doesn’t see Cas, so Dean goes inside to try and track him down. Saying all that stuff to Sam felt really good, and he wants to catch Cas and tell him …. Well, maybe not tell him that he loves him, but let him know how important he is to Dean before he loses his nerve.
to give him some run support to get him the win for his performance—the kid’s got a friggin’ no-hitter going through eight innings, for Christ’s sake.
Dean scratches at his chest, thinking idly of minty ass (not that he’s ever eaten ass before, but the idea of it tasting like mint is making him giggle) and wondering if now’s the time to bring up the topic that’s been rattling around in his head for the past week or two. He hasn’t been sure how to broach it, and it’s always much easier to bring up awkward shit in text, right? He exhales audibly and goes for it.
Cas grins and shakes his head at Dean. “There’s this phrase, I can’t quite remember it, but I know it’s applicable in this situation. Something like...having told you this outcome was possible…?”
Dean doesn’t answer any of the questions and instead grabs his toiletry case and a towel before he stomps off towards the showers.
abide Cas thinking that he doesn’t want him or doesn’t desire him. “Dude, no! I totally want to bang.”
There’s nothing salacious about the video, but it clearly shows two men kissing and hugging—nothing platonic about it. Dean skims the rest of the article, which goes on to give a brief bio of both him and Cas, and then speculates about their fucking wedding plans. The final paragraph makes Dean break out into a cold sweat.
The Sheriff nods, takes a steeling breath, and opens the first file. On top of a thin stack of papers rests a photo of a smiling dark haired woman in her mid-thirties, reclining with her arms out on a park bench. Next to hers is a picture of a middle-aged man with graying hair and a set of severe, arched eyebrows, and the final image is of a much younger woman, thin and wiry, caught unawares at what looks to be a 50s diner-style table.
"I came outside to check on the horses. They were nervous. Restless, spooked. I couldn't figure out what did it to 'em. And then I heard him out in front of the house." She lowers her voice to a whisper. "He was screamin' when I saw him. Cryin' out for our mother. Yellin' about how much it hurt— and he wouldn't stop holdin' his stomach, like he was tryin' his best to keep somethin' in."
Dean flicks his flashlight up and it illuminates a thin figure, deathly pale and hunched over with its back facing them. Strangely, Dean thinks there’s a tiny plaid shirt clinging to its shoulders, far too small and ripped all to hell. The thing’s long, lanky arms scoop bits of gore from the ground and lift them to its mouth in a frenzied
"This is a milk run, Sammy," he says, more gently. "It's practically in our backyard. We'll be in and out in a couple days, tops."
The picture of patience, Sam reaches for the pipe, and Dean sets it in his hand reluctantly. "It's okay, just-- here. Like this."
Sam deliberates. "...You know, the high schoolers would be loving this right now. Jealous Dean. If they wanted—"
"Just inside here," the receptionist says, and she opens the door. “Agent Gaga?” she announces herself into the white-tiled room before them. Dean peers anxiously over her shoulder, tense, ready to reach behind his suit jacket and grab his pistol if he must.
, Dean thinks, remembering when he watched Cas down a line of five shots without blinking an eye at Bobby's.
"Shut up," Dean croaks. He clears his throat a few more times as Sam raises the vape to his own mouth, taking a long draught and exhaling-- nothing?
“Whatever you say.” Dean snuggles drowsily into Cas’ side again, then yawns. “I gotta get back to bed, buddy.”
So tall, in fact, that when Sam’s standing on her wraparound porch and she cracks the door open, he has the rare experience of actually having to look
When he's done unbuttoning his shirt and hanging it on a hook next to his coat, Cas steps into the freezing cold water and watches the goosebumps raise on his arms and legs. He's gathered that most humans think this is unpleasant; Sam has certainly complained enough about the hot water being taken when he heads into the showers after Dean. Personally, Cas likes the way it clears his head. The juxtaposition of warmth when he finally turns on the
The book isn't one Cas thinks many people have read, and it isn't one he wants the Winchesters to catch him reading, necessarily. That's why he keeps it in the kitchen, in a drawer he knows Dean doesn't use.
Getting the feeling that he’s going to have to take the lead, Cas takes one of Dean's hands and guides it to his shoulder, slides one of his own hands to rest on Dean's waist, feeling the texture of the delicate embroidery stitched into his waistcoat there. Cas' eyes are drawn to the way Dean's throat bobs nervously at the touch. He takes Dean’s other hand in his, raising it up like the other couples in the room, and then he begins to sway.
"Mm, both." Ullman reaches for the other folder, fiddling with the corner. "Far as we can tell, it's canine, or close to it. Not human, in nature."
He levels out two scoops— Dean has let him know that one scoop makes the coffee "weak" and is "for bitches" and since Dean tends to have a better compass for taste than Sam does, Cas trusts him on it. He fills the coffee pot all the way to the twelve cup line and starts the machine, planning to sip on this for the next several hours.
Sam turns away and stifles a snigger. He knew it at the time, but he wasn’t about to embarrass his brother. "It's fine, Dean. You don't have to do this just because it's four twenty." Sam finishes buttoning his clean shirt and sits lightly on the bed across from Dean's, keeping his posture open, inviting him to talk. "When was the other time?"
He has enough experience to know it's not a conscious prayer. Often, he feels Dean missing him from hundreds of miles away when he hasn't been on a hunt with them in a while. Sam probably misses him too, but Cas assumes that Sam isn't connected to him in quite the same way Dean is, so maybe his "angel radar" doesn't pick it up as readily. Sometimes he feels it when Dean is in the same room, when they're looking right at each other, even. It's times like these that Cas wonders if his grace was programmed correctly, because that can't possibly be right.
Dean's deep in the influence of his subconscious, and right now, that subconscious is providing him with a very poignant scene with a masquerade, dancers, and slow music. And what goes with that? The answer is simple. It's obvious in every couple that lilts by them, gripping each other tight and spinning in time to the song.
"Yeah." Sam presses a button on the bottom a few times, and a light flashes. "It's heating up. So." He gestures to Dean's hands. “Are you gonna let that smoke itself, or…"
Cas narrows his eyes. "I indulge in certain human pleasures from time to time, Dean," he says matter-of-factly, and that implication shuts Dean up completely.
Sighing, Cas bores into Dean’s eyes with his own. Dean tries to hold his gaze as long as possible, knowing it's a losing battle with an inhuman force and he’ll have to look away eventually. He always does.
Dean grins. "See? What did I say, Sammy? We'll be in and out like we were never even there. Milk run."
"Forgot to ask for a salad," Sam mutters from the seat next to him, regarding the fries on his plate with distaste. Still, he picks up the steak knife he's been provided with and gets to work.
Missy opens the door all the way and lets Sam through. As he steps over the threshold into a grand foyer with vaulted ceilings, he catches the heady smell of meat cooking from somewhere deeper in the house. She shows him through a doorway immediately to the left of the entry, a more modest drawing room decorated all in soothing tones of blue and white, and waits until he sits down on the couch before she excuses herself.
Dean chuckles at the memory. "Oh, yeah. Twice, then." He misses a beat. They both know that Sam lit the bong, Dean took one hit, and he said he was good for now, thanks. "...I didn't really inhale, that time, I just sort of--"
“Howard Grady. Found in his home three days ago,” Ullman explains. “We still aren’t entirely certain what killed him. Lydia, our coroner... she’s been a little overwhelmed. The blood found on his shirt, under his nails, and in his mouth…” He halts. He frowns. He scratches his head. “That’s been identified as Sandy Duvall’s.”
“I won’t,” Cas promises. He brushes his thumb over Dean’s hand, considering. “I’d like to watch it with you. If you want.”
He absently hikes up the shoulder of his robe. As he shifts closer so he's sitting next to Cas, it slips right back down his arm, but he doesn't fix it again. Instead, he dangles his legs over the side of the bed, inspecting his knees like they're the most interesting thing in the room.
The sound splits through a clearing in the trees like a gunshot, startling a nest of sparrows, who tear up toward the sky in a flutter of panicked wings. A crow caws from its perch, watching.
Cas doesn’t sleep. His plans for a night alone with his favorite pastimes have been entirely derailed. But the hours after they tuck themselves into bed, curled around Dean’s warm, sleeping body are spent smiling. And Cas thinks that, given the opportunity, he’d trade a cottage by the sea for this moment in a heartbeat.
Taking in Dean's open, vulnerable expression makes Cas think that nothing about this situation is going to be basic or uncomplicated. But he wants to help. He can calm Dean down, let him get a restful night's sleep, at the very least. And to do that, he'll have to insert himself into the scene.
The glassy surface shatters on impact, and so does the ballroom scene. Cas reels as the partygoers scream, and he feels himself sharply yanked back into the present before he can fully comprehend what’s happened.
has quelled down to almost nothing. Cas thinks he should be flattered, maybe, that he’s eased Dean’s wants and worries so simply.
He doesn’t rub his hair too vigorously— the last time he did, Dean looked him up and down and asked him if a wild bear broke in and mussed it up overnight. So, he wipes the condensation from the mirror, pats the worst of his cowlicks down with his towel, and wraps it around his lower half. He’s seen Sam and Dean walk to their rooms in a towel plenty of times. Cas hasn't claimed his own room, though, so he gathers up his clothes and takes them along when he leaves the showers.
Cas accepts the pipe and lighter that's passed back down the line to him, and Sam doesn't even have to explain. Apparently, watching Dean is all the angel needed. He takes a long inhale and doesn't even cough, doesn't even look phased.
“I heard a call for help on angel radio a few days ago," Cas admits. "It originated from somewhere closeby.”
Cas tenses up. "In your dream?" Dean nods once. "Well… I was in it. What you saw of me, that was… It was me."
They don’t kiss again, but Dean scoots closer and presses their legs together. He leans into Cas’ side sleepily, unfrozen, the tension drained from his shoulders. They can talk later, ask questions when Dean’s had enough sleep, Cas decides. But for now, Cas reaches for Dean’s hand, and Dean responds easily, threading their fingers together, and that's a whole lot of answers as it is.
“Cas, why are you in here?” Cas doesn't answer. Dean lets go of his sleeve and leans back, a whisper of the same panic from the ballroom coming back to haunt his expression. “You weren’t— you—” He clears his throat again and scratches the back of his neck. “You weren’t, like, in my dream…” Cas stares. “...Right?”
Even though Sam can't hear it, Dean still grins. The weird tension from a moment ago fades mercifully into background noise, and Dean breathes again. “You’ll never guess what the bone monster dragged in.” Cas puts his hand up in greeting, like Sam’s going to see it. It’s so pure that Dean has to fix his eyes on the calendar hanging across from him so he has something else to focus on. “It’s Cas. He beat us here. What do you say I pick you up and we all head to dinner?” Cas nods amicably from the corner of his vision.
." He takes a giant bite before the waitress has fully finished walking away from their table. It's juicy, it's saucy, it's everything he dreams of while he's out on the road. He savors it with a noisy, less than appropriate swallow.
"Come on, the guy gets attacked, goes back home to his sister and plays it cool? Nah." Dean shakes his head. "He didn't know what hit him. Has to be something else."
Dean scowls and heads for the fridge, missing the triumphant smile Sam can't wipe off his face. "Beer before the big event?"
for you can’t be too much of a violation, even if they do happen to be unconscious. So, he steps closer, studying the vulnerable exposition of Dean’s sleeping form.
"How's it feel?" he directs at Cas. He's pleased when Cas seems to have the perma-smile too. It’s plastered on his face and not coming off any time soon.
Both of their doors click shut from within the bunker's halls. There's a muffled shuffling as the two hunters prepare for bed, and within twenty minutes or so, the bunker shifts into nighttime silence.
Cas takes a breath and tries to think as best as he can while Dean's eyes are locked on him so intently. He can do this. He can figure out how to help without letting Dean know it's real.
And all of the sudden they're laughing. The thought is ridiculous, and Dean feels a force pulling at the corner of his eyes, a lightness in his chest that makes him want to smile, and he knows it's hitting him. But, thankfully, he finds that he’s not nervous. This is just Sam, after all.
Still silent, Sam motions toward the backdoor that's just off to the right side of the kitchen. It's hanging off one hinge, and as they step closer, they can see a crumpled screen door lying in the grass, illuminated by the porch light outside.
“Thank you for your help, Sheriff,” he says politely, half standing. “Would you mind if we take these...?”
When Sam still doesn't answer, Dean internally swears at himself for ruining the good mood and changes the subject."Give me some more details about the case."
He makes himself pull away too soon, all too mindful of the conversation that led to this moment. When he opens his eyes, Dean is staring at him starrily, mouth parted in subdued surprise, and that eases some of Cas’ doubts. Cradling Dean’s face in his hand, Cas thinks this might be the only moment he’ll think about for the rest of time.
"I’m not-- Cas, I didn't--" Sam clears his throat as if to remind them that he’s here, and Dean decides in that moment that he doesn't care. "Yeah, yeah, whatever. I know."
"Well…" Dean doesn't want to say he's glad she's gone, or that we've all been there, or that he's sorry, because he doesn't think any of those are really true. So, he settles on what he knows, a simple fact that makes this whole situation easier. "It's good to have you back."
"He could have made them with no natural predators, and taken the stinger off. Or created more pollen-spreaders," Cas continues thoughtfully.
Dean, who is pretty fucking sure he just dropped Sam off for an interview on the other side of town the last time he checked, raises his eyebrows at the coroner’s kind-faced receptionist. "...My partner?"
Dean is the first to break whatever stalemate they’re locked in. “Agent!” he exclaims, and Cas jumps. “Sorry I’m late. Thanks, we can take it from here,” he directs at the receptionist.
Back in his vessel, he opens his eyes to the sight of Dean’s drowsy, half-lidded green ones, half-illuminated by the television screen. Dean is pulled to full consciousness only a split second later.
"Hmm. I think maybe, yes. Perhaps from the chocolate." Cas looks up and Dean can see his eyes starting to close, just a little. The angel breaks out into a smile. "This is fun."
Cas meets Sam and Dean's shocked expressions and seems to recognize he's done something abnormal. He leans forward and tacks on a polite, "Please.”
“Missy reported him leavin' for the store and not comin' back, day before last. He’s been livin’ with her while she goes through her divorce, helpin’ her take care of the kids.” Ullman shakes his head mournfully. “Missy saw him stumblin’ into the front lawn yesterday about seven am, all bloody, tellin’ her to stay back. She said he was holdin’ his stomach, and then he just…” He gestures to the ground. “Keeled over.”
"Did this place have a vending machine?" Dean asks hopefully, gazing up at the popcorn ceiling and trying to discern shapes. Hmm, he thinks he can see an angel in there.
Sam says, “See you in the morning, Cas,” and Dean says, “’Night, buddy,” and Cas bids them goodnight back, his arms propped idly on the surface of the map table. He listens as they amble off to their respective rooms, groaning about their stiff muscles.
