John guffaws at that. 'Well, it seems I just got one.'
He is at his desk, and Rosie sleeps on the carpet in front of it, surrounded by toys. Sherlock gets up at the sight of him. 'I'm sorry John, I didn't notice her getting sleepy while talking to Lestrade, and I thought it was best not to move her- hmmf'
The three scratches on his hand are not showing any sign of receding. Since they are shallow wounds he had assumed in the morning they would be gone. But they are still there, to remind him something will happen. That he has a price to pay for having a wish granted. He's not sure what it is, and the anticipation is eating his stomach from the inside out.
Something sparks in John's memory. 'You told me you went to meet me first thing after you arrived. You were still hurt?'
It's probably a bad habit that he always runs after the ending of the moment. As it turns out, not having to worry about climaxing is very relaxing. He and Sherlock kiss everywhere, caress everywhere, and they don't rush. In a moment of inspiration, John turns Sherlock to lie on his stomach and proceeds to explore his whole back.
'Are you really going to try that again?' John asks, putting everything back into his first aid kit. 'Doesn't seem prudent.'
The other thing is… he doesn't really know the boundaries between them anymore. Sherlock has always been sort of invasive of people's personal space, John's especially, and John is taking advantage of that to keep close. To touch when necessary. When it's not necessary. Sherlock hasn't commented on it, John hasn't really thought about it. He just realises he likes to be close to him, and now he can do that.
Sherlock shrugs. 'Not going to change the past.'
'Anthea. The blackberry bot. Brunette, green eyes.'
Mycroft sighs.
'About what?'
‘Well, when I touched the baby topic she didn’t seem much excited about it. I questioned if she thought she was ready to be a mother and she changed the conversation. I don’t know, it was a bit weird. Oh, and John, do you think she should be drinking coffee so close to the due date? She felt a bit sick afterwards.’
'Sounds nice.' he replies quickly, cleaning his bowl. 'I have to go. Just remembered I left a toxic compound in the counter. Mrs. Hudson could get hurt.' he stands up.
She kept quiet, smiling. He glanced at her, surely waiting a comment or something of the kind. She remained watching him expectantly. He glanced again at her breasts and then away, as if he sensed he was going to get caught.
There's dried blood on the floor, and something smells foul. Sherlock is awkwardly locked up on the floor. He releases his hands with pliers someone passes to him, they look a roughed up and a purpleish. Head and pupils checked over, he doesn't seem to have a concussion, but he is very hot to the touch. He finds the source of both blood and odour: a very infected wound on his thigh. There's also urine under him, making his trousers humid.
They had sat down the night before and talked about what was going to happen. First things first, he had told John how he created a diversion to quickly remove Mary out of the picture. He improvised that quickly after John confessed to bugging her phone, and it was a relief she took the bait. He sent a message as a possible client about a man he needed killed in Wales. The profile he provided lacked the crucial information that the concerned target was actually a missing person for ten years now. His network saw her leaving London immediately after he confirmed payment on her Paypal.
Mary pokes her head from behind the door, smiling. 'I'm back.'
Almost finishing!!! Yayyy
'Please talk to me. Don't leave me out like this.' and there it is, the wobbly threat of tears, the very last thing Sherlock wants. The concept of John Watson crying is enough to distress him, seeing it right now… He doesn't really have enough energy left to deal with it.
Sherlock is waving a bit. John is reminded that he didn't get any sleep last night, and who knows for how long this week. 'Hey, go take your shower and I'll look to your wound before you sleep.'
. I'm going to sleep now.
'You don't always do this.' John asserts, but with a tone of unsureness in his voice. 'I would have noticed.'
John hadn't known how unhappy he had been until it was all given back to him. No, scratch that. John had been in a similar state when he came back to London, and Sherlock showed him the light. Sherlock had been everything he needed, even if it meant developing a kinda unhealthy relationship to him rather soon. John doesn't like to think of himself as co-dependent but… if someone makes your blood boil like you've never been alive before, you'd want to stay close to that person, wouldn't you?
Of course, going back so far in the suburbs and continuing working in Paddington means a burdensome commute. To his surprise though, upon leaving 221, Mary had walked them to her parked brand new silver Range Rover Discovery. He was shocked, but when questioned about the funds she had just shrugged
'I know, I already got it.'
'Sir, please-' the guy tries to pull his arm, just as Mycroft's robot minion comes out of the door ajar, Blackberry in hand as usual.
James Sholto… that was a long shot. There were some scarce communication between them after John came back to England, but nothing significative. Despite his perseverance with Anna that he was going to the reception, he hadn’t hold much expectation beyond the respect for formalities. The mixed feelings he still had about him contributed to a bit of overreaction on his part when he actually turned up.
Rosie's room is very weird. He doesn't want to think about it, but her old rattle keeps jumping from the toy box, and it's very unnerving. It's been hours since they arrived, but he still can't place where the walls are. He can see the orange waves of heat, and the melting wallpaper, but he can't touch it.
'I bet there are a ton of videos of that silly man you are not showing me.' she scolds with a mischievous twinkle in her eyes.
He stops mid movement, one arm still out of the Belstaff, considering. 'I'll arrange for someone to deliver formula as soon as possible.' It's hardly ideal a baby her age who technically breastfeeds, but it's the only way, as nobody sent extra bottled milk.
'That's very kind of her, love.' she answers. Sherlock flinches minutely and bites more pie.  Oh, you know what I just remembered? In the plane Sherlock, before overdosing, you were reading John's first post about you, weren't you?'
'She was, but she lost the baby shortly after I came back to Baker Street. She never told me and pretended she was still pregnant so I went back home. Two days ago she had a gastric emergency and the whole thing was uncovered.'
Sherlock frowns all the way to his nose. 'I texted you a lot. I even called you yesterday, to no avail.'
'Oh, I see.' Mycroft sighs, looking down. 'Being alone never did good to him. I made a mistake.'
Brent instinctively pushes Sherlock in front of him, aiming the gun wherever, as if he's indecisive. Sherlock can feel the hand holding his shoulder trembling, and he knows if the man was truly purposeful he'd point the gun at Sherlock himself. One more wannabe criminal tediously stupid.
'Mycroft took care of it.'
The scars are clearly result of violence. He can even a see a tiny cigarette burn near the waistline. They follow no particular pattern, but John's trained medical eye detects that they were quite painfully produced. 'When this happened?' he asks finally, barely trusting his voice not to crack.
See ya :)
Mycroft appears at the door, John jumps to him and grabs his collar. 'You go away and take these people with you.' he growls right at his face, personal space be damned. 'Don't touch his things, do you hear me?'
'Cheers. It's all I ask.' he looks impossibly mellow, and Sherlock just wants to bury himself in his arms and never come out. 'Also. Well. I'm terrible at relationships, ok? You're not the reason I got dumped by all my girlfriends, you were just… the vector.'
'But your… Those two years, taking apart Moriarty's web? I thought...' he trails off, not wanting to finish the sentence.
She thankfully sleeps all the way back to London in her baby car seat. Nobody knows where Mary is. When they enter Westminster to drop Sherlock home, John holds his hand for a minute. At Baker Street, he squeezes back just the once.
‘If it comforts you, David.’ John interrupts. ‘It doesn’t matter. I wish I wasn’t married to her. Technically I’m not, since she’s using a fake identity.’
Sherlock huffs and looks away, appearing embarrassed for the first time. '
When he asks if tomorrow could they work on a heavy bag she laughs and acquiesces.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Funny thing isn't it," John thinks a bit hysterically. "that the whole trouble started because he knew something, but it only takes a bullet in his head to guarantee he can't do anything else to anyone. It would have been better if he had some prints"
'Then we should start the second phase of the plan. The due date is soon anyway. I've contacted some integral people and they agreed to help us, after long and boring conversations.'
What he didn't tell John was his own fears. The ones he is trying very hard to conceal right now. The intrusive thoughts keep clouding his determination, and it's so annoying how he doesn't
He knows quite a bit about fevers, and tells her about it while he gives her a fresh bath in a plastic washbasin he put in the kitchen sink to avoid contamination. He hopes the warmth in her body drops this way. 'Once I mixed up lots of illicit narcotics you don't need to know about right now - and please never use them, Watson, or your dad will kill me - so the withdrawal happened to be the embodiment of hell.'
He palms the edge of the hole for the pickaxe head he left there, exchanging again with the shovel. His own water bottle is already empty and he tosses it in the general direction of the suitcase. The second bottle he brings inside, just as the cat jumps over the coffin, in front of him.
'Oh but John soon won't have the chance.' she replies with condescendence. 'Newborn children take a lot of time. Children in general.'
'Ok, what are you implying?' he inquires more sharply than he intended.
'Isn't it too hot? Did you test before giving to her?'
to him. He manages to record a video and send to Sherlock (and tells him to show to Mrs. Hudson), and Molly, and Greg, and even Mycroft.
He takes the tube and a bus to get to the suburbs. Anna's car is parked outside, and he's surprised he had forgotten about that. He needs to organize the documentation and send to Mycroft so he can sell it too. He can't drive, and it's impossible to have a car in central London, so there's no point in keeping it.
He's not lying. It doesn't. There's nothing else to add against Anna, because he was over her for a long time now.
before. Or at least before Sherlock's… fake death. He tries to remember once he's seen Sherlock's bare back after he returned, but his mind comes blank. In fact, he now realises that he's been actively avoiding parading his bare back. Last time he entered the bathroom with Sherlock showering in it was right after the tarmac, and he had put on a towel.
A case of stolen documents normally wouldn't rank even a 4 on their system, but as Sherlock learned a young woman's career would be forever ruined thanks to the jealousy of her male flatmate, he set them on the run. In fact, the time-sensitive nature of the case makes them literally run around the city the whole day. They find out the flatmate was already at the train station, so Sherlock steals a bus to get them there before the 7pm train.

People consider twelve weeks the safe point, but spontaneous miscarriage could happen until about twenty weeks, even if not that common. What could have caused it? She wasn't exactly young. Twelve weeks. They both know the procedures of late miscarriage, and all the pain involved. He remembers Mycroft mentioning her going to a pharmacy in his first surveillance report.
Gathering up whatever energy he still has, he throws the pick at the middle part of the coffin. After a couple blows, the wood breaks, and it's easy to just complete the line that makes it possible to open just half the lid, that he throws sideways carelessly.
He takes off his clothes and before he reaches the shower, he catches a glance of his reflection.
'I threw you at the floor.' John cuts him. 'I forced you on your back and took a beat at you. For the state of your scars you should have been a mess back then.'
They relish in the companionable silence while they can until John gives up procrastinating and goes home with a heavy heart. When he is near his destiny his phone chimes with a text. He's ready for Sherlock's randomness, but it's an image from Greg. It's a photo from this afternoon, John and Sherlock with their comic birthday hats, each one in a side of the room apparently talking to other people but they are in fact looking at each other.
'You're John Watson. The blog one.' he says ogling him carefully. 'About Sherlock Holmes.'
(John actually wishes he could have arrived sooner. Perhaps things were different if he had just punched the man silly.)
'Sherlock. No.'
He searches the area around the Janus Cars company. He goes back to the planetarium, even buys a ticket to enter but as soon as the supernova projection starts he nopes out. He visits the neighbourhood where Alex Woodbridge lived, and the Hickman Gallery, and the Thames banks area where his body was found.
'Excuse me? What are you even-' and the door slams on his face. There are three scheduled patients next and a couple walk-ins, so he can't go after explanations right now. His blood is boiling the rest of the morning, though.
'Look after him… please?'
, leaving John behind. And then, a moment later, he hears it.
He takes the offered plastic bag, opening it careful to not contaminate the substance. It looks colourful and the smell is strong and vibrant. He takes a small bit and smothers between his fingers. It feels moist. 'Organic grown, and recently cured. This is high quality product.'
BOOOOOOOOOM
I promised myself this would be the last project in which I write Mary. So I enjoyed doing this.
activate fuzzy rooms. big cat mouth stretching wide but not open.
‘Must be her. Just a second.’ and John has to bite his tongue not to giggle absurdly at Sherlock’s scarlet cheeks and dishevelled hair, which obviously Janine is going to notice. He takes a seat in his chair, waiting for them to come upstairs.
‘For go- my daughter! I thought she was going into early labour, but we still have some weeks to go. Is the baby all right?’
He hears Sherlock stomping down the stairs through the ceiling. The madman probably tried to pack the whole flat, as he doesn't like to get separated from his stuff. How he survived two years with only the clothes on his body is a mystery to John. He smiles to himself. 'To be
‘Ok, right, give me the address!’
'I'm way better actually. Ready to get the hell out of here. What happened?'
'She's old enough to not like strangers.' Sherlock answers.
'Until it came the day that he asked me to deliver some papers to a guy, who got very angry. I don't even know what they were about, but the guy beat me anyway.'
John shifted his weight, pointed hesitantly at his crotch then pressed his face into his arm.
Sherlock. Call him ‘Johnny’ and yourself ‘Daddy’. Lastly will you please stop making excuses and just explain to Johnny very nicely that Daddy doesn’t always want tickles but that he would
because I promised I wouldn't. Really, John, you’re so jumpy! Sweetie, come back and finish your picture, come on, that's a good boy.” He smiled encouragingly and patted the spot next to him.
“I know,” Jim nodded seriously, “Sometimes little boys need help, lots of things to keep track of. So, do you need help with that?”
Sherlock grunted softly, he kissed John’s neck and breathed out, “Johnny, are you getting close? Are you going to come?”
Jim shrugged, “Here, maybe that was too broad a subject,” He stuck his tongue between his teeth and added a few horns and more teeth to his dino, “You like coloring?”
boy you’re being for us.”
John fidgeted and nodded slowly, looking at his hands, “Mhm . . . “
! Let’s just sit quietly and color for a bit, alright?” Jim sat down again and sighed, “You’re such a good, quiet boy, Johnny. Does your daddy have to yell at you all the time?”
Sherlock was quiet, he looked at John who wouldn’t look at him then frowned, “I know he has a high sex-drive but we-”
Sherlock bent forward and kissed John’s belly just under his navel as he eased the phallic toy in, “Shh, be patient. Almost in.”
“H-He doesn’t have to know!” John said quickly then he bit his lip, “I-I . . . “ John Hamish Watson took a deep breath and put his head down on the table, biting his lip so hard that he felt the skin split, feeling his small space slipping back, “ . . . Jim . . . I’m so horny and I want to have sex so badly but Sherlock isn’t there yet and he’ll touch me but . . . he seems uncomfortable with me being in Little Space for fucking . . . please . . . I’m begging you, please get Little Johnny off . . . I need it so
John shifted to his other foot and slowly opened his eyes, Jim was holding his hand out and it took John a moment or two before he slowly reached out and took it. He resisted the urge to suck his thumb or cry or anything else embarrassing as he was led down a long hallway to a door.
Soon John was a writhing dripping mess, his balls were so tight that it almost hurt and he felt the building desperation, Sherlock was stroking him too slowly to match the intensity of the toy inside him, “Mmgh!!” John whined loudly, squirming to try and get through his need.
John nodded frantically, looking at Sherlock but the detective leaned forward with his elbows on his knees and his fingers steepled in front of his face. “Mhm! Please!” John’s legs squirmed as hands moved way too slow and he was getting impatient.
“I know you do!” JIm smiled widely and produced a coloring book, “Hope you like animals; Sebby has a fixation on them: big scary jungle beasts mostly.” He watched John for a few moments as the blonde picked out a picture to color and a few crayons, his tongue caught between his teeth, “Johnny, how old are you?”
“Good.” Jim nodded then smiled slightly, “Johnny, let’s get you out of the pyjamas before you make a mess. There’s a good boy, what a
Sebastian shifted, “I . . . I was flicking cars an’ . . . an’ I hit him in the nose with one... but I said I was sorry, and he isn’t crying anymore!”
“I see.” Jim’s frown deepened and he crossed his arms, “Why were you flicking cars, Sebastian?”
“Alright, that’s a good-” The door opened and Jim slid gracefully back to his seat, smiling widely, “Sherlock, there you are!”
, he’s crying because he wishes it was
Sebastian looked up suddenly, “No! I did the
Sherlock stepped into the room, his eyes darting about with interest then he stopped and smiled at John, “There
Sherlock stretched out next to John and slipped an arm around him while a lube-slicked finger was inserted and John arched and whined, his mouth fell open only to grunt as the head of the dildo was pushed in.
Seb’s cheeks flushed, and he didn’t respond.

“Oh like I would let anyone touch that thing, it’s practically biohazardous material at this point . . . “ Jim muttered, “Relax, your
and I warned you that if you did that-”
John arched off the bed as a hand gently, too gently, cupped and touched his groin, already stiff and interested members were flexing into the deft hand. John groaned when the hand moved back up, “N-Noooo!” He whined and covered his face.
, otherwise I wouldn‘t let you touch the thing.  Seb also acts out a lot and needs spanking, time outs, and stern words, he likes the humiliation more than he needs cuddles if you catch my drift. Oh he’s a Little and he loves our special Daddy time. Ah, but we’re talking about you and your Daddy, so what else? What else can I Learn about you?”
John’s cheeks flushed, “Yes, I’m toilet trained.”
Sherlock propped himself up on his elbow and carefully took off his gloves, discarding them before glancing at Jim, “Hurry up.”
Sherlock blinked awkwardly and grimaced, “About what?”
it, Sherlock, how absolutely
“Oh for pity’s sake, Sebby!” Jim got to his feet and headed to the door, “I’ll get someone to make you a sandwich how you like it, now behave, I’ll be right back.”
John crawled up onto the bed and sat on it, nervously playing with the tail of his onesie while Jim rolled up his sleeves and cracked his neck. John watched red-faced as Jim took a box out from under the bed and opened it to show a collection of sex toys.
Sherlock grimaced, “John, we talked about this, I don’t-”
Sherlock looked at John who looked back at him with large eyes and he leaned closer to him, “Are you alright with that, Johnny?”
“After, Sebby,
“No, you are going to sit right there and watch John color or color yourself. I don’t care, and you’re going to listen to me because I have
John didn’t answer, his eyes staring straight ahead as the ringing in his ear persisted, the sound of the gunshot echoing just beneath it.
what you are seeing!”
John blinked, “Oh, well, what do you want me to tell you?”
Sebastian scowled as he tugged a tiger onesie out of a bag in the bottom of the closet,, it was faded and the knees, elbows, bottom and crotch were all worn so thin that you could see through them but Sebastian stubbornly stomped over to his racecar bed and sat down to unlace his boots. He started to undress then stopped when he caught John looking at him curiously, “ . . . I want Patches back . . . “
John shook his head, looking down at the table, “I like both . . . “
“Sherlock, I’ve been having a very interesting discussion with Johnny here, you know he’s four?” Jim stood, patting John on the head and pulling his hood back up.
“Good! Sebby likes coloring too, but only when he’s needing a nap. It settles him down. Do  you like toys other than stuffies? Cars, blocks, trains, etc.”
“Sebby,” Jim said, standing and taking his hand, leading him to the closet, “What did Daddy say about showing everyone in the world your private parts? That’s a
“Alright that’s enough!” Sherlock stood up angrily, “Moriarty, sto-”
Seb hurried over, grabbing onto John’s shoulder, “Hey, you’re fine! It didn’t hit that hard! Oh for fuc- I mean, please stop! Stop crying!! Stop!” he shook John a bit which only seemed to startle the smaller blonde further, “Uh! Uh! Uh!” Seb looked around then he grabbed Patches the beige dog and a blanket and pulled John into his lap, wincing slightly. He tucked the blanket tightly around John anyway, pushed the pacifier back in his mouth, and snuggled him, “It’s okay, I’m sorry, it’s not from bad people . . . no one will hurt you here . . . Daddy doesn't let anyone hurt me and guns are a no-no in my room . . . I’m sorry I flicked the car at you . . .  I thought you were lying.“
Jim smiled and leaned closer, brushing the hood off John’s head and gently stroked his fingers through John’s hair, “Let me help, you want him to touch your prince parts, your naughty bits that tingle and tickle whenever Daddy looks at you, the places that get hot and uncomfortable, places where you can feel your heartbeat and feels like your going to potty in your underpants. You want him to touch that, don’t you?”
Sherlock, he’s as sexual as any other . . . are you gay, John? Is that what you are? Gay? You like other boys?”
John blinked since it wasn’t a question, “Well . . . what do you want to know?”
Jim wants details while John and Sherlock discover some things, agree to some things, and change some things.
for it, Sherlock. And your head is so far up your ass you can’t even smell the shit. How long did you google stupid flowery blogs with tags about being ‘naughty’ and pictures of grown adults in onesies and sucking on pacifiers, Sherlock? Hours probably and you didn’t do the one thing I told you to do! TALK TO HIM!” Jim snapped, he was angry, his voice and face showed as much but his hands remained gentle and soft, which only seemed to drive John further into a wriggling mess, “He’s too small to explain what he wants! He doesn’t know the phrases or words to telegraph his need through your gorgeous curls to penetrate that thick skull! Look at him, Sherlock, really look and describe
John panted and squirmed then groaned in relief as the toy full sunk into his guts, he bit his lip and reached for Sherlock’s hand. He pulled on him slightly, “Need you, Daddy.” He murmured almost sleepily.
Jim’s hand dropped to Sebastian’s lap and he leaned in, “Are you grumpy because you’re hungry, Sebby, my little tiger? Did you not eat the snacks Daddy had packed for you?”
“That should be, give it here.” Jim held his hand out for the toy while his other scissored inside John.
“ . . . not usually.” John mumbled, his eyes fell on the toys and he didn’t notice his belt being pulled open or his trousers falling to the floor until he was prompted to lift his foot and put it through the leg of the dragon pyjamas then he let Jim pull it up to his shoulders and slip the hood over his head before zipping it up. John felt much, much better as the soft, warm onesie made him feel secure and calmer, he was handed a beige stuffed dog with one of the eyes missing, large patches sewn across the back.
John shifted and nodded slowly, looking at his feet, he was actually starting to feel a lot better just from the tone of Jim’s voice and the surroundings.
“I said I’m toilet trained.” John muttered sullenly.
John fidgeted and wanted to hide but Jim patted the top of his head and scowled at Sebastian Moran, “Now, Sebastian, that’s a very rude way to introduce yourself to new friends! This is Johnny and he’s waiting for his daddy to come pick him up. I told him you would play with him for a bit but I don’t know,” Jim stood up and stalked over to Moran, “You’ve been a very naughty boy, Sebby, very naughty indeed. Firstly you put a sign on your door with
Jim smiled, “Interesting, so you’re not a total baby soft boy.”
“That’s it, nice and comfy . . . “ Jim murmured giving John a little kiss on the cheek, “Now, you have something you want me to do? You’re a big enough boy to tell me, go on.”
On the door was a large piece of butcher’s paper taped haphazardly to the wooden panels that said ‘Sebastian’s room! Bugger off!’ with a poorly drawn skull and crossbones underneath it. John blinked at it then looked at Jim curiously.
that was making it happen. He’s flushed, erect, and
John started to calm down, his nose hurt still but it wasn’t bleeding anymore, but he had to squeeze his eyes shut tightly or he’d see the rusty colored spots of drying blood and the scary bits would be back . . .
and whined, he reached down and played with himself, his fingers stroking over his own prick and balls. He closed his eyes and whined softly, “MMph! D-Daddy . . . !”
John wasn’t sure why he’d been there at the time; Sherlock had mentioned something about Jim wanting to show him something. So, he went to the place on the card that had somehow gotten in his windbreaker-pocket, but the details of before were blurry as blood spattered across his face and shirt. The man that had been shot gurgled and fell backward. The blonde stood perfectly still, his chest rising and falling and eyes wide.
“Oh no you don’t, you’re going to sleep in the guest room, I know what’ll happen the second your little prick makes contact with that wretched horse! You’re going to go lay down, your private parts are going in time out and John is going to play here. And you can forget what Daddy promised you this morning, Sebastian, now scoot!”
Sherlock, much to John’s surprise, looked totally and completely cowed, he slowly went around and sat next to John, his brow furrowed, “Fine, I’m sitting, may we go now?”
“Excellent.” Jim smoothed his sweater and lead the way back out of the room, “We just got this absolutely delicious blend.”
“Here, everything will fit you since Seb is so much bigger than you, you are toilet trained, aren’t you, Johnny boy?” Jim asked seriously as he held the closet open to reveal rows of onesies and other articles hanging on racks.
“I’m not crying.” John mumbled, looking at all of Sebastian’s toys, picture books and he probably had a whole closet full of-
Bigsley, did he?”
John whined softly and lowered his head and Sherlock frowned, he sighed and glared at Jim, “You’re the expert, are you?”
John nodded frantically and thrust into Sherlock’s hand more fervently, “Y-Yes! Please, Daddy, please let me come- let me come- let me- c-come-! I’m c-coming!” John shivered and spasmed, curling his hips as cum bubbled over Sherlock’s hand. John breathed in shakily as he finally stopped coming and made a soft noise.
“Ah,” Jim grimaced, “You aren’t. Alright, c’mon, Johnny, that’s it, good boy, let’s go.” He gently tugged John out of the foyer, “You’re early, sweetheart, I was supposed to be done with my work by the time you came here.” He was talking very fast, “Your daddy phoned me but that doesn’t matter right now does it? Don’t fuss, you have blood on your face.” He licked the handkerchief with ‘SH’ embroidered on it and tried again to wipe at the blood on John’s face.
working on it, Sherlock and that’s fine; your specific sexual needs are just as important as his, but John needs an outlet. Sherlock, have you been jerking him off before bed or in the bath? Have you put something nice up his bottom when you aren’t in the mood? Sit down, Sherlock, you exhaust me with how you just stand there, playing at being imposing when I can see your hands shaking because you know I’m right and
John grimaced and pulled back, pushing Jim away a bit and looking around as things started to settle in his ears and mind, but he could still see the man getting shot and falling. He pressed his hands on either side of his head and made a low whining sound, squeezing his eyes shut.
“I’m here.” Sherlock climbed up to the head of the bed and laid on his side then pulled John to his chest so he could spoon him. He carefully arranged them so John’s backside was pressed to Sherlock’s groain. Holmes wrapped one arm tightly around John’s chest pinning his arms while the other reached down to stroke John’s erection. If that wasn’t all bad enough, he kept thrusting against the toy up John’s ass so that it jabbed his prostate.
give it to his little boy.” Jim leaned forward narrowing his eyes, “If you don’t know what to do, then bloody well
“Yes, thank you.” John leaned into the touch unconsciously.
.” Jim muttered, pulling on a pair of gloves and he smiled sweetly at John, “Johnny, how about you lie back on the pillows, mhm, it’s alright, yes like that. Okay now you’re being such a good boy, aren’t you? How about I come cuddle with you a bit, hm? Would you like that? Tell me, Johnny, would you like Uncle Jimmy to come cuddle?”
Sherlock shook his head, “I’ll do it.”
better.” He sighed resignedly and shoved the door open, “Don’t worry, Sebby is out on a job and won’t be back for a bit so you can get settled and calm down before then. Here we are!”
John bit his lip harder and nodded, his eyes tightly shut and he hugged the dog Patches tighter because he was starting to feel it again, the stirrings and tightness.
them on top of
“Not the point,” Jim sighed, reaching over to pet John’s back, “How are you feeling? Better?”
Seb smirked and flicked two more cars, laughing when they jumped up too and hit John in the shoulder then one hit him right in the nose. Seb blinked and sat up, “Uh, oops.”
“What does that mean?” John muttered, staring at the picture of a hippo with its mouth open wide and rubbed his pacifier against his lips again.
“Ah, we remember Uncle Jimmy’s rules, very good!” Jim beamed and pulled a onesie out that was a bright green dragon, “Do you like dragons, Johnny?”
“There we go! Hold still, I’m going to get a picture for your daddy, he’ll love it!” Jim took his phone out.
boy.” John watched Jim undo his windbreaker and slide it off then his sweater, shirt, shoes and Jim stopped with his fingers on John’s belt, “Incidentally, can you use the bathroom on your own?”
, Sebby, Johnny doesn’t want to see them no matter how proud you are of them. That’s naughty, Seb!”
Seb slowly shifted John to the floor to sit next to him and he swallowed, “I . . . I was-“
Johnny is somewhere he shouldn't be and Jim loses his patience.
Jim shrugged and pointed at the bed, “He goes for a pony ride.”
“He’s getting impatient, Sherlock. Talk to him.” Jim said from somewhere out of sight but his voice was tight and breathless.
when Daddy isn’t around and he gets tickles.”
John slowly shifted back, but he looked at Jim warily, “ . . . Uncle Jimmy?”
“You’re playing with John’s penis.” Sherlock said tightly, not looking.
“Sebby, you have a lot of toys, please stop.” Jim said tiredly, “Daddy had a long day and if you’re extra good for him while John is here, we’ll take a long bath and Daddy will let you play with him. Alright?”
Jim was quiet for a moment then he leaned forward and kissed John’s temple, sliding an arm around his shoulders, “How about this,” He said softly in that soft, soft tone that made John want to cry, “When your daddy comes, we make him an offer with your complete consent, I’ll show him how it will work, I’ll show him how to please Little you, he can watch, masturbate if he’s into that sort of thing, hell I’ll lend him a toy or fleshlight if he wants; and you’ll lie back and be Little. If you’re uncertain of my motives, I’ll use your Daddy’s special word for you, say it just once and I’ll stop and Daddy can take over. How’s that sound?”
“There now we can all get- Oh, no, Sebby, please, Daddy told you he would buy you new ones! I thought I threw that ratty thing out.” Jim sighed in defeat and sat back down next to John.
John put his hands over Sherlock’s and pulled the toy into his mouth further, sucking on it while his hips worked, the motions oddly soothing and his eyelids lowered slightly.
John stared at him and he remembered what Jim had said before, that he wanted someone, anyone that would understand to tell all this to, that he could say all the things he wanted or liked without judgement so he slowly put his hands down and his lip shook, “He . . . he hasn’t touched me yet.”
Sebastian stood in his pyjamas for a moment and he bit his lip, glaring at John, “He broke the blue one . . . “
Jim smirked and leaned over to Sherlock, “now, tell him what a good job he’s doing, what a good boy he’s being. Go on.”
doing here?”
“There, that’s better, isn’t it!” Jim beamed, reaching over to pet Seb’s back and shoulders, “You’re such a nice boy, Sebby! This is why it’s so hard for you to make little friends; you cover up how shy you are with being a naughty boy! Other little boys and girls would like you so much faster if you’d stop being so mean!”
are.”
John mumbled out that he’d need help and started to feel shy, he peeked at Jim and shifted his weight to his other foot.
“Oh grow the fu- grow up!” Jim snapped and shifted his hands, using one to cradle John closer to him and the other stroked over John’s erect prick, “I’m doing a lot more than that, now pay attention, might learn something.”
“Now, why are you stomping around the house? That’s also rude, you know Daddy doesn’t like a lot of noise.” Jim crossed his arms, “Sebby, did you not do a good job with your project?”
. Go on, Sherlock,” Jim picked out another picture and started coloring, “Talk to him.”
“No-o!” Sebastian whined, pulling back, “I just got home! Make him go away! It’s not fair! I don’t wanna share my toys or my clothes! He’s-”
“Oh, so you’re a big boy now,” Jim nodded and sat back, leaning his weight on his hands, “Do you have a paci with you? Would you like one? Sebastian is not a fan of them very much but I still have some.” John pointed at his discarded jeans and kept coloring while Jim retrieved them and went through the pockets until he found John’s blue pacifier, he smiled and walked back, holding it out, “Here we are!”
Sherlock   walked out of the bathroom stark naked, still towel-drying his hair.    "You may as well have a lie-in.  I've got a few things to wrap up with   the head of security, and I've been told they want me to give some   god-awful soundbite about losing gracefully for the highlight reel.  I'm   tempted to tell them I lost on purpose because I was tired of waiting   to shag my flatmate."  He tossed his wet towel onto the bed and  rummaged  through his suitcase for clean pants.
"I didn't sleep with her."
Sherlock   hummed in assent.  "A few.  You've never had sex with a man before   without a woman being the focus of the encounter."  He skimmed his   fingernails lightly up John's sides.
Roylott called.  That was it, the final hand.
They   both made it to the second round, and by that time Sherlock had  figured  out that the cards were being marked with a special dye that  was only  visible under the casino lighting by a special filter.   Sherlock, mad  chemist that he was, was able to whip up a  concoction that, when  spread over the lenses of regular non-Polarized  sunglasses, worked as a  the same kind of filter.  From there they were able to eliminate a  handful of possible suspects simply by what  they'd worn to the table.
"Yes.    Good to know you're amenable to accommodating any proclivities I  might  have, though," Sherlock said with dry amusement as John levered  himself  up and away.  Sherlock toed of his insanely expensive shoes and  they  each hit the floor with a thunk.
John   was sure he would spend a lot of time reviewing Sherlock's past   behaviour for any possible indicators of interest later.  "We're   idiots," John agreed.  He leaned forward and Sherlock met him halfway   for the kiss.
"It's   all a mind game, John," he said, bending low and whispering in  John's  ear.  John, well aware of the angle of the camera and what it  would  look like to anyone watching, felt his face flush bright red.    Sherlock was just as aware, John was positive, and so his next   action had to be a move to affect the other players.  Had to be.
John shivered.  "No, just curious.  Men too?"  He ran his teeth lightly over Sherlock's shoulder.
Sherlock   humphed, but John continued.  "Because you are.  You're a very pretty   man."  John gave him a smacking kiss on the lips, then pulled back and   smiled.  "You'd make a terrible girl though."
"Would   you have?"  John fitted his mouth squarely over the mark, biting down   and then sucking the skin.  He worried the flesh with his teeth and   tongue, intent on overwriting the slight discolouration with a livid   bruise of his own.
Then   he'd met Sherlock and he'd found a better way to get his kicks.  He   still met up with Murray and a few of Murray's mates every now and then   for a friendly game, but his heart wasn't in it.  He usually ended up   walking away with his pockets a few pounds lighter, but a smile on his   face.
Sherlock   shook hands with Roylott - who was already out of his chair and  jumping  around like a football hooligan - and made his way through the  swarming  crowd to John, a smile on his face.
John's   brain was by then fully engaged in all things sexual.  "That's fine, I   can work with that."  For someone John had thought of as asexual just   the day before, Sherlock was turning out to be full of surprises.
John   could feel the mood shift to something headier, more serious.  They   were doing this.  It had been a long time coming and now it was actually   happening.  Neither had mentioned love, but the intense, reverent look   on Sherlock's face said more than any number of declarations could.
"And   who says I'll be cheating?" Sherlock asked with a smirk.  He   plucked the sunglasses from where they'd been resting on top of his head   and slipped them onto John's face.  One of the cameramen moved closer,   his curiosity piqued by Sherlock's actions.
It was the king of hearts, and just like that, Sherlock had lost.
e dealt with those   feelings the way he dealt with most other things, by keeping his eyes   forward and soldiering on.  Of course, if not having feelings was a   matter of will alone, none of it would have been an issue in the first   place.
John   wasn't in the business of lying to himself, not in the past, and not   then.  He'd harboured strong feelings for Sherlock practically from the   first day he met the man, and those feelings had grown into something   he didn't want to admit the depth of to himself, mostly because   Sherlock was
Hunched   over the bar, shirt collar unbuttoned and bow-tie hanging loose around   his neck, John had a tiny epiphany.  At first he thought he'd  been  angry at the nature of Sherlock's presumption and the lengths he'd  go  to for a case.  He knew that Sherlock would have found a way out  of  it before anything went too far, but only after he'd got whatever   information he was looking for from the girl.  That wasn't the issue,   though.
"Possibly,   had she not been involved in the case.  She was exceptionally bright,   even when taking into account her current profession.  I knew you were   listening, by the way."
"Had sex?  Yes.  Is that important?"  Sherlock's fingertips traced light circles on the skin of John's lower back.
John   frowned.  He'd wanted Sherlock to win, even if he'd have been an   insufferable git for being proved right (in his own mind at least, John   had yet to be convinced that one could win by simply reading the other   players while disregarding the cards one held) and the prize money  would  have been forfeited back to the casino.  So much for luck.
John   had been expecting Sherlock to respond with a scornful dismissal or a   brush-off.  Was Sherlock saying what John thought he was saying?    Sherlock didn't do subtle.  Incomprehensible, yes, but never   deliberately ambiguous.  John amended that -- never deliberately   ambiguous unless he was fishing for information.  John tried to squash   down the tendril of hope that unfurled in his chest.
Sherlock's face melted into a grin.  "You're an idiot," he said, sounding entirely too cheerful.
just killed a man to save me.  It was... eye-opening."
"Stroke   of good luck, that," he said to the player next to him.  The way   Sherlock enunciated the final consonant of 'luck' and the slight pause   after the word was deliberately for John's benefit, he was sure.    Sherlock being an arrogant prick didn't dampen the exhilaration John   felt in that moment.  It was like the vicarious excitement he felt when   watching a rugby match on telly combined with that strange little bubble of   pride he felt when Sherlock laid out a string of deductions to Lestrade   while on a case.
"That's...  unexpectedly hot."
Sherlock   swung one impossibly long leg over John's, straddling his thighs.    John's hands automatically went to rest just above Sherlock's bony   knees.  Sherlock leaned forward and planted one hand next to John's   head, the other smoothed over John's arm.  There was a moment when they   held eye contact, and then Sherlock finally dipped his head and kissed   John.
- playing by behavioural observations alone.  It was really too much,   insult to injury.  John followed along with the hands on the  flatscreens  that hung around the room (placed so the audience could see  what was  happening at the table) with interest.  His anger began to  fade the  longer the game went on, replaced by genuine enthusiasm.
In   Afghanistan, they played for chips only because no one had much to   spare in the way of tiny luxuries and no one could be arsed to figure   out the exchange rates on paper currency.  Most patients were only there   long enough to be stabilized and shipped home or patched up and sent   back to their units, but there were always games going while soldiers   waited for transport.  John hadn't played in many of those games -- even   if the pots weren't for anything tangible, it had still felt wrong to  be  cleaning out a bunch of kids that could die any day.
Sherlock grinned, then clambered over the bed to kiss John soundly.  "I told you, I was feeling lucky."
John downed the last of his drink and signalled for another as he   contemplated how he would talk his way out of any kind of real   discussion (the kind that involved awkward admissions and the rebuff   that was sure to follow) with Sherlock.  He'd most definitely shown his   hand, and in more ways than just the abstract I-don't-want-you-to-die   way that Sherlock had, and on more than one occasion.  Flouncing off and   having a strop over Sherlock's insensitivity was nothing new, but   when combined with all the other tiny clues over time, Sherlock had   surely figured it out by then.  John was convinced that it would   only be a matter of time before Sherlock's tolerance of his mooning   ended.  John nursed the fresh drink while thinking up all the ways   Sherlock would tell him that the interest wasn't mutual, ranging from   stumbling-but-tactful to being made homeless upon his return to London.
"C'mon, C'mon," John chanted under his breath, hoping Roylott would fold.
John   had long known Sherlock didn't hold anything sacred and that he   certainly didn't respect other people's privacy.  He'd probably long-ago   deduced the depth and breadth of John's sexual experience and   assumed John amenable to playing along -- after all, it's not like a   threesome with another bloke was something John hadn't ever done.
John started again, then cleared his throat.  "Longer, actually."
Sherlock   laughed, then twisted to drop his cigarette in the abandoned plastic   cup.  Then he was back and snogging the life out of John, tasting   vaguely of tobacco and Coke.  It wasn't a very long kiss, since they   were surrounded by spectators and a camera crew and neither was fond of a   spectacle, but it held a definite promise that once the event was  over,  there would be more.
With   Sherlock's clarification, John's ardour dampened slightly.  He didn't   want to admit that he'd been half-infatuated with the man from the   moment he'd realized Sherlock had cured his limp, especially when he'd   been under the impression the feeling wasn't reciprocated.  Hell, it   might not have been until a few hours ago, which raised a whole other   set of questions and possible complications that John didn't want to   dwell on.  Being secretly in love with his flatmate for the last year   seemed like some kind of betrayal of trust, and also quite pathetic.
"Right.  Forget I said anything."  He physically drew away from John and began to back-pedal.  "I apologize, I misread-"
He   took a step forward, chasing Sherlock's withdrawal right back into the   man's personal space.  John hesitated for a split second before making  a  grab for Sherlock to prevent a further retreat.  Sherlock looked   startled, his eyes darting to where John's hand was clamped around his   wrist, then back up to John's face.  John pulled him closer to his body   and set his hand lightly on Sherlock's neck, a fair warning of what he   was about to do.  When he was met with no resistance, John tilted his   head and pushed himself upward.  He brushed a feather-light kiss over   Sherlock's lips before pulling back.  Sherlock followed John's mouth for   a second until he caught himself, his eyes snapping wide open.
John swallowed.  "You really didn't know?"
For   the next round, Sherlock made John keep the sunglasses on.  John   had always been a purist when playing - no good luck charms, no rituals,   no hats, no hoodies, no sunglasses.  Just
So   when the case that had brought them to Las Vegas in the first place  turned out to be centred on a high-stakes Texas Hold 'em  tournament,  John thought Sherlock would have finally observed  enough to realize  that it wasn't all just luck and manipulation.   They both entered the  first round (a $25k buy-in, bankrolled by the  casino; that was  only a fraction of what they'd stand to lose  if the media ever got wind  of the fact that such a high-profile game  had been thrown) with  fabricated identities to find the parties  involved.  Sherlock read a  quick primer on the basic rules of the  game and watched a few hours of  Final Table footage from a few World  Series tournaments, declining  John's offer of playing a couple practice  hands (which hurt, if John  were completely honest, as did all the  other times Sherlock had deemed  John's various skills wanting) in  preparation, and away he went.
"You'd made it quite clear that you weren't interested."
"Why me, then?"  Sherlock asked with detached curiosity, but underneath was a thin thread of something else.
Sherlock moved back to John's neck, sucking gently on the pulse point.  "How long have you been thinking about this?  Me?"
Sherlock looked down at John in wonder before his face split into a wide grin.
John let out a whoop and punched the air.  Sherlock's mouth twitched up into a tiny smile as he raked the pot toward himself.
"You're   clever, figure it out."  The words came out as more of a challenge,   albeit a quiet one, than he'd intended.  John wished he could take a   step back.  Instead, he let his hands drop from Sherlock's waist and   turned his head far enough to the side so that he didn't have to look   directly at Sherlock's face.
Sherlock   looked at him full-on, presumably reading all he needed to know from   John's reaction.  Somehow, a wire must have got crossed because after a   few seconds, he blanked his expression and cleared his throat, looking   at a fixed point over John's shoulder.
Sherlock   must have known, or his skills of deduction hadn't been dulled by  lust,  because he shifted his mouth to the sensitive spot below John's  ear and  rumbled, "You've thought about this."
By   the next break, the table was down to four players, with the short   stack sure to be knocked out in the first few hands after the game was   resumed.  Sherlock accepted a plastic cup of something from one of the   casino staff and bummed a cigarette from one of the other player's   girlfriends before sauntering up to John.
the  sunglasses  was disconcerting and felt wrong.  When combined with the  knowledge of  what everyone else was holding and that he was, himself,  cheating, John was thrown off his game.  He was the first one  eliminated from his  table.
"Wouldn't want your luck to run out, would we?" John said, then grimaced at how incredibly cheesy he sounded.
"Shame you didn't win," John said.
"You're kidding me."
"Sherlock!" John shouted.  Sherlock's head whipped around to face him.  "When Angelo showed up at the door with my cane."
Sherlock chuckled.  "I've dressed up as a woman before, more than once.  I didn't lack for attention."
Sherlock made a low noise of pleasure, then asked, "Would you ever?"
Sherlock's calf flexed and John felt the tip of Sherlock's shoe tap the sole of his foot.  Through his own shoe.
"I can show you sometime."
No wonder everyone thought they were a couple.
John laughed as he ground down against Sherlock's hip.  He bent down and claimed Sherlock's mouth again.
Minutes later, Sherlock broke away, panting.  "Shoes."
"A while," John hedged, breaking eye contact.  The mood was sufficiently ruined.
Sherlock   checked and the flop was laid down -- two of hearts, two of clubs, five   of hearts.  Roylott only needed one more heart to make a flush and  beat  Sherlock's two pair, but Sherlock still had marginally better  odds.
John,   always careful with his things, sat on the edge of the bed and untied   his shoes.  Sherlock knelt behind him, kissing the back of his neck and   running his hands over John's flanks.  John lined his shoes up   side-by-side, then peeled his socks off and stuffed them into the shoes   before sliding them under the bed.  He needed that little moment of   routine to ground himself.  John wondered why it didn't feel more   awkward, why he wasn't nervous or over-eager like he thought he should   be.
The   game was expected to last anywhere from twelve to seventeen hours,  with  breaks every three hours.  By the second break, Sherlock had  identified  the two cheaters and had systematically eliminated them by  calling one  on a bluff and forcing the other to go all-in with an  inferior hand.
John   obediently held out one arm, then shifted his weight and offered the   other for Sherlock to unbutton.  Sherlock's fingertips skated over his   wrist, then up his forearm and back down.  He removed John's shirt and   vest, then guided John to lie on the bed with another light shove to his   chest.
It   had been much the same after signing up for the RAMC, although the   officers liked to play with real money.  John had gained a bit of a   reputation by the time he'd been deployed, and the other officers had   wished him luck but said their wallets weren't sorry to see him go.
If   you were to ask Sherlock how he ended up at the final table in a   high-stakes, no-limit Texas Hold 'em tournament being filmed for   broadcast on American television, he would simply wave you off and tell   you it was for a case.  If you were to ask John, he'd tell you it was   because his flatmate was an ego-maniacal twat that would go to almost   any length to prove a point.
Betting   on races or football scores wasn't his thing.  Slots, dice games, and   roulette were all chance, no strategy and no challenge.  Blackjack was   decent, if you were into quick games.  But poker?  That was thrilling.    He'd played a bit of stud and draw with his mates in Uni, nickel-and-dime games (a term he'd only learned later), with vouchers for housework and girls' phone numbers finding   their way into the pot when things got interesting. It wasn't until he   was in Rwanda with Médecins Sans Frontières that he'd learned Texas  Hold  'em from one of the Americans in his camp.  They'd used the  contents of  care packages as stakes and, by the first month, John had  had a monopoly  on the camp's supply of gum and hand lotion.
"You've   lipstick on your chest," he said before he realized he'd opened  his  mouth.  It sounded more accusatory than a simple observation.
Sherlock was undressing when John walked into the room.  Barefoot and   bare-chested, clad only in black satin-striped tuxedo trousers, it was a bit much for John to handle after the conversation he'd had   with himself at the bar.  He headed for the en-suite, intent on  taking  a hot shower to get the scent of smoke and booze off of his skin  and  clear his head, but Sherlock was suddenly in front of him   nattering on about the case.  Any other time he'd have been paying more   attention, but he spotted a red smudge over Sherlock's  collar  bone.
John   hesitated.  Sherlock had already traced it back that far, there was no   sense in lying to him now.  He opened his mouth to contradict  Sherlock,  but didn't have the chance to say anything before Sherlock's  brow  furrowed and he resumed his pacing.
"I should have folded," Sherlock replied, practically beaming.
"You're drunk," Sherlock replied with equal parts surprise and disdain.
After   three folds on both blinds and a called bluff on a big hand, Sherlock   was the short stack.  He was so far down on chips that if he didn't win   something substantial back in the next few hands, he'd be eliminated.    On the very next hand, after a very intense round of betting, he went   all-in with pocket jacks before the flop was even laid down.  To say it   was a bold move was an understatement -- pocket jacks were arguably the   hardest hand to play.  Sherlock wasn't playing his cards though, he  was  playing the two men who hadn't folded their hands immediately.
As   predicted, the party was excruciating.  It wasn't that John minded   wearing a tuxedo or hobnobbing with a bunch of rich, beautiful people.    He could hold his own in just about any conversation, thank you very   much.  It wasn't even watching Sherlock get a lapdance from one of the   hired girls, or seeing him smoke like a chimney and pretend to throw   back expensive scotch like it was water.  It was when John overheard   Sherlock propose a threesome "with his friend" to one of the girls   (covered in tattoos and more metal in her face than what held John's   shattered shoulder together; couldn't have been older than 24, tops)   that he had just about enough.  He politely excused himself and   found the nearest bar, intent on either finding a one-night stand of  his  own or drinking until he didn't care.
was implied.
"Dim sum," Sherlock answered.
John snorted into his drink, but finished it quickly and then left   to go back to the room.  It was probably as close as Sherlock would  ever  come to acknowledging the reason for John's departure, and John  hoped that to be the end of it.
His   eyes focused on a tiny red mark where the lipstick had been the night   before, probably from a too-sharp nip of teeth.  He felt a tiny spike  of  jealousy and his jaw involuntarily tightened.
That   was a connection John had so far actively resisted making, with very   few slip-ups.  Sherlock had never once discussed sex or sexuality   (unrelated to a case) after his awkward married-to-my-work speech, nor   had John ever seen him take any kind of interest in anyone.  John was   fairly certain Sherlock was asexual.  That was fine, he'd said all fine   and meant it.  But then, to hear the offer made so casually... that stung.
Objectively,   he knew some things would change.  There would eventually have to be a   renegotiation of acceptable behaviour and new boundaries set.  They'd   have to decide upon sleeping arrangements.  Little things, here and   there, but really, they'd been living as a couple (more or less) for   over a year, so there wouldn't be any big changes for either of them.    They'd been pooling finances from the first month and arguing about   money for just as long.  The division of labour had already been squared   away.  There would have to be the exclusivity and relationship history   talks, but John was in no rush for them, as the first seemed a bit of a   moot point and the second was always a mixed bag of emotion.
The   case itself had been interesting enough.  Two security guards, a   dealer, a floorman, a Suicide Girl, a valet, and three players had been   arrested for trying to throw the tournament.  With a top prize of just   over ten mil, each would have walked away a millionaire and then some.    It had taken three days and Sherlock's advancement to the final round  of  the tournament to put all the pieces together, but by that time, he  and  John were barely on speaking terms.
John was pulled from his thoughts when his phone vibrated in his pocket with a text from Sherlock.
"Why didn't you?  Roylott plays tight, you had to have known he had a good hand."
Some   of his most epic rows with Sherlock had been over the stupidity of   gambling.  It wasn't that Sherlock cared about the money John lost   (never more than he could afford, John had learned his lesson) -- it was a   matter of principal.  Sherlock thought it was all a matter of luck  and  that the only skill involved was reading and manipulating the other   players.  More than once, John had tried to explain odds and  strategies  associated with a number of possible hands, but Sherlock  didn't seem to  care about the maths.  From there it had always devolved  into the core  issue of Sherlock's imperiousness vs. John's right to do  as he pleased  when they weren't working a case, and had usually ended  with doors being  slammed and one of them leaving the flat for an  indeterminate period of  time.
Sherlock   went all-in before the turn card, causing a low murmur to flow through   the crowd.  Since their chips had been fairly evenly matched when the   hand was dealt, Roylott would have to go all-in as well to call or be   forced to fold, which would put Sherlock well ahead in chips.
John   had always had an affinity for gambling.  Risk-taking and the rush of   coming out on top were addictive, and if there was one thing he got from   the Watson side, it was a predisposition for addiction.  The nature of   his risk-taking was tempered by the sensibility of his Mum's side, so   he'd never been inclined to try jumping from very high places as a child   or doing anything illegal as a teenager.
John   nodded.  "Alright then."  They dodged cameramen and tournament   officials and ducked out through one of the staff exits, manned by one   of the security guards who'd known of Sherlock's involvement with the   casino.
Sherlock's three of a kind had beat the other man's two pair.
Gameplay   resumed and, as predicted, the short stack was knocked out on the  first  hand.  The game progressed quickly from there, the third player  going  bust within half an hour.  It was down to Roylott and Sherlock.   Four  hands later, Sherlock was dealt another pair of pocket jacks on  the big  blind.  Roylott raised, holding the three and six of hearts.
Relatively   speaking, this incident didn't even make the top ten list of ways   Sherlock had affronted John's not-so-delicate sensibilities.  John   sat staring down into his vodka tonic and wondering, then, why he felt   like one giant, raw nerve.  Maybe the effects of Sherlock's constant   insults and denigration had finally had a cumulative effect.  That didn't seem likely to John, since he'd been brushing those things off   for well over a year now.  No, the issue was definitely centred on   Sherlock and sex.
“About you! No not that John, not the doctor, I want to know about Johnny, Little you! Tell me about yourself!” Jim leaned over and picked up a few crayons and a picture of a gorilla, selected a bright pink and started adding a very poorly drawn dinosaur eating the Gorilla’s backside.
Jim considered John for a brief moment then smiled, “Let’s talk then. Johnny, I’m curious, I'll admit, so you’ll have to indulge me for a brief moment. I’ve already called your daddy so he knows to come and get you in a bit, probably coming by cab though I don’t understand why he insists on- ah . . . anyway! Talking!” He clapped his hands excitedly, “Tell me about yourself!”
“Sherlock, sit over there, you can masturbate if you want, I’m sure Johnny will like seeing your penis doing
it watching this exhausting back and forth. You’re asexual, fine, whatever, no one here gives a shit and you can thank those shapely cheekbones, but John
John blinked then looked at Jim who stood up and held his hand out, John swallowed and his lip shook as he slowly took the hand and stood up. Jim’s hand wasn’t as small as he thought it was and it was warm as Jim led the way out of Sebastian’s room with Sherlock right behind them. Jim opened one door and they were in a spare bedroom, “Johnny, get on the bed, that’s it sweetheart, Uncle Jimmy is going to show your Daddy a few things and help you. I know it is uncomfortable to have your prince parts so tingly for so long. Mhm, that’s good.”
“John,” Jim tried a different tactic, he squatted down, taking a clean handkerchief out, this one also embroidered with ‘SH’ in one corner and he gently dabbed at John’s eyes and then his nose, “Did Sebastian purposefully hit you with his toy car? No, don’t look at him, he’s a naughty, rude boy. Look at me… there we are. Answer me, Johnny, pudding, did he do it more than once?”
“No, Johnny, if we want big boy touches, we need to use big boy words,” Jim coaxed softly, his hand shifting to gently rub John’s stomach.
“Alright, Seb, I brought you a- what’s going on?” Jim looked at the pair curiously then frowned, “Why is there blood on John’s onesie hood and lip, Seb?”
John was quiet for a moment, staring at the green crayon that was still just hovering over the page; he thought hard about it, “Four.”
and I know we talked about that but we also talked about your choice of language, and I know that ‘bugger’ is one of the no-no words that Daddy said would get you punished. Also, you left Bigsley on your bed
“I apologize for how far from the door this is, but Sebby, my little tiger, likes to keep things discreet. He’s particular like that,” Jim smiled faintly then frowned, “Oh . . . “
John’s eyes squeezed shut; it had hit him hard enough to make him see stars, and something dripped onto his lip. John blinked then reached up and brushed at it, holding his hand out to see, and it was a small bit of blood. His eyes widened at the sight and he could hear the sound of gunshots, blood was everywhere, and he was bawling. He wasn’t sure when or why he’d started crying, certainly his nose had smarted something fierce, but he’d been punched before and had broken bones. He’d been shot and fallen from high places, but he was bawling all the same, wiping the blood off his hands frantically. He only managed to smear it and his frantic motions made the blood drip onto the onesie, upsetting him further until John was panicking and trying to get the onesie off.
“Wrong.” Jim said in a very bored, put-upon tone, “Amazing, not even a full sentence and you’re already messing this up. Firstly, never ever talk about yourself in the first person, you are ‘Daddy’, Sherlock, calling yourself that solidifies the experience. Secondly have you not been paying attention? When he’s in little space, he’s ‘Johnny’, he likes being called that, it makes him feel safe and
Sebastian grumbled sulkily and undressed completely, standing fully naked and making John blush. Moran was muscular and covered in scars with a tattoo of a tiger on one shoulder; it wasn’t a snarling or angry looking tiger, it’s claws weren’t out and it wasn’t baring its fangs, it was just standing there, peering out of his shoulder as if curious. John stared openly at Sebastian below the waist too and he felt something stirring with interest, he wiggled a bit to get comfortable again and tried to go back to coloring.
Jim blinked, “But,” His voice was steady and soft, “I
“My Little Sebastian, yes,” Jim nodded, “You didn’t think I kept an actual
John shifted and squeezed his legs together as blood rushed about, he bit his lip and whined softly, shaking his head.
It took a lot but Sherlock started seeing what he was supposed to, answering in halting, confused sentences until Jim was kneeling with a hand deep in John’s onesie teasing his hole while he held a dildo in the other hand, “Here, have him lube that up. No, Sherlock put it in his mouth, feed it to him like a bottle, see if he likes that.”
“There, you see?” Jim gestured between Sebby then John, “Johnny is a good boy, Seb, why can’t you be a good boy too?”

“Ah, there you see, you have this special place with him and you’re
“Good, good . . . “ jim smiled, "are you okay enough to talk like a big boy or do you want to color more?" Jim reached over and eased the hood back over John's head, making sure his blonde hair was smoothed down.
Felt so good decided to keep going. I've decided that I would like to explore a few different things in the dynamic (possibly changing it a bit as we go). Hope you enjoy!
John’s lip shook and he popped his pacifier out and he shrugged slowly, “ . . . i . . . I want tickles from . . . from you . . . “
Jim smiled knowingly and moved up to John, “It’s alright, Johnny, Uncle Jimmy isn’t going to touch you or hurt you, come on, that’s a good
“It’s fine.” John murmured, sniffing, “It didn’t hurt that badly.”
Jim stared at John for a moment, he leaned forward and smirked, “Johnny, that’s a very naughty thing I would have to show you and you don’t want me touching your special places, remember? Your daddy-”
Sebastian blinked then looked at John, pointing at him, “Those are my pyjamas! And why does he have Patches and he’s using my crayons!”
Sherlock turned back to John and saw that the blonde had fallen asleep, his thumb wedged in his mouth. Sherlock gently cleaned John, redressed him in the pyjamas and tucked him in, “That would be fine.”
“Oh, sweetheart, why don’t you speak up? You know your daddy isn’t the most observant unless you're a corpse!” Jim sighed, “I Wish he’d let me help, I could play with you and make the tickles-”
'Are you… are you sure of this?' his voice reads neutral.
'Shut up. Well, there's that.'
He doesn't see Mary's body. He doesn't ask what happened to it, and explicitly tells MI6 this is not information he needs. The only thing he keeps is the wedding photobook, something that initially didn't even cross his mind.
'It did take a little while to heal, but-'
'I'll explain later. I'm taking John to Rosie's room. Where is she?'
what is she doing here?'

They discuss over it, John asserting how unnecessary it was to think about dating procedures in adolescence because he
big bald clumsy cat at the front.
'Sherlock Holmes. I thought John warned you I was coming for Rosie?' he refrains from saying anything else, like the fact that she had a date and was almost running late so he wasn't going to keep her. The last person John would want him to inadvertently annoy was his babysitter.
'A guy Alex owned money back then found out about me. He sent me an email, asking for me to cover the debt, now that Alex's dead. So I'll just go to Wales and deal with this. It shouldn't take long.'
'I'm sorry.' his voice breaks at the end. Both pretend not to notice.
'She's beautiful. Is her mom with you?' she looks around as if to illustrate looking for the mother. John finds quite strange how uncomfortable he is.
