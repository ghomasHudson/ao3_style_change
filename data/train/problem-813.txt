“Your not doing anything wrong just getting some air. Were going to be on the roof not jumping off of it.” And that’s all it took for John to hesitantly say ’okay’ and let Sherlock pull him into the elevator and go up. As they got closer to the top Sherlock could tell John was nervous from the way his foot was moving side to side spontaneously to the grip then release thing he was doing to the shoulders of Sherlock's shirt, he could tell he was pretty stressed out.
He got to the flat as fast as he could. John no longer lived there but John was there today. For some reason he had gone, mycroft had told him he had forgotten to listen. All he was focusing on was finally seeing his John again.
“Sherlock! Sherlock!” He heard her scream at him then practically got thrown over when she ran straight into him and hugged him.
“John makes me happy.” He settled for and she smiled knowingly. Must have been the right thing to say then.
"The only thing important to me right now is sleep!" John yelled back trying to find a comfortable position again. He was graced with silence, assuming Sherlock had given up he curled into bed once more and drifted in and out of sleep.
“That’s good to know.” John murmured quietly, they stood in the hall in silence after that. It was a comfortable silence the kind people are almost afraid to break surrounded in the peace of it. “The dark.”
Limbo wasn’t so bad at first. It was all talk he thought, creation was something he’d always enjoyed. He hadn’t been able to do it so freely in such a long time.
Sherlock groaned his arm hitting the metal door with a dull thud that echoed throughout the hallway.
No one would know how Sherlock Holmes had survived. It was okay, he didn’t mind having something private for now, he just needed John. John who was alive and here and waiting and John. Oh, John.
“Well, on tour with me. I know it’s a little ridiculous and last minute but I’m sure I could convince Nicole, that’s my manager, to bring you along. That is if you want to of course. I wouldn't want to force you-” John offered, then slightly worried he'd push Sherlock into something he didn’t want to do. Although it was Sherlock and he’d probably openly complain or deny it if he didn't want to go.
“Furious is a better word but yeah. Sherlock definitely won’t be doing that again, he’ll be too scared to.” Greg said with an amused huff as they started to walk down the hall to the elevator.
“I should be in there with him. He needs to know I’m not going to leave, that I’m not actually angry at him just the situation.” John argued still fuming from when he had been kicked out before Sherlock had even woken up.
The night before had brought a fitful sleep for the young detective his conversation with John haunted him. He never meant to snap or yell at John but he couldn’t take self deprecation. It is a stupid way to get compliments and he knew John wasn’t doing that and he genuinely believed that but Sherlock couldn’t control himself. John shouldn’t feel that way he shouldn’t have to and Sherlock shouldn’t be yelling at him but at his terrible excuse for a uncle.
"No I'm going to slide it into your arm and take some blood." Sherlock says matter of factly putting a bit on alcohol rub on his arm before sliding the needle into his skin. John hisses but other than that doesn't move although he wants to yank his hand away, he also has the odd urge to slap Sherlock.
“Yes, I want to know.” John says softly leaning against the door watching him, he didn’t know what was happening with Sherlock but he wanted to help. He was honestly shocked by everything he said and unsure what it meant.
“This is really good, though I think I’d switch this note here.” Sherlock says pointing out a note he thought would be better changed and they got started. He forgot about his conversation with Molly as they started working on this project.
“Sherlock?” Lestrade asks concerned, he never hesitates. Sherlock shakes his head as he pulls his phone from his pocket searching through it for a moment before placing it in front of them.
Sherlock sighed quietly holding him impossibly closer before shifting John to be held in his one arm while he pulled out his phone with his other hand. In the back of his mind he was sickened by the fact that he could hold his -former- blogger in just one arm as less than a month ago he could hardly pick him up.
“You never told me your name.” John says afraid that if he doesn’t ask he may never know. John watched as the man visibly deflated and came to crouch in front of him.
“BBC News. Just hit number one.” Molly pointed to the number and he quickly pressed it waiting as her slow tv buffered. “I have connections with everyone unlike you and they tell me when there are secret interviews. Your welcome.”
Just as John was about to hijack one of the cars and go home Sherlock's rapid footsteps came from the alley behind him, opposite the one he ran into. As he turned around -as did the police force- he found himself with an armful of consulting detective and soon enough a face full. It was luck that they didn't fall with John's weak leg. For some reason John couldn't fathom Sherlock had decided to practically jump into his arms grab his face and stuck his tongue down Johns throat.
“Get up Greg, come on. Please get up. Dad, please.” He pleaded sitting on his knees beside Greg’s form, tugging at his shoulders. There was guilt building in his throat that he attempted to push away. A useless battle.
Sherlock jumped out of the car as soon as it was stopped and headed inside of Baker Street, climbing the stairs two at a time and ignoring whatever it was Lestrade had said. He wasn’t focused on anything else but John and he didn’t want any interruptions, he had to do this alone.
“No time. Come on, you have to get Greg out.” There was something about the way Sherlock spoke that wasn’t right, John couldn’t quite pinpoint what it was.
"No, absolutely not. She didn't do anything when she wasn't at bars she was going around and spending money Dad and I brought in. He was working hours and hours at the hospital and I was getting any job I could get, it hardly mattered what it was. Then I got into music and got discovered. The only time she did work was when- -from what I'm told- -I was two and Harry was 6. She used to work at a motor company I think, fixing and selling anything really. I'm pretty sure Dad told her she didn't have to work, that he'd do it all."
"Where?" John asked straining his neck to look past the chair to the stairway where Sherlock was putting on his shoes.
Sherlock turned to her with a 'are you serious' look as well as a raised eyebrow. She used her puppy dog face and John joined in.
The rain fell heavily outside the trailer's windows, hail gathering to clink on the roof. A pot placed on the far left corner counter in the kitchen to collect the drips from the ceiling. Quiet dinks as the drips hit the pan the only sound in the trailer beside the intermittent noise of a newspaper page being turned.
Mycroft stood unmoving for almost fifteen minutes of silence until abruptly he cleared his throat and John almost startled. Mycroft visited about once every day generally around the same time he came to watch his brother for a generally random amount of time before departing. No words were ever spoken.
Three words the real John would never tell him. It had been years of being together and just those words broke everything. He didn’t know how to cope. Their world started crumbling, crime scenes and shops falling apart. Streets of London folding in on themselves. Just three words.
There were a lot of things John regretted in their time together and he thought about it all in the time he spent at Sherlocks bedside.
“You don’t understand.” John choked again trying to get the words out, feeling as if the emotions of someone else were flooding him. Perhaps it was the part of him that could recognize this man. “I-I can’t-“ John tried to breathe but the feeling of his throat slowly closing was taking over him. “I don’t-“
"No, we'll just get it fitted. I think this one sums up our relationship pretty well." John smiled- if possible- even brighter as Sherlock did as well and kissed him. "I love you so much."
Reaching the top of the stairs Sherlock takes a quick breath and turns the doorknob until the door clicks open and he pushes it to see the room inside. John had never looked so small, he was of course nothing older than a toddler but the big empty room in contrast to his small form made him seem smaller.
Sherlock shakes his head and changed quickly not even caring about Molly watching him then. “Tomorrow.” He says and moves back to his bed climbing into it.
"John. Wake up, it's important." John mumbled some nonsense cracking open an eye to watch him warily.
The men exited the car, the ground wet and mushy beneath their feet from rain the days before. It had taken them a long while to arrive at the building, the sun coming down to rest just at the horizon. A dream like haze lay over the whole place, fog coming up out of nowhere to cover the building like a coat.
“Tell me.” Moriarty says crouching beside Sherlock, bloodied and broken form. “How does it feel being the sacrifice.”
“Probably not, you’ll find out.” Sherlock replies absently as the door opens again. He stiffens slightly as footsteps come his way and something taps his foot.
"Oh my god! Your a popstar, How could you possibly not know what a third wheel is." She asked exasperatedly.
With a sigh, John pulled himself up to follow them into the kitchen. It would be a long and agonising night.
“I’m going to speak to your nurse and get you cleared. I believe you’ll recover faster at the flat, then I’ll tell you anything you want to know.” The man promised laying John down slowly to his back, he fell practically boneless, his eyelids seeming so heavy as a kiss was placed on his forehead.
The whole thing seemed fictional and John couldn’t put himself into the place of the man that had shot the cabbie. He couldn’t possibly ever do it, could he?
“Yes.” He grabbed Sherlock’s hands and pulled himself up and Sherlock steadied him by grabbing his waist as John held his shoulders. “Now, let's go.”
Sherlock turns his face away from John as he finishes his tale to hide a grin. John made it all far too easy.
“I didn’t know if you’d be jealous or something.” Sherlock says feeling a bit silly for thinking that way now.
His voice faded from Sherlock’s awareness as he head both he and Molly gasp in shock. He leaned back closing his eyes against the- what seems to be -incoming anxiety. He was completely shocked and had no idea what he has going to do with Johnathan Watson at the same school as he was attending. Small world indeed.
“Look he’s checking out that guys bum. He’s totally gay.” They both looked upon him, scrutinizing his gaze.
“I was busy.” Sherlock replies his smile only growing at how John couldn’t pronounce his words correctly simply raising the cuteness level. Maybe he didn’t have to correct him, he was too cute to.
He gasped, his body falling to pieces and vision blurring. He knew it wasn’t what he was thinking but it felt like his insides were falling out of him, scraping across the floor.
“I don’t see why they shouldn’t, they’d certainly get more customers. Unfortunately, I nicked it off one of the stupid doctors.”
He thought of his time here just a short amount and it seemed like a lifetime. When he met John it was like he became a different person John had a way of softening him it scared him in a way. It made him afraid of when he interacted with other people around John and he’s a totally different person then John won’t like him anymore. When he sees who he really is he’ll leave.
“What are we doing then?” He asked rubbing a hand over his face to try and push away whatever emotion was left over from his earlier outbreak, attempting to be positive for John like he was doing for him.
“He opened his eyes yesterday.” He said simply, it wasn’t a question more like a confirmation and John nodded silently, he nodded in return. “He’s moved three times since I’ve been here. There’s evidence to suggest that he's progressing from the coma.”
The W.A.Y. beeped and the screen turned on, but it was facing away so Sherlock couldn’t see what it said. From the smile on her face he was guessing it was good, John’s face relaxed as he saw her smile.
A knock from the wall the music was coming from caused both of them to stop yelling and stare. The music had stopped leaving an eerie silence in its wake till a voice broke down their stillness.
"Stop this ridiculous sentence and say what you're implying, Lestrade. I don't have tolerance for this nonsense." He ground out snapping his laptop closed to openly glare at him.
“Where did you even get this stuff anyway? I don’t think they give out cigarettes and lighters to recovering patients.”
"You're as red as those tomatoes." Sherlock muttered under his breath just loud enough for John to hear the satisfaction in his voice. Sherlock kisses John lightly on his check before spinning around to help his aunt.
After an unidentifiable amount of time his tears died down and he found himself becoming increasingly tired in the arms of this man. He wanted to stay awake to learn about him and their relationship but the rumble of his voice and the soothing smell of a man he felt he knew so well, lulled him into tranquility. He felt himself dozing until the man's voice strong and confident brought him back.
The ground was a bit dewy in the early hours of the morning, a sun coming up somewhere in the distance, just enough to light the sky without the sun coming up over the horizon yet. Basking the area in a soft blue around him. Mornings were a fascinating thing that Sherlock had always associated with a sense of calm and the ordeal had made him lose his taste in it.
"You're going to fix me then?" John asked quietly looking up to him after a few moments of silence. Sherlock glances at him before looking back to the fireplace.
“Mr Holmes?” The male doctor repeats for the third time starting to get annoyed with this situation.
He wishes he could stay but Molly would throw a fit and John wanted to take it slow so sleeping in his bed with him without his permission probably wasn’t a good place to start. As much as he wanted to go slow and have that experience, another part of him just wanted to go as fast as they possibly could before they burned out and got tired of each other. Sherlock couldn’t tire of John but he wasn’t sure about John’s preferences, then again he knew he had a few trust issues so that probably wasn’t helping his thoughts on the matter.
"You're interesting." Sherlock tells him simply and John seems unsatisfied turning back forward with a huff. "I have nothing to fix about you, I was merely going to remove this." He explains tapping Johns forearm lightly.
"Moriarty, the criminal we were facing. He kidnapped you that's how you got your amnesia, he must have done this in that time as well." He said as if the admittance pained him. John still didn't understand what their relationship was but he assumed it was very close by the way he was acting.
They were at the rugby tryouts now. John was trying out and completely owning the sport. He was definitely getting in, and looking amazing doing it.
"John." He calls wanting to make sure that by some strange turn of events that he couldn't speak. John looks up at him questionably with a bit of attitude it seemed as well, as if Sherlock was bothering him. Going into younger teenage years then, definitely.
“Give me a month to find a cure and if I can’t you can take him and do so yourself.” Sherlock says albeit reluctantly not liking the idea of leaving John at all right now in this state but he had to at least guarantee this.
“Baker Street.” Sherlock replied coolly and rested back in his seat clearly not in the mood for talking and Greg didn’t blame him. He simply pulled the car out of the area and started going back towards Baker Street.
"How do you mean?" John asks absentmindedly not really paying attention to the conversation as he starts cutting the carrots. He wonders if he could pull Sherlock out of the house forcefully or if Sherlock was stronger.
"I mean c'mon John, I walk in on 'that' and it raises questions especially after the Landers case. You can't blame me with the evidence that's been put in front of me." Lestrade defended putting his hands up.
The file was morbid in every sense of the word. The uncle's remains and John's wounds all recorded inside. Sherlock instantly switched into detective mode picking out the details although hard in pictures. He ignored the faces trying to block out his feelings like he's always done before with other cases but this was John. No matter how hard he tried he could still see John's face become angry of his wounds and sympathetic to what he had witnessed. There wasn't much of importance or at least not that Sherlock could pick out at this moment too overwhelmed by emotions. He threw the file to the ground his stomach turning.
Every jagged breath from Sherlock gave John just a little bit more hope as he tried to tend to his wounds. The knife still in Sherlocks leg was the worst of them but John knew better than to remove it without having anything to bandage it with. The knife was thankfully relatively small and with that small good thing John hope it didn’t hit anything important.
"What..?" Sherlock gets ready to insult him for interrupting his thoughts when John points to his arm. Sherlock goes quiet at the sight taking John's hand and wrist into his hands to assess the blinking. "When did this start?"
A newly formed relationship filled with feather light touches, uncertain smiles and fleeting glances. Sherlock always thought the prospect to be silly and if you liked someone to just say it. Then again he never thought he would meet someone who he could do those things with.
The air was warm a soft breeze blew over him as he rested. His eyes closed he savored the softness of his surroundings the ruffling of leaves could be heard in a soothing manner. Not a sound but those of nature around him as the scene unfolds slowly.
With John’s hand in Sherlock’s own they trudged through the streets of London. John was practically jogging behind Sherlock as his long strides ate up the pavement.
They spent years together, in the comforts of Baker Street. It wasn’t so bad. John loved it here, they were together and everything went as they wanted. He could live like this in a place he wanted to be.
"Piss off." Sherlock cracked a smile looking to John and they both broke out into a fit of giggles. It was undignified and silly but Sherlock didn't really care. After they had calmed down the laughing and high pitched giggles John stood.
Sherlock had to make sure there weren’t many people in the halls to put his plans into action. He slipped out and walked over towards the elevator nodding at the random passerbyers. His bare feet hit the ground with a light smacking noise filling the quiet halls. The sound of the nurses cane around the corner so Sherlock quickly found a wall to hide behind. Sure enough Mrs Hudson and Mrs Carson were among them talking profusely, one look from them and he’d be sent back.
“Alright.” Sherlock gathered his things in one hand and reached out and grasped John’s with his other and was pulled up. They headed back to the dorms in quiet just listening to their surroundings.
“Nine minutes.” He replied dancing on the edge of a box on the very tips of his nice dress shoes. Well they had been nice anyway.
“It was nothing.” John smiled anyway he looked like he was going to say more but Mrs Carson came in with that helmet looking thing again and John’s face dropped. His eyes went back to that vacant state.
“Sebastian..” John whispered unable to look away from the sight in front of his eyes. It didn’t make any sense and his head was in a whirlwind.
"No offense or anything Sherlock but you never do anything nice." A bitter laugh came from Sherlock and John studied his expression in more depth.
“Greg. Come on, get up.” John called tapping Greg’s cheek and checking his pulse. He had to get him out of this room and away from whatever was in the air. His pulse was slow, so slow he had a hard time finding it.
Bleeding out and waiting for his feet to fall out from beneath him and hang to his death. The bleeding really was getting to him now, his head was all fuzzy and he knew it would only get worse from here. Fate was a cruel thing after all wasn’t it.
Sherlock looked back to the wardrobe, their wardrobe filled with John’s clothes as well as his own. Mixed together like they used to be, one being instead of two separate entities. He trails his fingers gently over John’s jumpers that hung beside his suit jackets. They were opposites and yet so similar in so many ways, he smiles at the thought, missing the way the clicked together so flawlessly and yet could argue like fire and ice were clashing together.
"We?" John asked probably a little too hopefully. Sherlock's argument died in his mouth when he realized what he had just said.
The sound of papers ruffling echoed through the dark building, the only break from darkness the cloudy sky light above, opened just a crack. Shaky fingers marked with stains of various substances flitted through files and documents. Dark eyes gleamed in the dim light.
“Close enough. And his -unfortunate- boyfriend, my brother Mycroft.” Sherlock says motioning again to Mycroft.
Perhaps one of those has been permitted with the sound of flatlining. Perhaps they wouldn’t bring him out of his darkness where the memories and thoughts are gone. Perhaps he would be allowed to succumb to the peace, to the sound of silence.
When Sherlock opens his eyes again it’s about an hour later the sun just starting to set, orange light filling the room from the window. He must have fallen asleep at some point but looking to John he’s relieved to see he looks the same as before still cuddled up to his chest.
It was light outside now, the sun having just come up in the early hours. It lit the whole rehabilitation park in the back of the hospital, bringing- quite literally -a new light to the crime scene.
“I-” Sherlock cut him off, he was almost glad Sherlock had cut him off, he didn’t know what he’d say.
He’d sit with headphones on, music up all the way still able to hear the noises through the thin walls.  Feeling utterly and helplessly alone.
John sat up blurry eyed and leaned against his chair which was still across from the fireplace. He rubbed his eyes in an attempt to wake up but just found himself nodding off on the chair. He needed tea but it was so far away.
“He’s such an idiot. I don’t care what he says or what reason he comes up with. I’m going to stay angry, I’m done being the girl in this relationship.” Greg huffed out a laugh as they looked through the Sherlock’s room window. Greg still had to hold John up his legs refusing to cooperate with his firm attitude, telling Greg he wasn’t as angry as he let on.
“Whatever shhh.” Molly never took his rudeness personal thankfully and just laughed slightly. They both sat down and leaned it as the television whired on.
"Well, sexually." She says frankly putting sauce on pasta strips over a layer of ricotta. John swears he almost cut his finger off. Sherlock says he's exaggerating.
I’m back! Fully functional and ready to work. I hope you have enjoyed the story so far and have stuck around through the break I had to take. Finally though I’m back and I hope you enjoy this long overdue chapter.
Sherlock paces in the living room back and forth, back and forth, wearing the carpet thin. He fiddles with his phone idly flipping it between his hands.
Sherlock parked and got out of the car, the power plant was silent- dead silent in a way that was a bit too literal. His mind remarked on the very ‘not good’ bit of his thoughts but he ignored it for now a small pain pulsing around the chest area that he refused to identify. He gingerly stepped around the neat pile of corpses piled at the front gate, they had been there a good few days judging just by the smell.
“You know I’ve been thinking.” John said as he dangled from a tree Sherlock was sitting under. It was cold and snow was everywhere and each time John moved on his branch it caused snow to fall on Sherlock and his homework. It was annoying, to say the least.
That's when he found a few more pieces they had fallen to the floor in his haste to put the puzzle together. They had been hiding for so long they were a bit misshapen and warped from their time on the floor.
It was cold and suddenly the lights got very bright, very quickly. His eyes burned with the sudden change and he blinked quickly, a sort of ringing filling his ears shortly after something powering up in the distance he couldn't see. He turned sharply as he heard a voice, although his senses were impaired he knew who it was immediately.
“It’s hard to when your in pain.” Sherlock snapped then took three more steps and sighed dramatically. “I am happy and thankful that you are helping me Myc, but your not making it any easier.”
"Yes, time can only tell what they'll do. I don't believe Sherlock will be telling us. But perhaps John will talk to you if Sherlock tells him anything." Mycroft suggested as they hit the pavement his ever present umbrella swinging beside him.
He opened the door and stopped through, looking around. It was so familiar, dusty and old but familiar and so wonderful to be around.
“I have this great song idea but I need your help.” John says happily and takes Sherlocks am with his free hand pulling him down the corridor.
"Always a pleasure." Even through the phone he sounded smuggly proud of himself and it made Sherlock want to throw his phone at the wall. He hung up without another word and dropped his phone back into his pocket.
Something in John's chest did a flip and for a moment he felt he was dreaming, he blinked twice and discreetly pinched his arm. Pain. “Have you talked to the doctors?”
“Sleep, John.” The man says, his voice is deep and soothing with a slightly commanding tone. His voice is smooth when he says his name unlike when he first heard it, it was harsh and afraid. Now all that was contained and left the most calming presence that John couldn’t ignore. He found himself obeying as if trained to do what the voice told him and slowly his eyes fell shut and he was asleep once more.
“But.. why?” John asked his features falling quickly from mild confusion to something quite deep and dark.
For the next hour or so the two busied themselves with making pancakes and as many different things as they could create with eggs. Really Sherlock did the work while John ran around finding things for him to use and cook with, making a sort of challenge out of it. They spent their time well although in the end they only really ended up eating half of the things they made and sent the rest down to Mrs Hudson, even though there was underlining of sadness to it, the two did their best to forget about what was in front of them and almost succeeded when one of Mycroft's men knocked on the door downstairs. The both of them lapsed into silence as Sherlock went over to talk to the man, they had five minutes to get themselves together before John had to go.
I’ve been gone a while oop- sorry. Lost motivation for a while but I’m back into it! I’ve upped the chapter thing because I don’t know exactly when this will finish chapter wise but it definitely won’t be twenty.
“Yes, I’m fine. I’m really sorry Sherlock I didn’t mean to, I swear I only looked away for a second and it just happened.” John rambled nervously, twisting the towel he had been using to waft out the fumes between his hands.
“Then help me too, alright.” John said his anger slowly evaporating into concern for Sherlock. He sat beside him pulling his legs up onto the bed turning to Sherlock. “I want to know.”
"And that's supposed to mean?" Lestrade asked exasperated already used to Sherlock's antics, John just seemed captivated.
“Stay here.” Greg made some noise, propped up against the brick walls of the old building as John dashed back inside. He was insane, he had to be. He saw Sherlock, felt him against him the warmth of his chest still ghosting over his back as he sprinted through the building.
A broken scream ripped him from his tranquil state. He instantly recognized it as John's own broken voice crying out. Sherlock got up quickly his insides lurching in protest as he ripped his IV from his arm. He stumbled a bit as he made his way out of his room to see John down the hallway crumpled on the floor against the wall.
The man suddenly snaps his eyes open and the happiness in them rips John apart inside and suddenly he feels the need to cry. He quickly placed his feet to the floor and moves forward in his chair. The man with curly black hair and eyes John can only describe as twilight, squeezes their hands together and places his lips upon John's hand that’s on top. He lays his head against John’s hip breathing him in.
Something scuffled in the distance increasing Sherlock’s already rising unease of the area and soon enough the tracker was blinking erratically in his hand as he came up to one of the storage units. The doors were already opened, not that it mattered because half of the metal shell had already seemed to be ripped apart. Bad weather and years of rust having taken off the back end easily.
Sherlock's voice rushed through his head and John's own jerked in a brief nod of agreement on that note. Work was fine, he could work and forget about everything else. That Sherlock was missing and injured and John was in the hospital waiting for his Dad to be stabilized after pulling him into danger. It was better to forget the ache in his chest and wetness of his eyes and to instead focus on anything else really, the floor, the ceiling, Sherlock sitting across from him, Mycroft beside him, the bustle of the hospital outside the waiting room, the sniffling of the women beside Sherlock.
“You’ll get out soon, both of you. This was a setback but it will make you stronger.” Greg affirmed for him as he sat, Johns legs on his lap massaging them to try and get the muscles to stimulate into working correctly.
He moved slowly into the kitchen taking in the mess he’d neglected to clean up in the first place, both from his cooking adventure with John to his accidental explosion beforehand. He carefully picked through the mess for the important bits he'd need or want to keep and set them aside before getting some strong cleaner and cleaning the entire area.
“Yes you do. Come on, tell me.” Molly tries to get it out of him, moving to sit on the edge of his bed just to keep the conversation going. “I won’t judge you or anything you know, just tell me.”
Sherlock was just a ball of energy apparently. He wouldn't shut up and John just wanted to go to sleep. Apparently that was too much to ask.
“John!” Sherlock called grabbing John’s arm and pulling him away from the stove before getting a towel and smothering the small flame and charred food. After the fire was put out he placed the pan in the sink and opened the windows to air the place out before coming back to John. “Are you okay?”
Five of them. Each with their own challenges and risks to force Sherlock to think and work harder to get what he wanted and beat the mad game. In the end he wondered if Sherlock was stumped, if he didn’t know what to do sometimes or if he couldn’t follow this but then at the same time he hoped that he could because no one else could.
The next morning he got up, early before the sun rose to avoid being caught by Mycroft and left alone to find Sherlock. Well not alone exactly, he had his lingering memory of Sherlock following him around like a dark ghost reminding him of what he’d lost in the first place.
"What..?" John was taken aback by the sudden change of subject. Sherlock was truly a whirlwind and could go from one thing to the next in an instant his mind thinking far too fast for lengthy conversation. He was a wonder in John's mind something to be praised and glorified, brilliant in every aspect but social norms. But who ever liked normal.
“Hey, wait.” Lestrade says coming to stand beside him and speaking in a hushed tone. “I was thinking more on the lines of you staying with him.”
The world seems to be spinning as if in a washing machine. Round and round it goes. Slowly but surely pulling itself apart. Pulling thread by thread until it comes unraveled, taking all the information he knew with it.
John nodded enthusiastically choking out a yes past his tears and blinding smile. Sherlock slipped the metal around his finger and kissed him breathless and hugged him softly. John laughed slightly as he looked at the ring of metal around his finger over Sherlock's shoulder.
“Sherlock.. no, no.” John said in horror under his breath as he drops to his knees beside him not able to hold himself up, landing right into the pool of blood that starts to flow from Sherlocks wounds.
“What about Jim? If this is about you not liking him..” Molly says in a ‘not again’ type of tone as she rolls her eyes and sits on her bed.
"What happened?" Sherlock asked quietly into the silence. John laughed bitterly that turned into a sigh as he pushed off the wall coming to sit across from Sherlock.
"Yes that's because you starve yourself and then scarf down those pills, which are not actually doing anything but slowly shutting you down." Sherlock jumped up from his bed and grabbed his coat and scarf. "If you intend to poison yourself Molly don't do it around me, it's rather addictive and I like to get hooked." He slammed the door shut on a very confused Molly.
He wasn’t entirely sure what had happened but one moment he was standing there, Moriarty in front of him and Sherlock telling him it would be okay. Him, the man practically hanging in front of him was telling him that it would be okay when he was the one with both his feet on the ground not Sherlock.
"I have and I don't care." He pounded on the door again with his fists. "Come on, John! It's important!" He quite literally whined.
“Well yes, but I don’t know if I’m supposed to tell you yet.” Sherlock says his excitement tainted with nervousness, he hadn’t actually asked John if he wanted to tell people and he didn’t want to betray his trust.
"Torch?" Greg asked in a whisper turning to the two boys still waiting outside. John steps inside -followed by Sherlock-  having brought a small pocket sized torch in case.
Greg gasped, coughing and convulsing in a desperate attempt to bring in the forever fleeting air. Aching to have clean air. Whatever had been pumped into the room with mysterious puffs of steam was slowly taking away the air he had, some sort of poison or sedative. He couldn’t think very well to know for sure.
Sherlock's hands were on his hips and Johns were around Sherlock's neck and in his hair, completely immersed in the feeling of his lips. Later John would blame it on the hysteria but in that moment he couldn't stop himself. There wasn't a fight for dominance John was far too tired for anything but to admit to Sherlock's talented tongue. When they parted Sherlock laid his forehead on John's own, they were both breathing heavily -from running and also kissing- their breaths mingling in the rain dripping down from the platform above them. John's arms fell to Sherlock's chest holding onto his wet coat with freezing fingers, they were both starting to shiver.
“I said I’m fine.” He snapped and she left him alone, he closed his eyes to think. Sherlock was angry, angry at himself. He was such an idiot for doing that. Doing that to John. This was supposed to be a start, a new start he wasn’t supposed to be going back to old habits.
“Wait so you’re doing one?” Molly asked sitting up excitedly any notion that she was previously tired out the window.
“I can see things other people can’t. You could give me the before and after of an event and I could be able to tell what happened in between.”
Settling down, he’d grieve. It would last the whole night and weeks, months afterward. When John came he’d ignore his existence, he’d be a lifeless shell of person, spirit lost to a teenager he loved more than life itself. He’d take out his anger on everyone else while trying to avoid his fathers wrath.
Finally, in the dark of the night, hours later it led him to a warehouse. Or at least what remained of a warehouse, most of the structure still intact with some holes in the frame and rusty edges. It stood among a graveyard of other storage units and storage compartments of the like.
The room was large and open, a gymnasium of the school it seemed. There were papers hanging from strings in the middle, moonlight shone through the single skylight above as it illuminated the area.
Moriarty came closer and tapped the box with his foot Sherlock was balancing on with careful precision, the box was on its side, his feet on the edges of it. Any wrong move and the box would fold in on itself or he could slip into it, to which his feet would not reach the ground before a noose would be cutting off his oxygen. He shifted to accommodate but the cheap cardboard box still crumpled slightly under him, the rope pressed into his neck.
"The yard. Blubbering idiots need me to identify one of the thugs from last night. I don't know why they can't just follow my description. Idiots the lot of them." Sherlock grumbled grabbing his scarf and arranging it oh his neck. "I managed to get you out of it and It shouldn't take more than an hour."
“Please do take the opportunity.” He pushed a harsh breath out from his nose and glanced around. He decided he hated this hospital, he’d met John here and that had been about the only good that had come of it. The carving was about his ankle cuts in the tree to which he knew what it read already, it hadn’t been long since there was someone else in this tree. Hanging from this tree as he now was. “I’ll take notes of the aftermath for you.”
"I don't know what to tell you Sherlock. He's just a regular guy like you and me." Lestrade said as he sipped coffee, sitting at his desk.
He used the bathroom and washed his hands then his face but when he looked into the mirror the face looking back wasn't the same as the last time he looked. As little as John could remember he knew what his own face looked like and this wasn’t it.
He stepped around a few piles of rubble and into the shell, he covered his mouth and nose with his sleeve as dust assaulted him from years of unsettlement. In the center of the small broken area lay a pristine white pedestal in stark contrast to the junk yard around it. The light seemed to illuminate it in an almost heavenly way that churned Sherlock’s stomach as he stared at what it held.
"I'm not stopping you. I'm coming with you." Greg said matter of factly and opened the door of his car for them. "Now get in."
“Sorry, Sherlock.” John said as he plopped down beside him in the small clearing of grass far away from the snow around them. “I’m serious though, I’ve been thinking about what happens at Christmas break. It's November now you know it's only a matter of time before we have to go home again. Well you’ll probably go home I’ll be all around the world like some kind of piece of work to show off.” John grumbled as he picked at his thin winter gloves.
“I’m so sorry, John.” Sherlock whispered softly, holding John close to his chest. Apologizing for everything, for not being able to protect him and for losing him once again.
“I’m serious I’ll be fine. Plus I’ve got Sherlock.” They smiled at each other for a moment before looking back to see she had a smug look on her face.
“Hmm, I’m sure.” Sherlock said completely uninterested and just wanting to fall asleep. In the back of his head he though of when John called him brilliant and his cheeks warmed slightly. He plastered on a scowl that soon turned real.
"Thank you, truly." Mrs Hudson knew the importance of Sherlocks 'thank yous' as they were few and far in between even just having a conversation was usually cut short from his proclamations of 'boring'. His interest in John however odd and very un-Sherlock it was refreshing to see him caring for someone else. To actually sympathize with someone else's heartbreak was new to anyone who knew him and Mrs Hudson knew that and was mindful as such. She knew not to tell or ask as it could mess with this curious interest, so she would watch and wait to see what would become of it from afar.
“Untested.” He admitted and another breath filled his lungs slowly, the rope scratched at his neck and the box tilted slightly to the left on the uneven ground, he had to force himself not to panic.
"It's supposed to mean anyone with clues has conveniently forgotten is dead or missing. This person who ever they are they're smart covered their tracks yet flaunted it so beautifully, an artist more like a graffiti artist specifically. Spreading the paint leaving the masterpiece yet never signing the work. Ingenious."
When he moved in with John, when he became attached to John, he’d stolen his dogtags and knew immediately they would be his totem. For nothing else would ever be as strong to him as those are. They pained him now to have and he did feel some gully for stealing them from John but they were necessary.
“Hey.” He said to get Johns attention, it worked as he quickly lifted his head to meet Sherlock’s eyes. “Nothing bad is going to happen, I’ll make sure of it. It’s just you and me.”
"Do you really think I'd stick around if I thought you weren't treating me right. Yeah you can be an arse but so can I. We all have our days, you  sometimes more than mine but your who you are. I like who you are. Why do you think I'm still here?" John took a breath and laid his hand on Sherlock's own. "I like you for you, not for your ability to act Sherlock. I don't care how much of an arse you are as long as your not putting up a front and just being you. You don't have to apologize because you didn't do anything wrong. I stay because I want to and nothing you do will make be leave so get that out of your head." John rounded the table and held out his arms although he was starting to hide it Sherlock looked ready to burst into tears. "Now come and hug me you git."
“I don’t know if I’ll have so much help after this.” Sherlock choked out past tears that threatened to fall. His mind was poisoning him conjuring up any and every scenario that could happen when he meets with John again. Most of them being of John and Lestrade leaving him one way or another. Mycroft watched it play out on his face, practically desperate to help he leaned forward.
“Did it work?” Sherlock asked sitting up somewhat and regretting it with a light groan laying back down again, momentarily forgetting about the ribs.
“Still afraid of me.” James grinned his shining canine teeth visible in the dark room, shaking John to his core.
“Not necessarily, on Moriarty’s orders any one of his followers could have done this.” Mycroft says thoughtfully also examining the board but coming to stand with Sherlock, Lestrade following shortly.
“Oh nothing to worry about. It’s just the W.A.Y. It’s an acronym you see stands for Wave Assessor Yellow, its yellow because of the small piece of tape on the back we have a few so it's easier to keep track by color. We also have W.A.R.,W.A.G. and W.A.P. We make sure to give John W.A.Y. everytime.” John cracks a small smile, before going back to concentrating. ”It's a simple device really but very effective for specific cases, it asses brain waves and so with John we can guess how his body will react through out almost the whole day. All John has to do is concentrate on one thing and it buzzes to life.”
"Watson. But it's best not to dwell on it dear, perhaps he just needs time." She says patting his arm and getting ready to stand, he grabs her wrist as she does so. She jumps a bit looking taken aback at contact from him.
It had been three months since the case of Johns absent mother. A report of the incident and a small hint at where the gang would be was given to the police. ‘El Toro De Fuego’ was dismantled in a night, sixty-seven men and women were found and put up for trial, fifty-three were placed in jail and ten went to the hospitals proven to be hostages. Unfortunately Johns mother was among the jail group.
Sherlock took John's coat that he'd grabbed on their way out and helped him to put it on, there wasn't much to be said, although they both felt that they should. After he got his coat on and there was nothing else to do Sherlock was the one to break the silence.
John went to stand up not wanting to give up on finding Sherlock himself and getting to him before something happened. Before it was too late. He’d already failed him, having let him come here and gotten hurt, he wished there was some way to turn back time and fix this.
“No but Mycroft showed me pictures and told me stories. He sounded like a right terror to me. I saw him once on graduation but I didn’t meet him officially until I became a detective lieutenant. Christ he was an arse.” They both laughed the mood lighter now. When the laughter died down John became sollom.
He didn’t reply, he never had to. Not out loud, not in his head, Sherlock just spoke and he listened and occasionally basked in the feeling of a sliver of his presence. That didn’t help either, pretending he was there when he was just a figment of his imagination, this Sherlock didn’t compare to his own. He wasn’t living. Not just in the physical sense but he had no passion or emotion, at times he’d say things that seemed like they should but there was never anything behind it.
“Shewock?” John says looking up at Sherlock and crawling closer to him. Sherlock shakes his head slightly to disband his thoughts and takes John’s hands to steady him as he stands. He needs to stop thinking of the past and focus on John here and now.
She was a kind woman and John had found himself leaning into her motherly nature easily. She was someone Sherlock trusted entirely and that overflowed easily into John’s subconscious. Clinging to every piece of Sherlock he could find left in the world.
Hanging a woman with long blond hair and blue eyes. Hanging by her neck arms pinned to the tree like on a cross. The saying was ‘your past will come back to haunt you’ and that has never been more true.
“You know you could be a little nicer to him. He’s just trying to help.” Molly said quietly from where she was putting away her clothes by the dresser. Always trying to be the peacemaker.
“Uh huh, I’m so sure.” John grinned and pulled him down into a kiss. “You’re so bloody tall.” He complained without any heat as they broke apart once more.
“We’re going to John you should be happy.” Mycroft knew -used to Sherlock’s antics- that getting him riled up would only push his drive to move. And using John’s name helped as well.
“He did.” Moriarty snaps protective of Sebastian's memory and not allowing it to be tarnished by someone who knew nothing. “You wouldn’t know.”
“I don’t care Mummy. I need to go now.” Sherlock complained as his mother continued to baby him and everything he was doing. “I’ll be fine if I need anything I will call or just get Mycroft to do it.”
It was hard as it was just watching Sherlock go through the pain of losing John and having to deal with the responsibility of bringing him back. He hid it all so well even now but Greg could see through the disguise he put up, he could see how much pain he was in even if just a glimpse of it he could see it and tried not to pity him for it. That was the last thing Sherlock wanted from him.
"Our date." John shot up looking at Sherlock in disbelief. It had only been a day well really just a night John had expected Sherlock to take a while to be able to 'figure it out' he said.
“Sherlock.” John called again with a smile adorning his lips as he took Sherlocks hands in his own, gently moving his fingers over his pale knuckles.
“I can’t believe you.. You didn’t spare me the pain, so why should I give you the satisfaction?” John pointed it right at his head.
"Mrs Hudson, lovely to see you again." He said as she entered, she had been his rock years ago when he first fell into drugs, surely his brother was predicting the same outcome again. She was a kind women by fault and was a marvel for even putting up with him in the first place, the other nurses called her a saint, he was inclined to agree.
“I’m so sorry, I’m sorry.” John whispered roughly as his throat closes his up not wanting to believe the sight in front of him. His hands hovering over his body uselessly in shock not able to comprehend.
"Worse! It wouldn't matter! There are far too many!" Sherlock yelled back, turning back to look at him and almost hitting a trash bin in the process. "Up!"
In the wake of happiness John softly placed his lips to Sherlock's own. Testing the water so to speak. Sherlock reacted immediately practically throwing himself at John crushing their lips together in a heated kiss. John gasped as he fell backwards because of Sherlock, who took the liberty of sticking his tongue down John's throat. Sherlock ignored the pain in his abdomen in favor of leaving John breathless. The light and feathery kiss turned into a full on snogging session and a fight for dominance. In which Sherlock won.
He needed to finish the puzzle. How important was the box with a lock to not open. It mustn't be very important if he wasn't supposed to open it.
A loud clatter echoed down from the hallway and the two men at the entrance two men suddenly frozen, an insult on their lips. A single word passed between their eyes in panic before they turned to the hall and ran as fast as they could through it. Argument forgotten in their haste.
Sherlock made his way to his room searching around for something to break into John's room with. He didn't bring many things thinking he'd have broken out by now so he didn't have his lock picking kit. Eventually he found two pens and brought them over.
A few hours later they were in a cab on their way to the flat. Home, Sherlock kept saying though John could only think of it as ‘the flat’. John sat uncomfortably stiff and slightly drugged up with what the hospital gave him. He could already feel fatigue falling over him.
Sherlock emerged with a gasp sitting up quickly and shaking off the corners of the dream, he pulled the needle out of his arm and his partner pulled the one out of their subject and together they left the building.
“It wasn’t a date.” He mumbled into his pillow before propping himself up on his elbows, changing the topic quickly. “I should be asking you that. How was.. I want to say Jacob?”
Blood was all over the floor, so much, it pooled and streaked across the floor. Like Sherlock had been cut open and dragged like some sort of animal, John felt sick but what sickened him most was that Sherlock was nowhere to be found. Just blood.
"I don't care what his name is and how is that magazine helping with your figure Molly? You haven't lost any weight at all."
For those reasons and many others he had yet to bring a true thought to, he was driving as quickly as possible to pick Sherlock up and assess the situation. All he knew was that by the time John was a few miles away from Baker Street the CCTV had disabled in that surrounding area as had the tracking device of the car, Sherlock had gotten John's location and was there before anyone else. All he had said was that the car was stopped in the middle of the road and no one was inside.
“I don’t see why it matters to you so much.” The second it came out of his mouth he wished he didn’t say it. He figured it showed on his face because Lestrade didn’t scream at him then leave. He just closed his eyes took a deep breath then moved the briefcase to the floor and sat beside Sherlock his eyes focused on the door.
Sherlock turns in his chair to level John with an ‘are you an idiot’ glare and John shrunk in on himself.
John looked blankly at him then to Mycroft and nodded slightly his eyes moving to the ground. Sherlock swallowed thickly as Mycroft came and sat beside John, a silent assurance. He quickly pulled himself together and walked over to Greg ready to be a detective.
John stood up and got into the ambulance as he was ushered inside, the doors closed and the vehicle started driving off. A paramedic puttered around him as he sat in one of the seats off to the side, closer to the back. Sherlock had left when he got inside, he was busy, John didn’t blame him for leaving him with Greg. It helped him to focus on what he needed to and to answer the paramedics questions as well as he could.
“I used to help you work. Remember? Just you and me against the rest of the world..” John looked up at him and Sherlock noticed his skull on the mantle the wallpaper change that of the one of Baker Street. No, not now.
“What are you doing?” John asked, his small voice seeming so loud suddenly, his courage dying as James looked pleased to his newly found voice.
John took a steadying breath trying to forget the thing his mind was coming up with. It only made him think about it more. Demons, ghosts and other ridiculous things flashed but murderers and assassins were far more likely. Even though that seemed more ridiculous.
“Alright, come on!” John says exitedly and drops his stuff findings paper and pencil and quickly start writing out what was in his head. Sherlock watches from over Johns shoulder as he writes out a song lyrics and even a few starter notes were there already. “How’s this?” He asks handing it to Sherlock and watching nervously as he read it over.
The picture was of the two kissing by a lake, a domestic scene that seemed far too strange to Sherlock from what John had said about Moriarty.
They had been on a case and John was going to take it to get the glass fixed afterwards but ended up dropping it, breaking the chain and the outer shell. He was devastated as the watch had been in his family for years.
Oh god. Was he her boyfriend? While he would be thrilled for her he’d be crushed, completely and utterly crushed. He wouldn’t be able to say anything against it just play along as if it’s fine. He could picture it all in his head. Going to their wedding probably being forced to be best man and make a speech and suffer to make her happy. He’d be the first to hear of her pregnancy then had to be there for the birth. Babysit while Johns on tour. Help host events, parties and fall into a deep dark pit of loneliness and boredom and constant state of hatred and envy at his best friend.
“Don’t worry, I don’t plan on it.” John assures with a small smile, fiddling with his fingers idly. “It was a bit wrong of me though, I kinda wanted them to be you..” He admits quietly his light smile turning to a frown.
There was something he was forgetting, something very, very important that lost meaning as quickly as it came when John was hurt. The pips. The bloody pips. He should have been paying attention, he should have known not to get distracted by personal matters. Things that could very well be easily taken away now that he hadn’t done this correctly.
When a choked out cry comes from upstairs Sherlock is up immediately heading towards the stairs. He runs up them quickly and enters John's room going to his bed. John's tangled in the sheets and struggling around while crying out.
"Absolutely. It was extraordinary. The police have been on that case for years and you just cracked it open in less than an hour." John replied in admiration.
“Yeah we were in different schools but they had the same campus. He was a bit like Sherlock actually, at the time helping the police out with mysterious cases and things. Anyway, I hadn’t actually met him yet but at the end of one term the day before we were to switch flatmates I remember I went to a party with my friend. There was all kinds of crap there ranging from alcohol to hard core drugs I never drank or took a thing knowing getting caught like that would destroy my future career as a cop. We were leaving so I drove and my friend was shaking I didn’t realize in time and he started to have a seizure in the car and I was freaking out and pulled over to try to figure out what was wrong while calling the police. When suddenly he went still and foam started coming out of his mouth, he died that night in my arms on the side of the road.” Greg took a moment to collect himself. John listened in half fascination and half sadness for his basically parent to have to go through that. “Then the police got there, they somehow thought I had poisoned him and I got framed for his murder. That’s when Mycroft showed up deduced the whole ruddy thing and got into his car and drove away. I was released and the killer was caught. I was astonished honestly underneath the grief and the police brought back to
“Because John-“ Sherlock replies exasperated coming closer to him and grabbing his shoulders. “-I like you.”
“A building blew up around you. You’re lucky to still have a head.” Mycroft sighed some and shook his head.
What he didn’t expect was the buzz on his radio that a firetruck had arrived on scene of the location. Sherlock had not told him anything of a fire and he was starting to get worried what else he hadn't told him about.
“Come on, let’s get a move on.” John looked hesitant and he slid his bare feet to the floor turning towards Sherlock but still not taking the offered hands. “What is it?”
“What was that..?” John whispered his breathing increasing in fear, anger forgotten entirely he reaches over and takes Sherlock’s hand.
His room was covered in boxes but he want even looking at that. He was watching John and automatically his mind came up with what he was searching for before Sherlock even registered it. He was holding Johns dogtags on his fingers, swinging in his hand.
John clicked it on the torch lighting up small sections and he turns it towards the walls, looking around for a light switch which he quickly found. He flipped it on a loud noise comes from the end of the hall startling the three but no lights come on. John takes Sherlocks arm his breathing stuttering.
“221B Baker Street.” Sherlock announces as they walk into the flat. John looks around curiously at supposedly their flat. It’s messy, ridiculously dirty and outdated yet John feels completely at home. From the skull on the mantle to whatever those stains are on the floor John feels entirely familiar with everything. It’s how he feels around Sherlock but projected on everything around him.
“I love you too..” he said in the same tone and they kissed again, sherlock taking a step back to support himself against the doorframe. Setting the dogtags on the lamp as he could reach to use his hands more effectively.
That night the residents of Baker Street slept a little more soundly, a little more safely and much more importantly a little more happily. In the morning Mrs Hudson made pies and let them have them for breakfast before dashing off to their next case.
That night he didn’t sleep until he could see the sun rays coming in from the small window above his door. Only then with the small comfort that the sun brought, did he fall asleep.
When Sherlock woke up again it was late afternoon not yet getting dark but sun just starting to go down. The first thing he did was look over to John; he was watching his window again but this time sitting up on his own, looking much more in control. He only had a breathing mask instead of the tube which was good they could talk and no shackles. Sherlock got up from his bed stretched a bit before going over to John’s doorway tapping it to get his attention. John looked over smiling slightly before removing the mask and setting it beside him.
“Yes. He’s going to piece it together and put it in his armory.” Sherlock said placing the bottle down before going back into the kitchen to get tumbler glasses for them.
John followed Sherlock into the bedroom to get dressed as well and when he was done came out to make breakfast. The fridge was -thankfully- stocked with lots of different types of food and John made up some omelets while Sherlock showered.
“Why did you ask him that?” Sherlock was quiet for a while Molly didn’t think she was going to get an answer till he stood up and went to his bag to unpack.
Sherlock pulls the blankets up over himself, shifting closer to the wall where he knew John was laying on the other side. He couldn’t do this alone and John would know how to tell her gently while Sherlock only knew how to be blunt. John was much better with people.
Strong, brave John reduced to a crying child on his bed all because Sherlock failed to keep him safe. He’d failed again, to keep him here with him. He was the only one John knew and attached himself to, he couldn’t stay with Mycroft it was going to be terrible for him. He couldn’t keep John safe any longer.
"It's to big for my finger." He laughed still crying and smiling Sherlock pulled away smiling as well.
Something seemed to snap in Sherlock and within a moment of lapsed consciousness the pedestal was gone, in pieces around him marked with the dirt and rust of the decaying unit. Soft white smudged with the deep red of his own blood from his battered hands in the aftermath. When he regained his thought process, the paper lay before him amongst the beast-like destruction around him entirely untouched, still mocking him from the center of the space.
He couldn’t see. His eyes weren’t open, he felt a bit like a newborn discovering things for the first time. He opened his eyes to the bright world around him, taking a moment for his eyes to adjust to the light. Slowly he was able to see the moon and the stars above.
“Your Sherlock then?” He was surprised to hear John's voice, let alone his own name and it definitely showed from the answering smile from John. “Mrs Carson told me your name, I hope you don't mind.”
"Obviously this 'Jim Moriarty's' plan was to get John's attention. It's a game that's all it is. A game of chess and he's made his move. He needed a big enough ploy to traumatize John so he doesn't speak of what he knows but not enough to incapacitate. Just enough to get him thinking. Clearly he's achieved this and now it's just a matter of time. He's been planning this if he's preserved the body and the blood for so long. He wasn't expecting me I'm an unregistered player, and I intend to win." Sherlock swept off again without letting Greg speak again though he yelled after him anyway.
"Got the tomatoes." Sherlock announced coming in from the slider door holding up two shiny red tomatoes.
“Happy Christmas, Sherlock.” John said in return with a small smile, clinking their glasses together lightly.
"Mycroft isn't the friendliest though his connections come in handy." Sherlock says smirking lightly at John's reaction.
For some reason John was drawn to him, this urging need to be in his presence as if he craved the man himself. The feeling ached inside of his chest as he stared at the closed door. It pulled and pushed at his chest at the same time making him wriggle in unease as he tried to satisfy the odd feeling. He fell to his side laying on the bed then lifting the covers to his shoulders while continuing to stare at the closed door between them. Even with the promise Sherlock had left him with he was still uncertain of everything that has happened in only two days.
A shock greets John to the light and noise, with a defibrillator rising from his bare chest. A hand clutches his own and it grounds him from the onslaught of pain in this world. Time passes it seems entirely too fast and yet too slow he cant get his eyes open in time to see the world before he's gone under again. This time not so far under but just enough for peace.
That was something that wouldn't fade away, the image of what Sherlock was before he’d dragged him into all this. When he was just another patient next door to him and in the time he had spent with Sherlock now immobile, he’d often wished he could have fixed his mistakes and not brought Sherlock into this. Just stayed in the hospital.
When they broke apart panting and gasping for air they could help but look into each other's surprised faces and laugh.
Sherlock shook himself to disband his thoughts which seemed to be spiraling downwards before flicking off the light and exiting John’s room then walking the few steps back to his own. He opened the door to his room quietly and closed it gently hoping Molly was asleep and crept into his bed.
Calling John from on top of Barts the emotion he hated in his voice, trying so hard not to convey it to John but use it to comb him of his lies. He was the worst friend to ever walk the face of the earth. He regretted every second of it.
Their first case, circling the pink lady’s body slowly and picking apart the pieces of her murder. John’s eyes lit up as he displayed his deductions, the soft words of encouragement, the brightness in his eyes.
“John, I solved a case in one day the police couldn’t solve in years.” Sherlock tilted his head narrowing his eyes slightly. “Do you really think I couldn’t tell when you don’t like something?” John huffed out a laugh as he fell onto the wall, his coat scratching against the dodgy paint job.
"You're absolutely brilliant John." He exclaimed then proved to walk towards the street to hail a cab. "I think it's time we headed home."
"Hello?" John asked wearily walking slowly down the empty hallway. He thought of yelling at the screen to not go out alone because that's how they all die. Curiosity kills them all.
In the midst of the silence Sherlock hears his phone ringing he gets up to pull it from his coat. It’s Lestrade, of course it’s Lestrade. The only people that call Sherlock are John, Mycroft and Lestrade. Sherlock hasn’t done anything worth Mycroft’s attention and Johns…incapacitated.
I am on a really bad schedule of putting up a chapter a disappearing for a month. I’m trying to get out of that. Anyway, I hope everyone is keeping clean and safe. Enjoy!
"We really" John tried to protest but of course before he can Sherlock jumps up and filers her to the kitchen.
"He's right. You shouldn't be alone, I'll go down first." Greg said not letting either of them go down there and get hurt.
Alternatively perhaps he’d lapsed into a sort of coma or intense state of shock. Maybe it was that he had been possessed by some supernatural being, not that he believed in that but it was always good to examine all of the options. Perhaps he had gone blind or in the act of being hanged he’d entered an odd space between life and death, or his brain had been damaged by the lack of oxygen. He had hoped it wasn’t that one.
“I know.” Mycroft nodded some glancing towards the building and at everyone around it, it was so quiet. None of them had forgotten the bodies at the entrance, they were all just hoping to not let the death count get any higher. “I don't like waiting like this.”
John shakes his head not wanting to say and have Sherlock panic or something if he realizes he’s hurt. “We need to go, someone is coming.” He says, carefully taking Sherlocks good arm and helping him up.
Within the time period of then and now Sherlock and John have become closer. As well as Molly and the drummer who’s named turned out to be, James, Jim or Joe? It was one of those. But with Molly off with her - “He’s not my boyfriend, Sherlock! Shut up!” - Sherlock and John spent most of their time together, doing anything and everything. Sherlock liked it that way when no one was around and they could just relax and forget John was famous.
Sherlock woke up startled by the beeping sound around him, looking around widley as he realized he was in a different environment than what he remembered. Less gracefully arised from sleep than pulled from it suddenly.
They don’t say anything, there isn’t anything to be said. They talk silently for Johns sake words being exchanged through the flutter of an eyelid or twitch of a finger. They may not have been speaking but the words and meaning were clear to Sherlock. The silent assurances didn’t go unnoticed and though it was unusual for Mycroft to show any type of care it only made Sherlock more grateful for the fact.
“Okay, listen. Before I go blabbering on about someone else’s life- which I really shouldn’t by the way -I have to ask. Why, Sherlock? He’s been through enough already. So If you are going to-“
“I can’t believe he’s a detective already, I feel like he just graduated.” John muses to himself falling back against the couch stretching out across it.
“I didn’t mean to snap.” He said in a much calmer tone. “I just have seen worse, people who couldn’t be saved. You can though, John. I know you don’t believe so, but just trust me, that I will pick up the pieces and put them back in their places. I promise.”
Sherlock exits his bedroom, John in his arms as they make their way together to the living room. Both a comfort to the other in this terrible situation that seemed impossible.
The man seems so peaceful and John suddenly wishes he knew his name. So perhaps he could add meaning to the man that gave him his own name and brought him out from the darkness. He wishes he knew him, clearly he was important to John and soon he would realise John couldn’t remember him and he wouldn't have the same hopeful look in his eyes like last night anymore. He would look sad and disappointed in John.
“You’re frightening him.” Lestrade mutters under his breath his eyes flicking between them and John. They both looked over to John whose back was on the wall as he looked at them warily while also inching towards Sherlock.
Johns screams and cries, trying to get out of Sherlock’s arms as if knowing what was going to happen. He squeezes John gently as they enter the upstairs bedroom fearful for him and how this would go. The room is almost unrecognizable with all the people and equipment everywhere as they enter and the doctor gets John set up.
He, himself wasn't sure what to think. John was his friend, a close mate that he had shared a lot with over the years of knowing him. The situation was a hard one, obviously for everyone involved but Greg couldn’t comprehend how this must be for Sherlock. The man had only recently opened himself up to a relationship with John, which was no small feat for the detective. He couldn’t imagine what it must feel like, he didn’t want to imagine it.
“Alright alright. I just worry.” Sher replies with a sigh and his father gave her a side hug and stepped out of the house.
“And you were going to eat that blood.” John said exasperatedly rolling his eyes. “Why I brought you, I have no idea. It probably would’ve been easier alone.”
He shook his head. “I’m sure they will only confirm it if that’s what you need.” John nodded and Mycroft turned to leave the room, the door clicked behind him.
“How did you find this out?” He grabs the remote and fiddles with the controls until it turns on. “What channel?”
John remembers with horrifying clarity as he watched the skin slowly be cut away and the blood seeping out. In that moment one second it looked like a deer and the next his mother, bleeding out under his hands. Jim Moriarty smiled sinisterly at him before continuing to strip the skin off completely. He saw it being his mother's own leg and not the stags, he remembers hearing her choke out his name from past the blood in her mouth. He screamed as Jim Moriarty dropped the stag and came up to him grinning madly covered in blood and holding the knife up threateningly. He was dragged by his arm to where the stag lay unmoving, he tried desperately to get away. He kicked and scratched and screamed but it did nothing as Jim was older and stronger. He was pushed down next to the bloody stag as the knife came to his hip as if to be skinned as well.
Sherlock woke in the world he had left with the partners he had left with and things were different and no one would understand how or why but him. He had been gone for years and no one had any idea of it.
He couldn’t move more than a foot forward before having to stop again, a streak of blood across the linoleum. Rocks and rubble of the building getting caught in his wounds tearing at the sensitive skin.
“Oh my goodness!” Molly yelled into her pillow before turning and jumping up from her bed to hug Sherlock.
Molly stayed quiet after that just listening while unpacking. The sound was so familiar yet she couldn’t quite place it. That tingling feeling bugged them both for almost thirty minutes Sherlock trying to ignore it and Molly trying to place it.
“Don’t worry, it’ll go away.” Sherlock says soothingly placing a hand on his arm and watching John’s face carefully as he seems to be slowly panicking.
“You’re afraid of Mycroft.” Sherlock states watching John with a critical eye. John just shrugs picking at the large jumper he was wearing. “Why?”
He sat slowly back down onto the bumper and checked over his shoulder to where Greg was laying inside the ambulance, busy paramedics working over his prone body. He should be focusing on him, yes but Sherlock was still out there. He wasn’t safe.
"Of course, anything for you Sherlock." She replied standing and pressing a kiss to his forehead before leaving him to look back across the hall.
As they walk Sherlock glared at everyone and everything and pushing people out of the way and John apologized behind him as he got pulled along. Sherlock was furious with Moriarty how dared he to inject what very well might be poison into John to make him younger than he went as far as to track him like some kind of animal. Sherlock would be sure he'd die very slowly.
“This is so great! Who is he, do I know him?” She shoots off questions sitting beside him trying not to scream in pure happiness for Sherlock.
“Molly!” She kinda yelled and the few people that were there looked towards them. He waved them off and the sound continued in the room.
“I’m leaving.” Jim said simply as he packed his bag, he didn’t have much to say or many possessions to pack for that matter.
“By staying all of us, together.” Mycroft replies as they entered the little coffee shop. All they needed was to stick together and they’d be fine.
It burned and ached, indescribable agony eating his body with every ragged breath pulling himself forward. He had to get to John. It was all he needed to keep going.
“...Alright.” Sherlock caves uncertainly but hopefully this will be for the best. “You really can’t tell anyone before I talk to him though, okay?”
“You left him alone?” John asked shocked and sighed moving over to the door again, quickly navigating through the papers hoping he wasn’t in danger.
Sherlock creeped into the room slowly as the door clicked shut behind him. He tried to see into the darkness as his eyes got used to it the only light from the skylight above.
Mycroft came back over to Greg and he pulled him aside for a moment out of everyone else's view. “He’ll be okay.” Greg said in a hushed tone, no matter the distance they were from anyone else it seemed almost wrong to be so outward about it.
A thoughtful expression passed over Moriarty’s face and Sherlock couldn't figure out what it was he had just come up with but he knew he wasn't going to like it. “Oh, silly me. Let’s not waste your pitiful life now, I’ll make use of you yet.”
"Yeah.." A tragedy indeed, to only have control over your own body when your mind sees fit, is unimaginable. He'd have to ask Lestrade if he could get his file maybe this could be a cold case, maybe he could help John.
"Has that ever happened before?" John asked quietly trying not to disturb Sherlock's apparent thinking.
“Roof.” He answered smiling mischievously pulling John quickly again towards the elevator. John looked like he might pass out from worry.
Sherlock returned in a rush to his room with no incident, he closed his door and with a small victory twirl pulled the cigarette and lighter from his pocket. Anderson would just think he had left it in the lounge, idiot. Just as he was about to light it the door swung open then a loud thump of something being dropped and someone pulled the cigarette from his mouth
His phone buzzing brought him out of his head so he arranged the bags he was holding then pulled it from his pocket. Molly was calling that was odd she knew he hated calls must be important.
With a resigned sigh Greg scrubbed his hands over his face and walked back to the scene. He needed every person he could get on this case.
"Okay, one, you know his name. Two, what's wrong with the magazine?" Molly asked turning in her seat at the desk to stare at him incredulously.
They continued that way for sometime taking jabs at each other with words and hands occasionally. Mycroft was just trying to push Sherlock to get better and Sherlock knew that but it was still annoying. When they reached John’s room door Sherlock practically collapsed onto his brother with relief and happiness at being able to see John and finally being able to sit down.
“It’s not that I think he’s harming him.” Sherlock says turning around to look back at him from his place at the end of the hall. “It’s that I don’t trust him to protect John.” Sherlock turned and left.
“Exactly. You have to live John, and not from behind the glass of my hospital room while your stuck to a bed.” Sherlock knew he already would cave and go anyway but he had to prove his point. He’s been stuck in that bed for god knows how long. He needs to see the world for himself.
"W-What? Why would I-. I-I don't think of him like that." John cursed himself internally for stuttering.
Sherlock opened one eye to watch his expression as he seemed to prepare himself. Lestrade was a man of character, distinct in scenarios yet able to blend in with the rest of the population in other times. He had a commanding presence and wouldn’t take any ‘crap’- as they say -from anyone, he was a man of his own power and will, quickly promoting him Detective Inspector and on his way to Detective Chief Inspector. He is a simple man really, sticking to tradition and opting to marry right out of highschool which came to a tragic end three years later in a divorce he initiated due to her arrey of lovers. He didn’t have any children though he wanted them and anyone who knew him would say he would make an amazing father although he doubted himself and never adopted or tried for another relationship. Or at least he hasn’t to Sherlocks knowledge. He was young, 36, hair only just starting to gray on his sideburns truly in the prime of life yet no attachment except for John of course though he seemed more distanced from him now.His expression when talking about John was saddened as if he believed he had lost him already.
It was exhilarating running with John even over something so simple but he mind. They ignored angry teachers telling hem not to run in the halls rushing about as fast as they could. They run up staircases many of them until they reached Johns room. John unlocked his door with fumbling hands with how exited he was and they tumbled inside.
As loud as the voices were there were so many Sherlock couldn't pick it what was being said. He sighed to himself as he leaned against the wall trying to pick out John's voice. He could faintly but he didn't seem to be doing as much yelling as the other people. With another resigned and defeated sigh Sherlock slipped back into his room.
"'Lock." Sherlock opened his mouth again to accept another bite. That was another thing, one day John had just called him 'Lock' by accident and was embarrassed and started apologizing profusely when Sherlock just said 'I like it'. John uses it almost all the time now. Sherlock gets butterflies every time and has to repress a smile. As John lifted the fork to his mouth again as voice came from the door, John looked behind him at it.
“Why did you stay?”John asked quietly after some time pulling Sherlock out of his musings. He knew what he meant, because he thought it himself. Why did you stay when you’ve had all these chances to leave, he’s just some random person you met, why is he any different, why aren't you bored? Why do you stay?
“I know.” He swallowed a bit thickly before looking towards his father. He never brought up his mother so it was odd now and yet he showed no reaction.
The need for something stimulating seemed to drown him, even just a cigarette might do. He needed something, anything that would satisfy him. He vaguely wondered if he could nick a cigarette off of a doctor. He remembered seeing Dr. Anderson using one in the doctors lounge, seeing how much of an idiot he was it’d be easy to pull it from his coat. Perhaps he left a box in the lounge, then he’d just have to get in with one of their cards. Easy.
“What else is there to think? That is the only explanation and using your way of thinking-“ Shelrock said as he stood and walked to the whiteboard grabbing and marker he wrote ‘who, what, when, how, why.’ “-we must fill in these blanks.”
There was a ticking somewhere in the distance As Sherlock slammed his shoulder against the door that stood between him and John. It was silent inside but he knew he was there, he had to be. The last four rooms he had done the same to stood empty behind him. It was the last one and it had to be it.
The pieces were coming together as if they wanted to be together, longing to be connected. Pressing into each other to click into place till only three pieces were missing.
“No, you’ll need to go to the hospital with Detective Inspector Lestrade. Everything else will be taken care of.” She interrupted and took hold of his arm bringing him back to the ambulance as she spoke. “Just stay here.” She said very firmly this time and sat him down on the number of the vehicle, before he could protest any further she left.
"Hmm?" Sherlock hums questionably preoccupied with his microscope but paying attention still, just slightly.
Logically it should be impossible, scientifically it’s feasible though generally at an extremely high risk. This wasn’t simple and was clearly thought out and planned thoroughly, for what purpose Sherlock hadn’t figured out. There were many possible reasons one simply being to incapacitate himself as well as John by doing so but it seemed so simple Sherlock wasn't and couldn't be entirely sure to his reasoning.
It was years into it when the spell broke. He knew it would happen eventually, knew the confines of this place couldn’t hold him forever, all it took was three words.
“You don’t do that by eating it. I should’ve just came alone.” John grumbled to himself. “Just don’t put anything in your mouth alright?”
He moved quicker, a map forming in his head of what he assumed the place looked like as he moved through. He wasn’t one to frequent power plants so the terrane was new to him while he had a rough idea it was difficult to say for certain taking turns blindly having lost the echo of Johns voice -what felt like- a long while ago now.
Mycroft nodded and left without another word, John didn’t expect him not to spy on him but he didn’t care. He’d rather have the illusion of being alone than none at all. He waited until he heard Mycroft’s footsteps go all the way down to the bottom floor of the flat building, until he heard the door to the building close and he knew that he was alone.
“No. There’s no way in hell I'm leaving you here alright?” John said sternly and took a breath. “I love you and I’m not going to lose you.”
A silhouette -that Sherlock could only hope was John- stood right before all the papers, frozen there before all the many photographs suspended from the ceiling.
“I’d make due with an explanation.” Sherlock replies watching Moriarty from his place on the floor, observing him. Picking out what he could from his expression and body language, in all honesty he didn’t know much on the situation. Not that it mattered, he’d accepted that this was the end for him, perhaps he was just buying what little time he had left. Pulling out his suffering just a bit longer to bring an end to this case, at least let him have a conclusion before whatever came next.
Not having done the same, still in his own horror of seeing the building his brother was in disappear in front of his eyes. Greg called for him and ran to him as quickly as he could although he felt as if it was in slow motion. He pushed faster, ran harder to grab him and pull him away from the building as chunks hit the ground at high speeds around them.
“It’s nothing.” Sherlock waves him off and stands going to the door but John was quick and jumped up holding the door closed before he could leave.
Sherlock pulls out his phone careful not to jostle John and texts Mycroft, hoping he’d get there before John had slept long enough to de-age again. For now he could only hold the small child close and hope.
Sherlock shook himself trying not to think about it but that was just about impossible with his mind. He pulled out his phone to text Mycroft about the details of getting the tracker out of John and hopefully some progress on a cure.
John closed his eyes as another hour of silence fell upon him once again as he was left alone in the hospital room with Sherlock’s immobile body. He had been here for two days already and Sherlock’s only movement was his chest rising and falling, the doctors couldn't even say if he would wake up.
“Lestrade, brilliant man, absolutely brilliant. Have I ever told you?” He said in revery as he ripped open the box.
Three years later he returned home and nothing felt quite the same as he left it. Three years and decades of experience in his head, he has been gone so much longer and done so much more.
James would deny it. He would fight and scream at his father for hours afterwards, receiving some nasty bruises for his disrespect towards him. He’d break the coffee table and curse the world, end up locked in his room and cut his hands trying to pick up the pieces of his mother’s shattered mirror that he’d broken in his anger.
The beacon with Sherlocks location blinking in response to the tracker's proximity as well as a piece of parchment beside it. It read in delicate scrawl; ‘Tick tock goes the clock, Begins Johnny’s shock, The clock hits tens, And then it all ends. How long can he run, Away from the fun, Until he’s screaming in pain, Then dies in vain.’
“I guess we should get you ready then.” Sherlock said quietly after he finished talking with the man at the door. He sighed softly to himself as John nodded and lifted his arms up to him quietly asking to be picked up. He came over and picked John up and brought him to the bedroom to pack up the things John would need for his stay.
“I was trying to protect you-“ Sherlock started but is cut off by a loud noise coming from behind them and they both freeze.
Sebastian was Jim’s anchor, keeping him steady and not letting him drift off into the sea of his father’s madness. But Sebastian was gone. Murdered, they said drive by but Jim knew better. His father had him killed, had him killed so Jim had to stay with John. Make John's life a living hell and he would.
“What happened?” Sherlock asks with a groan not recalling as he sits up not feeling much of the pain yet still coming back to himself.
"Well first I'd show you around London maybe we'll visit my parents. Then France or Italy for wine and cheese all the gourmet foods. If you wanted we'd travel to America, New York the city never sleeps or Texas where the sunsets would take your breath away.California or Maine to visitor the beaches but I don't think I'd care though as long as I was with you."
“No.” Sherlock says immediately adamant and defensive looking back down to John's small form in his arms.
John looked as if in shock, his hands on his mouth and tears in his eyes where they were stuck to the window as he continued to cry out. Sherlock rushed to John falling to his knees, grabbing him and pulling him against his chest shielding him from the window which seemed to be the problem. John held to his shirt and sobbed in anguish as Sherlock held him close with a hand on the back of his head.
“Sorry, mam.” Another voice said somehow familiar though Sherlock just ignored paying more attention to the files. It was probably a boyfriend Molly tended to get them quickly and break up with them even quicker.
"When I was a child I would have panic attacks often but it has been many years since I have had one." Sherlock spoke just as quite yet dismissively, watching the storm brew outside. The snow slowly piling up on John's balcony as the storm becomes more erratic.
Suddenly among Johns inner chaos there were noises coming from around them and his heart stopped as he held his breath, the intermittent clicking of feet on stairs of metal. The stairs were just in the other room he remembered horrified but the fact. He knew he had to act fast. They were right out in the open, right in the center of the old gymnasium but John didn’t think he could carry Sherlock especially without hurting him immensely and he couldn’t drag him, there would be too much blood.
The big boned man, -with what anyone with any common sense would describe as a ‘beer belly’ or otherwise known as a paunch- Roger Moriarty sat in his red recliner that was just holding on by a thread to falling apart as most things were in the trailer. Flipping through a newspaper a single lamp was on beside him, the only one in that room. Most of the rooms in the trailer didn’t actually have electricity.
He had just gotten comfortable when he heard footsteps across the battered carpet they called a floor.
"Oh just thinking don't let it alarm you." He replied as he sat up and looked over at the file on his bedside table, John noticed.
It stayed as it was a respect of similar minds that worked high above everyone else’s and found a meeting place here in this dark place. It seemed fitting, Sherlock thought as he didn’t pull the trigger and a sort of regret settled over his head, Moriarty grinned some sensing it too.
There was a ringing in his ears as he ran but it might as well have been in slow motion as the red string flowed to the ground. Pictures fluttering to the cement as the knives in the ceiling holding each picture up, dropped. Simultaneously they fall to the ground and the silence before they reach their target is terrifying with only John's hurried footsteps to mark how long had passed.
“Probably yes.” Sherlock stands stretching a bit as he stands. “I’m going to grab that file I stole from Lestrade.”
"I'm not smart like you Sherlock. I can't remember every little thing he said to me almost a decade ago." John said exasperatedly as he fiddles with his shirt.
Sherlock sat there in silence feeling empty without John’s familiar presence puttering about around him. He feels truly alone.
"You are getting younger, I want to know why. The answer might be in your blood and perhaps even a cure." He says already putting a bit on blood on a slide and putting it under his microscope.
“Well then, second choice. Feeling well?” Moriarty asked with a gleaming smile in the darkness, that much was visible to one consulting detective.
“It wasn’t that difficult, I only replaced a few things so most of the mechanism is original. Do you like it?” Sherlock asked watching him as he looked it over.
“Come sit.” He knew he probably shouldn’t, someone would come and he would get yelled at again and forced to leave, but he couldn’t seem to find his voice. So he walked across the small space to his bed and sat by John’s legs that were swaying slightly from side to side.
"There was absolutely no reason for me to go John! Your lucky you didn't go! You would've been so bored!" Sherlock yelled up the stairs as he pounded off his feet to get off the mud. "I know I was!"
“Sherlock-“ Lestrade sighs as he too stands up and sticks his hands in his pockets trying to claim the picture of nonchalant and failing. “He probably doesn’t even-“
“I don’t. I only care about you, my father can rot in hell for all I care.” Jim insisted adamantly placing his hand over Sebastians on his cheek. “Stay with me Sebastian.”
Tears dripping down cheeks onto the cement, knees bleeding from the glass shattered about. Body shaking in anticipation and grief, breath coming out in labored huffs.
“We have to get you help and I can’t carry you, come on Sherlock, please get up.” John begged, glancing down the hall as he heard the footsteps getting closer.
“Trust me, you’ll be back out solving cases soon.” She patted his ankle as she picked up some article of clothing from the end of the bed.
Sherlock gasped, his throat constricted as his lungs refused to take in air. He coughed unable to move any further, having only made it a few yards from his original place against the wall.
"Come on, there's a food truck down the road and I'm starving." John said after their laughter dies down. Sherlock agrees and they head down that way in silence. When they get there John gets them food and Sherlock finds a bench to sit on and they eat in comfortable silence.
"Sherlock we found- uh.." Lestrade looked between the two men who were looking at him questionably, John's hand still suspended in the air next to Sherlock's mouth. He cleared his throat awkwardly. "Am I interrupting something?"
“You should be used to it by now.” Sherlock grumbles angrily feeling Johns hands grip at his shirt from behind him quiet whimpering noises following. “Go away now, we’ll come out when we’re ready.” He waves him off.
"Yes, I trust him. Besides he's an officer, if anything goes wrong he can call for backup." John reasoned keeping a level head as he could about this.
As much as he was glad for Sherlock and Greg's help it was no longer helpful. His heart hammered in his chest as he pointed the torch down into the room, coming up to the door. As far as he could see it was just another hallway, he glanced back at Greg and Sherlock, they were still too absorbed in their fight to notice he left.
“His hand will probably linger on his butt.” It didn’t and John gave the man a pat on the shoulder they laughed then continued playing. Sherlock looked to Molly smugly.
"You.. want to go out with me..?" John was stunned in the moment Sherlock was a perfect being in every way and John was just a person. He couldn't even compete with Sherlock and just the thought of Sherlock even being interested in him was laughable.
Sherlock couldn't remember who initiated it but found himself with an arm full of John and a nose full of his hair. They were both full on sobbing at this point hardly gable to breath through John's hair but couldn't bring himself to move away.
“Heartwarming.” A gleaming white smile said in the distance, echoing through the halls over and over.
"Yeah, uh.. We'll pull up the file if you need but they were together five years or so then split around nine years ago. Apparently he tried to strangle her though there weren't any witnesses or anything to prove it. So they got divorced and she instituted a restraining order." Greg relayed the information gruffly, shuffling his feet.
"Sherlock." He stared resolutely at the microscope in front of him suddenly unsure and acting the opposite of the cocky confident detective John knew so well. "Look at me, please." He reluctantly lifted his head to meet John's eyes, confidence was nonexistent in his own eyes just doubt with an underlying fear.
"No, no I do.. just.." John couldn't find words to express what he was thinking and feeling. This was Sherlock his friend, who had come to be his best friend. He couldn't deny that he thought about him like that, of course he did, how could he not? Sherlock was an anomaly a normal person would label him an alien all cheekbones and sharp edges basically the polar opposite of John. Well people always say opposites attract.
He was slightly taken back by the action he just helped no less touched another person willingly. He never helped anyone let alone touch them in any form so this was a bit of a shock. The boy looked slightly more aware now and was noticing his discomfort, so he tapped his foot lightly to the edge rail of the bed, the shackle and metal bar clanging against each other loudly in the silence.
Sherlock adjusted his clothes a bit to hide the indent of the gun better before taking a large breath to get into the right mindset. Doing so he noticed the faint smell of smoke and looked around himself confused before realizing it was coming from the kitchen. Thinking the worst Sherlock rushed to kitchen coughing as he entered the room as smoke was steadily rising.
"John! Come on, JOHN!" Sherlock yelled banging frantically on John's door. He swore to himself internally and quickly went into his room.
“You could always just ask him.” Lestrade murmured after they had stared at the file for an unidentifiable amount of time. “Though I’m not sure what or if he remembers.”
“I am. I’d die with you then spend another second in this house.” Jim said completely serious just wanting to be with him. “Please let me come with you.”
They slip into bed and curl up into each other's arms they both let out content sighs as they settle. The weight of the day finally hitting their minds and bodies as they lay together. They comfort and console each other away from erratic thoughts and eventually drift to sleep.
He pressed his palm to Sherlock’s cheek and called his name trying to get a response but none came, he got louder and louder and started to shake him. Someone tried to pull him away but he pushed them off and just screamed his name louder. His world was dying in his arms and there was absolutely nothing he could do about it.
When they finished Sherlock took out his violin and began to play not the melodramatic sad song he usually did but a beautiful upbeat melody of Johnathan Watson’s song ‘Pretender’. Molly found herself humming along and if she paid enough attention she could hear Sherlock doing the same.
Like the fact that Sherlock's voice is so deep it makes him shiver and his laugh so sweet he can't help but smile. Sherlock's smile is soft and tentative as if he was afraid we had doing something wrong. His sentences were precise and thought out carefully, each word perfectly pronounced -unlike John's sentences where some of his words would mix into others when he spoke too fast- as if afraid to be judged. He walked and dressed with perfection and wore a mask to hide behind. John wanted more than anything to be let into Sherlock's mind so he could witness the brilliance that lies beneath.
He went to his classes as usual, hardly paying attention and walking the halls idly in his free time between classes. He solved cases on his laptop that people sent him while he waited for John to be done with his music class. He had created a website a while ago but it was finally getting some attention and he was receiving some interesting cases online to occupy him.
"I think I'd rather be a doctor. I'd make a lot more money as well, so win win." John explains throwing the empty tub of ice cream into the trash across the room. It missed. "What else do we have?"
He couldn’t breath. It was impossible through the thick substance. Death was imminent, he knew that and yet he struggled not one to greet death so easily. He’d hold on for as long as it took, he told himself though his body protested. Not able to take much more of the abuse to his lungs.
“Look at you. So human, isn't it sickening?” Moriarty drawled and for a moment as Sherlocks sight settled onto him, he looked like a shadow through his blurred vision. A dark and evil something with too much light around him.
“Yes, I want to know.” John probed for answers. He had been curious as to why they had been on a first name basis from when he first called him and the way he talks about him they must be close. Greg just sighed again though more good naturedly.
"There must be something. Let me do the search." Sherlock demands moving his chair closer to the desk.
When he came out of his head Sherlock realized he was on the stairwell heading up towards the roof. People would call it sweet. Thinking of John led him to the place they had spent the most time together. It was odd the way feelings would bubble up at the simple thought of John Watson and past conversations with him.
“Not at all I’m afraid.” Sherlock chuckles and sits up lifting John up off his chest and setting him in his lap instead. “I need to call Mycroft and get this sorted out.” He sighs quietly looking down at the small child in his arms, looking up at him curiously. “Get you back to normal.”
John’s eyes were probably the most compelling part about him, their color a deep sea blue with a hint of silver making them shine in the city lights. They pull you into him, a multitude of emotions just over the horizon of his eyes.
This was an accidental long chapter yay! I usually only do around 1200 to 1400 max but this was 1968 so whoops! Anyway hope you enjoy!
Sherlock smiles softly at the thought and gently lifts John off of him shifting away and lying him down into the bed. He places a soft kiss on his forehead and gets his phone his phone -which he had dropped to the floor in the excitement before- stopping at the door to watch John a moment. He looked angelic the sunset coming in through the windows casting a lovely orange glow to his features.
The little icon in the corner said it was coming on next so they just had to wait. Time went by like sand in an hourglass that’s hole was too small for sand to fall properly through it. Single grains at a time slowly falling in time. Sherlock feels like he’s shaking it willing the glass to open and allow the sand to flow. Then it shatters hitting the ground as the sand pours out the side and Johnathan Watson shows up on the screen.
“First off, to them you are a piece of work to be shown off one with a rather good singing voice. Second, I won’t be going home to my parents. And third-”,
Mycroft would be attending the same school as he was just for one year as he already had the four years before that. He had chosen to stay for an unidentifiable amour if time to get all kinds of crappy government courses and next year he’d be going home. That goodness he didn’t have to be there for that, Mycroft was insufferable on his best days.
A torch rolled and flickered lifeless from the light of the door at the end of the hall. It sat between the two doors and unbeknownst to anyone but the lonely torch a toothing grin glimmered in the dark before the entrance door shut, consuming everything in darkness.
When he turned he saw Molly standing in front of him, concern still on her face. She was wearing those tiny ripped shorts and tank top that should’ve been thrown away ages ago and had makeup caked on her face. He didn’t know if he could bare to but looked to John.
He complained about anything and everything constantly but after about a week and a half John was finally awake and there was no slowing him down. He actually ran to John's room when he heard the news, he wasn’t supposed to be walking let alone running but this time no one stopped him.
There was nothing John could do. John knew he couldn’t fool this man, he knew somehow without actually knowing him that this man could tell if he was lying or acting. He couldn't tell him or remember him so how was he supposed to keep the happy look in his eyes? He wishes he knew something of the man, just to keep him happy.
Things had been hectic which wasn't the plan. Plans never really seemed to work for the two or at least nothing normal on the plan would work.
He texts Mycroft a few choice -mainly curse- words to get him to come to the flat quicker while also informing him briefly of the situation. If Mycroft didn’t have a cure or at least something to stop Johns de-aging process, he didn’t want to think of what might happen. Yet he couldn’t stop thinking about it either and that terrified him.
“Skuwwy.” John whines quietly, pulling Sherlock from his thoughts to see John reaching for the skull as far as he could but unable to reach. Sherlock moved over and grabbed the skull handing it to John who held onto it clumsily with his little arms and chubby fingers.
He just blinked at John after his lips stopped moving, John blinked back. He couldn’t reply, Sherlock didn’t want him to anyway. He just liked to talk and have John listen to him, which John was happy to do anyway. Well not so happy right now but he was fine with listening, he liked Sherlock’s voice no matter what it was that he was saying.
"Oh that boy. I never know where he is." She waves off the question and stands up. "How would you two like to stay for dinner? Hmm? I'm sure I can whip up something." She offers as she makes her way to the kitchen.
“I don’t know. What do you think?” Johns asks brushing hair out of his face that was getting too long and into his eyes.
“Thank goodness, me too.” John smiles kissing Sherlock softly before pulling away lightly with a small grin. “You never told me if you were a virgin.”
“John, please.. I have to go.” He stepped back and turned towards the window, it was still how it should be and he tried his hardest to get rid of all of Baker Street from his mind. Pushing the window open and glancing down below them, just two floors up he could make it down easy.
“We’ll do everything in our power to find him. I promise. Now please go back to get checked over at the ambulance.” The woman told him for the second time, urging him to go back and leave her to do her job in peace while attempting to be as nice as possible.
"I love you as well, more than anything." After a few moments of kissing and hugging they collected themselves and John pulled Sherlock to his computer.
That changed today though, definitely. Mycroft was upset but he was calm and comforting in a way he didn’t really imagine he would be, but he was. He sat next to John and talked to the doctors for him and filled out the forms he couldn't seem to make any sense of no matter how long he stared at the page. What surprised him most though was that when John could no longer hold his head up and dropped it onto Mycroft's shoulder, he didn’t shrug him off or tell him to not touch him. He simply stayed still and let him rest. He couldn’t be more thankful for that.
“Nap time, then?” Sherlock suggests moving his arms to John’s back rubbing it lightly up and down. Despite what people might think Sherlock was rather good with kids he just never put in the effort. He didn’t know everything to do with them but he was good at understanding and getting along with children.
or the way his hands seemed to shake as he laid him down. He didn’t notice these things so his eyes slipped shut peacefully and the world went black.
“Yes but I won’t tell anyone, I promise. Please Sherlock, tell me. I’m dying to know!” Molly begs clasping her hands and trying to make him tell her with the puppy dog eyes that John had done.
John sat up on Sherlocks chest seemingly excited by the declaration. “I love you too!” He exclaimed and though there was aching, Sherlock couldn’t help but feel the slightest bit glad that John still loved him. In whatever way there was left to, it was enough.
They weren’t dating. They couldn’t be. Even an idiot could see they weren’t. She wasn’t interested and neither was he. His attention was focused elsewhere. His smile turned much more genuine. Although his inner fangirl was flipping out he played it cool.
When they got there they said goodbyes and his father drove off and Sherlock walked inside. Mycroft would be waiting somewhere to show him around but also show Molly around if he could find her. Really Molly shouldn’t be able to afford this school but her scholarship and talent in pathological studies.
“John is just a kid, younger than you, you know. And the way he acted, as if it was his fault, fucking messed up.”
There was this moment that they stood and it was fine, that somehow Sherlock didn’t notice. The intense feeling of pain doesn’t register to the unknowing mind. There’s many different kinds of pain but when a pain is so great, too great to bear, one tends to not recognize they are even in pain.
They arrive at the flat quickly and Sherlock bolts the doors the windows and pulls the curtains shut when they get inside then started pacing around nervously. He pulls out his phone again texting quickly as John watches from his place on the couch.
“Shewock?” John says quietly apparently awake and shifting atop of Sherlocks chest to peak up at him. Sherlock has the urge to correct Johns poor pronunciation of his name but decides to wait until after the important bit of this is done before working on his words.
"My mother, she disappeared two or so years ago. It was the strangest thing." John told him as they sat at the desk in Sherlock and Molly's dorm, like a proper investigation. Molly took notes.
The man moved to sit on the bed as he took both of John's hands into his own. He kissed them holding them to his lips for comfort, though it only succeeded in bringing back the ache of wishing to remember who this incredible man was. John closed his eyes as he felt tears fall from his cheeks and warm breath into his hands.
John scooches forward putting his hands on Sherlock’s head tapping it gently with his small first. “Empty.” He proclaims sitting back to look Sherlock in the eye.
Sherlock nodded trying to make out some of the pictures in the dark. “I think they were more than just friends John.” He said taking one of the pictures but the corner and angling it for John to see.
"I had hoped you wouldn't remember." Sherlock says moving to stand again and head to the kitchen. John stood and followed behind him slowly.
As much as Sherlock was thrumming with the anticipation of a crime scene he could see Lestrade needed to see John first. So he peels his eyes open and looks over to the man at the end of his uncomfortable bed.
"It's a surprise and not until tonight but you'll take ages to get ready." John practically screamed in happiness and hugged Sherlock again. They both smiled like lunatics and were laughing in happiness.
“Sherlock! Get your ass over where now!” She screamed and he pulled the phone away from his ear in shock. Molly didn’t swear she hardly ever raised her voice unless she was fan-girling which brought all this to a startling clarity for Sherlock.
“I play the violin, have taken music classes, as well as can write music.” Sherlock explains simply then looks at her expectantly.
The sound of rushing water hit Greg’s ears first though it mustn’t be water for he wasn’t wet in the slightest his mind told him. How could he know such a thing having no real feeling of his body? Beside a stream, he guessed. There weren’t streams near the school.
A whirring noise started to fill the room as little green lights ticked on, each machine coming to life.
Sherlock comes to flop down on the black chair and John follows sinking down onto the opposite one. When he looks up from examining the odd material of the chair he finds Sherlock with his eyes closed hands in a prayer position at his lips. For a second John thought he heard himself say ‘You and your bloody mind palace.’ Like a whisper it fluttered through his mind fleetingly before disappearing.
“Yes, you did.” Mycroft replied in a much less scathing tone it was almost understanding. “That doesn’t mean your relationship is over.”
“You took the most important person from me-“ James said harshly, any sense of false niceties falling from his feature as he stalked closer and John stood quickly.
"It's alright." Sherlock said soothing, gently taking the torch from John and pointing it down the hall where a door now lay open. "I'll go down first, you stay here with Greg."
Sherlock watched from across the room, he stared at John and John stared back silently. John imagined he was surprised too that Mycroft was being so kind and open with his worried expression. Sherlock didn't show it though. He sat directly across from them in the waiting room, blank faced and still although relaxed in his seat, leaning against the armrest to the right and away from the women sitting beside him and crying silently. Sherlock didn't like emotional people.
"Great. I'll see you both then." John said awkwardly leaving the tickets at the table by the door. "Um, bye." He waved nervously then left as soon as the door clicked closed Sherlock groaned. He fell onto the backrest of his chair leaning his head back and hiding his flushed face in his hands. He sighed to himself, irritated and feeling like the happiest idiot in the world.
Sherlock looked forward to the pictures and he hadn’t realized before but there were two people on them all. A boy of probably thirteen with blond hair and another only a little bit older than the other with black hair.
“Let’s just talk about this is in the morning, okay?” Sherlock says wanting to do this with John he couldn’t figure out the words alone.
For a moment he couldn’t believe his eyes and for another he almost broke out into laughter, of course it was the only one he hadn’t checked so it was correct. Of course it was just on the day that John had left that he had finally gotten it right, of course this is how it happened. It would be just his luck that he got it right the day that John had left.
