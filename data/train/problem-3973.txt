Inside, Dean found the living room as cozy as it had always been. There were two leather loveseats on each side of the room, a modest piano in the corner, and a fireplace near one of the sofas. The place smelled of magnolia and honey, a comfortable fire burning calmy. Sam took Dean's stuff to his bedroom and came back, finding him sitting on the piano, surfing through the scores on the music rack.
"Awesome! So where you joining us?", Dean seemed very happy with the news, he started walking away towards the stage to check if something was happening while still talking to the woman excitedly but always paying attention to everything surrounding him, something he had picked up from touring so many years. Castiel felt a little disappointed, he thought Dean was handsome and that his gaydar had picked something up but turns out it was wrong. "Better that way... Never good to mix dating with work anyway right?" he was thinking to himself, polishing some basses and Dean suddenly came back.
A while later, Castiel came outside the bathroom fully dressed after Dean had reconsidered and gathered his things to hop in the shower next. Cas moves to the farther side of the bed, getting ready for his usual reading before sleep, feeling more refreshed now and a little less tired.
"I promise," Jo smiled, this time a little more genuine. Dean thought he might have been getting through to her. "I've got to get home, but I'll see you tomorrow night."
“You want his soul and we’re the only ones who can give it to you,” Dean barked, annoyed by the stupid game Crowley was trying to play. They didn’t have time for this. People’s lives were in danger. “If anything happens to our friends because you think this is some kind of game, I’ll kill you and then I’ll kill John myself.” Crowley didn’t have to know that Dean was bluffing. He could never kill his own father with his own hands, even if John was a murderer who made Dean’s life hell growing up. He was the reason for all of Dean’s trauma, all the self hatred, the wanting to give up on himself. John deserved what was coming to him, but Dean could never do it himself.
"Thanks, but I'll stick with Sam," Dean answered coolly, instead of exploding like he wanted to do. "We work well together. Have for the past ten years, at least. Even before then. No point in separating us now."
Eventually, Dean seemed content with his walkthrough of Castiel's room and joined Cas on the bed, putting a substantial amount of space between them. They hadn't talked much yet, so things were starting to feel a little awkward. Luckily, Dean was far more sociable than Cas. "So, tell me that big brain of yours has some kind of idea about what we can do for this model we have to build," Dean started, pulling out his biology packet and a black pen. They had to fill out an entire packet and then build a model from the lesson, but there weren't any instructions. They could use whatever they wanted.
"I never forgave him for sending you away, Dean." At this, Dean looked up, eyes wide as he stared at his little brother. He swallowed the lump in his throat as Sam looked back at him with an expression filled with guilt. "I should have said something. I know you weren't with Bobby. Dad sent you away because he was angry with you. I never knew what you did, but I assumed-"
“Forget about everything else,” she called up to him, rocking back on her heels as Dean blinked in slow motion, letting her words sink in. “Just think about him. You know what to do,” she continued, soothing Dean’s nerves. They talked about this. She was right. Dean just had to tell the truth.
"Your mother's death must have been hard on him," Cas said, when Dean let the silence stretch on for too long.
Crowley hesitated for a few moments, staring at Dean with squinted eyes. Finally, he nodded. “I’ll be back. John’s next drop off is in three weeks.” And then he was gone.
Dean didn't want to lie, but he also couldn't tell him the full truth. "We're just friends," he admitted, trying to decipher the relieved look on Sam's face. It made no sense why he'd be relieved by that. "But we both want to appease John Winchester, the freaking asshole, so we're still dating. Got it?"
Cas started to walk away first, Dean on his heel. Suddenly, something jumped out from the shadows to their left, hidden by racks of clothes. Dean saw the sharp teeth and the deadly look in it's eyes for a split second. Without so much as a second thought, he wrapped his hand around the first thing of Cas' he could grab, which just so happened to be his new tie. He dragged Cas into the dressing room, slamming the door closed as he clicked the lock. The room was too small for both of them to fit comfortably, but they had a few inches of space between them. Dean still had that damn tie wrapped around his hand tight.
Jo scooted closer, grabbing Dean’s good shoulder to force him to turn back towards her, meeting her determined gaze. “There’s never a good reason to not be with someone you love, Dean,” she insisted, squeezing his shoulder for emphasis. Dean swallowed the lump in his throat, trying to look away. She grabbed his chin, holding him hostage there. “If the only thing keeping you apart is your father, we’ll find a way around it.”
"I will," Dean promised, smiling softly at his friends. "Let's try to hang out next week, okay? Cas needs to get on a good schedule before we do anything too taxing."
for at least two weeks, maybe longer,” he growled. John perked up at this display of power, tugging his hands out of his pockets as if he would do something about it. Dean liked to think if John put his hands on Cas, he’d step in and stop it. Some things were more important than keeping your dad from finding out you’re banging a dude.
Cas finally got to sleep a few hours later, but only after Dean read a few chapters of their book. It was difficult with only one hand, but he managed, just because he desperately wanted Cas to be able to sleep. Once he was out, Dean didn't want to wake him. He brought dinner back to the house and left it in the kitchen for when Cas woke up. A little after sunset, Jack and Sam were both in their rooms for the night, probably reading like the nerds they were. Cas had been asleep for a couple hours, but Dean was letting him sleep as long as he needed to. Preferably all night.
"Earth has humans like you," Cas responded, looking straight ahead as Dean glanced at the angel curiously. "And like Sam," he added, rubbing the back of his neck. "It's much better than I thought it would be."
“That was awesome,” Jo laughed, grabbing the front of Dean’s shirt to pull him against her, crashing their lips together without warning. Dean was shocked at first, so he didn’t move, but then he gained back his senses and gently pushed her away, putting a good amount of space between them.
"All clear," Sam announced, his eyes meeting Dean's as they all regrouped in the living room. His eyebrows shot up in a questioning glance and Dean tried to look away before Sam could say something, but he was too late. "Why's your face so red? Is it that hot up there?" Sam asked, noticing the look on Dean's face as they all stood in a circle. Dean felt even more embarrassed now that Sam pointed it out, especially since Cas was laughing now. "What's so funny?"
“Yes, we’d love to,” Jack said without hesitation, earning him a glare from Cas. He shrugged, clearly not understanding the situation. Dean licked his lips nervously, glancing at Jack for only a second before looking at Cas again, waiting patiently for him to answer.
Sam looked up, finally noticing Dean standing in the doorway. “Oh, goodmorning,” he greeted, a faint smile lighting up his face. “Yeah, I checked in on you and Cas and saw you were both still out cold. I heard you get in late, so I let you sleep.” He pulled out a chair next to Jack and sat down, digging into his food. “It’s nothing special, but it’s food,” he added with a slight shrug.
“Cas, let him in!” Jack called from inside. Cas sighed, hesitating for a moment longer before moving away from the door to let Dean into the house. The door shut behind them and Jack threw himself at Dean as soon as he saw him, hugging him the same way he did this morning. “I never thought I’d see you again,” Jack mumbled, pulling away quickly as if remembering Cas’ warning about personal space. “You were worried about us? That’s so nice.”
Before any kind of plan could be put into place, or any big decisions could be made, Dean had to talk to Sam and Bobby. He couldn’t do anything without consulting them, because John wasn’t just his dad. He was Sam’s too. And Bobby had known him the longest. There was no possible way Bobby could be in on the whole demon deal, especially with how much he hated John, so Dean trusted him. Once he told them, he could tell the others.
"Shut the fuck up," Dean grumbled, shoving the lube in his pocket so he could stop looking at it and thinking about how he was probably going to be using it with Cas later. "Thanks," he added, reluctantly.
"Oh, cool," Charlie hummed, not really revealing how she actually felt about what Dean had just told them. "So where you going?"
“Jody and I can handle the nest,” Bobby insisted, looking like he probably wouldn’t budge no matter how hard Dean tried to convince him otherwise. “Sam and your boy are right, Dean. It’s not safe for you to be out there right now. You have a lot on your mind.”
Dean snorted, rolling his eyes. Every time Jo talked about Charlie, she had a look on her face, like a lovesick puppy. Charlie was the same way. It was cute, but it was getting kind of old. “Hey, Jo?” Dean wondered, putting some distance between them in case she decided to smack him. “Can I ask you something?”
Claire wiped at her red, watery eyes and took a deep breath, staring at her hands instead of at Dean. Her voice shook as she spoke. "We were together two days ago. We ate dinner together at the park. We're usually so careful about showing affection, but it was our two year anniversary. I didn't see anyone around, so I kissed her. Someone must have seen us. Whoever it was, they probably did something to her. They kidnapped her, or killed her- I don't know, but the next thing I know, I wake up and find a note in her bedroom. All it said was that she had to leave and she wasn't coming back. The handwriting was hers, but it looked off. Almost too perfect, you know what I mean?"
“It doesn’t matter who’s fault it is, Sam,” Dean answered, to avoid the pity. Dean would blame himself no matter what. “I just need to find him. The last time I saw him. . .” he trailed off, remembering how worried Cas was for Dean’s safety. He had told Dean he loved him and Dean brushed him off. Cas knew Dean loved him, sure, but he still didn’t say it back. “Look, just move out of my way so I can find him.”
“That tone,” John snapped. “It shows no respect.” Of course not. Cas didn’t respect John and Dean didn’t expect him to. After everything Dean had told him about his father, why would Cas like the guy? He was the root of all of Dean’s problems. . . well maybe not all of them, but a good portion of them.
"She's very assertive," he agreed. "Bosses me around like she's in charge or something. Her and Charlie both." While their bossiness did get on Dean's nerves, it also pushed him and Cas together, so he couldn't complain too much. He had them to thank for his relationship with Cas, after all.
Dean’s blood was boiling as John left without another glance back. He felt the urge to run after him and throw a good punch, something that would make up for all the hits Dean took as a kid. He knew it wouldn’t solve anything, but he was really itching to just hit something.
"Oh, and one more thing," Jo stopped him as he tried to slide his way past them to leave. She grabbed his shoulder, a mischievous look on her face. "I've planned our next date for tomorrow night."
“Coast was clear,” Dean said with a lopsided grin. “Guess I was pretty quiet after all.” He was pretty proud of himself for that fact, until Cas rolled his eyes at him.
“Glad to hear it,” John hummed, his eyes passing over Dean to land on Cas. Dean shifted uncomfortably, not really wanting his dad to talk to Cas. He didn’t think Cas would say anything about the two of them, but he was still pretty blunt. It was clear he didn’t like John, so there was no telling how he’d respond. “Castiel, how are you adjusting?” he asked, nonchalantly. There was no malice or bad intentions behind his words that Dean could see, but Cas still stood up straighter and narrowed his eyes.
All throughout their meal, Dean kept his eyes to his food, and nowhere else. Besides the occasional glance at Charlie when she spoke to him directly, he wanted to make sure he wouldn't look at Cas. He was formulating some kind of apology in his head. Something he could say to Cas when they got home to make this all go away. He couldn't handle going much longer without Cas talking to him. It would drive him absolutely crazy. So while he ate his food, and sometimes talked to Charlie, he came up with what to say to the angel when they got home. He played the conversation over in his head multiple ways, preparing for all the different ways Cas could react to his apology.
“Ah, fuck, Cas,” Dean gasped, his hips reacting involuntarily to the sudden attention. Cas smirked against Dean’s stomach, pressing another warm kiss below Dean’s bellybutton. His hand moved lazily under the fabric of Dean’s underwear, the friction a little uncomfortable, but nothing compared to the absolute bliss of Cas touching him. “Castiel, please,” Dean mumbled, asking for more, but of what, he wasn’t sure. He wanted Cas to keep touching him just as much as he wanted Cas to fuck him
"Well, he told me you were nice, charming, and easy on the eyes," she shared, squinting as if she were studying him, trying to figure out if he was, indeed, easy on the eyes. He liked to think he was an attractive guy, but not being able to bathe with soap more often than a few times a year really did a number on you. "So far, the only thing I could agree with is that last one. Haven't really charmed me yet and of course, insulting me before you even knew my name isn't something a nice guy would normally do."
"Okay, thanks." He was clearly relieved. "I don't want to tell everyone. Not that I think anyone would be unaccepting or anything, but I don't think anyone needs to know. It's my personal life, you know? And I told you because you guys are so open about it and... well, this isn't a work setting."
The flight was calmer than Dean had expected. After landing, Dean made sure to text Sam, who was supposed to pick him up at the airport. He took the chance to reply to Cas as well, telling him the playlist had helped and the flight had been smooth.
sorry i took so long to post, I was having a real hard time writing and feeling a lot of self-awareness about this chapter.
Cas' eyes went wider, shooting up at Charlie, who didn't even notice him looking over as she kept rambling about their movie night.
Sam got up and headed to the kitchen, still hearing his brother say in the background, "So I'm not getting the famous Ruth roast beef today?"
Karaoke was going to start at that moment, the lyrics showed up on the screen, and Crowley's face lit up with an idea.
"Shiny as hell, dude." Dean had moved over to check the new guitars for a minute but came back shortly.
They moved on to lighter subjects and even remembered stupid funny stuff Sammy did in school that made them all laugh; Christmas together; Bobby showing up for Thanksgiving because he liked to spend time with them even though he had Jody and her family to keep him company. They were Bobby's friends, and they met them a few times when they stayed over, a long time ago.
Coming out of the bus, they found Penny sitting on the stairs of the nearest of the five parked trailers nearby. She waved at them, a small camera strapped on her shoulder as if it were a purse. She was wearing her signature crew jacket, even though it wasn't cold at all. As they approached, she took her earphones out, getting them tangled in the process. "Why don't you be a normal person and buy one of those wireless ones like everybody else?" She looked at Dean quickly, with an upset face, one he knew was half-real half-joking.
"So, you wanna grab a coffee or something? Could use the company.", the suggestiveness was clear in his voice, and yet, Cas seemed not to pick it up. "I don't feel sleepy now." "C'mon, man."
"Oh, sorry. It was hard enough to be able to get you at the airport. They're not letting me have the afternoon off. Come on, I only have the backdoor key."
Michael stops in his tracks, with a stern look on his face. "Yes... You didn't know this was a World Tour or something?"
"Anyway... It's just a crush, right? I'll get over it soon, I always do." Dean made up his mind, standing up. He finished his coffee while Sam glanced at him disapprovingly.
Okay so here is the first chapter! I made this one as a way to introduce the reader to Dean's (alternate) world and how he's living in this story, and I thought I'd make him meet Cas in this one so it wouldn't be too technical or boring for you guys. I hope the language used is accessible for everyone, if there's something you missed I'll be glad to explain what things are in the comments. I don't write much and I'm also not a native English speaker but I had this idea in my head and really wanted to try it out. If no one reads it at least it's taking my mind off things, but if you do read it I hope you enjoyed it <3
Dean smiled to himself. It was good to hear his voice - even if there had only been two days - and things seemed to be running smoothly, albeit stressful, over there.
He popped over to the bathroom to clear the mess he had left behind and returned shortly, getting into bed silently and with utmost care as to not wake Cas - he was used to being quiet in the tour bus but he felt a certain fondness in this situation. Laying down beside Castiel he turned his back on his friend - "just friends, Dean." - careful not to touch him the slightest, trying not to think of the warmth emanating from Cas' body, and whispered "Night Cas." before drifting to sleep himself.
"You bonded? Over Coyote Ugly?" Dean said, incredulously. "Why? Is any of you going around dancing in bars all wet?" He thought that was a pretty good joke but they ignored him completely.
"It's fine. We'll make a pillow barrier if you're uncomfortable. I don't move at all in my sleep so I promise I won't bother you."
He leaves the mug to Sam as he speaks, running back to the bedroom, searching frantically for his phone. He comes back with a desperate look, his phone dead in his hand.
By the time he arrived at the front porch, Sam's ugly car was already in front of the garage, so he had to park near the sidewalk. His plan to help mom make the roast beef had gone down the pipe; at least Bobby hadn't arrived yet.
"Not really.. You took more time than you thought in your little morning tradition. The Load-In is about to start, I want to capture some backstage stuff."
Tickets in hand, he wandered over to the nearest board with all the scheduled departures. Michael had told him the check-in was taken care of, so all he had to do was figure out where to go. The board said his plane was on Terminal 1, and he tried his best to follow the endless signs, passing shop after shop, snack bar after snack bar.
Castiel is making his way through the hotel lobby, back from his city endeavors on the first day off on tour. As he reaches the elevator, he finds Charlie and Penny coming from the Buffet. He waves: though he spent part of the day with them, he hadn't seen them in a few hours because he wanted to explore the city.
The reception clerk had a friendly face and - even though they were about to fall asleep - got up to receive them.
Later that night, Dean met Sam and some of their old high school friends in their usual pub from the old days. As he got inside, the smells of the place hit him, and he went back to the days he and his friends would go there, bringing Sammy along when he was old enough. The place was pretty big - usually, you'd need to book a table - but after being a regular ever since it opened and there were but a few kids hanging around listening to the jukebox, that wasn't needed for them. He shuffled through the groups of people already starting to gather. The regular tables had been moved out of the dancefloor, having only the few booths available for sitting and a small wooden stage lit up. "Yeah! Karaoke night!" Dean thought.
The show ends, the fans start to leave and Dean shoots a well-done look at Cas. The crew starts to pack things up as soon as the fans leave, reversing the Load-In process. Cas and Dean pack up everything in their respective boxes commenting on how good the show was and how well Cas fixed that bass problem without no one in the crowd noticing and how Dean thought he might actually stay permanently if he keeps doing well. After everyone helping load the trucks, there's time to chill a bit. Dean usually goes back to the bus and watches a movie in his bunker, since Penny usually edits the photos at that time and he doesn't have much company until later on the night. This time, since Cas is new he takes the chance to walk around and show him everything there is to see in the bus, explaining there's a bunk on top of his ("I don't like heights, that's why I chose the bottom one") where he can stay. Dean also gives him a tour of the bus, showing him the common area, introducing him to all the crew members on their bus. ("Penny doesn't stay in this bus?", Castiel asked curiously. "She likes to fly, I prefer to stay on the ground.") Later on, Cas gets a text from the Band Manager telling him to meet in the cafeteria. Dean decides to walk there with him, see if Penny is done editing, and wants to get a drink. The cafeteria is packed with everyone working the show, local and touring, hanging out having a few laughs. Dean finds Penny with Kevin, the videographer, and joins them while Cas goes off to find the Band Manager.
"Dean. I don't have time for this. Send me your address." His voice was so assertive, Dean felt a sudden rush of heat flow through his body, and just like that, Castiel hung up. Needless to say, he sent the location right away, just before getting inside the car.
This took immediate effect, as Sam stopped joking around, getting awkward instead. A smug expression revealed itself on Dean's face as he thought, "Yeah, you don't like it anymore when you're the one being mocked, huh?".
by the way, I decided very last minute that instead of jess/sam i prefer eileen/sam because she's just a great character and i'd love to have her, hope no one is too sad about it
"But are you afraid of the plane crashing? Because you know, the rate for car accidents is actually higher."
Dean was pleased to hear this. Not hearing complaints meant Cas was doing an, at least, satisfactory job, and he was friendly, so that meant a lot to everyone so the chances of him getting fired were slim.
Castiel seems a bit hurt from the comment and Dean quickly defends himself, "Not that it looks bad on you... It's just... we gotta be invisible, we can't go around wearing flashing outfits on the job"
After the hectic journey from the plane to the Arrivals at Kansas City Airport, Dean rejoiced for having a light travel bag.
A long waited catching up talk ensued, where Dean found Garth was having twins with his wife - still a dentist; Rowena had a pretty successful recording studio in the city; Crowley was still in his band Kings of Hell, with whom Dean started as a guitar tech, and they were going to record a new single soon; Anna had pursued acting - the only one in school, in fact - and she had been on a few tv shows; Gabriel was, well, Gabriel, so he's always on a bunch of different projects involving every kind of art - right now he was preparing an art exhibit in a local museum.
His reminiscing on old days was cut short when his phone chimed, and he took it out of his pocket to check- it was probably Sam.
The night went on, Dean forgetting he hadn't drunk that much since Sam was in college - which meant he kept drinking. Soon, both Dean and Gabriel decided to take up singing - which everyone else tried to stop - but they didn't care, ending up with an oddly tuned rendition of Too Sexy for my Shirt and several boos from the crowd.
Instant relief crosses Dean's face as he realizes it is true, and he finally admits he might have a little crush.
"I'm sorry to be calling, but I don't have enough time to text. Can you give me your address? I saw something that reminded me of you, and Charlie told me you would like it, so I want to send it to you."
"My.. father.. was a very religious man." Dean gives him a puzzled look. "Castiel was the name of an angel." He brushes it off but finds himself thinking "Well he got that one right." and blushes a little, immediately turning to the guitars again so Castiel doesn't see it. "So what do you need?" he manages to say while starting to string a bright red guitar, trying to sound casual.
"Nah... Don't have time. I barely spend any time at the apartment, and when I have time off, I come to see mom and dad. I just don't think I'll get a pet anytime soon." It made him a little sad - though he snorted - and it showed on his voice, but Dean asking about his lawyer work was enough for him to light up again.
Oh, Crowley's drinking games... One night in the old days, one of these drinking games prompted him and Crowley to end up making out in the boy's bathroom. They never mentioned it again, but Dean is sure he remembers it as well as he.
Hope you're enjoying this and I'm sorry for any mistakes or incoherences, once again, english is not my mother tongue and I always feel a little aware about it <3
One day, in school, he heard another kid talk about Led Zeppelin, and that was the first time he got excited over something in school. He mustered up the courage to talk to the girl, and there was his first friend. Eventually, he got to talking to more schoolmates (pushed by her, of course), and he created a network of rock-loving kids like himself all through the end of high school. At 13, they were trading posters, albums, records, anything they could get their hands on, and that was the age Dean heard about Nirvana and wanted to learn the guitar. Ruth and Harry were happy he was settling in and bought him his first acoustic the same year for Christmas. By the time he was 15, Dean was the school's biggest guitar score maker, learning each of his favorite songs by ear and writing down the chords for his friends; he remembers distinctly getting a rare Metallica flag from a kid who desperately wanted to learn Nirvana's latest hit "Heart-Shaped Box". 1994 was also the year he started asking to go to live shows- and not the one's around town he had been to- big ones, where he could see his heroes live. Unfortunately, that was also the year Kurt Cobain died, which took him back to the grieving stage he hadn't seen in nearly seven years. Then, on top of that emotional turmoil, he started doubting his sexuality after taking refuge in music once again, which took him back to therapy.
Everything set for the show on his end, Dean glimpsed Penny photographing the band behind the scenes for a while and shot her a wink. They've been on tour with this band for years, and she never shut up about having a crush on the lead singer, Taylor. Dean always flirted with her, ever since they met, and it became a joking habit when they grew closer after she joked about "playing for both teams".
The show was finally over, the fans were almost all outside, and everyone in the crew rushed over inside the stage for disassembly. A crowd of people stormed the stage, picking up pedals, cables, amplifiers, microphones, and everything else on it, wiping it clean in minutes. Everyone had their own target which made this a quick, though laborious, process.
"How have you been, son? Glad Michael made you take some days off... Thought you'd never come back, eh?" Harry said in a playful tone, though Dean knew what he was saying was half true.
Sometime later, another text. "I looked him up. If you mean he's the cutest creature to ever live, you are right."
The next morning Dean wakes up with a headache he hadn't had in over 10 years. He gets out of bed, desperately in need of coffee, barely realizing he's at Sam's place. Making his way into the kitchen, he finds his brother, sitting at the small peninsula, already handing Dean a mug.
Dean's stomach had some sort of reaction at how Castiel said his name, or maybe it was just the thought of flying.
They sat down to eat, but not before Dean hugged Bobby, receiving a light pat in the back in return.
"Yes, I will take the month off, but I'll drive. Listen, man, it's not a big deal, just a couple of hours. And I like the music, I like the road, I'll be fine." Dean was rambling about how if he left early he would still be home for dinner when the last part of Michael's sentence suddenly hit him. "Wait... Europe?"
Castiel complied, feeling festive, and went back to find Dean, still with Penny and Kevin (whom Dean had told him about). Recognizing the grin on his face, Penny greeted "Hi chuckles! What are we celebrating?" grabbing a whiskey bottle. "I'm staying on tour!"
"What's it gonna be this time? Wordplay? Truth or Dare? Game apps?" he eyes Sam, who made them all play an awful drinking game from a mobile app once.
Reluctantly, Castiel stored the magazine under his pillow and came down from the bunker. He hoped Dean didn't understand the way he was staring at him was purely sexual but, then again, would a straight guy even wonder about that? He'd probably just find it weird.
Castiel noticed he must have done something wrong and said, "No. I am utterly indifferent to sexual orientation. I'm sorry if I said something wrong." Dean was still taken aback but, upon seeing Castiel's face, he knew the guy wasn't bad after all.
He goes to the bathroom, leaning on Garth, and Sam announces to the others, "Okay, I'm gonna have to take him home. You guys have to help me." Now looking at Crowley, "No bargaining for him to stay."
"Dean!" Cas recognized his voice but barely turned around to greet him, "I'd hug you, but I have to re-string these."
The elevator gets them to the fifth floor pretty quickly. The group walks down the corridor to the two-bed hotel room. Charlie opens the door and Castiel sees it's not too different from his own room. It was an old-fashioned room with pastel walls, two beds in the middle of the room with a window directly in view from the door. The biggest difference from his room was the bathroom, which was bigger, and the television, which he didn't have at all. The beds, in bright white sheets and old-fashioned bedframes, could be brought together, or Charlie and Penny made it seem that way since it was the first thing they did. The bathroom contrasted with the overall look of the room, being more modern and minimalist.
"Not too much." looking up a Dean with a teasing look, Cas smiled and went to set the guitar in a heavy-duty case.
"You know, Cas, for a dude watching pretty girls dance with minimal clothing, you're looking pretty serious there, pal."
Dean was thoroughly confused- why the hell did Cas want his address?? He decided to be cheeky, though, hence the reply: "Why? You coming to visit? ;)"
Dean came back alone - Gabriel stayed back flirting with some random person - smiling dumbly at his phone.
"You're really afraid of flying?" Cas is struggling to say this without laughing, remembering how worried he got about nothing. After a very small "yeah, I told you." and a shameful look, Castiel asks, "Why?"
As they spoke, Dean slightly upset, they walked over a small path around the house, a fenced area filled with flowers that created some privacy.
"All right." Dean wrote the message as Sam went off to pay the bill, pretending he was going to the bathroom.
It was the afternoon before one of the shows in Chicago. Charlie had joined them a while ago, being in charge of merchandising. They had a blast later on the day after the shows, which got tiring pretty fast. It was fun having Charlie around, but Dean was starting to feel worn out from going to sleep so late every night, waking up at ungodly hours every morning. Since she was on merch, Charlie could wake up a little later than the rest of the team and be on her own schedule, loading and unloading the stands, checking inventory throughout the afternoon. Her busiest hours were actually when the doors opened since that's when fans usually bought t-shirts and other memorabilia while still making sure nothing ran out.
He got some flowers nearby and got inside the old cemetery. Reaching his parent's graves, he carefully put the flowers on top of Mary's grave, standing in silence. He didn't know what to say. All he knew was all his words would be for his mother. He felt a lump in his throat as if he was about to cry, and he wouldn't be able to stop.
"Hey, mom. How you doing up there? Sorry it's been so long. I... just want to let you know me and Sammy are doing fine." and he kept on going telling her little stories about the job, about Charlie and Penny and Michael and everyone back on the road, even Cas. And he told her about Sammy and how successful he was now.
The food arrived, and they dug in, Dean making fun of Sam's mimosa - "That's a chick's drink." "Well, I'm not the one with a crush on a guy." as he sipped at with a satisfied grin. - and Dean decided to change the topic once again.
Yes, that last sentence is supposed to break you because this is how I am. I'll try not to add too much suffering because we had enough on the show. But next chapter we'll have some Sammy!
She was wearing a crew jacket that seemed too big for her small figure. Her red hair shone with the sunlight hitting her back while she was putting batteries in the camera. She looked up, recognizing Dean's voice, stating playfully:
Sammy eyes their friends - crying for help - and after about 15 minutes and one last text, Dean finally gives his phone away to Anna.
Dean comes back from the stage and they wait until soundcheck is over to go get something to eat. In the bar area, they find Penny again, who Dean introduces to Castiel. "Hey, Penny! This is Cas, he's the new bass tech. Cas, this is Penny, the photographer." Castiel greets her in a friendly manner and notices Dean called him... Cas? He likes it, it's good to know he's making a good impression on his new co-worker.
"I'm sorry if I made you feel uncomfortable about it. I wanted to make you feel safe, and it came out the opposite way."
"She was doing pretty good, huh? Didn't even faint or anything." Cas answered in a serious voice, "Dean." but broke down laughing right after.
He had to calm himself a little before driving, Cas' voice still tingling in his ear. He felt exactly as the first time he thought of kissing a boy, back in the summer of '94, and just like then, he felt wrong. "Fuck... I can't like Cas. He's my co-worker. I can't do that. And he's straight. Stop it, Dean." Thinking he's a hot piece of ass, or as Penny likes to say it: "piece of the bad pathway" was one thing, another totally different was developing an actual crush on him. Sure, he thought he looked like an angel when he was sleeping, but that doesn't mean anything. The guy's named after an angel, what's he supposed to think?
Dean peered over with a skeptic frown, adding, "Yeah, but Ben's gonna love that one. And Mark? Has he seen his new bass?"
Sam ordered another round for them, and Dean asked for a whiskey on the rocks - he was feeling like drinking something strong after the cemetery visit. He falls into conversation with Rowena.
Castiel couldn't believe what was being asked of him. Of course he could handle it, this was his dream for so long, ever since he got his first gig after his father left him. "I want nothing more."
They kept enthusing about the new gear as children with new toys on Christmas day and before long everything was ready for Load-Off.
Charlie presses play, and they call room service for food. They watch most of the movie when Cas gets very serious.
i just want to address the events happening in the us and syria right now: it's really hard to see all of this unfold while being here unable to help in any way but i hope you guys are staying safe <3
While Dean rummaged through his old records, he remembered how he had acquired them. Back then, he had been going to therapy for a few years, so making friends in school was becoming attainable, even after all the trauma he had been through. He finally felt he could talk to his parents to some degree, which he hadn't been able to when they were adopted, too afraid they would hurt him, but mostly Sammy. He had been responsive to music, and that was when Harry gifted him the record player, taking him to a record store so he could choose a few records. He knew a few covers from the cassettes on the Impala (which he had inherited except he didn't know yet); he chose Led Zeppelin and Metallica as his first and buried himself in the music, hoping it would take the pain away.
Dean waited, but as he didn't get an answer, he decided to get on with his afternoon plans - he had already spent enough time thinking about his childhood for one day.
"He had a rough few days in the beginning but he came over to our room and we watched Coyote Ugly and we bonded over it."
Dean's eyes shot up, a guilty look on them, wondering how his little brother knew Cas' eyes were as blue as the sky. He gets an amused smile as a response, and, watching Sam preparing himself to keep with the torment, immediately retaliated, "Oh, you're one to talk. How about Eileen? Your co-worker? Is she dreamy?"
Dean took advantage of the small holiday to get some more sleep than he did on tour. His body didn't love the idea, though, and he was up a mere two hours later than usual. Resigned, he went downstairs to find some breakfast and found Ruth already pacing in the kitchen, busy with various small things.
"Dude, that's a lot of times. Have you ever heard the song?" Sam looks horrified, but Dean, Gabriel, and Rowena are in right away. Anna is reluctant but joins in while Garth and Sam stay back, watching this horrible, horrible decision unfold.
"I'll walk with you. Listen, I don't want those tickets. Thank you, but it's fine.", though he's struggling to keep up, he doesn't let it show.
But Castiel is sound asleep on his side, the blanket barely covering him, curled up next to the still open journal Dean knew so well. He stops at the sight, smiling to himself and thinking how sweet it is that his journal has become Cas' light reading. Unable to help himself, he walked over to the opposite side of the bed, pulled the blankets over Cas, and tucked him in slightly so he wouldn't feel cold. Hearing his soft breaths, Dean couldn't help but to imagine what it would be like falling asleep to that sound (instead of the usual eighteen indistinguishable snores) every night.
Cas goes back to his room, only one floor away. He gets ready for bed and goes to find the box Dean left him. He grabs it, getting near the bedroom window, and looks at it in the moonlight, hoping Dean is having a good time with his family. The words "For Cas" written hastily on a scrap of paper, a journal sits inside. It has a leather cover with the name Dean messily carved in a corner. Cas opens it again, notes of the job carefully written over the years since Dean's first experience in a small gig in Lawrence until today. On the last written page, Dean scribbled, "Hope this helps while I'm away."
"Hey, don't start making assumptions. We all get along great at work. It's like family. You know that."
"He seems lovely, honey. You getting along well, then?". He noticed a hint of curiosity, the same as when he had his first boyfriend.
Castiel glanced at where Dean was, already getting his hands dirty, while admiring the new instrument.
He decided to get dressed instead of dwelling on thoughts like these, that would lead nowhere but false hope and maybe even despair.
The show was set to start three hours later, though they wouldn't have more than one hour of free time. Michael passed them next to a water dispenser and quickly said, "Dean, I have your ticket for Kansas tomorrow, it's at 11." When Dean tried to protest, his boss was long gone, rushing around, his blue suit contrasting with his dark skin.
They walked outside the airport, Sam trying to help Dean with his single bag, which he refused. They immediately started to catch up, asking each other so many questions that it was hard to understand the answers.
Glancing back at the passenger seat, he added, "Listen, I'm not going to tell him. It's just a crush. It'll go away soon."
Charlie and Penny looked at each other guiltily, then back at Cas, who tilted his head in confusion. Finally, Charlie broke the silence:
As they reach the stage, instruments in hand, they notice the sound techs on stage talking to walkie-talkies, presumably to those in Control Room. Dean says hello to everyone as he hands the guitars to be plugged in and watched Cas copy his movements proficiently. They both get backstage and see the band get up, the lead singer and guitarist greet Dean as they get to their positions. The band plays a few songs, stopping sometimes for adjustments and start playing around with each other and the crew members. Castiel thinks to himself this is exactly where he wants to be and hopes he gets to stay long-term.
He told them about a story involving a couple of beers and a group of old friends he got together for a barbecue at home.
The sound came in loud - too loud - which made Dean reflexively separate his phone from his ear as far as his arm could manage. Even then, he could hear a happier version of I Want You To Want Me play in the background. Was Cas at a party? He heard a door slam and the sound fade as Castiel screamed over the music, "Dean?"
After walking around for what seemed like thirty minutes, Dean finally found Cas in the bus eating a PB&J on the top bunker. Since Cas first came on the tour, there were only a couple of bunkers available one of them right on top of Dean's, which he offered right away. He figured Cas was a quiet guy, and he missed the company of sharing a bedroom. Though, when you're on tour on a bus, you don't have much privacy anyway.
He's reading the band's setlist, choosing the guitars (and basses) for each song, preparing to tune them and restring each of them when he hears a deep but calm voice say "Hello, Dean". Confused, he looks back and sees a handsome man, about the same height as him, with mesmerizing blue eyes and dark hair, looking at him expectedly like he was waiting for something.
Cas is very silent, but Penny keeps rambling on, about how they could get bi and lesbian flags and each carry one on the shoulder like a superhero cape. Charlie and Penny are joking around until Penny catches Cas' eye.
"Fly. On a plane." ("Man, this dude can't possibly think I'm gonna grow wings and fly does he?"), Dean thinks. Castiel starts laughing in a warm, cute way that has Dean feeling butterflies, though he quickly gets disconcerted because he doesn't understand what Cas is laughing at.
Grabbing a piece of paper, he scribbles some words and carefully leaves a small box near Cas' pillow where he is still sleeping. Dean takes a moment to take in his sweet features, "He looks like an angel when he's sleeping."
"I could. . ." Dean started, blushing furiously as he met Cas' eyes. "I could help tire you out," he offered. Cas cocked his head to the side, oblivious to the innuendo. "Cas, come on, you know what I mean," Dean chuckled nervously.
“And leave Charlie all alone?” Cas answered, sounding disappointed as if he would consider Dean’s idea otherwise. “I can’t risk her being on her own. If John-” he started, cutting himself off with a quick glance at Dean.
“Dean?” someone said softly. Dean took a deep breath, his hand slipping away from the door as he turned to look at everyone. Kaia was the one who said his name, half hiding in the doorway as if checking to make sure it was safe to come out. “Is he gone?”
John led Dean past the walls, deep into the trees. While they walked, it was dead silent. Their boots crunched the leaves under their feet, but John didn’t talk and Dean wasn’t about to start casual conversation when the last thing he wanted was to make John think everything was back to normal between them. Dean was still pissed and John had to know that.
"I'm starving," Dean said, winking as Cas easily caught on to the double meaning. He'd gotten quicker about catching on to Dean's dirty jokes over the past week, but Dean couldn't decide if that was a good thing, or if he was just corrupting the poor, innocent angel. Considering how often Cas had his hands down Dean's pants, Dean was pretty sure it was corruption at its finest. Cas didn't seem to mind, so Dean didn't voice any complaints.
Finally getting a good look at Dean, Castiel saw how his hair fell slightly on his face, how his shirt looked wrapped around his waist, how his muscles peeked through the thin sweater, and he was speechless for a solid minute. "Will you stop staring weird at me and do me the favor?"
Dean is up earlier than everyone else on the tour bus. The soft sunlight comes inside through the small windows while Dean shuffles around, finishing the last-minute travel preparations. He's already dressed, his coffee long taken, and his clothes are finally packed, not so neatly, in his bag.
"You could have helped me put the groceries away, Harry." She said while hitting him jokingly with a kitchen rag.
Dean is visibly nervous so Charlie tries to calm him down by telling him stories about the past month. She starts telling him about how Cas got along with everyone great and how people started to like him in the first week because of how much he went out of his way to help everybody. A staff member takes each of their bags as they are talking in the terminal, waiting for their turn to get inside the plane.
He took the chance to text Castiel too, "Thanks for the gift. I'm gonna get you one of baby Yoda. He looks just like you, too."
"Well, then, angel wings, good for you. It's not really helping me out. And I just found out I'm gonna be doing Europe too, so, if you got a suggestion, I'm all ears."
Dean walks past the trucks and sees the local crew ready to start unloading them. He finds the guitar area and gets ready to set everything up in its place. Starting to see some crew members pushing huge black plywood hard cases with aluminum sides, he rushed over and asked what they were carrying. "Amps" "That way", he pointed. Right after, two men were pushing a set of boxes, similar to the last one but a slightly different shape and division. They affirmed "Guitars", and Dean immediately took over them, pushing the box back to his area. Some other gear came around and he helped the crew members assort each box to its designated areas as fast as possible.
They said their goodbyes, Dean went through the check-in, and had a quiet flight. He listened to a newly made playlist, as to avoid thinking about Cas.
Dean knew, all too well. Sam seemed to want to avoid the subject so as to not hurt Dean's feelings, but he also seemed to be really excited about the possibility of doing the thing. Dean asked what he intended to do specifically, trying to encourage him. He had been dealing with it for years, after all.
The morning was spent fairly calmly, Dean helping his parents around the house, dancing from the kitchen to the garden like he was in a song.
"It's not that. I'm comfortable with my sexuality now, thanks. But I can't like Cas, dude. He works with me, we do everything together back there. It would ruin our friendship."
Usually, the last day of a US leg meant it was the last day of work for Dean. This year, though, the band had a fair amount of concerts in Europe, mostly festivals, and the boys (and Taylor) asked Michael to keep some of this crew plus the new one overseas.
Seeing Dean's agitation starting to grow, Castiel takes his issue seriously and offers some advice. "You can read or listen to music during the flight. Do you have anything that calms you down?"
Roughly an hour passed, Dean walking around the shops, wasting time before the boarding call when he got a text.
Dean was confused to see double the amount of gear they usually had. Their corner was extraordinarily full of guitars, amplifiers, pedals, and basses, some still in boxes, others already out and ready to be re-strung. Dean grabbed the first bass he saw, a gorgeous matte black one, that Cas had presumably prepped.
They had lunch after Dean helped prepare it, and afterward, he decided to go around for a ride with Baby. He had a shower in the bathroom connected to his bedroom. It was a lucky thing he and Sam had had separate bedrooms growing up. He felt his brother would become fed up with him from playing guitar so often and decorating the entire room with so many posters. The room still exhibited a great collection of wall "art" collected from different rock magazines over the years. As he got dressed, he found himself looking at Jimmy Page, James Hetfield, several concert banners he had traded with kids at school from all the classics like Black Sabbath, Van Halen, Iron Maiden, and Motörhead. He had two guitars in the wall, so many more in his little apartment, which he used mostly for storage- he liked staying over at his parent's too much. His beat-up record player was still in good shape, no matter how many years; it has actually been Harry's before, and he passed it to Dean, who, instead of listening to Chopin and Mozart, blared another type of classics.
"You don't know what happened," Dean cut him off, his chest tightening. "There's a reason I never talk about it, Sam. I don't want to.
"Our dad died ten years ago," Sam retorted, checking for bystanders before shoving John outside. Luckily, the backyard of Bobby's house was right at the edge of the trees, so nobody in town would see them. That would demand an explanation, which Dean couldn't give anyone until after John was gone.
"Hello, Dean," he greeted groggily, making Dean freeze. He felt his face heating up already, knowing Cas had just caught him staring. Lucky for him, Cas didn't mention anything about the staring, or the red cheeks. Instead, he just pulled the blanket closer to his chin, turning over on his side, still looking at Dean expectantly.
"Holy shit," Dean laughed, trying to imagine Jack doing anything so badass. "The kid who laughs at Sam's stupid jokes, who sings along horribly to AC/DC in the car, who cried when I accidentally stepped on a bug the other day. . . that kid shoved the devil into Hell?" He couldn't believe the kid actually had it in him. Maybe when he had powers, he was more of a badass.
“Dean,” Cas breathed, hips slapping against Dean’s skin as he let go of Dean’s shoulder, allowing him to sink back into the mattress. Dean turned his head to the side so he could breath, biting his hand to keep himself from crying out and waking up the whole fucking neighborhood. “You feel amazing,” Cas praised him, leaning over top of him to reach Dean’s hand, wrapping his fingers around Dean’s wrist. “You’re doing so good too, keeping quiet,” he rumbled, making Dean moan just from that deep, sexy voice. “Let me help,” Cas offered, moving Dean’s hand behind his back before dragging a thumb over Dean’s lips.
Dean spent the night unable to sleep much at all. He had a nice comfy bed all to himself, which had been a god send the past few nights. He had no trouble falling asleep before, but now he couldn't sleep for longer than an hour without waking up. His arm was throbbing, his chest was tight, and his head was pounding. He kept thinking about Cas, the way he wouldn't speak to Dean after that interaction with Jo. Could it be that Cas was upset about Dean's date? He really didn't think it would bother Cas because he didn't think Cas felt the same about him. Sure, they had moments, but that was just Cas being nice, right? The angel didn't realize that his actions came off as flirtatious because he hadn't been in those kinds of situations before. Dean didn't blame him, but it just made things so much more confusing.
"We'll see," Dean played along, glancing up at the rest of the hunters as they started splitting off into groups. Sam was standing next to Jody, probably who he was partnered up with for the day. Claire and that skinny guy, Garth, were with them as well. There were six others, including Bobby and John, but Dean couldn't name the other four. "Looks like it's time to go," Dean said, glancing at Jo subtly as she smiled up at him.
Dean vaguely remembered having a similar conversation to that, but he was too proud to admit he was wrong. He looked down at his food, stabbing an egg with his fork. "I don't remember saying that," he mumbled, shoving the food in his mouth as Cas rolled his eyes.
Dean heaved himself up onto his feet again, his chest tight with anger as he turned around and swung his fist into the trunk of the tree. The pain spread throughout his good arm after the third swing, his knuckles split open and bleeding as he hit the wood over and over again. He braced his injured arm against the tree and swung his other hand again, connecting with the same spot on the tree, already stained dark with his blood. Once it became unbearable, he stopped himself. He didn’t feel any better, not by a long shot, but he did find a sense of twisted comfort in staring down at his bloodied knuckles. If he didn’t think too hard, he could pretend he did that to himself by beating John senseless.
Sam nodded, glancing to their friends still huddled around Cas' bed. Dean would have preferred to leave them out of this, but he had a feeling that wasn't going to happen. Someone had to stay behind with Kaia to make sure she was safe, but Jo was going to want to come.
Dean raised an eyebrow. Why the hell was John going around talking him up to people he didn't even know? Dean turned to glare at his dad, but the man had walked away, briefing the others on what their tasks would be for the day. With no one to turn to but Jo, Dean sighed, playing along. "Oh yeah? What were you expecting?" he wondered.
They walked home together the same way, Sam and Cas chatting about books Sam read to pass the time, while Dean and Charlie walked behind them. This time, Jack walked beside Dean, rambling on about all the things he was looking forward to doing now that they were here. Charlie was very helpful in giving Jack even more great ideas, while Dean talked about all the trouble he got into as a young kid, leaving out the parts where John made his life a living hell, of course.
“Uh, sure,” Cas answered, cocking his head to the side as Charlie rushed out of the room and slammed the door behind her, leaving Dean alone with Cas, finally. “That was odd, wasn’t it?” Cas wondered, staring at the spot where Charlie had just been in confusion for a few seconds before grabbing the pain pills to shake into Dean’s hand.
“No,” Dean cut him off, before he could even ask such a stupid question. “God, no, Cas- that was amazing. You are amazing,” he breathed out, his emotions confusing him even more now than when he hadn’t told Cas the truth. This was like an emotional form of constipation, or something. If he wasn’t so fucked up in the head, it would be so easy to just get it all out, tell Cas everything he wanted to tell him. But he couldn’t, so he had to just get over it and do what he could to keep the angel around.
After Dean had tossed the dirty tissues into the trash, he helped Cas get his pants back up over his hips, and then they just laid there in silence. Dean held Cas with both arms, just like he had when he was helping Cas breathe earlier. He rested his head on top of Cas' and while they sat there, Cas matched Dean's breathing as a way to make sure he stayed calm. Suddenly, Cas ripped himself out of Dean's grip, a guilty realization washing over him. Dean raised an eyebrow, looking as if Cas had just woken him up. He probably had, considering how quiet Dean had gotten, but he couldn't help it.
"She's home," Jack confirmed. "I asked her if she wanted to spend the day together to take her mind off things, but she said she wanted to be alone."
"Just wanted to see how I was doing," Dean said, shifting uncomfortably in his hard chair. "She wanted to make it up to me, or whatever, so she's taking me out tomorrow night." He didn't look at Cas as he admitted this, mostly because he couldn't bear to see that expressionless gaze, like Cas didn't care at all. He wanted Cas to be angry, jealous, or something. Anything to indicate that Cas felt the same things Dean did, and that Dean wasn't imagining everything they had shared so far. But he didn't look because he didn't want to risk not seeing that face.
This time, Cas didn't move closer. He nodded, pressing his lips into a firm line. "Okay, Dean," he said finally. "I hope your date goes well," he added, genuinely, and that made it hurt Dean even more. Before Dean had a moment to change his mind, Cas was gone.
Cas jumped in for Dean, thankfully, and came up with something to get Dean off the hook. “He was telling me about his date,” Cas supplied, as Charlie narrowed her eyes suspiciously. Dean was starting to regain his senses, enough to sit up a little. “I don’t think it’s more important than Dean’s health, but he wanted to tell me how it didn’t go as planned. I am his closest friend, after all, so he always confides in me.”
After dinner, that was when Dean and Cas had the talk about not sharing a bed, even if they wanted to. Dean wanted to tell Sam eventually, because he knew his brother would be supportive. He just wasn't ready yet. Too many people already knew and the more people he told, the worse the situation got. John would hurt anybody who crossed him and anyone protecting Dean was considered an accessory. Sam would gladly take a hit for Dean, but Dean wouldn't let him if he had anything to do with it. Right now, keeping him out of the loop was the best thing for him, and for Dean.
Thanks to everyone who's been reading and commenting, I appreciate it so much :) The updates will probably stop being so frequent soon because of my exams and group projects for school coming up, but I'll do my best to update once a week
Jo's smile faltered as she looked at Dean, their pace slowing slightly. "If you don't want to, it's fine," she said, though her tone conveyed the exact opposite.
Cas cocked his head to the side, letting the question sink in, like it took effort to answer it. The question was simple, and one Dean felt like he didn't even need to ask. But this was Cas, so there were a lot of things Dean didn't feel like he should have to explain, but he ended up doing it anyways. "You were in here," Cas replied, narrowing his eyes as he studied Dean's expression. "There wasn't enough room for two people on the couch, so naturally, I took the space on the floor."
"I would, Dean, but I wanted to read this book Sam gave me," he answered, smiling apologetically as he held up the book in his hand. "Maybe later!" he promised, already disappearing down the hall to his room.
. Dean was overwhelmed with how much he loved Cas like this, letting him see Dean at his most vulnerable. He had never trusted anyone this much. Never loved anyone like he loved Cas.
Dean felt Cas' hand leave the warmth of his own, instead grabbing onto his arm, just below his shoulder. Dean leaned into the touch, bringing their faces closer. If Dean turned to look at him like this, there was a good chance their lips would brush. So, Dean stared straight ahead at the wall as Cas whispered, "You had to grow up too fast." Dean swallowed, the painful memories swimming around in his head as he nodded. "I'm sorry you had to go through all of this alone."
Dean was trying not to get angry and frustrated, but sometimes Cas was the hardest person to talk to, aside from Jack. Those two didn't understand anything unless it was spelled out for them. "No, Cas," Dean grumbled. "Together, like, romantically. When people sleep together, it's implied that they share a romantic relationship."
Suddenly, Cas took off walking towards a store they'd never stepped foot in before. It looked like an old thrift store, but at this point, everything looked old and smelled like it had been used. Dean started to protest, but Cas walked pretty fast and Dean had no choice but to rush after him. He couldn't leave the guy alone, as much as he really didn't want to go clothes shopping right now. "Cas, what the hell is this about?" Dean demanded, catching the door as Cas flung it open without holding it. He followed Cas inside and they had finally slowed down to a normal speed as Cas raked his eyes over the racks of men's clothing.
"Oh," Dean started, taking a second to catch on to what he meant. His face turned a deep shade of red. Of course, they had been holding hands this whole time. Dean was just blind. "Of course," Dean agreed, giving them a friendly smile. "Well, uh, Cas and I have an extra room at our place, or there's an entire empty house at the end of the street if you prefer. It might be a while before you get any roommates in that case."
“Next door,” Jo answered, leading the way over to Charlie’s house. Dean followed without question, Cas on his heels. From the front porch, Dean could hear his father’s gruff voice and a couple other deep voices. Dean didn’t bother knocking, barging inside with determination.
"No," Dean exhaled, squeezing the angel's hand again, knowing he had to let go. "Thanks, man," he added with a small smile, the best he could manage. Even though it was his choice, he still sighed at the loss of warmth tangled around his own fingers. Cas watched him as they walked, but Dean didn't meet his worried stare. He could just feel Cas looking at him, worrying about him, something he wasn't used to. They walked the last few feet to the house, Dean's feet heavy as he ascended the steps. He wanted to take back what he said and stay outside forever, their hands intertwined.
"Dean, I wanted to mention," John said suddenly, yanking Dean back to the reality of where he was, the chattering of voices filling his ears again. He looked at his dad, raising his eyebrows impatiently. They had somehow drifted farther from Sam and Bobby, now just the two of them standing there, in their own little bubble. Dean tried to ignore how uncomfortable that felt. "I don't want you and Sam sticking together during these hunts. The two of you rely too much on each other and it'll get one of you killed. So I paired you up with one of my best gals," he said, and Dean felt the anger threatening to come up from deep in his gut. Where did he get the nerve, separating him and Sam like that? After Dean raised the kid, when Dean himself was only a kid. After Dean protected Sam for ten years while they nearly got their brains eaten by freaking zombies for god's sake. Why did John freaking Winchester get to decide they relied too much on each other?
"W-What?" Dean stammered, his heart hammering. There was another knock on the door, louder this time. It didn't even phase Dean. He was too focused on Cas' words, still playing in his ear.
Dean ran his hands over the wheel with a happy sigh, listening to the engine start up. It had been weeks since he was behind the wheel and it felt nice, especially with Cas beside him. This car used to be Dean’s happy place, the only time he ever felt like he could be himself. When John would stumble home drunk after closing a case, or when he would get violent and Dean would have to leave the house, that was where he went. Sometimes, he had to steal the keys after John fell asleep, but it was always worth the risk to be able to drive back roads at night and sit in empty parking lots, just listening to music and having space to breathe.
Dean trailed behind, Cas at his side. Out of nowhere, he felt a hand wrap around his own, but he didn't question it this time. Instead, he basked in Cas' reassuring words, just barely a whisper, only for Dean's ears. "We're going to be okay." Dean believed him, even if only for a moment.
“Me too, Dean,” Cas smiled, dragging Dean closer to kiss his lips gently. They stayed there awhile longer, pressed side to side, Dean leaning against Cas’ shoulder. Despite the looming disaster of Dean having to talk to his dad, he was happy in that moment. There was an innocent girl missing and Claire was probably in danger of being next, but if Dean thought about it too much, he got so angry he couldn’t think about anything except beating the shit out of someone. So he let himself be happy for a brief moment with Cas’ arm secure around his shoulder.
“I’m fine,” Dean croaked, his mouth dry as he tried to wet his chapped lips. He coughed violently, everything tensing and aching as he did. “Just help her,” he wheezed, closing his eyes as he held his arm and tried to think about anything but the pain. In the end, he found himself thinking about Cas and those pretty blue eyes. If anything brought him comfort, it was his perfect angel. It was enough to calm him down and lull him into a near sleep state, but he couldn’t fall asleep even if he wanted to. He was too worried about Kaia.
He moved almost in slow motion, concealing the blade under his arm, his feet taking him towards the sound. There was a cluster of trees just a few feet in front of him, close enough together to hide something the size of a skinwalker, as long as it was transformed in it's canine state. Dean held his breath, stalking closer to the subtle shuffling of leaves behind the trees. Another step, and another, almost there. . .
After a while, Dean sighed and pushed himself away from Cas, grimacing at the dried, sticky mess between them. He should have cleaned them up when Cas mentioned it earlier, but he was content for the time being. Cas chuckled at Dean's expression, easing the man off his lap to get up and tuck himself back into his pants. Dean laid back on the bed, watching Cas move across the room. "Are you coming back?" Dean found himself asking, even though they both agreed they shouldn't spend their nights together on account of Sam and Jack catching them.
"He's still working," Charlie told him with a vague gesture towards the medical building. "I told him I would stay late and finish inventory, but he insisted. I'm sure he'd love your help so he can get to dinner some time tonight."
"Since last night," Dean answered, eyes landing on Cas as he spoke, hoping to convey to Cas that he could sit down next to Dean. Standing around like that was getting a little awkward. He gestured for Cas to come closer, kicking out the chair next to him, only looking away once he sat down.
Dean liked teasing, but he was dying with anticipation here, so he forced himself to keep things moving. He scooted even closer, until his knees were pressed up against the bottom of the couch and his face was inches from Cas' hard, leaking cock. With his one slightly shaking hand, Dean tugged Cas' boxers down his thighs, maneuvering awkwardly until they were off completely, discarded somewhere off to the side. Dean couldn't help the small moan that escaped his throat, but it made Cas blush, so he wasn't too embarrassed. Dean loved seeing Cas like this, hard and leaking all for him. He licked his lips as his fingers wrapped around Cas' length, giving him slow and gentle strokes.
"Nothing," Dean sighed, rubbing at his eyes, even though he had successfully avoided the tears. He still felt like he had let his guard down too much. He had told Cas more than he needed to hear. Enough for Cas to pity Dean, but not understand him. "Nevermind. I'm just being stupid." He stood up without thinking about how close Cas stood, nearly headbutting him in the process. Cas stumbled backwards, catching himself easily as Dean blinked slowly, watching him. "I- um, I need some air," he stammered, excusing himself.
Dean stood up reluctantly, even though he really wanted to stay with Cas, maybe even sleep next to him, just to be close to him. The couch just wasn’t big enough for both of them, especially with Dean’s throbbing arm that would probably keep him awake all night. He gave Cas one last longing glance, but the angel had fallen back into a deep sleep, already snoring again as Dean smiled down at him. Tomorrow, he’d probably have to tell Cas everything he just said all over again. At least now he had practice.
“Just keep your voice down,” Cas whispered against his ear before nipping at his earlobe, sending shivers down Dean’s spine. “You can do that, can’t you?” he asked, scraping his teeth across sensitive skin on Dean’s neck, making Dean forget how to speak at all. Cas didn’t stop kissing him, working his hand over Dean’s swollen cock in a way that had Dean seeing stars.
“Are you okay?” Jody wondered, pulling away from Claire to look at her better. “Now that she’s safe, is everything better?”
“Claire, you need to stay away from him,” Dean cut in suddenly, his heart hammering in his chest. Claire’s features were taken over by confusion as she stared at Dean, waiting for an explanation. “Look, he’s probably the one who did this to Kaia. He-” he stopped, the words catching in his throat. He couldn’t get it out. Suddenly, Cas was standing, striding over to Dean to put a soothing hand on his back. Just having him near gave Dean a breath of fresh air. “Something happened when I was younger and my dad really hurt me, Claire. If he knew about me and Cas, he’d kick us out, or worse. There’s no telling what else he’s capable of.” Cas continued rubbing Dean’s back, working his thumb into the tight muscles near Dean’s neck.
They regrouped at the front gates, as usual, and Jo gave Dean a wink that only he could see before putting on an act. She stumbled over to where John and Dean were standing, her face pale as she held her stomach. “I don’t feel so good,” she mumbled, leaning into Dean’s side for support. “I don’t think we should have that dinner tonight, John. I thought I was over that stomach bug, but I was wrong. I need to sleep it off.”
John narrowed his eyes at Dean, then glanced back at the door to the room Claire had disappeared into. “So I heard,” he replied calmly, eyes gradually drifting back to Dean. “What does that have to do with you?”
“You’re so beautiful,” Cas breathed, just as Dean opened his eyes to watch Cas wrap his lips around Dean’s cock.
“That’s gonna cost you extra, by the way,” Cas deadpanned, tossing the soiled towels in the trash can near the bed. Dean stared back at him, speechless. How could he be so casual about this? He just touched Dean’s dick. The dude could be a little more. . . well, Dean couldn’t exactly place the feeling in his chest, but still. Cas was perfectly normal right now, and Dean was internally- and probably externally- freaking the fuck out. “You okay?” Cas asked suddenly, slotting himself between Dean’s legs again, this time to help him yank his pants back up over his hips. Once they were zipped and buttoned again, Dean let himself look Cas in the eye. He was wearing a very concerned look. “Dean. . . do you regret-”
“Fine,” Sam said through his teeth, moving closer to the side of the house before crouching down so Dean could get on his shoulders. They used to do this a lot as kids, but Dean was the one who held Sammy on his shoulders. They’d sneak into abandoned houses to get away from John, or sneak back into the motels they were staying at after John was asleep. Back then, Sam wasn’t taller than Dean.
"You're supposed to be sleeping," Dean chastised, striding across the length of the room until he was next to the bed. He dropped down onto the mattress, still sitting as he stared at Cas, waiting for him to explain.
“Okay,” Cas whispered, nodding as if he knew exactly what Dean wanted. He sat up on his knees, pulling Dean closer, throwing his legs over Cas’ shoulders. Dean’s breath caught in his throat when Cas wrapped a hand around Dean’s cock, stroking him as he thrusted into Dean faster and harder, sending Dean over the edge, his head spinning. He couldn’t think or speak- he could only feel Cas fucking him, touching him desperately, both of them close. “Dean, come for me,” Cas said, meeting Dean’s eyes as Dean watched him slowly come unglued. Dean was already on the edge and hearing Cas talk to him like that, it was the last thing he needed.
For a moment, they just stared at each other. Cas had shed his coat, now sitting in his dress pants, button up, and that new tie Dean had given him this morning. He had his hands on the tie, trying to unknot it, but his fingers stilled when Dean walked into the room. Finally, Cas sighed. "I can't get this loosened," he mumbled, looking down at his hands.
“I’m more than a demon, Castiel,” Crowley scoffed, stuffing his hands in his pockets again as he grinned at Dean. “Former King of the Crossroads, current King of Hell, at your service.” He pulled one hand from his pocket, extending it towards Dean for a handshake. Dean didn’t move. Crowley hesitated a moment before awkwardly dropping his hand to his side. “Germaphobe?” he joked.
“Girlfriend?” Charlie blurted out, confused for a moment before the confusion turned into anger. “Wait, do you think somebody hurt her because they knew she was gay? God, I fucking hate this homophobic neighborhood,” she growled, scaring Dean a little bit with the violence in her eyes. He’d never seen her so angry before. “Of course we’ll help you, Claire. We won’t stop until we find her.”
"Just for fun," Cas repeated with a breath that sounded slightly like a laugh. "Maybe I wanted to see what you look like in a suit," he teased, circling back to the front of Dean, who stood there with a red face, though he'd never admit Cas being this close to him made his cheeks flush. Cas slowly pushed Dean's arms back down to his sides, stepping back to admire the fit. "Hm, maybe some dress pants?" he suggested, already thumbing through the different styles of pants hanging on the wall to the right of them.
Dean started the tour with the kitchen, a smaller setup than before, but necessary since the protection spell only reached so far. He explained to Cesar and Jesse how breakfast and dinner worked, which was pretty simple. Grab your food and go home, or stick around and hang out like some people liked to do. Next, he showed them where the new medical building was, in the middle of the block. They had to make a few trips to relocate everything from the old one, but it all worked out in the end. Finally, Dean took them to the empty house at the end of the block where they would be staying.
, or whatever,” Dean croaked, pressing the heel of his hand into his temple. “We’re still friends. I just- I couldn’t lie to her.”
“If you’re sure,” Cas said, his small smile grateful. He had finished his plate, every last bite, and pushed it away from him with a small sigh. “Thank you both for all of this. Jack and I should be going now, while we have the daylight.” He excused himself from the table, hanging Dean’s bag from his shoulder as he gestured for Jack to follow him. The kid had finished his food a while ago, having scarfed it down like it was the first time he'd eaten in months.
“She’s hurt,” Dean said as Kaia groaned in her sleep, her head falling against Dean’s chest. The bruises were less prominent in the dark, but it was impossible to miss the blood staining her face. “Can you help her?”
“I liked where that was going,” Cas admitted, taking a step back as he pulled a stool closer to the bed and sat down. Their knees touched as Cas scooted closer, but there was still somehow too much space between them. Dean’s heart sank, thinking he had done something wrong. If Cas liked where it was going, why did he want to stop? What did Dean do? He knew he fucked things up a lot, sometimes without even meaning to, so his heart was racing again as he worked himself up. “You just have a lot on your mind,” Cas continued, breaking Dean out of his own thoughts.
“It’s really me,” Dean promised. “I don’t have any holy water or silver to prove it, Cas. I’m sorry.” He hoped Cas would believe him on trust alone, but he understood if not. Dean wouldn’t have been quick to trust anybody either. Cas continued staring through the crack in the door, as if deciding whether or not to trust Dean. “Look, I couldn’t sleep. I was worried you guys would get into trouble. I had to look for you. . .” he trailed off, embarrassing himself. His face felt hot, but he refused to look away from those gentle eyes. He knew Cas would let him in, he just had to give him a minute.
Dean cleared his throat, tightening his hand around Cas' fingers despite the pain shooting up his arm. "Kaia, this is- um, my boyfriend, Castiel," he introduced him, the word feeling funny coming out of his mouth. He hadn't been in a relationship in over ten years, and he sure as hell never called anyone his boyfriend. Cas felt like more than that anyways, but he didn't want things to get confusing for Kaia, or for himself for that matter.
Cas seemed to be satisfied by Dean’s answer this time, pressing a soft kiss to the small of Dean’s back before licking a hot stripe over Dean’s hole, sending Dean to another fucking planet or something. Dean sucked in a sharp breath as Cas’ tongue lighting circled his hole, just teasing. Dean made some noises he’d never be able to repeat as Cas’ tongue slowly worked him open, dipping inside him just a little at first. As Dean’s moans became louder, only muffled by the pillow, Cas licked into him deeper, taking his time to make sure Dean felt comfortable the whole time. Dean’s whole body was trembling as Cas dug his fingers into Dean’s cheeks, spreading him wider as he sucked and licked, the noises alone making Dean see stars. If Cas kept at this, Dean would come without even touching his dick, which would be something new. He had no doubt Cas had figured this out as well, from the way he had Dean shaking and moaning into the pillow.
