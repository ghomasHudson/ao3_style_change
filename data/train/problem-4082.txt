“I know, it will probably hurt something else but it won’t kill you. It’s called an ineffable bond and I have two. I have one with Cas and I have one with Benny. And
"The boss' new chewing toy. You're pretty enough for the floor, why aren't you working the pole at Heaven?" His scent revealed slight notes of arousal. Dean shifted from one leg to the other.
“Ah, those I can help you with. It would have been awkward if you wanted to be a DA or judge.” Cas laughed but the humour was lost on Sam. Dean kicked the alpha under the table. “What is it, sweetheart, why are you hitting me?”
They were on the road, gunning for Nebraska, Dean and Cas in the Impala followed by Sam and Eileen in a black 55 Chevrolet Bel Air.
“I think that is smart. You should stay independent. I’m thinking I should do the same. I feel… trapped and I have been for a while. I tried to talk to my parents but they just shut me down and told me “alphas will be alphas”, also reminding me Brad is the son of some family friends.”
“We’ll join you but after lunch, we were thinking of going to a pirate-themed escape room if you’d like to come with us.”
"The ledger never lies. The Avtoritet checks it himself every Thursday night." Joshua offered Dean a kind smile. Dean was silent. "I say take the money and think nothing of it. You earned it."
Before Dean could step into the room he was hit in the shins by something orange that made way too much noise. He looked down to find an orange tabby meowing at the top of its lungs, headbutting and rubbing itself on Cas' legs.
. A pinch of that pesky, all-engulfing guilt pulled on a corner of his mind. Dean pushed it down but came across something else. Something buried deeper still.
“Dean, a kept omega would have been living in my apartment wearing only lace panties and a silk robe. You’re my recruit and you do your part in this organization, you are paid and you manage your salary for rent, food and fun. You are far away from a kept omega.” Cas’ hot breath tickled Dean behind the ear, the younger man trying his best not to squirm or whimper in the store. “Omega-mine, I enjoy providing for you.” He handed Dean the credit card, whispering the PIN in his ear. “Please consider choosing a helmet too.”
Cas looked at him with sad eyes. “I’m eating borscht and beef stroganoff tonight. It’s as Russian as it gets. What do you say?”
“Yeah, I do, now back off or pick on someone your own size. Do you get off from beating kids that can’t fight back?”
"Alpha gave me this job. I think he knows what he's doing", Dean raised an eyebrow in challenge, widening his stance, relaxing his shoulders, jutting his chin outwards.
"Not… really. I, uhm, did most of the jobs in the Bratva, I dealt drugs, I pickpocketed, I stole and I… assassinated some… targets, enemies. One of them had Pumpkin. I couldn't leave the cat
Hearing the alpha be reduced to a swearing mess by his mouth alone had Dean's inner omega preen. He thrust over Cas' groin and cock while playing with the mating gland with his mouth and leaving his hands to roam - teasing nipples, caressing the skin. Cas was soon reduced to shallow breaths, moaning and swearing both in English and Russian. Once he reached his breaking point Cas grabbed his hips, stopping him from moving but before Dean could protest he picked up the rhythm and intensity grinding their cocks between their bodies with more force. Dean gasped from the intense pleasure, catching on the man’s shoulders for balance. He was sure he was going to come soon, his cock straining his jeans. He moved his head to catch Cas in a passionate kiss. He was soft and pliant, leaving Cas to sustain the fast rhythm. The alpha’s thrusts became slightly more erratic and Dean knew that he too must be close. They both came in their pants with each other's names on their lips. Dean collapsed on Cas, he was spent, hanging in his alpha's arms. Cas petted his thighs. The omega was trailing his fingers on the bruises that were forming over the mating gland, colouring the epaulette in purple.
“Noted, Mrs Harvelle. Dean, meet me at Tolstyy Chlen at 6, okay?” Cas exhaled with smoke through his nose.
“Cas… I’m sorry I had to do all that… I …” Dean choked out, his voice suddenly so small he surprised even himself.  He cleared his voice, coughed twice “I still have to figure out how to tell Sam about us”, he gestured to the laptop and his research “so uhm… chick flick moment end scene, ‘kay?” Dean pressed his face with his hands, drawing breath and trying to focus back on the article he was reading.
“If you want to leave now, I am going to let you. I can still… do damage control and protect you. But if you stay beyond
“Uhm” the kid turned to his boyfriend who nodded eagerly “yeah, sure, thanks. I am Caleb, and this is Bruce” – the other kid had joined them.
“Well, yeah, I kinda owe the dude, now.” Dean looked at the door through which they wheeled Gabriel out.
“I don’t… want to bring up bad memories but how did you remain a virgin with your… work? I’m just curious.”
“You saw my ruble. And you were right, I'm, erm, riding with the Russians.” Dean rubbed the back of his neck.
“I want you to put a piece of the paper in that glass of water.” he pointed to the big glass of water on the coffee table at Dean's right side.
At school, the teachers and the students were talking about the upcoming Spring Fling but Dean wasn't in the mood to gush over it, using the time to research underage emancipation on his phone and Becky noticed he was distracted.
Cas smiled like he’d never seen him before, openly, wholeheartedly. “Close enough” and the angel nuzzled in Dean. He snapped his fingers and they were clean again, snuggled under the covers.
“I suppose I could try and change to a more pleasurable vessel for you. I know you prefer the female form.”
The guy opened his mouth but Dean connected his brass-knuckled fist with the guy's solar plexus and pushed him down inside the room. The guy curled in himself coughing and gasping for breath on the floor while Cas closed the door.
Claire had been swept forward by the crowd, some pushing, some pulling. She was looking for them but she couldn’t see them nor fight the current of people moving toward the ever-growing mosh pit. Suddenly she went down, tripping on something. Dean could have sworn he felt feathers on his neck and in the next second they were by Claire’s side. Cas placed a hand on her shoulder, lifting her up. Dean blinked once and suddenly all three were on the sides, away from the moshing and further to the quieter side where food, drinks and bathrooms were. Once safe Cas let go of Claire but Dean was not letting go of Cas, his hand squeezing the angel’s waist. He was clinging tightly to the angel’s warm body. Cas casually snuck his hand in Dean’s back pocket. Dean placed a kiss on Cas’ lips quickly, reassuring. Cas squeezed his ass through the jeans. It all happened in under a minute but even in the dark Claire couldn’t miss all that.
“I want to work at Tolstyy Chlen, Ellen.” Dean reached out over Sam to touch Castiel’s knee to ground himself and the alpha caught his hand.
Dean felt like he would throw up the stew. He could almost scent himself, bitter, acidic apples laced with the decaying scent of desperation. He never heard Sam call him “dada” since the boy was three. He uncurled, allowing Sam to rise and strip. Dean left him to it, closing the bathroom door. There he was, all alone in the middle of the room. Dean let himself fall on the ground, his scent going haywire. It had a note he never smelled on himself, decaying apples and burnt cinnamon. He felt something grip his insides tight and yanking them. He couldn’t breathe. He fumbled with his phone, searching for the contact details. He pressed the call button through his blurry vision. He was somewhat aware that he was crying.
“But it is true. We all have one. Brad smells like mate and home. I just want to roll around in his scent all day.”
Dean gaped at him. “Are you seriously making jokes about anal? I… Dude! I failed to tell them! I tried so hard…”
“I want that too, I am not going to lie. The thought of you leaving pains me. It’s… especially excruciating because of my rut.”
“Well… it’s an important subject. I had some courses on the matter at college, we talked about anti-discrimination laws and decriminalization of homosexual relationships. It seems they declared the E.U. a freedom space. Like the entire European Union and there is trouble because some countries are against LGBT rights – the ones in Eastern Europe, Poland seems the most vocal. Did you know it’s still illegal in Russia? You could go to prison there.”
Cas sighed and took the last few draws of his cigarette before throwing the butt on the ground and crushing it under his leather shoe. He wrapped his hand around Dean’s shoulders and they went inside.
"Come, the elevator for the penthouse is this way." Cas gestured with his head towards the northern corner.
"Well, then, no 'intent-to-mate' forms so… I will represent Mrs Harvelle for the emergency guardianship then she needs to agree for a place for you to live and a place for you to hold a
“We’ve been uh… kind of a thing since he came back. I… uhm, wanted to tell but I never knew how, I just…”
Cas frowned “Well…I’ve made this vessel my body for the last twelve years. It’s been destroyed and remade for me four or five times. I’ve grown to like it. You like it. I see no problem if I keep it. We are not going to live with Jimmy” Cas smiled amused. “And honestly Dean… people can tell the difference between me and him. Angels will always know as they see my true form… Where is this coming from?” Cas was stroking Dean’s cheek.
“You are welcomed, Dean. I am happy to assist you.” Cas smiled. They seemed to have forgotten Sam was there at all.
“I missed your body, your taste, Cas. I…. don’t know what it is about it, you just smell like wildflowers and mountains and taste sweet ...buddy I’ve never enjoyed kissing someone this much.”
“Oh. Well, I’ll be there by noon. There’s this concert I want to go to but Kaia didn’t want to come. She doesn’t like The Pretty Reckless that much. We haven’t seen each other yet and I missed you. We could get together for some drinks tonight. How about that, Cas?”
“There won’t be frat boys…” Claire told to one because Cas and Dean were staring at each other, again.
“Yeah, good, good assumption on my part, then, so we’re not buying condoms that’s swell to know. Do you want breakfast sunshine?”
Dean cradled the beer bottle. Castiel’s words kept repeating inside his head. He was ruining this wasn’t he? “
Cas gave her a timid smile. He changed back in his normal attire with the items to be bought in his right arm. Walking to the register Claire hung herself on Cas’ left arm.
Sam locked his phone and let it fall on the bed. He got a bit upright, sitting cross-legged and watching Dean with intensity.
A middle-aged woman came behind them, dragging a teenage daughter. “Honestly Barbara, you shouldn’t be wearing these things. If you complain more I won’t even buy the flannel.” The girl closed her mouth tight and stayed behind her mother. “Look at all this”, she carried on gesturing to the closest band tee, one featuring Godsmack, “Satanists, godless people. It’s a sin even to be here.”
Dean instantly felt better at the thought of being behind the wheel of Cas' strong car and practically skipped all the way to it.
"I say no harm done," Dean declared to the surprise of the table. "What? He's a paedophile, y'all gonna mourn a paedophile?"
Dean said that loudly and clearly emphasizing on the word boyfriend. The threat was obvious and serious and Dean could see some goons making tiny steps backward. He let the sentence hang there. The diner was silent, all eyes trained on the action.
Dean glided at a leisurely pace, careful to his surroundings. He checked his back often to make sure he was not followed. Old beaten-in instincts were surfacing. His Dad wasn't so keen on training Dean after he presented but that did not erase years of training and conditioning.
Dean and Charlie turned around. Sure enough, the tall alpha that helped Dean was standing in the middle of the cafeteria with a tray in his hands.
Sam, Dean, and Cas were circling the nest, machetes in hand. They entered the nest carefully, sun shining through barn windows and cracked wood. Footsteps behind and in front told them the vamps knew they were there.
Cas let Dean feed treats to the cats as "the way to a cat's heart is through her stomach". Pumpkin was extremely affectionate, rubbing herself all over Dean purring and chirping all the time. Zaychik would carefully take the treat and eat it in the other corner. After that, they settled on the beige leather couch. Following some deliberation, Dean concluded Cas should "see the movies as the creator intended" and started "A New Hope".
"How did you sleep?" Cas pushed a coffee mug towards Dean, sipping a bit of the black liquid from his own mug. "I’d recommend the breakfast special. It has scrambled eggs, sausages, toasted bread and a mixed vegetable salad. It's the best dish here."
“I took Cas for his make-over montage. I had all my speeches ready to try and make that awkward angel understand. I knew you had feelings for each other for years and those damned books confirmed everything. I just wanted to shove Cas in the right direction and when I shoved he slipped.”
“Dean… there should not be anything between us. This is a safe space, we need to talk about things. Just say it.”
Dean froze, his expression falling, his brain clearly going in overdrive to find an explanation for Cas.
"I didn't like what you implied, Charles. That kind of shit hurts me and Benny. I'm with Cas. Benny is taking Andrea to the Spring Fling. We're
He guided Sam to the table Cas always used. As soon as they sat down a waiter came with menus and a big jug of lemon water and four glasses. Another one brought a Russian newspaper.
They were all packed in the Impala: Dean driving, Sam riding shotgun, Cas and Eileen in the back seat.
“An angel of the Lord possessed my father and left for war and then another much, much douchier angel kidnapped and killed my mom,” Claire said flatly, sipping coffee while maintaining eye contact.
They spent the entire morning apart, Dean sullenly drinking at the beach bar. “Castiel why do you always have to leave like that? They didn’t teach you about “See ya later” in Heaven kindergarten?
“Becky is all about true mates shit. She keeps bombarding me with so-called facts as if it’s not just a myth. I actually looked this one up - apparently, if the alpha is legally an adult, if they claim an underage omega they get custody from the parents. How fucked up is that? And she suggested you do it on me.” Dean shook his head
“So, like I told Ellen, we can negotiate a lower rent if you take it as is, even lower if you can do the repairs. The previous tenants took some drugs and went off the rails, flooded the place, painted these… things on the walls. One of them had to be hospitalized. Nasty stuff but in the past. Now - what do you say?”
The rest of the drive was uneventful and boring. Dean parked and they both went up the moving escalator towards the mall. Once inside Cas grabbed Dean's hand, caressing the back of his hand with his thumb. Dean turned and kissed Cas on the cheek, careful to scent mark the alpha.
“I’ll cry myself to sleep because of it.” Dean snagged the form from the desk and left the room in a hurry, ignoring Ms Ketchum’s lecture about respect. He tore it into pieces and threw the pieces in the trash can.
Sam opened his eyes in the backseat of the Impala. He had no idea how many hours he’d slept. Dean’s winter jacket was keeping him comfortably warm. He looked up, sleep still clinging to his eyelashes and what he sees really wakes him up. Castiel, wearing just his suit was driving Baby and, adding insult to injury, Lizzo could be heard from the radio. Sam glanced at the passenger seat and sure enough, his brother was dozing off, covered by the angel’s trenchcoat.
"Well, this is pretty incriminating stuff here. Yeah, granted it is encoded but still… Most of the couriers are men that were either born in the Bratva or have been with us for several years. You must really be something if the boss gave you this job. I am looking forward to watching you grow with us, in the pack." He gave Dean a tight hug.
Dean watched Sam interact with the other alpha and he couldn't help the ball of pride in his chest from growing bigger and bigger. Cas caught his eyes and smiled just for him which melted Dean.
. Cas joined him after an hour and without preamble bent down and started kissing him. The alpha lowered himself on the couch, gathering Dean in his arms, never releasing his lips. Their kisses slowed down until they were small chaste pecks, kissing just for comfort, just to feel one another. Dean felt every puff of air on his lips when Cas spoke.
“Gr- green, alpha.” Dean lifted his hips a bit, fidgeting on the already damp towel, squeezing the toy a bit too much.
"I noticed you two are all alone here, no parents in sight. It… would be sad if someone called PPS, right? I heard so many sob stories, siblings separated by designation never to meet each other again. That… would suck, wouldn't it?" The alpha was picking at the peeling paint of the railing.
He looked at Dean then at Serghei then the rest of the crowd. The silence was oppressive. Eventually, Castiel raised his hand and pointed at an unhurt beta.
“Hi, erm, Dean Winchester. This is my brother Sam.” Jody nodded as a hello to Sam, and Dean continued. “I guess, yes, I need to stay somewhere.”
The leader’s laughter died out. He took a step back, swinging his arm to take momentum before throwing himself at Dean.
Dean was thinking fast, unable to decide what to do. Cas was so close to him. He could almost feel the angel’s breath on his lips. Dean was slowly building up the courage to lean in and press in a kiss when Cas pulled away sharply. Dean felt all air leave his lungs. What did he do wrong? One glance at Cas told him it was not his fault at all. He recognized the tense look on Cas’ face as the warrior instincts kicked in and his body was adjusting to a defensive position. Something was up. Dean straightened in his seat, hand darting to the small of his back. “Crap”. The interstate was not empty anymore. A police car was pulled just behind the Impala and the officer was just opening his door. “I should have moved the car,” Dean thought bitterly. The cop slowly made his way to Dean’s window and tapped it with the end of his flashlight. Dean lowered it and the officer flooded them with light.
“You can do this Dean” he steeled himself and crossed the hallway, knocking on the sturdy door. He heard a Russian word but not knowing what it meant he stayed put. Seconds dragged into minutes and then the door was suddenly pulled open and Dean was surrounded by tobacco and orange blossoms.
“You feared I would friendzone you? You feathery son-of-a-bitch you IGNORED us because you were AFRAID I’d friendzone you? Are you a teenager? YOU DON’T DROP SOMETHING LIKE THAT ON SOMEONE ELSE AND BAIL. Didn’t you want to know what I would say?” Dean looked at the angel incredulously.
“Becks.” The tone was curt and cold and Dean had to watch his bubbly friend wilt like a dying flower under the gaze of Brad. He decided he hated Brad.
“So you didn’t hear me come in?” Dean had to be sure. He said some pretty heavy stuff to Cas, things he didn’t want his little brother to know about even though he didn’t need his protection anymore.
Mr Moore nodded and scanned the crowd again. Dean spotted Sam coming towards them with Jessica in tow.
"Language, Mr. Winchester! I do not expect some 17-year-old alpha to know any better, they're acting on
"You heard me perfectly well, Mr. Winchester. We wouldn't want our alpha students to be distracted. It's clear how you got them, I don't want them thinking about
Dean pressed the button and the knot inflated inside him, locking the toy in and it driving him over the edge, hot cum spraying on his belly. He cried out and he heard Cas calling out his name. His body went limp on the mattress and he relaxed keeping his eyes closed, floating in the afterglow, enjoying the stretch of the knot on the inside of his rim. It felt damn good and he started purring.
half aware of the blood dripping on his shirt from the cracked lip. He lunged forwards but the other man sidestepped at the last moment and clocked him in the temple, sending his head against the same car. Dean stumbled backward to get away but the other followed. Serghei swept his legs again but Dean caught him by his shirt and they both fell to the ground with the alpha on top of the omega. Serghei moved up to straddle Dean. Aggression and rage, both alpha and omega filled the room. Serghei caught Dean's hands to pin them over his head. Dean planted his feet, raised his hips, trapped Serghei's foot, and flipped them both. The omega didn't catch Serghei's surprised face but he did scent the small spike of alpha fear and that edged him on. Now Dean was between Serghei's legs, kneeling. He moved quickly, taking advantage of the alpha's stunned state to straddle the alpha's chest and raise his arm to pound his fist in the other's face.
"Hello, Mr Moore. I'd prefer you to call me by my name and not my designation. My boyfriend doesn't like it, he thinks it's intimate. I don't call people by their designation anymore either."
The two Novaks started a discussion with Sam about the rise and fall of their empire, about what they liked or hated about their history. Castiel gave Sam a thin book written by a Russian historian in English. Dean was happy to see his brother so enthusiastic. He almost started purring when he felt Castiel's hand on his thigh, working his inner muscles.
Sky blues flashed alpha red. Growling, Cas went back to his neck to suck in some hickeys. Dean weaved his fingers in Cas' thick black hair. "
“Dean…Heeey, Dean.” Dean blinked and he was back in the cafeteria, the phantom scent of oranges gone. “Where’d you go? We lost ya for sec there” Charlie smiled at him.
The evening was unusually cold for April. All bunched up in their jackets, Dean and Sam exited the car. Creepy Guy was on the porch, smoking a cigar.
Soon, Dean found himself staring at the ceiling of the crappy motel, unable to sleep. Tonight was worse than the last few nights. He kept fidgeting in the covers, sleep evading him entirely. He glanced at the clock on the bedside. It read 1 am. It was Thursday. Dammed Thursdays.
“Well then you go, I’ll cover the door. And get one of those “Out of Order” signs.” Benny jerked his head in a "go" motion to get him moving.
. Minutes dragged like hours until more cops entered. Officer Williams brought them up to speed and they fanned out to secure the space. Dean remained standing where Jenny told him.
"So here - take these. And uhm…" Garth went and grabbed a high vis vest from behind the counter. "Take this. Be careful. Watch your right, these drivers are reckless and they are not going to stop. Make sure to pick up some water. I know it's cold but dehydration is nasty. Remember, any signs of danger, melt the letter, crumble the seal. The wax is also a water-soluble variant but it does take more time, so crunch it  Okay… I think you are good to go." Garth kept hovering like a mother hen until Dean was on his skate and left the club behind.
“Alright, I’ll say one last thing and I’ll shut up forever, or at least for now. Tell Dean to tell me. Point it out that I am also gay. Tell him I’ve been teasing you. I might be able to help him as a fellow gay person.”
Dean’s heart stopped. They had to keep playing it cool, there was no other choice. “I’ll wear something nice then. I’ll see you in 30 minutes.”
Also, I wanted to make this a slow burn but I just couldn't let these two idjits tip toe around each other any longer. I don't actually enjoy miscommunication/misunderstanding tropes if they last too long and so this chapter was born. it just felt natural.
“You now Cas… It’s usually the brother that goes after the lover to threaten them with “hurt him I will kill you” speeches not the other way around”
“You complete ASSBUTT. YOU’RE ALIVE? AND YOU NEVER CAME TO SEE US? YOU LEFT ME AFTER YOU…..AFTER YOU SAID THAT YOU JUST….YOU….” Dean was a mess but still, his instincts kicked in and splashed holy water on Cas’ face and placed a silver blade in his hand, with no reactions from the angel. “IF YOU REALLY ARE CAS AND NOT SOME DJINN INDUCED DREAM, WHY DIDN’T YOU COME TO US?”
“Ok, I’m asking you. When the time comes for Sam, help him pass peacefully, okay? He’s my brother. I have to take care of him.”
Dean had his backpack and sunglasses on, taping in the shit-eating, take-no-bullshit side of his personality to walk with confidence. He passed the coffee shop, noting the two Bratva men Cas sent as his backup. They were sipping coffees but they were not fooling anyone with the hand tattoos on display.
"No. I don't want our first time together to be in the throws of a rut. I tend to get… a bit more… aggressive during ruts. I used to spend them with willing people but now I'll have to settle with the toys I have. I'll be fine. When are your heats?"
“I want you to work at Tolstyy Chlen, we can make a job for you there.” It was the first time Cas intervened but Dean saw Ellen puff up her chest and glaring at the alpha.
“Gah, really? You’re talking about fucking ghouls over breakfast? Jeez. Eileen, seriously?” Dean let his fork clatter on the plate, exasperation all over his face. Ghouls were just the worst.
"Yeah, so I came to get some coffee and I went to the counter. I, erm, reached it at the same time as that omega. He asked me if I wanted a recommendation. He had an accent, like those Bond villains? Russian? German?" Dean tried to picture his Dad yelling at him so his scent could go sour and it did. "Then I heard a loud sound, I didn't know what and the guy shoved me down. I realized after a few seconds that there were gunshots. Three guys, those ones -" he pointed at the Italians' bodies - "busted in guns blazing."
The Moore's house was a big apartment in one of the nicer buildings in Brighton Beach. Dean was nervous as hell when he knocked on the door, holding the bottle of juice he brought. He couldn't buy a nice wine so he thought it was the least he could bring. Mrs Moore opened the door with a wide smile on her face. A warm neutral beta scent enveloped Dean.
Dean kissed Cas and moved to straddle him. He took off his shirt and resumed kissing Cas, hands cruising underneath Cas’ borrowed shirt. Cas shimmied his boxers off, his erection slapping back on his stomach, and then got to work on Dean’s. The hunter parted from the Angel so they could get undressed. Completely naked they interlocked again. They moaned when their dicks touched and Dean thought he would come just from hearing Cas make those sounds. He was holding Dean by the scruff of his neck as they kissed. Cas was the first to begin thrusting against the hunter’s body. Soon they found a rhythm and they kept at it. Dean felt he was close and curled his hand around both their dicks and started pumping. Cas made an otherworldly sound and started grinding faster against Dean’s hand. They came at the same time, starring in each other’s eyes. Dean collapsed on Cas, content.
“He said he wanted to wait for me to be 18 to be with me. He doesn’t even want to take it further than scenting and talking”
The girl's eyes widened in understanding and ushered Dean to follow her. He passed the few patrons that were eating various Russian dishes. She shoved him through the kitchen and inside an office and left him there. The office was small, it had a cluttered desk and some file cabinets against the back wall. The right wall had some counters, a microwave, a minifridge, and some mismatched end tables. On one of the end tables, there was a tea set with a kettle and several cups. The room smelled faintly of omega. Soon a tall man joined him. He smelled of Alpha and had light brown eyes, blond hair, and a slightly puffy physique.
"You gave a nice show up there. Scent clear of fear or surprise. You barely flinched. Like the boss’ mate should be", his eyes flicked to Cas then back on Dean. "I should say, the advice I gave you the first time stands even more true now". He turned back to Cas "Thank you, sir". Balthazar gave Cas a curt nod before leaving them alone.
They cuddled back on the couch to watch the movie. Around the time Luke was struggling with his Jedi training Pumpkin announced herself with a trill and jumped on the couch. She smelled Dean inquisitively.
“He mocked me for liking things he deemed girly. He broke my bones more times than I can remember. I used to tell Sam that I got hurt hunting but truth is I got hurt ‘cuz Dad had a temper when he got drunk. I made sure Sammy never knew that – how dad was after one too many or – I just made sure Sammy never knew. Dad started taking me on odd hunts when I was 14. I killed my first monster at 16. I….uhm… I went on my first solo hunt on my 17
“Dean… You know that whole “Did it hurt when you fell from Heaven?”, well the answer is YES. He is an Angel of the Lord that literally fell from Heaven for YOU. It doesn’t get more rom-com than that, or epic love story for that matter. He’s changed his life 180 just because of you. He needs to be with you openly, Dean. He’s not going to say anything and he’ll deny it from here to Heaven and back but he’s hurting because he has to hide his feelings. Sam knows I’m gay and he’s fine with it, he’s going to be fine with you”
Damn. Dean did not expect that. But on the other hand, he had 250 dollars in his pocket. He could give Sam the 200 for the trip and somehow make it work until Friday,
The bar was pirate themed, sea shanties blaring from the speakers, waitresses dressed in flimsy 18th century inspired dresses. Dean, Cas and Claire found a booth in the back. Dean caught Cas’ eyes. He’d wish he could kiss him right now, but Claire’s presence stopped him.
0.63 seconds later 119 million results flooded. Dean skimmed through the titles, settling on opening an article aimed at struggling teens. He read the whole thing, feeling as confused as he was when he was 14. “
“You are so dorky, Cas.” Dean sighed with a soft smile on his face. Underneath the table, he brushed his fingers on Cas’ thigh, halfway between his knees and his pelvis. He felt Cas react to the touch. Across the table, Sam didn’t seem to notice anything.
The concert was pretty loud, Dean, Cas and Claire were bobbing to the rhythm, Claire was swinging the most wildly. Dean was scanning the crowd, and met Cas’ eyes after doing a 360.
"I haven't given you a monologue about my evil plans for world domination." He shrugged, starting towards the elevator.
“Yeah… well my last STI screening came clean a few years back and I haven’t had…sexual encounters since, so I am clean and I kinda assumed you being an Angel…”
Dean scented himself and found lingering smells of his fear, of alpha release, blood, and a hint of tobacco. He clung to the tobacco even though he quickly realized it was the smell of cigars and not Castiel’s natural scent. It wasn’t his fault the alpha smelled so damn good to him. Sam was just a young Alpha, barely presented, and still had a lot to learn about scents and how to read them.
“Yes, the rut ended, thank goodness. It was the hardest I ever had. I… I think what we did last night settled me. I didn’t imagine my wolf was so tied to yours, all I wanted to do was run to you.”
I will go back on 7 to correct some typos. I posted after a shift and I have no idea how I managed THAT.
The next morning, Dean was very tired, moving on auto-pilot through the creepy apartment. He had hardly slept, anxiety over
“It’s an enochian song. We… we sometimes sing to new arrivals, if they had violent, unexpected deaths they tend to be…a bit frayed when they wake up in Heaven. So we sing.”
"But people have hickeys and claims on them all the time at work without them being engaged or mated. It's normal in a relationship."
Dean hurried over to the supply closet that was on an adjacent hallway, overjoyed to find it unlocked. He gathered the floor detergent and a mop, snagging the "out of order" sign on his way out. Benny was just telling off some Freshmen when Dean rounded the corner. They stuck the “out of order” sign haphazardly on the door and went inside. The smell was worse than Dean thought and for half a second he panicked at the thought that he went inside
Dean did not fear suspension, it wouldn't be the first time either, but if the vice principal wanted to find his dad then he would be in trouble. If the beta couldn't get a hold of John then he could start investigating, realize the boys lived in a motel alone, and maybe involve Pup Protective Services. If they took them away Sam and Dean would be separated by the system, housed based on their secondary designation. Dean swallowed and took his flannel off to put the ugly shirt over his tee.
"So it's like Tolstyy Chlen," Dean murmured, already running logistics in his head. For best surveillance, he should stay
“Hmm…So what were you listening to?” Dean raised his eyes and arched an eyebrow at his little brother.
John would come back and demand his time, demand they leave? Sam nuzzled closer, scenting Dean in his sleep. He petted his younger brother's hair.
“Dean is right Claire. If you had someone with you it would have been fine. I agree with Dean. It will be safer if we came.”
“Dean! It’s in every lore book. Castiel, Seraph, Angel of Thursday, Temperance, Serenity” Sam said while signing and then glared at Dean with his best bitch face.
"Okay, I trust you, Dean." Sam curled into himself on the passenger seat and Dean reached out to pat him on the back.
“Hi, I’m Gabriel. You must be Dean. My brother told me you'd come” he extended his hand and Dean shook it. He took a good look at the other man as he demanded his letter. This was all wrong.
“Yeah, I do. He asked me how I was from time to time. But I never told him anything about us being alone. I think he just suspects that Dad isn’t a doting father but nothing more.”
“I had to leave the motel and now I’m sleeping in my car with Sam. I called Dad but he didn’t answer and didn’t call me back. I think Cas will help me but he can’t while in rut so…”
it will probably be another week until I will be able to post, I have my driver's exam on Wednesday, I have a paper I need to write for work, I have a shift on Friday night and I need to travel back home to see some elderly relatives. I am sorry
“Language, Mr Winchester!” She seemed scandalized, her face had fallen in shock but Dean was not impressed.
“Hey. We’ve booked three rooms. Eh…two doubles and a single.” Dean smiled as he leaned on the counter. “It’s under the name Winchester. Dean Winchester”. He leaned a bit too much over the counter, smiled a bit too wide, and that did not go unnoticed by Cas.
"I made a public claim over you that night at Tolstyy Chlen. Yes, Dean. We're boyfriends, or partners or whatever you want to call us but it's very much "official"." Cas used air quotes. "I am surprised you didn't realize this." His scent was mouldy and muted and Dean hated that.
Then end credits were rolling and Cas shifted his position a bit so Dean lifted his head from Cas’ chest. “Did you like it?”
"Do we have any estimates for the number of customers that frequent the place? We can't hit a busy restaurant." Cas was playing with his pen.
“I plan on taking guardianship then give my permission for Dean to live here so he can petition for emancipation.”
“Fine. Okay. It’s your business but if you want an extra pair of hands I’m… moderately good with a paintbrush. “ Cas smiled and moved to kiss him again, and Dean let him, it felt so damn good. They picked their coffees and plopped on the couch to wait for Sam, Dean plastered to the alpha’s side.
Dean woke up the next morning snuggled into Cas, breathing in his distinct smell, that combination of wilderness after-rain and wildflowers he loved but would never dear to admit out loud. Cas hugged tighter and whispered “morning, ol boaluahe. How was your sleep? You really were out of it after that tea.”
"Benny would be an asset. That group was good. You could recruit him," the alpha breathed on Dean’s neck, making him shudder with pleasure.
Left alone the third guy tried to aim at Gabriel again but Maxim Ivanovich shot him thrice in the chest. Dean dragged Gabriel’s body to lay him flat on the floor and placed both hands over the gaping hole in Gabriel’s abdomen. He applied pressure, leaning to put his body weight behind it, feeling something pulsate inside Gabe. The omega’s skin was turning pale white and clammy already. Dean looked at him and realized Gabe was unconscious. Police sirens were audible in the distance but getting closer.
"Yeah, sure. But uhm… I have work Monday to Friday until 9. And this weekend I'm staying at Cas' place."
"I don't care about your past but I would like to know what you did and what is going to be new to you. For example, did you have penetrative sex?"
Cas scoffed. “Dean this looks… appalling. I can get some men to paint the walls while you’re at school.”
Cas tilted his head and squinted his eyes. “Your soul is your most intimate part. It’s, in a way, your true form. You’ve… opened it to me, laid it bare for me to love. You’re mine. I’ve raised you from the depths of Hell I’ll take you to your rightful place in Heaven”
“Yeah… I am happy for you two, I really am. In a way, I should have seen this coming. You two always fought for each other. He loves you.”
"I think we could head out to the mall, get out of the house, do a bit of window shopping. We can buy pizzas for home and eat them here. What do you think?"
“It’s me. Jack….well, God, pulled me out of the Empty and…rebuilt me. I even have all my grace and my wings back. You can perform the tests on me.” Castiel extended his hand toward Dean.
“Hello, brother,” sweet wine and sea salt hit Dean’s nose. Like the other day, his inner omega wanted to scent deeper but this time the urge was much, much more muted, barely an afterthought. The scent was pleasant and soothing but nothing more.
He felt Sam's eyes boring into his temple "... closer to you, less… bossy. Dad is all about discipline, my boyfriend is more… laid back. '
Dean didn't want to stay more than necessary in the alpha's presence so he extended the letter. Ishim looked at his hand in disinterest, making no move to actually take the document.
“I…” Dean turned to stare at Cas. The angel knew him better than himself, it seemed. “Yeah…I guess so. I don’t know how to tell him. I didn’t even tell him about what you told me back there, I just… buried that stuff, buddy. It was too painful. And…well I NEVER told anyone that I…uhm…that I liked dudes and…” Dean was a mess, he realized. All of the things he kept buried and sealed away were bubbling too close to the surface for comfort.
Dean returned to the lounge to wait until he was needed or his shift ended. He was half way through an episode of Dr. Sexi on his phone when Garth called for him.
The pair walked a while, feet half in water half on the sand. Cas would bend over from time to time to pick up seashells or sea snails. Dean was enjoying himself on the walk, inhaling deeply, looking at the ocean, watching Cas.
Cas slipped in his evening routine afterwards, cleaning the house, tending to the cats with Dean a silent shadow following him around. Eventually, they had to get ready for sleep. Cas showed Dean the guest room he had readied for him and left him there after a kiss goodnight. It was a clean room. The sheets on the bed were scentless, most likely washed with scent neutralizing detergent. The pillow was nice and soft and Dean snuggled himself under the covers. He kept tossing and turning in the bed. Everything was… too clean. Every motel room had thousands of lingering scents, his Uncle Bobby's house always smelled like motor oil and good whiskey, not to mention that there always was his family's scents. But this room. It had no scent whatsoever. It made him restless. He gave up trying to fall asleep, throwing the covers off him and marching back into the hallway. He let his nose guide him towards the master bedroom where Cas was. He could hear voices from inside the room talking in Russian and for a moment jealousy had him. He forcefully opened the door and surprised Castiel who was perched in his bed with a laptop on his belly. He wore silky black pyjamas and his hair was sticking in every direction. He pressed pause on the video.
Sam and Eileen were laying in the shade of the umbrella, chairs squished together, signing fast and giggling.
“If the posturing is over, I would like to redirect the table’s attention to the things we need to know about our targets,” Yelena said and started talking about the people Dean was supposed to watch, sliding towards him a dossier with surveillance photos. She noted things she needed to know in order to execute a successful strike against them.
"I have … so much to teach you. So much." Dean shook his head, with fond exasperation. "See if there is the Remastered album, it has some of my faves all bunched together."
Dean moaned “Cas you’re killing me here”, licking his lips lustfully. He could feel a hard-on forming in his jeans.
Cas sipped his drink in silence and Claire did the same. They stayed like that, quiet for a few minutes before Claire opened her mouth again “So after we find the jacket and after I find something new to wear we’ll go back to the hotel, you’ll change and then we’ll go to Dean’s room and see his reaction. All three of us could go for dinner after.”
"I like it here too. I like Jess. There is a good Law School here. I'll be fine." Sam had his face pressed on Dean's shoulder but he understood every word.
He never got a text back as his phone started ringing - Castiel was calling him and he scrambled to answer, dropping his phone twice in the process.
yeah, so this thing writes itself apparently. I have all of you to thank for the support and inspiration it means a lot to me. I have the next 3 or 4 chapters planned out. I hope to post one on Sunday.
Dean felt the other one’s fingers dig deeper in his hips. “I think you know the answer to that one Cas” the hunter smirked like a bratty twenty-year-old.
“Never. I once told him to stop yanking my hair and he did. I told him I hate it and he never did it again. Maybe Cas is just so awesome but honestly… everything I was scared of in a relationship with an alpha he is not so I think it’s possible. He is the living proof that what those idiots say is instinct is in fact just a lack of education and self-control. Becks. I was in his bed when his rut started.
“Sammy and I are on a hunt. Vamps. Weird masked vamps up in Compton. I don’t get why they’d wear masks, it’s stupid, they kill with their teeth. Anyway, it’s a job Dad couldn’t finish” he heard himself say.
Dean furrowed his brows, scowling at his plate. "I think you can. There must be more to it than… pheromones and biology…"
"I sexted Cas and got carried away in the bathroom by the gym, okay? Benny had my six while I cleaned cum from the floor, jeez." Dean lifted his hands, annoyed.
It was approaching the end of his shift when the group Dean met in the grocery store joined another group. The omega was fixing the chain on his borowed bike and could hear them talk. The alpha looked at him when he said something about a "
“And he’s waiting for you to be ready for… you know… sex and knotting. You said you’re a virgin.” Becky looked frightened by the prospect and Dean could not blame her. Thinking back at Cas that morning had Dean both extremely aroused and terrified about the prospect.
“Ghost? Shifter? Ghoul? Another angel? And if you are another Angel, I swear I’ll gank you for doing this to me!” Dean finally turned and faced the piercing blue eyes fixated on him. Castiel was sitting in the passenger seat, all prim and proper in his suit and trenchcoat, hands on his thighs, blue necktie a bit askew. Just like Dean remembered him.
“Oh stop being such a prude Dean-o. Lipton has that lemon iced tea, don’t they? Come on, dunk one in here.”
All four left the hotel for a stroll on the seafront walkway after diner. They talked, laughed, reminisced about hunts and wars.
“And what are we going to tell your parents? You can maybe slip me in but Sam? I don’t… I don’t want adults knowing about me and Sam being alone less they call PPS. I am not risking it. I can’t be separated from Sam.”
“I never doubted it, Mr Novak. Now, Mrs Harvelle, there are a few more things to sign, here;” he pointed her where to sign; “and here, and here. Now, about living conditions and work. Mr Winchester… I suppose you do not live with Mr Novak?”
“Both bedrooms have upgraded egress windows, and the full window by the front door can be smashed and used as an exit in case of anything.”
“I feel that’s high praise. We should pass by Gabe before we leave. He would like to know how you found your first Russian meal”
"Well, then, I am happy we cleared this up." The alpha's scent was back to orange blossoms. Dean kissed him, then bared his neck, allowing the alpha access to his mating gland. The alpha sucked it his mouth, making a hickey over it. Dean almost whimpered but his stomach growled before he did.
“I’m peachy, Cas”. Dean licked his lips then kissed Cas lightly. Cas rewarded Dean with a gummy smile.
Cas told him what to touch, what to tease and for how long, he took him right to the edge four times and yanked him right back, denying him the release until the young omega was a whimpering puddle. Then, finally, the alpha allowed him to touch his aching hole, teasing his rim, then opening himself up with one, two then three fingers.
“No, no. I just find it highly impractical to be this exposed. I am unbothered with the relative nakedness.”
“Perfect! I haven’t slept this well in years. Usually, there are nightmares… Hell, Dad, Chuck…losing you… but since we’ve been together there hasn’t been one.”
“It seems God IS omnipotent, Sam. Jack pulled me from the Empty, again. Restored my grace, restored my wings. I am in perfect working condition. I haven’t been whole since before Metatron stole my grace but now I am 100% back.” Cas smiled at the towering hunter.
“So, you need… one dress shirt and some jeans plus two or three more shirts, some dress shoes,” Dean checked the list they made the night before.
“Yeah, but we mostly used to fight enemies or to break curses and whatnot. Hearing it like this is way better, ol bauluhe
The five of them kept the conversation light for the rest of lunch. Dean found that Benny was actually funny and a nice guy overall. They each went their separate ways after lunch. Charlie and Kevin had classes, Becky left to meet up with Brad and Dean and Benny left for the parking lot.
Dean wondered how long Cas was going to stay. Would he stay for good if he asked him? Dean spotted an exit off the interstate and took it. He followed the roads, choosing smaller and smaller roads until he stopped in front of a lake. They were all alone. The sun was rising slowly, the water glittering under its rays. Dean thought to himself that this wasn’t such a bad Thursday. It couldn’t be. He had the Angel of Thursday by his side, at least for now. Knowing he was alive made Dean happy. He was happy in the being.
“Hm. We have a stricter approval process for alphas. I gather he is not in this high school?” She was sorting out some forms.
Dean stopped crying just as suddenly as he had started. His brain was catching up with what Castiel said. Maxim Ivanovich’s words came back to him. He chose this. Didn’t he?
“So,” Bruce started, “how long have you two been together? Caleb and I, we’re celebrating our first anniversary with this trip.”
"It's a 3 out of 5. It doesn't have a "mob" setting. Just "fun", "work" and "travel" and some others but… Now that I think about it I could have chosen “career opportunities”."
"Yeah… I… don't really want to leave" Dean confessed. His brother was looking rather intensively and the wall in front on him before he spoke up again. "The school is fine, I guess. And I like Jess." Sam said earnestly. "Do you want to watch a movie?"
The silencing spells weren’t placed in the hallway and Sam heard Cas making his way to Dean’s room. Sam smiled to himself and texted Eileen: “The idjits still think I don’t know. But they are happy. I’ve never seen Dean so happy. I am happy. I miss you. Dean was thinking we should take a vacation, go to the beaches in Florida. Would you like to join us?”. Her confirmation came fast. Sam smiled to himself, wished her goodnight, and went to sleep.
“True Mates is a myth, Becks, you still have a choice.” He shoved some fries in his mouth. The greasy cheap food was good.
Sam left at 5:45 am for his morning run. At that time he was alone on the walkway and everyone seemed to sleep, well, everyone human. He was half-way in his run when the air shifted. It wasn’t warm nor cold just… static. He felt like he was running under water. His hand darted to the back of his joggers where he stashed his blade but his body was pulled through the air and slammed to the side of a food shack. He felt an immense pressure on his chest. Adrenaline was pumping in his blood, eyes darting everyone in search of the new threat. He dropped his jaw when Cas rounded the corner and planted himself in front of Sam.
“What’s wrong with you, Dean? You smell distressed.” Sam scrunched his nose scenting his older brother.
“I feel no need to identify one way or another. But… I suppose I would be gay… if… you want to know that.”
The omega found himself in the busy kitchen of Tolstyy Chlen, filled with cooks, aides, dishwashers, bussers and bustling waiters. People took notice when the alpha entered, all talk dying down and from the crowd a well-built beta that Dean recognized as Dima came forward.
“Hey, we’re one man short, come on. Just try, okay?” Rick patted him with the other hand on the chest.
“We’ll adopt or if you don’t want that, it’s fine. We’ll do other stuff.” The alpha placed chaste kisses on Dean’s face.
“If I let her do what?” Ellen must have a super hearing because she was nowhere near the room earlier.
“I don’t think the drink is silly, although I don’t understand why they seemed to expect me to react to this” Cas raised the pink monstrosity “in some way. What were they expecting?”
They went through the Goodwill and managed to find everything they needed and in good condition. Dean even bought some new running shoes for himself. The salesperson eyed them and smiled wide. “You know, the clothes in that box over there - we sell those by weight so they can be very cheap.”
“You like to have people wait for you, Mr Winchester?” Crowley greeted him from his desk where he was doodling on a piece of paper.
Dean stopped dead in his tracks. He stared into nothing, took a deep breath and opened his mouth. "I was
They found Scooby-Doo reruns on one of the channels and they watched while eating popcorn on Dean's bed. It got late pretty fast.
"The guy threatened the Pahkan and I was sent to… deal with him. Mikhail only used me when it was personal. I was never considered an assassin. Anyway, I neutralized the threat but Pumpkin was on the cat tree. I didn't see her at first. The poor thing ran so fast
Dean purposefully reached for the tent in Cas’s slacks and after removing the layers of fabric and pulling the slacks and the boxers beneath the hips, he found himself with Cas’ erection in his hand. Cas’ eyes were glazed over, clearly enjoying the touch. Dean started stroking gently, slowly. He bent over and licked the head. Cas jerked and moaned. Encouraged, Dean took him inside his mouth and started sucking. Cas grabbed his hair and kept moaning loudly. “De-De-De-an ah ah”. Dean felt even more turned on and picked up the pace. He felt Cas starting to slowly thrust upwards in his mouth. Dean stroked the inside of Cas’ thighs and the sensitive skin of the perineum and soon warm, salty cum filled Dean’s mouth. He swallowed and kept Cas’ penis in his mouth until Cas rode out his orgasm. Dean reached for the glove compartment and handed Cas some wet wipes. He took a few for himself.
The table went silent. Sam was eyeing him in a curious way when he voiced his agreement, backed by Cas. Eileen really wanted to watch “Finding Dory” and she was trying to use her charms on Sam to change his vote.
“Someone has to give mother peace, Bobby,” Dean remembered his dad's motivational speeches, his drunken rages, his ramblings.
In front of the courtroom, Cas stopped, saying he had no business entering and kissed Dean good luck. They all entered the small room destined for Family Court - Dean took a seat at the table with Ellen to his left and Sam to his right. Crowley moved forward and started speaking
Claire re-appeared with the black jeans. After trying them on, they both agreed the dark blue ones were best. The boots also fitted him well so they agreed to buy them as well.
Dean’s inner wolf yipped and ran around in circles in happiness and he stole another kiss from Cas before getting out of the car and going to his own.
Winchester, yes you can have Mrs Harvelle take guardianship but I would say it would be much easier if this burden were taken on by your… esteemed alpha."
“I think I have. When his scent first hit me I felt… so calm, so soothed. I felt safe. I felt at home even though he is a complete stranger. I just…”
“Hm. But it’s not burning adrenaline and sometimes it’s like my whole body is vibrating but I can’t do anything about it and I don’t think I could just sit there and meditate.” Sam was on the edge of his seat, eyes set on the older alpha, one hand holding his jaw.
killing him slowly, as he was unable to talk to Cas. The alpha did not respond to his text, most likely fast asleep after the steamy session.
Around the corner, in the side hallway next to the galley Sam was flattened to the wall facing away from the direction Dean would come. He decided to try to crawl to the stairs to go to the unused lower level but he heard shuffling of feet and realized Dean was coming in the kitchen while he was crouched in full view in the hallway. He jumped in the kitchen and inserted his headphones in his ears. Good thing he forgot them on the counter after his morning run. Sam picked up the kettle and out of the corner of his eye saw Dean freeze in the doorframe. He continued preparing the tea, putting water in the kettle, and ignored Dean’s first two attempts at grabbing his attention.
“The apartment was 800 per month but some bad tenants really did a number on it. It needs some fixing up but she can’t make the investment because she’ll have to raise the rent and no one will take a basement apartment in Brighton Beach for more than 800 a month. So if you can do some work to fix it up while living there she’ll lower the rent. She’ll give you the materials and all you need to do is work.”
“The Empty won’t take me, Dean. Jack voided the deal. I am here, and I am here to stay. Nothing will tear us apart, Dean. We’ll be together here, on Earth for as many years as you have and then, when the time comes I’ll take you up and we’ll share eternity in Heaven. Dean. I am here and I’m not leaving again. I love you.” Cas cupped Dean’s jaw and maneuvered his head so they were looking into each other’s eyes. Tears were gleaming in the green eyes.
“Just like with any other guy... we’d know when the other should uh… just go watch a movie. He had his flings, I had mine. Eventually, he settled with a lanky guy from his chem classes and I moved in with Jessica. He was an ok guy.” Sam shrugged.
“Oh my God, Dad. I want you to get along with Dad” and pointed at Cas. “I’m going to get more beer and go to the bathroom. Not in that order, you get the point, I'll get you some too.” and she left.
. The Italians, the Irish… they're all trying to gain more control but in the end, the Bratva is the most powerful. If we do this
“There, there, we’ll be fine. We’ll run away if needed. We’ll find a way to stay out of the system. Trust
“So if angles what to come down and fish or enjoy farming they can just quit their jobs, make themselves meat suits and kick back and relax?”
“Cas I’m… uhm… I thought I’m doing research like I was on any hunt and I… I’m not bad, right? Dad… Dad used to say gays are just future demons and I’m….” Dean turned his head and locked his eyes in the blue ones.
