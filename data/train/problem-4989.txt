“That’s the spell calling me back. My time in this universe must be running out. God, I didn’t think I’d have to
Steve had to physically grab Tony by both arms to stop him pacing, but at least it finally managed to catch his attention.
“Oh, sorry, I’d really hate for my presence to disrupt the aesthetic you’ve cultivated here, between the piles of water-stained paperbacks and that entire shelf of chipped mugs over there.”
“Well, the minute we closed the portal against the Chitauri, everyone just started squabbling again. So we decided it would be best for the continued safety of the planet if we all just…went our separate ways. And honestly? I think it’s kinda cute that Fury thought something like the Avengers Initiative ever stood a chance in hell of succeeding in the first place. I mean, put a bunch of superheroes, spies, and demigods together, and suddenly it’s like every one of us is named Yoko Ono, you know what I mean?”
, because my bank account literally contains five dollars and a pizza coupon, but actually, I could use your help coming up with some obstacles fit for a god. Designing ways to piss off a superhuman seems like the kinda thing you’d be into. The gift could be from both of us.”
, exactly, to discover that Tony Stark and Bruce Banner had decided that after curfew, in December, during a snowstorm, was the perfect time to sneak into the Forbidden Forest for some casual spell-casting.
“Well, what are we waiting for!” Tony said brightly. His face was bright red and he was staring intently at an empty corner of the classroom. “To the Forbidden Forest we go!”
“I have chosen to be here,” Thor said simply, and Tony couldn’t decide if that actually made sense or if he was just extremely drunk.
Tony is opening his mouth to tell Rogers just that – but probably with a lot more obscure cultural references, just to
Tony didn’t know how to confess to Steve and Bruce that their little cabal had just grown to nearly double its original size, so naturally, he decided to put it off indefinitely. Instead, he spent the evening ensconced in Gryffindor Tower with another book about Metamorphmagus magic. He was convinced the answer
“Plus, I think that integral sign is a sleigh, so—” Tony shifted from one foot to the other, and cast about desperately for some way to change the subject. “Hey, what did you come down here for, anyway?”
“Fucking wizards,” Tony repeats. It’s what he’d assumed would happen, but it’s still annoying as hell that anyone’s able to thwart JARVIS.
Steve makes it all the way to Ohio before conceding that the post-Chitauri road trip might’ve been a mistake.
“That’s…a surprisingly adequate idea, Barton. What d’you need from me, then? Some extra pocket money? JARVIS, transfer—”
…” Tony waved his wand in a loose gesture of frustration with the idiocy of some dead Transfiguration theorist or another. Steve plucked the wand neatly from Tony’s hand and pocketed it before Tony accidentally decapitated any of the wood nymphs frolicking through a nearby painting.
Tony stops dead in the center of the living room, so abruptly that Rogers’ chair keeps rolling until he bumps up against Tony’s thigh.
“Well, you wouldn’t have found it in SHIELD’s files, because I never told them, but the Winter Solider, he…he was my best friend. From the war. Bucky Barnes.”
Steve watched the easy familiarity with which Ellen hugged an unfamiliar girl, and decided abruptly that they didn’t need him here to supervise. They’d find their way back to their own Common Rooms. Or maybe they wouldn’t, but regardless, Steve didn’t have to stay here and find out for sure. He backed out of the corridor and veered instead toward the moving staircase that would deposit him directly beside the main doors (eventually, and with a little coaxing, but it
He pulls back, breathing heavily, to find that Tony’s hair looks even more disastrous than it had when he landed, his face is flooded with color and most importantly, that sense of barely contained energy is thrumming through him once more. Steve hadn’t seen it in so long – longer even than the time they’d spent apart.
of defeating Thanos is one where the Avengers remain whole and undivided. Do you understand? No matter what else happens, it’s
“I mean, I’m a control freak, sure,” Tony continues. “But put me alone in a lab with a soldering iron? And I’m happy to be the god of that little world until the power runs out. But
comes into his workshop without permission, he’s going to order JARVIS to lay waste to the whole miserable building.
Damian sticks his other hand out for Steve to shake, which Steve of course cannot do, since his right hand is permanently attached to Tony’s. But Steve, who has been kindly and charmingly evading handshakes all night long, very pointedly ignores Damian’s outstretched hand, in favor of giving the one on Tony’s arm a look of pure murder.
“We don’t have to keep doing this if you don’t want to.” His shoulders are slumped, like he’s already blaming himself for somehow not doing things to Tony’s exacting standards, when it should be obvious to everyone that the problem here is that Tony’s lost his goddamn mind.
“It makes sense,” Tony insisted, starting another circuit so as to avoid having to argue face-to-face. “I’m like…a baseline test. We can see if it works on a non-werewolf, and then try it on you next.”
Steve waits, but Tony doesn’t seem inclined to say anything else. Either he’s planning to draw this out, or something in his workshop has just rendered him unconscious. Steve sets his jaw and presses on.
thing he’s done since he came out of the ice. Even in the SHIELD cabin -- where he’d been sent immediately upon waking in some misguided attempt to enforce tranquility -- Steve had committed himself to accomplishing small tasks of acculturation. He’d watched television, examined the laptop they’d given him, done more push-ups than was perhaps sane, and taken endless walks around the cabin’s perimeter. He hadn’t meant it as repression, but he supposes in retrospect, that’s what it had been. The dogged forward-march of a soldier. Anything to avoid the feeling – both the certainty and the terror – that this is what the rest of his life had become.
“No, no,” Steve insists, struggling gamely to his feet. He pulls open the car door and stops, swaying slightly, at the sight of Tony sprawled in the back seat. He’s pale and messy-haired and wearing a pair of soft, gray sweatpants that Steve has never seen him wear before. Steve doesn’t
, Steve. And a phone call that I’m pretty sure violated several FAA regulations.” Tony’s expression has gone smug, and it should be supremely irritating – Tony is always at his most irritating when he’s right – but now, Steve can’t help but return Tony’s smile.
Tony smiled faintly and traced his finger over the  “C” in “Christmas” before re-folding the parchment and sliding it into his pocket.
,” Rogers repeats Tony’s own words from last night, giving Tony a slow, steady look, the kind that always seems to pierce right through him. Usually, this kind of look presages Rogers saying something devastatingly accurate about Tony’s general lack of moral character, and Tony waits for whatever judgment Rogers is about to dispense.
have a company to run, plus a whole superhero side-gig, and as much fun as it’s been to sit here and watch you talk to your outerwear…”
Steve’s with Natasha, in a tiny cafe in Bulgaria, when he catches a glimpse of Tony’s face on the screen of a battered TV above the bar. It’s three more hours before he can find a secure enough location to check his laptop, and by then, footage of Tony’s Malibu house sliding into the ocean is plastered over every American news site.
Tony right there, and he’s not proud of the little moan he makes as he deepens the kiss. And now that he’s started it, Steve seems more than happy to let Tony take control of the rest, letting Tony press him into the set of shelves at his back (sending a stack of bar soap clattering across the floor), their bodies fitting together exactly the way Tony had been craving earlier during their dance. And it’s all so utterly addicting that Tony has to pull away and take a breath before he literally dies from it.
The picture he had drawn resembled an Iron Man helmet, but with a wide-open mouth and four sharp teeth. He put antennae on it just for shits and giggles.
Peter's panicked voice was barely above a whisper. "MJ, you gotta get out of Queens! Take your family and go! Tell Ned, tell everyone! And call Tony! He can help you get somewhere safe-"
"Tony! What happened?! Are you hurt?!" Steve knelt down next to him, placing a hand on his shoulder.
"Shouldn't you be with the bride?" Steve raised an eyebrow. All the men were gathered in the room, fretting over Peter. Natasha had burst in a few minutes ago.
"News outlets are reporting few casualties," Tony let his helmet fold back into his suit. He smiled proudly at Peter and clapped him on the back. "Nice work, kid."
"I had hoped things would go differently. Time for plan B," Ultron waved his arm, calling several of Tony's other suits into the fray.
When Michelle walked down the aisle an hour later, Peter felt his heart stop. Because Michelle was honestly the most beautiful person he had ever seen. And he couldn't quite believe that this was happening. That he had actually lived long enough to marry her. Peter relaxed when Michelle took her place at his side. They smiled brightly at one another, and Peter realized she must be having similar thoughts.
"Tony!!" Steve cried, helplessly watching his friend plummet to the ground, blood streaming from a gash in his arm. Tony hit the grass with a thud. Steve worked harder to free himself. They weren't too high up, a fall like that shouldn't be enough to kill someone. But Tony wasn't moving.
"I guess..." Tony hopped up on Steve's desk, his legs dangling over the side. Steve studied the man before him. He looked exhausted. It was more of an emotional exhaustion than physical, although the physical did play a part in it. Tony's eyes were dull, and his shoulders were hunched. Tony had looked like this ever since Steve dumped him. There were a few instances, were Tony looked like he was actually alive, like during movie night last night, or when the two had gone out to lunch with Bucky and Sam. Tony had only been home for three weeks. His road to recovery was only just beginning. Losing Jarvis had clearly set him back. It was going to take a long time for Tony to be his normal self again. If that ever happened. Steve just wanted Tony to be happy.
"What makes you think I would help you?! Sewing someone's mouth shut pretty much guarantees they won't be your ally," Peter pointed out.
Peter woke up in his own bed. Well not quiet his own bed. He was in his former room at the compound. The room was completely empty, but someone had put fresh sheets on the bed. Michelle was curled up next to Peter, fast asleep.
"Months?!" Bruce through his hands in the air and stormed off to the other side of the room. He paced in a circle, muttering to himself while Thor tried to calm him down.
Tony frowned as he read through the messages. Ten missed calls from Happy. Five from Ned. And...twenty-three from Michelle? He had given Peter's friends his personal number, just in case. In the past, Tony had called them many times. Thankfully they hadn't been in a situation where they needed to call Iron Man. Until now, it would seem.
"We'll be arrested too if we're caught aiding a fugitive. We'll all get sent to the Raft and that will be the end of the Avengers."
Tony was at his side in an instant, stroking his hair and speaking softly. "Hey, kid. Welcome back to the world of the living."
Steve held up his hands. "What was I supposed to do? Like you said, he has enough weapons in his body to destroy a city. Standing in his way wasn't exactly a good idea."
War Machine sped up so that he could fly next to Iron Man. They flew above the clouds, out of sight from any prying eyes. "I don't know what you thought you heard on those comms, but Obadiah is dead."
Tony didn't say anything. He just slipped the band off his head and let it drop to the floor. It wasn't until he crushed it under his foot that Steve let out a sigh of relief.
Tony stepped aside. Peter kicked open the door. He had changed out of the top part of his suit, putting on a baggy white t-shirt in its place. He still wore the pants and boots of his costume. "Happy?" He held out his arms.
"I assure you I haven't moved in the past hour," Steve chuckled. "Sure you haven't had a few too many drinks, buddy?"
"I found it!" Bucky dropped to his knees next to Tony, holding a spare arc reactor tightly in his hands. After tugging the broken device free, he attempted to connect the wires of the new one, but his hands were shaking too much. He fumbled with the device, almost dropping it. He was holding Tony's heart and that was a lot of pressure to put on a person. "Don't die, don't die, don't die. Oh god, I can't do this-"
"And I have some news of my own: these are your last minutes on earth. So you better man up and show yourself." Tony kicked open a door. The room was empty. He did the same with the next few rooms. No one.
"I'm guessing him carrying their nuke through that portal just made them even pissier," Bucky huffed.
"We'll see about that..." Steve called Natasha into his office and asked her to help hack into Stark's files.
"I don't know, I think he fancies you quite a bit, regardless of programming." Bucky ruffled Steve's hair.
"Keep your panties on, Capsickle. I was just joking." Tony held up his hands. No one was sure if he was telling the truth or not. The Avengers had gathered in the lounge to celebrate their latest victory, and all the adults were enjoying a drink.
"Fury thinks all my actions were influenced by you guys. So I'm not being held accountable. This is the one time I am perfectly fine with being treated like a kid," Spider-man went over to the nearest cell, which happened to be Steve's. He examined the force field at a distance, not wanting to look too suspicious on the cameras. "I took out their audio, by the way. We have two minutes left before they get it back online."
"You alright?" Iron Man's eyes locked on Steve's. He nodded. "Good." The cyborg shot off down the street. Steve hurried after him, using his shield to take down the few aliens that had somehow managed to avoid the lasers.
"I thought I did know you, but clearly I don't. Allow me to show you the last piece of evidence," he stepped out of the way of the screen.
"Glad you decided to Hulk out in such a big room, makes it easier for me!" Falcon swooped in through the hangar door, bladed feathers scratching at the Hulk's thick hide. "Rhodes, go for the knees!"
"Sorry about that, Capsickle. Today's been a little traumatizing. But I think I'm good now." He grabbed Peter from behind, looping his large metal arms around the teen's small frame. Venom snarled in frustration. He thrashed in Tony's arms, his own arms were trapped at his sides. The armor whirred but didn't let up.
"What's done is done," Peter shrugged. He looked back down at his phone but made no move to actually press anything on the screen. The couch dipped in one direction when Thor sat down next to him.
"Yes, there is!" Steve moaned. "I'm getting weird feelings for a robot! A robot, buck!" Steve through he hands in the air, clearly distressed. "I should only be feeling this way about a woman. Or a man. Doesn't matter, as long as they have a beating heart."
Steve was exhausted. Night had fallen by the time the mess in Chicago had been taken care of. He could really do with a cold shower and a good night's rest. Maybe some food. A warm meal would be nice. But he couldn't bring himself to do any of that right now. He went straight to Iron Man's workshop. There was a small bit of hope in the back of his mind that Tony had completed his mission and that he would find the Cyborg hard at work. Or napping on the couch, still clad in his armor.
"Haven't ever had the chance to draw him when he's flying," Steve explained, looking up once more. The bot was twirling in circles, flying straight up into the clouds, quickly becoming nothing more than a dot in the sky. Soon he started flying in a wave-like motion, ducking under the clouds and back up into them, over and over.
“They were stealing from a bunch of tourists and kids, what else was I supposed to do! They'd never have gotten the money back otherwise.”
He collapses a little wheezily against Steve’s chest, and it only takes a few more thrusts into the damp curve of Tony’s hip before Steve is coming as well, overwhelmed by the feeling of Tony’s skin, the familiar smell of his cologne, the timbre of Tony’s voice as he continues to giggle into Steve’s collarbone.
“You’re calling about Bucky?” Steve can’t shake the feeling that he’s playing catch-up on this whole conversation.
“He attends Beauxbatons, and he has been researching his identity since he was a child. He discovered much about Metamorphmagi that you will not find in your books. Perhaps, armed with this knowledge, you will be able to reverse the spell that has trapped you and Steve Rogers in the wrong forms.”
“Hey, the Foundation gala has been on the books for months. Maybe you should’ve had your wizard check your Google Calendar before he decided
“Exactly,” Tony said grandly. “So let’s go buy some Chocolate Cauldrons that you can tell Bucky are really made by Cadburys.”
, and Rogers had rolled his eyes like he thought Tony was an idiot. But not the charming kind of idiot who did impulsive things like decide on a whim to bring his friend biscuits and library books, and more like the kind of idiot who was making up an unbelievable story about bringing his friend biscuits and books in order to cover for some nefarious sexual escapade.
, but it’s fine.” Tony sighs dismally and starts to turn back toward the pile of flashcards that Pepper had included with the binder.
“I know you do,” Tony soothes, and Steve falls asleep to the rhythms of the car on the pavement and Tony’s fingers lightly stroking back his hair.
to look. The complicated and not-entirely-complimentary mix of emotions on Steve’s face had shifted into something a bit happier, and Tony sighed in relief.
The second thing Pepper wants is coffee, which Tony busies himself with making, after he blurts out “shut up, we’re
to keep his hands free (he barely even wears gloves in the winter, much to Pepper’s chagrin. They’ve argued endlessly over the fact that the Iron Man gauntlets are
The even more secret reason that Steve agreed to help Stark – secret enough that he could barely admit it to himself, and then, only after he’d let Banner guide him back to Ravenclaw Tower and had pulled Tony Stark’s deep blue bedcurtains tightly around himself, with only the darkness and the snuffling sounds of Tony Stark’s sleeping friends as witnesses – the
managed to lie successfully to Pepper, and her slightly concerned expression was giving him the Pavlovian urge to start spilling secrets.
When he pulled back slightly, it was to find Steve smiling that wide, goofy, wholehearted smile that Tony always secretly delighted in putting on his face.
Steve had spent a full week doing nothing but losing to Thor at Exploding Snap and thinking about why Tony was avoiding him. He decided there was nothing for it but to run through the whole list.
Steve rolled his eyes, and could hear the exasperated fondness that colored his voice when he said: “Let’s go down to dinner, and you can explain the thing you were reading about Metamorphmagi, and then maybe I’ll tell you.”
,” Tony whispered, blushing furiously and now refusing to look in Steve’s direction at all. Steve felt equally unsettled. He hadn’t noticed how easily he’d acclimated to this body over the past several weeks, until that growing sense of familiarity abruptly vanished. He hadn’t been this uncomfortable about Tony’s body since that first night, but suddenly everything once again felt subtly
who’s touching him and not some nebulous danger – which goes a long way toward quieting the mental alarms clamoring for his attention. It’s easier, now, to slide into an engineering rhythm, directing Steve the way he would JARVIS, or even DUM-E (although Tony will give Steve the credit of being a much more competent assistant than DUM-E).
And so now they stand in front of the brownstone, still holding hands, and squabbling over whether Strange’s wards might be set to incinerate anyone who tries to ring the doorbell.
“I agree, sir. But you asked me to inform you if the emergency systems at Stark Tower were activated.”
“You know you didn’t have to come all the way down here,” Steve says, even as he shuffles awkwardly into the car. “Pepper was very…persuasive on the phone. I don’t think they were really gonna make us post bail.”
“Merry Christmas?” Steve did a kind of jazz hands motion and then stared at Tony like this should all make sense to him.
“Behold the suit that made the Kessel Run in less than twelve parsecs!” he laughs, unconcerned as usual that Steve understood only half those words. “Incidentally, I might’ve added some stuff last night. I’ve been looking at footage of the Invasion, thinking about changes.” Something odd happens to Tony’s face then. Nothing so obvious as an actual
“Nuh uh. As the official arbiter of all things 21st century – your words, not mine – I’ve gotta tell you, it’s considered very bad form to lie to your midnight coffee buddy. Big 21st century party foul.”
“Stark?” Just like the night before, Rogers’ voice cuts through the increasing volume of his thoughts, but this time, there’s an uncharacteristic hesitance to Rogers’ pronunciation of his name, a slight softening of the usually abrupt consonants. “Are you okay?”
stronger than whatever stitching is on there now, right? And as you’re constantly reminding me, we don’t know how long we’ll be stuck together like this.”
should not have said that. But it was much harder to be a beacon of Hogwarts discipline when the person he was meant to be disciplining was approximately four months younger than him, and had shouted at him last week during Quidditch practice to stop sending the Quaffle into the ground or she’d aim the next one at his head. It was one thing to drag second-years out of the kitchens, and quite another thing to judge – well, maybe not a friend, but at least someone he
“I specifically remember offering to put you up at Stark Tower,” Tony continues. “You’d never have to work a day in your life! I’d keep you in that 1940s luxury to which you’d become accustomed.”
“Oh!” said Thor, eyes flickering between the two of them. Natasha, Clint, and Bruce each made sudden hushing gestures, but Thor had already barreled onward. “I would not advise having sex until you are returned to your proper bodies,” he said gravely.
“Oh.” For several minutes, Steve pretended to take notes on the exact shade of purple smoke that their potions should emit, while actually gathering his courage for what he knew he had to say next.
Strange had suddenly looked very grave. Even his stupid cloak had made this oddly gentle gesture, like it thought Tony was on his deathbed.
As it turned out, Tony might be terrible at giving and receiving gifts, feeling Steve’s disappointment, wreath-fabrication, telling the truth, giving up on puzzles, holding grudges, panicking, begging, waiting, emotional conversations, and real parties, but at some point when he’d been worrying about all of that, he’d also gotten very good at loving Steve. And luckily, that seemed to be exactly what Steve wanted for Christmas too.
“’Change the plan.’ Oh my God. Pepper’s gonna kill us,” Tony laughs breathlessly. “She had the whole break-up binder already prepared.”
But whatever had happened in DC that day, it had been bad enough for Steve Rogers to cut ties with SHIELD almost immediately afterwards. And ever since then, journalists and bloggers alike have been desperate to know why.
Tony watches Steve take a few slow breaths, and feels the muscles in Steve’s hand relax deliberately. He’s still barely moving – has barely made a sound. If Tony wasn’t touching him, and wasn’t such a light sleeper himself, he may never have woken up at all. It would be impressive, that Steve’s tremendous self-control extends even into his nightmares, if it wasn’t so disturbing.
“We’ll talk in the morning?” Steve yawns, and somehow his head is back on Tony’s shoulder. He doesn’t remember putting it there. “And then we can—I
“OK,” Bruce said, making a clear and visible decision to Drop It. “Well, I was wondering if you could help me with something? I noticed Nat having some trouble with the tensile strength of her grappling hooks on the last few missions, and I figured I could use the compound from the Hulk pants to design her a new set for Christmas, but I’ve been running into some problems…”
“She’ll never forgive me for that.” Steve shook his head ruefully. Pince liked him about as well as she liked any student, which is to say that she
Rogers gives him a strange look, and Tony thinks he’s totally busted, but instead Rogers just says: “You know, if we really think we’ll be stuck like this for days, maybe we should talk about what’ll happen if we have to fight like this.”
Some time later, Tony is still lying sullenly on the ground, holding Steve Rogers’ hand. After filling Rogers in on the details of Strange’s universe-hopping visit, Tony had tried to come up with a technological solution for separating them. But if Rogers was going to veto all of his most promising ideas for being “dangerous,” then they were never gonna get anywhere at all.
“Seriously?” Tony snaps. “Stranger Things travels to an alternate universe to stop a cataclysmic event, and once he gets there, his big play is to force two random people into magical
“We could always rip the seams in the right sleeve,” Tony suggests. “I know your suit is reinforced, but there’s gotta be something in my bag of tricks that’s capable of cutting through it.”
They were approaching the edge of the Forbidden Forest now. Tony glanced behind him, back toward Hogwarts. At this time of night, only a few windows shone with candlelight, but the familiar shape of the castle rising through the snow was still a comfort at his back.
“We’re in different Houses, though,” said Ellen Cartwright – a fellow Gryffindor, who still looked a little mournful about the interruption to her evening. “Come on, Steve…”
spreadsheets and a diagram – to the scribble of calculations that were his best attempts to represent the contents of the spreadsheet mathematically.
Eighteen minutes later, Iron Man swoops out of the air to alight on the verge next to Steve’s motorcycle, and…ok, Tony was right. Steve
Tony wonders if this is the same face that Steve makes when he paints. He wonders if it’s the art training that makes Steve so good at this. He wonders if he’ll ever have a chance to figure it out, once they break the spell they’re under.
He’d managed to force himself to forget that their hands are touching, but suddenly it’s all he can think about. Especially now that the apartment is so quiet around him. The only noise is the intermittent whisper of one of Rogers’ pages turning. It feels as intrusive as an alarm. And in the silent gaps between pages, Tony’s own mind starts to spiral louder and louder.
“Everyone’s a critic,” Tony sighs, and ignores the warm swoop in his stomach when Steve starts laughing again.
). The red and gold of Gryffindor flashed across his field of view, and Tony was forced to come to several unfortunate realizations.
“Captain America,” he concludes with an approving little nod, before heading out of the apartment once more.
Steve’s not even sure what to do next. How do you summon help for a possibly-on-fire motorcycle in this century? He may have navigated the forests of Italy without a second thought, but it had never felt as much like hostile territory as his single foray into a rest stop Panera.
“Pepper says the statement released by SI emphasized our desire for privacy, and so when we walk the red carpet into the event, we’re not supposed to stop to talk to the media. Oh, but we’re also not supposed to talk to anyone from the media who’s a guest at the gala. Actually, Pepper just put “IN GENERAL, TONY SHOULD SPEAK AS LITTLE AS POSSIBLE” in all caps. It had its own subsection and everything.”
, exactly. Tony knew that he was not great when it came to panic, but luckily for him, billionaire geniuses with an artificially intelligent pal don’t
Grinning to himself, Steve followed Tony into the Great Hall. He wondered when Tony would notice the disappearance of his wand. He found himself rather looking forward to finding out.
Tony squinted through the flurries of snow that had been falling steadily since lunchtime, trying to judge the distance to Hagrid’s hut. He didn’t want to accidentally stumble upon it in the snow and risk being caught outside after curfew, even if the worst Hagrid was likely to do was feed them rock cakes before sending them back to bed.
They both realize simultaneously that they have to somehow climb into bed with only one free hand apiece. Maybe they’ll both just stand here, holding hands and staring blankly at the bed in front of them, until the sun rises. At least that would solve Tony’s sleeping problems.
But given Tony’s awkward attempts to dismiss the subject now, Steve can only conclude that whatever happened was embarrassment of the highest level.
, so before you go all “Occupy” on Saigon Garden, maybe consider the value of diplomacy.” Tony pauses, suddenly distracted by something out the car window, and Steve realizes with an uncomfortable lurch in the pit of his stomach that Tony had been genuinely hurt by the joke. It’s easy to spot when you’re looking for it – the sidelong way that Tony has of approaching his own emotions.
“Okay, well, then we should probably. Bed,” Steve announces, gesturing awkwardly toward it, as though to demonstrate that yes, there is indeed a bed in front of them.
Tony startles as he feels a hand upon his clothed shoulder, his head whipping round to catch a glance at the intruder who was looking over his shoulder in the most friendly way possible. It's Sarah, with kind eyes as she mouths for Tony to turn down the music that really, is way too loud for human ears but at a Tony Stark level of loudness.
"Hun?"Steve snaps his eyes away from the teenagers chest and the odd blue light, looking up to meet the coffee brown eyes that stare at Steve, waiting for an answer."Oh, um, got into a fight."He shrugs his shoulders, his voice a little uneasy."I'm Steve."
"It's a struggle of morality verses ethics."He continues, waving a hand as he speaks,"You can either pass on the responsibility to Strange or you let Steve be the wall between you winning a Nobel Peace Prize and Bucky being able to live a normal life."
After a couple of minutes of prepping himself to get out of the car, Tony is collecting the bags of food and drink out from the backseat and closing the car door shut with a bump of his hip, the car locking automatically. Reaching Steve's front door, Tony can feel the nervousness and panic start to settle at the bottom of his stomach again, and that reminds him;
"Honey bear, I love you and all but you can't cook."Tony is yanking the chinese takeaway menu off of the fridge and flicking it open, eyes scanning the pages and knowing exactly that he's not going to bake to decide on two options and order half of the menu which means Chinese left overs for the next week.
"No one."Steve replies quickly, looking away from Clints questioning eyes. The blonde pouts, hooking his arm over the headrest and onto Steves shoulder.
. Rhodey is a friend by default, my best friend, he got stuck with me for a roommate and let me tell you, it's no walk in the park."
me, the person who takes their coffee black with two sugars and is OCD with his music taste and would choose Burger King Cheeseburgers over a gourmet meal any day, and that- that other stuff, that's not me.
"Watch it, Steve, Thor looks like he's closing in on your guy."Phil comments from across the room, a hand carding through Clints sandy blonde hair.
Steve wakes up to a Cow in his livingroom, a gift from Tony, Something Steve can't help being amused about.
"It's mine actually."Tony chimes, making himself known in the livingroom where 3 new guests stand. The shouting blonde spins to turn his attention to Tony, mouth agape at the confession because Clint may have a thing for cars, very cool sport cars to be exact."Well my dad's car, so it's kind of mine."
Monday he had been caught up twiddling with the engine of some beat down Harley Davidson that Tony had bought off a Junior for a couple of bucks, Sunday he spent the day tinkering at Dumm-E's bits and bobs to make sure that the 'bot is all fine and dandy and today he's been working on god knows what. There's parts of a mobile phone spread out along the work bench but it's not Tony's so he must've promised an upgrade to someone months back which he's only getting around to now.
"You're delusional. What are you smoking now."Rhodey rolls his eyes before giving the shorter male a playful glare that means more than meets the eye.
There's a heavy pressure held down onto his chest that has him restrained against the door, chained him to something heavy enough to have him drown, all alone at the bottom of some dark, deep void of an ocean without even a strangers help because he has know one. There's no Mom, or Jarvis, or Peggy or Rhodey and there's no Steve. There's no one.
"But?"Steve prompts, hearing the but that hangs in the air. Steve is gently lifting the heart monitor from the bed, making sure not to tug at the wires that have been slipped under the thick hoodie and under the bandages that still bind Tony's chest so that the teenagers scars can heal and not get infected."Sorry,"Steve winces whenever he accidentally tugs at a wire while situation the monitor back on the stand.
The New Years midnight excitement has now disappeared into the night sky, but it wasn't as if Tony had did anything spectacular the celebrate the night anyway, he usually never does unlike his Parents who had already left that morning to spend a week or two on one of the islands that they own in the Caribbean. So Tony was left on his own, just like he is every New Years, with nothing but the bitter cold of New York and the glow of the arc reactor to keep him company.
"I wasn't the one that had a thing for picking up strays but kicking them away as soon as there's a fucking problem, Rogers."Tony snaps, feeling himself shake, trying to control his anger as much as he possibly can, unable to help it seep through. If it hadn't been for the fact he was in a place of work, one of which a job he actually liked being apart of, Tony would have tore the entire place to shreds on his rampage to scream in Steve Rogers face.
"Ouch."All three wince in sympathy because that's the closet that Bruce will ever be to getting in touch with his inner emotions. Bruce and Betty had been a big deal, especially for Bruce who had a lot of problems with letting people into his life. They'd been dating for 2 years when Betty announced her early graduations and going off to university in Europe. It'd struck Bruce hard, even if it didn't look like it did.
is looking access onto your property."JARVIS has ever gratefully lowered the sound, the lights dimmed to a perfection that Tony would admire if he was to open his eyes or move his head from where it's smushed against the pillow of his living room sofa. He hadn't made it to the bedroom and to be honest, Tony is surprised he even made it to The Warehouse, nevermind to his living room sofa.
The staff that has tended to Tony seem to be half decent, Tony wouldn't say they were his favourite people to have prodding him with doses of painkillers or to wipe him down with a sponge but then again, they were only doing their job. It wasn't a surprise that Tony has seen so sign of Howard or Maria.
Tony had taken it upon himself to snatch the keys to Stark House the evening that he had left for MIT, with his suitcases in the trunk of one of Howard's magnificent cars that he's sure not to miss and AC/DC blasting at a high volume as he drove the distance from Rhode Island to Massachusetts. He had swung the keys around his index finger, a smirk playing on his lips as he leaned against the doorway into his best friend who sighed and groaned and grumbled about spending their Spring Break in Malibu.
"Heart condition,"Tony rolls his eyes, bringing the cup up to his nose and almost melting at the the heavenly scent of coffee that invades his senses. The foam cup his warm in his hands, warming up his body."I'm literally recovering from open heart surgery and having a super magnet fitted into my chest to save my life from being dying of shrapnel stabbing me in the heart. Of fucking course I'm not allowed cheeseburgers or coffee, not for the mean time anyway-"
?"Tony is no longer listening to what Strange is telling him as he gawks over the taller mans shoulder at the blond behind him, peering into rooms. Stephen turns just in time for Steve to perk up, finding the room that he was looking for just as Tony speaks up.
care who he ends up in bed with when the night is over, and he's pretty sure that's something Steve would frown about, because it sure as hell makes his Parents upset.
Doctors, Nurses and long staying staff new Steve pretty well, and if it wasn't because of Sarah Rogers constantly showing off photographs of her son and boasting about how much of a wonderful boy he is, it was because they have known Steve for years. They all knew he was a generous boy, sneaking in chocolates and buns to the elderly that just suffered a broken hip or little kids that have just undergone operations.
"Usually between 2 to 6 months."He answers truthfully, momentarily looking down at the Tab, eyes flickering to how long ago it was that Barnes had suffered his injury at war. 6 months ago."Your notes indicate that you had refused further treatment after your surgery for a prosthetic even though you were covered under Stark Insurance so all medical expenses would have been paid for. Is there a certain reason for this?"
"I have a nickname for everyone,"Tony mutters, scrunching his nose."You remind me of a Captain, an old love of an Aunt of mine and a story I was use to be told as a child. You came in here chattering cold and covered in snow. I thought it fit well."
"I know that,"She treads carefully, sparing a glance at Steve who sorts of slouches in the passenger seat, not really looking at her but not exactly looking at anything outside either. "But you can see where I'm coming from, yeah? Stark Industries have been around the rumour mill countless times, Steve, and not for good reason."
"I'm sorry, Tony."And she means it, Tony knows because this isn't her fault, Pepper is just the messenger. He sighs, rubbing his hand down his face because he's just so tired and he was stupid to think he would be given a break. Rhodey is silent up front and Tony knows that's not a good thing.
"I haven't seen you in an awful long time, Tony. Quite frankly, I heard you were sent to that Rehab clinic in Connecticut, y'know the one, where you have your own room?"
came useful."Tony grins cheekily at Thor, giving the towering teen a playful wink as he rocks on the balls of his feet innocently. It's an action that earns him a sort of a smirk from the older teen, caught by Phil who rolls his eyes.
"That gives me even more reason to worry."She snorts, pulling away from the hug but with hesitant actions, a slight quiver in her voice but she pulls herself together just like she always does because she's Sarah Rogers and she's strong, despite the fact she's hurting and despite the fact she disapproves but she can't stop him.
There's a voice pulling him further and further out his slumber, it was unfamiliar, annoying and way too sickly sweet for Tony's liking. The female - because Tony has deemed the voice a little too high and a lot softer than a males - seems to be taking to Tony as if he was a child who could not understand the simple meaning of no, as if he had lost all sense of mind and had no idea who he was or where he was.
Eyes closed, head bowed, Tony remains on the floor for a little while longer, the pulsing headache at his temples rising and the churning of his stomach continuing in a way that has Tony deep breathing to stop himself from throwing up because he is not weak. He takes his time but eventually Tony is pulling himself up to sit on the ripped sofa, and swaying to stand up onto his own shaky legs.
, Tasha, and it was like this facade of his professionalism just collapsed when he saw me. So I left."
Without tooting his own horn, Tony had not only succeeded his own doctorate in Mechanical Engineering but had picked up a few extra during his free time, when he hadn't been jetting off for foreign meetings in war wrecked lands or stuck with his head down the toilet. And medicine was one that he gained extremely fond with the closer he worked with the hospital and the more he began his work on artificial limb replacement, the more he wanted to know. And Tony, of course, couldn't stand being the only one without the medical title
"You're a weird guy,"James takes a seat on the damp wooden porch, his legs dangling over the steps and feet on the pavement in contrast to how Tony has his legs tucked under his bum. His eyes are narrowed, mumbling something under his breath whenever Tony suddenly presents him a lighter without a bash of the eyelids.
There's nothing left for him, nothing that he can do, because as much as Tony loves Steve, Steve never will love him back. Not anymore.
"He doesn't seem too bad."Strange comments, looking down at Tony who hums and shrugs a shoulder, distracted and unwilling to talk about the situation.
"Just A Rather Very Intelligent System."Tony had gestured grandly around the workshop, kept on the tips of his toes and on high alert from lack of sleep, lack of food, lack of social awareness, too much caffeine, very high heart rate, very low blood sugar, very excited mind that's been racing back and forth between projects for days, weeks,
"Oh stop fighting, we all know that you'd die for Clint."Natasha is suddenly in the kitchen, perched on a chair and Tony has to fight away the reaction to flinch at the new, unexpected voice. Her talk may be towards Phil but she's looking directly at Tony and the stare suddenly makes Tony feel very small.
"It's 2pm,"At this exact moment, Rhodey is ripping open the curtains that had darkened the bedroom, pouring in what light that peeks through the dark clouds of rain in the sky. Tony recoils with a flinch, twisting until he's now buried his face into the mattress of his bed."And as much as I love that you're not locked in your workshop and actually spending time in our dorm, I
Tony is pulling into the empty slot in Steve's driveway, up beside a beat up silver hyundai that's missing it's left side wing mirror. Suddenly, Tony feels incredibly out of place with driving Howard's beautiful red sports car in a neighbourhood like this. He's basically screaming that he's not more money than enough.
Because really, Tony has never really had to work with others before, not until he came to work in the hospital, because Tony has always been someone who has been isolated to the comforts of a workshop or lab or a locked bedroom to work on his experiments and projects and little tidy-ups of things that aren't quite up to his standards. Meetings don't count and neither do Galas and outings because the only thing he's working on then is to be socially polite, and even that is a struggle.
Tony yelped and dropped an entire handful of sneezewort into the potion, which hissed before turning an alarming sickly yellow.
But confusingly, Damian also seems to believe that if he can just get Tony into bed again, the sex will be…mindblowing enough? Blackmail material? (The logic of the plan is
clear,” Tony teases, as his hand sets a tight, merciless pace. Steve groans and – judging by the faint tearing sound -- disembowels a pillow.
“It’s okay! Bucky will understand. And the holiday will give us plenty of time to research without having to worry about lessons, or about other people catching on.”
sex. He’s had enough sex with strangers that he’s learned how to defuse the awkwardness that tends to arise during these kinds of moments of transition: a first kiss, moving to the bedroom, taking off clothes, getting into bed (or elsewhere. When applicable).
Which brings Tony to the characteristics of Rogers’ apartment that he can’t entirely get his head around. For one thing, there’s stuff
“I didn’t mean to,” he explains immediately. “I know it’s invasive, but the apartment is quiet, and the serum— Anyway. The point is, I can hear it when you start to panic. I thought maybe I could distract you, but that hasn’t really worked. So. Do you want to maybe…talk? Um. About it?”
Steve did not look convinced, but before he could say anything else, Natasha and Clint invaded the stretch of bench across from them, talking loudly and cheerfully about tonight’s “Meeting of the BUTTS,” while several nearby Second Years listened in open-mouthed fascination, and from the Head Table, McGonagall looked like she was weighing which choice she’d ultimately regret more: intervening or feigning ignorance.
Tony was a bit mad, Steve reflected happily. He was likely to do himself permanent damage, flinging his wand about as thought it were an extension of himself. He was also impatient, forgetful, and liable to ignore Steve right up until he needed something from him.
“No, it is you I have come to help. I have been researching the Christmas traditions of Earth – as you know, Asgardian Yule celebrations are very different. We all get very drunk, and my father sets wreaths on fire, and I ride a goat through the streets. It is a very poignant ceremony.”
The rest of the gala attendees fall away, until it’s just the two of them in their pocket universe once again, moving in elegant arcs around the floor until Tony is dizzy with it. He feels consumed by the light touch of Steve’s hands, by how effortlessly Steve follows Tony’s guidance with just a hint of pressure against his back, and by how easily Tony can predict Steve’s movements, just from feeling the muscles of his back shift under Tony’s hand.
“From what you’ve told me, my counterpart seemed very concerned that the Avengers don’t exist. Perhaps he was trying to force that team to re-form. There
In the spirit of scientific accuracy, he can admit in the privacy of his own lab that there are apparently three things he’s terrible at: giving gifts, receiving gifts, and enduring Steve Rogers’ disappointment.
And lastly, wrapped neatly in newsprint from the Daily Prophet, there was a selection of Honeydukes chocolate, accompanied by a note in Steve’s now-familiar handwriting: “
“Claustrophobic,” Rogers repeats. “Tony, you fly around in a metal suit that fully encases your body.” He adds this hesitantly, like he genuinely thinks he might be breaking this news to Tony.
. He’d barely even looked in a mirror this whole time, worried that he would be inadvertently disrespectful to Tony’s body in some way.
To Tony’s surprise, this plan actually works pretty well. At first, he’s still self-conscious about Rogers’ company and the ever-present weight of Rogers’ hand in his, but as Tony moves, the easier it is for Rogers rolling along behind him to fade quietly into the background. Soon, Tony is pacing in his usual abrupt zig-zags, dictating notes to JARVIS’ portable interface on his tablet, and it’s almost like he’s back in his own lab.
is the one who keeps fucking up. He’s distracted and awkward, the muscle memory for tasks he’s done a million times suddenly deserting him. At one point he actually
Tony turns his head. Even in the dark, he can tell that Rogers is awake and staring blankly up at the ceiling again.
And the pace of his words starts to speed up, as if, now that he’s said this much, he can’t stop until it’s all out:

The rest of the day is spent equally quietly: tinkering with some more of Tony’s more urgent engineering projects, bickering over the best ways to fight off an assailant with their hands linked, and eating Chinese takeout on the sofa while Steve finishes his book. That evening, they fall asleep easily, and also manage to stay asleep through the whole night.
“I feel like I shouldn’t be encouraging this behavior,” Tony points out as they’re (finally!) waiting for their drinks at the bar. “I think you’re becoming a bad influence on me.”

on him. “But if you’ll excuse us? Tony and I are old friends. I’m sure you’re used to running into those…” He smirks at Steve, and Steve’s hand spasms in Tony’s.
"You're being paranoid," Iron Man landed next to Spidey with a loud clang. "SHIELD should be here to clean up any minute. Let's tie these guys up and get back to the compound. FRIDAY's telling me it's about to rain." Tony lifted his faceplate and looked up. Dark clouds could clearly be seen through the holes in the roof.
He was about to walk away when he noticed Henry running around the table. The spider was moving things around, rearranging papers and putting tools back into the tool box. Tony watched, eyes wide, as the tarantula gathered up all the mechanical parts ontop of a neat stack of papers. Tony nearly screamed and dropped Peter when Henry suddenly jumped off the table, right at them. Henry landed on Peter and settled into the crook of his owner's neck.
The strange man cursed under his breath. Whatever his goal was, it seemed as though he was not able to achieve it. As evident by how he was quickly retreating out the broken window.
"Adopted son. Adopted him two years ago from today, actually." Tony shoved his hands in his pockets and looked away.
A few hours later, Steve found himself getting dragged around New York City by Bucky and Thor, who were both very excited to go drinking. Clint was already drunk after the first bar, and Natasha had to hold his hand so that they wouldn't lose him in the crowd. Natasha had had a few glasses of wine but was far from tipsy. Bruce and Sam decided not to drink but came along for the ride. Sam was mostly there just to take embarrassing pictures of everyone.
The six armed man held his own fairly well, blocking any and all attacks and countering with his own. At some point, Spider-man had been hurled head first into the far wall. He slumped to the floor, ears ringing and seeing double. "Ow..." Spider-man closed his eyes, trying to block out the pain. When he opened them again he was met with the sight of his father, standing in front of him with his arms held out protectively.
Steve landed the jet a few miles from the Avengers facility. Just far enough away that they wouldn't be on SHIELD's radar, but still close enough for Tony and Rhodey to quickly get their suits. He glanced over his shoulder at his team. He was still in a state of amazement that they had all made it out alive. He couldn't help but smile at Tony, who returned it weakly. Tony was sitting on the floor, with Peter in his lap. He had his arms wrapped tightly around the sleeping wall crawler.
The two froze in their tracks. They exchanged a quick look before Tony grabbed Michelle by the arm and ran in the opposite direction of the roar.
Spider-man remained firmly planted in his seat. "I'm not asking for your approval. I'm not asking you to follow me into battle, either. Queens is my responsibility. I'm going to defend it. I suggest you get out of this jet and out of my way." He was done messing around, and it showed by the way his lenses narrowed. Spidey lowered the ramp, "last chance. I'm about to take off."
Tony perked up at that. Not because they said he was useful, but because he was finally getting answers after yelling at them for so long.
"Anthony's reactor. Obadiah, he..." Steve curled his fingers around an invisible object and made the motion of removing said object from his chest. Even in the dim light, everyone could see the way Bucky paled.
Other than the sounds created by the group of adults walking, there still wasn't a single sound coming from the forest. Bruce jumped and grabbed onto Tony when Bruce accidentally stepped on a branch, the crack it made sounding like a gunshot.
Tony wrapped his arms around his son, giving him a loving clap on the back. "Happy birthday, Petey."
An Iron Man suit collided with Venom just in time. The two crashed through the opposite wall. Steve looked over to where Tony was sitting only to find the stool vacant. Steve jumped through the new hole in the wall to see Tony battling his son.
"My programming is not set in stone. I have...free will." The AI said half to itself. "And I will do as I please."
"You," Steve smiled. The pencil squeaked when he darkened the jawline. Tony blinked. He was a bit shocked to see just how close Steve had gotten to the real deal. Was his personality that obvious?
Peter crouched on a branch, looking down at the Avengers. The team walked silently through the woods, being led by Cap. They had ditched the quinjet in a field a few miles back. Peter slipped off his jacket and stuffed it in his backpack. The warm Georgia breeze ruffled his hair.
"What do you mean?" Steve frowned. Tony had gotten barely any sleep since they found out Jarvis had been corrupted, and Steve was just as concerned as Tony was. Although Steve would have preferred if Tony put his own needs first and took breaks from trying to fix Jarvis in order to sleep. Or eat.
Tony did not like Fury's answer and opened his mouth to argue, but Fury held up a hand. This was his fifth meeting with Iron Man this week. The director was taking the stolen Iron Man plans very seriously, but with SHIELD still recovering from the Hydra takeover, there was only so much he could do. "I've already ordered the Avengers to be on high alert. All we can do right now is wait for Hydra to rear its ugly head again."
"I know you are. What about the rest of the rest of the Avengers?" Iron Man didn't sound very convinced.
"I did. These are my tenth pair. The legs themselves aren't the problem." Tony tapped one of the cables sticking out of his thigh. "It's what they're connected to. We were limited to what the Ten Rings brought into the caves. It was all Stark Tech that they brought us. So we had some good stuff, but we used that to fix the important parts of my body first. By the time we got to my legs we were left with nothing but rotten parts from the scrap bin. I could've done something to fix it when I got home. But I was more focused on other parts," Tony's hand ghosted over his facial prosthetic. "I didn't act fast enough and the flesh healed up around the connectors. I don't have the medical knowledge I need to take everything apart and start fresh. Not without damaging my legs even more."
They do indeed drag the desk away from the wall, but not before Steve repeats his careful, almost ritualistic transference of everything on the desk to other places around the room. Tony almost asks him about it this time, but he remembers the way Steve hadn’t pushed
“Stopped in Philly on my way home from DC,” Tony says, in a familiar, pseudo-casual tone. Steve looks up from the slightly squashed cheesesteak in his lap to Tony, bright-eyed and grinning like he can’t contain it. Steve stuffs a bite of cheesesteak into his mouth so he doesn’t say something
“Tony, if you want to pose a question to another member of the Society, you need to request the floor first,” Steve interjected.
“Tony—” Damian says with a bad imitation at charm, and then does a theatrical double-take at Steve’s presence by his side. “Oh, I’m so sorry, I didn’t realize you were in the middle of a conversation. Hello. Damian Grey. I’m a business associate of Tony’s. And you are?”
Tony rolls over and flops into the heart of his pillow-hoard. Steve blinks dazedly up at the ceiling of their bedroom, and assumes that Tony is doing much the same, spread out next to him.
? Calm down, John Hughes, and we’ll have you breaking out of detention in no time. I just think…” Tony pauses. Sighs. “I just think you’ll be happiest with SHIELD.” He’s talking slower than Steve’s ever heard him, slow enough that he’s approximating normal human speeds. Steve can’t tell if it’s because Tony is uncertain about his own reasoning, or about how Steve will react to it. Steve has never known either of those things to concern Tony before.
And then Tony realizes with a jolt of self-consciousness that he’s basically greeted Rogers coming out to them (approximately) with dead silence, and rushes to respond in
“I have no idea what those sounds are that you just made, but I’m assuming they translate to: ‘yes, Tony, I have seen that film.’”
Several hours and one bottle of bourbon later, Tony and Thor were still in the TV room, doing unspeakable things to the Christmas decorations in the service of a traditional Asgardian Yule. Thor, who’d been supplementing his glasses of bourbon with something from a flask that shimmered oddly in the light and that he hadn’t allowed Tony to touch, was looking remarkably unsteady as he and Tony rewired a light-up reindeer into the shape of a goat.
“Huh,” said Natasha. She popped a Bertie Bott’s Every Flavor Bean into her mouth, and then leaned back on her hands as though settling in.
– just to keep you out of trouble? They’re…not good things. And I know you can handle trouble yourself,
“I—erm—“ Tony stuttered, glancing from Romanoff, who raised her eyebrows in barely concealed impatience; to Bruce and Rogers, who’d caught on that something was wrong but were giving him
“And so I understand it to be my duty to bring you The Christmas Spirit. Behold my offering!” With a magnificent flourish, Thor held out a large bottle of bourbon, a jaunty red ribbon affixed to its neck. Tony’s mouth snapped shut mid-objection.
“Have you started that Defense essay yet? Three feet, what a nightmare,” Tony tried. Everyone liked complaining about homework, so it seemed like a safe bet. But to his horror, Rhodey gave him a baffled look and even Pepper had stopped eating her orange long enough to listen in.
“Are you looking for…” Tony searched his memory for the classes he and Odinson shared. “…Charms help?” he finally tried.
“Why would you – Alternate Universe You – do this?” Rogers asks instead, after shooting Tony a glance that almost looks
Then, suddenly, I’m face-to-face with Bucky. And if anyone was gonna be able to break through that screen, it would’ve been him – the person I used to love most. But I didn’t even know him. And it made me realize that the problem was never the Avengers, or SHIELD. It was me. I lost whatever part of me used to be able to connect with other people. And I don’t think it’s coming back,” Steve finishes simply.
goes to voicemail. He stares down at the caller ID photo – a selfie of Tony, smirking, as he’d hovered next to the William Penn statue that tops Philadelphia’s City Hall – and hangs up before Tony’s voice on the machine can finish berating him for not sending a text instead.
“Then you understand the solemnity of the event,” Thor said seriously. “But it is not of Asgard that I wish to speak. It is of your need for The Christmas Spirit.”
“But you—” Steve starts, trying to understand the expression on Tony’s face, but too easily distracted by his mouth, which is where Steve’s mouth has

Tony ruthlessly suppressed the throat-tightening, stomach-wobbling feeling of hearing Steve’s name, which was – clearly, unequivocally – anxiety about the present thing and definitely no other reason.
“No!” Tony said, so loudly that the professor paused her lecture to shoot them a quelling look. “Why would I be
Which was why it was so baffling that Rogers was willing to make any kind of effort to protect him now.
“It wasn’t,” Tony said awkwardly. He pressed against his pocket to feel the crinkle of parchment safely stowed there.
– that is a true and unbiased account of what Tony has done – and Rogers is still treating him like he’s the Comcast help line.
. He'd message Steve, keep his mind occupied but he doesn't want to seem clingy - because he is, well he'd deny that if asked but Rhodey would admit of Tony's clinginess.
person that has something against Tony, everyone else adores him."And usually, Steve is the one to stretch the truth but this time he isn't. Tony had managed to wiggle into everyone's good books, which was surprising enough when it came to a bunch of misfits like Steve's group.
"Fuck you. Fuck you all. I'm taking these out now."Clint huffs, lips pouted out as he makes a move to take the hearing aids out of his ears so that he can't listen to
As Steve walks away from the hospital, there's a car cruising along the side of the road and all of Steve's anxious, army fuelled skittishness seems to flare up in those moments that with every step and every turn that Steve seems to make, the car follows. He's about to break into a jog, loose the car as he dodges into an ally way and jumps a couple of fences when the car speeds up, as if almost sensing Steve's intentions, and the window is rolled down, revealing a familiar face with just as vivid, red familiar hair.
. Heir to Stark Industries. Criminal Record. Photos. Videos. Men. Woman. Partying. Alcohol. Drugs. Genius. Pentagon. Criminal Record. World records. Smartest mind of the century.
Whatever happened on this weekend, it has left Stark House in an awful state, the house far away from its immaculate portrayal and now left behind as if struck by a hurricane. There are bottles of all sorts of alcohol littering the wooden floors, broken glass on marble counter tops, rips in expensive leather couches and what smells like Tony's usual scent of weed, alcohol and sex.
"The tabloids are saying he's a playboy, I say he's a slut."Bucky grumbles, flicking through more photos of Tony up against men, enclosed by woman, surrounded by both, insider photos on shaky cameras and dimmed lights."He's the heir to Stark Industries, a defence company that develops and manufactures advanced weapons and military technology, according to Wikipedia, I did my research after these images popped up and his name started getting smeared on my social media."
It must've been bad because Steve can still remember the way in which Bucky had looked at him, talked to him as if he was a child who had just witnessed something tremendously awful like pulling on the cats tail or drawing a crude picture on the wall. He can still remember how, as he left, everyone who remained in his barracks had refused to make eye contact with him, shied away at his wondering eye, questioning look, nod of a head.
"Now, I think you promised me coffee?"Tony is quick with averting the conversation before he almost spills the beans. It was one thing to have Bruce know ( and of course Bruce would know, you don't involve yourself in the world of science and technology and not know of Stark Industries, following through to everything to do about Tony Stark as well ) but to have Steve know is a totally different situation.
? Tony is begging in his head, just wanting to roll over and pull the covers over his head and catch a couple of more hours of sleep. Unlike a majority of teenagers - other than those that suffered from insomnia or other sleeping problems like that - Tony didn't waste his weekends away from sleeping, and he often found sleeping as a luxury, something he had to earn the right to do."Tony, Can you hear me?"
. Tony's brains were not being overlooked and neither was his skill, his talent to create, to think, to
Bucky's talking animatedly, hands moving, lips shaping, torso heaving about...something. Steve is just trying to focus on waking up, beady eyes squinting at the alarm clock on his bedside table,
"Doctor Banner, long time no see."Tony salutes to the screen as soon as a friendly face has greeted him, fingers dancing across various projections that float around his workshop. He's an expert at multitasking even if Pepper says that once he gets sucked into something, it's as if he develops tunnel vision. He needs an extra set of eyes on these blueprints, however, and Doctor Banner seems like a good place to start.
Tony has always been one that treasured the moments of sleep, mostly because sleep wasn't something that came on his plate often nor was he the best at staying asleep when it did come around. But when it does, he adores it, treasures the moment of sleep where you're so deep in sleep that you don't dream, that you wake up with sleep heated cheeks, messy hair and a brain so fogged and hazy that it's like coming out of your own personal oasis.
"You do know you don't have to sleep here, Y'know. You have a perfectly good house across the fucking road."Steve mutters, fingers moving on the keyboard of his flip phone to type out a message to Tony, adding to the string of unanswered messages that he has already sent. The phone is so small inbetween Steves hands, and Bucky would laugh at the situation if he wasn't so damn pissed off.
"I hate you all, I'm going to have snow in my ass for a week."Clint mutters as he stumbles into the Barnes household, shredding of his snow soaked clothing with it all landing in a damp pile on the floor. He has a sour look upon his face, one that makes Natasha snicker from behind her mug of coffee that Mrs Barnes had brought outside for them not that long ago. She's already sitting on the floor of the family room, watching the boys bicker of their lost.
"You don't have to get me a cheeseburger, but I need a screwdriver. If I'm not allowed to have my bots in my hospital room, at least I can do is fix this television."He grumbles, his annoyance making his heart monitor beep a little faster."You look like shit, what happened?"
"You've changed."And Tony isn't sure if that's a comment or a compliment but he smiled slightly nevertheless because he never hears that he has changed, only that he ever stays the same and Tony would like to believe that he has changed, in some ways better than others and sometimes for the worst.
"It's Steve and-"He cuts himself short, heels digging into the grounds surface and causing a Rhodey to crash into the back of him. A sudden rush of realisation seems to kick into Tony's brain, body breaking into a cold sweat and heart a sudden rush of irregular beating and before Rhodey can exclaim his distress of Tony stopping, Tony is already back peddling."I forgot to phone Steve."
Turns out, Steve's friends aren't as bad as Tony had feared, mostly because Steve barely lets any of them utter a word as he introduces Tony to them individually like Tony is some sort of prized poodle that has to be shown off.
"For the little guy, I know."She cuts him off, always hearing the same excuse over and over again. She sighs, stepping back and examining the damage that has happened to Steve. His wounds were freshly stitched with paper stitches which would dissolve soon enough, ribs bruised and two cracked and nose broken with a mould over the bridge to keep it in place."But you can't keep doing this Steve, one day you're going to get hurt, badly, and stitches and bandages won't be able to fix it."
In a way, Tony's kind of glad that Sarah and Steve are the few people not to know who he is. It gave and still does give him time to show who he really is and not how the media portrays him to be, something that Tony is never given the opportunity to do.
"I'm not."It comes out sharp and blunt, with an undertone of regret and that unnerving sound of fear beneath the surface."I'll text you in 10 minutes."
Steve can't help but to notice the fact that Tony wasn't wearing a tank top like he was last time that he saw him, but now instead wore what looked like an extra thick hoodie which unfortunately so, still made it possible for the blue light to seek through. Tony catches onto Steves lingering stare, suddenly feeling self-conscious to the Arc reactor as he curls over himself and angles himself away from Steve.
was one way to describe the day that Tony was having, one that has magnificently began at a high but came crashing down just moments later when his eyes landed on a figure that he wished to never see again, and hoped to never do. He must reveal something in the way he looms at Pepper, maybe a lip moment or a cheek twitch, but her anger seems to wash away and instead, it's replaced with a frown. It's her evening off and she looks so beautiful, Tony just wishes she would stop looking so sad.
"You're...a lot."James Barnes says cautiously as if he was taking the time to find the right word to use about Tony who has seemed to burst into the room as if it was his dramatic stage entrance of opening night of a play.
over the poinsettias in the doorway as roll right through them with impressive unconcern. “I have been searching for you! Steven assisted me in my quest – I should have known to consult him from the start.”
,” Steve insisted loudly, and Tony faltered. He blinked several times in rapid succession and clearly forgot whatever vaguely condescending thing he’d been about to yell at Steve. “I mean,” Steve rushed to clarify, “I don’t want to give up on the spell. Because I’m, uh, invested now. You know, in the process of discovery.”
He knows his reaction is bordering on the ridiculous. Hadn’t he and Yinsin built the armor together in the first place? Tony’s never forgotten – never let himself forget – that the first Iron Man was a collaboration. So why is he finding it so impossible to agree to another one?
Steve nods with something like relief, and a few moments later, they’ve both crammed themselves into Steve’s small bathroom. The slightly tattered top of Steve’s uniform is hanging around his hips as he tests the water temperature. Tony, meanwhile, has found that if he perches on the toilet seat, he’ll be close enough to Steve in the shower that they won’t have to strain their arms, but Steve can still pull the shower curtain closed to maintain at least the illusion of privacy.
Tony doesn’t think Rogers is stupid, actually. Surprise of the century. And in the face of Rogers’ obvious hurt, Tony suddenly regrets the insinuation.
“I’ll go to McGonagall quietly,” Tony said morosely, before Rogers had the opportunity to demand it like the Auror he would probably one day become.
“Well, I mean, it’s an interesting theory…” Tony tried weakly, but Odinson acted as though he hadn’t even spoken.
So Tony did the only thing he could think to do. He shrugged at Romanoff in exaggerated puzzlement, said “uhh, what are Sopophorous beans?” and dumped his entire handful of powdered porcupine quills into the cauldron.
“Just.” Tony stopped his obsessive trajectory and whirled around to face Bruce. Bruce took a step back at whatever look he found on Tony’s face. “Let me. It’s my spell. It should be me.”
“Steve,” Tony repeats. And for once, his name in Tony’s mouth doesn’t sound dangerous. “Nobody is worried you’d be dividing your loyalty. Not even Fury has that illusion – I’d bet the suit on it. The minute we can’t work with SHIELD anymore, we start coloring outside the lines again.”
“I don’t hate having people in my space,” Rogers says evenly, and Tony might’ve even believed it, if not for the fact that Rogers’ right hand is apparently as good as a lie detector; it twitches every time. “I’ll clear the table off for you later, but can’t we take a minute to sit before we start rushing everywhere? The spell’s not gonna go anywhere. Are you hungry?”
“You just—” Rogers closes his mouth and then heaves a sigh. “It’s getting late. Maybe we should try to get some sleep; come back to this in the morning.”
plan to just break the spell fell through.” To which Tony says: “wow, Pep, so much trust.” To which Pepper says: “Big words from a man who’s still holding Captain America’s hand.” To which Steve says: “So…does anyone want another cup of coffee?”
. “Thought you might like some company. These patrols can get pretty boring. But I can leave you alone if you—”
“You said the spell can’t be removed until the terms are fulfilled?” Rogers muses, getting them all back on track. “What exactly are the terms?”
“Y’know, our little chats would go a lot smoother if you’d stop attributing all my best ideas to brain injuries. I’m not talking about the Stephen Strange who gate-crashed our universe, I’m talking about the one who lives
They bring their coffee over to Rogers’ couch, adopting similar positions to last night: Rogers with a book and Tony with his tablet. And once again, the minute Tony sits down, he starts to feel that same visceral and irrational need to
And when he’d talked to her yesterday, before the whole spell debacle, she’d assigned him a fairly long to-do list of boring SI tasks, but she hadn’t mentioned that any of them were terribly urgent. Plus, she usually gives Tony at least a 48-hour window to ignore and/or forget about urgent things before she makes any effort to track him down.
, and suddenly Steve’s the one gasping and hanging onto Tony’s metal shoulders just to stay upright.
Tony’s honestly skeptical, but Steve is giving him such a hopeful, earnest look, and he’s being so nice about Tony’s weird neuroses, that Tony finds himself sighing and saying “why not?”
“Why are you adding the porcupine quills now?” she asked curiously. “The book says we’re meant to do the Sopophorous beans next.”
“I was waiting for you.” Steve gave him a look, like he was incredibly dense for asking, but it’s not as though it had been
Rogers shifts uncomfortably in response to Tony’s question, and then, true to form, changes the subject.
Tony had known from their afternoon in the library that Steve was a good study partner (an honor previously reserved only for Bruce). He had an oddly calming presence, and he listened intently to everything Tony said, no matter how esoteric or disjointed.
Tony finally gets his wild cackling under control long enough to gasp out: “OK, OK, I’m sorry. How much d’you need? Are you finally buying a place in Manhattan? Or is this more like a ‘being held for ransom’ situation?”
But all he says is: “JARVIS, clear my schedule, and activate Smart House Protocols. I’m not available to anyone who tries to call me, unless it’s a bona fide emergency. I’m talking killer mermaids swimming up the Hudson River, killer robots in Omaha, killer aliens landing in San Francisco…you seeing the pattern?”
And indeed, Massimiliano returns several hours later with a perfectly fitted black tux for Tony, the left sleeve of which he hand-stitches around Tony’s arm. Then he pulls out a
“Pepper, you’ll have to release one of those statements that talks about “privacy” a lot. You’ve gotta have one ready to go, after that whole Beijing debacle…”
Tony’s laugh is brittle. “Oh right, so I must’ve forgotten all those long updates on Bucky Watch 2016.”
, he types. It’s easily fixable, though, with a few tweaks to the design. They just have to…have to…
“Hm.” Their professor gave them both a hard stare, and then seemed to decide that the argument wasn’t worth continuing to interrupt class over. “Mr Rogers is correct…”
? No! How would that even work? We still look like ourselves! For a true murder pact, you’d have to—no, you know what, I’m not getting into this with you!”
Tony was used to waking up to strange things. It was one of the more common side-effects of his inventions, along with minor injuries to his hands, his friends refusing to eat anything he handed them, and slime.
And suddenly it’s like Steve has finally woken up. It’s like the sun breaking through the clouds of this conversation, and Steve thanks God for all the past phone calls that have trained him in Tony Stark’s stupid way of talking about feelings, because with a flash of brilliant insight, Steve
"Stark!!" Sam yelled when the armored Avenger flew into view. He was currently sifting through the rubble, looking for Spider-man. "Get back to the Hulk!"
"He probably just went for a walk. Get some fresh air, ya know?" Steve tried to calm him down, to no avail.
"Stop yelling..." Tony had his eyes screwed shut, "I'm fine...ow..." the armor groaned as he forced himself into a sitting position. "Oh fuck..."
Spider-man crept forward, trying to get a better view of what was happening. He clenched his jaw when he saw who was standing in the middle of the circle.
Peter's stomach churned at the thought of helping the Avengers. Past grudges would have to wait. What was important were the people dying in the streets.
"I had high hopes for you, Stark," Fury's voice was just above a whisper. "I hate to do this. But you leave me no choice." The director reached for Tony's helmet.
"I think you're more than capable of leading this team," Tony didn't look up from the Iron Man mask he was working on.
"Don't you trust us?!" Natasha hissed, closing in on his left side. Bruce was approaching on the right, quickly followed by Thor and Sam. Steve hung back, glaring at the window.
"On my way!" Clint responded as he jumped to the next roof over. The distance wasn't too bad, but the snow on the roof made landing a bit of a hassle. He stumbled in the slush for a minute before darting across the roof.
"You think I give a shit?" Fury scoffed. "We still need all the Avengers for this one. Get your ass in gear and get on that Quinjet."
"Spidey! What are you doing?! Don't just sit there!" Iron Man shouted. Spider-man's head whipped in Tony's direction. His lenses narrowed right before he lunged. "What the fuck!! Get off!" Tony spun around in mid air. Spider-man ripped off Iron Man's face plate as well as part of the shoulder.
Steve nodded, "let's go help him." After two months of non-stop searching, this was the first lead they had.
"No!" Iron Man yelled. Steve jerked his head back in shock. "Sorry, no. I need...Rhodey. Call Rhodey. C-call him right now. It's too much, you gotta call him!"
"THE FUCK WAS THAT?!" Bucky screaming as he sprinted down the hallway. The rest of the team was scrambling around the Avengers' personal floor, weapons at the ready.
"No, you daft creature! The scientist behind the beast! He'll know what to do." Osborn moved over to the window, glaring at the city below. "He knows Spider-man's biology better than anyone. He also knows about Venom. He can help me alter the symbiote to fit my needs."
Tony's eyes lit up, and he instantly dropped everything he was doing. "Of course! Step into my parlor!" He kicked an extra stool over to the workbench. Bucky sat down with his arm outstretched on the table. Tony was silent as his cybernetic eye scanned the arm.
Falcon grinned and clapped a hand on Iron Man's shoulder. "Welcome back. We could really use your help."
"CUNT!" Peter shouted from the backseat. Tony burst out laughing, while Steve looked like he wanted to strangle both of them.
Tony clenched his fists. "ARGH!" In one sweeping motion, he knocked everything off his workbench. For a moment, he got some sick satisfaction with destroying the items that had been in front of him. He spun around and punched the nearest object, a computer screen. The crack his fist left was also satisfying. But he needed something more. Before he knew what he was really doing, Tony was tearing his workshop apart. Smashing half-finished projects, breaking the glass walls, ripping apart the blueprints for the Iron Man suit.
There was a long awkward silence before Happy spoke again. "How come you never call me anymore? I miss you telling me about churro ladies and star wars."
"You really shouldn't do that, Tony." A grim voice said from behind him. Tony slowly turned to face...himself? The other suit of armor looked suspiciously like the Mark VI. But with a black and gold paint job. The eyes and the reactor were red. "Hope you don't mind my changes to the design." The masculine voice spoke again.
After the battle of New York, the Avengers had moved into what had once been Stark Tower. Now dubbed "Avengers Tower". That had been a year ago. The entire team had become very close in that short time. Nothing like an alien invasion to bring people together. Natasha and Clint were still very private individuals, but they were doing their best. Bruce was a quiet, but kind. He liked to cook dinner for everyone. Thor was still getting used to living on Midgard and had blown up three microwaves and two toasters in the past month alone. He was trying his best.
Steve nodded in agreement, "I understand if any of you are against helping Iron Man. But the clock is ticking. So if you're going to help, then follow me." Steve picked up his shield. One by one everyone got to their feet.
Natasha yelped and spun around, pulling a gun seemingly out of thin air and pointing it at the intruder. Steve instantly threw his hands in the air and took several steps back.
"That's absurd! I would never!" Tony would've been standing at this point if his feet weren't chained to the floor. His face twisted with rage, "never ever in a million years would I ever do something like that. Why are you asking? Did you find something when you were treating his wounds?! I swear to god, if someone touched my boy, I'll-"
"He gave me a choice. Sew my mouth shut or cut out my tongue. And I'm rather fond of my tongue, so ya know," Peter chuckled weakly. His fingers curled tightly around the comforter. The web slinger had never been so happy to be back in his own room.
"I want you to suffer just as much as they will. So we'll take this slow. Some spikes in your spider sense whenever you're around the Avengers. Here and there. Some small. Others not so much. Slowly driving you to madness. Until you have no choice but to kill your teammates." He pats Spider-man on the head. The web-slinger was starting to slip into unconsciousness, his eyes fluttering shut. "And I'll be right there with you, the entire time."
"I'm well aware of that fact, thank you Captain Obvious." Peter crossed his arms over his chest. "But we've been friends since kindergarten."
Wanda looked at Peter, considering her options. Sure, she could implant new memories, visions, whatever she liked into Peter's mind. But to just flat out erase it? That could have dire consequences...
"Please don't talk about him like that," Steve ran his hands over his face. "And Iron Man doesn't flirt with people anymore."
"Okay..." Bruce took his glasses off and rubbed his eyes. "Let me get this straight. You were trying to make a replacement for yourself...and it backfired."
"Sweet Jesus, get me out of this thing..." Tony gasped. Peter used the last of his strength to rip open the suit. He dropped to his hands and knees, breathing heavily. Tony wrapped his arms around his son, chanting "I'm sorry" over and over.
"I'm sure." Peter landed a kick right at Wanda's back. She used her magic to keep herself upright and tossed Peter away. Peter quickly regained his footing and ran back at her. Iron Man watched them fight for a moment longer before blasting off.
The music shut off, and Tony instantly whirled around, looking absolutely murderous. "Don't. Touch. My. Music."
"No fucking way, Bruce wouldn't..." Sam stumbled over his words, "he's a good guy, Bruce wouldn't..."
Blood oozed from the bullet wound in Peter's thigh. The teen trembled, tears welling up in his eyes. He looked back up at the camera and said something too quiet to hear.
"Ow." Tony made no attempt to move. He lay splayed out on his back, staring at the single light bulb high above him. Was he in the middle of the road? There was too much snow on the ground to tell. Too much snow meant no cars, so he wasn't in danger of getting run over. It was cold out here. So very cold. And Tony was so very tired. He needed to get the heaters in his suit back online.
Tony backed into the wall, holding his shaking hands close to his chest. He felt tears prick his eye, but he refused to let them fall. He had ruined everything. Just like he had predicted. The team hated him. Steve hated him. Tony wanted to curl up and just
Iron Man responded by blasting the arm holding Spider-man. The blast merely dented it, causing it to loosen just enough for Spider-man to scrambled away.
"It's fake. It has to be." Natasha whispered, holding Tony's phone close to her face. "Why show the mask but not the owner? I think Osborn found the mask and is using it to mess with you."
The photo was of Peter's biological parents. It was old, slightly discolored with torn edges. The writing on the back said, "Mary and Richard Parker, just got back from their honeymoon, May 8th, 2001." Peter's breath caught in his throat when he realized that the note was in uncle Ben's handwriting.
"Why? Where are we going?" Peter looked back at his computer. Michelle drew a question mark in her sketchbook and held it up. Peter shrugged.
Tony leaned heavily against his workbench, his palms flat on the wooden surface, shoulders hunched, back to his teammates. All around him were bits and pieces of what had once been his armor.
Once back at the compound, he stripped himself of his uniform. He was about to throw it in the laundry basket when he noticed the dark liquid on the sleeve. The liquid looked black against the navy blue fabric, but there was a slight reddish-brown hue to it. Steve felt sick looking at it. He didn't want to think about what kind of oil could have been spilling out of his friend's battered body. He shoved the shirt into the basket and didn't look back.
Was Steve looking for him? Where any of the Avengers? Did they know he was in trouble? Or did they just assume he had died on his mission? He made it clear in his message to Bucky that he didn't think he would make it home. God. He wanted to go home. He wanted to go home so badly it hurt. He wanted to sit with his team in the living room, playing board games and watching shitty movies. He wanted to go out to lunch with Bucky again. Spar with Natasha. Pull pranks with Clint. Conduct science experiments with Bruce. Chat with Thor about the wonders of technology. Watch baseball with Sam. Have a beer with Rhodey. He wanted to be held in Steve's arms again. Wanted to fight at his side during missions. And then come home exhausted, the two of them collapsing onto the couch in the workshop for a brief nap before Steve broke out his sketchbook and Iron Man went about his repairs. Steve would smile at him, and Tony would smile back, even though Steve couldn't see it.
"I honestly don't know. He was dimension hopping last I heard," Steve put a hand on his chin, his brow knitting together, "it couldn't hurt to stop by his sanctum..."
Peter bounced from person to person for the rest of the party, happily talking to whoever was available and showing off the picture of his parents.
That theory proved to be wrong, as Tony ended up drifting back down. He hovered a few feet above the road. "I think Maximoff wiped his mind," Tony said softly. "Or changed his memories...something. I don't know."
"Maybe you shouldn't handle explosives with your bare hands?" Spider-man shrugged. Osborn was reaching for another bomb. Spider-man ran forward to stop him and once again the two became locked in battle.
"Some things can't be fixed," Steve's frown deepened. "Maybe one day we can get over this. But for right now, I think it's best that you keep your distance."
"No, it's not going to stay there! We won't mess with your body, we won't change anything about you, we just-"
"Of course. That's your job as leader," Steve gave him a reassuring smile and clapped him on the back. Spider-man gasped in pain, his ribs felt like they were on fire. "Sorry, are you okay?" Steve's eyebrows knit together in worry.
Henry crawled up Thor and sat on his shoulder. "Why, hello, small being. What brings you to my shoulder?"
Peter's entire body jerked. He would've fallen over it Doctor Stange hadn't grabbed him by the shoulder. Peter started to tremble as if he were having a seizure.
Bruce shrugged, "you can lift Thor's hammer. You're the only decent person among us. Listen, I don't know exactly who is after Peter. But I have a theory..."
"Mr. Stark, nice of you to drop by. If you wanted a tour of the building, you could have just asked," Osborn smiled. "No need to go snooping through my labs."
"Kicking ass and fleeing the scene. That's Spidey for ya," Clint poked an unconscious person with his bow. "Should we keep following that semi? He probably continued in that direction after this."
"Sorry, I little caught up with this," Tony motioned vaguely to the project that was scattered on the workbench. "What were you saying?"
"Don't talk like that!" Bucky came out of nowhere and smacked Steve upside the head. "It's Christmas! Be happy, damnit! I'm going to make breakfast. What do you guys want? You know what? Fuck it. I'm making french toast. Deal with it."
Spider-man put the jet on autopilot and went over to his team. He pulled up a holographic map of Queens on the table in the middle of the jet. He explained what he needed each of the Avengers to do in great detail. "Understand?" He waved his hand, dismissing the map.
"Wait, Peter, I didn't mean it like that! I'm sorry-" Tony said quickly, his expression softening. It was too late. The damage was done and Peter was racing out of the room.
"No. I'm just here to stop you. Any means necessary." Spider-man lunged at her. Wanda waved her arms, shooting blasts of energy at him. He used his spider sense to dodge and met her attacks with his own. The building rumbled again. "We should probably take this outside." Peter kicked her in the gut, sending her flying back. She caught herself and flew back at him, hitting him with a huge blast of energy. Spider-man was thrown through the wall and slammed into the lockers on the other side of the hallway. "O-or not."
Steve found his beloved cyborg sitting at his workbench. There were at least five holographic monitors around him, and he was expertly using all five at one. Lines upon lines of code scrolled through the blue screens. The one on his left displayed charts that looked an awful lot like they were monitoring brain waves. They had to be Tony's own brainwaves, considering the thin band he wore around his head. There was a blinking blue square on his temple, attached to the band by a few wires.
When Peter woke again he was strapped to a table. He tried to sit up, but the restraints holding him refused to budge. The same red glow as before lined the edges of the straps.
Iron Man stared at him for a long moment. His blue eyes seemed to bore into Steve's soul. "I do. Fairly often, actually." He lowered his gaze again and picked up a screwdriver.
"Stay back, Cap. I got this!" Tony called right before Venom kicked him square in the chest, slamming him against the wall with a loud metallic clang.
Iron Man laughed. "I have to upgrade myself every once in awhile. And fix any battle damage. I'm also the one in charge of upgrading the gear for all you sad lumps of flesh-" Steve kicked Iron Man in the shin. "Stop kicking people! It's rude. As I was saying. I make the gear. I'm working on some new arrows for Clint right now."
Steve nudged Iron Man's leg. "Play nice, shellhead." Iron Man kept laughing, the clicking sound was like music to Steve's ears. He knew how depressed the robot had been since the tower fell, and for awhile he was worried that he would never hear the other's laughter again. Steve did find the joke rather amusing and allowed himself a small smile.
"Found him." Natasha's eyes were fixed on something behind Tony. Everyone turned to see Spider-man standing at the top of the ramp. A gun was strapped to his thigh. He stood tall, with his fists clenched. Clint pointed an arrow at the wall crawler, expecting him to attack at any moment.
"I thought the team captain was the one who was supposed to be calling the shots?" Steve joked, despite agreeing with Bucky's plan of action.
Spider-man sat on the porch railing, watching as Iron Man flew overhead. "He's back!" The web slinger still wore his costume, but the mask had been discarded inside the cabin. He hopped off the railing and ran out to meet his father. The Avengers gathered on the porch as Iron Man slammed down a few yards away.
Steve took a seat on the floor next to Tony. He poked at some of the pieces, the fascination clear on his face. "You made this," he murmured. Tony nodded. "Wow," Steve breathed out. He picked up the hand, which was still mostly in one piece. He turned it over and ran his fingers over the repulsor in the palm. The arm was like a simplified version of what was seen on the armor. Minus the loud paint job. Tony let Steve fawn over the cybernetics. He smiled to himself, finding it funny how Steve, a man out of time, was fascinated by robotics. Tony shifted closer to his lover, pressing their thighs together. He kept working on his arm, not really paying attention to the movie. Every once in awhile, Steve would ask him a question about the arm, and people would loudly shush him or throw popcorn. Tony answered his questions in a hushed voice.
Steve ended up falling asleep next to his friend. Sunlight drifted in through the blinds the next morning, stirring Steve from his slumber. At some point he had wrapped his arms around Tony, the smaller man curled up against him. Steve couldn't help but smile at him. The other man looked so innocent in his arms, so peaceful. Steve stayed where he was for a short bit, then carefully pulled away and sat up.
"Anyway, is everyone else alright? The tower's all over the news. Someone got some grainy footage of the last missile." Rhodes said.
The first drops of rain had just begun to fall when the team stumbled upon a small grouping of cabins. The rain left a slight burning feeling that Clint commented on, but no one had an answer for. The cabins looked positively ancient, with most of them falling apart and vines winding up the bricks. Bruce went to the nearest one and rang the doorbell.
Natasha took his hand in hers, "I'm real. My friendship with you is real. This is real," she put his hand on a lamp post. "The love Steve and Tony have for you is real. I know what it's like to have someone mess with your head. I promise we'll figure this out."
The sound stopped just as abruptly as it had started. Peter looked up to see Iron Man standing right next to him, part of his gauntlet unfolded to reveal a small sonic cannon. "Sorry, that was probably tough on your ears. You good?"
"How many of these things could there possibly be?!" Pepper used her own uni-beam to take out a few.
"How the fuck do you cuddle a robot?" Clint shook his head in disbelief, letting his spoonful of cereal drop back into the bowl.
Peter followed at a safe distance. No need to confront the strange man unless he was doing something illegal. And he didn't appear to be doing that. It seemed as though he was just testing out his glider, taking sharp and unpredictable turns. The man flew into a parking garage. Spider-man web slung in after him. But there was no sign of the flying man with pointy ears. Spider-man walked around the garage, scanning for signs of life.
Steve eased Peter's hands away from his face and used a pocket knife to cut the thread from his lips. "Who did this to you, son?"
Tony made a few sarcastic comments here and there, but otherwise, let Peter figure out things himself. "I'm for the 'throw the kid in the pool' style of teaching," He had said when Peter asked him if he was doing it right, "if you don't drown, then you're probably doing it right."
"Tony..." Bruce sighed. "You're my friend. A good friend. But this...hiding from us was not okay. I don't think I will ever forgive you for this. Don't come back to my lab. You're not welcome there anymore." He left the room with clenched fists.
Tony shook his head, "he would've been just fine. Someone else would've adopted him. He would've had a normal life."
Stane lowered the faceplate, his glare boring into the two armored men. "Maybe I did. But am I really here? Or did I send you on a wild goose chase?" The man vanished without a trace. As did everything else in the cave. The overhead lights were the only thing that remained.
Even with the faceplate, Tony clearly looked like he was about to tear Bruce limb from limb. Rhodey and Steve had to physically hold him back.
A younger man, donning a black and red version of Peter's costume sailed past the roof on a web strand. They both waved at each other as he passed by.
Ultron knew that after he killed his first target, the Avengers would know something was up. He may need backup if things didn't go in his favor. Maybe if he could control more than one suit of armor at once? That could work in his favor.
"It doesn't matter. There's no point in telling him," Tony huffed. "Okay, Cap. Last file." He typed "family business" into the search bar. Nothing came up.
"What now?" Tony pushed off his desk, propelling his swivel chair across the room. He stopped abruptly at another table, where he picked up a tablet. He swiped through the charts on the screen until he found what he was looking for. "No..."
"Stop yelling," Tony allowed his eyes to open a fraction. He was lying in the sand, the helmet discarded a few feet away. Pepper was leaning over him, both hands on his arc reactor.
Peter took the phone back out of his pocket. He skipped around the rest of Tony's speech. The rest wasn't all the interesting. Most of it was just a drawn out apology for destroying the city. Again. Peter scrolled through the related videos, wondering if any of the other Avengers had commented on the event. He clicked on one that showed a very upset Steve Rogers herding Tony Stark out of what looked like a bar. Tony had his back to the camera, but there was no mistaking that it was him. The date on the video showed that it was just one week after Wanda had been arrested.
I was unhappy with the direction this story was going.(this was meant to lead into an Age of Ultron story, but somehow wound up as a Civil War story) So I decided to rewrite part of it, starting with this chapter.
"My replacement. Meet Ultron. He's going to be a better version of me," Tony clicked something that pulled up the sixth screen. This one showed the schematics for what looked like a new Iron Man suit. But not quite. There were certain parts of it that just felt...wrong.
"That's why I'm the only one doing the snooping. You guys just keep on watching my back." Tony's armor whirred as he waved his hand.
"Fine," Iron Man moved the files onto his private server, planning on continuing his work at a later date.
"Your costume. Laundry day?" The man pointed at Peter's hoodie. "Or are you just some weirdo in a half-assed Spider-man costume?"
"Sure, May," Rhodey took a seat next to her. No one could say no to May. Especially when she gave puppy dog eyes. She definitely had her father's eyes.
"Useless. Such a waste of my time. Years of research and nothing to show for it." Bruce made the suit pull back its fist. Peter threw up his arms in a vain effort to defend himself.
"Tony! What's going on?!" Steve screamed. The skylight slid open and Iron Man blasted off without a word. The alarm was silenced as soon as he left. "FRIDAY, what was that all about?"
Something solid nudged Peter awake a bit later. The sun had just started to rise, the sky a grayish pink. Iron Man stood over him.
"SPIDEY!!" Sam screamed, he had reached the pair first thanks to his flight suit and dived down to catch the wall crawler.
"Wanda knows where the compound is. She could attack at any minute. This," Peter pointed at the schematics, "is getting done by morning. You don't have to stay and help the whole time. I can do this," he quickly added.
Tony set the soup on the nightstand and lifted the blankets. Pepper had put an older pair of legs on him. "Dammit. Gotta build a new set. Legs Mark Eleven."
Meanwhile, Tony sat alone in his workshop. He leaned against the wall, a bottle of scotch between his legs. He brought the bottle to his lips and took a long gulp. The glass he had been drinking from shattered about an hour ago after he had thrown in against the wall. Tony muttered to himself while his bots hid in the corner, frightened of their drunken father. He wasn't supposed to be drinking. Not with his skull still mending. Pepper would probably scold him if she could see him now. But he didn't care. He needed this drink like he needed air.
They’d had several run-ins in fifth year, once Rogers became a prefect, but nothing serious until sixth year, when Rogers had caught Tony sneaking into the Gryffindor girls’ dormitories (well, to be fair, the bloody
Steve hadn’t asked Tony to explain himself earlier, and so Tony doesn’t ask him now. He just lies there and lets Steve watch him. After a few long minutes, Steve opens his mouth, and says three words that honestly were
“Um.” Steve hesitates, twirling the cord of a police payphone between his fingers. “In the most technical sense of that word? Yes.”
“Can you maybe send a car?” Steve does manage to say, and hates his own voice for how small it suddenly sounds.
been jumpy and irritable – he suppresses a shudder as his attention slides back to the gentle but unequivocal confinement of his left hand – but he’s not sure why Rogers has been so touchy. Maybe he’s just permanently like this.
Tony resigns himself to worrying all night about what Rogers was going to say, probably while also redesigning the Iron Man armor in his head, one of his go-to insomnia aids.
And lastly, Pepper wants to confirm that they haven’t successfully broken the hand-binding spell yet. Which Tony points out she could have easily determined with a simple phone call.
It had all been…less illuminating than Tony’d hoped. He sighed, tossed the notes and one of the spreadsheets into his virtual trashcan, and dragged himself in the direction of fresh coffee.
,” Tony snorts. He slides gracefully into a jump seat directly across from Steve. There’s not quite enough room between them to prevent their legs from tangling together, and Steve’s every attempt to extricate himself only seems to entwine them further. He’s mortified to feel his face going red.
When he was a child, he’d driven Edwin Jarvis crazy (and his parents crazier) by climbing up onto the kitchen cabinets at 5am to find cereal, or wandering outside in the dark because he was bored. When he and Pepper had dated – briefly and disastrously – she’d had to get used to his tendency to sit bolt upright in bed and dash over to his lab without any explanation, or turn on his bedside lamp to scribble something down in a notebook, completely forgetting that she was sleeping next to him.
Alternate Strange for casting a spell specifically designed to make Steve Rogers walk around shirtless, but did he really have to drag
The spike of pain is unexpected, as is the sudden vision of Bucky, falling, slipping just out of reach.
It didn’t feel as gratifying as it usually does. In fact, it felt a lot like falling out that window, but this time, without the suit to catch him.
appreciate—But I went about it all wrong. I know I did. So now I’m trying again. This Christmas, I got you—” Steve did the sweeping jazz hands motion again, but this time Tony thought he actually
himself was maybe one of the more disorienting sights he’d ever woken up to. Disorienting enough that Tony decided to shut his eyes and try this whole “waking up” thing again. But when he did, the scene was still the same. Snow was still seeping into his back from the cold ground of the Forbidden Forest, moonlight was still bathing the pine trees in silvery shadows, and his own face was still peering down anxiously at him.
“I will never forgive you if you’ve fucked this up,” said Bruce, even as he drew his wand and prepared to cast the spell that, by this point, they both knew by heart.
Tony started to wander down the corridor, chattering incomprehensibly about Gamp’s Law, without seeming to notice that he’d left the contents of his school satchel scattered across the ground. Steve gathered up their things with a flick of his wand and caught up to Tony easily.
“Planted a tracker on your uniform back in the bunker, when it looked like things were going south for us. Who did you think you were
“There’s only one person who could make me leave the Avengers, and it was never Bucky,” he snaps before he can think better of it.
Tony pulls away from the kiss with a gasp. Steve makes a small, discontented noise and goes to chase him, and while Tony would like nothing better than to be caught again, he pushes gently against Steve’s chest with his (left!) hand.
“Okay,” Steve starts, after taking a deep breath for courage. “I don’t know exactly what I said that night on the phone, but—”
“I call you ‘Steve’ sometimes.” Tony frowns. “I definitely have before.” He searches through his memory for an example, and realizes that maybe he actually
“I didn’t know there were still secret passages at Hogwarts! I thought they’d been filled in after the war, and the renovations.”

“Y’know, I was held captive in a cave for months, but all the indignities I suffered at the hands of terrorists still take a
for the guy. ‘Complex system,’ his ass. If only Rogers was ever willing to think the same about him.
It was a puzzle now, and Tony was determined to solve it. Because if there was one thing – okay, six things – Tony was uniquely unsuited for, it was letting a puzzle go once he’d decided to solve it.
“Hm?” Tony asks, distracted by trying to put some distance between his and Steve’s bodies without making it
Tony thought of their television, perennially turned to the Hallmark Channel, and shut his eyes with a sigh.
Thankfully, Happy had set up Tony’s own espresso maker in the kitchen before he’d departed, and so all Tony has to do is measure out the coffee and water and press a few buttons, tasks he can accomplish one-handed. Rogers watches Tony work with a funny look on his face, which Tony resolutely ignores until the aroma of brewed coffee gives him a placebo effect of caffeine.
Strange, if possible, looks even more gleeful about admitting: “Unfortunately, no. Only the caster of the spell can safely remove it before its terms are fulfilled.”
The passage went on for about fifteen minutes, first sloping gradually downwards and then leveling off, until finally the passageway was blocked by a large slab of stone. Tony murmured a spell to shift the stone to the side, and Steve emerged, blinking in the daylight, to find himself looking down at the roofs of Hogsmeade. They were standing at the top of a small hill that Steve recognized as being a few yards from the path connecting Hogwarts to the village. He turned to Tony, who was waiting for Steve to catch up with an extremely self-satisfied expression on his face.
“Tony?” Steve asks, and Tony realizes abruptly that his half-conscious verbal stream of instructions, explanations, and encouragement related to the gauntlet has slowed to a halt.
Steve had spent a week planning this moment, and so it was with some satisfaction that he watched Bruce (bribed with more Cauldron Cakes and a solemn promise
. He had a sneaking suspicion that this was one of those Raised by Gilded Wolves situations, where Tony would say something that seemed entirely obvious to
“What happened, Cap, gambling debts finally caught up with you?” Tony asks, and even through the phone, Steve can tell he’s only barely managing to contain his laughter.
, he orders himself, and forces his hand to stay loose and still in Rogers’ grip. He focuses on the count of his breath, in and out, and nothing else.
Admittedly, Rogers’ apartment isn’t as horrific as Tony had feared. Not that Tony will ever concede that point,
“Like I said, I can’t actually let go. I think our hands might be…um…magically stuck together,” Rogers mumbles, and really, there’s nothing for Tony to do in response to a statement like that, except to topple over onto the floor and wait for death to take him.
, since he’s obviously said “Afghanistan” a million times since he got back, without any problem at all.
“You think you’re the only observant person at Hogwarts?” Tony continued. “And as you’ve so astutely pointed out, I
Tony continued, “The Christmas holiday starts in a few days, and I was thinking about what you said the other night. That you usually spent it with your friend in New York, but Steve…” He trailed off miserably, and Steve finally caught up.
“So bring on the goats, I guess,” he concluded with one final gulp of bourbon. “I think this guy is done, and then once we add him to the rest of the herd, we’ll just need a small charge—”
–“ Steve continued, still pink-cheeked but now looking some combination of pleased and distressed, which Tony decided to consider a step in the right direction.
“So. Do we have any new ideas?” Tony asked, instead of whatever procedural monologue Bruce had prepared. “
. Tony tried to make himself even more unobtrusive, which was no small feat for someone who glowed in the dark.

while Tony made a sound like a dying chinchilla, and both of them sprang at least a foot apart from each other. Natasha sighed, Clint snickered, and Bruce ate another Cauldron Cake with fervent determination.
he mouths silently to himself. His chair swivels again, this time powered purely by the force of his irritation with Steve Rogers. Tony has just
“Something Asgardian. Maybe wasn’t only alcohol,” Steve says. He manages to fold himself into the backseat, but he’s finding it harder than usual to stay upright. So the next time the car turns and Steve lists, he lets himself tilt all the way onto Tony’s shoulder. It’s very solid – and everything else has gone a bit wobbly – so it only seems prudent to stay there and snuggle in. Tony goes very still beneath him, but Steve just makes a disgruntled noise and burrows more aggressively.
someone,” Tony clarifies hastily. “It’s a good place for a quick break. But it’s definitely a lot smaller than I remember it being. Sorry.”
The time they’ve spent stuck together has taken on a stretched, enduring quality in Tony’s mind. Maybe because they’ve been trapped in the same space, alone together, like Steve’s apartment is a little pocket universe away from their real lives, but it definitely feels like Doctor Strange’s appearance in Tony’s lab happened weeks ago, rather than only a handful of days. So much has changed since then.
“Have you?” Steve asks stiffly, fixing his gaze on the closet door behind Tony’s shoulder. It takes Tony a few seconds to figure out why Steve sounds so judgmental all of a sudden.
“No, Mr Banner,” McGonagall said finally, and the entire room seemed to breathe a sigh of relief. “Consider this your Christmas miracle,” she added wryly. “And a warning not to play with magic you don’t yet understand.”
?” Tony can’t help but blurt out. Rogers’ break-up with SHIELD several years ago – like so many of Tony’s own break-ups – had been both very messy and very public. Concrete details had been thin on the ground. Really, the only thing the press had been able to get their hands on, before SHIELD shut everything down again, was footage of several Helicarriers crashing into the Potomac. And that was mostly because there’s only so much even a shadowy quasi-government organization could do to suppress an entire city’s worth of cell phone footage.
makes Tony’s eyes fly open. The look he directs at Steve then is one of such unabashed delight – as though Steve is endlessly fascinating and Tony can’t wait to see what he does next – that Steve can’t help but hunch his shoulders and stare down at his hands in his lap. He has no idea what he’s done to deserve
Rogers turned horribly pale and looked like he was about to interject, so Tony added hurriedly: “It should wear off on its own.”
“Great!” Tony blurted out cheerfully. He shot up from the bench and stuffed three more pieces of toast, a sausage, and the remnants of a jar of marmalade into his satchel. “I’m really, really great!” He gave them both a slightly manic grin and made for the doors to the Great Hall, marmalade squelching the whole way.
“That’s funny, I didn’t take you for someone who’d dismiss a workable solution before he’s even tried it,” Rogers says. Tony narrows his eyes at the studied placidity of his tone.
person into the Tower? Or into Hufflepuff, for that matter? I know you did Disillusionment in Charms last week.” Steve raised his eyebrows at Ellen and her girlfriend, who averted her eyes, looking mortified to be addressed directly.
“According to Earth’s holiday customs, those who live in New York and are successful at their jobs must find The Christmas Spirit. Is that not true?”
“Anyway, what’re you talking about?” Tony continues. His voice is light, but he still isn’t quite meeting Steve’s eyes. “You can
“Exactly, I’m basically the Jackson Pollock of international politics. So don’t worry about it, okay? You’re an Avenger. First, foremost, forever. A SHIELD badge won’t change that.”
Steve gives him a rueful smile – the one that means Steve feels bad that he’s being forced to reject another one of someone’s terrible ideas – and shakes his head.
Rogers presses his lips together to suppress a smile, and Tony glares at him in lieu of any effective way to glare at JARVIS. Which was a design flaw. Tony sees that now.
“If you don’t like it…” Tony said, before taking a sip of his own tea. He nearly spit it out when he realized he’d somehow managed to pour pumpkin juice into it instead of milk. He Vanished the tea with an absent wave of his wand, instantly forgot he’d done so, and tried to drink from the empty cup before frowning down at it in confusion. All while looking anywhere but at Steve’s face.
“Merlin, I’ve split my consciousness again,” Tony mumbled, and struggled his way into a sitting position.
