If anyone is interested, the South African big five includes: the lion, the rhino, the elephant, the leopard and the Cape buffalo.
One side of Dean’s mouth twitched up in a brief, half smile before his mouth fell into a hard line. “What is this, Cas?”
“Lawrence Memorial Hospital,” the woman had said, dark eyes flicking up to meet his own. She had stared at him briefly and then dropped her gaze to the drying crimson specks on his hand.
“Jack, would you go grab the root? I’m a little tired from all that running around in the Empty and I’d like to just rest up a bit before I go walking around in Cas’ grapefruit.” Sam shot him a disbelieving look that quickly melted into an infuriatingly knowing look. Dean glowered but didn’t rise to the bait Sam’s expression was dangling. “
Dean spun the recorder in his hands.
They had group after breakfast, in which they discussed Max’s fear of leaving the structure and safety of the center. Missouri led it, and she gave wonderful advice that was specific to Max and then to the whole group. Dean noticed that everyone there seemed to be nervous about leaving. He wondered if he would get to that stage. He doubted it. If he was being honest, he thought that he didn’t really
“I’m open to it,” Cas smiled softly.
how deeply and frequently they wounded me. I just want to hear them say ‘sorry’ just
Dean sent him a quizzical look, but when Castiel just squeezed his hand, he smiled.
“And that does not make it your responsibility, just so you know. It’s mine. I own my emotions, but you gave me a reason to try to crack the shell open, for a lack of a better explanation.”
Dean’s brow furrowed lightly as he watched Cas stammer. Cas clamped his mouth shut, took a deep breath and tried again. “I made food. Do you want some?”
“Sammy, it’s a very natural, very beautiful act between consenting parties,” Dean moved the hand that had been on Cas’ leg and threw it across Cas’ shoulders. Cas almost jumped out of his own skin as Dean placed a very exaggerated kiss to his cheek. When Dean’s lips left his skin, he turned to look at him and Dean was beaming. Cas responded to the smile with his own, marveling at the fact that this righteous and beautiful green-eyed man was now his. That he got to experience this with him.
Cas has waited five years to have this conversation. He could wait another night.
“Language,” Dean reprimanded.
But they didn’t talk about that which was glaring at them-- about their lives when they were together, what happened that night and what’s happened since. They also stayed clear of the topic of any other exes or current partners.
“Uhmm… dinner?”
Hello there lovely humans!
“How did you get a pen mark all the way up there?”
“Your tattoo,” Cas said plainly.
“Okay, so what happened?” Cas asked, not looking away from the door.
This was originally supposed to be a rather short and silly fic but I seem incapable of leaving angst behind lol. And this chapter is actually the longest chapter I have ever written. Sometimes stories just develop a mind of their own.
“I’m going to miss you, too, Cas. So fucking much.”
Thank you all so much for reading as well as leaving kudos and comments on this! I so appreciate it!
She walked out of the room without looking back. Dean all but crumpled in the seat the second she was out of view, and Cas’ hands were there, cradling his face.
He pulled her towards him again and crushed her closer to him. He started sobbing silently into her hair. She held him tightly for a few seconds before pulling away.
But it was not his pain to take away. Dean had to work through what he had to work through, and had to process what he could, when he could. But Castiel could stand by his side, be something for him to lean on when standing was an effort. Because Castiel understood needing that.
The angel shook his head gently, “where you are is where I want to be.”
Hello Everyone!
“I am amazing,” Dean concedes, but Cas noticed the slight flush of pleasure in Dean’s expression at the praise.
“With you and Cas?” Sam asked gently.
“In here,” Cas responded and seconds later Dean was standing in front of him. He looked chaotic bordering on manic: his eyes were bloodshot, his hair wild, his flannel creased and there were dark stains on his jeans. He looked frenzied and disheveled.
“Uhmm,” Dean had scanned his brain, trying to think past the nonsensical flashes of memories, “picking up Sam from school?” The thought sounded more like a question, and suddenly, the panic surged and amplified.
“Would you be open to doing something else today? With me?” Dean tried for nonchalance but could immediately hear that he failed. He dropped to his knees to lace up his boots so he wouldn’t have to see Cas’ face.
After he had stormed into his room, he had dropped down onto his bed without bothering to change into something more comfortable. Every bone felt heavy, like his very skeleton had been coated over with cement. After the day he had experienced, Dean had assumed that he would fall asleep immediately; he was drained so absolutely that even breathing seemed like an excessive effort. Sleep, however, evaded him.
“You got this, babe,” Dean leaned forward and rested their foreheads together.
Dean nodded, trying to calm his breathing.
“Amara?” Cas asked, trying very hard not to remember the bond that Dean had shared with her.
The title of this chapter comes from the song
It hadn’t even been twenty-four hours. Castiel was being dramatic. He understood that. But he still felt deflated. Like he had failed Dean, somehow. Maybe pushing him away was the wrong thing. Dean had just not seemed like himself; he had seemed almost
“Everything. Weird things. Mundane things,” Cas started, “The first moment I saw you, I was curious. Curiosity, what a beautifully tedious emotion, but I hadn’t felt it in years. Hadn’t experienced anything like it in such a long time. It was so bizarre and seemingly intoxicating, all I wanted was to know about you and your story... My story, the one I shared on Monday, I spoke of feeling like a corpse. The living dead. I didn’t feel anything outside the realm of pain and nothingness. Not really. Sometimes, on good days, I felt like I experienced emotions through a haze, like a barrier of water blurred the feelings, but I didn’t
“It’s not a deflection,” Castiel insisted, “at least not solely. The medication is really working, and I happen to have a very attractive roommate,” Castiel wondered if his face could melt, “So, as I said, good week.”
Dean nodded. The answer was vague, but at least he wasn’t talking about the magical liopleurodons (and how they were going to show him the way) anymore.
Bobby scoffed. “Alright, alright, no need to get sarcastic, asshat. You know I ain’t good with this type of crap.”
“Like all my potential,” Dean said as he tried to pull his lips into one of his cocky smiles in an effort to ease the tension that felt like it was pulsing in the room.
, he begged his mind, but his brain was having a fantastic time breaking Dean into pieces.
He was in no pain, Castiel saw to that. He had just reached the end of the road. The doctors had told them the week before, that time was running out. And Dean had insisted that Cas stop healing him, that he was ready to go. All the things, people and feelings he had wanted to experience differently he had been able to. His life had been good and long. And with the notice, he got to say his final goodbyes at his leisure.
Dean nodded.
“Well, catastrophizing is to view or present a situation as considerably worse than it actually is, often as a result of trauma. And if your survival and the survival of another was dependent on you constantly being prepared for the worst, it makes sense that that would be your “default” setting.”
“But I actually feel okay otherwise,” it sounded like an afterthought.
Also please note that the quote Cas wrote in the front page of the book is from the novel
On Friday morning, he found himself out of bed before the sun had fully risen. Cas was already, predictably, absent. He regretted the dawn awakening almost instantly, but Dean Winchester was nothing if not stubborn. He wandered the halls in search of his raven-haired enigma and his
He just wished his biology saw it the same way.
Nothing.
And then it hit him. Sam had gotten married.
“Don’t rush me,” Cas chastised, pulling Dean’s arms away from his ass and shoved them against the headboard. Dean cursed at the show of power, and found he was unable to move his hands from where they were.
“It’s not up to me, but I don’t think you should see them unless it is because
Dean was there, sitting unnaturally rigidly on his bed, feet planted firmly on the floor, his knuckles white as he gripped Castiel’s letter in both hands.
“So, Cas thinks he is still in there.” Dean concludes. Eileen, Sam and Jack nod.
“What?” Bobby eyed him.
He had been standing outside of Sam’s room, staring through the clear window at the dull, white-washed curtains that were surrounding the bed, for the past five minutes.
Thank you so to everyone who has read, subscribed, left kudos or particularly commented on this fic! I so appreciate you taking the time to read this story! And a particular big thank you to Hellbreaker42 for his amazing betawork!
“You... are not wrong.” Dean admitted with a mischievous grin that disappeared quickly when he realized the world would not stop spinning.
There had been an uncomfortable stretch of silence between the two.
He suddenly felt very tired.
“Yeah, looks like,” Dean agreed, his entire face alight with amusement.
“Was?” Cas caught on to his word choice.
Dean put his arm around Cas’ shoulder as they walked towards Baby. Dean had to smother his smile in Cas’ arm when Sam copied him, his long arm dangling from Eileen’s shoulders.
in the TV room. It was Dean’s choice, obviously, but Castiel enjoyed watching Dean when westerns were playing. He became deeply focused, eyes unwavering, a slight furrow in his brow, and more often than not, he was mouthing the words along with the actors on screen. Castiel was trying very hard not to think about taking Dean on a trip to
by Eden.
Standing in front of him, his face fixed in a mask of horror and disbelief, was none other than Castiel Novak.
There was a pregnant pause before Meg nodded shallowly.
“What do you remember?” Dean asked, gently moving Sam’s hair out of his eyes.
“Usually, people don’t spend twelve weeks in a psych ward and then have their first full day of life,” Castiel countered.
“What kind of things?” Dean asked mischievously, and when Cas looked at him, he wiggled his eyebrows in a comically suggestive way. Cas huffed out what was undoubtedly an exasperated, yet affectionate, sound.
“It’s about time for God to be a woman,” Eileen said simply.
"No," Dean sighed, "Amara explained the place, it's vision and shit, about why she thought being away from home would be good. But I can't justify being away from Sam, from my responsibilities for... it's different if it was... I can't do it for fun things."
Two weeks was absolutely nothing in the long run.
Dean hurried towards him, dropped down beside Cas and had his head in between his hands before he really knew what he was doing. Cas was still coughing, his blue eyes watery.
He was petulant and angry and a champion at holding grudges.
“It wasn’t easy being there with them, you know that. And I don’t know if it was because I was the eldest, but they just kept poking and prodding with their words and their declarations of disappointment, and I couldn’t -- I took the first out I got. I left you there. I left you with them. I was selfish. I should have stayed. I should have looked out for you.”
Dean rolled his eyes and tried to close the door, but Cas jammed his foot in the doorway and threw his weight against the door, forcing it open. “Oh, no you don’t.”
Jack looked like he was about to explode.
“Yeah, I guess… John. Is he okay?”
“You do?” Jack asked softly, and the uncertainty in his voice made Dean feel like a rib was cracking.
He’s never been in any kind of physical relationship, not really. He had one stolen kiss that kickstarted the destruction of his childhood with Alfie, and then, some with Meg when his life was cloaked in dishonesty. Nothing like this. Nothing like what he had with Dean. It was too unfamiliar, too special, too sacred to be used as a distraction.
He placed the serving dish, two plates and two sets of cutlery on the small dining table that was half in the kitchenette and half in the living area. He then shuffled to Dean’s door, his heart beating in his throat.
There was a long silence. Long enough that Dean thought they’d lost connection. He pulled his phone from his ear and checked to ensure that the call hadn’t been disconnected.
Every night we had something called a
“Okay, well, maybe tell her tomorrow, see if it is something they can manage. Maybe they just need to change the dosage or the brand,” Castiel stood up and gently ran a hand through Dean’s hair. Dean leaned into the touch.
that was seeping out of Sam, the emotion even visible over text.
“Okay, so how does this work? Do I just catch a bus or…?”
Dean surged forward and kissed him, holding the face of this wonderful man gently between his own.
It’s something we can build on.”
Being around Cas was difficult, and it was confusing. It was like dipping a scarred arm into vinegar, just to realize that none of the cuts had healed fully, the scabs washing off easily leaving nothing but a searing burn in their wake.
Dean heard Cas’ breath hitch.
“Not everyone runs away from something just because they are young and scared of their feelings. Some people know what they want, and they fight for it,” Dean was glaring heatedly at Cas.
Cas nodded as he gripped Dean’s shirt. Dean hurriedly lifted his hands, and they made quick work of his shirt. Cas’ eyes hungrily followed the line of freckles that spilled from Dean’s throat onto his chest and immediately realized that his memory of Dean had not done him justice.
He needed to get a grip. He needed to calm down. The alternative would result in a spiral, and then he wouldn’t be in the right space to talk to Amara. So Dean did the only thing he could think of that would be able to be the eye in this hurricane.
“Is everything alright?” Jack asked, eyes glancing to Cas, “nothing went wrong after we got you out?”
“You ignored him,” Sam finished for him.
“Meg…” he started, wanting to remind her that what had happened had nothing to do with her. That she had never been anything but amazing. Has always been the family his family had never been. That he loved her more than words could describe.
“Oh, God, no. Dean, don’t look at me like that. It’s not bad,” Cas’ hands were on his face.
He hadn’t.
Hannah nodded, eyeing Castiel over her coffee mug, “Everyone I’ve ever seen admitted usually comes in on a Monday or Tuesday, when all the nurses and admin staff are already here and can observe them as they settle in.”
“In all honesty, man, I have no idea how to start this conversation,” Dean grimaced while pulling at his hair, “and there’s just been so many fucking emotions and feelings and shit over the last couple of weeks and that's just not my game. It’s never been, and I can barely make sense of any of it.”
And, the worst, the absolute worst part of this, was his inability to understand why.
“Does your good week have anything to do with that tall drink of water you were just drooling over?” Gabriel asked, waggling his eyebrows. Castiel cleared his throat but didn’t answer his question.
Castiel ached to go to him. To wrap him in his arms, remind him that he was safe.
“No, don’t. I really don’t feel awful. And you’re probably right. I’ll check with Missouri tomorrow. Tonight, I just want to go to bed early.”
Cas leaned more heavily into the wall, “Then you go door to door.”
“Whatever you said, and I still don’t know because Dean refused to talk about it, didn’t make him angry Cas. It devastated him. I didn’t realize how much at first, I think the mission kept him focused, but as soon as Chuck was dealt with… Dean broke. I have never seen him like that. And I slept in the bed next to his when he came back from literal Hell,” Sam sighed as he rubbed his neck, “It started like the other times. But there was something so concrete this time, something so visibly wrong…”
Dean nodded, his throat doing that thing where it completely
, as the administrative staff that did the checkouts only worked weekdays. They had made an exception by having Charlie do administrative work when he arrived, but that was because, as he now knew, he was deemed an
Cas increased both the force and the frequency of his fists hammering against the door.
“So, you have no regrets then?” Cas asked, uncertainty still slightly evident in his voice.
“There he is,” Dean whispered, a ghost of a smile pulling at his lips as he ran his index finger down the length of Cas’ profile. The angel’s eyes fluttered at the gesture and made a breathy sound. And in turn, the angel very slowly brushed his thumb over Dean’s Adam’s apple. Dean felt his breath hitch in his throat. This felt raw and exposed in a way he could never remember being.
The visit was pleasant. The past hour and a bit had been better than Castiel could have hoped for. He hadn’t seen Gabriel in so long that he had been scared that their interaction would have been fraught with awkwardness, but they had fallen back into an easy pattern. Like, slipping into their old routines and patterns with the ease of sliding into a pair of well-worn slippers – something warm and familiar. They hadn’t spoken about anything serious and had avoided the elephant in the room completely: where they were, the hospital tags around Castiel’s wrist that bulged under the hoodie sleeve he kept low over his hands, the event that had led to this reunion. They spoke about everything, except that which was glaring at them.
“Why?” Dean asked, not fully processing what she had been saying.
It took all his self-control not to collapse at the obvious disdain in Dean’s eyes, the malice in his tone. He settled for leaning against the wall.
They drove off, towards their new home, all three of them tone deaf and singing at the top of their voices.
“No!” Dean panicked, his voice coming out way more emphatically than he intended. But the thought of Cas using his own hard earned, and very limited money, to try and fix a problem Dean created shot a line of all-too-familiar guilt through his body.
Dean startled, “I didn’t swear.”
Much to Dean’s amazement, everyone nodded immediately. Gossip may spread quickly among these people, but they also understood waking nightmares demanding attention. They were curious but they cared, and they would never push unnecessarily. There was something very comforting in being surrounded by people who understood without Dean, or Cas on behalf of Dean, needing to say it.
He desperately needed to get his shit together.
He walked totally cool, calm and collected until he abruptly stopped right before he was about to pass Cas’ door. It was slightly ajar, and Dean had to fight the urge to race back into his room and dive under the blankets. But a quick glance inside showed Cas’ back to him as he sat behind a small desk while fiddling with what must be his laptop. Dean exhaled shakily and moved as quietly as possible past the door and to the kitchenette.
I am publishing this a day early, because I have quite a full day tomorrow and don't know if I will have access to the internet and I didn't want to fall behind on my schedule.
The early morning sunlight started streaming through the window, dappling over Dean’s skin, highlighting his freckles in a way that was endlessly fascinating.
“I’m going to get you a cup of coffee, hot, caffeinated beverages can help. Then I’m going to look for your inhaler for you. Where do you remember seeing it last?”
“I don’t care,” Dean interrupted him with the very obvious lie. He studied the floor as he walked, avoiding Cas’ eyes.
of it. How wonderful it felt to have Dean like this, to taste him and press up against him. The kiss was like a breath of air after being submerged in water, the electric buzzing in his veins after his first sip of coffee. It was beautiful and overwhelming and oh, so intoxicating.
This level of undress, both his forearms and shins exposed, was unusual for Cas. In fact, he looked practically naked. Dean remembered that he usually dressed in layers. He remembered that he always dressed to the nines up to, and including, a trench coat, even for eight a.m. lectures. Dean, himself, usually attended these in the pajamas from the night before. He was efficient like that.
Sam nodded, “Okay I can get on board with this. Guys, this is a fantastic plan.”
Although he would never admit that out loud, of course.
Good Day Hellers!
And then there was something pulling him into a sitting position, his back leaning against something solid. He kept gulping for air, pulling in oxygen but no matter what he did, the air did not seem to reach his lungs.
Dean took a very deep breath, “Yeah okay, Sammy.” Sam looked at him, pain still evident in his eyes.
“What are you doing all the way over there?” Dean asked after a minute of comfortable silence passed between them.
Dean shrugged. “I’m fucking allowed.”
Dean could feel Cas’ eyes on him, but he didn’t look away from Amara.
Castiel lifted his hand to cup Dean’s jaw. “Of course.”
“It’s weird that he is coming in over the weekend though, don’t you think?” Hannah asked.
Dean placed his hand on Jack’s shoulder and looked him directly in the eye.
When Dean finally resurfaced, he realized they were closer to the hospital than he had anticipated.
“So afterwards, we’ll drive together to the restaurant, right?”
“Just… stay. Please,” his voice broke a little on the last word. Cas did not break eye contact as he nodded. Dean mirrored the gesture and then exhaled a little shakily, “I’ll be back.”
He had, after a beat of silence, and she was holding out a box of tissues.
“Huh, God’s watching Moana,” Sam said incredulously. Cas smiled, “He’s right. Hay-Hay is very entertaining.”
he heard Cas leaving his room through the thin walls.
Dean eyed her wearily before nodding.
“Thank you, Dean,” Cas whispered.
“What happened?” Sam questioned.
Cas gave him a questioning look, and when Bobby made eye contact with him in the rearview mirror, he rolled his eyes playfully.
Just a fair warning, this chapter is quite heavy, but all will get resolved. This story has a happy ending. They just have some work on themselves to do first. Please see end notes for trigger warnings.
Dean chocked back a sob as Castiel looked down on him, eyes so very clearly full of complete
“Good. Keep doing that, long, slow breaths, okay?”
“Dean, I don’t really know what to say or what exactly you are meaning to tell me,” Castiel said, and Dean ran his hand over the lower half of his face, exasperated with himself. He could hear that he wasn’t really making sense. But more than that, what he was saying, and what he was doing, were not aligned. He didn’t know what to say that could make this better. Words had never really been his strong suit.
“I am not fucking with you.”
“Hey, so, what were you thinking of doing for your open session today?” Dean asked, as he walked back into the room.
Slowly, and very reluctantly, Dean pulled away from Cas. He slid his hand up from Cas’ back and silently ran his hand up Cas’ neck, reveling in the feel of his pulse, the reminder that he was alive. His hand continued his journey until he had Cas’ face cupped in his palm. Following the instincts he had forced into dormancy so for so many years, he slowly swiped his thumb across Cas’ cheek. The feel of the angel’s skin was electric against the pad of Dean’s calloused thumb. Cas leaned into the touch, gently and hesitantly, eyes never leaving Dean’s. The angel’s eyebrows were slightly furrowed, he was obviously not able to make sense of Dean’s whirlwind of emotions and actions today. Dean exhaled; he was not being fair to Cas. He did not want to cause the angel emotional whiplash, they needed to clear the air. Dean dropped his hand and Cas made a soft sound of protest that cascaded through Dean, warming, and comforting him. Dean smiled reassuringly at Cas as he took a step back and sat down on the foot of the bed. Dean gestured to the couch, and Cas followed his lead, sinking into the cushions.
“Oh my god, my brother, is he …” Dean’s ears had been ringing, and his head had pounded.
The realization didn’t ease any of the tension that now seemed anchored to his muscles. If anything, it made it worse, because what in the ever-loving fuck was he supposed to do with this information?
Castiel didn’t drop Dean’s hand. He noticed with a pleasant pang, Dean wasn’t dropping his, either.
“Dinner?” Castiel asked, and Dean nodded eagerly. As the two left the room, Dean had to actively stop himself from grabbing Castiel’s hand.
“Yeah, I used it to find you,” Dean explained.
Dean tried not to sigh loudly. He was really tired of all this medical faffing.
Instead of sleeping, he lay down and stared at the wall, trying to keep his breathing even so that Stevie would at least think he was. He tried to keep his thoughts away from Sam, from the shaved patch of hair, from the dazed way he had called for him, from the blood that soaked into the vinyl of the back seat in his car, from the moment he had lost it, from John.
He gave another couple of experimental strokes.
“Dean, you’ll get to make the choice. I swear,”
“I can walk,”
“And then you’ll come home?” Dean asked.
“That is an accurate assessment,” Castiel agreed.
“It’s hard to be away from you when I feel like this, like an open wound,” Dean whispered as he moved his legs – sitting unabashedly on top of Castiel now, his legs straddling Castiel’s lap. Dean also changed the placement of his hands, wrapping them in the hair on the back of Castiel’s head. Dean tugged lightly as Castiel latched his hands firmly onto Dean’s thighs, and Dean couldn’t hold back a smile.
Dean’s voice broke, and he brought his second elbow onto the bed. He dug the heels of his palms into his eyes. Cas started rubbing smooth circles on Dean’s back.
“Missouri,” she said softly yet urgently into the receiver. “No, it’s not… Dean…. Yes… Castiel, he said he thinks everything… Mmm… Okay”
“Okay?” she asked gently.
Castiel’s heart stuttered in his chest as his gaze stayed glued to those eyes.
(See the end of the chapter for
This was the scared, desperate man that John Winchester had created.
So being seated in the back of an Uber with a thankfully silent driver felt like the first peace he’s had in ages.
Sam and Eileen looked at each other and then broke into identical smiles.
“So, that means?” Dean asked, and he took a shallow breath.
“That’s a common question for people who spend a long time away from a coherent cognitive state. But yes, in particular, I wanted to find out how far back your memories had hidden themselves.”
as she usually did. Which she won, as she usually did. Dean was trying to explain to everyone else that she cheated and how she was doing it, but no one listened to him. Castiel teasingly soothed Dean who scoffed audibly before crashing down next to him where he was leaning against one of the walls. After that, Rowena chose
Gabriel was already standing up before Castiel finished talking. “As long as we can have Oreos too.”
“I don’t have the fucking luxury, okay!” Dean exploded, his heartbeat deafening. “If I don’t work, my brother won’t have anywhere to sleep, and he won’t get to go to college! If I’m not home when his social worker comes by, my guardianship of him can be taken away. Fuck that, if there is even a gap in my income, they can take him
Castiel closed his eyes, dropping his head onto his knees, “Dean, I’m sorry. I…”
I am posting this week's chapter a day early because I have a lot of work I need to do tomorrow and therefore, wouldn't be able to post it.
Cas closed his eyes and tried to stop the painful flow of memories and hopes from drowning him.
Dean’s entire body went cold and rigid at the thought. He tasted something metallic as he imagined the familiar arc of John’s fists aimed at his brother.
Cas whirled on him, and Dean’s heart stopped.
They had reached the cafeteria, and Castiel opened the door, gesturing for Dean to head in before him. He was happy to see they were the first ones here; he liked the idea of getting some time alone with Dean. The only other person in the room was Charlie who was inhaling her spaghetti while staring at her phone.
Who she was, what she was doing, was already amazing. Who she was, what their friendship entailed, was
There was a beat, a moment, a second of shared air before Castiel closed the distance, and his lips were on Dean’s.
“Dean, do you know what
He had to get out of here. His eyes were already burning.
If asked, Dean wouldn’t be able to tell anyone the plot of the movie Rowena picked out. He just watched Cas the entire night.
“What am I supposed to do?” Dean asked louder, shrugging Sam off and standing up staring at the open sky above him.
“Dean,” she said again, and Dean snapped up to look at her.
“So, Cas, what have you been writing today?” Dean asked cheerily as they walked.
He swallowed heavily before saying: “Hey, Bobby. It’s me.”
“So, before the whole incident with Dean’s brother,” Castiel started as he folded his legs under him on the couch, “Dean was planning on filing a restraining order against his father.” Castiel had told Meg and Gabriel some of what happened with Dean and Sam; not the full detailed story,however, as those details weren’t his to share.
Another minute.
“Can it be dinosaur themed?” Jack asked softly.
Pamela had told him it was okay, in his first session with her, when he had sat in her therapy room, fidgeting with the fresh, red dappled bandages on his wrists.
, when he could feel so much of Dean?
“We’ll be able to have sex again,” Dean said mischievously, and Cas laughed through his tears.
Cas tensed, waiting for Dean’s reaction. They hadn’t had the chance to talk about them yet, about what they wanted, what last night had meant. But to his utter relief, Dean let out a short but very real laugh and shrugged.
Next week, we will be starting to see the story from Dean's perspective.
“You came for me?”
“Is that the original
After he had finally admitted that he needed long term care, that is. Or more accurately, wanted… that he wanted to get better.
“Oh,” Dean yawned, “then I won’t stop you. But you better come back.”
His hands shook a little as he yanked Dean’s zipper down. He kissed up Dean’s neck, frantic, urgent presses of lips to skin. He bit his earlobe, tugging it between his teeth. Dean whined again, and Cas’ cock, still trapped within the confines of his boxer briefs, dripped precome onto the fabric.
“Shut up Dean” Sam said without looking back.
“But I need it.” Dean interrupted him, his voice finally coming back to him, as he watched the anxious movement of Cas’ eyes, the weary set of his jaw.
“Jack had to leave. Heavenly duties,” Sam said with a frown, “Eileen will be down in a sec.”
Robert Singer has already been in contact with Sam’s social worker; they have approved this. Ellen Harvelle and Robert Singer have agreed to pay you, in absentia, for the next two months. Bobby is with Sam. Right now, you’re safe. You’re okay. You don’t have to catastrophize. People care about you and want to help you through this.”
“Of course it worked, it was your idea.” Cas said simply. He was leaning against the wall, watching Dean sprawled out on the bed: eyes closed with a faint but very genuine smile tugging at the corner of his lips.
She spoke of how she got better. How, thanks to her colleague and friend, Donna, she started coming back to the real world. And, even though she occasionally had severe depressive episodes that consisted of days of staring at empty bedroom walls, she was, more or less, herself again.
“Kelly was a brave and kind woman,” Castiel said. Ruffling the back of Jack’s head.
about what they meant to each other…
He wasn’t sure why they were whispering, but something about the quietly creeping dawn seemed to leave the atmosphere enchanting yet somewhat fragile.
“Dean,” came Sam’s voice, low but clearly tinged with warning.
He’d tried dating. After.
. Dean was going through that now, and unlike Sam, his story doesn’t seem to have a clear “happy ending” in sight. Sam got Eileen back. Dean was still without Cas.  Eileen was on her way to him now, driving to the bunker as they sat there, and Dean was left starting at the sky with a faraway look in his eye.
It started with pie and ended with cowboy movies.
Castiel smiled at the look of confusion on Dean’s face. Something about the crack in the arrogant façade spurring Castiel on.
See you next Sunday.
Dean reeled back as if he'd been slapped. A tidal wave of emotions passed over his features, shifting and changing so fast that Cas couldn’t pinpoint what they were. But quickly, his face hardened into an unreadable mask.
Castiel scrolled through his downloaded songs, of which there weren’t many, and eventually decided against it. He typed in a song name in the search engine.
“It’s you and me now baby,” Dean whispered against Cas’ neck.
“About?” Cas asked, looking at Dean directly. There was uncertainty in his eyes.
Cas was so relieved that his ill-conceived words hadn’t triggered another retreat in Dean that he nearly dissolved into laughter. Luckily, he managed to stay in control of himself. Barely.
Hi All!
Castiel felt Dean nod against him.
If by “drew his attention” he really meant "clutched his heart in a vice-like grip and squeezed so hard he almost let out a pained sound", then yeah, it did. At least the pain of the air bubble in his chest suddenly seemed irrelevant.
“I’ve heard that laughing is not usually considered a good thing after intercourse,” Cas said, looking unsure. Dean pulled himself up so that he was at eye level with the angel.
“I just think there’s more to the story, Dean. I always have. I mean, obviously at the time I wasn’t thinking about anyone or anything else, and I – I was in a bad place, and I didn’t think twice. I should have, I know that. I am really sorry –“
And Castiel was unsure of a lot, but he was definitely not unsure about the fact that they would have a long run.
Dean had tried to sleep. He really had. Unsurprisingly, however, it had evaded him, his dreams haunted by long tendrils of black. That is why, when Sam and Eileen walked into the kitchen, arms around each other at the exact specified time the next morning, they were greeted with a very big breakfast spread and Dean pouring coffee into three mugs.
Dean really wanted to be there when Sam started coming to so he grabbed one of his bags and Cas grabbed the other, and they deposited them into the trunk of the car.
He really appreciated this newfound anchor, as things were starting to change quite rapidly at
Dean had been acting weird the whole day, ever since Jody’s story. Castiel had watched him closely, watched as he stared off in the distance during pottery, watched as he sat quietly and ate his food mechanically with a vacant look in his eye. He watched as he scratched at his skin, pulled at his hair, pinched his hands.
He was staring at a picture of Castiel.
Before Castiel was able to respond, there came a soft knock at the door. Castiel hastily untangled their fingers. Dean was startled by the suddenness of the movement, and although he felt a little hurt at the gesture, given what he learned about Castiel’s past today, he understood the instinct. He’s been in this situation before, been with someone whose self-preservation instincts caused them to withdraw. That didn't change the fact that Dean’s hand suddenly felt very empty and very cold.
But, if he did that, Sam would die.
He was breathing hard. His eyes were wild. He kept his gaze on Cas.
falling in love with you. And I didn’t know. I didn’t know. I wasn’t there… He needed me and I…” Dean took a shaky breath, “Cas, I just… I don’t care about what happens to me. I never really have. But I do care what happens to my brother…”
“Well okay, that’s enough therapy for you,
“It’s been a very successful week,” Castiel replied, shrugging.
But it was more than that, too.
Meg must have started a pot when they got home because the coffee was already brewed. He opened the cupboard and grabbed two mugs, filling them as Gabriel rummaged through the cupboard for snacks.
It was a candid shot. He was smiling widely at someone off camera. His head tipped back with blue eyes bright as the cloudless sky that acted as his backdrop. Dean couldn’t stop staring at the face of the man he was once wholeheartedly convinced was the absolute love of his
“I’ve been having a hard time adjusting,” Dean offered weakly as a means of explanation to his current inebriated state. Dean had placed his forehead next to his hand on the wall and closed his eyes, trying to restore his fleeting equilibrium. He wasn’t reliving Castiel’s bewildered and indignant expression at the sight of Dean when he first  arrived at the Gas-N-Sip. Not at all. He was completely over it. As in
They haven’t spoken about their impending separation. The idea of having the conversation made it feel like ants were running rampant over his skin. He couldn’t even think about what it would be like to have to say goodbye, even if it would only be temporary. Going from twenty-four seven contact to two thirty-minute calls and one hour and a half visitation session was going to
“I’ve been trying ever since the whole thing with Chuck, but I can’t seem to get in. I don’t have any sway there, and ever since I took on this “godhood” it’s like my soul and my grace have merged into something greater than both but no longer either… so I can’t even get in on a “visitors pass” like Cas did when he went looking for Ruby.” Jack had a small frown on his forehead and he was fidgeting with his thumbs.
want to. And you shouldn’t see them with the hopes of them admitting how ridiculously they fucked up. Because you know they won’t, and it will only hurt you. You need to focus on you now, Cas. You need to be your biggest priority.”
“What’s up, doc?”
Castiel noted the way she said Stevie’s name seemed different to the way she usually speaks; it seemed, somehow, gentler. He still found it strange that he was able to pick up on things like this now.
“Okay, so its three forty-five now.” Sam says after pulling his phone from his pocket, “lets re-group at 8h30?”
“Nah, I just want to see Sam.”
“Dean you’re having a panic attack,” he heard from far away. He tried to make sense of the words, but they seemed to bounce off him.
In his mind’s eye, he saw Cas on his knees, Cas straddling him, Cas running his fingers through Dean’s hair. He remembered how he chewed on his pens when he was anxious, how he’d helped Sam with his college admission essays, how he always kissed Dean twice before leaving for a lecture.
“Yeah. When I first got here, I was so far gone. I was this broken, bleeding, echo of a person…. Think of it like this. If you’re in an accident and you shatter the bones in your leg, but the same leg also has a huge, deep gash that’s bleeding profusely over everything, you need to address both wounds before your leg can work again, right?”
“Long term?”
He knew he was being stupid, but he wasn’t ready for the instant replay of the worst night of his life that was sure to greet him when he unlocked his front door.
“But this time we can’t call Bobby for help,” Cas shrugged as he half smiled.
“When Cas raised you from hell, he stitched your soul back together and in order to do that he had to infuse it with his grace.” Jack explained.

“Meg...”
“I showered and used some of your aftershave,” Castiel admitted as he walked Dean over to the one of the two beds closest to the far wall. He deposited him, not so gently, on the unforgiving mattress. Dean could feel darkness clouding his vision. A daunting, yet expected, effect Dean was all too familiar with from years of trying to use alcohol to numb his mostly self-inflicted internal wounds. But, he didn’t want to sleep yet. Couldn't. He needed to talk to Castiel. He needed to make this right -as much as he could.
“So, if we took some of Cas’ grace with us into the Empty it would take us to him?” Sam asked, realization dawning on his face. Both Eileen and Jack nodded eagerly.
“Cas?” Dean asked a minute later, when Cas had not yet opened his eyes.
Dean was immediately thrown back to the conversation they had had right before he had almost sealed himself away in a malik box. He could see the desperation in memory Sam’s face reflected in the actual Sam’s face. He could see his brother fighting back tears.
“It looks like you might – “
And as Cas flipped the book, Dean reached into his pocket.
“And I’ve missed you Bal, even if it’s only been a couple of days.”
Thank you so much for reading, and continually commenting and leaving kudos. Any interactions with this story warms me up inside. And it's heading into winter in the southern hemisphere, so the extra warmth is appreciated.
“Dean, are you alright?”
“Dean?” Sam’s voice was tinged with concern.
“You’ve never asked for the vending machine before?” Castiel asked, raising his eyebrow at her.
And the kicker, the thing that made all of this
“John’s violent tendencies started a while after the alcoholism set in,” Dean explained, “so by the time he started shoving and throwing punches, I was already around twelve. But Sammy, he uh, was only about six. A kid, you know? So, I just made sure Sam was somewhere safe whenever John stumbled in.”
Within two weeks, Sam was basically back to himself.
Castiel tilted his head to the side, the angle so familiar to Dean that he felt an ache somewhere deep below his sternum.
Dean would not call what Sam and Eileen had a plan exactly. It was mostly a collection of notes, questions and lore. As he rifled through the folder, he could admit that it at least looked like the beginning of
This response was so unexpected, Cas couldn’t help but let out a soft huff of laughter. Cas had tried to cook for Dean on three separate occasions while they were together. All three of those times had ended with a smoke alarm blaring deafeningly while Dean and Cas clamored to get all the windows open.
Dean let out an explosive breath, “His name is John Winchester. A veteran – used to be in the Marines. He was married to my mother for a couple of years before she died in a house fire. He was a man who lost the love of his life and then lost the will to live. So, he basically orphaned us, because the night we lost our mom we lost our dad to the bottle. And he was a mean drunk. Couple of stints in various rehabs and jail cells...” Dean trailed off and massaged the back of his neck, trying to alleviate the pressure that was fueling the headache.
Dean’s curiosity peaked. “Okay?”
about Cas’ resolve because he didn’t even come out for breakfast. This was unusual; Dean was the kind of person who woke up hungry. His first thoughts upon re-entering consciousness had always been about breakfast.
“So, I’ve been trying to think of ways that we can shift the power. Trying to remember any lore that came up when we were hunting Chuck. Because we know that the world needs that power to exist right? So, who or what do we transfer it to? What is strong enough to hold it and not get corrupted by that level of power. But I could not think of the answer,” Sam said, frustration clear in his voice.
so he hasn’t really been able to deal with the legal side. And I’m not sure when he will have time to deal with that, due to Sam’s recovery. So I, was thinking of just starting the process for him. I’d like to help where I can. And I know you are very well connected. Do you know someone who might be able to talk me through the steps or, at least, help me understand the processes surrounding it?”
He glowered at the pink stain on his hand and waited until the burn abated some before closing the tap.
The title of this chapter is taken from the song
“I saw something in the records. About some experiments the Men of Letters did with demons.”
“No, this is for Castiel. I wanted to check on him too, but now it looks like I am killing two birds with one stone.”
“Hospital?” The panic Castiel felt solidified into dread, settling itself as a heavy weight in his stomach.
“Uh, yeah. Nothing’s wrong, but it’s something serious, so if you don’t want to talk about it now, you can let me know.”
He had been surprised when he’d tasted the salt of his own tears on his lips. He had rubbed the back of his hand down his cheeks. He had clenched his hands and stared at the swirling patterns on the carpet, waiting for the heat to fade from his eyes. He was so tired of crying.
when Cas got like this. And not because he didn’t want to. It was quite the opposite, in fact; he felt the need to scream his feelings as loud as possible. But there was something that stopped him, something that seemed to cut the air carrying the sounds of his confession off right before it left his throat.
This is what Pamela would call progress.
They worked each other rough and fast. It was desperate and frenzied, and Dean kept biting Cas, his teeth digging angrily into the muscle of his shoulder, his chest, his neck.
Dean hated that they didn’t get much time to catch up, to talk about anything else, but there was a lot Dean had to get caught up on with Sam.
“Something happened with Dean…” Castiel started.
Dean smiled, satisfied with that.
“Stevie said I should check on you when she clocked out.”
It felt right. It felt pure.
had kept him just this side of REM sleep. Every time he thought he was just about to slip below the warm tendrils of unconsciousness, a memory he believed to be deeply buried would flash in the forefront of his mind. The first memories that seeped through the walls he had built and into his sleep-deprived mind were tame, sweet-at-the-time recollections that scratched him raw: the way Cas looked in Dean’s shirt and boxers, the way he hummed when he had his first sip of coffee of the day, the way he’d looked at Dean like his world started and ended with him.
Claire, only then, seemed to realize what she had said - how loud she had said it. “Shit, sorry.” She dropped her head into her hands.
“Hey, Castiel! What are you doing up so early?” Hannah called as she walked towards him in the slowly brightening dawn light. Castiel made a non-committal sound, not wanting to let her know that this was a usual occurrence for him. He knew she would suggest they make this morning gathering a usual meeting time for them. Castiel knew she meant well but there was nothing he could think of, at the moment,  that he would hate more than to have the sanctity of his soundless mornings interrupted by another human being. It was nothing personal and was in no way a reflection on her. He just needed time to himself. These moments of reflection helped him to work through the healing process. Pamela had told him it was important that he do what he needs to in order to recharge – regain his strength. So, he did this. He sat in silence and wrote about whatever thoughts he found clouding his mind before he started his day. On the days that the numbness stopped him thinking at all, he just did this in order to ensure he got out of bed.
Dean opened his eyes, sighed dramatically and then clicked the
In suits.
This could not be happening.
“Now?” Dean asked a little too quickly.
“Castiel,” she interrupted gently, “I do not know. Missouri didn’t share. But even if she had, I couldn’t and wouldn't  tell you.” Castiel nodded. He understood, it was not her place to share. Dean could share what he wanted, when he wanted, with who he wanted, whenever he was ready. All Castiel could do was be there for him when that moment came. He turned to look into the glass room. All of the lights were off, but he could see the outline of a Dean-shaped lump in the bed furthest from the door.
She had composed herself somewhat by then.
His room was empty, and he tried very hard not to panic. Logically, he knew that Cas had to be here; that last night had not been a dream.
It’s fine.
“Frisky woman or frisky men?” Dean asked, as Castiel handed him a glass of juice.
“Dean we will get him, we just need to make sure we have a solid plan. One where we can get you both back.”
End notes will likely be a little long for this one, but there are no content warning for this chapter! *Gasps*
Dean was avoiding Castiel. This much was apparent.
“Not much of a plan Sammy,” fell out of his mouth before he could stop himself. Sam looked visibly taken aback by the edge in Dean’s tone. A flash of hurt ghosted over Eileen’s face..
“It’s good to see you all, although it is much sooner than I had anticipated,” Jack said once everyone had taken their seats again.
“New guy must be something special,” Hannah said nonchalantly.
As always, please see trigger warning at the end notes!
“I don’t want to hit you,” Dean shouted. The coiling in Cas’ chest continued, tightening to the point that Cas felt as his flow of oxygen had been cut off.
“Well, since we humans don’t have the luxury of Grace at our disposal, we usually use copious amounts of water and snacks to soak up the unwanted side effects of booze.”
“Hmm,” Dean said noncommittally, locking his jaw. He almost wished she would start already; the anticipation was making a headache pulse in the back of his skull.
“So, you spoke to him about me?” Meg’s tone wasn’t accusatory, just weary.
“Rude.”
Dean couldn’t help but smile. “Neither do I, hence, happy to spend the money, bitch. Plus, I don’t have a wife to keep happy.”
Castiel’s heart was cracking, tearing unevenly as he watched this person who he cared for so deeply, bleed so openly. There was not much he could do except be there for him, hold him in this moment of fear and regret, hold him the way no one had bothered to before.
The two had spent what felt like eons discovering each other. Hands, and lips tracing curiously over exposed skin. They spent ages worshiping each other with sensations and learning the map and the contour of the other’s body. And when Cas had moved inside Dean, Dean knew it was the closest he had ever come to an honest-to-god religious experience. Dean felt alive, he felt present, and it seemed that every press of the angel’s lips to his skin burned away a fragment of the years of pain that seemed to follow him like a shadow. He made noises he didn’t know he could make and drew sounds out of Cas that he thought would kill him. It was everything Dean could have hoped for, more than. And when they finished, it was with Cas staring deep into Dean’s eyes and his hand gripping tight onto Dean’s left shoulder, placed perfectly over the handprint that had connected them for this first time so long ago.
He had to admit, however, that he also awoke feeling more rested than the previous four mornings. He still hadn't slept
“A couple of days ago,” he confirmed. “You think it may be a side effect?”
But could he talk to him about the emotional aspect of things? Yes, that he could do. Sam was great with that crap. Always has been. And so is Eileen. It couldn’t hurt to talk to them.
Gabriel’s hands gripped his mug tightly, his knuckles white from the tension pulsing out of him.
But Dean shook his head and ripped Cas’ shirt up and over his head in one swift movement. “I don’t wanna talk.”
“You knew what I was asking, you knew I wanted to know if he was safe. You intentionally misled me.” Dean hated the way he sounded, how devoid his words were of the anger that was boiling him alive.
“Sammy, not for nothing, but all of your potions taste like ass,” Dean said, barely stopping himself from gagging.
with them. Not like this.
“Doctor,”
“I haven’t really been good to the kid you know? When we first met, recently… I don’t know. You can blame it on the rage, the situation, Chuck or John Winchester’s parenting style… but I haven’t really always done right by him. And I fucked up and I’m scared he won’t forgive me. And I want to do better you know? Be better.” Dean said. He turned his face away from the angel’s and stared at the ceiling.
Dean nodded miserably. “I didn’t think.”
“This is you trying,” Castiel replied, “at least you’re
it… the thought of being stuck in this life is unbearable. It’s insufferable. Everything feels like a fight. And I am tired, I am so fucking down-to-my-very-bones exhausted. But…”
Dean broke the eye contact first. He sighed and flicked his eyes away; they rested on what must have been his laptop. He shut it quickly and a little forcefully. The loud metallic sound of it broke the spell and Cas cleared his throat. “Well this is unfortunate.”
, but whatever) after their heated eye contact and Cas’, admittedly, valid question:
“Awesome,” Dean grinned, and watching Castiel’s expression, was suddenly experiencing one of those moments where was just honestly enjoying himself.
But being that close with Cas, being intimate with him, feeling him, tasting him…
Dean slipped his arm around Cas’ shoulder and pulled them both towards the kitchen.
(See the end of the chapter for
he squashed it. He couldn’t afford to open up that box.
Dean moved his thumbs lightly up Castiel’s face, his fingers grazing and outlining his jaw, ignoring the heat that seemed to blaze straight from the point of contact to his stomach. Castiel inhaled sharply when Dean’s thumbs found his mouth and began dragging across his lower lip.
“Fuck no. Are you kidding me? Go to one of the other apartments. There are like ten in this building.”
Sam turned to face him, his hands coated in soapy bubbles, “Of course man. But we both know who spear headed that mission.”
“Of course, man. Always.”
As promised, here is part two of the duel update today.
An unguarded target.
“What are you doing here?” Dean asked as he returned to his coffee, only taking the cup when he was sure the steam tendrils were gone.
“Good morning, gorgeous,” Cas greeted when Dean straightened up.
(See the end of the chapter for
When Dean thought of his apartment, of the last time he was in there, his blood ran cold. There were ghosts in those walls, ones he couldn’t face without knowing Sam was okay. Seeing the place where he held his bleeding and unconscious brother before he was recovered terrified him so deeply, his bones ached.
Please see content/trigger warnings in the end notes.
Dean had balked. He hadn’t realized there was so much wrong with him. Although, admittedly, he hadn’t moved much during this conversation. He had tried to move himself a bit then and had winced when pain had lanced up his sides.
“At the current trajectory, about one month in Earth time,” Jack said.
And, it wasn’t an attraction. Nor was it a familial connection. But, there was something there, maybe in the way she looked at him, her gaze almost a reflection of his. It seemed to say ´I understand you’.
His question must have been obvious in his eyes because Dean cracked a grin, “You have pen marks all over your hands.”
She smiled in return, taking a sip of her own coffee, “Have you heard anything about him?”
“Yeah, man, and I – I love you.”
I hope you all enjoy this chapter :).
“Dean, it’s fine. Dean, really, it’s …”
“I think I’m in shock at the moment,” Cas said as he eyed his shaking hands wearily. “But yes, I am alright. It has been five years. We are both grown men who have moved on and whose life paths have diverged.” The words came out rehearsed and mechanical, like he has practiced that type of response in the mirror.
“It is?” Castiel had felt like his entire body was an exposed nerve ending.
“No, Cas,” Dean’s eyes widened, “Please don’t apologize. That’s why I stayed in the first place. I was just gonna grab some clean clothes and crash in Adam’s room, you know, because it’s been empty since Max left. And, you know, I was ashamed of what happened. So embarrassed of how I acted. And then I saw your note, and you said you were sorry. And that didn’t make any fucking sense, and I couldn’t just let you walk around thinking you had done something wrong when I was the one…”
“What experiments?” Sam asked her, frowning.
“What was -” Sam started.
“Good,” Castiel breathed and then pulled himself up so that he could meld their lips together once more.
There was a moment of silence, and Dean was reveling in the fact that he was having a coherent conversation with his brother. But then...
And when Sam had invited Cas, Meg and Gabe to his graduation, Dean thought he finally understood what it meant to be truly content and at peace.
“Not much, mostly what Claire overheard the nurses talking about,” Castiel said wearily.
Sam pulled the file from Dean’s hand gently, “We’re not going to get anything done tonight,”
As always, thank you all so much for continually reading, leaving kudos and leaving comments. It never fails to make my day!
“No, and I would have said something to you sooner if he had deteriorated. Right now, he’s almost exactly in the same state as he was when you last saw him.”
“That tells me a lot about him, and from what you’ve described, he sounds like a complicated man…”
Cas laughed lowly.
“It’s a hospital liability thing,”
Dean pulled himself forward and planted a kiss on Castiel’s cheek, “So are we going to brush our teeth and go for round two?”
“I’ll have Charlie bring you one of the center phones then, so you can call Mr. Singer,” she got up, and Dean watched as she straightened out her jacket.
The words landed like physical blows, and Castiel’s chest constricted tight in response. But when he looked back to Dean, he didn’t recognize the man staring back at him.
Jody smiled a little brokenly, “When I had finished signing in, she looked me dead in the eye and told me ‘Jody, you’re not the things you are telling yourself you are. And you deserve to be helped’. Alex and Donna have come to every visitation. And I know now that I want to get better. For them. But also for myself.”
Cas had made good on his promise.
“Gabriel, that is your third chocolate bar in an hour,” Castiel scolded.
Please check the end notes for trigger warnings.
but other times you just shouted about the accident, about how you weren’t supposed to wake up, things like that. So, that is when I was brought in.”
As in an honest-to-god wink, complete with cocky smirk. Castiel’s heart clenched in a way that felt very unfamiliar to him, but he felt a warm blush creep up his neck. The green-eyed stranger laughed and smiled at Castiel again.
“Cas, baby, come on.” Dean panted, wanting Cas to manhandle him a little more.
It was euphoric.
Cas couldn't go. Couldn't leave. Not before he told him, He needed Cas to know…

“No, not then. When the Empty came for me. I had to say things in order to summon it. Things that probably should have been said differently, things he didn’t want to hear,” Cas clarified.
Sam gave him a look, and Dean knew he wouldn’t be able to get away with anything. Sam knew him too well.
“Of course!” Jack smiled. He walked towards Dean, sat down next to him and touched a finger to his temple.
“Oh.”
“Yeah, I’m fucking great. Just wasn’t hungry,” Dean smiled, the action feeling like it was tearing his face in half.
Cas grabbed Dean’s hand under the table, interlacing their fingers and squeezing. The gesture was grounding and familiar.
By the time he finished his dinner, the feeling had not abated. Not in the slightest. Being around Cas did
“You have been, by the way, on an upswing. You’re doing really well Castiel. I’m proud of you and I know that Meg is too,” Charlie murmured as she stood up.
of people, the sounds of life and chatter making a house a home, well, Dean would be lying if he said that it didn’t appeal to him on a fundamental level.
“Demons,” Cas murmured so softly that if Dean hadn’t been staring at his lips, he would have missed it.
After Sam had disinfected the wound and made a splint for Dean’s hand, he sighed heavily. Dean’s eyes darted to him questioningly. “You should probably go to the hospital tomorrow and get that checked out properly.” Dean nodded and agreed gruffly as got up and headed towards the passage, probably heading to his room. Sam, however, knew Dean would not be going the hospital anytime soon.
“Uhm, yeah okay, yeah,” Dean grunted out.
Dean shook his head pointedly, “No. You being endlessly fascinating and ridiculously attractive aside,” Dean couldn’t help beaming as Castiel’s blush creeped up his face, “no
“I’m going to wait for Dean,” Cas said standing up. He had been planning on heading to the library.
He hadn’t managed to sleep much the previous night. This, however, was not an uncommon occurrence. He’d developed quite severe insomnia in the years after college. After Dean. At first, it was the guilt that had gnawed at him, biting into him so savagely that the pain of it made sleeping impossible. Then, it was regret which pulsed like blood behind a bruise and all of the agonizing accompanying thoughts about the colossal mistake he made. How it was rushed. How it was unfair. How he should have just talked to Dean.
Every part of him had felt alive. Every part of him had molded itself to Cas as if by muscle memory. It felt like his body had been aching for Cas’, and the reunion burned away years of numbness and denial.
Dean grinned as he shut the trunk and gestured to the basket. “I wanted a little alone time with you.”
Thanks for Reading
But now, the more Dean thought about it, what Sam was saying made sense. But before the thought could bloom into something dangerous, like
“Sam called,” Jack answered simply.
“Cas, you are so thoughtful. This means more to me than words can ever describe.”
Dean and Cas both had tears streaming down their faces. There was a beat, a second that stretched out infinitely as Dean held his breath.
“You wanna pick the music, Clarence?”
“Oh my god guys,” Sam said indignantly.
“Sit up straight,” Dean ordered as he slowly lowered Cas onto the couch. Cas coughed again but did as he was told.
Cas had said the wrong words two nights ago, and Dean has just been flat out
. He just needed a plan.
“Nothing,” Dean grumbled as he forcefully dropped the pan into the sink, soapy water spilling over the edge and sloshing all over the floor and Dean’s pants. Dean ignored it. So Castiel did too.
Okay, Dean could help. He could do this. He’s been in many emergency situations. He ignored the shaking in his hands and let his training kick in as he slung his arm under Cas’ shoulder and helped him up from the ground.
“I didn’t feel like I had to do anything,” Sam interrupted. “Dean, you always put me first. Your whole life. And I knew– after I saw him hit you, I knew you had protected me not only from experiencing that, but from having to live through
After the plumber left (with the pipe fixed, but the hole in the ceiling remaining) Cas moved his suitcase to the floor and dropped heavily onto the couch. Dean walked over from the front door where he’d just let the guy out, and leaned against the wall opposite from Cas.
What had he been
“Hello, Dean.”
Know what?
Dean said, closing his eyes. Castiel laughed quietly and opened the book.
Cas stopped breathing. Not that he really needed to breathe, but still.
And that’s when it hit him.
He waited for another two hours before Cas heard the garage door closing and heavy footsteps padding down the hall.
“Dean, I was never the one who asked for space. I’ve never not wanted you around or asked you to leave. Ever.” Castiel answered. And Dean wasn’t sure if it was a trick of the crappy motel light, but he swore he saw tears pooling in those blue eyes.  The mere idea of Cas in pain made Dean feel as if his heart was cracking down the middle. Dean closed his eyes as his throat tightened involuntarily, threatening to completely close the narrow path of air to his lungs.
Now that the mood had shifted, Cas got up and grabbed his pajamas. He headed for the bathroom. Dean loved that the dude actually wore pajamas, like a full plaid set, button up shirt and all. While Cas was changing, Dean took the opportunity to switch his jeans for his sweats and drop his shirt in the general vicinity of his dirty clothes pile. By the time Cas entered back into the room, Dean was sprawled out on his bed again.
Cas hummed his agreement and took a sip of the now room-temperature beer.
But Dean barely heard the words, because Cas’ hand on him felt so
The sun had fully risen now and Castiel could hear some commotion from the reception area as the driver got back into the van. This Dean character must be fully signed in.  As the van drove away, Castiel could see a familiar dark-haired woman waving at the receding vehicle before walking back to the main admin building.
), he found his mind wondering back to what Castiel had shared that morning. He hadn’t had enough time to talk to Castiel before his mind snapped. He felt a little embarrassed when he thought of his speedy exit earlier. And then the shame melted into guilt. Castiel had been vulnerable earlier, strong, and Dean had left very suddenly. Logically, he knew that he owed Castiel nothing, but that didn’t change the flare of protectiveness, the burst of affection that flamed in his chest whenever he thought of this strange and brave near-stranger. The fact of the matter was that Dean really
Castiel was not hungry. In fact, hunger often eluded him. He hadn’t truly
“I don’t carry it well,” Dean uttered and was
“Yes, you got wasted,”
Dean blanched.
And then suddenly Eileen was gently removing Jack’s koala grip on Cas, bundling him under her arm protectively, as Sam surged forward and threw his arm around Cas and patted him on the back. When he pulled back, Sam was beaming, and Castiel felt a rush of fondness for the younger Winchester.
Hello Hellers!
Dean stopped the train of thought and closed his eyes.
Charlie, upon seeing Dean, had decided that he should probably see Missouri before getting his schedule. Or before talking to him at all. So, now, he was seated outside her therapy room, on an overstuffed, aggressively yellow couch. Dean had not liked the anxious looks Charlie cast his way. He really didn’t like that she was hovering, furtively glancing at him as she pretended to read the file in front of her. Dean looked away from her and closed his eyes. He tried to calm his rapid breathing. If he was going to get out of here today, he would need to
The chapter title comes from the song "I'm Not Okay" by My Chemical Romance:
It was
“Medical check?”
“Yeah. When I was looking at the structure of Heaven and the premise of “eternal happiness” the current model wasn’t working. I would never be eternally happy if I was separated from those I loved,” Jack looked a little shy as he explained.
“I am chaos incarnate,” Castiel deadpanned, and Dean burst out laughing. The sound was gruff and uncontrolled. It was quickly becoming Castiel’s favorite sound, a melody that beckoned to him.
“Dean,” he said quietly, “You have nothing to be sorry for. I understand where you were coming from. You listened when I spoke. I cannot offer you atonement because there’s nothing to atone for. Seeking comfort through touch makes sense. With us, just with it being so new, I didn’t want any of the developments, any of our firsts, to be one of us trying to escape something, running away from something, especially considering where we are. I want those moments, especially at the start, to happen when we are both fully present. And I know that it may not be conventional or common, but it’s the same reason you didn’t kiss me that night after the issue with my parents. And, more than that, this, you, us it is all very new to me. I’ve never, uhm. I’ve only ever kissed two people, one of which was a woman, so that hardly counts.”
He grabbed his phone and checked the time, quarter-to-nine. That would mean it’s nearly three in the afternoon in Ireland. Dean opened his chat with Sam, and then hesitated. He really needed to talk to someone about what was going on because his brain was now an echo chamber of nothing but confusing thoughts. Would he be able to tell Sam that he jerked Cas off, and that he came harder than he had in years when Cas reciprocated?
“I was thinking when to ask you, and as I watched Sam get ready for today, get so excited about his future, it just clicked for me. You are my future, Cas. You are the best thing that has entered willingly into my life. You are the best choice I ever made. I am so ridiculously head over heels in love with you.”
“Dean, look at me.” Dean did as he was told. And Cas looked at him with the same ferocity and this time it made him feel like something alive was writhing under his skin.
“Hey, Sammy,” Dean greeted him as he lowered his laptop screen.
Hi all!
The darkness was bleeding inwards. In seconds, his vision would be completely gone. He felt Sam grab the wheel from him more than he saw it, felt the car veer off the road into a field. He pulled the car door open and fell out before the Impala had fully come to a rest – needing space, needing air. He hit the ground hard, the momentum propelling him forward and he could feel his shoulder screaming in protest as it popped out of place when he rolled straight into a tree.
Eileen laughed as she walked to dish up breakfast for herself, stopping to kiss the top of Sam’s head briefly before grabbing a plate.
“Why isn’t he waking up?” Dean repeated the question, his hands curled into fists at his side.
So, firstly, thank you so much for being here and for reading another chapter. Especially, thank you to those who left kudos or commented. I appreciate it so much!
“Did you ever tell Cas you love him?” Dean asked, avoiding eye contact with Sam. Sam was silent for a minute before letting out a very long breath.
“You’ve got to be fucking with me,” Her disbelief was palpable through the phone.

“Yeah. She’s too good for Sam,” Dean agreed as he backed out of the driveway.
“Thank you, Hannah,”.
Castiel could not remember the last time he had slept that well. As he started ascending into consciousness, he became acutely aware of something warm and very much alive underneath him. He opened his eyes slowly, and yes, there Dean was, his face seemingly younger and more expressive in sleep.
“You would have left me without saying goodbye?” Castiel’s voice was small, barely a whisper. The sound made Dean’s chest ache in a way that had become painfully familiar over the past couple of Cas-less weeks.
Dean wiped at his eyes with the heel of his hand.
Sam studied him closely before saying, “Thirsty.”
“Not that it’s our decision to make, but I tend to agree with the man-child,” Meg agreed.
Gabriel and Meg both laughed joyously when Lizzo’s
“I confronted them, which I know is stupid, but hindsight is always twenty-twenty. I tried to get them to leave, but they kept saying that they wouldn’t leave without her. They just kept getting angrier and angrier. There were four of them. And suddenly, one of them pulled out a gun. Before I had time to think, a shot went off. But the thing is, Alex… Alex had come into the room. In the commotion, I hadn’t heard her. She jumped in front of me.”
“Hey, so, we’re gonna go,” Meg said as she walked back to Castiel. He found himself struggling to break the weird, heated eye contact but did so reluctantly. He looked at Meg who had followed his line of vision. Her mouth dropped open, and her eyes widened in surprise.
“Yes. He is just worried about being released.”
Cas lifted the bags in his arms as if they were an explanation.
“Okay, fine,” Dean conceded when the silence became unbearable, “Yeah. I don’t like talking about my father.”
“It’s obviously not our ultimate goal here,” her lips had stretched, the edges lifting into an affable smile, “but for right now, it is. Right now, anything that makes you want to stay alive is okay, is
“My friend, Meg, confirmed. As well as my brother,” Cas replied, ignoring the thick feeling in his throat. He hasn’t seen his brother in just over a year and hasn’t spoken to him at all in almost the same length of time. Gabriel had a habit of disappearing to far off lands, failing to keep a cell phone charged or keep track of where wifi hotspots were. Last week, Meg had told Castiel, much to his chagrin, that she had finally tracked Gabriel down.  Apparently, he had found his way to Monte Carlo.
“So why isn’t he waking up?” Dean asked for the third time, feeling increasingly panicky, “Angel’s don’t need sleep.”
Good Evening, Morning or Afternoon Everyone :)!
“I don’t think it was premeditated. I think you were desperate. I think you were scared. I think you felt guilty. And you lashed out in the only way you knew how.”
“Why would Sam trigger my memory if he wasn’t there?” Dean countered, his chest feeling unnaturally tight.
"So that part of the program wasn't explained to you?"
Please see end notes for trigger warnings.

“Shut up.”
Cas had
See you all next Sunday!
It wasn’t a reunion.
“I was a clumsy kid,” Dean replied automatically.
“We want you to come home, Jack.” Dean said. Jack turned his gaze to Dean. Dean swallowed; he knew he would have to be the one to say that. He needed to be the one to say it.
He sighed as he went back to his room to grab some clothes and a clean towel. After, he went to shower and brush his teeth. When he emerged from the steaming bathroom, there was a new plate in the sink and the last of the coffee was missing.
“Yes, why is that?” Cas asked, in the flurry of activity he had forgotten to ask how he had ended up on Dean’s bed.
“What the fuck are you gonna do? You might have an older brother that left you, but that’s not who I am. I need to get to him. Now.”
