“We knew this was risky when we began,” Castiel said. “Go relieve yourself. The risk here is small. I’m an angel, Dean, not a child. I am fully capable of taking care of myself.”
“I have,” Castiel said. “I think our best bet to minimize any collateral damage is to rescue him while he’s being transferred to the Capitol Mall. I have no idea how protected the jail is, but it’s fair to assume they have the entire building warded against angelic powers.”
“Starving,” Dean said, looking hopeful for the first time. “You got any Lucky Charms? They’re my favorite.”
He set about trying to coax as many sounds as possible out of Cas, using his lips, tongue, teeth, nails, and skin. Growling, he bit at the base of Cas’ throat, not hard enough to break skin, but hard enough to leave marks, earning him a strangled groan, then sucked a hickey there. Moving down, he nipped at shoulders, upper chest, then used his nails to slowly draw a shrinking spiral around one pec, getting closer and closer to Cas’ nipple, before flicking it with his finger. Cas gasped and shuddered, and Dean attacked the nub with his tongue and teeth while performing the spiral around the other, causing Cas to mewl and then cry out when Dean flicked both tips repeatedly without mercy.
The rhythmic eye movements quickly faded into another scene. A valley that was part dirt, part scrubland, a mixture of green and brown and tan, littered with the casualties of war, surrounded by hills partially obscured with trees, which in turn hid soldiers planning their next battle. He was drawn to the energy of a young man, barely out of boyhood, who had been fervently praying even as he watched the closest army.
“It’s him! The escaped angel!” yelled another man—a demon, probably—wearing the unfamiliar uniform. The demon wasn’t looking at Cas, though, he was looking behind Dean.
“I think we’re getting a little ahead of ourselves,” Dean said. “How about we see if the bunker exists. That’ll say if this universe had the Men of Letters.”
. “Fine. Well, I won’t be long. In the shower. Where I’m going…” he pointed into the bathroom, “now.”
Dean started to speak, ran a hand over his mouth, shook his head, and walked to the front of the store, where the voices had become angrier. At the contractor’s checkout lane, a tall, stocky man was yelling at two shirtless male companions and the checkout clerk. Dean watched for a moment, chalked it up to an unsatisfied customer or maybe the clerk enforcing a no-shirt-no-service policy, and was about to return to Castiel when the stocky man’s companions turned to pick up several dozen long, heavy wooden boards, and Dean saw their wings.
Dean realized his mistake when he spotted Cas sitting quietly off to the side in the library. Just sitting, eyes open, in the dark, his body framed by his wings. As if that wasn’t creepy at all.
Sam nodded. “Kate. I think you have us confused with someone else. We’re just passing through and stopped to eat.”
“Sam. I think we need to consider the possibility that Rowena’s spell may have temporarily altered Dean’s personality. I don’t know how, but the only humans who have the ability to see an angel’s wings are very young children.”
He picked it up and handed it to Castiel, who took it gently. “Thank you, Dean.” Sadly, he was fairly certain that this drawing only existed within Dean’s mind, and couldn’t be brought into their outside reality.
He kept the kisses cautious at first, but when he felt Cas’ hand cup the side of his head, he tried an experimental lick. Almost immediately, Cas opened and pulled him even closer, crushing their mouths together and teasing Dean’s tongue with his own. Dean felt the tension in his shoulders give way completely as he held Cas close, the knots in his abdomen spark into something exciting and light, and the ache in his chest swell until reality slipped away and all of his senses were filled with Cas.
Before Castiel had even finished knocking, a fully-clothed Dean jerked the door open. “What happened?”
“I’m not asking you to marry me, Dean. Besides, I don’t even know if you’re interested. You could have a hot girlfriend waiting at home for you.”
After moments that could have been either minutes or days, he struggled to his feet, flushed the toilet, and went to the sink, washing his hands and rinsing out his mouth. He left the bathroom and checked the bedrooms in the bunker. The two he was most interested in were empty.
“Great.” He reached for the computer, both to enter his handwritten notes in the spreadsheet and to start answering their questions. “Maybe some information on multiple personalities will help us too.”
“Where are we?” he asked Sam, rubbing at the knot in the side of his neck. He was getting too old to sleep in cars. Or vans.
“Dean may have said that, or let Cas believe that, just to avoid talking about it. But yeah, it’s not the truth.”
Without answering, Castiel went out to the Impala, retrieved the excess brass mesh and the tin snips, and returned. “This might not work,” he warned. “But I’m trying to think like a human.”
The bunker was a good ten hours away, and Sam was not interested in tempting law enforcement by driving above the speed limit. Nearly four hours of the trip would be through the Rockies and he’d be happy just to make it to the other side without passing out. A quick search online revealed that the altitude difference he’d traverse was going to be more than twenty-five hundred feet, a definite tax on his breathing.
One moment, the brass mesh was still sitting precariously on the dashboard. The next, Gabriel had it in his hands, examining it briefly, before settling it around the back of his neck.
Dean woke feeling unusually rested, ready to face the day, and delightfully warm. There was no reason he had to be up early, and likely no one would notice if he stayed and basked in this comfort for a little while longer. He shifted and moved to pull the covers up over his shoulder when his hand skimmed a thick, warm, incredibly soft blanket. It was so silky and warm that he ran his hand across it several times, realizing that there seemed to be narrow, stiff ribs embedded in the softness. He continued stroking it, enjoying the feeling under his fingers and wondering where he’d acquired such a blanket, when he felt the softness fluff under his hand. Sighing, he pressed it closer to him and definitely felt the felt the softness shift, fluffing more, almost as if…
“You tell me that it's a frustration, well you know, don't let it get you down.” Gabe sang, slapping the seat back in front of him with his cuffed hands as if it was a conga drum. “But when you talk about abstention, don't you know that you can count me out. Don't you know I'm gonna come? All night! I’m gonna come! All night! I’m gonna come! All night!”
Dean was still going through his preflight checklist as they walked toward the Impala in the back parking lot, behind the motel. A road-weary family with three young kids bundled in bright-colored parkas were coming the other way, presumably from the SUV towing a trailer of snowmobiles that was parked ten feet from Baby. Although he wasn’t fond of the cold, Dean allowed himself a moment to imagine racing across snowdrifts on one of those machines, the roar of the engine beneath his legs. In his mind’s eye, he could see himself laughing, looking briefly over his shoulder as Cas tried to catch up, the angel’s wings catching the wind and launching his snowmobile into the air every time it crested a drift.
It might have been the heat. Or the water. Or even the bubbles and water jets. An unfamiliar feeling slowly curled and wrapped itself through Dean’s body, like ivy growing on a trellis, tingling and buzzing as if he’d had too much caffeine. A giddiness bubbled up as well, a lightness in his chest that prompted smiles and laughter without fully knowing what he was happy about.
“Do you understand, Dean,” Castiel said as he climbed into the passenger seat, his wings no longer in the physical plane, “that this is an everyday occurrence for my kind? That they have no one to protect them? That they wouldn’t even be in this predicament if it weren’t for me?”
“Well, he wouldn’t look at me twice if he thought I was dating a guy. Any guy. But a non-human guy? Hard no.”
“No, Dean. You don’t. I know exactly how much you’re giving up by making payments on my loans. And don’t think that I’ve forgotten everything you did for me when Dad was gone on business. Besides, you’re my brother. There’s nothing I wouldn’t do for you.”
“He reminded me of some stuff I’d forgotten,” Tween Dean said with a half-smile. “Good stuff.” He glanced over at the Dean still holding Castiel’s hand and sighed. “I remember you. Kind of a crap life right now, huh?”
Sam made his way back to his bedroom, already feeling a kind of loss after leaving Gabriel in the bedroom he’d sort of claimed. Although he’d said he’d probably still rest, if not sleep, Gabe waved away any offers of bedclothes, and said anything he needed, he could manifest as needed. Sam was glad for the guy, his wings and wrists healed, the implant disabled. But he felt like he was now at loose ends himself. Yes, there was still the ACAA to take down. And then Gabriel would leave, because why would he stick around?
Castiel returned to the motel room, only to realize there was nowhere else for him to go. He had no desire to walk around in the Kansas heat, no vehicle, no destination in mind. He wasn’t sure how to access Heaven in this universe, or if it was even worth pursuing. It did occur to him to ask how Heaven was run here, and if there might be some solution to take back to his universe’s Heaven. But that meant having a conversation with this world’s Michael, and he was not at all ready for that yet.
“I told you the truth, Dean. I can’t turn off neural input from them. And the undersides are more sensitive. It’s not that they’re erogenous zones, but rather that when the feelings are pleasurable, I feel that pleasure everywhere.”
The words came quickly through their bond, and despite not knowing Enochian, Dean somehow knew exactly what Cas had said.
Dean was in front of him again, holding his hand, their skin hot where their palms touched. “You with us, Cas?” Dean asked.
Dean stopped short and faced him. “I said I don’t wanna talk about it. You were dead. It sucked. Now you’re back. And we have another world to save. That’s what I’m focused on.”
She swiped it, printed a receipt, and gave him a key. “You’re in room nine, down at the end. It’s quieter down there.” Handing back his card, she smiled. “You have a nice stay, Mr. Gibbons.”
Very well, Sam. Take care of yourself until we get there. Gabriel says hi and he will stay out of your way.
Hester began with the questions she’d emailed to all of the panelists, questions typical for an author panel. How did you get started writing? Why urban fantasy? Where do you get your ideas? What’s your most favorite and least favorite part of writing? What’s next for you—what are you working on now?
“You need new running shoes, Sam,” Gabriel said, returning to sit on the bed and pulling one pillow into his lap. “If you’re going to run, you need quality ones. You had minor stress fractures in your tibias. Gone now, but better shoes will help.”
. Never lets himself be happy. So, I’m kind of glad he’s got that part. Maybe, when he gets put back together again, that part won’t be so buried.
Sam had said he was going to research both the GPS implant and what had led up to the capture of those angels who’d already been executed, though he looked a little green when he left with his laptop.
“I have no desire to repeat that, I assure you.” Castiel considered what might be the opposite of how he felt in the chair.
“I did,” Jack said. “And I was going to tell you something,” he added in an undertone. “After we’d left. He ordered two biscuits.”
Sam rolled his eyes and went to look for Gabriel. Gabe’s door was open and Gabe was sitting quietly on his bed, eyes closed, face slightly upturned, looking, well, almost angelic. It seemed he was going to have to interrupt everyone today. He knocked softly on the door jam.
But Dean was faster, calling, “Cas!” as he dove between her and Cas at the same time she crushed the glass vial in her fist, mixing her blood with the contents, and threw it at Cas. It exploded into a cloud in Dean’s face moments before he hit the ground.
“You’re gonna be fine, Cas. He just wants to meet you. What happened to not caring what other people thought of you?”
“What can I do? I mean, we’ve got pain medicine. I can clean those wounds. Put a couple of stitches in to help them heal faster.”
Dean stuffed a piece of waffle in his mouth and pointed his fork at Castiel. “Surgeon,” he said around his food. “Stop selling yourself short.”
Dean ground his teeth as he sped toward Lebanon, then west on Highway 36, no destination in mind. It was too much to think about. Did what Sam say about wing undersides apply to all angels? Or just Gabriel? And if it was all angels, then what the hell was Cas thinking, letting Dean massage them? He felt played.
“I don’t like any of this,” Dean broke in. “I don’t like that we had to bust your ass out in the first place, and Sam got hurt because we weren’t there. I don’t like that you thought it was more fun or whatever to play hide and seek than to help us stop the apocalypse and Sam paid for that too.”
The absolute front and center seat in the audience was reserved for the room monitor, who kept the panel moderator on track with time and made sure the mics were working for the panel recordings to be sold later. Dean left one open seat next to the monitor and sat down, trying to predict which seat Cas would take. Given Cas’ laissez-faire approach, one of the end seats was most likely. But then again, he had a kind of charisma about him that drew people to him, so maybe the center. Either center or end. Dean sat back and waited.
“Dean,” Cas said softly, squeezing Dean’s hand in his. “This is why we need to talk about when I was gone. It’s not Jack’s fault. It’s as much mine as anyone’s. And I’m back. I’m
“No, not from tonight. I am…healed from that. But my grace is still in a weakened state. Cleaning my vessel—my body—will, I think, require the manual method.”
“That last one’s easy. Someone starts creating chaos and pain? I put an end to it. Peace prevails once again. And I wouldn’t call it indulgence. I don’t go around eating entire candy stores like some angels drink liquor stores.”
marathon on the antiquated TV. He’d seen this episode about two dozen times, but damn, those cowboy boots never got old.
“Sam can be immobile and patient better than you can, yes. But that doesn’t mean you don’t have other strengths, other ways to contribute.”
“Yeah, I could use some food too,” Sam said, already tapping on his phone. “There’s a mall up ahead on the outskirts of Richmond, just across the Indiana border. Could switch plates there as well.”
Cas turned his head to the side, looking out of the corner of his eyes with a smile. “Nicknames now?”
that. Man, Dad is gonna be so pissed…” He ran a hand over his face, stopping when it covered his mouth.
So many of the convention’s attendees were seriously considering getting their work published through Amazon’s CreateSpace or Ingram Spark or some other service geared toward young millennials with discretionary spending money and a do-it-yourself mentality. Dean tried to argue for gate-keeping editors who kept the mediocre writing out of the bookstores and cover designers who knew what they were doing beyond teaching themselves Photoshop via YouTube, but either Charlie or Cas had some
“Yeah. A little. I was kind of attacked back there. They called my publisher a dinosaur. ‘Legacy publishing,’ like it’s obsolete.”
“That will speak to the angel part of him,” Cas explained. “It will override his natural inclination to run, knowing we are here.”
Chuck was a lot shorter in person. Dean had seen photos of him—Chuck was the founder of FAWN and this convention—but somehow he’d expected someone bigger than life. Not a mousy guy with a beard, red hoodie, and faded blue jeans. He turned to Cas when Chuck was first introduced and took the stage and whispered, “Have you met him before?”
“Look, man, you said you just needed my age. You want to leave your business card, I’ll have my dad call you when he gets back, which is gonna be anytime now.”
“This will only work if we’re unanimous,” Suicidal Dean explained to the other Deans in the room. “He’ll know if any of us are faking it, and then he’ll use that against us.”
Sam rolled his eyes but pressed more firmly with his fingers. The baby shampoo seemed to be doing a good job, and while cleaning the pepper gel was causing his eyes to water if he got his face too close to the feathers, it also neutralized any residual contact stinging. He banished any thought of pepper gel getting into those wing wounds.
“Yeah, I think I do. I may not have Sam’s book smarts, but even I’ve heard of the Holocaust. The Spanish Inquisition. Ethnic cleansing.”
Mary got up, and while Castiel couldn’t quite read her emotions, she nodded and gave Dean a hug. “Please don’t shut me out, okay? I’ve missed out on too much. I don’t want to miss any more.”
“That’s not who we are,” Dean said. He paused, sensing that this wasn’t what Michael was asking. “You mean to tell me this whole thing was just to teach us about free will?”
But, of course, pleasure never lasts forever, and Dean could feel the buildup to his own climax begin, even without being touched. He tried to stave it off, but the pleasure kept building, layers upon layers of adoration and love, as if it was lifting him to new heights. He even had the sensation of flying, gliding on some thermal, circling around his eventual target before diving into the center.
Cas raised his eyebrows. “Good things do happen, Dean.” He nodded to the box. “Show me the pendant?”
Hospitals were relatively easy to break out of, but between drugs and surgery, Sam had zero interest in spending the next several days in a hospital bed. He could man up and face Gabriel once more. Couldn’t he?
“Yeah, okay. I’ve got a client coming in at one, but I can give you half an hour now. And Gabe’s with a sitter, so I can actually get some work done.”
“You figured it out, Castiel. Free will, not blind obedience. Wrestling with moral relativism. Most of the other angels couldn’t handle that, but you…you embraced it and ran with it. You’re my angelic success story.”
“Yes. Beyond that. The memories that the flashbacks hold begin with ones that I’ve always remembered. Abraham almost sacrificing Isaac. Sodom and Gomorrah. Cain and Abel. But the parts that I didn’t remember were the…interventions. Finding myself in Naomi’s office. What she saw as my transgressions. I remembered these other things happening, but not my part in it. That was what she erased. Where I failed.”
“I felt disconnected from my vessel. I was worried that I was leaving it, even though I wasn’t trying to.”
“Is this,” he motioned toward Cas, “all necessary? I mean, you were clothed when you showed me the shadows.”
As soon as the laptop beeped that an email had arrived, Dean downloaded the photo and looked at it. “Dramatic. All that brick, those white columns, and that huge-ass steeple. Very fitting. I can see why you like it.”
“I did observe Sam watching him very closely,” Castiel said with a nod. “I thought perhaps he was anticipating trouble.”
“But that’s an impossible choice,” Sam argued. “How are we supposed to choose when there are no good choices? Either Jack kills others, or we kill him. And he’s still family.”
Without an answer to his questions, Sam tucked the book under his arm and looked around for a door, finding one on the adjoining wall. Dean needed to know about this room. And Cas too. The door opened easily, and Sam suddenly blinked against the bright light, holding his free arm up to shield his eyes as he stepped out of the room.
After a toast with cheap wine to “all of the rock stars who add to our collective success,” the suit sat down and Dean inhaled his burger bite.
Dean gestured awkwardly toward the kitchen table. “Um… You want anything to drink? I don’t have a lot.”
Out of his peripheral vision, Castiel could see Dean’s frustrated expression, and he knew he’d made the right decision to have Sam lead this.
Dean was confused. “You want…?” Then the fact that this came on the heels of Cas’ nightmare about the reaper made him catch his breath.
“Now I definitely don’t believe you,” Dean said, feeling every hope of finding a way home die within him. “You’re not getting this world, and I’m not saying yes, so if either one’s what you’re after, you can kiss those plans goodbye.”
Castiel stared at the floor for several long seconds before speaking. “Not only can I not save them all, but I still carry the guilt of killing so many myself. In the end, Gabriel helped us. He tried to take on Lucifer. His information on the rings was invaluable. And…he asked.” Squaring his shoulders, he met Sam’s eyes, then Dean’s. “I have to try.”
“Well, there’s one way to find out. Let’s go back upstairs and then I’ll come down by myself.” Dean started toward the stairs.
“Come on, Dean,” Sam said, apparently on board with the whole let’s-make-Dean-feel-like-an-idiot game, “it’s interesting.”
“Perhaps a part of you prayed also not to be alone? Or lonely? To have people understand and accept you, as you are?”
After appraising his brother for a moment, Dean added, “You sure that’s not just you being overly forgiving?”
?—detailing some of his marketing strategies, and when Dean looked over all three pages, his stomach sank. There was just no way. He’d work harder doing this than he would writing a third book each year. That settled it. He was going to sign the contract amendment.
“I’m already pushing ninety,” Dean retorted. “And you told me ten minutes ago that highway patrol had speed traps set up here.”
“Home would be nice,” Sam said. “But before you go pick up your ring, can I talk to you for a minute?”
you! I wasn’t willing to put you in the Ma’lak box, and I’m not willing to put Jack in there. We’ll figure something else out.”
“Not much. Something about not being able to turn off neural input. That’s why they’re more sensitive.”
And if that didn’t just send a thrill throughout his body… Dean raised his hands to entwine his fingers in Cas’ hair, scooting closer to him, wanting nothing more than to
“One of many slivers taken from the bars,” Crowley confirmed. “The cuffs were originally designed to hold
“You want to fight me?” Naomi taunted. “Then fight me. If I win, you submit completely. If you win, I’ll leave you alone.” She leaned in, pointed the drill at his eye, and whispered, “But you won’t win.”
He let out a short laugh. “My dad asked her once why she didn’t choose flowers that were safe, you know, with little kids in the house. And she said she respected roses ‘cause they could fight back.” Dean swiped his hand over his face. “In retrospect, knowing now that she was a hunter, that makes sense.”
“Round them up,” Gabriel advised. “Get everything you need for a long journey by foot. This city will not be standing by tomorrow noon. Tell no one else. We leave at dawn.”
Castiel weighed the options. “I think I would prefer your room. I would like to lie down, and your mattress is more comfortable than those chairs.”
Castiel’s eyes met his in the mirror. “Yes, I have. I was able to talk with him while you were driving.”
Dean returned to eating, not sure why that exchange left a tingling warmth spreading through his chest and into his shoulders and upper arms, little sparks of light and something else unidentifiable gently vibrating under his skin.
Castiel motioned with his hand and the broken bottle and spilled beer remembered its earlier state and reassembled itself accordingly on the kitchen counter, a bead of condensation dripping down the outside of the bottle.
“No, Castiel. No arguing this time.” Gabriel set the plate down on the over-bed table and rolled it so the tray hovered over Castiel’s lap. “You need to eat all of this.” He sat down on the edge of the bed and held out a fork.
Castiel could tell Sam was forcing the smile. Anxiety washed off him in waves, along with something Castiel couldn’t quite place. The subtle nuances of human emotion were still difficult to sort through, and each person had their own unique spin on them. He could hear Sam’s heart rate increase as he neared, so he thought whatever it was might have to do with him, and he wondered for a moment if it was something he’d caused.
“There is the possibility—maybe even the probability—that Lucifer has found his way into the government and some sort of council on angels. I plan to find a way to remove him, as well as a way to render all the implants powerless. Will you help?”
“I’m not finished. I didn’t think I mattered. For a long time. I didn’t think…” Cas paused, let out a long breath. “Well, it doesn’t matter what I thought. It was wrong. I made mistakes but they’re not
“Excellent. I want you to put a clean sheet or towel on the bed, take all your clothes off, and lie face down.”
Dean tried to kiss Cas again, but wasn’t entirely sure where Cas’ mouth was. He managed a few sloppy kisses on Cas’ cheek and chin, then rested his weight on Cas. A black-belt samurai ought to be able to take that.
“Old enough to take care of my brother,” Dean snapped. “And who are you anyway? You from social services? Our dad’s coming back. He’s on a job and left me in charge. We’re fine.”
“Precisely. For longer term, there are GPS jammers available for sale outside of the United States. They are illegal here,” Castiel added, “though not much of what we’re doing is legal now.”
Jack froze, raised his tear-stained face to Dean, then opened the door and left, not even bothering to close it behind him.
The stranger gave Sam an odd look, then nodded once. “Indeed it could.” He turned and walked down the road toward the farmhouse they’d passed earlier.
“What?” Gabriel made a face that didn’t come close to concealing his lie. “No. That was just water.”
“One went through muscle, might have hit bone. I can feel it scraping against something every time his wing moves. I can’t tell what happened to the other one. My senses are too dulled for that.”
flying,” Dean said. “It was bad enough to have to do it last year. Had to take Dramamine and Benadryl and an anxiety medicine just to keep from freaking out. The publisher-who-shall-not-be-named would pay for the flight, but not a drive, and I couldn’t afford the trip otherwise.”
“You bring me coffee in the morning,” Dean continued. “You know all my favorite foods.” He chuckled. “You never forget the pie. And because you rarely eat or drink or sleep, I don’t think about the things you like. And I should. Maybe it’s not food, but maybe there’s something else. Maybe like this.” He lightly combed his fingers through the feathers along the entire wing, straightening and smoothing them, then watching in fascination as they puffed up under his hands.
At first, Cas seemed to have heard him, sighing and relaxing against Dean’s side. Then his breathing picked up again and he let out little breathy moans. Dean sat up straight, the movie forgotten, and listened for several moments. They didn’t seem to be moans of distress or whimpers of fear. They seemed more like…
“I’m not sure how to answer that. I can say with some degree of certainty, however, that this method works. At least on me, as I am right now.”
“No.” Gabriel held his hands up. “No, I— You know what? It’s late. I’m tired of being poked and prodded at. Dean needs food and sleep. I need a break. Cas needs…” He pointed at Castiel. “You need to stay away from me.” He retreated to the bed without the duffels. “Don’t wake me until tomorrow afternoon.” Gabriel curled up on his side on top of the bed, his back to the rest of the room.
He sought out Cas’ lips again, letting the feelings wash over him without being classified as masculine or feminine. The way he felt around Cas was just…it was freeing. He could be himself. Cas had already seen him at his very worst and still chose him. Something like gratitude and humility and respect and love all rolled together gathered in his chest and threatened to burst out. He broke the kiss and buried his face in Cas’ neck, hugging him close, then tasting Cas’ jaw, his throat.
Gabriel stopped and turned around. “Not hard so much as unfamiliar. What can I say, Sam? Something about you makes me want to be better.”
Dean stripped down to his boxers, then sat down on the other bed, watching Cas. There was still no change, and Dean didn’t know what to do. He knew he’d been unnecessarily harsh with everyone, but he couldn’t bring himself to care much about others’ hurt feelings when Cas was so obviously in pain. It was as if none of them cared about Cas at all, and that thought refueled Dean’s anger.
“First, Dean, don’t ever devalue yourself. Second, I can think of a much better strategy for you. With the way you look, you could sell pretty much anything.”
“I do. My father was career military. Air force. Went MIA when I was young. My oldest brother Michael followed in his footsteps, works in air force intelligence now. We don’t talk much. My other brother Bal was thirteen when Dad went missing and it did a number on him. His life since has been all about sex, drugs, booze, and parties.”
Castiel looked between the two brothers, trying to process what he’d heard. A cup of coffee sat on the library table, warming the palm of his hand. Sam and Dean sat across from him, a united front so to speak. But one discrepancy stood out. “Dean, why is it that when you have an idea that concerns me, we just do it, and when Sam has an idea that concerns me, you want my consent?”
Dean sat in a chair in another replica of his bedroom in the bunker, facing the door with a gun in his hands and an angel blade in his lap. “Where are we?”
Sam didn’t want to stay on this subject any longer. “So what’s going to happen once we get those cuffs off you? You going to disappear again? Go back into hiding?”
“Not like that, Dean.” Alex managed to channel Jody’s mom-voice over the phone. “It gets both hemispheres of the brain processing the trauma, usually using a light bar or the therapist’s hand, moving back and forth. The patient’s eyes follow the movement. That’s the eye movement part.”
The first two home improvement stores were a bust, but they found brass mesh at the third stop, a Home Depot.
First up: how to get the cuffs off Gabriel. Cas actually suggested that, saying that if they could figure out how to disable the cuffs and implant, they could free the other angels, which would potentially give them allies when it came to…whatever they were going to have to do to dismantle the ACAA. Fight the humans? Especially if Lucifer was involved.
Borrowing Dean’s own hunter training, Castiel eased into the lie. “We at social services know that you’re doing an impressive job taking care of your brother. However, our supervisor requires statistics, and wants us to keep track of the ages of our best minor caregivers. So I just need your current age and I’ll be on my way.”
Castiel nodded. “I will want to see the possible routes they’ll take from the jail to the Capitol Mall.”
Dean shrugged at his glass and took another sip. “It’s five o’clock somewhere.” He chanced a look at the other man as the coffee was served. Long, graceful fingers wrapped around the mug, bringing it up to a face framed by an unruly mop of dark brown hair, a hint of stubble over his strong jawline, and laugh lines. Before Dean could think to turn back to his drink, the stranger looked at him with eyes so blue and deep, Dean had momentary vertigo.
“This, Dean,” Cas said, his voice raspier than usual. He blinked his eyes open, the left eye bloodshot.
Gabriel sighed. “I’m not trying to lecture you. I’m trying to help you understand that this is going to take a team effort. More Avengers, less John Wayne.”
“How does this manifesting thing work?” Sam continued, trying to keep the topic fairly light. “If you were to hide your wings again, would they still be covered with all this stuff?”
“No. I have been disobedient. Many times, apparently, though I don’t remember any of them. But to take such a big step as free will?” Cas tipped his head forward, his gaze intensifying. “There was no point in fighting until I found something worth fighting for.”
“They were idiots. That’s what I’m saying. It’s stupid to judge someone on something they have, not who they are.”
“Cas!” Sam was sitting in bed, his hair looking unusually tangled and oily. “You’re up! Dean said you got shot?”
“Sam, give him a chance to get settled, why don’t you?” Dean muttered. He started toward the kitchen. “I’m gonna order some pizza for dinner.”
Taking the crayon gently, Dean sat up, his Adam’s apple jumping with the effort of holding back more sobs.
“Gabe? What did you see? When Jack told you to close your eyes and you recognized Michael. How did you know?”
“It may be somewhat masochistic on my part,” Cas agreed, “but I’d rather know than not know. And if you’re serious about retirement from hunting, about teaching instead, it will put me even more at ease.”
“I know. My grace is… Well, it’s been worse.” Cas suddenly looked up as if in shock. “Sam. I need to see Sam.”
Castiel had been to Hell and back—more than once—seen and experienced torture, killed numerous humans and fellow angels, even allowed Lucifer to use his vessel, but only now did he fully understand the word
“Okay, hold up, kiddo.” Gabriel raised both hands, one holding a fork loaded with pancakes, currently dripping syrup onto his plate. “It’s just an idea. Seems pretty nice here.”
a meatsuit for an archangel. Sam…did his whole thing with the demon blood and Lucifer. You’re an angel with a soul.” Dean snorted. “And all of us have died more than once.”
Castiel kept his wing outstretched and touched Dean’s arm. Dean showed no reaction other than to glare at him. “Where were you just now?”
The bartender returned with his whiskey and the bill and immediately left to take another order. A group of half a dozen people next to Dean moved away, laughing raucously, and Dean downed his shot, the burn waking him up better than the bitter coffee from room service. He motioned the bartender for a second shot and tried to get into the proper headspace for the day’s events.
“Kids,” Dean said. He finished the bacon slice and grabbed another two off the plate. “So you’re thinking this Constance is going after kids because, what, something attacked hers? That doesn’t make a whole lot of sense.”
“No,” Dean cut him off. “You’re not making yourself bait. Besides, what if it is him and he does recognize you? You’re still his true vessel. You think he won’t try something when you’re not expecting it?”
“Hi, uh, Mr. Winchester?” A young woman with long blond hair and a nervous smile could barely look at him as she clutched the first book in his series to her chest. “I’d love to get your autograph.”
. Dean grabbed a notepad and a pen and started to make a list: food, vacuuming, making space in the closet and half the dresser, new toiletries, maybe some new towels that didn’t have holes in them. And call Sam. Sam probably ought to know. About all of it, in case Michael was actually a threat.
“Hi,” Sam said, giving her what he hoped was his most comforting smile. “Sam Winchester. Kelly from COGENT said she’d let you know I was coming?”
Hunter Dean stared off into the distance, his jaw working. “Okay, but your world… It’s not real. You know that, right?”
“Damn it. We need help. Who knows what Michael and Lucifer are up to, what kind of danger Mom’s facing?”
have a deep puncture wound a collapsed lung and some cracked/broken ribs. DO NOT TELL DEAN. r u up to healing?
“I’ve got you, Cas,” he said, voice just above a whisper. “We’re gonna fix this. You don’t have to do this alone. Me and you? We’ve beat Leviathan, Lucifer, Amara. We can take on memories of another angel with a superiority complex. You don’t need to be reset, Cas. You’re…you’re pretty awesome the way you are. I don’t care if other angels think you’re broken. I need you as
Castiel smiled at him, feeling a rush of compassion and love and sadness. This innocent child, who was so generous with his love, was shortly to suffer unimaginable losses and be asked to give up everything to save the world.
Gabriel strode into the room, pulled out the desk chair and straddled it, letting his wings relax behind him. “I’ll have you know that five-foot-eight
Dean rose and stepped closer, taking Cas’ face in his hands, and kissing him without holding anything back this time. Cas seemed to be fully on board too, a little sloppy at first, but quickly adapting his technique until their kisses seemed to take on a life of their own. Tiny electric sparks tingled on Dean’s tongue and he wondered if well-placed fingers might affect that.
Laughing, Husband Dean nodded. “I’ve thought about maybe checking out a gun range. I don’t know why; it just appeals to me. See how well I can hit a target. Maybe work out some stress.”
Dean took another swallow of beer and was silent, his mouth moving as if he was chewing on the insides of his cheeks. “You ever listen to that mix tape?”
“I don’t understand,” Castiel replied, not wishing to be rude. “I don’t know why I’m here.” He looked around, yet there were no other customers. Sunlight streamed in through the front windows and glass door, revealing a wide tree-lined sidewalk adorned with empty bistro tables and chairs. A street edged with parked cars lay beyond the sidewalk, yet there were no people in sight. The clock next to the hanging menu announced that it was noon. Precisely. The second hand didn’t move.
Dean’s tongue made a tentative swipe against his lips, and Castiel parted them slightly, his own tongue moving forward to meet Dean’s. He lost all ability to track their movements then, aware only of Dean’s mouth and tongue moving against his, of Dean being too far away. He reached out and splayed his hand behind Dean’s head, pulling him in closer, shifting his own vessel forward to minimize the amount of space between them. He could feel heat building between them, a fiery tightness that hummed across his skin and produced the most unusual sensations. Barely able to tell where his lips ended and Dean’s began, he chased Dean’s heat, seeking more. He felt Dean’s fingers in his hair, lightly scratching his scalp, then grabbing fistfuls and pulling Castiel’s head back so Dean could mouth against his jaw, his neck, over to his ear.
“That is often the reaction you have on me, Dean,” Cas said. “Though when my wings are in the etheric plane, they cause far less damage.”
“Cas, buddy?” Dean found him still in the bathroom, a comb in one hand and a spray bottle in the other.
“No!” Jack took a step back. “No, I won’t… NO!” Jack’s eyes began glowing yellow and with a sharp crack, a golden fissure in the universe opened right in front of them.
here to help, not to harm. And since convincing you may take a little while, I’ve done what I can to make it a little smoother for you.” He gave them each an acknowledging look. “Until next time.”
Dean ran his fingers through Cas’ hair, knowing he’d been stressed about something before, but having no idea what it was.
The imam at the mosque was a delightful conversationalist, but had no ready answers. “It is not about finding Allah,” he’d said. “It is about submitting to Allah’s will, about living a life in accordance with it. This is all. The teaching that Muhammad—
Dean kicked at the grass. “He doesn’t care about eternity. About what’ll happen to him if Heaven dies.”
“He might never go to sleep,” Dean finished the thought. “He could probably annoy the cosmic entity almost as well as you did. Search every crevice of the Empty for nougat. Wake all the angels in the process.”
“No,” Suicidal Dean argued. “It has to be all of us. If he even suspects that not all of us accept him, that’s going to strengthen his belief that the only way he can avoid pain—his or someone else’s—is to push everyone else away.”
“Practice makes perfect,” Gabriel said, clapping Jack on the shoulder. “We haven’t formally met. I’m Gabriel.”
“Are you kidding me?” Dean said, irritated that Gabe would even consider asking such a question. “I think I know a lot about that. Righteous Man? ‘Play your roles?’ This ringing any bells?”
At first, Castiel felt an immediate sense of panic, that Sam’s hand was moving too fast, that he wasn’t doing it right, that he was moving his head instead of his eyes, that he wasn’t following quickly enough.
“I think what Dean’s trying to say,” Sam jumped in, “is that family has always been in your way. It’s what you’ve been avoiding. If what Michael said is true, then
A few loud wing flaps announced Jack’s return as he stood in front of the motel window. For just a moment, Dean swore he could see giant wings folding themselves behind Jack before they disappeared from view.
“He’s not dead,” Tween Dean assured him. “Grew up really tall and he’s got a mouth like Mom did. When he told me to go to bed, I actually felt like I had to do it. Do you remember hunting at all?”
“Yeah.” Rubbing the back of his neck, Dean took a deep breath. “I’ll think about it. I gotta go. Thanks, Sammy. You’re the best.”
He felt Cas pull away just a bit, then grasp both their cocks in one hand. One very slick, slightly cool hand. The extra lube intensified every sensation, and as Dean lost himself to them, he felt a cool, wet finger trace down his crack and rub small circles at his hole. He tensed for a moment. He’d done this for a few women he’d been with, and they seemed to like it, but he never once expected to be on the receiving end. The waves of
Dean swore under his breath. “I will be consulting my attorney on this. I don’t remember signing over the series, and the Beast Hunters name was mine. That was part of my pitch. Even Crowley knows that.”
“Well, that’s always your call, Dean. But I know this is something you want. If you want to fight this, I’ll take it on as a case in return for childcare.”
They found Sam in the library, having just placed three steaming mugs of hot cocoa out on one of the tables. His laptop occupied a fourth spot, the lid mostly closed.
“Angels are asexual,” Castiel said. There was a spike of something like disappointment coming from Dean, and Castiel took some confidence from it. “But when we take vessels, we can be…influenced by human desires. This is one reason why we’re not encouraged to spend much time in a vessel. It can be very distracting from our mission, and has, on occasion, resulted in the birth of nephilim.”
“Dad was a product of his generation, his time in the military, and a lot of ignorance and fear,” Lover Dean replied. “He defined masculinity a certain way, but that doesn’t make him right. Or me wrong.”
Cas tilted his head while looking like he was trying hard to understand. “You’re talking about a sort of communal messaging center?”
“Okay.” Sam scooted his chair so they sat facing each other, about four feet apart. “Is this too close? Too far away?”
As he sat in a chair in the library, with Sam across from him and Dean getting comfortable next to him again, he tried to clear his mind for this session.
“Cas, you okay?” Dean said, rushing to his side. He looked Cas over, not seeing any evidence that the shots hit him.
“Whoa, buddy.” Dean held what felt like dead weight, memories coming unbidden of carrying Cas’ body from the lakeside into the house, dressing him for the funeral pyre. “Not on my watch,” he growled, hefting Cas up and dragging him to the bed. He laid Cas out, checking every few moments for breaths that Cas shouldn’t need to breathe but did anyway, watching Cas’ eyes move behind his eyelids, reminding himself that as far as he knew, no one had ever died from a flashback.
“She let them in, Dean. She saw life and she let it in. She knew what it meant to be a hunter, what it meant to kill. And she chose to bring signs and symbols of life and beauty into her home, into her family. Life is everywhere around you. You only need to let it in. Let it color your life. Let it remind you that there is more than pain and death. There is also endurance and beauty and strength.”
“We’ve prevailed against worse,” Castiel replied, though his voice didn’t have the confidence Dean wanted to hear.
Dean let out a long breath. “Okay.” After a long pause, he said, “My mom used to say angels were watching over me, but then she died and nothing stopped it from happening and my dad says there’s no such thing as angels. Just monsters.”
Gabriel paused for a moment and shrugged. “Okay, you got me there.” He climbed out of the car and sauntered over to door.
The sense of disconnection was strong at first, but Castiel relaxed into it after only a few seconds. The ink spot seemed reassuring somehow. For no known reason, Castiel was suddenly aware of his wings, and the visceral memory of flight, of banking and turning, riding thermals of energy, moving in and out of space and time. At the same time, he could feel his wings as they were now: ragged, broken, useless. They ached, and the pain radiated into his vessel, up into his shoulders and down his arms, down his back and into his hips. The pain became stronger, making him want to curl into himself and cry out. It burned and throbbed and sent sharp flashes of agony through him. And just when he thought he couldn’t take anymore, Sam lowered his hand.
The unusual gravity of Gabriel’s tone caused chills to erupt all over Castiel’s skin. “How is this going to help?”
“Don’t worry, Dean,” Castiel said. “You let us take care of making sure they see whatever you want to draw. And we’ll hang up this picture you drew first.”
“Perhaps.” Castiel indicated the item in front of him, not quite sure what to call it. “I enjoy the texture.”
“If you want to get technical about it, I’m on the asexual spectrum. Demisexual, to be specific. I’m not attracted to anyone unless I have a strong emotional bond with them.”
“It’s the only thing I can think of. As far as an afterlife, it’s the primary difference between angels and humans.”
“Really? You think he’d go there? I don’t. Maybe rock music is covertly expressing emotions for those allergic to feelings.”
He gave up trying to sleep any longer and stumbled toward the kitchen in search of coffee, and preferably a lot of it. The power seemed to be back on for now, and once he was awake enough to start problem-solving, the bunker’s electrical system was first on his list.
“I understand, Dean. And if he was? What would you think about that?” Castiel hesitated to even ask the question, but it might help establish where Dean stood on the issue.
The ink spot and bunker dissolved into complete darkness, and Castiel was anxious until he recognized the feel of the place. The Empty.
He pulled Dean’s bare thighs toward him and kissed the tender skin of his inner thighs and where his thighs met his hips. He kissed and licked the area around Dean’s erection until Dean was trembling with the effort of holding still, then took all of Dean into his mouth in one movement. Dean swayed for a moment, then grabbed onto Castiel’s hair for balance, tightening his hold when Castiel began to use his tongue, trying to emulate what he remembered Dean doing to him.
“What do you mean?” Dean’s confusion was clearly sincere, and somehow that gave Castiel a warm feeling.
Dean shoved himself away from the door, reached under his pillow, and within seconds, had a gun trained on Castiel. “I’m a
“And Jack?” Castiel asked. “How can this help Jack? Chuck said there’d be something in this that would help me help Jack.”
The new authors’ breakfast was ungodly early, but it was a networking must-do, according to Bela. Thirty some-odd tables each had one or two new authors whose first books had just come out in the past year, and con attendees could pick the table they wanted to sit at to hear about that author’s debut novel. The authors often brought swag—bookmarks or pens or something fun—to give away. Years ago, when Dean was publicizing
“Look… you’re around someone long enough, you’re gonna let ’em down. Can’t tell you how many times I’ve let Sammy down. He’s let me down. It happens, okay? Just don’t do it all the time. And talk to me. Half the idiotic stuff you’ve done was you thinking you were doing the right thing and if you’d just told me, we coulda worked it out with better consequences.”
“And I have you to thank for that. I’ll never forget the debt I owe you. In fact…” Gabriel motioned Castiel closer.
“Hmm.” Dean watched the traffic inch forward, making out the flashing lights of several patrol cars ahead. “What’s that like? Worshipping, I mean. Like singing about God’s glory and all?”
“Better,” Sam said. “Are we still working with the image of Naomi’s drill and the belief you want that you’re worthy?”
With a deep sigh, Castiel let go of the thread that held him within Dean’s mind, falling back into his vessel. He woke again, this time laying where he expected on Dean’s bed. He immediately turned to where Dean slept—or had been sleeping. “Hello, Dean.”
Dean started to argue. The very fact that Gabriel was in jail, mostly helpless—the whole reason they were on this trip in the first place—was due to forces beyond their control, forces that could overpower Cas if they didn’t stay vigilant.
Michael tipped his chin up a few degrees. “You are here by choice. In every moment, you have choice. Through choice, you have power. There is no power greater than choice.
Cas’ shoulders sagged. “I wanted to share something that came up, but…” He sighed and his shoulders sagged even further.
“Shh…” Gabriel took a deep breath and let it out slowly, then smiled. His wings shifted a bit, and Sam watched as the wounds began to heal until there was no trace of the ragged holes. The feathers remained broken, but were clean and dry and still looked like actual gold woven throughout them.
Whatever else Dean said was suddenly drowned out by a shifting air pressure in his ears. Dean’s words, which had now become something sounding concerned, were muted underneath the hollow rushing of the air pressure change.
Cas is a post-rules version of himself. He's become comfortable with choice and free will, and is maybe a little anti-rules. Dean is still in the “this is the way it’s done” (as canon Dean used to be with hunting), but starts to see the gray—not everything is black and white. He's also just starting to realize he’s in what we in the biz call publishing hell: no autonomy, no creative control, and you do what your publisher wants or else.
After Gabriel’s quasi-pep-talk, it seemed to Dean like they should have done some sort of team cheer and run out onto the field to vanquish their enemy. It was a bit anticlimactic to nod, shrug, and dig into the research.
Dean was in bed, looking like he was asleep. In fact, it looked like he hadn’t moved much at all since Tween Dean was sent to bed. And Cas was… Sam opened the door farther. Cas was on the couch, reading a thick book with an old leather cover. “Hey, Cas.”
“Yeah, you’re one to talk, Mr. I’m-pushing-forty.” Sam stood and stretched, raising his arms high above his head, fingers nearly touching the ceiling. “I’m gonna go check out the outdoor hot tub. We’ve never stayed anywhere with a hot tub before. You should come.”
. The only people I care about saving are human. I don’t know what you were trying here, but you stay away from me. Understand?”
Sam held a digital voice recorder in one hand, his EMF meter with its backlit screen in the other. He’d spent the past two hours roaming the small house in the dark, focusing mostly on the bedrooms, and unless the voice recorder caught something, he’d come up empty. He was about to speak again when a noticeable chill moved past his right arm, causing the EMF meter to spike.
“We work as a team,” Castiel insisted, an odd feeling of confidence filling his chest. “Equals. Each of us. No one is a tool. No one is valued only for what they can do. The four of us—we bring a lot of experience, both good and bad—to the table. We talk about it. Honestly. No lies or omissions of truth.” He glanced at Dean, who had what appeared to be a look of awe on his face. “We discuss it like adults. We leave our egos out of it.”
“Yeah, I—” Dean scrubbed his face with his hands and willed his brain to work. “I had to go for a drive, just to clear my head, you know? And I happened to catch a news report that the president is signing an order that all angels have to have their grace drained. ‘Cause of Gabe’s escape.”
, but broke off the thought when he spied the solution at the end of an aisle. He pulled a black scarf off the top of the stack, happy to discover that it felt very similar to the other fleece. “I can tie this around my waist,” he said.
“Night, Cas.” Dean ended the connection reluctantly. Working on a story hadn’t been this exhilarating since the first couple of books he’d written, before he even had a publishing contract. When had he lost that excitement of a new adventure? And what if… What if he and Cas rented a house in Waterville, writing the book while overlooking the story’s setting? Lazy mornings making out, breakfast on the outside balcony or patio that the house would unquestionably have, then a full day of writing, punctuated by kissing and laughter. He wondered if Waterville actually had any water. A lake, maybe? A fishing dock. Fresh fish for dinner. Evenings spent watching movies, wrapped up in each other, having mind-blowing sex.
“Dean, you know I want what makes you happy. Think about it, okay? I talked to Bobby last night; he’s more than happy to have you come work with him.”
“Oh, dear Castiel, that’s where you’re wrong. Neither one of us particularly liked being obedient. We both found ways to write our own stories. We’re free thinkers, Castiel, authors of our own destiny! What other angels could say that? Not Lucifer, blinded by rage and pain. Not Michael, blinded by a twisted sense of duty. Even Gabriel was too busy avoiding conflict to plan his own denouement.”
“Look, maybe you haven’t noticed, but Dean’s been in love with you since…I don’t know. Years. A long time. It’s
Cas sat leaned back in his chair in the war room, one hand gripping the arm so tightly that his knuckles were white, the other waving around wildly, nearly knocking Sam across the room.
“Whoops!” Gabriel said, catching Dean and Jack off-balance as he shoved them into the rift, following close behind. “Later, bro. Hopefully never.”
Half of Dean wanted to shove Cas away, let him have his sex dream anywhere but next to him. The other half couldn’t stop listening, his own breathing picking up in time with Cas’, and,
“Oh, just a song from a TV show I found on Netflix. The symbol on the hero’s suit intrigued me at first. Then I learned he could fly. It wasn’t really all that memorable except for the song at the beginning.”
Dean raised his eyebrows. “Intimate? I know that they know they're, like, the only real part of an angel, not just their vessel.”
“I…uh…was able to obtain the calendar for the Secretary of Angel Affairs. If I can get to D.C. quickly, I could sit in as part of the press pool where he is. If it’s really Lucifer…”
There was no answer, but he didn’t have time to figure out what was going on with Sam. He’d seen the SUV in the garage, so he knew Sam was in the bunker somewhere. Right now, Cas came first.
“Relax, Dean. Breathe in gently through your nose.” Cas’ voice seemed to be getting closer and softer. “Now tell me what you smell.”
“And I’ll continue to take notes,” Sam agreed. “I’ve got ages, some personality descriptions, what their ‘rooms’ are.” Sam closed the notebook and stood, his excitement growing. “This is a great idea. I’ll get some things out of the Impala. Maybe you can look in his room?”
The biggest problem was that the ground was frozen. Sam dug out the pickaxe and pry bar, along with a butane torch, just in case. He’d prefer not to use the torch to thaw the ground. He still hadn’t gotten over his nightmares from the last time he was around one. He hefted the pickaxe first and eyed the ground. The biggest problem was about to become the most recent accomplishment.
He stayed clear of small towns, taking barely-paved roads to avoid Northfield on one side and Cannon Falls on the other. After bypassing Kenyon, he continued south, looking for a good spot to pull over. South of Claremont, he found it. It was no more than a run-down shack, really, just off the gravel road, a copse of trees beside it and further surrounded by empty snow-covered farmland.
Gabriel’s tone was soft. “You know if I could heal your wings completely, I would. Without hesitation. But let me do what I can.”
“No, he isn’t. He’s just really worried about Cas. And he took it out on you. That’s not right at all.” Sam watched Jack’s face for some sign that he was getting through, but the kid was as stubborn as Dean. Already, Sam thought of him as family, and the Winchester traits were all there.
“Not ganking any ghosts today,” Dean said. He checked out the parking lot. Tucked into the far corner was a newer SUV covered in tree droppings, and not far from that, a dark minivan with a busted rear window, secured with plastic sheeting and duct tape. “Bingo.”
“Cas is right,” Dean said, grateful for the change of subject. He snatched another donut and fished out the map, laying it out on the bed while he held the donut in his teeth. After taking a bite, he held it with one hand while smoothing out the paper with the other. “Let’s figure out how to get home.”
“You need to replace those thoughts with what your readers have said.” Cas took a drink and motioned with the glass in his hand. “Except when those readers are sending you hate mail. I turned off all my social media notifications. Half the trolls want to have sex with me; the other half want me dead.”
“Mostly likely not,” Cas spoke up. “But they may be afraid, and fear can cause people to act without thinking things through. You’ll have to be the level-headed one.”
He was about to change the channel again when the TV Lucifer asked, “What is it you most desire?” The real Lucifer
With a single nod, Dean left the restaurant, trying to clear his head on the way back to the hotel. Being published by a large New York house was all he’d known, and if he turned down the contract amendment, he could easily earn a reputation in the industry for demanding unfairly high royalties, which would make it harder to get signed with a new publisher. But if he signed, wasn’t he silently telling them they could walk all over him?
“Very well. Since you’re in town here, I recommend going to the Smith Center Chamber of Commerce. They can fill you in on anything current. They can also give you directions to the historical society. And finally, you may want to visit your colleagues at the
“I believe it.” Dean shook his head. “We can’t fight Jack with Cas going through this. We can’t even
“What’s your name?” he asked gruffly. He could see his breath in front of him and for a moment felt icy fingers on his jaw. Then it all suddenly disappeared. “Oh come on!” Sam called out. “Are you afraid of me?”
“Maybe we can take a little poetic license with that. So Tristan and Ross go to investigate these healings and survivors because this isn’t normal, and they’re concerned maybe something bad is saving people to extort them later. No good deed goes unpunished, and all that.”
Cas held one finger up, the other pressing his phone to his ear. “Crowley,” he said when the line connected. “It’s time to collect one of those favors.” Without waiting for a response, Cas disconnected the call and slid the phone into his pocket.
Granted, Cas has to pay for editing, cover design, interior layout, possibly font licensing, ARCs, postage, other marketing, etc. (which Dean’s publisher pays for), but Cas would only need to sell 15,000 copies of his books per year to make $70K, whereas Dean has to sell 20,588 copies of his books just to make $35K per year. If Cas sold closer to 20,000 copies, he could easily afford book production costs
Through the soundstage door, Metatron walked in, holding an empty vial and an angel blade, followed by Naomi with her drill.
Sighing, Dean ran a hand through his hair. “See, I’m no good with words. And I keep tryin’ to show you, but it’s not coming across.”
Dean pulled the chair out from the small table and turned it to face the bed, where Castiel had seated himself. “I, um…” He looked down at the floor and rubbed the back of his neck. “I just want you to know…on the whole law thing…”
Cas nodded once. “As you wish.” He placed his hand on Dumah’s forehead, while simultaneously drawing his angel blade and pointing it at the angel guard. Light glowed from under his hand, and Dumah gasped, then struggled but seemed frozen under Cas’ touch. She screamed, a pain-filled shriek, and then Cas removed his hand and ran his angel blade through her abdomen.
“Good.” Cas appraised him. “You want to talk about it? I’m fairly certain it had something to do with me, or with what we just did.”
Where he found himself, however, was in a space devoid of any shape, texture, or color, save the whirling gray that surrounded him.
“Jack, we know you’re not evil,” Sam said. “Some of your actions didn’t turn out the way you wanted, but you didn’t choose evil. You kept choosing to help. Or protect. I really want you to see that. And, uh… I was wrong before. What I said about Heaven disapproving of my exorcising demons?”
“All right,” Pamela said. “Thank you all. I have a few questions I want to make sure get asked, and then I’m going to open it up to the audience for questions, because I’m sure you all have a lot. So, Kevin let’s go back to you for a moment. Tell me what an acquisitions editor does, exactly.”
A corner of Cas’ mouth twitched up in a smile. “Making sure they stop. You might want to pull ahead about two and a half feet.”
The image still had him cringing. But instead of all fear, he felt anger now too. A hint of righteous fury. Naomi should not have done what she did. He wasn’t sure why, but he knew that much. “Six.”
“Yeah?” Dean felt the tension in his own body as he climbed into the other side of the bed and slid under the covers. He could feel the heat from Cas’ body, the angel’s steady presence, calming and easing him simply by its proximity. Perhaps that was the effect he had on Cas, too, because Cas sighed contentedly as Dean lay down next to him.
Cas leaned forward until his lips nearly touched Dean’s ear. “I’m not afraid, Dean. But a little fear in you is
“It ain’t about enjoyment. I just… If you leave again, willingly or not, I don’t think I’m gonna survive it.”
Dean sought Cas’ lips again, not ready to move quite yet. He pushed his hips up into Cas, rolling them a little, the heat and bubbles nearly overwhelming him as they surrounded him. “Okay,” he said, darting in for one more kiss.
There was still Dean’s current novel-in-progress to finish for Bela, and based on the contract changes, another one due before the end of the calendar year. How he was going to write one and a half novels in six months and co-write a third was beyond him, but with Cas cheering him on, he felt like he could take on anything the universe decided to throw at him.
Now fear chose to creep in. “Um…how’s this gonna change…” He motioned to the scant few inches between their faces. “You know…us?”
“Oh.” Dean focused back on the muscle tension, mapping out places that appeared to be where Cas held his stress in his wings. “If I
Swiping his tongue across the seam of Cas’ lips, Dean ventured further, stubble scraping against his face in a way that made all his nerves dance with joy. The taste of Cas wasn’t really anything he could identify, other than it being the best flavor he’d ever tasted, still with that bit of electricity. He didn’t want it to end, ever, but eventually, the need for oxygen took precedence, and he pulled away, breathing heavily.
Finding more knots at the same lower joint, he pressed and rubbed until they released. “If your wings are the only part that’s really you, not just your vessel, then how come I can see them and touch them without getting my eyes burned out? Isn’t that what your true form would do?”
“Wow.” Gabriel chuckled. “And I thought Dean was all about the chick-flick moments.” He caught Sam’s gaze and looked like he was searching for something. “You really want me to stay?”
Dean pulled his boots off and climbed onto the bed, sitting up against the headboard but partially facing Castiel. “Me and Sam, we’re always gonna be family. I’d do almost anything for him. Have done some pretty stupid stuff for him.”
Revisiting the image made Castiel cringe, wanting desperately to defend himself, fight her off. It took more willpower than he cared to admit to keep reminding himself that he was safe here in the bunker. Dean was still beside him. He didn’t have to fight. It was only a memory. “Eight.”
“Hey, it’s okay,” Dean said, signing the title page. “Beautiful woman like you, who wouldn’t want to shake your hand? What’s your name, sweetheart?”
“I know, Cas.” Dean put his hand on Castiel’s shoulder, feeling the tension fade under his touch. “Let’s finish up here and head back to the room. See if Gabe has any more info on when they’re going to transfer him.”
“Oh. Well, when Cas was more human than angel, he had to, you know, shower. And he kept getting shampoo in his eyes, so I bought a bunch of baby shampoo. I certainly wasn’t going to try and teach him how to wash his hair.”
The rough voice just behind his shoulder surprised Dean and he whirled around to see Cas standing right there, an innocent look on his face. “You, actually.”
“No. In fact, I told him I didn’t want to lose any memories of you and Sam. He said he wasn’t going to take anything away, but return something to me instead. The
Dean looked up from the cart and frowned. The broken window was…no longer broken. “This the same van?” He left the cart and checked under the steering column where the ignition wires had been hanging loose, then stood and closed the driver’s door. “This ain’t our van. Where’s ours?”
“Why are you hurting kids?” Sam demanded as he stood in the middle of the kids’ dark bedroom. “Too afraid to pick on an adult? Why don’t you try scratching
“Nonsense,” the cosmic entity retorted. “He can’t even sleep correctly. Has to be up and yapping his mouth, the ingrate.”
Gabriel seemed to consider something for a moment. “Castiel says Dean isn’t interested. I highly doubt that.”
“I don’t know if I can.” Castiel was feeling a little dizzy, thoughts flitting about like bees, though this time he couldn’t see the geometrical patterns they made among the flowers. “Maybe there really is something wrong with me.”
“I will…” Castiel looked around, suddenly uncomfortable, then sat stiffly in the desk chair. “I will wait here.”
Dean reached under his waistband, consequences be damned, and was panting just from the anticipation of jerking off to Cas’ moans next to him, when the moans turned to anguish.
Cas fixed Dean with a stare that Sam was just as happy not to be receiving. “I am who I am today because I met you. If there is a Castiel in this world, he would probably be nothing like me.”
“I may consider joining you on your run, if it seems like it might be helpful. I like the idea of a journal. I don’t know what I would write on, though.”
Ten minutes later, she was striding toward him, her smile predatory. “So, you’ve come to your senses?” she asked with a friendly shoulder bump.
“But I’m sure he has access to traffic cameras, all kinds of surveillance. He could triangulate your phone calls. It isn’t fair to drag you into this. You’re not safe either, with him. He’ll use you and spit you out once he has what he wants. I can’t do that to you, Dean.”
“When I first saw Dean in Hell,” Castiel repeated, a little louder, “I didn’t see the demon he was becoming. I didn’t see the twisted things Alastair forced him to do. I saw the brightness of his soul underneath all that. It was pure and radiant and brighter than any other I’d ever seen. It was…righteous.” Cas turned to look at Dean. “But you didn’t see that. I think you still don’t. You see yourself as tainted by what you’ve done.”
“Good. That’s good.” Gabriel came closer and sat awkwardly, one hip on the edge of Sam’s bed. He watched quietly for a few moments. “What’s going on? You’ve got a bunch of questions you’re not letting yourself ask.”
“I dunno, man. I mean, if you don’t want to…or can’t have that sort of…you know, because I’m human.”
servings of cereal because I liked it so much. I can’t lock that kid up in the dungeon, even if it’s going to keep him safe. Or keep us safe.”
Crossing his arms over his chest, Dean appraised him. Castiel could sense a growing curiosity in his energy. “So you’re saying if I ask, when it’s not, like, an emergency, you’d be receptive?”
“Whoa, Cas…” Sam held his hands up in a submissive gesture, and Castiel’s eyes were drawn to that same ink spot, now a bit faded, presumably after several hand-washings.
“Okay. How about this? I’ll send an official letter as your legal representation to your publisher’s legal department, arguing that since the Beast Hunters name was your intellectual property prior to signing with them, and not created by the publisher, that all rights to that name cease with the execution of a termination letter. Should they pursue any legal action against you for the use of said intellectual property, we will see them in court. And we’ll see what their response is.”
Dean leaned his head back against the headrest, feeling a post-flight headache coming on. “His name’s Cas. He writes as CJ Novak.”
Confused, Castiel tilted his head. Why would Dean want to sit next to him if he was about to tell him they were not family after all? Still, he couldn’t say no. “Of course.”
Sam knocked on Gabriel’s door, not sure how to interpret Cas’ silence. He was probably still angry at Dean’s attitude, and honestly, Sam didn’t blame him. Dean claimed he only needed four hours of sleep, but more than likely, his foul morning attitude was due to chronic sleep deprivation.
Mary glanced at the dozen or so remaining feet between them and Lucifer. “I’ll do more good here. I don’t belong back there. I’ll stay and help Bobby. Go now. Take care of Sam.”
wedding anniversary for John and Mary, Dean and Bobby in front of Singer’s Auto Shop, Sam’s and Jess’ wedding, a multi-generational photo of Sam and Dean with their parents and Sam’s and Jess’ kids, and the most unsettling, a photo of himself and Dean in tuxedos, showing off their wedding rings.
As he made his way through the hallway, he noticed also that the gray mist seemed to have thinned out some. On a hunch, we went to the far end of the hall where the children’s rooms were. Sure enough, the mist was gone, each door clearly seen from the others on this end. Heading back to the other end of the hall, the mist was thickest in front of the doors on which he hadn’t yet knocked. He sent another silent thanks to Dean for the visual cues, gathered his resolve, and knocked on what he was certain was Suicidal Dean’s door.
“I’m just saying, Castiel, for someone with his power, it wouldn’t be hard once he gets the hang of it. And if I were at full power, I probably could still find him.”
Dean stood and strode over to the kitchen, grabbed a beer out of the fridge, opened it, and drank half of it. He knew Cas didn’t have anything to do with this. Not really, But he was angry all the same, as if Cas had somehow misdirected him. “Fine,” he grumbled, more to himself.
“I have some you can use. If you feel you need them. But honest truth, Dean, I’m just thinking a hot soak with massaging jets. I’m not going to pressure you into anything.”
Sam initially had his concerns set on the ragged holes in Gabe’s wings, but he was distracted by the angry red abrasions circling his wrists. Reaching down, rather than out, he gently took Gabriel’s hands in his, noting for the first time how delicate those wrists were. “Let me start with these,” he said. “I’ll grab our kit.”
Dean pulled away slowly, his lips swollen and red and looking so very kissable, and Castiel reluctantly let him go. How a human being could be so beautiful was beyond his ability to comprehend.
And then the explosions began, fiery chunks of rock and hot ash falling from the sky, incinerating anything it touched. And the blast wave, stripping leaves from trees and the top layers of soil from the ground. And then sudden silence, as Castiel found himself back in Naomi’s office, strapped to her chair again.
By the time he came out, Cas was adjusting the water in the whirlpool, dressed only in a pair of orange boxers. Dean didn’t feel particularly embarrassed; he knew he looked good, barring a bit of softness on his belly that he was still trying to work off. But there was an intimacy to this moment that wasn’t like being in the locker room at the gym, and he fought the momentary impulse to cover himself.
Dean nodded thoughtfully as he slid a cassette into the Impala’s tape player and Kansas began singing about a wayward son. “Let’s think about it.”
Dean took the opportunity to find the room service menu, and after choking on the prices, decided their burger didn’t sound too bad. And bonus: they offered apple pie a la mode.
“I bought honey at the store last week,” Dean continued. “So you don’t have to drink it with sugar anymore.” He leaned forward and planted a kiss on Castiel’s cheek, then poured himself a cup of coffee. After looking around the kitchen as if he didn’t quite recognize it, Dean added, “I know you wanted to renovate the kitchen, babe, but this is going a little industrial, don’t you think?”
Castiel watched as Dean’s entire demeanor changed. He almost seemed to shrink, standing not as tall. Wrinkles etched in his face from stress and age smoothed out. Even the shape of his eyes changed, as if different muscles took over.
“Well, the alternative was kinda death,” Gabriel said, clapping Jack on the shoulder. “I’ll take this over death, y’know? ‘Sides, here we have fans.”
“Dean, it’s not that simple.” Cas let out a long sigh. “I may be more human than angel indefinitely.”
Setting his coffee down on the stainless steel island, Dean smiled. “You’re always thinkin’ about my feelings, aren’t you?” He came over, took Castiel’s face in his hands, and kissed him soundly on the lips while Castiel stood there, feeling stunned. “I don’t deserve you.”
Sam did sit up then, anger and betrayal rushing through his body and overriding the pain. “Those unattached hands were yours?” he rasped.
“Uh…” Sam double-checked the information before he continued. “It’s owned by a trust, but only the widow lives there.” He opened a new tab and searched death records. “See? Guy died ten years ago. And he was in his seventies.”
“And Tristan and Ross start to wonder if this could be the work of an angel. And if so, why is he doing this?” Dean said.
“You know we couldn’t have done anything for them,” Dean said softly. “I mean, if we weren’t here for Gabe—”
“What the—” Sam broke off as their meals arrived. He dropped his voice to just above a whisper. “What the hell is that supposed to mean?”
“Uh…yeah. I can take the couch,” he said, nodding toward the green couch in the corner. It wasn’t particularly comfortable, but with what Cas was going through, he could have the memory foam for a night.
“Dean was courageously honest with me,” Cas said. “What he was saying before that, I misunderstood. I thought he
“I’m not talking until you tell me what the hell you’re wearing.” Dean seemed to relax a bit. “Wait, is it October? Early Halloween party?”
Gabriel stared back for several long moments before shifting his position, one wing hanging over the side of the bed, and the other spread out across it.
“Also, you can’t keep tripping the breakers. And this?” Sam held up what had once been the brass mesh. “What’s up with this?”
“Mia, quit screaming like a howler monkey, would you?” the woman said, yanking on the girl’s arm. “The whole town can hear you and it’s unbecoming. Act like a lady or I’ll really give you something to cry about.”
Cas sat partway up, threw his arms around Dean, and pulled him up, moving so their erections rubbed together, and causing Dean to throw his head back and try to keep from coming right then. Cas was doing something else with his hands, but Dean couldn’t spare any thoughts about it as wave after wave of pleasure washed through him.
Sam chanced another look around the diner. No one new had arrived. The server was laughing at something the cook had said. The radio had changed to a different song. He watched the card game behind him for a moment.
“Look, Bela, there’s no deal right now. I met another author at FAWNcon and we were just brainstorming ideas about a crossover between our two series. That’s it. I don’t even know if we’re going to write it. And if we do, I’d go through all the proper channels.”
“Hey,” Sam said, poking his head into the spare bedroom where he found Gabriel. “You, uh, mind if I come in?”
Sam nodded, still fighting the yawn. He felt Gabriel's hands touch his side gently and while he was sure his ribs were still broken, they just…went numb.
“And your—” Dean stopped, a dozen thoughts buzzing in his head. “Your old trench coat was long and it flowed. The one I saved for you. But the newer one is short. Is it…your wings? You could fly when you had the old coat.” He huffed out a breath, wondering why he hadn’t seen this before. “The newer coat…it’s like your wings are clipped.”
“As a matter of fact… In approximately thirty-four minutes, if you continue at this speed, we’ll reach a gas station that has a speedy-mart. I’d like more snacks.”
“Hey, don’t knock inebriation as an escape method,” Dean added, looking at Gabe in the mirror. “Cas just had some tolerance issues. So what would you call it?”
Leaning back in his chair, Dean tipped the mouth of the bottle toward him. “Well, I’ll tell you what. I got something in my room that’ll play it. You come listen to it with me, ask any questions you want about the music, the lyrics, whatever, but give me your
“And if he doesn’t answer?” Sam couldn’t resist the temptation to needle his brother a little more and added, “If he’s too caught up learning about the birds and the bees?”
Gabriel returned an hour later, without Dean. Sam had been watching the clock, trying to determine if he was able to sleep, even for a few minutes. He heard the soft knock on his door and managed to croak out a “Come in.”
“The only thing standing between you and what you want—all of you—is what you believe,” Michael said.
Sam waved it away. “I mean, I think I even have a type. Someone who can be both authoritative and fun. Confident and caring.” Sam swallowed past the lump in his throat. “Jess made me laugh more than anyone else I’d met up until then. But she could also tell me to sit down, shut up, and do my homework. And I would. I loved that I could laugh so much with her. And I loved her bossy side too. I think it was that she had both sides that made it work.”
Cas sat down and Sam noticed a slight wince with the movement. “Will you take some painkillers, Cas?”
“I am clean as well,” Cas said, tearing open a condom wrapper, “considering you’re the first person I’ve been with. But better safe than sorry.” He rolled on the condom and added actual lube. “By the way, these are polyurethane, not latex. The massage oil won’t damage them.”
“That is entirely beside the point.” Naomi pointed to her chair. “Sit. Now. I’m going to make sure you don’t interfere again.”
Castiel took the few moments of silence to review what he knew. A fractured mind was not new, even though Castiel didn’t have personal experience with it. It was different from the wall in Sam’s mind. That had truly been a wall, thick and sturdy. A barrier. What was going on with Dean was more like deep cracks. Chasms.
Dean dropped to Cas’ side, holding the angel’s shoulders, his arms, the sides of his face. “Cas? Cas! C’mon buddy. What hurts? How can we help?” When Cas didn’t even acknowledge his presence, he turned to Gabriel. “Can you fix him? Heal him? Something? Anything?”
“I remember that one,” Cas said. “Turned out a serial killer was the organ donor, and you used cell memory science to show that the need to kill survived the transplant. That was really well-written.”
“Pretty sure all those potential baby fruit trees would disagree with your breakfast too,” Dean said, before stuffing an entire sausage link into his mouth to prove a point.
, his mind provided, and he willed himself to relax. The second knuckle of Sam’s middle finger had a spot of ink on it, perhaps where the pen he’d been writing with had accidentally marked him. Castiel found himself focusing in on that ink spot, following it back and forth, calming as he did, and starting to feel disconnected from his body, as if he was starting to leave his vessel behind.
Why would Dean have taken him to a hospital? He shifted his shoulders and confirmed that his wings weren’t out. That didn’t make sense either. Dean was so careful about making sure he didn’t break these new laws. Castiel examined his hands and arms for any needles or other human-life-sustaining fittings when one of the curtains slid open.
“Middle of fucking nowhere, Kansas,” Dean answered. “I’m gonna drive you home. Sam’ll take your truck. Can you unbuckle your seat belt?”
“Uh…” Sam shook his head with a slight shrug. “We’ve been over this before. Yeah, you did some pretty awful things, but, you know, we dealt with it. You’re still family.”
, not me. I know I’m not on his favorite-angel list. In fact, I’m pretty sure that’s a damn short list. One name. You catchin’ my drift?”
“Cas!” He sat up quickly, instantly regretted it, and blinked his eyes several times, trying to wake up.
Castiel cocked his head, giving Dean his confused-puppy look. “In what way do you even remotely resemble a severed organ?”
when you think of that? Not gonna lie, Cas, this is not doing a whole lot for my sexual self-esteem here.”
“I don’t know,” Castiel said, holding the drawing carefully. It felt like a treasure. If Sam was right, and this part held Dean’s innocence, and this part
“I’m an angel, Sam. I think I can handle a teenager. You finish eating and I will take care of Dean.”
Dean looked up at the ceiling, confirming what was, in fact, up, then sat down at the table and gestured with his beer that Cas should do the same. “’Kay, I’m not sayin’ that I’m not forgiving you. Just… I thought we put this behind us: the lies and betrayals, leaving without telling us and then not even a phone call. What’s bringin’ this up again?”
The new something reached his solar plexus and Dean felt like a missing piece had been reunited, as if some part of himself that he’d lost long ago had now been returned. Which made no sense, until the thought made it through Dean’s pleasure-soaked brain that maybe he was feeling the piece of Cas’ grace that had been left behind, now reunited with Cas himself. Was that even possible?
“What about being twelve? Or your early teen years?” When Dean shrugged, he added, “What about high school? Do you remember high school graduation?”
Dean sighed. The bridge was, at best, sixteen feet from edge to edge. Not wide enough for the nearly-eighteen-foot-long Impala to make a U-turn. “You better be right.”
Castiel could hear Raphael’s furious report over angel radio, followed by Raphael returning to Heaven, but ignored it.
“Yeah. I did. I went to a panel on marketing. Someone I met there was on it, and I went to be supportive, but I wound up learning enough to know that writing another book a year was going to be less work than trying to market myself.”
Replacing the jam packets in the condiment container, Castiel explained, “Back then, there were only a few demons and they were only allowed to feed on the energy of human sins. It was a sort of cosmic cleansing system. Humans began each year with a clean conscience and demons purged their sins from the world. But the demons got greedy.”
“Safer than you are right now. Here.” Gabriel held out a cup of water and a bendy straw. “This will help.”
just sounded wrong on every level. “You, uh… You kind of took care of me last night. Kept me, uh, warm, and all. Maybe I can return the favor.”
“Of course not,” Rowena continued. “As if I would do anything for that ungrateful excuse for a son.”
“’Kay. How’re we going to do this? You write the angel parts and I write my characters? Or do you want to alternate chapters?”
Waves of regret and anger and hurt tore through him, shaking him. He heard an audible cry and wondered if it was his own. Still the shaking continued, though now focused on his upper arms. Why…?
kind of not normal. More like Sammy’s kind. How can you come to a place like this and not have bacon?” He flagged the waitress down and asked if he could get a salad to go.
Dean sat down at the kitchen table and grabbed hold of the table’s edge, focusing on his breathing as blackness encroached on his vision.
“Because it’s a pretty big hole,” Gabriel said. “And he’s already building up some fluid in the one lung, which is going to make it harder to reinflate. It’s the best I can do right now.”
Breathing in and out as instructed, Castiel wasn’t sure what emotions were coursing through his vessel. He wanted to return to the image, to fight Naomi, to drive that drill right through her skull and give her a taste of her own medicine. Another memory flickered. Didn’t someone already do that? But Naomi survived. And was trying to maintain Heaven.
“No. No good will come of this. The angels will fall, you will die, and I will be left feeling like this was all my fault. And it isn’t. You lied to me. You
made. Yes, we found a way to disable the implant. It wasn’t intentional; it was an accident. But it happened, and Gabriel thinks he may know how to disable the others.”
“She’s very committed to helping people in the camp,” Jack said. “She’d already told me she was thinking of staying if the option were presented. Although she’d be safer if I was there to protect her.”
Castiel made his way toward Dean’s bedroom, wondering which Dean would require him to be slow. Which primary emotion would he encounter? Could be anger. Or fear. Or disgust.
The sound of giggling brought him back to the present and he looked over his shoulder to see Castiel surrounded by the three children, caught somewhere between a polite smile and a frustrated glare.
Castiel stood, went over to Dean, and sat down next to him. “I’m not opposed to that. However, I am mindful that there are three children just down the hall. And at least two other adults who would probably like to kill me, one of whom knows I’m here.”
Gabriel hung his head. “I’m sorry. I really didn’t expect that to happen the first time. It took me as much by surprise.”
“Okay. I’ll pass all this along to Cas when he gets here tomorrow night.” Dean could hear high-pitched talking in the background.
of Dean.” Before Dean could throw out another argument, Castiel added, “Do you have any memories of being in Hell? Of being a demon? Of carrying the mark?”
“Jack?” Sam said aloud. “I’m really concerned about you. I want to make sure you’re safe. And…we know more now too. At least come back so we can talk.”
“Dude, that’s creepier than I can deal with right now,” Dean grumbled. “I know you don’t need sleep, but come lie down on the bed and pretend.”
Breathing erratically, Cas continued to whimper until his face cleared and his eyes focused. “D—Dean?”
certainly don’t. Although,” he looked at Dean with some combination of humor and pity, “this could be quite entertaining for a while.”
part of your memories through what I can only call torture. Bad enough that you blocked it out. This isn’t about erasing anything. It’s about…” Sam seemed to be searching for a word… “integrating everything you’ve experienced and have it not take you out of the present or bring up any fear or anger or, you know, the desire to smite someone.”
“It is also not unusual for those seeking forgiveness to moan or cry out in their eagerness,” Castiel noted as he stood.
Castiel could feel Dean’s chin nestled in his hair, almost touching his scalp. “I… Could… Could I stay with you?”
Crossing the Iowa/Missouri state line was as easy as it was crossing from Minnesota into Iowa. Checkpoints may stop most of the traffic, but smuggling an angel across state lines was going to remain ridiculously easy unless all the states built walls along their borders. Dean drove with headlights where he knew there was no likelihood of being stopped, running lights or completely dark where there was.
Castiel’s gaze went from the man’s attire to his face and he sighed heavily. “Gabriel,” his voice came out in a rasp. “What are you doing here? And where am I?”
“But I feel whole already, Cas.” Dean sat back down on the bed. “That’s the problem. Everything I don’t remember, I don’t want it.”
Dean wasn’t sure how to answer that. Hard work, persistence, knowing the right people, making concessions, and sheer luck were certainly part of being published. But faith? He looked away, up at one of the skyscrapers across the next intersection before they started walking again. “How about you?” he finally asked Cas. “What got you into writing?”
“I can help,” Jack said, excitement in his voice. In the blink of an eye, he disappeared, returning moments later with three…no, four newspapers in his arms.
“Yeah…” Dean tried to get his schedule straight in his head. “I’m on another panel this afternoon. Paths to publication. And I have a signing after. But maybe after that?”
“What do you know about these circles?” Castiel asked once he joined Dean at the door. He pointed to the discolored carpet once the door was opened.
Dean wasn’t sure about freeing the angels first, thinking they might prove to be more hindrance than allies. He didn’t care about earning brownie points in Heaven. And he definitely didn’t believe in reciprocal altruism. But Cas was insistent. And the more passionate he got in his argument for freeing Gabriel and the angels first, the more his wings flared out, seemingly unconsciously. And Dean simply couldn’t say no to that.
“Not me, amigo,” Gabriel said. “I have nothing to do with this, and nothing to gain by it. It’s not even fun.”
As Jack exhaled, Cas put his hand on Jack’s shoulder. “I have let you down, Jack. I should have taught you that you don’t need to do everything yourself. A truly powerful choice is one in which you weigh information and opinions of others, along with what you feel in your heart, and
“Or,” Cas continued softly, his face inches from Dean’s ear, “perhaps you would prefer I find someone else. Someone who smells like food?”
Castiel expected to find himself back in Naomi’s office. Or in her chair. Or any of the places he’d come to expect with this process. An Egyptian palace was somewhere near the bottom of his list. He remembered this one. He even remembered his orders, because it was one of the first times he thought outright that it was
In this meditative state, he was all at once everywhere and in a single point, watchful over the bunker, over the two precious souls that slept in its confines, and also an individual spark of being, unattached to emotion, thought, or physical sensation, a willing patron in a multi-sensory movie called
“I did. I got on an airplane—a cramped, smelly, noisy airplane—and flew to Lebanon. The country. From there, I convinced various travelers to get me to Damascus. After that, I talked at length to a belligerent camel, who eventually agreed to carry me to the location of the Tree of Life, where I encountered the Djinn who were guarding it.”
As they made their way across the field, Dean could make out a sign in front of the building next to the parking lot. A library. If they were closed, there was a good chance no one would be missing their car until morning. “Sam, go see if the library’s closed, or if anyone’s inside.”
And there it was: the call to sleep, to sink into the silent blackness and be rid of the pain, the brokenness, the failures that followed him everywhere he went, in everything he did.
“I was hoping maybe we could take a road trip for our crossover novel,” Cas admitted. “But we haven’t had a chance to talk about it with everything else going on.”
“Shower first, then food, then sleep. And no staring,” Dean said. “During any of those.” He grabbed some clean clothes out of his duffel and locked himself in the bathroom. Sure, either Cas or Gabe could get past the lock, but maybe it would be a deterrent to Gabe throwing squares of toilet paper on him while he showered.
Sam consulted his notepad. “Okay, so we’re still working with the image of Naomi holding her drill, right?”
“If I initiate it, then yes, Cas, you can take that as consent to respond in kind. And I guess—I mean, you
“Gotta be the angel mojo,” Dean said. “I can’t believe you’re a real angel. Like, mind: blown.” He mimed an explosion around his head.
“I’m not going to leave you in pain if I can help it.” Sam moved closer and gestured to Gabe’s wings. “Lemme see. Maybe there’s something I can do.”
Castiel let out a long breath, his face relaxing a fraction. “You’re right, of course.” His blue eyes looked like pools of sorrow. “With that implant, they have no choice but to allow him to mistreat them.”
Dean gasped, his eyes rolling back into his head as he breathed heavily, mouth open. Castiel kissed every part of Dean he could reach, his hand seeming to know what to do on its own, their own fluids enhancing the sensation, grace continuing to pulse, and Castiel felt those wingbeats again as he moved with Dean, until he felt himself speeding toward the edge of a cliff.
Unaware of how he was laying on the bed, he pulled Cas down on top of him, relishing the heat and solidity pressing down on him. Cas nipped at his neck and he tried to hold back a moan.
“He didn’t have enough faith,” Castiel argued. “I simply reassured him. You got the result you wanted, didn’t you?”
“Yeah, of course. You wanna help me wash dishes? And explain why, in this kitchen renovation, you didn’t put in a dishwasher?”
Castiel felt a plunging disappointment, and he wished his wings still worked so he could leave this conversation before it became any more painful. “Yes. You have.”
“And you were kind of shitty to him,” Sam added. “So I can understand why he didn’t want to be around you.”
“Protecting you, Dean. You, yourself, said not even a week ago that you did not want to engage in watersports.”
“The supernatural exists here, Dean. Remember when we were the actors? There was no magic. No angel powers.”
“Why is my life a joke to you?” Husband Dean demanded. “Are you putting me down like so many other people do, just because I’m a mechanic?”
“Gwendolyn? Nobody ever saw her baby. She was pregnant and then she wasn’t, and right after Constance died, she disappeared. And she was farther along than Constance. My great-grandmother saw Constance nearly every day. She would have seen Gwendolyn’s baby, but she didn’t.”
“He’d recognize Cassie or me if we got anywhere near him,” Gabe said. “We’d have to stay here, behind the wards.”
“One thing about us, Jack,” Dean said, “is that what you see is what you get. If I don’t trust you, I’m gonna tell you I don’t trust you. And right now? I don’t trust you. But Lucifer—or whatever connection you’ve got to him—he twists everything.”
Dean’s eyes widened as Hester continued to introduce the panelists. He was barely aware of his own introduction.
Castiel nodded and reached out to Dean with his grace, a specific image in mind. Within seconds, he found it and retreated completely. “Thank you.”
“’Kay. We got enough gas to get us to Indianapolis. We can switch plates or cars then.” Dean glanced at his brother. “I’m glad you’re back. No matter how it happened. Cas wouldn’t even let me—” He stared out the windshield and pushed all the emotions back down. “Wouldn’t let me go after you. I would’ve, you know. Even if they tore me to shreds.”
“Sometimes it just helps to cry too,” nine-year-old Dean said. “I’ve cried a lot. And prayed. And now you’re all here.”
“Right here, right here,” Gabe said from close behind him. “Why does he always seem to have a death wish around you, huh? Did you forget to give him a cake for his birthday?”
“So what if I am? Apocalypse-world Michael isn’t exactly friendly. Lucifer almost managed to kill me before. He
“Well, now you get to be the helper. Which is cool, actually. You weren’t a very good social services guy. And an even worse agent. And a really crappy pizza man.”
—from everyone. Learned how to make all the desserts with a few not-man-made ingredients, which reminds me, when this is over and my sweet patootie is safe and sound, I’ll make an apple pie with some deliciously unearthly apples, if you know what I mean. And that’ll make your pet Dean-o gloriously happy, and I know how happy you are when he’s happy, am I right?”
“Castiel?” a familiar voice called out faintly. “Baby bro, I hope you can hear me. It’s time. I wish I could have given you some more warning, but I just found out. They’re getting me ready to go. Curtain’s up at three o’clock. Please be early. This is one part I don’t want to play.”
. God knew, he’d tried. He felt a surge of anger at Chuck. Chuck could have healed his wings instead of giving him…whatever this was. That would have been much more helpful. Being able to fly again would make helping Sam and Dean so much easier, and then he’d have more insurance against being kicked out of the bunker.
Cas shook his head sadly. “The bond is about all I can do now. I am now the equivalent of a human psychic, with my abilities mostly limited to you. I kept enough grace to have that with you, because that was important to me. I may not be able to heal you, but with the bond, I will have a better idea if you’re hurt or in danger.”
People were beginning to fill the room, taking out their phones and snapping photos of the panelists. Dean made sure to school his features into a charming smile that he’d practiced over FaceTime with Bela until she was satisfied.
“Can you do that?” Dean asked, pointing his flashlight at the paper map spread out over the hood of his rapidly-cooling Impala. It was eerily quiet, the stars bright across the broad expanse of the night sky.
Trying to hide his frustration, Dean pulled out Charming Smile #5 and leaned toward the server. “You got any honey, honey? My friend here likes honey with his coffee.”
Castiel entered and glanced around the room. No clothes on the floor. The bedcovers looked neat and orderly. “What’s the last thing you remember?”
Dean tapped the steering wheel as he thought. “Well, it’s nearly dusk now. We should reach the Iowa-Missouri border in about five and a half hours. Like I said earlier, the checkpoints seem to only be near towns or on highways. So I think we can make it into Missouri, but getting across the Missouri River into Kansas is the critical part. It’ll take us about another hour to where I expect they’ll set up a checkpoint.” He looked at his watch. “That puts us at the checkpoint at maybe one in the morning.”
“I… Thanks, buddy. But we don’t know what we’re up against here. Ain’t our world, and you might need your grace for something. So don’t use it all up on unnecessary things, okay?”
“Focus on what you desire,” Michael suggested. “Focus on love. Focus on your sense of your chosen family.”
Sam sat forward in his chair. “What did he show you, Cas? I promise, Dean will shut up and listen.” He sent his best bitchface to his brother. “Won’t he?”
“In the news,” Cas added, “dozens of witnesses describe an EMT, or a med tech, or a tow truck driver, or a concerned citizen, someone who seemed to completely belong there, who had their hands on the one who miraculously survived. Someone whom no one recognizes, no one knows their name, no one knows where they came from or where they went, and their descriptions don’t match any known employees.”
“Great. I want you to picture that image of Naomi’s drill coming toward you. And at the same time, hold the thought,
Castiel licked his lips. “You will need to teach me that one.” He leaned in and kissed Dean. “I require some remedial tutoring.”
“We’ll start on the far end,” Hester continued, “with CJ Novak, author of the popular Angel Warriors series.”
“The hunter would ask why I was asking,” Cas said. “Rather than asking what happened or who did it.” He narrowed his eyes. “You already know what happened and who did it.”
“Yeah…” Sam looked toward Castiel questioningly, and Castiel was fairly certain why. They were originally going to propose the bulletin board to ‘Tween Dean,’ as Sam had nicknamed him. Should they instead pitch the idea to this child part?

Sam raised his eyebrows in that infuriating way that made Dean feel stupid. “It doesn’t matter, Dean. All that matters is that I got to read some of the messages, which talked about how the implant not only had GPS, but also bound the angel to its vessel, caused excruciating pain if anyone tried to remove the implant, and pretty much rendered the angels human, except for being able to show their wings.”
Cas gave him a half-smile. “I’ve read your reviews on Amazon and Goodreads. You’re doing a lot of good, Dean.”
The rest of the table attendees introduced themselves, revealing about half authors and half fans. The other authors were respectful toward Dean, but were overflowing with questions and praise for Cas.
. And you are certainly not to feel anything for or about them. This must be addressed immediately. Sit here.” She motioned to a reclining chair in her office.
Gabriel shrugged and winced as the cuffs pulled on his wings. “I don’t know. Sam asked me to stay for a while. And I can’t really go out looking like this. Fashion disaster, you know. They’d roast me in the tabloids.”
