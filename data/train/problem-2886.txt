“And I would, but not immediately. You aren’t ready for that yet. How are you touching yourself right now?”
*                             *                             *                             *
Castiel didn’t say a word, as he watched his boyfriend from where he sat in the passenger seat, trying to blink away tears as he drove. His face was hardened and expressionless, but Castiel could still see the pain in those eyes. His father had went too far, a vase full of secrets was dropped tonight, and all of Dean’s darkest moments were on display for everyone to see. Shortly after the outburst Bobby had punched John in the face and dragged him out of the house, locking the door behind him. All of the other guests left as well, murmuring their ‘goodnights’ and ‘thank you for inviting me’. Ellen had tried to get them to stay, cool off for a while and let Dean collect himself before he set out to drive them home. He refused with repeating that he was ok. Sam left shortly before them, finally having calmed his son enough that he fell asleep, and Ruby left with them.
“The coffee shop?” he gripped his hips, hoping the touch was well received.
“To be honest I did.”
“You busy this weekend Cas?”
“Why do you smell so good?” Dean growled his lust for Castiel g rowing with each breathe he took.
“I was, but I don’t wanna kill your vibe. I’ll go stay with Mom.”
Saturday morning—well once he’d looked at his phone it was actually the afternoon. Castiel hadn’t slept that long in a very long time. Again he was reminded that he was getting comfortable here. No dreams had plagued him, no visions of the past, or warnings of the future. He’d just slept. As he rose from his bed to start his morning tea and get ready for the day he realized how good he felt. To just rise with a light heart and empty mind, it was invigorating. He wondered if this was a normal occurrence for the average person, to just awaken every morning in such a lazy fashion. He didn’t have to work, he didn’t need to run from anything. This ease was something he could get used to, even if it wasn’t the best course of action.
Castiel observed the scene quietly, hoping he wouldn’t be seen before he can gauge what was happening in front of him. For the 30 seconds it took for either of them to notice him, he found Mr. Roman trying to convince his father into some sort of business deal and his father refusing due to the issues their sons have had. A pit of pride swelled in his chest at his father refusing a deal in defense of him. It gave him the confidence needed to announce his presence and walk into the room.
Castiel spun around in Dean’s arms and kissed him gently. They stayed like that for a while until Cas withdrew completely. The impending conversation that he knew needed to take place before they went any further darkened his mind. He didn’t think he could tell the details of what took place on that terrible night, but he could at least tell Dean what he was and was not ready for.
“I believe you Dean.”
“What kind of cone do you want? Or do you want a sundae?”
“Stop running away from me Dean. Every time I get close you shut down and run away.” Dean was powerless under the gaze of those cerulean eyes. His defenses felt weak and were beginning to crack under the other mans’ anger. “Every day this week I’ve tried to talk to you. Let you know that I’m here for support should you need it. And every last time you just walk away from me. I’ve grown quite tired of it. Then you try and throw things in my face that aren’t even my fault!? This ends now.” He growled.
“They better not have been. Regardless, I don’t want to see either of them again.”
“Don’t you go blaming him for this.” Bobby spoke now. “We got a right to know if something goes off the rail for you boys. Seeing as how we mostly raised you.”
“I don’t think I could afford an apartment. Even if it is somewhat furnished.”
“Don’t be like that. You need to get some action in your life.”
Dean flinched and watched as a red headed girl he never seen before bounced over to him. Another person emerged from the car grumbling and begging the red head girl to leave Dean alone. Dean would know that gravelly voice anywhere.
Castiel was instantly alert as someone was shaking his shoulder gently. His eyes blinked up to the friendly face of the driver. She had an almost sympathetic look on her face, like she could tell he was running. He wondered how many people she had to do this for on a daily basis. He shook the last tendrils of sleep off of himself as the woman stepped back, still smiling down at him.
“I’ve been fine. Father I’m just going to grab a few things and I’ll be on my way.” He did his best to ignore the man.
“No reason.” He lied. He didn’t like lying to Dean, as far as he knew he’s never lied to him and he truly felt bad about it. But Dean had enough on his plate and he didn’t want to worry about any of that. “How are you?”
“I’d say opposites definitely attract with you guys.” Sam tittered.
“I’d lick every damn morsal off and keep licking even after it’s gone.”
Upon arrival to the mysterious destination Dean’s face seemed to be stuck in a permanent grin. Castiel peered out of the window trying to find out what this place was. Moondoor: restaurant and bookstore, the large sign read.
“Hello Castiel.” His Father smiled as he approached him.
His life overall was pretty predictable. He lived on campus since the commute would be completely unreasonable. He went to class during the day and studied in the evening, sometimes being able to fit in a small semblance of a social life in there. He liked routine, and throughout his life that’s what he went by. Every day it was the same thing, from sun up to sundown. While that might drive some people insane it actually gave him a sense of calm since he had never handled surprises well. That’s what he expected this weekend since he didn’t have a date for Valentine’s Day and really wasn’t upset about it. All of his friends were either going out with their significant others, or partying for the weekend to find someone to lay with to take away the loneliness.
*********
And just like that they were children again and not full grown men, they began swatting and poking at each other until the was a knock on the door. They sprang apart as if preparing for a scolding from mother instead of the real reason they were there. Gabriel with a smirk and a saucy wink went to get the door while Castiel busied himself with his camera.
“Of course, I did. That’s what brothers do.” Sam said with rolled eyes.
~~~~~~~~~~~~
See this was the dark side of his ability, strangers unloading on him the second their eyes met. His mother had warned him about this, just after his powers manifested. People would try to use him for evil, and this was why he was on the run. His mind wondered to those times as he was combing the coffee supplies the local grocery store had to offer. Even after all of these years there was still a rough-edged void within him from the loss of his family.
Dean looked up, and when he did he was definitely looking at Castiel now and not the camera. Unconsciously he had moved forward even more, standing right at the edge of the bed. His legs were no longer in the shot now, it was just his furiously moving toy hand and everything above it. His moans were constant now, the man was clearly about to orgasm.
When they got in the apartment, Castiel was met with a sight. Off to the side of his couch was a chest high book case. It was made of a dark wood to match the couch and coffee table, shining as if polished. His books from Moondoor and the few he traveled with were already sat upon it.
“At school? And what about after? I’m use to this treatment, but how do you think Cas feels?”
He pulled Castiel forward until his shaft reached his lips and his thighs sat framing Dean’s head. He got the gist of what was going on when Dean tilted his head up and began sucking on him. He used his hands on Castiel to push his hips forward so he wouldn’t have to put too much strain on his neck. Dean loved hearing all the moans and sighs he could pull from his boyfriend. It lit a fire within him that was threatening to burst open with pure animal instinct. He had to pull the reigns back though since this was their first time together.
“You wanna hitch a ride instead?”
“You gotta be quiet now. We can’t get caught or that’ll be trouble for both of us.”
“Well we were just hanging out watching movies and suddenly dad shows up. I thought it was you so I just opened the door. He said he had to tell me something then he noticed Cas and it just spiraled out of control from there. How did Cas even call you?”
“Hey little brother.” He smiled and wrapped his arms around the other man’s back.
Dean plated their food and brought everything over to the couch. Castiel’s mind was wrapped up around what he had seen so far on that computer. He even took the beer Dean offered without a second thought because he was so distracted. Dean had put on a movie and they ate while watching it, though he wasn’t paying much attention to it. Had Dean realized that he offered Castiel the computer with the porn on it or did he trust Cas not to snoop in his private files? Dean was a very smart man so he leaned towards the later. Castiel didn’t mean this as an invasion or privacy, even though it was, he just wanted to satisfy his curious nature without making things awkward. He could finish his research once he got home and wipe up the trail it would leave behind before he returned it.
It was a constant push and pull of ‘I want to help people and make the world a better place’ and ‘Let it be someone else’s problem’. Normally, he was more the former, but lately it’s been a lot of the later. He’s frustrated, and rightfully so. The only thing keeping him from completely going off the deep end was the fact that this was not only for the well-being of so many people, this was also for Cas.
One young woman in particular he got stuck talking to for a solid hour, she just wouldn’t stop. He’d taken several customers in between, but she continued on. Missouri had to intervene, steering the girl towards the front of the shop and doing something to distract her. He’d apologized profusely but the older woman just waved him off.
“Duh.”
Friday came soon. Faster than Dean could realize. Mid terms whizzed by with the week and now he had a ton of grading to struggle through. Most of the exam was multiple choice which made his life a hell of a lot easier. He was now getting out the shower getting dressed for the party. He was nervous and excited he’d get to dance and spend quality time with Cas since they weren’t able with exams happening. But he was nervous to meet his older brother. Plus he’s a professor attending a college party. His costume didn’t have a mask but it did have a hat so if he spotted anyone he recognized he could pull it down to hide his face. He couldn’t resist being Indiana Jones.
“Well that was great.” Dean sighed looking at a clueless Cas. “Breakfast is ready.”
Even though the grades were supposed to be sent via the school’s website so that the students could see them Dean still felt the need to send personal emails to each student. He would tell them what they need to work on and how good they did.  He loved sharing knowledge with people who didn’t have it previously, and was always willing to give pointers and offer help. That’s what he loved the best about teaching anyhow, it’s what made him want to pursue his career in the first place. He watched as Cas check his phone and loved the grin that slowly made it’s way on his partner’s face. Dean loved seeing a full out genuine smile on his face and he would put his best efforts forth to keep it that way.
After what felt like eons they slowly separated and their foreheads touched in the middle of them. Dean noticed his family had retreated inside, probably to give them privacy in this moment.
Turns out the job Gabriel supposedly had for him was the worst thing possible. Apparently some of the execs we’re throwing some high class dinner party as a ‘reward’ for their top performers. Gabe wanted Dean to pretty much convince the others to go to this ‘optional’ shindig. He was entirely against events like this as was everyone else. It was all fake and unnecessary. Plus Dean was extremely allergic to small talk.
“No I will send you the file and you can handle that.”
“I will talk to Missouri about the apartment Monday and hopefully I can move in soon.”
“What time should I arrive? Should I bring anything?”
Cas looked too good today. He wore a black button-up and jeans with a tan trench coat. He looked so innocent but all too delectable. Dean whisked away the thoughts that were beginning to rise seeing as how he was holding his little nephew.
relationship?”
*                             *                             *                             *
“Are you alone Dean?”
“Um yes.”
Dean was really fed-up with these milk runs. Sending him out on these level 1 hunter cases was an insult to him to say the least. Don’t get him wrong, saving people, hunting things, it wasn’t only the family business but something that he enjoyed doing. He took pride in his work, thrived in the purpose it gave him. But on the flip side he knew he was being sent out because of the fit he threw at the last meeting. He was right in his anger at the situation and he was right to be angry at everyone for taking his Dad’s side. It wasn’t right, them making him lie to Cas like that. Twice more he pressed his opinion on the issue and that third time he let his anger take over, cussing out everyone present, even his Mom. He didn’t take kindly to being pitied and patronized like he was. He wasn’t some child trying to convince the adults that cookies before dinner wouldn’t ruin his appetite. He was a man trying to tell his significant other that they were trying to take down an organization that was plotting to use him like a tool.
He’d eaten here before and thought their pastries superior to the other cafes he’s been too. To hear that Dean not only bakes but his results were far tastier made Castiel want to throw him in a kitchen and not let him leave until he made a masterpiece.
“I’ve never been into that particular subject, but Dean makes it interesting.”
Dean reached over and grabbed the vibrating device that he was doing his best to ignore. One look at the screen and his whole fuzzy mood was destroyed. His father was calling. Knots began to form in his stomach and if Cas wasn’t practically on top of him right now he would began to have a full blown panic attack. He felt his heart start to race and with that his breathing quickened. He gave Cas a quick kiss in hopes that it would calm him down. His dad has been calling him for weeks. He wants to escape the inevitable, but he knows he can’t avoid the man forever. Bobby and Ellen will hunt him down eventually if he stays MIA. Reluctantly he picked up the call, putting the phone to his ear and not saying a word.
“I’ll give you what you need, but you gotta finish the video first.”
“Are you hungry?” Dean spoke first.
Dean’s body felt stiff in the embrace, the whirl wind of emotions preventing him from melting in the embrace like he usually would. His walls were building themselves back up against his will. He wanted to be open with Cas. He wanted to be vulnerable in front of this man he cared for, but old scars were resurfacing and he couldn’t bring himself to do that.
When all was said and done, everyone helped clean up and went on their merry way. He’d gotten pats on the back, hugs, and handshakes from everyone before Dean and he parted ways in the Impala. When they pulled up to his building Dean had stopped him with a hand on his forearm before he could get out the car.
*		*		*		*
A wave of worry tumbled over him at that. So he could tell Dean, but the topic was a secret. That was suspicious in itself, but he still scheduled the when and where with the man. He would be picking him up from school after the study group and dropping him off at home so he could spend time with his father that he’d practically abandoned. He showered, brushed his teeth, and finally met Dean in the kitchen.
“Then I want to be as far away as possible.”
He texted Dean throughout the days they couldn’t see each other and he found himself truly missing the other man. Now he was huddled over several open books and papers neatly organized for each subject and his phone in his hand. His neck was stiff from sitting in the same position for far too long, but he just continually tapped away on the screen and sipped from his coffee he actually took a break to make.
“That’s perfect.” He smiled.
“No.” he answered honestly. “It was him. I don’t even want to open it.”
“Most of it is your solo stuff.”
And he did now that he had permission. Gripping his ass, running his hands along the soft skin of his hips, rubbing his nipples. Castiel did it all because he could. It wasn’t long until he felt the pull of his climax making itself known. Bracing his feet on the bed without bending his knees too much gave him some leverage to pump into Dean at a rapid pace.
The moment between the two was suddenly interrupted my Dean’s phone ringing loud. He had to admit for the last couple days he had been scared it was his father calling. He’d been dodging him and Bobby’s calls for the last week or so. He’d promised Sam he would wait before taking the dive and he always made good on his promises. Pulling it from his pocket he was it was indeed his brother calling.
“Um yeah that’s fine. I’ve got some homework to do and Charlie probably wants to hang out.” he said not letting his eyes meet Dean’s.
Castiel took a breath before retelling what happened that day. He shared about how happy Sam was that Dean had shared his life story with him, and how he felt like they were drifting apart due to what his father had done. Dean listened with all his attention on Castiel, and he felt a soft blush forming on his cheeks.
“He was rattling off about how he wants to finally be a father to us, and how he wants to see Mark and be a good grandfather to him. All sweet talk and bullshit.” Sam’s tone raised significantly as he talked. “I don’t want him around you Dean. We both know that never ends well.”
He couldn’t find it in himself to be angry about it though. An honest question deserves the same of the answer given, he just wasn’t ready to provide one.
“Reservations Dean?”
“Lights, camera, action. Real simple.”
He copy and pasted a generic text to everyone, only personalizing a few of them for those he was close to. Then he shot off one to Gabriel letting him know the deed was done.
Castiel chuckled at the sight in front of him. There was a giant bowl of popcorn in the middle of Dean’s coffee table and two large mugs filled to the brim with hot chocolate. Dean wasn’t kidding when he said he just wanted to cuddle and be warm with Castiel. Once they were seated Dean tossed a large fuzzy, black blanket across both their shoulders and cuddled next to his boyfriend. He let the movie play as Cas grasped one of his hands and intertwined their fingers together. He felt all of his walls slowly crumbling as time went on. He was content he could spend time with someone else like this, just basking in each other’s warmth with no hidden motives.
Castiel knew that it was customary to end a date with a kiss so he leaned into the man’s space to do just that. Those full lips found their way into many of his thoughts since he’d first seen Dean. He wasn’t sure where all this confidence came from, probably the ease that Dean carried himself with was rubbing off on him. As their lips met it took a second for Dean to get on board with the program but when he did it was glorious. His plush lips were warm and slid against his with ease. This was far better than his first kiss. Dean was practiced and not nervous at all. He coaxed his lips open with his tongue and when they met, well that changed everything. A soft, long moan filled the car and it took a moment for Castiel to realize it was his own voice. A heat bloomed within him that he never knew before. Dean must’ve felt it too because his kisses grew deeper and more forceful. It was such an honest, raw sense of bliss. As Dean pulled away, he tried to chase his lips to keep that feeling.
Friday proved to be a very interesting day. He’d come into work that morning with a bright smile on his face. Missouri tutted at him, assuming that it had to do with Dean, but she chose to make no comment about it. There was a steady flow of customers, a lot of them wanting to ask questions about various products. One guy stood out the most, asking him about the various tea blends; what was in them and what their purpose was. He’d learned the man’s name was Balthazar and they bonded for a minute about having peculiar names. The man was pleasant, even when he turned him down for a date, letting him know that he’d already had a boyfriend.
“I care about him very much.”
Dean snuck a glance at Castiel once Chuck put his head down to concentrate on the task given to him. He mouthed ‘help me’ and Castiel couldn’t help the chuckle that burst out of him. He pulled his boyfriend from the kitchen and went up to his bedroom. He wanted to talk to Dean about his Christmas gift.
“Does it really matter? Anyway I gotta go jerk.”
“Around 7 is ok.” She grabbed her bag and approached where he still stood just inside the door. “Just come hungry, I’ve got a big meal planned.”
“What did this person—“
“Of course it’s alright. If
He was well aware that everyone present was either a part of it did the same line of work that Dean did. What was unexpected was being introduced to each person with their name and role in the industry. Meg and Abaddon were strictly lesbian porn, while Benny and Gadreel were on the link side of things, and Uriel mainly did straight porn but sometimes dabbled in gay porn.
None the wiser the two men raised from their seats, Castiel trailing behind Dean towards the back of the house. Later the man would look back on this moment and remember it as Mary’s thinly veiled attempt at getting the two of them alone. The night was calm here, that’s the first thing he’d noticed as he began living here. It was all hustle and lazy bustle during the day, but once the sun went down, so did everyone else. He was glad for the change of pace this place brought as compared to the other places he’d travelled to. Always cities, where he was just a face in the crowd. He hadn’t settled in a country-like setting since the night he ran for good. Couldn’t take the quiet, and people knowing his name. He didn’t know why he stayed here, could’ve easily stayed the night, and continued on. Here he stood in the backyard of a common mother, and with him was her gorgeous son. He’d spent dinner with these people, probably would be invited back once more. Dean explained all that he planned for his mother’s garden, he spoke with such passion and ease that you would only expose to a friend or a lover. With those grass green eyes, alluring frame, and vibrant sense of being Castiel could easily seeing himself being one or the other.
Dean started at the top of his chest, soft looking hands trailing down his torso, completely bypassing his flaccid cock and rubbing at his spread thighs. He did that twice before he stopped to tweak at his nipples. Goodness Castiel wanted to be those hands to bad. As Dean continued pulling and twisting at the reddened nubs his cock began to lift with interest. Once it was at full attention, one hand left his check to begin tugging at it. This was when the noises begun and Castiel lost all hope at not getting aroused. It felt like Dean was simultaneously watching him and the camera. It was at least 100 degrees in the room now.
“Don’t good—Dean why haven’t you called me all this time? At least shoot me a text to let me know you got home fine.”
“He told me everything I needed for the paper. He had actually forgotten to tell the class about it and thanked me for reminding him. He took notes and promised to send everyone an email about it.”
In his youth he’d always maintained the bad boy persona, it was his façade. The mask he put on so no one could every see who he really was. They moved around a lot after his mom’s death. It all depended on whether John could get a job and keep it with his lovely habits. There was two years in high school when they’re dad had a pretty good job and things were ok. They were only a couple towns over so most of the summer and long breaks off from school he and Sam would spend at Bobby’s. Dean was also driving at the time, his dad had loaned him the Impala since he used his truck for work. He liked his independence. He’d gotten close to one individual in his sophomore year, a gorgeous nerdy kid named Johnathan. Dean was a tough guy sure, but he never took to bullying. He felt it wasn’t right to pick on someone that couldn’t defend themselves for your own sick enjoyment. Johnathan had been a victim of bullying for a long time before Dean had got there, but one day they picked on him at the wrong place wrong time.
Cas: I want that as well
“I suspected as much. As soon as I read this I called his father’s office, but it went to voicemail every time. I even called his secretary’s personal phone and she didn’t answer.” He paused as a single tear left his eye. “I don’t know what to do Dean.” His voice broke into a sob.
“Where’s our precious Castiel?”
“Naked Cas. Need to feel you.” He groaned as Cas attacked his neck.
Charlie was waiting for Dean and Sam to make the call. Dean didn’t know what to make of it. Knee jerk reaction was to tell the witch what she wanted to know so that they can get out of there, never to return. On the other hand, this could turn out bad for them. She looked to be a woman of her word, she would give them nothing if they didn’t tell her what they needed. Obviously she needed to make sure this wasn’t an attack on her or her people. Like son like mother, making sure their own ass is safe and covered regardless of how anyone else fairs.
Someone caught his eye and swayed his attention entirely as they walked into the café. Dean was truly a vision in a deep leather jacket of his own, that looked slightly oversized but still looked amazing on him. He walked right up to the table with a huge grin on his face, clearly clueless that Castiel was about to become a puddle on the floor.
“That’s fine with me. Which brother is it?”
“You’re pointless observations aren’t helping either.”
When Dean returned to his apartment that night he felt numb. So damn numb. He reached for the bottle immediately as he discarded his coat to the floor and kicked off his boots. He knew this was wrong so wrong but not a nerve in his body seemed to care. He was spiraling again. It was dangerous to let the darkness overcome his mind again but he was powerless against it. The coolness of the glass felt good against his lips. He didn’t need a cup, just drank straight from the bottle. The conflicting feeling of the cold liquid warming him up as it made its way down his throat. He didn’t love it but he knew he needed it.
Dean spent the rest of Thanksgiving weekend exactly how he wanted. Alone and drunk. The texts and calls came through from those closest to him, but he just didn’t have it in him to get out of bed, much less to let people know he was still breathing. No one came over, not even Sam, who’d always showed up when Dean was like this. The only other person he expected was Cas, he hadn’t showed at all. He was either giving Dean space or giving himself space. It hurt just as much as his father’s words. Dean truly wanted Castiel to bust down his door and storm inside, stopping him from drowning within himself. But he hadn’t, and since old habits die hard, he wouldn’t ask him to.
“Why is this so damn heavy?” Dean hollered in frustration, whipping his sweaty shirt over his head and tossing it to the ground. “Isn’t this a bunch of tea?”
“Are you sure you’re ok Dean?”
8888888888
*		*		*		*
“I’ve gathered that.”
Dean didn’t feel good about this at all. Sam must’ve been on the same wave if his side-eye was anything to believe. They didn’t have time to consult with the rest of the group. This was a hear and now decision.
“Hey cut the shit Sam!” he tossed.
**************************************************************************************
“It’s fine, “Cas laughed, “What are you doing today?”
He thought Dean would just give a ‘you’re welcome’, but he’d stood there, clearly waiting for something.
“Hey Dean so Christmas is in a couple weeks. Have you started shopping yet?” Sam asked.
Now he wondered, if it was about John, would Dean be upset about the two of them discussing it without him. He really didn’t want the dreary mood to return to the man, but he also didn’t want to lie to him. Lies being told never did any sort of a relationship good, and for now things were amazing between them.
*                             *                             *
*		*		*		*
Balthazar talked a lot. He wasn’t that big on actual phone conversations, but boy could he make a text message feel like one. And he was rapid fast with it as well. After work Dean came over as promised, they were now seated in front of his new TV that Dean helped him buy and hooked up for him. They were watching the first tomb raider movie and while he was quite engrossed in it, the buzzing of his phone kept distracting him. Choosing to ignore it he snuggled into Dean’s side and kept his eyes trained on the screen.
“How’s it feel?”
“I may have made a friend today.”
“Are you drunk?”
“You look stressed.” Dean chuckled at the whole ordeal. “You’ve gotta cut the vegatables with some fruit so they’ll eat it.”
They pulled up to his house and the silence remained. Dean gave him a peck on the forehead and thanked him for coming. He slide out of the car feeling defeated and utterly exhausted, the whirlwind weighed on him so much. But now was not the time.
“Uncle Dean is sleeping. He had a rough day.”
“It’s your turn now Dean. Open mine first.” Gabe said tossing a neatly wrapped gift his way.
*		*		*		*
It felt good like this, a warm coil forming in his guts at the other man’s ministrations. He rubbed his hand along Dean’s chest where it was laid, then sliding down to the hem of his t-shirt. He reached below the garment, needing to feel Dean’s skin under his hand. He reached up grazing over a nipple, just to hear the satisfied hum he knew was coming.
Dean was snapped out of his circle of thoughts looking up to see ocean blue eyes peering into his soul and dark eyebrows knitted in concern. The look on his boyfriend’s face made him feel just a little bad about his internal jealous spiral. But what could he do? He was just a man and Cas was a friggin CATCH if he ever saw one. He reached up and dragged a lazy hand through Cas’ messy hair and plastered a fake grin on his face. He hoped it would do the trick at easing his boyfriend’s worries and it seemed to as Cas slowly smiled back. Dean’s eyes flicked to look over Cas’ shoulder and he saw Balthazar with his own smile on his face, and when their eyes met he winked at Dean. A fresh fire ball of anger welled up in Dean’s chest, but he’d rather die than let it show on his face. He brought his attention back to Cas to calm himself down. His hnad sat at the back of his neck now and he pulled him towards him to whisper in his ear.
“Hey sweetheart.” Dean beamed when Castiel opened the door for him. “What’d you need?”
“You aren’t old, and this is getting weird.” He pushed himself off the counter. “I’m gonna head to work. Get your head out of the gutter.”
“Sam you home?”
“You noticed that?”
“I can’t talk about this out in the open. Can we please go into the reading room first?”
“Sorry Cas I didn’t hear my phone.” He rubbed at the back of his neck. The alcohol was making him sweat.
11:30pm Cas wasn’t coming so he sat in front of his tv and had a beer.
Yeah Castiel was done for.
“It will be at first but it doesn’t have to be. So you know I had that meeting with my agent and we talked about some upcoming projects, some of em I did while you were away and some are for later. We also talked numbers, I thought about it for a bit and we came up with a solution and you’re a big part of that solution.”
“Hello Dean.” He smiled. “How are you?”
The apartment had a pretty nice couch and bedframe already in there so he wouldn’t have to buy those. The goal for the day was to get a mattress, a table set for the kitchen, and a dresser for his room. If there was enough time they would get all the utensils and small appliances for the kitchen. He didn’t want to spend too much money since he got paid on a weekly basis.
Dean’s tone of voice held enough weight that Castiel felt he meant more then just his office hours. He pulled out his assignments and got right to work. A question nagged at his brain that he’d been wanting to ask Dean since the first second he laid eyes on the man. He decided against it for fear of being to comfortable and ultimately inappropriate.
“You touching yourself Cas?”
“Well after school I have to study, then I’m meeting up with Sam and going home cause my father misses me.”
“So you like him?”
“Morning sunshine.” He smiled before returning to his task.
Cas rose his hips to meet Dean and his kisses were growing in desperation. Dean groaned as Cas’ erection ground into his own. Castiel growled low in the back of his throat in response. Dean loved every bit of physical contact he had with the man, but his favorite was whenever they kissed. Every slide of their lips sent a wave of emotion through Dean’s body. He felt a soft hand creep up the hem of his t-shirt and when skin touched skin his resolve began to crumble. He pulled away from Cas sitting on his heels and peeled the shirt off slow, hoping Cas would enjoy the little show he was giving. He knew he was right when he heard Cas inhale sharply.
“Why not?” he shrugged. “I thought you were pretty damn good.”
Mark laughed along with his father as if he actually knew what was going on, and Dean had a heavy blush on his face. He was clearly embarrassed and this whole thing was spiraling way out of his comfort zone at this point. Dean sat Mark down on the floor and shot a disapproving look at his brother. Mark thought it would be a good idea to walk over to Castiel and hold his arms in the air, once again asking to be picked up. He hesitated for only a moment before he thought it was silly not to. It wasn’t his fault that things got awkward.
He made his way to his bathroom and melted into the tub as the warm water hit his back from where he was now seated. He buried his head in his knees as his thoughts began to drift to his ex.
Castiel wasn’t entirely sure what that meant, but if Dean’s face said anything than being a keeper was certainly a good thing. Soon enough it was nearing time to go. It was pretty late so Dean grabbed their jackets, he went behind Castiel to help him put his on. Not that he needed helping, but the gesture was nice and made him feel cozy.
Castiel was led to a pretty nice-looking garage. The doors were open revealing two large bays where a man and a woman were currently working on vehicles. Dean waved animatedly as they walked up. The blonde woman was the first to walk out, he’d recognized her from the Roadhouse. She hugged Dean in greeting before sliding her attention over to Castiel.
“I’m trying to make your mother’s cherry pie.” He sighed.
“it's been enough time that I probably should soon.”
“Darling I know that they’re listening to this conversation. I’ve been around for quite sometime. You’ve got backup, so I’m sure they can agree as we speak.”
One weekend when John went on one of his benders, Dean planned a romantic evening for the both of them. He wanted to go all the way with Johnathan, and this weekend was the perfect time for that. He’d cooked them dinner and cleaned his room, had a nice movie for them to watch and pie to eat. That night was supposed to be perfect. But like most things in Dean’s life it had gone far from perfect and definitely not as planned.
Once he was dismissed from work, he headed back to the Inn, excited about the book he brought before leaving work. His plans were to curl up with a cup of tea and enjoy a night in. Walking back to the Inn he’d recalled the event of this morning. Seeing Dean standing there in all his brightness was shocking, so glad he’d managed to not make a complete fool of himself. It was when he walked in the door and saw Mary’s smiling face that he remembered that he’d been invited to dinner at her home.
“Dean.” He rose from his seat and stood in front of his boyfriend where he stood in front of his desk. He sat a hand on each of his biceps and gave them a firm squeeze. Not enough to hurt of course, but tight enough to help him get his point across. “I said I would do this with you and I meant it.”
“Go ahead and tell her.” He lamented.
With all his papers graded and emails sent Dean sat back in his chair feeling quite successful. He got everything done that needed to be done and damn that felt good. Despite Cas sitting not 5 feet from him he managed to grind away at his desk while Cas did his homework. He turned around to him and was met with eyes full of care and a small smile on his face. He was more grateful to the younger man than he could ever put into words. After the morning’s fiasco he was sure that he would just wallow in bed for the rest of the day, but with his boyfriend there silently giving the strength to carry on he did what he had to do.
This particular shoot was his ‘big break’. Whatever the hell that meant in the porn industry. Castiel had rolled his eyes when Gabriel broke out the theatrics to get him to say yes. Now don’t get him wrong, he was no issues with porn of the people who make it. If that’s the line of work you choose then by all means go forth and do. His issue was solely with his brother and the way he talked about his work in a way to intentionally make him uncomfortable. To get him back Castiel had Gabriel under the guise that he was too proper to watch porn. He’d rather be an active participant that to he so far into the third party grid that he had to watch from a computer screen. Plus viruses. It annoyed the hell out of his brother and that was always the goal.
When he tried to coax Castiel’s mouth open to slide his tongue in, he complied, but only to bit his lip so hard he was sure he’d drawn blood. Dick yelped and drew back immediately, hopping off of Castiel’s lap. He was proud of himself, but only for a moment, Dick pulled back and punched him in the side of his face. His cheek now thrumbed in pain, and the dizziness started up at full force.
Dean came back to him with a small bottle of lube and he shook his head and chuckled at how ridiculous this man was.
Castiel melted into the embrace. He leaned his head back and laid it on Dean’s shoulder. He could stand here forever, just embellished in the warmth that the other man gave him. Dean’s hands wandered up to his chest and neck as his head bent down and trailed gentle kisses on Castiel’s neck.
“Dean we’re just about done. I can handle the rest of these pies so go on and get Castiel. I want the two of you here as the rest of the clan arrives.”
“Dammit Cas you must trust me a lot.” He pulled away from the hug with a chuckle and a fresh batch of tears on his face.
“Dean.” He whined breaking the kiss.
“I have quite a few of your videos bookmarked if what’s what you mean.”
“Can I just punch him please?” Charlie crossed her arms over her chest and her face morphed in anger.
“Damn Cas,” he continued to stroke him while he spoke, “That was one of my first professional shoots.”
“Well that does conflict with what I want in return.”
Dean closed his eyes focusing on the soft touches Cas placed on his chest. He must’ve looked as in distress as he felt if Cas’ worried expression told him anything. His eyebrows were raised and knitted in the center of his forehead and his mouth was shaped into a pouty frown. Dean would think it was quite adorable had this been any other situation. He placed his free hand on Cas’ cheek wishing it would ease his lover’s worries. He didn’t like making Cas feel like this, so he tried all the self-control he could muster.
“Any activities that you can possibly do with another person?” he cackles and heads around the room turn in their direction.
“You know what this means right? We’ll have to add them to the contract, they’ll be able to find us.”
“What you say to me boy?” John’s attention snapped away from Bobby and was fully on Dean. He stared at his son like he was prey ready to be torn apart.
“Hello Dean.” Cas gave him a half smile.
“That’s not what I want!” he shouted. “Sorry, friendship is not something I want with you.”
“Then do us a favor and explain last night. Cause this ain’t gonna work if you’re keeping things in.”
Like he wanted and half expected Cas got up and followed him. He opened the door to the house and almost stepped out until he felt a soft tug on the hem of his worn leather jacket. He turned to see a worried look on Cas’ face. He looked like he would never see Dean again. His frown was too evident and Dean leaned forward to kiss away.
“Is everything ok?”
*                             *                             *                             *
“Father what are you doing?”
“Listen man more power to you.”
Cas went on retelling Dean about what happened. Dean being the gentleman that he was waited until the end of the story to let loose his cackling. He laughed loud and outright until Cas began to squint and pout, which in turn, made him laugh even harder. When Cas reached out and gave him a swift punch to the shoulder, then, and only then did he stop laughing. He tried to hit back, but Cas was a little faster and dodged the playful hand swiping at him. This of course let to Dean tackling him to the bed and tickling him until he was begging him to stop.
“You could—, “
“That’s a good idea Bobby.” Sam half smiled in response.
“It was still pretty rude I’m sorry.”
“I will when you take a shower with me.”
“You must be Dean.” He stretched his hand towards him and Dean took it firmly. “Woah…got quite the grip there. I am Chuck, Castiel and Gabriel’s Father.”
Thanksgiving was only 3 days away and Dean was definitely planning on not showing up. He wanted to have a quiet dinner alone at home or go to Cas’ house. Those were the options he gave himself. Usually his word was final, but when Aunt Ellen said otherwise he knew all his choices were out the window. Now he found himself sitting in Bobby’s living room with his brother in his aunt to have a big discussion concerning the violent elephant that would be in the room.
Dean was now undoing Castiel’s jeans. Once they were open he stopped. Green eyes staring at his blue ones. Dean was asking for permission. Cas nodded enthusiastically and that was all the man needed before he tugged down the pants and boxers all in one swoop. He gave Cas no time to recover before he wrapped his kiss swollen lips around his hot shaft. It was electrifying and overwhelming, but he wanted it no other way. Past partners were predictable, he knew each move was coming before it came. They were monotonous and boring. But Dean, dammit Dean was a loose cannon with eternal ammo. Each movement different from the last. He never licked the same way twice and it was surprising, and surprise was arousing to Castiel. Dean took him all the way to the back of his throat and this pulled a particularly loud moan from Cas. If Dean could smile right now he’d flash him one of his brightest smug smiles, but seeing as how he was heavily occupied he opted for moaning around his arousal.
“It was nice. Work was quite busy.”
And with that they went in their separate vehicles. Dean and Cas rode mainly in silence. Literal silence once Dean was annoyed with Sam’s choice of music and he shut off the radio. They pulled up to Cas’ house and sort of lingered. Dean tried to rack his brain figuring out what to say to the man he basically dry humped on a dancefloor.
They all shared a bout of laughter over this before silence washed over the room. Castiel thought now would be as good a time as any to share the good news.
“While it was sitting right next to you?” Cas looked at the device sitting on the couch. Precisely right next to where Dean had been sitting.
“Yes we should.” Charlie grinned mischievously.
There was so much to do and so little daylight to do it with. He wanted to be inside the safety of his room before the sun went down. He didn’t know this town at all, but he’d learned from experience that with the cover of night there was often danger. Ready to go he walked to a small market that was a 5 minutes from the Inn. As he passed the front desk he noticed the woman that checked him in wasn’t there, replaced by a dark haired woman that looked closer to his age. She didn’t look up, clicking away on her desk, looking as bored as ever.
Dean lowered his head against his better judgement and looked at Cas and the display made just for him. His mouth millimeters from his dick. He moaned just at the sight of it. Cas smiled and closed his eyes, his tongue shooting out licking a line from base to tip. Then he took it all in his mouth again with such friction Dean thought he was going to stroke out right then and there. Cas bobbed relentlessly. Little moans from deep in his throat rang out. Dean shuddered at the vibrations and put his hand to the top of Cas’ head and then he just stopped.
“If you wanted to get laid tonight all you had to do was say so.” The man laughed as he dug into the pie head first.
They just look at each other for a long moment, drinking each other in, before Castiel speaks again.
that.
He holds his head up a little higher. “But I have chosen differently,” he says. “I have chosen to return this planet to those it belongs to, and to stop my father from interfering anymore. You are not my sword, Dean Winchester, and you were never meant to be. I think, perhaps, that I was meant to be yours.”
While the Impala drinks her fill, Jack sits on the edge of a stone wall separating the rest stop from the empty freeway. Dean stares at the boy’s back for a bit as he waits for the numbers on the gauge to stop ticking, and notices Sam doing the exact same thing beside him.
“Yeah,” Dean agrees. “And his power’s coming back. Or, at least, some kind of power.”
They fall into it together. Castiel’s hands come up to grasp at Dean’s forearms, Dean grabs onto Castiel’s bicep with his free hand, and they lock each other into their embrace. It has taken them so long to get here, to this point, and now that they’ve finally tripped and stumbled their way into it neither one of them is about to let go.
. Most of the hunters and Apocalypse refugees have decided to spend some time together at the bunker while they can before shipping out to the next job – it’s rare to get everyone together at once like this, and it’s not like they don’t have the space – he can hear the warm and pleasant chatter filtering up from below through the crack he left in the front door. He didn’t want to ruin the party, but he’s not really feeling up to talking at the moment. It’s enough for him to sit with his back against the concrete wall, legs stretched out in front of him, while the sharp pangs of loneliness do their best to finish him off once and for all. He takes a swig from the beer he was handed downstairs, and slowly exhales against the aching in his chest.
Castiel smiles. “I don’t think all this is exactly kosher, but Jack wanted someone he could trust to look after things once Billie decayed. He wants someone to guide the next generation of Reapers, to make them understand how precious human life really is.”
Sam furrows his eyebrows. “Really? You’re sure.”
Sam’s face turns pink, but he does eventually let Dean go. But only for a moment, before he’s wrapping him up in another bear hug.
Sam smiles, wryly. “I never even got to tell her goodbye.”
“In a while,” he says. “I have responsibilities now, bigger than the two of us.”
“I’m not coming home,” Jack interrupts. Dean gapes at him, but Jack’s smile returns. “In a way, I’m already there,” he says.
Dean nods, taps his finger on the table, and stops. They sit there in silence together for a moment, counting the seconds. You could practically hear the gears turning. Michael finally breaks the silence with a small laugh.
He drops his new white ring into Dean’s waiting hand.
“No,” Michael corrects. “I was meant to fight my brother for dominion over the Earth, because my father said so.”
“Did you hear a single word
Escaping a barrage of hugs and slaps, Dean trails after his brother into the thick of the room. He grabs Bobby in a hug, he kisses Charlie on the head, but he only does so in passing, pushing through to the threshold of the library with shoulders and elbows.
his heart pounds out, pumping him full of adrenaline.
Jack shrugs. “Everywhere.”
“I want you to hold it for me,” he says. “I want you to keep a part of me here while I’m gone, so that you remember that you are loved. That a love for you is now woven into the very fabric of time itself.”
choose to be by your side.”
They fill Michael in pretty fast about Chuck’s book, and though he does lower his eyes with shame and doubt at the thought of bringing about his father’s demise, he eventually agrees to help. To everyone’s disappointment, he can’t get the book open, even though he takes more than a couple holy cracks at it. Jack watches him do this with the utmost concentration, to the point that sweat starts to break out on his brow.
“I’ll look after him,” he promises. Jack and the Winchesters turn to look at him, but Michael is only looking at Chuck. “He’s a rotten jackass, but he’s my father. And now that we’re both mortal… all we have is each other.”
“You were right,” Dean tells him. “Happiness, happiness is just in the saying it, man. It’s about the living, not having. And for so long, for
Castiel frowns. “What?”
“No, no, really. That’s cool, that’s fine. Only waited ten years for this, whatever.”
Dean looks up. Sam’s already staring at him, and his eyes look suspiciously wet. Dean feels a suspicious lump welling up in his throat.
And Cas, Cas is… well, he’s somewhere that Dean can never reach.
Sam scoffs once, smirking a little, but doesn’t engage any further. Dean finally gives up and tosses the rest of the Twinkie onto the ground, like a discarded cigarette. Sam looks like he wants to protest, but he lets it go.
The thought occurs to the brothers at the same time. Dean takes his hands away from his eyes and looks at Sam. Sam stares right back.
Sam’s frown deepens, and he squeezes again. “You ok?”
Dean gapes. “Cas?” he asks.
And through it all, Dean can’t stop smiling.
Jack just smiles. “I think that’s a nice idea,” he says.
In their hole in ground where nothing can hurt them, Dean leans into his brother – his big little brother – and finally allows a tear or two to roll down onto his cheeks.
Sam scoffs, but thankfully drops the issue. “I know what you mean. He’s been a little… twitchy?”
Dean smiles wider. “That’s our boy.”
Dean leans in, and he kisses Castiel for the very first time.
Castiel’s head snaps up. “What do you mean?”
Jack feels a presence. There’s something out there on this empty planet that isn’t him or Dean or Sam. There’s something else, something waiting, and maybe it’s waiting for them.
Castiel nods. “Absolutely. You and Sam both. No one else is qualified to reap your souls.”
Sam shakes his head. “But if we want to see you – ”
Castiel shakes his head. “I… well, I stayed with her for a while. It kept me away from the other things,” he says, and Dean wonders exactly what he means by this. He doesn’t get the chance to ask before a gentle smile breaks out across Castiel’s face. “And then Jack appeared.”
energy now instead of expelling it outward.”
And Dean, well. Dean dares to hope.
“How the fuck did that happen?”
Dean deflates, all the fight and courage leaving his body at once. Sam says something briefly to Eileen, squeezes her shoulders, and then makes his way to his brother. People start to disperse a little now that the euphoria of the reunion is beginning to ebb.
He loses. Gracefully.
Dean finds the archangel after a long day slumped at the kitchen table, panting. He’s drained after another explosive bout of righteous wrath, but he only shakes his head when Dean approaches him.
“Where?”
Dean shakes his head. “Cas, I can’t take this, it’s part of the uniform – ”
Sam clears his throat. Dean asks, “You sure?”
Dean gets up from the table, and Michael frowns after him. Dean doesn’t say a word as he opens the refrigerator, and pulls out two bottles of El Sol.
Castiel stretches out his legs where they rest on the ground. The concrete of the bunker is cold on his back. The sun has very nearly set all the way now, and he’s reluctant to miss its final moments.
Dean hums. From where his head is resting on Castiel’s shoulder, the sound travels all the way through his arm down to his elbow; Castiel can feel the hearty thrum of it.
He shrugs. “At least, that’s how it was explained to me.”
Castiel looks down, hiding his smile. He holds his hands out to his sides and then drops them against his thighs. “I’m trying to be.”
“Yeah,” Dean muses. “Like a God.”
Jack nods. “Yep. I’m sure.”
“And I meant it.”
Sam reaches him and all Dean can say is, “I don’t get it.” He shakes his head and, in a tone more heartbroken than he’s comfortable admitting to, adds, “He said ‘everyone.’”
“I have tried every spell in every language that I know,” Michael says, weakly and staring at the wood grain. “I have shot more firepower at that book than I’ve ever used at one time before.” A thought must occur to him then, because suddenly his eyes go cold and distant. “Maybe I’m fading, too. Maybe I’m not strong enough anymore.”
“But who’s going to keep an eye on you?” Dean asks then. “You can barely remember to tie your damn shoelaces without someone reminding you.”
Dean rolls his eyes. He knocks over the glass bottle closest to him on the library table and huffs. “I’m fine. Jack’s not.”
But there’s no reunion for him.
Dean blinks, taken aback. Castiel’s tone is suddenly firm, harsh, little of his former sweetness remaining. Dean’s heart has revived itself by now and is tentatively looking ahead to this conversation’s inevitable conclusion:
Sam’s face crumbles, and all he can think to do is to reach out and squeeze Dean’s shoulder. He’s got his puppy dog eyes on, the kind that Dean’s seen him use on old widows and scared children when they go hunting. The kind of eyes that say,
He nods over his shoulder. “Where do you think he’s taking us?” Dean asks.
“Horse shit,” Dean coughs.
he thinks.
Dean smiles, tucking his chin down to his chest in the hopes that Castiel won’t see it. (He does.) “Well, I guess somebody’s gotta keep an eye on Jack, right?”
Sam turns to him, eyebrows raised incredulously.
Castiel nods. “You’ve still got the Black Key, yes? My door is always open to you, Dean.”
Tears are collecting in earnest now along the edges of Castiel’s eyes, and they threaten to spill over any second. “What are you saying?” he asks.
“Grass,” Dean finishes. “And then some big planters outside that diner,” he adds. “Yeah, I saw ‘em.”
“When,” he says, more than asks.
Dean narrows his eyes, trying to understand. “So when you and Billie passed into the Empty at the same time – ”
He drifts for a while. He can feel his body slowly get colder as the sun descends further in the sky, casting long purple shadows along the ground. He flexes the fingers of his right hand, wrapped around his beer bottle, against the chill. His joints aren’t what they used to be, he thinks, wincing a little as they protest against swelling.
Castiel sits up a little straighter. “Hold out your hand,” he commands.
Sam’s slight smile widens to a grin, something maniacal lurking on the edge of it. “We’d have to power Jack up a bit first to give him a fighting chance.”
“I don’t stop to look around enough, I guess,” he says. “I mean, I spend so much time thinking about saving the world, but I never really enjoy it, you know? And the world’s – the world’s kind of pretty. You really notice it when there’s nothing else to look at.”
Castiel might be a Primordial Entity now, but Dean is still very much a human. They part with a gasp, and Castiel’s eyes light up when they open again. Dean’s never seen such an open expression of joy or disbelief on his face before. The sight this close makes him absolutely giddy, makes him want to start laughing and never stop again.
Castiel shoves him, Dean shoves him back. The clouds bleed purple across the darkening sky.
“Dude,” Dean grumbles. “I’m still half drunk and even I get what’s going on here.”
Dean thinks to himself, despondently.
“If I could have everyone’s attention?!” He draws all the eyes to himself. Dean’s the most beautiful. “Twelve years ago I pulled this stubborn man out of hell and I’ve spent every day after that admiring his every move.” He steps into Dean’s space. “We’ve been through every imaginable thing and more. Through it all, we’ve always had one another and I know we always will.” Dean’s eyes widen as he realizes where this is going. He starts to tear up as his eyes search Cas’. “Dean Winchester, will you marry me?” He kneels down and squints up at Dean.
“You do realize you’re human now?”
He sighs. “Fine, but I'm not telling you my middle name. First name is Castiel.” He holds his hand out for Dean to grab, he does. Instantly he feels a spark with a shift in the air, probably the storm.
“Mine.” His smile can't get any bigger.
They stand in silence in one another’s embrace for a while. Enjoying the company of one another. Cas never knew he could have this and he’s grateful everyday that he can. They kiss before parting. Until Cas leaves they choose out more paint colors for the rooms.
“I love you too.”
After they’d gotten Cas back from the empty, it had taken them a few weeks before they had worked everything out. Cas was too afraid to bring up the conversation. He almost wanted to pretend that he’d never said anything for a moment. After a while of that Dean had ambushed him in the kitchen and confessed that the feelings are mutual and how much he’s wanted Cas. He’d later confessed he was trying to at least match how profound Cas had put it. He’d eventually given up in favor of not losing his chance, like he had done many times over the years. They have been together ever since.
“I, unlike most people, don't really care for finding my soulmate. Regardless of shared middle names, nothing actually determines we should be together.” He says raising his eyebrow. “So I'm not interested in you only introducing yourself only because you want to find your soulmate.”
“I got this.” he whispers the words as he passes Sam. Dean takes a deep breath, preparing himself for, whatever Cas is going to say. He doesn't say anything at all but rather holds Dean's face in his hands and kisses him, long and slow. He hasn't been kissed this way in a long time, too long. The kiss is breathtaking and like coming up for air out of the water at the same time. He takes it in as much as he can without fainting. Cas pulls away and rests his forehead on Dean's. “I could tell you were worrying and I wanted you to know that I was going to kiss you, and I wanted to.” Sam coughs from behind Cas.
“Well odds are I'd fall in love with him, I never said I wouldn't be with my soulmate just, that I'm not looking and I'd rather fall in love with someone for who they are. Not because we're cosmically chosen to be together.”
“As in.” He replies.
“Cas, you don’t have if you don’t want to, have sex that is.”
“What?!” She smacks his shoulder. “Why not?”
“I was thinking of doing a supply run. Wanna join? It’ll go so much faster with my big strong boyfriend.”
“Dude yes.”
The small gift bag sits on the edge of the bed where he’d left it. Dean finally lets go of Cas’ hand for the first time since the proposal to open the gift. He pulls out the matching lingerie sets for the two of them.
They slide into the car and Dean starts the engine. “Her purr is the best part.” He says with a side glance to Cas. Cas only let's the start of a smile show. Yeah Dean is doomed. Maybe he doesn't need a soulmate.
“Miss me today?”
“I like your car, very vintage, well taken care of, and sleek but tough shape to it.” Dean grins at that. Castiel smiles kindly back when he notices.
“I love you so much.”
He was waiting in a diner for Mary and Sam to show. He neglected to tell Dean that Sam was coming too, he hadn’t wanted him to get suspicious, if he wasn’t already. They both walked in laughing at something Mary had said. They saw Cas already sitting with coffee ordered for the three. They sit at the table with him.
“You just want to know what your present is, don’t you?”
“What do you think I should do?”
After a few moments of lying in bed together Dean bursts out laughing.
Today’s the day, Dean’s birthday. And Cas has been awake for the past hour, watching Dean sleep. His nerves were keeping him from falling back to sleep. So he opted to watch the rise and fall of his lover’s chest. Dean began to stir and wake up. He smiled up at Cas, still sleepy. Cas smiles brightly at his partner. His smile is quickly returned.
“I’m close, Cas.”
“Of course you did.” Dean giggles. “You should let me return the favor.”
“Let me see the ring!” He pulls it out and hands it to her. She carefully takes it from him. “It’s perfect Cas.”
Dean used to hate when Cas would watch him sleep but over the years the more times he caught him doing it, the less he cared. After calmly waking up he knew Cas was watching him. He couldn't see him but he just knew. He smiled to himself briefly.
“You know what would be better than me fucking you?”
“Not yet, not until tonight.”
“You're welcome, Dean.” when Dean finally meets Cas’ eyes again they're filled with fondness. He is pretty sure Cas got closer, undetected because he also didn't feel the bed move. Maybe Dean was the one who got closer. It doesn't matter who got closer because all he can think about is that Cas’ leg is pushed against his own. The small amount of contact sends shivers up his spine. They gaze into one another's eyes without saying anything. Dean shifts to face Cas easier and rests his hand on Cas’ knee for better leverage as he does it. Once it's there he can't get himself to remove it. Cas reaches up and holds Dean's face in his palm. This level of intimacy is overwhelming and relaxing at the same time. Dean licks his lips and Cas’ eyes focus on the movement for a second before locking them on Dean’s.  Cas leans in slowly and ever so slightly. Dean finds himself tilting his head up and moving closer to Cas’ movement. A knock sounds and pulls them out of it.
"W-werewolfs. You two can kiss later.” Dean smiles and kisses Cas again, for good luck. He then pulls away and can see Cas’ bright grin. Sam walks toward the garage.
He starts to trail kisses down Dean’s body, making his way down, taking his time. Dean squirms under the affection. Cas looks up at him, locking his eyes.
“Cas, you need to, now.”
“What are your plans for today?” Cas asks.
“Hello Dean.” His feel voice savors Dean's name. “You look wonderful.”
“Absolutely not.” Cas smiles fondly at the man in front of him.
Thirty minutes later Dean finds himself panicking in the kitchen. He doesn't want to go to the garage and for it to be awkward around Cas. He paces stressfully across the floor. The panic hadn't really kicked in until he was brushing his teeth and it hit him, really hit him. They almost kissed, mouth on mouth, kissed. Sam wandered into the kitchen a few minutes into his pacing.
The blade reflected off of the sun, now much lower in the sky. Cas couldn’t get enough leverage for a punch, couldn’t think, his head ached too much. He closed his eyes, thought of home, thought of Claire, thought of Dean. Anything but the monster in front of him.
“Meg is not my girlfriend,” Cas repeated.
Cas didn’t know what he expected on the other side of the door. An army of Croats, or perhaps Richard Roman himself sitting atop a crown of skulls. What he saw were neat rows of barrels, complete with the toxic symbol. Easy. Stupid. And then an earsplitting alarm pierced the air. Looking to his left and right, he saw Croats begin to shuffle out from the rotting corn fields, beelining towards the noise.
Naomi gifted Castiel and Dean matching collared shirts, with their initials hand stitched on the cuffs. She gave Sam his first tie. On Christmas morning, after a three hour service, John pulled out a big model train set. Dean expected to hate it, he wasn’t born in the fucking 50s, but it was fun to watch Cas concentrate so hard on putting the pieces together, and Sam loved the engineering of it, even though he said he was too old to play conductor. That night, after a dry turkey dinner, Naomi quietly got up, and put the Nintendo Switch back by the TV.
needed to protect each other, all needed to sacrifice. What good was good Christian values if it didn’t teach you how to put the whole over yourself?
“We saved you,” Charlie said sharply from the front.
By the time they reached the freeway, Dean’s breathing and hearing almost returned to normal. Dodging around abandoned cars on the local streets was a nightmare, but at some point the army must have come in and cleared some of the highway wreckage, because it was slightly better getting out of Paolo Alto.
“Fuck, Cas, you’re so hot,” Dean groaned, following Cas over the edge, his own release mixing on Cas’s stomach.
“And it’s in this man whom we’ve put our trust?” Cas turned to look over at Dean.
“We should be more worried about this thing collapsing on us,” Dean tossed over his shoulder, hoping he sounded cool. The barn had a few rusty tools, and the air carried the memory of cow manure, but there was a solid ladder leading to a lofted area.
“Night Cas.”
Despite his better judgement, Dean allowed Castiel blow off training for the rest of the day. He let the kid follow him around for the rest of the day, checking on residents, inspecting the border, working on some construction projects. He even let Cas sit in on his advisor meeting for that day.
“Do you really want me to stop,” Dean asked looking at Cas’s hard cock, standing proud against his stomach.
Dean had to hand it to him, every time he was thrown down, he just scrambled back up, eager for more. Still, Sam had a point, the boy would have to learn how to fight, actually fight, soon. God forbid if any Roamers tried getting into camp before he was ready. At first they tried to welcome the Roamers in, the more humans the better. But Dean found that those who hadn’t hunkered down came to love that lifestyle, and didn’t care who they had to hurt to keep it.
“She is not my girlfriend,” Castiel interjected, glancing at an uncharacteristically shy Meg.
“What’s the matter Clarence? I just want to get friendly,” Meg purred.
About a month later, some Asian kid was sitting next to him, calc textbook cracked open.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Do you think we can make it back around?” Dean asked, and Cas tried to ignore the fear in his voice.
“Fine. What we’re cooking up back there should prevent Croat-ness, if we get all of our ingredients.”
“Anytime, buddy,” Dean murmured, before awkwardly extracting himself from the embrace.
“It’s an old projector that the club was ordered to throw away. I remember you quite enjoyed Charlie’s, I thought we could surreptitiously install it within our room,” Cas explained, carefully depositing the bundle in the trunk.
“And, if my opinion counts for anything, I think you’d make a wonderful father Dean,” Cas said.
Somehow, they had carved up their own little piece of sanity down in Texas. Ash, that psycho genius, had actually managed to make a working Croat vaccine. After innoculating everyone in camp, younger folks made diplomatic trips to other survivor camps to give them the vaccine too. Those that had been strong enough to weather attacks from violent Roamers had grown quite robust, and some even had the capabilities to replicate the vaccine on their own, or people who knew how to at least. Last Dean had heard, immunity was spreading, and though no one wanted to test it, some predicted that the next generation born might have immunity too. Dean wasn’t smart enough to guess what would happen in the future anymore, he just wanted to focus on the right-here, right-now. Which made Cas’s question complicated.
“I know I know, but-”
“I know, it’s just, yesterday it was a question and today it’s a plan,” Dean said.
Dean sat down next to Cas, “And what is the ‘context of your relationship?’”
A stillness hung in the air, as Castiel worked up the nerve to ask Charlie the question that had been burning him for weeks.
Dean stared out at the darkness beyond the gates. The nearest city was a distant bright spot on the horizon. Dean figured the lights would stay on until the power plants ran out of juice. He didn’t know what he would tell Sammy. He figured it was kinder to let Sam think his father had died fighting rather than let the Croats take him. If Dean could do one last thing for John Winchester, it would be to save his memory.
Cas seemed to mull over the nickname, and Dean hoped he’d drop the whole thing, but Dean had never been the lucky kind.
“One of the newer couples to our congregation. Simon something. They just moved in on the west end of town. Why?” Naomi said, while glaring at the remaining onlookers, as if daring them to comment.
He and Dean made quick eye contact before rushing into the factory, and rolling out the first barrels they could see backwards to Ellen and Bobby, who pushed them toward the ramp, where Ash was loading them up. They managed to load forty barrels when the first Croats reached them.
Cas nodded, looking hesitantly at Dean, who was still gawking at the envelope.
“Dean, I told you that Meg and I are not having sex,” Cas said in a rush.
“What’s up buddy?” Dean asked, looking up from his homework.
“Oh.”
Castiel felt an odd flurry of emotion, and before he could stop himself he asked, “And have you succeeded in your New Year's Resolution?”
Cas watched as the blonde turned her head to look at Charlie, Sam, and Dean in succession. She exhaled slowly.
Cas hesitantly tugged on the man’s arm, suddenly feeling awkward despite his important purpose. Sam turned, his face annoyed, before he saw the fear etched into the teen’s face. Sam made his excuses to Madison, and made his way to where Castiel had positioned himself at the edge of the fire.
“What’s going on?” Cas asked, hesitantly walking his bike up.
“Never.”
“Did he f-” Jess started, before Claire cut her off.
“He was always a string bean, but I used to be the tall brother. Always had his nose in a book, even on hunts, he was our fact guy,” Dean said.
“It’s clear that all this activity you’ve been engaged in has taken a toll on you,” Naomi sighed, pinching the bridge of her nose, “Your behavior today was unacceptable.”
It all started when John got sober. After his third stint in rehab, he decided to get serious about recovery before he wrapped himself around a pole. Again. And there Naomi was, volunteering to help the lost souls of Pontiac, Illinois get back on their feet, and into Jesus’s loving bosom. John fell for the schtick, hook, line, and sinker, and since his dad decided to get all horny for Jesus, now Dean had to wear a monkey suit and sit in a hot church every fucking Sunday. And there was a fucking quiz in the car. AND the car wasn’t the Impala-- Naomi made John put Baby in a goddamn garage, and now John Winchester drove a fucking mini van. But that wasn’t even the worst part.
“We’ll sleep better this way,” Dean said, already drifting off, ignoring the other boy’s silent cries.
“Tell Clarence I’ll see him around,” Meg said, getting into a car with some guy covered in tats.
Dean scrambled into the bathroom, tossing his cum stained shirt into the hamper on his way. Dean hopped in the shower, hoping to scrub away Cas’s wide eyed stare.
But he showed the babies pictures of animals, taught them how to read and write, even multiply. When the world came back, these kids would know how to rule it, if Cas had anything to do with it.
Naomi’s eyebrow twitched.
They were lying in bed, in those early morning moments where Cas pretended to still be sleeping, because the moment he spoke, broke the illusion of indifference between them, Dean always left for his own bed. And now Dean was talking to him, talking about the very real problem between them.
The genial man smiled, “It’s good to see Charlie with some friends, things have been so hard after her mother’s surgery,” busying himself with the dishes.
Dean saw the gears turning in Sam’s head, and he felt his stomach churn.
Dean’s head swam. It was all so nauseatingly simple.
“One of us should keep watch for Dad,” Sam said, scratching his head.
“Welcome to the Bunker.”
“You know what, I don’t care, just get me out of here,” Meg said, grabbing Castiel’s hand and dragging him back towards the Impala, letting herself into the backseat.
“Well she’s got friends!” Dean shouted, as the already unmistakable shuffle of Croats got louder.
“Dean, do you think it is possible that I entered a romantic relationship without my own knowledge?”
If Cas had been tense before, he was a block of ice now. Dean bit his tongue, to keep from apologizing. As much as the boy’s pain hurt him, he knew this was the only sane option.
Naomi hums, “I will consider it.”
“Be quiet Castiel.”
“Yes, she’s always been like this,” Castiel said.
“Now we put them out of their misery,” Dean said, leaning down with his knife. Cas looked away, but helped Dean drag the deer up into the back of the truck. Cas managed to make a mess of himself, but Dean stayed clean, somehow.
Dean sighed, and carried himself over to Cas’s bed.
Cas and Claire trudged down to the river in relative silence, ignoring the stares from the other Croat-Ville residents.
Cas waited for Dean to do something. He’d been fantasizing about this moment for so long, yet Dean seemed as lost as he felt. Fantasy Dean always picked Cas up and manhandled him onto the bed. He’d push his face into the mattress and take what he wanted until Cass thighs ached, until his throat was sore, until he was crying for more. Fantasy Dean wanted. The Dean in front of him was holding himself so rigidly Cas was afraid he’d burst a blood vessel.
“We can’t bring her home,” Dean and Cas said in unison.
“You’ve got to be shitting me,” Dean growled, but soon began charging forward, mowing down the Croats between them and the plane.
Castiel could hear the confusing explosion of sounds surrounding him, but couldn’t open his eyes. His left leg was stiff, and felt numb, but that was preferable to how the rest of his body felt. His limbs screamed, his face felt sticky, and his mouth filled with the metallic tang of blood. His body had been forced upright, and a rigid metal surface cut into his shoulder blades. Without warning, the voices cut off, followed by a sharp slap to his face. His eyes snapped open, and he was face to face with a pale, angry brunette.
“You need to learn to relax, plus it’s legal in this state,” Dean said, before finally lighting up, and quickly sucking in, making sure it burned evenly.
“Something about how accurately capturing light is essential,” Dean said, leaning against the wall, just where the sun filtering in from a missing patch in the ceiling ensconced him in an ethereal glow.
“Hey, can you help me bring out dessert?” Dean asked, pushing away from the table.
“I don’t need a broken boy,” he heard the man say to some wretch beside him at some point after he came to. Suddenly Cas was jerked up, the metal post cutting cruelly into his back, before his bonds were cut. He couldn’t see his new captor, but he could hear their laugh, long and joyless, as Castiel struggled to his feet, only to crumple when he put pressure on his left leg.
“So I have you all to myself? Say it Cas,” Dean held down Cas’s hips, as he vainly tried to push himself deeper into Dean’s mouth.
“Whatever, Dean.”
“So your mom can make your life hell as long as things are peachy after you die?” Dean asked sardonically.
By the time Dean pulled off the road, the two had fallen into an easy silence after a dismal game of eye spy. (“I spy with my little eye-” “Dirt?” “Yeah, dirt,”).
Dean contemplated the old tape-down-the-middle to divide the territory, but a glance at the boy across from him slightly quelled that impulse. Castiel didn’t even seem interested in being in his own part of the room, let alone Dean’s. He didn’t seem interested in anything that wasn’t Jesus or being Mommy’s Perfect Son.
“Here I am!” Dean said, accepting a cup from her.
“No matter what happens, whoever is left, we regroup at camp,” Dean said, before they loaded up into cars.
The man was talking again, but Cas found it difficult to focus on his voice. His head was swimming. It was too loud, too bright, the noon heat beating down on the clearing. He passed out.
They stumbled around in their Sunday best for a song or two, before the exercise grew boring. They sat up on Baby’s hood instead, staring at the stars. Dean glanced at Cas, every emotion on the tip of his tongue, but he swallowed it.
After checking the perimeter fence for any breaks, together Sam and Dean pulled the front gate closed, and padlocked it.
Hours later, the RV let out three honks, and Dean slowly pulled over. The afternoon sun was slowly reddening, its rays gently bleeding on the horizon. Despite the tension of the morning, Castiel was surprised how soon things could return to whatever could be considered normal between him and Dean. They talked about nothing for the hours they spent driving, both too hesitant to bring up something heavy, and Cas even managed to eke a laugh out of Dean, albeit only after he messed up the punchline to one of Claire’s old jokes.
“Thank you, Dean,” Cas turned to him, a grin breaking his usual somber demeanor.
“Ash, this is Castiel. Cas, Ash.”
“Yes, Dean. I would appreciate it if you tried not to antagonize her this morning, I am hoping to capitalize on her amenable holiday mood.”
By July, Dean was cooking most of the family meals, with Cas as sous chef.
And Sam stopped asking them to search for Dad.
“Why can’t you work off a photo again?” Charlie asked, lying back in the hay bale of the abandoned barn.
One hand on the pistol in his belt, Dean set about undoing the many latches on the cabin, and then raised up his shoulder, ready to burst in, before reconsidering. He sharply knocked on the door, and heard the boy start towards the noise. The door slowly opened, and Dean wasn't fully prepared for the ice blue eyes boring into him. He was taller than he remembered, or maybe he was just standing up straight instead of cowering beneath their guns. Same difference.
“Hurry up Dean!” Sam shouted over his shoulder as Dean jiggled the handle.
----------------
Dean jerked back, his features almost indecipherable in the candle light.
“Oh. Good for them,” Dean said, before making his way over to Claire’s bed.
“Took you long enough,” Claire uncrossed her arms to pick up the few belongings she and Castiel had amassed, carrying them towards the cabin.
“Sorry, I was unaware that you were having a private moment,” Cas said, averting his eyes.
“Well, not everyone has the pleasure of living with you,” Cas said.
The small caravan pulled up outside the building, forming a tight perimeter around the main entrance. Dean got out first, and quickly signaled the others to fall in a diamond configuration.
“You know I couldn’t stay, Cas,” Dean felt a whine of his own creep into his voice, even taking his eyes off the road to plead.
Castiel looked to Dean with wide eyes, begging for help that he couldn’t give, before looking back to the floor.
Cas opted to walk himself home from Charlie’s after Dean dropped them off.
Summer crept upon them, the sun bringing out the loveliness of Dean’s freckles, though Castiel knew enough to not share the remark with the other boy. Lately, he’d found Dean’s face to be rather distracting. For his final art project, he asked Dean and Charlie to sit for a water-color portrait.
Cas felt his heart drop as he watched Dean flirt back, getting up and leaning over her to show her how to clean off the body. Cas wanted to run, but he felt rooted to the spot, just stuck watching Dean smile easily.
“How is this?” Dean asked.
Castiel followed Dean out after only hurriedly slipping on his boots, one of the few advantages of sleeping in yesterday’s clothes.  He stumbled down the driftwood steps, and followed Dean to the camp center, from which he fled not 12 hours ago in dismay. Dean strolled to the makeshift PA in the center of camp, and let out four short air horn blasts in rapid succession. Four meant non-emergency camp meeting, three meant medical emergency, usually a birth, two to announce Roamers, and one long blast for Croats.
“I don’t care,” Cas decided, urging Dean’s wrist towards him.
"In the old radio station, the 'KROQ' building," Castiel managed to warble out, his eyes glued to the 50 foot high fences that were approaching quickly.
Dean shrugged, a vacant look on his face, fingering the envelope.
Dean hesitated for a moment, then hugging Cas back, before going off to solve the next crisis.
it over his shoulder as he steadied his gun with the other. He rolled himself up into a crouch, his eyes glued to the hinge of their hideout.
“Your psycho mom cut off the power to our room,” Dean said.
"And one by one, this godforsaken life has taken your family, the only tether you have in this godforsaken world."
“I resolve to be a better friend,” Cas muttered.
It had taken Dean nine months to gather enough wood on varying scouting trips to make a place hospitable enough to house the Novaks. In the interim, Castiel had woven himself into the very fabric of camp life. Despite his shortcomings as a fighter, something Dean tried to work with him on every day, Cas still tried to help out in every way imaginable. He split wood with Benny, collected resources with Chuck, told stories with Kevin, even worked his way into a probationary position on Dean’s advisory council. Truth be told, Dean would rather listen to Cas’s advice over the indecisive Chuck anyday. If the people of their little settlement were unhappy that they were governed in part by someone who was about to turn 17, well, they kept their mouths shut about it.
“My what?” Dean asked.
The team went back to harassing Victor for pictures of his new girlfriend, letting Dean freak out in peace.
“Bobby’s her crazy survivalist husband, and Jo is her crazy marksman daughter,” Dean stage whispered, as Ash’s eyes narrowed.
“Maybe, we’ll know for sure soon-”
“Don’t move,” she warned.
“Dad, it’s not what it looks like,” Dean pleaded, before rolling off the bed to avoid his swing.
On the morning of his 17th  birthday, Dean woke up to a familiar rumble outside. Excitement and terror ran through him. Was Dad taking off? Did he expect Sam and Dean to come? Dean glanced anxiously at Cas, who wasn’t so attuned to the sound of the Impala that he could sleep through its thunder. How would he say goodbye? How could he?
“You’re 18, you could open a bank account. I don’t have one, but we could go down to the bank and make one. He’d never have to know,” Cas said, nuzzling in closer. Dean ran an absent hand through the Cas’s hair, reveling in the contented sigh.
Dean agreed to take Castiel to Meg’s after tryouts, all somberness from this morning apparently forgotten in the euphoria of the sports contest.
“I lied. And I don’t feel like dying a virgin tomorrow.”
“Skip to the part we can understand,” Dean cut Ash off, his hand still firmly on Cas’s back.
“Ah, so she said she’d get you off, help you see the real light,” Dean said.
Dean’s eyes grew wide, looking at Cas’s entrance.
After some frantic rubbing against his threadbare pillow, Cas drifted off to sleep.
“I’m sure it will not. I don’t know if it is a wise decision for you to attend college this fall. As you seem so exhausted,” Naomi said.
Cas waited, bouncing on the balls of his feet outside the store until he heard the roar of the Impala around the bend. Cas remembers Dean’s fear on the morning of his 17th, when he heard that same dull roar, but for Cas the sound would always bring him peace. Cas let himself in the car, sliding as close to Dean as he dared. They never touched each other outside of their room or the barn, but Cas was desperate to kiss Dean as he watched his lazy grin.
Cas felt a chill go down his spine at that voice. It held the same perverted exuberance of the woman next to him. While both had possibly murderous intentions, it appeared as if the man in front of him would hesitate less to slice his throat. Though both seemed the type to play with their food. Blood was pooling in his ear canal, making him partially deaf from the left side. His left eye was also slowly swelling up, helping Cas figure out that it had only been a short time since the crash.
“That's terrible.” Sympathy fills his blue eyes.
“The second is just a small thing. It’s on our bed. Let’s go open it.”
“I was thinking that for dinner tonight we could grab something to eat in the car.”
“I could join you and Charlie.”
“Okay.”
“The feeling is mutual.” Dean beams at that.
“What’s that?”
“I have to agree with Sam, he’d rather it be a reminder of you than just cool.”
He pulls off Dean’s boxers in haste. He relishes in the sight of him. He kisses the head of his cock. Dean giggles at the gesture. Cas licks the underside of it. Dean’s breath hitches at the contact. He’s fully hard at this point. Cas carefully swirls his tongue around the tip a few times, taking pleasure in the noises Dean makes every time he does it. He kisses the head again before taking him as far as he can in his mouth. Dean moans loudly as Cas lowers his mouth down. He sucks lightly before moving his head in a slow rhythm. He grabs the base before speeding up his pace. He’s already hard in his sweatpants, making a little hard to focus. He keeps up the fast pace, inciting incoherent noises and moans from Dean.
“I love you, I can’t wait to spend the rest of my life with you.”
“No, my last relationship ended with him wanting a threesome and meeting his soulmate on tinder trying to find a third party. I decided dating in this world, is a bad idea.”
“No no no, lost in thought.” He reassures.
“I have an early present for you.”
“Correct, we are bad at that.”
“Hmm he is very scared of commitment maybe it has to do with that.”
“I still have two more presents.”
“Wait, so you’re not like asexual?”
“I love you.” Dean lets the words fall out.
“Nah, you're good. Like I said got used to it, and there is something comforting about it.” Cas nodded as if thinking. “You never answered my question. What is interesting about watching me sleep?” Cas glances at Dean before speaking.
“The one day I decide to walk, a blizzard hits.”
“Yeah as long as you take mine in return.” So they exchange said numbers and talk about their jobs for the last twenty minutes they're forced to stay in the library. Time passes too quickly.
'Sounds good, see you in ten.’ He replied to Dean's message almost instantly.
Cas does keep going, driving them both insane with his slow pace. He asks Dean with a nod and gets one in return. He speeds up the pace moving quicker and becoming more erratic, Dean’s noises affecting his every movement. His own ns fill the room, both of their voices letting out matching pleasure filled noises. He wraps his hand around Dean’s cock and starts moving in rhythm with his thrusts. Dean is yelling out Cas’ name as he hits his prostate. Cas continues to hit it, Dean’s close he can feel it, he is too. He slows down, causing Dean to pant desperately. He places a kiss on Dean’s lips as he speeds up again, hitting his prostate once again. Sending Dean over the edge. He yells into Cas’ mouth and bites down on his bottom lip. He tightens around Cas, making him come inside of him.
“I have a car.” Cas' cuts him off mid sentence.
“Thanks Cas.”
“Castiel Novak.” He repeats more for himself.
It was almost Dean’s birthday and they still hadn’t done anything sexual past intense making out. At first he had chalked it up to Dean not being ready to be sexually intimate with another man. You can’t exactly run from childhood trauma. Though, he thought about Benny and the relationship he and Dean had. And After these past few months it became obvious to Cas that Dean wanted him bad. It was in the way Dean kisses him when things start getting heated. The fact that Cas had overheard him pleasuring himself thinking of Cas, if him moaning his name was anything to go by. At this point Cas was at a loss for why Dean hadn’t tried at all to become sexual with him. He had briefly thought that he wasn’t sexually attracted to him but that was also not possible with the evidence he had. He has come up with a plan to figure it all out.
Cas ambushed him with a hug from behind, arms around his waist. Dean turned around in the hold, placing a kiss on his lips. Cas deepened the kiss. He pushed Dean up against the table. Dean laughed into the contact.
“What?” His voice hoarse.
“Yeah?!” Dean's voice sounds wrecked and nothing even happened. Was something going to happen? “Guys I think I found a case. Three dead in Kissimmee Florida, hearts missing. They were ruled out as animal killing. My money is on werewolf.” Sam says through the door.
“I hear that. Wait, him?”
"Son of a bitch.”
“Why wait though?”
“Close to three hours.” he shrugged as he said it. Dean pursed his lips and nodded.
He grabs the lube off the nightstand where he’d put it earlier for convenience. He opens the bottle and puts some on his hand. He looks into Dean’s eyes, asking wordlessly, he frantically nods in return. Cas starts to work open his opening.
“My middle name isn't Jimmy, it's James. Jimmy is just a nickname. I didn't know if you were mine at first but now I'm positive you are.” The way he casually says mine has Dean's head spinning and his stomach doing somersaults.
“Ah,” Deal clicks his tongue “Jimmy.” Cas’ eyes widen when he realizes what the smug look on Dean's face is for. He sighs in defeat and begins to leave the car again.
“Dean James Winchester, and you are?”
At the cafe Dean spots Cas at a corner booth wearing a maroon sweater that brings out his eyes with navy jeans. His hair is just as messy as it was windblown. Dean thinks the guy likes it that way or just doesn't care. He approaches Cas with a nervous flutter of his stomach. When Cas spots him his face gets this fond look one might get when looking at a kitten. And holy shit he want to see that look on Cas more. “Hey!”
“Offer still stands.”
“I think he’s hesitant because it’s me.”
“I want to have sex with you. I enjoyed what we just did.”
“So, Cas, what’s this spontaneous lunch about?” Sam cautiously asks.
Dean is breathless as he speaks. Cas goes down as far as he can, deepthroating Dean. He swallows around him pushing Dean over the edge. He moans loudly as he comes down Cas’ throat. Cas swallows all of it. After a second he pulls off. Dean is still panting when he joins him at the top of the bed.
“Works for me, was there something else you wanted to talk about? You have that look on your face.”
“Where the hell did you learn how to do that?”
“You really do, just like cowboys.”
“What do you mean?”
“Yes I'm gay and 'Jimmy’ isn't a common female name.” He deadpans while glaring at Dean.
“Kissing you never gets old.”
“She wanted to talk to me alone.”
“As long as you're not asking me out.”
“That doesn’t sound like Dean, he’s all about sex.”
Jack had brought back all their friends they’d lost to all of Chuck’s plans, along with Mary. Cas planned to talk to her and Sam about something important today. This universe’s Charlie and Bobby among those back. He went through his morning routine with Dean. They both currently sat watching T.V. while drinking coffee and eating bacon and eggs.
“When are you going to ask?” She asks, invested.
“She’s my friend too, I wonder why she doesn’t want me there.”
“It’s about her present for you.”
“I'll make coffee.” Cas beats him to words and leaves before Dean can get a word out. Maybe Cas regrets getting that intimate with Dean? Did he pressure Cas into acting that way? Did Cas only lean in because Dean wanted him to?
“How long you been in here?” he asked while sitting up and facing Cas. Cas glanced at the alarm clock and squinted for a second.
“Yes and I’m a human that wants to have sex with this human.” He says with a finger on Dean’s chest.
“Yes way.”
“Not even with someone as charming as I?” He says in mock offense.
“Oh, I am keeping you.” Cas scoffs a laugh.
“You fucking me.” His smile is challenging.
“Offer still stands.” He says more sure this time.
“I decided to walk without checking the weather. I drive most days. I won't need a ride again.”
“I think he’ll like the black and blue one better. The black with silver is something he’d wear but the blue specks are like your eyes. He’ll want that one.” Sam answers in honest.
In a world where you have one perfect love, a soulmate, relationships can be daunting. You always know it won't work out if they don't share the mark of your soulmate, that being the same middle name. This freaks Dean James Winchester out, he's given up on being in the closet, given his middle name isn't very much perceived as gender neutral and he's always known he's bisexual. So any relationship he's had with a woman feels, unreal, like it won't last. Which he knows to be true, because of the name 'James.’ It isn't unheard of for people to choose to be with someone other than their soulmate but, he wants that unforgettable connection. He wants the passion of two people fate decided needed each other. But his middle name was so common he had no idea when he would meet his soulmate so, he just waited.
“Hell yes!” Cas slips the ring on his finger and everyone cheers around the two of them. Dean pulls Cas into a crushing hug with tears coming down his face.
“Ok, I'll make some breakfast to go.” Sam has probably been up for hours, and he's most likely ready to leave. Dean stands out of bed and clears his throat, working up the courage to say something to Cas about what has happened.
Dean sets aside the gift in favor of kissing his fiancé. The kiss naturally deepens. Cas lets Dean push him onto the bed and peel off all his clothing. Cas begins to take off his in return.
“What is so interesting about watching me sleep?” he asked.
“Okay love.”
“That still leaves morning.” He pouts while saying it.
After everyone had left as the night came to an end the two of them still sat in the war room. Cas in Dean’s lap with his fiancé playing with his hair.
Once the two of them are fully unclothed, they lie with Dean over Cas, kissing tenderly. Cas gently flips them over, switching their positions. Eliciting an excited gasp from Dean. He mimics his actions from this morning, trailing kisses down Dean’s body. He takes the time to suck marks onto his inner thighs, winning him some loud moans. Cas takes note that Dean quite enjoys that. He moves back up to lightly bite his nipples. Dean is squirming under his every touch.
He circles his rim for longer than needed, keeping Dean in further anticipation. Finally he inserts his first finger, to which Dean lets out restrained yell. Cas smiles at Dean confidently. He works that finger as slow as he can manage until he’s able to add another and continues the process until he has four fingers in. He carefully hits his prostate a few times.
They arrive at the address Cas told Dean. “See you around.” Cas says as he starts to exit the car. Dean salutes him flirtatiously. He smiles.
“Yeah, I wish I could eat with you tonight.”
