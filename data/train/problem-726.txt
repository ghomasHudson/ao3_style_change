Initially, Sherlock had been pleased to find Mycroft had forgotten about the half-hour time limit he’d placed on screen time, feeling a naughty thrill as each episode of cartoons passed without the appearance of big brother and his big book of rules.  But now his sippy cup was long-since empty, and his morning cartoons had shifted over into some sort of infomercial for cleaning products, and Sherlock was tired of telly.
But there was no denying that Papa was needed at work, and once Bunny’s sobbing had dissolved into quiet, sniffling tears, he tucked his head down and told him he had to go.
It's been so long, loves! I apologize!  I was travelling, which was wonderful, but didn't give me any time to write.  Hopefully I can make up for that over the next few weeks.
Bunny felt as if he might cry.  It seemed he had already lost his Daddy to Sherlock for the day, and now he was going to lose his Papa, too?
Sherlock moaned, free hand clutching the sheet below them as he begged John to press harder, to move faster.  John could feel wetness on his hand, trickles of urine leaking as the diaper was squeezed and shifted, and it made his own arousal rise.  He could feel Sherlock hard in the pull-up, could tell by the man’s desperate gyrating that he was more than enjoying himself.
Sherlock blinked up when the bottle was pulled away from him, disconcerted and confused.  He turned his face towards Mycroft and whined, reaching towards the baby bottle and attempting to pull it back towards him.  Mycroft held it just out of his reach.  He was clearly waiting for Sherlock to apologize, but the boy seemed to be oblivious to anything but the last sips of watered down orange juice at the bottom of the bottle, and began to cry.  Bunny thought Sherlock may be even more of a baby now than he had been back at the lake house.
But Daddy had not been amenable to Bunny’s pleas.  He had put him through two rounds of rather relentless spankings, Bunny thrashing about as he received slaps to alternating sides of his naked arse, his Daddy’s hand coming down without warning or method as Bunny kicked and writhed.  By the time Daddy finally agreed that he’d had enough, Bunny had shifted from his initial defiance into a weepy, pliable submission.
And then John was alone, closed into the back seat as Greg went to check in with Donovan, to make some excuse that would allow them to leave.  John wanted to suck his thumb, but he was too afraid someone would see.  He was desperate for his pacifier or one of his plush toys or his bunny blanket, perhaps more than he’d ever been before.  He needed something to calm him.  He needed Papa, whom he was anxious for until he came back into sight, hurrying towards the car and climbing into the front seat.
“‘Night Mycroft and Papa,” he yawned, and his Mycroft and his Papa told him goodnight before kissing his forehead, checking for monsters, and flicking off the light.
There was a knock on the door after Mycroft had washed up the bunny and had settled back to let the boy play.  Mycroft and Bunny looked up from the wall of the tub where they were playing tic-tac-toe with bath crayons.  Bunny was covered in bubbles and surrounded by his favorite plastic mermaids.  His hair was wet and dripping into his face, but he was happy at last.
It was when they were nearly out of the doorway that Greg caught sight of the unicorn headband he had given Bunny before the debacle of Bunny leaving and the all-encompassing worry of potentially triggering Sherlock’s memory of Eurus and Victor Trevor.  Greg understood Mycroft’s worries regarding keeping Sherlock from the pain of the past, but, now that the danger of remembrance seemed to have dissipated for the moment, he wanted to ensure Bunny still felt comfortable expressing him or herself fully.
“I could have done that for you,” Sherlock said, breathing heavily after they’d collapsed back onto the bed.
Mycroft patted the outer edge of Sherlock’s thigh to signal the boy was all set.  He stood from the crouched position he had been in to clean up Sherlock and tossed the used wipes and the pull-up into the trash.
As Mycroft climbed gently out of bed, he put a finger to his lips to signal to Sherlock that they should be quiet to keep from waking Greg or John.  Sherlock looked a bit pained when Mycroft stood at the end of the bed and gestured for Sherlock to crawl towards him, and when the boy eventually did move with a quiet moan, Mycroft could see why.  There was a wet spot on the sheets below where Sherlock had been lying, and his pajama pants were wet from where his pull-up had leaked.
This was originally part of a longer chapter, but the chapter switched perspectives in the middle, so I realized it made more sense to siphon off this section and then have the next chapter begin in a new perspective.  The good news is that means the next chapter is already half written :)
"Mycroft," John started again, blushing, but then turned to his downtrodden friend, nearly amazed at what was unfolding before him.  “Sherlock, don’t cry, lad.  It’s okay.”
Mycroft was at Baker Street within fifteen minutes, stepping up the stairs and into the flat without knocking.  Sherlock was at the kitchen table, sitting over a cup of tea and, Mycroft assumed, sorting the details of the most recently solved case into his Mind Palace.
John attempted to steel his facial expressions against any visible signs of concern.  Here was his worry actualized: additional pieces of information Mycroft had likely hoped to keep concealed that may come to light in Sherlock's memory.
“You’re alright, honey Bun,” his Daddy said, first pulling off the nightshirt Bunny was so desperate to keep clean to ensure it escaped any urine and then wrapping him in a hug.
Greg stood, inadvertently separating his hands from his mother’s touch.  He'd been exceedingly careful, had respected John’s wishes that his ageplaying remain as private as possible.  Now, here was his mother speaking with knowledge about something Greg had shared with no one but Mycroft, Sherlock, and John.
Mycroft shook his head without hesitation.  He did not want John to feel as if his desires were wrong or undesirable.  The man had clearly been torn up by these emotions for some time now.  He had contemplated confronting the man about these issues many times, but knew that, when it came to John, the man would only be able to process on his own terms.  Mycroft would not have been able to force him to talk if he hadn’t been ready.
Sherlock’s head was against Mycroft’s shoulder and he did not protest when Mycroft slipped a pacifier between his lips.
Sherlock, concerned at the moment with nothing outside of his own comfort, turned his head into Greg’s neck.  The boy was not doing much by way of helping Greg hold him, legs dangling instead of wrapped around Greg’s waist in the way they had learned stabilized them both, but Greg was just happy the boy had finally settled down, content to see the boy obviously reveling in being held.  He bounced the boy a bit to shift Sherlock higher up on his hip.  It had taken nearly an entire day for Greg to find himself with two cheerfully relaxed kids, something Greg knew would dissipate were he to deny Bunny his request.
Sherlock pulled back a bit, shifting Bunny off of his chest, and looked him over, his eyes scanning over his wiggling frame.  Bunny fished his pacifier out from where it had been tangled in the sheets and put it back into his mouth.
It had been an embarrassing challenge to put on what he knew to be a not so convincing act of littleness in Mycroft’s presence.  John had by no means been young when he had shown up in the master bedroom to tell Mycroft Sherlock was ready to chat with him; aging down took time for John, far longer than it generally did for Sherlock, whom John had seen shift from adult to child in mere seconds.  John had only been ageplaying for a very short time, something Mycroft often reminded him when he felt confused or upset by his time as a little, and he held more reservations.  John still needed long moments--sometimes hours--to fully get himself out of the way and accept a more child-like state.
“Do you want to color with me?” Sherlock asked.  He felt shy, almost as if he were meeting someone new.  “You can color unicorns or princesses if you want.”
“Accidents mean ‘x’es on the chart,” Sherlock explained.  “You’d be disappointed.  You always said so.”
“I care very much for him,” John said, and wondered just how much Mycroft knew about the romantic relationship he and Sherlock had settled into.  The fact that his boyfriend was now inviting him to---be what? His father? A second older brother?--was more than enough to bring John pause.
John blinked at Sherlock, unsure whether to be amazed or angry.  He’d been dreading discussing yesterday for the very reason Sherlock had just mentioned, not keen to process his conflicting emotions over his gender identity while little with his--at times, rather insensitive--boyfriend.  Sherlock had been young enough that John had even questioned whether he'd even been aware of John's decision to express himself as feminine.  Clearly, he hadn't given Sherlock enough credit.
“I want it,” he whined, and Greg hugged him close.  He knew how attached the boy had gotten to his pacifiers, and he suddenly thanked his lucky stars that he would never have to actually wean the boy from a pacifier the way he would with a biologically young child.
“A man who reacts the way I saw this morning, a man who seems to be set off into a rage like that?  I don’t think it’s possible those feelings just disappear.  But he doesn’t get angry in headspace.  He cries, he gets upset, but he doesn’t throw things; he doesn’t lash out...”
Although Mycroft felt justified in placing himself at Baker Street to care for the boys, he had not exactly left on the best terms earlier that morning.  He was fairly certain that, had they arrived to find the boys adult, there would have been tension, perhaps accusations.  It had been necessary to leave them when he had, necessary to withhold the truth, but that didn’t mean he hadn’t worried about Sherlock--and, by extension, John--throughout the entirety of the day.
Greg seemed taken aback.  “If you think that man is in this for some ulterior motive, Mycroft, I have to say I think that’s a bit far-fetched.  No one would put up with as much from Sherlock Holmes as that man does unless there was affection there.”
“I’m on my way to one member of my family as we speak,” he said, sincere in the warmth of his tone.  “Besides, this will give me a chance to introduce you to the good old Lestrade clan.”
“Look for the man’s employer,” Sherlock said, standing up from where he had been crouched over the body.  “He’ll have a missing finger on his dominant hand, which in this case is his left.  Some sort of carpentry accident, most likely.  He’s your murderer.”
John knew they were joking, that Sherlock was teasing to shift John away from his overthinking tendencies, but he couldn’t help but feel a stab of guilt.   Anderson--whether little or adult--hadn’t deserved to receive the brunt of John’s anger.  Neither did Greg deserve to spend hours of his day cleaning up the mess while John settled himself into the protection of headspace.  His stomach was in knots over the prospect that word may have gotten back to the Chief Inspector; John wasn’t sure he’d ever forgive himself if Greg were to lose his job because of the anger issues he’d never exactly dealt with.
It was only when he shifted on the seat and pressed his legs together involuntarily that he realized with a blush what he was going to have to do.
The wetness was warm as it trickled into the extra padding of his training pants, and for a moment it felt just as it did when Bunny peed into his pull-ups, fabric expanding between his legs.  But soon the terrycloth at his crotch could not contain the wetness, and he felt the pee streaming fast onto the carpet beneath him, spreading between his knees and along his bum, where he was sitting.
This chapter is low on ageplay and heavy on exposition, so feel free to skip if that's not your cup of tea.  I think it's necessary for the direction I'd like the plot to take, and it didn't seem likely that John would allow himself to stay young when worried about Sherlock's well-being, so the chapter takes place when he is fully adult.
“That’s a question that I’m sure Bunny would be happy to answer,” Mycroft said.  “From my understanding, sometimes he feels more like a girl than a boy.  When that happens, he’d rather be a girl than spend lots of energy trying to be a boy just to make others happy.  Do you understand?”
It was a surprise to find out from the staff that Mycroft was not at the office but had left for home some time earlier.  Greg found a new cab and gave him the address for Mycroft’s flat, picking up his mobile with the intent of calling, but ultimately deciding against it.  It was clear Mycroft had shut himself away; he didn’t want to give him an opportunity to deny his company even before he’d arrived.
Mycroft’s voice was firm, but kind, and Sherlock found himself shifting from leaning against the arm of the couch to leaning against Mycroft, his head suddenly in his brother’s lap.
“Can we have a moment alone?” John asked, turning to Mycroft and Greg, who had been standing over the medical proceedings like a nervous set of parents while John worked.
Mycroft really had gotten creative with decorating each of the spare bedrooms for the boys.  Bunny’s room had been painted a pastel yellow, and Mycroft had managed to find a duvet cover decorated with sleeping forest creatures--fawns, bear cubs, wolf cubs, and baby bunnies--among scattered trees, stumps, and leaves.  On the window seat at the far side of the room were throw-pillows decorated with images from the night sky, the dark blue contrasting with the pale yellow of the walls.  Bunny--snuggled beneath the new duvet with his stuffed rabbit, Willa, and his Peter Rabbit pacifier, looked perfectly content.
He half-listened as Greg continued, taking comfort in the man’s voice but not having the energy to follow his train of thought explicitly.  He was relieved Greg hadn’t asked questions.  He didn’t feel up to explaining that he’d been waiting for close to four hours, or admitting that Harry had let him down once more, or pretending he wasn’t hurt by it all.
Gathering clothes for what was promising to be a sunny, clear day, Mycroft wondered if the plan he and Greg had discussed last night--canoeing and swimming with the boys in the lake--would be possible given Sherlock’s current state of mind.  He decided to deal with the day moment by moment; his first priority would be to ensure that Sherlock was okay.
“I’m afraid your bunny blanket didn’t escape the accident,” Greg said as he crossed to the dresser to find clothes for John to change into.
It was the growling of John’s stomach that eventually interrupted their found serenity.  John sat up in surprise after his stomach had growled loudly, and Greg could not help but laugh gently at the boy’s expression.  John was a bit bashful, but he laughed as well, and when Greg tickled his tummy, John laughed louder.
“I went already,” Sherlock mumbled, pressing the heels of his hands against the tears threatening to fall.
And, as Mycroft comforted Sherlock late at night, as the boy’s pain threatened to consume them both, he began to regret not taking more of an active role in attempting to decipher his little sister’s rhyme.  Eurus had rather strange mannerisms, yes, but even Mycroft hadn’t assumed she was truly responsible for Victor Trevor’s disappearance.  He should have placed more stock in Sherlock’s worry.  He should have tried harder to find Sherlock’s best friend.
He squirmed away from Papa’s long reach and glanced up towards Mycroft, who had always been the enforcer of rules pertaining to Sherlock’s eating habits.
Sherlock’s eyes widened and he nodded his head slowly, as if the gravity of his words had just been explained to him for the first time.
“Please, My?” Sherlock pleaded, grabbing onto Mycroft’s arm.  “Please! I promise I’ll be a good boy from now on and I’ll pay attention to Bunny’s needs like a big brother is apposed to!”
For all of his antics and refusals, a part of Bunny knew Sherlock was not actually against the scheme.  He’d seemed rather eager to begin on the day he joked about it with John, pressing him for information about his early memories of toilet training-- “I knew you were a late bloomer; I myself was out of nappies by 18 months, thanks to Mycroft’s tyrannical regimen”--and going so far as to begin searching for chamomile tea, which he explained had natural diuretic properties in case they wanted to make things more interesting when the day to begin came.
“I have to go,” John said after they’d been kissing for quite some time, Sherlock teasing John’s by running his free hand over his distended bladder.  “Oh, fuck, I have to go.”
‘Rudolph the Red-Nose Reindeer’ date back to the 1939 children’s book of the same name…” Sherlock rambled on, mouth full.
“It’s for anyone who likes it,” he said, and Bunny looked up at him as if gauging how truthful the statement really was before glancing back towards the row of clothing.
“It’s too hot,” Sherlock said, sitting up and stripping himself of his pajama shirt.  He reached out and pushed Bunny in the shoulder.  “Get away.  This is my bed.”
Papa found a new pacifier in the top drawer--Daddy must have bought a few new ones for Bunny and Sherlock--and slipped it between Bunny’s lips.  The boy latched on immediately, desperate for the comfort.
"You might need these more than me," Sherlock said, stepping out of the pull-up he had been wearing.
But instead of letting himself cry, he ducked down under the sheet, joining Sherlock in the warm darkness.  The air in the bedroom was humid from the building moisture all morning, but Sherlock seemed to not mind or to stubbornly ignore the sheen of sweat across his body.  They would be cool soon enough; the rain had brought a chiller breeze, and the bedroom was already shifting in temperature as the storm grew.
Spending the night in his old bedroom was not exactly among his top five Christmas Eve activities, but at the moment he had more to worry about than the self-deprecating thoughts his old bedroom conjured within him about his teenage loneliness.  He had a nearly regressed Sherlock in the other room, hadn’t heard from John at all, and Greg had been rather uncommunicative after texting that he was on his way to pick up the Bunny, responding to Mycroft’s texts with vague responses that left more questions than answers.
“Those things don’t matter, love,” Mycroft said, cupping Sherlock’s cheek when the boy leaned back to look up at him.  “You’re a special boy no matter what, and I love you always, no matter your behavior or the state of your trousers.”
“It’s a good thing dinner will be here soon,” Greg said, setting about pouring a cup of tea for himself and for Mycroft.  “It’s looking like they could use an early bedtime, tonight.”
Nevertheless, Greg’s enthusiasm for tackling each and every thing related to their little family head-on bolstered Mycroft.  They would gather up the boys and their things, take them back to Mycroft’s flat, and deal with each issue as it presented itself, just as they had that evening since arriving at Baker Street.
“Come on now, it can’t be as bad as all that, now, can it?” Greg asked good-humoredly, knowing that keeping his own countenance light when Mycroft’s was dark was the only way to keep them moving forward, the only way to coax Mycroft out of his own mind.
“Ma, I--” Greg tried, torn between sharing this part of his life with his mother and denying its existence to save John’s pride.
“You were happy here,” John said, watching Greg’s expression as he eyed the trinkets and memorabilia that were the scattered reminders of his childhood.
Sherlock collapsed onto the bed with flailing limbs in an overdramatic expression of his frustration.  A childlike response, yes, but the movement was too calculated to have come from a fully regressed Sherlock.  It was a clear attempt to cajole a softer response from Mycroft, a tactic to gain sympathy and coddling.  But Mycroft was not about to downplay the seriousness of the situation by catering to his little brother’s desire for immediate forgiveness.  Comfort would come in due time.
“It was wrong of you to tease your brother today.  As the big brother, it’s your job to protect those who are littler than you, especially your brother.  You didn’t protect John today by teasing him, did you?”
“There’s some jealousy, I suppose,” Sherlock said after a moment, glancing down into his pint.  “Only natural.”
Thanks for all of your lovely feedback on the last chapter, loves!  You're all the best for sticking with me and providing interesting insights into the plot lines I'm working with.  We're back to a bit of ageplay in this chapter, and more is to come as we navigate the implications of Mycroft's choices and the haunting of Sherlock's past.
John cleared his throat and blinked into himself, wiping his face in the crook of his elbow and scooting forward onto the edge of the couch, separating himself a bit from Mycroft and Greg’s touch.  He took a moment to ground himself, then stood.
John could see Sherlock was getting restless after he’d completed his fourth puzzle in half as many hours.  He’d been reading in his chair, glancing up to pass along some words of encouragement to his slightly regressing boyfriend from time to time, but a mind such as Sherlock’s needed new and varied stimulation; jigsaw puzzles could only occupy him for so long.
Sherlock felt alone being the only one awake and the rain and the house was scary and what if Mycroft liked Bunny better than him?  Bunny was well behaved and cute and quiet, and Sherlock was a spoiled brat.  It was no wonder his brother had chosen the Bunny over him.  Sherlock turned to run out of the master bedroom before he woke up his brother with his sniffling.  He tripped on the slight wooden lip in the doorway where the hardwood from the hallway met the carpet of the bedroom, which only made it harder to hold back his tears, but he regained his footing after a quick stumble and was quickly back in his room.  He closed the door and caught his breath.
Mycroft sighed.  “I wish I could, buddy, but I have an important phone call this morning that I need to be here for.  You can go to the zoo with Sherlock and Uncle Greg, or you can stay here with me and later this afternoon we can go to the park.”
Bunny ducked his head and began to eat, not acknowledging Papa at all.  He’d taken precautions to keep Sherlock from teasing him, and now Papa had gone and called him a baby girl name.  Didn’t he see that this older Sherlock was different than yesterday’s little Sherlock?  Didn’t he see that this Sherlock didn’t like it?
Bunny rubbed at his eyes and curled himself up into a ball.  Crying made his throat burn, but he couldn’t stop the tears, despite trying.
“Mycroft!” Sherlock called as he burst into the flat.  He rushed to the kitchen table where Mycroft was sitting, and held up a plush alligator, making the alligator growl a hello to Mycroft.  Mycroft assumed the alligator had been the closest thing the gift shop had had to a dinosaur.
Bunny became impatient, pulling on Greg’s shirt and telling him they had to get to the store before all the good things were bought up.  Uncle Greg chuckled and obeyed, taking off with a bit of a jump to make Bunny laugh.
But half an hour and another unanswered phone call passed, John stamping his feet to keep out the chill of the December day.  It was below freezing, and the clouds dark; he knew snow was expected.  His phone pinged with a text message, but it was only Greg, asking if he’d made it safely to his sister’s apartment.
The voice sounded like Uncle Greg, but Sherlock wasn't sure whether to trust it.  What if a monster had stolen Uncle Greg’s voice like the sea witch in the mermaid movie John liked so much?  What if he opened the closet and it wasn't Uncle Greg at all?
“Yes, Sherlock?” Mycroft asked, steeling himself against sighing over his brother’s upteenth question that evening.
“Daddy,” Bunny giggled, stretching out the vowels of the word as if embarrassed that Mycroft had drawn attention to his nakedness.
He brushed the hair back from Sherlock’s face and, seeing the pirate pacifier on his nightstand, worked the boy’s thumb out from between his lips and substituted the pacifier, which Sherlock took eagerly.  The boy was clean, medicated, and back into a dry bed, and it hadn’t taken longer than 20 minutes or so.  Greg walked across the room to turn off the desk lamp, grateful that all was well and that he could get back to bed himself.
Mycroft and Greg shared a look.  It was obvious Sherlock had been having a hard time with the whole potty training endeavor, that however game for the exercise he’d been in theory, the actual practice had thrown him off course, particularly given the difficulty he’d had shifting down into the correct headspace that morning.  Mycroft wasn’t entirely surprised; after all, his brother had never had a very smooth relationship with his bladder, in childhood or adulthood, and it wasn’t something Sherlock ever talked about, if he could help it.  It wasn’t surprising that the boy was having difficulties, and it wasn't surprising that he would be sensitive to inquiries about needing the loo given his accident earlier in the day.
“Should we go and get your brother?” he asked as he helped Sherlock into one of his own jumpers to keep him warm.
Sherlock glanced between the men standing over him before turning his gaze back to the beveled edge of the table.  It was clear they were watching him, waiting for his next move.  Sherlock began to second-guess his assumption that Papa had not caught on.  He was certainly looking at him pointedly, and Sherlock felt suspiciously as if he were being tested in some way.  But if Papa and Mycroft knew for certain that he’d had an accident, it seemed likely they would have punished him right away.  They wouldn’t be waiting for Sherlock to confirm it all by explaining that he wasn’t worthy of choosing a sticker, wouldn't they?
I’d love to get a Christmas-themed one-shot up in the near future if I can.  I’ve been feeling like I may need a teeny writing break from the heaviness of this story at the moment, so a one-shot would be a perfect way to break out of the mold, so to speak.  I don’t think it will be up before Christmas, but potentially a few days after!  Let me know if you have any one-shot storyline suggestions!
John set his face as he stared at Mycroft.  It was sometimes easy to forget that Mycroft could be just as smug about his own innovations of thought as Sherlock.  The man seemed to sense the judgment in John’s gaze, and set his tone of voice back to sincerity.
Sherlock whined a bit, but Greg knew the boy would not turn down the opportunity to be carried, something Mycroft could only do for short periods of time but Greg had gotten quite skilled at.  He placed Sherlock standing just long enough to turn him around and hoist him back into his arms, then carried the boy towards the stairs as Mycroft stood to stretch and rub the muscles of his thighs, sore from the length of time Sherlock had been curled up in his lap.
Papa had brought Sherlock back to the big bed to calm him down after Bunny’s screaming fit, had rubbed Sherlock’s back until he’d shrugged away from touch.  Sherlock knew Bunny needed Mycroft and that he had to share, but Sherlock needed him, too.  He needed him to give hugs and say everything was okay after such a scary middle-of-the-night wake-up.  But Mycroft did not come back to the big bed, and, finally--after Papa had rationalized and soothed--Sherlock had begrudgingly rolled over, given into the yawns, and gone to sleep.
Mycroft would have made the kid give up his comfort items in the midst of punishment, but Greg couldn’t bear to leave him without some semblance of familiarity, at least for the moment.
“You need to eat, Sherlock,” Mycroft said when he noticed that Sherlock’s plate was still full.  “Or would you like me or Papa feed you?”
Greg snorted and, after wiping his soapy hands on a dishcloth, pulled Mycroft to him and kissed him.
Mycroft was quiet for a moment, and Bunny knew it was to allow him the space to speak up, to elaborate and explain exactly what it was he wanted.  Bunny was sleepy and warm pressed against his Daddy, and a part of him wanted to allow himself to drift off and finally take a nap.  But a larger part of him knew this was his chance to ask for what he wanted, and his Daddy always told him he needed to voice his needs.
His room was darker than the master bedroom had been, and he'd been telling John monster stories all day when the grown ups weren't paying attention and now he'd gone and scared himself.  And his bed was all wet and he didn't want to change himself and what if the people who owned the lake house found out he'd peed in their bed and got mad and then Mycroft was disappointed in him?
“Don’t like potty training,” Sherlock said all at once, leaving Mycroft wondering whether this was a new topic of conversation or an extension of their last one.  “...‘s too hard.”
Once they were in the bathroom, Greg helped him out of his now cold and itchy pants and then tore the sides of the wet pull-up to remove it from the consulting detective’s body.  The bath was a quick affair, just in and out with a quick scrub down.  Greg did wash Sherlock’s hair, Sherlock thought maybe because Uncle Greg was already washing his face free of tear streaks and maybe thought it would soothe him.  Sherlock usually hard having his hair washed, but he didn't mind tonight.  He didn't have the energy to put up a fight.
PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE heed the tags for this chapter, loves (read: depictions of and discussion around self-harm).  If this is triggering for you, please practice self-care and perhaps skip this story until this particular plot point is resolved.
“Thanks, ‘Lockie,” Bunny said after a moment, draping an arm over Greg’s shoulder and letting the alligator hang from his hand so Sherlock could reach up for him.  Sherlock took his alligator back and pressed it beneath his neck, next to Dmitri.  He was too comfortable and sleepy against Mycroft’s chest to speak.
Mycroft’s plans to keep a close eye on Sherlock had been well-intentioned.  The boy had been cycling through emotions since being woken up by Bunny’s nightmare the night before, and Mycroft knew it was essential that he be there to keep his brother settled comfortably in headspace and to keep an eye on the dark thoughts the boy struggled with on days he was feeling depressed and lost.
Pausing at the foot of the stairs, he took a moment to return to himself, needing to level his head before he began what he assumed would be a challenging conversation with his brother.  He couldn’t help but feel a sense of loss.  It was clear he had harmed his relationship with Sherlock.  Now he seemed to have lost a part of John as well.
“You need to tell Papa right away if you have to wee, love,” Greg said, patting Sherlock’s thigh to let him know they were all finished with the change.  “We don’t want your rash to get worse if you have any little accidents.”
It was clear the boy needed some comfort at the moment, and Mycroft knew he must be uncomfortable considering he had wet himself roughly twenty-five minutes ago.  But the boy was afraid, and Mycroft did not want to jar him by forcing him out from under the desk before he was ready.
It wasn’t a surprise when he began to leak in his underwear.  He chanced a glance down towards his crotch while Uncle Greg was watching the movie.  There was nothing yet visible on his pajama pants, but John could feel his underwear warm and wet as his bladder released a spurt of wetness.  John gasped and grabbed at his crotch when a second spurt leaked into his pants, but quickly moved his hand away and turned back to the movie when Uncle Greg glanced over at him.
Mycroft’s gaze shifted when Sherlock entered the room.  He held up a hand to signal to Sherlock that he was to remain silent, his expression and body language all-business as he continued to speak demeaningly to whomever was on the other line.
Sherlock could feel his cheeks pinking.  But he smiled at Bunny around the pacifier as Mycroft chuckled, in awe of his little brother's capacity for kindness and sensitivity.
“Sherlock?” Mycroft called to the boy hovering in the hallway between kitchen and bathroom.  “Are you feeling okay?”
Bunny had been a bother and a burden for almost two whole days, and now he was just adding more trouble by wanting to wear girls’ pull-ups and play with dolls.  Why hadn't he realized until that moment just how bad of a boy he’d been?  It was no wonder his Daddy didn’t want to buy him more pink pull-ups or let him wear his new nightgown.  He didn’t deserve them.
Hi, loves!  I've missed you all and hope you've all had a wonderful holiday season and are enjoying the new year!  Things have been very up in the air for me, which has meant less time to write, but I finally had some time to finish up this chapter and edit a bit, so I'm excited to share it with all of you.
The next four arguments Mycroft had pre-planned for the conversation were immediately silenced, futile in the ghastly realities of Sherlock’s tendencies towards self-harm.  His face fell, shoulders releasing the tension they’d been holding in his earlier attempt to defend his actions with pomposity and pride.
“I could stay here with Sherlock,” Greg said.  “Camp out on the couch for the night while you take the baby back to yours.”
Bunny started when Sherlock was spanked, and Greg shushed him, helping him step into his swim trunks and tying the drawstring around his waist.
Greg texted again, sending a picture of himself among smiling relatives, nieces and nephews hanging off of him and a man who was clearly one of his older brothers wrapping an arm around Greg’s shoulders.  Greg was smiling broadly and wearing a pair of felt reindeer antlers, clearly in his element among family and close friends.
“We’ll be fine,” Greg said, not having the time to convince the worried man any more eloquently.  He stepped into the closet and began sorting through the dress shirts he kept at Mycroft’s.  “I’ll keep an eye on him.  We’ll be home before you know it.”
Sherlock swore under his breath.  John deserved to be fully supported, to have someone to turn to when he needed to talk.  Sherlock had misread the situation and been too slow to rectify his mistake, and now John likely regretted ever having brought up his concern in the first place.
“That sounds like a great idea,” Greg smiled.  “Before we do that, though, how about we call in some take-away to fill that tummy of yours after you’re all nice and clean?”
“Another time, buddy,” Mycroft said, voice low, speaking into Sherlock’s hairline, “It’s time for all good little boys to get some sleep.”
“Sherlock, you can’t fucking piss yourself here,” he said, but that was exactly what John wanted him to do.  He had been aroused from the first sign of wetness, and was drunk enough that he had only a passing care for the fact that Sherlock was about to wet the seat.
“I had an interesting conversation with Mycroft, today,” Sherlock had said a week ago, flinging himself into his armchair after barrelling into the previously quiet flat and shrugging off his coat, which he tossed onto John’s empty chair.
“Seems like someone will be ready for a nap, today,” Uncle Greg said, and Sherlock could not even muster the energy to sit up and prove him wrong.
He was placed back into nappies before long, his father insisting Sherlock clearly needed to decide for himself when the time was right, and thus began an on-again-off-again pattern of Sherlock alternating between pants and nappies until it became easiest just to leave him in pull-ups full-time.  Sherlock would use the loo when it was convenient for him and use his pull-ups when it wasn’t, and it simply became a known fact that the Holmes’ headstrong youngest son wore training nappies until far past the time it was deemed acceptable.
The boy shrugged, then seemed to get uncomfortable and turned back to shove his mermaids down under the water.  He pushed them down and watched them pop up to the surface, then pushed them down once more.  Mycroft remained patient, waiting for the boy to explain himself.
He knew what would happen if he told them he’d wet his pants.  Papa would rub his back, comforting even as his face took on a picture of disappointment.  He would tell Sherlock he was hurt he hadn’t felt comfortable telling the truth in the guest bedroom, but was proud of him for eventually speaking up.  Mycroft would shake his head and, expression hard as it always was when he was dealing with dishonesty, explain that Sherlock’s deception had earned him a spanking.  He would take away Sherlock’s video game privileges for a week, at least.
Greg gave Bunny a few moments to process, but was relieved when his girl gave a quiet, “okay,” and pulled Willa closer to her chest.
Most of what had materialized that day seemed a passing fever dream now that his mind was free of the parameters of littlespace.  Since when did he act such a brat while little, ignoring anyone else’s needs except his own?  He had pushed Sherlock.  He had purposefully peed himself on the carpet.  He had told Mycroft he wasn’t a boy.  A frustrated blush crept to his cheeks as he stalked away from Mycroft’s stoop, shoving his hands into the pockets of his jacket and walking quickly, purposefully, needing to get away from Mycroft’s, needing space.
He was carried downstairs to the living room, where Bunny sat sniffling on Uncle Greg’s lap, pacifier in his mouth.  Sherlock felt a stab of guilt; Bunny must have been so upset that he was allowed his pacifier even though he had a sore tongue.  He felt shy and sad when Mycroft set him down, and tried to hide behind his brother.
If there was one thing John had practice at, it was doing things to please Sherlock.  Greg disliked that the man often did things for Sherlock at the expense of his own needs, and he and Mycroft had been slowly working on that with the kid, but, for now, it gave him an excuse to cheer his boy up, and he would take it.
“You’ll need to sit with us at the table, at the very least,” he said when he turned back to an impatient Sherlock.
He ran his fingers along his Ariel nightshirt.  Papa and Daddy had said it was okay for Bunny to be their little princess, and Bunny knew that Papa meant it.  But Daddy had been hesitant, and wanting to actually be a little girl took things a bit farther.  Bunny felt scared.  If he told them, would they think he was wrong, or not believe him, or think he was just too much of a burden?
And so, because it was harder to admit what was really going on than it was to think that Bunny was taunting Sherlock for his inability to ask for what he needed, Sherlock turned his anger and frustration not at himself, but at Bunny.  Judging and snubbing and trying to make Bunny’s life more difficult had the dual benefits of lessening Bunny’s comfort--and thus decreasing the hostility Sherlock felt towards himself and his own inability to find comfort--while providing Sherlock with additional ways to misbehave--and thus gaining more opportunities for Mycroft and Papa Greg’s attention.
“They might make fun of me,” he mumbled, as if embarrassed to say the words.  “They’ll think I’m bad, and they’ll forget about everything except that.”
Bunny’s first set of pajamas were still dry, so Mycroft simply buttoned the boy back up once he’d been cleaned and dressed in a fresh pull-up and told him he was a good boy.
“--Or,” Greg continued with a sigh, out of alternatives and not wanting to cause his boy any further distress.  “If you feel like you can’t go into the loo, you can go in your pants, right here.”
Lastly, thank you to Simi, falc0nwing, and tiaoconnell for pointing out that Mycroft will not be a very happy camper given the way John chose to use alcohol to numb his emotions throughout chapter 13.  That idea was spot-on, and allowed for some interesting teasing between Sherlock and John in this chapter.   You were all right that Mycroft will likely have words (or punishments) for John in regards to his drinking, and I'm interested to explore what that might look like in the next chapter or two!
It was rare that John was non-verbal when fully adult, but since being assured time and again in littlespace that there was nothing wrong with moments of quietude here and there, the man had become more prone to silences even in his adult state, although generally only with Mycroft.  He was too paranoid others would view his quiet moments as rudeness.
Luckily, Bunny accepted the pacifier Greg held up to his mouth, which quieted him despite the tears pulsing down the boy’s flushed cheeks.  He managed to lift Bunny out of the bed and stand him on his feet beside the dresser drawers, where the boy finished peeing his nightgown and then looked up at Greg, pleading with him to help.
Mycroft and Greg had responded far better to finding Sherlock sitting soaked in the backseat of the rental car than Sherlock would have expected.  Bunny, who had, upon seeing the state of Sherlock’s trousers, offered Sherlock the rest of his ice cream cone in order to keep Sherlock from crying even more, stood watch outside the car while Greg passed Mycroft clean clothes from a suitcase in the trunk--a fresh pull-up, warm green sweatpants, and Sherlock’s pirate shirt.  Mycroft climbed into the backseat beside his brother and helped Sherlock get out of his wet things.  Greg also passed along a baseball cap, which Sherlock pulled down onto his head almost before Mycroft could get his shirt on.  It had been Greg's idea, a way to keep Sherlock from becoming over-excited and thus liable to be jarred back up in age while he was little.  The baseball cap not only kept Sherlock from feeling fully exposed to the world around him, but allowed him a narrower sightline.   When he pulled the brim of the cap down over his eyebrows, Sherlock could limit the amount of stimulation entering into his vision each moment.  It had been quite a feat to change the boy considering Sherlock refused to exit the car, but Mycroft was rather adept at dressing his brother, and aside from the near-tantrum Sherlock threw about not wanting to wear another pull-up, Sherlock was dressed and clean quickly.
“I don’t have to,” he said, glancing up at Mycroft for only a moment before his gaze returned to the ground.
“Daddy was just teasing,” he soothed, suddenly realizing in the light of larger problems just how ridiculous he’d been about not letting the kids have a treat before dinner.  “Santa could never be mad over a little accident.”
“Everything with Anderson settled, then?” Mycroft asked from his spot behind the counter as he passed Greg a wine glass and began to pour.
“Did you get far in your video game, champ?” Papa asked as he tucked into his lunch, obviously attempting to draw Sherlock into the conversation.
John checked the time and got out of his chair to crouch down beside Sherlock, careful to step around the nearly completed puzzle of the world map.  It was past dinnertime, and John hoped he could get Sherlock to eat something before it got too late.
Bunny seemed to realize what was happening just as Greg did.  He reached a hand down to feel the wet fabric and, understanding that he was wetting his bed, dissolved into whimpering tears.
“Please My?” Sherlock asked, acting sweet and compliant either to atone for his naughtiness earlier in the day or to keep from being punished further for it.
Greg nodded, a bit pained that Mycroft was speaking to him now as he did when they were working together professionally, yet understanding the need for urgency and pragmatism.
“I’m proud of you for going out with your Uncle Greg today.  It must have been scary and I can see that you were very brave.”
Bunny nodded and hid his face against Willa the rabbit, who hadn't been out of Bunny's arms for more than a moment since they'd left the car.
Let me know your thoughts and please feel free to pass along constructive criticism.  Hopefully Mycroft's motivation/gameplan throughout this chapter makes sense, but if you have questions or suggestions for making things more cohesive/clear, let me know.  I'm excited to get back to ageplay in the next chapter (preview: regressed little Sherlock crying over his lost dog *sob*)
Sherlock blinked down at the Bunny, who was still pressed against his chest, then huffed and turned away from him, pulling the sheet up and over his head.  It was as if Sherlock had forgotten he was supposed to be angry until Bunny had reminded him of the fact.
Sherlock understood why John would be angry; he had been out of touch for three days, away from the flat battling his need for drugs now that their case had finished and left him nothing more than a hollow sense of purposelessness.  John had seen the pattern before: the drugs were a welcome relief, but their hold upon Sherlock was fleeting at best, and the more Sherlock took, the more helpless and depressed he felt upon coming out of the haze.  But that didn't make Sherlock's actions any easier on his boyfriend, he knew.  Later, John would ask what had brought Sherlock back to the flat that night, and Sherlock would explain that he had snapped out of a high quicker than he ever had before, knowing that what he actually needed was far simpler than grimy needles and drug dens in abandoned city buildings.
His parents’ house at the holidays was always the same, all lit fireplaces and twinkling lights and peppermint hot chocolate.  It was an environment that, in other circumstances, may have been a comforting respite from the chaos of the cases he and John had just finished.  But, at the moment, it was an environment that did nothing to alleviate the burgeoning little headspace Sherlock had been fighting since the night before, when John had pulled the test tubes from his hands to make him go pack a suitcase, giving him a quick swat on the arse as he went since the doctor had been asking for the better part of two hours.
Mycroft chuckled.  “John, the reason Sherlock has so many rules in place is because he is desperate for attention but doesn’t feel comfortable asking for it.  He knows very well he is not allowed to suck his thumb and he knows that I know he knows.  So Sherlock choosing to suck his thumb--even though the action has never brought him much pleasure throughout his life--is a way for him to gain my attention, a way for him to once again feel a small reminder that he’s under my care, and these things keep him little.  God knows I would prefer he seek positive attention instead of negative, but you’ve seen how uncomfortable he gets when I try to express affection towards him.  Only the most experienced therapist in the world would be able to convince him he deserves positive attention and can ask for it when he feels unloved or unsure of himself.  Until then, it’s clear he needs outlets through which to gain attention in his own way.”
“Listen to me, Bun,” he said, wanting nothing more than to comfort the sweet man in front of him, to make him understand that he had done nothing wrong.  “It’s been a tough day for everyone.  We woke up much too early and with far too much stress, and we’ve spent the day navigating a rather emotional set of circumstances.  But, throughout it all, you’ve been nothing but a good, sweet boy.”
Sherlock rushed over to John, who was quickly enveloped in a tight hug and kissed sloppily on the cheek.  John giggled; Sherlock rarely showed as much compassion or affection as John would have liked, so he hugged him back tightly and did not pull away until Sherlock kissed him one more time on the cheek and then returned to skipping around the room.
Bunny was clearly as invested in the rare opportunity to watch cartoons as Sherlock was, and it was nice to have someone to watch with.
“Okay,” Greg said.  “I'll get you some undies instead.  Just make sure to use the loo before we leave.”
“Let’s not disturb them if they’re asleep,” he said, and Greg stepped away from the door as Mycroft took out his key.
“It was a matter of national importance,” he argued, resentful of Greg’s implications given that the man had also chosen work over their scheduled ageplay weekend.  “There was nothing to be done.”
Sherlock shook his head.  He knew Papa had only wanted him to fall asleep and get rest last night, but he’d told him Mycroft would be there in the morning, and now he wasn’t.  Mycroft had been with Bunny all night.  What about him?
“It’s 9:45 at the moment,” Sherlock said, his voice now no-nonsense where it had been glib a moment before.  “I estimate we have another hour at the most.  Start explaining.”
“Would you like to talk about it now or later, bud?” Greg asked.  “Because a conversation is over due.”
Bunny nodded, rubbing at tired eyes, and obeyed.  Mycroft watched him make his way towards the bedroom, then gathered the wet clothes from the bathroom to toss into the hamper on his way upstairs.  He found John’s comfort items where they were always tucked away in the man’s closet, then made his way back downstairs to Sherlock’s room.
Being alone with his brother always reminded Mycroft of their earliest days ageplaying.  Sure, they were both far more confident in their roles than they had been while bumbling their way through the trial-and-error of their earliest scenes, back when Mycroft had practically been a kid himself and Sherlock was a very angry little, but there was still the contented history of their shared experiences and the extreme trust that came from the history of Mycroft looking after Sherlock.  Mycroft had been there for his little brother in the past, and he would do everything in his power to ensure that he would be there for him in the future, guarding him against the monsters of his own mind.
“We usually know how we’re feeling, even if we don’t always know where those feelings come from.  And that’s good,” Mycroft explained, speaking slower than usual to ensure the boy understood him, particularly now that he knew how young his little brother was feeling.  “But, sometimes, even when you’re
“Goodnight, Mycroft,” Sherlock said, turning once more and grateful when his brother did nothing but wish him goodnight in return.
Bunny could not help but smile at the praise, snuggling close against Papa’s chest and reveling in the warmth of his embrace.  Papa had been supportive of Bunny from the beginning, from the very first moment he’d learned that Bunny had a penchant for paper dolls and unicorns.  Even so, this is what Bunny had been waiting for all morning: unequivocal acceptance and love from Papa, whom she had never had any cause to doubt when it came to this topic.
“Needed to stay little,” Sherlock mumbled quietly, attention on the plastic shark, making it eat his fingers.  “But I’m not a baby.”
John started to cry, something somewhat rare for John while in headspace and admittedly usually tied to embarrassment.  He said nothing but he did nod as he squeezed his legs together and reached down to press against the front of his pull-up, feeling another spurt of wetness escape him.
“We’ll get you some aspirin once we’re settled in the car, Bun, and then maybe you’ll be able to take a bit of a morning nap.  Do you have what you need?”
“Yes.  It’s never okay to wander away from me or your Uncle Greg.  You broke one of our most important rules, and you need to be punished for that.”
But he hoped to god that Mycroft would not stop.  The pain was settling him, grounding him, and pulling him away from the thoughts racing through his mind.  With each smack reddening his bare bottom, Sherlock felt a bit of his anger and sullenness slip away.  Mycroft was taking care of him.  Sherlock didn’t have to be alone.
“Thanks for your help, princess,” Papa said when the last of the plastic dishes--the only ones Bunny was allowed to help dry--were in the dish rack.  “Go play with your brother while I finish up, here, okay?”
He had to get away from Mycroft and Papa’s disappointed looks and Bunny’s whimpering and sniffling before he slipped down to an age where he was too young to have power over anything at all.  He ran from the living room as his own tears began, taking the stairs two at a time in his haste to escape the others.  He retreated into his room, pulling the door shut and throwing himself onto his bed, face pressed into his arms as he cried.
The Bunny snuggled back into Sherlock’s side, his stuffed lion clutched in his arms.  He closed his eyes and lifted his thumb to his mouth.
Sherlock knew he’d been a brat, that he’d acted out and made the morning unpleasant for his parents and frustratingly difficult for Mycroft.  But he couldn’t help it; everything felt like it was far too much.  He wished he could be small, that his mind would stop racing with everything he’d done wrong over the course of the trip home.
“I was hoping it wouldn’t come to this, Sherlock,” he said, voice grim.  “There are secrets best left forgotten.”
“I want to apologize for the way I behaved earlier today, John,” he said, “I knew you were not fully young, and I took advantage because I sensed you must be attempting to align yourself with Sherlock.  It was childish of me to act out by attempting to make you feel lesser.”
John’s face crumpled as he took his thumb out of his mouth and began to cry.  He looked pitifully broken as he stood in the kitchen and the tears streamed down his face.  Mycroft was taken aback.  He had never seen the man cry while in head space apart from a few scattered nights when John’s PTSD reared its head in the form of violent nightmares.  The tears then had been unsurprising.  The nightmares John described were intense for even adult John, so it was no wonder they impacted little John. But Mycroft was not used to John’s tears in the daylight, and certainly not around Sherlock or Lestrade. John had always seemed to hold himself back from full emotional release when not impacted by a nightmare, had always seemed to be too self conscious to let go in that way.
Sherlock blinked back tears.  He was having a hard time processing the information.  If Mycroft was John’s daddy then where did that leave him?  Mycroft couldn't be Sherlock’s daddy--he would always be his big brother.  Did that mean that Mycroft and John's relationship was more special than Mycroft and Sherlock's?
He did not know whether Sherlock remembered Victor Trevor or still conceptualized Redbeard as a dog, but he was hoping he could perpetuate the myth of the pet a bit longer with his insistence, whichever the case.  There was a bit of doubt in Sherlock’s expression when Mycroft turned his attention away from John, but the man did not refute Mycroft’s statement.
“Tired, Papa,” Bunny said with a yawn, drawing Mycroft and Greg’s attention back to their youngest.  “Wanna go sleep.”
“We do not throw things in this house, young man,” Mycroft said, standing from the chair at his desk and crossing toward the couch.  “You’ve earned yourself a timeout.”
“Thank god you’re back--Ma was about to bring out the board games,” a third quipped, punching Greg lightly in the shoulder.
Greg turned to glance at Bunny in the seat behind him.  The boy was holding his bunny close to his chest, his baby blanket draped over his knees.
John curled his hands into fists to hide the reddened, scabbing scrapes at the base of his palms, then raised one hand in surrender before crossing his arms and leaning back in his chair.
“Not Sherlock, no,” Mycroft said.  “I did, however, receive a rather concerning text message from Detective Inspector Lestrade.”
But Sherlock stomped off with a laugh, saying only babies had daddies, and he left his little brother in the mud.  The bunny would be fine; he would no doubt be found by an overprotective and worried Mycroft.
Sherlock closed himself in his old bedroom, collapsing onto the narrow old mattress and not missing the crinkling of the old plastic sheet that had never been removed.  It calmed Sherlock rather than embarrassed him, and he allowed himself a quick moment of comfort, hugging his gifted sweater--it really did seem like something John would wear on a quiet Sunday morning at Baker Street--to his chest and allowing the knuckle of a finger to make its way into his mouth.
Poor Bunny has a lot to deal with in this chapter as an older Sherlock (around 7 or 8 years old, with more reservations than the younger version of himself he's been in the past few chapters) is forced to come to terms with Bunny's new ability to express himself in "girly" ways.  The chapter hasn't been edited, so I apologize for any typos--I'll come back later after work and edit out any mistakes.
John had to be foolish to think that just because Sherlock had forgiven him he had forgiven Mycroft.  There was a history there that colored the situation differently.
There was a long moment when he sat still and ashamed, feeling the pulse of his heartbeat strong in his throat as he fought back tears.  He’d been so sure he could hold it, so adamant that he wasn’t some little kid, and now he’d gone and peed all over himself and the floor just for some stupid video game.  What was he going to do?
“I’m sorry I pulled my blankie away from Sherlock and pushed and hurted him,” Bunny mumbled, glancing down at the floor to keep Daddy from seeing that he was about to cry.  “And I’m sorry I didn’t listen again when you told me to go to timeout.”
“I’m not actually a child, Mycroft,” Sherlock snapped.  “I don’t need you mother-henning me.  Leave me alone.”
Another train had come and gone before John was relieved to recognize Greg’s car in the pick-up lane in the parking lot.  The past hour and a half had been filled with little more than John’s own struggles against self-deprecating thoughts--shame over abandoning Harry when she needed him, guilt over pulling Greg away from family celebrations on Christmas Eve, deep-seeded shame about the deep pull he was feeling to be young--and he was rather exhausted by the effort.
“That man,” Sherlock said, reaching to point towards the window at the only man walking down Baker Street in the middle of the night.  “Tourist.”
Then again, John had to admit that he had not been able to keep from thinking just how much he wanted to lie in a dark room with his comfort items when he arrived back to Baker Street, snuggled up in bed with his stuffed lion and, as long as the door was locked, his pacifier.  He could not help but blush in embarrassment over how much he wanted the comfort.
John was jerked awake by a feeling that he was being watched.  He immediately sat up and reached to pull open the drawer of his bedside table, feeling around for his gun before realizing that he was not in his room at Baker Street, and that it was Mycroft who had been watching him, Mycroft who was currently approaching him from where he’d been seated.
He said goodnight to Greg before rolling over and closing his eyes.  He rubbed his new baby blanket against his nose and tried not to think too much about what would happen if he were to wet the pull-up between his legs.
When he didn’t see her, he took out his mobile to give her a call, not particularly surprised when she didn’t answer.  She often made large-scale plans for themed dinner parties and multi-course meals when company was visiting, and although she rarely pulled them off without John or someone else stepping in to take over the multitude of steps she had forgotten, it was endearing that she made the effort.  He left a quick message, telling her he had arrived and would be waiting whenever she’d finished seasoning whatever ridiculous dish she’d chosen to serve alongside the overly decorative desserts.
Sherlock glared at Mycroft and stormed out of his bedroom with the towel clutched in his hand.  Mycroft heard the man stomp down the hallway and then listened as the bathroom door was closed and the shower turned on.  He shifted his attention to John, who seemed to have fallen back to sleep.  The man looked so innocent and calm while sleeping that Mycroft was unsure of John’s current headspace.
“Sherlock Holmes, what is the meaning of this?” he asked, storming into the room and yanking Sherlock from the bed by the arm.  “Wetting yourself like an uncivilized urchin.”
It was when Mycroft attempted to stand and leave the room that Sherlock found himself involuntarily keening in the back of his throat.  Both brothers paused, neither able to process what Sherlock’s longing, desperate sound meant.  They blinked at each other for a moment.
“I have to potty, Uncle Greg,” John said, liking the feel of the word in his mouth, wanting to use it more.  He pressed a hand between his legs just to play the part, just to be the little boy still learning.
Sherlock was silent and still, his face whitening from pain while John placed four stitches along one slash and six along another; he knew Sherlock preferred even numbers to odd.
“No,” Greg said, suddenly raising his voice and standing up straighter.  “You can’t let that happen, Donovan.  It will compromise the case.  You need---”
The little detective squirmed for only a moment as Mycroft settled the boy’s weight and long limbs into a comfortable position on his hip.  He had grown accustomed to carrying John and needed to readjust for his brother’s proportions.  Sherlock hid his face against Mycroft’s neck, obviously ashamed, as Mycroft carried him down the hallway towards the boy’s bedroom.  Sherlock's skin was a bit sweaty; it was clear Sherlock had been warm and uncomfortable for quite some time before Mycroft had woken up.
He had exhausted the patience of the men in the front seat by asking that same question far too many times in the space of fifteen minutes.  Sherlock huffed to signal his distress to the men in the front seat and then let his head fall back against the headrest.
The boy was obviously not in a space where he was able or willing to talk about his feelings.  It was very possible the boy himself hadn’t been able to put his emotions fully into words up to that point.  After all, John generally processed his emotions about headspace while adult, discussing his feelings with Mycroft over late night tea or whiskey.  There had not been a chance for John and Mycroft to discuss what John was thinking through since they’d all gone back to their everyday lives after the weekend at the lake.
As it was, he didn’t have the energy to care that he was being insensitive.  All he knew was that he had tried to be accepting of Bunny but had only become confused.  All he knew was that she had teased him and was telling him what to do, and that he didn’t feel big enough to understand what that meant.
“It leaked, princess,” Greg said by way of explanation, lifting the soiled nightgown up and over Bunny’s head and leaving the boy in nothing but a saturated, sagging pull-up.
Bunny got a bit upset, teary because he was afraid he’d need to take off his Ariel nightshirt, but Papa just stripped him of the nightshirt and rinsed the tiny spot that had gotten wet on the hem in the sink before helping him into a new pull-up and letting him put the nightshirt back on.  Sherlock could see that Mycroft was not exactly pleased, but Papa kissed him and said something about risk and reward,  "reward in this case meaning a happy kid and no tantrums before bedtime."
Also, I'm writing Weekend at the Lake as we go, but I do have a few other stories in this universe that are already written.  Should I post one or two of those now, even though they take place a bit later in the progression of the universe, or should I hold off and continue to post everything chronologically so it doesn't get confusing?  Let me know!
Sherlock seemed to be finished with his apology, but Bunny only glanced up at him with wide eyes.  Mycroft worried that it was too much for the boy, that the Bunny had slipped too much in headspace or would be too overwhelmed to respond.  He began to think he would need to step in.  But Bunny swallowed and reached a hand out towards Sherlock, passing him one of the plastic mermaid bath toys.
“John made me,” Sherlock mumbled, rubbing at an eye and edging closer to his bed and its rumpled bedclothes.
“With glitter stickers,” Bunny said, just realizing that maybe he’d have the chance to pick out the colors and the styles and the shapes.
But he found himself unable to begin the conversation he knew needed to be had.  Was he supposed to apologize for his behavior in headspace earlier that day? Should he explain that he and John had talked, that they were once and for all okay?  Did Mycroft expect him to be completely okay with the Daddy and little boy relationship he had formed with John?  Sherlock picked at the edge of one of the children’s band-aids on his hand.
“I think that sounds like a great idea, baby,” Greg said.  “I’ll talk it over with Daddy and remind him that you’re still just learning to use the potty.  Does that sound okay?”
John smiled at her conspiratorial tone and sat again--albeit a bit sheepishly--as she busied herself by putting away the dishes.  When she’d finished, she turned to him with a smile, but when her cheer shifted into concerned, John knew he must not be doing a particularly good job of hiding his current struggle against sleepiness and sadness.
“You realize I’m all wet,now, too.” Sherlock said when they had pulled apart from kissing to catch their breath.  The urine had spread across the bed to Sherlock, plastic sheet doing its job by not allowing any of the liquid to be soaked into the mattress.  “What are we going to do with you?”
“I don’t want you to,” Sherlock said, crossing his arms on the table and burrowing his face into them.  “I don’t like you.”
Papa nodded and, placing a heavy hand on his shoulder, settled Sherlock into the corner of the kitchen.  It was the first time all day Sherlock felt he was right where he was supposed to be.
Were Sherlock young, Mycroft would have threatened a spanking long ago or pulled off to the side of the road and cradled him in his lap until he felt comfortable telling Mycroft what was wrong.  But neither of those options were available to Mycroft at the moment.  Both coddling and tough love had the potential to aid in Sherlock’s regression, something Mycroft was trying very hard to steer away from.  This meant he was left with few options but disinterest, which was proving rather a challenge given Sherlock’s frustrating, distracting display.
“I’ll get Bunny settled, then it’s lunch and naptime,” Mycroft said, emphasizing naptime as if it were some kind of reward, and Greg smiled without opening his eyes, nodding as he angled his face towards the sunlight.
“Just like Harry Potter, buddy,” Mycroft assured, which finally earned him a smile from John.  But it was a smile which quickly faded.
Greg laughed, but did not object, nodding as he pushed in his chair at the table.  He was exhausted and more than ready for bed.
When at last he felt his bladder empty, he blinked back to awareness.  Mycroft had given him a semblance of privacy by looking away, which Bunny was grateful for, but now he was wet, and littler than ever, and he wanted his Daddy to cuddle.
“You’ve been testing my patience all day, Sherlock,” Mycroft said, peppering his statements with harsh slaps to Sherlock’s arse.
Bunny whined a bit in the back of his throat, but then nodded when Greg took his hand and squeezed it for reassurance.
He could sense that Sherlock was repeating apologies because he was waiting to be told he was forgiven, waiting to be assured that it would all be forgotten.  But Sherlock needed to understand that harming himself was not an acceptable coping mechanism.  Greg and Mycroft had long ago spoken about the response Sherlock needed: comfort and assurance without false promises or indulgence.
Sherlock gave the briefest of smiles before stepping into the briefs and letting himself be dressed in shorts and a t-shirt.  Mycroft retrieved Sherlock’s stuffed alligator and stuffed dinosaur from where Sherlock had left them in his bed last night--the boy had not been nearly as young last night, while caring for a regressed John, and thus had not brought them into the master bedroom.
It was Mycroft who gave in, impatient and unable to go a moment longer without yanking Greg’s boxer briefs down his legs.  His arousal didn’t stop him from teasing Greg a bit about the precum stain at the crotch, however, and Greg found himself suddenly pink-cheeked, nevermind the fact that Mycroft’s boxers were likely in the same state.  It had been over two weeks since they’d been able to coordinate time for sex.
“It’s a new day and you’re a big boy,” Mycroft said, caring more for his brother’s self-esteem at the moment than for upholding the household rules.  The dinosaur briefs were training pants, reinforced with extra fabric in case of leaks, but Mycroft knew the boy still saw them as big boy undies, and that was what mattered.
Mycroft smirked as he walked from the bathroom to find Greg--still in his coat--with an armful of half-naked John.  He could see that Greg was exhausted--he’d been working himself far too hard in order to please a new superior--but, with Bunny in his arms, he could see Greg was at least content, comforted.
Their little Bunny was hunched in the middle of the bathroom, tears streaming down his face.  His jeans were dark with wetness down both legs.  The boy held a hand to his crotch and turned away in an attempt to hide his accident, but there was no concealing what had happened.  He looked rather pitiful, soaked down to his socks and standing in a puddle of urine as he cried.
“I don’t need to talk, Mycroft,” he said, knowing the man on the other end of the phone call was saying more with his silence than he ever could with words.
“I wasn’t thinking,” John said, hoping his boyfriend knew that what he was really confessing was that he felt awful for not thinking of anyone except himself.
“I’m not sure I’m strong enough for two little monkeys,” Uncle Greg said, a bit of amazement in his voice.
Sherlock chose to ignore his older brother’s warning tone and instead began combing through the mud with his fingertips.  If he couldn’t find frogs at least he might be able to find interesting insect species.
“I’m proud of you for calling me, Sherlock,” Papa said after a moment.  “I know it isn’t always easy to ask for help.”
“Not exactly,” John said with a smile.  “You need to listen to her ideas and respect her opinions, but what do you think you could do if you don’t want to do what Bunny wants to do?”
Mycroft sighed.  Of course John’s hesitancy came from a concern of imposing himself upon or inconveniencing others.  The truth of the matter was, Mycroft enjoyed caring for Sherlock in his little state, and he had no doubt he would enjoy caring for John just as much.  Returning to the little semblance of domesticity he found when caring for Sherlock allowed him an escape from the stress of work and alleviated the loneliness he would never admit to Sherlock he did often feel.  Adding John into the mix would simply add a new dynamic; Mycroft enjoyed new challenges, and if he were honest with himself, he wouldn’t mind the additional affection from a new little who looked up to him for his needs.
Sherlock compromised: he turned to face Mycroft but simply crouched down where he stood at the edge of the lake, eyes turned toward the ground.
His brother took in the information with a quiet hum of acknowledgement, scanning Greg’s face searchingly.
“Can you pretty please stay with me until I fall asleep?” John asked, still sitting on the toilet with his pants down around his ankles.
“I wanted to make you feel bad,” Sherlock admitted at last, fiddling with the hem of his shirt and wishing he were wearing his coat, which always made him feel safe and strong.  “I was sad because you were so happy, and Papa and Mycroft were going to make you a princess.”
“Sit down for snack,” Mycroft said, “and then maybe the strongest man in the world with a bad back will help us build a blanket fort or two.  How does that sound?”
John glanced around the pub.  It was a quiet night, and those who were still around seemed far too drunk or absorbed with their own issues to notice two blokes sitting together in a booth.  John allowed himself to settle back down into his half-drunk state, and slipped into the seat beside Sherlock.
Mycroft was quick to deny the child’s assumption, smiling as he attempted to focus Bunny’s attention away from himself.
Maybe it was less than adult to allow himself to bask in just how good it felt to have his effort acknowledged, but John was too exhausted from the emotional strain of the day to give it much thought.  Greg’s hand on his lower back, however, made him long for cuddles and his baby blanket.  He stepped away from the touch to keep himself from the pull in his stomach telling him to collapse into Papa’s chest with a needy whine.
“Me too?” John asked, tugging on Mycroft’s shirt.  He had never liked chocolate milk, and had refused it earlier that night, when Uncle Greg had offered it to him and Sherlock, but now that Sherlock seemed to like it so much, now that he saw how happy it had made Sherlock, he thought maybe he’d try it again.
“That’s enough, now,” he said, taking a breath and shifting to lift Sherlock’s head towards him, hands on either side of the man’s face.  “None of that was your fault.  You didn’t take him away, did you?  Didn’t lock him up?”
It was a bit like the day at the zoo--he felt, more than anything, a desire to give in to the feelings of helplessness.   Needing to go but staying exactly where he was next to Uncle Greg would let him to sink deeper into headspace, would allow him to feel vulnerable in a way he rarely allowed himself to get.  The thoughts crowding his mind were eliminated when he became solely focused on his bladder, and not having to think about how much he missed Mycroft or where Sherlock was or how long Uncle Greg would let him stay little was rather appealing at the moment.
“Something must be really wrong if you’re dismissing capitalism,” Greg said, and Mycroft, with the hint of an exasperated eye roll, smiled.
But introducing a sister into the picture--one who, despite Sherlock’s current age would be more often than not the younger sibling to Sherlock, just as Eurus was--had the potential for disaster.  Ageplay was a coping mechanism for Sherlock, a time for him to escape the stress and turmoil of his constantly moving mind.  It was hard enough for Sherlock to allow himself the release of being truly young.  This had the potential to change that, to alter what it was Mycroft and Sherlock had been practicing for essentially all of Sherlock’s life.
From anyone else, Greg may have read judgement into the statement.  From his brother, who dealt in honesty and bluntness as a default, however, he read only curiosity.
“‘Lock,” he said, tone expectant, still waiting for his brother to explain what had sent him scrambling up to his bed.
Mycroft hummed in disapproval of the destructive behavior, but refrained from speaking, waiting for the boy to go on.
Mycroft gently pulled Bunny’s thumb from their mouth and held the pacifier to their lips; the kid accepted it immediately.
“Sherlock,” Mycroft said in warning after a clearing of his throat, glancing at his brother in the passenger seat with a bit of surprise.  “None of that, now.”
Greg seemed to understand immediately what had happened.  He paused the movie and glanced down to where John knew there would be a wet spot surrounding him.
“Who?” John asked when Mycroft remained silent, surveying Sherlock as he waited for the man to speak further.  He needed to understand the boundaries of Sherlock’s insight before potentially letting on more than he needed to.

Bunny nodded.  He did know his Papa supported him, knew that his Papa was always looking out for the best.  But he couldn’t help but feel a pain at being taken away from his Daddy and his Sherlock.
Anyway, hope you enjoy the final chapter of this story!  It shifts between John and Mycroft's perspectives and there are definite warnings for omorashi as John processes his feelings towards wetting.
“Want me to come with you?” John asked, and it took a raised eyebrow from Sherlock for John to realize how much that would derail a Holmes brothers conversation, given the current state of his briefs.
But Bunny didn’t move, instead pulling his knees to his chest and wrapping his arms around his legs.  He was crying once more, silent except for a sniffle as tears fell.
As Sherlock prattled on about the Blue whale--Phylum: Chordata, Class: Mammalia, Order: Cetacea--Bunny tried not to shift too much on the bed.  He yawned, ready to fall asleep in the familiar comfort of Sherlock’s shared space.  But there was a pressure low in his tummy, distracting him.
Sherlock shrugged, but there was defiance in his eyes when he looked up.  He was definitely fully adult again, and reveling in mischief.
It took a moment for John to process that the man was waiting for his answer.  The close bodies and sparkling christmas ornaments and the cups of warm cinnamon cider had been a distraction from any self-deprecation he had felt earlier that day.  But beneath every meeting and greeting had been the underlying guilt of Harry, drunk in her new apartment, alone apart from a girlfriend obviously incapable of emotionally supporting her.  He blinked up at Greg, then cleared his throat to find his voice.
The phone clicked off and John was left staring at a tense, shivering Sherlock.  The man looked pitiful, standing in his wet trousers, cheeks flushed as he cried slow, silent tears every few moments.  Without the distraction of the phone call to Mycroft, John felt out of place, unsure of himself.
To say that Mycroft had his hands full getting Sherlock to make it through Christmas Day was an understatement.  His little brother had chosen to fight headspace with snarkiness, and was taking out his frustration and lack of confidence on their poor parents.
Uncle Greg put Sherlock to bed in the spare cot while he began stripping the twin bed of the wet sheets.  He used the dry edges of the sheet to sop up the puddle of urine pooled on the plastic mattress cover.  The cot was too short for Sherlock, and his feet hung off the end.  There also wasn't a mattress cover on the cot, and Sherlock worried about what would happen if he wet the bed again.  Uncle Greg and Mycroft had made up the cot in case Bunny got scared in the night, the memory of which only made Sherlock think about where the Bunny was actually sleeping.  He felt something more than sadness at that moment, he felt anger.  Angery because Mycroft was his and because the Bunny was supposed to come sleep with him if he got scared, not with Mycroft, and because the cot didn't have a stupid babyish mattress cover on it because Bunny didn't need that like Sherlock did.  Nothing seemed fair.
He felt worse when he checked the master bedroom and realized he'd never changed the sheets from Sherlock's mishap that morning, just one more thing Greg would be upset with him about.  After checking Bunny's room to find it empty, he made his way to the guest bedroom, knowing Greg would not have simply taken the kids out of the house without telling him.  Mycroft may have been irresponsible in his care of Sherlock that afternoon, but Greg was nothing if not conscientiously by-the-book.
He’d leaned into the vulnerability out of convenience; it was far easier to deal with wetting his old twin bed at his parents’ house while he was little than while he was adult.  He could cry and whine and cling to Mycroft in the laundry room without his brother so much as batting an eye.  It had made aging up a rather difficult, too-quick affair, however, and he’d suffered the consequences all morning, living in a rather draining in-between state.
Greg glanced up at Mycroft and sighed, but Mycroft could see from the release of tension in the Detective Inspector’s shoulders and the softness in his eyes that the statement, to Greg, had been more than a passing quip.
“That’s sweet of you, kiddo,” Mycroft said as he placed Bunny back on the living room couch with a kiss to his forehead.
Bunny turned his back on his Daddy and dove back down to the bed to hide his face in his pillow.  He could feel the irritation on his tongue, had felt it since he’d woken up and knew it was worse than yesterday, but he wanted his pacifier more than he wanted his tongue to stop hurting, and he knew he wouldn’t be allowed to keep it once Daddy saw the sore.
“Okay, okay.  I’m not going anywhere,” Mycroft said, rubbing Sherlock’s back as he took a seat on the bed, cradling his brother as comfortably as he could given Sherlock’s long limbs.
Sherlock grunted in what may have been an acknowledgement of John’s question but was likely only a tactic meant to get John to leave him alone.
Greg’s mum was paused at the entrance to the room, a stack of plates carried in front of her and a dishtowel flung over her shoulder.  John sat up straight, letting his knees fall as his feet dropped to the floor.  He blinked his eyes rapidly in an attempt to keep them from looking watery.
He could not help but hear Mycroft’s voice in the back of his mind telling little boy Bunny to take his own advice and stand up for himself against the more domineering little Sherlock, but John ignored it.  Today had been the day he’d finally felt comfortable enough to be his true little girl self around Sherlock.  There were only so many personal successes he could reach in one day.
But Mycroft had been surly and aloof and loathe to involve himself in the family drama at the time, insisting on burying himself in his books.  The drama belonged to Eurus and Sherlock and Sherlock’s little friend, and was thus too childish for Mycroft to take much interest.  It was not until Eurus’s sing-song rhyme had become the background of their lives for a very trying week, and then, not long after, she set the fire that sent her away, that Mycroft realized he may have been too flippant about the entire ordeal, too quick to assure himself there were others dealing with the problem, too self-involved and cold.
“Okay, big boy,” Mycroft said.  “Is it okay if you put Uncle Greg on the phone so I can talk to him for a moment, love?  I’ll talk to you again after I speak with him, okay?”
“Five more minutes and then you go wash up for dinner, ‘Lock,” Mycroft called into the other room, warning his brother in advance that playtime would soon be over.  Even adult Sherlock disliked sitting down for a meal; without proper warning, calling little Sherlock to come eat could lead to some of the most wild tantrums they'd faced.
“Good boy,” Mycroft said, patting John’s thigh to signal to him that he needed to get up from the bed so that they could get started.
Bunny gave a last little whine before rolling over to snuggle his stuffed rabbit beneath his neck as he went back to sleep, pacifier bobbing once more.
Sherlock blinked up at his brother and sighed.  There was a part of him still desperate to express his distress to his brother, a part of him ready to pout until Mycroft took him in his lap to comfort him.  But John was expecting him to hold an adult conversation with Mycroft.  If John were there, he would encourage him to talk with Mycroft about his feelings of betrayal.  He would tell him he should explain to Mycroft his fears of being left out.  He would prod him to apologize for aligning himself with Greg just to make Mycroft jealous.
Mycroft sighed.  Here were John’s worries on display. Mycroft wished he could make the man understand that nothing John could do would disappoint him.
Sherlock whined when the first spank hit, but he was rather eager to be put in his place.  He didn’t want to regulate his emotions any longer, didn’t want to keep navigating an in-between headspace.
“And Bunny was a mermaid who helped the pirates find the treasure,” he said as he chewed, prompting Mycroft to remind him not to talk with his mouth full.
Hi, loves!  Sorry for the delay in updating--I had a few different ideas for how this chapter would go so it took a bit longer to make decisions and get it all down into writing.  Not to mention I'm in a bit of a transition time in my own life so there's been a bit of chaos.  Thanks for the support you've all already shown about this new storyline!
“You can be as big or as little as you’d like,” Mycroft said, and Sherlock knew the comment was not just for John.  “It’s for the best if you wear big boy clothes when you go to the store.  But what you’d like to wear underneath is your decision.”
“I’m fine, Sherlock,” John said, “Nothing’s wrong.  I just woke up because Mycroft and Greg are going to bed.”
It was more than he usually got from a man who chose his words exceedingly carefully, but Greg waited for him to go on, knowing that Mycroft wasn’t being entirely accurate in his personal assessment that he was ‘fine.’
His Daddy brought him into his bedroom to dress him in sweatpants and a long-sleeved shirt and a jumper.  Bunny turned away the first jumper he’d chosen, telling his Daddy it was too itchy but really not wanting it because it was maroon, which was a bit too close to pink.  He could tell his Daddy was watching him and had questions in his mind, but Bunny was glad he didn’t say anything as he pulled out a navy blue jumper and strung it over Bunny’s arms.
“Fine,”John said. And when the others looked at him with surprise or confusion or a mixture of both, he cleared his throat and shrugged it off.  “If it’ll keep me from sitting next to a puddle of urine halfway through the car ride,” he joked, “it’ll be worth it.”
Mycroft opened the bathroom door to find himself face to face with Greg, who was bringing a dry change of clothes for John.  Mycroft could see a bashful Sherlock hiding behind Greg, dressed in his dinosaur pajamas, his thumb in his mouth.
“The baby couldn’t sleep,” Sherlock whispered.  “He was crying so I rubbed his back and recited the periodic table for him for a while, but it didn’t stop him crying..”
“Let’s get you back to--” the intimidating, bearded man paused as he caught sight of who was actually at the top of the steps, immediately realizing his mistake.
Sherlock knew he’d disappointed Mycroft and Papa.  They’d had the conversations before, had discussed the fact that there were no such things as girls’ games or boys’ games in the same way they’d discussed that colors were simply colors and anyone could wear whatever clothing they wanted to.  They’d explained that there was nothing abnormal about following what was in your heart and acting accordingly.  Sherlock supposed it was true, and if Bunny hadn’t have been acting so differently or if Mycroft and Papa hadn’t seemed to have spent all of their attention on Bunny that morning, maybe he would have felt less squirmy about the prospect of having to play house with this new version of Bunny.
Greg leaned forward, hugging Mycroft and pressing his forehead in the crook of the man’s neck.  He was extremely happy that their little family was all together again.  But he knew that two young kiddos both coming down with colds meant the next day would bring fresh challenges, and at the moment all he wanted was sleep.
Bunny cried harder at the thought of standing naked except for a wet pull-up, feeling vulnerable and little and not at all like a big, brave boy.
When John pulled away after a long moment, Mycroft placed a hand on John’s shoulder and held him at arm’s length.
“Bored,” Sherlock drawled, sending one final and forceful kick against the back of Greg’s seat before dropping his feet down into the footwell of the car gracelessly.
Bunny didn’t answer, and Greg couldn’t help but notice the boy was once more close to tears.  Perhaps the kid had waited until the last moment to tell him, and was worried he wouldn’t be able to make it?  He was grateful when they passed a sign for a rest area just ahead, making sure to pull-off the expressway.  Luckily, the parking lot was nearly empty, and he was able to find them a parking spot close to the entrance.
The contents of the various plaster boxes were scattered across the sink.  Sherlock had let the towel drop from where Greg had wrapped it around his shoulders, seemingly unconcerned with nudity as he presented his chosen plasters.
Mycroft felt pained to hear that John had been crying but pleased that Sherlock had felt comfortable providing emotional comfort in his own way. John must have been more conflicted and upset by the day’s events than he had originally thought.
Bunny looked distraught at the prospect of parting with his friends, but Greg was firm, knowing that he needed to mean business were the kid to feel the full effect of the punishment, and Bunny passed them over.
He knew the boy was desperate for comfort and cuddles, but Mycroft also needed to get straight answers from the little bunny, and he couldn’t risk setting the boy off to crying again.  Although it hadn’t seemed to be the case throughout the day, Bunny generally responded to pragmatism with pragmatism.  Mycroft hoped he was enough himself again to participate in a rational conversation.  He allowed Bunny to rest his head against his thigh, but pressed the boy’s hand down firmly when he tried to put his thumb in his mouth again.
“Want to see the zoo ducks,” John said, tugging down on his pajama shirt as Mycroft guided him to step out of his pajama pants.
“That’s enough,” Greg was calling over the taunts and epithets as he elbowed his way towards the men at the center of the action.  “Break it up.”
But then, without warning, he felt himself beginning to cry.  His face crumpled as he sunk down in his chair and he began to wail.  Greg was beside him in a moment, rubbing his back and telling him it would all be okay.
“Be a good boy,” Sherlock called over his shoulder as he stepped into the bathroom, teasing John for the way he’d earlier responded to such comments.
“So, about that praise kink…” Sherlock said before both men had even had time to catch their breath.
“Hold it,” Sherlock said, dismissing Bunny’s need.  “You don’t have time to go now.  We’re about to go to war.”
I also want to apologize for not responding to all of your lovely comments--I let myself get behind, but I promise I will catch up soon!
John didn’t know whether to cry or to cum, Sherlock’s sweetness and the warm bulk between his legs making him feel vulnerable but stimulated.  He focused on letting his bladder release fully, legs spread around Sherlock as the liquid pooled hot between his legs before being absorbed.
Sherlock could stand it no longer.  He was trapped in the car and felt nothing but anger, frustration, and helplessness.  Kicking Greg’s seat forcefully, he could not help but yell.
Sherlock knew what Mycroft was trying to do.  He knew his brother used to get him to list the elements as a way of calming Sherlock’s mind.  The memories were there, in his mind palace: Mycroft rubbing his back and asking him to list the periodic table when they were kids after Sherlock had been woken up by a nightmare.  Sherlock thought about stating once again that he wasn't a little kid, but he was warm and comfortable with the Bunny leaning up against him, and he didn’t feel like he should wake up his little brother just to gain himself some more attention.  Besides, he did feel little at the moment, and, in the safety of the car with his little brother and his Mycroft and his Uncle Greg, that was okay.  So he closed his eyes and began listing the elements one by one until Mycroft called him a smart boy and he fell fast asleep.
