"Summoning?" Sam questioned. "Who are we summoning?"
Dean eventually woke up, the dim light from the window hurting his eyes even when they were closed. He complained incoherently, but no-one replied.
He unbuttoned his shirt, throwing it on the pile. Dirty. He pulled off his undershirt too, throwing it down. He took a deep breath, steadying himself, closing his eyes and trying not to see
"I go in the front. Distract her."
Dean was looking out of the window. He didn't want Cas to see his face, or his eyes, which were currently a little too shiny. He blinked away the slight moisture. Damnit, that angel was beginning to chip away at his boundaries... again.
"Hmmmm" She hummed, sharp brown eyes opening to meet his. "Just how Cassie imagined."
"I had a rough day-"
“This body feels… better.” He trailed fingertips along his arm, and Dean can’t help but follow the movement, watching that slow tickle. He’s pretty sure Cas isn’t being deliberately sensual, but wow. “It didn’t fit, when I first… lost my grace.” His movements halted. “Like I was pressed up against the skin, everything felt raw, sharp.”
"I bet the child support on that is a bitch." Dean joked, and Castiel frowned.
"Why do you care? You hate the guy." She shrugged, looking at the hunter. She paused when she saw his face, though, and broke into a wide, triumphant smile. "Oh! You're beginning to get the warm fuzzies all over again! Mozeltov!"
“No, but he will be.”
A powerful creature.
He did. "What're you doing?"
“It’s not fine. It’s not safe.”
Dean hummed in thought. If Sam was telling the truth, which he guessed he had no reason to doubt, Cas really was ready to get out there. He held his own and kept his cool, by the sounds of it. Though, was pretty pissed at Dean, which he only deserved about 60% of, in Dean’s estimation.
"infernalis adversarii, omnis legio, omnis congregatio et sectra diaolica," he yelled out, making sure it could reach as many demons as possible, remembering how Sam and he got out of a similar situation a few years ago. "Ergo draco maledicte et omnis legio diabolica adj-"
Dean blinked, taking his hand away, leaning back quickly, as if he had realised something. The air around them seemed to have changed imperceptibly, slightly cooler, and Cas frowned.
The flash of pain from his upper back distracted him for a second, and Dean checked him, but didn’t let go of his arm, satisfied no real damage was being done. “So sue me.” Dean replied, grinning down at him, and Cas watched him, waiting for his next move. He was pinned, sure, a difficult position to get out of, but not impossible. He could push against Dean’s ribcage at the right angle with his free hand, push his hips up and slip Dean off-balance, throw him off. It might work, though Dean could easily combat it, could pin his other hand. He could fight his way out of this, but instead… he waited.
Dean sighed, opening his door and climbing out the car, gesturing for Cas to follow, walking forwards so Cas had no choice but to follow. Which he did, because what else has Cas ever done? Cas hurried to catch up with him, seeing Dean join the line for entrance, looking for all the world like he fit right in.
"Dean," Sam began, not sure what to say.
"Do?" Castiel replied, squinting in the light.
"Plaid is..." Dean began, before snapping round, holding up his hand to Cas. "You tell anyone I gave you fashion advice and you're finding a new set of stupidly patient hunters to live with."
“Nah.”
“No. Not happening.”
“How was your first hunt, Cas?”
It fell into one of his two favourite categories of bars. The first were the 'chick bars', often used for hen-nights or where women met up with their friends. These bars usually sold plenty of cocktails, and were generally female friendly. These were the bars Dean would go to when he wanted some company for the night.
He heard footsteps coming up behind him, and he turned slightly to see Cas walked into his vision. He smiled, feeling that comfortable rush come over him as he registered him, undercut with a hint of nervousness that just wasn’t shifting these days. “See anything you like?”
Dean never took another sip from the half drunk bottle of beer. It lay forgotten on the carpet, partially spilt, completely forgotten, a sticky mess that clung until Sam noticed, days later, and cleaned it up. It took a week to get through all the bottles in the fridge between the three of them, a new record.
from his heart before he drank. The food arrived a little while after, and their conversation flowed easily enough, years of being in each others company making this easy. They talked about the town, about the bunker, about Sam, about what Agent Ballard wanted, about the food. Dean snuck a bite from Cas’s plate, and Cas let him, just happy to see him happy.
"Iron." Dean clarified. "In case old Hilda attacks."
He might not have been Sam's angel, he might not have had the profound bond that his brother had with the guy, but he still loved him. They were still friends.
"Quit whining." Dean snapped.
His thoughts were interrupted when he saw movement outside. Bill was leaving his house and getting into a car parked out front.
"He wants to see his friend!" Sam grinned, slapping his hands down onto his thighs as he rose up from the bed. "He'll be here any minute."
He pulled the trigger, too quickly for her to stop him.
They did leave the bedroom eventually, especially when their stomachs rumbled and they ran out of water. Dean kept the robe, but threw Cas some comfy pants and the new hooded sweater he’d bought, and Cas looked downright adorable. As they left the room Dean felt a surge of trepidation, like they were breaking the spell they were under, like every other hook up he’d had when the afterglow had popped and it became a ticking clock of
. Am I right?” She pointed at the two of them. “Talk to me about the bank shooting a few months back.”
Cas thought of Bobby. "I know. And I will help stop it."
Dean shrugged. "Whatever you hit first."
As he looked into Cas's eyes, he couldn't quite bring himself to step back, step away from his friend. He could feel the soft tickle of his breath against his face. He should be moving back, brushing it off with some macho joke, get a beer, shoot some pool, watch some porn and jerk off in the shower. This wasn't what he did. He didn't do this.
He needed to sort this, and fast.
"You could call him?" Cas suggested, and was confused when Sam looked up at him, sadness in his eyes.
When he went back downstairs, he found Sam Sitting at the table, bottle of whisky beside him and a needle and thread in his hand. Dean frowned and walked over, shaking his head.
“Wow, this place is the bomb.” He heard, and looked up to see Charlie walking in, looking round in awe.
“We could risk some of these tins.” Sam picked up what looked to be a can of sardines, and they both grimaced. Not the fish, definitely not the fish.
Dean glanced to Cas, who was watching Dean's movements with the spoon carefully, studying how he moved the ingredients in the pot. Dean smiled, giving the spoon back. "Don't get your panties in a twist, Sammy." Dean mocked, patting Cas on the back, immediately stopping when he caught his friends wince. "Damn, I'm sorry." He said, hand hovering a few inches away.
to Dean, mouth slightly parted. Dean looked away, eyes back to the paper. "Time for some target practice."
“You guys are cute.” Sam said as they walked through the door.
The pattern began to burn into the floor, and the Winchesters turned to spare a glance, finally aware something was happening.
Locating the small silver charm, dulled by the years since Bobby had given it to them after Sam had been possessed. Shaking off the memory, he slammed the trunk, twisting the chain along his fingers, swinging the weighted end as he walked back up the steps and into the cabin. Waving it to Sam as he walked past, he closed the door behind him, and trudged up the stairs leading to the bedroom.
"He'll take the suit." Dean said, stepping back to the chair, wiping his palms on his jeans.
He headed back to his room, closing the door behind him and took the box out of his pocket. The box was black, simple, nothing to write home about. He flicked it open, feeling the springs bounce, but the ring stayed put, wedged firmly in the cushions. He looked at the ring, and felt a wave of embarrassment surge against him; it had been stupid to buy this, who buys this crap so early on? Before your first date, even?
Cas left the kitchen, arm full of clothes for him to put away, a paper bag full of CD’s for him to sort through. He would be busy for a while. Dean pulled a soda out of the fridge, sitting down at the kitchen table and started picking at the tab. He could ask Cas out for dinner tonight. Could tell him tonight. Make his move and see if Cas was still down… tonight.
“She killed her partner instead.” Sam finished.
“Oh.” Dean had wondered about this, the way he had reacted when he got his first papercut. “So the tattoo?”
He dropped the smaller one back on the rack, before holding the other up for Cas to inspect. "Okay, what do you think?"
Dean shrugged, plastering a cocky smile on his face. “Don’t know what you’re talking about.”
"But we don't have a choice. Channel your boredom into Cas, or something." Sam shrugged, keeping an eye on Dean, who looked away with a scoff. "Unless this is about something else."
Wasn’t that something, an offer of stability, of a future, of a way out of this life? Just like Mom wanted, just like he’d tried before. He could have one foot in the real world, a legitimate job, could pay taxes, could retire on a sunny island… he didn’t know how much things cost.
Moving kisses from her lips, he began down her jaw and her neck, pausing to nibble there, sucking gently, leaving tiny bruises.
“-who reads about mass murderers and runs
Cas nodded, looking away as well. He took the steps forward to take his items from Dean, no skin contact as it was passed over, and Cas went to leave. Dean cleared his throat, and Cas paused, glancing back in.
Sammy, are you okay?” Dean barked out - they were still a couple of miles out, he could be there in minutes.
He never thought he’d been holding himself back. But right then, standing in front of Cas at that farmers market, saying “I don’t know”? He knew what that meant, he knew it was concrete. He didn’t know the end game, but he knew it wasn’t a no. This was him saying he wanted this, that he wanted Cas, that he had been denying himself something. It wasn’t a yes, yet, but it sure as hell wasn’t a no. Not deep down.
Cas took the finger out of his mouth. "Will it heal?" He asked, concerned, but the hunter just continued to laugh, tears beginning to form in his eyes.
The angel did not turn.
Cas rolled his eyes. He had fought in wars for aeons, had torn humans apart long before anyone but the creator had any notion of the Winchester bloodline. Cas tested a smile, mirroring the cockiness he felt in Dean’s demeanor, and was rewarded with a flash of teeth.
Charlie paused to follow his words. “…to get laid? After he made a pass?”
"Crowley." Dean spat, and Sam's hand went instantly to the demon blade that he knew was in the waistband of his jeans. The king of Hell smiled at the two of them as if they were nothing more than children, before looking down at Castiel in the bed.
"Oh, they're necessary." Livvie smiled. "Those old rituals did need a lot of ingredients."
"Dean," Sam sighed from across the room, still sitting at his laptop, but enjoying the film nonetheless. "Let him go to bed. Look at him, he's exhausted!"
Dean's eyes dropped to Cas's chest. It wasn't moving any more.
He could hear Dean’s tone shift, even if he couldn’t hear the words. Dean sounded happier, could hear a laugh even. Dean and Charlie had clicked fast, similar in many ways, and her manner put Dean at ease. He had watched them laugh, getting to know each other, had seen the easy way they had physically interacted with each other in a way that was never easy between the two of them. She made him happy, he could see that.
Cas was sore. Really sore. His whole body
“I always keep a few in the trunk, you never know when you’ve got a sesh going and it calls for a bit of Eldritch Horror.”
Dean grabbed the pack, shuffling it fast and dealing between the two of them, slamming the pack back down and pointing to Cas and the hand dealt to him. “Right, lets go over this again.”
Dean coughed, and the memory of long bled blood spat out.
He wanted to give Cas everything, anything that would make Cas happy. Even if that was him. Especially if that was him. Even if he didn’t deserve Cas, even if Cas would grow tired of him and seek out better. He wanted Cas to have what would make him happy, and if that was Dean, who was he to refuse that?
"Who?"
? A long time ago, if he was being honest with himself. Somehow that felt gayer than finding him hot.
Doubling over in pain, not caring about the mud, he collapsed sideways, curling into a foetal position. His breathing was even heavier now, it seemed to be coming out in coughs and chokes and while did seem to be related to the screaming pain across his body, it felt like it was coming from another type of pain, one stemming straight from the shoves and words from the hunter across town.
Eventually he got out of the room, dressed, preened, and a hand shielding his eyes from the sun. Directly outside he saw Sam looking in the boot of the rusty car, which was somehow parked across three parking spaces. He felt a sense of pride that he, at least, had managed to get it home okay.
After a half hour more of this, they came inside, shivering from the cold. Sam had even made them both a coffee to warm them up. Cas had winced at the feeling off the hot mug against his icicle like fingertips, and began to revise the theory that the itching was worse than the cold. Though, as the first sip of the hot drink touched his tongue, warming him from the inside out, he found he couldn't bring himself to care.
“Dean….”
She asked.
asking if he had
Why couldn’t he?
“Being a doormat isn’t helping either. If you fall into a pattern like that you’ll never get anywhere. You were a warrior of God, I’ve seen you put him in his place. That’s the Cas he knows. He can handle being disagreed with. As for your “judgement”? ” Sam pointed at him with his bottle. “Yeah, you’ve tripped up a few times, who hasn’t? I got hooked on Demon blood, I thought I was doing the right thing. Just next time you’ve got a big idea to do something potentially stupid… talk to us first.”
In a few hours Dean would wake up from a nightmare, Sam knew, so he left to run in the meantime. He'd be back before sleeping beauty woke up.
"You used to like those." Sam pointed out.
"It's where he sent us." He replied.
Dean rolled his eyes, and after a second obliged. Cas opened her eyes briefly in thanks, but a bump in the road made her squeeze them shut again, her fists clenching tightly at her chest. They drove in silence, apart from the quiet music, for about ten minutes until Sam spoke.
Shut it down. He shook off the memory, gritting his fists as he felt that gnawing feeling inside him. Humiliation, rejection, regret.
Dean digested the words, and he could see what Sam meant. He’s been surprised by Lisa’s neighbours, Greg and Joe, but no one had blinked an eye about it. And on TV he saw, he’d see happy couples, or unhappy couples, but he’d see them. He hadn’t looked too closely at first, he’d just nodded along, but it was just another in a long set of things he hadn’t realised about the normal world. People were gay, or whatever, and everyone got over it.
And Cas just said…
"The cheeseburger's a house favourite." The girl smiled.
"He killed my Father." Livvie told her, still painting. "I think that's reason enough."
Dean undid his pants, reaching a hand in and touched himself, gripping tight and pulling himself out. He started jacking himself hard and fast, running his other hand along his scalp, pulling his hair at the top, scratching the nails along his neck. He came fast, catching it with his hand, the groan of
“A restaurant across town,” Dean said. “Looked like a nice place, figured you deserved somewhere good.”
"Wasn't me." Sam shrugged. "How's the head?"
And Dean didn’t stop him.
Dean was so determined to get there, he didn't care if he got himself killed in the process.
He checked on Sam, too. He had fallen asleep on the sofa in the library that Bobby had set up, the sheet slung over him, but apparently he'd rolled around in his sleep. By the time that Dean wandered into the room, the sheet was half on the floor, and Sam's arm was dragging on the floor. Dean smiled softly at the sight; that boy was too big for that sofa. He'd be better off on the floor.
"Yeah, Dean; exactly! We also shot his daughter through the chest with an arrow. He'll kill us if we summon him."
"I'm fine." Was the reply.
Dean smiled gently pulling their hands towards him and pressing a kiss to Cas’s knuckles. “Yeah, Cas. This is okay.”
Rufus's place may have been safe, may be salt lined and remote but it sure as hell wasn't safe enough. They had a couple of weeks, at most, before they needed to move. He could see himself getting cabin fever before then.
Dean nodded, setting his jaw. “I deserve that. But do you trust that I mean what I’m saying, right now?”
"You got an idea? I am all ears, Dean. I'm not saying this place is perfect, but right now, it's pretty damn safe."
Dean looked back at the road, and made a snap decision. "Fine." He said, turning the car around. "But if this is a wild goose chase, I'm holding you responsible."
So he filled up his flask and he returned. Sam didn't say anything, not even when he took the first sip. Now wasn't the time to readdress Dean's problem.
“What did you find?” Sam breathed.
"Of the shirt?"
"What?"
"Well, boys; seems like you had an ace up your sleeve." He commented, eyes glancing around for the angel. He knew it was only a matter of time before the feathery bastard appeared, and he weighed up his options. He could run, wink out before the halo-wearing dick showed up, feeling all smitey; or he could stick it out, stand toe-to-toe and stand his ground, and see if he could shove an angel-blade up a jugular while whisking out the prize. "An angel on the way, not bad. I'm flattered."
"You saw- you saw you calling me?" Dean repeated.
Glancing back at Cas he saw the pointed, but completely silent glare, obviously seething.
“Ah.” It rung with agreement. “You don’t find the same comfort here as Sam?”
"Or that it this place isn't about to fall down on top of us?"
“Did he get lucky at least?”
He leaned forwards, pressing a kiss to Cas’s lips, stepping in to his space and pressing palms to his waist. He felt Cas smile against him, answering hands warm around him, slipped under his jacket. The tip of Cas’s nose was cold against him, a little damp pressed into his cheek, and it was so damn human. “It’s cold out here, huh?”
"What next?"
He heard footsteps behind him, and he turned to see Dean coming back down the stairs, a bundle of clothes clutched in his hand, which he extended out to Cas.
"What do you mean 'gone'?"
He hadn't realised it had stayed; a constant reminder of all he had done for Dean. No, not for Dean; for humans. For free will, and family, and for life that he fought for that he now got to experience for himself. Dean wasn't so arrogant to believe it was for him.
“I don’t know what either of those things are.”
Cas softened, and Livvie continued.
Dean chuckled, leaning back and looking up at Cas, amused at the sight of the sleepy, slightly swaying man standing in front of him. Wearing some old clothes of Dean's, a tatty ACDC shirt and a too-long pair of brown sweatpants. He looked ridiculous, the sight of his forearms on show was unsettling. The outfit swamped him; he looked pale and withered in it.
Earlier it had been easier, somewhat. When it was an unfamiliar face looking at them, talking to them, it was easier. She may have spoken like Cas and been Cas inside, but she hadn't been the stark reality that he now was. Now, he was as he had ever been. He was once again the angel he had always known, the angel that had been Dean's friend. Except he wasn't.
Eventually bruised and bloody, and Garth with a minor puncture wound or two, the job was finished. Eight decapitated vampires lay around them, and the room was basically a blood bath. The smaller hunter picked himself from the floor, and grinned up and Sam.
Sam glanced to Dean as he pulled out the blade. "Not long."
“I was long corrupted by that point.” He told him, and Dean scoffed a laugh.
"She looked... human."
"I... I did not feel that I could tell Dean this. I expected he would react unfavourably."
"Cas?" Sam asked. "Were you asleep?"
“Yes, Dean.” Cas agreed. “I love you even then.”
“Grub’s almost up, get dressed.” Dean called, glancing over his shoulder to him. The breath caught in his throat as he watched Cas walk to the stairs, muttering an
"Yes." He said simply, glancing down at Dean. His modesty from earlier forgotten, he was half perched on the bed, a long leg stretched off, toes resting on the floor. He dragged his eyes back up, breathing slowing down as he looked at his friend. "I'm sorry for waking you." His voice was lower than usual, husky from sleep, from yelling in his nightmare, and Dean shook his head.
“No, I don’t think this ones on me.” Sam stood up, walking to the cooler and grabbing a couple of bottles, opening them off one another. “He’s worried about you.”
"Don't you get it?" She yelled. "Sure, body hopping and bad hair is annoying enough, but you know what really pisses me off?" She took another step forward, now nose to nose with Castiel. "When you flick through the memories of the asshole that's taking you for a ride, and you find out a little something."
Fuck, this was hard.
And the body? Silent. Still. Not a single reaction. They were already dead. Nothing Dean could do to them would ever hurt them. They weren’t in there any more.
"Pretty bad timing." Sam pointed out. "He isn't exactly in a position to defend himself, right now."
"Two floors up, supply cupboard." Sam reminded Balthazar. "Everything you need for a bomb."
“Coffee, black.” Diana ordered, glancing over the food options, and the waitress poured one before wandering off. “Never know what’s gonna be good in these places…” She sighed.
"Dean; your 'check engine' light is on." Cas pointed out.
"Oh give it a rest." She huffed. "It's a no-go. Go home and jerk off your fallen angel."
The angel had never cried before.
"Didn't you see me drive past the skeevy place in the last town?" He asked. "I won't let you get an infection or anything. You'll be fine." He looked properly at Cas's face, seeing the apprehension, the worry. His face screwed up as he also looked warily at the stretched lobes. "Trust me."
“Yes.” Cas agreed, guilt lacing his tone. “But I’m not talking about Crowley. I mean by humanity, I’d fallen for humanity.” He turned to face Dean properly, to hold his attention. “For you. I was able to process the physical in a way I never could before. Nothing in comparison to now, but still.”
“Right, yeah-” Shit, he’d been trying to avoid that, but it wasn’t like he could really call up Paul and ask.
But then Dean shook his head and patted the guy on the shoulder, before glancing back at Cas. He saw the word “friend” on Dean’s lips. The man looked Cas up and down, lingering at his collarbones, his crotch, before smiling at him. He leaned over and Cas could smell the alcohol on his breath. “
"Well, I saw her in earlier, she was talking to Tommy for a while..." The woman leant back and yelled. "Tommy!" There was no response, and she yelled again. "Tommy!" She frowned. "He's just in the back room." She went to go to the door, but it was suddenly opened, and a guy stuck his head out, face slightly flushed.
"Cas." Dean whispered, taking him in. "I am sorry, man, I am,"
And today? Dean tidied up. He picked up the trolley, checking the wheel as he rolled it back against the wall. He picked up the bowl, set it aside to clean it. He swept up the ashes that had dropped, and wiped up where the blood had tacked onto the floor. Sam would have no complaints, and by the time he saw him he’d have a smile plastered on his face.
"You were eavesdropping on little old ladies?" Dean scoffed as he slurped. "Dude, you gotta get a hobby."
"Another one?"
Sam had fallen asleep on his bed, a foot hanging off the end. Cas was sitting on the recliner reading what appeared to be a magazine on arts and crafts, but stood when Dean entered.
“Dean, would you just-” Sam pushed forwards, jamming past him and out into the open, completely unbothered by any concept of booby traps, and
Dean glanced over, and his eyes were shining. He shrugged slightly. “You tell me.”
"What?" Dean blinked. "You're saying we listen to a ghost? That only maybe exists? Do you hear yourself?"
Her dreams plagued her from the instant she closed her eyes. She saw it, she saw the Enochian sigil, wet and red. She saw the actions she needed to take, and she saw herself. She saw the part of herself that was missing, and she knew where it was.
"And we have next to nothing to protect ourselves with." Dean pointed out. "Great. Just, great."
Gingerly, he crawled up the wall, making his way up very carefully. He almost fell again, but held on tight, eventually scrambling onto the balcony. He could see through the window. He could see Sam against the wall, and he could see Livvie. He had a clear shot. He lifted the crossbow, aiming...
He would never admit it to Sam, but he knew he had changed. He'd toughened up, more so than before – he was almost unrecognisable from how he'd been all those years ago. Like Cas.
"You're playing games." He pointed at her with his bottle before taking another sip.
"Hey, Missouri." He smiled.
Dean swallowed. “Uh, with Crowley? With the deal?” Coward. Probably best not to ambush him over breakfast anyway.
"You'll catch a cold if you stay there much longer." A voice behind him softly announced. Cas didn't look round, he didn't have to. He'd know that voice anywhere.
"Yes, you do." He spat. "What do I do? How do I do it?"
On the outside Dean was quiet, hands gripping the steering wheel, watching the road intently. He hadn't spoken in half an hour, and the music lowly playing abated any need for conversation. But inside? Inside Dean was roiling. Again, again, again. Another safe haven, gone, the rug swept from under them, gone. Rufus's cabin reduced to ash, just like Bobby's, just like the Roadhouse. And Cas, knowing for so long about this part of them, and never saying? Anger, always close to the surface, the easy emotion to find and harness right there, smothering down the sadness, the grief, the loss, the tiredness, and the guilt that sat firmly atop that little glimmer of joy that he really, really couldn't let himself feel. He looked away from Cas, again.
"It-" Cas's eyes were wide and darting from his finger to Dean. "It cut me."
Dean threw his head back and laughed, and Cas knew the calculated risk was worth it. Sam groaned, dropping his head down on the table. “Great, that’s great guys.” His words came out muffled from behind his arms. Dean was still grinning as he moved food around the pan, and he nudged Cas with his elbow affectionately. Maybe Dean didn’t want anything more in front of Sam, but joking? This went down well. “I think I heard enough last night.”
"No, but it did eat my quarter." Sam admitted. "I heard these two old ladies talking outside of the launderette-"
He followed the corridor, looking for the right window, brushing past four immediately before spotting the right one.
He let them come to him; demons so eager to kill that they didn't bother trying to lure Sam away from the spot he was guarding. He destroyed them easily, taking out the taller one first whilst using his sheer size to keep the smaller at bay.
Dean didn't need telling twice, merely nodding to his brother and brushing past the Doctor, who, frankly, looked relieved to be rid of him.
“The texture intrigues me.” He said, meeting Dean’s eyes.
regret yesterday.” Dean grabbed his shoulder, pulling him to face him, to look at him. Cas glowered, no warmth in those eyes.
"I'm driving."
They all looked at Olivia, who had dropped to her knees, holding the arrow at her chest.
There was a beat of silence, and he heard Charlie sigh. “
“Thank you.” Cas said, walking on, not paying Sam much heed. Right now it was a matter of putting one foot in front of the other until he saw Dean again. He hadn’t expected this to be so nerve racking, the simple act of meeting Dean with clear intention and purpose. Perhaps he should have accepted his kiss last week, surely the following of base instinct and bodily, human needs would have been easier than this.
“Never.” Dean answered quickly, and Sam laughed at him. “I told you, get out, get safe, go find yourself a nice wife and have a great time being normal.”
"Uh..." Sam hesitated, looking up. "Another time. We kinda have things going on right now." He brushed it off. "So, vamp nest?"
“Seriously, Dean?” Sam stared at him.
"Wasn't counting." Dean told him gruffly, attempting to sit up, though his head was thumping like hell. "Shoulda been there, Sammie; the women there..." Dean whistled.
He was itching to hunt. Something was running through his system right now, and he wanted nothing more than to grab a really big knife and chop off a vamp's head, slice into some nasty son of a bitch's gut and see the life drain away with the blood. But that, according to Garth, wasn't an option right now.
“But I’m wondering if he’s distracted by something else. Someone…”
Dean paused again, scrunching his eyes tighter, ignoring, for the minute, the wet roll of dew escaping his eyes.
They were all up in an instant, Dean somehow fastest of all despite having been for the last ten minutes, by all appearances, fast asleep. There was a gun on a nearby table and he grabbed for it, aiming towards the sound, which took them all a couple of seconds to isolate. The door, the front door.
"Okay." Sam agreed, sighing and straightening up. He took a final look at his brother before turning round and picking up his bag.
“Thank you.” He said, reaching for the watering can and carefully sprinkling it onto the soil, careful not to let the drops fall heavy and contort the soft, aerated soil.
“I bet, but this is your first time-”
“Unless it was the only way to get us out.” Dean said, but dismissed that quickly. If Crowley knew where they were he could snag them when they got groceries. So, probably not Crowley. “Okay.”
"W-what do you mean?" Bill stuttered.
"Go." Sam told him, and Balthazar left, kicking through the pile of corpses at his feet. The coast was certainly clear; the hallway was void of demons, the only signs of life that of the fish in the aquarium. He had expected some stragglers, and considered the possibility that the demons had heard them talking, were waiting for them at the doors, at the supply cupboard.
“It doesn’t have to be.” He warned. “I’ve been in this too long to get out, but you don’t.”
“And if my vessel had been a woman?”
"So what happened after... Olivia." Sam asked, looking at Dean.
But Cas did not know how to do this. Cas didn't know how to fix it.
"Hey!" Dean protested. "I was there for hours before anything got smashed. And the girl there..." He chuckled. "Man, if I'd've been around at closing time..."
It held him up well enough then.
"What do we do, after this?"
Sam looked up as Cas exited the bathroom, a full ten minutes after Dean. He had taken a shower, and his hair was still dripping. He had a towel around his waist again, but it was larger this time, after he had switched them that morning.
He smiled, the pain in his back forgotten for a moment, and walked over, pushing open the door with ease, a soft tinkle from above him signifying his entrance and an elderly woman looked up from the till.
Dean stood up, grabbing his bag. "Right, let's get going."
"Pasta." Sam told him.
He looked in the mirror again, and breathed a sigh of relief. He looked normal, skin pink from the shower and the product, but normal. Thank fuck.
"Don't feel sad, little one." Zedkiel soothed. "God cared for you. He brought you back from the end, more than once. Even now, he still wills you to be here." She stroked his shoulder. "He loves you, brother."
"Tell 'em you're a friend of the family?"
If it made Dean happy, then Cas would be happy.
“In the library.”
For a heartbeat Dean thought Cas was gonna say no. His face was unreadable as he made Dean wait for an answer, slow seconds passing. “Okay.”
Shimmying off her boot, she looked at the small piece of jewellery. It wasn't much to look at; she couldn't see anything more there than a simple piece of silver. But that was it. That was what she had been looking for.
The grounds were as unexpectedly vast as the house was, and, unfortunately, sunk at the back. It made room for another floor underneath the ground floor, and made the kitchen now way above him.
"I'm grateful." Cas winced, clutching her stomach. "This does not feel pleasurable." She gasped, and began convulsing, and a hand covered her mouth.
"Well, then what?" Dean replied grumpily. He didn't really appreciate being woken up unnecessarily, even if he had gotten an inordinate amount of sleep. And the dreams last night weren't even that bad, more so a confusing, guilt ridden mess of memories, of Cas. He craned his neck round, checking the sleeping body in the bed. He could still see his chest moving up and down slowly, still breathing.
He was staring him down with those bright blue eyes, waiting.
"You know the cleaner wouldn't mind." Dean winked, remembering the previous morning when the middle aged employee had slipped her number to him.
“Yeah, he’s right here.” Sam snapped his fingers to get Cas’s attention, chucking the phone over to him.
It wasn’t
Cas peered up at him, blue eyes shining in the warm light, and Dean awkwardly avoided the eye contact. Stepping away, he waved a hand, gesturing to Cas to move himself now that he was awake. "Muscle strain." Cas muttered, as if finally working out what the problem was as he shuffled down.
Sam frowned at Dean's indignancy. "yeah, but..." The younger Winchester sighed, lowering his laptop lid. "He's given everything for you. Multiple times. He clearly feels strongly for you, one way or another."
“Oh no, I totally did.” Sam said, laughing at a memory. “There was a theme night at the student bar, can’t remember what it was but I went in a dress and Jess went in a suit. It was great.”
"That would be unnecessary." Cas told him. "I just need to find the vessel..." The angel stumbled, despite Sam's strong hold, as her knees gave way. Dean got up, and, putting his personal feelings aside for a second, gave up his spot on the rock. Cas gratefully sat down, and looked out to the lake. There was a few minutes of silence, before Sam awkwardly cleared his throat.
"No, I doubt it. It's not really in your job description, is it?"
"Dean." Cas sighed, but suddenly straightened up, eyes alert.
“It’s fine.” He told himself. “Just a blip. Just too much time indoors.” He tried to let the words settle.
"No, not c-" He snapped, resisting the urge to punch. He couldn't believe he was going to do this. "In. Blend in, Cas. We work best when we don't draw attention by being dressed in a high-vis vest." He gestured down at the sleeve of the first jacket.
Crowley straightened up a little, a smile flinching onto his face. “Well, that’s a shame. And here I thought we were friends.”
And sure, going to bed had been awkward. Cas had called it not long after, deciding to go up to read, and Sam hadn’t thought too much into it. Dean had thrown him a wide smile, but didn’t quite meet his eyes, waving him upstairs. Dean and Sam had played cards for a while longer, Dean playing so fast and loose that Sam eventually raked it all in, leaving Dean bankrupt before Sam wanted to call it a night too.
"Goddamn being very apt, Dean." Cas sighed.
The poor guy was clearly low on options. But if that’s what Cas wanted, if Cas wanted to get his rocks off with a guy,
And suddenly the phone went silent. The call had ended.
"You would let me?" Cas seemed disbelieving. "Dean would?"
His head snapped around to look at Sam, who was standing a few metres away, concern etched across his face.
Dean claimed he was fine. Dean said he would punch Sam if he kept asking how he was.
“You gave him an easy throw.” Sam reminded him.
Fair point. Still too many barriers. Dean reluctantly let go of him and Cas clambered down, pulling his pants and underwear off in one smooth motion, and suddenly he was right there, in front of Dean, fully naked. Dean sat up on his elbows, letting himself look, and he wondered if this was gonna be the point where he freaked. All that skin, the full sight of Cas, his dick standing proud. Dean had done that to him.
was normal. He could never be one of them, but maybe tonight he could pretend to be. If they were gonna set up base in this town, people would think he was. That was the best he could hope for, really.
“Whaddya mean?”
"Sir?" He asked.
"My condolences." He offered, before turning on his heel and following Dean out of the door, which got quickly shut behind him.
Dean could feel it choking him, the failure, the rejection, the crushing weight of Cas’s disappointment. He wanted to run, like the coward he was… he remembered feeling this at the hospital, when they weren’t sure if Cas would wake up, that instinctive, self-destructive urge to get as far away as possible, to where he wouldn’t feel this any more. But he wouldn’t. He should let this drop, he should follow Cas’s lead here and simply not push this any further, let Cas get on with being human, let him find some local to bang and maybe love, settle down with. That could work. But the thought made him ache inside, made him want to fight for something he just didn’t deserve.
They both looked at each other, trying to out-stare the other. After a few seconds, Sam suggested another solution.
Cas nodded, agreeing to Dean's terms, stepping to the next rail, picking up a grey top with a wide neck, a deep slit in the centre with an embroidered hem. He picked it up, holding it in front of him in the mirror. He didn't notice Dean's expression.
"Yeah?"
"We'll take care of you." Sam reassured him. "But you need to tell Dean. Trust me, it'll be ten times worse if he finds out on his own."
“You got it.” Dean said, looking at her with affection. He’d warmed to her fast, ridiculous really, and it wasn’t even an attraction thing. Part of him was hit with an instinct to flirt, but something about her reminded him of Jo, or the way he felt about Jo. Like he wanted to give her a hug and trade jokes with her, but anything past that was off the table.
"I really can't believe you." Sam sighed, looking out the window. "This is the girl that is trying to kill our friend and you slept with her! No wonder the guy didn't come when you called."
Things became a little more complicated after that.
And it felt good. It felt so good to be wanted, to have someone’s interest, clear and firm and decisive. To have someone who was clearly so, so ready to take charge of him, to make him focus on what she wanted. It felt good.
"Dean?"
“Yeah. Except, he might get hit by a bus tomorrow when he’s out on a beer run, so better keep him in the bunker. It’s safe here.” She looked around. “Except, he might be sitting somewhere minding his own business, and a book shelf might-”
"I know." He replied, unsmiling, but with warm eyes.
"Seems like a lot of 'ifs' and 'mights' to me, Sammy." Dean pointed out.
After a few minutes of this, heart racing and stress levels rising, he heard footsteps behind him, and he span around, spatula in hand, ready to defend himself against the intruder. He instead came face to face with Sam, who instantly raised his hands, the universally accepted gesture of
Sam stared her down. "He changed his mind. He decided you can have him."
"Dean?"
Oh. This was nerves. He was anxious. He’d been nervous before, but this was the first time it had manifested in such a way. And this felt different from battle nerves. It felt silly to be nervous about something so trivially human as a date after all he had seen, the battles he’d won, but here he was, trivially human.
“Cas?” Sam called his attention back. He cleared his throat, looking away awkwardly before looking back at him. “Is, uh, is something going on with you and Dean?”
“Welcome to the club, buddy.” Dean laughed against him, and he felt Cas grin.
"I didn't."
"Oh." The little girl looked around, holding her skirt so that it would not inadvertently catch alight. "Well, that's mean."
"Then why the hell did you leave? Why did you leave me?"
"I was lead to believe that it was a comforting pastime, despite the painful after-effects."
“and I’ve hurt you too many times in my existence.”
"I'm sure I can." She smiled, glancing to Cas, who was silently watching the conversation. Dean sighed, pulling at his collar.
Sam looked out at the countryside around them, seeing that there was, indeed, a small parking lot. He even saw the meter, which Garth headed straight for as soon as he stepped out. Sam glanced around, noticing one other car parked near them. He checked out the ticket on the dash, seeing that it was six days old, but it didn't have any accompanying fines. Perhaps Garth was right.
"Son of a bitch." Dean spat, looking up the wall as it grew higher and higher above his head the longer he walked along it. Tall as he was, he couldn't jump that.
"How much longer have we got?" Sam asked.
of the office.” She told him simply, and he nodded in respect.
"Might?" Dean yelled. "Are we putting everything on might? Cos that sounds like a hell of a chance of him dying instead!" He reached the car and flung the trunk open, delving inside to find the ingredients he needed. "We're doing this." He told him as he picked up a knife, using it to gesture at his brother. "You can either help, or go back to your chew toy nurse."
They pulled into town at half eleven. They'd driven past three towns, two that didn't seem to have a tattoo parlour in sight, and one that looked like they might get hepatitis just from walking in the door. The fourth was finally sizable, even containing a shopping mall, and a large library that Sam was keen to check out. Bypassing the tattoo parlour, they headed straight for the mall.
He didn't think Cas really knew what he was asking. He was just confused by human customs again, and he wanted to see how they fit in to the hunters lives. When he had asked if he had kept anything for no reason other than for sentiment...
"It's in my nature." The little girl smiled. "You have me rather trapped."
Dean looked down to the dropped fishing rod before looking back up to the angel. "Well, it's good to see you." He told him. "Up and about, I mean.
"First tat?" She asked as she set up, and Cas nodded. "Okay, that's fine." She kept her voice calm and easy, professional, sensing her customer was nervous. "It hurts a little bit. You might wanna hold your friends hand." She glanced over to Dean, who blinked in surprise.
How did humans
"I know what happened." Chuck replied. "I know he's in a coma-"
Sam drove off and left Cas sitting there, alone again. Cas was fully aware that Dean would not be happy with his assigned job, and the afternoon would be very uncomfortable for them both. He wished, not for the first time, that his social skills were better, so that he might know what to do in situations such as these, what would be the correct action to make Dean happy.
"Cas, Cas, please, buddy!" Dean cried, tears starting to flow. He still wasn't breathing, his heart wasn't beating. Pressing his lips against the man's once more, he breathed out, but stopped halfway through as a sob racked his chest. The truth dawned on him.
“What are you offering?” Sam asked carefully.
They stayed like that for a few seconds, stuck in that tight embrace before Dean pulled away, looking Cas deep in the eyes that the angel had done to him so many times.
He let his head hang, tore his gaze away from the body and closed his eyes. He didn't want to see anymore. He felt tears well behind his eyelids again and he didn't make an effort to stop them as the silently fell to the floor.
Cas visibly drooped, body apparently feeling the ache and tiredness of being stationary and strained for so long. Dean took the opportunity to pull his hand away, wiping the damp onto his jeans as Kirsty began to carefully clean the ink off.
After another while of driving, the boys began to notice strange noises coming from the backseat. Dean stubbornly focused on driving, but Sam turned round.
He went back to the hallway where Dean was waiting for him.
within him. Long, deep instinct were fighting against this, telling him to chase pleasure. He could feel good tonight, he could feel so good. “It’s uh, it’s nothing personal, and I’m really flattered. Any other time I would leap at the chance but…” He tore his eyes away from her cleavage, when had he even looked there?
"It was unnecessary." Castiel shrugged. "I was content up here."
"We are not buying you chick-clothes." Dean told him, spinning on his heel and holding up a finger in his face. "No." He picked up a random shirt, holding it up against the man, swapping it back and forth with another. "Medium." He decided.
"Take care, brother." She told him, taking hold of his forearm, offering a gentle anchor as his breathing became stuttered.
“Huh” Dean shifted, quiet for a minute. But his muscles were tensed, and lingering hands had stalled.
” Can responded, and Dean laughed, free and easy.
"You managed to be outside without getting yourself killed, then?" Dean quipped. "Sam will be amazed."
He turned to Sam, letting go of the unresponsive hand. "What's all that?" He asked, not trying to hide the disinterest in his voice.
“Before we get started…” Sam spoke, and she glanced up, nodding in acknowledgement.
Cas had struggled with the concept of what his “nicest” outfit was. Truthfully he would have gone for the suit, he knew that much of human culture, but Dean had already vetoed that (and judging by Sam’s nod, he agreed). He spent what he recognised as
That being said, everything he did meant he deserved a drink, these days.
“Because… because we’ve all done this shit in this life. What I did on demon blood, and when I said yes to Lucifer, everything I did when I didn’t have a soul… Cas, I’d be a huge hypocrite if I didn’t. I get it, you had to make a tough call and it went bad. But you’re fixing it now.”
“You gonna be alright getting home?” She asked, gesturing to a card for the local cab company, and he waved it off. It was a short walk, and the fresh air would do him good. He fished out his wallet, leaving a way too generous tip. She needed the cash way more than him, and he saw her eyebrows raise in surprise.
"But he can't teleport." Sam was saying. "He can't have just vanished."
"Oh, yeah? And how'd that work out for you?"
“Here’s the thing, Cas, and I think you might now this already. Our Dad was… he wasn’t a good Dad. He tried his best, he trained us how to be hunters, good hunters, but he really did a number on us. On Dean. I don’t think I even know half of the shit Dean went through but, but I’ve got an idea? He protected me from a lot of it.”
They finally reached his door, thank fuck, because as much as Cas seemed to like the noises he was pulling out of Dean, there was no way he was gonna let him make him loud enough to alert Sam. For the first time in his life he had a room of his own and he was gonna fucking use it. He shoved the door back, hearing it slam against the wall and got Cas far enough in to kick it shut behind them again, and suddenly Cas was back on him, pressed against him, kissing him with every line of his body right up against Dean, crowding him, and it was so fucking good. Dean scrambled to find the buttons of Cas’s shirt, opening enough of them to pull it over Cas’s head, and Cas forced Dean’s shirt off his shoulders while Dean reached for Cas’s belt, pulling it free and dropping it to the floor with a thud. They both kicked off their shoes with the combined agreement that the objective right now was for them to both be naked as fast as possible, and Dean pushed against Cas, forcing him backwards towards the bed.
“He’s after you.” Dean reminded him.
“Would you like to be?”
“Have a good time with Charlie.” Cas told him, before hanging up.
"Pleasure to meet you, Bill West." Dean patted him on the shoulder. "Nice house, you got here. Shame about the cold spots."
“If you’d like to discuss the weather then by all means-”
Dean knew that Cas hadn't quite understood the film. Or followed it. It was one of the weaker films, filled with long suspense sequences where little happened, but he became aware that as the movie went on Cas began to allow himself to get a little lost in it. Just as he was beginning to write the franchise off for Cas, he caught his friend watching enraptured in the proceedings. Something there had caught his attention.
“You knew?” His voice hoarse. He could keep playing dumb, but what was the point?
"A murderer? A traitor? An irrational, arrogant fool?" She cried. "You're more than half way there."
“And I can buy them wanting to kill off all the demons, who wouldn’t?” Dean sighed. “If they weren’t trying to kill off the rest of
"Angels are born to follow, yet now we have no leader."
"He could do that? The kid's parent couldn't control him."
"Yeah, I get it. I'm an asshole." Dean told him.
Sam would occasionally glance in the mirror, checking on the two. To start with it was out of anxiety, to make sure they were both still alright, that Cas was still in one piece, and that Dean wasn't falling apart again. But as the journey went on, he would look out of curiosity; Dean's demeanour was perceptibly more and more relaxed, starting out as agitated impatience, but he gradually seemed to sooth, relaxing more into the seat, alternating between keeping an eye on Cas and watching the road out of the window. His hand was resting out Cas's right shoulder, ready to secure him if need be, ever vigilant. But like his physical presence, that soon changed too; his thumb began to stroke up and down the crisp hospital pyjamas covering his upper arm, soothing circles. Sam didn't even think that Dean noticed he was doing it. Every so often Dean would seem to jolt back into reality and check Cas's pulse, almost reflexively, as if reacting to some silent thought he had, but each time he was placated.
"Oh, I'm sure." She rolled her eyes. Walking closer to him, she stopped an inch from his nose. "The thing is, Sammy; I'm not as stupid as you look. I don't buy this 'Dean changed his mind' business for a second. And even if he had, there's no way he'd let you go in here alone. So," She poked his shoulder roughly. "Where. Is. Your. Brother?"
"How you doing there, buddy?" Dean asked, leaning into Cas's line of vision. The man didn't shift his gaze until Dean became completely intrusive, forehead positioned directly in front of the picture.
"Tamara?" Sam squinted in thought, and his face fell slightly, remembering. "Yeah, I remember her." He didn't mention his involvement in the story.
“You shot me, and stabbed me.” Cas’s mouth quirked at the corner.
"Chuck. Real life." Dean barked.
"Fine." He agreed. He looked briefly round the kitchen, but decided that this room probably wasn't the place to keep a lock of hair.
"You could say that." She downed her drink and looked at the boy. "Look, Tommy; you don't have to do the sympathetic ear thing to me. I don't care. I don't want it. I'd rather just drink in peace tonight." She looked up at him. "As delightful as you are, and, frankly, you are lovely on the eyes... I'd prefer my own company."
, worth everything he had to go through to get here. Dean had made this promise right in this room. And he was gonna follow through.
Dean knew what it was like to lose that respect from someone. He’d lost it, so many years ago, when he was 16. He’d seen the look on his Dad’s face when he’d come back to the motel early, that John didn’t look him in the eyes for months, how he never looked at him the same till the day he died.
beds, in their
A teenage boy had managed to get a proper hit on Sam by this time, grazing his cheek with a scalpel, and stabbing it deep into his shoulder. He cried out, rolling his shoulder back and stumbling. Dean picked up the latin.
“Huh…” Sam wondered aloud. “I’m sure you deserved it.”
Cas tried a few more times, each time knocking the cans off the wall without fail. Dean was, apparently, impressed. "Well, ain't you a regular Sundance Kid?" He joked, taking the gun from him and putting it back in the trunk, pulling out a shotgun. He shrugged, apparently thinking it through for a second, before shooting his friend a grin. "Guess that makes me Butch."
He tore his eyes away, looking at the room around them. “What about a table to put your tea on in there? You always put it on the floor, or hold it.”
“You want good fries? You’ll thank me.” He swatted Sam with the towel. “He needs training though.”
He didn't always get to go here. He used to, more than he did of late. Usually it was nightmares, dreaded repeats. Some were better than others, and some would stray into those forty years he desperately wanted to forget. When Cas was around, properly around, he would sometimes keep an eye on his dreams, direct them into a more pleasant direction. He hadn't had that luxury for some time now.
Cas laughed, and Dean’s eyes lit up at the sound. “Yes, I am nervous.” Cas answered, and Dean’s face softened slightly. “Are you?”
“I need you to be honest with me, to tell me what you’re feeling, what you’re thinking about me. I can’t do anything if you won’t let me know what needs to be done.” He looked down at his hands, feeble, human appendages, unable to heal even a simple papercut. “I need you to help me.”
Cas smiled down at the wraps. “The food was excellent.” Cas said simply, and Sam nodded, pleased.
"Very well." The angel said.
However, the power of surprise works well against an angel. Angels are slow, have had to be. They are patient, stoic, can spend an age watching over humanity and see civilisations fall. They are forward thinkers, planners, shrewd and calculating. But, a little slow on the uptake. If you catch them by surprise, and have the right tools, you can deal some serious damage. The Winchesters know this well, have utilised this in battle many times. Cas had too, and many of his own kind had died by his hand.
"Better call the cops, Sammie; sounds serious." Dean quipped. "Do we need a bomb squad or the full blown army?"
"Alright."
Dean got used to Cas leaving the bunker, after the third time outside letting him go solo, knowing his was armed. Cas was grateful for this; initially he’d understood, he’d accepted the brothers caution, that their assessment of the danger was accurate, that he should be careful, that he was still learning. It stung to think this, this constant reminder that he was weak now, but his body was getting stronger, his human senses less agonisingly acute, less overwhelming, and fundamentally meaning he could now
The house was darker now. As the day worked itself into the middle of the afternoon and the sun began to set, it no longer naturally lit the house, and the rooms seemed duller, less homely, and far more like the type of place a ghost might haunt.
"Yeah, that's what I think!" Dean cried. "After everything he's done!"
Her name was Penny.
“Oh.” Dean blinked. His mind flashed back to the groan he had heard before Sam came back in, that had tripped him up but then forgot about. Cas had jerked one out in the shower.
"My grace is falling." Cas told him.
"Gank one for me." Dean told them, taking another sip as his brother moved towards the door.
Dean nodded thoughtfully. “Yeah, held his own.” He grabbed the sugar, pouring it into a bowl of cooling water set aside and stirring until it dissolved. Sam watched with disgust as Dean poured the fries in.
"You did?"
"And now you are taking it back."
"Feel any better?" He ventured to ask, and Cas pondered it a moment.
Sam nodded to himself and walked out the door, heading straight for the car where Garth was still waiting. Dean looked away from the window, not wanting to see them drive away, instead focusing on downing the rest of the bottle. Sam would come back. There was no need for him to worry.
“Because. It’s not who I am. It’s not what I do.”
“Well, they said you were dead. And an… angel?”
"I dunno. Try me." She looked at him with all seriousness. "Then he body jumps me, and I get to see my Dad getting killed. I get the memory pumped through me. I get the back story, context, the guy's bloody mental state while he does it, and you know what?" She took a drink, finishing it, and gesturing for another. "I still want him dead."
"It used to be a doughy substance, quite unrecognisable from that product in the bag." He remembered.
Dean felt fine, great, even. He was free, free to be outside and not worry about Demons around every corner, free to go out, have a drink, or five, and not be constantly watching his back. Sure, Leviathan were still out there, but Charlie had bought them a lot of security from the oily bastards. Right now, Dean could go out and celebrate, away from the two guys he’d been trapped in an, admittedly luxurious, bunker with for the last few weeks.
"For..."
“We were screwing around last night.” Dean said simply, wiping at his eye self consciously. “Like you never slapped on back at Stanford.”
us there, when you gave me a
He spent much of the film glancing back at Dean, taking more pleasure in watching his friend watch the film than watching it himself. In one of the many times that he found himself staring, as the light from the screen danced across Dean's face, he came to another realisation about the film. In the same way that the film was reminiscent of certain aspects of their lives, so were the characters. He could have found similarities from all of the characters back to his friend sitting next to him, but he found himself drawn to the fair haired captain, the cocky arrogance and steadfast confidence, the implicit trust his family had in him.
"It's just..." Sam sighed, closing the laptop. "You call me the geek." He chuckled, leaning back. Dean turned now, raising his eyebrows at his brother.
"Hi," The girl smiled, looking from Cas to Dean and back again. "I'm Kirsty."
The smaller man shrugged. "Doesn't have to work all the way." He stopped talking and dropped it, leaving them to drive in silence. It was a few minutes before Sam responded.
Livvie winced slightly, acknowledging her words. "My name is Olivia."
Though perhaps this was a wild generalisation.
“Would you prefer I called you handsome?” Cas asked, and Dean’s eyes shot up to him, a smile tweaking his face. “Or striking? Or… hot?”
Cas shrugged, considering. “Theoretically I know how to play it, though I think I would struggle to put it into practice.”
to do, willingly. “Are you really okay with this?” Dean asked, feeling the words comes out incredulous and judgemental. He’d aimed for caring.
"Yes."
He met Dean back downstairs as he slowly figured out the best way to stand; shoulders back, popping the shoulder blades back and minimising the amount of fabric touching the affected skin. Sure, it was creasing the skin a little, but it didn't feel nearly as bad. He was beginning to consider just taking the sweater back off and simply being cold, but he had to admit that as the first bite of cold hit him when he stepped outside, goose pimples travelling down his arms and hardening his nipples beneath the fabric, that yes, he did need clothes outside.
He could see Cas waiting for Dean to decide, a small smile playing on his features. Fuck it. He ducked his head in, placing a small, chaste kiss on his lips, backing away fast. That was all he could manage right now, but the way Cas’s face lit up was so beautiful. “Okay.” He mumbled, stepping away, suddenly awkward. This was awkward.
"I see."
"Gank one for me." Dean gruffly replied. Another gulp of alcohol.
Sam nodded, heading straight over to the pan, grabbing an avocado from the pile of fresh stuff on the counter. Cas lingered in the doorway, watching Dean carefully before slowly entering the cabin. “Plenty for you too, buddy.” Dean said, looking away at the clock. He didn’t watch Cas come in, but somehow he was aware of him anyway, his quiet footsteps louder than Sam’s galumphing stomps.
"And that was a change to how you've been the rest of the time?"
"'Fraid so." Dean smiled, leaning back, before catching the full force of Cas's expression again, blue eyes shining, brows furrowed, looking... upset. God, the ending had actually upset the guy. He felt a pang in his chest, the hot nudge of an all too familiar feeling; guilt. He blinked, his mirth vanishing.
"Call me cupid." She smirked.
"Yeah, okay." Dean smiled, taking off his jacked and settling on the sofa. He looked around, noticing they were one short.
Dean looked up, and Cas could see it all there. Nervousness, caution, but… intrigue? Even, hope?
"I'm sorry-"
"You're trying to torture him." Dean stated.
Sam crept back in, placing the books on the bed, and his laptop too.
Dean was, for some reason, sulking. Sam couldn't figure it out, but he knew it wasn't about the forgotten pie. By a long shot it could be the acknowledgement of Dean's inner nerd that he tried so hard to keep hidden, but Sam doubted it was that. His best guess was that it was due to the fact that somehow, deep down, Dean didn't quite know how to deal with being happy. Since it had quietened down, since Cas had returned and he's been forced to deal, since Cas had woken up human... Dean had what he's always wanted; a family.
It got a little less awkward after that in the days that passed. Dean did stumble over his words more than a few times over dinner that night, but they settled into a kind of normalcy in it. Cas, certainly, seemed normal. Cas acted like he always did, less eye rolls, difficult silences and pointed anger, instead he appeared happier, joking with Sam a little, making idle conversation with Dean. No, Cas wasn’t the one being awkward for once, it was Dean. But Cas didn’t seem to mind.
"His visit from his little sister?" She reminded him, frowning slightly when Dean looked blank. "He didn't bother to mention that bit?"
He’d stalled. “I was thinking we could go out for dinner.” He said, watching as Cas relaxed at his words. “Just you and me.”
The man's eyes flickered back to Dean, softening at the words. "Of course."
“What’s that meant to mean?”
"I mean," He pondered. "It's reusable, but we really only have one shot with it."
for breakfast. “It remembers me!”
"I'm here, Dean. The angel replied, his hand still on Dean's arm.
"You are performing more than one ritual?" The girl asked. "You are ambitious."
"You get that now that he's not in a coma, watching him sleep is just plain creepy, right?" Sam called up from the bottom of the stairs.
"Time's up, Cassie." She forced a grin on her face, and quickly teleported them back to the house, throwing him into the oil ring from before.
“There’s a lot of dangerous monsters out there.” Dean said, and she held up hands in defence, before pointing at her cheek.
“What would he think of you using his body like this?”
He swallowed, and looked away quickly, realising just what he was doing; watching another man suck his finger. No. Dean Winchester does not watch another man suck his finger off. Just... just no.
“You were drunk.”
So. It's been 7 and a half years since I've updated this. I'm not sure if this is going to get anyone's attention, but I hope maybe a few people will read it. It's been a long time since I've written anything, but Season15 has just gotten me back in the zone.
“That was too much.” Cas surmised, and Dean looked up at him, sighing again as he put the menu down on the table.
"Yes, yes; they are worrying." Bill sighed.
“My Dad was a piece of work.” He said, without even realising he said it. “I never realised how much…” He rested his forehead into his hands, looking down at the brown liquor on the bar. Dad was always a fan of liquor, though he often couldn’t afford it. It was beer that John usually drank, and he smelt bitter and stale. Dean had stolen sips from the dregs of John’s bottles since he was single digits, training himself to like the flavour. When John let him have his first beer at 12 he didn’t flinch at the sourness, and John had been proud.
They arrived at the address fairly quickly, the town wasn't big. The house that they pulled up at was quaint, but clearly was past its prime. The remains of a dead garden were in front of the house, bedraggled flowers wilting in the sun, untrimmed hedges and an unmown lawn. In the driveway was a flashy sports car, sleek and red, clearly expensive. Dean looked at it, mourning the Impala again.
“No. You.” He firmly answered, holding Dean’s eyes. “From the second I saw you I realised how hurt you were, how special you were, how wonderful. And from that moment you became my utmost priority, everything was about
“Seriously, Sam. The guy was…” He trailed off, he couldn’t tell him. He couldn’t tell him what Cas had asked.
And yet, this isn’t new. He realises, right then, that he’s felt this for a long time, long before he fell.
"I don't tend to get much downtime." Sam grunted to her.
“Excellent ally.” She said, a little sarcastically, patting him on the arm, and he laughed, brushing her off.
"No," Cas stared at his finger, holding it as if it might fall off. "It was paper!"
There were rings there too, a range of bands in different metals, some with stones, some without. He grimaced at some of them, some gothic ones that looked like dragons curved around your finger, or with pentagrams. Hell, maybe that would be good in a fight against a demon.
"It would really help if you actually did something." She bit back. Sitting up, she kissed the hunter and wrapped her arms round his neck, pulling him down on top of her.
This was an overreaction. He got turned down when he made a pass at a friend. It happens. He took a risk and it didn’t pay off. That’s okay. It had been a crazy urge anyway. The words settled on him, ringing true, smothering down the part of him that screamed it wasn’t true, that this
"I doubt many wanted this outcome." He snapped.
Garth's smile lit across his face the instant he saw Sam as if he were a kid in a candy shop, instead of a grown man entering a dank cabin in the woods.
"Saying what?"
"Hey." Dean barked, finally succeeding in getting his attention. He swallowed, finding himself under the fire of Cas's glare. "Can you go in there and grab a tape?"
"You and Dean, before I picked you up." She turned back to him and smirked. "Seemed pretty serious."
"And you knocked over shelves in a bookshop."
"Safety." Dean reminded, and Cas glanced over, confused. Dean reached over, flicking a switch on the gun. "Always check the safety's off if you're gonna shoot."
What did he want?
It was only half 9 at that point, and Dean, feigning soberness, managed to buy two six packs down the street. He got his keys out, almost driving, weighing up the amount he'd drunk and the sway of his limbs, before putting them away and heading towards a park he'd seen earlier; chances are he woulda been fine, he'd driven baby in worse states, but there was little point in smashing up a usable car. He spent the remainder of the night there, drinking and being a general public nuisance.
"And they don't get paper cuts either." He told him. He shook his head slightly, pleading. "Come on, Cas; just tell me."
Sam sighed, wiping his hands down his face. "Bobby would know."
"Do you?"
A beat. And clear as a bell. “Why?”
Dean had returned, arms full of groceries, some of them even in the canvas bags Sam insisted they use. He let Sam unpack, listening to his brother talk about the training he’d done with Cas today. God, their lives were really getting repetitive. They needed to get out of this cabin, fast.
"Dean does not know."
that Cas was nearly naked and Dean still hadn’t got used to it, like a freak. It was…. what was it? Something about him was different, noticeably different. Like something in the way he walked, the mumbled words, the easy wave of his arm. His whole posture had shifted, looser, freer, like the perpetual stick up his ass had been taken out-
"Cas?" He called. "Where are you?"
“Would you like to see the wine list?”
“Any of Dad’s old buddies got any last hideaways?” Sam suggested, wincing as he pulled off his jacket to assess the damage. Blood oozed slowly out of his shoulder, a dark gash barely visible in the night. Cas was still swivelled in his chair to look at it, the seatbelt pulled tight across his chest. Not long ago he could’ve healed Sam with a touch, right now they were just lucky it wasn’t more serious.
“Bitch.” Dean replied instantly, cracking a smile, glancing at Sammy in the rearview.
"And?"
"About types of drink. Nothing much to it."
to have Dean in his life, he was grateful too for Sam’s friendship. As much as he hurt Dean, he hurt Sam more. At his worst, in his most power hungry state, he’d hurt Sam severely, and yet here they were hunting together. “Sam… why do you trust me? After what I did to you?”
Too still.
“Semen?” Cas asked, and Dean groaned.
"Propaganda." Castiel informed him. "Heaven does not like to advertise the angels' mistakes."
Charlie’s voice rang through again. “
“Well, go on then kiddo, get to work.”
“Peachy.” She told him, and he frowned, not buying it.
She stepped up close to the circle, squaring her shoulders and narrowing her eyes. "Do you wanna know what he was doing right before?" She grinned, leaning in and whispering. "Me. We were fucking." She stepped back, looking at his face, waiting for a reaction. "How do you feel about that?"
What was it he’d wanted? He couldn’t think past Cas’s hands splayed across his skin, and Dean had already shucked Cas’s jacket off, discarded it somewhere unknown and long forgotten. It had been important, moderately, but when Cas licked back up his neck and bit on his ear lobe Dean
So now, ready as they’d ever be, they returned inside. Gone was the mirth from before, the happiness and ease that Charlie brought to them. It was tense as they headed to the dungeon, as Cas checked the items laid out carefully, as Dean checked the devils trap built into the foundation, as Sam started arranging the materials for the summoning. It’s time.
Dean walked down the road, his sixth sense leading him in the vague direction of alcohol. He didn't know the town, and he didn't want to stop and ask for directions, so he figured he'd just follow his feet until he stumbled across a bar.
"Relax, Sam; it's definitely around here somewhere. Just gotta find the carpark."
, Dean realised. Cas was talking about him. He was really saying that he didn’t care what every angel and demon, every human and monster thought about him. All he cared about was what Dean thought of him. Despite everything.
Cas felt a grunt of pain punched out of his lungs, and he turned to glare at Dean.
“How d’ya find the hypotenuse angle, Dean?”
He didn't consider waking his brother. The sleep would do him good.
"She got them both." Dean spat.
Sam looked over at Dean, who raised his eyebrows a little in recognition. “Cas is our… friend. He’s a good guy, he actually, wow, you’re gonna freak out at this,” Sam grinned, and Dean rolled his eyes good naturedly. “He was an angel, like how you said they were always watching over us?”
The girl just looked at her with panicked eyes. "Where did they go?" She whispered. "Where did my friend go?"
So they drove, and they drove, and they drove. Sam slept for three hours or so before they switched out, Dean moving to the passenger seat as the first glimpses of dawn began to break. Cas had shifted in and out of sleep, the road map open in his lap.
The angel smiled. "Hi." She looked around, peering at the flames. "Who are you?"
Sam was wrong, obviously. It wasn't that he was hurt by Cas, from everything he did. He was just angry. He was angry up top, you go down some more, still angry, and then you get deeper still, and guess what? More anger.
"Guarding the door."
They kicked open the door, unlatched as it was, and blinked in the darkness. Light filtered through slats in the roofing, but not much, only leaving stripes of light hitting the dusty floor below. They couldn't see anything going on past the large room, but they could see that there was plenty to hide behind; stacks of timber lay here and there, and heavy machinery was dotted around.
“Yeah, but I figured you were reading gardening books,” He shrugged. “Around lore, anyway.”
Dean couldn’t help but smile, a laugh forcing its way out at Cas. He just looked so…. “Cute.” He teased, and he smiled harder as he watched Cas trying to figure out the gesture behind his words, eyes narrowing and body language tightening a fraction.
(See the end of the chapter for
And now that Cas had his first successful hunt under his belt, still alive, and in fact having
“I’m sorry if I made you uncomfortable.” Cas quickly responded, the words slipping of his tongue like they’d been waiting to all day.
“I dunno, as the only person in the car who’s passed their test… maybe I should be sitting shotgun?” Sam joked, and Dean glanced over.
But now to realise as a human that he was sexually attracted to Dean Winchester?
“A smother. You’re being Norman Bates’ mom.”
She smiled at him, putting her hands on her hips, and Sam took a proper look at her. She was petite, slim, though covered up with some green scrubs, and she had a big smile with twinkling brown eyes. Her dark hair was scooped up into a sloppy bun, and a few dark hairs straggled down.
“It can wait for someone to show up. Or, I’ll go with Sam!” He snapped his fingers, and Sam scoffed, waiting for Cas to throw his bag in the trunk.
Sam’s voice rang through, and Dean straightened up, twisting to see his brother, swearing under his breath. He looked at Cas quickly, a silent plea to
Dean let out a long breath. Despite himself, he knew Chuck was right. There was nothing he could do, there was nothing to do. No amount of pleading or planning or doing would wake Cas up. The fatigue that he'd shoved away came back in full force, the adrenaline from the fight earlier evaporated. He wanted nothing more than to collapse into the bed and sleep.
“Did I push you too far?” Cas asked softly, and Dean could see the worry written across his face. Dean shook his head fiercely, scrunching his eyes up for a second.
But after several minutes...
"You've been offered a rare choice, Castiel." Anna breathed, and Gabriel scoffed.
“Considering it’s my face to be slapped, I think that point is moot.” Cas retorted, and Dean couldn’t help but huff out a laugh. When did Cas start getting funny?
Garth shrugged. "When my cousin came out, we had to act like it was this huge surprise. Like we hadn't seen he was dating the lifeguard down the road for the last three years."
Cas stared him down, and Dean forced himself to meet his gaze. God, those eyes. He knew once that Cas wasn’t just looking at him but that he was staring right down into the depths of his soul, seeing every tiny scrap laid bare, every scar, every flaw, every evil deed he’d done on this earth and the pit below. And chose him, chose him again and again anyway.
Frustrated, he tugged harder on her top, disentangling lips for a minute so that he could tug it off of her. He figured the sight of more flesh would help the current situation, and banish all errant thoughts from his mind.
He knew that it’s different now. He doesn’t have that inhuman strength, the reality shifting grace. He knows that if Dean runs at him at full force, he will fall. But he has fought hand to hand well enough, he knows how to evade, how to lash, how to use momentum against someone. He knows he needs training, but he also knows he is not just a baby in a trenchcoat.
“Where are we going?” Cas asked, and Dean glanced back at him, grateful for the reprieve. He walked over to the car door, gesturing for Cas to do the same, and they got in.
"I'd had a lot to drink." Dean huffed, looking out of the windows at the pavement as he drove.
Garth glanced back. "Well, there's all that, and the missing persons, neck contusions on corpses, and the rumours of nocturnal folk round here."
"I don't know what you're talking about." He mumbled.
"Cas, you alright back there?"
"You have no power." He told her firmly. "It has been removed."
"Make me." She winked. He bent down to kiss her, and for several minutes their lips moved in unison, hot breath and sweat steaming up the car. His hands continued roaming across her body, and hers explored his, soon finding her way back down to his crotch again. Despite not finding any improvement in the previous situation, she worked at it, sliding her hand inside the rough denim and palming what she found down there.
Cas stared at the hand as if baffled by it, before slowly taking it, allowing Dean to heft him to his feet and make their way back to the cabin.
"You're going to have to. You can't go to the bar, they've already seen you, and someone needs to keep him alive while I'm out."
"You got your powers back?" Sam questioned.
Garth, much to Dean's relief, dropped the matter, brushing the dust from his hands onto his jeans. "Well, if you're sure." He smiled. "Do you want us to grab anything on the way back? Milk? Some paint?" He glanced around the room again. "You know, my cousin's an interior decorator, I bet he could give you guys a great deal on the place."
"Dean, don't-" Sam warned him, understanding the instinct to protect, to comfort. He'd tried it a few times himself, and each time was the same.
Castiel looked awkwardly around, looking down at the other bed. He had no need to sit, he could go for very, very long periods of time with no movement whatsoever. Not that he liked to; it was rather dull. But that was beside the point. Cas sat down awkwardly, perching on the edge of the second bed, opposite from Sam.
"Heaven's not exactly safe for him right now. They'd kill him the instant he got back up there."
"No, I'm up." Dean told him.
"This whole passage was ruined in the dark ages." He muttered, ripping out the page completely and crumpling it in his fist, dropping it on the desk.
Cas looked at him, amazed once more at the hunter. Each time he'd thought he understood the man, he'd find out something new, and this was no exception. Since he had returned, all he had seen of the hunter was his cold side, the front he'd put up so as nothing could hurt him again. He had feared that this is all he would ever see of him. But that moment, that admission of warmth...
Dean and Sam looked to each other, giving one another barely perceptible shrugs as they individually tried to think of a way out. Surely now would be the ideal time to make a break for it, while the two of the most powerful creatures around were busy snarking at each other.
Dean, however, had sat bolt upright, gasping for air but desperate to see what had happened. He saw the Leviathan crash into a pile of timber, half held up by it, and he saw someone else speed over to her, following almost as fast at the rate as the throw. It was a girl who now grabbed the Leviathan by the collar, hoisting it up and placing a palm flat against its forehead. Dean had the presence of mind to close his eyes for this part, and he saw the room behind his eyelids go bright with the light. He then heard a splatter, and he shielded his face from the black goop that sprayed out. When he opened them, he saw the girl drop the body in disgust, and turn around to look at him and Cas.
“Impressive.” She smiled, walking over to the window. “Do people not see in here? I mean you’ve got Fort Knox at the front door but back here you’ve just got windows?”
"I don't know!" He slammed down his drink, spilling it across the counter. "All I know is that for some crazed reason, I have to look after the damned idiot. It's my job. It's always my job."
“But, I’m uh…” Dean mumbled out, the words sluggish and shy, what little confidence he had was gone. “I’m thinking, now.”
“It’s been helping,” Cas explained. “Masturbation-”
Dean looked at his brother, watching how easily he was able to make contact. He felt a surge of... something, inside him. Jealousy? Anger?
"Cas, come on." Dean spat. He'd done this before, knew the drill, didn't even think.
"Demons?" Sam asked, but Balthazar didn't answer, deeming it unnecessary as black-eyed meat suits began to make their way into the room. Leading the group of at least a dozen was a surgeon, mask pulled down under his chin, blood splatters on his gown, and a scalpel in his hand.
"What's so bad about them?" Sam asked.
“Huh?” She asked, and he realised he said that last bit out loud.
Balthazar stood up.
. He wouldn’t like that answer, not after the weeks of sniping at each other about Cas going on hunts. He tamped it down, mollified when Cas backed up half a step. Dean looked at them both, nodding, before opening the door.
Sam paused, watching the angel. His face was stony, as ever, but he noticed the dewy shine in his eyes. The angel was hurting. He should've been able to turn to Dean... but Sam saw that right now, he couldn't.
He just had to, you know…. ask Cas out.
"Excuse me?"
"And your parent?"
“You told me
The peace she had longed for didn't come. Though, perhaps, what arrived was better.
"Dean was civil." Cas told him, then put some more thought into his answer. "He did not seem as... displeased to have me around as before."
"Because it'd be downright stupid to set one up over here. Barely any commuters."
Cas felt stung, almost as if Dean's slight disappointment then had been a physical blow. Sam shrugged.
They drove for hours without stopping. They knew they had to put a good distance between them and the hospital, and they certainly weren't going back to the motel. They needed somewhere safe and secure right now, and seeing as they didn't have Bobby's, they went to the next best thing; Rufus's cabin.
"You're the one who's going to see it every time you look in the mirror." He reminded him.
“Sure.” Sam responded, flicking to the next page.
“Anything interesting?” Dean asked, gesturing towards the paper, and Cas nodded idly as he took a bite of bacon.
"What do you mean?"
Cas shook his head. “I wasn’t privy to that knowledge. I’m sure whoever was assigned to watch over your family would know, but it wasn’t information deemed helpful to my mission.”
“There’s writing.” Cas said, tracing with fingertips what Dean had taken to be pigeon scratchings in the stone. They were
“Because somehow I don’t think
"Dean."
"Well, that's good." He said.
They stared at her, taking it in. A fresh start, no record, no paper trail. Just the monsters trying to hunt them. Dean looked to Sam, frowning at each other, and then he looked to Cas, who was staring at him, eyes full of something Dean couldn’t read. A fresh start.
"Atta, boy." She giggled, and he growled again, indignant at her patronising tone. He kissed further down, reaching her collar bone and licked along it, causing her to giggle again. Going further, he began to dip into cleavage, into the sainted area that men seemed to be so fascinated by.
“Oh my god, what is going
"A crossbow?" Dean asked, picking it up gingerly off the shelf to get a better look at it.
“Obviously not.” He quickly, said, ignoring Crowley’s mutterings behind him. “But I won’t deny Crowley’s story. He can tell all of hell how he tarnished the fallen angel that betrayed him.” Dean’s mouth fell open as he took in the words, and he wasn’t sure what was rolling through his mind. He only hoped it wasn’t all bad. He looked over to Crowley. “Heaven will think even less of me than ever. Degrade me as much as you like.”
"For me to become human."
This was foolish. Dean had made his feelings about Cas perfectly clear. There would be no repeats of that night at the club, there would be nothing to hope for there. He would be grateful, no, he
“Yes.”
A frown appeared on his face, and his lips pursed into a petulant grumble, clearly unhappy at being woken. "Come on, man." Dean sighed, trying again, and Cas's eyes cracked open, tired and unhappy to be awake.
“It will tear.” Cas groaned back, testing the muscle. He knew that was possible, and surely with it so tight right now, like a rock, this is when it would happen.
He thought back to the trench coat, lying alone but not forgotten in the trunk of the impala, many miles away from here. He had kept it, but he hadn't looked at it since the day he put it there. It wasn't like his Dad, it wasn't like Jo – he kept their things and used them, it was his way of remembering. The coat, Cas... he wanted to forget. But he never did.
"Yeah, right." Sam turned around, grabbing a zucchini. "You can eat like a pig all you want, I'm teaching Cas to eat so that he won't have a heart attack when he's fifty."
"Okay, where'd you want it?" She asked, all warmth and reassurance. Cas looked over to Dean, who shrugged. "Having trouble deciding?" She asked, sitting down.
“You really earned your room and board, huh?” He reached over for her, hugging her against his side for a few seconds, and she laughed, careful not to spill her coffee. He grabbed his own, sitting down at the table, and looked at Sam and Cas.
"Uh, there's one." Sam pointed to a small camera above the wall on the driveway.
“Apologise?”
Cas reached out, index finger extended, ready to touch Dean's forehead and transport them to where they needed to be, but stopped an inch from his skin. Dean winced in anticipation, but this quickly turned to confusion as he looked at Cas's fingers hovering before his face.
"No." Cas said firmly. "I do not need your expertise."
Dean could see his frustration. It had been months since Cas had given up his heavenly powers, since he had woken up human, and he knew it frustrated him no end. So easily injured, so slow in a fight. He was, in reality, practically as good as Sam and Dean at the business, but he knew he felt the ache of what once was. Dean just hoped what he got in return was enough to weigh that out.
The question was answered quickly. The ground seemed to give way beneath Cas's feet as he was knocked backwards, landing hard on his backside, and by the time he looked up, Dean wasn't there. He knew where he was, though. He scrambled to his feet and ran round the corner, blade raised to see Dean on the floor beneath the Leviathan.
Cas narrowed his eyes slightly, but did not react otherwise. "I feel indifference."
The elder Winchester barely let go of Cas, yelling at the Doctors that he needed to stay with him, that he couldn't leave him. Sam had to peel him away, promising him that he would see him soon.
kick?”
"No, she didn't." Sam corrected. "She took what she needed."
"What was that?" Dean asked, smug in his skills.
“Yeah, Jody it is.”
"Cas?" Sam tried, knowing that his calls were usually ignored, but tried nonetheless. No angel appeared.
"Are you suggesting that the ghost of Hilda is trying to kill this new wife?" Castiel asked, looking up at them both from the bed. Dean and Sam looked round, not having expected Cas to chime in on the conversation. Cas seemed unaware of their surprise, merely looking on in curiosity.
Light. The room pulsed, thrumming as long forgotten bulbs warms up, filaments sparking and warming and breathing to life around the room. Dean flicked the second lever and it got brighter, and the sound felt full, like engines.
Dean paused, hesitant. Then shook his head. "I don't care."
"Go to sleep, Cas."
It was Olivia who had spoken.
Dean hated clothes shopping.
"It is a blessing." She said. "Many envy you."
Sam kicked him again, and Dean jolted slightly. “Cas being a guy?”
“If you say so.” She sighed, frowning as she looked at the screen. “Yeesh, how old is this?”
Bill frowned, clearly getting more suspicious by the minute. "I'm sorry, but what does this have to do with my heating?"
"Really? You think I hadn't noticed that?" Dean retorted. He ran his hand through his hair, looking around in the vain hope that the angel may have appeared without him noticing. "He does that. He doesn't always come when we call."
"I think you boys can handle these?" Balthazar called back, sarcasm evident in his voice.
"Cas?!" Dean stood up, to his feet in an instant, watching, hyper alert for a few seconds as he watched the man's chest. It still wasn't moving.
“Yeah, I know hunters are paranoid bastards.” She laughed. “Run your checks, probably the person who deleted your records can take a good look at all this, who, by the way, will have a job offer. But this is happening, with or without you. I just think it’ll be a hell of a lot better with your help.”
"I heard you needed some help with a vermin problem." Livvie said, looking at them, and to Sam, a smug grin on her face. "Figured I might be able to lend a hand."
Three months later Penny demanded an explanation. Why did she not get morning sickness? Why could she heal herself? Why would she randomly find herself in a place she hadn't been a minute before? And why, not always, but sometimes, did he look different? Inexplicably, totally, different; a winged beast, beautiful and horrifying to behold?
Cas frowned, trying to understand. He thought they’d established that they were currently
“So what happened, how’d the hunt go?” He took a sip, ignoring how it burnt his lips. They felt raw. “You’re both still alive, so good?”
"Huh?" Dean winced, trying to remember, swimming again through the foggy memories.
Somehow, Cas had managed to recreate that with a paper cut.
"You might want to go inside soon; Dean's going to need your help with research."
“Please don’t.” Cas sighed, fully aware that this was now far beyond his remedial first aid skills.
"Perhaps not."
“What?” Dean looked at him then, eyes making contact, and he saw the hurt, the flicker of regret in Cas’s eyes. Oh, god, the regret. A surge of panic rose in Dean’s chest. “What do you mean?”
herself in a fight.” She nodded, eyes going wistful and dreamy for a minute before looking back at Dean. “You didn’t think there was anything…” She trailed off, using the bottle to gesture between the two of them.
"It is one of heaven's weapons," Cas told them as he turned it over in his hands. "Forged during Lucifer's rebellion, impervious to angelic powers." He looked up to Dean, amazement in his eyes. "This is Michael's bow, only he or his vessel can wield it."
Sam waited, staring at Dean.
you.”
"This one." Sam pointed, and Dean slowed the car to a stop. They both stared at it.
Dean’s excitement reached fresh peaks when the followed the hallway along, finding bedrooms in the first direction he picked. Some had multiple beds, clearly an overflow dorm for backup, but there were several comfortable solo rooms. Dean’s face had lit up, disbelief shining for a minute as he looked around it, looking at the bed, the walls, the dressers. He checked, there were plenty of rooms, more than enough for one each for the all of them. “My own room.” Dean had murmured, freezing for a minute as he took it in. He hadn’t realised Cas had been near, shaking himself off.
"It didn't fit!" Dean explained. "It was too big and your damn tie was always on backwards."
"Thought you were going to bed?" Sam lay back down on the floor, moving his hands to his temples. Dean's body felt so bored of being stationary that he almost considered joining him.
Dean tapped his hand on his chest, firmly. “It happens sometimes, it’s fine.”
Cas could feel the cold metal of the shelves digging into his back, and under his hands where he gripped it tight behind him. He wasn’t touching Dean, he couldn’t, couldn’t, couldn’t touch, couldn’t kiss him back. He was kissing him back, lips moving against Dean-
No response. The light drew closer, having engulfed Cas's ear, and beginning on his shoulder, throwing shadows in the creases of the hospital pyjama's he still wore.
“Stanford.” He said proudly, folding his arms across his chest. “Aced it first try.”
long deciding on one of the pairs of jeans, the darker ones, and the soft green shirt he’d selected for himself. He’d seen Dean staring at it while they shopped.
Dean landed on his back with a thud, and Cas felt the air leave his lungs in a forceful exhale.
She reached out to Dean and grabbed his neck, pushing him against the bookcase. Cas looked around frantically, seeing Dean had dropped his poker. He tried to frantically remember where he had put his own, realising he must have dropped it somewhere in the house. Stepping forward he grabbed at the ghost, but his grip had no effect; there was a reason you don't pick a fist fight with a spirit.
"No, man. Paul's as straight as they come. Stu's the one with the boyfriend. He works in a bank." His face broke into a smile, looking out of the widow a he pulled over the car. "We're here!"
Dean stood, flicking off the screen and dropping the remote on the couch. "Didn't we have an anti-possession charm in the car? Been floating around for ages."
"Her spirit must be drawn to that location." Cas suggested, and Bill looked confused again.
“We’ve been through a lot. We’ve put each other through a lot. And I have hurt you and Sam… so many times. When I came back you were right to not rejoice.”
Dean felt a gnaw of worry building inside him as he looked at the angel. He was hunching slightly, chin dipped a little too low. And then Dean saw it. Starting at the hands, a drip. One black drip. And at the mouth too. The ears, soaking the underarm of his trenchcoat.
Panic was setting in now as Dean pushed down harder each time on Castiel's chest. He didn't think of ribs, or bruising, or anything apart from getting his heart moving again. He could stay in a coma as long as he wanted, so long as he didn't just let go.
Sam chuckled softly. "Right?"
"It's got surveillance, too." Sam noted.
The younger Winchester watched as his brother left the room, wrapping his jacket around himself in the cold chill of the air. Sam didn't see much possibility of Cas getting possessed in the car journey from the cabin to the nearest town, but he knew what his brother was considering. Dean was powerfully protective over his family, showing care to them that he showed little of to himself. If it made Dean feel better, Cas could wear the charm until he had something more permanent.
He shrugged nonchalantly, disappointed, but not offended. "Whatever you want. Another?"
Shaking his head, he continued on, frown deepening as he picked up a bible, flicking through at random. It had printed annotations, linking forward and back through the text, claiming verses meant something when linked with other parts of the word of God. An astonishing amount led back to Leviticus. Furthermore, many texts had been altered so far past basic translation that the real meaning of each passage was unrecognisable.
“They got my manager. He was a creep, and a bit useless, but I saw them eat him in the parking lot. Like, with my own eyes.” She looked around at the men in front of her, waiting for confirmation, but no one spoke. It was true. “And I thought I was going crazy, right? Like usually I know the difference between reality and fiction but this was seriously blending the line.”
“The guitar,” Dean finally said, and Cas looked up, blinking back into the conversation. “I had a friend back in the day, Lee, we jammed together for a while. We weren’t any good, but I picked up a few things.”
"Cos, I gotta stow this." Dean continued, talking to the shoulder. "I can't let Sammy go out and hunt instead of me. That's not how him and me work. And I know you get that." Dean paused watching as the light slowly crept over, not beginning to catch on the stubble of Cas's jaw.
The second part of the dream took a while to solidify. For the first few months it never would, only staying down there, tearing and ripping and slicing and dicing and he would wake up screaming. The first time that Castiel appeared in his dream to save him was the first time that Cas had been there when he woke up.
"Well, yes?" He looked confused. "I- I did? How did you know?"
Cas finally looked back to him, watching Dean in silence. Dean shifted under the scrutiny, and he tried really hard to hold his gaze, but eventually he cracked, resting his head against his hands on the railing.
"And she kept talking about Cas..."
He dragged his finger back to the edge of Cas's lower lip, and the pressure was enough to just slightly part them. The tickle of warm breath landed on Dean's fingers, and he jerked back, pulling his hand back to his chest and stepped away.
"I don't have to go if you need me here." Sam told him, taking a step forwards, ducking his chin and hunching down slightly, bringing himself down to Dean's height. "Garth knows other hunters who can back him up."
"A little." He seemed confused at the notion that blowing ones nose made you feel better whilst crying, and Dean nodded, laying back down.
Cas turned him around, slamming him against another non-existent wall.
“He was up before me,” Dean shrugged, and Sam shot him a look. “When I walked past his room. Door open, bed empty.”
“You don’t just have to take it, though.” Sam continued, and Cas looked at him. “Him yelling at you, you backing down.”
"Shut up. Get the door."
“Your winnings. Take it to monopoly and you could sweep up in the hotel biz.”
"CASTIEL, YOU BASTARD!" The girl yelled, and both Dean and Sam turned to look at her. She had risen off the rock, and, panting heavily, was screeching angrily at the water. "I'M GOING TO KILL YOU!"
"That was quick." He commented, cracking open the can. "Is the vending machine haunted?"
“It’s not, I don’t have panic attacks.” His words came out rushed.
"You believe that?" Cas asked.
When he reached his room he started pulling items from his bag. He tried to check them, see what was clean and what was dirty, but he ended up throwing them all on the floor. What was the point, put them all through the wash, they were in the same bag.
Before he had the chance to decide, his phone began to ring in his pocket.
"And going to Pamela?" She questioned indignantly. "Going to another psychic." She sighed.
The next morning started much like any other for Dean. He woke up with a pounding headache, with near debilitating nausea, and emotions that he didn't want to think about churning in his stomach. He groaned and rolled over, wincing at the sunlight creeping in through the curtains.
“Yes.” That was fair. “I am not a child. I am capable, I can fight, I can hunt, I can be a functioning human being.”
"I'm sure it does." Zedkiel replied, watching Livvie. "Are you doing what I think you're doing?"
“I want to look at this myself.” Cas repeated.
"You're going to laugh at me if I tell you he's a changed man, aren't you?"
"Didn't you go to bed like, two hours ago?" Dean asked, blinking at the man, only noticing as the book was lowered that Cas seemed to be naked, or at least, from the waist up.
Dean's hand moved noticeably towards his gun again, but she stopped him.
“Cas, that’s pure sugar.” Sam laughed at him.
If you read please leave a comment, I could do with the serotonin!
"Did she say anything... I dunno, weird? Out of the ordinary?" Dean shrugged.
Cas was… surprised, to say the least. He was definitely aware that Dean had been avoiding him since he’d spoken to him last night. A large part of Cas regretted it, felt sure that it was the wrong choice to make, that he should’ve carried on as he was. Humans routinely would go for extended periods of time between sexual partners, Jimmy himself had gone without for 5 months in his marriage at one point without too much struggle. Was it too much to ask for Castiel to do the same, to be content with his own skills?
"It healed up a while ago. The handprint. I think it was after the whole apocalypse showdown." He stroked the flesh, tracing where he remembered the edges being. "Man, I hated that thing. Made for real awkward conversations when I was with the ladies. But, I dunno... now I kinda miss it." He looked up and forced a smile at the man, who didn't offer a response. When he'd had it, it'd felt like a brand, singling him out, a great big "over here" marker. Or even worse, like he'd been claimed. Like it was Cas's tramp-stamp plastered on his shoulder. But now that it was gone, he understood it; it wasn't a claim, it was a promise. It was a sign that someone cared for Dean the way he'd been caring for Sam his whole damn life.
"Dean..." Sam said quietly.
“It will be warded.” Cas spoke, deep in thought as he stared at the door, coming closer to take a look. “I doubt brute force will be an effective method of entry.”
“Oh, no, god no.” He said quickly, mind briefly considering and dismissing it. He hadn’t sure what it had been in the last few days but the thought hadn’t crossed his mind once, thinking of her as more of a little sister than anything else. She frowned.
"It's only nine." He told him, and Cas looked apologetic.
“You found the pain…”
They would never grow old together.
“Yes.”
The Leviathan's grin widened, and suddenly it snapped, jaw splitting wide, teeth flashing, huge black gaping hole ready to devour Dean down whole. Cas strained, unable to reach his weapons as he watched helpless as-
Livvie straightened up, furrowing her brow, taken aback. "Do you expect me to be looking forward to this? It's necessary, but it's not exactly how I'd like to be spending my Friday afternoon."
Apparently so.
He brushed the hair from the back of his neck where it had already began to tickle lower than it used to, and pulled it up, tugging firmly in frustration. He recognised a word for what he was feeling was
Sam looked at the spread, a surprised smile lifting his face. “You made breakfast? After last night?”
"Uh, yeah." Sam nodded, glancing over to Dean. No need to spoil the plot of the next film.
He was looking out of the passenger window, but Dean could just about see his face, could see he was clenched, could hear his breathing, slightly more forcefully than usual. His elbow was propped up on the windowsill of the car door, and he was worrying his lips with his fingers.
After two days in the hospital, Dean had to make a very quick run to the car to smuggle in some whiskey. Despite the difficulty he had in tearing himself away, the second he got outside the need to run hit him. He itched to leave, to drive far away, leave all this behind; his brother and his angel, leave everything behind that was too much for the emotionally stunted hunter to deal with. But despite his urge to run, the urge to run back was stronger, to return to the bedside of his friend to wait for something that may never come.
"Fine." Sam said, smirking at him. "You finish off."
And with it being him, not Sam, well… Cas has got eyes, after all. And taste apparently.
"I can't believe you're actually suggesting this!" Dean cried.
"I've never put one on without angelic assistance." He muttered, and Dean couldn't help but look up, smiling at the quip.
“Please tell me you did vegetables, Dean.” Sam groaned, and Dean rolled his eyes, grabbing the dish full of brightly coloured foods and sliding it towards his brother, watching as he loaded his plate. Sam complained about how much he’d have to do to work off all this food, but he was happy, smiling, and so was Dean. And so was Cas.
“Don’t you wanna know why?” Dean asked, and he couldn’t help a tone of pleading come out in his voice. He sounded pathetic, desperate for Cas’s attention, and he couldn’t help it.
He wondered if Cas would like Spring. The guy could probably wax poetical about some religious ritual, the birth of life, or something.
Cas was clearly too thrown to take it all in, and Dean recognised that look, he’d looked at him the exact same way a couple of years ago at the brothel. But maybe tonight would go better, now that Cas actually wanted it. He felt a spark of guilt for not preparing him more, for not talking him through it outside, but he’d not wanted the conversation, the talk about
Dean shrugged. “Few hundred?”
Dean had wandered away while Cas was talking to the bee lady. She had been telling him all about the local bee population, had even invited him to see how she keeps her hives on her honey farm. She sold him carefully packeted wildflower seeds in brown envelopes with handwritten labels. Despite Dean’s reservations about bugs getting into the bunker, he planned to carefully seed the grassland around the entrance. Dean may not be aware of how much he needed pollinators for his continued existence, but Cas was. If he was to be one extra human using this planet’s finite resources, the least he could do was contribute.
He heard Cas laugh, and the sound was amazing. He rolled over to face Cas and felt his heart stutter at the sight. Cas, hair a complete mess, eyes so beautifully blue, so open, so present. He couldn’t believe he was here with him, he couldn’t believe he got to have Cas in his bed, in his arms, in his mouth, between his legs. This wasn’t something he was really allowed to have, was it? He tried to clamp down on the alarm system shouting
"Is there any need?" Sam questioned. "She doesn't look like she's looking for a fight."
"She's coming over. She says angels aren't really her thing, but she'll have a look."
"What are you, a hippy?" He asked, the joke catching in his throat. Hair a little longer, stubble just a bit thicker, and he'd look just like him.
The bartender visibly drooped. "Girlfriend?"
"Nightmare." Sam commented redundantly, taking a step forward, towards Dean.
"You and Sam should be hunting, and I should leave."
“Yeah. To be honest… it’s about time.” Sam laughed a little, and Dean blinked at his words. “I’ve been fed up of you guys dancing around each other. It’s really annoying.”
The night air was cool, and the walk back to the bunker was fast, not enough time to collect his thoughts. Memories kept coming unbidden; the way John had left them for a month after Dean had fucked up, how the money got thin so he stole, how John had left him to rot when he police caught him. How John had sent him on a hunt alone on his 17
"He's our cousin."
"Yeah, you're right." Sam scoffed. "Next time I'll let a few get me before I take them out."
He didn't quite know what he was looking for. He knew there wasn't much of anything about angels in the stash of books they had, even less in the journal, and the internet's wealth of information on angels had a lot of junk to sift through before there was anything even minutely helpful.
“Yes.” He answered.
He could call Sam, Sam would help. But then he would have to explain why, and he didn’t know if Dean would be okay with him telling Sam.
The angel stood apart from the child. Huge, yet suddenly so feeble, fragmented and weak alone in this environment without shelter.
“So you guys are all set?” She asked, a little nervously, and Dean looked back to her.
Dean coughed, breaking eye contact and looking away, rubbing a hand against the back of his neck. “I, uh, I thought you were handling that pretty well on your own.”
"They have been warned not to."
"Holy crap, Sammy!" Dean spluttered out, instincts kicking in as he reached for the gun stashed down the side of the cushions in the chair. "What is it?!"
"Baby." Dean mocked. "S'barely anything."
The air between them was hot and addictive. They stayed there, just kissing, hands stroking up and around each other, and Dean found himself being pressed back against the railing, the feel of it digging into his back and a low groan rumbled from his chest when Cas used his hand to turn Dean’s chin, to kiss along his neck. When Dean finally managed to get a hand beneath Cas’s shirt he shivered. Could feel goosebumps spread under his hand. Oh, right, February.
But there was nothing going on there. Not yet. All the better for the boys to stake it out, see if there was anything remarkable about the place.
"Where were you?" Cas asked, glancing up as he carefully place the meat in the hissing pan. "I came downstairs and you weren't here."
"Fine!" He cried, exasperated. "He- I talked to him."
Dean's jaw set, anger flashed in his eyes. Cas was taken aback; he had seen that look many times in the last day, but that one felt different. He didn't feel like it was aimed at him. It was protective, it was hurt, and for Cas, it was hope.
“Another.” He gestured to the bartender, an empty glass in front of him. The world was his oyster tonight. He hadn’t really seen much of what this town had to offer, but this bar was a damn good start. The chicks in this town were fine too.
“His church had misguided ideas about sexuality.” Cas remembered. “Jimmy himself wasn’t a cruel man, but he would have judged this poorly.”
“You told me
The days were slow. He used to notice time but was separate from it, could conceptualise its passing in ways to make them blink past in a flash, or slow for long enough to pace a battle. Now each second ticked along independent of his will, sometimes in a flash but usually at a plod. Somehow he liked it. It made him feel small and inconsequential, and despite everything… it was comforting. He held less weight than he used to. He could only do what he could do, such as feed the bees, compost their waste, and love Dean.
Cas looked him up and down, even though he knew perfectly well what Dean was wearing. He too was wearing his suit, no tie like he usually would, and was wearing a simple white shirt under it, undone at the collar to show his clavicle. Abruptly Cas was struck with how it might taste to lick it, how Dean would smell if he pressed his nose there and inhaled deep. Of course Dean looked good. “Dean, you have always been beautiful.”
"I doesn't really make me like you, no."
"Yes," he told her simply, snatching a pen from the desk. He opened a page at random, and a verse within it. "The word placement here is all wrong-" he started scribbling out words, replacing them overhead. "The translation here is awful. There is no way anyone remotely competent could have made the translation from 'adulterous' to 'homosexual'. Which, for the record, is not a sin."
"Yeah, I got that, thanks." Dean muttered back, not taking his eyes off the small figure.
Cas rolled his eyes, an expression he had picked up from the hunter a long time ago, and reached back in. However, this time, instead of finding a tape, his finger hit something sharp, running along the flesh and slicing it.
. It would be okay. He just needed to cool off, he needed to calm down, to have a shower, to relieve himself. It was stress, and attraction. It could be overcome.
Oh, god, he was gonna be late. He set off twenty minutes early, but now he was half an hour late and he still didn’t know which room it was. He’d tried countless doors already, each one leading him straight into the maw of another monster. This door was a rugaru, and he pushed the table in between them to charge through, heading for the door on the other side. He could hear it snarling behind him, but he shoved the door shut as he went through, pressing his weight as he struggled to find a lock. He could feel the rugaru clawing at it, but he couldn’t worry too hard about it - he was running late.
“Your first ever date,” Dean started, and Cas looked back to him. “You nervous?”
And inevitably… “Deal.”
“You wanna say anything?” Sam asked, and Dean cleared his throat, blinking around the moisture in his eyes he hadn’t realised was there.
Objectively, he knows now that those eyes are just eyes, that Cas can’t see into his soul any more, that he can only see the surface and what Dean chooses to share. But they haven’t lost their intensity, they haven’t stopped making Dean feel completely laid bare.
Cas had seen him at his worst. What happened in the dream? Cas walked in when he was torturing someone, but it wasn’t quite Cas… it had drifted away…
“Yes, but-”
"The onions aren't affecting me." He replied, peering into the pot. Surprisingly, he found the smell of the meat frying delicious, even if the sight in front of him did remind him vaguely of the substance he ate when touched by famine's influence.
Betty smiled. "Okay." She picked up her things. "I'll leave you to it."
"Tom." He told her.
“Deal.” Crowley spoke finally, and it was done. They were safe. Cas… Cas was safe. Safe from Crowley’s threats, his life was safe. His reputation… was another matter. How could Cas just throw that away?
“Can you just-” Dean tried, unable to look at Cas, looking blindly at the stalls around them. “You’re- I’m-” He sucked in a breath, trying to piece together the words that in his head were just a confused jumble, and when he laid them out carefully they just said... “I don’t know.”
"Hey!" Dean yelled at the ghost, and she looked round. "Over here, bitch!" He yelled.
“Eugh, okay.” Sam shook off his shoulders.
"That's our job." Sam agreed, pulling away as Dean finished, rolling his shoulder.
Dean didn't let himself admit it, but he wanted it too. He'd tried so hard with Ben and Lisa. He fit there, he really did. Making breakfast, real, proper breakfast for people, barbeques out on the back lawn, carpool and bedtime. He had done it all so well. It had disturbed him, at first, how well he fit into it. But there had always been an itch, that itch to get away, to hunt, to find something to kill. There was always going to be something evil, something wrong out there and he probably had it in his power to stop it. How could he rest at night knowing that others were dying in his place?
When dinner was served Cas was sore, new muscles used that Cas could only guess at names for, suddenly exhausted. But Dean was so happy, so eager to pile food onto Cas’s plate and for them all to devour the bacon-wrapped turkey and roast potatoes and gravy and mash and-
"Yeah, who's that then?" Dean stared at him, waiting for an answer. "One of Raphiel's followers? One of the angel's who were gung-ho on the apocalypse idea?" He shrugged. "Or was it one of the hundreds that you smited when you were playing your hand at being God?" He took a step forward. "Who did you kill?"
“I’m growing food with the intention to eat it.” Cas pointed out, and yeah, fair point. Still, Cas wasn’t exactly beholden with cooking prowess.
“Guess not,” He shrugged, replaying the last few days back, recalling watching The Empire Strikes Back. “Though, you were really into Princess Leia the other night.”
"And now I'm telling you to go." He shouted. "Just go! We don't want you! Go find some other idiots to follow around!"
Dean took another sip of the beer, moving from the doorframe to the armchair in the corner. It was facing the bed, meaning he still had a good view on the man, and he didn't feel quite so lurky.
Cas nodded, mentally berating himself, steadying the shot. He took it in both hands, one on the grip, the other covering the first, and after a second, squeezed the trigger. The shot went wide, rustling through a tree behind it, and Dean nodded slowly. "That's okay. Don't expect you to get it the first time. You got the grip right..."
Sam wasn't in. Cas looked around in confusion for a moment, before walking to the kitchen. He could feel the winter chill beginning to bite into his flesh, but judging by the way the skin on his back was starting to itch, he decided he would deal better with the cold. Apparently the pain of initially applying the ink was not bad enough.
"Everything that happens to us is shit, Sammie." Dean sighed. "The people we get close to die; we keep dying, but we just can't get out of it. When do we get to be done?" Dean downed his glass of water, and poured another. "So for God's sake... let me drink."
“Oh.”
She raised her eyebrows before sliding off the stool, leaning over and taking the collar of the shirt between her fingers, tugging it down to get a better look. "Matching tattoos, huh?" She smiled. "Neat."
He took in one more deep breath, from the chest this time, and dropped his hand. He rolled his shoulders back and straightened his posture, which was progressively becoming more and more drooped since becoming human. He would need to keep an eye on that.
Garth raised his eyebrows. "Man, oops." He giggled. "Bobby always made 'em sound like they were. 'If those idjits would stop with the damn bedroom eyes, we coulda stopped three apocalypses by now.'" He imitated, in what, Sam had to admit, was actually quite close.
"Well, you could've. And that was Mum's statue!"
Ten minutes later, Cas had reluctantly put on some clothes. He'd chosen the soft green jumper, wincing at the feel of it on his skin, though determined not to scratch it. If he scratched it, he might scar it, distorting the image, making the entire ordeal pointless.
"Isn't there anything you can do to speed this up?" Dean asked.
The first time Cas left the bunker, the anxiety radiating from Dean was palpable, as if Demons were waiting to jump him in an instant. Cas saw right through the walk the three of them took together, the two of them jumping into action as soon as they saw him heading to the door, but there was no one around, the area quiet.
Dean froze, every muscle in his body seizing up as his mind ground to a halt.
"If you don't mind sharing a room." Dean shrugged. "Whatever." He reached out a hand, offering it to his friend. "We should get going. Got stuff we need to get done today."
He pulled away from her, looking her in the eye. "You just don't stop talking, do you?"
Dean looked up at him, taking him in. "Which time are you now?" He groaned, and Cas cocked his head, looking confused.
It wasn’t a wedding ring, it was way too fancy. But giving a ring to someone meant something, Dean knew that much. He’d never got Lisa a ring, though had thought about it. Knew it was the next step.
are, you’re not.” He said firmly.
“And, uh, you weren’t in danger
“But not today.” Cas said.
They drove in silence for a while longer. The cassette ran out, but Dean didn't bother changing it. The last one hadn't brightened his mood any. It was an hour and a half before anyone spoke again.
Breathe in.
They could have talked about it then. Sam could have brought up the fact that he knew what Dean had done for a bit of extra cash over the years. Dean could have told him he'd jerked off and right at the crucial moment, Cas had been the cause. Sam could have told Dean that sometimes guys marry guys, and to get over it. Dean could have told Sam how the black eye he got when he was nineteen wasn't from a hunt, but was from John when he was caught.
Dean woke not long after. Sam decided to wake him this time; his nightmare seemed worse than the day before. Again he called out Cas's name as he woke. However, today he almost punched Sam in the jaw for his efforts.
“What happened was… I didn’t want to pressure you into anything, make you feel like you had to-”
“Dean!” Cas shouted out, pointing frontwards. “Crowley.”
"See? How the hell am I meant to get it up if you're saying stuff like that?"
Dean nodded shakily, and Cas stepped forwards, wrapping his arms around him, standing strong for Dean. For a second he was stiff, but then he melted into Cas, bones sagging as his body ached for the warm touch. He pressed his forehead into Cas’s shoulder, the press of skin on skin heated, clammy, needed. “I’m sorry.” He whispered, and he felt tears drop from his eyes.
“Did Dean really say I would be good at this game?”
"Maybe not you." He agreed. "But, I'm sure they have a shot at dispensing with the cattle behind you." He flashed his teeth in a grin to the angel. "And don't bother trying to zap the lot of you out; I've angel-proofed the place." He looked to the Winchesters, who had been, as subtly as possible, trying to unplug Castiel from everything connecting him to the hospital; they were lucky he wasn't tethered into life support.
Tommy nodded and vanished back into the storeroom. Dean then turned his attention back to the bartender.
One half of him was strong. One half believed completely and wholly that Cas would wake up and return to him, strong and resolute, the best friend that he ever had.
Dean waited for Cas to open his eyes. He could see the veins spider-webbed across his eyelids, his eyelashes fanned across his cheeks. Sweat sparkled on his forehead, droplets in his hair, and Dean gently swept his hair back with a hand, wiping across his forehead, softened out the crease between the eyebrows. He could feel Cas’s breathing settle against his skin, and then his eyes were open, bright, blue, wide. Trusting, hopeful. Happy. Dean smiled, truthful, and gently pressed a kiss to his mouth, lazy, slow, no rush anymore. Fuck, this felt good.
"Ha ha." He dryly retorted. "And for the last freaking time, he's not my-" Dean paused, replaying her words. "What do you mean?"
Dean frowned, trying to remember, before snapping his fingers in triumph. “No, those were actual fairies.”
“Leviathans,” Dean told her. “Trying to smoke us out.”
He glanced at Dean, who was steadfastly looking at the road ahead, and Cas turned to do the same.
"You need to fix that." Dean pointed out.
He was dimly aware of someone speaking to him, and he blinked back to the present. The line around him had moved, but he’d fallen out of it, stuck in front of the ring cabinet. A man across from him wearing a nametag, but Dean couldn’t take his name in. He was asking if he could help, if Dean wanted something from the cabinet.
The demons stopped, and the familiar sight of black smoke escaping from bodies appeared, dozens at once being sent back to hell as they got sucked through the floor. The meat suits crumpled shortly after, none remaining upright; whether unconscious or dead, it was impossible to tell.
right now, completely wrecked and falling apart at the edges, the angel-not-angel so lost in the physical sensations of his body and…. and in Dean, in him….
"I'll make sure to send a postcard." A voice rang out from behind them, and the boys span to the source of the voice, the English accent evident immediately. "Or... I could just kill you now."
“Are we still friends?”
Dean shook his head, feeling like he had water in his ears. “Dancing- what?”
Dean glared. "Shut it."
"Tell me about it." Dean replied, handing over the twenty. He turned, eyes catching the shelf, the leaflets that he had just straightened out but failed to pay proper attention to.
"Lie down." He busied himself, tugging the pillows so they were flat. "You can't sleep like that."
“I should let you shower.” He said quickly, hearing Cas agree as he left the room. He charged to his own room, shutting the door behind him and locking it quickly, leaning back against the door, letting his head loll back.
Cas frowned at it as if offended. "I don't require alcohol to get through this." He told him.
Dean did this five times, not stopping to think, mind solely focused on the task. This he could do.
"No guns, darling."
"I feel I have the right to know." Zedkiel sighed. "It seems only fair."
He put it out of his mind long enough to burn the bodies of the vampires, though Garth insisted on finding a clearing to do it in, claiming his uncle was a Forest Ranger, and that fires like that were dangerous is wooded areas. Afterwards, while Garth looted the cabin, Sam called again. Still no answer. Here is when he started to worry.
Under the radio that Dean had swiftly put on, the car was quiet. Really,
“Shit.” Dean swore, grimacing as the sound rang through again.
“Yes.” Cas spoke gruffly, still gripping her arm, and Sam produced a silver knife.
"I said," She hissed through gritted teeth, staring at Cas. "You won't ruin this for me."
"No-one but your boyfriend calls me that. I can't be bothered to correct the idiot."
They stayed a few minutes in uncomfortable silence, neither speaking, before Sam grabbed his phone and left the room, claiming he had to make some calls.
She sighed, looking down at the comatose man and back to Sam. "Sammy, do you want a word of advice?"
Sam sighed. "Fine, Dean; whatever gets you through the day." He reached into the boot and fished out some clothes before he shut it, and walked past Dean to get back into the motel. "What's the bar called?"
"I took my eyes off him for two seconds!"
Under Sam's instructions, like the night before, he retrieved the packet of bacon, pouring some oil into the pan.
"You encountered Olivia?" Worry mingled with the anger in Cas's face. "She didn't hide this time?"
"Not much." Sam shrugged, taking off his jacket and sitting down.
He shook himself, clearing his head. It was just a dream.
“I mean, if there’s anything you wanted to talk about with, and with Dean, or not with Dean, you can talk to me.” Sam stumbled over his words, and Cas squinted, trying to piece it together.
“Go easy on him.” Sam mumbled, sleep already clawing at the edges. It could be real easy to fall asleep in the car, years of practice. “You’ll give him emotional whiplash if you keep this up.”
"Yeah." Dean told him. "Didn't get anything useful."
"Much has changed since you have left. With no leader left to speak of, it has descended into anarchy." She shrugged. "However, since angels don't have much of a concept of free will, it is hardly a tragic event. Many are happier now."
“Obviously.”
“How about I teach you how to find academic journals online?” Sam suggested as he started picking through the clothes.
But Cas shook his head, gripping Dean’s hand and tugging him towards him as Cas stepped into his space, curling a hand around the back of Dean’s neck and pulling them together in a kiss as gentle as it was urgent. It was as though the air had left the room, the sudden movement leaving Dean almost dizzy and his senses zeroing in on Cas, his lips, his breath, his hand on his neck. When Dean felt his hand work its way into his jacket and to his back Dean instinctively grabbed back, two hands on Cas’s waist and pulling him closer, gently, feeling their chest flush together, their hips.
“Go to sleep.”
He splashed cold water on his face, looking at his reflection in the mirror. A tiny part of him wondered if it had changed at all since Cas had last seen it, if the brow was more furrowed, if the lips tilted down at the edges, if his eyes had lost some of the shine.
"Some angels, occasionally, fall into temptation." He told them. "And that can result in... unsavoury consequences."
"Cos she's a sadistic bitch, that's why." Dean chimed in. "She's trying to make him scared. She's torturing him."
"It's breezing to it... like..."
"What, me?" Dean scoffed. "You're trying to set me up. She hot? Because if I'm going to get her killed, she better be hot."
"There isn't an after. There will never be an after. We just keep going until something kills us."
while all that was happening, he’d barely been able to process it, and it hadn’t exactly lasted long, but still. Cas was probably completely unaffected, and that was worse, that was downright embarrassing-
“What?!”
Cas would be happy for him, but something sat wrong in his gut as he pictured it.
At half 4 he decided he'd had enough. He was out of beer, and the nap on the bench had sobered him up enough. He thought back to the car and winced, remembering it still at the bar, knowing it was an idiot move to leave it there when Olivia was still about. He knew driving it to the park woulda been a bad shout, but he should've driven it back to the motel in the first place, instead of drinking himself into a belligerent mess. Why did he always do this? It went round in his head as he hurried back to the bar, thankfully still finding it there, with the contents of the trunk still full. He was still over the legal limit, but the roads were empty and he was a pro. He made his way back, carefully, going about five the whole way. Being careful, and procrastinating. But soon enough he found himself back at the motel, and taking a steeling breath, entered.
"Sure it was." Sam coddled. "You didn't match the description at all."
“Oh god.”
“Live a little, Sammy.” Dean teased, sliding him a plate with all the fruity sides he’d already got out. “You earned it.”
They had been driving for about ten minutes. Sam had been examining the crossbow for almost the entire time, trying to glean some hidden meaning in it whilst he planned strategies.
"Yeah, you're probably right." Sam shrugged.
He let himself look back up to Cas. He was watching him carefully, brow furrowed in worry, and Dean reached out to soothe it, to smooth the crease away. Dude was gonna get lines soon, fresh ones, new ones, ones that were all Cas’s own. They would suit him. “I’m sorry.” He whispered between them, and Cas smiled softly.
But she was fast too. She narrowed her eyes, spotting the weapon heading towards her with ease, and extended her hand, ready to push it away with an arrogant sweep.
This chapter reveals my ideal ending for Supernatural - tell me what you think.
Cas didn't look at her, instead frantically craned to see past her. "Dean!" He called, seeing the man's limbs flailing slightly at the lack of oxygen. He knew somewhere in the back of his head that Sam was dealing with his own Leviathan upstairs. This hadn't been a research mission, someone had laid a trap for them.
“Don’t want them getting soft on me, Sammy.” He laughed, rinsing his hands before picking up a potato and the knife.
. “Uh….” He plucked through them, getting no further.
As his confidence grew, he climbed faster, though regretted it pretty soon when the ivy in his hand gave way and his foot below slid.
"You want a bedtime story too?" He cranked the smile back on his face, happiness not faded, the fact that Cas was there, with him, good enough. "Night, Cas." He kicked a foot out, tapping Cas gently on the back of the knee. He stumbled slightly, surprised by the jolt. "You're making me miss the film."
"Were you not expecting me to?" He replied, and Sam raised his eyebrows, quickly backtracking.
Cas didn't answer, not quite knowing how to respond. Instead he followed Dean out of the motel and into the car. The stereo was already on loud, pre-emptively drowning out the awkwardness that was going to occur. Cas opened the door and sat down, closing the door behind him. Dean didn't look at his passenger, instead just starting the car.
Then he began to change. She saw him turn into someone she had never met before, turning back into the Balthazar he had once been, millennia before. He started to work for good. He changed history. He became a spy. He worked for the forbidden Winchesters whilst he betrayed his only friend.
Dean grinned, pulling a large pink carcass from a bag, hefting it onto the metal counters with glee. “And now I can.” His eyes were warm when he looked at Cas, grateful, if a little hesitant. Cas nodded at him, not saying more.
"Of course." Cas replied slowly. Dean hadn't mentioned it. "Uh, so what else happened?" He queried, and Sam leant back in his seat.
Dean sighed, pinching the bridge of his nose. Then, Sam's words hit him. Lifting his head, he peered out the window. "Cameras? Where?"
Dean had never felt connected to this spot, not like Sam. They’d dropped by a couple times over the years, but it had seemed weird to stop in town without dropping by, so here they were, over Mom’s gravestone on a Tuesday afternoon in February. It was Sam’s suggestion, and Dean didn’t oppose it, but dutifully standing over Mom’s last physical resting place felt a little redundant in their line of work. This had never been where he’d felt her, and today was no exception.
Dean had already stopped watching Balthazar, dropping to his knees, ignoring the blood on the floor as it soaked his jeans. He took Cas's shoulder and shook it, lightly at first, but then rougher.
"Now, man;" Dean finished. "Side effect of being human, you need to shower. You've been in bed for days, you're a little ripe."
After everything they had been through, it seemed that these motels were the only constant in their lives. They had lost so many friends; Bobby, Cas... the Impala. The motel rooms now took the place of the car, the familiar rooms comforting, in a stagnant way.
. Just one step and he was in Cas’s personal space, taking his chin in his hand and pulling him forward, pushing him back into the shadows, against the wall, behind the dumpster. He felt Cas inhale before their lips were against each other, and after a fraction of a second those lips moved against his, kissing him back, and hands fisted in his jacket, pulling their bodies flush against each other, and then a hand on his back, in his hair, skimming down his side… under Dean’s hands was skin, warm and pliable, and if kissing comatose Cas was a heartbreak then this was a revelation - his chest felt hot, tight, like he couldn’t get enough air in, couldn’t take enough in, and oh god he was hard. He pulled their hips together and felt Cas in answer, hot and firm against his hip, and Cas pulled his mouth away to gasp at the contact.
Cas looked around, taken aback by the question. "Tired." He answered simply. Sam raised his eyebrows, looking at the time.
"Earn it, I guess."
He stood up, stooping over the bed, placing a hand on the angel's shoulder. He leant in, eyes still watching, pausing a few inches away.
"Stupid rich people." Dean grumbled, looking up, trying to gauge how he was going to do this. He leant his hand against the wall, and was startled when his hand didn't land on brick, but instead fell onto dry leaves and through to stalks. He turned to look at it, surprised, when he saw that the entire wall was covered in crawling ivy.
"He tried." Cas reminded her. "He took great pleasure in stopping that event."
Dean's memories were clicking in to place, slowly. "He's human. Or will be. I remember."
"I couldn't sleep." He answered simply.
“This isn’t why I called.”
"DEAN!"
Whenever Dean did this, the man's chin would tilt up, moved forwards by the sight pressure of Dean's touch. Each time he did it, he squashed down the hope, the instinct to believe that Castiel's eyes would open, would look up at him. He had to let it be enough that the pulse was still there, still gently ticking away, pumping blood through the stolen body.
It was at this time that Balthazar ran from heaven, faking his own death in battle. Commandeering a mansion in the heart of the English countryside, he lived with Penny and his daughter, teaching Livvie about her heritage, about the powers that she held.
Cas frowned, suspicion dawning. "What do you mean?".
Earlier.
"Of course." Was the reply. "I witnessed Archimedes discover water displacement in his bathtub."
"Missouri!" Sam cried as he wrapped his arms around the tiny woman, completely swamping her despite her girth.
“And I said no! You’re not ready!” Dean
Cas leant over slightly and put his hand in there, feeling around for a cassette tape, hands stumbling across everything else that lay in there. Most prominent was the bulky, familiar journal of John Winchester, still pulled out and thumbed through, though less frequently than it used to. Then there were sweet wrappers, papers, two guns, old phones and lighters, until finally his fingers closed around the familiar feel of the hard plastic. He drew it out, and Dean frowned.
Dean pondered it, had a brief run through in his head of the moves, of where they would train, the image of Cas topless, a slight sheen on his skin as Dean pinned him... He suppressed a groan, of frustration, of something else perhaps, and he pushed the heels of his palms against his eyelids until he saw lights twinkle behind the darkness. He snapped back to Sam. "So we train him, and we get out of here."
Dean looked up, but Cas wasn’t looking at him still. “I wanted you, Cas… I really did. I still… I want you. And I couldn’t let myself accept that for so many reasons, but I want to stop fucking around with this. I need to put this out there.”
“The angel who watched me and Sam, before you. Before hell.”
"What?!"
Cas looked to the hunter, surprised at the attention, but Dean quickly looked away again, looking back at the house.
As he clutched the blades of grass in his hand, he became aware of the soft noise of crunching, footsteps coming up behind him. He sighed, his chin hanging against his chest, slightly annoyed at the interruption just as he was beginning to feel soothed.
Dean watched him for a minute, the moonlight bouncing from the ripples on the water and catching his face. He looked ethereal, and he once again realised what Cas was. The guy may be human by all looks, but he wasn’t always. This was an angel that Dean pulled down to earth and kept. He gave this guy a death sentence, in a way that felt so much more monumental than if the demon blade had killed him when they first met in that barn. Cas would grow old and die, just like him, if they were lucky. Cas had given up so much for him, and he’d taken it for granted.
