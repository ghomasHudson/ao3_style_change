Still… Something was commanding about her tone. It had subconsciously caused Irene to lock her phone mid-furious-text. She could respect that. Molly was timid, kind, and ew,
John looked up into her eyes, lost as to what to offer. He had never gone steady with anyone longer than five or six months, and even then it had hardly qualified as a real relationship. He rested his hand on her knee, unsure of the physical touch.
Callum put his feet back to the floor, slowly getting up from his seat and strolling toward the aisle. “That never gets old, by the way.”
to have someone who was compatible with his best dancer. Sherlock didn’t trust her. He shut her file and dropped it in the chair next to him. Bill Wiggins took stage next.
Sherlock’s eyes widened a bit, as if being caught in the act of doing something most people disapproved of. “I did.”
John gasped, desperately trying to suck in air. Sherlock released John’s hand and lifted both of John’s arms up and back, wrapping them around Sherlock’s neck. Sherlock clutched at John’s forearms, his wrists, fingers moving against John’s sweating palms. Sherlock’s bowed lips, full and wet and hot, were kissing at the bones of his hand, his knuckles, tongue teasing between each pair of fingers. As the song’s intensity barely started to wane, Sherlock traced his hands down John’s arms, slowly, down his chest, teasing the waistband of his jeans, dipping, with terrifying intention, into the curve of each of John’s hipbones. John pressed the base of his skull deeper into Sherlock’s chest, trying to regain his composure, his breathing, anything to break the focus of Sherlock’s hands and their current location.
“She is quite stunning, indeed, John.” Sherlock stretched his arm around John’s shoulders and leaned in to kiss him on the temple. John’s hand found Sherlock’s knee and gave it a firm squeeze.
And then Sherlock’s hand was at the nape of his neck, and his lips were on John’s and the captain was melting under the hot, damp touch of another, in Sherlock’s hallowed hall. He gasped against Sherlock’s mouth, breath leaving him in trembling exhales. The kiss stole every line of coherent thought in John’s skull. He could feel Sherlock in his skin, in his blood, in his bones. Had he ever wanted to be closer to a human in all his life?
SO! I'm super excited about this chapter. To warn, fire sparks in these 5,000 words. and Top!John makes the world go round. Read at your own risk. ;)
“Honestly, John. Regardless of the awful circumstances that brought you here, and I am so sorry for that, by the way, I would think you would be a bit more excited about spending holiday at home, rather than singing Silent Night from your cot.” John noticed the shift in Sherlock’s voice. He was hurt. John understood. He had wanted nothing more than to be with this man, to see him at least once more. He knew there were things left to be said between them. Why was he acting like such a prick?
John led them. There was no music, but he did not need it. He could feel it. It was the brush of air against the small hairs on his arm. It was the sweet breath leaving Sherlock’s chest. It was the humming of the fluorescent lights.
“She doesn’t deserve this, John. She should be fucking happy. She’s fucking seventeen years old. Seventeen.” She huffed a broken exhale into the space between them.
“You’re courting Sherlock Holmes! John Watson, blonde spitfire, lady charmer, devil in the sack. And you’ve spent nearly three days with this man, and have done nothing but snog your heart out. I don’t know what to say.”
Callum weaseled in at the weakness. “Okay, let’s make a wager. London Broncos are playing against the Bulls this Saturday. If the Broncos win, you’re off. If Bradford wins, you have to come with us.”*
John straightened up and took a few deep breaths. He smiled. “You’re right, Sherlock. I’m ready for an afternoon cuppa. Does that sound alright?”
she could be from Callum’s recollections of him and Molly in their early years, she would never let on to her darker side in public. She shook her head. “He never makes me do anything I’m not comfortable with. He knows me quite well, actually.”
He unlaced his boots and kicked them off, a shower of sand falling with them. His socks were stained around the ankles from daily sweat and accumulation of the landscape. He found his iPod (his only guilty technological pleasure) and snaked the ear buds in as the rest of his regiment filed in from mess hall. He tapped the screen and succumbed:
“The day you disappeared, Mycroft informed me. It was locating you that proved to be nearly impossible. Fortunately, the city of Kandahar has a series of security cameras, and one was inside your compound. We were able to hack them and watch them move through the city. I wish I had discovered the cameras sooner. Seeing you would have made all the time you were away from me so much more bearable.”
"John!" She waved her hand high above the crowd of people. He turned at the sound of her voice and smiled.
He identified the first letter by the photograph. He chuckled, and though it stung like pure misery, he was so glad to feel it. He felt crow’s feet tickle his eyes and the pits of his cheeks ached from a full faced grin. Sherlock had actually sent him a photograph of the skull. AND, he had named it Billy.
The precious lady stuck out her hand and shook John’s. “Sherlock has told me so much about you, Captain Watson! It’s so nice to finally meet you.”
Jane huffed a small, sarcastic chuckle, nodding her head as if agreeing with the silence. John walked up to her and tilted her chin up.
“JAWNNNN.” Watson glanced up to see Sherlock stumbling over to the bar, grinning stupidly. John sniggered at his own cleverness. He had dumped two extra shots into Sherlock’s drink, and had every intention of doing it again before the night was over. He knew it was likely he’d never witness his best friend this intoxicated again, and was not even a bit remorseful he was taking full advantage of the situation.
“Now that isn’t entirely true, John. Don’t be so dramatic.” John glanced up and saw Sherlock with a steaming cuppa. The tears leaked out of the corners of his eyes. Sherlock gave him a small smile and extended the hot beverage. “This’ll help. Doctor’s orders.”
“I’m sorry,” Sherlock offered. He wrapped his arm tighter around John and nestled his head in the crook of John’s shoulder.
The rest of the rehearsal was done flawlessly. If such a thing had existed to Sherlock Holmes prior to John Watson, it was news to the brunette moving seamlessly, intentionally, perfectly across the stage.
He watched as his teammates helped themselves to his glasses, dispersed ice and beer and spoons to stir up the Baileys or the Makers. Calm found him in the midst of their chaos. He pictured Sherlock in the middle of them, fixing a hot toddy or pouring out fifteen year scotch like the classy bastard he was. He would be quiet and polite, a comforting presence. John imagined the handsome brunette tossing him a sideways smirk at Rhys starting with three shots and Egan shaking his head as he nursed two beers all night. John grinned down at the floor, knowing Sherlock would appreciate these men. Not because of their fantastic physical skill, their ability to bust their arses when required, the undefeated title they now carried, but because of who they were to him; to John Watson.
, Sherlock had believed it reckless and foolish to seek out a companion. He had never wished to share a bed, share a kettle, share a shower, cook with someone, fold towels with someone, kiss someone, be intimate with someone. He had never imagined being domestic, being tamed, having a routine… John did a small spin to untangle the cord and Sherlock smiled to himself. Nor did he ever believe someone else could put him at ease rather than on edge. Sherlock turned back to the raw chicken on the counter and began to stuff in the rest of the ingredients.
Sherlock cleared his throat and stepped forward. “John, you’ve met Chachi. This is Sky,” he gestured to the frizzy haired brunette, eyes dark with makeup, a bar through her right eyebrow. She grinned, and shook John’s hand. “And this is Ginger.” Ginger was the tallest of the three, nearly two inches taller than John, and her dreads were pulled back in a bundle at the nape of her neck. They were cherry red at the tips, beads laced through some of them. Her eyes were bright and blue, her freckles even more apparent up close. John had a hard time reading her; her smile was small and tentative, but far from shy. If anything, she seemed distant and hard.
He spun her, her curls billowing in her wake, and then, before John’s eyes, Callum began to dance. Not a hug and wobble, not an awkward two step or a waltz. He and Molly were coordinated. They had choreographed a dance.
Sherlock turned, placing his gorgeous arse in John’s face. “Fuck, Sherlock. You fucking perfect, gorgeous, tight-” John felt Sherlock’s hand on the back of his skull, fisting his hair and bringing his face forward with authority that surprised him. He hardly argued as he buried his face against the silk, biting at the musculature of his ass, appreciating the warmth of the skin underneath the cool of the fabric. John’s hands broke free, sliding up Sherlock’s thighs and cupping the underside of each cheek, gripping until Sherlock whined and pushed back hard against the mouth and chin responsible for dampening his garments. John lifted his left palm up, squeezing whatever bit of backside he could get, and then gave Sherlock a short, sharp spank.
John Watson had turned his chin, had darkened his eyes, pulled out that gorgeous, commanding, confident voice and Sherlock lost every logical thought in his head. It was like they dissolved and all the atoms of the previous ideas collected into one, throbbing
“I’m so sorry I’m late, darling.” He murmured against her skin. Molly’s stomach made a pleasant dip. “John’s… I don’t know.” She felt Callum pull away, his feet moving across the kitchen. Molly turned, wiping her hands on a dish towel, and read the worry in her fiancé’s face.
Harriet’s address was scribbled on the top left corner of the worn envelope. She never wrote. Perhaps she was concerned like Sherlock had been, though obviously not to the same degree. John shook his head to dismiss the thought; he knew better. Pathetic. His own sister cared less than his best friend did. John worked it open with his thumb, and reaching in, extracted a clipping from a newspaper. A tiny slip of paper was stapled to it.
Watson nervously laughed and idly thumbed the cotton gauze under the left shoulder of his shirt. “Ah, so it’s only gross because it’s me. Makes more sense.”
B’s parents had both died in a train accident when he was only nine, and no one could get in touch with B’s aunt or uncles to ask if they would take him in. He was in an orphanage for nearly five years before they suggested foster families. B, which is actually short for Bartholomew, was a quiet kid, or so he said, and he only stayed in two foster homes from the time he was thirteen until he was eighteen.
On the other hand, part of Sherlock was strangely aroused by how closely the doctor was watching him. Sherlock knew he could gather ten years of someone’s life in two minutes time. He also knew that was a rare gift, and one John Watson was unlikely to have. Darker images flicked into the back of Sherlock’s mind. He glanced up at the doctor’s face. His brows were furrowed, only slightly, as if intently studying the patterns of his skin. The thumb continued to move across both his forearms, ghosting places where the nerve endings were brand new. Sherlock remembered John’s comment from hours before. “I’ll be gentler.” Indeed, he was. He watched the jaw of the soldier clench and relax. Sherlock wondered if it was a habit whilst he thought, or a sign of refrain. He found himself wishing for the latter, though he wasn’t sure why.
John woke to a screaming alarm. He groaned and rolled over to hit snooze. John knew they were at the peak of their season, and that being perfectly fit was more important now than any other time of the year, but he really detested early morning workouts.
He placed a soft kiss on her cheek and turned to climb onto the bus. She waved as Callum took the window seat. He blew her a kiss, and then proceeded to punch Wesley, likely for a comment having to do with being too affectionate. She laughed, crawled back into her sedan, and headed back to the flat.
Sherlock closed his eyes again and drown in the warmth of the lights, the smell of earl grey, the sweat dripping down his legs and that deep, impenetrable blue of John's eyes.
“I wrote a bit of music for you. You are not obligated to dance, but I will only incorporate the piece if you wish to perform.”
Molly met her at the door and wrapped her up in a tight squeeze. “Hey, love,” she whispered in her ear. She tucked the lengthening blonde hair back from Jane’s face. Her friend met her with a small smile, and she stepped inside, a woven bag slung over her shoulder. Molly grinned.
I hope you enjoy! As always, please, leave me any thoughts or helpful criticism! Ideas are fun, too, as things are still in the process of being developed and planned!
Sherlock stared at him. John finished crunching on his last piece of bacon. “You’ve written two fifty thousand word stories?”
John woke with a start, a thin sheen of sweat on his forehead. He gazed around, confused at where he was. He was in a hospital, obviously, but it wasn’t his hospital on base. It looked so familiar… How did he…?
“Everett, you scared the piss out of me. You ought to know better by now.” John’s eyes were a little clearer today, his spirit finding its way back. Callum always feared foggy eyes. It had been nearly two years since he had last seen them, and had no intention of allowing their return.
The foyer was flooded with light, tiny prisms reflecting on the walls through an older crystal chandelier hanging from highly vaulted ceilings. A study was to the left, filled with dark cherry wood and lined with shelves of books, hundreds of them, maybe thousands. From leather bound anthologies to
“You’re gorgeous, John.” John felt like a fish out of water. Sherlock had complimented him before, and obviously felt a certain way about him or could at least be turned on by him. But for some reason, this was different. They were out of the madness of the warehouse, away from strangers and friends alike, and out of the context of hot dancing and indeed, feeling twenty-two again, the comment was tender. Geniune. Lovely.
There were hushed whispers and John tried his very best to ignore the conversation. Kirsten was wrapped up in Jane’s arms, clutching her for dear life, and her entire body was shaking. Jane was running her hands through her hair, chin resting on Kirsten’s head, and shushing her. A knot formed in John’s chest and he had a collision of thoughts: Jane was going to make a great mom, as he watched her speak softly and wipe the wet from under Kirsten’s eyes with the pads of her thumbs, and she was a strong woman, to endure watching the ones she loved so much hurt as Kirsten was right now. John caught Jane kissing Kirsten’s forehead before the girl left the room. Jane turned her to face John, tears now welling in her own eyes.
“What on earth for? I’m the one that tripped off the face of the planet in a drunken stupor and didn’t even warn you.”
It took every ounce of conscious effort to not suck in air at the sight of John, face damp and eyes swollen and red. He gave his best effort to provide a smirk, and barely managed.
Sherlock ran a hand through his sweat lined curls. What he would give for a proper shower. The hygiene here in Kandahar was shameful; how the soldiers endured it, he had no idea. Although, they were a different class of human altogether – submissive to the orders of those above them. They would never care about having six minutes of lukewarm water and a mutual bar of soap. But Sherlock’s skin broke out in gooseflesh at the thought. As soon as he returned to London, he would take a hot shower for days. He missed Baker Street. Desperately. Never thought he would admit to that. Kandahar was miserable. Dusty, khaki-colored misery.
John’s face lit up. “Do you know what a compliment that is? To have evaded the great mind of Sherlock Holmes for one evening?”
“What… what is this? What is happening here, exactly?” He felt Sherlock pull closer to his side, squeeze a little tighter around his chest, and it was then he noticed irregularities in the breathing beside him. Sherlock was just as mucked up as he was. For some reason, this struck a chord with John. It reverberated, causing a rather bold feeling to surface. “I’m not saying I don’t like it. That would be the worst lie I’ve ever told…”
Jane raised a curious eyebrow and John felt elation bubble up in his chest. This was going to be a good night.
Sherlock loved being home. His proper home. He enjoyed the city, but the older he got, the harder he found it to think through the London fog. He thought it aged him, his need for quiet and real darkness at night. He stretched and wriggled his toes, breathing in the earthy scent of dirt and water. The river was high; the rain had been heavy the past week and Sherlock’s usual perch had been swallowed up by white, frothy stream.
John chewed at the inside of his lip in contemplation before shaking his head. “No, I don’t think I’ve anything on. Why?”
“Don’t want me to go just yet?” John teased lightly. Had he just flirted with another man? Sherlock’s eyes widened a bit and John felt his wrist go free.
“I know, love. I’m just reminding you. New experience warrants a new set of expectations. Or rather, maybe no expectations?”
Sherlock’s back arched, pushing his body further into John’s. John yanked off his jacket and tossed it to the floor, along with his keys. Sherlock let out a shaky breath and began again:
” can prove. Sherlock had, in John’s mind, paired them as a team, even though Sherlock already knew everything.
They stood in silence for a few moments. It wasn’t uncomfortable, at least not for John. He admitted he enjoyed the presence of this multi-talented, oddly attractive chemist, and furthermore, enjoyed knowing Sherlock was just as curious about him.
Sherlock sipped his rum and coke, his free hand sifting through John’s hair. “It’s gotten so long. Will they make you cut it when you return?”
“Most of my programming has been done for non-profit purposes. I’m not really looking to make money from my technological abilities.”
John sat facing Sherlock, nestled comfortably into the worn, leather sofa of the den. He watched Sherlock’s face as his boyfriend told the story of how he came to inherit the estate rather than his Parliamentary brother, Mycroft. What kind of name was Mycroft, anyhow? Then again… he supposed the name Sherlock wasn’t any less odd.
Watson lifted a salute to his forehead as Major Scholto approached. He was tired, his uniform was soaked in sweat and his mouth felt like it had been stuffed with cotton rounds.
“Believe it or not, I am guilty of indulging in finer things, even if only on occasion. Shall we?” He slid into the front seat, the bay door opening wide and allowing the sun to pour in, turning the leather interior a matte black. John, nervous to even touch the door handle, carefully followed Sherlock’s example. The car cranked and hummed, her sounds a nearly silent whir of pistons. A stupid grin captured John’s mouth, and Sherlock winked before pulling out into the street.
“Whomever else, yes, of course I would get bored. But you are not whomever else. Let’s get you in bed, John. I know you must be exhausted.”
“I wouldn’t recommend the orange soda. I speak from experience. I typically just do it on the rocks, but this blend goes well with ginger ale.”
When he fell back into consciousness, he was on his knees, hot metal pushing into his back. He screamed out, and a weight came hard and fast at the back of his neck: the side of his face, protected only by a layer of black fabric, crashed to the ground. The pressure on his neck grew stronger, and he realized he was under someone’s boot.
“I recommend you don’t drink more than 443mL per bar, or every hour, whichever comes first. I’ve calculated your body weight and estimated your alcohol processing.”
"We were headed home from a concert," John said slowly, unsure of even the ground below his feet. He had spoken of this to no one, and the words felt heavy and tart in his mouth. "I bought us tickets to see Death Cab. They were for her birthday." He throat clenched; he breathed through his nose, determined to do this. "She had just turned twenty-four."
John peered up into Sherlock’s eyes. They were blinking back tears, but glinting nonetheless. John’s breath caught in his throat as he realized how selfish he was being. “Well, yes,” he responded slowly, “if you’d like me for Christmas, I would love to be here.”
John’s eyes were swimming, and then they were drowning, tears rolling down his cheeks as he lay in Sherlock’s bed, cocooned in grey cotton.
John had three seconds of the beautiful smile taking over Sherlock’s mouth before Irene stumbled into him.
John grabbed Sherlock’s gorgeous jaw and forced eye contact. His eyes were blown wide with lust, his pupils consuming the silvery blue that was there mere minutes ago. John gently pulled Sherlock back to his feet and gave his cupid’s bow a small kiss before pulling his pants to his knees. He took Sherlock’s hand in his own and ran his tongue down the center. He licked his own hand and wrapped it around Sherlock’s flushed, velvet skinned prick. It was perfect, and gave a deep twitch at John’s contact. Sherlock melted into the wall, head tilted back, curls falling across his eyes. Watson nipped at the exposed skin of his pale neck. He was so tempted to leave a love bite, just there. Under the jaw, close the ear. Sherlock’s hips arched forward, demanding more from John. John spat in his hand and pressed his miserably hard cock into the delicious v of Sherlock’s hip. He wrapped his hands around both of them, gasping, and began to rut against his own hand and Sherlock’s hip.
John laughed. It was a short, bitter, hateful sound. He handed the clipping to his commanding officer. “Better than ever.”
“Stamford! How are you, mate?” John jogged up and slung his arm around Mike’s shoulder, giving him a squeeze.
She nodded in a contemplative way, as if she were considering whether or not his response was acceptable.
John rolled out of bed and hastily put on his clothes. “You’re an idiot.” He plucked the spare key from the table and walked out into the kitchen.
John lazily opened his eyes and glanced up on the stage, now seeing Sherlock with his violin and bow by his sides. He looked… defeated, or disappointed somehow.
“I can’t believe I have you on Christmas Eve.” Sherlock kissed John’s hair and rubbed his cheek against him.
pinpoint. He sighed as he pulled out his own headphones, turning his iPod up to half volume, and put on an Incubus album. Within minutes, he was dozing.
She swallowed the food and smiled. “Oh my god! That would be so amazing! Yes, let’s go!” She took a sip of her drink. “This sandwich is superb, by the way. You made it just the way I like it.”
. John would be able to touch him all over, rinse the suds out of his hair, scrub him thoroughly before sucking him off in the porcelain tub.
“I love you, John Hamish Watson. I am honored.” Sherlock kissed him then. Every patch of skin the detective came into contact with went up in flame. "Obviously... obviously it's yes." he whispered. You could hear the love in the detective's voice as the words kissed their way from John's mouth to his ears.
“He did? What did he say? John didn’t even tell me that!” John’s ears perked up as Callum yanked his head to glare at John. “Why didn’t you tell me you saw Sherlock the other night?!” John felt a weird pain travel through his legs, stomach twisting in unison.
He nodded lazily and sat up a bit straighter. Sherlock extended his hand and pulled John to his feet, where he swayed a bit until finding a shaky center. He laced an arm around John’s thick waist and helped him to the bathroom.
Sherlock Holmes. An elegant name for an egotistical sod. John decided he liked him. What an interesting face he had: eyes like ice, cold and almost cadet blue in color. His cheekbones were insane, resting high and incredibly defined on his narrow face. And he had the most pronounced Cupid’s bow John had ever seen. Full lips, slightly pursed. John could feel those icy eyes going through a similar process. He grinned.
Sherlock watched as John chewed on his lip in uncertainty. He leaned forward and pressed his lips to the new moon that sat atop the curve of his tricep.
Sherlock extended a tentative hand, cautiously eying the doctor for signals to stop. John only gave him a wicked smile. Holmes’ long, lithe fingers started at John’s sternum and ran downwards, over his sweat dampened tee shirt, the buttons of his uniform, and resting on the waistband of his bottoms. Watson raked a hand through Sherlock’s untamed curls and gave a sharp tug. The detective’s back arched at the feeling.
The blonde captain felt his eyebrows travel higher on his forehead. He always expected B to ask the right questions, but this was very straight-to-the-fucking-point, even for B. He scrubbed his face with his free hand, the scratch of stubble lingering against his palm. “I’m not sure I’m the one to answer that, B. She’s been alone five months.”
John rose from the couch and raised one of those eyebrows, nearly in a challenge. “Callum, you remember Sherlock?”
“Sherlock, you’re bloody gorgeous. You know that?” John roved over the sculpted body once more. “Every blasted centimeter of you is a masterpiece.You perfect thing.” With that, Sherlock exhaled a murmur of gratitude, his palms pressing harder against the cloth keeping him contained.
“You do realize you’re coming home with me?” John spoke in a lethal whisper. Sherlock’s eyes fluttered open and a smug grin possessed that perfect mouth. John chuckled in a menacing way and fell to his knees, knowing Sherlock was close. He enveloped the hot heat of Sherlock’s cock into his mouth. Sherlock watched through heavily lidded eyes as John’s cheeks hollowed. There was a magnificent, guttural sound that escaped his lungs and John’s prick twitched between his legs. Six, seven, eight. Sherlock was shuddering under John’s touch, knuckles white from clenched fists. John ran his hand teasingly down Sherlock’s chest, clawing at the ripples in his abdomen. His cock found the back of John’s throat and he moaned. Sherlock fell to pieces. “Jesus. Fuck.
“You must be Jane?” John gave her a substantial once-over. John smiled to himself at the fact that they coordinated in several ways: blue eyes, blonde hair, both about 5’7”, and both wearing white cable knit sweaters.
“May I see you again?” He’d figure out the logistics later. He didn’t care. All he knew was that this, whatever this was, whatever Sherlock was, this was something brand new, an adventure, a sensation and feeling that he had never felt coursing through him. It wasn’t a conquest; it wasn’t something to divulge in merely because it was at present, an opportunity. It was a gift. This man in his foyer was something incredible and John wanted to know him. Every bone, every freckle, every tiny scar, every crescendo he wrote, every grain of rice that left every takeaway box, every laugh and every tear, and every single thing Sherlock felt was important enough to say, God, John wanted to
Please don't hate me for leaving this where I did! If I continued, it'd surely be a 12,000 word chapter, and I want to be consistent with length! Fear not, I will pick up EXACTLY where I left off...
Sherlock watched as John stood at the bar, foot tapping in rhythm with the music, as he waited for his whiskey shot.
“John Watson, meet Sherlock Holmes.” Molly’s voice was reserved, filled with a beautiful softness and admiration. “He also dances.”
Thank you for following this little story o'mine the whole way through. This was my second experience writing fanfiction, and my steady readers carried my momentum. I could not have done it without you.
John toweled off and slipped into his pants. He heard a throat clearing just as he stretched his t-shirt over his head. He glanced to the source of the noise, already knowing the owner it belonged to.
“As I was saying, he told me he had assigned a team to keep an eye on you while you were abroad. I told him I didn’t care, which of course was a lie…”
Sherlock’s eyes widened a bit, a genuine look of shock overtaking his intriguing features. “Honestly John, don’t be a fool.” His eyes dropped to his tea, and he took another long sip.
Holmes turned on his heels to face his friend. He was beautiful on a stage; his height and dark features were a lovely contrast to the openness of the auditorium that surrounded him. His chin rested in the navy holster that joined with his violin. There was something so calming, so submissive about this stance for Sherlock. The expanse of his neck was left vulnerable and unprotected. It was so different from his normal body language. His eyebrows were bowed in curiosity.
“No. But I will tell you it isn’t too far a drive. Are you comfortable?” Sherlock snuck a sideways smirk over to John, his expression smug. John rolled his eyes.
“I had the kettle on, and it began to boil when you arrived. Sorry I didn’t stand and coddle you at the door.” Sherlock’s long arms stretched tall to grab two mugs out of the highest cabinet. “I assumed you’d want tea. You normally drink a great deal of it when you’re nervous. Alcohol was the alternative, but you and I both know I don’t keep a stock of that here.”
“Is it the same reason you deny yourself so much? Is that what you think will happen every time you do something you enjoy?”
John froze where he stood, eyes on the table. Jane went to grab the lighter from his hand and noticed his stillness.
She stepped away and took a sip of her wine, a shoulder facing him. A defense mechanism. B returned to the stove and checked the chicken, taste tested the green beans. He slid a loaf of French bread from its brown paper sleeve and took a serrated knife to it. Her voice barely rose above the crunching of the crust being sliced.
John looked up from his plate, a bit taken aback. Firstly, why would Sherlock want to borrow any of his books? Surely he’d read every one in existence by now. Secondly, that would mean the book would be returned, which also meant that Sherlock intended to see him again
“We’ll just see about that.” She licked the shell of John’s ear and laughed as he picked her up by the thighs and carried her into his sitting room.
“What’s Her Face is an idiot.” She pressed her mouth against his and savored the aroma of wine tart on his breath.
“Oy, you! If you’re gonna insist on being sick, drag your sorry ass to the toilets! I just scrubbed this floor last night.” John followed her eyes to the poor sod sitting across the bar, head lolling around on his neck as though it were only attached by a ball and socket joint. He chuckled, breathing in the familiar smell of stale beer and cigarettes, and Collective Soul coming through the speakers. A calm settled into his bones and for the first time in nearly a month, he felt as though he had finally pulled his spirit back inside his body whilst simultaneously telling his mind to
John stood next to Sherlock in the kitchen, surveying the amazing moments in life they had managed to pick up and keep with them. Sherlock glanced down at him, his eyes warm and mellow. They delivered dinner to the table and pulled out the chairs for their guests.
“Yes.” He did not apologize for taking his time or for his comments. Why would he? John Watson would not let words escape his lips if he had not intended them to. He pulled a fresh cotton swab out and soaked it, dragging it lightly across the stitched up skin. The breathing, as the doctor called it, seemed to have helped. The thread almost laid flush against the rest of his arm. Sherlock thought briefly of John Watson unraveling him, literally and figuratively. He felt vulnerable; it was a most foreign concept.
Sherlock smirked and removed the dark cherry violin from the crook between his chin and shoulder. “Yes. Most weeks. Five out of the seven we have known each other,” he offered casually.
John heard him storming the steps before he breached the flat. Watson tried his best to purse his lips and hold in the laughter traveling up his windpipe. He hid his face behind the paper when the door swung open, smacking against the rubber safety on the wall.
John shoved his sheets to the end of the bed with a petulant kick of his legs, stretched, and made his way to his dresser. He dug around until he found a pair of cotton pyjama bottoms, slid them up over his hips, and ventured out into the kitchen. He rounded the corner to find Sherlock standing by the stove, wrapped up in one of his flannel robes. John leaned against the wall and watched him.
The cabbie stopped off near some docks along the Thames. John turned, expression curious, as Sherlock tossed the cabbie his notes and crawled out of the car. John followed, only after appreciating the generous view of Sherlock’s arse as he got out.
The room burst into applause, laughter, and whistles. John grinned at Jane. All the boys gave him a thumbs up. He found Sherlock towards the back of the crowd. If John wasn’t mistaken, he could swear the man appeared flustered. Jane’s plan entirely. He winked at the wonderful girl as she got up from his lap, grabbed his hand, and offered a deep curtsy.
“I really wish you’d get that fidget under control. It’s so unattractive.” Irene smirked, lips blood-red and dressed to the nine’s in black, back exposed, and her hair half down. Sherlock narrowed his eyes, aware of everyone else's in the restaurant. She couldn’t go
John stepped out of the hospital room and began to pace the hall. Sherlock had vanished, his sister had well past a lethal dose of heroin coursing through her body, and it was 5:15 in the morning. “This is fucking absurd,” John muttered. “Why am I always the one? Always fucking taking care of someone else. No one ever fucking takes care of me.” Tears stung his eyes. He hastily ran a hand through his damp hair, shoving his other hand deeper inside his pocket.
John stood behind closed doors, feeling as though he may just black out and hit the floor. His future husband stood on the opposite side of those heavy, oak panels, waiting for him.
“Yes, well, you text me like, seven different options a day, and I’m sorry if I can’t remember which you settled on!” Molly’s best friend took another sip from her quickly depleting Makers and Coke. She had a three ring binder open, dividers labeled for different aspects of the wedding. They were currently on
and turned his body to a sit position. He ducked his head between his knees as it throbbed mercilessly. The soft flannel of his pants felt good against his ears.
“And until recently, that arrangement had worked quite nicely. Lately I find myself wishing I wasn’t such a bachelor.” John laughed to himself and Jane smiled, a sad but oddly sympathetic expression on her face.
When we are young, we are taught there is an order to so many things in life, the timing of your passing being one of them. We are taught that we are the last to go: first grandparents, then parents and finally us, as we leave our children or spouses on earth and trail away into whatever happens next. When order is disrupted, chaos occurs. Jane set her eyes on the back of Sam’s mother, her posture tall and strong, and felt something spiral loose inside her. How would it feel, to bury your beautiful child? To know he was snatched from you before you were ready to let go, and worse still, before he was able to even live? She saw Sam in the cafeteria, socking a bastard in the face for pushing a physically disabled boy’s wheelchair into the neighboring table. She saw him tying his girlfriend’s trainers after her lacrosse incident, carrying her pack and purse around school to make her crutches easier to use. Sam in the ceramics room, mopping the floors after wheel day even though he hated clay and was truly quite trash at all of it. Sam outside his maths teacher’s door, body trembling in anger as the instructor stuck a finger in his face and commented on his laziness and his parents’ lack of involvement. Sam in the principal’s office, always leaving on good terms, always respectful of those who earned his respect, always putting others’ needs before his own.
date for that matter. Was this a date? He sighed, exasperated. Yanking out his mobile, he thumbed out a text.
“Certainly, Ms. Jesep. That would be lovely.” She watched as her administrator took a seat at the end of one of her student tables, his height looming even in a sitting position. She walked back into the supply room and found another clean mug. Jane stood over the Kuerig, idly picking at the hem of her shirt. She heard a small rustling of feet near her. Startled, she gave a small yelp and turned to see Dr. Phillips, waiting hesitantly by the door. His eyes were wide and kind, concern evident on his slightly aged face. He was a handsome man, so gentle in demeanor. “Alright there, Jane?” he asked in a quiet question.
“Tell me how you found me?” John had been dying, quite literally, to know how his knight had come to his rescue. It was an impossible feat, to find a dying man in the middle of the desert, with no tracking device, no leads…

Sherlock had never read such urgency in someone’s face. It was enough to yank the oxygen from his lungs.
“I run with you because I love this life, Sherlock. If I wanted safe, I never would have started this. You are what I want,
As the first wave of ecstasy wracked through John’s body, Sherlock nearly sobbed as his own followed suit. He was enveloped by the sounds spilling from John’s mouth, beautiful murmurs and broken whispers, and pure, unaltered white. Their lips grazed, exchanging an electric pulse that could short-circuit the entirety of London. John stroked the side of Sherlock’s face as they found their way back to a moderate equilibrium. Sherlock was trying to keep his composure; tears were threatening to pour with heartless abandon. He had a strong feeling that John could see straight through him. Sherlock pulled them onto their sides and John gave him a dazzling kiss; it was solid, firm, his tongue soft against the roof of his mouth.
B sunk a little farther back in the chair as his legs began to twitch a nervous beat. He wore a quiet expression and John knew he was searching to find a good way to ask something. “Cap, is she ready for a relationship?”
John pinched the bridge of his nose and gave a long, breathy exhale. “Sherlock, I proposed, I asked you. That’s how this works!”
Sherlock felt himself being pulled backwards into the small space between the two larger buildings, and a twist of excitement jolted his bones. John pinned him against the cold brick, hands already in Sherlock’s hair, before he crushed a nearly rabid kiss on Sherlock’s mouth. Sherlock gripped John at his ribs and yanked him closer. John’s fingers were combing through Sherlock’s curls in a far gentler manner. Sherlock yipped in surprise as John bit his bottom lip.
“Nice to have people on our team.” Sherlock turned to face John on the couch. John shot him a curious look before Sherlock moved closer, earl grey tinted breath gusting warmly across John’s nose and cheeks.
Sherlock snickered warmly, and pressed a warm, soft kiss to John’s mouth. He crawled off him and strolled over to the telly. John rolled onto his side, propping his head in the palm of his hand, and grinned as Sherlock bent halfway over, looking through rows of DVDs on a shelf in the sitting room.
John licked his lips and then chuckled, Callum now giving Molly his vows. Something stirred deep in Sherlock’s ribcage.
“Tito, Graham, Izzi, it’s been good.” John couldn’t help but laugh at Sherlock’s use of slang. Sherlock tugged John by a belt loop towards the door. As they waved their goodbyes to Duke and Troy, John saw a car waiting by the docks.
“Yes, that’d be nice. Thank you.” John shivered. He felt like that voice filled every empty space, even the tiny clouds inside electrons as they floated about within atoms.
“Callum!” She was hollering through the exotic suite now, listening as the breeze billowed in the open doors to the patio.
John looked around at his team, resting against the lockers and sprawled around the benches and floor. He had all eyes; the match was going to begin in a matter of minutes. He beamed.
Jim stopped, resting his hands on his hips, menacing grin taking his lips. Sherlock shivered. “Thank you for coming. You’ll be hearing from me within the week.”
“Molly.” John turned to Molly, her eyes damp and a pitiful smile pushing through the tears. “Oh, Molly. I am so fortunate to defy the odds and know you. Most best men have to spend weeks concocting a kind thing to say about the woman they hardly know before they stand up here and deliver a speech.” He smiled at her. “You are an amazing woman. You are an individual of unearthly character; a perfect example to all of humanity of what a kind soul and magnificent spirit encompass. You have brought so much light into Callum’s life, and as a result, into mine. You, too, have saved me, Molly, and remind me every single day that finding someone with a heart like yours is not impossible. To know that you exist brings hope to every man waiting to find a companion.”
“Sherlock?” John padded out of the bedroom, looking for his lanky counterpart. He peered into the kitchen, wondering if he had started some tea. Nope. He opened to the door to 221b to listen for his voice downstairs, mingling with Mrs. Hudson's. Nope. He walked down the hall and stopped again by the bathroom door. The shower water was running. Oh.
The steam rising from the hot cup of earl grey was wonderful. It was nice to have something other than a similar accent remind him of home. Sherlock set the mug down on the outside table. It was half past six in the morning, and the desert sand was already reflecting the rising sun. The heat was bearable at this hour, a dry, warm heat rather than a stifling, oppressive one. He straightened his tie, rolled up the sleeves of his dress shirt. Then he wrapped one hand around the warm cup and took a slow sip. He relished the familiar, earthy flavor as it filled up his insides. He closed his eyes and tried to think of London. It felt like it had been ages since he’d slept in his own bed, wrapped up in gray, high thread count cotton sheets.
Sexy boys inspired by a very sexy song. Latch, by Disclosure & Sam Smith. Enjoy your evening dose of naughty John!lock. ;)
“It’s going to be okay, Aaina. I’m going to fix you right up.” John’s voice cracked at the end, as he absorbed the irony of the situation. Aaina meant mirror. He opened his medical kit and got to work.
“Sherlock? Bloody – I’m far more drunk than I thought.” Sherlock chuckled at that, and stood from the sofa. He had been reading the paper. “What time is it?” John asked quietly.
And then the song was over. John didn’t want to leave the curve of the inside of Sherlock’s hips, didn’t want to release the curls tightly wound in his short, callused fingers, didn’t want to watch that mouth walk out the door. The next bass-filled top hit came on, and John turned, giving Sherlock a strong push towards the toilets. The brunette smirked and John gave a devilish grin. John pushed him through the bathroom door and against the wall. Watson yanked at the man’s belt, and pressed into him, biting at his neck. He kissed Sherlock’s ear and breathed “John.” He watched with satisfaction as gooseflesh broke out across the taut skin of his arms. Someone pushed at the door, but didn’t linger long after understanding where this freight train was headed. Sherlock shoved John’s hands away and cornered him into a stall, slamming the flimsy door behind him. His hand was cradling the back of John’s head, and then his lips were burning fire into John’s. His tongue found entrance to John’s mouth and was tracing his lips, exploring the roof of his mouth… John gasped. Hands were under shirts and pulling at the buttons and zips of their trousers. John teased Sherlock through his pants, rubbing his hands across a magnificent erection. Watson felt his own pulse beneath the tension of his cotton pants. John watched in fascination as Sherlock fell to his knees and ran his tongue across John’s leaking hard on. “
“Thought you could use some proper tea. I can imagine it’s been a while since you’ve had some. I took a stab at how you like it, two sugars and a bit of milk, but if that doesn’t suffice, I’ll grab another the next time I’m down.”
The man stepped forward, extended the hand free of a gin and tonic, and his small smile broke into a grin. It immediately set John at ease, reminded him of Egan, and he grabbed the hand in a solid shake.
“Of course he didn’t, Cap. But the point is that he could have,” B piped up. Jane gave him a teasing swat on his backside and pushed him down the next step.
John bent down to pick up a bundle of envelopes, some faded and others bright white, looking as though they had just been sealed.
“I do believe you have become my exception, John Watson. I’ve been a poor host. Would you like to see the rest of the estate?” Sherlock slipped out from under John’s body and cast him a devious grin as he made his way toward the back end of the house. John smirked, left the bags where they sat on the hardwood floors, and followed.
John practically stopped breathing. Mycroft was a different realm of human all together. If Sherlock had admitted his love to his all-powerful big brother, John knew this was, in fact, something fierce.
“Oh, but there is, B. Because what happens if I like you? If I like you too much? If I scare you off, over-analyze, get too comfortable, disappoint you? What then? Who wants that?”
John kissed Sherlock’s calves as he filled the detective up. Seated, he pulled the ankles from his shoulder and Sherlock folded his legs at the knees, heels dug into the edge of the bed. John traced the insides of Sherlock’s thighs with his fingers, as he began to slowly rock into him.
John felt the warmth of Sherlock seeping in through his clothes, catching fire to his skin. He could smell him everywhere, earthy and clean. His pulse wouldn’t steady, he felt his lungs struggling to function properly. He began to feel a bit dizzy and a bit giddy, too.
“Have you been drinking?” B wasn’t being ugly, not exactly. Condescending may have been a more appropriate term.
The hair on the back of John’s neck rose, quick and fierce. The tone of her voice chilled him to the bone. “Of course, Harry, where are you?”
Sherlock’s voice had started to deepen from talking. It was gruff and throaty, echoing in John’s ears. There were no words to describe how much he had missed him.
He felt Sherlock chuckle underneath him. “Don’t apologize, John. I can be an impossible prick sometimes.”
the tiny furrow that had made a home between his brows at the mention of his father, and the slight haze in his eyes.
Surely the man knew John was smitten – with his dancing, with his voice, with his appearance, but mostly with that insufferably unpredictable way he is the opposite of
It couldn’t continue on that way. He had a fucking job, hopefully, had to heal and recover and keep his life from going tits up yet again. He didn’t have time to be seduced by a medical officer in the sands of Afghanistan. It didn’t support the Work, his plans, or his sexual habits, which prior to this, had been slim to none for a solid four years. Staying clean had been hard. Part of him wanted to blame the drugs and the withdrawals for his lack of self-discipline and control, but he knew that accusation would be three hundred and fifty percent false. No, John Watson could not become a permanent fixture, nor should he be a temporary one. Sherlock had made up his mind when the doctor walked in with a steaming cuppa.
John sat up in bed and crossed his legs. He maneuvered himself to be as close to Sherlock as he possibly could. He took a steadying breath and locked on to Sherlock’s eyes. They were more blue than grey tonight, crow’s feet kissed the corners of his eyelids and reminded him of the way water travels through a delta: steady, slow and in tiny streams. This was the man he could not live without; even when he was certain he was dead, Sherlock still found him in his afterlife. The eyes smiled, awaiting good news, glad at John’s presence.
Sherlock immediately responded with a growl. Moving his hand from John’s now wrecked hair, Sherlock rested one on each of John’s battered knees. Sherlock pressed his silk boxers against the cotton on John’s pants, giving a tortuous grind. John’s chin fell back toward the ceiling, his palm finding the back of Sherlock’s neck, tangling in the curls at his nape, then tracing the line of Sherlock’s spine down to the pelvic bone. Watching Sherlock’s hips twist in tight circles tried John’s patience. He knew he was meant to enjoy this, to enjoy being teased, and going by his aching cock, he most certainly was. But cor, he was ready to get on with it.
Sherlock rolled over to his side and assumed his normal sleeping position: one knee up, one leg extended, one arm tucked under his pillow and the other curled underneath him. John mirrored him, lacing one leg around Sherlock’s elongated one, returning a hand to Sherlock’s bony hip, and tucking his chin near Sherlock’s shoulder. Sherlock fell asleep savoring the warm huffs of John’s breath on his neck.
As the waiter made his way over, a loud swarm of people began to pass in front of the window. Sherlock turned instinctively, observing the group of men. All were freshly bathed, bodies still seeming flushed and rosier than the cold weather typically allowed. Three, nine, twelve… twenty-two. There were twenty-two of them. All were built differently, but athletic in appearance. He ran through the possibilities in his head.
Sherlock chuckled. His voice was echoing in John’s ear, melted gold: “Should we, um, get out of here?”
John chuckled. Sherlock jerked his head, glaring pointedly, all his curls shaking in response. “Amused?” Watson wrapped one hand around his ribs and bent over, laughter spilling out of his mouth in bellowing waves.
The green expanses of Ireland unfolded with the rising sun, and John was so glad he was awake to witness it. There were moments in his life he deemed truly exceptional, moments he knew would float in his memory until the day he passed. They were usually fleeting: a range of seconds accompanied by a rare period of serenity and peace that took hold of John’s heart. Normally the vision itself wasn’t the source of tranquility, but merely being and existing and that, for now, was enough. As the orange sun rose over the horizon, John took a chance to peer around at his sleeping brothers, to soak in the fact that they had brought themselves here. He closed his eyes, forcing the tears to hold fast behind his lids, as gratitude flooded him: he saw the look on his mother’s face the day he was finally able to visit her in rehab; the first time he survived a tough scrum and came out on top; the first oranges and reds of the trees as autumn trickled its way in; the soft feeling of sweatpants; the smell of fire and the burn of whiskey, followed with twenty-one shot glasses clunking down on the counter at the Duke and Duchess; the gentle caress of a hand carding through his hair; Callum and Molly the night of their engagement, eyes wide and watering and perfect; the day he signed with St Helens alongside his best mate; Harriet’s gorgeous smiling face and matching blue eyes in the passenger seat of his Jetta when he was twenty-two, laughing and the wind rippling through her hair. John gasped as the tears broke free, leaking down his cheeks. He blinked, and upon opening his eyes, recalled Sherlock’s pale eyes staring into his, unwavering, slightly petrified through that glass window, and wiped the wetness from his face. He smiled to himself, knowing that he had a beautiful life. It was fucked up, most of it unfair, but he was grateful all the same. Sometimes you have to live in a world of demons in order to discover angels; John walked among them, aware of his his fortune of having so many others hold him up until he grew wings of his own.
This night had unfolded famously. As Sherlock mulled over the events of the evening, he felt the now ever-present-John-Watson blush rise to his neck and cheeks. The man was fascinating. Sherlock knew that John was a man who enjoyed going out with his blokes, having a good time and occasionally making an outright fool of himself. He puzzled momentarily, both wary of and intrigued by John’s reserve. Sherlock felt a small knot in his stomach twist a bit tighter. He realized that perhaps John felt the need to show restraint in preservation of Sherlock’s reputation. While they had certainly done thorough studies of each others anatomy that night, those types of songs often elicited a strong physical response from most people, couples in particular. Oh.
Molly was a vision. If you asked her if she was a graceful individual, she would deny it. But Sherlock knew she possessed grace in so many ways, not just on her feet. She was particularly fantastic with social graces, something she had thankfully rubbed off on Sherlock. It wasn’t an area he was truly daft, but he lacked the finesse of warm kindness. Molly was the epitome of it.
The lights dimmed and the curtain moved back to reveal a stage colored in burgundy light. John peered into his binoculars and found the orchestra. He was curious what Mr. Holmes looked like. After a few moments, a black haired woman, thin and curved, raven hair pinned up and red paint on her lips, took the stand at the front of the orchestra. She wore a suit, but it was a sinful fit: double breasted buttons down to her slender waist, silver embroidery down the front, and two elegant coattails falling behind. She was stunning in a very traditional way.
-EVERY SINGLE ONE OF YOU SHOULD READ THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO. Holy shit, Lisbeth Salander is my spirit animal.
Major Scholto placed his hand on John’s left shoulder and squeezed, his typically cold eyes now warm with empathy. “I’ll get you home, son.”
John propped himself up on his elbows and listened carefully. He heard nothing, but saw a faint light shining under the door, continuously changing. The muted telly. John crawled out of bed and quietly opened the door. Sherlock had assumed his normal position on the couch, but he seemed to actually fit inside it now. The thought made John uneasy – Sherlock was not well and Watson felt like a prick for ever wishing it. He stood by his savior and watched the shadows of the television fall on his face. John gently knelt beside him (he hoped this decrepit body would recover soon) and laced his fingers through Sherlock’s. The man stirred and untucked his face from the crook of his arm. He blinked, as if making sure he was not dreaming, and smiled.
“I’m not sure I’ll ever get used to the way you speak. I must sound so unimpressive in comparison.” John trailed his lips across Sherlock’s cheek and jaw until he found the soft flesh near his ear. Sherlock huffed as John teased him lightly.
?” He stared at Molly incredulously. She would never create something so absurd, but would Sherlock?
John quirked his left eyebrow and a smile tugged at the right corner of his mouth. Sherlock’s eyes darkened instantly at John’s expression.
John’s eyes weren’t accusing. They didn’t judge or assume or blame. They just waited, filled with patience and curiosity and an odd, misplaced sadness.
. February was my last post? Seriously? There are no words for how sorry I am; all I will say is I am posting a new chapter so I will KEEP posting new chapters. I don't want to abandon this story, these boys, or you. I can't thank y'all enough for your sweet, kind, and motivating words during my several month hiatus.
Sherlock leaned forward and kissed John right above his eyebrow. “I’m sorry I did not ask your permission before entering your room." He wasn't sorry; John could tell.
John watched as the tears fell against the brittle paper. These were going to wreck him before he ever hit the aisle. Damn that perfect man with his swooning words and indefinite cleverness.
“I know, Mols, I’m sorry. That was uncalled for. I was only teasing. The show was stunning, as is Sherlock’s dancing.”
It was Sherlock’s reserved laughter, the sound his gloves made when he pulled them from his longest finger, the clank of the door knocker on 221b. It was the kiss of snow onto melted sidewalk, the shriek of the kettle, the unfolding of stationary. The rustle of sheets, the parting of lips, the drunken laughter of a Christmas Eve. The quiet of London at night, the crunching of leaves under loafers, the tinking of microscope slides.
“It wasn’t alright. It was more than alright. It was perfect. It was the best day of my life, and likely will be until the day I die. The venue was gorgeous, our best man and maid of honor were phenomenal and our parents cried and I cried and you cried and you… you were gorgeous, Callum, with your puffy eyes and brilliant smile. The way you looked at me when I set foot in that aisle…” Emotion froze the words in her throat; a lump expanded, sore and dull and wonderful. “You’re perfect.” She choked out, eyes brimming and wet. She tilted her chin up to meet Callum’s mouth, his lips warm and wet and gentle on hers. His hand found the line of her jaw, his fingertips woven into the hair at the nape of her neck. She whispered his name, soft and still against his pliant mouth, and a quiet moan left his throat. He pulled her up from the chair roughly, wrapping one arm around her waist, the other around her backside and she felt her knees go weak.
Sherlock returned the violin to its home and turned to face John. Watson could find no words for the expression on Sherlock’s face, but the closest he could compare it to was pure, perfect joy. Sherlock’s fingers laced through John’s, and the service began.
“Indeed, I am. Hot on Shezza, I mean. The rest is up for debate, absolutely.” Sherlock felt dizzy, then childish for the light-headedness. He felt John’s hand on the small of his back, a warm radiation of comfort.
John lay awake in bed. Sherlock’s head was resting in the crook of his shoulder, his arm slung over John’s bare chest. There was a tiny, sick seed growing in the pit of John’s stomach. But dread on Christmas was not allowed. He scooted out from under Sherlock and crept into the kitchen.
John woke to hot liquid pouring on his face. He closed his eyes tight and coughed, trying not to inhale. It stopped. John opened his eyes, only to hear the zipping of pants.
It was John’s turn to blush, and Sherlock documented the pink as it kissed his neck and the outer edges of his cheeks.
Then he let go. The doctor took three steps back, grinning. The loss was staggering. The detective could hardly stand on his own. “So don’t think you are in control. Because I can assure you, you’re not. You won’t be taking advantage of me unless I allow it.” Then Watson laughed and reached for the door, shamelessly eying Sherlock’s taut trousers and generous erection. “That was about three minutes, don’t you think? I’ll be back in two hours. Don’t look so turned on when I return. It’s actually rather hard for me to walk away from you like this.” The white, bland door clicked shut, and silence filled the room.
John woke to whispers. He opened his eyes to see looming shadows. One stretched a long, distorted limb back and before John could retaliate, he felt metal collide with his skull.
flat, hands in each others' hair, lips swollen and pink. Sherlock ran his thumb across John’s right brow, gentle and caressing. Watson’s breathing was ragged with excitement.
Jane cut across him and pulled a can of orange soda from the fridge. John leaned against the counter and laughed as she helped herself to a glass - how the hell did she know where he kept his glasses? – and ice from the door of the fridge. She eyed him menacingly as she snagged the whiskey from the bar and poured herself a shallow layer at the bottom of the ice, and barely covered it with the orange soda.
“John, I’m sorry I can’t tell you in person, or even over the phone. It was a fortune to get this tiny thing overnighted to you. The funeral is Sunday.” John’s heart sank into the pit of his stomach, dread wrapping its icy tentacles around every vessel in his body. He lifted the slip of paper:
John pulled away just enough to look Sherlock in the eye. He searched them a long time. He found no trace of fear or doubt, and very little pity. "Thank you."
He missed him. He did. Missed his tall, loopy handwriting; a code used to decipher something clever if you were bright and attentive enough to crack it. He missed his hands raking through his hair, the water droplets glistening on his back after the shower, the way the dust particles danced around him at his desk like tiny wisps.
Sherlock sighed dramatically and dog-earred the page of his book. He let it plop onto his lap. Internally, he wasn’t sure how to feel about the doctor’s attentiveness. On one hand, it fascinated him. It had been ages since he had come across someone who was even moderately observant. Apart from Mycroft, of course. He doesn’t count; he isn’t human. Sherlock chuckled at that thought, allowing his wrists to be examined. The younger Holmes hadn’t fallen much farther from the tree. While he had gained some of his father’s greater traits, the intellect, appearance, and air, he was far more experienced in the realm of humanity than Mycroft was. Of course, it was only because of curiosity that Sherlock knew as much as he did. The captain’s thumb ran gently across three new scars. They were bright pink and puckered, and he imagined them being silky to the touch. The contact caused gooseflesh to rise on his arms.
It wasn’t a question, and was entirely correct. “Accurate, yet again. Though I have been warned that is nothing unusual. My students this year are fantastic. I love every single one of them. It is the things they endure that I am struggling with.”
people. He knew how to control them, how to manipulate them, and how to charm them, if ever necessary.
John's mouth dropped in disbelief. "A Gryffindor? You know, the Gryffindor House, the home of the brave and courageous? Lions and heroes and Hogwarts, oh my?" Sherlock tilted his head and gave a small shake. "Huh. Okay, well. Finally something I can educate you on."
John hopped off the train, his eyes searching the flood of humans at the station. It took hardly any time at all to find him; that stupid coat was a dead giveaway. John grinned, hopped off the last stair of the car, and walked to him. His duffel was slung over his shoulder. He stood tall in his uniform. Sherlock’s mouth turned into a mocking smirk, and he clicked his heels and snapped a salute to his forehead. “Welcome home, Lieutenant Watson.” John punched him solidly in the left shoulder.
“Alright. You’re right. That was fucking horrible.” John was shaking with laughter as he reached for the plates. As he turned around, Jane pointed an enthusiastic finger at his chest.
He snagged a dressing robe from the back of John’s bedroom door and made his way into the sitting room of the flat. As he slipped into the nearly too short gown, tying it snugly about his waist, he stepped in front of one of many bookshelves lining John’s living space. There were a few framed photographs: One of John and Callum, much younger, likely age 15. Callum’s hair was long and he was grinning, looking down at John. John’s face was a bit rounder, but handsome all the same. There was another of Molly, her hair done up in two braids. She looked youthful, likely their uni years. Another one of John’s teammates, whoever the shaggy haired blonde was…
“Sherlock?” John waited, hoping Sherlock was lingering outside the door, listening for his response. “I love you, you insufferable git.”
He had imagined the look on John’s face if the doctor had walked in on Sherlock lazily stroking his cock, legs spread on the pale comforter, eyes dark and deviant. He considered locking the door once the captain entered, pinning John to a wall while he made love to that gorgeous, snarky, clever mouth. He’d even pictured himself falling to his knees, whimpering, begging, to take the doctor’s surely divine prick all the way to the back of his throat. Pining was a fucking understatement. It was unbearable. He ran his thumb across the zipper of his trousers, nerves vibrating at the sensation.
“If you need help with finals, I’m an excellent tutor in all scientific areas… obviously.” And with that, Sherlock handed John Watson a business card and headed across the lawn. He stood stock still in the middle of the concrete path, watching the trench coat billow as Sherlock moved. So that’s why he wore it, even in May. What a drama queen.
He glanced into Molly’s eyes, and the pieces clicked together. She squeezed his hand gently. “Don’t fret, Callum. He’ll sort through it. He’s got you.”
“Hullo, Sherlock! Glad you could make it out.” Mike grinned, and after finding his footing again, walked inside the pub.
“Boys. That was gorgeous. Rhys and Egan, those new plays were fail proof. Jasper, you were perfectly at home at three quarters. B, so glad you’re my fullback. Those tackles tonight were breathtaking. Literally, I stopped breathing on several occasions. A gift from God that I’m still standing, I believe.” The team laughed. “Wesley, way to step up and take a stab at right wing tonight.” John glanced at Callum, knowing his face was advertising his love for these boys like a neon lit sign. Callum grinned, gap and all, and laughed.
“Wait! Guess mine first.” John unwrapped his cookie and cracked it open. He held the tiny strip in his hand and glanced up eagerly at Sherlock. Sherlock sighed as though he were bored.
“Wha— What?! Thank you, so very much, for making it sound like such a chore! The great Sherlock Holmes, too proud to walk a few meters, so here John, you do it instead! You are a complete dickhead sometimes, are you fully aware of that?”
“I insist that you sleep in my room, John. It would be cruel to make you use an extra set of stairs every time you need to retrieve something from this part of the flat.”
to his four year old son. There was no band on the captain’s finger, and he would never take it off if he had one. Unmarried, likely unattached. Sexuality? To be determined. Fairly certain heterosexual.
John put the kettle on and prepared a cup of tea. He quietly climbed the stairs to his own room, which had been, for all intents and purposes, abandoned since the first night John slept next to Sherlock. He rummaged through the drawer of the side table and pulled out the letters he had written while in London, and then composed a new one:
John stood amongst a small crowd of people, chatting easily. Graham was a nice guy, and John found it amusing that Sherlock was not the only posh man to have such daring recreational activities. He took a sip of his stout and glanced around, soaking up the movement in the warehouse. There were about just as many women as men, and John had seen a few of them dance. They were good. Very good. The song changed and John felt someone at his right flank, chest pressing into his shoulder, a hand skimming the bicep of his left arm. He was gently being turned and John grinned up at Sherlock.
“All right. Is there anyone in particular I should be looking out for? Physical attributes, certain locations, specific habits?”
John’s fingers quietly caressed the line of Sherlock’s jaw, his brow, the outer rim of his ear. He tried to reign in the overwhelming amount of sentiment that flooded him. As he kissed Sherlock, lips smooth and soft and warm above his, he found himself discovering that Sherlock would quench any thirst, emotional, mental, or physical, that John could possibly need. He felt raw and exposed, like Sherlock had found a way to crawl into his body and merge their existence together: their bloodstreams rushing and expanding, their cerebral communications doubling, the gorgeous zapping and flickering of neurons, twice the stability in their bones, twice the strength. Calm snatched John in an unrelenting grasp, his focus present only to discern the smallest, most insignificant details of Sherlock’s body.
“Yeah, actually. She did. Said I should go to culinary school.” B slid the potatoes into the oven. “By the way, the teacher clothes aren’t bad.”
“Pleased to meet you, Graham. And cheers! Tell your father I said thank you. That’s one hell of a compliment.”
“Is this continent one of the three?” His voice felt small and feeble in his chest. Grogginess washed over him. He was basking in a post-orgasm haze.
“Oh.” Yeah, definitely a mind reader. “I thought it felt a bit… unused for you. Why haven’t you broken it in?” John pulled the disc from the case and set it into the player.
John woke to a soft thumb rubbing across the knuckles of his right hand. He watched as Sherlock’s massive hands swallowed his own. John turned to face the man he adored, squinting at the morning light.
Jane unlaced her Chucks and curled up on the couch, pulling out her newest skein of yarn and a crochet hook. She heard Band of Horses come on through the soundbar and turned to find Molly standing in the kitchen, remote in hand. They were one of her favorite groups, especially when she was a bit down and out. Molly knew this, of course, because they were one of her favorites, too. Jane mentally noted she was the absolute luckiest, even after a shit day.  “Love you, Mols.”
“Of course it is.” His voice was firm. She pulled away and looked back and up. His expression was curious and set.
“Rehearsal went all right, then?” John asked from the crook of Sherlock’s neck and shoulder. Sherlock gave him a gentle squeeze around the shoulders and kissed the top of John’s head.
“If this is the interview that will lead to your lifelong career, then no, John, there is no such thing as too formal.”
“Erm… shit. They’re oddly named. T… Tra genes and… the other one has a T in it, also. Shit. Oh! OriT! And... they allow the bacterium to form a mating pair with the other organism!”
“And what it is you’d like me to say?” Sherlock implored. The huskiness of his voice was proving to be a fatal distraction.
“If you don’t want to, of course you don’t have to, I just. Well. They got back from their honeymoon yesterday and invited us over for tea and a chat. Jane will be there. Thought it’d be nice.” John felt himself growing hot with embarrassment.
“Thanks for deciding to return my call.” She was angry. A tiny voice in the back of Jane’s mind reminded her that Sam’s death had nothing at all to do with B. She told the voice to fuck off.
He took the stairs slowly, hoping to not wake Sherlock. He had no idea what time it was, but gauged it was between three and four. He walked into the living room to find Sherlock sprawled out on the nearly-too-small sofa, telly on and muted. He was sound asleep, his chest moving with deep, heavy breaths. One hand had fallen over the side of the couch, index finger barely grazing the rug. One knee was bent, causing his foot to tuck under the knee of the opposite leg. His head was propped up on the Union Jack pillow.
The bass line of the next song bled through the warehouse and John’s knees nearly fell out. Sherlock pulled away, one eyebrow higher on his face than the other, grey eyes aflame.
John chuckled a bit at that, pulling on taller socks. His cheeks were flushed, sweat lining his brow and dampening his hair.
John’s tutor gave a good, loud laugh. It filled the hall and rang in John’s ears. There was something so satisfying about making this cock of a man laugh. Then, Sherlock began to work. “Well, we know that both plasmids and transposons are components in the cytoplasm, but what type of cell is this particular cytoplasm specific to?”
Sherlock traced the intersecting circles and lines on John's arm. "It's lovely. The artist pulled such clean lines. It couldn't have been easy."
The handkerchief was out of his pocket and at his eyes. He let out a wet, choked laugh. So he had watched Donna’s season. He stared at the letters, heat consuming every inch of his body. Elation flooded him. There was one envelope left. It was crisp and cream in color, with his name written on the front, in gold metallic pen. John Hamish Watson Holmes.
“I wasn’t expecting you so early. I thought you were rehearsing.” Pink spread across Sherlock’s cheeks, the color giving away his embarrassment. John soaked in the vision, becoming more and more rare the better they got to know one another.
The men yanked open their forest green lockers, tossing in their soaked towels and dirt covered cleats. Watson was making quick business of shedding his practice gear, face red and tufts of hair sticking up where salty sweat and tackle after tackle had caused it to run amuck. John stood in his black shorts, scratching his ankle with his other foot. He laced his fingers together and tugged at the back of his neck. “Damnit, Everett. I love Molly. You know I do. But it’s such short notice.”
Sherlock smirked and nodded, stood up and glided back to the stage. John knew their tutoring session was over, and that it had been successful. He packed his bags up and rested his feet on the row of seats in front of him, ready to keep audience as Sherlock continued to play. He watched the elegant man pick up his violin with delicate movements, and bring it to rest on his shoulder. He placed the bow to the strings and John closed his eyes and leaned back, ready to allow the music to consume him.
Sherlock sat in his chair in his flat’s sitting room, light from the morning pouring in through the vast amounts of glass serving as one of the walls. He held a steaming cuppa in his right hand, left perched under his chin in thought.
John stood in his socks until the brilliant man turned the corner. He hustled up his steps and slipped inside the warm apartment. Once safely locked into the heat, John sat on the stair, hands in his hair, and laughed.
John Watson boarded the plane. Others around him watched carefully as he placed his carry-on above his seating assignment. He looked ill: exhausted, gaunt, and all the beautiful glint that lived in his eyes had tarnished into dull, steely nothing. His skin matched the lightest colors of his uniform. He took his place in the middle seat, between an older man and a teenage girl, and snaked his headphones in. His head sunk back into his seat, and he closed his eyes and pushed play.
There was a knock at the door. Jane turned her head, sighing, but the sound halted immediately when she saw Kirsten crying through the window. “John, I’m sorry… do you mind if I…?”
He slipped in front of Sherlock, back to his chest, and felt Sherlock’s hand, hot and possessive, on his left hip, Sherlock’s lips on the pulse point of his neck. He could feel his full lips curving into a smile against his sweat covered skin.
Sherlock swept his Belstaff around his shoulders and tied his blue scarf snug against his gorgeous neck. John stood by the door, feeling a bit anxious. He had heard plenty about Scotland Yard, but was yet to meet any of them. He wasn’t fond of the idea that Sherlock proposed – John had seen enough dead bodies and tended to more than a lifetime’s worth of fatal wounds. Somewhere, though, in the back of his chest, resting close to his spine, was a mad rush of adrenaline waiting to surface. Watson felt a bit sick, knowing he was secretly thrilled that Sherlock wanted him at the crime scene. The tight strings inside him combined with the tight fit of Sherlock’s shirt were enough to make him mad. John savored the tall, dark angel in front of him, those pale eyes and marble skin causing him to itch with want. Something would have to be done about this lack of physical activity, and soon. A man could only resist so much.
“Now John, don’t be dramatic. I saved you, remember?” Sherlock smirked, apparently pleased with his own joke. “Alright? You did just kill a man.”
Katherine started to yell, but John put on the kettle and ignored her. He pulled a single mug from the cabinet and dropped in a bag of chamomile. She stormed from the room, hair debauched and eyeliner smeared from where John had literally fucked her to tears not half an hour before. He gave a smug smile as he admired his handiwork on her neck.
“Jane! You’re the maid of honor! Aren’t you supposed to remember these things?” Molly giggled over her fourth beer. The pasta had not done much in keeping her head clear and focused.
“Sorry, I’m a bit early, but I’ve brought sustenance.” He waved a bag of sub sandwiches awkwardly, and tossed her a cold, bottled coffee drink. Hazelnut.
“Er, if it helps, I’m uh. I’m bisexual?” Wesley offered quietly, and began wringing his hands nervously. “And uh, Sherlock’s gorgeous, mate. Really.” John’s eyes found Wesley’s instantaneously. He had not expected a simultaneous confession. He conveyed his thanks for Wesley’s bravery as best he could.
Sherlock shrugged his shoulders and cracked his neck. He felt uneasy at the casualness of the words Captain Watson used. Fresh, as though this happened all the time. Holmes clenched his jaw. John’s voice had not been accusing or condescending, just factual. Straight to the point. Odd. That was something the younger Holmes only expected from Mycroft or Mrs. Hudson. Not from acquaintances, and certainly not strangers. He could feel the Captain’s eyes on his back.
Sherlock chuckled and reached for the doorknob. “John, uni suits you so well. Did you say these things to everyone you brought into your bed?”
“First and foremost, let’s have a look at those arms of yours.” He stood next to the chair, one knee barely between Sherlock’s legs. The proximity was torture. Sherlock loved every second of it. This is what it was like. To feel like something was just out of your reach. How miserable and enticing. Watson methodically unwrapped the gauze and inspected. “Glad to have you indoors. These will be able to heal much faster now.” He wiped them clean and reapplied the clear gel. Slowly, he wrapped the clean, white mesh around Sherlock’s arms. “How are you feeling?” There was only a hint of taunt to John’s words. The detective knew the doctor wasn’t speaking of the rock hard cock between his legs, nor the ache settling in. “You ought to be drinking more water. Withdrawal symptoms are a nightmare, but staying hydrated takes the edge off a bit.”
“No, this is not the building I normally spend my time in. The professors are idiotic enough to leave the doors unlocked. I come here after lecture to… vent, if you will.”
He had saved thirteen lives that night, fifty-two if you include the lives his squadron had recovered and healed. Three buildings had been wired and triggered by suicide bombers. It was a miracle their base had not housed one of them. He subconsciously rubbed his chest where bandages covered the healing holes that led to his lungs. One of the buildings had still been burning, and John had retrieved a five year old boy from the licking flames. His lungs had been severely damaged, and his time in hospital had spanned nearly two weeks. He was finally starting to feel bits and pieces of himself return.
“Right then. Better go ahead and start giving them a ring. Might be good to just have everyone meet at my flat tonight. Does that work for you?”
John tugged another tie out of his drawer and laced it under the collar of his pale blue button-up. He sighed in frustration. Katherine had called him twenty minutes earlier. Conveniently enough, she had fallen ill in the last two hours. John wasn’t surprised; he never kept a woman too long. His career path wasn’t a traditional one. Women liked a man who is, or wanted soon to be, settled, well off, and easily accessible; John really only qualified in category two. Sometimes the lifestyle is enough to keep a girl for a few months, especially if he was off season, but overall he had become accustomed to short and sweet pairings. He preferred a life of travel, rowdy nights and his friends. So much more of the world had been seen that way. There were few things better than traveling through the night by bus, teammates passed out in various awkward positions, good music leaking through headphones as the lights of different cities whirred past in neon lines. Or the first time he stepped onto a new field, feeling his boots dig into the well-kept grass, the rush of adrenaline that swept through every muscle of his body. John was yet to meet someone that had even remotely convinced him a settled life in London would be better.
“And what destination is that, exactly?” Sherlock spat. The words were nothing special, but they stung like venom.
“It’s no one. Listen, I have to go. I’ll talk to you later.” She hung up before he could respond and placed the whiskey bottle back atop the refrigerator where it belonged.
He touched Sherlock gently, a ghosting of fingers against hard, swollen flesh, and Sherlock gasped, pulling air from John’s open mouth. Their lips lingered, exchanging the remnants of their lungs, occasional contact of their mouths electrocuting John down to his now overly-supplied blood cells. A shudder dove up his spine at the joining of Sherlock’s hand, curious, delicate, and gentle. John’s body keened at the sensation of their fingers interlocked, his breath shaking out of his body as Sherlock’s eyes kept his. John rested his forehead against Sherlock’s, nose brushing his cheek, as they found a rhythm together. Sherlock shifted enough to kiss John on his temple, the bone above his brows, the bridge of his nose.
Molly gave him a cheeky grin. “You know what we say about coincidence.” She assessed him once again, then looked back to the screen.
“Sherlock, honestly. If you want a new performance in less than two months, you needed to have music to me yesterday.” The brunette crossed her arms, booted foot tapping against the light-lined walkway of the theater.
Molly and Callum had exchanged a quiet, wordless conversation, one they had so generously excluded Sherlock from, and told him to come here. His stomach twisted in discomfort. Sherlock had no idea what to expect. He dropped his hand, did a small turn on the top step and growled in frustration. Both his hands grappled with his messy head of hair. He reached for the door instead, checking to see if he could open it without unlocking it, because somehow, in his mind, that seemed less invasive.
Panic swarmed John’s head at the suggestion. It was enough to make a confession of this sort to twenty-two men that looked up to you, admired you, and listened to you. It was something else entirely to describe his new interest to them.
Sherlock gently toed off his trainers; his feet were hurting tonight…this morning? He glanced at his watch. 4:13 a.m. Holmes padded into the stainless, soulless, steel kitchen and put on a stainless, soulless kettle. While he waited for the water to boil, he stepped into the bathroom, just down the hall from the kitchen, running hot water out of the faucet. He sat on the edge, rolling up the ends of his tights, and dipped his toes into the hot, shallow water. They burned, blisters already forming on the balls of his feet. He grabbed a bar of soap and carefully washed. The kettle screamed as he was patting his feet dry.
John’s eyes flittered open, pupils darker and wider. “You, Sherlock. God, I want you.” Sherlock leaned over him, pressing his chest against John’s, and kissed him. Only their lips moved at first. Soft, tender; Sherlock was in a teasing mood. He pulled away and smirked, wrapping those lithe fingers around John and giving him a gentle pull. John sank into the chair and relaxed into Sherlock’s touch. “Jesus, yes. Just like that. How do you already know how to touch me?” Sherlock preened at John’s praise and settled down comfortably on his knees. He gave his wrist a tiny twist and John pushed up into his fist. Sherlock let a quiet sound escape his mouth at that, and his other hand fell between his own legs, rubbing firmly at his own hard on.
The doctor turned to look at him. Sherlock noticed a buzzing rise in his ears. John’s expression was hard to read. “What?” he asked blatantly.
"Gone," Sherlock murmured. John nodded into his shoulder, words becoming too difficult. "She was all you had left, wasn't she?" John bit his bottom lip hard, nodding again. The tears were gathering in his lashes.
Jane choked on the onion hanging out of her mouth. Then she howled, bent over and clutching her stomach, mirth glistening in the corners of her eyes.
Sherlock chuckled, nodded, and then ordered their food. “I’ll have the spaghetti, and Irene would like a lunch portion of the angel hair dalvina.” Joseph nodded and rushed off to the bar.
John glanced up from the pages of his book to see Sherlock typing on his laptop. His tea was propped precariously on a stack of books, steam rising and disappearing. Sherlock’s left leg was tucked up near his chest, the heel of his right foot pushed up off the floor and against the leg of the chair. He was hunched slightly, working intently. John bit his lip to keep from chuckling. He loved stealing tiny bits of Sherlock and storing them away. He knew these would be the thoughts that would get him through the final stretch of hell. Sherlock came to a halt and turned to face John, one eyebrow disappearing into his curls.
The plates had been cleared and John had just finished his second whiskey mix. Molly and Callum were grinning and chatting and everyone around them was alight with their happiness. It was beautiful thing. They were a beautiful thing to witness. The disc jockey brought John a cordless microphone, and he suddenly felt a rush of panic. Is it already time? Had this already happened? My best mate is
“You’re overthinking it, mate.” He felt John tense next to him, turning his shoulders toward the 22 metre area. Callum spoke in a whisper as he turned his back to the pitch and closer to John’s ear. “It’s all fine, John. Truly. Now put this to bed and be with us.” John faced Callum with a look of guilt overtaking his features. He gave one stern nod and exhaled the stale air from his lungs.
He sat in the corner; the floor was dirt and there was one dim light suspended from the ceiling. He blinked his eyes, shocked at the reintroduction of color. He cowered at the condition of his body. John was in nothing but his pants, and his legs were battered and covered in dried blood and earth. His hands were bound and hung limply in his lap. He had been gagged with a cloth through his teeth. The room reeked of death and he tried to fight off thoughts of the inevitable.
“So where is he? Call him up and invite him over.” Rhys waggled his eyebrows and slid down from the counter. John shook his head, a chuckle escaping his mouth in the process.
“Mm?” The just-boiled water overflowed from the rim of the moose mug and gathered next to it on the counter. Sherlock walked into the kitchen and took the kettle from John’s hand, returning it to its eye. Immediately it whistled again. John hadn’t turned it off. Sherlock rubbed the back of his neck and narrowed his eyes.
They danced together in a slow circling waltz. John could hear Sherlock's heart beating away, steady and deep.
John sat comfortably on the floor in front of the sofa, working with his chopsticks to catch a shrimp in his lo mein. Sherlock was in one of his usual catlike positions on the couch, shouting at the telly.
“I have the captain. I don’t need anyone else.” John giggled in delight and pressed his lips to Sherlock’s. His hand trailed through the brown curls as they parted.
After about an hour’s drive, Sherlock flipped his blinker and pulled into a long drive. The pavement was lined with large, blossoming trees, the lawn well-kept and freshly mowed. It reminded John of a golfing green. Soon, a stately house rose at the top of the hill. It was mostly brick, regal but understated with large leaf ivy crawling up the corners. The front door was solid black, and the windows stood out against the old pale pink of the estate. John could see light curtains hanging on the inside of each pane. “What is this place?” John murmured, taken aback by its Pride and Prejudice feel.
that snuck into John’s eyes. Sherlock laughed, and was sure to record that face into the John Watson room of his mind palace. If he spent much more time with him, it would soon be the size of a conference hall. Sherlock smiled at the thought of a John Watson library.
“Hi,” she breathed as she stepped into the doorway. She rocked up on her toes and placed a gentle kiss on B’s mouth.
John nodded. “It’s fantastic, really. Wishing now I’d come out ages ago.” He could feel Sherlock’s smirk next to him and John laughed at the fantastic double meaning. Chachi raised a questioning eyebrow and John waved a hand through the air, dismissing it.
Sherlock drown himself in everything he could. He had selected Soo Lin as the newest addition to his company; she was kind and gracious and talented. Molly adored her, and the two fell together in synchronization like it was nothing unusual at all. The calls to the other candidates went as expected, apart from Moriarty’s, which, Sherlock admitted,
There was no address, no date, it only had his name. Carefully, he pulled out the letter, yellowed with age. Air left John’s chest as he came to the realization that this tiny sheet could be nearly five years old. He unfolded a single sheet to expose his favorite tall, loopy, practically illegible script:
Soon, long, pale legs straddled John’s hips. He gripped Sherlock’s ass between both his hands and pulled him down and in, finally catching friction between them. Sherlock balanced himself atop John with one hand resting on the captain’s shoulder and the other dug firm in his hair. Sherlock traced the shell of John’s ear with his nose, warm breath causing the hair on John’s arms to rise. “Does this, ahh, does this provide you pleasure, John? Is this satisfying?”
Sherlock turned the key in the deadbolt. He pushed his door open and slung his bag onto the table, dropping his keys into a small, ceramic dish. He pulled the hood away from his face and examined the flat. His coordinator was a kind man; he had arranged this living space for Sherlock to have when rehearsals, practices and shows were just too close together for comfort, and while the area was lovely, Sherlock disliked the furbished flat. It was modern. Too modern. Too shiny. Too geometric. Too neutral. “Home” or “comfortable” did not exist in this flat’s vocabulary.
“Touch yourself,” John commanded in as gentle a tone as possible. While Sherlock seemed modestly surprised at the demand, he was quick to obey, in just as teasing a fashion as he did with unbuttoning his top. Sherlock’s magnificent hands toyed with the tented fabric of his bottoms. Locking eyes briefly with John, Sherlock smirked as he let his head fall back, closed his eyes, and chewed that full bottom lip, right palm pressing hard against the top button and zipper, left thumb hooking a belt loop of his bottoms and pulling down. The lines of his hips were a revelation, and John groaned softly, flexing his hips in order to create some friction, any friction, against his leaking cock.
Sherlock stared at the list. He was standing in the middle of aisle four, glancing from the list to the bread selection, and back to the list again. Bread. What the hell sort of specification was that? Wheat? Rye? Twelve grain? Gluten free? Potato bread? What on
And there was charming, devious John Watson, front and center, with all his teammates surrounding him on the green of the pitch. His grin was cheeky, white teeth glittering, and his eyes smiled just the same. Sherlock let a small hum reverberate in his chest at the sight of him. He couldn’t deny that the charming hooker - honestly, could they have not selected a different name for his position? – had made a place for himself in Sherlock’s skull. Sherlock had begun to see him everywhere: flipping through channels on the telly when he needed noise at night; through a window while he was out to dinner; solid visuals now accompanying Molly’s stories; burning in the back of his mind as a polar opposite of Jim Moriarty, everything warm and rich and right; and now, headlining the newspaper he nipped from the poor sod beside him. He smiled, folded the paper, and tucked it into his bag.
"Hello," John said as he wrapped his arms tight around her shoulders. Jane laced her arms around his middle and held him there. They rocked back and forth in a long embrace. He let her go and cupped her face in his hands. John's eyes were already red rimmed, and a small, embarrassed smile took over his mouth. "I'm sorry," he murmured quietly in the crowd.
The detective had succumbed to self-inflicted pleasure, too, in a desperate hope that maybe the physical release would also alleviate his now-useless mind. No such luck. He couldn’t have a clear fucking thought in his head until that godforsaken man stepped foot into his personal space. Then all the chaos was zapped right into beautiful, clean static.
“As I said, I’ve never had a rehearsal that clean before this evening; I feel satisfied. Perhaps I should bring you to every rehearsal and performance,” Sherlock mused.
Sherlock nudged John in the arm, as if telling him to stand down. A man with salt and pepper hair and kind eyes made his way to the tape. “Sherlock. ‘Bout time you showed up.”
“Yes, productive and clean.” His voice was quiet, as if he hadn’t used it for most of the day. John considered this, and imagined that yes, it was possible Sherlock had not spoken to anyone since he and John left each other earlier that morning.
“John! Hi! Please, come in!” She waved him into her classroom. Jane took off the lanyard of keys from her neck and gave him a squeeze.
-Water for Elephants is truly a fantastic story, and truthfully a result of NanoWrimo. Kudos to all my amazing NanoWrimo writers! My friend Emily just finished her first one, and was thrilled!
“Yes.” John looked up at Sherlock, attempting to keep pace with his long legs. The alcohol seemed to be kicking his arse a bit more than he thought. The eyes that found his were quite not what he expected: wide, dark and quite hungry. John’s pulse quickened as Sherlock held the door to the car open for him.
Sherlock pulled John’s face to his and kissed him. Kissed each lip, kissed the corners of his mouth, and let their tongues slide together. John was clutching the fabric of his own clothing, draped over this incredible, fascinating, beautiful creature, on his sofa, in his flat, and he’d even slept in John’s bed to boot. “Jesus,” John breathed against Sherlock’s face, feeling the inevitable rush of blood between his thighs. Sherlock sat up straighter on the sofa, pulling John’s hips down onto his, and kissed through the cotton of his shirt.
“Make sure you clean up. Can’t imagine the nurses would be thrilled to find that sort of mess on the floors already.”
"God, when I talk about these out loud, it's a bit embarrassing. This is Gallifreyan, the language of-"
“Jawn. Why are you leaving me?” Sherlock slumped in his seat until he could snuggle into the crook of John’s neck. “I don’t want you to go.”
"How is it that your job title is grocer, when in fact, you do nothing? Instead, you force us to endure the humiliation of an automated voice if it doesn't want to properly eat our card, and demand we sort through produce selections and typing in deli codes. Isn't that
John felt Sherlock’s hand on the back of his neck, fingers shifting through the hair at the nape of his neck. He closed his eyes and sighed. Did Sherlock know this was one of John’s very favorite things, ever, of all time?
He let loose a rough laugh. “I agree. Thank you, Irene. You always know what I need, even when I do not.”
“Unbutton those. Don’t you dare take them off, just the button there.” The fastening was undone, and, by nature of the way Sherlock had his clothing tailored, it made no difference whatsoever in the positioning of the trousers.
John sat up straight on the couch. He exhaled the stale air he had been holding in his lungs and felt the prick of tears well in his eyes. He stood slowly, set his mug down on the water-ring ridden coffee table, and walked to where Sherlock was standing in the kitchen. The chemist would not make eye contact with him. He was staring at one of the chipped tiles in the floor. John could see shame in Sherlock’s body language; he knew this man never revealed how he felt to anyone. The blonde pulled the cup from Sherlock’s hand and set it on the counter behind him, and carefully wrapped his arms around tall man’s middle. He felt Sherlock stiffen, but didn’t care. John had never been more wrong. It wasn’t that Sherlock believed him to be inadequate. Holmes was mad because he believed John should have better. John sobbed in Sherlock’s dressing robe. He felt a strong, cold hand wrap around his shoulders and the other pressed John’s head further into his chest. John felt more terrified than ever of the application he just submitted, and hoped there was a glitch in the system, or that someone would deem him unworthy of Queen and Country. They stood there a while, Sherlock holding him tight and John shuddering through fits of sobbing. “I’m so sorry, Sherlock,” he finally managed. “I could never do what you do. I am obviously quite horrible at deducing things of importance.”
Watson woke up sweating. In an attempt to kick off the covers, he felt weight next to him. He stilled. Deep breaths fell from a body beside his. His first instinct was to shove it off the bed. Cautiously, he readjusted so the light from the window could lend him a hand. John struggled to focus his eyes and felt his body go weak at his realization. A faint “oh…” fell from his mouth.
Jane stood in the middle of the kitchen and stared at him. He blinked and she was lacing her hand around his neck and pressing the other to his chest. B leaned forward and kissed her gently on her mouth, then another on her forehead. “Thank you for noticing,” she said softly.
“No, no thanks.” John sat in his wingback chair and pinched the bridge of his nose. He was still very much inebriated. He looked over to Sherlock. “Why did you come?” John’s face twisted into something serious. He could feel the heat of embarrassment rising fast into his cheeks and ears. He had ignored Sherlock intentionally. Sherlock wasn’t supposed to see him this way.
“I like him.” Callum shrugged his shoulders and wrung his hands, a nervous laugh following the statement.
Sherlock’s mouth enveloped his: kind, gentle, curious, loaded with tenderness. They kissed in earnest: quiet, desperate, earnest. John felt himself being pushed back into the soft sheets, into the mattress, and then Sherlock’s tongue was running along his bottom lip, seeking permission. His arms were around Sherlock’s neck, hands tangled in those wild curls, breathless and spinning and floating; Sherlock’s large hands were grasping at the thin skin around John’s ribs, hungry and insatiable. John’s neck was covered in perfect, tiny kisses, and Sherlock settled there, his face in John’s neck. His hot breath echoed in his ears.
The tent rustled as a desert breeze pushed its way through. The nights were cold in Kandahar. He pulled his coat on, careful of the wrappings that covered the majority of both his arms, and stepped out barefoot into the sand. Soon they would be moved to a proper facility, but until then, it was tent living. Sherlock loathed it. He was not meant to crawl in and out of canvas, to sweat on a cot or drink unpurified water. But some nights, like this one, he didn’t mind it as much. He rolled up the hem of his slacks and buried his feet deep into the still warm sand. His hands found his pockets and he looked up. The clear nights in the Afghanistan desert were some of the most beautiful things he’d ever seen. He’d never admit that to another soul, that he found beauty in the nighttime. The moon was waning, still almost at the halfway mark. It had just begun to curve.
John chuckled and raised his eyebrows high on his forehead, feigning impatience. “Answer the damn question, Holmes.”
Sherlock shivered at the cheekiness. At the casualty of John’s words, knowing his patient had sat in agony for hours, fantasizing about all the ways he wanted to be taken.
“Better double up that whiskey shot of yours, Watson. It’s gonna be a rough afternoon for you. I hope you have a date lined up.” Callum plucked a Stout from the plastic band and collapsed onto the gray houndstooth couch. He kicked off his trainers and began to prop his feet onto the coffee table.
“Right then, I’ll be out soon.” The hallway door closed and John was left to his own thoughts and the soft sound of water hitting the porcelain tub.
Sherlock smirked. “Yes, apparently I do, if this is how I get rewarded for my brilliance.” He looked smug as hell, and John Watson adored it.
“Oh honestly, John. Context clues. It was a matter of time before one of us asked the other, so of course, I was prepared.”
“Can you hear me?” John folded his right hand over the other in the middle of the table, paying no attention to Sherlock’s mess. Sherlock only nodded in response.
“Nothing. I think it’s perfect. A perfect night for wine with take away.” John beamed at him before taking their food into the living room. They settled into their spots: John sat on a cushion in the floor, Sherlock on the sofa.
They arrived in Brixton right after the sun set. Sherlock stepped out of the cab and strolled up to the yellow tape, John following close behind.
Tito counted down, and John felt Sherlock lace his arm around John’s shoulders and relax. The flash went off, and Tito looked down at the phone, grinning.
So sorry for the delayed post. It's been a bit of a crazy week. Here is Chapter 7; I hope it finds you well. If you aren't well, I hope it makes your life the tiniest bit better. You deserve it. <3
Sherlock lingered by the door, casual conversation still passing between them. John allowed his eyes to rest on Sherlock’s eyes, cheekbones, full lips, expressive brows, laughter lines as he failed miserably at saying goodbye. The man was beautiful. John had never seen a human like him; moderately alien and untouchable in appearance, features exaggerated and sharp, with a demeanor so utterly opposite. He was gentle, kind, timid even. Painfully polite and generous, easily intelligent. John, in most situations, would feel intimidated by a man like Sherlock, a man who was everything good, whole and wonderful, but all he could process was the fact that he wanted to be the source of his laughter. He wanted to pull every expression from Sherlock’s face – shock, fury, confusion, bewilderment, amazement, ecstasy. Oh… Well, that was new.
“I do, too.” John offered, trying to make this conversation easier. Callum chuckled at that. “I’m sorry. It’s a bit difficult for me, this stuff. I know this isn’t what you were expecting, as your friend or your captain. I hope I haven’t disappointed you or let you down. But he’s… I like him. Holy hell, I like him. I was the last person to suspect any of this, and I've a lot of shit to sort. And a lot of explaining to do to plenty of people. But this is what I want. He’s what I want. Does that… I know it doesn’t make sense…” John scratched the back of his neck, finding himself talking in circles. “He makes me want to stay. To settle and adventure at the same time. To curl up in bed and try sky diving. There’s this weird dichotomy between us. He’s quiet, I’m loud. He’s polite, I’m crude. He’s sophisticated, I’m… well, I’m not. He grounds me and I’d like to think I am capable of lifting him up. I feel right, Callum. I just feel right.”
. John looked up into a frightfully attractive face. His predator was tall, a little over six feet at least, with alabaster skin and fierce, gray blue eyes. They rested above absurdly defined cheekbones and were accompanied by a mouth that could only be described, in pure honesty, as full, pouting and delicious. Oh,
“I’m doing quite well, thank you. Congratulations on your win at the International Cup! My father was so excited.”
"You are not human, do not speak to me in such a derogatory way. You're a damned chip and pin machine."
John watched as Callum grinned like an idiot into the phone. Molly was recapping her day, and apparently her maid of honor was back to help with more wedding plans. John knew Callum was grateful; he had been feeling guilty lately for being so absent. Their wedding was in January, and October had just made its appearance. To the boys, it would pass like nothing. Their season would end just before the midwinter ceremony.
“I would say you are a man who cares very little about what others think, and that yes, at times your craving of adrenaline could be interpreted as reckless. Of course, this conclusion is surmised on six interactions, only three of which contained conversing. However, one is able to deduce a great deal about you, John Watson, without ever needing to speak.”
“I certainly will. Here! Shezza, take a photo. He’ll never believe me otherwise.” Graham tossed his mobile to Sherlock, and John felt the heat rise rapidly to his neck. It was one thing, to interact with fans after the matches, or occasionally on the nights the team would go out to celebrate, but he had not expected to meet many here. Certainly not posh, seemingly wealthy ones. Usually it was young women or men, or blokes like Graham’s dad. Or Troy, the bouncer. Graham parked it next to John, wrapping an arm around his shoulders, other hand crossing his chest and pointing at John. His expression said
“Oh, Sherlock. God,” John whispered. His voice was crackly and soft like it sounded in the morning. Sherlock ran his tongue up John’s length. He gasped.
She rolled her eyes and smirked. “Yeah, I noticed.” B popped a fresh green bean in his mouth and she watched his jaw tighten as he poured the remainder of them into the pot on the stove. “I love that you cook,” she said quietly.
She looked up at him with a puzzled look on her face. Her eyes went back to the floor, to B’s shoes, to her fingers. “I have with a few of my students, but mostly about their behavior. There are so many, B. That would be tough. Thirty-five kids.” Her voice trailed off, but he could tell she was mulling the thought over in her head, trying to find a way to make it work. “I could do them over the course of the week, though. Maybe seven students a class period…” She looked up at him and raised her eyebrows.
Sherlock shook his head. “No, I had planned to take a break at your arrival. I know you need my assistance, so I will give you my full focus.”
“There isn’t necessarily a direct correlation between creative abilities and one's ability to experience emotions.”
Her father passed her mitted hands into his, and Callum soaked her in. Molly’s eyes were wet and red, but she was smiling, lips pressed firmly together in a shy way. Her cheeks were rosy, her bare shoulders hardly evident under her beautifully knit shawl, long silk pooling behind her feet.
Sherlock spat into the sink and ducked his hand underneath, sipping the cold water from his cupped palm. He contemplated as he swished the water around his mouth, glad to have the burn of stomach acid gone. Perhaps not completely heterosexual. He rinsed his saliva from the sink and grabbed a washcloth from his bag. He considered the few signs that might speak otherwise. It wasn’t much to go on, but this most recent encounter. Well. He’d only been brushing his teeth. And the act of emptying one’s stomach is far from a typical kink. He remembered the burning of his skin where John had pushed away his unruly curls from his head. The skin of his arms flushed hot at the thought of Watson’s gentle hands tracing the new;y found scars, candid thoughts pouring from his lips as though they had conversations like those every day, and had been for years. Bisexual. John Watson could be bisexual. Sherlock tried to calm the heat rising to his face with the cold, damp cloth. He put his things away, zipped up the duffel and reexamined himself in the mirror. He ran a hand through his disheveled curls, and undid another button on his shirt. He leaned down to pick up his bag and walked out the door. John stood next to it at attention. Sherlock chuckled, and the doctor turned at the sound.
John had grown so terribly fond of Sherlock’s way with stringed instruments. It was calming for him, to hear his best friend, a well-known asshole, concocting beautiful, intricate, moving music. John paused as he searched through his bag, quickly realizing he did, in fact, believe this brunette to be his best friend. They'd only known each other barely a month; sure, it wasn't normal to deem someone a "bestie" when you hardly know a damn thing about them... especially when you're in your late twenties. But something was unspoken between the two of them. The chemist was mellow, bearable, occasionally considerate around John. The more time he witnessed Sherlock with other people, the sooner John realized his treatment was far more generous than what others received.  Sherlock never rehearsed in front of anyone apart from John. Watson felt like he held a grand secret about the great Sherlock Holmes: he knew of the little soul he possessed. A Spock in a world full of James T. Kirks, slowly revealing the sweetest bits of his humanity. And they were precious, indeed.
“Shezza!” John looked up at the sound of a male voice, bristling a bit despite himself. A tall, dirty-blonde broke through the crowd near them and clapped Sherlock on the shoulder. It seemed genial.
John heard a rap at his door. He opened it wide and Sherlock swept in, coat and all. John glanced out the entrance into the rain-soaked road and saw a black car parked on the curb.
“For fuck’s sake!” Egan said good-naturedly. Rhys was an animal, and everyone knew it. They had all learned that no woman was safe from Rhys’ endless string of vulgar commentary. Except Molly. Callum had said his fair share, but Molly had been the one to set him straight. One, solid smack across the face. John remembers the snarling words that left her mouth so well: “You will
“To my best mate, my idol, and my captain. John Watson, in case you haven’t met him. S’good to have you back.” The glasses clunked clumsily together and the boys downed the beer in one, solid go. John wiped his mouth on his sleeve and laughed.
Sherlock sat perfectly still in the ergonomic, plastic chair of his room, his fingers steepled under his chin as he desperately tried to ignore the tension under the fly of his trousers. It had been nearly two hours, John was due back anytime, but Sherlock refused to relieve himself. Masturbation was for the ordinary. He had talked himself down from it several times before; he most certainly could do so now. But… it was proving to be difficult, knowing Watson could stroll in, dressed in that fucking fantastic uniform. Sherlock had played through several scenarios in his head, all which led to a sexual release. He knew, though, that the chance of any of those things happening was slim to none. The doctor was playing a game, but furthermore, proving a point. Sherlock wanted him. God, he desperately wanted him. Wanted to rake his hands through his sun colored hair, wanted to lick his tan wrists, wanted to grind his pelvis against that desert khaki uniform. Watson had won, and Sherlock didn’t give a flying fuck. He just wanted to
“Sad to see you go, buddy, but ready for a night we may not remember!” He chugged the rest of his pint and wiped his mouth with his sleeve. “Where’s Sherlock?”
Finally, Sherlock gave an involuntary plunge into John’s mouth, and John moaned, taking one hand to Sherlock’s back and applying pressure. “Yes, Sherlock. Please.” Sherlock’s eyes opened to reveal nearly solid black circles. John bit at his lip as Sherlock pressed the head of his cock against his mouth. “Jesus, yes, just like that.” His hips gave a slow rock forward, slipping into the warmth of John’s mouth, and back out again. Sherlock tilted his head up and back and pressed both his palms to the floor. A growl rumbled from his throat as he continued to rock into John’s mouth and pull himself nearly all the way out. John clawed at Sherlock’s back and hummed in delight as Sherlock set a steady rhythm. As his movements became more erratic, John noticed Sherlock sinking his teeth into his bicep to muffle his sounds. He held Sherlock’s hips steady, but only for a moment. “I want to fucking hear you.” He licked tauntingly at Sherlock’s length and released his hips. “Are we clear?” Sherlock’s eyes went wide at the command in John’s voice, and nodded. John took Sherlock into his mouth and pulled Sherlock’s hips forward again. Sherlock shifted one hand from the floor and fisted a handful of John’s hair in it instead. John nodded and gasped. Sherlock was pistoning his hips at a near frantic rhythm, all the muscles in his body tensing. He pulled out of John’s mouth and wrapped his other hand around his cock. He took two deep breaths through his nose. John clawed down his chest and kissed the inside of Sherlock’s wrist. “Yes. Come for me. Please, Sherlock.” Sherlock’s hand gave three swift pulls.
“So fucking gorgeous,” John whispered as he skimmed his fingers over Sherlock’s now trembling thighs. Sherlock huffed a small and shaky laugh. He shimmied down until he was straddling John’s hips, and leaned forward and gave John a slow and sated kiss. He dropped his forehead against John’s and shared air until they were both back at a decent resting heart rate. Sherlock slowly stood and pulled John up with him. They stared at each other, only clad in socks, and then laughed.
“John, this is Mrs. Hudson, my landlady. Mrs. Hudson, this is my Jo—, er, I mean John Watson.” John felt an odd twitch in his chest in response to Sherlock’s mistake.
“I mean, I suppose it is. I’ve met the Detective Inspector. Lestrade is his name. Greg Lestrade.” Callum shot her a look. “He only came by to pick up a case file from Sherlock. It’s sort of amazing, really, to listen to the two of them talk. It’s like another language. Well. At least when Sherlock talks.”
“Sorry, do you mind if I go ahead and brush my teeth?” John was never so adamant about brushing his teeth that he would interrupt someone showering. But this wasn’t anyone, of course. It was the delicious Sherlock Holmes, whom John felt he had seen far too little of for being home nearly three weeks.
John stood from the bed and walked wordlessly into the kitchen. Sherlock sat motionless as the duvet where John sat whispered softly; the feathers shifted and new air filled the space. Sherlock crawled from the comforter and moved into the kitchen. John had found a clean tumbler and was in the midst of opening a new bottle of Jameson. Sherlock crossed the room in seconds and rested his hand gently on John's.
“Pay attention, Irene. The composing has been ongoing for nearly a month and a half. And of course I made a recording. God forbid you conduct your interpretation of my music.”
, John smiled. Egan Scott would crash head on into something with the utmost devotion without needing to know all the details.
They sat together on the sofa, but there was no sharing of blankets, rubbing of feet or raking of hair. Initially, it put John off. Didn’t Sherlock miss him? He wanted to press himself as close as he could to his demi-god and feed off his warmth. John realized later, though, that he wasn’t exactly in a position to be cuddled or snuggled with, given his physical condition. And Sherlock was cautious. Rightfully so... a lot had happened in a year and a half.
“It makes me feel sick because you were mutilated in a fucking cave in the middle of the desert. I would not wish that on most people, but most certainly never on the bravest, kindest man I have ever met. I also am disgusted with the fact that I could not find and save you any earlier than I did. Perhaps that shoulder could have been spared, if I’d only paid closer attention.”
John carried the Chinese take away up the stairs and into the kitchen. He pulled each container from the plastic bag and felt Sherlock at his side, drifting in from the couch at the smell of dinner. A pale index finger and thumb reached out and plucked a shrimp from John’s lo mein.
"They wouldn't let me see her. It wasn't until the next day they showed me the body. Her hair had turned scarlet. The back of her skull was just..."
“Brave woman. You are a kind-spirited individual though, filled with a strong desire to not only help develop strong artists, but strong people. It has been a struggle, your adjustment to this year’s student body. Has it not?”
“I think you understand now that your admissions office is not located in this building.” Sherlock drawled.
“How could I forget? Never met a man with such instrumental talent and a knack for knowing exactly what I feel when I feel it. A bit spooky, that. Sherlock. Welcome.” Sherlock stepped forward and extended his hand yet again. Callum took it. John’s face relaxed right before Jane’s eyes.
“I can see why you like him, Molly. Does he make you dance that way? I’d say Callum’s a fan, too, if he does.”
“You’re intelligent, and far from lacking in the ego category, but you seem less informed about social situations and proper interactions, and mildly heartless, so I would steer away from humanities. You seem honest and concise, not lending yourself to more extravagant majors, such as literature. I might say history, but I don’t know. I don’t pin you as as someone who cares about what others are or are not doing.”
He rolled flat onto his back and stared at the darkness where his ceiling should be. He wiped the sleep from his eyes with his ring finger and let his hand slap back to the mattress. His eyes fluttered closed again as he mulled over the tights-and-lights infused dreams he had been having over the course of the week. John allowed the gears of his head to slowly crank themselves into motion. He listened to the occasional cab whirring past outside his window, knowing that few others were awake this early in the birth of the day. He peered back at his clock. 4:32 am. With a huff of breath, he kicked the covers off and rolled out of bed, padding into the bathroom, where cold, ceramic tile greeted him.
Sherlock nodded, eyes bright. John grinned, now being able to identify the given expression Sherlock gave him as pride.
It was agonizing and gorgeous. The piece was consistent and strong, the notes flexing and folding under each other when new ones were introduced. It sounded virtuous, confident, but ever so humble. The notes never carried too long, and they were layered together, never one voice overpowering another. It seemed as though Sherlock had spent ages composing it, toiling over the tiniest, most minute decisions, considering the smallest fragment to be of the same importance, just as essential, as the crescendos he wrote. The sounds nestled deep inside his bones and made him feel much too big for his body.
“Some of her chai? Yes. I’m assuming you want a cup, then?” John turned away and made for the kitchen as Sherlock stepped into the bedroom to peel off his sweat soaked clothes.
“Yeah, the girls were telling us ‘bout you. Said you’re a menace, fantastic, and apparently very hot on Shezza.”
“You could not have known, John, nor could you have prevented it. We were not firing on all pistons that evening, obviously. Don’t apologize. Miscommunication is a common issue amongst couples.”
“May I have you now?” He felt Sherlock rise to a sitting position. John gently opened his eyes, the lights from the vanities creating a halo around Sherlock’s ridiculous hair.
Silence filled the space between them as she chewed at her lower lip, her eyebrows pulled into a tight and rather intimidating furrow. As Sherlock turned to her, she cocked one in defiance. “You should reassess that tone. In case you haven’t noticed, I’m not John. I’m only trying to clarify. Care to try that again?”
The Duke and Duchess is a real gastropub located in the heart of London, not five miles from St. Bart's.
“Shit.” John gave a nervous laugh. Wesley’s brow creased, the confusion evident on his face. “His name’s Sherlock.” John let the bomb drop, explode and the aftermath settle as he knocked back the remainder of his Imperial. His left hand was trembling profusely. He clenched it tightly and found Callum’s eyes.
John choked on his soda, his straw grabbing at the opportunity to stab him in the gum. “What? New Scotland Yard? Is that even
There was a solid knock at the door and Jane squealed. She ran to answer it, making no effort whatsoever to hide her delight. She swung the door open and her chest made a tiny leap. John had a hand in Sherlock’s hair, attempting to calm a wild chunk of curls. Sherlock was grumbling, swatting at John’s wrist.
John was only meters from the exit. It was dark outside, but the pathetic, makeshift hallway was dimly lit with 40 watt bulbs, planted in the sides of the walls. He heard voices in front of him, likely the guards, and tried to figure out how he was going to make it past them.
“Leave him be, Irene. You know he’s holding auditions today.” Irene turned her eyes on the brown eyed girl, ruthlessly running over her striped leg warmers and giant plaid flannel, Callum’s, most likely. She had spoken to Molly a few times, usually in Sherlock’s company. Irene had to admit she was a bit peeved that Sherlock had left
John blinked slowly, allowing sunlight to leak into the back of his head. He inhaled deeply, breathing in cedar, cigarette smoke and warm spice. His stretched out over pale grey sheets. John froze. This was not his bed.
“You… proposing…” John barely managed between gasps of air. “What would that… even be like?” Tears were rolling from his cheeks, his face completely pink, eyes squinting and happy.
“I know, Jane. I know.” He didn’t know what exactly, but it didn’t matter. Horrible things happen to great people, and his life was a fucking shining example.
John laughed aloud. It was a pleasant and genuine sound. “You are a not a tent-living kind of man, are you, Mr. Holmes?”
John yanked off the jumper in defeat. He hadn’t the faintest of what he ought to wear. John was certain he had not fretted this much over his first date, or
“Don’t be so dramatic.” John peeled his shirt off, straight over his shoulders, and balled it into his fist, wiping his face and chest. “And I figured you’d get off to being pinned up anywhere.” Naturally followed by a devious smirk.
Not entirely new. Not appallingly new. Not earth-shattering, deal-breaking, but-dear-god-I’m-straight-new. John wasn’t wrapped up in that, not at the moment. Sherlock was shrugging himself into his coat and smiling small into his chest, like he’d just taken hostage of the most precious, perfect secret to keep all for himself. John stepped forward on impulse, extending his hand to caress Sherlock’s cheek with the pad of his thumb. It wasn’t a gesture that should have filled every crevice of his body, but he felt electrocuted all the same. Sherlock’s face fell quiet. His eyes grew the smallest degree larger on his face, his mouth in a straight but curious line, a tiny furrow forming between those wonderfully expressive brows. “John?” It was a soft sound, a tender endearment. John had never heard his name spoken in such a way, an equivalent of “love” or “sweetheart.” Sherlock spoke his name like he had done it for years, like it was slotted in the common vocabulary center of his mind palace, an autocorrect for a million other words. John’s heart fluttered at the single syllable. He smiled and tucked a stray lock of Sherlock’s mostly cropped hair from his forehead. This was different.
“Sherlock just gave me some of the compositions, and I was wondering if you’d mind if I ran through them a few times.”
He felt the long arms wrap around him, making a refuge for him inside his silly coat. John felt Sherlock’s chin rest atop his head.
Sherlock huffed a small laugh and shook his head. “I’m grateful we found her. Our selection was shameful.”
“No, no. It wasn’t meant to be an insult. I’m just amused by you sitting here, pretending it’s a silly pastime when you’ve written two books. And done nothing with them. You’re too humble for your own good, John. Honestly.”
B felt his eyebrows jump in surprise. “Well. That’s a first. I was told by What’s Her Face that my heart beat too slowly. Or maybe that I didn’t have one.”
Sherlock pulled his head up and cocked it to the side, like a dog that had heard a funny noise. He looked confused. “Because you’re here…?”
“I can always rely on the captain to point out the painfully obvious.” Holmes shot daggers into Watson’s back as he followed him into the white walled facility. It seemed as though it might be a lovely building, but he was desperately trying not to focus on the excess saliva gathering around his tongue. The glands at the back of his throat began to tingle, his warning sign.
“Your CV is printed and stored in a clear pocket, which happens to be visible in your bag. You’ve recently run water, I would assume cold, across your face and through your hair, revealing that you might be struggling with a bout of nervousness. One would assume the conversation you were planning to have is an important one. Thus, graduation, future employment, so on and so on. Why else would anyone visit the admissions office?”
John gave Sherlock’s fingers a gentle squeeze. Sherlock nodded delicately to him, lifted John’s hand to his mouth and kissed the back of his palm.
"Favorite Incubus album. Angry enough, sad enough, pressing enough. Listened to it for months after Harry died. That tattoo documents my life at its most pathetic."
“Ah, but you’ve had six. Certain you still want to continue on? Like you said, I’m a bit of a mess.”
As soon as Sherlock’s outstretched arm broke the circle, John raised an eyebrow. Sherlock halted, confused. He tilted his chin to the side. And then John smirked.
Soon, they were out of London and curving through the countryside. John rested his skull against the seat and closed his eyes, enjoying the smell of warmer weather and freshly blooming flora. Only months before, he had been driving through the rolling hills of Ireland, the idea of Sherlock only a fleeting and illogical fantasy. He squeezed Sherlock’s knee. The handsome brunette wrapped his free fingers around John’s and returned the gesture.
“Hey,” she whispered. Callum looked up at her through sad eyes, a small smile pulling at the corner of his mouth. “You are an amazing man, Callum, and an amazing friend. He
The next envelope to surface was bent and ripped in two places, with a return stamp on the front. It was addressed to his base in Afghanistan.
John's tattoos have all been  thought out (and drawn out). The draft is in an earlier chapter, should you wish to see it. He will continue documenting through our story as well. Also, I have no shame is representing all my fandoms. ;)
“That was John Watson.” He shifted uncomfortably in his seat, trying to target the cause of the heat rising to his cheeks.
Jane’s eyes got a bit bigger on her face. “Wait. You were there until almost four and you just snogged?”
The detective lifted John’s chin and admired his doctor’s blazing cheeks, the warmth of his breath and smell of tea filling his nose, his bare chest, scars freshly healed and shining. A line of teeth and tongue found the corner of John’s mouth down his neck, along his left clavicle, and then he knelt down and picked the doctor up. The insides of John’s knees found Sherlock’s hips and then his legs were wrapped around him. Holmes covered John’s back with his long arms, pulling him as close as he could manage, their hips dangerously aligned. Watson's head fell back in pleasure as Sherlock softly kissed the fresh scars of John’s left shoulder. They were beautiful; webbed and splattered, like a Jackson Pollock painting. As much as Sherlock hated himself for being late to the saving-John-early date, this new flesh was evidence of their loss, terror and love for one another. It was a permanent documentation.
“No, no one in particular. We’re just going to scope the location, get a feel of things. Gather some evidence.”
“I think it was necessary,” Sherlock murmured. “I would not have been fair with my judgment otherwise.” He took a swig of his smoothie and crossed his feet at the ankles, resting comfortably against the counter. “How is the choreography going with Soo Lin? Do you feel as though you are still compatible?”
“Been a rough month, Jess.” Callum responded, trying desperately to make a discreet head tilt towards John, and failing. John laughed aloud, the sound feeling foreign. He missed it.
He wrote his best music here, deafened by the rush of liquid at his feet and nothing else. The sun warmed his pale skin, and while he knew most people believed him to be inhuman, he too relished in sticky sweat and a light breeze and the ability to succumb to being present, wholly, in a moment.
“Tell me more.” John whispered. It was not a request; it was a demand. He gave Sherlock a gentle push to the door. Once inside, he pinned Sherlock to the nearest wall.
John was in search of the admissions office, in order to discuss his CV and graduation information before he submitted his application to the military. He had obviously believed the office was housed in this building, and he had obviously been wrong. He walked down silent halls, growing anxious at the sound of his own heavy footedness. That’s when he heard it. The violin, seeping out one of the classrooms. John walked straight to the door and glanced into the window, somehow expecting a beautiful, redheaded female. He was surprised instead to see a man. A tall, dark haired individual, a mess of curls, eyes closed and arms moving his bow delicately across the thin neck of the dark wooded instrument. He wore black, well-tailored dress slacks and a pressed, white button down. His frame moved in time with the gorgeous piece he was playing. John nudged the door open as the other man had his back facing him. He leaned against the frame and watched curiously, savoring the sound, but also the form, in front of him.
“Oh, hush and let us in.” John stepped into the door and grabbed Jane in a tight hug. She wrapped her arms around his neck and squeezed, kissing his temple in the process. He pulled away and she smiled brightly at him.
John’s heart rate steadily rose. Sherlock’s lips had just made contact with his skin. Christ. “I’m not.” He admired Sherlock’s sleepy eyes and tousled, debauched hair. His voice was rougher in the morning, husky and deep from sleep. It was lovely. Sherlock propped up on an elbow and wrapped his arm around John’s chest, gently kissed his shoulder through his white t-shirt, and nestled his chin there. “Comfortable?” John quipped.
“Did you just see that tackle? B Collins is holding nothing back tonight. St Helens, in the lead, 30-7.”
Why hadn’t anyone told him? He mulled it over in his head, trying to remember the last three weeks. Could Molly have mentioned it and he had just deleted it? After all, John Watson had held no particular significance before three days ago. He looked up to find John staring at him, waiting for some sort of response. Sherlock raised an eyebrow, hoping that would be enough to prompt John to continue.
Sherlock loosened his scarf as he settled into his seat on the plane, plucking a paper from the sleeping man next to him. He put in his headphones and slid his bag underneath his chair, crossed his legs in the small space the seat in front of him allowed, and unfolded the paper. He couldn’t stifle the laugh coming from his lips at the sight of the headline.
“Yes, alright. But if I look, you’re locking that damn thing up after. And meeting me in the shower.”
The oak door pulled open and a stunning brunette held her own in the frame. She was taller this evening, wearing a moderate heel, her hair pulled up in a tumbling mass of curls. She had gentle, brown eyes and thin lips pulled into a warm smile.
Sherlock turned and kissed John fervently. John grinned at the realization he wanted to devour him. Maybe even whole.
Sherlock slipped two fingers between his teeth, whistling loudly with Chachi, admiring the curve of John’s neck against the floor, the easy strength resting in his biceps and deltoid, hoisting his body effortlessly in the air. It wasn’t that Sherlock had believed John to be clumsy or uncoordinated. He knew that wasn’t true. Graceful, however, was not something Sherlock would have previously believed John to be. As Sherlock roved over the flexing of the moon phases banding his upper arm and the movement of the tendons underneath his Union Jack, far more explicit images flooded Sherlock’s mind. Could John lift him by the thighs, pin him to the wall, and fuck him senseless? Would John bark orders when he was on in the bedroom? Would he wash Sherlock’s hair in the shower? Did he trounce around his flat, starkers and gorgeous?
“I ought not have ever met you. You have been the absolute ruin of me.” John’s eyebrows knit together, confused and a bit put off. “The Work is no longer a priority, I use words like fond, excited and
“Mols, you know I just got out of that relationship with Ian. I don’t want a damn thing to do with dating anytime soon.”
Sherlock made quick work of the button and zipper; he gently tugged at the waistband of his trousers. John arched his hips up as Sherlock slid his clothes down past his knees. He closed his eyes and kissed the sharp lines dipping along John’s hips. His hands found the soft skin on the inside of John’s thighs.
Sherlock turned and stole a glance at John’s face. He made note of the wetness of John’s eyes and the tension in his shoulders. He said nothing, knowing now was no time for digging up what was sure to be a cavernous amount of rough background. He could hardly stand John leaking tears of happiness. He was certainly not prepared for the opposite. Sherlock watched John carefully, documenting the twitch of his right foot, covered in a gray wool sock; the way he sprawled out on a sofa that was not his,
He arranged the bread onto a plate and added a side of butter. B delivered the snack to the dining room table and fell in behind her, wrapping one arm around her waist and pressing his chin to her shoulder.
“Is that what it was like, Sherlock? When I came home from Afghanistan for my father’s funeral?” The doctor felt a pang of guilt deep in his ribcage. How had he let that terrible place change him so much?
Sherlock nodded, reaching into his pocket and pulling out an MP3 device, and over to the inside of his booth, extracting a plain, manila folder. He passed both over the table, and Irene snatched them, tucking them into her oversized handbag.
He knew something had unfolded inside him that could not be cleanly put away again. There had been a time in his life when he would have walked away from someone with so much baggage, and without a second thought. He had a life of his own: a company to direct; music to compose; dancers to train; a foundation to build. Sherlock had never imagined he would be sitting on the sill of some man's window eagerly awaiting the next time he would be washed with John's voice or gifted the sound of his laughter.
Okay. Okay. That was painfully new. He ran a hand through his hair and rested his other on his hip, pacing on the damp sidewalk. Cabbies and motorbikes whirred by, leaves rushing onto the pavement in tiny twisters.
John couldn’t lie. Sherlock pressed this close to him made certain things inevitable. His breathing had gone completely haywire; he felt like his flesh was melting where Sherlock’s arms wrapped around his middle, shamelessly, he might add; Sherlock’s entire front was flush with all of John’s back and it was painfully distracting.
Jane winked mischievously. John grinned, huge and bright, as they took their places on the floor. Jane sat in chair placed dead center of the floor and John stood beside her, his back to her and arms folded across her chest. She crossed her legs, and the song began.
Sherlock stood at the end of the aisle, tall and dark and elegant. His neck was craned into the chin rest of his instrument, his wild curls more untamed than ever, a full-force grin taking his lips at the sight of John. Holmes suit was black, and around his neck was an eggplant bowtie. His eyes were a magnificent silver, sending out their own light source even from meters away. John clasped his hands in front of him and stared straight up, attempting his usual method of fighting off tears. He failed, and smiled at the insistent leaking of his eyes.
Sherlock picked up his mug and habitually raised his eyebrow. “Yes, well. Don’t get used to it.” And with that, Sherlock walked into the living room, plopped into his gray, leather chair and turned on the telly.
“Everything alright there, Watson? You seem… tense. I know it’s been difficult, transitioning from Eccleston, but honestly, it’s just a show...”
“Tell me about them?” he asked, his voice laced with curiosity. He tugged at the cuff of the cotton crew shirt.
“Don’t forget to call me, Sherlock.” His voice was soft, traces of easily noticeable mania seeping in at the edges.
“Are you always going to be like this? After we solve a case?” John’s face was still cradled in Sherlock’s lithe fingers, and suddenly John wanted them in his mouth, running his tongue between them.
Jane grinned ear to ear. John immediately dropped his hand, fiddling with the hem of his jumper instead. A deep blush spread across his cheeks. Jane raised an eyebrow.
John was being pushed away, then turned. He felt both hands grip the concave parts of his hips and pull. There was hot breath in Watson’s ear; he began to feel faint. “Sherlock.” The voice was deep, dark and glorious. John shivered. Jesus Christ. John wrapped an arm up and around Sherlock’s neck and gripped the other hand on his hip. He watched as his knuckles grew white. Teeth were biting at the curve of his ear. John reached into the head of curls and tugged. He felt a fantastic hardness twitch underneath him in unison.
. To the right was a parlor of sorts that appeared to be hardly used. It dawned on John that Sherlock likely never had company here. He trailed Sherlock further into the house. Down the hall they met the kitchen. It was large and open, white ceramic tile covering all the countertops and serving as a backsplash. A warm grey met the pale tile and made the big space welcoming, even in its vastness.
A warm crash hit John then, deep in his chest, spreading to every digit on his extremities; it heated him from his ears to the soles of his feet. Sherlock had signed his name on those terrified letters. In all the time he and John had been friends, Sherlock
He didn’t respond, physically or verbally. Sherlock continued to watch him, a deep crease forming between his brows. At least three minutes had passed when the kettle finally began to shriek. Even then, John’s reaction was delayed, and it was as if he had been scared straight out of his skin. Almost like he had forgotten the kettle was on at all…
“Was it alright?” He implored, eyes wide but not quite worrisome. Molly’s brow furrowed in response. What could he possibly mean? The ceremony? The venue? The honeymoon? The sex? She smirked at that thought, biting her lip in an attempt to keep from being clever. It seemed like a solemn moment for Callum, a genuine question heavy on his mind.

“What he means to say is that we love you both. I love you both,” Jane offered from the bottom stair. B laced his fingers between hers and she waved with her free hand. Sherlock draped his arm around John’s shoulder and returned the gesture before they headed inside.
He had read Sherlock’s letter three times over. It was a particularly long one, especially for Sherlock. John had grown accustomed to being the lengthy one of the two, so this was a pleasant surprise. The detective’s words made him feel some kind of way, but John couldn’t find the proper term for it. He swished the coffee around in his mouth before swallowing it. His tongue clicked as he mulled over Sherlock’s word choices.
Sherlock’s skin prickled as he pushed through the exit door, releasing the hot breath he had held still in his lungs.
John stood on the top step, nearly shivering, and ran his thumb along the wax seal of the envelope he held for Molly. Callum was a wreck, fit to be tied. Not in a bad way, you see, but in the best way.
An hour and a half later, she heard her phone ring. She hummed along with the score for the Star Trek original series. Jane didn’t answer. Ten minutes later, it rang again. She groaned, loud and annoyed, as she swayed her way into the kitchen, where her phone was buzzing against the counter-tops. She picked it up and placed it to her ear.
John laughed as Callum picked Molly up and slung her around his hip and through his legs. He dipped her forward, slow and steady, her legs sinking between his, and he planted a tender kiss on her chest. A laugh rippled through her ribcage and escaped from her tilted neck, dancing out of her mouth and into the room as one of the most joyous sounds John had ever heard. The two moved flawlessly, Callum tall and strong and Molly agile and certain. Her dress was a streak of white and matched the permanent grin on Callum's face.
John was stirred from his vacant state by a hand on his back. He blinked several times. Everyone else had disappeared. He was standing in the same place he had been for nearly three hours. It began to rain. Sherlock pulled John into his shoulder and held him.
“Skimming for a bit of recreational reading, are we? I know you solved it nine chapters ago, so either you’re a masochist for enduring such terrible writing, or you’re intentionally pretending I’m not here. Either is fine, but regardless, I need to dress your wounds now. Six minutes of your time.”
He picked up his whiskey glass and took a sip, raising his eyebrows over the rim. As he set it down, he whispered into the microphone, “just a little liquid courage.” He saw Sherlock smile from the corner of his eye, the last little push into action.
How many tunnels did these termites need? He was horribly lost and trying to repress the frenzy that was welling from his heart, spreading like venom through his entire body. He focused on snow, his sheets at Baker Street, Billy the skull, Sherlock watching out the window, face calm and knowing, waiting for his return. He thought of the thin, silver band still housed in the drawer of his side table.
“Aren’t you looking dishy.” John turned as quickly as he could, considering, as his eyebrows shot up. He blinked several times, his eyes clearly struggling to focus.
“Obviously. I had heard of you through Molly, but only pieced it together with the identification of Callum. I understand now the intensity of your eyes – you recognized me, felt some kind of way about me, dare I say attraction?” John ghosted a kiss across Sherlock’s mouth and smiled. “Yes, then, attraction. You were put off by Irene, unsure of her relationship to me, but dropped your eyes and continued as if nothing had happened. You spoke nothing of it to Callum or Molly, obviously fretting over them discovering, but why? You had previously identified as heterosexual, and indeed carry a reputation of being a very giving and satisfying lover, but only with women. The answer lies there, then. Why are you attracted to a man when you so love women, and if there were the possibility of your being bisexual, wouldn’t you have discovered it, working with a slew of highly attractive, by society’s standards, men? So I’m special then, special indeed, to make John Watson question his sexuality.”
“So when do you intend to tell me where you learned to dance?” Sherlock was curled up on the couch, feet covered in wool socks and a thick knit blanket. John was bent over, head stuck in the fridge, debating his drink choice.
John was out of his chair and crossing the tiled floor. He wrapped his arms instinctively around her as she shook, sobbing into his chest. He only held her, not saying a word, and waited for her to find herself again. She pressed her forehead into John’s sternum and sighed deeply. Her fingers clutched the wool of his jumper.
?!" John bellowed, tears moving fast down his face. "You are stupid, Sherlock Holmes, to care about me. Have you not yet deduced it?" he snarled. "I do nothing but leave a trail of destruction. Run, while you can. Get away from me." He sobbed and moved his hands to his face, his cries both muffled and amplified. Sherlock pulled John into his arms and held him to his chest.
As Sherlock turned with a small smile on his face, his eyes alight with comfort, John knew. This was no ordinary emotion, no soon-to-fade infatuation. He leaned forward into Sherlock’s space, one hand touching those feathersoft curls and the other resting gently on Sherlock’s cheek, and he kissed him.
“Yes.” Jane was quickly beginning to realize she didn’t want his company after all. Would he understand? “Sam was killed last night,” she blurted, her voice already cracking.
Callum stole a careful glance in his direction, debating whether or not he needed to run an interference. John grinned, feeling safe in his skin again.
Okay. There aren't many words. I missed you all. I missed these characters. I can't say how often these remaining chapters will come, only that I have one here for you now.
Sherlock brushed past him and walked outside into the sun. John, laughing to himself, followed. He heard the click of a lighter and turned to see Sherlock’s cheeks hollowed as he dragged on his cigarette. The end burned a hot red. John, feeling like a traitor, found this act incredibly attractive. He hated smoking, God, he hated it. Sometimes he would turn girls away, even if they just smelled of it. Holmes had become an exception to the aspiring doctor's rule. Sherlock’s pale fingers moved the filter from his mouth and the smoke left his lips. John soon realized he had been staring, and knew Sherlock would have felt it. He broke the trance and instead took to staring at his feet, trying to regain his composure.
Sherlock smirked and turned back to the room. It was small, but obviously a vast improvement compared to the sand floor and canvas walls of the tent. It was all white, a bit unnerving, and perfectly clean. The facility was brand new, Sherlock knew this, and he was the first patient to stay in room 221, located in wing B. He chuckled at the thought of christening it.
John waited, buried as far into his corner as he could. Fuck this. Fucking fuck this. He wasn’t an Army Doctor to get abducted, tortured and pissed on. He felt inclined to bitch that this was not, in fact, in the job description; he felt sick knowing Sherlock had lost sleep at night envisioning something like this.
As he stood guard outside the wretched building they called base, he mulled over the words in Sherlock’s letter. “I’m ready for you to be back…” John thought of the thin skin across Sherlock’s wrists, the pale blue of those fierce eyes, the dark curls falling around those absurd cheekbones. He pictured the object of his affection pacing impatiently through the flat, fingers under his chin. Perhaps he has a cigarette lit, or maybe, hopefully, by now Sherlock has quit smoking. Regardless of how attractive he looked in the process, John hoped he would eventually give up the petty addiction. His best friend was a doctor, after all.
“Quite right. Perhaps I’m…” John sucked in air as Sherlock bit playfully at his ear, “dishing out all the good compliments far too soon.”
The captain’s foot tapped in beat with the 90’s grunge. Behind his closed eyelids, a movie started to roll. He saw Bart’s, back in his university days, before his submission of his CV to the Army Careers Information Office. He saw his feet crunching against freshly fallen leaves, glowing rich reds and oranges against the bland cement of the sidewalk, remembered the feeling of a hot cup of tea seeping into his gloves, the cold of a London winter. Harry at her peak of catastrophe, rolling in at all hours of the morning, his nervous fidget of drumming his fingers on his knees during exams, rugby practice on the fields in the hot of summer. A casual string of lovely women in and out of his dorm in the spring, endless cups of coffee, the first time he met Sherlock Holmes...
“You ridiculous man. You are never a waste of my time. Take the day, yeah? Read something, hole up in a coffeehouse somewhere, order something sweet. You need it.”
John sucked in a few steadying breaths. He pulled away from Sherlock and turned his back to him, reaching for the Jameson and pouring it down the sink. "It means 'be here.' Callum and I did it together. A reminder to be present. A documentation that Harriet is gone. A promise to move forward." Sherlock watched him shake his head. "It's impossible to do when her death date is staring me in the face." He sat down on the couch and folded into himself. Sherlock brought a blanket and sat next to him. "I miss her."
Suddenly, the dancers split from their formation, each of them moving out closer to the edge of their circle, creating a triangle between the three of them. The blonde gave a curtsy to Sherlock, turned and winked to John, and crossed her legs suddenly, somehow finding air in the process. Her feet lifted from the ground and returned with a stomp. Her stomach was on full view, a cropped, white tee shirt covering the necessities, and her pants resembled sweats. One diagonal zipper rested on each thigh, and they clung to her ankles and tucked into a pair of black, high top Converse. She was absent of jewelry, a thin streak of black eyeliner her only makeup. The girls fluxed back and forth between the ring and the V arrangement, before finally stopping at the last line, chests heaving, and a smile specific to each girl plastered on their faces. The audience hollered loudly, clapped, and John joined them.
” Sherlock bit out, already on the verge. His body was rosy all over, particularly his neck and across his chest. The brown curls at the nape of his neck and near his ears were wet with sweat.
Sherlock opened the curtain wide enough to reveal an arm, shoulder, bits of an abdomen and one delicious half of the v that rested between the insides of his hip bones. Sweet god.
“I’d say that was a success,” John said as he locked the deadbolt. He wandered back into the living room and planted himself in his chair, propping his feet up on the coffee table. He sighed, licked his lips, and propped an elbow on the armrest, sinking his chin into his palm. John felt Sherlock round the chair and kiss the top of his head.
He shuffled into the living room and fell face first onto the sofa. A couple of napkins littered with water rings clung to the coffee table.
“Cap,” Egan said hesitantly, “Rhys and I were chatting last night, and we… well, we came up with a new play. We don’t have to use it of course, but it’ll help Jasper get familiar with the forwards.” Egan lifted his chin a bit, trying to portray a bit of confidence, and his long, blonde hair shifted around his shoulders, pushed back from his face in a headband. His hazel eyes revealed a small amount of frustration.
He stepped out, feeling Callum’s eyes on his back, and trotted down the stairs. John passed through the glass doors and out into the night, taking a few deep breaths. The shocking cold stifled the heat in his lungs.
“I miss you, baby. I’ll let you know how the game goes tomorrow… Right, of course you’re going to watch it. I’m an idiot... You don’t have to watch. I know you need to work on that new performance Sherlock choreographed for you.”
He stood in front of the glass doors, a moment’s worth of hesitation. He saw the light of the theater pouring out into the lobby from the double doors. John nodded, plucking up courage, and walked inside.
