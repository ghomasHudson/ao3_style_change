“Christ, Sherlock, are you
Mycroft twists his cigarettes in the ashtray to put it out. “I don’t. I’d much rather be left alone, in fact.”
“I don’t know… you look, er… upset.”
“Yes well, I usually pick shorter partners.”
The only thing Sherlock wonders, in the back of his mind, is why John would say I love you if it’s not the truth, which it isn’t. He cares about Sherlock as a friend, he doesn’t
“I definitely agree.”
“You didn’t specify.”
Mary looks down, absently caressing her belly. “He’s not speaking to me.”
He glances down, in case Mary was wrong, because he does not want to see John’s disgust when he hears the final reply. “Yes I do,” Sherlock whispers eventually.
Janine seems to disagree. When he walks her home after their third date, she grabs his face with both hands and pulls him in for a real kiss. It’s not completely repulsive, but not neutral either. Definitely not sweet, unlike the kisses he shared with Irene. The only thing Sherlock can do is kiss back, his eyes closed, reminding himself there’s a purpose, he’s enduring all of this for a purpose – Magnussen.
They sit across from each other at a table in the lab, and Molly takes detailed notes as Sherlock speaks.
John doesn’t ask any further questions that evening, but his mind spins and spins, reliving the last seven years of his life in the light of tonight’s revelation. A lot of things take a different meaning. That’s why the drugs while John was on his honeymoon. That’s why Sherlock left the wedding early. And the thing he said on the tarmac, ‘Sherlock is actually a girl’s name’, John understands now what Sherlock had meant to say instead.
“Oi, Sherlock, are you okay?”
Sherlock hopes he gets to do this again.
“Then I can move on to the funny bits?” he asks.
He can’t see them anymore with the sheet, but the image is still imprinted in his mind. Sherlock’s back, pure ivory, engraved with too many lines of cicatrised skin, some longer, some very tiny. He suspects he hasn’t even seen all of them.
“You don’t actually have to carry her everywhere,” John points out.
At least John is here, Sherlock thinks. John is so warm, and he smells like baby powder, and one of his hands is combing Sherlock’s hair, softly, keeping his head firmly against his shoulder. Sherlock snuggles closer, wrapping his arms around him, wishing he could climb on John completely. John is here. They can heal together.
However, John smirks. “Lumbar pain, hm?” he repeats as he sit down next to Sherlock, watching his flatmate pretend to be completely focused on the screen.
“Your previous flatmate?”
“Go on,” Sherlock prompts him.
Baby steps.
The Woman smirks. “I had some suspicions, but no certainty… now tell me, how did you do it?”
“Mary, it doesn’t matter,” he states firmly and softly at the same time, afraid that a wrong word could make her leave.
“Take off your shoes,” he instructs.
“I think he will.”
“Let’s hope Mrs Hudson doesn’t decide to come in, or we’ll never see the end of those rumours,” he adds, yawning.
A statement that logically means nothing, Sherlock thinks, yet it seems to perfectly depict their situation. The only thing they can do to feel better, they’re doing it. Be together. Sherlock strokes John’s upper arm, slowly, up and down, inhaling the smell his head emanates. He hasn’t held John in such a long time. If he thinks about it, Sherlock can figure that he has never really held John, it was always John doing the holding. He should have done this much sooner, in happier situations.
“Sorry,” John says, repeating the action with less pressure. Sherlock kicks again.
He squirts some ointment on his fingers.
“We’ll be back at 6 and we would love to find both of you alive,” Mary jokes. Both parents kiss their daughter goodbye, and as soon as he hears the door closing, Sherlock realises he’s alone. All the other time he’s been in the same place as Rosie, someone else was there too. Often John and Mary would fall asleep, but they were there anyway, reducing Sherlock’s actual tasks to a mere ‘company keeping’.
“I should hope so,” John whispers, his voice so low that it almost vibrates in the air. He pulls Sherlock down to resume their kiss, without noticing the level of anxiety in the detective is suddenly much higher.
“What the fuck are you doing?!” John yells from behind the shower curtain when he hears the door opening.
Sherlock read between the lines, and since then has made sure to regularly ask Mycroft to babysit. And slowly the Ice Man, the brilliant Mycroft Holmes, grew fond of Rosie Watson.
Sherlock can’t believe he witnessed such an important milestone of her life, and that he’s never felt so proud before. She’s walking, he rationally thinks, everyone walks, that’s a perfectly normal thing to do at her age.
Not knowing what to do exactly, he just goes along in his day as if he was by himself, figuring Rosie would entertain herself if provided with toys.
. He doesn’t know any of it. He truly is as lonely as he seems.
“Thank you,” Sherlock says as Lestrade puts on his coat. “And I apologise for inconveniencing you earlier.”
, his mind repeats, wondering when exactly in the last minutes she stopped being the Woman and started being Irene.
The detective is blending bones, one sleepless night, when John slumps down the stairs and leans against the kitchen door, his eyelids still heavy with slumber.
“You do voices though,” Sherlock said with a knowing smile. The memories are confused and a bit faded, but he remembers Mycroft doing voices for him and Eurus when they were children.
John and Mary arrive punctually after dinner, and this time there are no more excuses. John picks Rosie up from Sherlock’s arms, careful not to wake her, and Sherlock watches them disappear down the stairs.
“Thank you,” he says, and he means it. “And remember, this is top secret. Don’t ever tell anyone what I told you tonight.”
The first sensation of utter surprise is replaced by a feeling of calm, deep relaxation. His body’s producing endorphins again, he thinks, right before his eyes close on their own accord.
“Mary was here,” Sherlock replies carefully.
“It’s okay,” Sherlock whispers, his hands shaking because of his poor health state or perhaps because of sentiment, as he envelops John in a hug. One hand on John’s nape and the other on John’s shoulder, he feels the quiver of his body as he cries. Sherlock rests his cheek against John’s head, wishing he could pull him even closer. He doesn’t dare, for fear that John would run away.
“I have read your medical file,” Mycroft continues, maintaining eye contact. “It says your heart stopped beating at 20:29. They immediately started CPR, and continued for five minutes, before declaring you dead at 20:34. You came back on your own two minutes later, a miracle, one would say. Weren’t you told any of this?”
“Yes, John, do try to keep up, it’s not that difficult.”
“You miss him a lot, don’t you?” Irene asks. “Doctor Watson.”
It’s fine. He’s happy. Being with Sherlock makes him happy. Nothing else matters.
“Yes, you are too apparently.”
They remain like that for a while, snuggled up together. At some point, John’s hand ends up in Sherlock’s hair and combs gently, much to the detective’s surprise. A pleasant surprise, though. The tingling his back, all around his head, following the imaginary path that John is tracing, and Sherlock’s initial resolution not to enjoy this too blatantly gradually fades away under John’s fingertips.
“Molly, I swear it was never my intention to humiliate you, it was—“
“You’re still my best friend… nothing will change that,” John says confidently. “We’re family.”
His own lips form a ‘o’ shape, voicing a faint “Oh.” He understands. She was not actually deducing him, she was talking about herself, and it matches. His feelings are understood by another person in the world, the one that is in this very same room.
“Oh, he’s here,” Molly says, grabbing her purse.
Sherlock tightens his grasp. “It’s a hug. I’m hugging you.”
John leans with a hand against the back of his old chair. “I’ve been an awful friend lately,” he begins, his teeth nervously playing with his lower lip.
Sherlock doesn’t even have the time to express his disinterest in said pictures, that John is already sitting on the bed, right next to him, opening his laptop. Accepting the fact that he is, in fact, going to look at ultrasound pictures, Sherlock sits up, scooting a bit closer to John.
His smile grows wider. “… and she gave me the most beautiful gift I’ll ever receive…”
“I will,” Sherlock replies, his eyes tearing up all over again. “Are you leaving?” he asks then.
He notes down, in his mind, that they have quite a few things in common, since the number of times silence fell between them has been stuck at two for the past hour and a half. The more the conversation goes on, the more he feels engaged by it. It’s not a crime scene. It’s not an experiment. Whatever it is, it is engaging him.
Sherlock can’t help nodding. “Enjoyable.”
Sherlock’s stomach warms up with love just reliving those memories.
“You’re doing fine, John,” Sherlock kindly replies. “You may just be ready to learn the big finale.”
Sherlock has never seen him like this, with his face crimson and obviously hot, his cheeks streaked with tears, his eyes wet and puffy. He takes one step forward, instinctively trying to reach John and pull him back into his embrace, but John stops him.
“Precisely,” Sherlock lies, the expression of his face impassable, the flush on his cheeks the only clue giving away his true intentions.
When he opens his eyes again, Mary isn’t there anymore. But she hasn’t really gone anywhere, has she, he thinks.
A decision has to be made eventually, and Sherlock, who has never confessed his love to anyone before because he’s never been in love before in the first place, decides to put his fate in the hands of someone who has.
“Okay,” is the only thing John can say after a couple of second of deafening silence. “That’s, er… that’s fine.”
“It’s not a date, Sherlock. I’m having dinner with Janine.”
Mycroft’s voice plays in his head at regular intervals. Caring is not an advantage.
“What, now? The game isn’t over.”
,” Sherlock repeats, distinctly pronouncing every letter of the last word so that John’s slower brain can understand it. Sherlock doesn’t need any help, from anyone. It’s not the first time he gets injured during a case, won’t be the last either.
He presses his lips against Sherlock’s mouth again. They go on for what feels like hours, tasting and teasing and exploring, hands combing hair and rubbing backs, and soon what started as a sweet tentative becomes much more heated.
“Mmh… Mary…” John mutters suddenly, tightening his wrap around Sherlock, whose eyes open wide at the words. There’s more, then, than alcohol and cold.
“Oh for God’s sake, sod off!” John barks again, and this time Sherlock does.
Sherlock wonders what that sentence could possibly mean, what the implications could be, not only the selfish wish to avoid a criminal offence, but the other hidden meaning, to be more careful, an advice, a request.
“How long are they keeping you here?”
Sherlock looks up, and they giggle together.
Somehow, at some point along the way, Sherlock had clearly failed in this lifelong intent to remain alone. He ended up connecting with this person, so different from himself and somehow so similar.
John is sitting on the chair next to him, his arms crossed to his chest, his lips pressed together completing the annoyed vibe he clearly emanates.
“See Eurus? This is our family, do you remember?” he asks softly. “This is you,” he adds, tapping with his forefinger the happy little girl on the picture. “This is me.” He snickers because he has his pirate hat on. “This is Mycroft.” He snickers some more at the face of his young big brother who definitely looks like he wasn’t amused by whatever they were doing. “This is Mummy, and this is Dad… do you recognise them? They came here to see you last month.”
Once the bath is over and Janine has gone to work, Sherlock finds his drugs again. They always help. It’s a vicious cycle he can’t break.
Sherlock is busy cataloguing all the things that will be different now that he hasn’t noticed that John is now sitting next to him, whispering all over again how this all is fine and trying to sound convincing in doing so. However, the second John rests his hand over Sherlock’s clenched ones, the detective is brought back to reality, and he finally finds the strength to meet John’s eyes.
“Tomorrow. Sleep.”
“I’m fine,” Sherlock replies. “You have to stay with John. He needs you more than I do.”
Mary looks down for a moment. “Will John be there too?”
“Sherlock! Sherlock, I’m going to stop you here.” John clears his throat nervously. “Look, I’m very flattered that you’ve, er… thought this through… but if there’s one thing I never want to talk about, ever, is my toddler daughter’s future sex life. Okay? But we can take your room, yes.”
“I may not love you the way you want me to, Molly Hooper, but that doesn’t mean my words weren’t true… you’re a precious friend, you’ve always stood by my side all these years… when I said I love you, I wasn’t lying.”
“I’ve always had them. A case took the wrong turn, years ago, before we met. Good night. The light, please,” is the lie Sherlock confidently tells, the same he told Janine, to avoid a discussion he really doesn’t want to have.
“What, why?”
“Because I care.”
“Not even John.”
They’re face to face now, the tip of their noses mere inches apart.
When her kisses get more frenzied, and her hands start wandering, even Sherlock Holmes can deduce what is going to happen. They’re going to have sexual intercourse. For work.
Sherlock missed her. He truly, deeply missed Rosie Watson, and all he wants is to spend some time with her.
Yesterday night, after what happened with Eurus, Greg personally drove John and Sherlock home, to London, to the Watsons’ house since Baker Street is currently not viable. They talked in the car, about the events of the night first, and then about other cases they’ve solved together. They even laughed a couple of times, remembering the most bizarre ones.
Anderson’s snarky, loud remark reaches his ears too, ending his stream of thoughts. Sherlock doesn’t even bother to reply.
“It’s all about the legend, the stories, the adventures… there is a last refuge for the desperate, the unloved, the persecuted, there is a final court of appeal for everyone… when life gets too strange, too impossible, too frightening, there is always one last hope… when all else fails, there are two men sitting arguing in a scruffy flat, like they’ve always been there and they always will, the best and wisest men I have ever known, my Baker Street boys, Sherlock Holmes and Doctor Watson.”
The last thing Sherlock remembers is a brief conversation with two paramedics, before dropping semi-unconscious and very much in pain on the floor of 221B.
“He’s bloody amazing,” Lestrade whispers to John, the volume of his voice low but not low enough to be missed by Sherlock’s ears.
“About my own idiocy… we’ve been, er, quite intimate, with each other, for-for a while, and… well, apparently it was much easier to brush it off with a lame excuse rather than consider… er, consider that… that I should reconsider my… preferences,” John stutters.
Mrs Hudson walks towards him and snakes her arm around his shoulders, pulling him closer until he rests his head on her hip.
“Okay?” John asks softly, taking Sherlock’s now relaxed hands in his own. “Nothing is going to change between us. We’re still friends… we’ll always be. Mh? Okay?”
Sherlock gets lost for a second in his puffy red-rimmed eyes, observing the residual wetness lingering on John’s eyelashes. “You really want to move back?”
Sherlock sits in Molly’s kitchen afterwards, reliving all that happened in the past few hours.
Sherlock nods, appreciating Lestrade’s validation of his fears much more than he could ever express with words.
Before Sherlock can reply, John figures out the answer by himself. “She told you to go for it. Of course.”
“So, I came here to see how my little brother is doing, after eighteen days of hospitalisation, and imagine my surprise when I found him having a playdate with his shooter.”
Sherlock’s eyes go wide at the sight of the small, bendable chess board, as he feels his mind come to life again. If he could actually move, he’d probably be grabbing her head and kissing her forehead right now.
“For everything, Sherlock,
“We’ll do this again, I promise,” Sherlock says, before pressing a kiss on her forehead. It’s a promise he intends to keep.
“Tomorrow?”
Sherlock walks to his bedroom, and John to the bathroom.
“Yes, rules. What does this relationship entail?”
“Well, you know… you saved her life… you admitted you text her… she knows your birthday… I thought, you know, you were… interested.”
“Yes!” is the loud reply.
He just wishes he could crumble and bury his head in John’s chest, smell the scent of his jumpers that reminds him so much of spring mornings at his parent’s house.
“I hope he doesn’t inherit your poor deduction skills, though. No offence but Mary’s are preferable,” he says.
“Yes.”
“You’re family, of course you’re invited.”
“Had she never done that before?” Sherlock asks.
When he thinks John is ready, Sherlock puts on some background music, a playlist he selected on Youtube. He’s composing an original piece for the wedding, but it’s not done yet, and even if it was, he wouldn’t spoil it for the rehearsals.
“I see… I’m glad she’s found someone,” Sherlock says. Although they weren’t in a real relationship, Janine wasn’t a bad girlfriend. She was always nice, though a bit clingy at times, but he learned a lot from the month he spent dating her. One thing above all, that he would actually consider a relationship, with the right person. Well, with John.
The temperature outside is even colder than the previous days, but a newly found strength burns in his chest. He can do this. He can complete this mission, and then go home, and surprise John.
Mycroft doesn’t understand because he doesn’t
As John gets up from his chair to switch sides on the table, Sherlock replays the conversation over and over again in his head, thinking of all the moments in which he could have taken everything back and didn’t. Just because John is still moving back doesn’t mean things will ever be the same between them.
The ringing of Sherlock’s phone startles them awake again some time later, and this time the morning light peeks through the window. He reaches for his phone to answer it, as John rolls away babbling something about his head bursting.
“I don’t know the title or the artist, but I do remember the lyrics, though I was sure I had deleted them.”
It doesn’t take long, really, he just has to put all the factors together and combine it with thorough research.
“She can’t say that,” Sherlock pointed out.
Sherlock tried to resist, tried to keep sentiment out of this all. He tried to keep John at arm’s length, to enjoy his company without actually growing attached to him. John was convenient.
Lestrade spends a couple of hours at 221B, letting Sherlock bounce ideas off him, picking the anecdotes he wants to tell. Then, he helps Sherlock writing a couple of actual paragraphs, although, as he keeps repeating, “John chose you as his best man because he wants to hear your own words.”
He hugs her back, holding tight, a bit troubled by the emotion that is quickly taking over his mind and forming a lump in his throat.
John does, eagerly.
Before he can’t rationalise what he’s doing, his legs are taking him inside, taking a seat at one of the free tables. The hat and scarf he’s wearing cover a good portion of his face as he looks down and scrabbles something on a piece of paper he had in his coat.
, not as a man made of flesh and bones. If anything, Sherlock was straight, as proved by the flirt with Irene Adler. Which allowed John to consider himself straight as well. It was always
Both brothers brush it off, both knowing it’s actually very true.
“Come on, what are you waiting for?”
Gorgeous.
Even when she falls asleep after he’s fed her, he still doesn’t leave her alone. He lays her down in the reclining seat her parents left and keeps it on his legs.
That night Sherlock hopes John is going to invite him into his bed again, since he dislikes sleeping alone.
Sherlock doesn’t have an answer to this. He feels it, that she isn’t dangerous anymore, and he believes spending some time away from Sherrinford might be good for her mental health. He even hopes that soon she’ll recover enough to be transferred to a normal detention facility, one with normal visitation hours and that is possibly reachable with a cab instead of an helicopter.
“Yes, when you were five, now let go of me,” Mycroft repeats. However, his struggles are less strong now, just a steady pressure against Sherlock’s hands on where they’re joined on Mycroft’s left shoulder.
Sherlock has killed Mary, has failed to protect her.
“Thanks… not to argue with your teaching methods, but wouldn’t it be better if I tried with a partner, or I don’t know, some music?”
John, John trusting him and believing in him so deeply he tried to prove him wrong until the very last moment.
“Of course I do, it’s Dancing Queen, by Abba.”
The slightest flinch of Sherlock’s hand on his shoulder makes John finally remove his hand from his eyes to glance at his friend, realising his words didn’t sound nice at all. Sherlock is just trying to help.
“We’ll finish it later. I’m winning anyway. Come on, up!”
“Close to Baker Street, five minutes’ walk towards Regent’s Park.”
“Mary told me you believed I had feelings for Irene,” Sherlock replies, watching John’s expression go from curious to startled as he adds a piece of the puzzle.
Sherlock smile happily at those words. The day has definitely been a success under every point of view.
He frowns, his glance traveling from her to the album. “What did you say?”
Feeling they were approaching uncharted territory, Mary carefully weights her words, afraid to scare Sherlock away. “I mean… I know you’re not straight,” she says, softly, sounding as understanding as she possibly can.
John brushes a hand through his own hair. “Er, no… I suppose not. You can hang out with whoever you like,” he says, immediately realising how weird that sounded. “Just be careful… don’t trust her. She probably has an agenda.”
After watching Mary’s DVD, he realises Mary wants Sherlock to help John too, and the least he can do is follow her instructions.
The only thing she does this time is to glance at their joined hands, and somehow it is enough for him to finally understand.
Mycroft takes a deep breath trying not to lose his calm. “She is a murderer. A psychopath.”
The sound of the door opening and closing, followed by a series of confident steps, makes Molly smile and Sherlock’s heartbeat accelerate for some reason.
“You weren’t there before,” John states. “You moved.”
If the pleasure of a frivolous chat was unknown but fairly understandable, this is something else entirely. Is it just human nature, not to want another individual to decease, he wonders, or is it concern. Does John care about him, Sherlock asks himself for a second, and the answer is evident. John’s choice of words. The tone of his voice.
And it’s all gone. And he never really took his time to think about it, or to mourn her as she deserved, he was so busy thinking about John or Culverton Smith or the drugs that somehow he never fully realised it was all over.
They giggle, a couple of times.
The door opens with a click and Mary is standing on the other side.
“I’ll study them tonight,” she says once they’re done.
“What’s wrong? Did I says something…?” John asks softly, his eyebrows furrowed, noticing Sherlock wasn’t responding to the kiss as eagerly as before. “You… you don’t want to have sex?”
Mary quickly complies the unspoken request, leaving the room.
It’s nice, Sherlock thinks, to just be with John like this. He gazes at him, at the sweat covering his forehead, his ruffled hair, the line of his neck, his muscles hidden behind the white t-shirt.
John knocks at the door, interrupting his thoughts. “Sherlock? Are you all right?”
“You’re awake.”
“Yes, thank you for this brief vocabulary lesson, but
Empty. The house is empty, and dark, and silent, except for the sound of a crackling fire coming from the living room. Mycroft is there, sitting in his chair, his legs stretched towards the fireplace. Staring at the flames, he smokes his cigarette, his other hand busy propping up his head.
Sherlock is one step away from the morgue door when she calls him back.
It is what it is, and if they’re together, how bad could it be?
“It’s okay, I’ve got you,” John whispers to his ear, his hands drawing slow, soothing circles on Sherlock’s back, helping him grieve.
“Oh,” he says. He hasn’t seen Janine since that time she visited him at the hospital. “How is she doing?”
She arranges the letters on the Scrabble board to form the word ‘dance’. Sherlock gives her a look that means ‘is this the best you can do?’. Her answer is a look that means ‘shut up, I picked rubbish letters’.
“Desensitised,” Sherlock murmurs, more to himself than for John to hear. “Fascinating.”
Dating Janine is much easier in the beginning, when all he needs to do is play nice and pretend to be interested in whatever she’s saying about herself. Dating women is incredibly dull, he thinks while Janine speaks and he withdraws into his mind palace to perfect the details for his Magnussen plan.
“I calculated it, Sherlock, I swear,” she says, swallowing back a hiccup. “I calculated so that it wouldn’t damage any vital organ.”
“We’ll find someone to watch her for a few hours,” Sherlock says, unable to hide a relieved grin.
“I’m here for you, but I need you to tell me what you need,” he repeats.
“Family.”
“I’ll make you a cup of tea,” she tells him, drying her eyes with her tissue. Then, a second after having pronounced those words, she changes her mind and hugs Sherlock again, ruffling his hair and pulling his head down for a forehead kiss that leaves there the mark of her lipstick.
“She isn’t that person anymore, she’s changed, I know, you’ve said that already,” John hisses. “But what if she isn’t? What if this is all an act to play another sick game with us?”
They stop.
It’s even nicer to imagine that this person is John.
Not even twenty minutes later, a sharp cry interrupts his latest experiment, thus proving he was in fact wrong. Fascinating and alarming at the same time. He immediately reaches the living room, his mind recalling Mary’s words about the causes of Rosie’s cry as he tries to keep calm himself. The baby is wailing desperately, agitating her arms as to grasp for something, her dummy lying on the floor. Sherlock takes a deep breath and goes for a scientific approach, based on the hours of theoretical research in the past days. The lack of faecal odour in the air surrounding Rosie makes him deduce that she does not require a change of nappy, which leaves him with either need for food or attentions.
Among all the pictures there’s one with all five of them, shot in the garden on a nice summer day. The colours aren’t bright anymore, they probably never were, and time has added a layer of sepia to the tones, but Sherlock finds it beautiful.
Then, much to his surprise, Lestrade is back.
“Are we going to sleep in the same bed on a regular basis?”
He can’t even fathom his life without her, and he’s already dreading the moment John will move out taking Rosie with him. It will happen, sooner or later, because of logistics if not because of John meeting another woman. Still, Sherlock sometimes lets himself indulge in dreaming a life where he and John are together, and he himself is the second parent that Rosie deserves.
It’s just a second, though. Sherlock has barely time to blink that he’s facing once again Mycroft’s polite smile, the one he reserves for every occasion. The only smile he’s capable of, really, together with the patronising one he only reserves for his little brother.
“Of course. In case you need backup.”
“Hey,” she greets, almost timidly.
“Why wouldn’t I want to move back?”
Mycroft nods in acknowledgement. “And your first destination is…?”
“So that’s why I changed my mind, because I’ve been the most horrible friend lately, and I wanted to make it up to you… starting from here,” John says. “I know it gets worse in the night, so I’m here tonight if you need to mourn your friend. Not my wife, your friend.”
“I almost drowned in a well tonight, you do the big one.”
“I knew how much she meant to you, and I left you grieving alone anyway.”
A laughter erupts from John’s chest, because this is definitely the least smooth start he’s ever experienced, but then again, this is Sherlock. Of course things would be different.
Sherlock nods to reassure John, but he can’t help thinking that he trusts Mary on some level. She saved his life after all.
“I’m fine. You can go.”
“Well, because… We’d need to baby proof everything… you’d need to actually tidy up after your experiments… be more careful in general… with the, er… the drugs… and things like that,” John explains.
“Where is that?”
“What are you doing?” she says with a smirk. “Come on, wear the hat and go solve a case.”
But then again, he’d never kissed John Watson.
“Yeah, an amazing freak.”
“We could watch a film. A musical comedy,” Sherlock says, pulling out a DVD from the inside pocket of his coat.
Sherlock finally takes off his coat while John grabs his keys and heads to the door.
“Are we going to go on dates?” the detective asks.
He mourns the loss of contact with John’s hand in his hair as the doctor props himself up on his left elbow, using the other hand to spread the collar of his t-shirt until it reveals the small scar on his shoulder.
John’s heart wrenches for him. He reaches with his hand to brush some curls away from Sherlock’s forehead, smiling tenderly when the younger man closes his eyes in surrender.
“You might not have known that I was here, but you did invite me for dinner, didn’t you? Why?”
Sherlock finds himself unable to reply, or hug back, for that matter. His mouth is suddenly dry and his arms are completely limp against his sides. He can’t recall he last time someone hugged him or even tried to, he’s always considered it dull and unpleasant, but his body’s now releasing endorphins, and it’s yet one more information he doesn’t know how to handle.
Once again, Sherlock decides to trust Mary. She saved his life, twice. He has no reason not to trust her.
“And please, don’t tell anyone about… this. I’d rather be remembered as the Dominatrix in London,” she says next.
“What does she want?” John hisses, his jaw suddenly clenched with anger. “How dare she come here and bother you after—“
To John there’s only one explanation that makes sense, only one way in which that introduction might have sounded. Ironically, it’s an explanation that he can’t even begin to process, because if it were true, it would challenge all his beliefs and the very foundation of his friendship with Sherlock.
He tried to text Mycroft too, a couple of times, but then changed his mind. Any contact would potentially reveal his position, and that was the last thing he needed. He needed to complete his mission, dismantle Moriarty’s network, and it was something he had to do alone.
When John and Mary arrive at Baker Street, that evening, they laugh at the sight of Sherlock hunched over his microscope with Rosie sitting on his lap and his legs bouncing up and down to keep her entertained.
“Hey, do you want to see my scar?” John proposes after a few seconds. “It’s only fair.”
“Let’s do one more, shall we?” John proposes. “With the dip at the end.”
“Sex,” Sherlock adds.
Sherlock’s first instinct is to close up, as he always does when someone approaches the subject, which to a more thorough thinking doesn’t happen often and hasn’t happened in a long time. Talking about such a personal topic has never been easy for him, mostly due to the fact that he doesn’t know a lot about it himself.
John’s gaze in unreadable. Sherlock has caught the reference to his own faked death, but John’s general intention is still eluding him.
Things with John don’t go quite as expected. He isn’t delighted to see Sherlock, he’s angry and disappointed, as Sherlock realises quickly during their conversation.
“Please Sherlock, go away… can you do this for me? I need some time,” she whispers.
But the cemetery is silent, Sherlock is the only one there.
“Rosie, this is Uncle Mike,” Sherlock cooed to Rosie’s ear, the day he finally introduced her to his brother, on her first birthday. “Say hi to uncle Mike,” he said, waving his hand and watching Rosie do the same.
Sherlock catches the unspoken rejection - his attempts at improving Mycroft’s mood are far from welcome, but he won’t give up.
“I am
He’s never felt so helpless in his life. He sits in his chair at 221B, in silence, shocked when Mrs Hudson walks upstairs while she was supposed to be on her way to the funeral.
After a while, it’s John who breaks the moment, pulling up and taking Sherlock’s hand in his again, as if nothing had happened.
It’s the answer he was expecting. He never dared hoping for a second that Mycroft would admit having troubles, it has never happened before. Sherlock himself doesn’t quite know how to proceed. With John it was easy, to get up and hold him, but Mycroft is uncharted territory.
“I’m going,” Sherlock says as he heads to the door.
A part of him wants to shut up about it, pretend he never formulated any hypothesis on the fact, but the other part simply craves the truth. His heart is hammering in his chest, his hands are sweaty and cold at the same time, and his mouth is dry as if he hadn’t just finished a cup of tea.
The answer is now evident in front of Sherlock’s concerned eyes.
“No one could fake being such an annoying dick all the time.”
“I, er… I don’t know… there are no rules, we just do us,” is John’s attempt at an answer. The doctor leans forward trying to resume the kiss, but this time Sherlock avoids him.
“What are the rules of this new relationship?” Sherlock asks, forcing himself to appear calm in spite of the situation.
He spends the following couple of hours holding Rosie as he talks to her about the most interesting cases he’s solved, while she slowly falls asleep in his arms, sucking on her dummy, her hands grabbing the buttons of his shirt.
“I’m sorry… please forgive me,” John whispers at last, closing his eyes, Sherlock’s forehead resting against his own.
“Well, can I try?” John asks.
Sherlock frowns, silently asking for an explanation he can’t seem to deduce on his own.
A moment of silence follows. John’s reticence in taking a final decision about his marriage is something Sherlock has a hard time understanding, so he does the only thing he’s proficient in. He deduces.
“I also wanted to see if you needed company,” Sherlock adds tentatively.
John’s eyes widen suddenly as he turns abruptly towards his flatmate. “Wha-what did you say?”
She’s still the best player between them. Sometimes he wishes he could stop playing for a moment, and just listen to her, but he can’t. If he stops, she stops, and the contact is broken, and that’s the last thing he wants.
“How is yours healing, by the way?” John asks once Sherlock removes his hand.
“So are we agreeing we are entering a relationship?”
John sighs, loudly, letting himself fall back on the bed. “Shit,” he whispers, covering his eyes with his hand.
“It was Lestrade, about the case. He requested our presence in person as soon as possible,” Sherlock says after hanging up, glancing at John who is still rubbing his forehead.
He is rewarded with a thankful smile and it’s so much more than he was asking for.
“…A junkie who solves crimes to get high, and the doctor who never came home from the war…”
“It’s called spooning,” John whispered. “Big spoon and little spoon, do you get it now?”
! What kind of doctor are you?!”
Sherlock smiles, just a little, a smile that is almost invisible. John, sweet, sweet John. Sherlock might be good with observations, and ideas, and concepts, but John reads people, he understands them. He understands Sherlock.
? You’re invited too.”
“I would have done the same,” Sherlock adds.
She is his second best alternative to cases. The best is John, of course.
“Thanks,” she whispers. It’s enough to make Sherlock’s heart melt.
“Hi again,” John says, now directed to Sherlock, his voice low enough not to wake his daughter.
Anyway, John didn’t miss anything, Sherlock thinks as he leaves the dullest crime scene he has visited in a long time. He hates it when cases that look like a 8 or 9 turn out to be a 4.
With the back of his fingers, he softly brushes Sherlock’s cheek, the other one, not the one still burning with his kiss, a simple touch that takes Sherlock out of his trance and grounds him back to earth, and to this somehow intimate moment they’re sharing once again, after too long.
“Is he the father?” a young nurse asks Mary, a question that finally makes Sherlock look up from his phone.
“Okay, so posture first,” he illustrates, assuming himself the position briefly so that John can copy it. “Right hand on Mary’s shoulder blade, cupping, like this, look at me… With your left hand you take Mary’s right one, and she’ll have the other one on your shoulder seam.”
Sherlock does, with trembling hands, and John is horrified at what he sees. Three purple bruises are marking Sherlock’s skin, one significantly bigger, the other two a little smaller. John thinks he might hurl. He felt the same when he discovered the scars on Sherlock’s back, but this time, it was he himself who put those there. It was him who hurt Sherlock like that.
Sherlock shrugs. He was in his mind palace, really.
“Go ahead,” he manages to choke out.
He doesn’t ask, and soon John goes back to the other side of the table. Sherlock’s hands feel cold now that they’re not being held anymore.
“No, no… there’s nothing to be sorry about… it’s fine,” John repeats, wondering if he has repeated the word ‘fine’ too many times. “It’s okay… I just need some time.”
“Molly…” he whispers, taking a step closer, wishing he could lay a hand on her shoulder. The creak of his shoes on the smooth floor gives his movements away.
“You utter cock,” John whispers, a barely audible quiver in his voice that makes Sherlock’s eyes wet up.
Kissing a person he cares about and kissing a perfect stranger elicit two distinct reactions. He probably should have considered this before.
Now that he’s given green light, Sherlock mirrors his friend’s expression. “What about Mary?”
John’s hands are firm on his hips. “Sherlock, no. Plus there’s Rosie here, there’s no way I’m letting a serial killer anywhere near my daughter.”
After screaming her lungs out in fear and shock, Mrs Hudson hugs Sherlock too, tightly, her eyes tearing up with delight.
As his breath gets caught is his throat, Sherlock glances at John, afraid for a second that Mary might more or less voluntarily reveal his secret, that she might end up letting John know that Sherlock is in love with him. Sherlock checks John’s face, looking for signs of confusion, or worse, of sudden awareness, but the doctor is probably too busy staring at his dead wife’s face and listening to her voice to actually pay attention to her words. It’s better this way.
When the first match is over, they play again. And then again. Then Mary starts saying that it’s getting late, and she should go home, she has things to do, but Sherlock guilts her into staying.
Now everything is suddenly up for discussion again, and everything is a mess, and John definitely needs time.
Sherlock closes his eyes, lulled by John’s rubs that seem to go on forever. It’s relaxing. It’s warm, the cold of the ointment is quickly balanced by the heat of the friction. So nice, so very nice.
“Fine,” Mycroft says. “But this is a massive liability for the government, so I request the presence of two armed men with you at all times, in case something goes wrong.”
The steps approach his room, and John walks inside, one hand still on the door handle, the other one carrying his laptop.
“Thank you for agreeing on doing this with such a short notice,” John says.
There’s just shame now, and embarrassment, and things will be awkward, assumed John doesn’t leave immediately. Sherlock wishes he could go back five minutes, and deny John’s assumption, and everything would be fine. He has lived forty years without being in love, or in a real relationship, he could have gone without for the next forty as well.
“It’s you and me today, my dear Watson,” he says, more to himself than to the baby.
“It’s about Mary’s video… about what she said to you,” John says, and Sherlock clenches his fists under the table for the tension building in his body as he forces himself to remain calm on the outside. He’s going to deny everything, and any unusual movement could give away the truth.
“This is Rosie… she’s my-John’s, John’s daughter,” he says eventually. “Your niece.”
Sherlock sighs. “If you must.”
Sherlock can clearly hear the exact moment in which John’s voice dies in his throat. He turns around to understand what happened, and he’s met with John’s shocked eyes and slightly ajar mouth.
“Are we getting a dog?” Sherlock asks instead, his breath laboured, his lips swollen.
The recurring dreams start that same night. Every night Sherlock is faster, more clever, and Mary doesn’t get shot. Or she does, but she survives, and then they laugh about it afterwards. In dozens of different ways, every night Sherlock saves her.
“Listen, Molly, I came here because I owe you an apology, for what happened yesterday,” he says.
“Does it bother you that she was here?” Sherlock asks in an attempt to understand his friend’s feelings.
He shrugs. “I’ll miss her more tomorrow.”
He has no idea how she concretely managed to record DVDs and have them sent out post-mortem, but he doesn’t really care. He’ll cherish both of them as his most precious belongings.
He comes to the conclusion that he was wrong. Two is the number of friends he has.
Sherlock shrugs. “I just wanted to let you know that other people are invited... and that Greg is one of them… In case this influences your decision.”
“Good luck Sherlock.”
“Anytime… I’m always around when my friends face their biggest challenges.”
“Trust me, John, she isn’t—“
Sherlock looks up at the ceiling as if it was suddenly interesting. He’s still lying down, the duvet covering him up until his chin, his right arm the only part exposed to the chilly air of the room.
These last two factors in particular contribute to fuelling Sherlock’s doubts. He never felt anything like this before in his life, no other human being ever sparked this kind of interest in him. Back in university, once, he decided he wanted to try and kiss someone, just to experiment the feeling, see what the fuss was all about, deciding to ignore for a while his utter lack of interest towards any activity of that kind. He would have preferred a man, instinctively, but they always avoided him, and the only thing that Sherlock knew about kissing was the requirement of a willing partner. There was, however, this girl in his physics class. He’d caught her staring at him a few times, deduced her interest in him, and he decided she was going to be the one, although he felt absolutely nothing towards her. It sounded like a perfect plan in his head, but the second he pressed his lips against hers, he was overcome with a sense of repulsion. He knew, in that moment, that women were definitely not his area.
Sherlock can distinctly feel his cheeks flush at his best friend’s words, at the sweetness and love he can read in his face, something he hasn’t read there in a long time. He nods. “I believe you mentioned it, yes.”
“Of course I was told,” Sherlock says, clenching his jaw but trying to keep calm at the same time. He was told the moment he woke up from the first surgery. He decided not to share it with anyone, not even with John, there was no reason to furtherly make him worry. But of course,
They straighten up again, but John’s hands haven’t moved from his friend’s back.
When he’s back, he immediately notices something is different. Sherlock isn’t sitting in his chair anymore, he’s on the sofa, legs crossed. He even moved the chairs so that the visual would be better.
Sherlock smiles with a joy he doubted he would ever feel again. Somewhere in his heart, Mary is smiling too. It’s what she wanted, him to make John and Rosie happy.
She laughs, because she obviously knew John would be here to listen, and Sherlock laughs too, with her, because his brain is still wired that way.
It’s finally his penultimate day at the hospital, and they’re playing Monopoly on his lunch tray, when Mycroft comes in unannounced.
Although it is only lit by the streetlight peeking in, it’s a sight that fascinates Sherlock more than he expected.
When the door opens, he finds two familiar green eyes and a mischievous grin staring at him. He swallows, hoping she hasn’t heard.
The only thing Sherlock can do when he meets John’s eyes is shake his head and look down. He hears John take a deep breath, as if filling his lungs would help him get rid of the anger. The frenetic pacing has stopped. Sherlock looks up again when the mattress dips downwards, discovering that John is now sitting next to him.
John has gone out some time ago, and from the keys lying on the kitchen table Sherlock deduces John has also come back home. The detective immediately feels the urge to tell his friend the solution of the case they’d been investigating earlier that day, and without thinking twice about it, he walks upstairs, his steps heavy and loud. He bursts John’s bedroom door open, only to find the doctor sound asleep with his head sunk in the pillow.
Moved by the smell of John’s sweat and his own desire to learn what it is like to sleep in the same bed with his best friend, Sherlock opts for a repetition of his previous offer.
Never, even in his wildest dreams, could Sherlock imagine John would have kissed him eventually, would have chosen him. Because that’s what John has done, he has chosen Sherlock as his partner, in life as well as in work.
“I don’t need to go to the hospital, I’m perfectly fine,” Sherlock remarks, taking off his coat.
Something snaps in John’s mind as he realises how badly he’s been handling this situation. Sherlock, his best friend who has probably zero experience with relationships, has just come out to him, and all John could do was to think about his own sexuality. Not an actual word of comfort. And he even said he needs time - John’s heart wrenches in his chest at the idea that Sherlock might have interpreted that as ‘I need time to accept you’.
It was worth a try, Sherlock thinks, pouting. He falls asleep in a matter of minutes.
She invited him to her place.
Just weeks ago, he used to be ‘Lo’ and John used to be ‘Da’. Now they’re Lock and Daddy, though Sherlock sometimes reverts to Lo when she’s tired. The only name Rosie has mastered is Molly, while Greg sounds somewhat similar to egg.
“If my getting married hasn’t stopped Mrs Hudson from talking, nothing will,” John jokes. He doesn’t know if it’s the headache, or the cold air of the room, or the typical late November fog that is visible from his window, but John feels extremely cosy, and he can’t deny Sherlock’s close presence is a contributing factor.
A couple of minutes later, while Sherlock hasn’t moved a millimetre, John comes back and switches on the light on the nightstand to plug in his phone.
Sherlock rolls his eyes. “For God’s sake, John, listen to me! No one will be in danger, Eurus is—“
“221B Baker Street is always open for you,” Sherlock says. “Though I admit having used your room for a fair share of experiments in these past months, so you might want to aerate it a bit before sleeping in it.”
It’s Mary’s voice speaking in his ear. He glances at his right, finding her standing right there.
The ride home is silent, the only sound in the vehicle the taxi radio.
“Now, onto the things I actually wanted to say…” she says next.
Silence falls for a few seconds, until Mary gets up announcing she’s making tea.
“It’s probably the first time I hear those words coming from your mouth,” John laughs. “Anyway, I asked because you forgave her. You’re her friend. I want to know, have you read it?”
Hearing complete silence, John starts to believe his words were effective, for a change. He’s already dozing off again when the duvet gets lifted and a wave of cold air hits him, before being replaced by a warm body.
Sherlock does. He joins John on his chair, sitting half on his lap and half in the tight gap between John’s hip and the chair itself, their arms tangled around each other. It’s vaguely awkward, but neither of them seems to care.
“Mary and I really need a day for ourselves… a Turkish bath, some massages, you know…” John starts, awkwardly standing in the middle of the living room in Baker Street.
When John doesn’t reply, Sherlock grins and rolls on his side. He’s been waiting for a chance to share a bed with John again since the last time that happened. The fact that tonight it is John’s bed they’re sharing makes it even better. The duvet is heavy on his body and the smell of John is everywhere.
Any other occasion, and Sherlock would have joked. “Why, I think I will, I want to see her face,” he would have said.
“Chips?”
“Oh,” is all John can utter, completely taken by surprise. “So she didn’t come here to hurt you, or threaten you, or use you to get to me?”
But he can’t just yet. He needs to focus. He needs to think of the camera phone, of how to hack it, he can’t allow any distraction. He needs his violin.
“As a human being I am genetically wired to care for younger individuals of my own specie. It’s called self-preservation,” Sherlock retorts, lighting his blowtorch and heading back to the kitchen, a scene that makes John giggle sarcastically.
He can’t cry. He can’t breathe.
John snickers lightly. “I’ve never dated anyone taller than me.”
John is the only one to wake up at the sound of Rosie crying through the baby monitor, a few hours later. He attempts the mission of sneaking out of the bed without waking Sherlock, an impossible mission indeed, since the detective is wrapped around him like an octopus around its prey. Every time John tries to get away, Sherlock’s arms tighten around his waist. Eventually Rosie’s cry becomes more urgent, and John accept the fact that he doesn’t have time to be careful, he just has to go.
And as a matter of fact, John opens his arms to his sides and takes a step closer. “Can I- er, do you mind?”
“I know. Are you okay?” Sherlock asks.
“I will. I’ll text Molly too, is that okay?” John asks.
“I forgive you,” Sherlock murmurs. Then, he hugs John again, wrapping his arms around his waist. This time it’s Sherlock who’s hunched over John, resting his chin on his shoulder, while John laces his arms around the detective’s neck, still weeping.
Sherlock watches some telly with Molly after the cake, he sitting in his chair, she in John’s. They’re silent, the only sound in the room is the ones from the television.
“I can’t stay forever, you know that,” she whispers, and a tear rolls down Sherlock’s cheek to the tip of his nose.
“There’s an East Wind coming, Rosamund,” Mycroft whispers to Rosie.
“I’m relieved to see you’re not wearing your birthday suit tonight,” Sherlock says after quickly glancing up and down her body.
Outside the Aquarium, everything is normal. The London Eye is spinning, as usual. Tourists from all over the world are crowding the Queen’s Walk and taking selfie with the House of Parliament in the background. It’s a normal evening in London, but Mary has just died.
“I-I don’t know… I didn’t think about it.”
It means more to him than he can say. “We’re the only ones who can handle him,” he says, feeling the edge of his lips curl up in a smile that mirrors hers.
Sherlock doesn’t understand, it’s hardly anyone’s fault if he can’t sleep. “My mind is set on this experiment now. I can’t just drop it and do something else,” he explains.
Sherlock stands there, on the side of the road, and watches the couple as they share their first kiss as parents, sweet and full of love, before kissing their daughter’s head, cooing adoring words.
Sherlock opens one eye, and then the other, as he hears noises coming from the kitchen, which is highly unusual at this time of night. It must be past 1 am, both John and Mrs Hudson should be fast asleep.
“I find chips a nice indulgence for when I’m miserable.”
“Don’t stand here, go get your hug,” she continues with a cheeky smile. Playfully pinching his butt, she winks at him, like she used to do all the time, and that’s the last he can bear. If she were here for real, that’s exactly what she would have said, and done, and he can’t believe she’s gone forever.
“I wasn’t.”
“Are you sure?” Mary asks.
And at least Sherlock has had the chance to hear John laugh one last time.
For some reason, everyone laughs at his statement.
Also, further confirmation acquired on the fact that Sherlock definitely cares about John. Now 100% a proven fact.
Sherlock blinks again, following John with his eyes as he disappears downstairs, probably to retrieve some instant ice from Mrs Hudson.
He stops halfway to the door, remembering there was one more thing he wanted to tell her, something that is now more relevant than ever.
“That what?”
His last day as a living man still haunts his dreams.
“Everything you need is in the bag, nappies, milk, toys,” Mary explains. “If she cries, she probably needs food, or a change, or attentions.”
John’s outside already, calling a cab. Sherlock’s putting on his coat.
No matter how hard he tries to forget it, Sherlock quickly finds out that affection is a tough enemy, one that sticks along for a long time.
“Oh, you bastard!” Lestrade says, before hugging Sherlock, thus throwing him completely off guard. He definitely wasn’t expecting to be hugged by Lestrade, but after a couple of seconds of bafflement, Sherlock hugs back.
Well-deserved hate.
Wiggins finds Sherlock on the sofa, curled up on himself, his own hand in his hair, murmuring apologies to the air.
But here, and now, his mind is too clouded with love and the only thing he manages to do is nod. “I won’t.”
“You should be paying your last respects to Mary,” he replies, his hands joined under his chin.
He’ll cherish it.
John is right.
At first Sherlock thinks it might be enough, living without John, but he changes his mind as time goes by. After a case with Molly, he gets himself some chips, hoping carbs would help filling the void John left. Irene would be proud.
The last birthday Sherlock celebrated, with cake and presents, it was when he turned eighteen, because his parents insisted. After that he categorically refused to organise or take part in any kind of celebration.
John agrees to let Sherlock babysit Rosie the whole day, since it’s not like Sherlock’s ever alone. First, Mrs Hudson stays with him in the morning, prepares him a light lunch and offers an uncountable number of cups of tea. She goes back downstairs to her chores when Molly arrives in the afternoon.
Sherlock fights his instinct to reach for John once more, and just lowers his head, glancing at his feet. “You were upset. You needed to blow off some steam. It’s okay.”
Sherlock is still standing in the middle of the living room, cataloguing this new experience in his mind palace. Hugging John is a pleasant experience. Might want to repeat.
Needing to understand the severity of it, he lays his thumbs against the top of Sherlock’s foot, and the detective’s leg automatically jerks up almost kicking John in the face.
“Sherlock, what are you implying?!”
Sherlock’s eyes open wide as he nods. He’s always wanted to see that scar up close, but never had the occasion to, and never dared ask.
Sherlock blinks, his heart wrenching at the guilt in Mycroft’s word and filling with a sense of achievement at the same time. This is it, this is the core of the problem, Sherlock thinks. This is why he came here. They’re getting there.
The second Sherlock’s eyes meet John, he understands what this is about, and his heart sinks to his stomach. His hand trembles slightly as he closes his laptop, watching John do the same and waiting for the dreaded question.
He walks away, his mind focusing again on John. He knows what he needs to do.
That’s all she says, her somewhat harsh tone giving away her true feelings beneath the apparent calm.
He places the baby monitor on the nightstand before stripping down to his underwear and t-shirt, under Sherlock’s observant gaze. There’s no embarrassment, on either side, everything happens so automatically that one would think it is nothing but routine. The way John sneaks under the duvet, next to Sherlock, glancing at him and whispering a soft “come here”. The way Sherlock, after pulling his shirt down, shifts closer to John until they’re only inches apart, staring at each other for a second that feels like much longer, grey-blue eyes in dark green ones, two bare souls in a miserable moment of their lives. The way Sherlock’s head finds its perfect spot on John’s chest as he feels John’s arm pull him closer.
“If there’s anything you need to discuss please call Anthea to make an appointment. I’ll be regularly in my office tomorrow,” Mycroft is saying when Sherlock walks closer, his hands sweating.
He finally finds the strength to turn his head and face her. “Why would I tell you?”
From that evening, an unspoken code is created between the two of them. Chair means leave me alone. Sofa means please join me.
“Eurus, what do you need?” he asks softly. He hasn’t spoken actual words to her since they rescued John from the well.
His voice trails off in the end until it abandons him completely, and his body is again shaken by sighs and hiccups. You’re so good to me, he wanted to say before finding himself completely unable to.
John scoots a little closer as he lays on his side, his head propped up on his elbow. He doesn’t even turn on the light, he doesn’t need to, he just lets his gaze travel along Sherlock’s back, following the line of his spine, counting the scars he can spot without a real purpose. He makes some deductions of his own, given by years of expertise in the medical field. He can tell the scars have healed properly, and that their position and angulation implies they were not self-inflicted. Sherlock was victim of violence.
“Is this okay?” John asks tentatively.
He’s still pretty much bed ridden, the only thing he can do is text John – without receiving reply, because he’s working – or stare outside the window. Lestrade has texted him a couple of cases that didn’t require his physical presence on the crime scene, but Sherlock solved them in under two minutes. A third case seemed much more intriguing, before Sherlock found out that Lestrade made it up completely just to keep him entertained. He appreciated it. Molly has called him a few times, describing her lab work to him in an attempt to distract him from the hospital room, but it only made him miss his experiments more. Yesterday, Mrs Hudson tried to sneak in his violin before a nurse pointed out it was against the rules, to have a patient play a musical instrument in the hospital.
Sherlock texts Janine, sets a date and then another, with the purpose of tricking her into trusting him, so that walking into Magnussen’s office would be a piece of cake.
“I miss her,” is all Sherlock can say, because his throat hurts as if he had a knife through it.
After the wedding, John will look for Sherlock to dance together once more, but Sherlock will never know. He will be home, alone, in an empty flat, busy moving John’s chair far away where he can’t see it.
They order a pizza at some point, and spend the rest of the evening, and the night, talking, telling each other stories of the years spent on the run. He trusts her. He could never trust the Woman, but he feels he can trust Irene. He can’t believe he found another friend in such an unexpected place and time of his life.
However, Sherlock also came to the conclusion that what he feels doesn’t really matter. John doesn’t want to be romantically involved with him, he made that clear several times. To use John’s own words, John isn’t
When he’s feeling better, the following week, Mary helps him take the short recommended walks around the hallways of the hospital.
John loves him?
New fact: Sherlock likes carrying around this tiny human.
For a second, Sherlock believes the tiniest hint of a smile has crooked his brother’s lips.
“I don’t understand how I deleted major scientific facts but somehow managed to keep song lyrics.”
“What kind of thoughts?”
“Right, because you’re Sherlock Holmes and you don’t need human contact,” John says, trying not to make fun of his friend. Too much.
. The first time John watched it, he missed the meaning behind those first words, too shocked for them to register in his brain. Now however, they stick like glue. Then the final part,
“At this age she needs to learn how to be alone too, if you always pick her up she’ll never learn to calm herself down,” Mary adds.
He freezes.
“Yes?”
“John should be here soon, we want to surprise him,” Molly says. “Don’t we, Rosie? We want daddy to see how good you are.”
Sherlock remembers it too. It’s all right there, in a room in his mind palace, a room he’d carefully locked in the past weeks in order to focus completely on John.
He always brings his violin along, because Eurus doesn’t speak anymore, and the only way they can communicate is through music. So they do, they play in unison, Bach or Mozart or Vivaldi or whatever they are feeling, and they keep playing until their arms are cramping.
“No. She’s just a friend,” Sherlock replies quickly, his mind immediately going back to the main topic. “Don’t tell John.”
“Oh, that’s what this is,” Mycroft interrupts. “
A mission that was supposed to last six to eight months has so far had the duration of one year, six months, and twenty-two days, and it’s not nearly over yet.
“So it is true then? That I…” she stops and look down, unable to pronounce the missing words. “That I, actually… that I… killed you?”
“Ointment. I noticed you’re in pain, earlier today, so I bought this… it should help,” John replies, sitting on the edge of the bed. “Show me where it hurts,” he instructs carefully.
She still doesn’t say a word. He still hasn’t looked up. A part of him is already regretting this.
a family.”
John follows him to his bedroom, just a few minutes later.
He lets her. He respects her enough to know she’s right, after all.
“So, where were we? If I remember correctly, I’d just bought--” Sherlock’s voice dies in his throat as his eyes meet her face. She’s pale, very much so, her eyes glistening with unshed tears.
“How did you…?”
Then, unprompted, Sherlock tells Irene how he plans to surprise Mrs Hudson, just walking into Baker Street and hoping she won’t have a heart attack. For Molly he thinks of something more subtle, like waiting for her in her lab hidden in silence until she notices him. Graham then, he always parks his car in that dark sinister underground car park, Sherlock could just hide there and suddenly walk out the shadow. He really can’t resist a touch of dramatic. And Mycroft… well, Mycroft will know when Sherlock is back in London.
Mary nods in acknowledgement. “I’ve always had my suspicions.”
“Sherlock, wait.”
He holds her, like he did that night, he holds her whispering to her ear that everything is okay, that he’s there for her.
“… Will you listen to me, who you really are doesn’t matter…”
“Come on,” John says, reading his mind. “You hate babysitting, and plus you can barely take care of yourself.”
“Everyone wanted to dance with you… John, Mrs Hudson…”
“What other choice do I have anyway?” Mycroft says, resigned, glancing down for a moment. Then, he sighs. “I’ll leave you to your playdate, then.”
Mycroft would laugh at him, being so weak, driven by emotion.
at Baker Street, as if she was an old friend!”
Neither of them moves away for a full two seconds, Sherlock’s eyes shifting continuously from John’s deep, adoring gaze to his sweet smile, his senses inebriated by John’s smell, cologne, hospital, a hint of Mary’s perfume, and now a tiny bit of sweat that makes it all more real.
John and Mary exchange startled looks.
“I was wondering if you had a couple of hours free tonight,” Sherlock says, earning himself a puzzled glance.
“I do. Do you?”
Sherlock knew caring was a massive liability, Mycroft has warned him so many times.
“She almost killed my brother, that makes it my business.”
A moment of silence follows.
Eventually, faced with the possibility of having to endure an actual medical visit, Sherlock gives up.
“Leave it a couple of minutes, let it absorb,” John whispers as he lifts his hand off Sherlock’s abdomen, leaving the detective with a strange sensation of cold and loneliness. Opening his eyes, Sherlock watches John head for the bathroom while desperately wanting him to continue, the slimy patch on his belly exposed to the chilly air of the night. Sherlock can’t help imagining what would feel like if he could touch John too, everywhere, to make him feel as good as John did right now.
Each with their own stream of thoughts, they fall asleep.
“Norbury? What is that?” John asks, a question that both Sherlock and Mrs Hudson ignore.
They’ve almost reached Lestrade’s car when they bump into a woman, same age as Lestrade, probably an old friend of his. As the two briefly exchange small talk, Sherlock rolls his eyes. Nothing duller than acquaintances.
How does Mycroft fail to grasp a concept as simple as the advantages of caring?
When the baby is out completely, John promptly grabs a towel from the bag and cleans the baby’s nose and mouth, until a loud cry fills the air.  John laughs, steaming off all the tension he’s been building, letting himself be swept away by the pure joy of the moment. Tears are spilling from Mary’s eyes, but it’s not just pain anymore. She unbuttons the top buttons of her dress, and holds her crying baby close to the bare skin of her chest.
Involuntarily, he has given away his deepest secret.
“Sounds interesting.”
A sense of gratefulness and just pure love settles into the detective’s stomach. Sweet, sweet John, so sweet that Sherlock thinks for a moment that sharing the truth with him wouldn’t be a such a terrible idea.
“Where are we sleeping?” Sherlock asks. “Upstairs or downstairs?”
With the board lying on his lap, they play. Mary is a remarkable opponent, unlike John. The last time he played with John the game lasted three minutes, while playing with Mary is almost like playing with Mycroft, just ten times more fun.
“Good afternoon, brother mine… Mrs Watson,” he greets politely.
Sherlock nods. “I am your best man, I couldn’t let you embarrass yourself at your own wedding.”
“What?” Sherlock asks.
He remembers how much he loved playing stupid board games with her, dancing with her, talking to her, how much fun they would always have together. He remembers the smell of her perfume, and her smile, and her laugher, the way it never
He’s never actively wanted to kiss anyone before. He blinks again.
It’s the first thing Sherlock notices, the moment Mary steps into the lounge of 221B, that something is different. Her hair is styled properly, her clothes are a bit smarter than what is usual for her, the black eyeliner more marked.
Sherlock is there when the baby is born. He takes the bag with Mary’s supplies from the boot, he lets her squeeze his hand so hard that it actually hurts, all of this while John is kneeled on the road in front of the open car door, between Mary’s spread legs, trying to deliver his own daughter although he was never really trained nor prepared for this.
It takes two seconds before John speaks. “I’ve… I’ve just watched the video again, and there is something I want to ask you, but I need you to promise me you’ll be honest… can you do that? For me? Hm?”
Once Greg and Molly have left, and while John helps Mrs Hudson with the dishes, Sherlock and Mycroft put Rosie to bed together.
“Why did you change your mind about coming here?” he asks.
“You want to achieve sleep and you believe this room offers a more ideal condition to do so, whereas your own room doesn’t. Therefore it is only logical that you consider spending the night here.”
He rubs it delicately, tracing its contours, cataloguing its texture. Definitely fascinating.
“Hm?”
“No. Sleep.”
That is when her lips form a shape he’s never seen before, not on her. A smile, yes, but not her usual flirtatious smirk. Sadness. A sad smile.
Next, John lays back down and checks the time on his phone, saying something about his alarm being in less than five hours. Both close their eyes. Sherlock falls asleep unusually quickly.
He blinks back tears, and locks himself in his room in the sole company of his secret stash.
“That’s a job for a bridesmaid.”
In the following hours, and days, Sherlock suppresses his own pain to think of John. John that has just lost his wife, and John that won’t talk to him. Sherlock needs to get John to talk, he needs to help John. Sherlock calls, and calls, and calls. No answer.
Whom to expect: pretty much everyone.
“Mary’s not as tall and heavy as I am, it will be easier with her,” Sherlock says, as he tries to shift a bit downwards to meet John’s face. “But yes, the position is correct.”
And he does know. He knows he can count on people, on his friends. He thinks he needs to have a talk with Mycroft, one day, talk to him about this recent discovery of his – the advantages of caring. Not that Mycroft would understand.
“Can we talk?” John asks, continuously licking his lips without even realising it.
Mary appears on the other side of the bed, her head propped up on her elbow.
“I must say, it was a pleasant surprise to find out you’re alive,” she says, her hands lingering on him way more than necessary. His own hands start sweating, but he doesn’t let it show, even as he begins to wonder why exactly he thought meeting the Woman would be a good idea.
“I am.”
Sherlock’s going to jump in the car at the airport when Mary taps his back. As he turns around, she immediately wraps her arms around him.
He finally sees her face as he turns around, her eyes are glistening with tears but a little smile is lighting up her face.
“What finale?” John asks.
“So you are… er, gay, in fact?” John asks next, clearing his throat more frequently than necessary.
John laughs at that definition, and Sherlock tells him about their meeting in Russia, although he’d promised her not to disclose it.
Plus, Mycroft would be so disappointed if he knew.
John smiles tenderly at the sight, resisting the urge to peck Sherlock’s cheek, too afraid to wake him up.
“Very well, John,” he says. “You’re quick at mastering the art of waltz.”
“Come on, tell me how you did it, how you solved the case. You were dying to last night,” John adds. “Greg can wait five more minutes.”
Once the detective made sure John’s in the correct position, the actual lesson starts. First, the box, then the counts. Sherlock remains on John’s side but a step in front of him, so that John can watch what he’s doing and mimic it. Sherlock counts aloud at first, slowly, punctuating each time so that John properly associates it with a step.
Sherlock looks down. He never meant to disappoint anyone that day, he just couldn’t take it anymore, giving John away like that. He couldn’t stay and dance happily with his friends, pretending everything was fine when in fact he was in so much pain he could barely breathe.
Sherlock doesn’t say anything and Mycroft starts struggling again in a vain attempt to wiggle out of this unwanted embrace. “Sherlock, let me go,” he says, but Sherlock just smiles. He’s reminded of a happier time, when they were children. Five-year-old Sherlock would appear in Mycroft’s room and interrupt his studies jumping onto his lap. Mycroft would always try to push him away at first, but Sherlock was stubborn enough to win his space on his big brother’s lap every time.
A couple of minutes pass, the fire keeps crackling in the background. Soon enough Sherlock releases Mycroft from his embrace.
Sherlock is fidgeting on his phone, repeatedly texting John how bored he is, when someone knocks at the door of his hospital room, completely taking him by surprise. He’s not expecting anyone.
“Of course,” John whispers.
Lestrade reads through it quickly. “Sherlock, this is an eulogy,” he points out just a couple of seconds later.
He’s surprised when he doesn’t see any trace of disgust there.
The sobs are over, John’s tears are silent now as he takes one big step towards Sherlock. “Look at me,” he orders, and Sherlock does, meeting again John’s green, red-rimmed eyes.
“Hi Rosie,” he says, beaming as he finally gets to pick her up. He holds her close and so tight that he’s almost afraid to be hurting her. “Do you remember me?”
John smiles fondly. “Let me lay her down, then we can talk.”
“Just for the record, I know you’re lying,” comes John’s flat voice after a minute. “I’ve seen your back before, and those scars weren’t there… but it’s okay if you don’t want to talk about it. I respect that.”
He grins, looking at her in disbelief. “Yes Eurus, family. This is our family.”
“You can sleep here,” Sherlock blurts out before he can stop himself.
Now, Sherlock sips his tea in a kitchen that is not his own, thinking of all the people in his life he won’t be seeing for a while, and thus facing the ultimate truth. If he hadn’t been forced to fake his own death, he would have never done so, not in a million years, because now spending months away from London, away from everyone, away from John, sounds more like a nightmare than a holiday.
When she’s gone back to sleep, he puts her down on the bed, inside the nestle of pillows, and lays down next to her, watching her sleep and brushing away some curls from her forehead. Her hair is so thin and soft that it feels like a feather to his hand.
“I’m sorry,” he whispers, softly, barely audible.
As Sherlock follows her with his eyes into the kitchen, he can only think of what just happened. He has opened up to another person, he has showed her the most intimate, private part of his heart, one that so far had always remained a secret for the world.
The lump in Sherlock’s throat is so tight that he can’t speak. He just nods, still unable to look up, remembering how different he felt when he came out to Mary. That instance was liberating. She was nice, and friendly, and they laughed and joked afterwards.
“Stay out of this, it’s none of your business,” he replies calmly. He isn’t worried Mycroft might talk, though. If he had wanted to, he would have done so weeks ago.
He can see it all in his head now. He can see the joy in John’s eyes as he sees Sherlock isn’t dead. John’s probably going to laugh, shaking his head. “You cock!” John is going to exclaim, before throwing his arms around Sherlock and squeezing him so hard that Sherlock forgets he’s ever been away from home.
“Okay, Rosie, are you hungry?” he asks. Although he’s sure she hasn’t actually understood the question, the sound of his voice seems to have calmed her down a bit, an indication that favours the need for attention hypothesis.
Sherlock can’t deny how bittersweet the whole situation is. It’s the first contact he has with John since he came back to London. He never even got the hug he’d dreamed of. His only hope was the stag night, last weekend – being known for toning down people’s inhibitions, Sherlock counted on alcohol to get John to embrace him. It didn’t happen. He got a knee touch, if he recalls correctly, his own memories are a bit clouded.
“Sherlock.”
That person is Mary. She was married to John. She has confessed her love to John. She was also Sherlock’s friend, and she told him she wanted him and John to be together if she were ever to be out of the picture. And then, in her video, she urged Sherlock to trust her and go for it. He wonders if it was all made on purpose, those sentences in her video, so that John would understand and initiate the discussion, because Mary knew Sherlock would have taken ages to do so himself.
“We almost died in there,” John says. Something very odd happened tonight, beside him risking his life. He’s seen something in Sherlock, the way he reacted, the way he behaved, there was something human there.
“Except she did, didn’t she?”
Still, he finds himself kneeling down in front of her grave, grazing at the golden letters engraved in the stone.
It’s something he keeps reminding himself every time he sees her, as the dreadful awareness of what is about to come makes him flinch.
At that, John finds himself completely speechless and drops the argument
, his mind repeats.
“Yes, well… Sometimes love isn’t enough.”
“I think it’s a good compromise,” Mrs Hudson says, approaching them. “Personally I would love to meet your sister, Sherlock,” she adds, her hand rubbing his upper arm.
Towards the end of what is already written, he reads something he doesn’t quite like. “Why did you write that?”
,” John’s voice on the phone sounds slightly distressed.
John relaxes a little, his lips curling up in a lopsided smile. “Yes I did... I’m sorry it took so long… I-I wasn’t ready.”
“Yes.”
“I don’t need time from you… I need time for me… to figure out a couple of things,” John simply replies, but it’s not nearly enough for Sherlock. The barest hint of hope has made its way into his heart. He blinks.
“Don’t tell Mary you had the first dance,” John whispers.
She winks at this point, and Sherlock feels his own heart swell in his chest while an uncontrolled smile appears on his face. He misses her so much.
“I’m okay, thanks.”
“Come on, Rosie,” Sherlock whispers as he follows Molly’s order. “Let’s go say hi to daddy.”
Sherlock caught the hint of smile that appeared on his brother’s lips the second Rosie started laughing.
He’s afraid for himself, and for John. He needs to protect his friend, all his friends. Mrs Hudson. Even Lestrade, even if he’ll be the one who arrests him.
He gave Sherlock a vitamin C supplement.
They sit down next to each other on her sofa. He sits straight, his hands joined in his lap, resisting the urge to fidget, while he can see on the corner of his eye that her pose is way more welcoming. She’s facing him, one knee on the sofa, her head leaning or her hand.
Sherlock takes a taxi to John’s house, one last chance to spare himself the troubles of hell, one last chance to see John and talk to him. He only finds Molly instead, and Rosie, beautiful little Rosie who will never really get to know her amazing mother because of Sherlock. Molly blames him too, he can read it in her face, and if Molly blames him then there’s no doubt. Sherlock killed Mary.
But John shakes his head. “It’s not that… not limited to that, anyway. That’s just the tip of the iceberg.”
Sherlock’s bright eyes quickly jump from a word to the other, reliving their latest case through the eyes of his personal blogger. And only friend.
“Come here.”
Later that night, he ponders on it again, and realises that sacrifices will have to be made in order to achieve the final goal, Magnussen. If he wants Janine to keep dating him for as long as he needs, he will have to meet all the basic requirements that a man his age is expected to meet during the dating process.
In the meantime, he’s staying with John, which is far from being a bad solution after all.
“Wow, this is… this is the first time she does that, isn’t it?” the inspector asks as reality sinks down on him.
John giggles, softly, through his nose, but it’s enough to make Sherlock smile.
And he truly does, because this changes everything. He thinks of all the sweet words he told Sherlock, the hugs, the light kisses, the cuddles, even, the night spent in the same bed, nothing that a straight man normally does with another man, John knows that. Yet, when no one could see, he let himself engage in such behaviour with Sherlock because Sherlock didn’t care about cultural conventions. Sherlock was asexual, or not interested, married to his work, and John could see him as
His voice cracks slightly at the end, but it’s enough for Sherlock to pick it up and allow it go straight to his heart. Moments like this are rare between them, they prefer to let their affection for one another go unspoken through looks and gestures. But now John’s lying on top of his bare chest, opening up his heart, without barriers, and Sherlock can only think of how much he loves this amazing man and how much he wishes things were different between them. For a second, he imagines a life where the weight of John’s head on his chest is a sensation he’s grown accustomed to, and the smell of John’s unwashed hair is so familiar that he could recreate it in a lab.
She joins her hands on his back. “It’s a privilege,” is all she says.
At those words, Mycroft promptly took the stuffed dog from Rosie’s tiny hands. “Hello Rosamund, I am Mr Doggy. How do you do?” he said with a nasal voice down one tone from his usual one, moving the toy towards Rosie’s nose.
“I could never,” he whispers, knowing that it is nothing but the truth.
“What about it?” Sherlock asks, his voice flat and even, his nails digging so hard in his own palms that it hurts.
about it.”
Mycroft rolls his eyes. “You know I detest musical comedies.”
“Sherlock, what?” he whispers.
The entire world stops and ceases existing, the only thing that Sherlock’s mind can register is the contact with John’s lips, his warmth and his taste of Chai tea. It’s too much and not enough at the same time, and over way too quickly. John pulls back after just two seconds, leaving Sherlock wide-eyed and flushed, his mouth agape, his heart beating so hard that he can feel it in his ears.
Sherlock has grown fond of John. Sherlock would suffer if something should happen to John. Their lives were now tied together.
He just can’t help smirking. Mary’s laughter never fails to amuse him.
John helps Sherlock solve crimes. Not that John’s contributions are ever crucial, but having a second opinion has revealed to be stimulating, if not useful.
“I’m sorry,” Sherlock chokes out, his shoulders hunching over a bit more every second. He knows he will have to look up at some point, see the disappointment and rejection in John’s eyes, but he isn’t ready yet.
“What is this? What are you doing?!” Mycroft complains, trying to free himself from the long arms that are wrapped around him.
“I hit you, Sherlock!” John yells, visibly furious with himself. “I hit you so hard you were hospitalised! You were down already, harmless, and I kept… for God’s sake, Sherlock, I
He feels Eurus’s eyes on him and he gives her a little smile before looking at the photo again.
“Good, do you have any? It’s the reason why I called you here in the first place.”
What tortures his brain, what doesn’t give him peace, is John, the way John was ready to sacrifice himself, and then the speed, the promptness with which Sherlock made sure John was safe afterwards. The crippling fear that shook his mind and heart, that John could die. It hit Sherlock out of nowhere, the sudden, unexpected instinct to protect John, to keep him safe.
Sherlock leaves with an excuse as soon as John walks in, right in time to cut the umbilical cord. As he walks out in the chilly air, Sherlock pulls out his phone once again and texts Mycroft.
John makes tea for Sherlock too when he makes it for himself. John chats. John gets takeaway dinner.
He’s about to leave the room when Sherlock calls him back before he can stop himself. “Stay.”
“Lumbar pain my arse,” John mocks. “You could have just asked, you know.”
While in fact, she is the key figure.
But now that Sherlock is gay and very much interested, John doesn’t know what that means. His mental paradigm doesn’t work anymore. He wonders what the intimacy they’ve shared for years actually means. Has John lead Sherlock on? Has John subconsciously wanted to lead Sherlock on? The enjoyment coming from their shared physical space, was that really just platonic? Is there more? Has there ever been?
“Nothing unreasonable you say?! You want Eurus to have
“For Rosie.”
“What is, er… what are those?” John asks, his voice feeble and unperceptively shaky.
He’s still looking around in search for new clues when her hands touch his shoulders. He instinctively flinches, before realising she was only taking his coat.
He, Sherlock Holmes, has a friend. He wonders what Mycroft would say to that.
“You said you want to know how I did it,” he says. He isn’t able to explain it, but suddenly he has the feeling she won’t tell anyone. .
Sherlock is sure his heart is still beating only for scientific reasons, because hearts beat, that’s what hearts do. But if he were to say whether his own heart is beating or not, he would need to assess it, because the revelation behind John’s words is too big to comprehend.
John slowly sips his cup of tea. “What you did today was amazing,” he says.
“Look,” John repeats, beaming as he opens the black and white picture on full screen.
Sherlock kneels down on side of the chair where his brother is sitting, his knees against the wooden floor. It’s mildly uncomfortable but this is where his instinct has taken him.
John does as he’s told, before positioning himself once again. This time, however, his arms are not suspended in mid-air. His right hand is cupping Sherlock’s sharp shoulder blade, his left hand holding the detective’s one.
He has no flowers, nothing, he even feels a little stupid because Mary isn’t there. The remains of her body are, but the actual Mary doesn’t exist anymore.
“The skull.”
He sits down next to her, resting his head on her lap, and she gently strokes his hair.
Sherlock blinks, repeatedly, almost floating, his stomach filled with butterflies. John has kissed him, for real, not on his cheek, not on his forehead, on his lips, a true kiss.
Mary has died and John won’t talk to him.
Whatever makes John happy, Sherlock will do.
It’s not a frequent occasion that the great detective is left speechless, but right now he is. Watching John being so overwhelmed at the sight of his unborn baby makes his heart melt just a bit.
“This is John, do you remember John? You know him,” he whispers, mindlessly tracing the contours of John’s face. It’s been months since Sherlock declared his love to him and nothing has changed, for better nor for worse. Sherlock is starting to accept that this silence is John’s way to let him know that the sentiment is unrequited. He’ll be fine with it. As long as John is his best friend and they solve cases together, as long as they live together and cuddle up on the sofa when they feel like it, as long as Sherlock can play with Rosie and read her a bedtime stories, he’ll be fine with not being in a romantic relationship with John.
John does, following Sherlock’s instructions on how to place his hands and feet, he dips the taller man down until, once again, they’re face to face. Or better, face to neck.
“Yes, why not.”
As a matter of fact, Mary smiles. “So do I! Boys can be jerks sometimes, but they’re really cute… I like their arms, you know, nice, strong arms… and the smell, if a man smells good he has twice the chances…”
did.”
Sherlock isn’t aware of the nostalgic smile that has appeared on his face at memory of him and John eating chips in Camden Town, surrounded by young tourists speaking every language of the world. Sherlock would stand still, his gloved hands in his pockets, peering at every single person who would bump into him while walking. John would chat, make comments about some of those people, trying to guess aloud where they were from, interrupting himself from time to time to comment on how delicious the chips were.
He stores this information in his mind palace too.
“Will you be back tomorrow?” he asks when he realises it really is time for her to go home.
“I’m sure he misses you too,” she says rubbing his upper arm for comfort. Funny how a gesture that just an hour ago would have had him jump away in fear now warms his heart instead.
kick a lot?
Now that the danger is gone and his heartbeat is slowing down, he thinks it’s almost nice, to hold someone like this, surrounded by warm water. It’s a level of intimacy he’s never experienced before, never thought he would want to.
, and she didn’t--“
He shakes his head.
“Yes, and you should…” Sherlock starts, his finger drawing a circle in front of his own face, “freshen up a bit.”
“Cuddle me.”
“I’m counting on it.” And he truly does. He will keep her personalised ringtone, so that every time he hears it he will have the confirmation that she’s doing fine.
“Still your doctor,” John replies, making Sherlock smile at the memories. John instructs Sherlock to further lift his shirt, until it’s rolled under his armpits. “It might be a bit cold,” he adds, before laying his hand on Sherlock’s bruised abdomen.
But now John wonders if there’s more, beneath.
This time Sherlock just nods, bracing himself for what is to come, well aware that if the situation isn’t handled correctly, his relationship with John could be ruined forever. No more Baker Street. No more Rosie. No more cases together.
“You know what we need?” John ask. Sherlock is relieved to see that although John’s face still shows the signs of crying, a tiny smile has appeared on it.
He nods as the door closes behind him, Irene waving goodbye until he’s no longer in sight.
“It hurts!” Sherlock complains.
John swallows dry as his doubts are confirmed. Sherlock waits, without finding the courage to look at John, staring instead at his own hands still clenched in his lap, his blood pumping with such force through his veins that he’s afraid his heart is going to burst.
With that, John takes a sit on his old chair, leaving Sherlock some space. The detective stands there, frozen on the spot, unable to speak or move. He’s lost his friend. Mary is dead. It’s like a rope has been tied around his throat, making it harder and harder to breathe every second. He swallows, again and again, but it doesn’t get any better.
He does, explaining Sherlock what he’s expected to write in his speech, to start with some feelings before getting to the anecdotes.
She nods, chewing on another chip. “My favourite was the chippy in Holborn, right behind the tube station.”
He’s leaving the Watsons’ house when Molly steps out once again.
“If it really was a surprise you’re disappointing me, Miss Adler,” he says.
He remembers wondering about this once before. He remembers thinking that what he felt for Sherlock was stronger than his feelings for any other person, ever. But then Sherlock faked his death, and was away for two years, and John met Mary, which reconfirmed his heterosexuality.
He hears the sound of a door cracking open, and regular steps approaching.
“I doubt he’ll want me there.”
“I quite like Saint Petersburg… I might stay here for a while longer. But I’ll have to go eventually, it’s not safe to stay in the same place too long.”
“One day we’ll dance in the living room and I’ll tell you about your mother,” he whispers.
Sherlock catches the self-loathing hidden in John’s remark, but decides not to say anything more. He snuggles closer, until their bodies are fully pressed together. John thinks it would have helped him coping better, in the days after Mary’s death, if he’d had Sherlock next to him providing comfort.
And she’s right.
“Bored.”
However, as his blood keeps rushing south making his cock harder and harder in his pants, some doubts cloud his mind as well. He seizes the occasion to voice them the moment John breaks the kiss to take a breath.
Wrong, screams his mind. Wrong and dangerous.
She turns to the wall to avoid meeting his gaze, covering her eyes with an hand. He stands there, immobile, blinking.
John takes a step back. “Hm?”
“Drink this,” he says, pouring a glass of water and dripping a few drops of an unknown medicine in there.
Sherlock can swear John’s expression has softened in a matter of milliseconds.
She wishes him happy birthday.
“I lost you once, Sherlock, I thought I’d lost you, for two whole years, and then you came back,” John begins, taking Sherlock’s hand in his. “And now in these last seven days I almost bloody lost you twice, again.”
“What’s that?” Sherlock asks, observing the small tube now in John’s hand.
He wonders if this is what normal people do in their spare time, if they chat and giggle with other normal people. Dull, he thinks. But not quite as dull as he thought. Not with this particular man sitting in front of him.
“With my best friend of seven years, I was going to say… but yes, with a man too,” John says, as he softly strokes Sherlock’s cheek and prepares to kiss him again. “We’ll take it slowly.”
An idea suddenly sparks in Sherlock’s mind, Mary’s words reminding him of his most important task.
Two are the variables he modified since the previous experiment: time and person. Since the probability of time having changed his hormonal reaction is minimal, he settles for the second option.
He waits for Janine to roll away from him in her sleep, then he goes to the kitchen, where his drugs always wait for him, his most loyal friend.
As he finishes speaking, he lays down on his side, facing away from John, making sure all of his body is covered and hidden beneath the thin white sheet, protected from his flatmate’s inquisitive, concerned gaze.
Sherlock, being the smart man he is, soon starts wondering about the explanation behind this new behaviour, why he never liked physical contact before and suddenly he not only enjoys it, he actively seeks it.
Sherlock stands up. “As you said yourself, everything went smoothly. Tea?”
John seems to care not only for Sherlock’s health, but also for his overall well-being.
For some reason, so far John thought Mary was
Sherlock nods, the faintest hint of a rosiness spreading across his cheeks. “I like kissing you too. You can… proceed.”
Sherlock doesn’t reply. He just leans over and wraps both his arms around his brother’s shoulders, making him immediately squirm away.
“He is, isn’t he? I keep telling him that,” John agrees.
A part of him thinks he could use a slap more often.
Definitely not revolting. Splendid. Amazing. He catalogues everything, for future reference.
John hasn’t even texted Sherlock since the wedding.
He books an appointment with Ella, John’s former therapist, because he needs to figure out what to do with John, for John. John who is suffering, alone, and won’t talk to Sherlock. However, Ella doesn’t understand this, she thinks Mary’s death is the problem, but John is the problem. John is in much more pain than Sherlock. John doesn’t want to talk to Sherlock, but Sherlock needs him. Sherlock needs his forgiveness, for killing his wife. He quits therapy after that first session.
“She’s not that person anymore. She has changed, believe me,” Sherlock says without addressing John’s remark.
“Good luck, Irene,” he tells her, and he means it. “Thanks for dinner.”
“No, everyone draws the line at something, and this is my point… you put pants on or I’m going back to my room.”
Now, every Sunday that he visits, they start playing their violins, and then at some point she does something to signal her desire to have him inside the cell. Every time he complies, holding her and talking to her. Once he brings with him an old photo album that his parents kept hidden, and he shows it to her, sitting next to her at her desk. It’s full of pictures of their early childhood, and Sherlock still wonders how on earth he could have forgotten about her.
“She cries if I leave her alone,” Sherlock replies without looking up.
“No,” Sherlock says, remarkably calm compared to John. “It’s just my instinct, but you know I’m rarely wrong. Mary and I have bet on that… she thinks it’s a girl, but trust me, it’s a boy.”
“What now?!”
“You won’t believe this mate,” Greg says. Mrs Hudson has a grin as large as her face, and Molly gestures for Sherlock to put Rosie down.
“Yes you were Sherlock, and you know that.”
And yet, there’s more. John cares about him, Sherlock reminds himself from time to time. He’s growing accustomed to the idea, and somehow it’s making it easier to trust John. Which, consequently, is good for work, to have a partner you trust.
He takes the lift and walks to her flat, hesitantly ringing the bell, his heart racing in his chest.
The older man glances at the DVD his brother is holding. “Mamma mia!,” he reads aloud before glancing back at his brother as to ask for further explanation.
Sherlock nods and thanks her again, his mind reminding him once again that his friends, not his intellect, are in fact his greatest asset.
John starts crying, his shoulders hunched over, his face covered by his own hand. Such displays of human emotion used to make Sherlock uncomfortable, so many years ago, but not anymore.
They remain like that, in silence, the only sound in the room their breaths. No more tears wet Sherlock’s chest, just the regular hot puff of breath leaving John’s nose.
With a shy movement she rests her open hand above the recent picture. “Family,” she repeats more firmly.
“What?”
Sherlock immediately walks closer and rests his hand above hers. She wants something, he can sense it, he can read it.
Everything will be all right.
“May I remind you that you shot me? Playing with me is the least you can do.”
Suddenly, the Woman isn’t dangerous anymore at all, she’s exactly what he was looking for. Human contact. It’s right there, in her eyes, this very basic need he was craving like oxygen. She’s been craving it too.
The result of this improvised, short experiment is confirmed. Kissing Irene Adler is not disgusting. He blinks again, repeatedly, his mind jumping here and there, pondering on why two similar experiments could have such a different result.
Although this was mainly about showing family to Eurus, Sherlock figured it would be a good occasion for Mycroft as well, who eventually did join the gathering. Sherlock secretly keeps an eye on his brother, studying his interactions. As foreseen, Mycroft seems to particularly enjoy Lestrade’s company, evidence supported by the ridiculous amount of time the two men spend discussing politics, among other topics. Such a scene makes Sherlock smile fondly – it’s about time his brother found himself a goldfish.
Sherlock stops himself there, wondering how it is possible to see a grown woman’s lips in a minutes-old baby. He knows it is something people say to new parents, that their infant child looks like them although it’s obvious that babies all look alike during the first weeks, but he swears he can see something of Mary in this new born baby. Without realising it, Sherlock strokes with a finger the baby’s arm, as to make sure she actually exists and he’s actually seen her come into the world, and is somehow amazed that his fingertip is basically as big as the palm of her hand.
