"Fuck Cas."
Cas' ass is firm, feels perfect in Dean's hands.
"Good luck jerk." Sam smiles back.
Dean realizes the last truth for today. He never was straight. He always had been bisexual. He tries the words out, loud to the forgiving nature around him.
"Detective Dean Winchester" was neither what he thought a detective should look like. He never wore anything fancy, just jeans, flannel and an army Jacket. The most interesting thing were his super green eyes and his face full of freckles.
Their reunion is quiet, only a few words fall, just hugging after a lifetime away from each other. It's wonderful. Their brotherly bond was, is and always will be one of the purest things ever been seen.
His job was one of the most not adventurous jobs ever invented. Though he loved his job. Oh how he loved working on a desk, handling the computer, typing on the keyboard, taking notes on a notebook and handling the same questions from recurring customers over and over again. He loved everything about it.
"Morning Jack." Dean says with the most not grumpy voice he can manage.
Dean gets up maybe food and a beer will peace his mind a little. He doubts it but it's worth a shot. Getting drunk never really had helped but he did it anyways. And if it was just to silence is head for a little so be it. Sue him.
The gravel voice sends shivers downstairs everytime Dean hears it.
Mary was badly injured and couldn't walk anymore. But she lived, even if it was hard, she lived and she shared with her family what colors the roses in the garden bloomed in.
Sam raises one eyebrow, bitchface still active, then his face softens and he smiles fondly.
"Sammy, it's me. Can we talk?"
I had to use the avengers title here. Don't worry no one turns into dust, this is a happy fic.
Every day was just like the day before. The dull passing of time, the walk down the grey sidewalk, passing by the same boring people. Day after day after day. Nothing out of line. Nothing ever changed.
The clean part was more in his focus than anything else. He couldn't stand any kind of dirt. Not a spider, nor a silverfish, not even a fleck of dust. He always used the same brand of cleaning supplies.
All he could make out was that he was sentenced to get used to a new routine.
Of course he was mourned but it was clear from birth that he wouldn't live long and thanks to Cas, Jimmy and his family had so much time to make it perfect.
As usual Sam plays third wheel and clears his throat.
It's been so long since he saw a pink flower. Years.
Endless love was what it was, Dean never knew how good it could be, he wouldn't change anything besides his last name, hopefully not so far in the future.
-------
"Yes."
"Dad never did."
The kicker was that it wasn't doable with the goal of seeing colors again.  It was tested quite thoroughly.
"Oh Dean, love, please open your eyes and ask me that question again."
--------
Again Dean chuckles. He gently pushes himself all.the way in. Cas moans happily.
Dean chuckles. "You're probably right. I'm telling anyways. So shut up and listen."
Rumors about already rich managers, getting even more rich by exploiting the poor out of their last penny.
A moment later he thinks the clouds have nice shapes. There is one looking like a bear, one that looks like a wolf, a bunny, a dragon (not the real ones, they suck), a moose (oh hello Sammy), a squirrel (there is a universe where it all squirrels, why chuck?) and a bee. Dean's gaze glues to the cloud-bee until the shape is no more. Sad, it's sad that the cloud had to loose that shape. Bees are wonderful animals.
He didn't drink, hasn't done that in ages, doesn't do drugs in general, has a stable and very perfect relationship, so why he would feel off was a huge riddle to him.
Juggling with work, the perfect Boyfriend and his own shortcomings in terms of asking the big one, Dean had a little bit of a hard time.
"Yes! Of course yes! You are the love of my life too. And if anyone is breathtaking or "a killer" it's you."
Wedding plans were made, the perfect date found, decisions were made including which last name should stick.
"Fair enough. You don't judge me?"
For a long time I didn't know where I fit in, who might be my real family. Even though I was never quite alone. But I didn't know!
Then another realization hits him. When was the last time he had a girl? Dean thought hard. Was it the time they caught the "Werepries"? He refused to call these douchebags anything else.
"Cas, let's get up for a moment. I wanna get rid of those distracting clothes."
Full of energy, more than he had have in years, Dean gets back into his beloved Bany.
My Name ist Castiel and I'm an angel of the lord.
Sure, Dean had been mad at Cas for hiding the state of Jack's soul. Hell he had been mad at Cas for many other things. But this last fight, well it crossed a line between them and maybe there was no coming back.
The green eyed one pulled him into the hall, turned him and shoved him against the next wall, cuffed him and basically carried him out of the building into the police car while he was telling him the stuff cops always told.
"Oh God Cas."
Nope, Dean won't explain. The angel would just say something cheesy and hell no. That would ruin the bacon.
Sam smiles towards the kid, gets up and does the most simple thing. He pulls Jack in for a tight fatherly hug.
Cas catches Dean's gaze, as always with the angel it sticks way too long to call it a gaze. By now Dean knows how to interpret every one of Cas' expressions, not that they were obvious. After knowing Cas for eleven years, has it been that long already?, dean knows what every eyebrow raise, every tiny little smile, every blank stare means. The expression on the Angels face shows satisfaction also a plead towards Dean. Dean knows what Cas whishes to see. For once, yeah really once, Dean wishes to respond in the whsihed manner. He wishes to respond in the way he knows is right. So after Sam let go of Jack Dean makes his way over to Jack. For the first time since before Jack lost his soul maybe for the first time ever, Dean lays his arms around Jack and hugs him. He has his kid back.
"It's alright Cas. I forgave you a long time ago. I'm sure Deab did too, right Dean?"
"You never told the story that way Cas."
For once that is not a lie. Dean can see in Cas' eyes that Cas knows it's true.
Over the weeks the news about the dead people got more prominent. The Detectives were topic number one on Twitter and Instagram. They were “trending”, whatever that meant.
-------
Although something changed in the news lately.
He had been ready to kill himself, had been ready to be killed by Death (yes the horseman), even had been ready the one most valuable person in his life in order to been taken far away.
One thing is different though. I remember before I met HIM, I was not able to feel quite the way humans feel, as stated before, I wasn't built to. I couldn't taste like a human. And now? I can feel everything, taste everything. I wanna taste HIM. Just a little bit. If HE let's me.
"Dean Winchester, hello?"
So much had changed in such a short time.
×××××
The woman and the kid became close family friends and Cas and Dean doted on the kid.
"You were 4 months old!"
Even now, years later, nightmares of the bloddy face stalked him. Nightmares of his hand making the face bloddy, nightmares of the blade NOT missing the goal.
For some time he just lay there, eyes closed, kid in his arms, breathing heavy.
To gain back the colors in life one had to do a true act of selflessness.
"Right."
Being in my true form, it is extraordinary.
Rumors of a "pandemic" going through the world, killing a lot of people and leaving the survivers with only the grey.
Cas uses both hands now to explore Dean and his tucking in Dean's flannel, well the buttons, makes it quite obvious that Cas has enough of the clothing. Dean can't argue that, it's  friggin great idea. He moves back to Cas lips.
It makes Cas smile. He opens the correct drawer, “I really appreciate that, Dean.” he says, grabbing his pristinely folded clothes out of the drawer before putting them in his bag. “You don’t want to hear about my family, though.”
Castiel’s
...And then, there’s Cas.
And he’s throwing it away, just like the roses.
“I love you, too,” Castiel says when their lips are so close that Dean can feel the warm air of Cas’ breath tickling his lips, “I thought you knew that.”
Also, this should be read as a high school AU. The original was 217 words and included some 'oooh'ing from the cafeteria.
“Wow,” Cas agrees, finishing the nodding motion from earlier.
“Cool, thanks! Hey Dean, don’t hurt Cas,” Sam teases, poking his tongue out.
Dean visibly shrinks down as though the rejection is
Thousands of miles she’d taken them, along the lonely roads of the American dream.
Dean takes the sketchbook in his hands before Cas can stop him, looking at the ink-dampened pages. It’s then that Cas realizes that he’s got a touch of a height disadvantage. He’d never realized Dean was that much taller.
And Cas heard him, because it’s soft, the most loving and gentle question Dean thinks he’s ever heard. And it does things to his heart.
The calm in his eyes becomes a storm, and he’s up out of his chair, angry before worried, “What the fuck, Dean?”
He blinks once, and then twice at the human using him as a comfort device.
“I’m really sorry,” I started, as I began to try and clean the mess away, “I wasn’t really expecting company.”
But there, too, are the less simple cravings: his fingers fumbling to weave with yours, his breaths hitching, the smallest of sounds escaping his trembling lips, your fingertips against the raised bumps of his skin, the way he breathes your name --- “
He readjusts to face Cas, but Cas doesn’t move. He stays still on his back and Dean can’t help but to roll his eyes, taking Cas’ arm and guiding him onto his side. He doesn’t let go once Cas has readjusted, but rather, slips his hand down into the empty space between Castiel’s fingers. And it’s the most goddamn intimate thing he’s possibly ever done with someone. And yet, it’s not nearly reassuring enough.
Dean Winchester is Dean Winchester.
And at this point, Dean’s half asleep, his eyes falling closed, as Castiel’s hands in his hair reaffirm, ‘
Woodchips flew.
“Aesthetic ass?” Dean asks, raising a brow. But, for once there’s no bite to his words, only a gentle amusement and a beautiful smile to match it.
I began thinking of what Dean’s place might look like. Something tells me messy, with clothes everywhere and maybe some cans and pictures of muscle cars and 80s hair bands.
Dean’s grinning. It’s not a smirk anymore, it’s this dumb little half-grin that makes his eyes light up like the sun’s coming out- but it leaves space for the constellation of freckles spattering his nose and cheeks. Thank god for twilight colours. They look beautiful on him.
“Not at all,” he shakes his head matter-of-factly.
“Someone didn’t have his coffee this morning,” Sam grumbles, “Jerk.”
He pushes his glasses up, squinting at the figure that isn’t quite coming to life in his sketchbook. Still, it’s taken him the better part of two days to really focus on the anatomy and trying to make it move. It would really help, actually, if he liked running at all.
Gone is still gone.
“I…” Cas stumbles, before thinking ‘
The high rips through him.
He never imagined a grin would be plastered on his face after his first pride parade, or that he’d be half painted in hues of magenta, and purple and blue.
He wants to give Cas so much more than ‘nice’.
I take too long thinking about it again, and next thing I know, I’m realizing he’s still holding my hand, because I can feel it as he leans in, nearly whispering in my ear, “So, what do you say? Wanna get out of here?”
Their second kiss lasts longer. Is more. It’s full of time- years waited and lost, years that they try and get back. Love that’s battled uphill over rocks and mud to get to this moment. Regret, pain, loss. Passion, tenderness, devotion.
He fucking
Dedicated to my love, Heli, beautiful and just out of reach.
Maybe Castiel was ‘sunshine’ because everything was so cloudy, dim and gray without the angel. Everything was repetition upon repetition of motions, hunts, and staying alive...and all it took to want to stay alive was that gruff ‘Hello, Dean’.
“I think there might be a solution to the
“I’ve always kept you safe, haven’t I?”
“Anything I can do to help?” he asked, leaning against the counter.
And that honestly kind of hurts.
He doesn’t understand. Doesn’t process it. Just stares blankly at it.
Before the thoughts can even worry him too much, Dean’s little brother is yelling from across the room, “For fuck’s sake, just kiss him already, Dean!” It’s the first sound that breaks through the comfort and safety of their own world around them.
Cassiel.
Dean vowed, picturing the scene in his head,
His legs work hard to keep up with Dean’s, the stray asphalt pebbles beneath his shoes grinding into the blacktop and crunching and popping. He feels his muscles strain against his skin, and the first signs of sweat tickling his brow.
“Dean?”
When his tongue pushed between my lips, I couldn’t help but sigh and submit to him, my hands shaking and stabilizing myself on his strong shoulders. He felt so good, and so right. As we kissed, the minutes passed, until we could scarcely breathe. We kissed until somehow I was beneath him on the couch and he was pulling my shirt over my head, and I was letting him...and until my fingertips were on his warm chest and wrapping around his neck as he kissed me more.
My heart skipped.
The other him, that is.
“Hey Dean,” Sam called, “I didn’t know that you and Cas also shared profound...bunnies.”
And, it’s funny, Cas thinks, that an hour ago, Dean, the person he used to be closest to in this god-forsaken universe, had been reduced to pencil shavings and lines sketched on empty pages…
“Listen, you,”

bestseller list...but, for me, it’s beautiful poetry- a masterpiece.
Dean tilts his head, examining one of the pages of Castiel’s work, “But, I’m glad to see that my ass is a good muse for your...creative talents.”
“Hello, Dean. Think I just found the end of the book on your keys.”
, even knowing he’s a bad driver. It’s toxic as hell. The notion is entirely wrong, and he’s back to feeling like a preteen getting his hair pulled. He’s not going to be made to feel helpless. He might be alone, but he’s capable- and old friend or not, he’s not gonna let Dean get away with this. It’s too far this time.

That same something was present when the glances they stole lasted a bit too long, and then, more than a bit too long. Something happened when green eyes transmitted to blue. It was as though their eyes were sharing secrets that their hearts didn’t understand, yet.
“Sorry!” Castiel clumsily offers to one of the guys that he bumps into. It’s short lived, because then he’s laughing again. And he finds that no matter how much his lungs burn, it’s hard to stop.
“Can it, Sam.”
Here is pain and hurt. In the places that Castiel is letting Dean loves him lies a wound, old and deep: the ways in which he doesn’t belong, the ways in which he’s failed. He doesn’t know if Dean can kiss that better. But he trusts him enough to let him try.
“No. No, no, no, no, no…” I started panicking, pleading, “Please don’t do this. Please. Dean, we’re happy. Look, I’m not even mad anymore, it’s okay. It’s okay, you can take your time...you don’t have to tell him until you’re ready.” I wrapped my arms around him as though he would disappear in an instant.
(See the end of the chapter for
There’s more than completion. There’s fullness. A gentleness encompasses him with every subtle shift, every adoration that Castiel deems to give.There’s safety, protectiveness in their strength: one that could create or destroy, and instead they choose to simply hold.
His world’s always been so dark, so painstakingly difficult to march on like a soldier towards the light. And then Cas blinded him: this shining brightness that never let the darkness creep too deeply or too close. It’s evident in the way that even though Cas is resting, his arms are still tightly around Dean, cherishing his loved one, and protecting him much in the same way Dean would do for him.
Warnings include PTSD related Panic Attacks.
“Hello, Dean,” I couldn’t help but smile at how real he was, standing there. At how well my memory had preserved him. I was still dying inside, and at the same time, I felt overjoyed.
I couldn’t believe it. I looked up, and in the sun, there he was- like not a day had passed. Of course he still had his freckles, and his beautiful green eyes, and even that same sweet smile. But, not even his attire had changed- classic leather jacket and ripped jeans Dean Winchester. Still the man that my heart had been chasing from the moment we met.

“I’m not picky,” I tell him. I am a little bit picky. But, I’m not above picking things off.
He smiles, holding out the movie, and I feel my face heating up. I stare at his pinky for a couple seconds before realizing that I’m actually
“You…” I choked, “You still love me.”
The movie ended too soon. I didn’t want the moment to end, or for him to get up. I was content to stay exactly where I was, until he tilted my chin up, and he kissed me.
“Yess’m-Ellen...” he corrects himself.

Before my broken heart could say a word to that horrible statement, Lisa interrupted, “Dean, we need to go, we have a meeting with Ben’s teacher.” Forced politeness. She definitely knew.
It’s poetic in the best ways, which are also the worst, because he still can’t believe what he heard. It’s a cruel joke. Dean flirts with everybody- guy, girl, the non-binary kids- it doesn’t matter to him. It’s just who he is. He’s the type of guy who gets really into kissing in games like spin-the-bottle, or who cuddles with his friends during the movies and then says it’s platonic.
hurting him. Dean knows nothing of rejection, from what Cas can see.  Castiel takes the few seconds of reprieve to try and shake more of the ink from his precious sketchbook, pages splaying in his efforts. He doesn’t even have time to be embarrassed for calling Dean Winchester out on what are quite possibly the worst flirtations he’s ever witnessed.
Sorry. It's just kind of what happened.
That half-smile again, like the sound of my name made him happy. I feel my knees start to go weak.
And yeah, he did.
“Really,” Cas smiles.
Not at all.
Dean doesn’t fight Cas’ affection, there are enough battles. He knows their love will never be one of them.
“There is no sun, Dean,” Cas fumbles, pulling back so he can get a good look at Dean, “It’s 4:00 AM, and the sun won’t rise until nearly seven. Are you having trouble sleeping?”
Dean’s contented resting against Cas’ back, body tangling with his loved one’s in the sweetest, simplest way.
“He would have been happy for you! If he were any kind of brother at all he’d be happy for you because you’re happy,” I ran my hands up and down his arms reassuringly, “Aren’t we happy, Dean?”
He liked classic rock, and old cars, and we even talked about men. He said he realized he was bi when he developed a crush on Luke Skywalker...I told him my first crush was Aragorn. It was basically a match made in heaven.
Dean straddles the angel with a smirk. He doesn’t have to hold his wrists in place, but does anyway, appreciating his handiwork before moving to Cas’ arms and neck, teasing the opened fabric of his button-up before tracing over his bare chest, meeting touches with kisses.
“Dean, it’s okay, it’s okay, I’m here. It’s another nightmare. You’re safe.”
If he’s the one screaming, it’ll never stop.
And he doesn’t want to.
There are precious few family photos. Four, to be exact.

The graphite slides into the white space of his pages, scarring his work, which doesn’t seem to entirely matter, because seconds later, there’s
Dean didn’t need the rude awakening of Castiel leaving to know that he was in too deep. He already knew. It had been there every time the angel had trusted him, had believed in him more than heaven, and more than his own father- God....something had definitely been there, then. What had Cas called it…?
“Dean,” Cas grumbles at the pet name, snuggling back into Dean’s shoulder.
Castiel’s absence is a wound that refuses to scar over no matter how gently he disappears from Dean’s life.
Just to tell him.
And it’s late, and Dean’s honestly falling asleep more and more by the minute as his fingers continue to trace Castiel’s feathers, and he notices small goosebumps have formed on the angel’s arms. It’s late, and his filter and walls are in standby and sleep mode, respectively.
That didn’t help. I cried harder. I wanted to tell him a thousand things, but the tears wouldn’t even stop for one.
True, they’d been neighbors once. Friends. No...best friends. They’d been best friends. He’ll call it what it was. What it could have been if maybe Dean’s dad hadn’t lost his job, and moved them to the other side of town. No more window sneaking at night, no more video games or shared secrets.
Castiel feels fire- both anger and embarrassment- flooding his face to the point where logic is gone and replaced with fuzzy thoughts. He’s about to make a jump for the sketchbook, but Dean hands it back- good as new, save for the one graphite line Cas had drawn, startled only moments earlier. He slams the book shut.
‘SW’, ‘DW’ the table read. ‘MW, JW, BS, EH, JH, KT, CB’.

And then, he lets Castiel consume him.
I don’t want a knight in shining armor. Not really. I’m successful enough, I make good money, and I could pretty much do anything I want. I just want a partner-in-crime, a life partner...someone who fills me with happiness, and I them- someone to adventure with, share with, and someone to love me for me.

at him.
Cas twists the dial, and the vibrator starts buzzing.
Cas has known that there’s something off for so long, and so far, he’s been true to his word and hasn’t pushed. But it’s becoming very real in Dean’s mind that what they have now, the relationship that they want to build together, that that is gonna want to tear down that wall in Dean’s head.
Jaws was on tv that particular night, a classic, he loved those, and he once more wished for someone to share his guilty pleasures with.
Or could it be that Dean's aim suddenly shifted a little more to long term? Or maybe the hunter life finally got to him and his body simply accepted that he would never have that kind of relationship with a so called "civilian"? Dean doesn't really know.
The shadows of the past where he had to be to good soldier, the tool, Daddys blunt instrument are fleeing from the light that is now in him. Hearing he is accepted the way he is, accepted despite who he loves, is even allowed to love gives him wings to fly.
"Dean."
"I know. I was ashamed. But not anymore. Not after everything we've gone through together."
There it is, the legendary #bitchface.
It shouldn't be that hard, couldn't, won't, that's what he told himself every night when he lay in his bed alone.
"Okay fair. It was like my world got unhinged. It was like a revelation. I know mom and you and Cas described it to me, but to see for myself... Dean the world is so beautiful."
Still HE forgave me. Despite everything I have done. HE forgave me every single time.
Dean can't fight anymore. Maybe it's time to resolve this. It's not like Chuck will suddenly leave them alone or anything. So why not solve it now? He gives in to the thoughts. He tells himself that it's okay to swirl in the thoughts simply to get over them and forget about it. He was sure, once he solved it, it will leave him alone.
A little wasn't what Dean would've called it but whatever.
My truest self, of course not visible to the human eye, a thing one poor woman named Pamela had to find out the hard way, is the size of the human Chrysler-Building, with multiple heads, build to be a warrior.
Well that's what I was, I'm not that anymore. I haven't been "of the lord" for a long time.
"Please Cas."
Soon after Sam Jack enters the kitchen. Dean turns the oven off, puts the bacon on a plate and places it on the table. He looks at Jack, Jack with a returned souls Dean remembers.
People tried to trick who ever gave back the colors. None of them successful.
"Yes? It all was do fast, I'm not sure what to make of it right now, I need a little time."
"Hell Cas, I have to tru that." Momours Dean between hot passionate kisses.
With a whoosh I leave Jack behind, only the wind of my wings ruffling leaves through the air.
"I understand. Yes, please sit down."
The first sip of beer does the trick, stops his racing mind from strangling itself to death. Dean is alone in the kitchen for now but he knows it will stick only until he starts cooking. A thing he discovered to like soon after they had moved in. He really likes cooking, likes nurturing people with food.
"Sorry."
"Oh Cas." Dean can't say more.
Dean enters the room, closes the door and sits down on a chair near to Sam.
Dean sits on the wood, same point as in his dreams. The fresh air, subtexted with a hint of water definitely helps. It was the right call to come here. Maybe Dean will do this a little more regularly. Just sitting there is so relaxing.
Jack's eyes are red. He probably had cried all night, the poor kid. It was a hard one for the kid to get his soul back. Especially since he still had every memory from when he didn't have a soul.
Well if that wasn't a huge surprise then the understanding that Dean doesn't care that Cas basically is a guy certainly is. Holy Shit!
The bacon sizzles in the pan for some.secends when Sam steps into the kitchen.
How does a man confess his undying love to another man? Dean thinks about it for a second. Words are always a challenge. He might stumble a little. But Cas will understand and either tell him to leave, never come back or... or he won't say that.
"Who wants breakfast?"
Dean kisses Cas softly afterwards. Both need a minute to come back to earth.
Lying under the blue sky on a sunny day at his favorite place Dean realizes why he gets jealous about Cas, he realizes why it always crushes him more when Cas does than when Sam dies (this alone is soul crushing). And he realizes what an idiot he is for taking so damn long to understand.
Routine was life.
Soon enough the tongues dance the tango. It's damn hot. Dean's hand wanders in Cas' hair. Thick strong locks roll between his fingers. Cas seems to think that this is a good idea. Soon Dean feels a gentle pull on his own hair.
Sometimes he felt the sharp lilac sting of loneliness.
These were his most memorable clients, the type he looked forward to. Comfortable for him.
"Good morning Jack."
Like in an old movie, death was only the beginning.
Though his Partner wasn't any better.
Dean only hears a grumpy muffled "It's Sam" from behind and smiles to himself. Yepp, he loves to tease his little brother with that and will probably never stop. Actually no, he won't ever stop, not as long as he has the chance to do it. And he knows Sam won't stop either. Period. That's who they are, how their brotherhood works. At least one thing that's normal in their lifes, Dean thinks.
Also Hannah. There definitely had to be something between them. But again, Cas never said a word.
Doing the work to get here, finding a job, a place and other stuff had been fun, but now that he was here he felt a pang of loneliness.
His brother had it, for years, why shouldn't Dean?
"Wow! It looks awesome."
"I'mbisexualandi'minlovewithCas!" Dean blasts out.
"Dean."
"Bouth sound very appealing. Let it be you inside of me, I really wanna know how that feels. Next time we switch."
Everyone wondered why his garden grew so well and beautifull. Especially his neighbor, Mrs. Rogers. She was one nosy specimen of the human race.
Umbrella of love, Dean felt like that, for the lack of a better analogy, he felt like under an umbrella of love when Cas' smile reached his heart.
"No it's fine, not your fault. I'm glad you can experience it as it should be now. And I'm proud of you."
At one point Mrs. Rogers stopped bugging him about his garden, she stopped bugging him at all.
The strange feeling stayed with Dean no matter what he did. It was weird, that's what it was.
Sure, I got glimpses here and there, especially when I was close to HIM. A strong feeling of belonging rushing through my grace everytime. Although we fought, we fought often and we fought hard. Lot's of angry words have been spoken between us. But we always forgave each other and came back to each other. We couldn't stay apart, no matter what.
Confused from the rainbows of life, of the red that was found in his dirt, the reason his plants grew so well, the orange of his shock which was mirrored in his new clothes, of the white rage running through his veins, he sat there, not really seeing were the problem was.
"Cas, I'm...uhm...you know what, imma just gonna say it...I'm in love with you Cas."
It was just a day like any other day. Cas had left for work already and Dean was able to sleep in a little. His shift began around eleven that particular week.
I feel calm, never felt that calm before, full of live and happy. No reason anymore to not feel happy. No reason anymore to be scared of being happy. The deal is done. I never need to worry about it again. It's over, it's done.
Kinda hard, finding one, if he didn't want to date his coworkers, when he was working like almost the whole day every day.
"It's true Jack. Sam was in a cage in hell a couple of years back. I pulled him out but I couldn't get all of him so his soul stayed there. He was soulless for over a year."
There was this sweet older lady, who would call for no real reason. She always would pretend to have "lost" the fax number again (for like the millionths time) or spill some other shady reason for her call. He suspected her to know that number by heart already. She entertained him. She'd always ask after, if it was bad luck to watch doctor dramas on TV, she was totally supersticious. He never dared to say anything else than "no miss, I've been watching them too, never had bad luck". Also he wasn't superstitious. She was satisfied and she'd end the conversation very happy. He suspected her to be lonely. He wouldn't be the one to change her routine and he didn’t want to find out what she´d do if he said “yes”. It would certainly change his routine. He was not having that.
"Back, tights and I think my ankle got broken."

Hands are everywhere. When Cas squishes Dean's ass it's like a fucking miracle.
Does it even matter? Dean can't find the motivation to care about it. He is so bummed about that he was basically gay for Cas, that he loved that damn socially awkward angel deeply, the rest is just foot notes.
Cas chuckled.
Dean curses Cas' chest with his tongue. His hands move towards Cas' trousers, open the belt, unbutton it and zips down the fly. All in one smooth motion. He is absolutely surprised hoe easy ot all is since it's his first time with a dude.
"What? There is nothing about you that I dont understand."
The first time Dean didn't witness. Cas stayed with Chuck and got ripped apart by Raphael. Oh but the second time when Lucifer, wearing Sam to the prom, explodes Cas Dean was there, Dean saw. For a moment, after the ground closed behind the falling down Sam, Dean really felt alone. But Cas came back.
Why can't he do anything the easy way like Sam does? Why does he always have to get angry or drunk or both? And why is it always his family who gets the whole shitshow blown in their faces? They don't deserve that, well they don't deserve to get stuck with his sorry as. He doesn't deserve them, their attention, their caring or whatever. He is a grunt and he knows it.
Finding the perfect ring was easy, he knew what Cas liked.
"I'm not blind nor stupid."
"Dean? Okay, come in."
"Okay so get this..."
"I'll make sure I'll have you for very very long. I love you too Dean."
After four months of this, Cas asked Dean if he'd like to move in with him and hell yes, Cas' place was perfect, so of course Dean agreed.
The nice lady with the doctor dramas suddenly didn’t want to talk to him anymore, she demanded a new person. Maybe he should have said “yes” at least once. His apples never tasted better.
So no murders, thefts, robberies and any other crime anymore.
"You sure Dean?"
"So Jack, maybe we could talk a little?"
Best decision ever, they got along so well, they were perfect for each other, made for each other, Dean was so in love.
The news, which he was forced to watch now, were all over it. Though it was a different speaker.
Dean has no doubts about his feelings, no doubts about the things he learned about himself. That's not the reason for his hesitation. He is simply kinda scared that after all Cas could say "no". Dean doesn't know if he could take that one. On the other hand he knows he has to give Cas at least the chance to choose. He owns him that much. Cas is everything so no matter how this might go, there is no way in hell that Dean won't accept it.
There was something special about Cas, Dean often thought. Not only was he this weird dorky dude in sensible shoes, he also was able to see the colors. He never told how that came to be.
All was over.
It was kinda agony but in the best way.
That meant true acts of selflessness have gotten even harder to achieve, because besides the occasional nature disaster nothing ever happened.
When you have nothing left but Darkness, it's quite easy to see what is true and not.
Dean realizes there is the topic of how to perform the final step. Though nothing holds him back anymore. He is free, free to use his words.
In a Hollywood worthy move, Dean shoved himself infront of the truck, grabbed the kid, fell on his back, slid over the street out of the line of the truck. He could feel his back getting scratches, getting road burns on his tights and somehow his ankle twisted from the sudden movement in a way that was not natural.
Dean wraps his head around that one. Could it be? The last woman he kissed? Could it be that it was Amara? For real? No wait, there was the nice lady when claire got bit by a werewolf. Not a memory Dean likes to remember.
"Technically it wasn't the first time."
Yes, he hated the changes. Maybe he should have put up a fight so hard that he had to leave his life forever. But that wouldn't happen now. So many eyes were on him twenty four seven. It was a nightmare.
It was worth it.
All kind of flowers, vegetables and trees grew in his beloved garden. And they grew well.
No prints, no DNA, no scratches, nothing under the fingernails, no hair, no footprints just the body. It was like a ghost had done this. It was all so clean. According to what the news shared, the police skipped some details. They loved their secrets he supposed.
Dean thinks about that often. What would've happened if he never got Sam? But lately, well since the whole Mark thing, Sam had kinda changed. Just slightly. Not the full "I'm a new person" crap of change. No, Sam got more determined to their cause. He cam to finally accept the hunter life, even to like it. Although Dean knows that deep down Sam still wishes for a normal life. Hell Dean does too. But they don't do normal so here is that.
"You'll probably hate me for this... how do I say it?"
Dean takes a deep breath, leaves baby and finds his way to Sam's room. He knocks gently.
No one asked Cas to do it, he did it just for Jimmy, no arterial motives. And that's why there wasn't any physical or mental harm.
"May I kiss you Cas?"
It almost burned  away everything that he was.
Dean thinks 'It's now or never', smiles about the cheesy Elvis line but doesn't give a shit.
-------
"Uhm... maybe later, right now, I'm just trying to stay calm."
Dean was just a child when it happened, only four years old. Sammy was even younger, like six months old.
Just recently. I found my real place, just recently. Well recently for me, i suppose. For humans, I guess, it's been a while. And as I let myself belive in it, live in it, feel it, be happy in it, as soon as I let that happen it was over.
"I'm glad it happens now."
Time stood still, heartbeats were missed until a big bright smile shone from Cas' face.
After a while the pain set in. He found the voice to ask for an ambulance and a call to his husband. Though they weren't married yet, but hell that was such a close call, Dean would be a damn fool to not change that.
"Ohhh. I didn't know that."
Anger is not a new emotion for me. And I am angry, very angry. More angry than I ever was. Well maybe not quite more than that one time when HE wanted to say "yes".
"Thank you. I was a fool though. So sure of myself. Glad I'm not that person anymore."
How did it all begin one might ask? Who I am? How did I end up here? Let me tell you who I am, who I was and who I wished to be.
The only tree space is right next to Cas on the bed. 'Well ain't that a bitch.' Runs through Dean's head. Of course he doesn't hesitate, not even for a second. Those days are over. Dean sits down close, very close, next to Cas. So close that their hips almost touch. 'Screw personal space' thinks Dean with a smile.
"I need you to understand some things about me."
It all started with those stupid two cats. Well technically it didn’t. But they pooped on the wrong side of the fence and dug in the wrong part of earth. His English rose grew fabulous afterwards.
Cas has his hands first under Dean's shirt. The kiss is shortly broken in favor of getting the shirt out of the way.
"Heya Sammy."
Maybe they don't know any better. Or maybe it was just Chuck forcing them. Or maybe, just maybe the might even care about him. But that one was highly vague. Sam surely did care till one point but not as much as he did. Sam had proven how he thinks about him on more than one occasion throughout the years since he had taken Sam away from Stanford
"You're still a cocky son of a bitch." Dean winked.
Also, if he ever felt the red heat of his anger, his garden was where he let it go into. He still would do it with love, his garden was his everything.
"Why are you here?"
A gigantic truck drove a little bit to fast so there was no way that would stop without hitting the kid.
It had been kinda clear since the day in that barn. Badass entrance, flying sparks, literally, smirking while being stabbed, like he couldn't care less, yeah Cas had it all! Dean had been lost that day. He simply didn't understand, didn't know, didn't believe, so he pushed it away, afraid of getting hurt, of being abandoned, he pushed it far away. But it always had been there.
HE was supposed to live HIS life in the fullest. I went into the darkness so HE can live. I died for HIM!
She died five years ago, happy and surrounded by family.
Why is he still thinking about Cas?
"I know you're there Dean. Please come in."
"What is it Dean?"
Suddenly a yellow, very familiar, bright  light fills my darkened vision. It's warm, calm and feels like home.
"My name is Dean Winchester, I'm bisexual and I love Castiel, angel of the lord."
Pink, like HIS lips I wish I was able to kiss. How bad I wish I was not a coward. How bad I wish to go back to HIM. I never wanted to leave HIM behind, to leave HIM alone, to abandon HIM.
It didn’t used to bother Dean this much, being on the road, just he and Sammy and the car roaring at ninety-miles-per-hour down the freeway. He used to find solace when the Allman Brothers sang that he was born to be a ramblin’ man. It had been true, then.
There are good things ahead for them, Dean is sure of it. Things to look forward to, that maybe hadn’t been there before in the same way. They’re things that’ve always been there that now exist differently, rejuvenated, and full of promise. Like, they’ll hold hands on that bench in the park where they sit and talk for hours. And, when they part, Dean’ll make sure to kiss Cas goodnight. And he won’t be ashamed, or hide, cause he’s the luckiest guy in the world and he’s gonna make damn sure that Cas knows that.
The feathers twitch. Castiel has never felt
They sprint past the cheers and good-humored laughter of their classmates, they dart through the lunchroom doors toward their freedom- the main door at the end of the hall.
And then they’re running, hand-in-hand.
He could spot the summer grass in Dean’s eyes a mile away. It’s the kind of colour that if the art companies could bottle as paint or marker, they’d be rich. No two existing colour combined does them justice. He knows, because he’s tried.
They slow to a halt that nearly has Cas crashing into Dean, who says with more seriousness than Cas can recently remember hearing out of his maybe-boyfriend, “Please be serious.”
So, ‘
“Oooooh,” sighs the cafeteria, in a collective burn.
“I’m fine, Dean.” Castiel reassures.
him to come.
“Good morning, sunshine,” he had said.
Dean’s half on his stomach, half on top of his angel, sleeping, snoring just a little, and drooling against Castiel’s trenchcoat.
And on the one hand, that scares him to hell and back, but on the other hand - he’s built walls because he’s used to people walking in and taking pieces of him without his permission, and leaving. And he doesn’t think that’s what Cas or their relationship is all about.
The word ‘no’ pulled at Dean’s lips, but Cas looked so...so freakin’... happy. So instead, he rolled his eyes, turning to walk out of the room.
“Hey…” Dean and Sam both said in unison, as Mary joined them.
Dean whines. Cas increases the speed of the vibrating egg in his ass as punishment.
feeling it.
you!?”
In silence, though, Castiel’s found that he rather likes to read. Not all books are dusty grimoires with dull accounts of hunters day-to-day encounters with the supernatural. There are books full of hope- love stories and tales of triumph that have inspired humanity for hundreds of years. They inspire him, too.
He’s already falling asleep when Cas fluffs a towel over his head.
Cas deserves tender kisses and gentle touches so that when the rough stuff happens, he knows it’s from a place of love and mutual consent- not a place of danger or anger. Deserves to know that when Dean looks at him, he’s looking at his entire world.
Tiny as in the fact that there are easily more drawings of Dean sketched in the book than any other of his muses. In his defense, Cas has to stare at the back of Dean’s head for three classes, and he’s...he’s
Chapter has sexual themes~ :3
“On an adventure,” Dean grins, turning his head to look at Cas.
“Hey, Cas,” Dean starts before he gets the music rolling, “Got any plans for New Year?”
with it.
Let its ashes waste and decimate in the flame,
To anyone else, it would have sounded calm, collected. But I knew my red thread. I caught the tiny hitch in my own name, the way that his voice dropped half an octave when he was upset, or if it was something serious. I could feel the subtle tremors in his arms where he was trying not to shake, trying desperately not to show what he thought was weakness. He was so strong. He held worlds up for everyone, and didn’t even know how beautiful and strong it made him.
“Before she tried to freakin’ kill you…” Dean says in a low, softer rumble. “It was abuse, Cas. And it wasn’t okay. And it’s not meant to be like that.”
This is a reverse AU- Angel!Dean, Hunter!Cas
supposed to be. He feels anger building in his chest, coiling tightly around his senses and blurring them. He wants April to die again.
There was a long pause. A long, unbearably quiet pause, where all I could hear was the blood rushing in my ears.
Cas POV about Dean in some kind of AU
“You deserve good things, Dean,” Castiel says gently, reaching his hand up to run his fingers through Dean’s hair. Normally he’d be fighting instincts that told him ‘too much, you’re opening up too much, you’re too vulnerable’. But, Cas is trusting him with his wings, so the least he can do is show that same level of trust.
He wraps an arm around my shoulder, pulling me closer. He smells like the leather of the jacket. And, something else...cedar, maybe. “You’re not like other people, are you?” he asks.
I drop my movies, and he immediately picks them up. Who said chivalry has to be dead? And he’s not opposed to musicals. Is there anything that isn’t perfect about him?
“Hey, Earth to Cas,” he hurries, stepping in front of the drawer protectively, trying to pass his panic off as a joke again, “You here with me, sunshine?”
Baby rolled a touch over eighty down the empty desert highway. It seemed like something straight out of
This one is rated 'M' for sexual themes.
Maybe it was because Castiel had said that Dean shined brighter than the millions of stars that the angel had spent his time counting before they met. And, well, Dean figured if he were bright as a star, then, well, Cas was the friggin’ sun.
Castiel cradles Dean’s sleeping form after his storms, placing a hand against Dean’s chest and whispering softly, “I will keep you safe.”
“It makes me very happy, Dean, to be your moon, or your sun. But you are light, you are good, for me, as much as for you, as much as I am for you.” It’s soft, and Dean’s having trouble focusing. And he has a tendency to shut out praise anyway.
A dark desert highway, indeed.
He was in too deep when he saw Castiel everywhere when he was gone. He was in the window, the mirror, and the side of the road...and then he was in the songs, the lyrics...and somewhere, the angel had found his way into Dean Winchester’s heart, leaving a dull hole and ache when he wasn’t around to fill it.
I could fall in love with him. Easily.
A blackening darkness.
, Cas hates that saying. It completely overrules the fact that Dean just called him ‘cute’. That line is something he’d hear from his dad, or Michael or Luke- not from the same boy who used to let him win
A smile curves Dean’s lips, and he can’t help but reach out and brush Castiel’s astoundingly wild hair out of his eyes.
They fought for moments like this, and something about this life is simply breathtaking. Exactly as it is. It can be the kids’ turn now. He’s good with that.
“Cas…”
“For what it’s worth, Cas, it’s invisible ink. And, I’m glad to see my ass is a good muse for your...creative talents.”
, when, if anything, he should
be safe.
I must look pathetic to this beautiful guy. I’m holding a stack full of chick flicks in my hands, stammering like an idiot, and unable to form words.
?” I spat, slamming the door behind me before he could even get in the door, “Are you kidding me, Dean?”
Work was the same as always and Dean liked it that way. Afterwards he drove home. Well, where else would he go? Though something felt off and Dean couldn't put his finger on it. It drove him nuts.
Cas doesn't have to ask twice. Dean gently moves slowly in and our. Cas feels damn perfect around Dean.
Rumors about not only abusive fathers but abusive mothers even worse than their male counterparts.
Mrs. Rogers was devastated over that and wondered for a long time what she did wrong with her two fur balls that they decided to not show up again. And she wondered if they were okay. So far she didn't get an answer to either of those questions.
Now or never, he thought, he was damn determined to finally ask the most important question in his whole life tonight.
Pants and underwear fall down, get kicked away. Everyone takes a good look. Then they kiss and fall to bed.
Validation for his actions rushed through his veins when Cas' answer was nothing less than a big cheerful 'YES', the kiss they shared afterwards was one of the most passionate ones in all history of kisses.
And then there was Cas. A weird dude they met at their fathers funeral.
"Dean!"
In short words, Dean counted himself as the luckiest excuse of a human to be alive, he didn't think he deserved Cas' love but he got it anyways so he learned to deal with it.
What made him so lovable to Dean was that he never bragged about his ability, nor did he ever belittle someone for not being able to see colorful. Basically, Cas was the kindest human Dean ever met.
"Hello Dean."
A small tube magically appears from somewhere. Dean didn't know that Cas was still able to perform even such minor wonders.
Finding a warm body for one night was easy, not so much finding something more permanent.
Suddenly the kid got himself loose and ran on the street.
Very tempting it was, so very tempting, to just push his lips on Cas' but he manned through it, without giving into the temptation, proud of himself for once.
He'd rather stay oblivious than to have his routine disturbed by anything.
He hadn't turned on the news for over two weeks. It was not the huge break from routine as he expected. Quite the contrary. He found that he actually didn't miss the bluntness and directness of the speaker.
Dean is so cought in that little moment that he doesn't notice the other figure leaning against the doorframe at the entrance of the kitchen. If he didn't know any better he would say the Angel looks relieved.
Jack has good and important work for me. I'm gladly helping him to build the heaven everyone, the heaven HE deserves. HE at least gained the right to feel true happiness. So does every good being in the universe. Even if it's only in the afterlife.
Nobody knew why he was there. Cas never said, no matter how much Dean pushed him.
A few foot from him he saw a woman with a young kid, probably not older than five. The kid seemed to be excited about something and was pulling on the mothers arm to get her going where he wanted to go.
Only one third of all humans in the last thirty six years ever had gained back what was lost. Ninety percent of them died either during the act or shortly after fulfilling the task. The other ten percent were either injured badly or had mental problems. No one got to see the colors unscathed.
The conversation pretty fast spiraled over other topics after that. Dean knew that Sam did it on purpose but he was grateful.
"Through something I'm not ready to discuss with you, my color vision has returned today. Physically I'm fine, so don't worry about me."
"It was."
So, spending the time when usual the news would be on with reading a good book, it occurred to him, he didn't need to watch the news.
It's impossible for Dean to hold back his tongue any longer, the pull towards Cas is too strong. Dean needs something to hold on. Cas is his anchor. When he finally allows his tongue to lick over Cas' soft kissing lips it is the greatest feeling. A moment later Dean is blessed with a similar response from Cas' tongue.
"Are you saying what I'm thinking you are saying?"
What even surprises Dean more is that he doesn't miss the one night stands or the random pick ups in a bar. Sure, he still got it, tests it out on any occasion. He simply isn't interested in that anymore. That really gets him. Why isn't he interested in awesome sex with a hot lady? Something must be wrong with him. Oh no! Don't let it be an age thing. He is way too young for that, barely scratched fourty.
"Heya Cas."
HOW DARE HE TO JUST DIE!! THIS IS RIDICULOUS!!
It wasn't.
Dean starts analyzing his recurring thoughts. All are swirling around Cas. Why? Dean thinks about Sam just to humor himself or in the hope that it would make no difference for his feelings. But oh, oh, OH, there is a difference. It's huge!
Really? Cloud watching? Man.
Unforgivable mistakes.
Find my hunter (yes HE is mine) and do what I longed to do for so long. No cowardness anymore. No hesitation. I'm not scared anymore, I don't want to be. I wanna give just love, my love, all my live to HIM.
"Hello Dean."
Darkness, there is only darkness.
One, only one, colleague stood out to him, beautiful blue eyes, dark messy hair, strong jawline with stubble, heck yeah!
Yeah sure, guys had flirted with him. Some were even kinda successful (no thank you very much) but damn. Had this been always a part of him? Or is it only Cas? Is it Cas who holds the key to Dean's broken heart, to heal it?
His bright wings are spread wide, just for me. They have changed. Once a gentle yellow, their tips glance now in pink and blue.
"You knew?"
He takes the same route Cas took, kissing, sucking, gently biting Cas' neck down to his nipples. Cas moans louder.
Dean still feels that loss. But he also still feels the happiness when Cas stood right there at a phone booth telling he annoyed a cosmic entity. The tightest hug he ever had with Cas. Although he would never admit that. Cas was back, in all his glory, original trenchcoat and tie, it was like coming home.
One hand still in the others hair both parties explore the shape of the others body with the free handmade streaking over backs, petting arms, curassing the chest and neck. Up and down, not that far down, yet. The circle begins again.
Apparently seeing a rainbow but not being able to see the vibrant seven colors it used to have broke all the rules of so called society.
But it's relaxing and no one sees him so it's okay. Dean wouldn't even mind if someone sees him.
And if, for some cruel reason (the universe like to be cruel, well at least before Jack took over), if HE doesn't feel the same, if HE hates me for what I've done, if HE is angry at me for the things I said, if HE is not able to accept what I wish to gift HIM, I'll deal with that too.
"Yes. Are you?"
"Where does it hurt?"
(See the end of the chapter for
It works for a while. Dean can ban Cas out of his mind for a minute or two but then another picture pushes over the bee picture.
Kitchen, bathroom, bedroom, living room, Kitchen again, cause it couldn't be to clean and cellar. Rinse and repeat.
Reaching for the box inside his pocket, Dean looked for words, found them and spilled them, the big one was out in the open, now the ball was in Cas' yard so to speak.
Around everything, people, half people, non people, Chuck, choices, if there really is something like "Free Will" and so much more. Round and round his thoughts go until he has enough. Three billion times a day is the definition of enough.
"I love you Cas."
Everyone laughs a little. This is good. After everything, after the mess, this is good.
Jack embraces the hug but a bit more hesitant than with Dam. Dean can't blame him.
I'm not so happy with the smut, but obviously I'm not able to do better with it. It's been a while since I've written this story (well about two weeks or something) but I think imma leave it the way it is.
"That's the protocol after declaring one loves another I think. Yes please, kiss me Dean."
There is only one thing left for me to do, for me to be complete.
Why is he even surprised? The angel always knows. Dean opens the door.
Cas gently streaks over Dean's anti possession tattoo and for the first time ever Dean sees Cas' enochian warding tattoo in it's full glory.
"Yes, sweetheart, I can see your blue eyes, your ruffled dark hair, your tanned skin and the little stubble. Cas, you are breathtaking in grey already but you are a killer in multi-color. You are the love of my life. Marry me?"
"Get this. I was soulless once too. I might know a little, maybe even able to help. But only if you wish."
"Awesome Cas, that was awesome."
I wish I could see it that way. Yes, I was lied to, but working with Metatron was dangerous, I knew that. What else can one expect if the scribe? But I was desperate, desperate to bring back order in heaven. I should've known...
Mrs. Rogers finally found out what his secret for his garden was, also she found out why her beloved pets didn’t come home. She didn’t like it, at all, so she had to go. There was no time to see how his strawberries would turn out.
That wasn't hard at all.
-------
What made it all so news worthy was the state the bodies and their surroundings were found in. Not even even the faintest clue was there to find.
He hated all the sudden changes!
Son of a bitch! That was smug,that was hot as hell. Cas has hidden talents that's for sure. Dean can barely wait to see what else Cas can do.
Black, strong, they could fly everywhere. And when the sun stroke them, their deep black shimmered colorful.
The second thing happening was realizing that he was even able to see the blue.
If he wanted to know what was going on he'd simply buy a paper. At least a paper wouldn't lull him into blue some tiredness.
Stealing himself for whatever answer Cas might give Dean waited.
Dean doesn't regret the prayer. He never will. It made things almost right between Cas and him. Cas stayed after that. He only leaves the bunker for hunts, the occasional hell or heaven visit or to buy food.
His gentle blue eyes, full of power, more power than I ever saw in him, look at me lovingly.
Is that what you feel when kissing an angel? Or is it just that Dean finally kisses HIS angel? His angel who kisses him back.
Straight to the point, as usual. Dean takes a deep breath.
A few years back it was discovered that there was a way to get the colors back. But it was not an easy way.
Right now there is no hunt, nothing to do about Chuck so the four living members of the family business have the day off. Which is basically hell for Dean's circling thoughts. The circle and circle, never stop. Nothing really helps. No movie, no music no alcohol, nothing. It's a mess in his brain. Thinking about all the wrongs he did. Thinking about all the messes HE made. Thinking about all the chances he let slip because of it.
On the weekends he would tend to his garden. It was a nice, large place around his house.
HE was worth it!
Reading between the lines, Dean noticed, that Castiel was not one for one time deals.
I'm haunted by all my worst memories, my failures, my losses, tortured with them. No way to redeem myself, not anymore. Nothing left for me.
Years, and years of fulfilling love would follow, Dean just knew.
Well not quiet only, I'm haunted, haunted by all my mistakes.
"Wait what?"
A single happy tear runs down his face. There is another one but not from him. Oh. He isn't the only sap in the room. Well if that's not encouraging than he doesn't know what is.
"I'm perfectly fine."
Now is the perfect time. Nothing can hold me back.
Long gone were the people who caused it, but that didn't change anything.
"What took you so long?"
(See the end of the chapter for
I can feel my father's power through Jack. Interesting. I wonder how and when that happened. Maybe he finds me worthy to share that story with me.
Both of them, Lisa the woman and her kid, Ben, witnessed when Cas and Dean exchanged vows and ring under the full moon on a sweet warm summer evening combined by the sea waves.
"I love you Dean."
Dean's wounds healed fine, Sam got over his mental issues after a while.
Stay with me guys, the tags aren't there for nothing.
Dean doesn't want to think about April. He really doesn't. He hates her and if he could kill her again he would stab her a thousand times. Not only for torturing Cas. Yeah that wasn't all of it.
Dean can feel Cas smiling.
So Dean decided to take it slow for once when he usually rushed towards the fun part.
"You'll get there too."
Now Sam really laughs.
"She has nothing to do with this." Cas says all serious.
Cas flinched for a second, apparently he didn't expect that statement but he caught himself fast.
I stand infront of HIM, way to close as always but I don't even care. I stand infront of HIM, stare into HIS eyes and I know it will be okay. I know my heart is safe. With the two words, so often spoken, I stand infront of HIM:
"This feels so good Dean. Please move."
Though Dean didn't feel pain, not yet.
The usual greeting makes Dean smile, it's so Cas. Cas watches him, eyebrows knitted together as if he is trying to solve a riddle. It's so adorable. Dean has to force himself not to fly on Cas' lap and cover his body in dirty hot kisses.
Under no circumstances Dean would jump Cas' (that's what he started to call him on day two) bones on the first date, Cas deserved to go through it the right way and so did Dean.
Woah, what a surprise. Dean always thought he sees Cas as his best friend, his brother. While the first one is kinda true, the second one couldn't be more far off.
The sapphires soften.
Dean wonders why he had been so scared of all of this. There had been no reason at all.
Though there is still Cas.
"Yesm I have been in love with you since I pulled your beautiful soul out of hell."
No matter how tortures my past is, no matter how my aggressor uses it against me. I'd make the same choice. I have no regrets. The live I saved always will be worth it. I made my peace with it, long before it came to be. This was my decision.
Everyone hoped it would, when they relieved the last person of their life, everyone thought that would be it.
×××××
Every day after work he cleaned for hours. It was mesmerizing. Well for him.
"About what?"
Bees everywhere. Bees on legs, bees on hands, bees on the chest, bees on other body parts. None of the parts has been clothed. The memory of Cas showing up naked, covered in bees. Urgh. Why that picture?
Dean can't help it, grabs Cas' twitching dick and streaks it.
"Never! I'm done with those. It's you, only you. As long as I'm able to, it will always be you. I love you Cas!"
×××××
From being the good, obedient solder, I fell, oh how I fell. Hard, with no mercy, wings burned to crisp. In my fall I took all my siblings with me. They fell harder.
Making the perfect dinner for this, preparing his home, Dean was finally ready.
"I should move on" and no response to that from Dean still swirrel around in Dean's head with all the other horrible things he ever had said to people in his close vacinity. Dean even still hears the finality of the door closing right behind Cas' turning back. And Cas' pleading look to be stopped, the pain on his face. Yeah, Cas needs time to really forgive that one. For once Dean was happy to give it.
It’s a miracle that five minutes later, they’re bumping and thumping down the gravel driveway, windows rolled up, the car finally starting to heat up.
But Cas hasn’t. He can still read him like an open book when panic is close.
Fragile. Like glass.
There are words to describe that. Abuse. A different kind of abuse than Dean had experienced early on in his life, but just as dark a place, Dean imagines, just as scary.
More empty promises. More times where he just hasn’t been enough.
“But for now,” Dean shoots a roguish smile back in the direction of their pursuit, “Basically, run.”
“What do you need right now, Dean?” Cas asks gently, “Do you want me to go get you some breakfast? Some water?” His voice is calm, and slow, soothing.
In his thought, Dean kissed Castiel on the forehead, handing the angel a cup of coffee exactly how he liked it- black.
The world swirls around you- destructive and violent. But just for a moment, every turmoil in your being ceases. And there’s light, and there’s quiet. There’s a mutual understanding, and a peace between you and the universe.
“Not. Yet.”

“Nice to meet you,” I forced out.
It’s been a long day, and yet, at the end- Cas takes the time to wash Dean’s hair, and then hold him in his arms beneath the warm rain of the shower.
And every ‘hello, Dean’ from the times that they were so young comes back to him, and every ‘hello, Dean’ he wishes he would’ve said when Dean walked past him in the hall for the past few years. The number of times he wishes he’d asked ‘why?’ Because now, it feels like such a waste of time.
“You really don’t see it, do you?” Castiel asks, and his voice is hushed, but it almost sounds surprised, like Dean’s humanity has surprised him all over again.
They’re running a few hours late by the time they’re loading up the car again with bittersweet goodbyes to be had all around. It’s always hard to say goodbye to Sam. It’s a habit that Dean hasn’t quite broken, being like a Father Hen to his little brother. It’s why they’re honestly better apart. Sammy’s good. He’s almost an adult sasquatch now, and next year, he’ll be having his own adventures. Dean’s excited to come and visit, hopefully with Cas in tow, and they can argue, and geek out, and spend time together. But then, like now, it’ll be time to go home.
“Dean,” Castiel whispers, his lips pressing a soft kiss to his hair, “You are every star in the sky. Every single one.”
” like you’re
Even now, Dean’s stomach is turning into knots, his body growing cold at the thought of the call.  He closes his eyes and lets out a deep breath which is all the warning Cas needs.
“Comes with the territory,” Jo shrugs, agreeing with Sam, “We take care of our own.”
Some people have a favorite book they carry around with them all the time. They can quote lines and pages without looking, and know the character in the book better than they even know themselves. For some people, they find comfort in religion and the
The heat falls, Cas’ touch grounding him to reality: safety, love, home. The struggle stops, and when Dean opens his eyes, he has no trouble with his answer: “Green.”
The ocean toys with the senses: you smell and hear it before you see it. Once in view, there’s nothing on Earth quite as breathtaking...save for watching your loved one’s pupils dilate, tears brimming, just at the edge of falling. The man has saved the world, but he’s never seen the sea.
Dean feels himself shaking with the weight of his words. And he tries again.
Castiel’s facial features change like seasons, harsh winter to a pleasant spring with his eyes closed, that intense blue lost somewhere to a world of blissful dreams. Human dreams.
Mostly for abandoning him. And then forgetting about him.
Tears, then. Human tears.
“Dolphins are capable of enjoying sex, too, Dean. It came highly recommended by the woman at the counter. She said she uses it with her wife.”
I’ve been thinking about getting a cat for a few months now for the company. Or, maybe a dog if I haven’t completely given up hope. Don’t other guys go jogging with their dogs? I could take it for walks and some cute guy might ask me out for coffee.
“You hurt my brother, I’ll end you,” Sam says simply.
Beside his own name, he etched hard and deep, making sure that the initials would be as long lasting as the effect of the bearer on his heart.
“Yeah,” I grinned, “And I don’t really like black olives, or pineapple…”
What did all of it mean?
But he is feeling a few different things. Dean’s feeling his own heart rate go up at a positive reassurance, and bitterness that he’s just used the same word twice. Nice.
angel. Seeing the way his chest would move as his breaths would become deeper, more pronounced. Watch the subtle changes on his skin, slick with sweat, covered in goosebumps. Hear the sounds pushing against his tongue and through chapped lips that he licks way too often for Dean’s sanity.
But the blush is brilliant, and it makes Cas smile, if cautiously. He’s aware that they’re looking at each other like two idiots in love, and he can’t bring himself to care.
