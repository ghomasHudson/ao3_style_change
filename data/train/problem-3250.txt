If anyone would like a complete list of the plot points and such that I covered and fixed within this story I would love to know to give you one (one final point gets covered in the next part just fyi)
“When I was a boy, before my mama died, I have this memory of her standing over me, sayin’ that I could be anything, I figure you could do with hearing that same sentiment,” he says as he finishes mucking. He leans himself against the stood up fork and wipes a hand across his forehead.
“Don’t mistake me, I am interested in Ringer's abilities but why would I care more for the horse when I’m here to inquire about his handler?” Jody says looking between the two of them.
“This isn't about Chuck, I’m sorry if you thought it was but it—it’s about Cas,” he says, his voice breaking, as it always does, over the single syllable. “I never told you what happened the day but the empty took him, I never shared why it came for him.”
“Cas! No no no come one don’t do this to me.” His hand reaches up to feel for a pulse. His fingers leave trails of Cas’ blood (and his own) along his neck. He hardly registers the beating through the rushing in his ears and the fear that threatens to overwhelm him, but it’s there. He has no frame of reference as to what a heartbeat should feel like so he takes his own, ignoring the fact that he’s spreading Cas’ blood on his neck as well. Cas’ is far slower than Dean’s but Dean reckons that’s because his must be fast.
Cas leaves them, citing that he needs to discuss matters with his father and that he would leave the two to talk more on the opportunity in his absence. Dean can hardly help the way his eyes flit to Castiel’s retreating form every so often as Jody makes idle chatter directed at both him and Ringer.
“Are you regretting it?” Cas asks after a few minutes of silence.
He nods his assent before walking up to Remy. As he walks her to the barn he hears Cas and his father talking in snippets. From what he can gather the girl is sick, call for a priest before the week is out sick.
“Cas, not for nothing but how exactly did you think I made sure I stayed as safe as I could my whole life?” he asks while putting his gun back into his pack.
He knows Cas isn’t going to flip from how he feels now with a few meaningful words but he thinks, any start is a good start.
Castiel isn't sure of the purpose behind this trip but concedes to let his father do as he wishes so as to expedite the process and have him leave. The sour feeling hasn't left his stomach from the night before, but he isn't about to let on to either of them lest they begin to question him about it.
“Hey, you were the one telling me I should try to make friends,” he says teasingly, stepping up to him again.
They’re in the schoolroom, Anael is with the younger kids working through one of the books he’d given Dean weeks and weeks ago. Hannah is with the older kids making sure that everyone is doing their work.
He walks through the property until the sun has taken to bleeding into the treetops. It takes less time than that to spot the house. Pretty might be the best word for it, with clean white walls; nothing like he’s ever seen before on a house. The buildings he grew up around were always brown, except the city halls.
“A friend, he’s helping me out with something later today.”
And if that doesn't have a stone dropping in his stomach. Not only because Jack blames himself but ‘
in a world where Cas is dead.
He nods, the reasoning is sound, if you only need to make enough to get by it’s a lot easier to put work aside when you need to. He doesn't understand it but it makes sense. Never in his life had there been a day that he could just decide not to work, granted he never owned the place he was working at but that freedom must be incredible.
Of course, the biggest source of Dean’s fear going into the reunion had been about Sam’s reaction about Cas.
He stays silent waiting for Cas, who’s looking resolutely at a board of wood as he speaks, to continue.
By the time they get their supper Dean’s head is swimming and his body still aches from its days spent coiled so tightly. He can see that Cas isn’t faring much better, his face contorts in pain when he moves his shoulder and his body is weighed down with the excitement of the day.
He tries to think of a time when he witnessed such proof of a parent's love for their children but comes up blank. Charles forgoing the work on the fields, sidelining the work and letting the farm go so he can be with his daughter as her condition worsens would have been unthinkable to him a week ago. But the heavy set of the man's shoulders and the gaunt look of his face the day he came back at supper proves that there’s little in this world that would come above the family.
“Oh god, how I’d follow you to damnation,” Cas continues as he shimmies his own pants down just enough to free his cock. Dean spits into his hand but before he can wrap his hand around Cas’ length, Cas stops him. Before he can get too far into panic, Cas reaches into his pocket and pulls out a small tin. He pops it open and Dean sees that it’s filled with the same jelly that was put on his shoulder burn. Cas gathers some in his hand and transfers it onto Dean’s. Understanding, he rubs it around out of curiosity before he reaches down and strokes Cas’ cock in the tunnel of his fist.
Both past and present iterations of Dean would desire the rose’s thorns over its petals, one because the life he lived wasn't one that allowed for petal-soft touches and the other because he has been shown that there’s a darkness inside of him that he can no longer bury.
Cas, don’t come, wanna put my mouth on you too,” Dean says between little gasps and tugs of his thoroughly fucked hair. Castiel’s cock jumps at Dean’s words and he imagines how Dean may look poised on his knees; it is almost too much to take.
, your mouth, ‘s so perfect,” he groans.
“Tell her we’ll frame it,” Dean pipes up with a goofy grin.
To make his point land with more certainty he moves, his leg drops from Cas’ waist and—though his hip grinds a bit—he extracts his other leg from its perch on his shoulder as Cas shuffles about to give him the room to do so. Cas slumps down, half on half off of him, once his leg is out in front of him.
“Ahh but I didn't,” he says once his skin settles into a slight hum.
He had spent time with Remy as he waited, it seemed a requirement of his body to not remain stagnant. He was still at her side, petting her flank when the door clattered.
He hands Cas the gun and watches as he fumbles with its weight.
Choking out a laugh through the pain he replies, “You got that right, fuck.”
sits neatly on the page. It is only the second time Castiel has seen it written on anything other than the slate and it hits him squarely in the chest.
It’s quiet again. So quiet for so long that Dean’s skin starts to light up with the weight of the air around him. Words left unspoken; feelings left unshared hang heavy above their heads.
As they get closer Dean sees that the buyer is a woman, with uncommonly short hair and—once she’s close enough so see—kind eyes that still manage to convey that she's not one to be pushed around.
Cas gives him a look that no one could misinterpret as anything but him being wholly unamused with his logic on the subject.
“I almost lost you,” Dean says, his voice barely more than a whisper but still heavy with emotion. Cas shivers as it ghosts along his lips.
(See the end of the chapter for
“That and more, so do me a favour, ya?”
The way the forces of love can kill slowly as much as they can save, love killed Cas, love brought him back, love isn’t enough sometimes and the tragedy lies within a love that aches.
He wanted to kiss him, kiss the stupid experssion off his face. He wanted to spend every second wrapped up in him so that when his payment was due, he hadn't wasted a second of his time with Cas. So that when he was forced to live his life alone, after a few weeks had ruined years of telling himself that he was okay with being alone, he could remember Cas in every way possible, the way he smelled when he was using his grace, like he was standing on a mountain as the ozone seeped into the air around him, heavy but light in the most confusing dichotomy there ever was, how he sounded first thing in the morning, the scratch of his voice sounding like every dream he never left himself have. The way his smile scrunched up his face and sent it tipping backwards to the ceiling. How much he loves Jack and their odd little family, how he would do anything to keep their son safe no matter the cost... oh.
“You got me
Castiel leans back, running his tongue ever so gently against his shaft, revelling in the twitches of Dean’s hips.
Cas bristles a little beside him at the memory, but Dean’s cheeks heat marginally remembering what happened after they got home that night. Turns out that both of their possessive streaks go a bit deeper than either had thought.
“What do you mean by that Pa?”
“Castiel, once you're done helping me put everything back, you’ll pick up the trousers, yes?”
Each word that drips from Cas’ mouth onto his heated skin inches him closer and closer to the precipice. The rough scrape of his stubble on his neck matches the rough almost too dry strokes on their cocks. Spitting into his palm he reaches down and completes the circle Cas’ hand had begun.
He pictured what it might be like to lay his lands on Cas’ body, to feel the hard muscle ripple underneath his hands. How they would feel using each other for pleasure, what Cas would look like as he reached his peak, how he would sound saying his name, his voice wrecked, his touch claiming. His hips bucked violently several times in quick succession, he came with a cry and Cas’ name on his lips painting his chest with his release.
But now the doubt was cut down so much that it should free him from the fear but he stays stuck in it. Because Cas might love him, but that doesn't mean he
Luckily Cas figures it out with him and rips his shirt over his head as he shoves Dean’s up and under his arms. Dean reaches up and threads his fingers into Cas’ hair pulling him down on top of him. The fluttering in his chest at the skin on skin contact is cut off as Cas mouths his way to Dean’s lips. He bites down on Cas’ bottom lip and seizes the opportunity to seal their lips together again, sliding their tongues together the first chance he gets. He gets lost in the kiss, lost in the noises he pulls out of Cas, gets drunk on the feeling.
By some miracle he’s happy; free of fear and the stress of having everything be on him, be his to deal with.
“It is thank you, we’ve not been together long, just about a year now, but sometimes when you know you know.”
Past the house, he can see stables among other buildings and hopes that the owner keeps a string of horses. Beyond that, quite a ways, is the hazy outline of another town. He reckons it might be his next stop, though the distance seems daunting now.
He isn’t going to call attention to himself though, content to listen and learn what he can from it. If anyone in the room was to voice their wish for him to be absent, especially Kali, he would leave without issue but no one raises a point of it.
“I beg your pardon?”
Dean is quiet for a moment, so he stays silent too. He can see Dean working through all of what he said, piecing together a narrative that would both serve what he already thought to be true and, what Castiel can only assume is, the evidence to support the story he’s told Dean.
They spend a bit longer working with Ibby, and he is beyond impressed at his progress and ability, without needing to know his lineage he knows he’ll be a mighty fine horse, good for work or riding.
he understands that nothing had changed, except for him, in that week for Cas. And then in all his righteous fury, Cas had cornered him in the stables and demanded an explanation. How was Dean supposed to answer? He hardly understood the breadth of his feelings himself, let alone try to put them into words for Cas to hear.
To know his signature will be on the document that cements Dean’s removal from his life hurts in ways he couldn’t have imagined. It's worse than just having Dean sign the document because, as witness, he contends that the contract is binding and signed in good conscience. And still, all he wants is for Dean not to sign it.
Cas looks so genuine, so damn concerned for what he wants, that he finds himself nodding along with what Cas is saying. He doesn't want Cas to stop calling him that, he just doesn't want it to make him scared. He gets a soft smile in return. For now, it’s enough to quiet his fear, they’re both here, perhaps a little worse for wear, but here nonetheless.
(See the end of the chapter for
He knows he’s different now, his past isn't just behind him, but he’s taken its lessons and trials and hardships to heart yet no longer falls into the trap of them. He’ll never forget, some things will haunt him for the rest of his life but he’s moved on from it, and it’s like the first breeze you feel in the mornings a birth of a new day, a birth of a new life.
He doesn't know why it still hurts to be reminded of that, he’s known since his childhood that he wasn’t the type of person that would end up with a respectable individual, much less considering the fact that Cas was a man, a man who still had not shown one way or the other where his ‘special interests’ may lie.
His jaw clicks loudly in his head as he yawns, remnants of a terrifying afternoon so many months ago. It's not the only reminder, Cas’ shoulder creaks when the weather shifts, the scar pulls tight against itself and the muscles protest each movement. Dean spends hours sometimes making the pain go away however he can.
“I suppose I’m not most people.”
They both are quiet as she unwraps the fabric for his sling, it's quick enough work, folding his arm in against his chest again and wrapping around and under and over in a crossing pattern across his chest and under his arm until he feels quite like he imagines a child wrapped in blankets would feel.
He’s never understood people who think that he could love any of his adopted siblings less than he does the others, he can hear the thumping of Duma and Balthazar, and the excited murmurs from Anna and Inias and can’t even begin to understand how there could be a person who would love one more than another.
“Castiel are you ready, I need you to be holding him steady now before he tenses with pain.” He tries to relax, closing his eyes and breathing as steadily as he can. He can’t see Cas nod but assumes he must have as he feels Cas’ fingers dig into his skin more. “Okay, I’m getting your arm in the correct place to reset it, this is going to hurt,” Dean grimaces at the grinding shift he can feel in his shoulder, “Now on three, one—.” His breath is punched from his lungs with a shout as Cas’ ma shoves with more force than he would think she’d have and rolls his shoulder back into its socket.
Cas’ hand came up to hold his head and moved him so Cas could kiss him. Like every time it took his breath away again, and he vowed that no matter what, no matter how much research and pleading, and finagling, hell he’d sell his own fucking soul. He was going to get Cas out of his deal.
still did it.” Cas shifts, dropping his shoulder with a low groan and Dean can hear the grinding of the joint put under pressure from his leaning on it. He turns his head to look at Dean and Dean lays his head down on his own arm levelling his stare with Cas’.
Never before has he been so forced to confront the changes his future will bring, it fills him with melancholy and nostalgia, not for moments lived, but for moments he’ll never get to experience. And not for the first time, he wishes things were different so that he didn't have to leave; so that Alfie would always have his leg to hide behind, Uriel would always have him there to make sure that he was being safe as he played, and Hannah would always have him around to confide in.
He learns though, as he approaches the house, that he isn't the only one disturbing the peace of the night. Quiet voices, though only quiet due to his distance from them, drift from an open window on the main floor. He walks towards the mud room's exterior door, stopping when he sees that the interior separating door has been left open.
“Cas come here a second,” Dean calls. “I’m going to reload the revolver so that you have a full six shots but I want you to stand as I am now, feel it out make sure your feet are stable, secure and I’ll make sure that it’s proper after the gun is done.” Cas’ cheeks are oddly flushed and his breathing is shallow, which would be a problem if they were shooting in serious circumstances but Dean supposes that it’ll be fine.
As they travel on, Cas comes alive again, but he also withers. Dean never asked why Cas hadn’t wanted Gabriel to give him an answer about relaying letters, but he reckons it may have to do with the fact that if Gabriel refused, he never would have left and Castiel needed to leave.
Giving in, he allows Dean to go off without a fight, wishing him a good day; to which he again responds with the use of the honorific ‘Sir’. Castiel bristles, pulling up short, he doesn’t turn though having already started walking back to the house, before he starts on again while desperately trying to parse if he’s imagining the eyes he feels on his back. Not willing to give Dean the satisfaction of getting to him, he makes sure to give no indication that he can feel the eyes, if Dean is even looking at him. He knows that it could be all in his head, that he wants Dean to be watching him as he leaves, but he can't get into that now, not with the bustle of everyone slowly waking in the house.
He sits stunned for a few moments, the sound of the door closing gently reaches his ears before his body reacts. His chest tightens again but it’s not from fear anymore. Anticipation makes his blood run like fire in his veins. He kneels up on shaky legs grabbing what little he owns and tosses it into his bag, a moment's hesitation has him grabbing both the blanket and the two pillows that make up his bed.
“I think so, yeah. I’ve got Sam to think about so it was more or less decided for me once I looked at the options.”
Before he can respond, hoping to divert the conversation and for once talk about something else, his father speaks up, “Castiel, while I was out with Remy I came across a young man walking through the far side of our land, he’s in the barn now and will be staying to help on the farm for a time, you will be involved in training him to work while he’s here, I’m hoping he’ll be able to work on the foal, but as of yet he’ll be staying away from Ringer. Can't have the boy getting seriously hurt on the farm or the county might ask a lot of questions I’m not sure any of us has the answer for.” He’d set about eating when his mother was stopped but his father's words make him pause.
They still sit so close together it makes Dean's skin thrum, Cas still leans in and puts his lips behind Dean’s ear to whisper words that don’t need to be spoken loudly. Uses his skin as a confessional and pours his sins out against him, letting him bathe in all that Cas is. They still end up tangled around each other, chests heaving and skin covered in a thin sheen of sweat.
His once flagging erection comes back to life as he blindly maps out Cas’ back and with it comes a sigh from his lover.
“Well I’m quite impressed with your abilities.”
His fists clench at his sides as he paces. All avenues of his brain scream at him to react and be violent, to tear into the people that made him feel this way, but he doesn’t let it take over. He feels sick, a dark mass squirms itself through his stomach, reminding him of every reason he ever had to never trust another soul, reasons stretching back to his childhood.
The poem connects with the final few chapters of the story
“I’m sure they will, Pa said they’ve been working their farm themselves near to a decade now so they’ll have no issue seeing the work you’ve done here.”
Dean’s quiet as he tries to pick one that doesn’t immediately turn sour in his mind, one that stays happy and free of pain.
He can
“I’m not sure I understand Castiel, all of your siblings found their partners here, how are you going to be able to find a woman to marry if you are busy setting yourself up in a new city where you know no one? It doesn’t have to be that you go off before you’ve found a wife, we could get a courtship started and you’d still be able to leave and start your life, it would take but a few months.”
He isn't sure what he is supposed to say so he flicks his eyes up before fixing them on the ground.
He gets lost watching Dean bob his head down to meet his hand where it grips the base of his cock. His carefully constructed control shatters as Dean begins to inch farther down his shaft, his moans send vibrations up the remaining length and he can barely hold back the canting of his hips, desperate to have more of his cock surrounded by that perfect heat.
“Dea—”
He didn't know he was crying until the first tear hit his hairline. They’d wasted years, more than a decade skirting around each other too terrified of rejection to go after what they both wanted so desperately and now? Now after getting the briefest of tastes of the life they could have had, Cas was going to die, was going to get ripped away from them without any pomp and circumstance. And like a whisper in the night, or the ghost of the wind against your face he’ll be gone, and Dean knows the hole that he’ll leave will surely kill him too.
“Yes Ma.”
“You know she has you wrapped around her little finger, don’t you?”
Dean stands there a bit dumbfounded; with the sheer amount of information given to him, he’s a bit taken aback. Still reeling over his discovery about Cas, and the entire concept of Charles finding him work elsewhere—which as he thinks more on it doesn't quite make sense, why would Charles seek to get rid of him when in reality his work on the farm has been exemplary save for the ending of his first week? And why would he choose not to mention it to him or his son when he had plenty of time to do so. Charles doesn't seem to be one to forget important business matters—never mind the decisions he’s now facing.
Sam shoots him a pointed look before he moves off the topic, “So, Jess was talking the other day about maybe finding a place to go on a trip to, and I need your advice.”
There's always been something about how blood flows whenever pressure is added that turns his stomach. Each step towards the house sends a small wave of blood streaming down his leg and he can’t tell if it's the blood loss or the general disgust towards the feeling that has him a bit woozy.
His alternate self saw the moment the realization happened. “I’ll ask again now that your head is out of your ass, if we both love him and he loved me what does that mean for him here with you?” He asked rhetorically.
“Castiel, what is it,” his father responds, setting the glass of amber liquid onto the desk with a sigh.
She starts for the door with Cas trailing behind her and Dean’s left to hobble his way down the stairs, good arm—despite the burn—on the railing to stabilize him and slowly makes his way to the barn. Cas’ ma was right, the leg
He looks over and sees his slate. Mostly erased etchings of his name written out again and again in practice. He had wanted to ask Cas to help him create a signature, but he supposes now that he’ll just write it out normally on his contract because it is the only way he knows how to do so.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Well then,” Sam says breaking them both from their thoughts.
“Goodnight Cas.”
The focus on a violent love turns him off from the song but there’s a pull in his mind with each iteration of “
He stops as a horse approaches in the distance. The rider shouts at him but is still too far off to make sense of the words. So he waits, placating, passive, and unassertive. As the rider nears he puts on his prettiest face; the face that he knows people like most. It gets him things—food mostly; or sometimes a bed for a night, it’s gotten him a job once or twice in the past too—and it’s enough to distract from the scars that litter his face. This mask of an expression hides the truth of him better than any words could.
It never fails to put a smile on his face when they attempt a rescue effort, Bobby is admirable and probably is encroaching on ‘better father than his father ever was’ territory—if he wasn’t already securely there—but the man can share stories until his
He takes one more look at her as he turns to leave, smiling at the way her face scrunches as she sleeps.
The request is simple. Play messenger. The irony isn’t lost on Castiel that he’s asking Gabriel, who's named for the messenger of God, to relay his letters to his siblings.
Perhaps he is preparing himself for the days after Castiel's siblings arrive, knowing that he’ll be taken away from their work together to visit with them.
Dean works until both sides of Cas’ shoulder are dwarfed by the fabric and gauze; the pads pressed tight against the holes soaked in antiseptic.
It’s slipped well past midday, the sun bleeding into the west sky, before Dean’s in the stables, he checks each of the horse's shoes and sets to work on cleaning and trimming where needed. He takes Ibby for a thorough run but doesn't continue on to starting him on machine tack, reasoning that Cas or Charles should be part of his breaking in.
He looks back as he walks to the house, hoping to catch Dean’s eye, but each time he’s facing away and each time it’s just as disappointing.
Cas looked at peace when it came for him, and it ruins him to know that. To know that loving him brought him to the one moment of true happiness. Loving a worthless, broken, fucked up killer—
Dean has two modes when he's lost someone, determination or shut down.
If it was Cas who said that he would have added the little quote marks around the obviously sarcastic part of the sentence. But Cas isn’t here, and no matter how small a thing, Dean is desperate to see him make those stupid air quotes again.
them, they’d be insurance for the other horses.”
Unbidden a memory surfaces, he’s twelve, Sam barely eight and the latter has just come home from school with a trick to show him, it's blazing hot in the valley, far too hot for him not to be sweating but Sam shows no signs of issue with the heat.
In the same moment that fear hits him when Lucifer’s face is what greets him on the other side of the door a knife drives itself into his heart.
He wants to drink in all he can of Dean before he leaves, he wants Dean to remember him even if it’s just of this. So he leaves bruises in the shape of his fingertips on Dean's waist, leaves a stubble raw chin, neck, stomach so Dean feels it all sting, leaves him breathless to make a lasting memory, he tugs sharply at the strands of hair at the top of Dean’s neck, pinpricks of pain he hopes will stick around. He leaves the taste of himself in the back of Dean’s throat, leaves half-formed begs on his lips.
“Tell me you don't want me,” Cas cuts in. “Tell me this was nothing to you. That's the only answer of no I’ll accept Dean, tell me and you can go off and never think twice about the last two months.”
The door of the roadhouse clatters open and, in an ever-present form of sound association, he thinks of the farm and of Cas coming out night after night. Opening their front door to sit and talk with him; making him fall little by little, making him start to believe all that he does now.
“We should probably see about Dean, huh? Make sure he’s with us before we go through any of the proceedings,” Jody says with a smile.
“Sorry about the late supper, we got some bad news from the doctor today and Ma had a hard time with it,” Cas says walking into the barn and handing the bowl over. Their fingers touch again but he ignores the pull he feels much better than he did the first time.
Dean doesn't want to leave, he wants to stay here with Cas, as foolish as it sounds and damaging or disastrous as it could be, some force within him begs to stay with Cas as long as the man lets him. A force that has won out more often than not in the weeks that he’s been conflicted with it.
A few seconds before absolutely necessary, Cas takes his eyes off the house and stares forward, his hand reaches for Dean, seeking comfort, seeking assurance that he made the right choice, Dean doesn’t know. But he’s happy to provide whatever Cas is after. He extends his elbow, both hands occupied with the reins and when Cas’ hand settles into the crook of it, he feels him release the tension held within him. He goes so slack Dean has half a mind to think that Cas shook off two decades of tension with that action.
“I heard voices, and thinking I was the only one awake, I figured I should investigate. It seems though that I stumbled into a very intense discussion.” He looked at his Dean with a small smile, hoping that the man wouldn't run for the hills because he revealed himself.
It hasn’t been the easiest to have to keep that part of them silent for the most part here. Up at Jody’s, it’s fine, but in town, there are too many eyes, they both know that, but it doesn't make it any easier.
He never set out to be Dean’s friend because it seemed as though the man was in need of one. He was drawn to Dean from the very first day and he has been unable to do anything but allow himself to be drawn in. Truthfully, he hadn't even put up much of a fight against it. Had it been anyone else, he would have been ashamed of his actions, his inability to be rational and keep his distance, but he couldn't feel anything but warmth when he was around Dean.
“Mister,” Inias pipes up, “can you tell us the story about the coyote?”
Dean ever wanted. “You can’t hide this from yourself any longer, not when you are literally face to face with the one person who knows your full of shit.”
“No need,” he says tersely, as he swings himself up onto the saddle, gloved hands gripping the choke and then the reins as he settles into the dip of the leather. “I’ll be fine on my own, Sir.” Dean barely waits a second before he’s kicking Remy’s flank and riding off to the fence line leaving Castiel stunned where he stands.
“Dean?”
So Dean keeps talking, until his throat gets rough with use and his brain fights to pull new stories, happy stories or at least non-traumatic ones, up to share.
“I’m safe Dean, you kept me safe,” Cas says as he knocks their foreheads together, their arms still encircling each other, keeping them close.
He doesn't want to do this, doesn't want to expose himself but it's the only way he can think of to make Dean understand.
Dean manages to wedge himself, albeit with a lot less stability than he would like, against the high post of the stall and the hatch door, his knee on the top of the door and his other foot is swung into the stall and rests in the middle of the wall on the fence rail with only his heel planted on the thin strip of wood.
He has no clue how the fuck he is going to get off this land. Perhaps after Cas’ older siblings leave again. He thinks that if he were to leave just after his supper was dropped off, he’d have maybe nine hours to put distance between him and the Novak’s farm. Hopefully, that would be enough time for him to disappear again if he was on foot.
He can’t say he’s overly surprised with Gabriel’s motivations; in fact, he quite admires them.
Cock the gun, balance the weight, shift for the best sightline, hover over the trigger, pull. Once, twice, three times. The bullets sink into a trunk yards off from the one they’d been using. He used the three bullets left but he learned to always check and make sure that you had a proper count of your bullets so he checks the gun, an empty wheel, six spots waiting for metal and lead to take residence for a short time.
For all Dean has suffered in his life, it was a special kind of torture to live through the week after he had heard Cas’ lie to his father. Each interaction carved away at his hastily raised walls, and as angry as he was with Cas, at the situation he found himself in, he was even angrier at himself. Angry because he believed for even just a second that there was anything else behind Cas’ interest other than pity. Dean was most angry at himself, however, because try as he might, he couldn’t stop the pull Cas had on him. All week, as Cas spent his days inside with his family, Dean watched for the chance to glimpse him through the windows. Never before had he gone through a day's work so distracted. It infuriated him that he couldn't control himself enough to forget about Cas. That despite the betrayal, the man still held so much of his attention throughout the day.
“You’re safe,” Dean said almost to himself and then, “You’re human Cas.”
A low whine crawls its way out of his throat as he thinks about how Cas’ fingers would feel opening him, holding his hip and thigh bruising finger marks into the flesh as one, two, three fingers stretch him torturously slowly.
“Oh yes because that always goes over well,” Castiel responds sarcastically.
“What about your name?”
“Sam had his records by then because he was getting ready to start in at school, but I didn’t. One day one of the ladies that worked there came up to Sam and me and said that someone wanted to adopt him, without records I didn't have much chance to get out and they weren’t looking to take me in as well. So that night, I grabbed Sam and we left. ‘S my job to look after him and I couldn't very well do that if he was off in some other city with another family.” It was more than he was planning on sharing, more vulnerability shown in a few scant sentences than he’s sure he’s shown since he was a child.
Dean’s about to reply when he catches a glimpse of Victor leaving, Dean waves and he waves back before he ducks out of the door.
Dean’s slowly making his way to ask Cas what ‘this’ is, too distracted with lust to think properly, but before he has a chance he feels the slick smooth head of Cas’ length press below his ass. His cockhead slips through the press of Dean’s legs and slides against his sack with each small thrust.
“Hey now, no need to apologize here, I tend to make conversation if I'm going to be spending the next ten hours with a person. It makes the time go by faster.” Cas offers another smile and his stomach flips at the sight. “And you gotta stop calling me Sir, I really do hate the way it sounds.”
He knows Cas will give in; it doesn't matter that they both know that really for Dean this isn't a cause for celebration.
“Yes Ma’am,” he says with a look to Cas. His eyes are a bit wild, he’s nervous as all hell. “Travelled all this way with him, I already know he snores, so it won't be a problem.”
“Cas?” It’s barely more than a whisper, possibly a prayer, definitely a plea. Though for what he doesn't know.
“Are you sure you’ll be able to handle going back there Dean? I mean what if it doesn't work? Can you handle losing him twice in the same spot?” His voice is so earnest it almost makes Dean want to lash out but he forces himself to calm down enough to get through this.
“Dean,” Cas starts, “there’s nothing around us… like at all,” he finishes in wonder.
“There are just some things in life that you know. I don't need, hell I don't deserve, to be absolved of anything. That was proven to me long before I stepped foot on this farm. It'll be proven to me long after I’ve left it.” He hasn’t ever said those words out loud before, not to anyone but himself, and the truth of them carves something ugly in his bones. His trust in this man scares him as much as it liberates him and he’s not sure what to make of any of that.
Cas starts up a brutal pace, pulling out almost all the way before slamming into him. Dean’s eyes roll back in his head as Cas grinds into his prostate every couple thrusts. The angle of their position spreads him open and his body lights up at the thought that he’s at Cas’ mercy; it does nothing but drive his pleasure higher.
“You lied earlier,” Cas says. “Back on the farm you said you were a decent shot; you severely downplayed your abilities.” He huffs, falsely indignant.
even ‘Cas I’ve taken notice of your interest in me and while I’m flattered, please know that if the advances continue they will likely make me uncomfortable’. Dean could take two minutes to set things straight but instead, he refuses to give Castiel any clue as to why he’s distancing himself, and he doesn't know how much more of it he can take.
His day moves along at a snail's pace. All he wants is for it to be after supper so he can spend time with Dean. From morning to lunch Castiel does little other than help his father with the books, it’s excruciatingly dull, Castiel swears upon anything that it’s worse than it ever was before, knowing that he could be outside helping Dean, teaching Dean, or even just being away from his father.
Balthazar, Inias, Alfie, and Duma, all come and he repeats sentiments, he tries to make sure that when he leaves, they won’t forget these final lessons he teaches them. That when they see the late afternoon sun stretch itself into the room, they’ll be reminded of him.
“Someone’s looking awfully introspective tonight,” Cas says humorously. He can’t even remember hearing the door open so there's no glib comment he can make, not that Cas expects a reply either way.
How can he still carry such innocence and belief in good things, still have such an openness to outsiders? The man is a contradiction on two legs and he wants nothing more than to figure him out a bit more. Just as Remy sighs in her stall—the only noise aside from night bugs—he decides that staying a week wouldn’t be the worst decision he’s ever made.
“We’re safe Dean. I’m okay.”
“I mean normally yes but, you don't seem to be one to reach out,” Cas sends a cheeky smile in his direction at the near murderous expression he knows has come across his face, “I am wrong? If I'm wrong please do tell me, I'll curb my assumptions in the future.”
“Oh absolutely, it’s uncanny,” Dean responds.
This poem does not fit into any specific chapter but does connect to the latter half of the original story
“Cas!” he calls, still a ways away. “You best not be messin’ with him, I told your Pa I was good with horses, don’t make me out to be a liar.” Closer now he can see Cas’ answering smile.
It turns his mouth sour to think that to live happily he may have to say goodbye to his family, his siblings. He knows that being married to a woman, that living out the life his mother wants from him would no sooner send him to his grave than drunkenly cleaning a loaded pistol. The older he grows the more clear it becomes that to be his true self, to not hide behind a woman who deserves better than a husband who regrets each step of their journey together, his contact with his family would become limited at best and cease completely at worst. He’s not foolish enough to think the former is the more likely option.
Worry eats into his chest about how Jody will react to his injuries. How she’ll react to Cas—and his injuries—showing up with Dean. If she thinks there's a risk involved with letting Dean work for her, will she break their contract? Can she even do that? He knows that there's a difference between hiring someone and hiring someone with a past like his. And considering Charles knows almost nothing of his life, he assumes Jody falls into the first category.
The sun dips low, brushing against the horizon just as Cas’ fingers brush against his thigh, the same warmth fills him from both, the same awe fills him as he sits and takes it in.
“Just fine by yourself huh?” he watches as Dean jumps, clearly not having expected to have anyone near him. Dean recovers quickly and turns marginally towards him.
He’s not sure when it happened, but somehow this barn had turned into a makeshift home. One that he's oddly sad to leave. Dean grabs the lantern and hauls his pack up onto his shoulder, tucking the blanket under the same arm—suddenly quite grateful Jody provided him with transportation aside from Ringer’s saddle. He sweeps his eyes around the space again, a ritual that’s long been part of his process of leaving, and with a final breath, he walks through the door.
There are no words for what he feels as he watches them. No way to describe the vice grip on his lungs and the smile painted across his face living at the same time as they currently do. No way to piece it together in his own head because this is it. These are the last moments, these are the last memories of them. He’s going to savour it; he’s going to remember it.
It barely takes a second for his mind to focus in on the only place Cas’ life has ended like that. His voice is thick as it leaves his throat but if any place is going to work it's this one. “What about where the rift was? Where Jack was born? I mean you saw what happened, you know the damage that was done.” He keeps his voice even, bordering on emotionless, hoping it’ll stop Sam from questioning his readiness to go back there. Unfortunately, it seems to do the opposite.
Their last night out in the middle of nowhere sees them half laying half sitting up beside each other against the tree behind them. Their fingers are interlocked as they lay in Cas’ lap.
“I would think you’re quite wrong there Cassie, putting your feelings aside so often; does it not cost you your happiness?” he says, his eyes focussed intently on Castiel.
“Dean, look at me, none of this is your fault, I made this deal
“I’m fine Cas, let's just keep going.” His jaw protests as he speaks, sharp stabs of pain rush through his head. He doesn't mean to sound angry; he doesn't mean to shut Cas out but he can feel it happening, one brush with something so reminiscent of his old life and he's slipping back into that other version of himself.
Cas hadn’t stayed long after that and once he did an emptiness moved its way into Dean's chest.
It wasn't like him to dream at all about such things but he’d let himself get swept up in it all without even being aware that he was doing so. The first night when he watched as Cas’ eyes trailed fire across his body from across the room, that's the moment, Dean thinks, that the ground started to pull from underneath him.
Dean doesn't look to the sky as his eyes fill again. Sam always said he needed to let himself feel. That ignoring your trauma isn't the same as dealing with it. But he worries that if he gives into it fully he’ll never resurface. Drowned in his own mind with the pain and regret, the fear and the sadness that washes in like the tide when his guard drops.
all of the people Chuck puffed away the day he lost Cas.
It takes about an hour after the dust has settled from the fight in the library for Jack to come up to Dean. When he does it’s with apprehension and tension settles itself into Dean’s shoulders in anticipation of what bad news the kid might be bringing.
He’s about to show them all—the children who have never known loss, heartbreak, grief—what it is to lose someone. He’s about to shatter all they know, shatter their innocence, shatter their hope. For all he’s taught them, he never thought he’d be the one teaching them about this, breaking their hope, their trust, breaking them.
“Difference here is that it
“You better not fucking die!” he growls, panicking. “I can’t fucking lose you, I just—please—I can’t.” He blinks tears from his vision, one or two trail down his cheek mixing with his own blood. The salt should hurt his cut but he can barely feel his own injuries.
I cried while I wrote the scene where Dean gets his name but that's mostly because I wrote almost twenty-five thousand words with a main character that had no name. So they were, at least in part, tears of relief.
“Sam and I used to do something like this, the lying here that is. When the weather was nice enough I’d take whatever we had to sleep on at the time and set it outside, we’d watch the sun fade away and he’d tell me the names of the colours that played across the sky as the hour got later and later. Then when it was dark enough and the stars came out, we would imagine them, what they were like, if we could touch them how would they feel, just like with clouds. Sam always said they were God’s angels looking down on us to make sure we were doing okay. I just saw the space, each one so small, so insignificant in the sky but together they made this picture that we could play within for hours. Sometimes we would just lay there in the quiet, Sammy always fell asleep long before I did, the kid could sleep just about anywhere,” he huffs a small laugh at the same time he realizes there's moisture in his eyes. He doesn’t move to get rid of it.
“Yes, it was quite the experience, but luckily it hasn’t happened since, well it hasn't happened much since.” Cas knocks their hands together and a thrill runs through him when Cas places his hand on his leg beneath the table, a claim that only they know about, yet still it's enough to settle them both.
Connects to chapters 17 and 18 of the original story
He tucks his head against Cas shoulder, mirroring his position and just breathes. When he feels Cas release his shirt, he knows the moment has passed with no regard to his wish to live in it forever.
“After supper? Or will you be able to get out of the house before then?”
When he wakes again Cas is running a hand through his hair, brushing it off his forehead and spiking it up with a fond expression. He blinks several times to try to dislodge the fuzziness of sleep but eventually, he keeps his eyes closed, content to stay in sleep’s clutches.
Something hideous rears its head in his chest, and staring at the letters, staring at the name. He always deserved more than Dean could give him, than this world could give him. He deserves more than a scar in some bark in a forest hardly anyone treks into. He deserves more than to die without knowing—to die thinking he wasn’t loved.
He remembers the malicious smile on Chuck's face that night, as he’d begged for Cas to be brought back even if it meant he died. How he told them that this was their new story. That he didn't care for Cain and Abel anymore. He just wants them to suffer, slowly, alone more and more every day.
He mirrors the action again, hoping to show Cas that he’s there, that he understands how hard it is to go through what he’s going through. Seeing no better or worse time he takes a breath, preparing for the likely possibility that Cas rethinks all of this and goes back to his family.
Dean sits stunned for a moment watching as Sam gets his heightened breathing under control again. When Sam seems like he’s not going to hyperventilate Dean figures it’s safe for him to speak.
“Uhh not exactly, they had a bit of a thing before she died years ago but when Sam got his hands on a spell from Rowena,” Dean paused a moment lost in the memory of yet another person Chuck forced them to say goodbye to, “Sam was able to resurrect her using the spell after that they fell back into old ways and things were looking really good for the kids, but nothing good ever lasts long for us and she ended up leaving because she couldn't tell what's real anymore,” He finished with a sigh, the conversation he overheard between the two of them as she said goodbye playing in his head, reminding him so much of the conversation he had with Cas that said almost the same thing, carried the same sentiments.
Jody whispers something to Donna that sounds vaguely like “same situation” before she turns back to them with—if it’s even possible—an even larger and warmer smile. Donna walks right up to Dean, he’s expecting a handshake so he’s quite surprised when her arms wrap around him, there's something about the hug that makes him think of his mother. Donna squeezes a bit and he wraps his arms around her, completing the hug and making something warm grow in his chest. He sinks into it a bit and sighs. It’s comforting to have something so reminiscent of motherly affection in his life, even for the short few seconds Donna hugs him. Donna pulls back and pulls Cas into a short hug too; he relaxes into it immediately and Dean can’t help the private smile that makes its way to his face at the sight. She drops her arms and takes a step back before walking back to Jody’s side. They talk privately before Donna turns back to them.
“Oh my, where is my common sense, I’m spending all this time with my ridiculous brother when his better half is standing right here!” he teases as he leans in to wrap Kali in a hug, it’s odd as he’s not sure he’s ever hugged a pregnant woman aside from his mother—and that was five years ago—but it’s still nice.
By the same time the following day, after again spending it apart due to the presence of Cas’ family still being on the farm, they’d seemed to have come to a mutual understanding, one that didn't require the flask to incite action. Though it was only regarding the continuation of their dalliances and spoke nothing of the feelings Dean continued to spend so much of his time sorting through.
It’s maybe a bit presumptuous to reference so plainly the nature of their relationship, but Jody had already told him that it isn’t an issue to her so he tries not to fret on the slip.
Dean’s shocked silent for a minute, wondering how a person who grew up as Lucifer must have turned into someone who revolted against the entire establishment. He wonders if Lucifer ended up like him. Hell, Dean wonders if he had even met the man unknowingly.
Even if he did there was nothing about the situation that would be worth it, either Cas is looking at him or he isn’t and his mind is playing tricks on him—perhaps punishing him for even starting to get the slightest bit comfortable in this place—if Cas is looking at him there's no conversation that could follow that would be worth anything, good or bad. So he breathes out a sigh and focuses on his work, determined to let the feeling fade into the back of his mind.
It kills him to think of leaving, but he’s not going to stay for his own selfish reasons and ruin Cas’ chance at the life that he could have.
Quickly he takes stock of everything, the air isn’t crackling with the presence of another person. The horses aren’t baying in the stables. Nothing seems out of sorts.
He’s quietly proud of the progress he’s made, never one to boast about his achievements, but he can tell that Charles is impressed. It makes something sour churn in his chest but he can’t help but be proud that he’s proving Charles’ assumptions about him wrong.
these words, has spoken them a thousand times and yet he still can’t make the connection. He supposes that this particular feeling is why young children seemingly spontaneously lose their composure so often.
He finds himself flushed before he has a chance to stop it, “I can’t take all the credit, you and your pa helped, it wasn't just me.”
He forces himself not to cry though his eyes do cloud over with tears. It's at lunch, after a morning of playing and helping the kids with their lessons that he thinks
Day after day the confusion hits harder. Conflating the rituals of friendship—not that he knew those in any proper way—with the rituals of courting—again with what little he knows of them—all while they messed around under the cover of night. It all leaves him feeling lost.
Dean had no idea if Cas shared any of the softer feelings he had growing inside his chest, or if it was all just lust from the other man, so he pushed them aside. The last thing he wanted after the week he’d had was to end up without Cas again because he’d gone and allowed himself to imagine even a sliver of a happy ending. And so he tried to ignore the many times Cas caught him staring and replied in kind with a softer gaze of his own, one that Dean was sure was only shared between lovers and accepted anything the man saw fit to give.
“Never again,” he murmured against Cas’ lips, “I know how awful I've been to you and I will spend as long as you'll let me to try to make you know how sorry I am for that, but never again will you leave my side, not by my words or actions, I love you Cas and I swear to G- well no I swear to anyone but him that that will never change. Not even in death.” Dean leaned back in for another kiss, and when Castiel took control he sighed into his mouth lost in the feeling of him, neither man noticed that Dean’s double had come back, standing in the doorway, a smile that was equal parts happy and morose played out on his lips.
you feel incredible,” Cas says as he bottoms out, his ass resting high on Cas’ thick thighs, his toes curl as his mouth runs dryer.
When Cas asks him for things he knows, he eventually offers up ‘children's home’ to which Cas pauses.
“When was the last time you used it?” Cas asks as he crouches near Dean, eyes steadfastly trained on his bag as though he can see the gun through the material.
Dean’s on the cusp of sleep when Cas wakes beside him and tugs him in by his middle and burrows his face into the warmth of Dean’s neck. He barely feels the press of Cas’ mouth on the blade of his shoulder in his sleep addled state. Even still the tenderness of the moment reaches his understanding and though still mostly asleep, he turns. Cas hums as Dean rests his head against his collarbone.
By sundown, when the ground and the sun are just beginning to meet, they have made some obvious progress on the foal and as they leave, he hears the tell-tale sound of the cab coming near the farmhouse. Cas nearly runs from the stable to get to Remy’s side by the time she stops and he quickly sets on Charles, supposedly about the condition of his sister.
“Are you gonna help us with our math Castiel?” she asks as he presses a long kiss to her head.
The silence is stifling once the door to their room is closed. Dean is trying so hard to keep it together because he’s not sure if he’ll be able to stop if he lets it go.

“Of course, then he would go and find rifles and pistols and all manner of things in the bushes and nearly kill me with the fear of it all, laughing the whole time, mind you.” He’s gripping Cas’ shirt. When did he start doing that? “I’m half convinced he planted some of them just to rile me up, which then begs the question of where he found them in the first place. Now he’s off being someone our mama would have been proud of, he’s probably found a nice woman, a pretty thing with a brain to her. He always joked about it, marriage and all that, not unlike you, but I’ve come to think it was for my benefit. He was such a good kid, but I can’t help but think that he could have been greater if we hadn’t ended up like we did.”
Whenever he looks over at Cas he’s staring back with a hurt and saddened expression and each time he’s faced with it, it tears his heart in two all over again. God Cas doesn't deserve to be stuck with someone like him. Not when all he does is hurt Cas. Even him not doing anything is hurting him.
The day he lets himself recognize his choice, he’s both excited and apprehensive. Ringer can tell his emotions are off, he is more skittish and less cooperative. It does nothing to calm Dean down considering his entire draw for these people is his ability to work and train horses.
“Who’s that?” Sam asks, turned halfway towards the door watching the interaction.
Dean scoffs, “You're smart enough, I'm sure you can piece it together.”
“When I got to the empty it looked really scared right as I was about to blow up and then before Billie pulled me back out, it said that I made it
Dean and Sam get slammed across the room. Pain spreads through his side when he lands on the floor in a heap. At least that's more on par for how their lives used to be and hey what's another bruise or two.
“Okay Cas first things first, some basic information about pistols and guns in general. You’ve got six bullets in the cylinder, each time you pull the hammer another locks into place to be fired. The kickback is enough to jolt me so it’ll send you spinning.” Cas sends him a withering look at the blatant over exaggeration but doesn't interrupt.
It’s about a month after the successful ritual that he hears the song again, a fluke video on ‘autoplay’ on the youtube tab Dean keeps open for him. Let me give you my life. Let me give you my life. Cold fingers dance along the hairs at the nape of his neck, blood covers his hands, a redo, a trade-off. Let me give you my life. And then a trade again, Dean to him this time. Let me give you my life. Good god, let me give you my life. The weeks spent ruminating over the line make sense now, as though some deep part of him always knew of the choice he made that night, the choice to save his love, the choice to give his life for the only thing that ever made him feel alive.
When he sees the open door his footing stumbles briefly; suddenly struck with the image of the man from earlier in the day, and the thoughts that had run through his mind and he is now far more nervous than he would have thought at the prospect of meeting the man.
“Di—did you know, I can't ride horses,” a boy, Uriel he thinks, says next, his face and voice so serious for a child. Dean can’t help but smile, he’d forgotten how kids just switch topics without a connection between them.
Cas sends him an odd look, partially amused, mostly confused.
“You really think we need that?” he asks, amused.
Cas’ eyes light like fire as he stares down at Dean. The thrill of his position coupled with Cas still grinding against him and stroking them together sends him careening towards the edge faster than anything has before.
He gives up and turns in early after saying goodnight to his siblings, both sleeping and awake. As he lays in bed, he’s lucky enough to have his mind quiet for long enough to let him fall asleep, a small thought surfacing as he slips off that he’ll get to spend time with Dean tomorrow and his brother the day after.
Sam concedes with a roll of his eyes and ambles around the table as Dean stands.
Still a ways off, two men approach, the sun makes mirages on the ground in front of them and Dean can’t get a good read on them because of it.
God, what has he gotten himself into, his one reprieve from his family and he managed to get his father to keep him from it, likely at every turn.
Eventually, it comes time to talk about the farms themselves; the staff, the work, and where they are located. Dean knows that if he’s going to accept this job, he’s going to want to work on the farm closest to Sam. With his newfound ability to write to Sam if he so desired, he'd like to be close enough for the letters to be delivered in a timely manner.
Kate who made good on the second chance she was given, everyone left from apocalypse world, even the oddball Sam and Dean from the Kia driving, private plane owning, man-bun wearing universe, the fucker even goes after Jerry from their fourth case all those years ago which really is just pushing the envelope.

“I found it a while back, but it’s a Smith & Wesson, that’s all I really know.”
“Sorry Sir,” he stops and shakes his head as he breaks the only rule he made. “But I’m not sure if I can do that.” He tries to fight instinct but he can feel himself getting smaller under the gaze of a man with so much more than him, “I—well it's a bit of an odd name, I mean no disrespect of course, it's just that there's a good reason I named Sam, Sam y’see...” He leaves the sentence hanging hoping the man can fill in the end of it. He recounts every time in his life he has come across someone whose name he couldn’t use, most of the time he would make a name for them, but this man was essentially his boss and he knows better than to do that for him.
“We knew from the start that this life was one of loss, Sammy had a bit of a harder time keeping the want for that cookie-cutter life out of his mind.”
“You know you’re pretty fucking dense, if in my universe and yours we both love Castiel and in my universe Castiel loved me, what does that mean for your universe’s Castiel?” His counterpart asked clearly beyond exasperated, at least he got that right without even having to look.
A day passes and nothing, not a peep from Chuck, not an animal on the earth. Dean feels his hope draining, feels that long known pull towards a decision he can’t come back from.
The day Cas’ family left, save for Gabriel and his wife, was the first day in more than a week that they had spent mostly together. Dean wasn’t sure that night if the decrease in work completed would be noticed by Cas’ father, he also wasn’t sure if the reddened lips of his son’s mouth and stubble raw chin would go unnoticed.
“He says I need to stop making jokes to cover it all up but that's all I know how to do. I mean you can’t mourn your mom if you have a baby brother to take care of so you joke. You can’t talk about what the internet says is PTSD because there are monsters to hunt and people to save so you joke. You can’t let yourself be vulnerable because that means death so you joke. You can't tell your best friend what you need to so you joke. You hide behind something safe because no one wants you to show what's really there.” Dean's mind is a mess right now, jumping from one point to another, skipping ahead and falling behind. He has so much he wants to say and it’s like he’s trying to say it all at once.
“I’d put money on it, hey I heard him talking to Eileen earlier on the phone, did it happen here too? Them getting together?” Other Dean asked with a look that was slightly hopeful and full of a feeling Dean knew all too well ‘I want to see Sam happy’ even if this wasn’t his actual brother.
They turn to leave talking and laughing with each other, if he thought he had a chance he’d be running after them but he knows it's better to cut his losses. He could always kill them but the mess of that is too great if he doesn't really need to.
“If that's what you'd like, then yes I think talking is a good idea.” Cas stepped closer and Dean had to stop himself from falling into his orbit as he so often did.
as was the body it was attached to. Spinning around, now on two steady feet, he came face to face with Cas. He’d dropped his arm possibly a second or two later than necessary and the space felt cold in its absence. When Dean’s eyes focused in properly, he found himself a few inches away from Cas’ face. He was so close that he could feel the lightest touch of Cas’ breath on his cheek as it crossed the distance between them.
The memory of their kid dying wasn’t ever one that he wanted to remember but he nevertheless did. He was plagued by the deaths, and often repeated deaths, of those closest to him, the nausea that had riddled him since he woke up in a hospital bed to the news that his father had traded his life in for Dean’s swelled in his stomach and throat.
It’s heartbreaking to think that regardless of whether his mother gets her way or not he will be leaving at some point, and he will miss out on them growing and learning and becoming their own people. He worries how Anna may grow up, hearing their mother speak so often of a woman's role, or how his father's stoicism when faced with anything but peevishness or anger, may lead to Alfie not knowing how to express himself properly.
Truthfully, he can't recall a day since Dean’s accidents that he’s asked explicitly to work alone.
“You think my name should be Valley?” he asks with sincere incredulity.
“We can do that, but I’d like to know more about your approach to training, how you went about gaining his trust and starting him on the drills to teach him all that he knows now.”
The sounds and the silences that filter through the closed windows are broken only by Cas minutes later.
He knocks on the wooden frame, out of respect because the man has no way of knowing that he is arriving with his meal but heats with embarrassment for the act immediately so he rounds the corner of the frame as the words that were just beginning to form die on the man's lips. His eyes search his face quickly and he curses when he realizes his earlier assumption was correct, he is the single most attractive man he has ever laid eyes on.
“Right around supper,” Dean replies with a smile and a wave as Victor heads on his way.
Cas had grown happier with his sister home, Dean suspected that with the family's history, a sick child was bound to be tough on him no matter the fact that it wasn't his fault, that neither of them was his fault.
“He’s got no one, Pa. I figured it was the least I could do to be a friend to him. He’s been alone all his life, he almost seemed desperate for it.”
Neither is sure as to when his father is set to return, so they head back to the foal and take him out again running through routines like they know of nothing else. It's not short work per se but the time moves quickly and before long Castiel is working up the nerve to say goodnight to Winchester, trying to work past the part of him that doesn't want to say goodbye yet.
“You have an important day tomorrow, likely so do I with all the records that will need to be updated once you’ve signed the contract. We should both get some sleep; it wouldn't do for us to be tired on such a busy day.” Cas is standing by the time he finishes, intent on leaving as soon as he can.
Castiel says nothing for a long time. His jaw works itself over, his face mars and clears in odd cycles. Now and again he’ll look up at Dean, study the man, search his eyes for god knows what, before dropping or averting his gaze.
“What’s your name boy?” the man asks, eyes wary still but kinder than they had been.
“You never gave me a chance to respond, didn’t even give me a damn moment to process any of it. And you’re a selfish son of a bitch for that because that wasn’t fair, that wasn’t—I
He doesn't always go alone either. Sam takes trips to the tree by himself sometimes but mostly he goes when Dean does. Jack trails after him every once in a while too but they usually let him go alone.
Here we go with chapter two!
He can hardly keep them all straight. Charlie was sweet, he knows that, Meg seemed to eye up Cas with immense interest, the group of young women blended together but he’s reasonably certain one was named Krissy and another Kaia. A man named Aaron sat beside Garth—who according to Jody is the town's dentist for both humans and farm animals—who talks so extensively about his wife that Dean doesn't learn a thing about the man from his own mouth.
He peers between them to find Cas’ length and strokes it as Cas shudders under him, curses falling softly from his lips.
“Ya I got it about a week ago, right after I asked her father. I had little doubt that he would deny us allowance to marry but the assurance was still calming. The ring is simple, Jess said she wanted it that way and I got a chain with it for when she’s working so that it doesn’t get dirty,” Sam says excitedly.
Above him, Dean sucks a ragged breath through clenched teeth as he takes in the sight of Castiel on his knees for him. The knowledge that it causes Dean such intense arousal emboldens him.
They’re silent a moment, just looking at each other as they’ve taken to doing far more openly since they set things straight. Cas visibly brightens a moment later, remembering why he came to the barn in the first place.
Instead he says, “I came from a way’s over, felt it time to move on.” around a mouthful of food. His company has a kind smile and way about him that he enjoys a lot after nearly two days of travelling alone.

“How did you—did you know this whole time?”
“Did you want to feel different?” he asks. His hand comes up to hold Dean’s, he’ll never understand why such a simple gesture causes such a reaction in him.
He wakes, as Charles said, to the crowing of the roosters and sighs, stretching the stiffness from his body. Remy makes a huffing noise a few stalls over, it seems she’s an early riser as well. He realizes belatedly that she is the only animal sharing this space and figures this must be a storage barn of sorts. He hadn't gotten a good look at the property the day before, content to only take notice of the house, barn, and stables, not registering the possible uses of the other buildings.
He’s strategically avoiding the word ‘wife’. He ignores his own mind's insistence on reading into Cas’ wording.
He’s struck quite dumb by what he’s faced with. Not brown, not anywhere close to brown, but
Some days he can still feel the phantom pain around his body from injuries left just a bit too long without being dealt with. The memories cause something to clench in his chest, the worry he’d felt still fresh even years later.
“You sure Cas?”
“I never put thought to it, only ever knew life as it was and I never had a moment to spare on thinking about something I could never have, it wasn’t worth the time, Sammy though, he got what he wanted.” A smile graces his face, pride bubbling in his chest and filling in part the ravine.

This is kind of what I want to see as the ending of Supernatural, the chances of me getting it are low so I wrote it myself instead😁
and in its ask post form
He knows how fond his expression must be by now but he has no want to do away with it. And though there are so many things he could comment on instead, he finds himself saying, “I love you too.” It doesn't scare him anymore, it’s second nature by this point, it’s as sure as anything, it’s carved into his bones and he wouldn't want it any other way.
“As long as you understand that, you’re in the clear Castiel,” Kali says with a mocking smile at Gabriel, though there’s no heat behind it.
The next few hours were a whirlwind of emotions, of hugging, and of talking. Anyone and everyone that was close enough stopped by the bunker once they had learned that Dean was okay. He was shocked - but not really - to see Eileen back within the bunkers walls, with Chuck gone she didn’t have anything to fear her actions were not her own anymore.
“I’ve had a lot of practice, years of it before Alfie was born. It helps when the younger kids see the older kids doing as I say, though truthfully, I don’t like the role I often have to take with them. I want to be their brother, not a third parent.”
He stops himself from wishing he could be enough for Dean, reminding himself constantly that that's not really why Dean is leaving. It’s not that Castiel isn’t enough, it's that there is a force in Dean that puts Sam above everything else. He won’t try to keep Dean here, but Castiel knows that if Dean were to ask, he’d go with him with little hesitation.
“You're impossible, you know that don’t you?”
Dean nods his ascent and they fall into silence. He’s comfortable in it, it doesn't seem to stifle him or cloy to his skin and lungs as silence so often can. He wishes abstractly that he could see the sky.
“Dean, you have nothing to be sorry for… aside from shutting down these last couple days. Though now I understand why that happened, you can’t expect me not to be upset when you act like that.”
He hears his father come in through the front door by the noise of his siblings, tripping over each other questions flying and just as easily being avoided by his pa, he can picture the scene: his father walks in huffing and shrugs his jacket off hanging it on a hook and placing his hat atop it, it makes something squirm in his stomach, something that feels like annoyance and regret mixed together nearly indistinguishable from each other. The rote nature of his life has never been something he’s fond of and yet it’s the only one he knows so attachment lingers regardless.
“I don't need your pity, Cas!” Dean says rushing up to him, anger clear as ever in his voice, “I don’t need it and I don’t need your fucking friendship so you can piss right off for all I care. I’ve done plenty fine on my own and I sure as hell don’t need some dick who thinks so highly of himself for being nice to the kid who’s been alone all his life to pretend to care about me.” Dean’s shouting now and all Castiel can do is stand there. “You think that what? Y-you give me a name, treat me like you would anyone else, gather up every piece of me that I’ve never shared because of this exact reason and go and share it with your family? Laugh about it by yourself? Use it against me the instant you can? If that’s friendship, I can assure you that I'm not as desperate for a friend as you think I am.”
that is, than he’s done since he was a child. Messes of emotions war within him, getting stronger day after day. It's exhausting, he thinks, no wonder young children need so much sleep. Already, he feels as though if he were to rest his head on his pillow he would succumb to sleep within a few minutes. And yet he doesn't stop despite the exhaustion, he can’t stop, any attempt to ignore the emotions seems to strengthen them as though his mind was hell-bent on making him relive a reality that isn't his yet.
Hannah only smiles wider and he snorts a small laugh as he makes his way back to the schoolroom.
This page too is proper, Jody knows what she’s doing. Castiel never doubted that, but he also doesn’t know how many hands had a part in making this contract, and he’s not about to let Dean make a mistake with this simply because he didn't do his due diligence.
“Are you any good of a shot?”
If the paper of Sam’s first letter was anything to go by, receiving a letter from Dean, written by him, signed with his name, had brought him to tears. He’d insisted that he would travel up to the farm to see him, and no matter how much Dean feared for that reunion, there had been nothing to stop Sam, not that Dean had really wanted to stop him, he’d just worried what Sam would think of him, how Sam would react if Cas came up.
“Jody is back tomorrow, are you—do you have your answer for her yet?” Cas asks after several moments of silence; a lull having found its home in their conversation.
“I’ve got thirteen brothers and sisters, I bet it’s nice not to have your parents calling you all types of names that aren’t your own,” he says with a glance back at the house, he can’t tell but the man looks troubled somehow, his eyes dark, not from the dim lighting, but from something deeper inside him.
finally?
“Fuck.” Is all Cas can manage to respond with.
“Can I come by tonight with your supper?” he asks, hoping beyond anything that this wasn’t a one time thing or that Dean doesn’t think it a mistake.
The relieved smile Castiel gives him is bright enough to light up even the darkest corners of him, reaching all the way to the recesses of his mind. He can’t help but think that maybe it was worth living through all the worst if it led him here.
“Cas,” Dean whines as tremors rock his body each thrust pushing him deliciously to overstimulation.
“It costs me nothing to be as such,” Castiel replies. He can tell that the nature of this conversation is vastly different from most he has with his brother, Gabriel’s wording alone tells him more than anything, no banter or joking, nothing like his brother's usual manner of speaking.
The truth slips out faster than he would have wanted it to, a truth that only Gabriel is privy to but his face doesn't speak of mocking when Castiel falls back to reality from which he didn’t know he had left, the dream of teaching slipping into the back of his mind again.
Dean’s life hadn't been one of joy, years spent sleeping with one eye open to keep him and his brother safe, trading whatever he could—labour, food, what little he had that people may want—so that he could afford things for Sam. Taking whatever job people would offer him to scrounge up enough money to buy clothes and school supplies. For years all he could do was pray that the next day would be better, that he would stumble upon even a small money pouch that had been dropped as people travelled or shopped. His prayers were left unanswered for so long he stopped believing that someone was listening to them. Sam however held his faith much longer than Dean ever had, he’s sure that even to this day his brother has that faith tucked warmly in his soul.
The bench shifts with his added weight, it's a familiar feeling, part of a routine Dean never could have imagined for himself.
He’s leaning against the railing when Dean walks in, arms half crossed on his chest, one hand plays at the scruff that's grown in on his chin. He stands up when he sees Dean. He has a question he needs to ask, but Dean can see that he doesn't want to ask it.
Cas bursts out laughing at that, head thrown back, eyes screwed shut, smile gummy as all hell. And as it does every time, that smile steals Dean’s breath right from his chest.
He gathers Uriel in his arms, so young yet so serious about so much of life and reminds him that he’s not to climb above the clothesline. That he’s incredible just the way he is. That his seriousness is a gift but that he shouldn't give up on the playfulness Castiel knows lives inside him. He tells him that there are going to be people who don’t like him and reminds him that no matter what their family is there for him.
As he’s making his way through ‘tch’, listing the words they worked through that used the combination, Cas returns. He has the slates tucked into a small bag along with what looks to be a few small books, they never made it to reading anything yesterday. Looks like Cas wants to change that today.
“It’ll hurt that’s for damned sure, you probably won’t be able to put much weight on it for a few days, a week maybe, your leg isn't the only issue mind you, the shoulder will stay in the sling, there's no two ways about it, and you’ll have to keep from using it as it heals, the body isn’t used to trauma like that and it won’t be much fun. Give it a week or so and you can start with using it again after the swelling has gone down.”
the entire thing becomes some sort of reverse heaven. Not as bad as hell technically (at least that's what the lore says) but instead of a highlight reel it's the angels or demons regrets played on repeat.
Sure Cas’ll never learn to dance but he’ll never smile again. He’ll never have the chance to memorize the words to the songs Dean showed him but he’ll never feel the sun on his skin again. Or laugh or cry or sleep in late. He’s never going to make another milk run, be it a monster hunt or an actual milk run. He’ll never watch another bee documentary or hug his son again.
Nerves of his own ricochet through his chest, not enjoying the suspended moment they have found themselves in.
He turns and leaves, his parents sitting in silence in his wake. A sort of smugness settles into him, his parents can hardly argue with him when it was his father's surety of the farms ability to function without him that—in their mind—is causing him to leave now instead of later.
He can't remember the last time he took a life with so little thought. He feels no remorse, no guilt as their groaning stops.
They practice more, Castiel speaking about how letter sounds go together, running through the digraphs, again and again, showing him how words like ‘shirt’ and ‘wheel’ work before moving to a few trigraphs. He struggles more with those because so often the same three letters will make vastly different sounds and so they decide to be finished for the day.
something that by all accounts shouldn't ever happen
“Ya sure,” he said sarcastically, “Your father was a fucking saint, mine was a drunk, and a mean drunk at that, he made it perfectly clear that love, that a good life was not something hunters were allowed to have especially not that kind of love- but that rule was for a different reason.”
Anger begins to outweigh the wariness in his bones as he flicks through the money.
Dean’s breath stutters out on a broken sob when Cas’ good arm loops around his upper back while his other becomes a steadying presence on his hip. It’s silent still, barely the sound of their breathing breaks the quiet of the rooms but it’s not stifling as it had been, instead it’s as though everything is on pause, allowing them to have this moment.
He pulls his fingers out and holds himself up, his palms flat on Cas’ chest. Cas teases his slightly stretched hole with the pad of one finger before dipping it inside. He burns impossibly hotter.
“God and I thought I had a fucking death wish. Okay new rule, no more offering yourself up to cosmic entities no matter what, you understand me?”
be able to have with a woman, he’s made friends before, has had a similar comradery with women, but there's a love that passes between Gabriel and Kali that he knows wouldn’t be part of his life if he had a wife.
“Duma sweetie, we’ve talked about this, I would like to keep all my teeth,” he pauses as he lifts her into his lap properly and figures he should yet again clarify, “in my mouth, yeah?”
“What has you looking like that?” Dean asks as he circles around Ringer, triple checking that he’s in the best shape he can be.
Well leave it to this kid to completely avoid what may be touchy subjects for others. Then again Dean can’t say anything about it considering he was the one to push so heavily for Jack to become the cosmic bomb. Guilt curls in his stomach remembering that, remembering how everything narrowed into such a small tunnel he couldn’t see the bigger picture. Couldn't see that it was Chuck manipulating him
“So tell me, did Cas get the position he wanted?” Sam asks after a couple of tense seconds.
Cas’ hips stutter with his admission and the brutal grind shoots sparks up his body.
Looking towards the source of the voice, Dean sees a young girl making her way over to the horse pen. Cas sighs minutely before he walks over to the fence line.
“Yes, but it’s not fair to burden you with it, I’ve been doing so since your arrival here and I’d like to think that we’ve become true friends, it’s not right to constantly complain about this to a friend.”
Dean sits up and shuffles away from the wall, the fact that his shoulder is wrapped and secure making the task much less painful than before.
He peppers Cas’ neck and the side of his face with kiss after kiss. Cas drops his face suddenly, tired no doubt, and it smacks loudly into his collarbone, surprising a laugh from him before he can check if Cas is okay.
Understanding, Cas thinks for a moment. “I was nine I think, we were in town and my parents had entered some store or another but I didn’t follow them in, content to wander. I trekked around and eventually found my way to an alley, buildings on either side of me, a verifiable maze, really, and I came upon a couple in an open doorway. Standing as if at a moment's notice they might need to break apart and flee. When I got closer, I understood a bit more. They were both men, and though my mind may forget, they couldn’t have been any older than I am now. They were kissing as any man and woman would. It was the first time I understood that I wasn’t the only one who felt the way I felt, the way I feel. That there were others, at the very least there were the two in front of me. They didn’t ever see me. I just walked back to the street and waited for my family to return, but something within me settled at the sight of them.” Cas is looking off above his shoulder when he finishes, lost in the memory.
The memory makes him smile, remembering how Sam’s smile had spread when he saw that the trick worked how proud of himself he had been, before it quickly changes, flashing into the sickening crunch of bone and a splatter of blood that drips and pools like a curse, like the clearest sign of failure on the ground. The panic claws at him again, phantom pain pours over him and he has to actively think of healed smiles again, eyes that shine despite the yellow surrounding them. A violent nausea settles in his stomach, so much so that he has to clench his jaw against the tightening of his throat.
“I trust that you remember what we went over yesterday?”
“We made it; this is the start okay? We are starting here together now.”
Dean barely has time to form a word of response before Cas says, “Goodnight Dean,” and slips through the door of the barn. He’d gone so quickly Dean hadn't had the chance to say it back.
“Don’t get me wrong, I love them and I can’t wait to see them again, but Gabriel was always there for me in a way they weren't. Beyond the loss of Gadreel, Gabriel seemed to know how to talk to me and show me he was there for me in situations I didn’t even know I needed support in.”
When Charles and Rebecca—which Dean finally learns is Cas’ mother's name, having not felt it his place to ask before—return, Dean gets the sense that their trip into town was successful. Charles mentions to him that an interested party will be stopping in at the farm to look at Ringer in the upcoming days. He’s worried about his progress now that a buyer is interested but with the short notice there isn’t much Dean can do to get Ringer into better shape.
like he’s never seen. Blue like the sky darkening with the promise of rain, like the water of a lake in mid-summer, water pure and deep, ready to swallow you up, granting you a calm that only floating gives to you.
Heat washes over him with each of Cas’ words. Never has a lover been so intent on praising him and it’s making his head swirl as the sincerity hits him.
Dean shoots him a relieved, thankful look before he picks up the pen again.
Dean lays there for a minute, maybe ten, taking stock of what's happened. His breath got knocked out of him when he landed and his vision is hazy at the edges, the ceiling of the stable swimming around, disorienting and confusing. One of his arms is pinned under his body, he thinks he must have rolled onto it before his body settled, but all seems okay with it. He moves his non-trapped arm to lift his body off the ground and shouts out in pain before he can even put pressure on it.
Returning to the house, he sits next to Anna at the table, an arm looped around the back of her chair talking to her as she eats.
“We have to turn around again, I know I said not to look back, but technically this would be looking forward, so if you desire one final look at the house you can Cas. If not, you can close your eyes, or just stare elsewhere.” He gets a nod in return and allows Cas to choose the best option for himself.
“Cas, I-,” Dean lets out a rough hum as he collects himself. This speech is going to be different. He can feel it, the emotions within him seem to grow choppy, spilling over the dam wall more and more and he just knows that whatever happens, he won’t be returning to the bunker whole.
Without Cas, he heads off and tends to the animals, opening the doors, filling the troughs and mucking what needs mucking. It's easy work, but it allows his mind to stray. To combat it, he runs through letter combinations, stuck on some of them from the previous day.
Jody shows up just after they’ve finished with their letters and they head to the stables as a group, though their time there is short, Dean is able to gather a feel for the space and how it all works and functions as a complete system.
He stands up best he can, easing his weight onto his bad leg and trying his best to straighten up from the hunched position his back has settled into while cradling his arm and shoulder, it's not lost on him that this is the first time meeting Cas’ mother in his week on the farm.
He thinks of Sam, how Winchester had recalled how often the boy tried to push his brother into schooling, about how next time the brothers meet the gap between them won’t be so insurmountable. He thinks about the parents who lost the chance to see their son grow, be it their fault or not.
Cas’ eyebrows tick up, “Do you want to switch?”
“I don’t think it's your place to disagree with my assessment of myself.”
Together they walked into the library where Sam and Cas were both sitting talking, heads bent over a book. He couldn't think of why they would be doing research now but he didn't ask. He got the smallest glimpse at a drawing of an angel in death, it’s grace swirling around it before the spine was snapped shut.
Cas sends him such a pleased smile that Dean feels the flip all over again. How he can make someone like Cas this happy is beyond him and he finds himself smiling in return because how can he not when there's so much fondness in his eyes.
Dean takes the head of his cock into his mouth; the pressure is blinding and the heat of his wet tongue along the underside of his shaft is beyond anything he’s experienced before.
He lets out an empty laugh, “Well living without a name sure as hell doesn't help, no one trusts a man without a name and that means that sometimes, unsavoury actions must be made, nothing that your sensibilities need to hear of mind you,” he says, hoping to lighten the heaviness in the barn.
“No no I like it, I like it a lot.” It’s a short admission but still, by the end of it, they have matching flushes on their skin. No one’s ever given him a name like that, and he’s too content to act as though he doesn’t love it.
“It almost worked too, but no Dean when I fuck you for the first time it’s not going to be on the ground. I’m going to wait until I can have you in every way I’ve imagined since the first moment I laid my eyes on you.”
“Here please let me help?” he pauses and waits for the nod before allowing himself to crowd in closer to help. He ignores the feeling, the odd clenching in his chest, when he lays his hands on Winchester’s, fiddling with the chalk to get it to rest on the ring finger of his right hand—it offers more stability than using the middle—and pointedly ignores the way Winchester’s breathing has changed since he moved close.
He’s never really talked about it to anyone except for Dean and Gabriel, but he truly loves to learn, the process of gaining new information, of making connections and furthering his understanding of simple and complex concepts excites him. To learn is to grow, and by growing he is ensuring that future generations of children, his or others, have a more solid foundation upon which to start their own learning.
Dean’s not sure when he heads inside again, or how he finds himself at the tree almost every day since.
“Does that mean that your Sam is gonna go on a nice run with Sammy tomorrow morning?” Dean asked as he plated some sweets.
“You’d really - “ Dean looked up amazed.
Minor warning that this chapter ends on a bit of a cliff hanger, it's also very, and I mean very long. If you're nearing what would be considered a normal bedtime for you it might be best to sleep now and pick this up again after some rest.
It seems that everyone just knows to leave them be as they eat quietly beside one another. The chaos around them doesn’t bother him, the noises and sights and smells of a well lived space filter into the small bubble that surrounds their table and he revels in it, the sense of being part of something; it’s something he wasn't even consciously aware of missing, and yet being part of this bigger picture, having been welcomed by all of the people around him despite the story that his face tells, fills a gap that had gone empty for so long.
Castiel smiles at her from the doorway before shouldering himself off of it to walk into her room, he stops at her head and leans in to press a soft kiss against the cool skin of her forehead, and the simple fact that her skin is no longer feverish sends warmth to his chest.
“Are you even able to avoid possible injury Dean?” Cas had asked looking at him with an odd mix of emotions that Dean hadn't had time to catch—though none were of anger or contempt—before he was bidding him a goodnight and returning to the house.
“Dean Winchester,” he echoes back barely above a whisper, he can’t seem to settle on any emotion for very long, he feels the burn of tears behind his eyes, the creak of his jaw as he smiles, the drop of his brows as his face falls, from relief or disbelief or whatever other emotion he doesn't know.
He doesn’t expect to be interrupted, more than content to take this moment of peace as his own, but rarely is it that peace lasts long.
“Yeah. I mean we don’t have the best track record with cosmic beings but if the empty wants that so badly and we can give it, it. I can’t see how that's a bad thing.”
“My father began to catch on to whatever it was we were doing, being friends of some kind, but I could tell he was keen on going after you for it, perhaps it’s his bias towards me, perhaps it’s not. I truly don’t know my pa well enough to tell you one way or the other. Dean, I had to lie for both our sakes, do you think that if I was truly being friends with you out of pity that I would have continued pressing so hard after those first days, and then again a week ago when you shut me out? I was trying to be your friend because I enjoy your company. Far more than I have just about anyone else in my life, and certainly more than I have any stranger I’ve met.”
He takes Anael aside and tells her that she has a light to her that deserves to shine. That no matter what her value doesn't lie in how good of a wife she can be. That married or not, he’ll still support her. Tells her that if she wants to learn that she should. Ma had a chance to before she got married and that opportunity shouldn't be closed off to her.
Cas sweeps his hands up to his shoulders and draws him in again. They are slower this time, just intense as before, but slower.
Cas looks at him as though he doesn't believe him, and he ignores his better judgement again as he begins, “The scars along my arm and legs are from pissing off the wrong people, in any number of ways. The ones on my head are from drunken fights that no one can remember who started; the crooked line of my nose takes its place in that list too. The ones on my face, the ones you’ve already seen, are from patrolmen, angry angry men who’ve got too much power held within a piece of paper, or worse, held in their finger balanced on a trigger, which is exactly how I got my bullet scars.” He stares as Cas willing him to understand that whatever pretenses he has about Dean are false, born from the mislead belief that everyone is good, that everyone is the recipient of poor fortune and not the cause of it.
When Cas says nothing else, Dean steps up to a spot with a good clear sightline to a tree a decent ways off. He pops the cylinder out and spins it as part of an engrained routine before clicking it back and thumbing down the hammer. With the gun cocked he takes his stance making sure all the while that Cas is paying attention. He throws a look to Ringer and then to Cas to let him know the shot is coming.
“Did my father talk to you about the days when my brothers and sister will be here?”
Cas ravages his mouth, gripping into his hair and manipulating his head as he pleases and Dean is more than happy to go along for the ride. The hand that's been twined into Cas’ hair moves to join the other still locked in place on Cas’ hip. He grinds Cas’ hips down against his rapidly filling cock and groans as sparks of pleasure shoot around his body.
There’s a voice in his head that screams at him to stop this, to find a way to guarantee that Dean will stay by his side, before the chill slices through him again. He’s nowhere near selfish enough to enact that wish, but beyond that, he hates himself for continuing to indulge in the broken up fantasy imaginings that come with the selfish and cruel thought that Dean should stay with him. That he shouldn't go to his brother, that Dean shouldn’t get a job that will ensure him money enough to support them both and a chance at a life that Dean deems worthy. A ridiculous concept to Castiel because he can’t think for a moment of anything Dean has done that would lead one to believe he’s living a worthless life.
I don't know if I was the only one to think that the location of the final fight looked way wayyyy too much like where Cas was killed at the end of s12 but I decided to use that and add it into the lore I made up for the spell.
He worries every second that it’s all Chuck's doing but always remembers, Cas never followed the plan, Jack was never supposed to be born, hell he was never even supposed to be good. Every action they have ever made with or for Cas was their own. And that includes this.
Perhaps Dean regrets his choice of farm, though Castiel can only think of one reason Dean would do such a thing, he assumes Dean must be nervous to see Sam again after so much has changed for him.
His reactionary nature screams at him to do something as the taller of the two walks past him, closer to the gig. Closer to Cas.
With one last look at Jack, he starts to pray, to whom he wasn’t sure. A prayer he hoped Jack could hear, a prayer that said
His voice is choked off, gone and replaced with pure unadulterated pleasure, but Cas groans as Dean sheaths him inside of himself.
“Dean… oh shit! What happened?”
He continues walking for some time, pausing only to divert down the rush of a valley he’s never known existed. Resolutely he keeps his mind from straying to what he’s left behind;
“Of course! We were beginning to worry about you, though now I see we had some reason to, we’re just glad you made it,” Jody says as she reaches out and, by some miracle, squeezes his uninjured arm reassuringly. “Now I reckon you both are eager to get yourselves settled, I’m going to show you to your boarding and I’ll let you unpack. Kevin will be by to get Ringer and take him to the stables and I'll introduce you to some of the staff in a couple hours if that's alright with you both.”
“So, in like fifty years?”
Dean’s laughter surrounds him time and time again, stupid jokes or meaningless bickering sets Dean off into peels of it. He looks at Castiel one time, his eyes gorgeous and open, unguarded and free of what so often burdens him, and his chest seizes again, but this time it’s like a bell sounds in his mind and for some reason he thinks,
It seems like a lifetime ago that Cas shared it with him that first night, he can hardly wrap his head around the fact that it's barely been more than two months since he packed up and tried to make a life for himself somewhere else. No one could have guessed that his life would change so completely, least of all him.
“You know Dean, I don't think I’ve ever met someone who laughs while in pain,” Cas says as he gently lays a hand on the back of Dean’s non-injured shoulder. It stretches from his fingers splayed on the flat bone of his shoulder to the heel of his hand on his ribs. He valiantly fights the shudder that tries to make its way through his body.
Cas applies some of the jelly unto the burns and wraps a square of gauze against it and uses some sort of strip to secure it to Dean’s skin. He watches as Cas’ ma does the same to the wrap on his leg before clapping her hands together and getting up from where she had been sitting through the whole ordeal.
The two of them start to go back and forth with each other about Dean to start, but then they switch and talk about law and teaching and plants and all manners of things, and Dean sits back, content to watch them bond even more.
Each line draws him in and pushes him away in equal measure, humor for Cas doesn’t mean laughing at a funeral it means Dean teasing him, tickling him, smiling as he waits for the joke to land on Cas’ ears. But still, they all seem to resonate beyond what he thought was possible, Dean was always met with disapproval, he always wanted to worship him in any way he could, even now he curses the moments they could have had together if only one of them had been braver before the night spent in their clearing.
“You look a vision with my cock in your mouth Cas,” Dean grinds out, his face scrunched in his pleasure. His breaths have been reduced solely to small huffs, cut off and pushed from his lungs with every half aborted thrust into Castiel's mouth.
“I’m not sure Ma, not yet at least, but I have some ideas, head out to a bigger city, find work, find my place in the world outside of the farm.”
Eventually, Cas says that Dean should get back to work—the ideal way to get kids to stop their sharing—and says that he’s going to walk back with Dean to talk to him about the rest of the day's work. He smiles at the obvious cover knowing there's no way for anyone else to pick up on it.
He doesn’t allow himself to second guess, craning his head down and pressing a gentle kiss to Castiel's forehead and when Cas looks up, he lets himself get pulled into a chaste kiss.
While he washes, he can hear the low din of the family through the door that separates the mudroom from the house proper. He’s not sure where Cas ended up but he doesn't hear the man's gravelly voice amongst the voices that make their way to him.
His arousal curls tighter in his groin with every press of their hips and flick of Cas’ tongue on his skin, in his mouth, and as it whispers filthy things into his ears.
He’s silent for a moment, willing one of his siblings to interject with something, anything so he can avoid this conversation for what must be the thousandth time, when no such rescue presents itself he takes as deep a breath as he can without letting on that he’s doing so—Ma and Pa always scold him and his siblings for sighing, it shows disrespect apparently—as he runs a hand through his hair and wishes he could look anywhere but his mother's face for this, “I appreciate that Ma but I’m sorely behind in my studies and with the farm and Pa needing my help, I’m not sure how I could shirk all of my duties for such an activity.” His family, understanding where this is going, sets about eating their suppers.
. Chuck driving him to kill his son
His musing carries him to bed and continues in the morning light. Uriel is already awake, but only barely, he rolls over and it takes only a few moments for Uriel’s faint breathing to even out again.
He spots Victor as he walks through the dining area and waves him over.
Dean watches, pleased, while he fights to get rid of it as they sit.
"I remember thinking about you after I made you leave the bunker. After my stupid fucking choices caught up with me. Every time I did I would feel sick all over again, just like I felt when I watched your face crumble, because the weather was getting colder and colder and you were alone out there. Without a home, without a family, and it was all my fault. I'll never understand why you seemed to forgive me for that. I'll never forgive myself for it." tears burn in the back of his throat. The strain of holding it all back shreds at the muscle and it screams with every breath he manages to shake into his lungs.
Hope you all enjoyed this little update!!
Cas joins him still in his work, spending a couple of hours beside him making sure that Ringer is making the most progress he can, but he’s quiet. Content, it seems, to let Dean fill whatever silence he feels he should. It’s not wholly uncomfortable, but Dean feels an edge in the air. One he could be imagining; one only he might feel.
He runs his hand over the mess of hair on top of Cas' head, remembering how desperately he had wanted to the first time he saw him. Every part of Cas he had discovered has far exceeded his expectations in the most damaging ways. He could get lost in the softness of the strands passing over the worn pads of his fingers, sliding over the raised scars that litter both the back and palms of his hands. Dean would happily fall into the blue of his eyes and allow it to swallow him whole just for a chance of the encapsulating stare to be set on him again and again.
“Hello, Sir,” Dean says, sending a sidelong glance to the man, his brown hair is far longer than what most consider appropriate, it reminds of how Sam’s hair looked last he saw.
He knows Cas is kissing his scars too, it's impossible not to with the amount of skin he's covering with the gentle press of his lips. He wonders if they add to the way Cas sees his body. He can’t imagine that they wouldn’t with how much attention Cas is spending on the skin behind his ear. The thought makes his breath catch in his throat. No one has ever really loved his scars, put up with them sure, ignored them even. But Cas isn't doing that.
Yes of course he ended up with some cuts and bruises as did Sam but early childhood playground wounds quickly turned to those requiring doctors’ visits, though they never actually went.
“He said that happiness wasn’t in the having, it was just being, just saying it and so he told me—he said he—” his throat burns again. Telling someone else somehow makes it all so real, makes it all the more painful and he just can't force the words out.
“Morning, sunshine,” he says in a gravelly rasp. The term of endearment makes his heart flip in his chest and Cas’ sleep rough voice makes a shudder run down the length of his spine.
Cas already knows that Dean would have stayed on the farm had he asked, he already knows that he’s the only person since Sam that Dean would give anything up for. He already knows that Dean is prepared to do anything to keep him safe, the fear that took residence in his heart regarding Cas getting hurt never fully left, will never fully leave either.
Kids are meant to play, they are meant to get roughed up now and again, having their siblings make them better isn't their job. Ma’s and Pa’s should be kissin’ knees and making their kids apologize not forcing them into facing the unseemliness of an injury. There's a reason you tell a child to look away from the cut or what have you, they are nowhere near old enough to handle that.
He walks up beside Dean and ignores the way his skin seems to excite with their closeness. He reads the first page, trying and failing not to let Dean’s writing hit him so squarely in the chest. He begins to worry about his ability to breathe for the rest of his life.
“That’s great, okay Dean, when you sign, sign your name but don’t worry about the date, the contract already has it written down, now there’s no start date for when you are to be working because we don’t know where you are headed yet and that’ll make a difference, it does, however, outline that there is an expected time for your arrival giving you anywhere from seven to twenty days to arrive depending on the farm choice.”
“You seem to think that my life on our farm has led me to know nothing of… repugnant activities,” Cas says warily.
Now he sits in the shade of the same tree he and Cas sat under during their first lesson, calmly taking in the sounds of the birds, the way the leaves dance in the breeze, and the shapes he can make with the elongated shadow of his fingers as the sun heads to rest against the horizon again.
Dean looks a bit like he wants to come back with something that would surely be a lashing out at Castiel, but he bites it back. The anger fades into shrouded sadness and Castiel thinks that it may not have been the noise that has Dean upset this morning. At least not only the noise. It’s possible that hearing his family is causing Dean to miss his own.
“Back before, when Jack was still in the empty and we were trying to get Billie to bring him back, Billie promised the empty peace and quiet right? Isn’t that what Cas said?”
“And you say
“Morning Castiel,” Jody calls as he exits the house, the heat of the day is already creeping into the baked earth and his shirt grows hot against the breadth of his shoulders, even the breeze it makes as it shifts is warm. Quite different from earlier that morning when he’d escaped to help Dean write his letter to Sam.
He’s never thought himself dumb enough to expect fairness from the universe, but this seems unjustly cruel.
He was careful not to leave any marks visible on Dean’s skin, mouthing more than sucking into the soft, tanned warmth, but Dean seems to be too lost in his own pleasure to have the mind to do the same as he kisses his way to Castiel’s neck, already sucking with fervour.
Cas’ family wouldn't let him leave, not until he was properly healed, and while he was sure that he’d be able to leave in the night as he had originally planned, they would likely send someone looking for him, perhaps at Cas’ insistence. That seemed to be simply the type of person Cas was, and he couldn't afford that when travelling on foot.
Dean’s answering smile, though fleeting, warmed him from the inside, replacing some of the chill that still lingered from his conversation with his pa.
He pulls the shirt off of Cas’ head and laughs at the tousled look his hair has gotten from the action. He runs his fingers through it to tame it, the strands play between his fingers and nip at the roughness of his palms. Their softness seemingly no match for the catches of his skin.
“I’d love to help you with math sweetie, what kind are we doing?”
He knows it’s to free his other arm so that Cas can help him from his prone position but his mind, ever the traitor it is, can’t help but flash to them in a similar position but for a vastly different reason, Cas above him, asking for permission to lay his hands on Dean’s body, the pain not coming from an injury but from a steady push into his body.
“Cas god would you—please just euh, Castiel,” Cas shudders above him and puts pressure behind his finger again making his eyes slip closed again. The fingers that are splayed against his hip dig into the skin and he knows that he’ll have a set of small crescents decorating the skin for some weeks.
he took them all and ran with them. He let them burn themselves into his ribs
Hours pass as they talk of this and that, stories of Dean’s time on the road, quips about the unsteady ground and Dean’s driving ability. He tries to keep the stories flowing to stop Cas from delving into the consequences of his actions. It’s not that Dean is afraid that Cas will suddenly want to go back, to return to the life he knows and loves. Although, if he did Dean would let him, it would break something inside him that he never knew he had to break, and it would raise the walls Cas spent weeks breaking down, but Dean would let Cas go.
DEAN!!!
“Goodnight Dean,” Cas calls quietly as he backs his way to the closed barn door. They both huff a laugh—though Dean does so far more forcefully—when Cas’ back ends up against the wood. He shakes his head as he opens the door before stepping into the well of the door.
It’s obscene, watching his achingly hard cock pass through the channel of Dean’s taut mouth, watching as Dean gives himself over for Castiel’s use. He feels the stirrings of his climax low in his groin, feels it creep its way down to his balls. His breath is punched from his lungs again as he watches Dean’s eyes roll back into his head whenever he is a titch overzealous in his thrusting.
“Ma, I don’t want to get married, at least not now, I want to set a path for myself, I can worry about all of that later. There are more important things in life than just finding a wife and having kids. I mean can you say with certainty that the path God has laid out for me is confined to that and that alone?”
A thrum of nerves takes root in his chest as the man gets closer. He despises having to wait like this. He feels like he’s completely at the mercy of the person walking towards him. It sets his teeth on edge and his fists clench at his sides of their own accord.
, clearly I'm not above a meta (ish) reference.
None of them had thought that the future of the farm would land in anyone else's hands. Michael was the most logical choice, he’s the eldest, his schooling brought him far more knowledge of business and management than any of his other siblings, and, though Raphael would fight it to his last breath, Michael was the most mature and reasonable of his older siblings.
“Today’s all about you learning the way about things here, your responsibilities and the like.”
The only line that actually sinks in after that first listen is “
No one younger than Castiel remembers Gadreel, Anael was nearing three when he died and Hannah still wouldn’t come along for another two years. But they all grew up in the wake of the loss, with the same parents who changed after his death, though none of them had the frame of reference to recognize the difference.
Cas had walked in and sat with him just as he usually did before the misunderstanding. They talked as Dean ate, as they usually did, but when his meal was over and Cas brought the flask to his lips, Dean heard himself swallow audibly and found himself moving closer to Cas. Cas in turn had shuffled his way over as well, he mentioned that he couldn’t stay too long, what with his family up in the house waiting for him, but Dean hadn't cared, he’d pulled Cas into a commanding kiss, savouring the growl he was gifted in return for his sudden and enthusiastic advances. He’d climbed into Cas’ lap and within minutes they were bare from the ass up, chests heaving, lightheaded, cleaning themselves up best they could.
He offers a smile in return, a real one and says, “I’ll see ya Cas.” before he slips through the doorway of the barn and disappears from sight. A stifling quiet blankets the farm in the wake of his absence and Castiel can only escape it by retreating into the lion's den that is dinner with his ma’s pestering.
His heart is in his throat as Cas’ eyes focus on him, the small smile that flits across his mouth seems to stab him through his chest. Cas might die, he might die because he didn’t act faster. It’s his fault, Cas is bleeding out on the ground and it’s all his fault.
With the last town fading into the distance, plenty of food and supplies and Ringer ready for it, they head into three days of wilderness.
Mrs. Baker is in fact Mildred Baker from season eleven and Ms. April is April, the reaper from season nine. Also, I know Inias is in a male vessel in the show but to make the tally of boys and girls more even I wrote Inias as a girl (this means that like Cas and Gadreel, Balthazar and Inias are fraternal twins and not identical twins).
Cas pulls him in close as he continues to sleep and Dean smiles as warmth blooms in his chest. Things aren't perfect, Dean knows that he hasn’t properly addressed his actions over the last few days; but lying here with Cas right now, he doesn’t see an outcome where Cas doesn’t eventually forgive him for all the wrong he’s done.
The steps get louder, then they stop, their owner hesitates, they quiet down as they walk away from the barn, but then their owner turns back and walks closer to the barn door.
“Do you have a name at all?” Of course this question would come, it always does but that doesn’t stop the curl of acid in his stomach, the one that speaks of shame in a way nothing else has.
Cas’ awed gaze never stops, but he does seem to remember himself after that. His hands reach out and run up and down his thighs as he strokes Dean’s straining cock in time with his own. Dean gets ready for the next and thrusts a second finger deep into his hole as Cas strips his cock with a twist of the wrist right at the bottom of his crown. He fucks up into Cas’ fist and back down onto his fingers.
“Of course Castiel, I’m sure if you so desired you could use the heel of your shoe to sign it as long as it’s signed by our witness.”
While his and his sibling’s lines continued to climb, Castiel can’t help but think of how Gadreel’s initials stay securely at just below waist height, the little five next to his final line etched into the painted woodgrain a cruel marker of the life his brother never got to live.
“Could you not take one of the horses here?” Dean asks.
“I was right the other day when I said you have a hard time letting someone be your friend, even Ibby can tell something’s up, can’t you boy, he’s full of it isn't he?” Ensuring Cas isn't looking his way he makes an exaggerated eye roll, tossing his head back slightly at how over the top Cas is as he croons at the foal.
The man he’s facing has a disturbing smile on his face, sickly sweet but darkened with mal intent, worry curls in his stomach. Nothing about this sits right with him.
He looks down, bereft. He had hoped the man would start with a question he could answer; hoped he could make a good impression before the sour truth was shared.
Cas peeks at him though his face is downcast, he studies him for a moment, enjoying the gentle sweep of Cas’ eyelashes along his brow bone.
He tries to talk now, he tries to do the same as what he did at his father's grave all those years ago trapped in a djinn dream, trapped in a world that seemed so perfect until he peeled back its layers. Kinda just like the one he actually lived in.
“My father may expect a name for the books, the records for the farm are quite detailed. Is there anything we could call you by, just for the books?” Cas questions and he’s struck with a memory from years ago.
He worries they may be insurmountable, the pain he’s lived through too much to ever come close to matching Cas story for story. But Cas doesn’t seem to mind.
“Only if it’s never proved that it’s not a dream, Sam was never told that and he’s off doing what he wants.”
The poem was written about chapters 19 and 20 of the original story, but happens the fit incredibly well with the events of chapter 21 and 22.
He wonders if he’s the first stranger that some of Cas’ younger siblings have ever seen on the farm given that they didn't often take in stragglers.
He hates being the only one sat on the ground when around other people, strangers especially, it makes him vulnerable, exposed, an easy target, but it’s not like he could stand to eat. Even with the man looking less superior he still bristles at the unbalance. He’s just set about eating again when the man speaks.
“Come on, I want to get to the next town before nightfall, I'm desperate for a proper wash,” Cas says as he makes to stand up, crawling backwards on his knees to get himself out from under their carriage.
He wipes and wipes to get an unobscured look at the mangled flesh. His hands shake as he works getting covered in Cas’ blood with each pass if the cloth. His own blood drips down his arm, mixing with the mess of Cas’ but it doesn't even get a moment of his attention.
The work is slow and by the end of it his head is swimming with all the information Cas’ told him, he’s not inept around tools, quite the opposite but his skill set is nowhere near the level of some of the pieces of equipment. Among the farm equipment, which ranged from tools used for the animals to plow hoes and other farm equipment that Cas told him wouldn’t be used by him, there are several everyday use items, the extent of which does not stop at the cab Charles left in that morning, there's a workbench and two bins full of moveable children’s toys, beside a door there’s an outside car that he thinks must be for family travel.
He’s got a little speech prepared for this moment but with them looking at him like he might hold the answer to all their problems he just drops into a chair, hands folded between his knees, forearms laid against his thighs.
“Cas, shit,” Dean rasps as Cas’ slick hand fists around his throbbing cock. “Ca—Cas,
“I said the stars remind me of you, your freckles more specifically. There are so many of them, I could spend hours connecting them, making new shapes, finding a meaning behind them. Just as I could the stars in the night sky. There's scarcely a thing more beautiful than the wonder that is the universe painted onto your skin, Dean.”
His own body is a map of scars, dips and valleys, memories played out upon his flesh. His shoulder pains him when a storm is ready to descend upon them, the joint flares in its socket as though it longs to pop out again. Phantom pain lances him through all parts of his once broken body, often when he least expects it. The body remembering pain more so than the mind does. Cas takes the time to soothe it until it quiets again.
Dean keeps sending his hips up to try to get Cas to go back on his stupid ‘not here’ rule. He’s not as sly as he thinks he is because Cas stretches a finger down to press against his entrance. Dean feels his breath being punched from his lungs; he
“There's no way that in the five minutes I’ve been with him alone he could unlearn everything,” Cas responds, hand stroking along Ibby’s neck. He tries to not get distracted by the motion, but like everything about Cas, something draws him into it. The splay of his strong fingers, the gentle rotation of his wrist with each pass along his shoulder, how his hand reaches into his mane on odd passes splitting the hair and carding his fingers through it without a thought. It’s intoxicating in the most infuriating way.
“Castiel, I heard from Mrs. Baker that Ms. April is still single. Now such a nice girl like her should be done looking for someone by now, wouldn’t you say?” Despite the question, she doesn't give time for an answer, “I was thinking that, if your father allowed it and didn’t need you for chores and the like, of course, that on Sunday you’d come with me to church and the two of you could speak, Oh I hear she’s a lovely girl, would make such a good wife don’t you think? If the courtship starts soon, we could have a wedding within a year!”
“Evening Sir,” the man says. “Are you looking at getting a room for the night?”
“It’s from an old English word, I'm not sure exactly how the connection came to be, it's not simple like it is sometimes.” Cas looks up at him with a hopeful smile. “But if you wanted, your name could be Dean.”
“Good morning Jody, I take it your ride here was pleasant?” he asks once he’s beside her, taking the liberty to begin unhooking the gig from the back of her own cab.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Neither are you.” Is all Cas says back. “You’ve never been alone.”
“Hey there boy,” he greets gently. “We’ve got ourselves a big day today, so I need you to keep your attitude in check, no fighting with me or any of that, I know you ain’t too fond of riding just yet but they might not even want you for that so you don’t have to worry about that now.”
Cas lived hundreds of millions of years and yet there was so much he left unfinished, he’s been around for eons and yet he still died too soon.
He’s always wished that his family's past didn't cause distress for his younger siblings and yet, Hannah would have been up and moving about the second they got a whiff that she was feeling better but their ma wouldn’t chance it, not after having the wound go septic under her eye, not after Gadreel.
It takes a few minutes longer to spot what he assumes to be the main house. There are a few people milling about, he hopes that their introduction will be done through Jody. He’s never been great at meeting new people or making friends.
“I have a bit of a rule son, I’m only Ma’am to those I don't know. I’d hope that soon you’ll call me Jody instead.”
she says yes not if, second you might want to speed up whatever timeline you have on asking her, once she’s said yes, she’ll stop thinking about the trip. Hey! If you guys play it right, you can make the trip into your honeymoon instead of a stand-alone one.”
Not even the softness of the mattress and pillow stop him from sleeping soundly again, and as he drifts off, he thinks that maybe the comfort isn't so bad after all.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Wait,” Cas says looking at Dean quizzically. Dread washes his body ice cold. He doesn't have a chance to stop him before he says, “We have more here,” and reaches towards the bag Jody left with him.
Sighing dramatically, as he does, Sam says, “The spell for it to work, because we don’t have a soul for the vessel Jack is hopefully going to create, it needs to happen where Cas’ blood or grace was spilt. Fatal amounts of either. But as an angel, he’s never really bled out. I mean we could go back to Stull but I don’t think a single person in this bunker wants a repeat of that day, all things considered.”
He’s stopped by an arm placed just below his elbow.
He would have gladly sat with his youngest siblings and his nieces and nephews, having already done so in the rotation of adults taking their turn to take care of the staggering number of young children, but his father apparently needed his sons at the table for this supper.
He nods again and his eyes flick to Cas’ lips, he wants so badly to kiss him, to prove to himself that things will be okay. The decision is made for him as Cas draws him in. It’s beautifully painful, heart-wrenching and everything that he needed. When they pull apart Dean runs his hands along the sides of Cas’ face, not moving back at all.
“Please tell me you have something that I can help this with. A cloth or something.”
He doesn't go far though, instead of dropping his hands to his side, Cas runs them up the length of Dean's arms and cups either side of his face. Cas rests his forehead against Dean’s, his eyes are closed, his breathing is steadier but still breaks with the weight of all he’s just gone through.
When they part Castiel doesn’t remove his hand from the side of Dean's face, instead he shifts it down to his neck, fingers splayed on either side of his ear ensuring that Dean’s attention is on him.
“I think I have to go,” Cas says quietly, almost as if he didn’t want Dean to hear so that he wouldn’t actually have to leave. “Kali might kill Gabriel if he makes her stay up too late so that I can be out here.” Neither move right away, their bubble too all encompassing to shatter so carelessly.
Cas eyebrows raise but he doesn't comment, instead he gets Dean to roll again while he keeps Dean’s arm pinned against his chest. Once he’s able to get his knees under him with Cas’ help he stands, the rushing of his blood sending him pitching forward at the pain and causing him to laugh again in response.
It’s just the two of them in the barn, none of his siblings were awake, his ma and pa were occupied and his father had no cause to leave the house for several hours, but Dean was still being short with him and he couldn't figure out why. There was still no explanation that came to Castiel’s mind for his change in demeanour. Dean just seemed to have decided that Castiel wasn’t worth the friendship he had offered, and if that stings more than he thought it would, he doesn’t let on.
When he switches gears and brings it back around to gentle kisses, he thinks he hears Dean whine but the feelings that swirl around in his head make it so much harder to be sure. He doubts that he’s ever felt anything near this level of possessiveness over anyone he’s been with before.
A traitorous part of his mind wishes Cas had brought the flask with him again, and not because of the cooking being subpar, he’s used to meals like that. He wants to know if their first night was a mistake in Cas’ mind, he wants to know where they stand.
Wanted to say that I am not a professional teacher, nor have I ever tried to teach a child to read or write at any length. I also have never tried to teach an adult those same things, the scene in this chapter was written from a thought process of what I believe would work the best for people in their situation.
