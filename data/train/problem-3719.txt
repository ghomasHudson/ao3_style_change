“Oh, of course not. You look fucking filthy, full of sin, stinking of death, terribly small in every capacity.” Ephraim’s tone somehow managed to be both disgusted and monotonous; as if he was looking at an insect that he’d killed and would forget about by the time he turned around. “Honestly, I’d rather die than ever possess you.”
Even if he really, really didn’t want to.
“I get that the sun’s almost down, but you couldn’t wait 5 seconds for the coast to be clear? You really need to better your mugging practices, ‘cause-”
“Yeah, but this shop... its-- its different. There’s supposedly a medium who owns it that can ‘direct you to whatever it is that you cannot find’, whatever that means.” Sam said, reading from the tourism guide that popped up on his phone and raising a brow once the meaning of the words registered.
. The word stung.
“So in other words, you’re a damned fraud.”
“Got it, Dean.”
It was dark, only illuminated by the sharp glare of blue light bulbs that sat in four lamps distributed around the corners of the room and the sunlight that sometimes peaked through gaps in the store’s thick black curtains, but every item that was shelved in the shop had a particular glow around it that made them easy to discern and even easier to see the validity of. The music of AC/DC played from a speaker that Dean couldn’t see, circulating through the storefront, and a signed poster of the band was taped messily on the wall by the entrance. When he looked down to the register, he noticed the familiar bayberry oil burning by the register and herby incense smoke wafting out from the beaded door that led to one of the back rooms, and the only things that set it apart from being an otherwise normal shop were the many, many antique dolls that sat charred to a crisp and long broken on the hardwood floor, the sight of dried, splattered blood on the walls that had been only half-way covered up with white spray paint, and the absence of the storekeep himself. Appearances could be deceiving, Dean thought, but not that deceiving-- because the place still sent shudders down his spine.
“40 on 7, please.” Dean said bluntly the moment he walked up to the register, shuffling in his wallet for the cash and eying a sale on energy drinks in the machine that stood next to him. “And two of these drinks.”
Dean kept that thought to himself and instead looked away with a laugh, feeling an unknown emotion sink from his mind and settle into his feet like concrete in the ocean. Castiel was going to give him a heart attack one of these days with how much he made sparks ignite in his bloodstream and fires start in his veins without even having to try too hard, and he was pretty damn positive that Cas was hardly even aware of that fact.
He hadn’t heard or said
“It’s fine, it’s more progress than it was.” Sam sounded frustrated, despite what he said, and he stood up from his chair and moved back towards the entrance. “Come on Dean, let’s go.”
“Of course, Dean.” Castiel put a hand to Dean’s cheek and slowly rubbed his thumb against his auburn brown stubble, and Dean could hear the smile that was in his words. He wished he could see it, too, but it was too late for that. All he could do was imagine it, and his general picture of it was good enough.
“What do you need, Dean?” Sam asked in a silent murmur, sounding less like the man he had become and the little brother he used to be.
held a piece of his heart so vital that whenever he wasn’t around, it ceased to function entirely. He loved just being with him, talking to him, and hearing him, and seeing him, and over time, he was taken over completely with the feeling of a love so overpoweringly strong that it made his ears ring and his face flush. He was his everything, and Dean was convinced that he had been since the day they met.
Dean didn’t answer Sam’s rhetorical questions, chewing at his bottom lip as he impatiently waited for the stoplight to change, and pointed to the brown backpack that sat at his brother’s feet. “What did you say his name was again? The- the last one?”
In a ritual-esque clockwork, the calcite began to glow around the four of them, vibrating despite sitting on solid earth and murmuring a low hum that made the soles of Dean's shoes move about on top of the pebbles he stood on. In a final movement, he looked to Sam, who seemed to be looking at anything other than him as he focused on the slowly brightening summoning circle below them; and then to Joel, who only nodded back to him before looking back at Elena- who had now stepped inside of the circle but made careful motions as to not smudge any of the markings that lied on the inside of it. He hadn't noticed until it was too late that she had her palms facing forward and her arms braced for a future impact.
“You’ve become a little Casanova ever since you lost your Grace, huh?” Dean, ignoring the way his heart was thumping in his throat, followed suit and hopped from the park bench, wobbling a bit as he stood up but feeling oddly proud at how he didn’t need assistance.
“I'm not doing it for charity, if that's what you mean to imply."
He saw it all, fresh in his mind and seared into his pupils, and he never let himself forget it. Not when he was asleep or awake, moving constantly or stuck in place, trying to live properly or trying to die recklessly. It was a curse, a pair of iron shackles that kept his head low to the ground and refused to release themselves from him until he found a way to fix the unfixable and repair the irrevocable. Dean told himself that it was impossible, and he could almost bring himself to believe the thought, but he couldn’t stop searching for the one chance he convinced himself existed somewhere in the abyss of occult knowledge that he had grown so accustomed to diving into. There was a way to bring him back. There was always a way to bring him back. There had to be a way to bring him back.
"I guess we should." Cas reluctantly agreed with a smile.
Dr. Wright took a deep breath. "Do you really want the truth?"
"I won't let him hurt you. Or either of us."
Cas smiled softly as Dean packed away his supplies and gave Cas his t shirt he'd been wearing underneath his flannel shirt.
When she emerged Dean's knee was bobbing nervously. "Do you want me to stay sweetie?" Ellen asked, her eyes wet. "I will but I'll also understand if you want to be alone."
He owed Benny so much. After Cas had died, Dean was a mess. He moved to Canada, as far away as Lawrence Kansas as he could afford. He was broke, and needed a job desperately. He was drunk half the time and the other half of the time he was lost inside himself.
"But-"
Cas always slept with his blinds closed. He opened his eye and sat up. He looked around the room and last nights events came flooding back. He reached for his phone and checked the time-10:41 am. He swung out of bed in a blind panic, crashing to the floor loudly. Loudly enough apparently to wake Dean, who appeared at the bedroom door with a serious case of bed head.
He took a deep breath when he realized that he'd ended up at the diner. He headed inside and it hit him like a brick wall, and he had been completely unsuspecting. With the smell of french fries and burgers came the memories and snippets of conversations they'd had there.
Dean's grip on Cas tightened protectively and he let out a tiny sigh. "This okay?"
"Aww, don't be so grumpy." Cas chided, his arms also full of laundry.
"Stay with me, don't leave."
"But it is. They say he won't get any better, he's pretty banged up Ellen. So they put him in this induced coma or whatever to see if it would help him heal but....it didn't. There's nothing they can do....it's all over." Dean's shoulders sagged dejectedly and he let out a strangled sob.
"Because it's girly." Cas mumbled.
"Missed you at lunch." Dean said as Cas opened the passenger door and slid inside.
"And that got you detention?"
Dean spotted a Twix bar and dove for it. Unfortunately someone else had their hands on that bar too. Dean glared up at the pair of grubby hands that held onto the other end of the bar. "Let go, I saw it first!" Dean demanded as he looked up at the other child.
Dean gave him a searching look. "You wanna talk about it?"
Cas's mouth opened and closed stupidly before he found his voice. "Well, I'll keep your secret safe."
"I know." Dean whispered. "But hell, you know what happened when I brought Lisa home. I don't know Bobby, Cas seems like a pretty big bomb to drop on them."
Dean emerged later and pushed Cas towards the bathroom. "Hurry up, don't want Mr. College Bound to be late." Cas rolled his eyes but gave Dean a quick kiss before closing the door. "Well that's better." Dean murmured and from the other side of the door Cas heard him and smiled.
They took the same booth at the back and Ellen appeared instantly. "Are you ever going to introduce me or what?" She asked Dean, hands on hips.
Finally, much too later it seemed, the officers exited Cas's room and motioned for Dean to go inside. "Hey," Dean smiled compassionately and retook his seat. He tenderly reached up and brushed a stray strand of hair off Cas's forehead.
"Good," Ellen announced. "It'll be good for you to get some healthy home cooking for a change instead of this crap all the time. I mean, I know you like it, but it just isn't healthy Dean." Dean gave a slight roll of his eyes and took a giant bite of his burger.
"I'm not drunk." Cas protested but with little conviction.
Cas chuckled softly and gently placed a kiss on the tip of Mary's nose. "Let's just keep this between us, okay? If you told anybody they might be jealous and, well, I don't have time to visit every child Christmas eve."
"Magic." Dean said mysteriously.
"Hey, I love you too Cas." Dean murmured. Cas let out a content sigh. Dean smiled gently and traced Cas's cheekbone with his thumb. "God, only you could get drunk on one beer."
"Yeah, but we gotta hit the road." Dean said, jerking his thumb towards Cas. "Can't have mister goody two shoes being late-"
"Actually....I haven't." Dean said quietly. Cas looked over at him, startled by the news. Dean shrugged his shoulders. "I kinda like this place...it's special to me. I'm not going to take a few girls down here just to screw them."
"Hey, it's not so bad." Cas tried to smile but it came out a grimace. "Besides, I sure as hell can't go to the hospital."
They pulled into the driveway and Cas jumped out. Dean unlocked the door slowly, laughing at Cas's impatience.
"Yeah." Cas fidgeted nervously.
"Well I guess I have to say yes then, don't I?" Cas gave him another nervous smile.
"Mmm?" Dean raised an eyebrow suggestively. "I wonder why that is? Thinking about me, huh?"
They left the mall and after picking up a bag and some wrapping paper started the drive back to the motel. Cas was strangely quiet and Dean was becoming even more concerned. "Cas...you seem kinda quiet."
Dean chuckled and placed a kiss on the back of Cas's neck. "Almost babe, just hold on a damn minute." Dean took Cas by the arm and led him over to the grass. "Wait here." He commanded as he let go of Cas and grabbed a few things from the impala.
Benny held a stick in his hands as his dad spun him around a few times. Benny whacked the poor pinata a few times before it broke open, causing candy to fall to the ground.
"But you-"
Cas finally opened his eyes at feeling the weight of Dean on top of him and smiled, dimples and all. "Well, I like this sight." He murmured and Dean smiled at him. Cas kissed his boyfriend softly, taking as long as he wanted.
"I can totally bribe you though, right?"
Dean rolled his eyes in response.
reappeared
"Ya think?" Cas asked with a laugh.
Dean tossed in a pair of his jeans, giving Cas a kiss on the earlobe. Cas looked down into the machine, trying to hide his smile. Dean threw in a shirt and then another one and placed two kisses on the top of Cas's head.
Dean started throwing binders and textbooks into a bag. He heard footsteps from behind him and whipped around. He couldn't help but smile softly when he saw Cas.
"Dean, I don't want...I can't leave you! I love you."
Dean smiled as he gently ran his thumb along Cas's hipbone. "To be honest, me either. I didn't really know what was happening until that day at the falls.....and I just knew that I had to have you."
Dean rolled his eyes and brushed his hand against Cas's hand as he walked by. "So what should we do?" He asked, grabbing a beer out of the fridge.
"I have to Dean." Cas gave him a sad smile. "I know you want to help, but...if I don't go home, it'll be a thousand times worse. You...you don't understand, they always seem to find me! I just can't get away from them!" Cas looked out the window and let out his breath slowly.
"Hey!" Dean shouted.
Cas seemed to choose his words carefully before responding. "I'm sorry-"
Dean pulled Cas close and held him against his chest. He kissed the top of Cas's head before letting him go. "Okay mister,it's bedtime for you." Dean said sternly, nudging Cas towards the bedroom.
They ducked out of the view of the hall monitor and Cas held his breath at the feeling of Dean's hand on his shoulder, hiding him from view. "You know," Dean grinned as they continued their way down the hallway. "Normal people take off their coats when they're inside."
"No you don't." Cas interrupted as he followed him. "You might get some help from Ellen or Jo or something."
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"Well I'll need my assistant." Dean insisted, pulling Cas into his arms.
"I need you too." Cas proclaimed as he pressed his nose against Dean's cheek. Dean seemed to instantly relax against Cas once those words had been said. "I need you." Cas repeated softly. "And I know you need me too. We have a profound bond, we have something very special Dean. Maybe I'm not sure exactly what it is, but I won't let anyone ever take that away from us." Dean smiled against Cas's chest as he took the angels hand in his own and clasped their fingers together tightly. "I'll always be here for you." Cas promised as he placed a gentle kiss to Dean's cheek.
"Yeah, sorry."
"Who cares? You'll be away from him, and legally you'll be an adult. There's nothing he could do." Cas resisted the urge to laugh because that statement was the farthest thing from the truth. "The falls?" Dean asked and when Cas shook his head yes signaled left. "You know if you tell anybody about this place, I'll kill you, right?"
Dean snorted, clearly not believing him. "Yeah right, I forgot. Your Cas, not exactly the type to get in a fight. You must be one hell of a klutz though."
Dean looked over at him and smiled. "A Zeplin fan? And you like my car too? Hey, maybe your allright after all."
"Oh angel, of course not." Cas leaned into her and hugged her fiercely. "Shh, don't cry sweetheart, it was nothing. It's nothing to be upset about okay."
"I agree...no offense."
"Sure hope you washed your hands." Cas teased. Dean grinned wickedly but didn't get a chance to respond. "Okay, hurry up and open them."
"Shut up you." Cas grinned successfully as Dean flickered the beer cap at him. Cas caught it and tossed it back smoothly with a smug grin. "Show off." Dean muttered, grabbing his car keys.
"Hey!" Cas swatted Dean on the arm.
"Not my house." Cas's eyes went wide and his voice rose above a whisper for the first time that day. "How about we go to the library and find some books?"
"Don't ask stupid questions." Cas grinned and leaped out of the car. "I'm freaking starving, hospital food sucks."
Cas smiled as they entered the building and went around to the back where Sammy's mustang sat. "Go ahead." Cas said, taking a seat. "I'll just enjoy the view." He raised an eyebrow suggestively and Dean pulled him close for a quick kiss. "Get to work." Cas said, swatting him away with a small smile.
"Hey,it's Friday." Dean pointed out, trying to be positive.
"Love you too." Dean murmured as he lazily let his hand caress Cas's arm.
"Dean?"
"Sometimes I wish I could." Cas mumbled, staggering out to sit at the kitchen table. "Please tell me you have coffee."
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"This is a God damn tease of what's to come." Dean muttered as he left his leather jacket in the car.
"Yup, same for him." Dean jerked his thumb towards Cas as they took a booth.
Dean grinned playfully. "But I like bugging you."
"Your not such a good liar after all." Dean whispered, turning to his first class of the day.
"I know...it's just that I guess I've grown up like that. It's pretty hard to tell myself that's wrong all of a sudden, you know what I mean? I just want out of here."
"Yes, of course. I will respect whatever decision you make Dean."
"Crap." Cas muttered. He'd been so lost in the moment, he'd actually listened to Dean's words and had forgotten about what was waiting for him at home. He cursed himself silently as he gathered up his things.
It looked normal enough from the outside, you'd never expect the sinister people it housed. Dean got out of his car and walked up the front steps. He knocked on the door and when nobody answered, rang the doorbell. Still no answer. He opened the door, which thankfully wasn't locked, and tiptoed down the small hallway towards the noise. He gasped when he came to a lit room, Cas lying on the floor, bloody and beaten. Two men stood over him, his brother and father Dean guessed.
Cas glared at Dean's retreating back and let out a long sigh as he downed the rest of his coffee and got another cup. He couldn't help but smile as he heard Dean's voice float from the bathroom, singing along to AC DC with enthusiasm unbelievable this early in the morning.
"Eat your friggin pie!"
"I gotta stop by my apartment for a second."
Cas took a deep breath. "A long time to be honest, but it really got worse after mom died." Dean shook his head sadly and Cas clenched his hand.
"So," Dean started, taking Cas's hand and walking along the edge of the water. "What's a guy like you doing with a guy like me?"
Dean looked down at the floor, feeling numb. "Can...can I have some time to think about this?"
Mary grinned and her eyes sparkled. "I knew it, I knew you had to be real!"
Cas blushed and grabbed one of the boxes from Dean and placed it under the tree. He then grabbed one of the cookies from the coffee table and began to chew.
"I just want you to be okay Cas. I can't just sit here and watch you suffer. I just want you to know that....hell, I'll miss you so much, but let it go. Just let everything go, you don't deserve this crap Cas." Tears trickled down Dean's face and Cas reached up to brush them away but he couldn't. He just didn't have the strength.
"Losers." Dean supplied, admiring the battered black 1985 mustang they had approached. "You can't tell Sammy what I'm doing."
"Yeah, I know." Dean said with a shoulder shrug.
"I guess you've updated to digital download, aka iTunes."
"She..she noticed the bruises on my arms one day in gym class. She confronted me about it and....I cracked. I told her everything and she went to the police and then...." Cas let out a sob. "Dad...he saw us hanging out one day and said he wanted to meet her. God, I'll never forget the look on Meg's face when I told her that." Cas smiled sadley and Dean traced his brow tenderly. "She came over one day after school, and Dad knew that I'd told her what was going on so...." Cas took a gulp of air and swallowed a sob. "He wrapped his hands around her neck...and...he didn't let go, he didn't stop. No matter how blue her face turned. No matter how much I tried to stop it, God, I tried to stop it....it...it just didn't end." Cas let out a sob and buried his head against Dean's chest. "I had to stand there and watch....I failed her, I couldn't stop it, I failed her." Dean held him tenderly, rocking Cas back and forth in his arms as he cried quietly. "I failed her, I couldn't save her, and then afterwards.....Dad made me help bury the body..." Cas closed his eyes and sniffled. "I just....you know, it almost looked like she was sleeping. Like she could wake up any minute. But....But we shoved her in that hole and piled dirt on top and even if she could wake up, even if she wasn't dead......"
"Sure do kid, come on." They walked around the corner of the building and Cas followed awkwardly.
Dean bit his lip and looked over at Cas with pain in his eyes, internally debating what to say. "Well," He cleared his throat and squeezed Cas's hand. "I guess I'll follow you like a little lost puppy."
"You see this?" Dean slid a talent show flyer across the desk toward Cas with a knowing smile.
"Castiel!" It came out a moan and it seemed hours for Dean to dig out his cell phone and dial 911.
Finally Dean reluctantly broke the kiss and rolled away and took Cas in his arms.
"I can't drive." Cas admitted shyly.
"Hey." Dean said as he plunked down next to Cas in class the next day. Cas gave him an akward smile before lowering his head again. "You back to the whole no talking thing? Come on dude, we should hang out sometime. Hey, you doing anything tonight?"
He squeezed Cas's hand with a small smile. "Damn it Cas, if only you could see the mess you are turning me into...but I don't mind. You were-are- pretty important to me Cas. I don't regret getting involved with you at all." Dean smiled sadley at this. "I won't ever, but....I sure as hell wish it didn't have to end like this." Dean trailed off and and felt a lump form in his throat. "We were supposed to have so much more time." He turned away and pressed his forehead against the cool wall. "Damn it, I'm sorry Cas. I promised you that I'd protect you, that I'd find a way out of this for you so you didn't get hurt and....I failed...I'm so sorry."
"You say that like we're going to be together forever."
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"Here." Dean helped Cas into the passenger seat and then got in his own side. Dean took Cas's hand in his as they drove down the road.
"Stop, that tickles!" Dean protested.
Cas looked out the window with a hint of a smile. "Dean?"
"Or," Dean suggested, smiling wickedly. "We could just go skinny dipping."
"Yeah." Dean stood up and looked out the window, trying to focus on anything other than this.
Cas's facade faltered for a split second but he quickly regained his composure. He didn't know how to respond. Dean clearly didn't believe his excuse and worry and doubt crept into Cas's mind.
Cas blushed as Dean touched the tip of their noses together. "I never expected to fall in love again, let alone with....a guy-you."
"Hey, you'll get in." Dean reassured him. "Jeez, your practically guaranteed a full ride."
Cas snuggled down next to Mary, grumbling when she accidentally elbowed him in the ribs.
Dean appeared in the hallway and Cas unconsciously smiled. "Dean."
Cas gave him a bashful smile. " Shut up and drive."
The fire began to die a few hours later. Dean poked the dying fire with a stick and sighed loudly. Cas let out a yawn but didn't dare close his eyes. He didn't want to let this night go, it seemed perfect. "Damn." Dean muttered as the fire went out.
"I'm not a part of that." Cas said, his gentle smile hiding his hurt.
He didn't let go until they took the body away. Even then he could have sworn he could still feel Cas's palm pressed against his and Cas's brave, soft smile was etched into his brain.
"I love you too." Dean placed another kiss on his forehead. Cas snuggled back against the pillows and closed his eyes. "You should get some rest." Dean suggested.
"Are you sure your okay?" He asked as he signaled back onto the empty road.
"Sadly." Cas chuckled softly.
"Frigging weather." Dean muttered, grabbing a beer and pointedly not offering Cas one.
"Maybe."
Dean took a deep breath. "From what I got....pretty bad. They are going to give it a few hours to see if he'll wake up so the cops can get their statement. If not, heck, even if he does, they talked about putting him in an induced coma, they said it might help him heal."
Dean tried to smile. "Go ahead, they said he'll be waking up soon."
Cas smiled. "I hoped you'd like it."
Dean laughed as he detached himself from his husband and placed some of the packages underneath the tree. "You did a pretty good job." He said.
--------------------------------
Dean lowered his head to hide his smirk.
Cas took off his trench coat later that night and something fell from his pocket.
"That's it!" Dean laughed as Cas exploded and threw a cookbook at him. "Out! Out! Out!"
"Damn it." Dean paced and looked into the horizon. He finally stopped and placed his head in his hands. "Cas..I....I do." He was somehow able to squeeze the words out. "I love you okay, and damn it you must know that because....if you didn't then you must feel so damn alone and...."
The days afterwards were hard, almost impossible it seemed. Anything could remind him of Castiel, from something as simple as seeing a trench coat, or even being in his car.
"I know that." Dean scoffed. Though somewhere deep inside he was hoping Sammy, the doctors, everyone was wrong.
Dean dumped out the contents of Cas's backpack and smiled. "Perfect."
It was scary, Dean wasn't going to deny it. The longer Cas was unconscious the less chance of him waking up. At least that was what the doctors said. But Cas was strong, Dean had to keep hoping he was strong enough.
Cas turned to Dean and gave him a shy smile. "Thanks Dean, but believe me, it's better this way. I'll see you tomorrow."
"She better." Dean snorted. "We spent a friggin fortune on the kid!"
The younger man ripped the phone away from Dean, sending it flying into the corner as he glared at Dean with hard eyes.
Cas snuggled up next to him and Dean kissed his temple. "This is even better." Cas looked out at the water with a faint smile. "Did you ever finish Sam's mustang?"
The wrench Dean had been holding fell to the floor with a clang. He bent to pick it up, his heart pounding. "Jeez man, I'm sorry."
Dean was talking on the phone when Cas emerged and he remained quiet, not wanting to interrupt. "Hey." Dean said as he set the phone down.
Cas blushed and Dean wrapped an arm around his waist as they headed outside. He stopped by the car and kissed Cas gently, his hands rising up to cup Cas's face. "The special one indeed. I won't ever let you get away." Dean murmured, Cas blushed again as he opened the passenger door.
It was two pm by the time Cas got up again, this time for good. He trudged out to the kitchen in his t shirt and boxers and couldn't help but notice it was eerily quiet without Dean. He put in a Foreigner cassette and plopped down on the couch. He flicked on the TV and channel surfed with no luck before deciding to take a shower.
"Dean...." Ellen's voice softened and she looked at him with concern. "Let's go." She said, grabbing her jacket. "Get Jo to cover for me would ya Ash? I'm heading out." She helped Dean outside and grabbed a burger. "Hospital food sucks, the poor thing must be starving."
Cas was loaded into the ambulance within minutes and Dean rode with him in the ambulance to the hospital. In fact, he held Cas's hand the entire time. If Cas was awake he'd be blushing furiously. But this wasn't Cas, it was just an empty shell and his face remained pale and emotionless.
Cas smiled down shyly at the floor. Dean started the car and travelling riverside blues filled their ears. "God, I love this song." Cas was so caught up in the moment he let his guard down.
"It doesn't matter. Besides, this is better than sitting at home." Dean got back to work, humming softly under his breath.
"Well I sure know how to make things awkward, don't I?" Dean asked with a forced laugh.
Cas smiled as he kissed him. "Well, your quite convincing."
"It's kind of weird actually. Your right there after every class, are you stalking me?" Cas asked with a laugh.
Castiel chuckled as kissed Dean's cheek. "Think we'll ever stop spoiling her?"
"Cas, you can't go back there." Dean said quietly, turning down the music and looking at Cas intently. "Stay at my place."
"Cas?" Cas's head snapped up at the teachers voice and his eyes went wide. "Is there something funny?"
"It's alright." Cas murmured, looking out at the water.
Cas couldn't hold in his laugh. When Mary  looked at him in shock he cringed. Oh shit. "Mary, it's fine, I promise." Cas sat down next to the child and realized how upset she looked. "Mary, what's wrong?"
"Dean." There was pain and anger and fear in Cas's voice and Dean felt his heart go out to him. "Please." Cas looked into Dean's eyes, his face tear stricken and pleading. "Please Dean, it's better this way, if you don't do anything. You have to believe me."
"I'm wondering the same damn thing."
"Oh, just how depressed you were without me." Cas said playfully with a grin as Dean rolled his eyes.
"Does that mean Dean doesn't love you anymore?" She asked quietly as a single tear rolled down her cheek.
"Hey." Cas responded as Dean appeared beside him and searched his eyes carefully.
"I think so." Cas said, picking at his fingernail.
"Hey," Dean looked into Cas's eyes and tried to smile. "You didn't let me down, don't ever say that again."
"You know," Dean said, glancing lazily over at Cas. "We never did jump."
"I think it's my time buddy." Dean whispered, peeling open one eye to look at his friend.
"I'm not reading it." Cas looked around the room anxiously. Every other pair was getting to work.
"I'll walk." Cas bolted out the door and down the sidewalk. The place he wanted least to be was home, but staying away would make it far worse. Because he would find him, he always did.
"Um, yeah." Cas said as if it were obvious.
"They pushed me and I fell back against the stove..."
Dean pulled Cas to him and ran his hand along the edge of Cas's t shirt. "I thought you were tired." He teased.
Cas shoved him playfully. "Is that all you think about?"
Cas wrapped his arms around Dean and held him tightly. "Dean...please don't feel sad." Cas slowly rubbed his thumb along Dean's spine. "Please Dean...I don't want to make you sad."
The younger placed what he hoped was a comforting hand on Dean's shoulder but Dean shrugged it off and sat by Cas's bed.
Dean touched the chocolate bar in his pocket, smiling fondly at the memory.
"Dean, what are you doing-"
"I'm sorry Cas." Dean murmured, placing a kiss on his shoulder. Dean wrapped his arms around Cas's waist for a few precious seconds and Cas leaned into him.
Dean felt a small smile tug at his lips. "I like the way you think."
"But not too soon." Cas's voice cracked.
"Shh." Dean murmured, rubbing Cas's back comfortingly. "Shh Cas, it's alright babe. It's alright now." Cas took a deep breath and tried to wipe his tears away. "Shh." Dean whispered again.
"Told you." Cas said victoriously, leaning down to kiss his cheek.
Claire turned to face him immediately. "Your not going to try and kiss me goodnight are you?"
"Your dad gave you your car?"
"But we have tomorrow and the next day and a damn long time, so that makes it a little better."
"That is amazing cosplay. You seriously look like Dean, like for friggin real." The girl stepped closer and inspected Dean. "How long did it take you to put your costume together?" She reached out and touched Dean's sleeve. "And your makeup and hair is amazing. Your wearing contacts right? No ones eyes are that fan fiction green in real life, no offense."
Cas looked over at Dean with wide eyes, feeling his breath catch. "Yeah, I told her how klutzy Cas fell down the stairs." Dean shook his head with a fake grin. "Maybe she can convince you to be more careful."
"What is with that anyway?" Dean asked as he parked the car and began working.
"M'kay." Mary mumbled as she yawned.
"Yeah, why not?" Dean grinned over at his new friend as he tore off the wrapper.
Dean wrapped an arm around Cas and pulled him closer, letting his eyes close as he listened to the rhythmic breathing of Cas next to him.
"Go fuck yourself."
Cas was suddenly nervous. "Nothing, never mind."
Cas shrugged his shoulders with a sly smile. "Whatever you think."
Dean discreetly rubbed his eyes and clenched his jaw.
"Did you make these?" Dean asked, inspecting a 1959 Ford.
Dean pulled Cas close by his belt loops to give him a kiss before grabbing his car keys and wallet. "Here, wear it." Dean said, giving Cas his leather jacket. Cas was confused but gave Dean his trench coat wordlessly. Dean grinned wickedly. "I guess that means I have to wear this old thing." He slipped on the trench coat with a smile and took Cas's hand as they walked out to the car.
"33." Cas replied almost instantly, not realizing it was a rhetorical question.
Dean caught it with a grin and followed Cas outside where it was getting dark. "You look even prettier in the moonlight," Dean murmered as they turned down the road. "It kind of hides your face-"
"Sounds good." Cas agreed as Dean plopped down in the sand.
Cas smirked innocently. "What do you mean?"
Dean turned around and beamed, Cas looked so damn adorable. Dean waited for his husband to reach him on the steps and positioned himself so he could kiss Cas as he walked by.
Dean grinned and offered it to Cas, who shook his head no. "Come on," Dean encouraged with a nudge. "You'll like it."
"...I had to get out of the house, I had to see you, I didn't think it was that bad." Dean shook his head as he dumped out the contents of his backpack onto the floor. "What are you looking for?" Cas asked shakily.
"Yeah, I filled out the applications in chem class and mailed them before dad got home."
"No, I don't want to be here, let's go."
------------------------
"Hey." Dean said softly as Cas stirred next to him. Cas opened his eyes and lifted his head before letting it flop back down. He let out a small sigh and Dean placed his hand on the back of Cas's head. Cas let out another small sigh, this time in content. "None of this is your fault Cas." Dean said softly. "You have to stop blaming yourself. I'm sure Meg forgives you, people make mistakes and those mistakes can be forgiven."
"Me too, so much...." Dean threw the rest of the laundry in in a heap and kissed Cas's lips. "I love you babe."
"Ah, no." Cas responded quickly, turning on the stereo and putting in a motor head cassette. "This is getting weird. The Dean I know doesn't give a shit about school."
Dean clapped Cas on the knee with a smile. "Come on, let's get out of here." Cas grabbed his stuff and followed Dean across the school grounds. He tried not to look as Dean stripped off his jacket and carried it in his arms. "Come on," Dean said, turning back to Cas. "It's nice out, you don't need that thing silly." He slipped off Cas's trench coat as if it were nothing and threw it at him with a grin. Cas caught it, his cheeks flaming. Cas stuffed his jacket and messenger bag in the backseat and Dean sped out of the parking lot. "Falls?" Dean asked, rolling down his window with a smile. "There's nowhere else I'd rather be in this weather."
"Yeah, but at 2 am?"
Cas looked at Dean worriedly as he walked down the hallway but Dean seemed unconcerned. He gave Cas a smile and a wink before disappearing into Mr. Blair's office.
"Mmm, so what should we do tonight?" Dean asked softly, letting Cas linger in his arms.
"What an assbut." Cas pouted as he folded his arms.
"Um...."
Dean just rolled his eyes. "No you don't Cas-"
"What? They were already dirty anyway." Dean smirked as he pulled away and straightened Cas's shirt.
Breathing suddenly seemed labored and Dean felt his heart jolt. He was suddenly afraid of being alone. Afraid of what like would turn out without Cas by his side, without Cas to lean on. Without Cas, period.
Cas heard the slight purr of a car engine and stood up, watching as Dean pulled to the curb. Cas hesitantly opened the passenger door and Dean surveyed him worriedly.
Cas smiled at him and let out a tiny laugh. "I guess I forgot what it was like to love somebody....ever since.....Well, I never thought I'd find somebody again....." He trailed off and saw the burning question in Dean's eyes. "Meg." He whispered, smiling softly into the distance. "God, sometimes it seems a lifetime ago and other times it seems only yesterday...." Cas shifted and rested his head back on Dean's chest as he lay back down. "I thought I loved her, but now...I'm not so sure. You view love a little differently in the 9th grade. I cared about her, I know that much and maybe I did love her....but....not like this. I wasn't willing to put her in danger...maybe I've just become more selfish....." Dean smiled and ran his hand through Cas's hair, comforting him. "Although...sometimes I wonder if it would have developed into more....if only we had more time. But...I don't think it would have compared to this. This, us, seems special."
~~~~~
Cas nodded his head weakly. "He was in one of his moods, real drunk and pissed that I was never home. That I was a screw up, just the usual. But he started in on me and the mirror broke. I didn't think anything of it until he pushed me and I fell into it."
"You know, wet jeans are really uncomfortable." Cas muttered as he shifted slightly.
"Cas..." Dean sighed as he grabbed their package and headed towards the doors. "Listen, it's not about what you get her. It's that you took the time, you cared enough to get her something, okay?"
Cas closed his eyes and tilted his head towards the sun. "This is nice." He murmured.
"Damn it Dean." Cas growled as he rubbed his jaw.
"I said shut up."
Cas yawned and leaned his head against Dean's shoulder."You seriously need to get more sleep." Dean said, concern creeping into his voice. "It's not healthy Cas."
Cas's eyes darted to look at him before landing on his book again. "No." He whispered.
"I can't." Cas scuffed his shoe along the floor. "I have detention."
"Hey, who says you were going to pay attention to the movie anyway?" Cas asked with a shy grin.
"You sure?" Dean asked.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"So your just hiding behind it." Dean said, stating the obvious. Cas nodded his head slightly, he felt exposed, naked. Dean plopped the textbook down with a thud, re-instating Cas's wall of solitude. "There you go, hide from the world." Cas wasn't sure if he was being rude or just teasing so he didn't respond. "So, the civil war, nice and boring. Unless your a nerd and this is just your absolute heaven." Cas didn't respond and Dean studied him. "Are you always this quiet?" The bell rang and Cas scrambled to pick up his books and papers. "Hey, before you go running off to your next class, which, by the way, I'm sure you just don't stop talking in, where do you want to meet to work on this?"
Dean admired Cas out of the corner of his eye as he started the car and pulled Cas beside him. He instantly grabbed Cas's hand, prompting a smile from the shorter. "I guess you'l have to get home soon, huh?" Dean didn't seem exactly happy with that idea.
"I didn't get much sleep last night." Cas admitted in a mumble.
"I didn't hand in my English paper." Cas mumbled.
"Are you trying to get me in bed with you?" Dean asked, a mischievous look in his eye.
" I can't." Cas said, trying to keep the desperation out of his voice. He shook his head slowly. "I just can't. I know you don't understand and I'm sorry but...I just can't."
"Thanks Sammy." Dean said quietly.
"Of course." Cas smiled before leaning over and kissing Dean again. "We should do this more often."
"It's alright, you can borrow some of mine. I just hope they fit." Dean pulled out a pair of dark jeans, a grey t shirt and a plaid long sleeve shirt. "Here." Cas accepted them with a smile, even though it wasn't the sort of clothes he would normally wear. He hurried to the bathroom to take a shower.
"Yes." Cas breathed, ripping himself away long enough to place a gentle kiss on Dean's temple. Dean scooped Cas up in his arms bride style and Cas let out a laugh as they made their way to the bedroom.
Cas smiled at the feeling of Dean lying next to him and let his eyes close once again.
Cas let out a moan that clearly stated that he was happy with that idea. "I just want to sleep Dean. How about I go back tomorrow?"
"It isn't that bad. You just have to get used to it."
Let me see." Cas reluctantly lifted up his shirt and Dean felt his heart sink as he tenderly reached up to trace the burn marks on Cas's back. "They couldn't fix this when you were in the hospital?"
"So your going to be a mechanic?"
"Huh."
"Cas." Dean breathed, feeling incredibly love struck all over again.
"It's allright man."
------------------------------------------------------------------------
"Um...probably watch some TV."
Dean placed another kiss on Cas's lips before letting his hands settle in his partners hair.
He felt reality begin to slip away so he ran his hand through Cas's hair.
Cas let out a giggle and smiled. "I agree. Bet you tomorrow it'll be cold and raining."
Cas grinned victoriously as Dean glared at him. "You are a dirty, deceiving cheater." He muttered.
"Cas..." Dean sighed and pulled onto the shoulder of the road. "What's up?"
"Hey, you want a ride home?" Dean offered as Cas frantically shoved things in his messenger bag. Cas's eyes widened and he shook his head no frantically. "You sure?" This time Cas shook his head yes as he bolted out the doors and down the sidewalk. Cas lived on the other side of town, but he wasn't going to accept a ride, not from anyone. No, it was better this way. He picked up the pace, imagining the rage and anger his father would be in when he got home.
"Why do you think he's always in here sweetie?" Ellen laughed. "That boy couldn't even boil water if his life depended on it."
"He...damn it Ellen! He's....gonna die!"
Cas brushed his beard against Dean's cheek, causing the other to giggle.
"Dean, don't." Ellen whispered. "Don't try to blame this on yourself."
"Can't have Mr. college bound falling behind, now can we? Besides, it's not like there is much else to do in here."
Dean took Cas's hand and squeezed it.
Dean nodded his approval and tapped the steering wheel rhythmically.
"Who cares? Late I think." Dean replied, running his hand up and down Cas's arm. "You feeling any better?"
"Would you believe I was trying to protect you? If you can't find them then there's less chance of them finding you."
"I'm sorry." Cas apologized quickly, wrapping his arms around himself and looking at the ground.
"Mmm, good point."
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"I have a brother too." Cas blurted.
"So how did you two meet?" Jo asked again. You still never answered, but I bet it was super romantic."
"Dean....I....."
"I just....fell against some glass..."
Dean laughed once she was out of earshot. "Good job Santa." He teased. "I'll go tuck her in."
"So?" Dean asked, stiring his cornflakes absenmindedly. "You going to elaborate or just drop a line like that and clam up?"
"What?"
Dean gave him a confident smile. "No problem." He squeezed Cas's hand as Ellen came back with their food.
"I know it does." Dean said softly. "I can see it in your eyes. But it shouldn't bother you, you shouldn't care what anybody says or thinks."
"So your not going to tell me what's really up, are you?" Dean asked, glancing over at Cas. Cas looked at the floor, because they both knew the answer to that question. Cas wasn't going to put his only friend in danger. Dean let out a small sigh. "Okay, I get it. You don't want to share. That's okay. Heck, I even understand. We all have our secrets, you more than others, but...if you ever do decide you need to talk, I'm all ears."
"Nuh uh!" Dean shot back. "I'd eat them everyday if I was allowed!"
Dean let out a long sigh. He knew he didn't stand a chance, he'd always give in to Cas. "Fine, but no excuses tomorrow."
"And sometimes I need a little time off." Cas went flying through the hallway, laughing as Dean chased after him.
"Work-ish." Dean said with another smirk, causing Cas to roll his eyes.
"What?" Dean asked, annoyed as he felt around for a piece of candy.
Dean paid the bill and took Cas's hand. "See ya Ellen." He called.
"Dean, I'm sorry, but you must agree, leaving him like this....well, it wouldn't be much of a life for him. It just wouldn't be right."
"Jesus, how old were you?"
Dean shrugged his shoulders, trying not to show how hopeless and lost he felt.
Cas bit his lip but smiled as Dean pulled the door close behind him.
"Wow, Cas rocking out, I never expected that." Cas blushed furiously and ceased all movement. "You know, if you weren't always so closed up all the time, you'd have a ton of friends. Underneath that exterior, your pretty cool."
"What happened?"
"To study. Remember that math test I have next period?"
"How was the homework?" Dean asked with a smirk, catching up with Cas as he entered the school.
"Go fuck yourself!" Dean glared at him as the call went through. "We need an ambulance at 478 River Road-"
"English pod."
Cas smiled shyly and looked over at him.
Dean pulled into the diner parking lot and hopped out. "I'll be right back."
Dean was waiting by the front doors by the time Cas reached him. "So....the project?" Dean prompted.
Cas rolled his eyes with an exasperated sigh and stood up. "See ya Ellen."
-----------------------------------------------------------
Cas said again,moving closer to Dean. "I love you Dean. I'd follow you anywhere. I'd do anything for you. We should leave here, run away to anywhere."
Cas opened his mouth but closed it again, speechless. "It's not his fault Mr. Blair," Dean but in. "He crashed at my place last night and I forgot to set my alarm for him." Cas turned to Dean in shock. He was actually taking the blame for him!
"No problem." Cas reached over to turn up the music, bobbing his head along shyly.
"What class?"
Nights were the worst. Dean would, if he was lucky, fall into a fitful sleep, with dreams filled with nothing but Cas. When he woke, there were times he could pretend Cas was only in another room, that he could see him any second. Reality kicked in eventually, it always did, and he knew that he would never see his lover again.
"Why are you so afraid of leaving me alone Dean?"
"That's nice of you."
Dean pulled Cas to him with a soft smile. "That's better." He whispered, reaching up to push Cas's hair away from his forehead. Dean moved to give Cas a kiss but Cas dunked him underwater and swam away. Dean resurfaced and gave Cas a playful smile. "Well if you want to play that way." He pulled Cas underwater by his feet but Cas somehow squirmed away and splashed his way to the shore. Cas plopped down on a rock and Dean lay down next to him. "I love you." Dean whispered, leaning over and tenderly kissing a bruise on Cas's neck.
Cas looked up at him with tears in his eyes and sprinted down the sidewalk. He was sick of it. Of everything he had to go through at home. All the pain and remorse that seemed to be there when he finally thought he might be happy. He wished like a million times before that he could just outrun everything.
(See the end of the chapter for
Dean looked at Cas's still form with soft eyes. "But-"
Dean held Cas tightly, searching his eyes for some sense to what Cas was saying. "I can't," He whispered. "I can't stay quiet knowing your being hurt!"
"Is Cas really an better- less girly?"
"You'd just be lost without me, wouldn't you?" Cas teased with a playful smile.
"Yeah," Cas muttered. "I kinda slept in."
"I think I love anything more than doing laundry." Cas chuckled.
Cas looked around the apartment while crunching on his cereal, the only sound breaking the silence. Bare was a good word to describe it. There were no hangings or pictures on the wall and only a sparse scattering of appliances and furniture.
"Hey, that's not true." Dean said, touching Cas's cheek.
---------------------------------
The faintest voice reached Dean. He closed his eyes for a second, trying to regain his composure. He walked back over to Cas's bedside with a brave smile and took Cas's clammy hand in his own.
Dean laughed softly as they crossed the threshold and back into the bustling mall. "Cas, she'll love it, I promise."
"That doesn't look like nothing to me. Jesus, it looks like you were in a fight or something."
A nurse came in and smiled. "Cas, it's good to see you awake!" She said cheerfully, checking the machines and changing Cas's IV drip. "There you go, all set." She said, giving him a pat on the shoulder. "The doctor should be in in a little while."
"You cold?" Dean asked, already taking off his leather jacket. "That's a stupid question, you must be freezing, here." Dean handed his jacket to Cas, who took it with a small smile.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
There was an uncomfortable silence for a few seconds while Dean recovered. "That's the old girlfriend you were talking about that day, isn't it? That day in the rain on the sidewalk.?"
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dean stuck out his tongue playfully, causing the tips of Cas's ears to turn bright red.
He became quiet and watched the rising and falling of Cas's chest. He gently ran his thumb along Cas's palm and tried to smile. "Damn it, how could you let them hurt you? How could I?" He let out a tiny sigh. "Damn it Cas, I'm sorry. Don't be pissed that I called the cops, what was I supposed to do? Actually, take that back. You can be pissed at me all you want, you just have to wake up."
"Hey," Dean seemed to startle Cas out of his trance and felt bad. "If it's that bad at home, you can always crash at my place."
"You did a really good job, I thought it was completely real."
Dean smiled and tenderly pulled him close. "Me too," He whispered, kissing Cas on the temple. "I can't even remember what I did without you, and babe, I promise you'll never loose me. And as for having no words....well I'm with you there, because that isn't just my thing but every chance I get I'll show you how much you mean to me babe. And I know I'm probably a really crappy boyfriend Cas, but....I'm going to try to never let you down or never let you feel alone. And I swear as long as you love me, I will never ever leave you babe. Okay?"
"Yeah," Dean went to pull his hand away but Cas spoke again. "But not when you touch it....I like that." Cas blushed again and Dean leaned in to kiss him.
"Dean, are you sure you're going to be alright man? I can stay at your place tonight if you want."
"That's pretty neat." Cas said. "Your dad sounds pretty cool."
Cas searched Dean's eyes wordlessly before looking away.
"I'll be just a second." Dean disappeared into the bathroom.
Cas looked at it warily. "And I'm supposed to trust you?" Dean just laughed as Cas hesitantly lifted the flask to his lips. He took a careful sip and made a face. "It burns." He moaned, shoving the flash back at Dean. Dean chuckled.
Dean followed him reluctantly. Cas had run over to a display of t shirts and was looking through them. He stopped dead in his tracks when he came to a t shirt that had his face on it. "Dean," Cas turned to the human, his eyes wide and slightly terrified. "Look," He whispered loudly. "It looks like me."
"Yeah." Cas murmured, smiling down at the floor.
Dean began to hum along softly to the song on the radio and Cas had the urge to open his eyes.
Sam took the hint and retreated from the room.
Cas grinned before closing the door behind him. "Bye."
Dean smiled into the kiss, loving the way Cas wrapped his arms around Dean's neck. Dean loved how perfect they felt together.
"Jesus," Cas whispered. "That's a lot of homework."
Dean swallowed thickly. "Let's just say your lucky I was here. Next time something like that happens, call me, I don't care what time it is."
"Still so shy and embarrassed, damn is it ever cute." Dean murmured. Cas blushed and Dean couldn't help but laugh. "God, I love you."
"Cas?" Dean appeared beside him in concern, his hair already soaking wet.
"It wasn't the real Santa?" Mary asked with disappointment.
Dean watched him carefully. This guy was an enigma wrapped inside a riddle wrapped inside a taco. He grabbed a book and scanned it, stifling a yawn. He snatched an extra notebook and pen and began doodling in the margins.
"Go 'way," Cas mumbled, swatting at him tiredly. "I'm sleeping."
"I hate you." Cas muttered.
"I thought I was going to too!" Cas sat opposite the older man.
Dean handed the flask back to Cas. "Because life sucks." He said simply.
--------------------------------------------------------
"I don't know, I ask myself that question all the time. Cas's face crinkled in a smile as he brushed their shoulders together. "Just love I guess."
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"We should go get your stuff." Dean murmured as his fingers danced across Cas's stomach.
"Cas." Dean couldn't stop saying his name. Dean gently brought Cas's face to his and placed a hand on either cheek. Dean searched Cas's eyes despertly. Cas could see the horrible images replaying over and over in Dean's mind. Dean tried to smile bravely and placed their foreheads together. He gently reached up and brushed Cas's tears away. "How could anybody hurt you?" He wondered aloud in a delicate whisper. He pulled Cas's head down to the crook of his neck and held him against him. All he wanted to do was protect him. "It's your dad, isn't it?" Dean asked shakily, his hands clutching Cas despertly. "Oh God, Cas!" He let out a sob and closed his eyes, knowing Cas wouldn't give him the answer. He took a deep breath and traced a small, comforting circle on Cas's back. "Cas...he-damn it, you don't deserve this!" Dean placed a gentle kiss on Cas's cheek and traced his brow tenderly. "I won't let him hurt you again Cas, I promise-"
"I hate hospitals." Cas said once she had left. "Dad pounded it into my brain that they were bad places, for weak people."
Mary stood at the railing, entranced by what she was seeing. Santa and Dean were dancing! Her wide eyes took in the scene, not really sure what to make of it. She dare not go down there and disturb them, she was supposed to be sleeping! She squinted and her eyes widened even more as Dean leaned in closer and kissed Santa! Her breath caught in her throat and she scrambled back to her room. She crawled under her covers, her mind wheeling. Should she tell Cas? Dean had kissed someone else! And that someone had been Santa Claus!
"Me either." Dean admitted with a shy smile.
Cas grinned as he placed the neatly wrapped present underneath the tree. "Because it is simple."
"Shut up, you don't know Cas." But what his brother had said was true. Cas had the kindest heart and soul. He always looked out for other people before himself. Dean leaned down and gave Cas a kiss on the forehead. "I'll be back, I promise. But I better leave now before Sammy tries to drag me out of here, literally." He paused and watched the rising and falling of Cas's chest. "I love you." Dean hurried out and was sitting in the impala by the time Sam caught up.
"It's just...they had to put him in another induced coma or whatever. I'm not a doctor, so I'm not sure what it's called. He said something about Cas being alert and awake causing problems with the healing process. They said it got bad after you left the hospital last night-Dean, you listening?"
"I missed her too." Cas smiled, wrapping his arms around Dean's waist. "But I missed you most of all. Your car is cool, but you are so much cooler."
Cas smiled sadly. "It's alright, I'm alright. I should get home-"
------------------------------
"See ya sweetie, take care of yourselves."
"Yeah..."
Cas popped to the surface and glared at Dean who was laughing on the shore. "Dean!" Cas roared and went sprinting across the ground. "Damn it Dean, I already went swimming!"
"Come on." Dean laughed. "Best bacon cheeseburgers in the state." Cas reluctantly followed Dean inside. "Hey Ellen." Dean greeted the older looking waitress.
"Actually, no. One of those lucky nights I guess." Cas saw concern flitter across Dean's face and tried to backtrack. "I mean, it's not that bad-"
Cas was about to turn away when something else caught his eye. There were several of the pop vinyls out of the packages and an employee was rearranging them. The employee stepped away with a satisfied smile and Cas cocked his head once again. There was a Dean and Cas doll and they were standing quite close. It looked like.....Cas looked at this scene with immense concentration, trying to figure out this puzzle. "Dean," He turned to his friend who hadn't noticed yet. "Why are they standing so close?" Cas reached out and touched the Dean doll lightly.
At this point Cas reacted violently, shoving Dean away. "No Dean! You can't, no!" He broke off into a sob and fell to the ground in a heap.
"Damn it, how'd you know that?" Dean asked, bumping their shoulders together.
"Maybe next time we should bring swimming trunks."
"Look what I found." Cas whispered, slightly opening his hands so Dean could see the faint glow.
"Dean, it's nothing-"
Cas began to work on taking off Dean's clothes and smiled as he kissed him. "Still hate laundry day?" He whispered into Dean's ear.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"So she'll like it?"
"Well I still need your help." Cas said as he walked further into the store.
"But if Dean doesn't love you anymore then you might get a divorce and-"
"Damn it." He muttered as he followed Cas outside.
"Well it seemed like forever." Ellen replied with an embarrassed smile. She handed them their food. "So, where have you two been?"
"Dean," Sam placed a hand on his brothers shoulder and took a deep breath. "Dr. Wright called me-"
"Dean," Cas murmured when he spotted the figure in the doorway. He seemed to be in a daze and it made Dean's insides clench with anger. "Dean," Cas repeated, his voice becoming a warning. "Go, you shouldn't be here-"
"Not at all." Cas replied, giving him a kiss on the cheek. "Maybe I'm a bad boy too."
Cas shoved his books in his locker and shook his head in agreement.
Dean laughed and clapped him on the shoulder. "Your a special one alright."
Cas laughed and pushed Dean towards the door.
Cas smiled as he leaned down and placed a kiss on Claire's forehead. "Goodnight Claire." Cas whispered before standing up and walking away.
Dean just looked at him for a second and Cas began to regret his witty retort. Then, Dean slapped his knee and laughed. A full, bent over, shoulder shaking laugh. "You," He said as he recovered. "Are awesome." Cas smiled shyly and offered half of his sandwich to Dean. "Nah, but thanks anyway. I'm not hungry." Another minute passed. "Isn't this boring?" Dean asked, stifling a yawn.
They rolled to a stop and Dean smiled over at him. "Good, I'd really hate to kill you, too messy."
"Sammy's a good kid, smart, he deserves it."
"Well, Cas can cook." Dean said with a slight grudge in his voice.
Dean turned quickly and almost walked right into a table. He walked away as quickly as he could, scanning the store for tan trench coat. He found Cas a few isles over, standing in front of a display. "Did you find anything yet?" Dean growled. As he approached the angel he noticed the way Cas's head was cocked and the confusion on his face. "Cas, you okay?" Dean reached him and touched his shoulder.
"All that shit she said about us, what did you think of it?"
"Damn it Cas," Dean muttered as he messaged Cas for the millionth time that day. "Answer your God damn phone." He stood up, his stomach churning as the bell rang. For the first time in his life, he was the first one to class.
They were out of view of the school now and Cas took Dean's hand and skipped through the parking lot, a huge grin emerging on his face. He twirled around in the sprinkling of rain and laughed aloud as Dean caught up to him and shoved him in the car.
Dean shed his leather jacket and removed a flask from the inside pocket. He took a seat on a large rock. Cas took a seat on the rock next to Dean and took off his sweater. The weather was getting warmer. To a certain extent, that made Cas happy, but it also made it harder to cover up. Walking around in a sweater in 30 degree Celsius weather looked a bit odd. He made sure his arms were covered and threw his sweater to the ground. "How'd you find this place?" Cas asked.
Dean searched his face, but said nothing. He was trying to respect Cas's insane protectiveness over his personal problems he just wouldn't spill.
Dean was startled for a second but placed a gentle kiss on Cas's temple. Inside, he was just dying for that. To just forget everything and spend ever day with Cas. However,it was just a simple fantasy, one Dean knew would never happen. "I'd love that." He murmured quietly.
"I still love you." Dean murmered once they had finally come to a stop. Dean's thumb gently caressed Cas's cheekbone. "I'll always love you, nothing or nobody is ever going to stop me."
Dean gulped back his tears and awkwardly laughed. "Not like you've ever asked before."
They veered into the theater parking lot and Cas's head popped up curiously. "Wanna see a movie?" Dean asked with a cute grin.
"Hey! Where are you going?" Dean asked as he hurriedly tried to gather the remaining laundry from the floor. "Cas!" He could hear Cas laughing and thundered down the stairs to find his partner standing in front of the washer with a smug smile on his face.
Cas smiled sadly. "I wish I could Dean."
"Exactly, I'm waiting." Dean smirked. Cas let out a humph and Dean kissed him gently. "Alright, I'm sorry Cas. I sure as hell won't ever challenge your cooking skills again."
They drove around aimlessly for half an hour, Cas lying his head on Dean's shoulder. He finally decided to pull into the garage parking lot and shut off the engine. "I'd go to the falls, but you know," Dean said, motioning outside. "It's raining."
"...yeah, I'm sorry Mary."
"A little." Cas said, gingerly stretching his arms above his head.
Dean got up and followed him. "Why not?" Cas shrugged his shoulders as he piled their arms with books and headed back to their table. "So....what's your favorite band?" Cas shrugged his shoulders. "What's your favorite TV show?" Cas shrugged his shoulders. "Favorite movie?" Cas shrugged his shoulders once again. "Okay dude, seriously, enough with the freaking shoulder shrugging." Cas buried his head in a book, hoping Dean would take the hint. He did. He even picked up a book himself and leafed through it.
Cas smiled over at him with a twinkle in his eye. "So?"
Dean clenched his jaw and reached to take Cas's hand. It was a simple decision really. Cas had always been so concerned about other people. He had always put everyone else before himself and now it was Dean's turn to return the favor. Cas's safety and peace was more important than Dean's own selfishness.
Dean pulled into a gravel parking lot and parked the impala. He got out and helped Cas out of the car.
----------------------------------------------------------
"Maybe not quite so much." Dean murmured with a grin.
He tried to cover them up the best he could, but there was no way to hide the cut under his left eye or the bruise on his left cheek. He debated for half a second of not even going to school. There would be questions after all, but they had to finish their project. And Cas had to get out. He had to get away from his father and this house. School was the best option, an escape.
"Of course I can." Dean laughed as he kissed the back of Cas's neck. "Of course I would."
Dean mumbled as Cas snickered.
"Because they don't know me, I'm very mysterious." Cas waggled his eyebrows, causing Dean to laugh.
Dean shrugged his shoulders, not a care in the world. "It happens." He walked back out to the kitchen and Cas trailed after him. "But I suppose your in a big rush to get to school." Dean rolled his eyes.
"Exactly, it's mine. So I can give it to whoever I want, and I want to give it to you."
"Yup, I'm a well known serial killer." Dean said with a straight face. "In fact, you don't want to know what is in my trunk." Cas's face turned white and Dean laughed. "Actually, there is this spot I like to hang out at. It has like waterfalls and crap...I know it's probably weird."
Cas made a face as Dean took another drink. "How can you drink that stuff?"
"Okay Castiel."
"Seriously-"
Dean obliged but watched as Cas opened the box with a small smile. He finished emptying Cas's closet and hesitantly knelt down beside his boyfriend.
"I'm kidding babe, your perfect."
Cas took a seat in the chair in the corner, turning the television on low. There he stay all night as he watched over his humans.
"Pretty, isn't it?" Dean asked. He got out of the car but left the music on loud enough for them to hear.
The bell rang and Dean could see Cas practically squirming to get away. "Yeah." Cas hurried down the hallway and Dean watched him leave.
"But I love you." Cas whispered, his voice threatening tears.
"How's your back feeling?" Dean asked worriedly as he pulled Cas close to him in the hallway.
"I wouldn't put it past you." Dean smirked as Cas threw an oven mitt at him.
"You gonna pick those up?" Dean asked playfully, referring to Cas's books and papers laying scattered on the floor.
Cas snorted. "Yeah, how could I be so delusional?" He laughed.
"Hey." Dean said sleepily as Cas picked himself up from the floor. "You okay?"
"I...I fell."
"No you don't." Dean moved away and picked up the textbooks closest to him.
Cas mumbled something inaudible and took a sip of his coffee. "I freaking hate mornings."
"No way I'm leaving." Dean stood his ground. "The second I leave you'll call some fancy restaurant for delivery."
"I love you." Cas murmured, his voice slightly slurred and wobbly.
"You know, maybe your an alien. Maybe thats why you don't talk, because you don't know the language very well and if people noticed they might find out your an alien and kick you off Earth, which you don't want to happen because despite the whole solitude, no talking, loner thing you have going on, you like Earth." Cas looked at him and tried not to laugh, although a smile did slip through. "Ah, there it is. I was beginning to wonder if aliens were emotionless as well." Cas gave him a look that said he was crazy. "So, you want to head to the library or your house or something?-"
"Yeah, bye Dean."
Dean grinned. "Your a good liar, I'll give you that."
"Just don't cut a finger off or anything. I really don't want to have to drive you to the emergency room."
"I love you too." Dean gave him another kiss.
"Cas!" Dean cried, instinctively running over to the still body. "Oh God, Cas." He knelt beside him and felt for a pulse, breathing a small sigh of relief at the steady beating underneath his fingertips. He dug around in his pocket shakily for his cell phone, finally finding it and dialing 911.
"Canon?" Cas questioned before Dean could drag the angel away.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
He climbed in his car, but even that didn't feel right. It felt empty, because he knew Cas should have been sitting right there next to him. Dean pulled away, feeling even more numb.
"I know." Cas smiled sadly and touched Dean's lips with his index finger. "Someday." He closed his eyes and wished with everything that that was true. Dean pressed his lips against Cas's and slipped his arm around Cas's waist. Cas kissed him back and felt a soft hum of happiness grow inside him. He pulled away with an embarrassed smile, his cheeks flaming. As close as he'd gotten, he was still shy, still terrified to expect too much. "God, the thought of anybody hurting you...." Dean unconsciously clenched his fists and Cas touched his shoulder gently to get his attention.
Then the door closed behind him but the words still echoed in his head.
"I thought you were going to have a heart attack when she said that." Dean laughed as he sat down by the tree.
Dean laughed as he pulled Cas out of bed, who landed on the floor with a thump.
"Thanks Cas." Claire smiled and put the chain around her neck. "I love it." Claire hugged Cas before lying back down.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"Or maybe you're just shy."
"Thanks Dean, I'll be fine." Cas placed the blanket back on the passenger seat and walked away into the darkness.
"Yeah, thanks anyhow." Cas said softly, reaching over and touching Dean's arm. Dean smiled back at him softly and Cas smiled blissfully, because he'd finally found a home, Dean.
Dean took Cas's hand with a wide smile and pulled Cas close for few precious seconds before sprinting and launching himself into the water, Cas clutching his hand wildly.
Snap.
"Shit." Benny murmured. "Fuck."
"I know boy." Bobby replied, placing a hand on Dean's shoulder. "But I've never seen you this serious about someone. They're going to have to find out sooner or later."
Cas rolled his eye again and slammed his locker shut as the bell rang.
"School." Dean said bluntly, stabbing a mouthful of fries and hoping they would get the hint.
Cas looked over at him and it was that moment he wished despertly that he could lie well. "We move around a lot." He said,shrugging his shoulders nonchontly. "I guess I find it easier if I don't get close to anybody."
"Exactly, my house so my rules. And I say you get the bed." Dean gave him a triumphant smile as he threw his car keys on the table and jumped onto the couch.
"I'm sorry Cas." Dean whispered as he continued working.
They fell into a silence for the rest of the class. That is, until they began to pack up their things before the bell rang. "So, we working on this again today after school?" Dean asked.
"Sorry again. I'll see you monday, okay? I gotta help dad with the truck the rest of this weekend."
"Ah...no." Cas let out a small laugh. "Guess I wasn't thinking too well."
Cas looked up at Dean tenderly. "Yes you will Dean. I know your not a bad person, even if you think you are. Dean, your....your amazing and I want you to believe that. Please, if anything, believe that." Dean's eyes misted over and his heart clenched.
"No." Cas replied simply.
"How long?" Dean asked quietly, playing with a curl of hair at the back of Cas's head.
"No, it's your knight in shining armor." Dean whispered with a soft smile. Cas let out a soft laugh and buried himself closer to Dean. "Come on," Dean said, poking Cas in the ribs with a smile. "You gotta get up for school."
"Okay, laundry." Cas said sternly as he stepped away from Dean.
The worst thing was that when Dean finally broke down and mourned his loss, the one person who he wanted to comfort him wasn't there.
"How did you get out of class so fast?" Cas asked as Dean was waiting for him once the lunch bell rang.
"Seriously,a secret compartment?" Dean asked.
Dean had to bite his lip to keep from laughing at his husbands face.
Cas let out a squeak as he was pulled away from the crowd of people and around the corner. "Hey!" He cried, but his tone softened when he saw Dean. "Hey." He repeated, softly this time.
"I'm sorry Dean."
Dean chuckled and poked Cas in the ribs. "I'm going to take a shower, make yourself comfortable."
"Dean?" Dean turned around and spotted Dr. Wright standing in the doorway. "May I speak with you?"
"Even more than doing laundry?"
"Oh yeah, your a total rebel alright. Underage drinking and skipping classes, they better watch out for you." Dean teased.
"I know." Cas mumbled.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"Cas! I saw Dean kissing Santa Claus!" She whispered worriedly.
already
"Okay." Mary whispered as she snuggled up against him. "I won't tell anyone, I promise!"
"No."
"Ho Ho Ho." Cas said weakly as he managed to make his way over to the child.
"Hey you." Cas smiled, his voice hoarse and low from lack of use. Dean smiled and took his hand, gently locking their fingers together. He wanted to lean down and hold him tightly, desperately needing to know he wasn't imagining this, but decided it was better not to. He was afraid to push too far. Cas searched his eyes and smiled. "My hero." Dean let out a little laugh and blushed. "Saving the damsel in distress,such a night in shining armor."
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Cas rubbed the sleep from his eyes and blinked. "What time is it?"
Dean sighed loudly. "Okay,but this is not over." He gave Cas a kiss on the cheek before Cas scurried away.
"Why? What do you want to do?"
Cas swatted his hand away. "I'm sleeping." He mumbled. "Leave me alone." Dean laughed and turned up the volume knob on the stereo. Cas moaned and turned to face Dean. His eyes slowly opened and he glared at Dean before turning the volume back down below ear splitting. "I hate you." He mumble, rubbing his eyes groggily.
"You tried to run away before?" But Cas had clammed up, realizing he'd said too much already. "You wanna go get some dinner?"
Dean hesitantly took a bite and couldn't contain his smile. "Damn," He murmured once he swallowed. "Well, I lost that one."
"..When you love someone...sometimes it means letting them go."
Cas got up and logged onto one of the computers. Dean followed. Cas was surprised to find Dean standing over him. "We did a pretty good job." Dean announced, clapping Cas on the back encourginly.
Cas shook his head with a small smile. "Sure, I totally believe that."
Cas looked down at the floor. "Dean, we had better get back."
Cas adjusted the collar of his shirt so none of the new bruises were invisible and nearly jumped when Dean leaned against his locker. "Jesus!" He cried. "You scared me!"
Dean dropped Cas down on the bed and Cas pulled Dean down to him, placing a tender kiss on his lips. "I love you." Dean breathed, his hands everywhere, making Cas feel everything. "I fucking love you Cas." He whispered again, his breath hot against Cas's ear. Dean's fingers expertly undid the buttons on Cas's shirt while Cas's fingers fumbled. Dean smiled softly and placed his hands over Cas's to help him. Dean leaned down and placed a gathering of kisses on his collarbone, delicately tracing the scars and bruises that dotted Cas's body. "Your beautiful." Dean whispered and there were tears in Cas's eyes because he'd tried to hard to believe that but deep down he never had. Now all of it was changing, someone was finally making him feel beautiful.
"Thanks." Cas said honestly, watching the darkened world pass outside the window. It was quite for a few more minutes. Cas wished Dean would put on some music or something but it seemed like he had more to say
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"So what now?" Dean asked as they finished.
"Your kidding me, right? I'm practically tone deaf. I'd make babies cry" Despite what he was saying, a blush was creeping over his face. Maybe he was okay, but that didn't mean he wanted to sing in front of people.
"Well I don't know about you, but I'm starving." Dean announced.
"That day we were going to go swimming. We said we'd jump in together but we never did." Cas smiled as Dean rolled over to him and kissed him playfully. "Do you want to go swimming?"
"I don't think so." Dean laughed as Cas spun his locker combination.
Dean abruptly detached his lips from Cas's and searched his eyes worriedly, wondering if he'd gone too far. Cas smiled shyly as Dean touched their foreheads together. "That was....nice." Cas murmured.
An ant crawled by and Dean stepped on it with his shoe. Cas looked over at him, horrified and Dean laughed. "What? I was protecting your food. You could at least say thank you."
"Shh." Dean murmured, gently touching the back of Cas's neck to relax him.
Cas smiled shyly over at his husband.
Bobby shook his head with a smile and turned to Dean. "You tell your parents yet?" He asked quietly, his gaze going from Cas to Dean. It seemed he knew exactly what was going on.
competition
"Oh." Dean tapped his finger against the desk and sighed loudly. "This class is so boring."
"Oh, I will." Cas promised as he tickled her tummy.
"Oh, hey Bobby, I almost forgot, this is Cas, he likes my car." Dean grinned.
"I'm gonna start working on Sammy's mustang today. I hope you don't mind. But you can tag along, I might need your help."
"Shut up you," Cas smiled shyly. "Sucking up won't help any."
There was nothing that needed to be said.
"Come on Cas." Dean said, trying to hide another smirk.
"But-"
Cas picked at a loose thread on the blanket before meeting Dean's eyes again. "I just never expected this." He said with a soft laugh. "I never thought you....I mean, come on, your a total hit with the ladies. I just never thought I'd feel...."
Cas followed him in awe, standing by the edge of the water and admiring the scenery. The waterfall made a gentle splashing sound that was oddly comforting and the cliffs with the bushed and trees...it all took his breath away.
"I don't know, I never pay attention. Half an hour maybe?"
"No Dean! Don't you dare!" Cas shouted, flailing his arms and legs wildly. "Dean!" He squealed as he fell into the water with a splash.
Dean raised an eyebrow. "If I didn't know any better, I'd think you were trying to get rid of me." Cas rolled his eyes and smiled down at his desk. "So, you wanna hang out after school?"
already
"Shut up." Cas said, stowing his textbook back in his messenger bag. "You do know the project is over, right? You don't have to sit here anymore."
"No..."
He turned to the younger and pinned him against the wall again. "I'm going to make sure neither of you ever lay a fucking finger on him again!" Dean felt a rage build inside him and his heartbeat sped up from the adrenaline pumping through his body. Oh, how badly he wanted to punch him, to hurt him, to even kill him. But the thought of Cas lying on the floor helplessly cleared his head. He had to get his priorities straight. He could deal with those two assholes later, right now it was Cas who was important. He backed away and knelt beside Cas as he heard the ambulance pull up.
"You think you cam protect me but you can't Dean! Anybody who tries to stop it, they get hurt, even die! That teacher in 4th grade, my dad set her house on fire and then we left town the next day! And Meg...oh God...!" Cas let out a soft sob. "She tried and now....now she's dead! She's dead Dean! I know every instinct is telling you otherwise, but please, just forget it! I can't go through this again! I just can't Dean! I can't loose you!"
"Oh God, are you drunk?" Dean asked, trying to hold in his laughter. "Jesus Cas, it was only one beer." "I love you,"
Dean met his gaze but turned away before Cas could detect the wetness in his eyes. "I love you Cas, but you have to let it go. It'll be okay, you just have to let go of it all."
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Cas spun around, gathered a pile of laundry in his arms and sprinted down the stairs.
okay there are a few f bombs in this chapter and i was debating changing the rating to mature because of that but i just tagged it as strong language instead.
"Shut up." Cas said, pretending to be angry and shoving Dean away.
"Oh God." Dean sank into the nearest chair.
"Shut up." Cas shot back, but he said it with a smile. They turned off the main road onto a narrow dirt road and Cas looked around cautiously. "Your not going to take me out here to kill me are you?" Cas asked, stifling a nervous laugh.
Dean backed away and gave the girl a crazy look. "Ah-"
"Yeah right." Dean laughed. He lowered his voice and smirked. "That's what you get for fantasizing about me all night." Cas rolled his eyes and gave him the finger. "Aw, I'm so hurt babe." Dean laughed. "Such a rude gesture from such a nice boy." Cas glared at him, a smile playing at the corner of his lips.
Sam coughed in a way that let Dean know he was uncomfortable, but he didn’t care. He needed him to say it, to acknowledge it. They wouldn’t be able to move on until the fact indicated by Dean’s cloudy eyes and far off look finally felt normal.
“Sorry- the minute you said ‘blow your brains out’, my mind went to dirtier places.”
He wanted Castiel next to him, but then he wanted to be alone.
Dean laughed, if not just to boost both of their moods, and ruffled Sam’s hair as he walked away. “‘Course not, princess.”
of me. Which, excuse my language, but holy shit.”
“Humans sure do evolve quickly. Trapping a Reaper?" He was impressed, which was an emotion Dean could tell was hard to come by when it came to him. “Do you need my help for anything at all?”
“You should buy it.”
“Everything I did, everything we sacrificed- it was worth it. Because in the end, I can have you next to me and not worry about... losing you anymore. I can be with you. And I can kiss you, and dance with you, and
Dean wasted no time in checking out from the near-empty motel and took long strides towards the familiar black Chevrolet Impala, preparing to put the tires to cold asphalt yet again until he reached the southern city. He let his hand settle on the door handle and remain there for a while, feeling the cold air nip at his lungs as he took a long breath and let it escape, and he gave a final nod to no one when he at last opened the driver’s door. This was the only way he could make it up to him, make it up to Sam, make it up to himself- and everything he did from this point on would be for that goal and that goal alone.
“Don’t be mad just because you’re single.” Dean winked, putting his arm back in his jacket sleeve.
Dean finally reunites with his brother and chooses to put aside the thought of making easy conversation in favor of the priority of formulating how to get *him* back. A passive aggressive argument and tons of apologizing ensues.
“I might have been wrong.” Sam admitted slowly- much to the curiosity of his older brother- and shuffled in his backpack, yanking out an old Stanford notebook from years ago and flicking to the end page before slamming it down on the middle of the table. “Check this out.”
“And I know that
Dean got ready to toss Sam a weak insult, briefly sitting up and pointing his finger in the air, but his mouth ran dry when he saw the same blue and red police lights from earlier that night flash against the trees, and he slammed back onto his seat. Sam’s snicker at his panic was very much not appreciated, and he told him so through the middle finger he gave him.
“No,” Dean said it with a scrunched nose and a narrowed stare, stopping to smile when he heard Sam chuckle in the background.  “I was only doing that because I had a dream you got married before me.” It was a lie, a bad one, but did it's job well enough.
want Dean to accept his death, it was impossible anyway. Dean could never accept what had happened in that small cramped room, what he saw as he laid slumped on the cold linoleum tile and watched his life disintegrate piece by piece, and it was obvious by his newly sunken eyes and his tired face, by his weakened body and his hoarse voice. Dean couldn’t help but try, because he knew that trying was the only thing he could do to keep himself from giving up entirely.
“What can I say?” Joel thunked the side of Dean’s head with the same sly grin he always wore.  “I’d feel bad if you carried it all by yourself.”
There, like an Achille’s heel ready to tear at any moment, sat two of the three police officers from last night right by the entrance of the hospital. They didn’t seem to have noticed them, with their food in hand and their lips moving in a fast-paced conversation that Dean couldn’t and didn’t want to hear, but they were close enough to Dean’s objective to where they could and would cause a decent enough problem if they caught sight of him or his brother.
With the signing of the receipt and the artificial ‘thank you’ from the waiter, the two men left to go their separate ways with the plan of hitting the road immediately after Dean got the pie he wanted from the homestyle bakery that sat next door. In minutes, he had ordered, and even sooner, he had paid for what he wanted. He didn’t want to wait for too long, just in case Sam had found something already, and tried to rush out of there as fast as he could, pushing the door open with his back as soon as he got his pie and stepped from the store with his to-go box in hand.
Dean chose not to think about it as he felt that he already knew the answer, watching Sam’s back get smaller and smaller until it ultimately disappeared behind the white hotel door, and instead went right back into the routine he had been planning for himself ever since he first stepped into the lobby.
.” Dean said pointedly. “That was why it would have been bought with the ‘Dean’s Pie Fund’ account, and not the work one.
Cas puffed, but snatched one of Dean’s hands and led him to the park’s entrance, finding a small park bench by an old oak tree and directing him to the seat. The two ate their lunch and made idle conversation in the meantime, relishing in the moment of just being alone, and peace floated around in the atmosphere as relaxed and serene as an old love song.
“I heard that.” Joel replied, setting the flowers down in the windowsill. They replaced another, older pot of withered flowers, chock full of used Newport cigarette butts that were squashed in the soil, and the sight of it made Dean's stomach churn until he turned his focus back to the conversation at hand.
He almost corrected him, saying that the only one who would be fighting Ephraim would be Dean himself, but he kept his mouth shut and saved it for later. It would be funnier to mention, or rather rub in his brother’s face, after the fight was over. “We just might be, Sam. We just might be.”
When he opened the door of the bathroom, smelling of cologne and feeling fresher than ever, he saw a 6-pack of his favorite beer sitting out on the table. He noticed Sam back from his ‘trip’ and preparing to go into the shower after Dean did, with his clothes in hand, and whistled at just how long he had been in the bathroom. Time flies when you’re not pressuring yourself to find a way to save your long time lover from the afterlife, he guessed.
“Did you, Dean?”
He could have done a million things to Sam in that moment, like scream, or shout, or throw a punch filled with all of the fury he had been keeping hidden in the depths of his soul, but he  decided to turn his attention to the cars that passed by and answer Sam’s question with his own, instead.
“Here we are- room 205.” Sam jabbed the keycard into the lock with a sharp click, swinging the door open. Before they could settle into the hotel room, Sam snapped and muttered a few curses under his breath, grabbing his wallet suddenly from his bag and turning back around towards the door. “I forgot to get something on the way here- a celebratory gift. I’ll be back in a second.”
done whatever you wanted.” Joel quipped with a smirk, though his tense adam’s apple that hung suspended in the middle of his throat showed that he wasn’t happy with the situation in the slightest. “But before I go-” With a slow, airy step, he walked to Maryanne with a wink and brightened at the sound of her laughter like she had told him a wonderful secret.
“Teach me how to shoot again, Cas.”
“You’re trapped with the grace you’re given.” Joel took a breath and blew up billowy puffs of smoke, keeping his eyes focused on the grey clouds as he and Dean stared silently out at the parking lot. “You can never turn it off, and in my case, it serves as a constant reminder that you’ve been tasked with the hassle that is giving humans ‘heavenly guidance’.”
“It’s about Castiel.”
Before Castiel could make a move to leave, packing up the rest of their food with a soft rustle of the plastic bags, Dean slipped a gun he had taken from the trunk of the car out of his pocket and showed it off like a badge of honor, putting a finger in the air to silence any objections that would come his way and clearing his throat.
"I'm sorry for your loss, by the way."
When the older Winchester didn’t respond, Sam put his hands in the air defensively. “That was in bad taste.”
“I missed you, brother.”
He swallowed, tensing up at the words and widening his eyes at how easily and effortlessly Cas could say them in that same tone of his. He didn’t know how to respond to that, so he didn’t say anything at all, and he heard a small snort come from the other side of the picnic table.
“As in… Joseph’s son, Ephraim? The angel that was
From the ground came a black, murky substance, one that flew into Dean’s nose and sent his entire head jerking backwards; and instantaneously disappeared once its job was done.
why I did it that way.”
“I told you already. I won’t go
“Do you recognize what that is?”
“Just who did you take this power from, Ephraim?” Dean fumbled about in the chair, but it was no use to pretend that he had a chance of escaping. “Who did you steal it from?”
“Shut up and give me your money, or else I’m gonna blow your brains out and take it myself.”
“Its worth a shot.” Dean noted with a face that was too stubborn to admit that Sam had come through yet again with another piece of vital information. Putting his phone back in his pocket and looking around one last time, he sat up and moved to turn the car on, but when he noticed Sam glaring at him like a deer in headlights, he stopped.
“I don’t remember.”
with a certain
Nice and easy, like a river of well-aged whiskey, Joel laughed- and when Maryanne followed suit, Dean felt the sensation of loneliness grow that much stronger as he waited for the two of them to remember that they weren’t the only two people who existed on the planet. When he turned to Sam, he found that his younger brother looked more than used to it, and wondered if the emotion he felt then was what it was like to be a third wheel. Shuffling on his feet and wondering just how long it would take for them to acknowledge his existence again, Dean clasped his hands together silently and breathed a sigh of relief when their string of connection had finally been cut and they looked back at their two guests.
. I already thought about it, over and over again.” Dean confessed, hanging his head low to the ground and clenching his jaw. “But I can’t-- I won’t let this chance slip past without even trying to go through with it, Sam. I don’t have anything to lose, anymore.”
The mother gasped at that, pulling both her daughter and the caged family pet away from Sam as Dean walked off of the elevator with a faux huff of disgust, and Sam looked more than mortified as he scrambled out of the elevator right along with him, whispering small apologies to the tiny family of two whose mood he had probably just ruined. Dean had forgotten how good it felt to make his little brother look bad in public, and the reminder gave him an extra pep in his step all while Sam whisper-cried in his ear about how ‘that kid most definitely had almost all of her innocence wiped out now’ and how he ‘couldn’t ever be able to trust him in an elevator again’.
“You’re the reaper?” Sam’s eyes widened before squinting back to their original shape, the shock of her presence almost immediately drying in his senses when he remembered that it was far from the first time he had seen one of the suited spirits. "I know its a bit late, but thanks. For doing this."
” Now it was time for Sam to laugh, low and hearty, and Dean shot him a fiery glower until his brother decided to quiet down.
“And you didn’t elect to pull out this list earlier?”
“Here.” Castiel directed him to an unknown but intimate hunk of steel and aluminum and let his hands wander around it like a lost child, making sure to feel every aspect of it and let the texture be ingrained into his mind. Dean felt something, like he was onto something, but he wasn’t going to lie- he had no fucking clue what the thing in his hands was.
She was older, most likely in her late 50’s or middle 60’s, but she had a certain southern charm about her that made her brown skin sparkle against the fluorescent lights that shone over her bed and a sharpness in her cheekbones that made her seem 20 or 30 years younger than she was. If you tried hard enough, you could almost forget the wires that were hooked up to her fingers and stuck to her body, and if you tried even harder, you could see her in any situation other than the one she was in at that moment, dressed in a flowing floral dress instead of her bland hospital gown and busying herself with the preparation of a cake instead of previously staring out of the window with a tired posture and a thick book on dream interpretation resting on her lap. As Joel passed by them, Dean could feel the discomfort radiate off of him, and noticed that they weren’t the only ones who weren’t a fan of being in hospital rooms.
And when they finally stood up, breathless and exhausted, they were met with The Empty itself, wearing a thousand faces, a thousand eyes and a thousand voices that changed with each second. Frightening shit.
“It is.” Dean interjected, quickly pointing at the faded picture that had caught his attention in the motel originally. “That’s just like what I saw when it happened, Sam. The smoke, and the bubbles, and the ooze, everything. The author even has the written description of it down to a damn science.”
“For Castiel?”
Dean sighed in the most dramatic way he could, though the grin on his face was betraying the ‘begrudging’ attitude he was trying to have, and he took Cas’ hand like it was made for him and only him to hold for every day of his life.
“I always thought that I’d be alone. I would see Sam with his girlfriends, and I just… I didn’t think anyone would ever like me enough to be with me like that. To care about me. To love me. But then came you, with your weird little trench coat and your smile that made me… feel things… and everything I thought back then turned upside down all of a sudden.” He cleared his throat and felt butterflies start to flutter in his chest, this ‘confession’ making him feel an all new layer of discomfort that he was both addicted to and dreaded. “When you told me you-- When you told me what you said,”
“Listen. I don’t know who you are, or how in the hell you know what we’re after, and I don’t care, either.” Dean turned towards the shop’s owner and leaned closer down to her face, matching her threatening look with his own and snatching his arm out of her grip. “The only I care about is getting him back, because he’s--”
There they were. Sam, and Mary- and a man fully dressed in grey, unrecognizable with his back turned to the window but still familiar with his short auburn hair and freckled white neck as he tossed a matchbox up and down in the air. They were waving at him, with the exception of the stranger in grey, their own versions of beckoning smiles tucked between their lips and their eyes beaming with the recognition of the man who stood a distance from the Victorian-styled brick walls, and eagerly they told him to ‘Come Closer’ and to ‘Not be afraid’ of crossing the invisible line that divided them.
He said it like it was common knowledge, but when his floaty sounding answer was met with 4 equally bewildered eyes, Joel shook his head and ran exasperated fingers in his short black hair.
As soon as the door opened, furniture was moved and salt was laid to create the Reaper Trap. It was simple enough to remember, after seeing it in John’s book and then again in Bobby’s, and Dean and Sam stared at each other triumphantly before turning back to complete the last step of the plan.
“But he wasn’t going to take a no, because he was ‘God’s Favorite’.” He mocked. “He was the ‘Chosen one’, and he had to make sure I knew it. So one night,  just when I thought everything was safe and he was finally gone, he lit her family’s house ablaze and watched us run out of it while we watched our world crumble apart-- making sure he let us leave with our lives before he sealed the doors shut and locked the rest of Maryanne’s family inside.” He paused, licking his dry lips and taking another hit of his cigarette.  “Because of me-”
"Jeez, sounds pretty painful." Dean laughed, tracing the exposed scar on the small of Cas's back.
"Oh." Claire lifted the locket up to inspect it. "This is actually kind of pretty..."
Dean laughed and reached over to snag a piece of Cas's apple. "We should totally go to the diner."
"Um, hey."
The bell rang and Cas shook his head. "Hey, good luck on your test." Dean said, plopping the calculator down and taking off with a grin.
"I thought she was right." Cas whispered almost inaudibly. "I thought she was right and that is why it hurts."
"I won." Cas declared.
Dean concentrated on his steps. One foot in front of the other. It gave him something to concentrate on instead of the feeling of loss taking over every inch of him. He had to get out of there. He restrained himself from sprinting right out the doors and settled for a brisk walk.
Cas walked over to where Dean lay and watched him. He looked so peaceful, if only he could make Dean feel that way every day. He hated the way worry clung to him like a shadow. He leaned down and placed a kiss on Dean's forehead. "Goodnight Dean." He murmured as he smoothed Dean's hair back with his hand. "I hope you have a nice sleep."
Finally, at Dean's encouragement, Cas took another sip.
They walked into the eerily silent school and signed in at the office. Cas saw the principal moving towards them and gulped. "Ah Dean. You finally decided to grace us with your presence. Although I didn't expect this out of you Cas."
"Cas....I don't want to talk about this." Dean said abruptly. "I'm not letting you go for anything, so can we drop it?" Cas studied him carefully but shook his head yes. "Good, lets go get some food. I'm starving."
"Hey lazy bones." Dean laughed as Cas stirred beside him.
"Nuh uh."
"Lucky." Dean grumbled and grabbed his jacket. Cas picked up his sweater and followed Dean over to the car. "You can come hang out at the shop if you want." Dean offered.
"Yeah, but it could have waited-"
"Well," Dean said, taking a swig from his flask and making a face. "That's a long story, but I guess we have time." He offered the flask to Cas but he shook his head no. "Dad used to take me here as a kid I guess. At least that's what Dad says. I don't really remember. I was really little. Although sometimes I do get these flashbacks sometimes and I remember small bits." A small smile came over Dean's face. "It was always so happy and when Sammy was old enough we'd take him with us. We'd spend the entire day here. We'd make a bonfire and roast marshmallows and hot dogs and just lie here and watch the stars. Mom always got mad at Dad for keeping us out past out bedtime. We'd always fall asleep in the car on the way home, but that didn't stop him from taking us. God, it was nice back then. Sometimes don't you wish you could go back and be a kid again? It was so damn easy back then."
Dean released the firefly and they both watched as it flew up to it's twinkling friends.
"Well you can't stand over my shoulder either, so go do something." Cas instructed.
"Love you too Dean."
"Your obviously not comfortable here, so we're leaving-now."
"Can we at least go for another walk?" Dean reluctantly took Cas's hand, causing him to grin. "You know," Cas said wistfully. "I'd love to live out here. We should build a place out here, buy the land...."
Dean pulled to the curb and gave Cas a tentative wave. "Alright I guess. See ya."
"Do you still have it?" Cas asked quietly, his eyes shining. Cas must have been thinking the same things Dean had been.
Finally, he left the hospital and found himself sitting in his car. The passenger seat was eerily empty. It was then Dean finally broke down. The shoulder shaking sobs emerged as rain began to pour down from the sky, only encouraging his grief.
"You need a ride home?" A polite way of telling her he in fact did want to be alone.
"It was only a couple of days Ellen." Dean gave a gentle shake of his head and smiled.
"Okay, sorry." The nurse said, handing Cas a container with a few pills in it. "Well it's time to take your medications."
"I know." Dean agreed with a small sigh. "But we'll get through it, okay?" Cas still stood there and Dean sighed again. "Don't make me push you." Cas reluctantly entered the classroom, giving Dean one last smile.
positive
"Thanks." Cas said softly, reaching up to plant a kiss on Dean's forehead.
Cas let out an awkward laugh. "Nuh uh,not me....Dad did actually. Well, before...." Cas searched through the compartment and found a 1967 Impala, laughing in astonishment. "God, I forgot I had this." He ran his hand over it with a small smile before placing it in Dean's hand. "Here, I want you to have this-"
"I gotta work after school today. So I was wondering if you wanted to hang out now?"
"Waking up, that's good isn't it?"
"Okay." Cas whispered as he leaned his head against Dean's shoulder.
Dean pulled up a chair by Cas's bedside and took Cas's limp hand in his own. Memories seemed to come out of nowhere, swamping him, no-bombarding him-. "I wish I couldn't feel a damn thing." He murmured, his eyes filling with tears.
Cas crossed his arms. "I hate this place."
"She never told me that either." Cas confessed.
"Boy, do I feel bad for you." Dean said. "I'll be right back." He disappeared out back and Cas could hear the faint sound of an engine starting.
"I love you."
They fell into another silence, but neither minded. It was a comfortable silence. It was nice to be around someone and not have to say anything, it was special.
"Damn it."  Dean muttered, the tweezers hovering over the next wound. "I don't want to do this, I can't hurt you."
"He'll be fine." Dean said, his voice hard and pushed past the doctor to get to Cas's room. He stopped mid step when he saw Cas's blue eyes looking up at him with love.
"I mean, Cas rebelled for Dean, he fell for Dean! He would give up everything for Dean Winchester! And Dean, well he never really believed in anything about higher powers before Cas. The angel who raised him from perdition, who told him that he deserved to be saved. And the apocalypse! Ohmychuck, and season 7 and 8, like seriously, the destiel is so strong I expected it to go canon those seasons. In season 7 where Cas dies and Dean keeps the trench coat! He kept Castiel's trench coat I was crying so much at that part! Like they are so in love and I just wish they could see it! And purgatory! Dean was so damn determined to get Cas out with him! And the hug! Ohmychuck, the iconic hug!" The girl sighed longingly.
Cas spread their books over the table and resumed his notes. "So," Dean started, propping his feel up on the table. "Whats with the whole loner, no talking thing at school?"
-----------------------------------------------------------------
"You live around here?" Dean asked.
Dean laughed aloud at this. "God, I love you."
"That's an understatement." Cas said with a small rueful smile.
"Can...can I see him?" Ellen asked with a tremor in her voice.
"Hey, pick on someone else." Cas mumbled through a mouthful of his sandwich.
Cas gave him a nervous smile. "Are you trying to get me to meet your parents?"
"Dean, promise me." Cas's voice was wobbly. "Promise me you'll find me. I don't wanna be alone-" A sob caught in his throat. "Please." There was a desperate plea to his voice and it made Dean feel pain he could never have imagined.
"Ah, sure." Cas replied, but he was nervous. They weren't out together in public frequently and Cas wasn't sure of what anyone would say.
Dean grabbed Cas's hand and pulled him along beside him. "So what do you want to see?"
"I tried to clean up a bit but it's still a mess, sorry." Dean unlocked the front door, motioning for Cas to step inside.
"Shut up!" Cas said, crossing his arms.
"Hell yeah." Cas grinned.
"So your just going to sit here?"
"Hey Ellen." Dean smiled as they entered the diner.
"How can you?" Cas let out a strangled laugh. "When you know how ugly I am? How can you possibly have any interest in being with me let alone...love?"
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
"Cas, I'm sorry." Dean whispered, his arms tightening around Cas in comfort.
"I knew you would." Cas gently touched Dean's cheek. "Now let's get out of here.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
They walked over to the car and Dean pulled a beer out of the cooler. "Want one?" Cas grabbed the beer out of Dean's hands with a sly smile.
"You sure your going to be-"
Cas let out a yelp as Dean began sewing him up.
Dean's heart hammered and his brain ceased to function because of what Cas had said. Not she thought you loved me. She thought you loved me back.  That one word meant so damn much. He closed his eyes for the briefest of seconds and leaned his forehead against the steering wheel.
"Actually, not that bad." Cas said. "Little bit of a headache, but I'm mostly just tired."
"You know what really gets me? That your dad was locked up, I never told you because I didn't want to hurt you but damn it! How could he just break out? Him being away was supposed to keep you safe." Dean's voice dropped. "That's all I ever wanted, but....it didn't keep you safe, I'm sorry."
"Oops, sorry." She giggled.
Dean brushed Cas's hair out of his face and kissed him softly. "Well somebody else can be a hit with the ladies, I don't want any of them anymore."
"Mm, views much better from back here." Dean commented as he admired Cas's but in those tight jeans.
"Hey Dean, I'm sorry."
"Hi." Cas barely gave him a sidelong glance.
"Of course." Cas's mouth turned up into a smile and he pulled Dean close.
"No it's not." Dean croaked. "Ellen, I can't loose him, damn it!" He clung onto the older woman's sweater and held in his tears.
"Cas!"
"Naw,it's alright. I'll take the couch, its your house-"
"Jesus, do you ever clean out your backpack?"
"Me too, I love you." Cas whispered against Dean's warm, soft lips.
"Why do you care so much?" Cas asked quietly.
"I know she didn't kill herself, she wouldn't! I know it was Dad, he killed her and didn't want to get caught so he made it look like a suicide! Jesus...I wish I hadn't seen her like that..."
"Thanks Bobby."
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A no was on the tip of Cas's tongue. The images of his angry father and brother flashing through his mind but he still remembered how dejected he'd felt yesterday after school. "Yeah, sure." He could barely believe what was coming out of his own mouth.
Cas looked away, his cheeks flaming. "Oh God, you found....don't call me that."
"What else is new?" Cas asked with a playful smirk.
"So what about you?"
Cas let out a long sigh as Dean finished and cut the floss. "Great, one down and only a million to go."
"Because if it's the only way to get you out of here, you need to take it." Dean looked over at him. The intensity in Dean's eyes took Cas's breath away.
"No, I don't think so." Dean started pulling at Cas's belt.
"Dean-"
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------
"Shush you." Dean kissed the top of Cas's head and walked to the bathroom. "I'll be right back."
"I didn't Dean, I swear. I think he picked the lock or something. It was horrible Dean...the horror when I saw him...part of me hoped he'd just hurry up and kill me to get it over with-"
"I know Cas, but it's going to be okay." Dean pressed his lips against Cas's forehead. He let them linger there as his emotions swelled up inside him.
"What will you tell your parents? Are they like super over protective?"
He let his phone drop to the floor once the operator had said an ambulance was on it's way and took Cas's head in his lap, Cas's head rolling in a way that made Dean's stomach clench.
"Sorry, your the one who told me to go back to work."
"I agree," Dr. Wright's face turned somber. "It isn't fair Dean. It isn't fair to place this burden on you. It's not fair that a young person's life was cut short so soon. Working in this profession you begin to learn that nothing in life is fair."
"It's better than you being hurt too! Please Dean, you have no idea-"
"Damn it," Dean muttered. "This is all my fault."
-------------------------------
"Shh," Dean murmured, putting on a brave facade. He gently placed a hand on Cas's cheek. "It'll be alright."
"It's alright." Cas said with a fake smile. On the inside his stomach was sinking.
Dean pushed Cas over so he was lying on his stomach and kissed him on the lips. "Then don't," He murmured. "Don't ever let me go. I want you to stay with me forever."
The silence was deafening.
"You can just let me out here." Cas said as they drove by the same convenience store parking lot from last night.
Cas kissed the hollow of Dean's neck. "Me either." He whispered, feeling it in his bones. If there was a way to keep Dean safe, he'd want to be with him forever.
"May I hug you?"
"Nah, I'm good....thanks anyway." Dean gave him the only smile he could muster. He couldn't stand the thought of anyone else in his apartment with him, all he wanted was Cas.
Dean let out a snort of laughter. "Your pretty sure of yourself there buddy."
"I'm sorry." Cas whispered. "I know what's going to happen-your going to get hurt, maybe even die, and I'm too selfish to do the right thing! I just want to lie here with you forever, I don't want to let you go-"
Cas had butterflies in his stomach as he entered school the next day. He wanted, needed, to see Dean desperately, but a small part of him was afraid. Afraid that last night was just a mirage, a silly dream. He took a deep breath and it was at that moment he heard Dean's voice from behind him.
Cas knew there was a stupid grin on his face as he looked over at Dean. "Okay, well I don't want to use any of the other cliches either so I'll go with....Honestly, I don't have a good enough word." Cas said, laughing.
Dean shook his head with a small smile. "I keep forgetting your Mr. Goody Two Shoes." Dean turned to go.
"Dean is right sweetie, you need to be more careful." Ellen chided. "Life is precious, you need to respect that."
"Love you."
Cas grinned as he stroked Mary's hair lightly. "Yes we are."
Cas chuckled. "No Claire. I wanted to give you this." Cas dropped the locket into Claire's open hand.
"Morning." Ellen called, smiling at both of them. "Breakfast?"
They arrived at Cas's house within minutes. Cas gripped Dean's hand as they walked up the front walkway. Dean opened the door and placed a hand on the small of Cas's back as they stepped inside.
Cas must have fallen asleep, because the next time he opened his eyes it was dark out. "Hey, your awake." Dean said.
"Nice try." Cas chuckled and gave him a kiss on the cheek.
"Ultimately the decision is yours Dean. No one can tell you what choice to make, we can only advise you."
"Well there you go." Cas replied, placing his empty bowl in the sink. "There's the secret I spilled for the day."
"Cas, please. I can't stand to see you suffering like this." Dean's voice was choked with emotion. He stood up, it was all too much. He just couldn't.
Dean shoved his hands into his pockets and looked at the floor. "So...last night."
murmured
"You!" Dean pulled on the bar but Cas wouldn't let go. "I love Twix bars!"
They heard a door open and broke apart quickly, Cas's cheeks flaming. "John? You in here?"
"Honestly, a little. I keep thinking I'm going to have to go home and deal with his wrath...but then it kicks in that I won't have to deal with him again and...it's nice." Cas gave Dean a cute, lopsided grin.
He did go back to his apartment though, he had to. He hurried through the door, lowering his head so he didn't see something that would cause him to completely come undone. He unplugged his cassette player and hurried back out, not even bothering to lock the door behind him. He drove around aimlessly for the rest of the night, just waiting for the sun to rise.
"Good quick thinking though." Dean smirked as he cut a strip of wrapping paper.
"You are a mean and cruel person." Cas accused, swatting at him. Dean leaned down to kiss him but Cas playfully pushed him away. "Nuh uh, I'm mad at you."
"Glad you do." Cas blushed slightly and lay his head on Dean's chest. Dean ran his hand through Cas's hair lazily as the sun began to set. "Damn," Cas muttered. "I didn't want today to end."
"Who else is taking up all your spare time?"
Okay so this didn't go exactly the way I wanted it to. I had major writers block and then got busy with work. But I promised an epilogue so here it is, hope you like it.
Cas touched the cool metal in his palm before looking at Claire's sleeping form. He quietly strode over and sat on the edge of the bed.
Dean grabbed his arm and pulled Cas back. "You can take the bus if you want, but I'm taking my car."
"Sore, but better, thanks."
Cas moved to lie on his side and faced Dean with a shy smile. "I love you too Dean." He gently reached up and placed a kiss on Dean's neck. Dean smiled and Cas smiled back at him shyly. He knew nothing would ever compare to the feeling of Dean holding him. Dean traced the scars and bruises on Cas's chest and watched as his breath caught at the sensation. Cas snatched Dean's hand and kissed the palm before quickly letting go, embarrassed again.
"Do you even know how to use a stove?" Cas quipped as he slid in the passenger seat.
"Oh." Cas felt a blush creep over his face at his mistake but Dean just laughed.
Dean pretended to sigh and sat up. "Your no fun."
"About a month."
Dean let out a long sigh and looked to the ceiling as if the answer were there. "I don't know." He admitted finally. "I was never good with the whole.....lets talk about our emotions thing. It scares me that-to get that close. I'm supposed to have this normal, apple pie life and-"
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"So.....Dean wasn't kissing someone else, he was kissing you?"
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
"Backpack." Dean gave Cas a questioning look. "I clean out my messenger bag as much as you clean out your backpack." Cas said with a knowing smile. "You never know what you'll find."
Cas breathed a small sigh of content at Dean's presence and let his eyes drift close. "It hurts."
Cas nodded his head with a tight smile and went back to reading diligently and taking notes.
"I know I am." Dean grinned.
Cas rolled his eyes. "That helps so much."
----------------------------------------------------------------
"Castiel?" A nurse poked her head around the door.
"Cas," Dean studied him and placed a hand on his cheek. "No, I'm not letting you leave. You wanted college, remember?"
Ellen appeared and looked overjoyed to see Cas. "Cas!" She cried in relief. "Oh sweetie, I'm so glad your okay. Dean told me what happened."
"You sure your going to be okay?"
"Shut up." Cas snatched the books from Dean. He shoved it all in his locker and glared over at his boyfriend. Dean grinned at him innocently and took his hand as they walked down the hallway.
"Why?" Dean asked with a hint of a laugh.
"Hmm." Cas sighed happily and poured the detergent into the washing machine.
Cas grinned victoriously. "Fine, but be prepared to loose."
"Yes! On second thought, the food can't wait." Cas leaned over and snagged a sandwich from the basket. "Pie too?" He asked with a laugh.
It turned out God didn't have a heart. Or maybe he didn't care or more likely, didn't exist.
-----------------------------------------------------------
"Okay, it's not really that big of a surprise." Dean murmured as he kissed Cas's shoulder. "But I made us a picnic. I thought it would be nice ya know-"
"She was so brave. Didn't cry or anything, and I imagine it hurt a million times worse than this.....God, I miss her."
