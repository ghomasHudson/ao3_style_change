He didn’t reply right away, enjoying this calm moment before what would inevitably be a stressful situation for them both.
“There’s so much I want to say, Cas. I want to yell at you for being so self-sacrificing. I want to make sure you’re okay. I want to lecture you about being so reckless.”
Cas’ grip on his hand tightened,
“That is, if you’ll let me.”
“He told me he loved me.” Said Dean forcing himself to ignore the break of his voice when he said the word love. A fresh round of tears moved silently down his face, collecting on his chin, his breath shaky as he tried to reel in his composure. He heard Sam’s quiet but sharp inhale and the hand on his shoulder squeezed as a comforting gesture, “And that’s when The Empty came? That’s when it took him back?” asked Sam. Dean opened his mouth the reply but all that came out was a laugh that sounded too much like a sob to his ears,
They laughed quietly at each other, both saying the others' names at the same time. Dean was the first to speak again,
“No, Dean, you misunderstand me.” Cas pleaded, “you’ve never been that person!”
“I know how you see yourself, Dean. You see yourself the same way our enemies see you. You're destructive and you're angry and you're broken. You're... you're 'Daddy's Blunt Instrument.' And you think hate and anger, that's... that's what drives you. That's who you are. It's not. And everyone who knows you sees it. Everything you have ever done, the good and the bad, you have done for love. You raised your little brother for love. You fought for this whole world for love. That is who you are. You're the most caring man on Earth. You are the most selfless, loving human being I will ever know. You know, ever since we met and ever since I pulled you out of Hell, knowing you has changed me. Because you care, I care. I care about you. I care about Sam. I care about Jack. I care about the whole world because of you. You changed me, Dean.”
Castiel nodded, biting his tongue. It was the truth, but he was tempted to to reply with anything from turning eighteen next week to just turning twenty last week. Gabriel should be proud of him.
‘He’s been like that all morning,’ Balthazar explained. ‘He’ll…probably be back later. And even more unpleasant.’ He gave Sam a sympathetic pat on the shoulder. ‘Good luck.’
‘Did he give you herpes or something? Did
Crowley looked up with a raised brow. ‘As I understand it, you had no business being in the archives. Or the vault. May as well use your curiosity to my advantage.’
‘Something wrong?’ Benny asked.
‘It can make pearls over time,’ Dean replied.
Castiel was leaning against the railing, staring out at the lagoon. He sighed and shifted his stare to the bottle of beer he held. He hadn’t taken a sip yet. He didn’t want to run the risk of forgetting his revelation. ‘Says the man that just lost all of his clothes.’
‘Samandriel
Castiel looked away as he summoned his clothing. He left the room and headed downstairs. He reached the kitchen and looked around in confusion. Sam and Gabriel sat at the table, eating cereal, Bobby was reading the newspaper, and Karen was humming as she placed fresh flowers in a vase. Balthazar and Anna were nowhere to be seen. He cast his senses out, but felt no trace of them. He looked to Gabriel for answers.
‘Because Gabriel wouldn’t have reacted like he did if you were a complete asshole,’ Dean explained. He laughed at Castiel’s lost look. ‘Really? Are you that clueless? He’s worried about you!’
Castiel stepped forward and inhaled sharply when Dean gently took his hand. He glanced down and raised his eyes in confusion. ‘I don’t understand.’
Castiel flinched away from the touch. ‘L-Lucifer!’
. I just… Sorry.’
Castiel walked beside Dean as they headed along the pathway. Dean would stumble once in a while, but quickly regained his footing. Not once did Dean drop the scuba gear, for which Castiel was grateful. They slowed down again as Dean looked out towards the lagoon and along the coastline. When his eyes landed on a large palm tree, he picked up the pace again.
One Year Later
. He didn’t leave just for it all to follow him. He wasn’t stupid. He wasn’t fragile.
‘It’s none of your business, Sammy!’ Dean said.
‘He is a descendent of the Witch. Dean and Sam Winchester are the last ones. The last ones that can turn us into slaves,’ Lucifer said softly.
He floated beneath the wooden terrace and listened carefully.
Sam regarded Gabriel for a moment. 'You slipped in the bathroom and drowned in the toilet. The end,' he said as he continued on his way.
‘If it makes you feel any better, I thought that Dean was pulling a hoax,’ Castiel said. ‘I was very impolite about the matter. I’ve only known for a day.’ He sighed in relief as the door opened.
The front door opened and Sam and Gabriel entered the house. Gabriel bounded into the room, grinning ear to ear. ‘Watcha watchin’?’
Castiel’s shoulders slumped. That was not how he wanted to be immortalized.
Castiel nodded and pulled the necklace over his head. ‘What are they from?’ he asked.
Sam stroked Gabriel’s cheek and gave the angel a small smile. ‘Dean’s the same way with me. Even though I can take care of myself just fine, he’ll still play the part of the over-protective big brother.’
. I know Sam's going through hell right now dealing with that guy.'
Sam stiffened and quickly looked down. ‘She’s…there was a shark,’ he said quietly. ‘Wasn’t there when it happened.’
‘Are you still okay with kissing me?’ Dean asked quietly. He was answered by a soft kiss and a tongue lightly massaging his lips. He whined at the loss of warmth. ‘So that’s a yes,’ he said in relief. At least he’d ba able to carry out a proper mating ritual later—once Castiel lost interest in mapping out his body in a decidedly not fun way. He blinked in confusion when he noticed that Castiel was staring at his crotch.
Dean shook as he watched his torturer back away. It wasn’t fair. Why was
Castiel didn’t answer right away. The photograph, the entire reason he had allowed himself to be wrangled into the trip, came to the forefront of his mind. ‘I’m here because of my brother,’ he said. ‘But, yes. I know there’s no…sea…
Sam nodded in agreement. ‘Alright…’
give you a chance.’
Dean watched as Castiel’s eyes landed on him and Anna. As Castiel’s wings spread out more, Dean stepped closer to Anna. He quietly reached out to Castiel’s Grace and was answered with regret over Uriel’s actions and threats.
‘I understand,’ Castiel said emphatically. ‘I prefer to be in the water myself.’
He dropped his arm and swayed uncertainly. There was a soft splashing coming from beneath him, and he looked down. At first, there was nothing, then a flash of color appeared under the surface, followed by a splash behind him. He frowned as he leaned over more. He could just make out something beneath the pier. If he could just get a little closer… He squawked loudly as he lost his balance and fell into the water.
Balthazar rolled his eyes and leaned against the door frame. ‘What about him. I already know he’s shooting his scenes alone.’
Gabriel finished wrapping his hands and turned back towards Sam. ‘Is it… Is it because I believe in unicorns?’ he asked anxiously. He hadn’t been exactly discreet about his belief on any show he’d ever been on. Normally, he could laugh it off and justify his belief as goats with one horn. It usually threw people off when he was completely honest. Charlie was probably the only person that thought it was possible. Then again,
‘And that’s all?’ Castiel said, letting the suspicion seep through his voice. ‘Forgive me if I don’t believe you.’
'Dean?' Castiel frowned at Dean's silence. He reached out to touch Dean.
that,’ Dean bit out.
Charlie stared blankly for a moment. ‘Oh! No, uh… I still…swim on occasion. My girlfriend, Gilda…she has a cabin by a lake.’
Castiel blinked in confusion as the cuff’s link tugged on him. As he rolled over, little tingles ran up his arm and into the pit of his stomach. He moaned lowly as he propped himself up. ‘D-Dean?’
Crowley nodded. ‘Of course.’ He knew there had to be a catch to her sudden change in opinion. ‘Unfortunately, I won’t be staying that long. And neither with Gabriel and Castiel.’
‘And it’s perfect for
Dean pulled Castiel close and stoked his hair. ‘You’re not broken,’ he said as his kissed the top of Castiel’s head. ‘You’re just…’
Dean looked at Gabriel doubtfully. 'Right.'
Dean slowly turned to face Gabriel with a smirk. 'Do you
Anna gave Castiel and Gabriel one last look before leaving the room. She paused at the doorway. ‘The entire block is clean. Let us know when you believe he’s ready to move, and we’ll clear the way.’ At Castiel’s nod, she left, closing the door behind her.
Castiel laughed as he stood up. ‘How about a movie, then? The kitchen’s pretty well-stocked, so… We’ll have that coffee then some popcorn.’
, but… Look, I won’t say I’m not easy, because I am.’
Dean hugged Castiel and softly stroked his wings. ‘It’s okay,’ he said soothingly. ‘Everything’s fixed now.’
Dean moved his hand and brushed his fingers over Castiel’s cheek. He winced as sharp stings traveled up his arm. He stared at his bandaged hand. He sighed in disappointment. His bandages could use a change. If his hand looked like a mangled mess, he could only assume what the rest of him looked like.
‘Dive bar?’ Sam asked.
Sam winced as Gabriel fell down the short flight of steps. Before he could ask if Gabriel was okay, the door was slammed shut.
‘No. It’s awful,’ Castiel replied. He laughed as Dean stiffened in his arms in alarm.
Dean faltered and looked to Castiel in uncertainty. He didn’t know what to make of Crowley, and Castiel was in no state to give him a second opinion. ‘What are you planning on doing?’ he asked.
There was a loud squeak, followed by a splash as Sam slipped and Gabriel tumbled on top of him.
‘Mom was hired on as a receptionist at first,’ Gabriel said fondly. ‘But she sucked at answering the phone, so they moved her to secretary. She was better at it, but she…shed. That’s when Dad showed up to have a word with the new angel that couldn’t keep her feathers out of his paperwork.’ He finished with a small grin.
'Amma dax ol teloch’ translates straight to ‘cursed loins of death.’ I just strung together some words from the Enochian dictionary. I guess you could say it translates to ‘Death’s disease-ridden cock.’
‘Don’t trust him!’ Gabriel warned Dean. ‘He’ll kidnap us and steal your kidneys!’
‘But it’s all I could focus on!’ Castiel argued. ‘I had to understand you before I could process...
‘We’re bound together, however frail the connection may be…so, of course you have an influence on it.’
come from?!’
And now the angels were threatening to throw Dean back in Hell. He wanted to scream in frustration. What was going on up there? Who was giving the orders? Why was Anna so set on thinking she deserved to be punished for disobeying? Yes, Lucifer disobeyed, but he also started a riot. He had gathered a small army of angels to eradicate their Father's newest creations. A full on rebellion leading to such heavy casualties that it apparently tipped Heaven’s systems and hierarchy on its head. It went a little further than abandoning a post.
wing. His head turned quickly as Dean sat up with a soft moan.
‘Not without a piña colada, at least!’ Charlie said from behind the pair. She grinned at Sam’s relieved expression.
‘Sam’s…brother. Brother? You’re Sam’s
Gabriel stuck out his hand. ‘Hand it over,’ he said. He dropped his suitcase and reached for Balthazar’s bag when the other made no move to retrieve the sex tape. ‘Give it here, or you’re fired!’
The floor beneath him creaked ominously. He tried not to breathe as he slowly got to his hands and knees. When nothing happened, he started to crawl forward. It was then that the floor gave way.
Castiel’s stomach clenched, and he grabbed at the silver cuff on his wrist. It was still there, but it brought him little comfort. His eyes flicked up, and he saw Dean’s head buried in his hands. ‘Dean…?’
They had started with beer. Then Dean suggested doing shots of schnapps. Castiel loved it. The schnapps Dean had given him tasted just like butterscotch and peppermint candies. The bottle was almost gone, and the world was a brighter, happier place. No death, no despair, no needing fantasy worlds where nothing could hurt him. Castiel giggled at the screen as Ash laughed maniacally.
He glanced at Gabriel and Castiel, who each had a wing tucked against the other. ‘But, had it been prolonged, she might still be alive.’
‘I dunno,’ Gabriel replied. ‘I just think you need to account for our power. Too much power running through the spell…’
‘Fine, so you don’t leave. You stay. What if someone finds out that you’re not exactly bound to me? What then? I don’t know if some other Hunter will try his luck, or if I’ll be forced to release you,’ Dean explained as he took Castiel’s hands in his. ‘I didn’t tell Sam—he just thinks I said something stupid in the cave, but I know I won’t be able to keep this from him for much longer. Same with Bobby. He’ll pick up on something being wrong.’
Sam stared at Dean in silence. Dean finally looked up, and Sam looked away. ‘Uh…I guess I can set you up with some uh…videos?’
Dean pulled back and gave Castiel a furious look. He extended his wings as far as he could, displaying every flaw for Castiel to see. He grabbed the lapels of Castiel's coat and brought him closer. 'Yeah, I wasn't exactly welcomed with open arms.'
Castiel shook his head. ‘I don’t know what you’re talking about,’ he wailed.
‘Castiel?’
‘Being my mate,’ Dean explained. He frowned uncertainly as he leaned back. ‘Or uh… Well…it doesn’t have to last forever,’ he said quietly, remembering that human relationships didn’t always last as long. ‘Just…until you don’t like me anymore.’
‘I’d suggest a threesome.’
Dean frowned. 'Hey, I admit I'm jealous as hell,' and he was, 'but I'm not mad at you, Sammy. I'm proud of my baby brother!' He ruffled Sam's hair and grinned at the undignified expression Sam gave him.
Charlie and Samandriel glanced at Gabriel before having their attention drawn back to the screen by a loud moan. They whined pathetically when Gabriel slammed the laptop shut and the monitor’s screen went black.
need to talk about it. If I’m gonna be on Gabriel’s show, and we’re gonna be together, then we… We need to figure this all out. Preferably
.-.-.-.-.
It didn't stop there. Castiel kept making slightly sexual comments, but it seemed like he didn't quite understand just what he was saying. It was driving Dean insane.
‘I’m sure you’ll find something,’ Sam said. Gabriel grinned up at him, and he leaned down to kiss the shorter man.
‘They’re texting Crowley,’ Castiel replied. He shook his head slightly at the alarmed expression Gabriel gave him. ‘Nothing incriminating. I think they’re messing with him a little bit. Something about seahorses last time I checked,’ he said dismissively.
Castiel unmuted his phone and schooled his features. ‘It’s a deal, but I think you should be aware of the fact that you have some competition,’ he said lightly.
Castiel let himself fall back against the pillows with a soft moan. He didn’t know if he was enjoying being manhandled or not. He was already hard from Dean’s light touches, fingers slowly running the length of his cock and around his balls, following his taint to his anus. He let out a pitiful moan as Dean coaxed his legs further and further apart. Obligingly, he brought his knees up and spread his thighs for Dean to get a better look, hoping the action would spur Dean into doing something more interesting.
Sam blushed at the tone in Gabriel's voice.
'My cum,' Castiel replied with a straight face.
‘Gabriel has the same problem, although…he does not have the excuse of being drunk,’ Castiel replied as he glanced down at the agent in question.
Sam stood straighter. 'Oh. Was it Castiel?'
Gabriel bit his lip as the thought of his photo collection popped in his mind. He was really regretting his plan for getting Castiel laid. He had never thought it would have backfired like this. He sunk to the floor as Sam came a little closer. ‘Stay
'What? Wait, are you
Bobby shoved the journal back into the desk drawer and slammed it shut. ‘You wanna read somethin’, you ask first,’ he said as he crossed his arms.
‘All right,’ Dean relented. ‘Get on your back and show me your best peacock impression.’
‘I’d love that,’ Dean said quietly. He pouted as Castiel pulled away, holding up a finger and smiling.
! It’s—oh! Do that again…’
‘Er, not that I’m aware,’ Castiel replied.
Castiel shook his head. ‘Not tonight,’ he replied. ‘It’s nice and cool down here… I thought I’d get a little sleep down here.’
?! But…how did he…?’
‘Hotel… He said “house.” Is there a house around here?’
do I have to be naked?’ he asked.
Balthazar nodded slowly. ‘That’s why I dropped his ass. Not for running off on research projects.
!’ Castiel replied between laughs.
Lucifer frowned as he glanced around the room. So, he had apparently failed. His gaze caught on Castiel’s white wings. ‘They’re white.’
Dean chuckled and kissed the back of Castiel’s neck. ‘Stuff. Stuff you probably don’t wanna know about,’ he said. Benny had watched him make the ointment and had been thoroughly disgusted by the pile of ingredients that Dean had collected, so he decided it was probably best not to even try to describe it to Castiel.
‘Uh-huh. Everything’s all clear on this end,’ Balthazar said. ‘Right…see you soon.’
‘Me, too,’ Dean said.
it?!’
‘Shut up, Crowley!’
‘Yes.’
Anna met Karen’s eyes and quickly looked away. ‘Yes. But it was worth it. I needed to hide. And hiding among humans is a lot easier if you
‘What good is
‘My roots… Every time I look in the mirror, I get older and older. New wrinkles…grey hair… Gabriel’s
sorry!’
He hoped he was making the right decision. If everything went well, then he and Gabriel could help ease Castiel into the knowledge that Dean was a merman. He highly doubted that a marine biologist would be as accepting as a cryptozoologist TV host.
Castiel shrugged and laid his head on Dean’s shoulder. ‘I’m exhausted,’ he explained. ‘And confused. I need a plan. I don’t like not having direction. And this stupid show doesn’t count.’
Dean grinned at Sam. ‘Such a long list, isn’t it? All the ones I could have saved, but didn’t bother with. How many hunts did we go on where there could have been no casualties? If I had just said one word?’
‘He can’t control it! He thinks he can, but he can’t!’ Gabriel tried to stop the confession, but it was too late. Everything came tumbling out, and he was helpless to stop it. ‘The Hunter in the forest wasn’t the only accident. There were others. Not human, but they weren’t supposed to die! Dad doesn’t just employ humans and angels. He’s got demons and vampires and werewolves, and, and everything! If one of them got too close to Castiel and made him uncomfortable, he’d smite them! He was cornered by three monsters once, teasing him about his wings, and he smote them all. That wendigo was probably the only one he
‘I’ll buy you some popsicle sticks and glue. We’ll put it on the fridge,’ Castiel said dryly. ‘Better yet, I’ll just take you to a rave. Get you some glow sticks. Maybe I’ll even get you some body glitter…’
‘I wouldn’t pull you away from your schedule,’ Castiel said. ‘Just take me along when you go fishing. That’s all I’m asking. I’ll stay out of your way.’
‘Why are you studying history? Are you gonna at least add in some archaeology? Maybe get a whip?’ Dean asked with a grin as he drove. ‘I think you’d look good in a leather jacket and fedora.’
‘Is something wrong?’ Castiel asked as he came up beside Dean. In his arms, he held a medium-sized box.
‘Oh! No, um, the hole’s already there,’ Castiel replied as he knelt by the side of pool. He turned his head, giving Dean a good look at his earlobe. He pulled the earring out and replaced it. ‘See? I had them pierced a long time ago, and now they’re just…holes. It doesn’t hurt at all. Well, it’ll hurt if I wear the wrong type of metal, but that’s if I don’t take them out after a few hours,’ he explained.
Karen nodded and stepped forward. She leaned down and stabbed Uriel in the chest. She looked up at Anna in curiosity. ‘For a moment, it sounded like you actually cared about Castiel.’
up with a blowjob!’
‘And your brother didn’t have anything that would work?’ Benny asked as Dean handed him the scales. He was surprised at how tough the scales actually were, and he had a little trouble making the holes.
Charlie winced. ‘There’s an app that warns you within fifteen minutes,’ she said. ‘People think I’m crazy with all my rain gear… So, uh…how did he take it? What did he say?’
there’s a slip up,’ he said.
They entered the bungalow, and Gabriel made a beeline for the couch. He let himself fall onto it without looking and winced as something dug into his back. Leaning forward, he reached behind and grabbed what he first assumed was a simple leather jacket. When he held it in front of himself, he had to blink several times at all the sequins that sparkled at him. ‘Wow, Jody. Didn’t think you went in for this kinda stuff.’
Sam nodded in understanding. ‘Karen and Bobby know… They almost turned you guys down because of me,’ he said quietly.
‘What is…?’ Gabriel looked up to see his brother’s drunken face plastered across a computer screen. His mouth dropped open in shock.
Karen smiled at him and handed him a plate. ‘Thank you!’
Castiel paused as he was sneaking a hand up Dean’s thigh and under the shorts. He glanced up with a confused expression. ‘I’m sorry. Which kind?’ he asked as he sat up.
Bobby sighed as he picked up the cufflink and examined it. He looked up sharply at Dean. ‘Where did you get this?!’ he demanded.
. Unless…’ Castiel bit his lip. ‘Is this an open relationship?’
‘For now?’ Castiel looked over his shoulder at the older angel. ‘What are you planning to do with them?’
‘You needn’t worry about them,’ Lucifer said as he stood behind Castiel. ‘None of them will be harmed. For now, at least.’
Sam coughed, and Castiel rolled his eyes as he stood straight.
Dean stared at his knees. It was strange not having any markings. He took one of the shirts that Benny had given him and examined it. It was a plain, black t-shirt. He held it out and could see where his head and arms were supposed to go. ‘Right… Tag in the back,’ he muttered. He figured he would worry about putting his head though the top hole, then figure his arms out after. He scrunched up the fabric, careful to keep the tag on the right side. He put the shirt over his head then pushed one arm through an armhole, then the other. He pulled the bottom down, covering his stomach and frowned.
‘They’re just eggs, Cas. No need to be mad at them,’ he said lightly as he sat next to Castiel.
‘He still thinks there’s something there,’ Gabriel explained, waving his hand around. ‘He thinks he can salvage it.’
He smiled widely as he sent the message. He didn’t actually need a photograph, but he wanted to see just who he was working with. He had a virtual crush on the artist and desperately wanted a face to associate with the man. He had fantasized that A. Milligan was a grizzled, older man with no time for nonsense. Perhaps he drank cognac in front of a roaring fire as he read about the adventures of Alan Quartermaine.
‘You may need to search him,’ Castiel suggested as Sam picked Gabriel up. ‘Thoroughly.’
‘It’s her job. She’s being
Castiel gave Sam a bewildered look, and Sam took pity on him. ‘Dean gets a little…off when he’s drunk or drugged. He’s confusing reality with porn.’
you afraid of me?’ Castiel hesitantly asked, staring at their hands.
Dean sagged and took a calming breath before facing Gabriel. ‘What do you want?’
my competition?,’ Balthazar replied with a laugh. ‘Wait… He’s with you right now. Isn’t he?’
Sam glared at Gabriel, breathing heavily. ‘What the fuck is going on?’ he ground out.
get to look like a supermodel in drag, and
Castiel smiled and rubbed his arm. ‘He’s fine. I’d be more worried about Sam.’
‘Yes… Your father is quite clever in that regard,’ he admitted. ‘How about you tell me where I might find you?’
?’ she asked Castiel.
‘I have Sam waiting in his bathtub.’
Castiel smiled in amusement. He went back to the table and sat back down. He picked up the compact mirror and popped open his eye shadow. As he began applying the makeup, he heard a splash and looked over to seen Dean sitting on the edge of the pool, craning his neck to get a better look. He looked back at the compact mirror then to Dean and smiled. ‘Do you wanna hold this for me?’
Dean was bloodied and bruised and huddled against a stalagmite, trying to control his breathing. He had no idea where Castiel was. The cave ended up being a lot deeper than Dean was expecting. There were smaller tunnels that branched off and led to who knows where.
Castiel shook his head. ‘I think…I think they’ll finally believe that Gabriel and I are actually related,’ he admitted. He moved so that his back rested against Dean’s chest, and he closed his eyes. He was completely exhausted, but he was too wired to let himself relax.
Gabriel’s mouth snapped shut, and he laughed nervously, blushing. ‘No, of course not. Why would we have anything like that?!’
'No idea,' Gabriel admitted. 'Go. Do your thing. I did my part, now go do yours,' he said as he gave Sam a little push, letting his fingers linger. 'Put those big, strong arms to good use,' he said, giving Sam smirk.
Castiel looked over his shoulder at Dean. He stepped aside, revealing the dying wendigo.
Balthazar looked from the boat to Castiel and back. He had never seen Castiel blush so brightly for any reason. He narrowed his eyes at the boat. Now that he thought about it, it did look a little familiar. ‘Castiel, what did you do after you ditched me?’ he quietly asked.
gonna do?’ Sam asked doubtfully.
Balthazar looked down the hall. ‘He was right here… Cas! Cassie!’
‘You’re afraid of me! You’re scared of what I can do.’
‘I did not “flip out,”’ Crowley growled, flashing red eyes at Gabriel.
Benny sighed as he motioned at Dean. ‘You asked what I caught in my net,’ he said. ‘Well, you’re looking at him.’
‘D-Dean…’ Dean leaned away as much as he could as Castiel crawled onto his stomach and propped himself onto his elbows.
Gabriel opened an eye to find the ghost inches from his face. 'Shit!' He jumped away and into Sam's arms.
‘I did not—’
He grunted as a heavy mass of orange and white landed on his lap. ‘I wish things were more complicated,’ he said quietly.
hand. He reached out and grasped Dean's hand. 'My name is Castiel,' he replied. He frowned when he tried to pull his hand back, but found it tightly held in place. Was he doing it wrong?
Four hundred thirty-eight years ago, Seraphiel gave up on getting his Father's attention. Dean remembered the day well. 'So, uh... Don't need to worry about him, right?'
about you two.’
‘So…are you assigned to me?’ Sam asked.
‘I just…I need to know, Cas,’ Dean said and lightly squeezed Castiel’s arm. ‘I need to know if Sam’s gonna be safe around you.’
Castiel barged into the bungalow, slamming the door behind him. ‘Crowley!’
Dean backed up. ‘I’ll leave you two to it…,’ he said before darting away.
‘And humans aren’t?’ Crowley countered. ‘We were born from your race. Humans are just as capable of evil as demons. More so, I should think. Your lot knows better.’
‘I just don’t understand your coloration,’ Castiel mumbled as he compared Dean’s fins to Charlie’s.
‘Mm! Something smells absolutely wonderful!’ Balthazar exclaimed.
Castiel held the mirror away and pulled it back in, checking from every angle. Everything looked okay. Except for the small bit of white in his hair. He brushed his fingers through to dislodge it, but it didn’t go away. He frowned and tried again. Still nothing. He pulled the mirror in close, tilting his head to check the hair by his temple. He froze as he realized that the small bit of white wasn’t a stray cat hair.
‘Just like a pangolin,’ Castiel said with a wide smile.
‘Playing Solitaire, I’m sure,’ Dean replied as he settled into the chair across from Bobby. He reached into his pocket and pulled out the silver cufflink. He gave it a quick glance before tossing it across the desk. ‘I need to find out where this came from.’
Gabriel slowly followed the brothers from the Impala to the house he was going to be subjected to living in. Sam had ordered him to stay close, and he would stop every few steps, trying to test how far he could be from Sam before the clenching turned to pain. They reached the house before he could get any real answer. It didn't help that Sam kept urging him on every time he stopped. Sam and Dean waited patiently for him before opening the door and entering.
Sam laughed and made his way behind the main desk. He bent down and pulled out the small first aid kit. ‘What do you need?’
‘This is about grey hair?’ Dean asked uncertainly. ‘What’s wrong with that?’
‘Think you can manage dressing on your own?’ Benny asked.
‘That’s all?’
Gabriel clapped Castiel on the back, laughing. ‘Oh, hell no! The producers
,’ Anna said as she looked over Balthazar, the disbelief in her voice obvious. ‘V-neck suits you.’
Sam shook his head as he stood away. ‘It’s weird.’
Castiel was numb with shock and horror as Dean fell forward onto the bed. Movement caught his eye, and he focused on Lucifer, standing on the other side of the room. In Lucifer’s hand was the Colt.
‘Go on. I think I’m gonna go out anyway,’ Dean said, waving his hand over his shoulder.
His plan hadn’t gone great, but at least it didn’t end in disaster. And it was worth it to have Gabriel’s arms wrapped around him again.
Gabriel opened his mouth then shut it. He tried again, but still came up empty for a reply. He leaned back, squinting slightly at Sam. He couldn’t decide whether he was being teased or hit on, and he couldn’t bring himself to really care.
Castiel turned to Balthazar and gave him a weary stare. ‘I just want to be left alone. Can you
was the one that got off on being in front of a camera. He had made his entire living off of chasing imaginary monsters and having guest spots on documentaries. He was the crazy kook that related theories and witness stories. But, the audience loved him. Especially the female audience. It was no wonder he managed to snag his own show.
'Whatever. Keep watching. This is where you try to throw me into the pond,' Gabriel said gleefully.
‘Warned? You were…
Dean watched as Castiel quickly left the room. The angel’s wings were just so black. Much of his research overlapped, and none of it mentioned angels having black wings. He yawned as he looked back at the screen. Freaky black wings. In his exhaustion, Dean’s mind made connections it had never made before.
‘What? Really?! KC and the Sunshine Band? Everyone’s heard at least
Castiel let out a long breath. ‘Where is it, now?’
‘Ring?’
.-.-.-.-.
‘It’s part of his outfit,’ Dean replied as he offered Castiel more soda.
Dean sat up and crossed his arms. He tried to control his fins. Benny wasn’t challenging him. He was just looking out for him. ‘I don’t think he’d do that,’ he said quietly.
Gabriel shook his finger. ‘Stop that! I know how your mind works.’ He grabbed Castiel by the shoulders and forced him into a chair sitting next to the hospital bed. ‘Now! You be a good little angel and keep an eye on him. If you try to leave, I’ll knock you out and tie you to this chair.’
'Figure of speech, Castiel!' Gabriel snapped. He didn't know what to do about his brother. His sweet, innocent, naïve, sheltered baby brother. His brother who could deliver off the wall lines with a strange, practiced ease. Gabriel knew for certain that Castiel hadn't learned any of it from him. And their father was careful about who they interacted with—especially Castiel. So where... And then he finally realized who corrupted his baby brother.
Castiel leaned down and lightly kissed Dean’s lips. He pulled back as Dean let out a happy whistle, and he looked away as tears pricked his eyes. He was aware of Dean worriedly saying his name, and he swallowed and took a deep breath before looking down.
After a short hike, they found themselves standing at the entrance of a partially hidden cave. Dean readied his flare gun and stepped forward.
Castiel blushed as his breath hitched. ‘O-oh. We’re… You want to…?’
Gabriel gave a shy smile. 'Er... I specialize?'
A hand touched his shoulder, and he stiffened and shrank away from the contact. ‘Don’t touch me!’ he screamed. He ran his eyes over Sam’s torso. There was no evidence of the scales he had seen. Had he been hallucinating? He sighed and laid his forehead against the thing that was supporting him. It felt weird for a life preserver. He opened his eyes to take a look. It was yellow and blue. And scaly. ‘Oh, God!’
Castiel watched from his spot on the bed as Dean worked on a new binding cuff.  Dean was bent over his desk, a plain piece of silver in one hand, a stylus in the other.
Castiel nodded and forced his arms to his sides. He looked around the salvage yard and internally groaned. Everyone was outside with their eyes glued to him. Dean and Gabriel offered him encouraging smiles. ‘Uh…must everyone be out here?’ he asked quietly.
look. These things look fuckin’ weird! That spiky one? I thought it was a flower at first! And I can’t avoid them ‘cuz they’re replies to my emails! Even if I have images disabled, I have to look. You just can’t
don’t?!’
Sam let out a small laugh. ‘Yeah… You two look good together.’
‘If we’re not talking or if I’m not…keeping him distracted, he just…stares at the wall,’ Dean explained. ‘He never did that before…before I told him. And yesterday was so eventful that there wasn’t any down time.’
‘Everything, apparently!’ Castiel turned and almost started walking onto the pier, but stopped himself as he realized he would be trapped. He needed to get away. He needed to hide. In the distance he could hear his name being shouted. He turned around to shout back at Balthazar. ‘Just fuck…’ He quickly trailed off when he noticed that Balthazar wasn’t even looking at him, and his name was still being shouted. He looked to where Balthazar was staring and froze.
Gabriel frowned at Castiel. ‘But I have proof.’
Dean frowned at Castiel’s back and tugged at Castiel’s jacket. ‘I give up,’ he said. ‘How the fuck do I get this off you?’
'—started witch hunts where there weren't any witches, started the Spanish Inquisition...several holy wars... Seraphiel the Manipulator. He let humans kill each other off, introduced them to demons... Oh!'
‘You don’t think he’s gonna reveal you to the rest of the world? Use you as his next science project?’ Sam asked.
'It feels like you.'
Gabriel swallowed and nodded to himself. ‘Okay… I… Fuck. Can you not say anything to him? A-at least until
‘I am so,
He surfaced beneath the bungalow and felt his fins stretch into an aggressive pose when he heard Balthazar’s voice. He shook his head as he neared the edge of the deck. He really had it bad. He had never raised his fins for a fight. Never felt the need. He knew his place. But his place among humanity was different. He wasn’t the bottom of the barrel. He wasn’t just a fling to pass the time.
‘He’s right,’ Sam said with a sigh. ‘It
Bobby stared at Dean. ‘I could go get it,’ he offered.
‘Why? It’s only a dream.’
?’ Sam let out a shocked laugh. ‘Oh, my God…’
Dean opened his eyes in confusion. He had felt a warm pulse on his forehead, but nothing more. He stared up at Castiel, and a smile formed on his lips. ‘Hey.’
Gabriel shook his head. ‘Cas says he’s only been in a bar fight about two times, but that’s
‘You like ’em
‘No!’ Dean ground out through his teeth. He looked up at Alastair. ‘Do your worst,’ he said and spat at Alastair’s face.
‘Not if you stop lying,’ Dean replied. ‘And start obeying.’
‘So…that’s what was up with Gabriel at the beginning.’
.-.-.-.-.
‘Well, it did take me a few days to learn a decent recipe,’ Sam said as he set a tray of drinks on the table. He glanced at Castiel and gave him an uncertain smile. He sighed in relief when he received and uneasy smile in return.
'Dad's not here to “disapprove,”' Gabriel said as he shoveled what looked to be mostly syrup into his mouth.
‘Seriously?’ Dean asked. ‘Not the most romantic pick up line there, buddy.’
They would run in, drenched to the bone from the thick, wet snow. He’d light a fire straight away. He’d have to coax her to remove the wet clothing. Definitely the coat, at the very least. Shoes and socks, too. He’d reassure her that there were no ulterior motives as he took off his own coat. Didn’t want to catch pneumonia, after all. Maybe the jacket should come off. The tie. Definitely the tie.
Dean held the cuff behind his back and thrust out his right hand. 'I should introduce myself,' he said. 'Dean Winchester.'
‘So…if I take this off,’ Dean said, thumbing the cuff on Castiel’s wrist, ‘are you gonna go all glowy-blue-eyes on me again?’
Dean blinked, thrown off by the question. ‘Uh…actually…yeah.’ He noticed that Castiel’s blush brightened. ‘Don’t tell me you were the cause of that.’
went off on how I have the same
‘I don’t know,’ Gabriel miserably replied. ‘I found a piece of plastic in Cas’s back, and I was too depressed to look for what it goes to.’
‘What are calipers?’ Dean leaned back and gave Castiel a wary and uncertain stare. There was something about the smile he was receiving that he didn’t particularly like.
taping
‘You guys are fucking obsessive. You know that, right?’ Dean said as they passed a man guarding the foyer. He nodded to the agent and received a smirk. ‘Shut up, Uriel.’
Castiel shook his head. ‘They’re not very bright.’
Castiel shrugged. ‘Honestly? Because Jody’s enamored, and Crowley’s a little curious himself. Even if he won’t admit it. The one he’s worked with had little interest in speaking about culture.’ He sighed and smiled softly as Dean reached over and tugged at his shirt.
Dean nodded, still feeling his legs and flexing his toes. He followed the path of his hand up his thigh to his hip and stopped. ‘Uh… What’s…wait. This is…’ He took his penis in his hand and giggled. ‘You keep it on the outside?!
‘Cas, you—!’ Gabriel grabbed Castiel and pressed their foreheads together, drawing a small gasp from his brother.
As the week wore on, Dean was getting more and more irritated with Gabriel.  The Archangel would show up in the oddest places. Dean opened the fridge once in search of beer, but instead found Gabriel, drowning in one of Sam's coats. On several occasions, he was found sleeping in the bathtub on a pile of Sam's clothing.
‘Are we there yet?’ Dean whined. He kept stumbling and tripping over tree roots and small stones, and his legs were getting tired from the exertion.
Gabriel slouched and nodded before turning away. ‘We’ll be in my room if you get the time…’ He hurried around the corner, feeling his face heat up. How was
'Get away from him!!' Dean and Gabriel shouted in unison.
‘Sure…uh… You wouldn’t mind?’ Gabriel shifted from foot to foot. Sam wanted to see him again? He gave a slight grin and stepped forward. He wouldn’t need to submit an application if Sam actually
Castiel blinked at the invitation. ‘Um…’
Castiel punched Dean in the arm and flinched back as pain shot up his own arm. He whined lowly as he hugged himself with his arms and wings. ‘It’s not
Dean sighed helplessly. Somehow, he had managed to get Castiel and himself dressed. Or, at least, half dressed. He was in his boxers and a t-shirt, and Castiel was in a pair of shorts without his shirt. Glitter still clung to Castiel’s shoulders and chest, and Dean was having a hard time keeping his priorities straight. As beautiful as his mate looked sparkling under the light, he hated seeing the tear-stained cheeks.
Gabriel pulled a sickened frown. He didn’t think he’d be able to sleep that night. Not with visions of his brother and Crowley running through his head. He’d only seen the shark expert in two suits. Business suit and wetsuit. The man looked more like a lawyer than a scientist. He couldn’t help but wonder what his brother and Crowley could possibly get up to. He could feel the case’s weight getting heavier in his hand. ‘Useful’s…nice,’ he weakly replied.
‘I-I uh… Dean? Don’t get too close, he’s….er….temperamental,’ Castiel said. He set the bags down and went to stand near Muffin, ready to scoop the cat up the moment the claws came out. ‘Wait, don’t—’ He broke off and stared dumbly when Dean reached out to touch Muffin and no hissing was heard.
‘Oh, my God, Dean!’ Sam hissed as he shoved Dean aside. He stepped into the hall and shut the door behind himself. ‘I am
‘I’m not scared off. I…’ Sam broke off with a frustrated sigh. ‘I’m actually more than willing to run off with you,’ he admitted. ‘But there are a few things I need to figure out first.’
‘No shit!’ Dean exclaimed. ‘It’s not every day I find out my stalker watched me
‘Yes it is. I’m a…a fuck up, and I’ve ruined everything.’ Castiel was grateful when Muffin didn’t struggle as he pulled the cat closer.
‘I didn’t want to sleep with him,’ Castiel replied. ‘I mean…I
for me. It’s the one thing that makes sense out of your crazy human dating crap. And as for being your research project, I don’t mind. Seriously. Drop it already,’ Dean said with a teasing smile.
“Yes! That’s what I’ve been telling you!”
Dean scrubs a hand down his face, “What am I going to do?”
“Not like that!” He exclaimed, a bit loudly if the looks he got from other customers is anything to go by. “I just meant that he seems like a nice guy and that’s
“Hey red,” Dean said softly as they hugged. Sitting down he continued “I know, and I’m so sorry it’s been such a busy month with making the auto shop into a full-time business instead of Bobby’s hobby. Lets see… the meet up with Cassie was ok, I mean, I don’t think there’s a chance of us getting back together but I did manage to patch things over at least.”
“Yes,” Cas replies, “We can see souls and that makes it difficult to hunt when you can see the pain and anguish you are causing simply for your own enjoyment.”
what you were saying, I don’t think you were even speaking English,” she snarks back.
“What do you mean?” Charlie asks, “This isn’t a problem, this is great! He can be part of our posse! Is he nice?”
“Oh, sure, thank you,” Cas still seems a bit embarrassed about the whole growling at his roommate who he’s known for all of 10 hours. He climbs out of bed stretching his arms over his head and his wings up and out, then ruffling them causing all the feathers to stand on end and then smooth out. Dean has to quickly avert his eyes before Cas sees him gawking and embarrasses himself, because
“You’re on time,” Bobby grumbles, “Did you bring me a coffee?”
“Oh, don’t apologize for that,” Dean replies, “Do you want me to scootch over or is there anything I can do?”
, Dean realizes- Dean knows that Cas has the same class as he does. They spoke of their schedules last night trying to get to know one another and they both have to take their senior writing course, it’s every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday at 8 am.
“Oh is this what the issue is?” She asks laughing, “You embarrassed yourself?”
The pathway is paved with smoothed over stones underneath their feet. As can be expected with a campus that has all of their dorms named after trees, there’s plenty of trees and plants bordering the walkway. Dean takes in a deep breath and smells freshly cut grass as he looks at the sun filtering it’s way through the leaves of the trees. It’s the last week of August, so everything is still vibrant and green, but there’s the scent that hints at the upcoming Autumn.
“Oh, cool! I’m in Southern Oak.” He shuts the gleaming black door to the impala and looks at Sam as he extricates his gangly legs from the passenger seat. “And Sammy over here, is in Rosewood in the Deciduous complex,” He tells Charlie as he reaches over to ruffle Sam’s hair.
“Yeah, yeah,” Dean rubs at the back of his neck, slightly embarrassed, he changes the subject, “So…. Do you know who your roommate is?”
he thinks to himself. One would thing working as a mechanic means that you can make your own schedule and wake up whenever you please, but noooo Bobby- his boss and uncle/non-official adoptive father- insists that the shop should be open early enough for people to bring their cars in for minor maintenance if they need to before work.
The shower sputters to life and hisses in protest as water is pushed through the pipes. He turns the knob so the shower is almost as hot as it’ll go before undressing and getting under the steaming spray. The grime from the shop runs down his skin to pool at his feet giving the water a brown tint before it swirls down the drain. Reaching out from behind the curtain he grabs a hold of the soft grey towel and soaks the water off of his body. Luckily his room is right across from the bathroom, the small apartment gets cold at night and he’s reluctant to pay for any heating especially since he’s only really at the apartment at night. Padding into his room he grabs a loose tee and slips it over his head and steps into a soft pair of cotton boxers. Finally he can crawl into his plush memory-foam bed and pile what looks like an endless amount of blankets on top of himself to keep the chill out.
Slowly, Dean opened his eyes, looking first at the floor and both of their feet, rising eventually over Cas’s body, taking in the trench coat Dean loves so much and his blue tie that seemed to match Cas’s eyes perfectly. Finally, landing on Cas’s face, what he does not expect is the pain and pity in his eyes, and that pity was the last thing he wanted from Cas.
Cas immediately relaxed a bit, clearly he had been sitting on this question for a while. He knew how Dean had felt about Jack when he first learned about his true parentage, he was relieved. Dean let out a small disbelieving sound,
Cas nodded, “It turns out Chuck was just much more of a coward than we thought. The Empty was terrified when Jack turned up.”
Sam and Dean exchanged a look, equal parts concerned and relieved.
Sam looked between Dean and Jack,
Sam and Jack had had questions, too many questions, he had barely heard anything they had said. Instead, their words morphing into a cacophony of noise that threatened to deafen him as he choked on his explanation. His mind screaming Cas loved me back and now he’s gone, and my love was the murder weapon. Finally, when he could muster the words all he could say was a curt,
Every object that was in Dean’s arms was immediately dropped to the floor, his eyes wide, heart rate skyrocketing with each moment. He whipped his head towards Sam, whose expression was a mirror to Deans. They both sprinted down the stairs to find Cas, standing at the map table. Sam was the first to act, running up he threw his arms around Cas who hugged back without hesitation. Sam pulled back, both hands still on Cas’ shoulders,
“Yes Dean?”
“I’m in love with him.”
Back in the other room, a charged silence sat between Cas and Dean, neither one knowing how to start this conversation, every time Dean thought to open his mouth to speak it felt like his heart rose and blocked his airway making speech impossible. Cas watched him nervously, inching forward every few breaths he took,
There was a fragile hope in the way that word left Cas’ mouth. A hope that made Dean’s heart beat out a stuttering rhythm,
Sam was no stranger to these, he had them all the time after Jess. He knew he had no time to be shocked or speechless, right now his brother needed him. Slowly he placed a gentle hand on Dean’s back and began to rub slow comforting circles,
“How could you possibly know that?” Dean asked in a broken voice.
“Before you say anything Dean, both of you will fuck up. That’s life, that’s being in a relationship. The important part is to remember to talk about it, address the issues.”
“Okay then, tomorrow it is.”
Cas flinched, he was worried this is where the conversation would go. A fight with Dean was the last thing he wanted. Dean sighed deep,
“What? But Cas’s dead! Lucifer got him. We both saw it.” Sam exclaimed,
Dean nodded and stretched slightly,
“Cas,” Dean said “I meant it. What I said to you.”
“Apparently I annoyed an ancient cosmic entity so much it sent me back.”
Sam scoffed, “I don’t want to make light of this but Dean, none of that was your fault.”
“Dean-“
“Hey Cas, buddy,” Dean chuckled nervously “C’mon, don’t leave me hanging here.”
“You are the first thing I think of when I wake up, the last thing I think about before I fall asleep. I mean, Cas, you’re in my goddamn dreams. Yes, you’re my best friend, but more than that I love you. I’m in love with you, in every way.”
“I’m in love with him, and every time I lose him a part of me goes too. Sammy I don’t know how many more pieces I got left.”
Sam smiled but still looked confused, “He just…pulled you out?”
“Of course, Cas! You’re my best friend-“
A deafening silence floated between them, the ex-righteous man and his fallen angel. Dean waited with held breath for the disgust and rejection that was coming, for the anger, the rage, the hate he deserved. And yet, only silence remained. After an immeasurable amount of time, Dean felt a hand rest on his jaw. It took everything he had not to sigh, as he felt that familiar fluttering sensation in his chest that had become synonymous with Cas so long ago.
Before him was his indestructible big brother with tears falling down his face, looking more vulnerable than Sam had ever seen him. He looked, frankly, like he would shake apart or perhaps shatter if Sam placed the hand on his shoulder like he had instinctually moved to do. Dean hiccuped through his tears, trying to take big breaths, Sam stared at his brother, desperately confused when Dean started to hyperventilate. Then it all clicked,
“It’s my fault,” Dean whispered over Sam’s attempt to get Dean’s attention
“If it’s all the same to you I would much rather stay with my family after that.”
The impala sped along a dimly lit rural highway weeks later; being on the road used to give Dean a sense of emancipation. There was a freedom in knowing that to any other drivers who spared a passing glance could make up any story about him and to that individual it was the truth. The road made those who traveled upon it anonymous, blank slates for people to build their own truths and perceptions. On the road he wasn’t just Dean Winchester, he wasn’t the son of an abusive father, he wasn’t subject to the obligations of other hunters, he wasn’t a heartbroken middle aged man, he was whatever he wanted to be and the protagonist in whatever tale other travelers assigned him. The road held little expectation of its subjects.That anonymity and nomadic nature had long been a comfort for him.
“I understand, Dean. I think that would be a good idea.”
“I love you, Dean, ever since I found your soul in Hell, I had never seen anything so beautiful, so undeniably good in nature.”
Dean held up a hand and Cas immediately paused,
Dean cut himself off as a fresh wave of tears threatened to spill over. He ran a hand over his face, looking up at the roof of the car in an attempt to hold them back. Sam waited patiently for his brother to share more information.
“I don’t know who I thought I was kidding” Dean chuckled.
There in front of him stood his angel, trench coat and all.
“I love you; I think I have since purgatory,” Dean said, happy tears still falling down his face.
Cas froze, this tone always made him nervous. Dean was hardly ever this serious, when Dean spoke like this it always meant something big. He couldn’t look at Dean, afraid of what might be said next,
“I don’t want to stress you out more than you probably already are but..when you feel a bit better, I think you and I should talk. There’s some stuff I…We gotta clear up.”
He threw his arms around Cas in a tight embrace. Sam saw Cas immediately melt into Dean’s arms and slowly meet the hug, wrapping his arms around Dean and closing his eyes.
He paused, searching Cas’ face for some sign that he understood what Dean was saying. The death grip on his arm was still there, Cas’ eyes were burning as he stared back at Dean.
Dean understood this all too well,
It was almost overwhelming, the intensity in Cas’ eyes as he spoke.
Cas smiled at that, he imagined a small Dean rocking an even smaller Sam in his arms. Maybe even humming to him, attempting to calm him down enough to sleep. The image morphed then, into current Dean holding a small bundle and smiling his golden smile. He imagined walking into the kitchen, seeing Dean with a baby on his hip, whistling away while he prepared dinner. Cas’ heart felt like it could burst at that thought, he could see it all now, what a fantastic father Dean would be.
Anna went on to explain what her Grace was, not that Dean needed to know. He just couldn't imagine doing such a thing as ripping out his Grace. No matter what.
Castiel shot Balthazar a dirty look before looking back at Dean. ‘As I said, I’m sorry if I made you uncomfortable.’
‘Go away!’ Gabriel shouted back.
‘I believe you have me confused with Gabriel,’ Castiel replied. ‘He’s been sleeping with Dean’s
'An angel,' Bobby repeated flatly.
Dean’s jaw dropped when he entered the small building. Whereas the Singer Hotel had a cozy feel to it, this felt… Dean didn’t have a word for it. He could only think of it as not being lived in. It looked nice, but it smelled…weird. He walked further into the room, and his leg brushed against something soft. He tripped, and Castiel caught him.
‘Great! Bright and early. Eight okay with you?’ Samandriel asked, pulling out his notebook.
Castiel frowned at Dean. ‘Stuff?’ He watched in confusion as Dean got up and left the room, almost tripping along the way. His eyes lingered on Dean’s ass. He leaned back and waited for Dean to return. He licked at Dean’s cum that was on his hand and made a face. It tasted just like seawater. He pulled off his used condom and leaned over the bed to grab his boxers. He wiped himself off and looked up as Dean came up and stood in front of him. He gently wiped Dean clean and gave him a suck and kiss before looking up with a shy smile.
Samandriel nodded happily and disappeared.
‘Sam. I know what I’m doing,’ Dean said calmly. ‘I’m chasing a mate, and I’m tryin’ to do it as human as I can. I can use any help you’re willin’ to give.’
He looked around the room as he listened to his father. 'Yes, I found him. But, there are...complications. … I'm afraid we have both been bound to Hunters. … I believe Gabriel feels the same way. … Sam and Dean Winchester.'
Sam knelt down and kissed Gabriel’s forehead. ‘That’s no problem,’ he said before standing and taking his shirt off. ‘We don’t have to go that deep to have a good time.’
The emotions slotted into place for Castiel. He would have spoken to Dean earlier had he known everything would have been this simple. All the knots were slowly unraveling, and he could begin to trace where some of Dean’s stronger feelings lead—a great bit of annoyance was set aside just for Gabriel, and there was a strong love for Sam.
Gabriel bounced anxiously in his seat as he waited for the others to arrive for dinner. One by one, the rest of the small television crew showed up. Sam set six glasses of water around the table and gave Gabriel a concerned look.
Sam looked away. ‘I’m not sure… Both,’ he admitted.
‘Cas?’
Mary Winchester's first born would have been Michael's true vessel, had there been no complications during childbirth. Seraphiel had been watching and seized his chance, taking the now empty vessel. His corruption ensured his ability to take the corpse, and he was close enough to Lucifer to hitch a ride on the bloodline with no ill-effect. In silence, Seraphiel slipped in and became Dean Winchester. John and Mary Winchester’s miracle baby.
, thank you very much!’ Castiel retorted. He was smiling, but it began to slip as his words caught up with him. ‘I used to be a drag queen, and now everyone knows,’ he whispered.
‘I dried out on the beach…got picked up by the authorities…and uh…met them at the hospital where I was getting checked out. Bobby was there for a sprained ankle. They had extra room, so they took me in,’ Sam replied. ‘It was only supposed to be until I uh…“remembered” who I was.’
Castiel angled his head so he could see Dean better and frowned. ‘It wasn’t supposed to go that way.’ He felt a slight twinge of regret from Dean and quickly continued. ‘But I liked it! Very much. No regrets.’
Gabriel stepped away from the helm and motioned for Sam to take over. ‘You’re still tour guide, so get to it. I’ll get the chips,’ he said as he opened the small door next to the helm and ducked below deck.
‘No way!’ Charlie said gleefully. ‘This is the sex tape!
Sam sighed as he leaned back into Gabriel. ‘Yeah, but…it shouldn’t be this hard. Well, maybe with Cas, but…not with you.’
Gabriel looked around. He tried to extend his senses, but with some of the dampening spell still intact, he could only locate Bobby on the floor below them. At least, he assumed it was Bobby since there were two angels and a demon with the human. He shrugged in response. ‘I can’t tell,’ he replied, sharing in Sam’s worry. ‘You don’t think he went after Cas, do you? It’s too dangerous!’
‘Ass shots galore.’
‘That
Castiel carefully untangled himself from Dean’s limp hold and got off the hospital bed. He readjusted the blankets with a soft sigh. Why did he come to check on Dean? Gabriel and Anna had the situation under control. He didn’t know Dean. Not personally.
He waited while Crowley passed the phone to Sam, a few cutting remarks drifting over the connection.
‘He usually drags up crabs and tuna,’ Benny answered.
Castiel was jarred awake, mostly from the knee on his wing. When his eyes finally focused, he was treated to his brother's naked backside disappearing into the bathroom. He heard a high pitched yelp, followed by hushed tones.
'I don't...they're not...a good...example,' Dean said, lamely. ‘Would you even be able to see ‘em?’
?’ He pulled a disgusted face. ‘There’s no way! Even if they
He had been watching the young agent for well over three years. Never did he feel any sort of emotional attachment. Not until that first kiss. After Dean had pushed him against the building and kissed him, Castiel hadn’t been able to get Dean out of his head.
brother,’ he replied. ‘Hey, I’m on my way to see him. You wanna come with?’
Castiel shook his head. ‘He was on this project first. It wouldn’t be right.’
That evening, the whole crew had gathered in the dining room. Laughter filled the room as Samandriel recounted one of the many times he had made an aspirin run in the pouring rain.
Sam got up, surreptitiously checking to make sure Dean wasn’t visible. ‘Actually, I live there. I work for the Singers,’ he replied.
Castiel held the cat in his arms and smiled. ‘He’ll be fine when the sedatives wear off.’
‘Then you won’t be surprised or worried when you can’t find me,’ Castiel replied.
Since I wrote this before Metatron was introduced in the show, I feel like I should point out that this is not the same Metatron. The Metatron mentioned in this chapter is God's personal scribe.
‘Asprin’s good, too!’ Dean called out.
Castiel sighed. He didn’t understand Karen’s fascination with feeding him food in the shape of happy faces. This time, his plate had eyes made of eggs, bacon for a mouth, and seasoned potatoes for hair. He looked up at the sound of Balthazar and Anna entering the kitchen.
Castiel slowly shook his head, aware of Balthazar coming up to stand just behind him. ‘I uh…wasn’t sure that you were…real,’ he said with some difficulty.
‘What?’
‘Who’s the loser angel with the mullet?’ Gabriel asked through a mouthful of popcorn from his place on the floor in front of Castiel’s legs. Gabriel and Castiel had rarely left each other’s side after being reunited, going so far as to spend some nights huddled together on the couch rather than in their respective Hunter’s bed.
Sam rolled his eyes, but didn't say anything as he returned to the box he was currently working on. Dean was bored out of his mind, but Bobby needed the help. And they had already found so many useful books. Little bits of knowledge to help them along in the future. Sam was hopeful that they would find something to help them with the apocalypse and the seals.
‘Castiel, right. How are your hands doing?’
going to go skiing, but…you just happened to be in the right place at the right time. Off season Bora Bora. Decent weather. Cheaper.’
‘Cas refuses to say “dragon,” so we’re stuck with it.’
Dean’s eye twitched. ‘I’m mad at you for acting like this and shutting me out. Not for having freaky-ass powers,’ he retorted.
‘Then why is Dean researching binding cuffs like his life depends on it?’ Balthazar asked in a knowing tone.
‘Barely! And even
I felt another angel somewhere,’ Karen said. She looked over Anna with sad eyes. ‘Did it hurt?’
.-.-.-.-.
‘Now, wake up.’
He looked to Bobby, stricken and hoping Bobby wouldn't make any stupid moves. He was grateful that Castiel had a cooler head than he did as Bobby fell to the ground, unconscious.
to work! What are we doing
.-.-.-.-.
‘It was
Benny looked over his shoulder at Castiel. ‘I may or may not have an answer.’
This chapter is a little...well, it's here to push the story past this point, so very little dialogue. 'Metamorphosis' pretty much happens just as it did (and this chapter focuses on Dean's thoughts during that episode), same with 'Monster Movie.' 'Yellow Fever' didn't happen. If it did, then Dean just nipped it in the bud out of annoyance.
‘Now, as you were saying?’
, I’m gonna have you ride my cock until you make yourself cum.’
Gabriel buried himself in his wings as his sobs renewed. He didn’t want to leave. He wanted to stay. He wanted his brother to have his freedom. Even if Castiel was bound to a Hunter, it was better than the gilded cage he’d been raised in. He looked up in shock when he felt Sam’s hand gently caressing a wing.
And, like clockwork, Castiel showed with flashing lights and fully extended wings.
‘He’ll believe you,’ Dean assured. ‘That’s why
‘Well, get ready to bury it, ‘cuz your scene’s tomorrow,’ Gabriel said with a smirk. Poking fun at his baby brother was always a good way to distract him from his own worries—and now he had so much more ammo.
slip up,’ he said with a grin. ‘But we couldn’t keep the rant. Way too many expletives. The whole tirade woulda been a bleep.’
‘W-w-what the…fuck. What the actual fuck?!’
‘I want mine to be gold. To match my wings,’ Gabriel said, spreading his wings for emphasis. ‘I mean, silver’s nice and traditional, but it just clashes.’
.-.-.-.-.
?’ Dean wasn’t certain whether he preferred being under surveillance or being stalked.
Dean let out a laugh as he took the cufflink back. ‘Good one, Bobby. But, I already know Angel Corp’s not real.’ He looked back up at Bobby’s grave expression. ‘They aren’t, right?’
‘Stop calling!’ Gabriel hissed into the phone. His eyes quickly flicked to Sam, and he turned away. ‘Everything’s copacetic. Really.’
Castiel caught his breath and sat on the couch next to Dean. ‘What evidence?’
I saw. I just didn’t get what it did, exactly.’
'Please don't tell me we're going camping,' Gabriel said with distaste. 'I'm much too fragile for that.'
Gabriel let go of the tail and tried to move away from it, but he had trouble staying afloat. One moment, his head was under water, the next, he was half over the railing of the boat. He rolled ungracefully onto the deck as he was pushed the rest of the way. He stared up at Sam’s face, peeking over the edge of the boat.
Dean leaned forward and whined as Castiel leaned away. ‘I’m drugged up now… Let’s pick up where we left off.’
‘I gotta say…TV is definitely my favorite human invention,’ Dean said as he grabbed a handful of popcorn from the bowl that rested on his lap.

‘And with Spot you get to see what a
Over half an hour had passed. Gabriel was wandering aimlessly around the cellar, randomly adding gaudy curtains and questionable decorations to the walls. Sam made the mistake of asking why Gabriel added a particular set of beads to the wall, and Dean was all too enthusiastic to explain their purpose in graphic detail. Sam didn't know which embarrassed him more: the description, or the fact that his brother seemed to be speaking from personal experience.
uses a napkin!’
Castiel chuckled as he leaned down and picked up the camera. He tilted his head curiously as he handed the camera to Balthazar. ‘Did you want to tape the strip tease?’
Dean turned to the computer to find it off. He powered it on, and sighed in relief as it came to life. The screen blinked at him, alerting him that it experienced a fatal error. ‘Sammy!’
Castiel nodded.
‘He means well… At least, I think he does.’
had been a
Castiel was a picture of pure irritation and hatred wrapped up in a wetsuit when Benny pulled his boat up the dock in front of the Four Seasons. His eyes swept over the boat and found no sign of Dean. ‘He’s avoiding me, isn’t he?’ he bit out as he boarded.
‘You shouldn’t need to—’
Bobby frowned. Karen cared deeply about him and the boys. But, when it came to all others, she lacked any sort of emotional connection. He had caught her sighing and staring into space on several occasions when they would have to speak to the families of victims. Gabriel would laugh maniacally at tragic news reports, but the moment Sam would misplace something or stub a toe, Gabriel was right there, acting as if the world had come to an end.
‘She’s lying,’ Dean said as Castiel set his shirt on a nearby rock. ‘She just wants to see your ass.’
There was a knock on the door and Gabriel groaned as he slouched. ‘I’m almost ready!’ he shouted. He gave Sam and apologetic smile as he stood. ‘I’ll see if we can get things wrapped up before sundown.’
Castiel forced a smile. ‘That’s just his way of saying he won’t do anything to expose you,’ he explained. ‘He has an image to maintain.’
Castiel’s brows rose in realization. ‘Oh. That. The shock caught up to me.’
Dean paused and quickly caught up. ‘Your
a mean turkey,’ he said. ‘Never thought a turkey could get possessed.’
‘Quite understandable…?’
Humans have always struggled for survival against the nightmares lurking in the dark. For centuries, their numbers were slowly falling. In one last stand, a powerful witch changed the people of her village, giving them the power to fend off the monsters.
Gabriel sighed and ran a hand through his hair. He didn’t know what to do. Should he just tell Dean that Castiel was a compulsive liar and see how he’d take it? Or should he let the relationship run its course like all the others? One look at Castiel, and he could tell which choice Castiel preferred.
‘You’re implying I’m part of it, too,’ Dean pointed out.
Balthazar thought back to when Castiel had been standing outside his door. ‘Not entirely.’
Rocky. What do you find wrong with him?’ Castiel said with a confused frown.
‘Hey! Why are you two so out of it?’ Dean asked after they had been on the road for about an hour.
Gabriel moaned around the hardening cock in his mouth as Sam’s tongue teased the base of his own. ‘Mmm… Sammy, tha—oh!’ He gasped as lube hit his crack and ran down. Squirming, he rubbed at Sam’s thighs as a finger slowly entered him. ‘Don’t be a tease back there…’ He groaned and pushed back as Sam’s tongue lapped at his thigh before teeth gently nipped him.
‘Not really,’ Gabriel admitted. ‘That whole techy side makes no sense to me. You get more than one wire coming out of a thing, and I get confused.’
‘Triton.’
His mouth snapped shut as the table fell silent around him. ‘Not that…I’ve ever tried.’ He hung his head as laughter erupted around him and silently handed the phone to Castiel.
Dean’s fins flared out as he had an idea. ‘I’ll get to know him.’
Gabriel leaned forward and stared at his father. ‘What?! Even
‘What the fuck were you doing?!’ Gabriel shouted. He caught Balthazar’s grin and Castiel’s grimace. He dropped his shoulders in defeat. ‘Oh, come on! You wanna screw each other? Do it when you’re
Sam sighed as he sat on the edge of the pier. Without physically dragging his brother away, there would be no way to guarantee Dean’s safety. ‘I guess,’ he reluctantly mumbled. ‘Oh! Get this,
‘They’re still white.’
‘You never… Oh.’ Dean laughed uncomfortably and rubbed the back of his neck as he looked away. ‘Well, I guess you did find uh…Goldy-green pretty early.’
He took a shuddering breath and steadied his feet beneath him. He tried to put his weight on his legs, but a sharp pain ran up his left leg, reminding him of his broken ankle. He yelped and winced as his ankle gave out. The wounds on his wrists reopened from his short fall, and he struggled to put his weight onto his right foot. Everything hurt.
thing. It might have a pretty paint job, but you don’t know anything about the engine or where she’s been.’
‘It’s okay. Everything’s fine now. You’re safe. I’m alive. Lucifer’s dead. There’s nothing to worry about,’ Dean said, rubbing soothing circles on Castiel’s back.
Gabriel glared down at where Sam had disappeared from. He held his own breath to gauge how long Sam could stay submerged. It wasn’t long before he had to gasp for another breath. Then another. By the fourth, his heart was pounding with anxiety.
‘See him… W-what?’
anything. No sound girl, no cameraman… There’s no reason.’
‘I guess.’
‘Wonderful,’ Anna flatly replied. ‘You get to deal with him directly from now on. I am washing my hands of this.’
I broke up with him.’
Dean slowly shook his head. ‘No…I… I’m good. Just thought I saw someone I knew.’ He gave Jo a reassuring smile. ‘It’s nothing. Really. Looked like someone I dated in high school,’ he lied effortlessly.
‘Interviews… Public knowledge of just who we are,’ Dean replied.
‘I’m not going on land!’ Dean said in disgust.
Dean’s fins perked up as he wondered if it was anyone he knew. ‘Who is it? I mean, what do they look like?’
Castiel looked down. ‘I’m sorry.’
Castiel didn’t look up from the book his was reading. He sighed and turned to the next page. ‘Reading.’
for being a fanatic.’
Sam glared at the unknown man. The man was holding a gun, and Gabriel was on the floor. Gabriel, who was supposed to be protecting his brother. He noticed how the stranger shook his head very slightly, looking past his shoulder. Sam turned to see the nurse from the night before standing just behind him. She was holding up a very familiar looking syringe.
‘There’s no one else here! I’m sure they won’t miss you for an hour.’
Gabriel bared his teeth and stuck out his tongue before deeming himself acceptable. ‘Okay, I think I’m ready.’
Gabriel shuddered as he tried to imagine Bobby as a merman.
Sam entered his room and found Gabriel sitting on the window sill with his legs hanging outside the window. ‘Hey…um…’ He stopped himself before he asked what was wrong. ‘I don’t wanna pry,’ he said, ‘but…I’m here if you wanna talk about it.’
‘I can masquerade as a human,’ Anna elaborated. ‘Balthazar wears a false cuff, and we go out as Hunter and angel.’
‘No! I’m not…’ Castiel backed away as Gabriel drew closer. He glanced around the room, feeling annoyed at how everyone was just watching the pair in amusement. It was bad enough that he had been wrangled into doing drunken rants, but he would not let Gabriel manipulate him into doing drag for his show. He needed to cut this line of thought immediately, and he only knew of one topic that would work quickly and effectively. ‘Michael and Lucifer know about mermaids!’ he shouted.
‘Not if you’re distracted,’ Castiel replied.
As Anna stroked Dean's cheek, he began to feel alone again. There was one fleeting moment when he first found out she was an angel, that maybe there was another that could understand. But he was wrong. She had no idea what it was to Fall. Not the way
ass,’ Dean said, rubbing his arm. ‘You have an ass meant for porno, babe! Trust me, I did my research.’
Gabriel bit his tongue as he felt a clenching around his chest. 'I...I did it to protect someone. One supernatural death, and humans look at it more closely, but if there’s more, you don't. You just kill off the creature,' he bit out.
‘Well, I
‘Why?’ Charlie asked. She pouted as Gabriel ejected the CD and took it.
Castiel stared up at the ceiling. ‘With,’ he replied breathlessly. ‘Tell me what to do. Makes it better.’

‘And they do try,’ Crowley said with an amused smile. ‘And it
theme was playing. Very loudly, and a little too close to Castiel’s ear. He rolled over, ignoring the tune as he snuggled against Dean’s chest. Dean. Dean the mermaid. Or merman, rather. He still couldn’t quite believe it. He felt better when he didn’t actively think about it—unless he was completely focused on studying Dean’s marine features.
‘Anything,’ Sam breathed.
‘I promise to be very distracting later,’ Castiel said.
Gabriel looked over the edge of the bed to where Sam had thrown the pants in question. They were twisted beyond recognition and stained in cum. ‘Yeah… I have another pair I can wear. Or we can just do close-ups and whatnot. Either way, it’s not a problem.’
Gabriel was going to be insufferable. He was going to be even more driven to find
‘Actually, he’s completely mammal,’ Castiel pointed out.
‘Well, I can be by today. I actually wanted to take over the bungalow for the day. Give an impromptu fashion show…wander about naked…desecrate the plunge pool,’ Castiel said as he ran his hand down Dean’s chest. He hummed as Dean took his hand and began kissing his fingers.
‘It’s not that,’ Sam said.
‘You didn’t think to break it a little more easy?’
‘I don’t know what you’re talking about,’ Crowley replied.
Castiel scoffed as he left the window. ‘And how will that work out? Are you going to wear those little blow-up arm things?’
‘Why would I
Castiel raised his hand and placed his fingers against Balthazar’s lips. He rolled his eyes as Balthazar licked and sucked on his fingers.
Castiel made a small, distressed noise in the back of his throat. ‘Yes, of course,’ he happily replied.
‘I need you to take care of a problem for me.’
Dean ignored Sam’s protests and pulled himself up so that he was once again peeking over the edge at Castiel. ‘Right here,’ he said with a smile. ‘I uh…slipped.’
‘Great,’ Gabriel said in a forced tone. He still had scratches running the length of his arms from when he had to force the cat into the carrier at Castiel’s apartment. He had even taken precautions and wore a heavy coat and gloves for protection. ‘He’s not gonna murder me in my sleep, is he?’
Castiel tensed then slowly brought his arms up and wrapped them around Dean. 'Have you tried to come back?'
Dean backed off of Castiel, crestfallen. He really needed to figure out how humans operated. How did humans let others know that they were seeking a potential mate? That they had more than one suitor? Mermaids would mark each other. It let the competition know that they had to make their move. More than once, Dean was used as a kick in the tail for his partner’s intended target. He desperately hoped this wasn’t the case. Maybe he shouldn’t have let instinct take over. ‘Er…sorry. I uh…’
‘Right. Go. Go play with your new boytoy,’ Balthazar said as he handed the camera equipment to Castiel. ‘Hope you’re happy in your little fantasy world. Just don’t get yourself killed.’
Dean coughed as he shifted his gaze back to Castiel. Whatever was going on, he was determined to turn it back in his favor. 'In that case,' he said with a grin, 'you can sweeten my coffee any day.' He downed the rest of the coffee and handed the mug back to Castiel and was rewarded with a sweet, but slightly confused smile.
‘There’s a Tombstone in the freezer,’ Bobby said. ‘Help yourself when yer ready.’
‘I’m sure he tells you that all the time,’ Balthazar said.
Sam chuckled and petted Gabriel’s wings. ‘I’d hate to know what you
going to sit there and be a good boy,’ Gabriel declared. ‘
'Because,' Gabriel replied, yanking the condom out of Castiel's hand. He tossed it back into the drawer and slammed the drawer shut.
Castiel nodded as Samandriel jotted down the time and a few notes on the scenes that would be shot. ‘Then I guess I’ll see everyone tomorrow.’
‘Doesn’t sound like a very good brother,’ Benny said as he turned back to the helm.
Dean reached out and placed a hand on Castiel’s ankle. ‘No, stay. I
Castiel thrust faster as Dean’s warm seed spilled over his hand and muscles tightened around his cock. He kissed Dean as his own thrusts became more desperate. One final push, and he was over the edge, moaning as he rode out his high. He rested his head on Dean’s chest, panting and gasping for breath.
‘Eh… A kind of fish,’ Dean replied. ‘Don’t really know what they’re called, but it got caught in Benny’s net a while ago. He let it go, ‘cuz it was kinda freaky lookin’.’
paying, right? Cas didn’t just say that?’ Gabriel asked Crowley with a suspicious frown. ‘I better not get stuck with the bill. Again.’
‘I thought it would help,’ Castiel admitted with a shrug.
.-.-.-.-.
‘I’m old! I’m gonna need reading glasses soon! Gabriel’s already having trouble reading, and
‘I’m pretty talented myself,’ Castiel said as he slowly spread Dean’s legs. He reached back and grabbed the lube and condom before leaning down and gently kissing the precum from the tip of Dean’ penis. He opened his lips and took Dean into his mouth, rubbing his tongue against Dean’s shaft as he took Dean deeper. He reached the base of Dean’s cock and slowly pulled back, enjoying the soft, needy moans coming from the man beneath him. He lubed up his fingers and worked the slick substance around Dean’s hole as he guided a leg over his shoulder.
‘And shoes?’ Dean asked as he scratched at his hip where skin turned to scale.
‘Y-you don’t have to do this. I mean, I already called a tow truck…’
‘No… That wasn’t a happy sound,’ Castiel said quietly as he sat back on his heels. ‘Is there something wrong with your striping? Your colors? Are you… Are you considered too vibrant?’
‘Uh…hi,’ Sam replied. He looked around and saw no one else in the lobby. Just him, Charlie, and the tiki heads. ‘So…you’ve been dry the whole time?’
on your back,’ Anna said lowly as she got closer to Castiel.
Dean was flabbergasted. Spy. Definitely another spy. Fuck. His mind was too busy repeating the words that he missed Ms. Skrims’s apology. He snapped back to reality and sidled up to Jimmy. ‘I hope you don’t mind,’ he said to Ms. Skrims, ‘but I’d really like to share a dance with Jimmy right now.’
Castiel sat at the foot of Dean’s bed. He waited patiently while Dean drew a few symbols onto the door in chalk.
Crowley rolled his eyes. ‘Well, it’s not up to
‘I think Cas is right, but I like
‘Oh, shit. I’m sorry!’ Dean said, backing away from Castiel.
Dean leaned forward to look at Castiel, but Crowley caught his gaze instead.
‘What are you after?’ Benny asked, not quite wanting to get up, and not quite trusting the merman to his own devices.
‘Who is it?’ Dean’s voice called out from within the room. ‘Did they bring drugs? I can’t laugh!’
‘What kind of fish?’ Casitel asked as he touched Dean’s spines. He gasped lightly as they twitched beneath his fingers.
Castiel looked around the motel room in dismay. It may not have been as bad as Gabriel's description of typical motel fair, but it was pretty close. And it smelled weird, too.
'Gabriel? Why did you kill those people?' Sam asked.
’ Charlie said. ‘
‘No,’ Castiel replied. ‘Though I will admit I’m a bit disappointed about that.’ He smirked at the frown Dean gave him. He raised his brow curiously at the sigh he heard coming from the other end of the phone. He knew that sigh. It was the one Balthazar made when he was refraining from making a biting remark. Balthazar was making an effort to not offend him.
.-.-.-.-.
He went over what Gabriel had told him that Castiel liked. Sex and fish. He had already proven himself sex-wise. He was quite confident on that front. So what could he do about fish? Did Castiel really like to eat fish? Or was it just studying them? Would bringing Castiel a large fish work in his favor? That would be like proving his skills as a hunter. Would he want it alive, or…
‘Great. I’ll be back in an hour!’
Castiel. He refused to believe that he screwed up his brother’s life. He just hoped his brother would eventually see it that way.
a mermaid,’ he pointed out.
‘It was nice knowin’ ya,’ bro,’ Gabriel said as he held Castiel at arms’ length. ‘I regret to inform you that I won’t be able to make it to your funeral.’
articles! And they’re all stupid, ludicrous bullshit! And they’re all right! And Michael and Lucifer are in on the conspiracy!’
.-.-.-.-.
Gabriel sneered as he did what Anna asked. It annoyed him that she got away with ordering him around, but she had a good eye, and he didn’t want to risk losing her to another show. He exhaled quickly before giving a bright smile. ‘This is just the sort of weather that—’
Dean nodded as he got his feet back under him. ‘Yeah… Swimmin’s easier,’ he said as he stood up.
Castiel pressed himself into a corner and wiped the tears from his face. He shook his head as the demon was brought closer. ‘No…please don’t…’
Dean watched curiously as a short man in a doctor’s coat entered the room, pulling a small dart gun from his pocket. He narrowed his eyes as he recognized the slicked-back blond hair. ‘You’re not a doctor!’
‘My…’ Castiel spun around, blushing bright red and staring at Charlie with wide eyes. ‘You…you… How much did you see?’ he asked carefully. He didn’t feel particularly exposed or naked under Charlie’s gaze.
‘Sa-am…,’ Gabriel whined. ‘Gimme a few minutes, at least!’ he begged.
'You boys leave tomorrow.'
'Yeah. An angel can see my real face, and I can see an angel's wings,' she explained. 'Look, Sam, don't go after him. Just stay away. Everything in that area died. Painfully. The town was evacuated.' She gave a nervous laugh. 'Everyone I've talked to is being real careful. Angels, we can feel comin' from a good distance. We can get away. But this...this thing, there was no warning. That survivor, he said it felt almost like a demon. I was lucky. It happened the day after Dean found out about you using your powers. I could have been killed!'
Maybe he was tired, therefore his inhibitions lowered, or his critical thinking not quite at full power, but Cas reached over the table and placed a hand on Dean’s elbow. Dean looked up at him in shock, jumping slightly but quickly catching himself and making sure he didn’t disturb the still eating Jack. Once he was sure Jack hadn’t been spooked, he looked up again,
Cas was looking down at the floor, content to save his comments for later, not wanting to interrupt such a candid speech from Dean.
“I don’t think I can handle if this is a fake out, hell I don’t know if I can handle this if it actually is Cas.” Dean said with a bark of a laugh that sounded borderline hysteric. “I keep losing him, Sam.’’
“What do you mean?” Asked Jack.
“Dean-“
Dean slowly closes the door to his bedroom as quietly as possible. Jack slept on in his new bassinet they had acquired on their way back to the bunker. Dean smirked, remembering the image of the impala stuffed to the brim with new baby supplies. Of course, Dean had gone into the store with a survivalist state of mind; only the essentials. But then Dean had seen how small the newborn clothing and shoes were and almost immediately that mentality had been thrown out the window. Sam had snorted, announcing to Dean that he was “so predictable”, but Dean was unable to respond as he slowly picked up a onesie with a pretty looking script that read “Little Angel”. One look at Dean’s face and all the humor left Sam, before Dean knew it, he felt that telltale itch of tears build in his eyes. He loudly cleared his throat and threw the garment in their cart, quickly stalking off to car seats.
“Since when the hell did you get so smart?”
Dean nodded frantically at him, his breath stuttering on every inhale. Sam exaggerated his breathing so Dean could follow. In and out, in and out, they sat there breathing together until Dean’s distraught sobbing slowed and he was no longer gasping for air. Even after he had calmed significantly, it was clear to Sam that whatever the conversation on the phone had been was serious enough to force his brother to show his anxiety to him. So Sam waited, his hand still rubbing Dean’s back, in a show of affection that Dean had so often used on him when they were little. Finally, Dean spoke,
A tense smile spreads across Dean’s face,
“After all this time have you forgotten what I told you? Good things do happen, Dean. You will always be my good thing.”
Dean moved his hand to Cas’ shoulder, giving it a gentle squeeze,
Dean closed his eyes as he held Cas, he tucked his face a bit into Cas’ shoulder breathing him in. Something settled in his chest. When he pulled back, he allowed his hand to linger on Cas’ bicep, not wanting to relinquish their contact quite yet. Cas looked at him, searching his eyes,
Cas quietly entered the library with two glasses of water in hand. Dean pursed his lips and nodded at him in greeting. Cas responded in kind, setting the cups down on the coffee table where Dean almost unconsciously placed coasters underneath them. Both sat on opposite ends of the couch, unsure how to start,
Before Dean even finished his sentence, Cas’ deflated before him. His eyes fell to his lap and he started to withdraw his hand. This was the last thing Dean wanted so he grabbed that hand and with a leap of faith placed it on his own chest, right on his heart.
Dean was having a panic attack.
“And if this really is him, how much longer till I lose him again? How can I ever feel like he’s here to stay?”
Cas smiled a soft tired smile and followed along next to him. Dean quietly shushed Jack and bounced him lightly as they walked. Once in the kitchen Cas set about making a bottle for Jack while Dean sat at the table with his glass of water. Dean wiped Jack's tears from his face and ran his thumb over the baby’s cheek, while humming ’Hey Jude’ quietly to the infant. Slowly his cries lessened until he only blinked up at him owlishly. Cas sat down across from them and passed Dean the bottle across the table, he nodded a thanks to him and began to feed Jack.
Then it’s as if Cas has realized all that he has revealed and suddenly blushes feeling shy and exposed,
“Sure, you’ve done destructive things, you’ve been angry, and you’ve been traumatized but that doesn’t mean you’re broken! Everyone has anger and everyone has been destructive, but that’s not who you are. Dean, have you forgotten? I’ve held your soul in my hands, I have felt the unconditional and infinite love you contain. I’ve loved you from the moment I touched your soul in hell, I have never seen a soul as bright as yours. I was doomed from the start because Dean, everything you touch, everything you make and focus on, you love it so quickly and so fiercely, even if it’s undeserving.”
While Sam could hear their conversation, he couldn’t see that while he fake slept, Dean slowly and tentatively reached over and gently held Cas’ hand. Both of them smiling to themselves the rest of the drive.
“I don’t know what to say.”
Dean stood in front of a rustic wood cabin, still reeling from him and Sam’s discovery. He looked down to the sleeping bundle in his arms. Little Jack slept away, unaware of the tragedy he had been born into, small fist pressed gently to his chubby cheek. Dean however was experiencing a maelstrom of emotion, he’d lost Cas, again. How many times can someone watch their best friend die before it breaks them? Yet, he had no time to mourn, he and Sam had this new situation to think of. There was a squeeze deep in Dean’s chest as he stared at the baby, a tiny voice whispered hopeful and naive dreams Dean had thought he squashed long ago.
Sam chuckled in disbelief as he turned to Dean. Sam’s smile dropped as he took in his brothers' expression. Dean stood stock still, face paler than Sam has ever seen it. If he didn’t know better, he would think Dean was going into shock, “Dean?” Sam said quietly, at his name Dean jumped like he had been pinched. Meeting Sam’s eyes, he looked far younger and more unsure of himself than he had in years. Sam felt a familiar protectiveness sweep over him, he turned to look at Cas who was watching Dean with heartbreakingly hopeful and slightly terrified eyes. Sam cleared his throat and threw on a diplomatic smile, “Cas, I’m so glad you’re back. We’ll talk more tomorrow and fill you in on everything, I’m exhausted so I’m gonna head to bed.”
“I know that it’s hard for you not to blame yourself, you’ve been doing it our entire lives. Whether or not you had responded at all, The Empty would have taken Cas.”
“That’s part of being in love Dean, fear and love coexist. It’s terrifying to give yourself over to someone and abandon complete control and independence. But that’s the risk we have to take, we have to hand our heart over to someone else, knowing full well they could hurt us and we could hurt them.”
Once, jokingly, Dean had said that angels must be bird-like in more ways than just wings. Cas had insisted this wasn’t true, but every time Dean came to Cas’ room he knew there was more truth to his theory than he had originally believed. The room had all manner of decor, the desk was covered in stones, rocks, and other assorted knick knacks that Cas had found appealing. His bed was a veritable nest of blankets and pillows of all different colors, patterns, and textures. Dean’s attention was drawn to the bedside table which was uncharacteristically sparse, save for a single picture frame and a journal. In the frame was a picture of the so-called Team Freewill, Dean smiled at the photo while reaching for the journal. Hesitation gripped him as he held the small book in his hands, should he look inside? There was an emptiness within him emphasized by his burning desire to cling to anything Cas left behind, any small thing he could use to feel him again.
“Well come on, let’s go feed the little man.”
“He’s such a good sleeper already. Not like Sam was. Sam used to wake me up at all hours just screaming. It used to piss our dad off so bad, especially when he wouldn’t settle for anyone but me.”
“...Thank you. I love you, man.”
Dean was staring out the windshield, clearly trying to keep his breathing even and steady. He looked down with the ghost of an expression that looked suspiciously like shame. Sam knew where this was going before Dean even opened his mouth to reply,
“Cas-
Dean imagined it would hurt, getting the shit beat out of you by God himself, but he couldn’t bring himself to feel it. All his pain was masked by a scorching fury that set his skin aflame, it was this motherfucker who forced their hands; this son of a bitch that abandoned them as everyone else had. This cruel God took the one person who promised to always stay. Dean took each blow, each punch like a gift, divine retribution for all his mistakes, all his regrets. This was repentance, this was justice, this was his punishment and payment. His apology to Cas.
As he opened the journal another photo fell to the floor, having been tucked into the front cover, Dean looked down at it in confusion. He bent down to retrieve it and froze. There on the ground was a photo of Dean, mouth open in laughter, the skin around his eyes crinkled with smile lines. With a shaking hand, Dean picked up the photo, the edges were worn and there was some slight indentation from being bent, clearly it had been well loved by its owner. He turned the picture over, inspecting it further, and on the back in Cas’ classic chicken scratch were the words “My Dean”. All at once Dean felt everything, he felt the devastation of his loss, his deep and undeniable love, and an all consuming rage. He sank to the floor, knocked over by the overwhelming emotion, journal utterly forgotten, staring slightless at the words. Who knew it would only take two words to defeat Dean Winchester?
“I love you, I love you so much it used to terrify me.” Cas began,
“Hey Cas?”
“How long was I gone?”
“Cas, you’re right, I- that’s not me anymore. You’ve shown me I’m better than that destructive, angry kid.”
What he didn’t expect was the slight crinkle sound of paper when Cas’ hand finally made contact. Cas’ brows pinched in confusion and he reached into the flannel pocket pulling out the photo. His eyes went saucer-like when he connected the dots about the picture. Dean pulled the picture out of Cas’ now frozen hand, and once again placed his hand on his heart.
Dean started off into the distance as Sam worked on his hand, distantly he thought he could hear someone calling his name but couldn’t seem to hear them over his own screeching inner monologue. No one can be happy around you, the happiness you provide is temporary, Dean Winchester is unlovable.
Sam shook his head at his older brother, “Because Dean, Cas telling you was enough to make him happy.” He explained, “Why else would he have told you about the deal first? Cas telling you his real feelings made him the happiest he could have been. I don’t know how long he felt that way but saving you, loving you enough to sacrifice himself, that was the trigger, not you.”
Swallowing his own nervousness, Cas gently placed a hand on Dean’s forearm. Dean looked over at him and Cas sent him a small smile which Dean returned. Cas didn’t remove his hand as Dean leaned back on the couch,
The smile is gone and with it’s departure the clear anxiety returns,
Sam took a deep breath in and looked out the windshield,
Cas nodded silently, not taking his eyes off of Dean as Sam spoke. Sam released a slow breath through his nose and took one last look between the two of them. He quickly made his way to his bedroom and prayed to Jack that those two idiots would finally talk to each other.
Just like that the tension was back in full force. So many questions, so many thoughts, all unvoiced in hesitation. Dean took a deep breath,
Jack smiled small but pure to himself, “Yeah I think so.”
And he was glorious.
2 Weeks Later
“I thought I knew what love was, I thought I held love for my father and my siblings but… No, that was obligation. It was brainwashing. I was told that through my actions I would prove my love for heaven and our father and that I would need none in return because that is selfless and that is righteous love.”
“But, I can’t keep losing you. This time- it nearly killed me. I have lost so many people I love, Cas. You have to understand.”
“Please, Dean.”
“Love?”
“Cas, I – how are you here?”
The drive back to the bunker was...odd. Sam sat in the back observing his brother and their best friend. The tension was both overwhelming and yet not suffocating, Sam felt like a child unsure of what was happening between his parents. At one point, he decided he had enough of and feigned sleep, it was only then that Dean and Cas spoke to each other.
“I believe he is hungry, I was going to take him to get a bottle.” Cas explained in his sleep gruff voice.
All three men stared at each other, Sam looking between his brother and Cas, who seemed to be unable to look away from each other. Sam cleared his throat,
His mouth went dry at the sight in front of him, there stood Cas sans shirt, rocking some intense bed head with a very angry baby plastered to his chest. Dean wasn’t sure whether he should laugh or kiss him within an inch of his life. Instead he opted to reach out for Jack, and an appreciative Cas quickly handed him over,
“He’s back at the bunker, we called in Kevin to babysit.”
Dean wasn’t looking at Cas either, both finding other objects in the room to focus on.
“I like the way you think.”
Jack took a deep breath and looked around, taking in his environment with a new perspective, and nodded, “I can, I’ll bring everyone back.” He said with a smile “As for heaven, I’ll have to go for a little while. Have to clean up the mess my grandfather made. But permanently? I don’t know, I think Godlike figures have messed the world up enough. Maybe we should let the humans run the show this time around.”
