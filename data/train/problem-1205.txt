I blinked at him with surprise, before releasing a laugh at the teasing look on his face. “Of course not, Holmes. Why?”
tomorrow morning—condemned, reputation ruined, facing prosecution—terrified me more than the same fate had ever frightened myself.
Holmes essayed a small smile. “And as always, you flatter me. I will tell you all, then. You shall be gratified to know that your observation once we arrived was crack on the beam. In order to know where in the manor Smith was residing, to navigate the interior of the house, and to take the wisest footpath to the gate, one required an intimate, undeniable knowledge of the premises. More to the fact, the motive which so eluded our inspector Hopkins hinged on the killer entering Yoxley Old Place to commit murder.”
"Possibly, though I don't recall a ‘Fred’ among their legion. More likely it is an acquaintance of Wiggins—perhaps one who, for some reason, has been unable or unwilling to assist me in the work I've offered his compatriots."
“In these last few weeks, I have put the pieces together,” Holmes said. “I admit it took longer than it should have. Perhaps it was a blindness of proximity, the inability to see what was right in front of me for all its closeness. But did you truly believe you could conceal it from me?”
“I have been saving this particular ensemble for an occasion such as this, Watson." Holmes said, and his teeth were a perfect peal of white in their new mustached surroundings. “I am glad you approve.”
“Gentlemen,” said the young man. “I’m Station Master Bertram. I would be happy to help you but...” He hesitated, voice dipping with uncertainty. “My supervisor has not informed me about this. I do not know if...”
The policeman said, gawking below his helmet. The two medical men also stopped to stare, first at Holmes and then at me, but soon professionalism outweighed their awe as they assembled a cotton stretcher beside Holmes. With painful care, I assisted them as they coaxed Holmes onto it, who stirred with a quiet moan but did not wake.
“No one, my good sir,” Lestrade said loftily. “You’re just bloody sloppy.” The man looked apoplectic, and Lestrade gestured to a fellow officer. “Cuff him, and the rest. Call for a few buses.” He eyed me. “And another doctor.”
"I told you last night, Holmes. You are the greatest friend I have ever known." I lifted helpless hands and dropped them. "I have always thought so. It is inevitable that I would love you. You are..." A bashful lump formed in my throat. "You are extraordinary."
“We did not come all this way just to wait at the bar, John,” Holmes said coolly, and I barely restrained a jolt at the sound of my Christian name in that voice.
“My name is Sherlock Holmes, and this is my partner Doctor Watson. We are here on behalf of the police about the missing train.”
“Holmes,” I breathed. I reflexively reached out for him, but grasped only air. My friend did not take my outstretched hand. He just looked at me, features broken like a man upon the rack. “What’s happened? What’s wrong?”
Just as we vaulted through the back door, white hot fire lanced across the north of my shoulder. Gritting my teeth through the pain of it, I pressed myself to the wall once through and waited. Holding my breath, I counted the seconds and swiftly raised my arm. A man hurtled through and I swung downwards, tripping him at the ankles. He sprawled forward and Johann raced to kick away his pistol. I arched back and struck the next man through the door in the stomach with the heavy metal knob of my walking-stick. He wretched, collapsing to his knees. Without hesitation, I dashed his gun from his hand with another blow. The movement left me vulnerable, however, and I found myself freezing like prey at the sight of a barrel pointed precisely at my head.
“Later, Inspector,” I said, sharing a glance with Johann. “I'm afraid there is someone we must see to, first.”
I jerked my head up to see Hopkins staring horrorstruck at the scene—the Corams bloody and unconscious, and Watson waxen and limp in my arms.
“It’s time for our experiment, Watson,” Holmes interjected, steamrolling over me and taking me by the elbow. “And our laboratory awaits us in the repair room.”
Without much preening, I’m pleased to report there are a few stories that have gained particular notoriety among some circles—more notably, “A Scandal in Bohemia” and “the Redheaded League” (and, though I care not to recall its circumstances nor the state in which I wrote it, “the Final Problem”). As a result of my moderate success in spreading word of the genius residing within the mind of my dear friend, we have become accustomed to receiving odd telegrams, unexpected visitors, and strange letters with irregular frequency. Indeed, some of Holmes’s most fascinating cases have emerged wholly unexpected on our doorstep from out of the London grey. In November of ‘94, 221B Baker Street was receiving entreaties—written, typed, and in person—in such a number and kind that even Holmes, whose keen mind is so carnivorous for challenge that it wastes away in slightest inaction, was taken aback by the petitions which clamored for his attention.
not as it truly occurred. It is a risk to record it here now, in my most private of journals. But I crave relief and despise the frailty in my bones, and writing is the only cure I know for bad dreams that does not damn me to addiction. So nevertheless...I will write it down. If not to unravel the dark tangle of emotions lurking in my mind as I sit in bed, waiting for the morning sun to rise, then at least to finally grant these events the same treatment as my other adventures with Holmes. They deserve that, and more, for all their consequences have changed my life so utterly since.
Immediately, I saw that Professor Coram was not where we had left him. He was in his chair, still, but rather than by the window as before, he sat across the room near the one of his overflowing bookshelves, and he startled in his seat at our sudden entrance.
from last night. Any information you can give me about misconduct, or those involved, could be highly useful. Can you recall anything more specific about this fortunate group?”
“Remarkable, Holmes,” I said wonderingly. “...It truly is a plot, as you said. I can’t imagine someone constructing something like this on a whim—and it certainly couldn’t be done alone!”
” she said, and there was a knowing to her that made her seem years older than she was. “And there are things that are much worse than death. Your prisons are nothing. Your punishments are nothing. Your friend is nothing, because my husband and I have faced the entire world and survived.”
“The ladies were all too happy to tell me about Peter Ables, my dear fellow, once I expressed interest in their makeup techniques. And I was more than happy to be their model and learn them, provided they tell me all they knew.”
“Because you’re an overzealous, if well-intentioned, physician who frets without need and recommends complete boredom as a medical treatment.”
Holmes’s impatience slid more visibly into annoyance, and I squinted at the young master, recognizing bluster when I saw it.
I rolled my eyes once more at Thomas’s unabashed phraseology. “I have been busy, Thomas,” I said defensively. “I never intended to be away for so long, but I have been longing for a night out for some time.”
I did not have the opportunity to finish my defense. Holmes, faster than I could blink, had taken my face in his blood-dappled hands and crushed his mouth to mine.
To my relief, my physician was easily swayed to release me on my own recognizance into Holmes’s care the following morning. I doubt I could have been convinced to remain in the damn place even one more night—it is true that doctors make the worst patients on this earth—but it would have done me no discernible good to sleep off bruises and strained muscles in a hospital rather than the comfort of my own home.
“Like most readers, I know that all too well,” he said, his smile taking a rather winning glint, and I chuckled at the flattery. Feeling a small flutter of interest, I weighed the wisdom of making pleasant conversation over questioning other patrons about our young client’s brother. It had been a terribly long time since I had engaged in this dance, and I found I had missed the exchange and confidence it inspired in me with equal measure. “You’re a rather infamous member here, even considering the Circle’s more...high-level clients. I hope you’re not opposed to entertaining a fan for a few moments, if you have them? I saw that you were alone, and thought at least I could offer you my company.”
"You married," Holmes said quietly, almost as if to himself but for the way his gaze held mine. "I am not mistaken in that. You loved Mary Morstan."
“I do not like the ceaseless letters, Holmes, because they annoy you, and when you are annoyed, you become a ridiculous child.” Holmes opened his mouth to speak, but I steamed directly over him. “I did not like fannish clients, because they are more interested in flashing their bosoms than hiring you for a case, and in their presence, I become unfairly jealous. And while I
The inspector and I followed Holmes's brisk foray up the stairs, trailing behind the maid. The second floor mirrored the first, a long hallway on either side of the staircase with rooms lining north and south. Holmes halted as we stepped into the east hallway, canting his head left and right down the hallway.
"I assure you that I am, to most," clipped Holmes. "To all but my brother in some occasions...and in others, it seems, to you. But that is not the point. You
“We weren’t certain ourselves until last night,” I said. “We were asked to investigate by Peter’s younger brother only yesterday.”
“I’ve got the facts pretty clear. All I want now is to know what they all mean. The story, so far as I can make it out, is like this—some years ago this country house, Yoxley Old Place, was bought by an elderly man, a retired professor by the name Nicholas Coram. He's an invalid, keeps to his bed half the time, and the other half he moves about the house with a wheeled chair or he's pushed about by his gardener. He was well liked by the few neighbors who called upon him, and has the reputation of being a very learned man. His household used to consist of an elderly housekeeper, Mrs. Marker, and of a maid, one Susan Tartlon. They’ve both been with him since his arrival three years back, and they seem to be women of excellent character. The Professor, he’s writing a learned book, and he found it necessary about six months ago to engage a secretary. The first two were not successes, but the third, a Mr. Willoughby Smith, applied and was hired in September. He was a young man straight from university, and seemed to have been just what his employer wanted.”
“You are right,” she cried, eyes wild. She was pale and thin, a wraith in a red velvet dress, her black hair piled in a perfect braided crown upon her head. “You are right,
It was in the winter of ‘94, I believe, that the popularity of my stories about Sherlock Holmes reached its zenith.
Blushing, I buried a bashful chuckle in a cough as we left the privacy of Holmes’s bedroom. “What is it, Mrs. Hudson?”
“I understand,” I said warily. “…I could get us both in. I’ve been a member for years. The club is predicated on a circle of trust—we are permitted to introduce friends, but only if they intend to become members themselves.”
“You may be right about that,” the lad muttered. “Not to spread gossip, sir, but I’ve heard things about the Chesterfield station master. Several complaints from management about needing to follow regulations more strictly, as I’ve tried to do—and I think he’s the reason for their concern.”
It is true that in the time since I first published, public following of my humble narrations has oscillated depending on any number of factors. Certain elements of drama, political events abroad, and even the turning of the seasons all pose impact on the vogue of my issues in the
Chesterfield was the smallest of all the modest towns along the line we had seen so far, and its station—though identical to its sisters in nearly every respect—was dark and quiet when we arrived. The sun outside had vanished behind mounting nimbus clouds, a curtain of darkness rolling across the placid English plains, and inside I could not help but notice how unwelcoming the place felt in comparison to its neighbors along the London route. Its hearth was middling, unattended, and the cool temperature from outside leaked into its walls to drape a low, unpleasant sort of chill around us as we approached the ticket counter in the empty hall.
“Never in my life have I seen such a look of fright cross your face as when you looked at that ring,” Holmes said. His voice was low and cautious, as though weary of upsetting me merely by broaching the subject. “And the manner in which you look at me now unsettles me a great deal. Pray, my friend, tell me what has disturbed you so.”
“Is that all?” I asked dryly. “You need only narrow down a list of buildings across London that are impossible to look into, sneak in unseen, free Peter, fight off any gangsters, and emerge unscathed before the police arrive. How perfectly simple.”
“The Corams. I want to know everything. But first, I have to ask—how on earth did you catch up to us?”
At a loss, I could only shrug my shoulders and sit in my burning curiosity for the long ride home, arms crossed tightly against my chest as our knees knocked together. For the entire journey, memories of our night in the Circle swirled in my head, a cauldron of hot feelings and growing self-recrimination. What I required was a night alone in my room and a tub of ice water, not space to think with my legs brushing against my friend's and Thomas's parting tease muddling my brains. When we finally arrived home, I clambered out of the carriage faster than a man with motion sickness.
Holmes lifted an eyebrow, turning to me precisely as I glanced to him, and I practically glowed within at the approval I found in his gaze.
“The country air is one thing, Holmes,” I said, taking his arm and guiding us swiftly towards the main road. “But a country storm is quite another.”
“I will do my best,” said Holmes, folding his hands together. “But for the sake of those aboard, I will not waste time, Mr. Everett. I believe you can be of help to us, as well.”
“You are searching for a woman of good address,” said Holmes smoothly. “Attired like a lady. She has a remarkably thick nose, with eyes which are set close upon either side of it. She has a puckered forehead, a peering expression, and probably rounded shoulders. There are indications that she has had recourse to an optician at least twice during the last few months. As her glasses are of remarkable strength and as opticians are not very numerous, there should be no difficulty in tracing her.”
“I thought you wanted to leave,” Holmes whispered. The words hit me like a mortar shell, reverberating shock down my spine. “I believed it. Contrived every piece of evidence I observed to support it. And then, to shield myself, I decided to confront you, with deliberate unkindness, because I had deluded myself into believing it was safer for you to go. That it would be less painful for us both, if you left in anger, rather than with regret. It was selfish and illogical and I—” His voice snapped, buckling under strain, and his eyes glimmered with emotion. “It seems even with the best of intentions, I manage to cause you pain.”
“It appears the rumors Master Bertram mentioned underserved the issue,” I said disparagingly. Leaning as close as I could stomach, I cleared my throat by the man’s ear. When this failed to rouse him, I sighed and prodded his shoulder. The master harrumphed, his guttural snores stuttering, but did not arise from deep, liquor-induced slumber.
"SCOTLAND YARD!" A familiar voice javelined through the open door. Every hand drew up a pistol. "YOU'RE SURROUNDED, GENTLEMEN! DROP YOUR WEAPONS! COME OUT WITH YOUR HANDS UP!"
“I am not surprised,” I said. I swallowed hard. “It is an invert club, Holmes. A bar for homosexuals.”
“Nothing out of the ordinary, then?” Holmes interrupted, voice curt, and I found myself frowning at his rudeness. My friend could be so very testy when people wasted his time with irrelevant details, but he knew better than to interrupt a young lady. (In retrospect, I’m the fool for believing it. It is true that I love a genius, but occasionally, I also love a boor.)
Holmes peered inwards through the bars, mouth pressed in a line. “I see no master,” he observed. “Negligent, perhaps?”
I had been unable to sleep the night before. The interaction between Holmes and myself played over and over again in my mind without fail, painting itself on my closed eyelids. I could not forget how rattled my friend had been. The guilt in his eyes, the regret in his slumped shoulders haunted me. His parting words dogged me most of all, twisting my stomach into a Gordian knot.
To the shadowed expression on my friend’s face as he followed the probing of my fingers, I found I had little to say that I had not already. It was not his fault. The man who’d put them there was in chains. I was alive.
Holmes lifted an eyebrow. “I presume it was you who placed the order for the ‘special’ wagon, Mr. Robinson?”
to try waging some sort of vendetta against whatever remained of Moriarty’s people in-country, let alone the capability. I was fooling myself. I was grieving. I needed sleep—
The station master lifted up his voice in a bellow to confirm the herald of my relief. “Attention! The train is arriving at the station! Please stand well away from the platform edge!” The shriek of a whistle broke the air, shrill and long.
Seven o’clock came too quickly, and by the chime of the mantle clock I was a mess of nerves. I had begun to fret over grim possibilities we might face tonight: first and foremost, arrest, and increasingly upsetting, the idea of Holmes lambasted in the press for charges of sodomy. I had nearly managed to convince myself to talk Holmes out of his idea—or more impulsively, leave for the Circle without him so he could have no means of entering and putting himself at risk—when Holmes’s bedroom door opened, and my train of thought collided with a brick wall.
Holmes smiled coolly. “I am a connoisseur,” said he, taking yet another cigarette from the man’s proffered case. “I will not trouble you with any lengthy cross-examination, Professor Coram, since I gather that you were in bed at the time of the crime and could know nothing about it, correct?”
My eyebrows lifted despite myself. Holmes created deserts of ash in our apartment with much less consideration to our dear Mrs. Hudson every week; as astute as my dear friend was, his courtesy to his environment often left much to be desired.
I swallowed thickly. “I—I had wanted...” I trailed off with a faint, forced smile, feeling foolish for the distant creeping of warmth in the corners of my eyes. I blinked rapidly, willing them away. “I had wanted to walk you home. I made to catch up with you on the way to Baker Street.”
a man, with the fullest and tenderest capacity of my heart, before I loved Sherlock Holmes. I daresay I am unlikely to care so profoundly for another in the future.
Please let me know your thoughts if you liked the story, or hit me up @apprenticeofdoyle on tumblr, i'd love to hear from you. happy holmestice month, and be safe and well.
“In a box that was Mum’s. Peter keeps money in it and some letters, but I cannae read ‘em. And I can read and write proper good! Peter taught me how! But they’re all wrong, the words are all mixed together.”
I could not help but chuckle, disproportionately charmed by the expression of jealousy. It was lighter and sweeter than the feeling that Holmes’s behavior at the club inspired. “A common reaction, my dear Holmes. I will refrain, then, for your sake.” Holmes narrowed his eyes at me, and I smiled. Slowly, my mirth transmitted to him from across the room, softening his handsome features with a gentleness that made my chest flutter.
Holmes weaved his fingers together. “Observing the scene of the crime, it was clear that his death was not accidental. But premeditation challenged me, laid against the murder weapon. I could not fathom why a killer would make a move on their victim without a prepared weapon on their person beforehand. Even someone who had been familiar with the estate would not have relied upon finding a knife such as the one in the study to do the deed, it would have been too risky.”
The two of us left Mrs. Marker and quickly left for the manor. We made up the stairs in short order and stopped right at the door, Holmes turning to capture my gaze.
“I saw that you hung the Order of the Legion of Honor certificate,” he said, amused. Precise fingers went up to his fringe to push back the hair from his face.
I was guided to my study with careful hands. I avoided the sight of Johann and Peter, locked in passionate embrace, as Holmes tenderly helped me out of my ruined jacket and prepared a bowl of water and clean bandages.
“I see,” I said, and not for the last time that night, I summoned my courage. My eyes returned to his, engaging their attention unwaveringly. “Do you want to know it?”
Holmes was silent. He looked at me as if he had never seen me before. My heart was eclipsed with misery.
"Let me finish," Holmes pleaded. "Let me finish it all and then judge me for my actions. I never wanted—would never seek to cause you pain, Watson. Grant me the chance to explain myself, before damning me completely."
My stomach lurched, as though I had been pitched bodily from a great height. “What?” I said, voice caught in a whisper.
Mrs. Coram. She was frightened, Holmes, but not of us. Frightened of being caught, and willing to die before it could happen.”
"I will see you soon, Holmes," I said firmly, tucking my revolver into my belt and straightening my coat.
"I would have seen it," Holmes murmured. He looked at me like he had never truly seen me before. "I would have..."
The blood drained from my face. “Good God. But he will. You believe they have taken Peter to force Johann to agree.”
He smiled, finally, in earnest. And after such a rare display of his consideration for me, more proof than I ever needed that I held a place in his affection, I believed I could identify fondness, too, in the curve of his mouth.
“Panic can be a useful distraction, if manipulated carefully. I am confident word will spread that the police are out for blood.” Holmes flashed white teeth. “If not, I will be happy to hasten the message. In disguise, of course.”
I saw the metal of Hopkins’s revolver poking from the side of his belt. I lunged. Coram's face twisted in hatred, seeing my goal and attempting to beat me to it. I knocked his arm aside with one hand and the other darted forward, fingers sliding around the pistol grip.
“I take it I’m to inquire about this fine town’s lodgings, then?” I asked fondly, and his eyes glimmered with a delight that reflected affection into my own chest.
Mr. Everett shook his head from where he sat behind his desk, a cup of hot tea in hand. “All I know, sir, is that it was a highly secure car, ordered by a private party. They're generally to carry items of value, like luxury cargo. Those wagons have iron walls, you know, without any windows, and they are fitted with a complex key lock. But if you finger it for the reasons behind this mess, Mr. Holmes..." He tapped his hand on the desk. "I never heard of anyone getting into one that wasn’t supposed to, not in all my years as a station master.”
“We shall have ample time for ourselves on this trip, Holmes,” I said gently, taking the hesitant observation for the apology it was. “But your health is my primary concern.”
“Holmes, that man’s as drunk as a lord,” I said, shaking my head. “That train might have never come through Chesterfield at all and we’d hardly be the wiser.”
Eyes followed the two of us in, appraising. The odd twisting in my gut that had begun wounding at Baker Street snarled tighter at their attention as their lingering attention followed Holmes at my side.
” said he, and I winced. “But I have indeed failed egregiously, Watson, if you consider me so low as to dismiss years of our friendship for something so
All too willing, I slumped limply back to rest, releasing his hand. I sighed as my muscles sank into the mattress, bone-weary, and focused my gaze on the darkened window across the room.
I opened my eyes to see Holmes smirking at me, somehow closer than he was moments before. He looked, as always, singularly handsome, his statuesque nobility sharpened in the firelight to fine, hewn panes. He was of uncommon and strange beauty: too sharp and too thin, with a rapier smile and deadly intellect to match.
have passed. There’s simply no other way off the premises, the brick border wall of the property is tall, mortared brick and beyond scaling, especially in stormy weather—and it could only have been the murderer, since neither the gardener nor anyone else had been there that morning and the rain had only begun during the night.”
“Until then,” I said, with low affection. With that, Holmes dipped his chin, mouth twitching upwards at a rogue corner, and set off at a brisk pace towards the main road. I watched his lengthy strides for a moment, admiring not for the first time the determined, fluid march of his legs as he went. Finally I sighed, forcing myself to confront the rest of my own evening. Though Simpson’s was within walking distance of Baker Street, I hadn’t the mettle to trek all the way to the clinic if I wanted energy to spare for the paperwork waiting for me on my desk. And I wanted to finish it quickly too: I had two consultations and a full surgery tomorrow with another attending in the morning to perform my first appendectomy. I would need all the rest I could acquire between now, paperwork, and what precious minutes I could steal with Holmes before collapse once I made it to our flat.
“Your...friend, young Farrow. He said it had been months.” Holmes inclined his head, voice sleek and curious. “Why did you stop? Certainly not for lack of friends... atmosphere...” His mouth twitched. “Or pursuit.”
Eventually, encouraged by the pointed drop of the check, we were stirred to end our meal. As we left, I expressed my regret that I could not join him on his sojourn home.
Seething, I found the mechanism in the dark and seized it, twisting hidden cogs. Finally, finally, an entire minute after the shot that had rattled apart my adamantine control, the screech of giving metal gave way to sunlight and escape. I bolted from the room to the window. The sight of the carriage galloping down the road with Watson inside was bottled fear and lightning, paralyzing me for a fraction of a moment before I sprinted headlong for the stairs. Hopkins barreled after me through the front door.
“Hello?” I called, my voice echoing in the hollow space, and Holmes and I exchanged glances. Humming in thought, my friend abandoned the ticket booth and paced towards the station master’s office door. Reaching for it, he gave its golden knob a tentative twist, and lifted a slow eyebrow when it opened.
"We won't damage your little plaything, Mr. Larssen," the man sneered. "He is in good company. Safe as houses—"
Holmes lifted a dark eyebrow. “And the only to know that besides us are behind bars, prevailing upon my physician’s discretion.”
“It seems I must rectify this error,” Holmes continued, barreling through my protest like a steam engine. The frustration in his voice had dissolved into something less heated, but equally determined. “I am not angry. Disappointed, perhaps, in myself for being so incredibly unobservant about a man with which I have shared lodgings, who I believed to know to the very habit—” Again, I winced, “—but that lack of attention is my deficit, not yours.”
“It is possible,” Holmes allowed. “However, as Ms. Tarlton so helpfully explained, the storm was so loud last night she almost mistook Mr. Smith’s shout for the wind, and did not head downstairs herself until
I did not wish to hear anything close to goodbyes or worst-case scenarios. They would only distract my focus when I needed it most.
Shifting my jaw, I made haste, my walking-stick clacking the stones, which was why as I rounded the corner past the Pit Stalls Gallery, I did not immediately catch the harsh, resounding crack of wood against wood. But then sharp echoes bounced off the high brick building, reverberating in my ears. Curious, I drew to a halt at the corner as I looked around for the source of it.
“Thank you,” Holmes said tonelessly, and spinning on a heel, he left the man and I followed him further into the waiting hall.
hearing the shattering of the window.” His head turned towards me, and I bit back a grin as my friend’s eyes practically danced with anticipation. A proper case, indeed. “But more’s the point, gentlemen, this murderer was bold enough to enter through the back door, enter the study, pilfer the murder weapon from the Professor’s desk,
"Negotiations can be awful fluid," said the lieutenant, voice like an oil slick. "But rest assured, we will see to our end of the bargain." He lifted a dark brow. "And I needn't tell you what will happen if you don't see to yours."
Holmes meaningfully inclined his head towards me, and I recognized such an entreaty with amusement; my modelling skills were needed. Pleased as always to act under his direction, I allowed him to deliver me into the chair and sat down, bending over the desk as any studious young man would. Holmes hummed his thanks and swung behind me, and I swallowed as I felt his hands lightly hover over my shoulders.
“I took them by surprise." I felt my face harden at the memory of their twisted faces, the gut-wrenching eddies of panic and rage. I closed my eyes at the red vividness of blood which flashed in my mind, weeping from my knuckles, trailing from Holmes’s mouth.
With a reluctance that bled from their very limbs, both Holmes and Hopkins backed into the bookshelf doorway.
I made to stand and help the lad with his coat, but Holmes rose faster than I, a hand patting my shoulder just once as he passed me to take the man’s jacket and hang it on the rack.
I watched as Holmes flushed a mottled scarlet. “I…Yes. But I do not know my own limits.” The confession clearly was a source of embarrassment and deep underlying frustration. “I never experienced the desire to…touch another person, before you. I cannot tolerate the touch of others as it is. But over time, I have become accustomed to your occasional tactility, and I…do not dislike it.”
“Watson,” he rasped. His hand tightened over mine with a fraction of the strength I knew him capable of, but it comforted me all the same. I released a sigh that had been locked inside of me since the moment I saw him lying unmoving in the street.
“Yes,” the Professor said wearily. At once, his countenance looked quite drained. “It was such a stormy night, and I have been a hard sleeper all my life. I slept through it all until I heard that shout, and even then, I’d doubted I had heard it at all.”
Mycroft lifted a whiskery white brow at me, his Holmes-grey gaze digging into me almost as if evaluating my very center. In the corner of my eye, I could see Holmes looking at me, attention fixed on my face with a faint expression that I could only call smug.
“A pleasure,” Thomas said, shaking Holmes’s gloved hand with aplomb. “Always a treat to see new faces round here. You’ll have to keep a watch on this one, old boy, you know how this crowd takes to fresh blood.” Thomas gave Holmes an appraising, playful look. “Especially when they’re as dapper as your friend here.”
“He will catch you. Both of you will go to the noose for what you did to Smith. Surrender now, while you still can, and you and your husband might be given clemency.”
Holmes’s squadron of children had delivered their report sometime in the early morning while I slept, and we had likewise received a telegram from Johann agreeing to meet me in Holmes’s choice of location. Somehow, he had been convinced to agree with Holmes’s plan, after Holmes had confessed his identity and interest in rescuing Peter along with all he had discovered about their plight.
“Tools?” The man blinked rapidly before flushing a disconcerting magenta. “Oh! The tools, yes! I’d almost forgotten about them, I need to clean those off and put them back in the work shed.” He shook his head like an old spaniel. “Might be easier just to leave ‘em outside. Smells like rain, it does.” Almost on cue, the distant crackle of thunder met my ears, rumbling lowly over our heads.
“The ticket inspector made all the other passengers get off the train, you say?” I repeated, stunned. “The cars of the missing train were empty?”
Holmes does not respond to that. Instead, his gaze solemnly tracks the surface of my skin, and heat blooms in my cheeks.
I ripped it back, cocked the hammer, and aimed. Coram's expression dissolved into terror. Without hesitation, I fired one round each into both of his legs.
“As always, Holmes,” I said, quiet affection replacing all other emotion in my voice, and he dropped my hands. Instantly, they felt colder, but within my chest, his touch had constructed a bonfire that would sustain me in the meantime.
Holmes’s face twitched, but otherwise, he said nothing. I had heard similar crude talk before in London, and I had little tolerance for it. I opened my mouth to say as much, but Holmes cut me a sharp glance.
“An excellent question, my dear.” Holmes looked up at me, eyes twinkling, and my heart thumped with familiar attraction at the sight of his approving silver gaze on mine. “I believe you and I are well up to the task of getting some answers out of him." A cunning minor curl stretched his mouth, and my chest tightened as my desire to return to the inn intensified with a new design.
Hopkins took a moment to sip on his tea, and I watched him with mind whirring, playing the scene he had just described to me in my mind. Stabbed in the neck by a sudden intruder, in the late, stormy hours of the night. A grim fate for anyone, let alone a young man and guest in another’s home.
In my anguish, I barely noticed the faint emotion coming loose in Holmes’s expression, flickering strain. As it was, I could not speak, and could only watch, slipping into despair, as Holmes continued, his voice only just unraveling at its aloof, dull edges.
Holmes abruptly stood, casting towards the fireplace in the direction of his tobacco slipper. “Has your brother any other engagements, Fred? A fiancée, perhaps? Or any friends, that might have kept him?”
The wretched man paled, his ruddy expression draining to a sickly pallor. “Awright, awright!” he cried, folding in on himself. “So I was drunk! But it don’t change nothing, you hear! The train came and I sent the message, that’s it!” He twisted his wedding ring fitfully, looking distressed. “Go easy on me, eh? I’ve been workin’ here for years now, this job is all I got for the family.”
Parting through the sea of armed guard, a final man entered the room. His walk was leisurely, a confident amble with his hands tucked in his pockets. His cap was akimbo on a mass of dirty black hair, and his mouth was stretched into a smile that chilled my stomach. This was their lieutenant, no doubt. The rank and file waited expectantly for him: their leader in direction and arrogance both, it seemed.
“We wait with bated breath, sir,” Coram said, white-knuckled hands fisting in his blanket. “When did you solve it? In the garden?”
“To think I considered Mrs. Hudson omniscient in my sleeping patterns to now,” I quipped, and a cloudy grey eye turned my direction.
Helping the man back into his slicker, Holmes closed the door behind him and turned swiftly on a heel.
“The first show is about to start,” Johann said. He pushed our two glasses towards us, the corner of his lip curling in a subtle smile. "I hope you gentlemen enjoy the show." At that, he drifted away to assist another customer.
Overcome with fondness, I stretch my hand across the sheets to find his. I entwine his cold fingers with mine, my heart overfull.
“We shall go back to Evesham, then,” I said, sighing with no little amusement. “But then we shall rest, Holmes.” I found my eyes tugging towards the sky, my lips pressing together. “I do not like the look of the storm brewing.”
Watson," Holmes snaps, disapproval hardening his features. "If I am not permitted the blame for your nightmares, then neither should you be."
if he and his officers would be so obliged as to follow my instructions. To the letter, God willing.” Though he crackled with indomitable energy, the worry in his eyes as he looked at me tugged at my abdomen, and I swallowed the same fear with soldierly effort. In all our cases, the two of us had never gone into danger without the other before. I prayed that things would go precisely to Holmes's plan.
I said, blushing furiously, and Holmes released a devilish little chuckle that did little to reduce my mortification. Moving to my feet with legs that were more unsteady than they should have been after only two glasses of wine, I dug into my pockets to leave money on the bar, and as I was doing so, Holmes hooked his arm around mine.
I frowned through my headache, squinting in memory. Heaven knew where my notebook disappeared to; it was probably ruined at the bottom of some damnable creek in Chatham. “Two wings. The ground floor...the kitchen was along the back. The Professor’s study, Smith’s guest room, and the sitting room were on the east side, and the west side was being renovated. The upper floor...the west wing was all guest rooms, and the east...Ms. Tarlton’s room, and the Professor’s. Holmes, I remember you examining the upper floor but I don’t—”
Her dark eyes twinkled and my gut twisted as a dusty, unkind laugh slipped from her lips. The carriage around us lurched as, with a shout, Coram whipped the horses and sent us hurtling towards the main road.
“Gone, down to the brass tacks,” I said, shaking my head. Where a small building clearly used to stand behind the gate was a foundation's bare skeleton, barely fifty square meters, with spare, ancient wooden beams pried from the earth were all that remained on a patch of wet earth.
” His voice was a sharp knife in a shaking hand. “I did not. I- I dragged you from the brook, but—” Words cut off, were reformed rattled and low. “You would not
I pause in my ministrations above him, halfway having insinuated my hands beneath his sleepshirt in search of more skin. I lift an inquiring eyebrow, and his smile transforms into something altogether devilish.
The prospect of tea and breakfast was of minor comfort and better distraction, and I followed Holmes’s directive to sit, rubbing gentle circles into my upper quadriceps.
"Oh?" I said, and could not suppress my smile. I had never been told that with such a determined expression before.
“As you say, gov,” Wiggins said, and as he started off, I cleared my throat. He turned to see me with my hand extended, plate of scones balanced on my palm.
“I shall sort through this morning’s missives for something more engaging, then. But perhaps you should take the opportunity to recuperate. Do you know if there are any performances in town this evening? We’ve not had the chance to attend one in quite a while.”
“And I’m certain your parents are very proud,” Holmes said dismissively. “Listen here, young man, I am aware that you wish to protect yourself behind all these regulations...but myself and the doctor, we represent the
Mr. Holmes, that’s what bothers me. I can't put my hand on the why. Here’s a man dead—no denying that—but so far as I can see, no reason on earth why anyone should wish him harm.”
However happy I was he could join me, the sight of him as he first sat down at our table had filled me with no little concern. While Holmes tended towards the ivory side of pale, tonight he looked practically colorless. His energy, usually electric when his brilliant mind was turned onto a problem, was muted and strained; heavy lines had made themselves prominent beneath dark circles that seemed more pronounced than usual.
“Watson.”  The amorous tint of his grey eyes faded into more solemn tones. “I saw you in the waiting hall near the fire. As an ardent student in the full range of your facial expressions, I can recognize when you're in pain. You will let me know, should we go beyond your limits today.”
“When I was abroad in the Continent…" Holmes hesitated. "I missed your companionship. More dearly than I imagined I would.”
“I agree,” Holmes said. “I think we could benefit from a search about the premises. There was something…off about the station master’s office, Watson…”
"The flask in your pocket and orgy of empty bottles strung about this station tell a different story, sir,” Holmes said cuttingly. “Tell the truth now, or I shall not hesitate to document your pitiful state in our report.”
A considering beat, and Holmes said, “A capital idea, Watson.” His eyes were bright at the suggestion indeed, and I leaned back in surprise. He was not often so amenable to suggestions we turn from the Work when it was lacking, but perhaps for once he missed music more than the game. “A travelling string group from Prague will be performing Dvořák this weekend, and I should very much like to see it. How does that strike you?”
We arrived at Chesterfield Station a half hour after lunch, a respectable spot of meat and cheese with tea at a small, charming baker’s shoppe nearby. Holmes was persuaded to eat a handful of crackers with gruyere and salted pork, sulking the entire while, until he all but dragged me out by the collar to return to the work.
I was digging my way through the new post with bored bad-temper, feeling somewhat sorry for myself, when my eyes tripped over a familiar name amidst the ocean of letters and telegrams. Fixed squarely in the upper-left corner in prim writing was a return sender address that ripped the rug out from beneath me.
certainly, on how I should hone my stories more precisely on the cool delivery of facts—the “severe and deliberate” techniques of logical deduction—but I fancy in my heart of hearts that Holmes, though he could care less for the fame of it all, is satisfied with my transcriptions of our work together. Not with their accuracy, as I am no doubt incapable of replicating his observations to the man’s own standards, but rather for how the craft so occupies myself in the days and weeks between cases. I believe that Holmes recognizes the happiness that penning our time together grants in me, even in his lowest fits of melancholy. In the least, he has found amusement in my mutterings and exclamations—even laughter, in my infrequent, brooding struggles to find the proper words to describe him, our cases, and his inimitable derivations. (He does not realize, in the slightest, how often he escapes my abilities of description.)
“Nothing but the murder of Caesar,” I said, grinning at my friend’s zeal. “A shame Brutus wasn’t a craftier devil. At any rate, I’m glad to put off another stack of post for a proper case.”
“The time for a soft hand has passed, I believe,” Holmes said, somewhat amused, and tilted his head meaningfully.
The figure on the stage was dressed in a daring, starlit navy gown, with smooth lines and a silhouette that clung to every curve. Sweeping petal rouge defined delicate, round cheekbones, and their hair hung in smooth, ebony ringlets that shimmered in the low gas light. Their dark eyes were small and thin, accentuated by striking kohl similar to Holmes’s, and their powdered brown skin seemed to glow in the hazy corona of gaslight and tobacco smoke.
I crushed the pipe close, a sob clogging my throat. I wanted to fall down and weep. I wanted to kick a chair and rage. I wanted to scream at Holmes, scream myself hoarse,
“You have no choice,” Holmes said. “But perhaps, if you explain your motives, you need not die there. You need not die
“My god,” I said again. Not just murderers, but terrorists, wanted in Russia. No wonder she had scoffed at the idea of our prison system. I knew little of that part of the world, but rumors of Russian gaols did not so easily leave the mind. “They...
“Some water, my dear fellow?” he asked gently, and I nodded gratefully, privately touched by his consideration. In moments, a glass was in my hand, passed to me by thin fingers. I swallowed the liquid, graceless and wincing, and I noticed Holmes’s gaze, tracking my throat.
“It’s—it’s my brother, sir,” Fred said. “He’s in trouble. I ain’t seen him in two days, sir, and he’d never not come ‘ome without tellin’ me where he went off to.”
I stared at him, and then immediately burst out laughing. It hurt something awful but I could not stop, and through my wheezing I heard him dissolve into boyish, deviant giggling.
after a certain time. There is every possibility that negotiations will fall through, that the Yard could miscalculate their timing, or that word of raids could reach the ears of these gang members too early. Johann will need your protection, and your service revolver.” Holmes met my gaze, expression serious. “I do not relish the idea of sending you alone into peril either, but we have little choice. Not if we wish to rescue Peter Ables with the least amount of risk possible.”
“A tremendous outstanding bar tab, my dear Captain. By this point, I’d characterize myself as a business investment.”
"I confess this introspection did not begin with this case," Holmes muttered, his eyes trained on the Indian rug. My mouth fell open. "I thought merely that now would be an opportune time to test my hypothesis, given certain... circumstances. The environmental stimuli was as inspirational as it was ideal."
Perhaps it was pride that drew me to think so, but I fancied, maybe, that Holmes would not mind if I kept them. Part of me wanted to keep everything myself, hoard his belongings away from the fingers of others who had not known or understood the man they’d belonged to. If Mycroft asked, I could not deny blood ties, but no, no one else. I would be selfish with Holmes’s things now, even if I’d been too cowardly in his lifetime to be selfish
,” I read aloud, voice low around the words of a dead man. It felt as if I were reading a penny dreadful, or a ghost story. “
“No? If not in that, perhaps they share blame in the disaster of yesterday,” Holmes said, voice cutting across me like a thin blade. “After all, how was it that Coram knew to relieve you of your service pistol? It was not
Sympathy welled in my chest like an icy spring. “Have faith in Sherlock Holmes, Johann,” I said, coming close to clap a hand on his shoulder. “We have a plan to save Peter and rid yourself of the Threadcaps. For good.”
The man’s animosity visibly ebbed, his pale brown eyes flickering with surprise and apprehension. “The police? You’re investigating the missing train?” His bearded mouth pressed together. “Fine. What do you want of me? I have nothing to hide!”
The front hall was already well-populated with regulars, despite the early hour, and I recognized a few faces: not only from having seen them before but from newspapers as well. Judges, secretaries, and government men were a common sight here, and Holmes would no doubt recognize them immediately.
“A midnight murder, Watson!” he exclaimed, alive with sudden, crackling energy. “A locked estate, lost tracks, and a mysterious bespectacled woman at the scene of it. What in Ancient Rome could compare?”
“For all your nannying over my health, you neglect your own so easily,” he said, and I found myself flushing at the combination of his arch gaze and gentle motions as he warmed my icy hands.
“I welcome the challenge, my dear fellow,” Holmes says, grinning ear to ear, and this time, it is he who kisses me.
“I would say so. How did the other raids go?” I asked, wincing as I tucked my gun back into my belt. Blood, hot and dark, stained my unscarred shoulder, weeping crimson above the bone. It hadn’t struck anything vital, but it hurt like the very devil.
My guilt would not aid him now. I shoved away the pain and fear, seizing upon the instincts I had honed in the war and forcing them to the forefront. Holmes needed my focus, and damn it, he would have every scrap of it. Looking up frantically for passerby, I whipped my head back and forth, searching the darkness. The sound of laughter met my ears and I turned to see a man and a woman walking by, arm and arm, and I threw out my voice in a bellow.
“It is a very remarkable performance,” he said lowly. “Very remarkable.” Without provocation, he began marching down the path with us in tow, his voice lifting once more in the crisp country air. “Let us go farther, then! The entrance gate is usually kept open, I suppose? Then this visitor had nothing to do but to walk in. But we cannot assume the killing was premeditated, Watson—however could she have anticipated murder, and yet armed herself with a weapon from inside the house, the Professor’s own study knife? If she had planned it ahead of time, she would have armed herself better, correct?” This last observation was a quieter aside, posed to himself, and clearly, the question was a challenge which invigorated him, judging from the spryness of my friend’s pace.
It was only through years in the service that I managed not to cry openly. This was more than I had dreamed of. I was so moved I could barely speak, and underneath it, I felt a relief so powerful I felt weak. I felt joy. I felt foolish,
I frowned over the grubby, blank back of the note. "However are you supposed to reply with no return address?"
A moment of silence as I absorbed this information, and I shook my head in disbelief. Such a secret, in so unassuming a country manor. I was beginning to truly understand Holmes’s weariness of the foggy lands outside London’s borders. “So you determined that Coram was a Russian nihilist by his art and his cigarettes?”
Though he could not hear the poison Coram was whispering to me, Holmes’s eyes blistered with loathing. I sought his gaze, full of words I could not express—
“I think I made certain of a good deal, Mr. Holmes,” said Hopkins, frowning like a student scolded by his most favorite teacher. “I knew that someone had entered the house cautiously from without. I next examined the corridor outside the room itself. It is lined with coconut matting, and has taken no impression of any kind. The bedroom itself is scantily furnished and carpeted. The main article is a large writing-table with a fixed bureau, which consists of a double column of drawers with a small central cupboard between them. The drawers, it seems, were always open, and nothing of value was kept in them. The Professor assures me that nothing was missing. So, it is certain that no robbery has been committed.”
Holmes looks somewhat put out as I climb to my feet, his hair ruffled from lack of sleep, crisp robe wrinkled, lips pink with stimulation. For years I had thought Holmes to be the most handsome man I had ever come across, and long believed he was at his most lovely in the throes of victory. Now, I have cause to revise that belief. Holmes never looks more becoming that he does disheveled, pupils blown, and looking at me like I am something wanted. I am lost to that look, just as I am lost to the open affection on his face, and so I cave to my baser impulses. I stoop as well as I am able after a sleepless night and cup his face, thumbs sliding across his noble cheekbones as I draw him in for another kiss.
He shook his head. “If motive for the crime had been merely to obtain an object in his possession, the Corams could have taken it at any point using much less drastic measures. No, his death—his silence—was the point of it. The object, whatever it may have been, was merely a loose end they needed to resolve.”
” He said the phrase with the same disdain with which he uttered the words ‘marriage’ or ‘musical theatre’. “Truly I have mistepped, for I thought I had made clear that I was a man of science, of
“But if it reassures you, I will go in some manner of disguise. If not to wear when I enter, that at least to confuse any onlookers when we leave in the late evening.”
exclusive contracts for its rights of ownership and production.” A cab slowed to a halt before us. “Four exclusive contracts, with four different businesses—and all, of course, paid in advance.”
“Shall we move to the bar, Watson?” Holmes muttered in my ear. “The bartender would be my first choice of witness. Service people see altogether more than most realize.”
“And while you and Johann meet with those brigands, I will endeavor to locate Peter Ables and free him.”
“Indeed!” Coram said, too loudly. Something like a sneer quivered over his face, paired with eyes stretched far too wide. At that moment, Hopkins made his entrance, face ruddy.
“Here. She entered, came close, and she struck. The blade went deep.” With a closed fist, Holmes pressed a cool, gloved knuckle into the right side of my neck, not far from the artery. Unacknowledged, my heart fluttered in my breast. “But not deep enough. Smith gave a cry and managed to reach back—” A loyal puppet, I clapped one hand over Holmes’s where it pressed into my neck, and lifted the other backwards, reaching blindly behind me towards his face like one surprised and acting in self-defense. I managed to brush his cheek and bit back a foolish, nonsense smile at the feeling of skin.
“I shall endeavor not to bore you so,” Holmes said, reaching for his travelling coat on the rack beside his wardrobe. “But I cannot speak for good Reginald, I’m afraid. The man does have a tendency towards the prosaic.”
“I know of you, sir,” Ms. Tarlton said, her voice precarious and trilling like an overexcited flute. “I am a follower of your work!” The excitement flickered somewhat in her soft features, sorrow seeping blue and plaintive into her voice. “…Mr. Smith and I both would converse often about your stories in the
Holmes sighed heavily, as if I had handed him some great burden. “You and your fixation on meals,” he muttered.
“Mr. Robinson,” I recalled aloud, and Holmes nodded. The two of us made towards the station entrance, tugging the door open against the wind. I immediately melted in the warmth of its interior, where a fire crackled merrily in the waiting hall’s hearth. Unlike Evesham, some travelers milled about the inside, likely waiting for their fares despite the day’s cancelled trains. And some, I could not help but notice, appeared far from pleased.
“I am comfortable with that arrangement,” I said, perfectly soppy, and the intensity of his gaze waned.
“You’re tellin’ me!” the station master slurred, my tone having clearly gone over his slosh-ridden head. “Can’t get any peace round here, always something or another! Now, you have to send a telegram every time a train comes and goes, proper bure-bureau—proper paperwork
Gingerly, my bedroom door swings open. Holmes enters in his light sleep robe, looking so out of place and uncertain in the confines of my bedroom that it nearly dazes me for a moment.
“It was never my intention to conceal my nature from you.” Pain stole the volume from my voice. “But I have seen recrimination and violence too many times to risk revealing myself before knowing your character. With time, it grew too late to tell you the truth. I was afraid the confession would lead you to draw conclusions about my...living here, with you, and the possibility of...” I shook my head, cutting myself off before I dug the hole too deep to escape. “The truth of it is that I had come to enjoy your companionship too much to risk revealing my preferences to you. Your work amazed me. I felt more alive at your side, watching you solve cases, than I ever had in the months after returning from Afghanistan. I was afraid, and so I did not tell you.”
“I am glad to hear it,” I said earnestly, relieved that Fred had an adult looking after his needs while we worked our case.
“The performers told me that as of late, the Circle—like many other pubs in Ratcliffe—has been forced to accommodate the increasing conflict between two rival gangs: the Threadcaps and the Derry Cutthroats. Members of former have been seen harassing Johann quite regularly after closing these past few weeks.”
A wry eyebrow lifted in response. “The stubbornness of soldiers. One might consider it hypocritical, in certain circumstances.”
My eyes tripped on a sliver of white. I blinked tired tears out of my eyes, clenching my jaw through discomfort to straighten up and wipe my face. Squinting in the dark at the grate, my eyes narrowed on the white that caught my attention. I frowned and mindlessly reached for a poker. Digging into the cold, week-old ash, I encouraged the white scrap onto the floor in streaks of ash that Mrs. Hudson would scowl over. I bent again, wincing, and retrieved the scrap, lifting it to my face.
“You managed without it before, and you’ll do so now. Unless you feel that convenience has weakened your deductive powers on foot?”
Inspector Hopkins is a dedicated, newly promoted officer, and by and large, he’s one of the few lads at the Yard that Holmes considers worth his salt. He’s young and quick and eager to learn, a far cry from many of the old dogs in the force, but more to his credit the young inspector is hardworking without a shred of arrogance in him. To my endless amusement, he also finds Holmes’s intellect totally inspirational. He needs never say as much aloud; it’s all too clear in his starry-eyed manner and impressed ejaculations whenever Holmes does something expectedly brilliant. I admit, he often reminds me of myself early on in my partnership with Holmes—frequently bowled over with wonder that such a shrewd mind exists, and determined to impress the man who wields it.
Flinging myself upwards in bed, I strained my ears through sudden silence and heard only the thundering of my pulse. The morning was abruptly quiet, my bedroom still and sun-lit yellow, and for a moment I wondered whether the sound had been real at all.
“Without pulling the brakes? S’not possible,” the station master said firmly, continuing to shake his head and stare off in the direction the train had been. “I can’t believe it...”
“Unquestionably,” I said. My heart pounded in my chest like engine pistons. I exhaled, sharply enough it felt I would fall apart on its release. "I knew you could not reciprocate, so I did not tell you. I couldn't, for fear of jeopardizing our friendship. But I do not—have not ever wanted to leave, Holmes. I am...happier than I have ever been, being your partner. I would change my life for nothing."
“Only you would cast the concern of others as scheming, little brother,” Mycroft said, visibly amused, before his face returned to its solemn cast. “Regrettably, I must sabotage Doctor Watson’s valiant attempt to keep you from an early grave. Queen and country demand it.”
Holmes looks smug. “I presume his attempt to locate the diamonds stolen from his flat last month failed. It was a wasted effort to look to the mainland, they’re almost certainly in the city.”
Teeth gritted, my eyes fell upon the pipe lying dormant and unused on the table beside me. Holmes had smoked it the day before we'd left, face layered with a seriousness I only now realized the extent of. I’d noticed straight away, that it was the ebony black pipe. Holmes only smoked that one in the direst of occasions. I’d noticed, but said nothing. Had trusted that if it was important, if there was something to be done to help, Holmes would have confided in me.
very skilled,” I hummed, brow furrowing in consternation. I remembered my own observation about the path earlier. “And requires a somewhat intimate knowledge of the premises, wouldn’t you say, Holmes?” I was rewarded with another proud glance from my friend that sent warmth blossoming in my chest.
Inexplicably, color seemed to bloom in my friend's alabaster cheeks, low red and inappropriately becoming.
Wiggins clapped a hand on the young boy’s shoulder. “Told ya ‘e would believe you, Freddie. Mr. ‘Olmes can smell foul doings a mile off.”
“Don’t move, rat,” Worthy hissed, crimson seeping through his fingers and down his shirtsleeve. Ice water filled my stomach as I prepared for another flare of heat and searing pain, but suddenly, the man went stiff as a board.
, I assumed. Close enough. The boy smiled briefly, as though proud to remember, and I couldn’t help feeling impressed with his elocution and good memory, considering his age. “It’s a good job. Peter says it’s a lot safer than the other ‘uns closer to where we live.”
Perhaps in transcribing the events that inspired the nightmare haunting my nerves, its influence will be purged. It will never enter the light of day nor the pages of the
“Fine green silk,” Holmes remarked, turning it over in his hands. “Wrapped around stiff metal wire, likely woven iron. Too small to be worn around the wrist, and too plain to be a lady’s trinket, despite the silk’s expense. You say this was hidden, Fred? Underneath your brother’s bed?”
“Which means, I suppose, that you are not quite clear about your case.” Holmes lit his pipe, sucked, and gave it an exploratory puff. “Go on.”
“Thank you, Mrs. Hudson. Could you please bring us another round of tea, oh thank you. Come in, my dear sir, Watson has just lit a fire and you are clammy with cold.”
His lip curled in a sneer, the crude, ugly kind fetched from his blackest moods. “You stand among the most compassionate of men, Watson. And look what’s come to you.”
"Watson," Holmes said softly, my name a low note of despair. I closed my eyes. My fingers seized over the brandy glass in my hand, and I resisted the urge to volley it across the room and send it shattering.
All of the apprehension that had stiffened the Professor’s limbs had bled from him in the middle of Holmes’s statement. Now, he lit a cigarette with unsettling, masterful coolness. The end of his cigarette seared fire-red, and in its glow the piercing eyes that had once caught my attention now sent chills down my spine.
The man hesitated, his bleary gaze wandering away from Holmes towards the floor. “Oh, y'know, just a spot of upkeep. Some workers came here earlier and borrowed ‘em from the shed.”
Lifting an eyebrow, I joined his side and peered down at the long stretch of tracks at our feet. “Strange they're still here, Holmes,” I said, brow furrowing. “Quite deep, I should say.”
Holmes looked torn, appraising me with narrowed eyes as though skeptical of my willingness to divert the course we had stumbled on, but eventually his shoulders drooped. “You are right,” he admitted. He lifted his hand to where mine rested over his heart, sliding his violinist fingers between mine. “And the more moral party between us, naturally.”
My hands fell to my lap. I cradled the pipe within them, its weight heavy and cool. I traced the new crack trailing down the wood, and my heart thudded a slow, heavy, painful rhythm.
“Ah, yes. Well, I have been busy,” I said, carefully taking his leather-gloved hand in a cordial shake. He really
Holmes frowned. "You don't intend to—" His face cleared, flickering with annoyance. "You want me to invite you to, don't you? To say it aloud." He glared, but the look was undercut by the flush in his cheeks. "Watson. I require additional data. Indulge me?"
The Professor shook his head. “Susan is a country girl,” he said, waving a hand. “You know the incredible stupidity of that class. I fancy that the poor fellow murmured some incoherent delirious words, and that she twisted them into some meaningless message.”
Holmes issued a slow, amiable smile, leaning forward to engage Thomas’s confidence in a low tone. “I’m here to meet a good friend from circles outside this one. He mentioned that he was a member here in conversation, and I haven’t seen him since a certain bash in the East End left me with his address quite ruined—an unfortunate mishap with some spilled wine, you see.”
