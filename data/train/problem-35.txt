‘I see,’ Watson ran his fingers through the fine, brownish-grey earth, lifted them to his nose, and sniffed. ‘I assume he derives the name from the Greek, ‘dynamos’, if it is indeed so powerful. Yet it seems unobjectionable enough like this, the liquid and the solid both. And what do you intend to do to this substance when you have mixed it?’
After my sad revelation, Watson and I went on quietly together for a few months. I endeavoured to diminish my morphia, tapering it off by little and little, but it proved difficult. On my suggestion, Watson began to administer my decreasing nightly dose to me, and then to lock away the drug and the syringe. It was a strangely intimate event: I bared my arm, he wiped my skin with alcohol, drew up the solution and showed me the amount, raised a vein and performed the injection with neat-handed ease. Afterwards, he would wipe my arm again before drawing the sleeve of my shirt or nightgown down and bidding me goodnight. There was an absent-minded affectionateness in his look when he did so; a soft, sure familiarity. I cherished the warmth of him near me, the scent of his skin, the touch of his strong, kind fingers. When he concentrated on the injection I could gaze my fill on him, learning him a piece at a time. The whorls of his ear, the way the muscles corded in his neck, the faint lines at the corner of his eye – they fascinated me to the point of obsession. I would never have enough of him. I needed to breathe him in as I needed air: without him I suffocated, breathless, dying.
“Watson, Kensington Infirmary . . .” At this point in 1893, Watson was not living in Baker Street, but Kensington. Kensington Infirmary, in Marloes Road was a hospital for the London poor, where Watson worked at this time.
I released one hand from his grip to touch his shoulder. ‘There is yet one more small piece of sugar. I have prevailed upon my friend in the government to offer half of the endowment for a cot in the hospital. With that, and with what you and I can manage, we can put Lestrade’s little girl there tomorrow. But for this, I make one stipulation.’
‘And I replied to you that I do not think it wrong. I would be most honoured if he could love me, could consent to share all himself with me - body and soul – it would be the greatest honour. I still think so. But there is present danger, my dear, and I also said I would do him no harm, this man I loved.’
‘Burns-Gibson and I hastened to help of course, with others of St Mary’s who were quickly on the scene, but I thought only of you. I had you conveyed here, it being better than the hospital, and here you have lain ever since. Poor Lestrade has been every day to enquire after you, the house is haunted by a succession of anxious boys, and little Janey is wholly dissolved in tears. And as for Mrs Hudson, she has been near out of her mind with worry. Now will you lie still, and behave yourself while I call her? I shall give you your soup, and you must rest for a while. It is just like yourself that you should immediately want to know everything, Holmes, but you must stay quiet and be content to be doctored.’
‘John,’ I said, and then I knew: he was afraid for me, because of Moran, and he feared what his dreams would show him. ‘You will not sleep tonight?’
From where I lay I had a perfect view of the inside of the room and of every one of his movements. He lit the two candles which stood upon the mantelpiece, and then he proceeded to turn back the corner of the carpet in the neighbourhood of the door. Presently he stopped and picked out a square piece of board, such as is usually left to enable plumbers to get at the joints of the gas-pipes. This one covered, as a matter of fact, the T joint which gives off the pipe which supplies the kitchen underneath. Out of this hiding-place he drew that little cylinder of paper, pushed down the board, rearranged the carpet, blew out the candles, and walked straight into my arms as I stood waiting for him outside the window.
He smiled then, and I relaxed a little. Perhaps all would be well. Maybe. But I sensed change in the air, and it did not make me happy.
Our tender moment passed, as I had meant it to: I could not afford his tenderness. He had no shame in showing it, but it was dangerous for me. He laughed, and passed the violin over, and I played to him. When we parted for the night, his goodnight was fervent, his eyes warm with affection, and he wrung my hand with such hearty goodwill that it was quite bruised.
'I do. And I think too that mine is the fault for which you are paying: although these persecutions are directed against you, they aim at me - and at, at us -  as a, as part -  as a part - w - a working partnership.'
‘I have no desire to leave you, Sherlock. My dear Damon.’ He winced suddenly. ‘Oh my God. No. I will not think of it, not of Kirwan and Cornwall. It was our usage before ever we heard of them. It is just that, with this addition to the Act, the sorry affair at Dublin Castle, has been much in my mind of late. It is not just O’Brien and his Irish newspaper who waxed eloquent in their condemnation of the men who – loved – other - oh, if there were only a term, for this. One cannot always be using some periphrasis, and I will not call them buggers as is the common cant, or sods: these are terms of opprobrium, and not to be used. But in any case, a word for men who love other men and express that love in physical congress, as other men might with a woman. The jackals of the English press, when they were done reprobating the intransigence of the Irish, also complained that there was no punishing this unnameable sin if the act stopped short of coitus. And Labouchère was foremost among them, I recall. This is his doing, snake in the grass that he is. And he an adulterer, and a begetter of illegitimate babes! He to be a moral arbiter, he to hold us up to a standard! He is a hypocrite of the first water.’
Two nights after that found us at Covent Garden. The piece given was ‘Leila’ a twenty year old work by the composer Bizet, more renowned for his Carmen than for this, which had proved unpopular. The subject of the opera, which was new to me, struck me with unexpected force: with what turmoil in my breast, with what sudden upwelling of passion in my heart did I hear the duet in the first act between the two friends and rivals! The tenor, Nadir, recalls how he has sworn eternal friendship to Zurga, renouncing the priestess, Leila who had nearly come between them to wreck their passionate love for each other. Zurga reiterates his vow to cherish his friend as a brother; embracing, the two swear that they will remain united until death. After a lapse of some years, Leila reappears; Nadir betrays his friend and his vow and pursues her. Zurga is enraged by his beloved friend’s treachery, and denounces the pair. Both are condemned to die, for Nadir has committed sacrilege: Leila is a priestess, sworn not to marry. Then Zurga repents –
‘He is the best man that ever I knew in my life, saving your presence, Mr Holmes,’ returned Lestrade. ‘And I know you will not take that as my casting aspersions on yourself, for the two of you are the best of friends. Why, you are a team: Mr Holmes and Doctor Watson, and so we think of you in the force. Well, well, I must not take up your time like this, whittling on about my own affairs; you are a busy man, and do not come here to listen to me. But I take it kindly of you for asking, Mr Holmes, indeed I do. Now about that case you mentioned . . .’
I put the cigar case aside at once. ‘I thought it was that you did not care to embrace me any more. You have not been – kind – to me these last weeks, John, since Lestrade’s Camberwell case ended. I have hardly even seen you for days: whenever I wanted you, you were at Barts.’
‘At ten,’ I replied, surrendering to the inevitable - how could I cross a man who was so loyal to us - as I watched him shake Watson’s hand again, clap him on the shoulder, and take his leave without more ado. ‘Thank you, Lestrade.’
I had, as I said to Watson, no idea why the newspapers bothered to employ these circumlocutory devices: by referring to ‘the unnameable sin’ in the way they did, they effectively named it, and by July, only a child or an idiot could have been unaware that the case was to do with sodomy. Meiklejohn had not needed to fabricate evidence against any of the plaintiffs-in-prospect, however: it was there in plenty. Some witnesses he had failed to find, but all too many had succumbed to bribery, bullying and the threat of action taken against themselves. The case had grown monstrous: an entire echelon of society, covert, unsuspected by the masses, and therefore, suddenly, dangerous, was dragged into the open, and the public learned that it should be hated.
The crowd had diminished, and Watson bade me rise, taking my arm to lead me to the door. We had just attained the open air, when a gentleman accosted me.
A week later a new, and larger afghan, knitted in thick wool of a deep, lapis blue appeared on the sofa, and under its kindly warmth through the last days of a bitter cold February and the first week of March, we progressed with poor Dantès to his examination before de Villefort, the villainous Procureur du Roi. We were, in fact, sitting together reading one evening when Mrs Hudson tapped on the door and announced Lestrade, and it was with some reluctance that Watson returned to his own chair, sighing, and casting an annoyed glance at the door.
‘What concerns happiness is never slight,’ said Watson. He smiled at her, and I saw that she found his gentle gallantry entirely charming. ‘You are a woman of considerable strength of character, Lady Laura, and I am very sure you are formidable in battle. I do not have any doubt that you will do your best in court. I have every confidence in you.’
‘Is there – is there anything – anything I can offer to, to solace you, my dear?’ His voice was so gentle. He was always so gentle with me. ‘I – I hate to see you so low.’
‘ – he that had a tamping iron through the brain, yet recovered enough to work as a stagecoach driver, and died some years later in a
‘ – or perhaps is given more time to stay at another house where the owner might have gems worth stealing, Lestrade - ’
‘Yes - the meaning is clear – if you understand what it means that this group of bachelors – confirmed bachelors – have only each other for company. That they seek each other out, sojourn at each others’ houses. There is not a woman to be seen in this book. It is Scott Eccles and Mr Garcia over again, it is Cornwall and his musical parties, and Kirwan. If one knows, it is there.’
‘But I do not know yet the minutiae of the case, my dear fellow, nor the cleverness with which you conducted it. You may amuse yourself telling me about it after you have had a nap, and I shall make notes for you. Now my dear, here is the ice, and we shall see if that makes you more comfortable.’
‘He was. When we decided to take the Baskerville case, it was at short notice: we have kept very close because Sir Henry has had a follower tailing him, although we believe him to have returned to Devonshire now.’
‘C-certainly, of c-course,’ I stammered, a reason for his hesitation suddenly occurring to me. I set the glass down, and fled, feeling the blood rush to my cheeks. Alas, it rushed to other parts as well, even as I sternly bade my mind not dwell upon what Watson might have been doing on his bed. It was fortunate that both Mrs Hudson and Janey were setting the room to rights when I got downstairs; Janey building the fire high, and Mrs Hudson, having unceremoniously swept my papers to one side, laying the table with snowy linen and our best silverware. Their presence, and the need to organise my papers, was an effective stay to my unruly fancy, yet when in our warmed, tidied room, I faced Watson across our dinner table, I blushed again and again, feeling the colour mount and then recede into pallor as I shivered.
‘Oh, we could not do it without your friend in government,’ he said. ‘I daresay the price is shocking. No, no, I do not expect to travel like this again in my life: it is enough to do it once. What time do we dine, Holmes?’
Watson was ill for some time after the events of that night. We had arrived home just before dawn and I was about to half drag, half carry him up the stairs, when Mrs Hudson appeared with a candle. I believe she wished to remonstrate with both of us: she did not appear to have been to bed but had waited for our return, for she was fully clad. She checked herself, however when she saw the state Watson was in, and flew to heat water and prepare coffee, muttering something about it being a good thing that the rest of the household was absent. I begged for warm milk for Watson, for I felt any further stimulant would be most unwise, and made him drink it. I manhandled him into the bath and out of it, and saw him into his nightshirt and robe, but he was, by then, at the very extremity of exhaustion and did not even argue when I made him lie down in my own bed, so that he might not have to climb the stairs. After a while, I had the relief of seeing him drop into a natural sleep, his pulse returning to its regular beat, and his colour more normal. I remained with him while he slept through the day, explaining to Mrs Hudson that we had been walking and he had suddenly been taken ill. She scolded me about our irregular habits and tiresome ways for quite some time, but she hung over Watson like a fond mother while he was recovering over those few days, and cooked every delicacy she could to tempt him.
‘I am glad that you will be her protector. I must tell you that from all the evidence you have given me, if your recount is true and you have left nothing out, that I believe your young friend to have been sane, and to have consented to be married in that state. And that she has become ‘insane’ as the doctors have it, since her marriage, and that certain events in her marriage – events as yet unknown to us - have led her to this. And I believe that if others can speak to her behaviours as a child then a judge will find so also. Do you not concur, Watson? What is your opinion?’
'Could it have been the Scowrers?' he asked. He stroked my cheek. 'Oh, my dear, I am so sorry, so sorry. I know how it is with you when things go wrong, but you have not failed, never think it.'
“You know Blake’s verse too? I often think of it as I work, Holmes: for it is true. Too many ills, too irremediable. Sometimes it is hard to have hope.”
'Confess, Watson,' I said to him, watching with some amusement as he prodded resentfully at the remains of the pâté de foie gras pie on his plate. 'It is not just your writer's eye for a good tale that is offended, but your chivalrous heart. Although had St Simon been more gracious, my dear fellow, you would not be finishing off that very fine pie for luncheon, because he would have eaten his share of it.'
Ignoring Watson’s feeble protests, I propped him higher against my shoulder and handed him the tea, but his hand shook so much the cup rattled in the saucer, and I had to hold it to his lips. I looked up at Jack. ‘Enough delays, Jack Saul; tell me now what is to be told. Watson is awake to hear and we must be away as soon as we can be. And do not, do not, I beg you, make a jest of  - of any of this.’
Joachim's concert was on April 9th. Madame Clara Schumann did indeed accompany him at the last concert of the series, to great critical acclaim. Watson is perhaps prejudiced in favour of his friend, since Joachim was one of the first violinists of the age.
'Will you play at chess with me? Or walk? We have not taken one of our night walks together this age. Or play for me? We have been so busy that your violin sits neglected of late, my dear fellow, and I so miss your music. It is too late to go to a concert this evening, but we might have one to ourselves, perhaps? Or would you like me to send to Lestrade, to see if he needs you on the morrow? Tell me what you have a mind to, and we shall do it.'
'Put his head into the noose again? I think he will not, but go back to his dancer of dubious repute, although if she takes him back, she's a fool. I did not take to the gentleman at all.' Watson winced, and shifted in his chair. August had been cold, wet and windy. There had been a storm the previous day, the month tearing itself out in furious weather, and I could see that he was suffering from the after effects of the jezail bullet, which, with his shoulder wound and the enteric fever, had put paid to his army career. He had not been back from Barts  until the small hours, had slept late, and woken in pain. 'Damn this leg. With this wretched weather it has done nothing but throb and ache all night. I could barely get up this morning. At this rate I shall be lame as a three-legged horse by the time I am forty.'
In any case, the spirit of Christmas Present (not content with simply telling me the tale, Watson had been reading it to me in instalments) was firmly ensconced in our dwelling. It was inescapable. Swathes of greenery dripped from every available surface. The air was redolent not just of our incense, but of cinnamon, orange and spice. Our table was heaped with practical presents for the Irregulars, purchased on our behalf by Mrs Hudson, and a veritable
‘It would, of course, increase the amount of venom in the wound, which is not such a good thing.’ I replaced the cap on my microscope lens, and stretched. ‘But it would save the bee, and that must always be an object with me. They are such honest, humble little creatures, performing a work of great use and profit to mankind. I wonder that they are not more regarded as benefactors. Good heavens, it is growing quite dark: no wonder it was difficult to see my specimens. And I do believe I am starving. What time is it, Watson? And is there anything to eat?’
'To embroil him further: showing him as a murderer who delighted in his work. To add an extra layer to the story. To sharpen the horror of a healer who kills. As for the woman, it is not that she had been suborned, for no woman would go to her death - and such a death - willingly: that was not the plan. She did not choose to be bait: she did not consent to be used. And no-one could have predicted that Watson would be out that night, or that he would be alone, or that he would speak to her, among many thousands of her like. No, she must have been innocent: the wrong woman in the wrong place at the wrong time, killed because she spoke to the one man . . .'
I did as requested. I had a bruise on one cheekbone (and others elsewhere that I was certainly not prepared to reveal) and he tutted over it.
His words were kind, but his voice was the voice of a captain speaking to a man under his command. There was no gainsaying it, and Trevelyan consented to his speaking to me, thanked him – blessed him for his kindness - in a low, moved voice, before entering the house. Watson stood looking after him for a moment, waited till the door closed, sighed, and limped to his cab. He passed me close in the drive, not remarking me in his abstraction, and I saw him tug his moustache as he murmured, ‘It is too late. He has left it too late. Poor young fool, if only he had heeded the signs, and he a doctor. Poor man. Poor, foolish, wretched man, and he a doctor.’
‘I am a fortunate man to have you to understand me, Holmes. Many would call me a coward.’ His voice was so low, and so pained, my heart went out to him. ‘A wretched, puling coward, to dream and sweat, and wake up in tears, all because of the prospect of combat. I thought I was over it, but no, the merest hint of war and my terrors come again. Where is my spirit? Where my courage?’
‘You always have an answer, Holmes. I am grateful for it, and that you think to console me, rather than accuse me of being unmanly, or a coward. I am not convinced, but I take it kindly of you. There are no easy answers to this dilemma.’
‘I do.’ Lestrade sipped his wine. ‘You spoil us, Mr Holmes, this is a very fine burgundy. What follows then?’
‘I shall have to sacrifice my hat if he does.’ Watson’s tone was resigned. ‘Damn you, Holmes, could you not leave it to me to deal with the brute? All it needed was a pistol butt to the nose or collarbone, just enough to incapacitate. Thank you, Billy, I have him now. Dammit, I’ve given all my cash to that constable for the little ones. Make sure you and Sam and Mags come to Baker Street tomorrow, and I’ll see you get your fee, and some over. Good man. Drive on, cabbie.’
On one occasion, as he observed the newspaper – not reading or scanning it, for a surety, as his eye was fixed, and did not travel the lines, I ventured to approach and, placing a hand on his shoulder, asked what news there was.
‘If you shoot, shoot to incapacitate, not to kill,’ he told me, ‘unless you are in the last extremity, when you have my full permission to shoot where you damn well please. If you wish to be sure of your kill, in a frontal shot aim for the head, directly between the eyes. From the side, aim for the opening of the ear, from the back, the base of the skull. A shot there will penetrate the most vital areas, cause immediate loss of consciousness, and drop your quarry where he stands.’
‘Mrs Hudson speaks of roast partridge and bread sauce. I believe there is a port wine jelly for pudding, a Stilton cheese, and I could open a bottle of Beaune.’
Reggie Brett, the 2nd Lord Esher, and political eminence grise, was bisexual. Holdhurst implies that Phelps is too, but that he himself is not.
‘Some of these men, Watson, have been in England since January or February, preparing their explosives in immense quantities. Thomas Gallagher is the moving force; he is an Irishman whose family emigrated about fifteen years ago, and he is as rabid a Fenian as you might find, hand in hand with ‘the Old Man,’ a fellow called O’Donovan Rossa. But the man who has made our explosive is Albert Whitehead, who is a chemist. He took a small shop in Birmingham, ostensibly for the purpose of selling paint, which he was to mix himself, and there he proceeded to order from two different chemists huge quantities of nitric and sulphuric acids, totalling over 1,700 pounds in weight of nitric, and over 3,400 of sulphuric, and - ’
I retrieved the volume from his desk. 'Why is it my almanacs are always on your desk, and not on mine? No, do not answer that: I know it is because it is always you who looks up the trains. I am a sore trial to you, I  am afraid, my dear fellow. Here it is! Here is page 534, column two, a substantial block of print dealing, I perceive, with the trade and resources of British India. Jot down the words, Watson! Number thirteen is 'Mahratta.' Not, I fear, a very auspicious beginning. Number one hundred and twenty-seven is 'Government'; which at least makes sense, though somewhat irrelevant to ourselves and Professor Moriarty. Now let us try again. What does the Mahratta government do? Alas! the next word is 'pig's-bristles.' We are undone, my good Watson! It is finished!'
'Thank you, Dr Watson, but as Nancy knows, I live very happily with my own dear friend and companion. We are well suited and have been together for some years now. I do not think my dearest Dora would be happy were I to transfer my allegiance. But if Nancy must have a companion for the proprieties then I can engage to find her among my acquaintance an understanding lady who will not tittle-tattle, nor gossip, nor quibble if she has a male caller from time to time. A woman who knows how to be discreet, and hold her counsel, and who can be both disinterested in her friendship and - and uninterested in what Nancy chooses to do with her - friend.'
He was gone in the morning, when I rose to a silent house and quizzical looks from Mrs Hudson, who presented me, mid-morning, with a parcel of cakes and pies, ‘for your children, Mr Holmes. Dr Watson said you would be going to Limehouse this morning, and I was to be sure and give you these, and you were to look at young Billy’s leg and inform him if you thought all was not going well. Are you not going to St Mary’s today then, Sir? And will you be dining with the doctor and Dr Burns-Gibson this evening, or do you wish me to prepare a meal for you here?’
Cicero so often has the apt and trenchant word. Your hat is upon the chesterfield, my dear fellow: I have no idea why.’
‘Read this.’ He pushed a small slip of paper over the table. His hand, I noticed with some astonishment, was shaking slightly.
‘Yes, it was unfortunate for you that you were not aware of his being in Devonshire, the last time.’
‘The answer is yes,’ I told him. ‘If we can by any means afford it, Watson, I would wish to remain in Baker Street, and I do not believe I would go on half so comfortably with any other but you as a companion. So we need only think of what you might do. You might see clients here, as I do.’ I glanced around. ‘Ah – then again . . . perhaps not . . . My experiments have, it appears, left some ineradicable traces. I wonder that Mrs Hudson does not complain more often, now I come to look about me.’
‘There is no depravity in you.’ He looked up then, his gaze fierce. There is no depravity in you: you have a clean soul, a pure soul, and it is beautiful. All about you is beautiful, Sherlock, your mind, your soul. You.’
‘It has not been easy this last year and a half,’ I mused, affecting an air of cruel unconcern, ‘living with a cripple, a man who can follow me neither physically nor intellectually. So yes, it must be you. You are what ails me, Watson, and I thank you for making it clear for me. It only remains now for you to leave me, as I am sure you must wish to do. As you must see is the best for both of us.’ And I rose, pushed my chair back and flung away from him, as though I could no longer bear his presence.
'It took you more than two hours to walk from Barts to Baker Street?' The Inspector's gaze had sharpened.
‘Certainly I do. I can hardly bear, even now that I have broken through the double veil, to think of my earlier life, and of that idiotic social reserve and Britannic pretence which prevailed over all that period – and to a great extent still does prevail, especially among the so-called well-to-do classes of this country – the denial and systematic ignoring of the obvious facts of heart and sex, and the consequent desolation and nerve-ruin - ’ he broke off, seemingly much moved.
I set the flask down with extreme care, and took up a small package which I opened for him. ‘This is a diatomaceous earth common in Germany, where it is termed kieselgur – which of course our newspapers, in reporting this sorry case, are quite failing to spell correctly -  and mixing these two substances, triturating them slowly and carefully to a paste, renders the explosive less dangerous. In such a state he terms it ‘dynamite’ and it is now sold for mining operations, where it is desired to shift great masses of rock. I begged a little of the liquid and the earth from Dupré, in order to experiment.’
‘I will return to you unharmed, I promise. Embrace me, my dear Watson, and wish me well. I may have need of all the world’s luck to retrieve those three gems and the banker’s honour with them. Oh – and before we go our separate ways?’
'Or to subvert them.' He took my hand. 'Who watches one, may watch another. I have wondered, since the case of that poor woman, whether it was one of our own who tracked me about the city, whether innocently, tricked into it, beguiled or turned against us. We know they are wont to keep an eye on us: how many times has one or other of them not appeared as if summoned by a djinn's lamp, when we are in need of a messenger, or an assistant? What if it was one of ours?'
‘An excellent idea. What, you are not conning that rag of Labouchère’s again, are you? Truth! Untruth would be a more appropriate name for it.’
‘ – of course you did not think: when do you ever think, my dear man, when it is some issue that you consider pressing? Sit down, sit down here now. Yes, perch on the edge. I shall use a towel, and to hell with the stain. Where the deuce is Mrs Hudson with the water – there is none hot, of course, there never is when one needs it – and the tea.’
‘Holmes,’ said Watson to me, laying his hat on the sideboard as he entered our sanctum, ‘I am afraid I shall have to go to Edinburgh.’
‘I am unapt for friendship.’ I handed him the glass and sat on the edge of the sofa: he turned to his side so that I was held in the curve of his body. ‘Sit up and drink, John, you must be fatigued after your ordeal.’
‘Come back.’ I pulled him to me again. ‘I did not say I would, only that he would. You, unmanly: water is dry then! Wait, John -  do not be angry, but listen to me. Now, are your feathers smooth again?’
. . ‘This is a powerful passage,’ This retrospective takes place at the end of the holiday in which Holmes and Watson quote the “Queen and huntress chaste and fair” poem.
'We can surmise that he seeks power: to be able to control men. Mycroft believes that he aims higher, at the government itself.'
‘What?’ he growled. There was a rustle and a thud, as if he had just rolled off his bed. ‘What do you want now, Holmes?’ He sounded exasperated, I thought.
'It is also you. You salve their bruises, and bind their wounds, and cure their ills. You tell them stories and regale them with unwholesome sweets, saveloys, greasy pies, and currant buns according to season. They adore you, John.'
‘You have a good friend there, Mr Holmes,’ observed Lestrade eventually. His voice was low, and thoughtful. ‘A very good friend indeed.’
‘My God, Sherlock, if you call him John to any other than me, you are lost. Do not imply an intimacy. Do not allow yourself to fall into an intimacy: it is to damn both him and yourself.’
‘I have missed you quite damnably, you impossible man. The house has been quiet and lonely, and so have I. There, is your vanity satisfied?’
‘Here are your reports, my dear fellow, and very well thumbed, I assure you. I made excellent arrangements, and they are only delayed one day upon their way. I must compliment you exceedingly upon the zeal and the intelligence which you have shown over an extraordinarily difficult case. But John – oh, my dear, my dear boy – how came you to write so ardently? We cannot afford the risk, my very dear! Your words, my dear, lie beneath these rocks, buried in my best handkerchief, and so they must remain until the end of the story.’
‘I am to visit Meynert and later talk to some of the younger doctors: there is much debate at the moment whether the basis of aberrant behaviour is physiological or within the psyche. Meynert, of course, maintains that it is entirely structural: he has developed the art of dissecting brain material to its highest state, and has many slides showing structural abnormalities. I was discussing with Breuer today the noteworthy case of Phineas Gage - ’
‘I think Eccles is innocent, I think Garcia was – not who he appeared to be – and I think the next few days will reveal all. But I do thank you for wishing to protect my virtue, my dear Watson.’
‘Share rooms.’ I said. ‘men who – care for each other. Who – like each other, who are comrades, as we are, like the Theban band, like the Spartans of old.’
‘Somewhere lonely,’ I told him. ‘I am weary, Watson: “odi profanum vulgus et arceo,” if you recall your Horace from school. ‘Do you remember? “ . . . somnus agrestium lenis virorum . . .” Can you go on? I hate the vulgar crowd, and so avoid them . . . a farmer’s calm slumber . . .?’
‘Indeed. I tell you, Watson, this time we have got a foeman who is worthy of our steel. I have been checkmated in London. I can only wish you better luck in Devonshire. But I cannot be easy in my mind about it.’
‘No, I do not like it, but we are assured of its harmlessness, so I will not gainsay you. You will only use the three-per-cent solution?’
‘He is a matter of indifference to me,’ I replied, with as haughty an inflection as I could manage. ‘I simply wonder to see you so concerned about a stranger.’
‘Of your company, I am.’ I hated to admit it, but it was clear he had divined the reason for my pique. ‘I am. You  - you are the friend and chosen companion of everyone: I am a solitary being, unfriended save for you.’ I touched his head as it lay against my knee. ‘Ah no, no. I should not say such things, my dear fellow. Forgive me, it was a momentary lapse. It is not even any longer wholly true since you have taken me under your wing, and given me the key to friendship with others. It is wrong of me to say anything. It will not be repeated.’
Berkshires, as I told you, having been seconded from my own regiment, the Northumberland. Moran was commanding the 3
‘Whatever it is, you must still tell me.’ He caressed my cheek. ‘Do not keep it from me. Please. I – care for you so much, my dear. Please do not shut me out.’
The Phoenix Park murders of 6th May 1882 shocked the nation. Full details can be found here: http://www.historyireland.com/featured-archive-post/lord-frederick-cavendish-phoenix-park-murders-1882/ This was not, alas, to be Holmes' and Watson's only encounter with the Fenians, amd their cousins, the Clan Na Gael.
‘I had always hoped for a practice of my own,’ he admitted. ‘To set up my plate in a respectable area, and to treat enough of those sufficiently able to pay to enable me to treat the poor,
‘That is not quite the case,’ he told me, and I knew that I paled further as he did so. ‘Once discharged, the poison sacs are immediately replenished with fresh and more potent venom; moreover some snakes can strike and envenom their victim more than once. Many a man has made that mistake – good heavens, Holmes, you have gone positively grey, sit at once, sit here, and put your head down,’ and he forced me to the sofa and made me bow my head between my knees, ‘oh my dear fellow, I am very sorry: you really do not like them, do you?’
Jaswant Singh, and his brother, Sir Pratap, who visited England and was knighted by Queen Victoria, were staunch supporters of the British in India. They, and Major Beatson, were also dedicated polo players.
‘There,’ he said, wiping his fingers on his pocket handkerchief. ‘And I am very sorry for hurting you, my dear chap. Still, this will help. It’s an amazing thing, arnica: a small flower, but so potent to reduce a haematoma.’
I could hardly breathe. ‘But if a man – who loved another man, who trusted in him with all his soul – were willing to, to give all – to brave the danger – to brave the world – to be everything, b-body and soul to – to the man he loved – what then?’
‘I wish you would let me come with you then.’ His gaze was earnest. ‘I do not feel comfortable when you play such perilous parts alone.’
She left us then with the promise of dinner later, and I made haste to cosset him as much as I could, with a dash of brandy in his tea, my best tobacco in his pipe and his chair drawn up to the fire. But much later, when I had played him up the stairs to bed at the end of an evening of reading our Dumas, I whistled one of the ever-present lads to the window, and sent him off with a telegram for Mycroft. Let him put our money to good use for once, I reflected. I wanted none of the filthy stuff: let it bring happiness where it might.
It was thanks to Mycroft and the Diogenes that he was better, and more safely situated, poor man, but I did not tell him that, of course. ‘Then perhaps we might venture on the morrow to retrace the steps of our investigation. It is always a pleasure to show Watson these things: he has a writer’s eye and ear for them.’
‘I see.’ Lady Laura looked at him sternly, and he met her gaze without flinching, although his colour was still heightened. ‘You think my young friend was not fortunate enough to be kindly dealt with, and the derangement we have seen was subsequent to this.’
‘I have killed it Watson,’ I said, softly, and for some ridiculous reason, the tears rose to my eyes. ‘I did not mean to, poor wretched little thing, but see, it is dying.’
‘It was. It was the self-same mud, my dear fellow, in which I crouched with my chisel painstakingly scraping a rat-hole into the back gate of Professor Moriarty’s house with two doors. I deduce, therefore, that the tickets were sent by the professor, and he has some reason for wishing us to attend tonight. So I beg that you will come with me – I shall lend you the scarf you bought me for Christmas: it is of the softest cashmere – and I promise that the concert once over we shall return promptly for a soothing glass of punch: I do not wish you to become chilled and feverish, of course.’
‘What do you want? If I cannot buy you, can I buy him time? Peace? Freedom from these assaults? He does not deserve this, to be persecuted for his association with me, because you and I are enemies.’
'That's a pretty trinket.' Watson's eyes were amused. 'Ostentatious, but pretty. Now let me guess: it is a kingly gift, is it not?
‘Flinches! Are you implying that he beats her, abuses her? Heavens, Watson, why did you say nothing? We cannot leave the girl there if that is so: let us instantly return and rescue her!’
We progressed on through the crowd, I so enwrapt in his presence that I scarcely noticed our surroundings, but as we gained the cool air, I was recalled to myself by his soft exclamation. Our path had brought us across that of the three men we had noticed earlier – they were again in earnest colloquy -  and the wary soldier fellow – Moran, Watson had called him - clearly recognised my companion as an army acquaintance, for he stepped forward, and made as if to speak.
between the two men. At intervals he too made discreet use of a handkerchief, and at Zurga’s death a harsh sob shook him. We left as soon as we could, ignoring the ballet attached to the opera (which had unaccountably been placed after the ending instead of between the second and third acts). Unfortunately, there were many who did the same: before we reached the exit the crowds in the foyer, the noise, the lights, began to irritate me almost to madness, my head spinning, and lights flickering in my vision. I urged Watson to hurry. He took my arm and almost dragged me into the street; I followed, desperate, and panting until I was forced to beg him to stop. To wait, to let me draw breath.
‘He is a paragon indeed,’ I said, and I meant it. ‘What have you for me to do, Lestrade? I cannot run after our criminal – I am forced to be an invalid, as you see -  but I will do what I can for you, restricted as I am.’
‘I am aware of it: you told me as much. His name is Mycroft, and we are indebted to him for certain cases not unconnected with politics, some excellent wine, a pair of fat ducks, and a large quantity of oysters.’ He laughed at me then. ‘Do not look so surprised, my dear fellow. I have not your brilliance – will never have your brilliance – but I was able to deduce, I think, the identity of your mysterious friend in high office of some years ago, after you had told me more recently the story of your childhood. I do not know why I have not yet met him, but I hope one day to shake him by the hand, and tell him I am grateful for his kindness to you in your childhood. For the grievous tale of your youth made me weep – still makes me weep,’ and indeed, tears stood in his eyes, ‘and so I feel tenderly to anyone who solaced your grief.’
‘Stead bought her? Procured her himself? Did he indeed do so? Then I agree it is indefensible. Where is the child now?’
It was immediately clear to me that Eccles was an invert. It was not his habit of dress, or his outward appearance – to all intents and purposes, he was the epitome of a respectable businessman, stout, tall, grey-whiskered and solemn. Everything from his neat boots and pearl-grey spats to his top hat proclaimed the social conservative: even his frankly rather snobbish decrying my position of private detective – which I was not, I firmly corrected him; I was a consulting detective – indicated that he was endeavouring to play his part well. What was it then? What gave him away to me? How did one invert recognise another? Perhaps it was the way he looked at me that exposed him: a subtle appraisal -  one which I knew, for I had had to train myself out of it as a lad, lest I give away even my mild and innocent interest. Perhaps it was rather the covetous eye he cast, damn him, upon Watson - an assessing, lecherous glance at my dear boy’s finely shaped, beautiful mouth, the cut of his well-fitting tweed trousers, the gentle strength of his capable, surgeon’s hands.
He laughed again, clear and merry. ‘And of course I have had no idea that you were preparing it, my dear friend. How easy I am to deceive after all! I thought myself to be so clever in obtaining this little offering for you, and all the time, you have been playing me at my own game. Yes, let us hurry home. It will be a wild night: the storm is already rising. We will be better indoors, with a fire, and our experiments and a glass of wine.’
‘I am sorry.’ I had to say something. ‘I don’t – I am distressed by this case, more than by others, and you are correct when you say that – that my temper is become uneven. I cannot tell you why, but, Watson it is – it is not anything that – that might cause you to shun my presence, I  - I do assure you.’
‘Domestic.’ I said to him, as we traversed Baker Street, and made our way into Regent’s Park, its trees nearly leafless now in this misty middle of a wet and cold December. ‘Then it will doubtless be tedious beyond expression.’
‘I do, Sir.’ She drew from her apron pocket the items she had mentioned. ‘I have already sent to enquire of Mrs Lestrade when the Inspector will be returned. Here you are. I daresay they are nothing but paste, and are in reality trumpery little things, but they are made pretty and delicate enough to tempt a girl who has had nothing like them before.’
have not forgotten Ignorance and Want hiding in the cloak of Christmas Present, my dear fellow, even if you have. But I do not believe you have. You are a kind man, Holmes, even if you would rather not appear one. Is that all your budget of news? What more is there of sour, before I receive my bon-bon at the end to take away the taste?’
'No, but that branch of the family that is well known - there is, or was, for he is deceased now, a celebrated bishop of that name -  has impeccable credentials, for the bishop himself is a wholehearted supporter of English rule in Ireland.'
Mrs Hudson came in then, with our sherry, and he went straight to her, took her hand with courtly grace and kissed it, calling her the best and most generous of women. She asked him to put the dressing gown on, and they grew quite merry over how fine he looked. We drank sherry together, for I gave her my glass, and found a clean beaker for myself, and all the while he did not look at me. Not quite.
‘Too late to go anywhere to find food.’ he said, ‘so you will have to make do with the stew I have concocted. And then we will sit with a glass of wine. Would you play for me, Holmes, if you have finished your work for the day? You have hardly touched your violin in two weeks; I should love a little music, if you would be kind enough to indulge me. I am quite written out for the day, and shall do no more until tomorrow.’
'If I promised you complaisance, then I was a fool to so promise.' He sprang up, and moved to the window. 'I should never have made such a devil's bargain with you: I must have been out of my mind even to think of colluding in your destroying yourself with the damned stuff. For God's sake, Holmes, do not - do not take it. You know the wretched result: if you are despairing  now, you will be doubly despairing tomorrow: think on the painful sequelae, I beg you, and refrain.'
on the 24th February 1815, the look-out at Notre-Dame de la Garde signalled the three-masted ship, Pharaon, hailing from Smyrna, Trieste and Naples. As usual, a pilot vessel put off immediately to meet her, rounded the Château d’If, and went aboard the boat between Cape Morgion, and the Île de Ron . . .’
He looked hard at me, I think to determine if this was some jest. Then slowly, very slowly, he opened the case. What he thought to see, I knew not, but it was not that, for his brows drew together, and he looked first at the syringe and apparatus, then at me, then back at the case again. He took up the syringe, observed it closely, smelt it, and then laid it down beside the small strip of cloth I kept tucked under it. This he took up and twisted round his own arm, testing its strength before replacing it, and closing the case. ‘Holmes?’ was all he said.
For he had a knack, had Watson, of describing in vivid terms the trials of everyday life: he had even a certain vein of sardonic North Country humour. When we strolled together, arm in arm through the streets of our great city, and I murmured my deductions to him, he found ample material in them for his tales. He was a great romantic though; not a story but saw some fair-curled, blue-eyed damsel in distress, rescued by a brave heart. In a moment of madness, I once considered begging him to write a different object for his affections, but it passed, and I renewed my guard on tongue and eye. Still, his romances brought in the shillings, and occasionally a sovereign. He wrote pretty constantly through the summer, but he had also other work in increasing quantities.
‘They’re more like the rough trade, Mr Holmes. Billy Clarke can neither read nor write: what would he do with a song sheet, now? But they’ll take a walk with a man for a few shillings, or a cab ride to the Botanic Gardens. We all know where to go.’
I pulled away from him. ‘That is not fair, to reproach me with that. Have I not repented in dust and ashes for that I alerted Professor Moriarty to the fact we had smoked him out? I was a fool then, I admit it, just as much as Mycroft was for showing his hand to the criminals so plainly. And if anything happened to you – if I risked you, my all – I would never forgive myself, so there is no danger of me playing the fool again.’
‘And if we replace religion with the Darwinian model, it seems to lead to a grim end,’ he observed. ‘All nature striving for survival, at the expense of others. Red in tooth and claw. What of goodness then, Holmes? What reason can there be for selflessness, if it brings no advantage to the individual who practises it?’ What moral code can a man follow without a deity?’
‘Then I shall endeavour to suit your inclination to my duty, and my obligations to your desires. In any case, it is not upon us, and may not be. For all the sabre-rattling I do not entirely think that the great powers wish for war. May we come to happier days then, and peace, at last, in our times.’
‘My dear fellow, you have been invaluable to me in this as in many other cases, and I beg that you will forgive me if I have seemed to play a trick upon you. In truth, it was partly for your own sake that I did it, and it was my appreciation of the danger which you ran which led me to come down and examine the matter for myself. Had I been with Sir Henry and you it is confident that my point of view would have been the same as yours, and my presence would have warned our very formidable opponents to be on their guard. As it is, I have been able to get about as I could not possibly have done had I been living in the Hall, and I remain an unknown factor in the business, ready to throw in all my weight at a critical moment.’
A Case of Identity allows for the introduction of "if we could fly out of that window hand in hand", one of Conan Doyle's indications of the closeness of the relationship between Holmes and Watson.
‘There is a new artist exhibiting today: Forbes, of Newlyn. His ‘Fish Sale on a Cornish Beach’ might suit you better. Its weather does not appear to be such as would make you desire the sea. But do go and look at something, Watson. I must observe, and cannot do it with you hovering at my shoulder.’
Sending the telegram was the first thing I did on arrival. Then at least Watson would know where to contact me.
I had hardly dared to raise my eyes to his face as he entered, so miserable, so sorry and shamed did I feel, but the sharpness of his tone surprised me and observing him properly, I saw that he had not slept either - he was heavy-eyed and wan - nor had he changed from the clothes in which he had gone out the night before. His shoes were muddy - Brick Lane, Whitechapel, I saw at a glance - and there was blood on his left shirt cuff: as I noticed it, so did he, and grimaced, pushing up his jacket sleeve to roll the stained shirt away from his skin.
We had been at odds for some weeks, for he had been stern with me over the drug since we returned from Scotland - I had had one long, continual struggle with it since my return from France in the April, sometimes able to omit it entirely for a week, but more often taking it at least twice or thrice in seven days – but he was sterner still since I had begun, after my conversation with Mycroft, to take it much more regularly. My heart was sore for it, for John could be distant when he chose, distant with a gentle, unvarying courtesy that chilled and set me at a far remove, hence the formality of my request to him to accompany me to King’s Pyland. I had been by no means certain that he would want to, so constrained had our manners been to each other, and so clear was his displeasure at the injections of the cocaine that I had used daily for relief from the pressing tensions of mind and body.
'In this case, truth is, indeed, stranger than fiction: I could not use that in a story without incurring the censure of every right-thinking reader - they would be writing to my publisher to complain of my unrealistic motive for the separation. And yet, there are many eccentrics amongst our nobility: there was that Duke of Portland who died nearly a decade ago now, with his underground palace beneath Welbeck Abbey, and his strange habits of seclusion - '
‘Dumas,’ I had no spirit for the reading, but when we read Dumas we sat close together and I needed him near me that night, a shield against what the morning might bring. ‘Please, Watson. If you would be so kind as to fetch the book, I shall rearrange myself here and make room for you. You will sit with me, will you not?’
‘I think it will be impossible to determine how grave the situation is until we have all the available information,’ I told him, as the door was opened for us. ‘Johnson: thank you. What, or who, do you have for us today?’
Watson promised earnestly to return the book after reading it, ‘by all means, Sir, and Holmes and I will peruse it together; for as you say, a good book is best enjoyed in company. And I am sorry we are unlikely to meet again. I have much enjoyed our intercourse. I honour your courage and openness about these issues, both with what you term ‘Uranian love’ and the position of women, and only wish it were easier for those like you to speak out. It grieves my heart to see so many good men and women deprived of joy, of love. If – when – society is changed, there will, we must hope, be no more fear, and all may love as they wish.’
He cleared his throat. ‘Nor I –  and I would not wish to be with any other. I have never – I have never understood why it is said that many people dislike the strong, and sometimes painful sentiment one experiences listening to Wagner. But for me, it is a catharsis: he releases emotions I scarce knew I had, and their echoes remain with me for hours. He thrills me as no other composer has ever done.’
‘Well you are my Pythias, are you not?’ I could not think of anything else to say. No one had ever defended me as he did, and I did not entirely know how to feel about it other than that it made my heart flutter, and desire spark along my every nerve.
‘It is impeccable, Watson. I will finish it: tell me if I have translated correctly. “my love for you is another love: my father died, and I did not die; as for you, if you were to die, I would die.” So hers was a primrose love also, it would seem.’
‘You should not distress yourself. You were barely more than a child yourself, and then you were at school. It is not your fault that you did not know. I do not blame you for anything.’
He took the paper he had written on, and walked to the fire, dropped the sheet into the flames and watched while it blackened and fell to ash. 'Excellent: we understand each other, then. Such help as may be afforded to Dr Watson will be so afforded. But you must have a care: my powers are not paramount, and in some cases I cannot intervene at all. Meanwhile, I thank you most sincerely for your kindness towards my nephew. He is very dear to me.' His mouth had a wry twist. 'He must marry, of course, to make his way in the world, as we all must, sacrificing to the goddess Ydgrun.' He smiled faintly. 'You do not understand the reference? I recommend the purchase of Mr Samuel Butler's book, Erewhon, wherein you will find her. She rules our lives, Propriety, and more so in the last three years. At least Percy is as devoted to Miss Harrison as Reggie Brett is to his gentle Nellie. They are fortunate to be able to -  if only I could, myself - but it is of no matter, no matter.'
J. D. Singh College in Karachi still exists. Moses Jackson, the man A.E. Housman, author of ‘A Shropshire Lad’, loved for his whole life with an unwanted and unrequited devotion was the Principal there when Holmes was visiting.
He laughed at my blushing – I had felt the hot tide of blood rise into my cheeks – and rose to take me by the hand and draw me to the sofa. ‘Come, sit with me. What is it you wish to say?’
Whether Mary Holder were complicit or no, I could see that Moran might choose to pursue her: she was a beautiful creature, dark of eye and fair of skin. I watched, teeth gritted, while Watson charmed her account of events from her with the gentle courtesy he knew so well how to employ. Sickening at length of drawing room sugar, I left him to his byplay, and betook myself to the grounds, where I very soon saw what I wanted and needed to see. When I returned, it was to sweep Watson up with me and inform the master of the house that we would be returning to London, and he might call upon me betimes in the morning for his answer to the riddle. I was surprised that Watson made no demur at being reft from the girl’s company – she really was very pretty, judged by any usual standard of beauty - and more surprised, as we travelled home on the train, by his complaint that I had had all the fun of playing at discovery in the snow, and he had been left to make commonplace conversation, ‘when I could, my dear Holmes, have been out on the hunt with you.’
‘Yes,’ I said. ‘It is too thin. But I cannot think how to . . .’ I re-arranged the papers she had moved, and frowned as direfully as I could at her. ‘Thank you, Mrs Hudson.’
‘Better not: it needs air, and not constriction. You will be black and blue in the morning, even with the arnica. And you were in more danger than you know: had he crushed your larynx sufficiently there might have been internal swelling that would have prevented you from breathing.’ His fingers mapped the contours of my throat with the gentlest of touches. ‘Here, and here. A very little pressure would do it: pray do not risk yourself in such a way again, even if I am nearby. He turned away for a moment, and I could not see his face. ‘Need I say it again? You are very dear to me; I could not bear to lose you. Give me your wrist, my dear chap. It is a little swollen: I shall call for some ice, and we will wrap it cold.’
‘There must have been some conspiracy, and Eccles was to be used as an alibi: what reason else to invite him down with no attempt at true hospitality, only to -  to wake him and make a point of the time? You see I am learning from you, my dear Holmes. He was an invert, of course: almost certainly the reason Garcia chose him. I imagine what Eccles did not tell us is what occurred after dinner.’
‘I will not leave you,’ he whispered to me later, as we lay together for comfort. ‘I will not leave you, my dear. I am your man, for weal or woe.’
Afterwards, though, it was I who flagged. My trouble was simple: the diminution, the almost complete deprivation of my morphia dose. It had reached a point where I could sleep without it, but at the price of vivid, detailed erotic dreams, leading inevitably to nocturnal pollution. I found also that, as if punishing me for the long years I had denied it, my too-responsive member, no longer restrained by morphia, would tempt me too frequently to desire manual stimulation and release. I did not give in to it, for I knew that medical professionals inveighed against the practice of onanism as extremely deleterious to health. I had been well schooled in the appalling effects of self-abuse, and as I valued my mind more than anything else, I refused to indulge. I had no wish to become one of those mentally enfeebled, pallid specimens whose sad addiction is plain to all.
‘ – very well: her conversation, although always edifying, can cause a yawn or two, but the substance is of such sense and intelligence, that one forgives her the length. In any case, pray continue, now you have vented your spleen. I believe we should take a walk this afternoon, my dear fellow to blow the cobwebs away, and might I enquire whether you are in need of a wholesome dose this evening? You are never more acerbic than when nature is recalcitrant - ’
'I am not a - a wife - a 'weißling,' even, as your colleague Ulrichs would put it, to be coddled and petted and cherished.’ It was hard for me to explain how his 'cherishing’ affected me when my unruly heart leapt at every indication - and there were many indications, subtle, delicate, unobtrusive, and perfectly adapted to my needs - of his care for me. The man breathed loving kindness, and without it I would have been, as I had just told him, desolate -  yet something in me, some ingrate, flinty knot or burr in my soul, would not submit itself wholly to the sovereign alkahest of his solvent touch. Would not allow itself to be dissolved, unravelled - or resected even, as was the Gordian knot at the last by Alexander's blade. It insisted, maugre my better self, that it would not loosen or melt. And all I could say at that moment under its crude prompting was, banal, ridiculous and unkind, that I was not a wife to be cherished. Whether he could parse my meaning for me I had no idea, but I, so skilled at the analysis of others, could by no means understand myself. He did not even treat me 'as a wife' - or as a woman, for of all men I ever knew, my Watson was chivalrous to all alike, no matter who they were, whom he felt merited his care. Whether he genuinely saw no distinction I could not tell: he made none, in any case.
I drank, mouthing clumsily at the glass which he held to my lips. The initial stimulation of the opium had worn off, and I was entering the drowsy phase, that dream-ridden haven where men sink, and rise no more.
There was a pause in the flow of cases, and for a week or more, I heard nothing from Lestrade. The weather cleared for a day, then worsened again, and with it my mood. I wanted to be out, out and doing. I needed action; the charm of the chase. Even if there were no chase, I wanted to be out with Watson.
Sutton proved unhelpful that night, and since he had not told me the truth I left him to come to his senses. The note from Trevelyan the following morning – hurriedly pencilled on a torn scrap of paper, the irregular letters betraying great unease and distress, sent me post haste to Watson’s room, where I tenderly observed his peaceful sleep for a few moments before waking him in our usual fashion. He was worried as we hastened to Brook Street.
‘I need nothing. Will you tell me your story, Lady Laura? Leave nothing out, I beg you, that may be of importance. I know that the Earl of Durham was married more than two years ago now, but I have no knowledge of events subsequent to that marriage. Nor do I know anything of his unfortunate bride.’
‘Then why are we doing it?’ he asked me wearily, as, both clad in nondescript garments, we trudged through the streets to another meeting with our cheerful young prostitute. ‘Why, Holmes, are we engaged in this deeply sordid affair? Surely there are other matters more worthy of our time and attention? Could not Lestrade do it?’
