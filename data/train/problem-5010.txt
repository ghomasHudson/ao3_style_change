The real estate agent was far too bubbly for Mary’s taste, but Joe seemed to be enjoying the tour.
“He does not anymore, no, but he did then, I could… I could tell.”
Dean reaches out his hands and puts them on the arms of the chair, millimeters away from Cas’s. He can feel the heat, the electricity radiating between them, and he yearns to reach out. But he doesn’t, because this time his actions are going to be words, like they should have been all those years ago. He should’ve told him to stay. He should’ve recognized that sometimes quitting takes strength, and maybe they should’ve quit together. But he’s here, in front of him, and Dean will be damned if he loses the chance to tell him it even once more.
Mary finally found the perfect sedative. One that kept her victims out for just long enough to be dragged to a chair and tied with expert knots she learned from a public computer’s YouTube. She got the blood bags she ordered from a slightly less than reputable site she had delivered to a P.O. Box in another state.
Dean wonders how she can be so calm under the circumstances. “You were too obvious.”
“You are back in the investigation?” Sam notices he has to calm his breathing.
Lisa winces as one of the movers hits the couch against the frame of the front door, making a small notch.
? Did Dean tell you he died?” Eileen blurted without thinking, because how could Dean do that to Lisa? But she should have known better, because Dean, for all his faults, would have never done that.
“Charlie, look, we’ve been through everything with this chick and nothing has caught her, we thought maybe you could.” If anyone could help them catch Bloody Mary, it’d be Charlie and he honestly didn’t know why they didn’t think about it years ago.
“So, if I were defending Cas, I would say this signature is not his style at all. I mean, the perp got the nickname because the crime was distinctively feminine, right?”
“What are my intentions towards your brother?”
Cas is putting on his collar just as a knock is made on the door to his rooms.
“Yeah, he did. But uh, I need you to tell it.”
“Not from a lack of love, Dean, from a lack of faith.”
“Dude.”
“Trying to frame Cas with that hair.” That was what led them to her after all, the frame job that was so obviously a set up.
Lisa begins to play with the cross around her neck.
Benny nods as he places his hand on the counter.
The priest looks at him sincerely, and Ben feels kinda like he shouldn’t have asked that.
Benny stands to get up and Dean follows suit.
Dean sees it, he sees the tells in Cas’s averted glance, at the looks of hope drained from his face, and he knows, he knows that whatever Cas is about to say probably will be the answer to everything. The reason he left, the reason he didn’t fight, the reason he wouldn’t fight, and Dean was terrified. He stood, stock still, because Cas, fuck it, Cas was about to spill his guts and Dean was worried that he would no longer be able to hold onto the bit of anger that kept Cas just out of reach.
“You know I love you. You know leaving was the greatest regret of my life. If I do not have a chance to make it up to you that will be my second biggest regret. However, if we want to catch Bloody Mary…”
The office door is suddenly swung open. A tall, looming man stands in the doorway, hands awkwardly by his side, his mouth hanging slightly open at the sight in front of him. He clears his throat slightly, as the two men didn’t notice his presence somehow. Which, to be fair, they didn’t - not immediately anyway.
She pulls a tiny portion of her bottom lip in her mouth and smiles, creating a somewhat fearsome illusion. He wondered how such a sexy look on one could be terrifying on another. She knows there is so much more to this, so much more than this priest knows, and she loves having the upper hand.
Cas plays with his wedding band as it reflects the light of the early morning sun. He snuggles in closer to Dean, their bare hips touching, allowing plenty of extra room for their dog, Miracle, in their Queen size bed.
“Gladly.”
“This obsession does not lend itself to any rational thought, which explains the contents you find in there. Yes, it is disturbing that the person who made the entries took delight in killing the perpetrator in front of their child, but at that point they only had one goal in mind - to kill that transgressor. I am sorry you saw that, and read it, and I am so sorry it disturbed you, but I do not think there is anything to worry about, if that helps.”
“God?”
“You too.”
He was beautiful.
While he is still under, Mary finds a vein on his right arm and sticks her needle into it, beginning to fill the first bag. She gets the Styrofoam cooler she bought and begins to fill it with ice from the family’s freezer.
Dean is sitting at his desk at the office when he gets an incoming email from Charlie.
They all shake hands.
Dean knows he’s right and he feels like an idiot for even asking. He wants to be near Cas, but yeah, the man was right, it was not the best time. But he couldn’t help but feel rejected.
“You’ve called out his name every night for three years! That’s more than a breakup.”
“It was in your honor.”
Joe notes her good humor.
Dean is unable to keep it in any longer and he socks Benny in the jaw.
“Yeah, something like that.” They were kinda gross at times.
Cas is pacing, his hands wringing behind his back.
“Dude. Joe and Mary.” Dean gets excited with the possibility of a lead as he looks up their names in the University database.
“How’d you stay so ripped man, god damn.” It was an accident and Dean swallowed the lump that developed in his throat from his incriminating, and revealing, words.
“You said there was an article about Cas that kinda happened around the same time, right?”
“Okay, so, if the men were abusers, and Cas was opening up a women’s shelter, this might be incendiary.”
Castiel panics at the silence, he strains to hear a noise. He finds a certain type of relief when she speaks.
Cas glances to the side before focusing on his coffee.
Mary shrugs as she drags the ice chest to the coffee table. She sits across from the man on the couch, her legs straight in front of her, with her hands folded neatly on top of her lap. Her eyes roam to the half-filled blood bag, and his eyes follow, causing a panic strain against the ropes once more.
“I wish to be better.”
“And this is the lovely veranda.”
No wonder that Melanie Hawkins liked him so much.
Cas nods as he leaves the office.
“I do. You will be a wonderful father.”
This time, although no one probably knew it as of yet, the news involved
“None other. You know, I legally changed my name to that, I liked it so much.”
Dean scrunches his brow questioningly and begins to open it.
*******
“That’s what lust is though, isn’t it? The thought?”
, Dean thought, but decided against speaking on that too.
“Will do.”
Wrath
Cas nods, making sure his mixture doesn’t scorch.
Dean smiles, a beautiful thing, and Cas knows his mission was accomplished - and any other mission could go to Hell.
Dean was sipping his coffee, getting ready to head into the office when the headline caught him.
“What the fuck for?” With every word, he tried escaping by sheer brute force, Mary rather enjoyed the display.
*******
“You… you gave me something to have faith in, Lis. You, you saved me from drinking myself into an early grave. And I owe you my life, truly. You and Ben… you two mean so much to me, and the last thing… the absolute last thing I ever wanna do is hurt either one of you.”
Mary bites the corner of her bottom lip in thought as she looks to her husband, who is taking tiny nibbles from his dry, cough-inducing, toast.
Cas sips the all too perfect coffee gingerly as he pursues the community’s news on his tablet. His heart stills when he comes across an all too familiar murder.
His face lights up and he swallows the toast quickly, prompting him to take a rather hefty swing of orange juice before speaking.
“Whatcha got, man?”
“Look Benny, if the love of my life had split personalities, I would’ve noticed.”
“Let’s say the perp was following him.”
, not just to spite
The laugh this time was cold, and Cas’s heart felt as if it were constricting, like it were being held in some type of precarious vice.
Mary quietly answers. “Draining your blood.”
“Mom says we’re leaving in thirty minutes, with or without you.”
“It does?” Dean hears slight relief in Cas’s voice.
They were shattered and built back at the altar of one another.
Dean thought about how many pornos started out this way.
John Winchester is suddenly arisen from his television induced slumber by the smell of smoke. He runs upstairs to see his eldest son trying to battle the flames to get into the room where his little brother is wailing in his crib.
Cas hangs his head in embarrassment. “I apologize, I feel that is inappropriate.”
Mary nods, noncommittal. Mary rarely committed to anything - except her calling. She tenses ever so slightly as the mother and son make their way toward them.
“Myself.”
Dean huffs out a laugh, fond memories pervading his thoughts.
“Of course. Let me know if there is any other way I can help.”
Dean watches as Cas begins pacing.
“Yeah.” He smiles crookedly at her, the left side of his lip curling up. She thinks that’s why she fell in love with him – that lip that reminded her of the Elvis posters her mother had hung up around the house. Well, that and his lovely way of thinking that always surprised her, always made her feel life was more interesting than she allowed it to be.
“You know, Padre, my soul ain’t that lost.”
“Lis, I…” He doesn’t even know where to begin. How does one begin to describe that kind of love? An all consuming love that invaded every sense he had ever had. It was like there was nothing before Cas, and… He hated himself right then, because he was gonna think, nothing after. And how could he even think that? The beautiful woman in front of him dropped everything to cradle his pathetic ass, and he thought his time with her was nothing? Fuck, he did not deserve her.
“We need Charlie to get their current address cause they haven’t moved in yet.”
“Mornin’, sunshine.”
Bobby nods. “It takes a hell of a long time to go about murder the way she done, Dean. It wasn’t Cas. All right? Now you have faith in your boy, and you get him the hell out of this mess, you understand me?”
Mary looked up at the ceiling. “I suppose because he felt it was right.”
Dean walks into the sanctuary, unable to find Cas. He wanders throughout the Church and finds him in his office, papers strewn everywhere, a tablet with another murder on top. He knew about it, Benny called him on it about ten minutes prior, but he just wanted to see Cas first. Hell, he needed to see Cas first.
And they both know they probably never will.
“So much better than a pair of boxers.”
Eileen signs for Sam to take this one.
Benny sits down, and Dean takes his seat once again.
“That is a difficult question, Ben. From my experience, I have noticed that when people are happy they generally work well together - they approach things as a team, they communicate, they are willing to accept one another’s flaws, and they don’t try to change each other.”
“Yeah, I’ll miss the hell outta them man, not gonna lie, but you, damn Cas, you’re it for me, man.” Leave it to Cas to care about other people more than his own happiness.
Castiel licks his suddenly dry bottom lip and speaks, his mind wandering, but trying to stay on the situation at hand.
She looks back to her article after taking another sip of coffee to be interrupted by her husband yet again.
“Father?”
“It’s simple really. You’re a terrible human.”
Cas thinks of a letter he burned on their gas stove. A letter Dean never saw that was addressed - in exquisite handwriting - to Agent Castiel Novak.
Castiel, emissary of the Lord, thinks of his dream, the memory of Dean’s lips on his, and an emotion comes through on his occasionally stoic face. He wants to say many things to Dean, wants to offer for Dean to take them off for him if they’re so ugly, wants to slip back into their flirty banter that always ended with them in bed, or on the couch, or on the floor a couple times.
Cas smiles, “I would be honored, Lisa.”
Cas shakes his head. “No, of course not.”
“I said, I have killed, and I require absolution.”
“Hi, I’m uh Dean, and this is Lisa.”
“You ain’t wrong.”
Dean nods sadly. Sadly because he knew what would happen when he got back to Lis, knew what would have to transpire, and although he knew, he still didn’t want to hurt her. Or Ben.
She smiles fondly and hands him the tablet in her hand.
Sam scoffs in disbelief.
as soon as their eyes connected. When their hands touched, it was as if Castiel’s organs were on fire. Mere skin to skin contact made him feel alive again, and he wanted Dean in every way imaginable.
They were each other's heaven and hell - the other’s salvation and damnation. The cooling came after the heat, where calm tamed their wild hearts only to place them in the throes of passion once more. They could no longer keep any chasteness in them, for their want and their
Cas looks once more to him.
He places the body in a “T” position, the arms splayed out to the side, her feet together.  He returns the knife, wiped clean by Mary’s gown, into a pocket from his vest and pulls out a vial from another. He empties some of the contents of the vial onto his thumb and draws a cross with ashes.
“I love you both so, so much.”
“Typical.”
Dean nods, his eyes with a tinge of pain. He can’t help but think of Cas - of how the accident made a man who wanted nothing more than to help humanity turn into a shell who feared the world. To make amends.
She trodded down the hall in her vintage white nightgown, wiping sleep from her eyes. She shook her head in disbelief when she saw her husband was already in Sam’s nursery, bending over his crib. Very unlike him, but she was more than willing to take the respite.
“Mary, please.” His tone is pleading and he hates himself for it. Not now, why now?
Ben breaks Dean from his thoughts suddenly, and Dean is once more pulled into the moment.
Cas looks down at his shoes before looking back up at her. “Only apple pie.”
Cas wakes violently. Sweat trickles down his bare back and he looks over, expecting Dean to be there. He’s not. Of course he’s not. He left suddenly after their hands touched, mumbling about how he had to get beer and he was already late. Cas implored him to stay long enough for the priest to pick a bouquet of flowers for Lisa. Dean agreed, but went inside the church to go to the bathroom.
Sam looks at the first paper. Dean’s eyes go from him to the computer screen.
“Untie me, you ingrate.”
“We’re gonna be dads.”
“I have no more plans to kill.”
Their stroll is in silence, not for want of anything to say, but of a coming together of a type of peace. A peace they only felt in one another’s presence. Castiel stops below an apple tree, and extends a hand to pick a low hanging ripe fruit. Dean stops beside him as their hands brush against one another, and for one blessed moment, in that garden - time stopped.
Mary walks into her office to find it occupied by none other than Father Castiel Novak. She shuts the door behind her and sits in her chair, facing him.
Cas places his head in his hand.
“Uh, how he always is.”
Mary shakes her hand as well, smiling benevolently all the while. She shakes her head fondly as she notices Joe’s tell-tell signs of finding a woman attractive. Joe blushes slightly and looks down at his shoes, it’s such a tell, and Mary thinks it’s somewhat adorable. Lisa was a lovely woman.
Benny kept looking down, his eyes unable to meet those of his friend.
Dean leaves the room only to run into the rather large frame of Benny.
Sam sighs, he tries to allow a type of calm anchor him, knowing this wasn’t going to be an easy conversation.
“I appreciate it, thank you.” He did appreciate the gesture, being handcuffed from behind was painful.
“Thank you for your help, Ben. This is ready to go into the oven, and I will finish up the dishes.”
Cas laughs, a beautiful mirthful thing.
Ben nods as Cas sets some Granny Smith apples in front of him with a vegetable peeler. Ben begins to peel the apples as Cas readies the sauce they will cook in. Ben watches with interest as Father Novak seems to know where everything is.
Lisa looks up as his phone rings, and Dean answers already knowing who it is.
“Yes Dean I ‘got it’.”
Sam laughs slightly, he knew that on a very personal level.
“Shut up and kiss me.”
Benny picks it up with a pair of tweezers and puts it into an evidence bag.
She fixes him with an icy stare.
Yup, they did.
“Yeah, come in kid.”
Dean awakens to a hand on his shoulder and tears wetting his pillow. He turns to his girlfriend, who wipes his tears with her gentle hand.
Castiel and Dean moved from the bedroom with a bed in too accessible a location to the Church’s office.
Dean nods as he kisses her hand.
A faint smile crosses Castiel’s lips, for he knows her sins are benign, and slightly amusing.
He remembered being there for Claire’s birthday. He remembers that Cas was in charge of bringing the surprise cake that made Claire roll her eyes. And Cas did go alone if he remembered right, but he wasn’t gone for over an hour was he? And that wasn’t enough time to bleed out a person was it? Dean didn’t go because he decided to make the kid watch
She notices his breathing regulates as he examines the blade.
Sam knows Lisa is kind, generous, warm, and loving. She is everything anyone could ever want, and yet Sam knew she never felt she was enough for Dean - probably because of Cas.
John pushes him back abruptly and forces himself into the room, in the nick of time to see his wife in the shape of a cross on the floor. He grabs Sammy from the crib, places him into Dean’s arms, and yells:
Cas hesitates and Dean watches his movements with piqued interest.
“Dean…”
“Uh, well, do you know much about that?” Ben thinks this was probably a bad idea.
“I uh… I think we need to talk about Dean.”
“Okie dokie. Here’s what I’ll do. I’ll make a database of all the victim’s contacts, all their contacts, and see if there’s a pattern, but it’ll take a while.”
Dean knows the tells as he knows every scar on his own body.
“All right, as we both know, my love is not the same as whole.”
“I still do.”
“What the fuck?” She hears mumbled from the inside.
Benny shrugs and hands the bag off to a forensic tech.
“Bless me Father, for I have sinned. This is my first time in confession.”
Cas sighs as he nods. “I understand Ben, but the writings in that journal do not seem at all to be parallel with the morals of Dean.”
Mary watches as Susan Struthers, Shenandoah Valley’s local real estate agent extraordinaire, leads them throughout the three bedroom ranch style home. Susan, as she insisted to be called, was everything Mary disliked - fake. Mary figured everything the woman did was for show. She waltzed through the house in her bright yellow dress with an oversized red bead necklace, pointing to all the “upgrades” the house has - such as granite countertops. Maybe they were upgrades, Mary didn’t know - nor did she care. She did admire the sealed tile flooring - it would be oh so easy to clean blood up from that. Not that she shit where she ate or anything.
*******
But the priest and the FBI agent know that right now at least, they can’t have it - that carnal knowledge they had once shared countless times.
“Benny, I have Benny?  Well, he ain’t exactly active duty now is he?”
“Apparently.”
“I have good life with a warm woman and a screaming kid that I couldn’t love any more. I have a boat I take out fishing on the weekends. I run 5k’s every so often ‘cause I want to show people I can. I ain’t got a bad thought for the man whose stray bullet caught me in the leg. Hell, I’m just grateful to you for saving my life.”
*******
Joe shakes his head as he hands her a plate.
“How can I help you Ben?”
“Eh, strictly PG.”
Castiel does not remember what he spoke on. He thinks he remembers mechanically reading from his notes, perhaps something about kindness? That seemed right. That must have been it. Words left his lips freely, but he did not care what they were. The only thing he was focused on was the exquisite beauty of Dean Winchester. Castiel remembered every curve of his body, but he felt the pull to his soul more than anything else.
“Wasp spray.” She nods her head in understanding, as she pointedly looks away from the object of his indication.
“You were my brother for a decade. You almost killed my blood brother when you left, you don’t get to be so fucking flippant with me.”
“Hey.”
Mary laughs, and in spite of various types of warnings Cas has been trained to detect, he finds himself drawn to her all the more.
God, how Dean loved that man. He looks to the ground. “But uh, what if I wasn’t with him all the time?”
Cas rolls his eyes as he begins kissing his husband’s neck. Dean’s body was his altar and he placed his worship in a holy place.
“Hey yourself.”
“I know, Castiel,  I know.” He tries again, because at this point it could only help.
Dean stands as he feels Lisa’s hand on his bicep. He still has not caught his breath fully and his eyes are plastered on Cas’s – his home.
“You’re so good, babe.”
The next toast is offered by Sam.
“The neighbors here are just wonderful, aren’t they?” Susan more or less cooed, pouncing upon the chance to highlight the doe eyed lady’s appearance of niceness.
“Perhaps more than you think.”
*******
“I knew the moment this kid came in with his mess of hair that was not combed into regulation, and gardenias that Dean was gonna be hopeless. Just that kid’s type. Only he wasn’t, not to Dean yet. I knew. I’ve seen them save each other countless times over the years, and all I can say is thank God we finally made it here.”
Cas laughs slightly. “Ah, the forbidden fruit.”
Dean chuckles as he leans over to kiss his husband.
Dean nods. “Yeah, but he ain’t ever gonna forgive himself.”
Benny leans over the desk, his palms on either side of the computer monitor. “I don’t think you understand just how sick your boy is. He thinks he is innocent. Ya understand?”
“Our meals usually led to other things.”
“There is no higher purpose in killing.”
“Your inaction caused my action, not to mention the actions of your beloved. And, as I will not harm anyone else, you must stay silent, priest.”
“That would be a way to remove the temptation, yes?”
“I am so sorry Benny, for… for everything. I know now I can do nothing to atone.”
Once everyone has gone to their respective homes, hotels, and churches, Dean turns to Lisa with a smile. They are in the kitchen, cleaning up, very domestic, very usual, when in reality it was everything but.
Benny laughs.
She pries her eyes away from the screen to look into the brown ones she has looked into for three years now.
Dean looks to her, momentarily stopping his fingers from moving.
“Yeah, okay. So, it hit a little different, huh?”
Joe smiles and nods in agreement before he begins to peel an orange, the aromatic spray filling the senses of Mary, throwing her into a repressed - but never truly forgotten - memory.
“I look forward to it.”
He gets out of bed and pulls down his pajama pants.
Guilt runs throughout Castiel’s veins like lead, and he can no longer sit still for fear he will never be able to get back up from the weight of it all.
As soon as they are out of hearing distance, Mary looks to the agent.
“She was a pain. We are set to move this weekend though, she is very efficient.”
Dean scoffs good naturedly as he looks at himself in the mirror.
The real estate agent takes it upon herself to introduce everyone, because she was Susan Struthers after all - and as such she had a reputation to uphold in this little community of hers.
“You wouldn’t understand, you couldn’t. What do you know about being at the mercy of another? Hum? Having to endure every abuse just because they were stronger than you?”
“So, I left, thinking Dean didn’t love me any more anyway. He said he did, he said we would work through it, but I… I couldn’t believe it, he didn’t make me believe it. The empty bottles of Jack didn’t make me believe it. So, I made myself believe he would be better off without me, that he wanted me gone with each rugged attempt at love making, at each sound of disgust when I would have a case file out. I hated myself, so I made myself believe Dean hated me too. I was too tired, too worn to truly realize he hated himself too.”
Ben’s hand shook slightly as he put the journal down. He knew this wasn’t Dean’s, it couldn’t be. Dean was only a kid then. Ben looks around, tucks the journal under his arm, goes to his room, and puts it under his mattress. He wonders if he should ask his mom or Dean about it.
Mary sighs and regrets not taping his mouth shut.
“Uh...yeah! The neighborhood has a pool! I’m stoked.”
“You see, when Marcy came into my office, I saw the thumbprint you left on her wrist. She thought she had covered it up, but my eyes are somewhat trained to see signs of abuse.”
He sighs and clasps his hands in his lap as if to pray.
He tries to piece together her life. What did she say? Her father was killed. Her father was killed in front of her. She had to go to various foster homes, and Cas assumed, from her words, she was abused.
“Will you and your husband be attending services once you move here?”
“Okay, so, let’s pull up Charlie’s info, the contacts. Yeah, sure they are from that college, but tons of people work at that college.”
After the movie about cartoon fish ends, Ben returns to his room and pulls the journal out from under his mattress. He can’t explain why he wants to look at it again, maybe he just wants to know.
Dean’s trembling hands drop the book and the letter and find their way around his husband’s neck.
“I mean, he ran errands and stuff, we weren’t glued together or nothing.”
“I do lament one thing, though.”
“We talked about this possibility before.”
Mary sighs and adjusts her glasses with a gloved hand. She gets up, crosses over to him, and expertly changes the blood bags.
“I did some investigation, you see, saw she was the beneficiary of your life insurance, and thought this would be the best way for her to succeed in life.”
Father Novak nods, and Ben can’t help but notice he looks… sad?
“Right, so uh, why Cas?”
“All you did Mary, or whatever your name is, is end up in a fucking jail cell. And it stops here. This fucked up cycle stops here.”
Dean licks his lower lip and Cas stills, his heartbeat increasing, afraid Dean is going to go for it, afraid that he himself will not be able to stop. But just as he has done for many years, Dean surprises him.
Dean nods. “Yeah, that was my dad, I uh, read about it in his journal. God, this is so fucked up. So what? Huh? You did this to torture me and Cas? All these years? And where did we get, huh? What did we change?”
*******
“Then he deserves to die.” It was said absolutely, because in her mind, it was.
“Will you ask Lisa to check on Joe from time to time? He… he could use someone like her.”
“I mean, these have got to be a close second.”
“Yes, typically.”
“Uh, well…” Sam hesitates, not knowing what to say or where to go. Technically this was Dean’s deal, and technically Dean and Cas did nothing wrong, but Lisa deserved to know. She deserved to know the shattered man she took in was eye fucking with the local priest. Okay, that was harsh. It was
Benny bends down to examine the body just a bit closer. Like all the others, it’s pale, and it’s a man, but unlike the others, this one has a loose hair on his head that does not match the others.
Mary smiles at him. “Did you know I went to confession earlier today?”
She notes how Joe blushes slightly as the mention of Lisa’s name.
Sam smirks and shakes his head fondly.
Cas tries to think quickly, ignoring the feelings of helplessness overcoming his every molecule. He should not be thinking of Dean now, it was not only inopportune, it was inappropriate, but this was their second chance of sorts and here
“Tell Ben he can always call me, okay?” He hoped he would always be in contact with the kid.
*******
He knew she was following him. It was the only thing that made everything make sense. But the dates didn’t matter, because...
Lisa always listened to the news in the morning and he usually ignored it - for various reasons.
“I don’t have the answer, Ben, I wish I did. What I do know is that your mom is a wonderful and loving woman. I have rarely seen a light as bright as hers. She is kind, considerate, caring, and warm. I also know Dean is trying his best. But as far as happiness, I do not know. Sometimes, all we can do is try our best in a world where it is far too easy to do our worst.”
Mary was not a small woman by any means and had many a practice dragging burly men around their homes, but it was never what one might call easy. She rolls her head back and forth, cracking her neck, waiting for the man to wake up, tied to the chair he was currently residing in.
Sam looked appalled.
“I know you were a federal agent, Father Novak. You were on my case for a while. We became good friends I think.”
Father Novak agreed to sit with Ben on a park bench. It was after their talk in the kitchen that Ben felt the priest would be a good confidante for this journal. Ben needed to place it into someone else’s hands.
Ben stopped reading, put the journal down on the table in front of him for a couple seconds before picking it back up. He noticed the asterisk.
Without thinking, because why would he, Cas begins to strip while Dean is in the bedroom. Dean tries to look at the wall, but catches a glimpse of Cas’s reflection in the mirror and notices very old, very worn, very unattractive boxers.
“Are we going to discuss it from this position, or…” Cas really needed Dean off the floor somewhere a safe distance away.
This didn’t mean anything though,  the breaks were never that long, and he still didn’t have the contact list. Cas knew these men were abusers, no way in hell he would randomly kill. So these contacts were important, and surely they would have no connection to Cas whatsoever.
Dean finds him in the garden, as he knew he would. He watches him for a moment before coming up behind him.
Cas tries to hide the knowledge he was far too aware of and Dean far too ignorant.
Mary shakes her head. “I helped people, I stopped people from being hurt anymore.”
“We gotta get going, just wanted to say hi, and possibly welcome you to the neighborhood.” Lisa turns around, stops, then suddenly turns back around. “Oh, and you are more than welcome to stop by to our BBQ tonight, around seven?”
“I love you too, Dean.”
“Yes. I am a trusted confidante.” She smiles at him, red lipstick framing too white teeth.
Sam and Eileen share another look. Sam’s stomach falls. It was so much worse than he knew. This woman, this beautiful woman in front of him, dropped whatever she was holding onto to take care of his drunk mess of a brother and help him become human once more. She thought Dean was a widower, that he was bereaved, and in a way, maybe he was.
“Techy?”
“Ashes to ashes.” He mutters, his voice somehow even colder than before.
“Why… why me?”
“Yes, there are Scriptures that can lead one to believe that. However, I feel we are beings with souls and a human nature. Our actions are what matter. Yes, thoughts can lead to actions, but we are not responsible for the thoughts alone, we are responsible for our actions – what type of fruit we bear.”
Dean only remembers watching pale pink lips and azure eyes.
Dean sits up and rubs the back of his neck, which was cramped from last night’s stay on the couch. He couldn’t say he blamed Lisa for sending him there.
Benny plops the DNA report unceremoniously onto Dean’s desk.
Sam nods, smiles sadly, and begins. He knew he had too, because he knew Dean wouldn’t.
She scoffs, “Or
She found herself smiling at his reference. “And you are no Montgomery Clift.”
Ben looks to the side before taking the used dishes to the sink. “I don’t know, I kinda wonder if Mom and Dean are happy.” He runs warm water onto the cutting board and bowl.
Fucking hell. His knees become weak and Cas intuitively holds him up with a strong grip, an imperceptible motion to anyone but them.
Dean finds a small smile on the right side of his lips, in spite of everything. This was the philosophical Cas he could never get enough of - the one who thought of angels while looking at the Ocean.
Benny nods as they walk out of the church into the waiting car.
She wants to hate him, wants to dislike him for what he put Dean through.  Lisa remembers Dean standing on her porch, eyes red, bloodshot, and empty. She remembers letting him in, holding him, kissing him, telling him everything would be okay. She remembers how the priest’s name has been screamed out every night for the past three years, bringing wet wash cloths to wipe off Dean’s sweat soaked body, oh how she wanted to hate Castiel.
Cas gingerly places the letter back into the front page of the book and places the book in Dean’s nightstand drawer.
“Not if I kill you.”
Fuck! Confession. Whoever did this confessed to Cas. Jesus!
Ben nods as he peels the last apple. He begins to slice it into thin strips, putting the strips into the lemon water once more.
Mary scowls as she fights Dean’s grasp, but the bastard was too strong for her to break free. She hated him and she fought with everything she could, but the man wouldn’t budge. God, how she hated him.
He would, she knew that.
Ben nods as Cas begins to fill the pie plate. “Yeah, that’s uh, deep.”
Benny hands him a bag, and Cas pulls a couple of hairs out of his head to stick in it. He seals it, writes on it with a Sharpie from his nightstand, and hands it back.
Dean throws two tubs of potato salad into the cart.
“Vincent Masterton.”
“What is the point of this visit, Sam?”
“Nah, I’m, I’m good, knocked over some persimmons or some shit.”
“So uh, this bitch.”
Ben nods as he puts the journal in his jacket. “Yeah, that helps, I guess, I guess I was just worried Dean had some weird obsession like that too, you know?”
Yes, he wanted his parted lips upon those of his former lover’s as soon as he saw him. But he felt the
Yeah, he did. For wanting to fuck Cas in the apple orchard. That’s what he felt guilty for. The apple orchard of a fucking church on top of that. And what did it take for Dean Winchester to want to deflower his old love in a church’s garden? A fucking brushing together of their hands. That was all. No kiss, no hand holding. Their hands merely brushed and Dean wanted him then and there.
“Thank you.”
“Damn better be.”
*******
“Oh all right, he angered me. He incensed me. He knew why I did what I did but said nothing. So, I had to make him a victim too. I planned to drive him crazy, or at least have him on trial. Was there really a hair?”
“But I know the Bible sees it the same way Father, thoughts as actions.”
Dean swallows. He knows Cas is only partly right concerning the case. He was not without fault concerning their past, he knows it. Cas knows it, but Cas won’t bring it up because he and Cas both know the most important thing to Dean is staying. But Dean knows now, he knows why Cas left, he understands Cas better, but this case and Cas together is still a bit murky.
Cas smirks mischievously as he crawls on top of his husband.
A burly man opens the door and looks down at the woman standing in front of him.
“Just say it, all right. Say it so I know I ain’t crazy. Say it so that every time I fucking sob your name in my sleep it will have been worth it.”
Dean’s breath dries the moisture on Cas’s bottom lip. Dean’s eyes flit from Cas’s lips to his eyes, asking for a permission that was always granted. Dean tentatively moves closer, their lips now brushing. He gently takes Cas’s bottom lip between his and he is
“What are you saying? You, you sat on this?”
Cas’s tone changes to one of contriteness, with a hint of pain. “Dean, I am not good. I feel I must atone.”
Ben cracks a small smile. “Yeah, why not?”
As the young man squirts soap on a sponge, he thinks. “Yeah, I mean, I guess? I love Dean and all, he’s great. He teaches me stuff about cars, but I don’t know? He seems sad a lot. I think it sometimes makes Mom sad, or depressed. I know she loves Dean, and all, Dean used to have this partner, and the person died, and like, I hear him scream out their name all the time, that’s gotta be hard on Mom too, you know? I know Dean tries, and I know he cares, but like, Mom can’t fix him?” Ben didn’t mean to let all that slip, he looks over to Father Novak, wide-eyed.
“I know.”
Cas allows a sob to escape and Sam hands him another tissue. Sam knew Cas needed to get this out, and he wanted to be here for him as much as he could be.
Sam huffs air out of his nose and looks Cas dead in the eye. He is unable to push the anger down.
“I need another explanation for this.” He knew Sammy would be able to help him find one, he should’ve come to him earlier.
“Yes, this bitch, as you call her, seems to have picked up where she left off.”
“Lis, what…” Even though he knew what.
“You see, I work at the University your daughter goes to.”
“What do you want?”
He watches with interest as he gingerly caresses the cover before opening it. He notices that Father Novak stops briefly on the pages describing both shootings. He notices a type of glean in his eyes, almost recognition, before closing the journal and handing it back to him.
“I think now would be better. He has this good thing going with Lisa.” Sam only came here with the best interest of his brother in mind, but seeing Cas here, in this mountain of papers, brought something to the forefront of his very soul.
“Why’d you do it Benny?” Dean knew it was him, and he tried to keep the anger from going to his fist.
She hears a groggy moan and turns around.
Mary was unable to scream as a gloved hand clapped her mouth. She tried to grab him anywhere she could to gain purchase, but all her efforts were futile. He held a blade to her throat and his arm pinned her body to his. She struggled, but her fight was in vain.
There is something bewitching in familiarity. Something that lends a person to behave in a way they did years prior when times were easier and less constricting. Trauma tends to be a type of bridge, where old lovers reunite, if not as lovers, as comfortable strangers.
“She good?”
Dean feels Lisa elbow him and he nods, hoping that is an appropriate response.
“Fuck you, Cas.” It’s lighthearted, it’s welcomed, it’s
Mary dragged him into an armchair and began her work. It was routine now, every step coming back to her due to what she deemed muscle memory, and a hint of desire.
“I don’t need help. I already help. I help every time I shove a needle into one of those sick bastards. Every time I rid the world of their vile existence. I help, I don’t need it.”
“Dude, what?”
“Do we have to get up now?”
Dean sighs, “What a fucking mess we’ve made, Cas.”
Benny walks over to Cas with a slight limp and puts a large hand on the priest’s shoulder.
He looks to the blood bag and starts, panic filling his veins, making his blood pump faster. Mary looks at him with piqued interest.
“She did it again.”
“Yeah, I mean, they’re pretty great.”
“Yeah, well, neither one of us is easy to live with.”
Cas nods, a hint of a smirk playing on his lips.
“Why’d you plant that hair?”
Sloth
“Mary, Joe, this is Lisa and her son, Ben. I sold them a house a few doors down just a little bit ago. Don’t you love it here?”
“Hello Mrs. Winchester.” It’s breathed, it's raspy, it’s deep and terrifying. The man is looming, and his size does not allow her any movement.
“I’ll pay you to let me go. I have money. I won’t say a word.”
“Hello, Brother.” The Cajun drawl commanded attention.
“Sucks, doesn’t it?” Mary leans back in her chair as she lazily plays with the letter opener. She watches as the priest squints, examining it.
“That son of a bitch!” She hissed.
“She is…”
again? Dean shakes his head in disbelief.
Father Novak sits in his confessional, a place he often finds comforting – tending to the worries of his flock. For when one worries over the worries of another, they often are able to forsake their own.
“I don’t just wanna leave you and Ben like…” He didn’t want to leave, to forsake. He couldn’t be that man, but he also knew Lisa was right, as usual.
“Definitely. But I don’t want him to even get to trial Sam.” He wanted him in his arms right fucking now.
Dean looks down momentarily before once more resuming the question. He knew who the insider was. And he knew why they did it. But it did lead them to the truth.
*******
Cas sighs as he sits back, and she smiles wider, knowing she had won. She drops the letter opener as she pushes the glasses up her nose.
“Oh, but I am, to you.”
What a fucking decision.
Castiel Novak knows how difficult of a confession that was for Dean Winchester to make. He typically didn’t believe in shrinks, but for Cas, he would. Just like for Cas he went to church, for Cas he went out to eat at fancy restaurants, he went to plays and operas and dramatic readings, and Cas felt sick.
“You spoil him.”
“Yes, we enjoy living here so far.”
They are both nervous here, in the garden surrounded by flowers of all types. A dogwood shedding the last petals of summer falls around them, and Dean notes how they’re in a fairy tale. Dean’s hands explore Cas’s back and he finds Cas doing the same. Their heartbeats increase as their faces move closer to one another.
“I’m worried about Dean, he doesn’t really seem the same, do you think it’s the move?”
“No, he’s actually your priest.”
The hug did nothing to alleviate the unyielding
Dean knew his father was a bounty hunter, and he never knew how many guys he killed, and he didn’t want to think about it.
“I know you love me in the way you can, but you will never love me or anyone as much as you love Cas, I see that, I know that.”
“Joe.”
Dean breathes harshly through his nose.
Dean nods.
Warm, smooth, bitter liquid passes through her lips, soothing her slightly dry throat. She nibbles on the dry toast in front of her while reading the news on her tablet. She keeps tabs on certain locales, and just as one thumbnail catches her attention, her husband speaks.
Joe nods, his smile replaced by a look of complete confusion. His wife was not prone to sudden outbursts of violence.
“I don’t know…”
Cas began to scratch an itch that suddenly developed on his chest. He had to plead. Their joint obsession would lead to his downfall.
He took the folder and ran into the local Buy-All store. He got a cart and was throwing various meat and bread products into the cart.
Dean nods again. That is something that he can do, even if he can’t calm the man standing in front of him.
Dean shakes his head fondly at the floor. He never thought he would be doing home repairs as a member of some nuclear family in some suburb. Yeah, he did small apartment maintenance with Cas, but when he thought of his future -
Cas laughs, “Well, it is the only thing I can bake. Do you mind if I get started? I can find my way around.”
“All right, so uh the last victim was uh…”
Mary smiles sweetly and kisses his hand before he gets up.
“Your mom?”
Cas looks at him, shock apparent in comically wide eyes. He fights his feelings, he fights the blood rushing South, and he knows Dean’s gotta get away from him
“Dean, you were with him, he couldn’t have. Besides it’s Cas, he’s a good man. Now this damn hair…”
“What’d you say?”
The college Cas would sometimes adjunct at. Dean feels a type of sickness deep in his stomach. He hates it, he fights the nausea, the waves of sick rising.
“Fucking Mary.”
Cas, no way in hell this was Cas.
“I want you.” She utters emphatically, surprising the man beside her. “I have had many boyfriends, Dean. But you, you’re different, you work so hard to make this work, and I could never want more than that.”
“What?”
“You don’t have a very extensive vocabulary, do you Mr. Whitmire?” She watched with a languid expression, knowing her knots would hold - as she had ample confidence in her own ability.
“I love you Castiel Novak. I would love you no matter what. And that won’t fix a fucking thing, I know it, you know it. Love ain’t the problem, it never was.”
“Uh, Father Novak? Do you do like do... marriage counseling and stuff?” Ben had no idea why he asked that.
Dean scoffed. “So, you were what, good to let her just keep doing it?” Dean flung his head against the back of his headrest. He felt this was a new side to Cas, a side he wasn’t used to seeing - a side that had its own type of justice. And for some reason Dean couldn’t pinpoint, he felt Cas’s reasoning was probably good - and he wondered what that made him.
Dean shakes his head fondly.
Cas smiles sadly at him. He hopes Dean can sense his peace with this. He hopes Dean can go on with his life. He hopes he can stop crying out his name in his sleep, hopes he can find all he needs in Lisa.
*******
“Well, Father, there is a new character on my favorite Soap Opera, and I find myself very attracted to him.”
“Lives are in danger. I have a higher purpose than the laws of the church, the laws of God are more important than any sacred rite. If human lives are in danger, I will speak out.”
But he didn’t.
“That ain’t the point, kid. It’s coffee, it’s meant to keep you awake.”
The contact list.
“You married me one year ago today.”
“Umm, okay. Uh, well, the hair. Too convenient, right?”
Do people really puke when things hit them?
Dean leans his chin down into her arms and kisses the skin he finds there. He lifts his head up when there’s a knock at the door.
, Cas feels the same way too. The stoicism is just an act, as it always was, to protect him. Dean sees it then, the slightest trace of tears in a storm of blue.
“I believe, my child, as far as the sin is concerned, it is the act.”
“Well!”
He rubs his wrists together again, attempting to loosen the rope.
It all began to click then, all of it. His dad’s obsession with that killer - The Atoner. That psycho that killed his mom. That bastard that prayed over his victims before he killed them. He feels the anger in his very fingertips.
Mary scoffs, then nods. The images of her father being gunned down in front of her replaying in her mind.
- needed him, and the least he could do was not get a damn boner.
“You could’ve done therapy; I would’ve done it with you.”
The church’s garden was Father Novak’s favorite place in the community. They raised vegetables for a farmer’s market they had on Saturdays in the parking lot. The profits went towards members of the community who could not afford basic necessities, and the extra produce went to them as well. Castiel felt somewhat reprieved.
Cas needing him changed something in Dean’s demeanor, something he couldn’t explain. It was always like this between them - when Cas melted, Dean was there. Fuck yeah, he still wanted Cas. Especially in Dean’s old shirt, but not a damn thing would make him act on it.
She walked into the kitchen, pulled down a glass, opened a bag of blood into it, added an airplane sized vodka, a stalk of celery, and a green olive from a jar she kept in her bag.
Ben puts the journal back under his mattress when he hears the doorbell.
“Castiel Novak we are here to arrest you on suspicion of murder, you have the right to remain silent.”
Melanie Hawkins notices a smudge on her white sandals and tries to hide the imperceptible mark behind her other foot. She breathes in deeply, her chest rising dramatically as she awaits Lisa’s response. She looks around the house quickly, smiling internally at the difference in size compared to hers - she was a lawyer’s wife after all.
Dean tries to look anywhere but Benny’s face.
*******
“Hey, Cas, come on. We’ll figure it out, just like we always do, all right? Come on, let’s get you dressed.”
Dean blushes and clears his throat. Cas turns his head around with a cautious half smile. Dean shakes his head, amused, and scratches the back of his neck with his hand.
“That’s what your type likes to think, isn’t it? That there’s absolutely no reason to kill. Even your sacred book says there is a time to kill.”
Dean decides it's up to him to break the slightly awkward tension. He wipes his eyes, clears his throat, and asks:
Lisa looks to her son. “You excited about moving?”
Dean asked for and was granted an extended lunch hour. He forgot he had a shit ton of food to buy for a BBQ he completely forgot about, between seeing Cas and moving and the murder and absolutely fucking everything. He got a few weird looks, especially since this case was sitting in his lap. Literally in fact – in a manila folder. He wasn’t needed at the crime scene, not this time, as Bobby told him in his usual gruff manner.
This annoyed Gregory Ball very much, so he made himself feel important in other ways.
“But it hurts like hell when he doesn’t try to get you to stay.”
Cas leans forward.
“We probably will, if for community than nothing else. I have always wanted to live in a neighborhood like this, near good people, a good sense of community, a good priest.” Mary smiles at him, and as he is about to retort, he sees Ben approaching them somewhat cautiously. He is none too surprised when Ben asks if he can talk to him privately.
He repeats. “Talk to me.”
Joe nods excitedly as Mary mutters “porch” under her breath.
Dean and Benny arrive at Dean and Lisa’s house to a driveway full of cars, and Dean realizes that this is it. His brother, his sister-in-law, his girlfriend, his buddy, and his ex fiancé were all gonna be there. What a great fucking time.
“Right.”
Cas keeps rifling through papers as he points to the tablet.
“Why now?”
Greed
Dean’s hand left his face and returned to the steering wheel. The anger returned, but this time not at Cas - at Bloody Mary.
“I actually prefer we lay in bed.”
“You will always be the best humanity has to offer, and I can’t ask you to leave the life you’ve created for an uncertain future with me.”
“You are. I am the envy of every woman around here. And a couple of the men.” There is a mischievous glint in her eye.
She shrugs. “You.”
*******
“I get that I’m a genius, but there’s nothing for me to do here. No phone calls to trace, it seems random.”
“But, Dean, Lisa and Ben…”
, fuck, with
Dean looks as if he were a deer caught in the headlights. “Fuck, that’s tonight?”
Dean nods, he hates this part of Cas. The part that gives up so easily, the part that doesn’t allow him to work through it. He thinks he fucked up and that’s it, he lacks the ability to clean up his own mess. Even though Dean knows it’s because the man lost faith in himself, even though he lost the anger, this, this side of the man he loves still pisses him off.
Cas begins to highlight one of the papers and puts it on top of another. He does seem to have some sort of system, and Sam is somewhat impressed. He happens to glance over at a pretty horrific photo.
Dean nods. “Yeah.”
Cas braces himself against the back of a bench that was donated by the Smith’s. His mind is inundated with memories, and he closes his eyes against them.
“No, Dean, it didn’t. I just couldn’t anymore.”
“I needed peace, and I thought this would give it to me.”
Cas sighs.
Dean looks at him with the tiniest hint of tears in his exquisite green eyes. Cas hates seeing those tears and knowing he is the reason for those tears. He hated causing Dean any kind of pain.
Gabriel’s tour, Claire’s birthday, then there was a party, what type of party was it?
The potato salad was quickly followed by three cans of baked beans.
He held her to him that night and hoped like hell she didn’t feel the tears through her shiny hair.
He feels Benny’s hand on his arm and he rips out his grasp.
“Who are you?!”
But something felt...wrong?
“We all have those cases, man. Where the perp becomes so ingrained in our psyche that it’s like our own personal game of cat and mouse.” He thinks back to a driven agent in a black leather jacket with a journal. “I ain’t happy you hid the details. Why did you do that anyway?” He feels a pang of hurt and the pain moves its way to his eyes.
They worked at the same university – Joe a professor of microbiology, and Mary a Literature professor. That’s where she met him.
“Well, a frame job?”
*******
*******
“Unhand me!”
“Oh no, just like you, he deserved to die. It was a waste of blood.”
Of course.
“Dean and I weren’t the same. He no longer saw wonder in my eyes. He saw the man who maimed his best friend. He saw the man who was so obsessed that he couldn’t even tell the difference between the monster and their shadow.”
He was. And Cas had been to his concert the night of his death.
“That’s an apple, Cas.”
“The D.A. will say it’s because he’s gay.”
“Oh! Are you Catholic?”
“Me neither.”
Dean walks over to him as he holds the bag to the window, so it can be steeped in sunlight.
Dean smiles. “We shall.”
“Yeah, sounds fun.”
Ben gets up and gives Sam a pat on the shoulder. “Dean makes us watch
Dean and Cas both get up to hug Sam, his long arms easily encompassing them both.
Cas’s brow scrunches and Dean smiles in spite of himself. He is fully turned around now, and the ease of this discussion is not lost on the F.B.I. agent.
Dean nods, scared, but trying to be strong for both of them, like he should’ve tried to do three years prior instead of being a drunken, blaming mess. He wants to give Cas everything he needs, and God how he wants to try.
His eyes are drawn to the page he randomly fell upon. He reads the entry.
“What if you made a mistake?”
“Benny, how ya doing?”
He tries to shake from his head thoughts of two boys in a dingy motel room, surviving off of hot fries stolen from a vending machine while their dad is gone, on a dead trail of the serial killer that killed their mom. He tries to not think about the lack of holidays, birthdays, and shitty gifts he gave Sammy that he stole from a gas station, a dinner of beef jerky and stale Little Debbies.
*******
Cas breaks then, tears flowing freely. Dean attempts to wipe them away with his free hand.
Cas takes the mixture off the stove and turns to Ben, taking whole apples out of the water and slicing them alongside the young teenager. He puts them into a new bowl and Ben follows suit.
The bag contained a short, straight, black hair.
At least, that’s what he thought. He told everyone he was the heir to the Ball fortune, of mason jar fame. While it was a good story, it was not true, and everyone knew this. The heir to any fortune, mason jar or otherwise, would not live in Shenandoah Valley. People would smile politely at Mr. Ball and walk away.
“If it fit so well, why didn’t you and Bobby arrest him?”Dean knew the answer and he just wanted to see Benny admit it.
“I understand, Benny, thank you.” Castiel stands.
“I saw how you fought for him, how you believed in him, and I knew I couldn’t put this decision into your hands, I knew someone smarter was going to have to do it.”
Pride
Dean nods as he turns, drying dishes. Something in him breaks here - and he struggles not to hate himself even more for it. It wasn’t a breakup, it was the love of his life walking away because they couldn’t pull their heads out of their asses. It was Cas and him both giving up, it was Dean slowly realizing that blame belonged not only on Cas but on him as well. It was Cas slipping through his fingers every night in a new type of raw loss. It was crying into Lisa’s beautiful dark hair, it was bereavement, it was loss, it was the type of pain that made Dean want to give up, He didn’t have a breakup - he lost everything, including himself.
“Benny was in agony for months, she just kept killing, and we were always one step behind. Every time Dean would come home from the hospital, he would make sure not to make eye contact with me. Benny was so bitter for so long, not that I blamed him. I caused him to lose a leg.”
“Yeah, uh, sorry man, you were just zoning out, and uh, habit, you know, being beneath you?”
“I tried to wake you up the first time you called out his name.”
“Doesn’t matter. I am right more often than I am wrong.” And statistics matter.
“Go on, get dressed, you religious lush, we got shit to do.”
“Maybe.” But who?
“Fuck you, Castiel, emissary of the Lord.”
Dean skims it, looking for a possible connection, and there it is.
“Mary.”
He hears his mom call him from downstairs, he knows he’s gotta watch a movie with Sam and Eileen, he promised. He also knows he’s gotta hide whatever sick info he just discovered. I mean, wasn’t that type of stuff supposed to be in case files? And whose was it anyway?
“Let me get dressed real quick and then we’ll tie it up there together, how about that?” Dean promises, as he ruffles the kid's hair before heading into the bathroom.
Sam sighs as he looks once more at the dates.
“Good morning.”
He sees the priest gripping the sides of the counter tight, and he wonders what kinda nerve he hit. He waits for Father Novak to respond. He sees the tears forming in his eyes when he finally does turn around and answer.
Lisa suppresses a smile that is not lost on Mary.
“I was sitting at a kitchenette table, my dad feeding me dinner, and you know who kicked our door in and blew my father’s brains out in front of me?”
“Lis, that apple pie was the best you ever made.”
Ben swallows the bile that creeped into his young throat, yells: “Coming” in the general direction of the stairs, looks around his room once more to make sure nothing looks disturbed, and leaves, shutting the door behind him.
“I have a meeting with a student at three, so how about four?”
Cas laughs and Dean breathes in the mirth, grateful that was the response.
*******
Joe looks mortified and Mary takes everything in. This is exactly where she wants to be - where
“Umm… so you know Dean is an FBI agent?”
“I’m good with that.”
He finds a perplexed Sam in the home office, waiting on him.
“All right, well, you said Cas discovered something about the victims, that they weren’t exactly innocent, right.”
“Okay.” That seemed reasonable.
Mary shrugs as she reaches down in her purse, she is very happy with her new life, her new friends, her new sense of calm. The priest was in jail for her crimes, he couldn’t tell who was the actual murderer so he would have to sit with that. His lover would be tortured as well, always trying to free his one true love. Oh, it was beautiful.
“Uh, yeah, we’ll uh, see you then.”
She shakes her head as much as possible. “No, it is simply like yours. What can I say priest? You inspire me.”
“More or less.”
She smiles fondly at him, only slightly guilty of her true motive.
“What if you did?”
“I saw that bit in the paper about your women’s shelter.” Mary’s nostrils flare as she fingers the edge of the opener.
With a robe haphazardly thrown over broad, muscled shoulders, he wanders to the area that has become his kitchen and finds a note in front of the coffee maker.
*******
Dean doesn’t understand. “I don’t get it, what…”
“Babe?”
Mary places the jar on the table and notices Dean and Sam standing in the doorway. Dean’s eyes move to the jar, and she sees the moment everything ‘clicks’ in green eyes.
Searching for the strength to draw breath, Castiel responds. “Those words you need are here: I am in love with you, Dean Winchester.” He wants to pull Dean into him, wants to console him, wants to reiterate the words Bobby said to Dean all those years ago,
“How long did I, uh…”
“I suppose I am not what most would call ‘sane’, but no, I am not draining your blood because I am crazy. Would you care to try again?”
He closes the door just as Dean sheds a tear.
“I don’t understand.”
“Are you happy, Ben?”
Cas leaned against the counter. He put his hand around the mug Dean used that morning.
future, he envisioned something urban, some condo in the middle of a busy downtown with a balcony garden. Or fuck, maybe some house in the middle of nowhere, where they would only spend days on end with each other.
