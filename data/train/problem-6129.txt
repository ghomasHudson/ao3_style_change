Steve grinned and turned Tony's head to kiss him. "Maybe a little."
"And I would have never abused my son."
The comments on StonyFan1918's most recent story were getting interesting. As a writer, they loved every comment, but sometimes, the fans of their stories got a little weird:
"It was worth it!" Howard screamed. "I've spent the last sixteen years searching for you! I needed to know!" He deflated, just a bit. "Maybe it is selfish, but someone I admired and considered a friend went down in a damn plane
Barton outwardly moaned, his hand dragging up to his waistband and slipping inside.
"Come on, let's go." Tony said, his throat tight.
Looking a little red himself, Bruce retrieved the syrup and the salt and pepper, "Please? I'm starving and I don't want to think about the two of you doing the nasty."
Nose deep in a back issue of Highlights magazine, he ferociously ignored everyone around him. Everyone meaning the eight other people in the waiting room, all of which seemed to recognize them both. It didn't help that issues of US Weekly and People magazine were scattered on the table, his gaunt face across their covers.
doing?"
He tried, at first, just to roll the sleeves up, too ashamed of his thin body, but the sweatshirt was too bulky, and he had no choice.
They finished their breakfast in companionable silence, Howard taking it upon himself to wash the dishes. It was never something he did at home - he had staff for that - but it seemed the right thing to do for the woman who was offering friendship even though he would one day hurt her friend.
At least he was back to being Tony.
Tony wasn't swayed, his voice, raspy with sleep, asked, "Howard?"
"Not headlining," Tony let his head drop to the side and the file flop over just a little.
"More than a camera." Tony quietly laughed, turning the device on. "This is a Starkpad, a handheld computer."
Tony knew what he meant when he said he'd take care of something. It usually involved the Hudson.
She plucks a file from a container on the desk and flips it open. As she does so, a new one appears to fill its place. "Welcome to Heaven, Mr. Stark. Oh! I see here that you're a special case! That
She wasn't the only one, though maybe she was the only Avenger who ever acted out her fantasies of being normal. She knew Steve never had that chance, even if he started out without the serum, he had still been sickly and weak. Thor was a godly prince, so yeah, nope. Tony had been born into expectation and certain privilege. His father had gone 'round the bend, and he was a genius. He had no chance. Bruce? He probably prayed for a normal life nightly, and most likely still did. And Clint, damn. Clint would have given it all up just for a shot to have his parents and brother back as they were before his entire life went to hell. They wouldn't judge her, and there was a connection in that. Something deeper than friendship.
The end.
Tony. There's
Left in darkness, Howard let his hands fall to his sides.
"Well, you had to be strong." Avery said, no hint of sarcasm or over excitement. He said it like a fact. And it was. "How have you been fairing since all this started?"
"Yeah, go set the table, I'll tell you what I know."
But other times, he sat quietly, writing down descriptors and passing along his notes surreptitiously to Steve or Bruce. Just in case.
Steve was quiet for a moment, contemplating. "Awful," he answered truthfully. "It would have been so much worse. But the public, knowing about time travel? Where do we draw the line? We'll know who he is -- it would just be on paper."
He was so close, his stomach tensed, and his breath labored as he felt himself at the brink. The feeling of the dildo fucking him, the visual of Steve eating his own come from his hole, fuck. It was too much.
"Holy shit."
"Tony, it's okay. Come on, wake up now."
Rhodey swooped below him, pulling up and making a circle around Tony as the Iron Man armor leveled out. "ETA Three minutes!"
Steve smirked, grabbing the other washcloth and making quick work of his own body.
"Could just unleash the Hulk on him instead." Tony said evenly, but with a glint in his eyes.
The man was shaking his head, "I think we forget sometimes, when a person is famous that they're still human." Tony felt his face heat up even more. All this blushing was going to be bad for his reputation.
Nodding, Tony moved to the edge of the bed. He felt stale and stiff, and weariness had crept into his bones and settled in, making itself at home. When he stood, his lower back ached, and the scars around the arc reactor stretched uncomfortably. Shuffling to the bathroom, he clicked on the light and winced as the brightness assaulted his eyes.
Someone snorted, but he didn't know who. Fury was walking up to him, looking just as intimidating as his name suggested; it pushed everything else from Howard's mind. He stood almost a full foot over his frame, and stared down at him with barely concealed wonder in the one eye Howard could see.
"Am I?" From somewhere by his hip, Steve picked up a bottle of lube, popped it open, and slicked himself. "Am I still lame?"
Steve faces one of his worst nightmares.
"You know about the spell?!"
It all came back to Howard's wants. Not
This was him introducing the movie to Steve, who was intently watching and laughing along. But Tony couldn't concentrate. His thoughts kept slipping back to his father. Other than letting him into the suite to shower and handing him a change of clothes, he hadn't spoken to the man. Hadn't even attempted to breach the conversation they had that morning, though it hung between them like heavy rope, frayed and rough.
"Take a look, angel." Steve coaxed him.
"I should inform you that there is someone here—"
"What did I do?" Howard's voice was quiet, reserved. All of this - how Steve was acting - it could only point to one thing. Howard wasn't an idiot, not by a long shot. He knew that these reactions could only be because he had somehow fucked up, done something he hadn't yet to make Steve Rogers hate him. It had to be bad to get this type of reaction. Something cracked inside him, and Howard felt sick. He placed his still mostly filled glass onto the bar. "Tell me what I did, Steve." He asked again, his tone subdued.
Tony, who was the love of his life and the closet he had to a best friend in the future.
into Steve.
"Seven. And now she wants to be a female superhero when she grows up. There are worse things, of course. But she filled my wife's Amazon cart with leather pants and knives. We emptied it and told her to start smaller."
"It can. And I'm happy to hear that you're not actually a homophobic jerk. You're not, right?" He fixed Howard's with a heady stare, locking eyes with him as he sat. If he let a flash a green shoot across his pupils, well, there was nothing wrong with a bit of healthy fear.
"Don't get ahead of yourself, Mr Stark."
Tony licked his lips, his chin raising with pride, eyes dark, "Yes."
Tony laughed loudly as they entered the elevator.
Their first kiss was borderline shy. Tentative. Their second, heated and passionate. But this…
"Oh! Great! Let me- let me get a shirt on!" Turning from the door, Steve beckoned her inside. She stepped over the threshold and let the door click shut behind her.
about the implications it meant for Tony.
Tony gave a short laugh. "Thanks, J." Tilting his head up so he could see Steve, Tony asked, "Hungry?"
Head shaking back and forth and a warning glint in her eyes, she went to hit him again but he scooted back, "No! You get back here! You deserve this and you know it!"
Rhodey's face dissolved into one of disgust, "I try not to think of my little brother having sex, thanks. That includes any discussion on Steve's…junk."
"Uh, yeah. I'm sorry they involve you. Look, if you want me to stop reading them-"
He was halfway across the kitchen, set on getting a glass of water from the filtered tap before bed when Howard popped his head out of the guest room.
resembling peace just seemed like a shitty way to spend a trip to the future. Number one on
"Now," Avery started again, since the pleasantries were out of the way, "how have you been feeling, Mr. Stark?"
"Tony, oh my angel, you feel so perfect." This was going to be quick for him, a fast and hearty fuck, just the reconnection they needed. It was why he had brought Tony so close to the edge. He knew he wasn't going to last long. His own need was far too deep at that moment. Too great to control himself for long.
Howard had shrugged, not looking abashed even in the slightest.
None of this matters at this moment, however, as Tony's heart clenches at the sight of Steve. He looks beaten like he's throwing in the metaphorical towel and giving up. It hurts to see him so upset. Steve, regardless of their first meeting, has become something of a beacon for Tony. His strength and courage is something Tony tries desperately to emulate. Steve is the glue that holds them all together, both beautiful and strong at once. So it's no surprise that Tony had fallen head over feet for him.
As was usual with Steve, he saw through him, but Tony wasn't surprised nor was he upset over it. He wanted the comfort, even if he rarely sought it out himself. Steve knew. He always did when Tony wanted it but couldn't find the words to ask, and he was far too good at persisting until Tony finally allowed it.
He honestly wouldn't change a thing about Tony Stark, not one single thing.
You all get two today, but no more until tomorrow!
to hurt Steve!
"I swear she's not replacing you, JARVIS." He just loved the idea of artificial intelligence, JARVIS or otherwise and frankly he was lucky Tony didn't throw the thing out as soon as Steve had brought it home.
Tony sighs, he's a bit disappointed if he's honest, but he gets it. "Understood. Got any place you want to go? Fiji? The Bahamas?"
In the middle of the altar, placed in an abalone shell, was Steve's last gift to him. A pin from his youth, something given as a token of friendship just weeks before he disappeared into the vast cold of the Arctic.
"He's missing something, though."
As the elevator took them away, Tony heaved a deep sigh. "I should go find my father." Kissing Steve, he added, "Just give me fifteen with him?"
Tony had to admit a certain relief at that. This was the most stable relationship he had been in, and it was the forever type. He didn't want to impede his one chance at true happiness. They would come out when they were both good and ready, and not a moment sooner.
"I was frozen."
he thought,
After all the build up, Steve was already close. He draped himself over Tony, letting go of his hair to instead bite at his shoulder. "Oh, shit," he mouthed against Tony's skin, "oh, fuck, baby, I'm going to fucking come!" The game was dropped. He was too far gone to keep up appearances.
Tony snapped upright, the hood of his sweatshirt falling over his eyes, "fuck!"
"Not at all." The doctor spoke in understanding. "But you did come back positive for celiac disease."
Tony sighed dramatically. "
Over Tony's head, Steve mouthed, "
"What's up, Agent Hill?" Fury asks, standing from behind his desk. He rounds it, coming to rest in front of her.
At least dinner wasn't
"Yeah, I'm the one who got him into rehab." At his incredulous look, she pressed on quickly, "I'm the one who chose
I am! You-" he freezes, looking at Tony in confusion. "Too?"
Ignoring her, he continued, "I figured out it was one of you because whenever I mentioned a kink I have, it ended up in the next story. I figured out it was
capacity. Nothing could replace the feelings he had when he was with his love. They could be homeless and living in the streets, and whatever box they lived in would still be
Howard threw back his fourth cup of coffee that day
All at once, Tony knew what he needed to do.
"Okay, I lied. There are some things that still surprise me." Stepping into their personal space, Rhodey lowered his voice, "Are you telling me that Howard Stark, the bastard that
"I miss how you have zero refractory," he answered for him, and he swallowed Steve whole, wrapping his lips around him and sucking gently. Steve's hips involuntarily jerked, his hands tangling in the curls atop Tony's head.
"Exactly."
Or he was from an era that demanded such a mindset, and it could be changed.
Rhodey respected Bruce. Not just as a scientist or as an Avenger, but as Tony's other best friend. He held no misgivings for Tony taking on another one, it actually helped to ease Rhodey's mind a little. He was so often out of the country or otherwise engaged that he wasn't always able to talk Tony down or be there physically for him. Bruce had stepped up to that plate.
"That's a little cliché, guys."
"You sure?" Tony nodded. "Okay, thanks, let me just shower.
"Right away, Captain Rogers." Steve was just headed to the door when the AI spoke again, "Sir says he'll be right up."
Now is
"Gross."
"I'm sorry, Steve-" Tony cut him off, bringing his head forward to rest against Steve's chest, "I'm so incredibly sorry. I was so wrong."
The look she gave him spoke volumes; she was disappointed he hadn't figured it out. "Because I needed to know if you were okay. And you're not."
"Eventually." Steve responded, watching as the vibrator stretched the rim, the tapered toy opening it wider the further in it went.
That brought a laugh from Steve. "That's fair. But, Tones, I need to be me as well."
"We're not in the UK." Her eyes trailed down the menu. "
I know this is a little bit of a slow burn, but I honestly can't see Tony just up and being okay with Howard being there. Tell me what you think in the comments.
voice in the back of his mind telling him that they may succeed in that regardless. Which meant he had to be prepared for it to happen, and leaving without giving Tony
He was looking for concrete proof, something to tie Natasha to the account, anything at all so he could stalk up to her and gloat.
"Count me out," Tony answered, stretching, "I'm not hungry, think I'll take the guitar outside." He ambled to his feet and picked up his Martin and the red leather journal he used for writing his lyrics and guitar tabs.
The look she gave him had better men running for the hills, but Tony was well adjusted to the Black Widow stare. "Just...you...both of you...UGH. Boys are stupid!"
"No," Tony laughed hollowly, "but it's better if I go alone." Tony turned to go, ready to face Howard, but Steve's fingers gently circled his wrist.
Bumping his chin on Tony's head some time later, Rhodey pointed to the bathroom. "Go shower and then let's go flying. You need to
And though he knew that the soldier was not StonyFan1918, he still had to keep it fair, just in case. And, of course, as a scientist, he needed his hypothesis to be as complete as possible. For Science. Of course.
Shaking his head, Tony softly bopped Steve on his arm. "No, I hurt you. I was wrong. You have no fault in that. I had convinced myself you were better off without me."
she told to herself, as the chapel doors opened, and music started.
“No. Go talk to him” he said, pushing Steve towards the other end of the room. Steve looked down at himself and took a deep breath.
"I used that box which says 'flour' " the archer said, trying to mix it. He tried to pull the whisk out and the mixture just flew out of the bowl to… "where did it go??" Tony asked his friend. And that's when that smell…
I didn't forget Sam and Bucky 😉❤
“Hey! no influencing the bet”, Bucky said, dragging back Clint.
he thought as he looked over the lake.
“No, Steve Rogers I’m asking you out now. Wanna go out for dinner with me tonight?” Tony asked with an amused grin.
He entered the cafeteria to see the blond guy he kissed by mistake at the party last night. He honestly didn’t mean to do that. He was anxious and then hurt that Mr. Brooklyn didn’t show up. He had one too many drinks that got him tipsy. “Hey”, he said, as he stood next to the guy. “Hey Tony-” the blond guy was cut off by his rambling. “ Steve, right? Okay look. Last night, I had too many drinks, I was a little drunk, if you know from… you know. So yeah, It was all hazy and confusing. To be honest, it was a mistake, My mistake-”
In the opposition, Thor took the fort because he's subtle as a brick when it comes to stealth. Steve was to capture the other's base and Clint was to find Bucky. But now Steve sees that Natasha is distracting Clint. Steve is brought out of his thoughts by footsteps and hides in a dark corner. Suddenly he was pushed back into the wall and soft, lush lips were pressed against his in a passionate kiss. Steve's brain short-circuited at that. "Gotcha Cap", he heard a familiar voice and was shot square in his chest.
they said. The media, newsreels, magazines said a lot about him. But she doesn't know him. That was the problem. It's not her dress; not the chapel; not the lack of guests; not the rushed ceremony.
he thought as his hips popped.
See this is a normal morning. They all gather around once a day. It can be for breakfast or dinner. But Natasha noticed a pattern a month ago. Something changed and developed a pattern that nagged her every morning. And the pattern just walked in and
“Oh yeah, who made Steve go to Stark’s party”
“I did Tony, I talked to -”
Steve lurked around the room full of people enjoying Christmas eve. He was not hiding from a certain brunette, Nope he was not. No matter what Bucky said, He. was. Not. hiding. He had been in a state of shock since yesterday, after Tony asked him out over the comms. He woke up the next day and went about routine, dismissing everything as a dream. Until, Nat and Sam showed up and reminded him that in fact, everything was real.
“It’s a date”...
He stood at the doorway watching the man work.
More like Tony Stark.
"- I kinda have teensy weensy-"
A few footsteps broke her attention to the purple evening sky ahead. Few giggles and a lot more footsteps drew attention to the front door. Tony and a woman, walked in, all over each other giggling, and made their way upstairs, not batting an eye at Stephanie sitting in the living room. Her breath hitched. She was mad, frustrated, and weirdly hurt by seeing Stark with another woman. She doesn’t even like him, then why does it hurt? She walked away to her room and the door slammed shut.
He thought back to the day he asked him out. He said yes. He wouldn’t say yes without…. He sighed and drowned in the glass in hand.
sorry for late update. do leave comments and kudos❤
he thought as he walked and stood in front of his husband. Tony remembers making those modified versions of Time Space GPS. He remembers those late night confessions about Steve leaving him, going back to the past. He remembers Steve promising him that he would never leave him. “You came back huh” he smiled, tears brimming. “No, I’m back home” Steve said, touching their foreheads with his arms around Tony’s neck. His hands instantly went to Steve’s waist. Holding him,
“Wanna know why?” he asked, giving him an encouraging smile. “He asked you out because you are brave, smart and funny in your own way.” Sam said. “How do you know that's what ‘the genius’ thought of me. It is-” “Well then, go ask him.” Sam said, now sipping his drink.
he thought as he activated it.
. It was obvious that Tony was trying to get in Cap's pants. “Welp, got work to do'' said Tony, making his way towards the Lift. Nat met Bucky’s eyes and gave him a nod. “Hey Hawkass, between you and me, who do you think has a better shot ?” Nat heard Bucky say as she finished her coffee and made her way to her suite.
“Fuck you, Barnes.-”
yayyy it's doneee Do leave kudos and comments
“It’s a date then” Sam said, kissing Bucky’s cheek.
he smiled remembering what was waiting for him back home. He looked at the modified Time-Space GPS he had in hand.
"Ok now I'm gonna make my sad Boyfriend happy, JARVIS, play ‘still the one’ by Shania Twain” Steve said, dragging Tony to the living room while JARVIS played their favourite song from the speakers. “Thought you didn’t like to dance Big guy” Tony teased Steve, trying to hide his blush. “I like dancing with the right partner,” Steve said, kissing Tony. They swayed to the music, drowning in each other's eyes, Holding each other.
“Sir it’s 7:00 am and Director Fury is calling you” JARVIS said, as he stretched like a cat under the sunlight. “Put him through J,” he mumbled at his AI and walked into en suite. “STARK!?!?”, an angry voice startled him through the speaker. “Aye Aye Pirate” he quipped and picked up his brush, which he had dropped in the sink. “Your Live starts in an hour Stark! Where the Hell are you? You are supposed to meet your new-”  “Be there in 15, Fury. As long as you don’t want to hear my wet naked ass, Byeee”, “Stark!-``'' End call, J” He cut off fury and walked into the shower.
He is looking at the door, planning to bail, when Tony walks in. Steve choked on air seeing Tony walk in. He is breathtaking in a black suit with a rich red dress shirt and slacks hugging his thighs. Steve looked down at his own outfit, thrown over in last minute haste.
“Wha- What?''Bucky stared.
“Besides, we did so much sacrifice play-”,he continued as he remembered his husbands words.
was the only reply they got.
"Stephanie is fine Ms. Potts." she smiled at her. "Call me Pepper then. As I was saying, We didn't want too much attention on you guys now. And he doesn't have much family left other than his Godfather, who is stuck in negotiation across the world. That's why it's a low-key ceremony" Pepper said with a sweet smile. "There's no complaint dear, it was a wonderful ceremony," Sarah said, giving a gentle squeeze to Stephanie. "Y- Yeah it was beautiful," Stephanie said, clearing her throat.
Tony was buried in armor upgrades when Nat comes into his lab and stands next to him. After several encounters with 2 super spies and recently an assassin, Tony stopped getting surprised by their sudden appearances. He sort of... knows when people come into his lab without a pretense. Pepper and Natasha, when he does something stupid; Clint, to prank or gossip; Bruce, for some tools or Tony; Bucky, metal arm upgrades and now to mother hen him; Steve…, partially lives with Tony in the lab. “What did I do now ?” he asks Natasha, taking a sip of… what is supposed to be coffee. “You are trying to get into Steve’s pants” Nat retorted and Tony spits out...not coffee (he didn’t spit it out because of her question. NOT COFFEE). “I… what?”, Tony squeaked and wiped his mouth on his shirt sleeve. Nat raised one perfectly arched eyebrow at him which made him sigh.
“Make it 30 for New year with one condition,” Nat said, now directing her mischievous look at Bucky. “You will ask out Sam for Valentine,” She said, as Bucky sputtered. “Now that’s a Bet” Clint high-fived Nat. “Okay, you know what? If Stevie gets laid by New year, I’ll ask sam out. Valentine or not”
" Ok if all these are switched off what's burning?".....
Tony walked into Steve’s suit, mentally preparing for… he didn’t know what he was preparing for. He should have talked to Steve like a normal person. Now Steve hates him. He’s preparing for an angry outburst. Probably Steve yelling and cutting their friendship off. He is preparing to get socked in the jaw. He walked in to see Steve sitting in front of an easel at one end of the living room. “Steve I-”, Tony started. But he was cut off by Steve saying, “I know Tony. It’s okay. Forget it”, in a dejected voice and fake smile. “You- forget… what?”, Tony was confused now.
(See the end of the chapter for
She didn’t unpack the boxes. It felt like giving up on something. She didn’t know what she was giving up when she had nothing. Pride maybe? She took necessary items when she needed them and left the rest. She refused, when JARVIS told her about the Stark Phone, Stark book, and a Stark pad, that Tony had left for her. Her days after that went on with her sketch pad and the Californian skyline. She had packed her favorite set of romance and mystery novels, leaving a lot back home. But She couldn’t read. Once a haven, now the romance novels reminded her of what she would never have. She had an urge to continue her newfound passion for writing, which also mocked her helplessness. This gave her a chance to break the spines of a few mystery novels. She had a spark and before she knew she was halfway through her newfound addiction.
"Okay, angel." Steve pressed his lips to Tony's forehead, and Tony closed his eyes, savoring the moment. The tight coil that had been the entirety of his insides was unraveling with each passing moment. He had Steve back, and although his father couldn't go back to his time, it didn't damn Tony to vanishing. They had a solution to give Howard a decent life in the future, and although Tony was sad for the loss of Howard's past life, he was excited to finally have the ability to curate an actual relationship with the man that could be positive and loving.
Michael smiles and kisses his forehead. "I'm not supposed to have favorites, you know. But you've always fascinated me."
scream like a little girl!"
"The most interesting part of getting sick and figuring it out isn't that I have an answer, it's why I hadn't thought of it before. It's why I'm donating 3.5 million dollars to the NCA and will continue to do so yearly. Because now I know what I should have before." Pausing, Tony let the murmurs through the crowd soften before he continued.
An hour later, Tony was asleep and Steve finally allowed himself to close his own eyes. His dreams were fitful, filled with shadows and of Tony, too far to reach, tumbling over the edge of something he couldn't see.
Barton was full on rubbing himself, walking closer to get a better view of what Steve was doing to Tony.
"I love you. I
Steve and Tony had gone mostly dark, not answering text messages or calls. It bothered Bruce, but he understood the need to vanish probably more than anyone else they knew. He could give them a few days, and if he still heard nothing, he'd ask JARVIS to contact them. First, he had to talk to Howard. It was long overdue, and although that had his anxiety on edge, Bruce metaphorically squared his shoulders as he put away the groceries in his little apartment. He would make some tea and invite Howard over. With any luck, he wouldn't have to call Pepper to get the construction workers back up to the Avengers floors. Again.
Her grin fell and she leaned back against the headboard, "Fine. Howard is still asleep - so is Clint for that matter - but I know Tony is up and in his workshop. I just wanted to know if he's okay."
"I know." It took a lot for Steve to relent, but he didn't want to spend another minute thinking Tony was mad at him. That's what the debriefing room on the Helicarrier was for. "I don't support this," he pressed on before Tony could protest. "I can't lie to you and say I do, Tony. I just can't. But I'll still be here. Whatever you decide. It's gonna take a lot more than a time traveling father to chase me away from you."
"Yeah. Something about Bruce's birthday and the Tanger Outlets on Long Island." He eyed Steve sardonically, "Look, I don't ask questions when it comes to Point Break. I just let it be." He chuckled, "You wanna question a god's motives?"
He had to admit, flying was a good idea. Banking a hard left and switching trajectory at the last moment, Tony sailed upward, moving his arms out just enough to spin in the air. It had been almost two weeks since he had last flown. Since he had last done
"Yeah?" And Tony was almost embarrassed by how small his voice sounded. He cleared his throat, "Yes?" Good. That sounded more confident.
Steve couldn't help but agree. "You've shown a bit of your temper here. I think it's balanced out enough it won't affect you too much. I'm not going to pretend to know everything about this." He shrugged, holding his hands out palms up, offering Howard everything he had. "But maybe it evens out. The bad in you that stayed wasn't able to balance back out because those emotions are so heavy. But with the positive ones, maybe you'll be able to shift back into something more familiar in the future."
Tony takes a deep breath; he knows he needs to steer the conversation away from such a horrendously sad topic. "Who else are you watching over?"
He hung up before Bruce could say his own goodbye.
He doesn't remember the last time he cried this hard. Or rather, he doesn't remember the last time he allowed himself to cry this hard. It's a toss-up.
"How?"
"No potatoes then."
Steve jiggled the box with his other hand, "Or I should just open this up."
Another eyebrow raise. "He's having breakfast in Tony's suite with Bruce."
"I kill to even the fucking score!" Tony was in his space again, hand fisted with money, pointer finger in Steve's chest. "My ma did nothing but fall in love with the wrong guy. They beat her senseless and tossed her out. We lived in the goddamn
Steve frowned. "Too much?"
Because standing directly in front of him, at quarter past 11 in the morning and hours earlier than expected, was Steve.
His face softened, and he dropped his hand to his lap. "I know that, Tash, I'd do the same."
"Natasha tells me that you do not think you are good enough for our Captain."
Pepper groaned and tugged Tony down onto the couch, taking a moment to cup his face with one hand, forcing him to look her in the eyes. "Are you okay?"
"Nat is in Austin on an assignment." Tony grumbled as Steve walked into the common kitchen. "Bruce is peacefully doing some peaceful peace thing, I think in North Dakota. Clint is in London, and Thor went shopping."
"No time for sex, Steve, I need to get this done."
Tony bowed. "'Tis a gift, beloved."
And Paulie Two Fingers? He had been whacked simply because he went after children.
has been keeping me informed?" With that, she left, calling out to Tony to follow her down to the business floors. Clint was left to force his memories back down his throat, back into the locked box he kept them in. Pepper Potts knew what she was doing. There was no way he'd let Tony feel even a modicum of what he had with Loki.
Steve had drawn that too. Tony's face was filled with a childlike joy that day as he had attempted to get past the break in the waves, failing over and over, never making it deeper than his thighs, laughing each time he got knocked down. Before he gave up, he threw his arms out and called to the ocean, "You win! But I'll be back!"
Well. He looked murderous.
"I can't get close enough. Or any of my men."
Howard felt the worry climbing up his throat. "Are you sick? Is it that thing in your chest?"
Shrugging, Tony replied with a grin, "Moo is moo."
"Don't start, please. I'll...I'll think about it." It wasn't a yes, but it was better than they had got before whenever seeing a doctor was brought up.
"That's it?"
"Oh, Tony," Rhodey lamented sadly, wrapping both arms tightly around him, "Just let it out, Tones. It's okay. I'm here now." And he wasn't leaving until Tony had both feet back on the ground.
He threw his head back and laughed, deftly dodging a punch. "We were not banished, Nat. Thor is just working his magic. In fact-" he scooted his chair out of swinging reach, "-maybe we didn't really hear Howard out. Thor seemed to think he was redeemable, and-" he put his hands up to placate her, "-prior to the other night, you did too."
"Chill. We're sorry, okay, man?" The one in the middle said, hastily shoving his phone in his pocket.
Though he understood that this Howard was directly involved with creating the Howard that had abused Tony, it wasn't his intention. That right there went further than anything else. This Howard only wanted to help and heal his son, that he did it with his own dramatic flair was not lost on Steve, but somehow very appreciated. It felt good to meet this Howard again.
"It's good to
He turned on his heels, happy to get away from Howard and more than ready to see exactly how this entire situation was affecting his friend.
"Sir," JARVIS speaks up, "Captain Rogers is requesting entry."

"Right," Hill motioned to the couch, "Mr. Stark," she looked at Tony, then to Steve. "Captain. Uh-" she faltered, squinting at Howard, "Mr. Stark… as well? Sit. You're going to need to."
Tony nods; it's not one of his favorite things he's learned, that's for sure. He stays quiet, knowing that Coulson needs to say whatever it is that's weighing on him, and he doesn't need Tony's chatter distracting him.
"I sense a protective streak, Natasha. A lover of yours?"
"Ha! I knew you were freaky!"
It was the sincerity of the word that sent a bolt through him: Tony Stark asking, politely, to be fucked.
"That's not funny."
"You okay, man?"
He downed the water in one go and grumbled, "Down with Russia."
With his fork, he spears a sausage and points it at Coulson. "Tell me about the people you're watching over now. I'm gonna need to know who they are, right?"
"Tony…" Voice like a whisper, like a prayer, Steve breathed heavily, "Tony, god, Tony." His head bent down to kiss up Tony's neck, sucking lightly at the skin. Tony tilted his head, his own breath coming out in puffs and small, aroused whines.
He finally figured it out!
He should have been thinking about the music, but Steve's thoughts turned, as they often did, to his missing best friend. A man he grew up with and served with, who had vanished two weeks into their return from Kuwait. He had never stopped searching for him.
Tony let out a soft, high pitched whimper. "Yes. Yes, I use my fingers first. I really love it."
He holds the head up with both hands underneath and the heavy weight situated between his knees. Their snowman is going to be massive. He loves it.
Steve's head turned sharply to face him. "What? My lady..? Just turn around!" If at all possible, he was coloring a deeper red.
"Tony! Tony, wait, let me explain." Standing, Steve quickly wiped himself with his discarded shirt. He tossed it to the side and held his hands up, trying to calm Tony, to placate him.
"Uh, really?" She looked at him like a 1980s Canadian pop star would look at a reporter,
Avery nodded. "How have you been feeling, Tony?"
There are no words as Steve slips into the bed beside him or when Tony haltingly moves so he's curled up against him. He lifts his good hand and cups Steve's cheek, bringing him down to press a soft kiss against his mouth. Steve's eyes are blue like the gem that gleamed from the cross around Petra's neck. They shine and catch the sun just like it did, drawing Tony's gaze even when the clouds hide away the sky and cast long shadows across Tony's face. Shadows like fingers. Like belts.
"Where is what,
"That will be all, Miss Potts."
Clint pointedly ignored her as she stalked to the coat rack by the door, instead turning to Howard for the first time, "Any food preferences, Asshole?"
"My plan is to spend my life with you, how's that?" System overload. Too schmoopy! Tony moved to pull away, anything to keep from those pesky feelings he'd been having too many of lately. But once again, Steve didn't let him. "Nope. I'm not done hugging you yet."
Ria Rose - 3136 - A4 - Domesticity
"Pick a restaurant," handing the menus to Howard, Natasha stood again, angling toward the bar, "I think it's time for happy hour."
- gave him a sense that something
"Why'd you move?" Natasha asked, and Tony found it funny that she didn't say "Why did you get up?" Not funny in the 'haha' way, but funny in the 'what the actual fuck' way.
The knock changed nightly, so he had to listen for one of the other patrons to do it before he could approach the door. When the aluminum sign swung forwards, it was the same woman he had met the first night.
Snickering softly, Steve pushed Tony onto his back and slid on top of him, nestling between his legs and hooking his arms under Tony's. "Do you accept apologies in blanket form?"
Steve, exasperated but wholly amused, just shot Howard a look that clearly said it was never going to happen. "You're gonna be trouble, aren't you?"
"Good company, and all that."
"Which is fantastic," Steve shot back, "except we also don't know how to get him home, if you didn't hear me the first time."
"I don't know, Tones. Even when I knew him, your father was always a mystery to me."
Avery nodded in understanding. "You're at 137, with someone your height and previous build we'd normally recommend you to be at around 165 to 175."
"I don't think he does well with carbs. Is that an allergy?" Clint supplied.
"Uh. I can change." Tony muttered, catching sight of how well dressed Steve was in comparison to his own frat boy get-up.
Steve ignored them, which Bruce didn't blame him for. Adjusting Tony in his arms, he walked out. Bruce watched him go, a soft smile playing on his lips. He bumped Clint's shoulder. "How long do you think we're grounded for?"
"What's your point, Howard?" Steve asked miserably. The hollow ache he was feeling was growing stronger again. Lifting his palm, he rubbed at his chest, too exhausted to continue to care about anything other than his own heartbreak. Howard's apology dripped down onto him like a man caught unaware without his umbrella. He was already wet - what were a few more droplets?
He laughed. "Everything is served in gelatin." At her disgusted face, he shrugged. "I can get good meals out, some high quality French shit, but my servants have fallen into the trends a bit too much. Even Jarvis." Glancing up at the ceiling and then back at her, he grinned.
"TONY!"
Steve let his hands trail down Tony's back, admiring the smooth and toned skin. His abdomen was rock solid, despite his lean frame, and the suit did a good job of hiding his sculpted arms. He ran his hands over Tony's bottom and lifted, bringing the mob boss up and wrapping his legs around his waist. They only ceased kissing for a moment, to readjust themselves, and Steve was stepping back, towards the lounger.
"I'm in a relationship," Tony repeated. "An amazing one. It's stable and loving, the kind I can grow old with."
"Walking might become an issue."
"What test is that?" Steve asked, and his voice was sleepy. Shit. He had woken him up. A glance at the clock told Bruce that it was after midnight; Cap's normal bedtime was around eleven.
Finally he crawled back to Steve, who still sat pretzeled on the floor, tucking his cock away. Steve gently kissed his head, pride swelling at how incredible his boyfriend was and tugged him into his lap, letting Tony curl up against him.
Taking another bite of the sandwich, Tony picked up an apple slice with his other hand. "Your grandfather used to sprinkle salt on these," he gestured to the slice with the sandwich, "if you want to talk about nasty…"
After a week, he had put on a little weight, not enough, but some. It overjoyed the team anyway, and they celebrated with milkshakes (Natasha was a pro at making those).
"Oh," Steve looked a little dismayed, his brow furrowing as he interrupted. "Tony, we didn't finish our movie."
The distraction was working. Tony ceased his talk of Howard and let himself fold into the pleasure, little moans each time Steve pushed back in and whiney breaths when he pulled out escaping his throat.
He started with the shelves to the left side of him. They were oak, tasteful even to his (unknowingly) classic predilection, and stained a dark and rich red. They were filled with books and framed photographs, knick knacks, and mementos. Each style of each decoration so varied he couldn't discern if the decorations were that of one person with diverse likes or many people with individual preferences. A large framed photo in the middle caught his attention.
"I promise, over dinner, Frodo."
"Might want to work - Nat!"
Wiggling under the blankets to get comfortable, Tony asked, "Why is he here?"
See you all tomorrow!
He raised his fist and rapped three times on the door. Howard answered immediately.
That had Tony chuckling, "Oh, is he now?"
is useful.
Tony's eyes dropped to the sandwich, eyelashes fluttering in his cheeks. "I know."
Maria had done what she could, but her hands were tied. There was only so much she could do to protect Tony. It was the same with Jarvis. With Ana. No one could protect him from the angry fists or the poisonous tongue of his father.
Gathering his dirty clothes and throwing them into the hamper, he called out to JARVIS, "Can you please tell Tony breakfast is ready?"
He held him at night and felt the pounds as they eroded away from Tony's body, did his best to soothe the pressure that bloated his belly with soft circular motions, watched as his skin became pale, and coaxed him through the heart palpitations.
"So good, baby. You feel so good on me," Steve kept up the stream of praise, letting it rain down upon Tony like the silver condensation rolled on the windows. "So beautiful, so perfect."
He snatched himself away, leaning up and standing, trying hard to get his body back under control.
The last Steve saw was the steadying darkness growing around both of them before he slipped into sleep, his arms protectively around Tony's body.
"Requests. Listen, I only got about ten minutes." Standing, he stepped annoyingly over Steve and righted the desk chair, sitting in it and scrolling through what Steve had already written. "I saw this porn recently, where the guy was sitting in the top's lap, like facing him? And he was fucking him so hard the bottom was digging his nails into his back and leaving marks. It was hot. You could totally have Steve do that to Tony."
Bruce nodded, confidence in the situation growing within him. Perhaps he wasn't too late in speaking with Howard; perhaps it had happened at just the right time. "That, right there, is what I wanted to hear." In his mind, the Other Guy tilted his head, intrigued.
So he did.
"Classy as usual."
"I know. I'm sorry it took me so long to figure out. I feel like I wasted so much time when all I've wanted was to be with you. If you'd have me, I mean." He looked down, self-conscious and unsure of himself all at once. "I know I don't have the greatest past, and I know I'm damaged. I just wondered if you'd have me anyway. Because you're all I think about." It was hard, baring himself like he was, opening up to the vulnerabilities he so often tried to hide.
Shifting Tony in his arms, Rhodey leaned down and whispered into Tony's ear, a wide smirk stretched across his face, "Team Jess."
"Later," Tony promised. Lying back down, he tugged the covers up. "Stay with me?"
Rhodey traded a loaded look with Thor, who was nearest to him, and resolutely moved behind the couch that Tony was seated on, offering silent solidarity with his best friend. Nat glanced at Clint, and seeing her own best friend looking afraid as well, she did the same, walking to stand near him. It did wonders to bolster her mood. She didn't know what she would do without them, any of them.
"Tony." Shaking his head, Steve kissed him. "I love you. Now hang tight, I'll be back soon. I need to go deal with your father."
"You really do got a smart mouth." A little bit of Brooklyn slipped through and Tony was surprised at the way it tingled through him.
he heard a voice in his head. He started swaying in the place with him.
he sighed. “Is it lunch all ready?” he asked, walking into the room and putting down the laundry basket in the corner. “When did laundry become so interesting that you forgot-” Tony paused, as he turned around and saw the empty satchel in his husbands hands.
‘You always tell your students never to judge a book by its cover honey. It also goes for people. The media exaggerates, shows people like angels or demons. I’m sure he’s sweet’ her mom reassured her. ‘How do you know?’ she asked, to gain that confidence from her mom. ‘He has his mother’s eyes,'' Sarah said with a sweet smile and a soft voice.
he said as the Live was about to start. Steve was too stunned to follow up on the cues. Later when Nat and others asked him what happened,
Steve sat in front of the easel feeling confused, elated, and hurt. Tony had kissed him and he had left the arena. He ran back home to clear his mind; he destroyed several punching bags and now his last resort, painting. It doesn’t help that everything around him reminds him of Tony. He came home to the Stark tower (even though it’s called Avengers tower now), he destroyed punching bags specially reinforced for him by Tony. Now he is sitting in front of a blank page and his mind conjures up images of Tony. Like he hadn’t filled 3 sketchbooks already.
Steve shouted and ducked when everyone gave him a look.
He is hit with a warm smell.
“Pepper Potts, My girlfriend and CEO of Stark Industries. She Invited me and Steve” she said with an innocent voice. Steve nodded in unison.
“How do you ask out a guy you have never met? Yes, he is a good, smart, sassy, and sarcastic little shit, which is exactly my type. We have so many inside jokes and flirty remarks that half the studio thinks we are an item already. Still, I don’t know if he’s single or swings my way Pep” he sighed rubbing his face. He could have asked anyone who it is or could have hacked into SHIELD servers and got a name. But knowing who it is would make it more real and Tony liked to live this in the fantasy of his mind.
She remembers Bucky arguing with Sarah about the marriage. She explained it to him later. She remembers Bucky's face. The expression he wears now in the mirror behind her was the same expression when she explained to him. “You could just bail now you know,” Bucky said with a sad smile standing behind her. “You know I can't,” she returned his sad smile. “Promise me. ‘til the end of the line. No matter who you are or what you become after this, I am your brother, and you are my little sister. If he hurts you, no matter how small or big it is, I’ll destroy him.,” He said with a fierce determination in his eyes. “Jeez Buck, Don’t make the guy run over the hill even before he meets me,” she said, crushing the need to hold on to Bucky.
The last couple of thoughts made him angry and hurt him deeply. He knows he has to confront Tony but, a small part of him was too scared that those last couple of thoughts will become true if Tony says it out loud. He was brought out of his misery by JARVISs’ voice telling him that Tony is requesting access to his floor. He wants to say no. He wants to hide and live in blissful ignorance. But Steve never backed out of a challenge. He told JARVIS to let him in and squared his shoulders for what’s coming.
“Buck”,
"I thought I would try and make you more happy. I don't spend a lot of time with you. Our work is hectic and I'm always travelling for SI or stuck in the lab or with paper work . You deserve better Steve. Not someone who couldn't cook or give you a great present and surprise for the anniversary." Tony said in a small voice.
Speaking of Stark was as same as the newsreels made him be. It’s been a week since she had seen him. She learned a few things about Stark. One, He flirts with everything that breathes. Throwing cheeky smiles and come-ons at men and women. Two, He just doesn’t care.
“ -Is in June. Please, don't harangue me about stuff that's way, way, down...,” he cut her off.
“And I forgot to ask you, how’s Sarah? I checked in with- “
now for the date...😈
“We don’t have music..”
“Well, I didn’t do anything,” Nat said with a smirk.
“7, Chinese, My treat” Bucky said, standing up and close to Sam with a flirty look.
“Remind me. Why are we doing this again?” asked Clint measuring the flour. “We are doing this because Steve  loved this and I want to surprise him,'' Tony glared at the archer. “ You can order it, you know,” Clint  sighed into the fridge, searching  for a milk carton. “ Come on birdbrain, it’s not that tough, it’s chemistry” Tony  said. “ Oh yeah, now you know why I was in the circus,” the archer said.
Tony let out a frustrated sigh after a while of mingling. He had been excited when Mr. Brooklyn had said yes. So excited that he forgot the details like name. He had a brief moment of panic when Rhodey pointed out.
his brain screamed “I mean uh yes- uh dinner is fine” He said, swallowing and rubbing his suddenly sweaty hands on his pants.
“We need new heroes, new captain blah blah and shenanigans would happen and Boom new Captain America” he sighed. “I don’t think they would create new Super Soldiers,” Steve said, looking far away.
(See the end of the chapter for
Other than that, her days were still. When she woke up late to an empty fridge on the first day, she asked JARVIS about food. She was directed to a scarcely stocked Pantry, many of which were expired. When asked about grocery shopping, JARVIS showed her a list made by Ms. Potts. She got to know that the grocery store was miles away from here and everything has been delivered so far. She added a few more to the list and ordered groceries. She cooked for herself, and leftovers were stocked in the fridge.
“Hey what’s Stark doing here?” came another voice, making Bucky stiff in his seat. “Hey sam! Just here to kiss my guy” Tony said, kissing Steve’s cheeks. “Well, glad you guys got your heads outta your asses” he said, high fiving Clint.
who's team are you on? Nat, Clint or bucky?
"Babe what the hell happened?!" Steve asked him, bewildered. "uh-I - um - well you know-" god he canNOT lie to Steve. "I tried to bake you your favorite Red velvet cake for our anniversary. I already cleaned our house and did the laundry and dishes...which are ruined… i was about to get some flowers and pick you up from SHIELD and surprise you and everything is shit now-" Is it hard to breathe? everything is ruined. oh god-
He walks through the open and bent-over gate, spotting chains coiled on the ground that Tony must have broken on his way in. Steve drapes them over an overgrown hedge and steps past the graffitied walls and broken beer bottles that now grace their grounds. It breaks his heart to see it and he wonders how Tony had reacted, seeing his mother’s mansion in tatters and abused like this. He shakes his head, stepping through the doors and into the foyer.
“Those things came out of these huge ships in Wakanda,” Bruce said, “Maybe when they lost to us here, they had one waiting, but we killed their leaders before it could open.”
“Is he okay?”
"Oh thank god," Tony pressed kisses to Anna's head, "Hey it's okay, baby-girl. It's okay. Cap got the monster, it's gone." She refused to let go of him however and Steve walked around to put a hand on her head.
The penthouse had been Tony’s back when the tower had first been in use but now the entire area has been cleared out. Instead, there’s another communal area with a rota of meal-times. He glances at it as he passes, noting what must be the times that Tony is given food in his isolation. There’s a pile of clothes on a chair, dirty and unwashed. The socks are balled up on the floor and he kicks them aside to get where he needs to be.
“To the Hole.” He says and Steve frowns, walking toward him. He steps on something that cracks and glances down to see an ident-card beneath his boot. It’s Logan’s and he sighs, picking it up and placing it on an overturned desk. Despite the broken window, the lab is mostly in shape, and the tables have only curled by the edges, every tool or kit in here just black but still intact.
It’s dark but still quite intact, a large hole in its middle, but other than that it’s pretty stable. The stairs look hazardous however, with steps missing and breaks gaping between the broken banister. He climbs over it carefully, checking its stability before placing each foot down, until he’s upstairs.
Tony stares at him and when he steps forward, Steve hears a clink of metal. He glances down and sees a chain wrapped around Tony’s ankle; it winds down toward a small hook in the floor and he feels sick looking at it. Tony notices.
with an axe!"
“Hi Daddy,” She said mid-yawn and Tony picked her up to give her a kiss, putting her down on a chair once he was done.
He remembers Tony from last night, kissing him and wishing he hadn’t been real. Wanting a ghost of Steve who would at least give him what he wanted before he died.
“You moved it, remember?” Steve lies and he shouldn’t do this, he shouldn’t encourage an already delusional mind, but the mansion’s dangerous and they need to leave. “To my flat.” Tony looks at him, “You said it would be easier to dress there.”
"If you say so." He counted everything that he'd packed away and added it to the inventory list that they had hanging in the kitchen. There was a picture of the Hulk, drawn crudely with crayon and stuck to the fridge beside it, and it made Tony smile every time he saw it.
His tears bubble up and he almost screams when Jess suddenly speaks, looking out the window, “Angry Sky.” She says and Steve looks up. Despite being past sun rise now, the sky is a dark red, rain clouds rolling through and over what had been pure blue not ten minutes ago.
Tony glances around, his eyes dark and wide, “No that’s – I just saw Janet. She was just here …” He points at a hollow entry-way, where there had once been a doorway leading toward the main bedrooms. Steve remembers mistletoe being hung over it and Halloween decorations dangling down to spook half-asleep Avengers.
He smiled, pushing her hair back from her face though some strands remained stuck to her wet cheeks. The two of them stayed with her until she calmed down and eventually, she lay back in bed. Natasha and Bruce had barricaded the broken window as best as they could in the meantime and the wound on Bruce’s stomach was already healing thanks to the Hulk.
had been a lie. Probe-3 was useless too and Probe-4 was stuck in orbit around a barren planet with seven moons.
More join them and he hears Tony panting and gasping in the dark and he realises that this is an alarm. Osborn’s creation no doubt and it’s no fucking wonder Tony’s as confused as he is.
And now he’s dead.
No one says anything until eventually, Bucky straightens, “Shield put him in confinement.” He says, “In the dark.” Steve swallows past a very tight throat, “He probably means that.”
“Fuck,” He gasps, “Thanks.” He shakes his head with a jerk, blinking sharply, “Wow. I’ll uh, I’ll go now. Be careful up here.”
“I’m going back to the Hole?” Tony asks, sounding calmer now but still so scared.
“I’m fine.” She told him, sniffing, “I was just a – little scared.”
“No.” Tony says, “A glow. It blew Janet up but she came through. Like a light. A butterfly.”
Inside is pitch black, shadows moving as the door slides open. Then a single light flickers on and he sees Tony sitting on the edge of a mattress with his head in his hands. He looks up when he hears the door, squinting and shielding his face from the light, and Steve’s chest aches when he looks at him.
“Let me look at that,” He offers, stepping forward to take Tony’s hand but it’s snatched away from him before he can even begin to inspect it.
“I want you to show some decency for a man you
“Well I’m sorry but I can’t leave her here alone.” Tony said, “I can’t. I’d just keep thinking that I’d come back and – one of them – or some angry civilian came – I can’t.”
He guesses her intent before she even speaks and only lets her in because of her appearance, aware of what his answer will be before she asks.
while you survive. Otherwise there's no point."
"What if I wanted you to trust me?" She asked.
“To stop you from walking away.” Steve answers, “And to ask why Tony’s mind is such a concern to Shield when he’s not an Avenger anymore. He isn’t a danger to anyone but himself like this.”
Tony?” He barks and Tony flinches.
"Yeah I know. But all we can do now is continue to plan," Steve said, "And hope that when we defeat Thanos, we can bring them back." He pulled free the cans that Tony had found and put them away in the cupboards, along with packets of instant noodles and soup, and then a large Barbie Doll. He held it a little longer before eventually giving Tony a look.
He remembers Janet laughing at her pranks and almost smiles, but he remembers her funeral too.
Steve put the book down, "Tony. It's a book about a magical beanstalk, I think she's smarter than that."
“The moon?” Steve asks and Tony’s look is so close to one he would have given years ago that Steve almost forgets what has happened between them.
“That wasn’t him.” Jess says, “That was just a suit. Tony wasn’t in the field with Osborn.” She doesn’t offer anything else and Steve sighs.
He doesn’t know what to ask but she shakes her head anyway.
"Okay - "
She put a hand under his chin and turned his face toward hers, "Tony, any day Thanos could get bored and could use his glove again. Anything could happen. And even if he doesn’t, we're planning to kill him and that's going to be a hell of a fight," He tried to look away but she wouldn't let him, "Don't begrudge yourself any happiness you can find until that day.
“The dark calms him down?” He asks, “The dark – ? Pitch black darkness calms Tony Stark down?”
“You’re forgiving me?” Tony asks, wonder in his voice, and Steve wants to punch his hand through a wall.
“Janet is DEAD!” Steve grabs him by the shoulders, yelling, “She’s dead Tony. The mansion’s gone, she’s dead and you’re delusional.”
of them to have been taken? Jesus."
“Tony,” Steve climbs into the lab to join him, “Tony, I told you, we need to go.”
"But I didn't knock on any doors!
The Saturday crowd was out: couples loaded up with buys from the farmer's market in the park, twenty-somethings lugging themselves to brunch after a night spent partying, and parents chasing their children down the sidewalks, searching for something to do now that the weekend was here. He weaved his way through them, keeping his eyes down and acting like he was one of them. Just a regular guy out for a stroll. No Hulk. No world-saving.
But Tony wasn't listening, he was out of the chair in a heartbeat, blankets forgotten on the ground, and twisting Steve's arm to see. "How did this happen?" he snapped.
"I, uh, did a test for Nat. Results came back." Bruce said, eyeing the paper just in case he got something wrong (he didn't).
"How can you expect me to hurt him knowing I… knowing what I know now. I can do better!"
"You've done a lot of asinine things, but this? How? How did you get here? What are you playing with, Howard?" Steve snapped, and Howard didn't like how angry Steve was making him feel. He had searched for too long, had loved the man like he was family. He didn't like being fearful. This was how the Nazis must have felt coming up against him. This was Captain America, not Steve Rogers.
Steve sat back. Amazed at what he was seeing. Tony had every right to be angry. To be furious and upset. But there he was, gently getting Howard changed and moving him to lay under the covers.
"Not at all." Clint said, checking his watch. "I gotta go. I'll send you the link to that porn, seriously, hot as fuck." He stood. "I'll take the door this time, also, nice mug." And he was gone.
"I love him, Pepper."
"I don't know how you were raised," the woman spoke again, "but if your father never told you, I will. No one has the right to touch you unless you explicitly say it's okay."
"Steve!"
In the moments between him trying to stand up and hitting the ground unconscious, his fingers twitch over the ghost of the blanket, muscle memory from years of seeking comfort.
He swallowed. He needed Tony. Needed to feel him, needed to wrap himself up with him. Anything to crush down the complicated emotions that burned just under his skin. His anger towards Howard, his protective - and frankly possessive - love for Tony. He knew he needed to let Tony run his own life, but the fear of Tony being hurt, of losing him either physically or emotionally if all the work they did to help his Post Traumatic Stress Disorder was ruined because of Howard…
Tony's smile widened. "Step into my office," he stood with a flourish. The man nodded, his nerves undercutting the carefree vibe he was attempting to send. Not a copper, then. Just an
"Jesus Christ." The ice fell to Howard's lap. "How bad?"
"I'm just saying, lead with that next time."
"What are you planning, Stark?"
She sighed, "He knew he did something wrong, and even though he doesn't know what it is, he feels
"Nothing! I'll get the butter!"
Natasha was babysitting Howard, and Steve and Bruce were distracting Tony, so that left him. And if he were honest with himself, there was a little monster of guilt doing a jig in his stomach. He needed to do
"Shouldn't Tony get final say?"
He managed to conceal his surprise, which earned him a few points in Natasha's book. "Well, hello there, gorgeous."
"How did you figure it out?" Clint asked, plucking the yellow pad from Hill's hands. Changing the subject was an art form for him. She didn't need to know that the mess included Steve as well.
(See the end of the chapter for
what they did. They didn't want to mess with the status quo because it
Her mouth dropped.
Because it
His phone rings, and Steve is momentarily elated. It's Tony! It's Tony telling him he's okay. It's Tony saying that there was a mistake, he got the flight number wrong when he informed Bruce, he's really still sitting in the airport, waiting for his gate to be called, he's-
"I want to go home. Back to the tower. I need to talk to Howard and end this once and for all." Looking up, he caught Steve's eyes, shining in the dim light of the late afternoon. "Can you get the quinjet ready?"
"I'm not going to say it again, Steve," Tony responded dangerously. "I wasn't abused. Howard was a bastard, but I'm not some charity case. I don't
"God yes, I'm starving." He spun on his feet, facing the opposite direction and towards the back of the wall with the Chitauri ship on it.
Barton was growing wild, his panting stuttering as he closed in on his orgasm. "Smack him again." Steve didn't hesitate. "Fuck, look at how his muscles react."
, but no bodily damage. Which meant that Bruce was free to collapse with Clint back into the seats, laughing and snorting like children.
His legs, stretched up the back of the couch with the knees bent over the top, kicked up and down comically, "Very!"
Nodding his thanks, Bruce entered the building, waiting for Steve before they set off to the elevator. Steve eyed him. "You okay?"
"No argument there. But why?"
"I can't- I mean, it's not fair-" He sighed and pushed through the rapid beating of his heart and the tightness in his chest. Steve looked up, worriedly. "This whole - I don't know what to call it. Situation? - Hasn't been at all fair to you. I put you in a position you never should have had to be in."
are out to lunch." He handed over the coffee, smiling. "I was told I should be afraid of you."
"Eighteen months," he repeated. "All the info is in here," he said, tapping the file again. "Start with tour dates, they have an album set to come out in January. Focus on promotion, on setting up a public image of an old group with a fresh sound. Go into your first meeting
"I don't know," Tony smirked, flipping them so he straddled Steve's hips, "I think I need another apology."
Stepping back from the door, Howard gestured for Tony to enter. He felt a warmth flush up his face at being called
Howard took one step, and then another, his unease palpable. Bruce figured he only came to his apartment at the request of Thor, who no one could easily say no to (at least Bruce couldn't). "If you think it can be fixed," Howard spoke to the wall beyond Bruce's head, his back stiff with his fear.
needed time to digest. He was similar to Steve in that regard, maybe in a different way, but it was the same need to have a few minutes to work through whatever was going on in his head. Tony just processed some things quicker.
Steve and Bruce quieted, looking at him with worried eyes. "Yeah," Bruce answered, "I made plenty."
But he can't. He doesn't know why. Doesn't understand why he's squandering his second chance, but he just can't say it out loud. It's a promise broken, he's fully aware, but when he attempts to formulate the words on his tongue, nothing happens.
"You can also make things go boom."
"Oh, come on! His pancakes are legendary!" She yelled, her arms out in pleading.
"Maybe around the waist." He tried to look offended by that. He really did. She continued, "He's a genius, why is this so hard?"
JARVIS answered him with a tone that represented clear amusement to Tony. "No, Sir, he was being very careful."
Steve sighed and hit the button for the penthouse. "Natasha, Clint, and even our resident homebody, Bruce, went to the grocery store."
all the damn time! Like unless he had something to offer, he's worthless! Jesus," his face swung back and forth between Clint and Natasha, "You guys
"Promise."
"I know better than them all. You're all stupid boys." She smirked. "And I'm not." Like that answered
Steve couldn't say no. He pushed a second finger in, spreading them, feeling along the velvety walls inside of Tony; he was so tight. His other hand went to Tony's dick, a first for him as he pulled it slowly. Through it all, the hardness hadn't waned. Tony wanted this. He wanted this badly.
"Thor actually beat you to it."
"Oh, shoot!" Whipping around, Steve grabbed the pot holders and lifted them from the heat to place onto an unused burner. "Are you going to be okay?" he asked, retrieving the strainer from the cupboard and placing it in the sink.
did my job."
He tucked his head under Steve's chin, curling up and picking at his fingers again. Steve wondered at how young Tony could look sometimes. How much did his lack of childhood mess him up? How much of that loss of innocence flooded into the adult he loved so deeply it sometimes hurt. "Tony," Steve tried, pulling the offending hand away. Tony made a small sound of protest, but when Steve wouldn't let go of his hand, he turned more into Steve's chest, and huffed in irritation. It barely concealed his distress.
"That sounds perfect. And I think chocolate chip pancakes would go splendidly." Turning to face Tony, Steve places his hand on his shoulder. Tony knows a serious moment is coming, and it unsettles him just a little, but Steve is still smiling. And that helps. That always helps. "Thank you, for real. Tony, I- I really needed this."
"Anthony Stark?"
"Worth a shot." Howard relented with an exaggerated sigh. "So, what floor will you give me? And don't say 22. I know what happens on that floor now!"
There was a silence. It spread from person to person and Tony shifted uncomfortably on his heels. Every pair of eyes was trained on him. "Okay! So, processed pork. Bring it on."
"It's not that I- What I mean to say is-" Howard huffed, inpatient with his own answers. "Can I be frank? Without you, ah- you know," he motioned to Mjolnir. "Natasha told me about you and I've, uh, I've seen videos of exactly what it is that you can do with that thing."
"I said--" Howard shuffled forward, looking down and back up to catch Steve's eyes, "--I'm sorry. I reacted badly, but I don't-- What I mean to say is--" He paused, taking a deep breath. "I couldn't imagine anyone better to be with my son. I know you'll protect him and love him. But if you break his heart, I will slaughter you. I know a guy." He ended with a smile and a shrug, but all Steve could see were Tony's eyes, filled with tears, ending the very relationship Howard was approving.
Howard felt like scum. He dropped his hand and bolted from the room.
"You know," Rhodey said as the helmet came off, "I'm a little tired of being met out here by the rest of the Avengers. My heart can't take it. Just tell me he's okay?"
"As am I," Thor admitted with a grin. "But what is the fun of getting it right all the time? Imperfection is the fun of life. Learning is the icing, like this," he chuckled, swiping some icing on his finger and licking it off. "It makes things so much sweeter."
"Hawkeye," Steve warned, but a brilliant flash of red and gold streaked through the sky, pulling his attention from not only Clint but also the creature and its rider. With a start, Steve realized that this was the first time since before Howard came that Tony flew the suit. The injustice of their situation weighed heavily on Steve's shoulders. It wasn't right. Flying made Tony happy, and he hadn't been able to do it.
"Oh, Tony," Steve whispered, getting to his feet and sitting next to him. He tugged the afghan from the back of the couch and wrapped it around his shoulders. It was time for maximum comfort (patent pending), and he pulled Tony's legs over his lap, drawing him close enough to wrap his arms around him.
"Who's side are you on?" Steve snapped, thunking his glass onto the table.
He was able to see a future with her.
"Show you what?"
I'd like to thank several people in helping make this fic a reality. Shannon, the bringer of plot bunnies who goaded me into this. Lan, for patiently beta-ing for me and her uncanny ability to decipher my typos. Tiffany for her unfailing encouragement and words of wisdom. And Steph and Emma for taking the time to read the last chapter and offer words of advice. And YOU! The readers! I could never have done this without your kind words and squeeing! I love each and every one of you!
Tony's head popped over from the back of the couch. "Steve's mean."
Tony looked up from his place on the floor. "Never better."
"But delicious."
"Show me that gorgeous ass."
Quietly, Tony looks down at his feet, trying not to stumble as they make their way across East 42nd. He is unsure of how to answer. This whole conversation is out of his comfort zone, but that doesn't lessen its importance. "No," he says at long last as they cross over 5th Avenue, "you're absolutely right. In a utopian world, that's how it would have happened, but just because it didn't doesn't mean it's in any way your fault. Steve," Tony sighs and rubs his gloved hand over his face, his cold nose sniffling a little with the chill, "You're a good man. A great one. You're an amazing team leader, a legitimate superhero, and you possess the qualities that people look for in a true role model. You go at it every day with nothing but your best, and you have no ego about it.
he thought to himself.
“Come on Barnes-”
" THEY ARE USED TO SWITCH OFF THE STOVES!!!"
“...Me and Rhodey,” Pepper replied, with a blank face.
“Hey!”, Steve said.
Now here he is, in the corner of the room , trying to be invisible.  All sorts of bad scenarios ran through his mind and made him anxious. He didn’t want Tony to see him like this. He didn’t know what made Tony ask him out but it sure wasn’t his gangly self. Tony might have asked out thinking he was some big, handsome, guy from Brooklyn. He didn’t want to see disappointment in those eyes when they meet.
“And we are going in for a short commercial break-” , Tony’s voice broke through Steve’s voice. He scrolled through his script to see the content for the next part and  groaned as he read content for the Twitter session.
he thinks as he walks into his husband setting the table for lunch.
Ms. Potts gave her a puzzled look. She was about to say something when a stout man in a dark suit, with dark curly hair and dark glasses, interrupted them. “Ms. Potts, it’s time,” he said, his voice neutral. “Okay. I guess I’ll see you soon, Stephanie,” Ms. Potts said. “Mrs. Stark?” the guy questioned. Suddenly, Stephanie was hit with the realization that she must leave. She must leave her home, her mom. She must leave everything she had and everything she wished for. “I- I need a moment. I’ll see you guys outside. Yeah,” Stephanie said as she walked away.
“-TONY- wait we all know you have a crush on him-”
He has to do this. This was how their relationship started. This is Steve’s favourite cake. Tony remembers that first party they had as a team, when Steve tried this cake. He remembers how Steve's eyes light up by its taste. They shared the last piece. This made them from teammates to friends and now to something more. The Velvety red, like his cheeks when he blushes,  he smiled thinking. “ Is this frosting thing supposed to be hard to mix?” Clint asked, breaking him out of the thought.
Honestly, It was hard to be the face of American Television. With his Stark charm and witty comebacks, Tony is the dream of every producer and director of reality television. His days are run by shooting, meetings, promos, call sheets, contracts, scripts, make-ups, lights, and cameras. The nights run him down with parties, smooching, and fake smiles with fake people. But he would never regret this. Tony was born for the spotlight. Anthony Stark, the Son of Industrial Titan, Howard Stark, was seen as the chip of the old block. When he built his first engine at age 4 and first AI at age 16, everyone including his father was proud that he’s gonna take over the Stark Legacy. Then it became inevitable because of his parent’s death which made him take over Stark Industries when he was 21. He worked hard and partied hard. One SNL appearance as a guest host intrigued him and the world so much that he started making occasional appearances in different programs. He was double-minded after that. His last straw was when the double-dealings and his God Father, Obadiah Stane’s betrayal came to light. He shut down the weapons production; made his PA and Best friend Pepper Potts the CEO and High tailed out of the business. He struck a deal with Director Fury of SHIELD networks. Now, he gets to be daytime Emmy award nominee for best talk show host and the mind behind Stark Industries R&D.
Tony had stood in his own way long enough. It was time for action. If he even had a modicum of a chance at happiness with Steve, this was it, right? He couldn't blow it.
The blond reared back slightly at that, looking concerned. "Why did you need comforting?" Steve asked, his brow furrowing. He eyes flitted over Tony's face, searching for an answer.
"Spare a dollar?" The man held his hand out, his palm covered by greyed fingerless gloves. "I haven't eaten in three days," he pleaded, "just a dollar. That's nothing to you."
Tony gave a one shouldered shrug, "And I'm okay with that. I didn't exactly picture myself as an adult and having to make total lifestyle changes. It wasn't like I just woke up one day and went, hey! This seems like a fun endeavor!" There was more laughter as the guests all looked on understanding. "I don't even know what triggered it," Tony said, his eyebrows raised in mirth and his head shaking in confusion. "But here I stand before you," he held his arms out, so reminiscent of the Jericho demonstration he faltered, for just a second, before carrying on, "as one of you. And I mean to help in any way I can. If you'll have me, that is."
She smacked his fingers and he made a face, foiled again! "StonyFan1918? Really? He hasn't figured out it yet?"
Everything in Tony froze up at that moment. He could feel his brain screaming at him. Be logical! Don't freak out!
Tony's fist was a blur on his own cock, the vibrator pulsing against him. His mouth hung open, the moans like puffs of air, his lungs searing.
He looked up as she entered, setting his mug down and raising his eyebrows appreciatively. "Had I known there were so many beautiful women in the future, I would have come a lot sooner."
"Hey!"
"I'm all wide awake now, who's fault is that?" Tony groaned, rolling over and exposing his gorgeous backside. Steve was tempted, oh, was he ever, to just crawl back into bed and worship Tony until the sun came up and cows came home.
They narrowed their eyes at each other and burst out laughing. "Whatever!" Steve grinned, "Luke and Lorelei forever, at least?"
Steve answers the call and drops his head into his free hand. "Nat?" He's barely able to choke out her name.
And Howard would need him to do the same.
Bruce could talk to him, get him to understand that these days It was okay.
"The Other Guy is agitated," he tried, dropping the humor and going for logic, "and he knows something is up with Tony."
He looked incredulous. "Then why did you punch me if you knew I was joking?"
Tony was getting tired of chicken soup. It was one of the only things he could keep down. Clint made a big pot every other day, becoming such a pro at the recipe that he could now do it in his sleep.
Steve's smile is wider than the horizon; his eyes light up just as brightly like the sun peeking through the buildings. "We can't have that!" Taking the hat from Tony's hands, Steve deftly places it on the snowman's head. "There," he says, standing back to admire their work, "all finished."
Tony knows it's Steve. Now it's time to act. If only he wasn't a total hot mess. But there's sweetness, chocolate, reassurance, and a bathtub.
Nat and Thor were squabbling over what music to play while they ate, Clint was sneaking pieces of chicken from the aluminium foil covered dishes that Bruce had set in the middle of the table, and Tony was counting forks from the drawer.
The idea of starting a new life with a clean slate is a tantalizing thought, but as Yinsen had said, Tony has remaining work to do. He can start over again in fifty years; for now, he has to correct everything he has messed up in his life. He owes it to the soldiers he watched die. He owes it to Yinsen. It will be hard hiding what had actually transpired from Rhodey, Pepper, and Happy, and almost impossible to keep it from Obie, but Tony knows that sometimes the hardest decisions are worth it in the end. Regardless, he's lucky to have another chance to do right by them.
"Piece of rebar," Steve answered, knowing he was on shaky ground. "It fell, but I got out of the way."
Tony's right hand was pressed against his chin in agitation. He rocked side to side in the swivel chair, trading glances with Bruce who sat next to him.
"So, I'm forgiven then?" Steve murmured, nuzzling his cheek, his blue eyes softly falling closed as he inhaled Tony's scent.
"Oh," Tony breathes out, understanding. "That's why you want to find him?"
"There's no controlling this, Agent Romanoff, it's out there and there's video proof. Experts have been called into news stations to run facial recognition, the video and subsequent photos have been studied. They know it's Howard Stark."
Confused, Tony asked, "What do you mean?"
Chest feeling heavy, Tony turned to the shower and tried to step toward it, but his body felt like an immovable boulder. The thought of showering exhausted him. He couldn't do it. He just couldn't.
"I'm holding you to that."
The water sloshed dangerously close to the edge as they neared the end, picking up some speed, growing desperate for that second release, their soft moans filling the steamy bathroom.
Daring to look up, he caught the mother's eyes. She looked equal parts scared and fascinated.
Pepper plastered her usual
"That's a high task, Mr. IQ of 270." Another glare and Steve just looked satisfied. He continued, his tone seriouser than before, "He isn't an idiot, we know that, so he figured from the frosty reception-"
"I know, I know. It's gone now. Classic Clint and all that."
Avery spoke quietly when Tony didn't move to answer her, "This is common. He's okay. It's the fact that he finally knows what's wrong, that it isn't going to kill him. To have an answer."
"See, they remember what happened."Tony waves at his other bots, looking Dum-E up and down as the bot makes an almost sad sounding beep, going to turn around and dispose of the coffee somewhere else. Tony sighs, watching how Dum-E seems to move slowly away from him, as if he's trying to make him feel guilty. "Fine, I'll take the coffee. You're so petty."
"Then act like it's been because from my point of view, I'm starting to feel like we're 17 again."
"Well I ain't pretty."Tony mutters, brining the lighter down and taking the cigarette out from between his lips. He'd been tempted, an inching feeling under his skin since he had left the hospital because he might not smoke all of the time but he did when he was anxious and right now, he was very anxious.
Steve isn't sure what would've happened. It was his own fault. He knows better than to press Tony into a corner (or against a counter), push for questions and losing his temper when he doesn't get the answers he was seeking. Steve just hadn't been expecting him to be
Tony was not going to sit about and just wait to die, not when there was so much more that Tony wanted to do. There was still so much to see, to accomplish, projects to finish and places to visit and people to talk to, smile at, hug tightly, kiss passionately on the cheeks, lips, soft forehead kisses and butterfly soft kisses under the chin the way he use to kiss Steve when they were young and dumb and still didn't know what love was.
And then came the incident
, Howard's voice still rings in his ears as he digs the palms of his hands into his eyes, trying to push back the heavy pressure behind them.
Tony has the Stark Tab untucked from under his arm, it's glass screen illuminating the patients information along side doctor notes and Tony's own as he slides the curtain open of the ER cubical. There's so many notes alongside his profile, from way before he had joined the army it seems he has been in and out of hospital as much as Tony has, maybe even more, for stupidity and knucklehead situations nevertheless.
"You never know when you might need to use your elbows in a fight, Punk."
"And what would that be, sir?"
So, Tony had done the only logical and sane thing a person could do after stalking a man he had met at his ex's house years back and had not made direct contact with since then, and invited the man to dinner. A dinner was ambiguous, it left wasn't hostile or threatening and surely Bruce couldn't think of an excuse not to go.
that makes Steve grumble and scowl because
Steve had a weird, outgoing bunch of friends, all brought together because maybe they weren't all the brightest, or a jock, they weren't sorted into a popular group of meatheads and bimbos nor were they getting awards for being goodie two shoes.
"This is ridiculous."Steve continued to fume, cheeks punk and lips pouted, practically throwing the carton into the trolley."What's next, a bag of Spuds being 3 dollars? Paying for Water?"
"You going to love me and leave me, Doctor Stark?"And he looks so normal, so in his element that if it wasn't for the fact that James was visibly missing a limb, that you wouldn't think so in the slightest. So cocky and snarky and flirty and it weirdly makes Tony proud.
Although, it didn't stop Tony from enjoying the fun while it was being handed to him, he always just made sure to never end up in bed with him, or even yet, let him in the dorm or workshop. It works out, because Ty Stone is non the wiser that Tony knows who he is and Tony gets his unlimited supply of illegal drugs.
And okay, Steve may be your local hero who was ready to climb a tree to save your damn stupid cat or run to the local supermarket just because you forgot milk, but that didn't mean he didn't get into some sort of trouble. Bucky has had to drag Steves ass out of a handful of fights he has caught himself in, busted up in the face and bruised in the torso.
"No, I tend to find it hilarious to pose as a doctor. I guess it's just a habit I've obtained since I was a teenager."
Okay, and so what if he was a nice guy, had a body that was probably crafted by the gods and a face that anyone would die for, that didn't mean Steve was amazing at everything that he did, because let me tell you, He wasn't. Steve wasn't the honour student in his class, getting all of the A's and class president, no, he was the bellow average kid with a skill for art and spent more time in the gym than on school grounds.
"Howard."He nods his head in a sort of greeting, half of his body remaining hidden behind the bedroom door, not fully opening or exposing himself to the man in front of him. It's obvious that Maria is the one that has forced Howard up the stairs to talk to their son, Tony can tell by the way he has yet to leave.
"Dr Banner! Oh don't give me that face, we're in a professional environment, if I don't call you by your title then we just have to treat you like a patient and Stephen over here has
"He sounds...melodramatic?"Steve bites back a laugh, coming back to himself which Tony is thankful of. He doesn't want to dwell on his sexuality, it isn't a thing that Tony himself really swells on either.
"Tuesday."Rhodey deadpans, petting at Dumm-E's claw mindlessly.
Steve loved his odd group of friends because they might've been through a lot, and the fight an awful lot, but they always came back together at the end of the day.
"Wait, what?"Bucky looks like a startled deer in headlights and Tony would laugh if it wasn't for the fact that Bucky looks truly petrified at Tony's request.
"Yeah."He sighs, spinning in the chair for a second before he pauses, glancing up at Rhodey. The older of the two is already looking his way a Tony, a soft encouraging smile on his lips."I'm really glad that you're here, Honey Bear."
"Okay and I think this is an excellent time to say goodbye."Tony is blushing, trying to find anyway to end this conversation before Steve can figure out how much that Tony is affected by this."Take him to bed, not literal, but you know what I mean. Before he hurts himself."
And Tony had cried for his mom. He had cried not only for his loss, but hers too. He had cried for the abrupt end of her life long before the car crash, long before Tony had come along, but when the man she called her husband had wooed her, swung her off her feet, tipped her back in a passionate kiss, had courted for her hand. He cried for how such a man had changed, how she had been chained, how he had took her life and how Tony had taken hers too.
"It isn't Christmas, you're not allowed to roast me!"Clint is squawking, his entire face thunderous in anger and mouth full of chewed up bacon and eggs, something that makes Bruce's face scrunch up at the disgusting display of his own delicious looking food.
Steve lets out another breath, deciding to keep looking for Tony's hospital room. He kind of wishes that he knew his last name, it would make things so much easier and maybe then he could ask one of the nurses what number Tony's room is, but then again maybe they wouldn't give it to Steve because he isn't family nor a friend, they're strangers, kind of, they talked that one time so maybe they're now acquittances.
"Yes I know that, Captain Obvious."Tony rolls his eyes the minute that his glasses are perched on his nose."But I'm telling you that it was annoying as fucking hell, especially when it's the only thing you hear for 8 days straight, 24 hours a day. So I'm changing it."
It's a mothers groping fear for her son to get hurt, so badly enough that it leaves them scarred, disabled or dead. As a nurse and a mother, Sarah Rogers has had to witness the death of children, the Grieving of parents. It was the worse part of her job, to see a teen of Steves age be hooked up to life support machines or have life saving emergency surgery to fill the gaping hole in the middle of their chest.
"I would suggest you get yourself one, Mr. Barnes."Tony shifts the Stark Tab, cracked in its left hand corner from the slammed impact it had to endure moments ago in Tony's frustration and anger, onto his left hand so that he can use his other to dig inside a pocket of his coat, pulling out an old fashioned business card. He flicks it over, checks that it's correct before handing it to Bucky."Call them. They're small and quiet but trust me, they do their job."
But there he had been, defying those odds, in the same hospital, at the same time. But instead, of course, Tony no longer looked beaten and bruised from an explosion but a resident
, friend. Tony has been repeating those words for the last 12 hours, and still, it doesn't correct because Tony Stark doesn't have
"Who's that?"Clints voice startles Steve from his texting, fumbling with the mobile in his abnormally large hands as he struggles to catch it without it falling. His alerted action causes Natasha to swerve the car, earning annoyed honks of horns from other drivers and angered Russian Swears to be shouted out the window from Natasha.
"God, sometimes I wish you just stayed back in New York with Stephen because I barely see you and then when I do see you you give me chronic migraines and constant anxiety."
"Tony, you don't need to do
The hand gives his a squeeze, a squeeze to gain attention but to show affection and it makes Tony look up from where he's staring until he's looking into those eyes, baby blue and bright, open and caring and curious and worried all mashed into one. He looks away, feeling ashamed, there's fingers under his chin that pulls him back to those eyes, to a blue so bright like sapphires and a face so beautiful and set.
They're insider photographs and Tony knows exactly who took them.
"Yes you fucking should've."The voice is muffled behind scarred hands, mumbled through chapped lips, caught between blubbered hiccups and choked tears. And really, what times are Tony talking about when she
"So, what have you been up to?"You would think that small talk is Tony's forte but the tension is so thick in his office that it physically makes him stuffy and uncomfortable, god knows how he would have dealt if Steve had been looming over his shoulder.
Steve wonders what Tony will be doing this Christmas, would he be spending it with his family and friends? Would he spending it alone in a hospital room stuck to a heart monitor? The scars that surrounded Tony's arms were self inflicted, Steve isn't an idiot and the way there was no evidence of any family or belongings in the hospital room made it clear that Tony has been alone all this time.
Time seems to fly in, with the two of them changing in the bedroom and bathroom before Tony is being dragged away for make up and returning only when the make up artist that his Mother hired has done her best to cover up the healing scars that are inflicting his face. Sulkily, Tony obliges to having his hair styled, taming the unruly nest of curls that he's been blessed with but yet his mother hates that he has.
up to Tony, he will never marry because to marry it means to tolerate someone and furthermore, it means for them to tolerate one back. Tony likes his sense of freedom, even if freedom is far from the word of what he actually is, with Obie looming over his shoulder, managing all of his affairs and disposing of the ones that seem to cause trouble when Tony sticks his dick in the wrong princess to be or snorts cocaine off of a senator who doesn't want to be wangle with Tony Stark; Genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist.
"If we promise not to interrupt," Rhodey spoke up, his head cocked to the side, "will you just-" he gestured mildly, twirling his wrist, "-you know, just say it?"
Howard was speechless for a few moments, "Steve," he spoke at last, "I don't know what I did, but I
"Yeah, okay. Uh, you want me to call a car?"
"It is!" Tony pulled back, stepping away from Steve like he felt he didn't deserve comfort or human contact. It was just one more thing for Steve to hate Howard for. "This is all my fault! I started this mess the second I fled from the room when Howard appeared!"
