“John? Are you even listening anymore?” Sherlock asked, his face turned toward his flatmate with a furrowed brow.
“Is he just going to let his things on the table like that?” the landlady wondered, completely ignoring him. “I told him, always bring your cups back to the sink.”
Once outside, he walked down the street, watching without realizing it the mist caused by his breath coming in contact with the chilly air of a december night, the vapors appearing and disappearing as the lights of the cars illuminated him. Lost in his thoughts, he raised the collar of his coat and continued walking until he saw a cab.
“Yes, you cock," said John with another laugh, something affectionate in his eyes, "but this is not as specific. You can get loose a little.”
Sherlock wasn’t sure where to start. He tried to put himself to the place of someone doing this, like he would for the mind of a criminal committing a crime, but it was so different. He had to guess. He wasn’t used to guessing. Only deducting. He had to find words to excite this man -whatever his name was, no relevant. It was an exercise at deducting, and a challenge for his mind. It would do him good to work his neurons after all the boring cases he had had lately. He thought about the biological texts he read in college, and an idea started to form itself in his head.
Sherlock eventually relaxed around him, his walls inviting John further inside. He gave the brunet a look, waiting for the permission. Sherlock opened his eyes and almost imperceptibly nodded, one of his hand wrapping around John’s nape. John started to push, antagonizing slow and careful until he was fully in. He let out a whimper when Sherlock squeezed experimentally around his cock.
“So, as I was saying, since he found out she was cheating on him with an athlete, he’s been concerned about his weight and believes that the knowledge of his diabete might make her go away for good and…”
“Need to be inside you,” John told him with a hoarse voice. Sherlock smiled for a second, but then something changed in his eyes, so quickly that the blond couldn’t even see him move. Before he knew it they were plastered together and Sherlock was kissing him, filthy and or so erotic.
The doctor came back from the kitchen, sitting down in his chair with two cups of tea, placing them on the table and giving Sherlock a small smile.
John looked up from his computer screen, face puzzled as his brain researched for an information. "That reminds me of something. Did you have a similar case before?"
The detective just seemed more lost. “Well of course you did, you formulated a sentence with an interrogative structure. Do you know you are very incoherent sometimes? It’s extremely exhausting to try and keep up.”
“When you look at me,” the blond started, “I see breathtaking, unique eyes I’ve never seen before staring at me a way I’ve never been stared at before. When I see your cheekbones, I think of how they elegantly form you face, sharp just like your mind. And I adore your mind. They fit you. Nothing about you is weird. It’s perfect.” He dropped a kiss on Sherlock’s mouth. “When I look at your lips, I think of all the things you texted me, all the things I’m physically suffering for you to do. Every time I walked past you for the last two months, I’ve been dying to comb my fingers through your hair, to feel if it was as soft as it looked.” He pressed his lips against each of the detective’s fingers. “And your hands, those dexterous, long fingers, the thought of them touching me, Jesus. Your legs…” He looked up to gaze at Sherlock in the eyes. “And don’t even get me started about your mind. Because I could go on for hours, about that sharp, funny, sexy and cleverest mind I’ve ever seen.”
“Deduce it,” he answered, and passed his fingertips along the length. He brought one of the little beads of cum to his tongue, unable to resist the urge. Sherlock stared at him from the corner of his eye as John sucked on his index. The detective was hypnotized, mouth gaping. Then he closed it to moan when John started pumping his shaft, slowly, stroking the head with his thumb on each way down. He resumed his forgotten job at marking the brunet’s neck, smirking when he felt fingers curl in his hair. He moaned encouragingly when he felt Sherlock rock into Joh’s palm and back against his dick.
As the page appeared on the screen, John read the words he had typed what seemed a lifetime ago, which it kind of was. Another life that seemed fuzzy when he tried to remember it, as if nothing were clear, as if nothing made sense then. Everything was so different back then. He couldn’t help but smile while thinking about just how much had changed, step by step, until his life became the wonder it was today.
“What are you doing?” he asked with an alarmed voice. “You are going to ruin the whole operation! We’ll have to start over.”
That last word made the doctor tense up a little as a reminder of the night before, but thankfully Sherlock had already turned his back and was prompting him to follow him in the flat.
“Alright. Are you allowed here?” he asked, turning to the doctor. “You need an authorization from my superiors.”
“No, he didn’t, don’t worry. How was your case?” John asked, sitting in his chair and facing Sherlock.
“It’s of a childish obviousness. You always take either the pasta or the fish when we come here, but you’ve already have fish for lunch. Really, John, you shouldn’t have to ask that one.”
When he regained his senses after a blissful minute, he realized Sherlock was now moving in abrupt jerks against him, trying to stay still but failing. He was looking at John, eyes dark and mouth wet and slightly open, some of his locks damp against his forehead. John wondered how he had gone two months resisting to this man. “Ride my thigh, I want to feel you come against me,” he whispered hoarsely, and Sherlock growled, rubbing frantically until he started shaking, letting go and falling like a dead weight on John. The latter hold him gently as Sherlock became a sleepy contented mess. They stayed like this for a few minutes as they tried to regulate their breathing and come back to reality. At some point Sherlock disentangled himself from John, rolling on his side and looking at the ceiling.
“Anything from the trolley, dears?” asked the kindly old woman pushing the sweets cart as she slid open their compartment door. Sherlock shook his head, but John jumped up excitedly, pulling a small bag of money out of his pocket. He ended up ordering two pumpkin pasties, cauldron cakes, boxes of Bertie Bott’s Every Flavor Beans, and chocolate frogs. He then gave one of each to Sherlock, who looked up at John with surprise, unused to any type of kindness.
“John Watson,” the mystery man drawled, leaning back in his expensive-looking chair and steepling his fingers beneath his chin, an action John had watched Sherlock do on multiple occasions when trying to solve a rather difficult homework question or deduce something about a stranger. John swallowed hard, hands trembling by his sides. “What is it that makes you so special, John Watson?”
Welp, there it was. John was about to be kicked out of Professor Holmes’s potions class. And without this credit, he could kiss his dreams of becoming a Healer goodbye. Then again, he couldn’t say that he was surprised. He’d barely scraped by with an ‘E’ in the potions section of his OWLs, and Professor Lestrade had to convince Professor Holmes to let him into the class because man normally only took students that received an ‘O.’
Shoving his way through the crowd was G… G… Geoffrey Lestrade? Whatever. It was Lestrade, followed closely by fellow Gryffindor Sally Donovan and Sally’s Ravenclaw booty call Philip Anderson. Sherlock had always said that the sorting hat must have been confused when sorting Anderson into Ravenclaw, because as far as he had seen, the boy was stupider than every other idiot in this entire school. Of course, Sherlock’s disdain for Anderson was readily returned, and Donovan had always found joy in labeling Sherlock as a freak.
John was trembling by the time the girl had finished pacing, and he watched with wide, terrified eyes as an ornate door materialized on the wall opposite the tapestry. The girl who had been pacing walked over and opened the door, and the other led him into the mysterious room beyond.
The room burst into applause when the hat’s song was over, but John was too nervous to clap. He wanted so badly to be put into Gryffindor like his father. This was his chance to make his father truly proud of him.
“Hey, hey, calm down,” Greg said, throwing an arm around John’s shoulders. “Sally just likes to throw around accusations. I’ve talked to Sherlock, and he seems like a decent guy. Odd, but nice enough. Don’t let her get to you.”
A third finger now, scissoring him wider, preparing his hole for entry… Although, based on what Sherlock had felt pressed against him earlier, nothing would be able to prepare him for what was coming.
Sherlock,” John snapped, suddenly angry. He didn’t like the fact that Mycroft thought that his brother was so unlikable that John would need
Sherlock had turned away after concluding his monologue, but how he glanced back at John with wide eyes, as though he were hesitant to believe that he’d heard John correctly.
John stared at Sherlock for a second before asking, “How do you know those things about her? Do you know her?”
“Well why not? Don’t you want all of the ladies fawning over you?” Lestrade asked in what Sherlock assumed was a teasing manner, although he could never quite tell when someone was joking with him.
Donovan’s lip turned up into a sneer, and she guided Anderson away, casting one last disgusted look over her shoulder before merging with the sea of scarlet and gold. As they disappeared, a small, mousy girl sporting numerous pieces of Hufflepuff apparel appeared at Sherlock’s shoulder, her eyes wide with admiration. He glanced down at her curiously before turning to John and saying, “Who is this and why is she staring at me?”
Sherlock jumped and spun around, swiping at his ear where Irene Adler’s hot breath had tickled the skin. She was smirking at him, arms crossed and one perfectly plucked eyebrow cocked. Sherlock rolled his eyes and walked away from the bathroom mirror, which he’d been fixing his curls in, trying to make them lay in a somewhat orderly manner. Irene jogged after him as he shoved the bathroom door open and walked out into the corridor beyond.
was more accurate a description—that had his blue-grey eyes trained on John. His face was long and slender, everything about him appearing rather unfriendly.
Soon there was a large group of children surrounding Hagrid, and when it seemed like no more would be joining them the giant led them off. Nervously, John cast one more look over his shoulder, hoping to catch sight of Sherlock one more time, but his friend was nowhere to be seen.
“Precisely, so why waste space remembering it when I can just ask the person nearest to me how it works?” Sherlock replied simply. John looked as though he might argue, but then thought better of it. Instead, he simply shook his head and then went back to working on his homework. Sherlock watched him scribble away at the essay for a few minutes before closing his own textbook and leaning back in his chair, examining the people sitting at the far end of their table. He began to practice deducing things about them, a fun game that he enjoyed playing whenever he became bored. A Ravenclaw girl, most likely a third year, caught his attention first. His eyes brushed over every inch of her in order to obtain important information.
a genius. And people are simple. But people don’t like being shown how simple they are. So they hate me.”
“Your comprehension of the text is abysmal at best and you don’t seem to have the attention span necessary to—”
Outside, it was lightly misting, and the cold droplets soothed John’s burning face. He hadn’t even realized that he’d been flushing. Then again, that was to be expected when one’s secrets were stated as cold, hard fact. But as his embarrassment began to subside ever so slightly, it was replaced by anger. As if it weren’t hard enough for John, being a twenty-three year old in his first year at uni, now there was someone out there who somehow knew some of the most intimate details of his private life. Of course, it was amazing. Fantastic. Brilliant. These words kept running through John’s head, even as the rest of his body decided that the best way to react to this situation was rage. He could feel his blood pressure rising, his ears getting hot, his hands clenching into fists.
“Not remotely. I can tell that she has a form of anxiety since her fingernails are bitten down to the quick. Nail biting is a nervous habit, and to chew them to the point of bleeding (which I can tell they recently have by the flecks of blood on the nails themselves) signals a severe nervous disorder, most likely anxiety of some kind.
After that, John was escorted back to the library by one of the two girls from earlier. She only left him once they were right outside of the door to the library. John was still trying to work out what had just happened as he sat down across from Sherlock, who didn’t even look up from the book he was reading. John almost thought that Sherlock hadn’t noticed his arrival, but then Sherlock said, “Where have you been?”
“Isn’t this great?” John shouted over the roar of the crowd around them. He was waving a small yellow-and-black-striped flag in the air as if his life depended upon it. He’d given a green-and-silver flag to Sherlock to wave, too, but Sherlock had simply stuck it in the pocket of his robes and was now standing stiffly, wincing every time some Hufflepuff accidentally bumped into him.
psychosomatic, so that was another thing his lab partner had gotten wrong—he’d heard Mike calling after him, asking him to wait up. But he couldn’t wait. He’d needed to get out of there as quickly as possible. He needed to escape, to breathe fresh air that didn’t smell like formaldehyde.
“But if you wish to become the best in your year, you can’t spend all of your time helping other people.”
John felt pretty confident that he actually was right, but he decided not to get into it with the professor right now when his future career could be on the line.
Sherlock took his usual seat in the back of the classroom. He liked to sit towards the back for multiple reasons, the first of which being that people didn’t tend to bother those who sat in the last row. Of course, that meant that he was surrounded by the idiots who sat in the back to avoid being called on, but it was a small price to pay. He also liked to sit in the back because it allowed him a better vantage point of his classmates. From here, he could observe them all without their knowledge, thus giving him the perfect chance to practice his deductions. And, finally, it put him as far away as possible from Irene Adler, who had, since the first class they’d shared together the previous year, made a point to challenge Sherlock intellectually whenever the opportunity presented itself. Not that Sherlock would have minded an intellectual debate, if it weren’t for the fact that Adler was, by far, the stupidest Ravenclaw he had ever met.
At that moment, everybody around them began to leave, the teacher having released them early for the day. John’s eyes were locked onto Sherlock’s, though, and time seemed to stand still as Sherlock waited to see what the boy had to say about this. After a moment, John averted his eyes, scooped his books and phone off of the table, snatched up his cane, and before Sherlock could even comprehend what had happened, he was gone.
Finally, Sherlock glanced up from his book and gave John a disapproving look. “Pity, we could have split it. Do think it through next time.”
John was nodding, his smile crinkling up the corners of his eyes even more than it had been before. “I suppose that is fitting.”
Once he’d finished his spiel, Sherlock held his breath and waited. He knew what came next. Insults, or possibly tears. Sometimes the impact of knuckles with his cheek or nose. He hoped that John would at least avoid his eyes. The last time someone had given him a black eye, it had swelled up so badly that he’d been unable to look through a microscope for two weeks.
“How did you figure it all out?” John asked once he had calmed himself, leaning forward in his seat, resting his arms on the table in front of him.
“I never insinuated that you weren’t,” Sherlock replied, though his eyes still closely watched John.
“Yeah. Believe it or not, I don’t actually look for validation in the form of holiday invites by second years. I actually wanted to ask you if you’ve talked to your brother about the whole ‘taking points off for “cheating”’ thing?”
John had put two and two together by now. This was Mycroft. It had to be. The family resemblance was there, and the shiny Head Boy pin attached to his green-lined robes was easy to spot. Knowing the identity of the mystery man made him somewhat less intimidating, and John tried to muster up his courage, thinking of how disappointed his dad would be if he found out that John had been pushed around by someone like this.
“Yeah, actually, he does,” John said irritably. Sure, he was upset with Sherlock, but he wasn’t about to let someone talk bad about him.
Lestrade glanced between Sherlock and John and Anderson and Donovan before saying, “I’ll see you after.”
“We need you to come with us,” the girl blocking his way said, her voice velvety smooth. John’s eyes widened fearfully.
He didn’t know what he’d been expecting, but it certainly hadn’t been an office space made completely of grey marble. As he allowed himself to be drug up to the modernist wooden desk, he stared around the room in amazement. It looked to be a very expensive room belonging to a very important person, with eerie orange lights—electric, John noted—mounted to the walls, along with a set of mirrors across from each other. Overhead, what appeared to be sunlight was filtering through a series of square holes cut into the ceiling, forming a checkerboard pattern of sorts. Behind the desk hung the portrait of some woman, who was regally pacing from one side of the frame to the other, watching John with cool, calculating eyes. And she wasn’t the only one. Sitting at the desk was a boy—though, possibly
They smiled at each other for a moment longer, and then John turned, grabbed his bag and cauldron off of his desk (which still had a large hole melted through it), and walked out the door, casting one last glance over his shoulder at the professor.
“Ghosts are unable to experience any form of physical pleasure,” Adler cut in, having turned completely around in her seat to stare Sherlock down, “except the ability to somewhat taste rotten food. And they are also able to fly and go through walls.”
“Ah!” John shouted out in surprise, pushing away from the mess he’d made and fearfully pulling his wand out of the pocket of his robes, as if he knew what to do to stop the acidic foam from eating away at everything it touched.
It didn’t help that his brother was Head Boy. Most didn’t like Mycroft’s pompous attitude and associated this attitude with Sherlock as well. If only people knew exactly how much Sherlock detested his brother.
Of course, there were a ton of students that had to be sorted first. As the students were called up and their fates were determined, John took the chance to really scan the faces in the crowd. Finally, at the very end of the table full of students with green and silver ties, John recognized the back of Sherlock’s head by the curly black hair. Sherlock was bent over a book, not paying any attention at all to the sorting ceremony going on. That is, until John’s name was called.
,” Mycroft replied, as if the answer was painfully obvious. Then he stood and walked back around to stand behind his desk, opening drawers until he found what he was looking for. He pulled out a small leather pouch and dropped it in front of John, who stared at it dumbly.
It was getting dangerously close to the Christmas holiday, and John still hadn’t heard anything from his parents. If it wasn’t for Harry sending him a letter every other week, he might have started to worry that his family had somehow died while he was away. He still refused to answer any of his sister’s letters, still bitter at her about what had happened the week before he’d left for school, but he had to admit that it was nice to have some link to the outside world. Her letters didn’t soothe his worries about where he’d be spending the holidays, however.
The thing was, Sherlock had never had anal sex before. Well, he’d never had oral sex before, either. Or any sex, unless you considered sex with one’s own hand to be sex. But anal sex was way different from all of those other kinds of sex. It wasn’t that he didn’t want it—because,
“Thank you,” John replied with a smile, although he felt the stirrings of failure within his chest. His father always bragged about how he had been able to turn the matchstick into a needle on his first day of class. John had at least hoped to follow after his father in that regard.
He would never admit it aloud, but Sherlock was actually a little jealous of Molly. He’d known that he wouldn’t be John’s only friend here at Hogwarts—indeed, the boy was far too friendly to only befriend one person in his seven years here—but to Sherlock this seemed to signify the beginning of the end of his and John’s friendship. Soon enough, John would have a group of Hufflepuff friends, possibly with a few Gryffindors and Ravenclaws mixed in, and then he wouldn’t need Sherlock anymore. His new friends would convince him that Sherlock was just dead weight that he was lugging about for no good reason, and eventually John would smarten up and cut his ties. To Sherlock, this seemed inevitable. He had just hoped that it wouldn’t happen so soon.
Sherlock’s grey-blue eyes searched John’s for any trace of insincerity, but all he saw was an honest eagerness to be Sherlock’s friend. And so Sherlock smiled and said, “I’d like that very much.”
“Well, you observed wrong. I’m fine. But thanks for your concern. I’ll see you tomorrow.” And with that, John turned and walked away, hoping he had done so before Sherlock had been able to ‘observe’ the tears glistening in his eyes.
“Right. Good.” The professor nodded curtly, gave Sherlock a small smile, and then turned to the blackboard, where he began to finish up the notes he’d been having Sherlock copy. Sherlock turned and left the room, casting one final glance over his shoulder at the professor before stepping out into the corridor, which now felt like a whole new world.
Sherlock quickly came to realize that having a friend required quite a bit of effort on his part, effort that he was not used to putting forth. Instead of spending hours alone in the library on the weekends, he instead had to endure the company of the first year boy. Though perhaps endure wasn’t the correct word to use here. For any other person it may have been, but John’s company wasn’t something that someone endured. Instead, it simply posed as a distraction to Sherlock. It was a distraction that Sherlock wasn’t sure how he felt about. On one hand, John could go on forever talking about the most mundane things, like the goings-on in the news or his favorite singer. On the other hand, Sherlock finally had someone to talk things through with, a role previously filled by a skull that he kept on his nightstand, much to the distress of the other second year Slytherin boys.
He had about fifteen minutes before his next class, and so he quickly ducked into a narrow, dark corridor that many people were passing without notice as they walked and chatted with each other. John sank to the floor, pulling his knees to his chest and staring dejectedly at the stone wall across from him, tears leaking one by one from the corners of his eyes. He had tried to be okay with his house placement, but at the moment he hated everything about Hufflepuff and about himself.
It had been three weeks since John was sorted into Hufflepuff, and so far his parents hadn’t written him even a single letter. Their silence was louder than all of the howlers in the world, although John knew that it was his father’s doing, not his mother’s. He knew that, if it were up to her, John would have received a letter a day by now. Of course, his time here hadn’t been completely devoid of letters. Harry had somehow gotten her hands on one of the family owls and sent him a letter congratulating him on his sorting and wishing him a successful school year. John had been in the process of crumpling the letter and tossing it in the bin when he was suddenly struck by a wave of emotion and ended up flattening the letter and staring at it for a long time. After some deliberation he decided to bury it at the bottom of his trunk.
It was a well-known fact that Slytherins were particularly hated amongst all of the students attending Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. However, there was one particular Slytherin that was hated particularly more than any others, especially amongst the Slytherins themselves.
As John began to stand up, Sherlock finally shook away his surprise and managed to ask, “Are you doing alright?”
Sherlock stared at John for a moment, head cocked, and then returned his attention to his book as he said, “I don’t quite understand how it was seen as such a shock that you were sorted into Hufflepuff.”
Sherlock’s surprise gave way, becoming indignant as his deductive skills were called into question. “Of course I did!”
Sherlock’s heart leapt to his throat, and though his mind fumbled about for something to say in response to this, nothing came out. This had to be the first and only time that Sherlock Holmes had been made speechless.
“Sherlock!” John shouted without a thought, already limping forward to catch up to the boy. He wasn’t even sure what he wanted to say. He could just leave things as they were. They could work in silence for the rest of the semester, without bothering each other or revealing any more hidden details about each other. But, for some reason, John didn’t want that. He wanted to get to know his lab partner a bit more. He wanted to know
Without a word, Sherlock made his way to the blackboard and picked up a piece of chalk. He looked over what the professor had already written and then got to work copying down the rest. He was about halfway done when he felt a presence behind him, far closer than would normally be considered polite.
“Professor,” Sherlock whispered one more time, eyes closed. He felt the man shift above him, and then their lips were pressed together in one more bruising kiss, ensuring that Sherlock’s lips would be puffy and swollen tomorrow. If he’d had any hope of keeping all of this a secret from Irene, it was gone now.
“Oh, okay,” John said, looking a little put out. After a moment of silence between the two boys, John asked, “So what’s Hogwarts like? My dad told me stories about what it was like back in his day, but of course some things have to have changed, right?”
“It’s alright. But anyway, I don’t actually know if I’m supposed to be sitting here,” John said, casting a nervous glance at all of the glares he was receiving from Sherlock’s fellow Slytherins. “I just wanted to say hi is all.”
Timidly, the first year drug his own trunk into the compartment and then sat down across from Sherlock. The boy’s feet didn’t even touch the floor.
Once the class was over, Sherlock made to get out of the room as quickly as possible, but of course Adler managed to catch up with him before he was even two steps out the door. She always liked to gloat over her self-appointed victory after their debates, even though she didn’t even hold a match to Sherlock’s intellect. He always made a point to ignore her as he walked to his next class, eyes trained straight ahead, refusing to even glance at her light blue eyes.
And with that, Sherlock led John out of the dark corridor and into the better lit main corridor. John was thankful now that he had befriended Sherlock. Perhaps there was a reason that people didn’t like the boy, but he was nice to John, and that was really all that mattered.
John had never felt so violated. All of his problems laid bare by some stranger who couldn’t possibly know the things that he did. It wasn’t as though John went to Mike and told him all about his family troubles, about his dad and Harry. The other things, John could assume that his lab partner had asked around, though he hadn’t the faintest idea why the boy would do that or what he could hope to gain from it. But this was too… personal. Of course, he’d called Harry his brother, when she was in fact his sister, but aside from that everything had been spot-on.
John had never done this with a man before. Then again, he’d hardly even done this with a girl before. That is, unless he counted that one time in fourth year with Mary Morstan, where they’d made out in some secret passage and she’d let him touch her left breast under the shirt but over the bra. So having another man’s knee firmly planted between his thighs was both exhilarating and intimidating. He wasn’t quite sure what he should be doing. Should he thrust? Or grind? He felt pretty positive that he shouldn’t be staying still, which was the course of action he’d been taking up until this point.
“I was looking at her because I was deducing things about her,” Sherlock said, unclear of where the misunderstanding lied.
“Oh! Oh no! Oh I always do that, I can’t seem to stop rambling once I’ve started. One time when I was little…” On she went as John led her out of the Great Hall and managed to find his way to the Transfiguration classroom just before the class started. She only finally stopped talking when the cat sitting upon Professor McGonagall’s desk transformed into the professor herself. Everyone clapped and cheered in astonishment, and then their first lesson began. It was mainly all theory, but toward the end Professor McGonagall passed out matchsticks and taught them the incantation to transfigure it into a sewing needle. John managed to make his matchstick shiny and metallic, but was unable to fully transform it.
All through the feast, John fought back the horrible image of his father’s face when he discovered that his son had been sorted into the most disappointing house at Hogwarts. This just proved that John was just as pathetic as his father had always thought. All of his dreams about impressing his father flew right out the window, and as the night wore on his depression became less and less bearable.
“Professor Holmes, am I doing this right?” a high, flirtatious voice asked from across the room. John looked up to see Janine Hawkins, a Ravenclaw and a fellow seventh year, practically batting her eyelashes at the young potions master. The man, as usual, seemed impervious—and possibly somewhat ignorant—to her advances as he walked over and looked into her simmering cauldron, a single eyebrow arched.
He felt like his knees were about to give out from under him, and Professor Watson seemed to sense this, too, because he pulled his still-erect cock from Sherlock’s ass and helped him to the floor, where Sherlock sat, breath shaky and legs like noodles. He felt a little guilty that the professor hadn’t been able to finish before he’d practically collapsed, but the professor didn’t seem deterred. Instead, he grabbed himself and began pumping at his own erection, never breaking eye contact with Sherlock. In about a minute, the professor looked to be on the edge, and he pushed Sherlock back so that he was laying on the floor. Then, the professor shoved Sherlock’s shirt up and came all over his stomach, the warm, sticky cum dribbling into his belly button.
“Or maybe you’re too interested in acting like a know-it-all,” John shot back, and Sherlock snorted.
“Yeah. Bye.” Sherlock watched as the boy bounded away. His smile slowly faded, but the corners of his mouth remained slightly upturned. It would be nice to have a friend. Last year had been quite lonely, although Sherlock never would have admitted it. In fact, most of Sherlock’s life had been lonely. Making friends had never been something he was good at, and even now he didn’t understand what he had done right in order to make John like him.
John returned his grin before casting one more nervous glance around the table and standing up. “Alright, well I’m going to get ready for my first class. I’ll see you later.”
Last year, he’d avoided each and every game, opting to enjoy the serenity of the library. This year, though, he had a John Watson. And John Watson wouldn’t rest until he managed to drag Sherlock out to the first game of the season, which happened to be Hufflepuff vs. Slytherin. John thought it would be fun to have a bit of friendly competition between them, rooting for opposite teams. And so that was how Sherlock ended up standing amongst a group of Hufflepuff first and second years, watching a game whose rules were dubious at best, wishing that he could instead be studying the effect of adding Asphodel to a shrinking potion or reading his Charms textbook over again.
This seemed to snap the girl out of her trance. “Oh! Sorry! Sorry, I’m Molly. Molly Hooper. John’s friend. We’re in Hufflepuff together—well, I suppose you could tell that from what I’m wearing, and John says that you’re excellent at deducing things about people. I wonder, what can you deduce about me? Actually, I think I’d rather not know, John says that you have a habit of making people cry when you deduce things about them. And I’m a pretty easy crier, though maybe you’ve probably already deduced that about me. I might not be that hard to read, actually. My mum says that she can read me like an open book, and I—”
Now Sherlock sourly glared at Lestrade out of the corner of his eye, unamused by the boy’s teasing. “Are you quite done?”
He had been so distracted by the two girls that he hadn’t been paying attention to how long his concoction had been boiling. The instructions said to only let it boil for three minutes, no more, but he’d forgotten to time it as his head had been whipping back and forth as though he’d been watching a ping-pong match. Because of this, a puff of grey smoke had erupted from the opening of the cauldron, followed by the smell of burnt asparagus and a foamy, acidic substance that immediately began eating its way through the desk the cauldron was sitting on.
He was somewhat disappointed by this turnout. He’d been enthralled, trying to figure out what secrets hid behind this boy’s eyes. Now he would be forced to learn how tedious the boy actually was. Sherlock prepared for the illusion to shatter as he sat down, averting his eyes and flipping open his anatomy book, hoping that his face clearly showed that he would not be entertaining any of this boy’s foolish attempts at partner bonding.
Professor Holmes was by his side in a flash, wand at the ready, and in a matter of moments the foam was gone, the smoke had cleared, and everything was back to normal—aside from the lingering scent of burnt asparagus and the hole in the desk. Everyone was staring at John with wide eyes, the catfight all but forgotten, and John felt his face flush red in embarrassment. Of course this would happen to him. That just seemed to be how this year was going. If he kept this up, there was no way he’d be accepted into St. Mungo’s apprentice program once he graduated (
John watched as Professor Holmes paced around the dungeon slowly, his hands clasped behind his back, long black robe flowing. His mop of curly brown hair hung down over his thick brown eyebrows, which were, in turn, furrowed over his ever-changing eyes. Just as John was about to shout at the man to stop torturing him and just get on with it, the man turned startlingly fast and marched over to stand in front of where John sat. John stared up at the professor with wide, blue eyes, leaning back a bit on his stool so that he wasn’t craning his neck to look meet the professor’s gaze. Well, he would have met the professor’s gaze, if his gaze had stood still. Instead, it flickered all over the place at lightning speed, from John’s right shoulder to his tie to his pants to his shoes back up to his hand that was clutching his wand and then finally lingering on his lips for a fraction of a second longer than everywhere else before coming up to meet his eyes.
“Greg Lestrade. We’ve met before,” the boy reminded Sherlock. Sherlock indeed remembered their initial introduction, which included a stray bludger to the gut on one of Sherlock’s evening walks. Lestrade was a beater for the Gryffindor Quidditch team, and had apologized profusely for what had happened, much to Sherlock’s surprise. So Lestrade had stood apart from the other Gryffindors in Sherlock’s mind, although he could have sworn that the boy’s name had been Gavin…
He eventually found himself walking the perimeter of the Quidditch pitch, watching as a few people flew about in the air, tossing a quaffle around between them. Tryouts had happened last week, and John had completely forgotten about them, not that it mattered much since he was a first year and it was against the rules for a first year to play Quidditch. He wished that he could have tried out, though. Becoming a seeker just like his dad would be the perfect way to prove that he really was a Watson. That even though he wasn’t Gryffindor, he was still worth something.
“Will it be starting soon?” Sherlock asked impatiently, eyeing the teams' locker rooms. “I have other things that require my attention today.”
There it was. The one thing John had known would happen since that blasted sorting hat had shouted the word ‘Hufflepuff.’ ‘Oh, I never expected Reginald Watson’s boy to be in Hufflepuff.’ He’d pictured how many people would say it to him, all of the different emotions they would have while they said it—from shock to pity—and worst of all, he’d pictured his father’s embarrassment when these things were said in front of him.
“My parents thought it was all some huge joke when the professor delivered it. He had to turn our dog into a footstool and back before they believed him, and then they were so terrified they threatened to call the police. Of course, I was so excited, and I talked them into letting me go, and so the professor came back another day and we all went shopping for my things in Diagon Alley. It was amazing, with all of its magical shops and everything; well, of course you know how amazing it is, you’ve probably been there with your parents all your life. What’s it like to grow up with magic? It must have been wonderful…”
The rest of the pop quiz went in the same manner, and afterwards the professor brought out a ghoul from his office to show everyone. The muggle-borns and a few of the half-and-pure blood students who had never seen a ghoul ‘ooh’ed and ‘ahh’ed over it, but Sherlock was unimpressed. His family had a ghoul of their own, which Sherlock had named Redbeard back when he had wished to become a pirate. He’d even insisted to Mycroft that Redbeard would be his first mate. Foolish, Sherlock knew now. Simple childhood fantasies and misconceptions.
Behind him, Sherlock heard the professor mutter something that sounded like a spell, and then, without warning, one of the man’s fingers slid into his asshole, slicked up with some sort of lubricant. He gasped loudly as the man expertly found and stroked his prostate. Sherlock found himself white-knuckling the edges of the desk, his cheek flat against the cool wooden surface, eyes squeezed shut with pleasure and the slightest bit of pain.
The room grew quiet, and everybody looked to the hat expectantly. When it opened its mouth and began to sing, it took everything in John to keep from shouting out in surprise and fright. Indeed, a few first years around him jumped and let out a little embarrassed giggle.
Molly held her hand out for Sherlock to shake. “I’m excited to finally meet you in person. I’ve heard so much about you, and I’ve seen you around the school, but—”
The smile returned, and Sherlock’s knees felt weak. “In that case, can you transfer these notes over to the blackboard while I work on tomorrow’s lesson plan?” The man held up a piece of parchment, and Sherlock stepped forward and grabbed it, his long, slender fingers barely brushing against the professor’s stouter ones. A jolt ran up Sherlock’s arm at the contact.
“That’s sad. It must be very lonely, not having any friends,” Molly said, and John nodded in agreement.
“OI! HEADS UP!” a voice shouted at John, but it was too late, for a quaffle had found its way to John and hit him squarely in the temple, effectively knocking him to the ground. Two people landed ungracefully next to him, leaping off of their brooms and hurrying to his side. “Are you alright?”
“I’m hardly a know-it-all simply because of my advanced vocabulary and problem solving skills, at least not in the derogatory connotation of the phrase.”
“Well, Mr. Holmes, I’m afraid that it appears we didn’t really do this detention thing right.” The professor slowly walked over to stand in front of Sherlock, grinning at him. “I suppose we’ll have to try again next Saturday.”
John snickered beside Sherlock, and the corner of Sherlock’s mouth twitched upward, pleased that he’d been able to make John laugh. Even Lestrade was fighting back a smile at the affronted look on Anderson’s face.
“Your wanting to become a doctor is obvious, between your taking an anatomy class, particularly personable demeanor, and frankly conservative clothing choices. Also, you were using your class schedule as a bookmark, and I noticed a few more biology-centric classes on your list, consistent with a pre-med degree. Of course, you could be considering going into some form of veterinary science, but there isn’t a single strand of animal fur on your pants or jumper, which most animal lovers are commonly found with. Thus, human doctor. General medicine most likely.
The smile dropped from John’s face, and he blinked twice in shock. Sherlock wondered if perhaps that was not the correct question to ask, but he figured there was no turning back now.
And then the professor was slowly sliding into him, and though there was the burning sensation of being stretched a little too wide, there was also the pleasurable sensation of being filled to the brim with Professor John H. Watson, the man he’d fantasized about day and night for over a year now. This was a dream come true. No, it was better than a dream come true. None of Sherlock’s fantasies had done the professor justice.
“No.” John’s voice was sharp, and Sherlock’s eyebrows raised in surprise. John didn’t care, however. Right now he just needed to get away from Sherlock and everyone else in this bloody school. Irritably, he flung his bag over his shoulder and then stormed out of the library.
And with that, they’d each grabbed him by an arm and led him up to the seventh floor, to a corridor whose one wall was taken up almost completely by a tapestry adorned with the image of some man attempting to teach trolls how to perform ballet. One of the girls began to pace back and forth, leaving the other to hold tightly to John’s bicep, as if he would dare try to escape. John hoped that Sherlock would recognize his absence soon enough, and would come looking for him. Of course, he knew the chances of that were slim. Although he knew that Sherlock enjoyed his company, he also knew that the boy had a habit of talking to him even when he wasn’t around.
As he was about to exit the room, hand hovering right above the doorknob, the professor shouted after him, “Oh, Sherlock!”
He felt like he needed to supply a new topic of conversation to keep them talking—though he didn’t understand why he wanted that—so he said, “Afghanistan or Iraq?”
Sherlock was about to say that yes, he did indeed mind that this small creature wished to disturb him and his peaceful solitude, but something about the boy’s brown eyes stopped him, and instead he found himself saying, “Not at all. Sit down.”
He then pressed a much gentler kiss to John’s lips, softer than any of the others they’d shared in the past half hour. When he pulled away, he stared into John’s eyes for a moment before sighing and stepping back.
“I’m pleased to have made your acquaintance, Mr. Watson,” Mycroft said after a moment. “It was interesting to witness the depth of your loyalty to my brother. A true Hufflepuff, though and through, I suppose.” John’s stomach sunk at these words.
“I…” He hesitated, but John’s eager face urged him on. “I also know that you want to be a doctor, and that the only reason you joined the army was to impress your father, attempting to placate him after your alcoholic brother disgraced your family.”
“Well, he’s nice enough to me. But he doesn’t seem very well liked. He told me that he doesn’t have any friends,” John explained.
“I’d always hoped that his children would be in Gryffindor—I’m the head of Gryffindor house, you know. I’m actually a bit surprised that you’re in Hufflepuff, but of course Hufflepuff is an honorable house.”
John sat on his stool miserably for the rest of the class period as his peers finished up their potions—they were meant to be making a Drought of Living Death. He watched as the professor went around to each cauldron and gave them a grade for their concoctions, and he felt like doing himself in with the killing curse right then and there. Then he waited as all of his classmates filed out of the room, glancing back over their shoulders as they left, giving John sympathetic looks. Only Irene didn’t seem to pity him. Instead, she gave him an oddly suggestive smirk as she left, closing the door behind her, as she was the last one out.
This actually made John crack a smile, and the professor mirrored it. They watched each other carefully for a few moments, and John felt heat slowly gathering in the pit of his stomach. Finally, he nodded.
“Well then, hurry it up, because—guhhh….” His smart-arse remark was cut off by the professor suddenly mouthing John’s cock through his pants, and John barely managed to remain standing, clutching at the edge of the desk behind him. “P… Professor…”
“Your brother’s drinking habits could be found on your mobile phone, which you laid face down on the table when you sat. On the back there is an inscription, reading ‘To Harry Watson, Love Clara.’ Obviously, your name is not Harry, so the phone did not originally belong to you. Most likely passed down from a family member, but not your father because the phone is a newer model and, frankly, why would your father give you a brand new phone that would have had to have been given to him from his wife? So then the next most likely candidate is a brother, obviously recently split from his wife, who gifted him with the phone. The fact that they were married is made clear by the expense of the gift. He clearly broke up with her, since he felt the need to get rid of it. If she’d broken up with him he most likely would have kept the phone for sentiment’s sake, but in this case he wanted to simply forget that the relationship had ever happened. The split most likely occurred because of his alcoholism.”
“Right, yes,” John said, grabbing Molly’s arm, causing her rambling to cut off mid-sentence. “Molly, this is Sherlock. Sherlock, this is Molly.”
The professor studied him for a moment, and then smiled, walking around the front of his desk and catching John’s face between his hands once more. “We’ll just use
“I know it is.” Sherlock didn’t dare to believe that this was happening. He knew that his eyes must be bugging out of his head in disbelief, and he hoped that he didn’t look too much like a deer in the headlights.
“Alright, everybody, let’s settle down now,” the professor said, projecting his voice over the clamor of students chatting away amongst themselves. The students who had been standing, like the blond boy, moved to find a seat at a lab table, but the professor said, “Might as well wait, if you’re not already seated. I’ve assigned you all lab partners, whom you’ll be working with from now on.”
“Well… No… I mean, that’s not what I…” John really didn’t like what the professor was implying. Did he really think that John was shallow enough to only have been distracted because the two having a row were women? “It had nothing to do with—”
Molly looked a bit hurt by this, and John gave Sherlock a scolding look. “Because I’ve been wanting to introduce you in person but just haven’t had the chance.”
This seemed like a poor excuse to Sherlock, but he didn’t push the issue. Just then, the players began filing onto the field, all of them whooping and waving at the stands, soaking in the attention that the whole school was giving them at that moment. Dejected, Sherlock settled in for a few hours of torture.
Sherlock began to grow somewhat antsy as the professor neglected to call his name. He began counting out the remaining students, hoping that he might end up by himself after all, but was disappointed to find that there was an even number of students. Finally, after another minute of names being called, Sherlock was the only one left. Well, him and—
“Yes, well, that’s because you’re an idiot,” Sherlock said, and then glanced up to see John scowling at him. He added, “Oh, don’t give me that look. Practically everyone is.”
Lestrade sighed, scratching the back of his neck as he thought about this. “I just… This is OWL year for me, you know? I’ve got to be able to study with people if I want a chance in hell to pass my tests.”
“It’s not funny. It’s scary. Just you wait, there’s a reason Sherlock Holmes was sorted into Slytherin. That’s the house that practically breeds dark wizards, and if he isn’t one in the making I’ll eat my broom.”
John simply stared at Sherlock, who shifted uncomfortably. He shouldn’t have done that. The last time he’d deduced someone to their face they had ended up putting the body bind on him and leaving him in a hidden corridor overnight. Of course, he didn’t believe that John was capable of that—in fact, the odds of John even knowing how to perform the body bind curse were slim—but this was probably a good way to lose his one and only friend.
The professor shrugged, quirking his mouth into an incredibly sexy crooked grin. “I’ve fantasized about this moment. A lot.”
“What are you doing?” Sherlock asked, glancing around as if expecting someone to wrestle the Hufflepuff boy from the Slytherin table. Indeed, a few Slytherins appeared to be disgruntled by the fact that someone with a yellow tie was sullying their sea of green.
Sherlock froze, causing two Slytherin fourth years walking behind him to collide with his back. They shoved past him, muttering angrily under their breath, but Sherlock couldn’t care less. He simply stared at Adler, who was smirking at him, arms crossed in self-satisfaction.
he can be at times. This is simply reassurance that you won’t be deterred by him or his rather unsavory attitude.”
“To be frank, Mr. Watson, I only let you into this class because Geoffrey was quite insistent that you would be an asset, but so far I’ve found you to be subpar at your most impressive.”
“Isn’t it?” Sherlock made sure to make his displeasure in the conversation continuing perfectly clear to the Gryffindor boy.
“Ah, so you want to be in Gryffindor, hmm? Well, let’s see here… You certainly do have the potential to be an excellent Gryffindor… But—” John’s heart sank “—you would do so much better in HUFFLEPUFF!”
“Oh, no, I’m perfectly content to stay right here.” The professor slid one hand onto the back of Sherlock’s neck and pulled him down for one final, sweet kiss. When they broke apart, he said, “I’ll see you in class, Sherlock.”
“What do you need me to do?” Sherlock asked, deciding that he had been staring at Professor Watson’s smile for far longer than was socially acceptable.
“Excuse me? Did the Whore of Babylon just tell me to ‘keep it in my pants’?” Janine had stood up and was glaring at Irene, who wasn’t even bothering to glower back. Instead, she remained focused on her own potion, which, John noted, looked almost as good as Janine’s.
“My name’s John. John Watson,” the boy introduced, offering his hand for Sherlock to shake. Hesitantly, Sherlock took it.
“Yes, I know what a girlfriend is,” John snapped irritably. “I just don’t understand what that has to do with anything.”
Sherlock stopped his copying and looked to the professor, whose eyes were studying him from head to foot. It felt like his gaze was searing Sherlock’s flesh, and a pleasurable shiver ran up Sherlock’s spine.
Sherlock pushed away the urge to smile. Although he was sure that, at any moment, this boy would prove himself to be just as trite and dull as any other university student, in this instant he was actually quite charming. Sherlock wasn’t used to being charmed, and he decided that he didn’t like it one bit.
Sherlock seemed to hesitate before entering the corridor and standing over John, appearing not quite sure what to do in this situation. John felt his face flush with embarrassment at being caught crying, and he quickly cleared his throat before scrambling to his feet. Sherlock watched him do so with an unreadable expression, and John felt more than uncomfortable under the older boy’s gaze.
Suddenly, the professor pulled away, and Sherlock’s eyes flew open in shock. For a second, he feared that the professor had changed his mind, but the man had simply reached over to grab a chair.
“Not likely. I’ve seen the way the professor looks at you. You may be hot for teacher, but teacher is even hotter for you.”
The speaker was an older Gryffindor boy, and he offered his hand out to the incredibly dazed John. After a moment, John accepted the boy’s outstretched hand, and he was pulled to his feet easily. John then made sure that he was steady before saying, “Yeah, I’m fine.”
He looked down and was met with the top of a head of curly hair. The professor’s fingers were making quick work of John’s belt, buttons, and zipper. In a matter of seconds, the man was peeling John’s trousers down, leaving him to stand in his red boxer-briefs, erection straining against the thin material. The professor glanced up at him and cocked a playful eyebrow.
“So, I think that we should plan our tutoring sessions for Saturdays at ten in the morning, if that works with you,” the professor said briskly, not meeting John’s eye.
When the train arrived at the Hogsmead station, John’s fear made a reappearance. He nervously straightened his robes as Sherlock led him off the train and onto the platform.
“Sir, about the class. Please, I need it, and I need to pass it. I swear that I take this seriously, but potions just doesn’t come to me as naturally as some of my other classes. I’ve been trying to find a tutor, but nobody has the time. They’ve all got their own NEWTs to worry about, and—”
John decided that it wasn’t worth it to argue any further. So, instead, he asked, “When’s your next class?”
The professor glanced up, cocking his head to the side. “Oh, no, Mr. Watson. Your potion skills are still wretched. We’ll need to do some actual tutoring if you hope to stay in my class.”
The next day as Sherlock was making his way down to the Great Hall for breakfast, he was intercepted by a fourth year Gryffindor whose name escaped Sherlock completely. The boy had untidy brown hair and stern brown eyes, and his grip on Sherlock’s arm was firm. Sherlock immediately considered hexing the boy, but then decided against it when it appeared that the action of grabbing Sherlock’s arm was not meant to be malicious.
Sherlock’s heart fluttered, and he nodded before slowly backing away and hurrying toward the door. He vaguely wondered what he would tell Irene. Would he share everything with her? He knew that she would want him to, but the thought didn’t really appeal to him. However, he knew that he wouldn’t be able to keep it a secret from her. She liked to say that people had a “glow” after they’d had sex, and doubtlessly she’d see this “glow” on him from a mile away. After everything that had happened today, he suspected that he looked a bit like a supernova. So, he decided to give her the bare minimum, and keep all of the specifics to himself.
When they rounded a corner and John got his first view of Hogwarts, his breath was taken away and his heart sped up its pace. He’d been waiting his whole life to come to this school, and now it was finally happening. With a grin, he picked up his pace a little in an attempt to reach the boats faster. These boats would be carrying him and the other first years to the castle. He ended up sharing a boat with a mousy-haired girl who introduced herself to be Molly Hooper and two other boys.
Sherlock tensed. Perhaps he had been wrong in believing that the boy’s grip had no malicious intent. After all, whenever anybody stopped Sherlock to talk about his brother, it usually ended up in Sherlock being punched or hexed in some way.
“I do. Gryffindor is scarlet. My pants are candy apple red.” John had meant this to sound sarcastic and flirtatious, but in the end, with his voice all breathy, it just sounded a bit stupid.
Sherlock liked to believe that he was an unfeeling machine. Capable of ignoring any and all human emotions in favor of completely dedicating himself to both academia and scientific research. He’d told countless people on countless occasions that he considered himself married to his work. His brother, Mycroft, tended to agree with the notion that caring was not an advantage. That sentiment was for the weak. Sherlock hated being in agreement with his brother on anything, but in this case it seemed like they were completely, and rather unfortunately, on the same page.
“As for the rest, her robes are clearly covered in the fur of a calico cat. I can assume it’s only one cat since that is all she is allowed to own here, and I can assume that it’s hers because of the few bits of white fur that I can see tangled in her hair, which leads me to believe that she has slept in the same bed with the cat, which would only usually happen if the cat belonged to her. Of course I could be incorrect.
Lestrade paused, as if waiting for Sherlock to continue, and then asked again, “So are you Mycroft’s brother?”
When he’d rushed from the lab, as fast as his limp would allow him to go—and, might he add, the limp
“So are you going to try out for your house’s Quidditch team this year?” Lestrade asked, falling into step beside Sherlock as he walked down the stairs into the Entrance Hall.
“You wouldn’t happen to be the son of Reginald Watson, would you?” Professor McGonagall asked, and John nodded excitedly. “I remember him well. Very bright young boy, top of his class. He was a bit arrogant sometimes, and had a knack for getting into trouble, but all in all he was a good student. Married Valerie Turner if I’m not mistaken?”
“But just the other day you asked me if the sun revolved around the Earth!” John exclaimed, clearly believing this to be proof that Sherlock’s mind palace did not exist.
Sherlock stopped abruptly, causing John to stumble. He quickly righted himself and cleared his throat, looking his lab partner over. Sherlock was still avoiding eye contact with him, opting to stare instead at his loafers. The boy was posh, there was no denying that. Everything he wore was clearly designer, from the black slacks to the purple, silky button-up that fit him so well John assumed that it must have been custom-made. It made John feel a bit frumpy, dressed in his own plaid button-down and wool jumper.
The Slytherins all groaned while the Ravenclaws sat up straighter, their faces smug. Sherlock sneered as Adler glanced back at him, eyebrows raised. Professor Lupin’s pop quizzes were notorious for becoming a battleground for the two of them.
Once the professor was satisfied that Sherlock would be able to take him without much issue, his three fingers slid out of Sherlock’s arse and his dick was lined up with the hole. Sherlock sucked in a deep breath, holding it and trying his best to keep himself as loose and relaxed as possible…
“That is, decidedly, not my problem.” And with that, Sherlock swept away into the classroom, leaving a frustrated Lestrade standing dumbly in the hallway.
“Don’t worry,” Molly stage whispered to him over the cheers of the crowd. “I don’t like Quidditch either. You and I can be confused together.”
John had always suspected that they weren’t far apart in age, but that didn’t change the taboo of what the man was implying.
Sherlock snorted. “I’m not uneducated. I was reading books on sexual orientation and reproduction when I was seven years old. The concept is not difficult to grasp, although I am unsure why—”
Sherlock was finally able to find his voice, and he whispered. “Girlfriend? No. Not really my area.”
Mycroft’s eyes drifted from John’s forehead to his toes, and John got the uncomfortable feeling that he was deducing everything about him like Sherlock had that day in the library. It was significantly less pleasant when Mycroft did it, though.
“Of course I don’t know the answer yet. That is the point of homework if I’m not mistaken. Talking things through is how I’m able to work things out. Things become clearer outside of my mind palace.”
“Hey,” Greg said in a moment of sudden realization. “You’re that kid that hangs out with Sherlock Holmes, aren’t you?”
“Yes, very good, if you were looking for the most basic definitions of the creatures and not an actual explanation of their origins, histories, or even their characteristics.”
Sherlock shrugged. “For instance, she has some form of anxiety. She has a pet cat here at school with her, she is left handed, she recently had her hair cut, and she hasn’t done her laundry in over a week. Those are all of the things I have noticed so far.”
“Ghosts are sentient beings whose souls remained on the earth after their death either because they feared death—a sentiment I don’t quite understand—or else because they had a strong connection to the location that they haunt. Ghouls are also sentient, but they are living creatures as opposed to apparitions, and they tend to make a frankly obscene amount of noise. They are somewhat dimwitted, and live off of bugs and other household pests, while ghosts do not need sustenance at all. Ghosts—”
John thought about this for a moment. Maybe Sherlock was right. Just because the sorting hat thought that John belonged in Hufflepuff, that didn’t mean that he wouldn’t be able to make his father proud. He would just have to work harder to show his father that he could be just as much of a Gryffindor as he was a Hufflepuff. This brought a small smile to John’s lips.
After they broke apart, the professor quickly tucked himself back in and straightened himself up, ruffling his hair with his hands, causing it to fall back into its usual orderly chaos. It took John a bit longer to pick himself up and put himself together. When he finally managed it, the professor was already hurrying about, tidying up the room and reorganizing the papers on his desk. John slowly walked to the front of the classroom, his legs a bit shaky but otherwise keeping it together.
“John, are you all right?” Sherlock asked as John turned to face him. John shrugged, trying to play off his disappointment as coolly as possible, not wanting Sherlock to see how truly upset he was. After all, the older boy was so collected all the time, and John didn’t want to seem weak to him.
“Well, I guessed that you were from England based solely on your accent. You speak with a Received Pronunciation accent, which of course is not entirely indicative of you being from England, but it is a good place to start since it has a negligible presence in Scotland and Northern Ireland and is arguably losing its prestige status in Wales. The fact that you speak with a RP accent also aided me in predicting your status of wealth, as well as your tan. It was a particularly rainy summer throughout the United Kingdom, especially these past few weeks, so one would assume that you traveled somewhere sunny and warm shortly before starting school. The ability to travel and then also purchase all of your school supplies new suggests some form of wealth, or at least that your family is financially well-off.
it. “But for the past year now I’ve seen you once a week every week, and it’s starting to get very hard to… Well, I suppose I’d like to know if I’m wrong in thinking that you feel the same?”
“It’s funny. My dear brother seems to have taken a liking to you.” The man stood up now, and he absolutely towered over John’s eleven-year-old self. John couldn’t keep himself from taking a hesitant step back. “The thing is, in his twelve years on this earth, I’ve never seen him even try to make friends with someone. I watched as mummy arranged playdate after playdate with other children throughout his early childhood, and none stuck. So what is it about you that caught and held his attention?”
There were four long tables, with tons of students sitting at them, all watching the first years enter. John felt his face growing hot, and was sure that blush was slowly creeping across his cheeks. His eyes skimmed over the faces watching him, but he couldn’t find Sherlock’s face anywhere. Feeling nauseous, he focused his eyes straight ahead at a stool and hat that Professor McGonagall was setting out, wondering what on earth it was for.
A stern looking woman came into the room after a couple of minutes and introduced herself as Professor McGonagall. She gave a short speech about how houses at Hogwarts were like families, and explained about the point system. Then, finally, she led them into the Great Hall.
His silence apparently seemed to frighten the professor, who quickly said, “Or, well, of course, we don’t have to. I don’t want you to feel that I’m pressuring you into anything.”
“Alright, fine. But you’ve got to tell me everything when you get back to the common room.” Irene wiggled her eyebrows suggestively. She had always been like this, even back when they were first years. While it had taken Sherlock a little longer than average—and a hot ex-Auror turned Defense Against the Dark Arts professor—to understand the concept of sexuality, Irene had been an early bloomer. Even then, they had somehow been drawn together from the start. Best friends since day one—not that Irene had given Sherlock much say in the matter.
Now Sherlock looked up, if only so that John could see him roll his eyes. “No, I didn’t look in your phone. I didn’t have to. It was all in plain sight.”
“I don’t mean to be inappropriate…” the professor said, but his eyes were already undressing Sherlock, and Sherlock
“Alright, alright,” Lestrade said, cutting Sherlock off. His cheeks were flushed and he looked desperate to be anywhere else. “I’ll see you later.”
John laughed again. “Alright, well, luckily for you, I know all of the good takeaway places around here. What do you say about Indian?”
“I suppose, though, that I cannot imagine myself in any other house,” Sherlock admitted after a moment. John looked up at him, eyes wide.
“I told you before, I don’t talk to my brother, and even if I did, I wouldn’t be able to change his mind.”
“I find you intoxicating, Mr. Watson.” The professor hadn’t moved from the spot he’d been planted in since the beginning of their… ‘conversation’ didn’t seem to be the right word for it… but somehow it felt like he was closer to John than ever before. The air was becoming thick and the whole world felt as though it had shrunk down into that small dungeon.
“I, uh…” The man licked his lips nervously and cast his eyes to the blackboard, as if he was afraid to look at Sherlock now. “I don’t suppose you’d be interested in doing that again, would you?”
“It’s fine. No need to be sorry.” The professor gave him a kind smile, the one that always made Sherlock melt. The man was head of Gryffindor house, which was known to be Slytherin’s fiercest competition when it came to the house cup. And yet he was always so nice to Sherlock, even today, when Sherlock was meant to be being punished.
Sherlock couldn’t keep his eyes from taking in every minute detail about the boy. He was approximately five-foot-six, weighing about 150 pounds. His hair was short, as though it had been buzzed at one point—most likely during his stint in the army—but was now in the process of growing out. He was solidly built, not quite stocky but far from slim like Sherlock. His left hand had a slight tremor, which he was currently trying to discretely stretch out as he smiled and chatted with a slightly obese boy who was gesticulating wildly. His smile seemed sincere enough, but his eyes… There was something more in those blue eyes. Sherlock cocked his head. Normally he would assume some form of PTSD. He’d seen plenty of soldiers who had come back haunted from the war. But, somehow, Sherlock felt that that wasn’t quite what he was seeing in this boy’s eyes.
“Alright, everyone,” Professor Lupin announced, striding into the room, a small smile on his lips. “We’re starting today’s class with a pop quiz.”
Each lick, suck, and kiss was making Sherlock come undone rather quickly. He had one hand wrapped in the professor’s hair now and the other yanking at his own in pure ecstasy. His breathing was heavy and hitched every once in a while when a particularly well placed lick sent jolts of electricity through his groin and up his torso.
The professor trailed his fingers under John’s layers of shirts and up his torso before slowly sliding back down. “Sherlock. Call me Sherlock. Please.”
The man had John’s face between his hands in a matter of seconds, and John jumped to his feet, the stool that he’d been sitting on clattering backwards onto the stone floor. As the professor’s thin lips met John’s soft ones, he had the fleeting thought,
The professor walked around to stand beside the blackboard, so that he could look Sherlock in the face as he asked, “What’s your story?”
He had a hard time believing that this was the man’s first time doing something like this, because it felt too damn good to be the work of a rookie. Sherlock’s head bobbed back and forth with ease while his tongue teased the head of John’s cock with precision. In a matter of minutes, John had essentially lost all control of himself and was moaning and whimpering with each suck and lick. Finally, he couldn’t keep himself from it anymore, and he saw a flash of white as he came in Sherlock’s mouth, crying out “Sherlock!” as he did so. As he came down from the high of the climax, his legs gave out from under him, and he slowly lowered himself to the floor so that he and Sherlock were face-to-face. Sherlock appeared absolutely disheveled, with his curls a frizzy mess and his cheeks flushed and eyes alight. It was absolutely arousing. John watched hungrily as Sherlock wiped the remnants of saliva and ejaculate from the corners of his mouth.
He immediately feels better. His breathing is calmer now and he is able to focus again. A creaking from the floorboards startles him. He can’t face John. Not now, not... ever again. But to his immense relief he realizes that it is Mrs. Hudson’s steps that provoked the sound, not John’s.
When they’re both more moaning than breathing, Sherlock withdraws a bit, looking John in the eye. "What about sex now?", he asks dead serious. John laughs. "Sure, if you want to rush things." – "I’m impatient by nature. Of course I want to rush things", the detective states breathlessly. John smirks in silent agreement.
Sherlock glances at his phone. His fingers are still gripping at the device, knuckles white, when it chimes with another text from Mycroft.
"What about number five?" – "Number five?" – "The one you fell for after army-guy." – "Oh, he’s a pretty daft git." The detective seems irritated, before he catches up. "You already counted me, then." – "Obviously", John agrees, amused.
Sherlock snaps out of his Mind Palace. Why would Mind Palace John have secrets before him? Since he is created by his own mind, that doesn’t make any sense. Even more interesting, why would he blush and have dilated pupils? "He’s right", Sherlock groans. "I’m having a crush on him." He scrubs his forehead. Bit not good, that. "John..." When the image of John’s flushed face flickers back behind his eyes he shrugs, lies down again and closes his lids once more.
When he stands in front of the sink, washing his hands, he shoots himself a quick glance in the mirror. He stops, fascinated by what he feels when he looks at his mirror self. The Sherlock in the mirror seems very much at ease, relaxed, peaceful. Warmth washes through him and he smiles at himself, open and sincere. "You deserve to finally be happy", he tells himself before he slowly leaves to return to bed. To John.
", John points out, which provokes an eye roll from his flatmate, that is nearly audible. "So you think I’m intersting?", the doctor asks with a wide grin. "We already had that, John." – "What about The Woman?
The detective huffs, then snorts and finally flings himself into a lying position, staring at the ceiling. As if his brother knew anything about self love. Or love in general. Maybe the internet does.
When the front door bangs shut downstairs, Sherlock lets out a frustrated cry. "Why are you so unhelpful, John?" He vigorously shuffles his mess of hair and jumps to his feet. He spins, dressing gown swaying around his legs. He takes the few steps to the couch and throws himself onto it. After a moment of angry ceiling staring, he decidedly closes his eyes again.
"Tell me about the people you fell in love with." – "I’ve never fallen in love before." John gives his head a jerk. "How can that be?" – "People bore me, John. How am I supposed to fall in love with something boring?" – "Someone." – "What?" – "You’re talking about humans, therefore it’s
never bored you." Sherlock waves it away. "We had sex, but I wasn’t in love with her... Or was I?", he trails off, brow furrowed. John chuckles.
Back in real life, Sherlock doesn’t know what to think or do, so he just stays in bed and listens to John’s distant rummaging in their kitchen.
dull." John laughs, again. "Well, I’m done with it." Sherlock musters his face. No mocking, slight amusement and a faint hint of ... sadness?
John turns his head, smiling at him. "Hey", he mutters, greeting his flatmate. "You planning to take one of your dates to the kitchen?" The question sounds morose, which makes Sherlock flinch slightly. John shoots him one of these curious glances that have become more and more frequent in the past few weeks. An intense discomfort spreads in the detective. He stiffens, waiting for an answer. John averts his gaze and sighs. "No", is all he says, in a strangely contented manner, while he resumes cleaning. Sherlock frowns. "Then why the jumper?" This time, he manages his usual disinterested voice. The doctor stops again, looking at the cloth in his hand. His expression confused, he returns to scrubbing. "What do you mean?"
John takes a deep breath, shoots an unsure glance towards his friend. "Fine. I’m... pretty easily attracted to women", he starts, looking up at Sherlock again, who is having a hard time not to roll his eyes on the statement. Even John can see that and he smiles. "But when it comes to falling in love it is more often blokes than women." – "Which rate?", Sherlock asks, with scientific interest. "Three out of f-" John’s brow furrows. "Four out of five." – "Tell me about them." –  "About the blokes?" – "About the people you fell in love with." – "Hmmm..." John seems to be miles away, remembering each of them and sorting out where to start. "Chronologically, please", Sherlock demands, which makes John laugh.
, John thinks, being glad not to meet his friend’s gaze, because that also, he finds totally endearing.
Sherlock frowns at the screen. Tilts his head, jerks it back. Torn between telling the bastard to piss off and wanting to know whatever that cryptic message means, he stares at the small device lying innocently on his palm. The distraction has broken him free from the long fingers of embarrassment, that kept him in a vice grip. His own fingers move swiftly over the display.
"There a reason why you asked about sex first?" Sherlock blushes, which gives John a very hard time to not show how endearing he finds it. Better not to press the sentiment issue either. "I quite enjoy it with Mind Palace John though there might be a difference between the actual experience and the Mind Palace ones." John’s turn to blush. "Are you saying that this... trouser-tent of yours that started to appear several months ago whenever you‘re visiting your Mind Palace is because you are having sex with... Mind Palace me?" A half-smirk appears on Sherlock’s face. "It seems Mind Palace you is insatiable." – "I don’t even want to know what made you come to that conclusion." John swallows hard and thinks:
Sherlock wakes abruptly on the couch in 221B Baker Street. He lifts himself up into a sitting position, ruffling his hair, feeling confused. He rubs over his face. He feels soft and relaxed. What happened in his Mind Palace today is unprecedented. He thinks of returning to bed, to John. The tightness the embarrassment caused this morning doesn’t return. Sherlock huffs. Odd. He waits for several minutes sitting on the couch, immobile. Nothing changes. He stands gracefully and turns to the door of the loo.
John brakes the kiss and nestles his cheek against Sherlock’s. "I would be a rubbish friend, if I left you for being in love with me", he whispers, caressing Sherlock’s back. Sherlock wraps his arms around John, pressing him against his chest. He hides his face in his neck and inhales deeply. "You smell fantastic", he breathes and gets lost in the sensation of John.
"Alright... First, there was Adam. I met him at the boy scouts and we soon became inseparable. Unfortunately, his father was working for an international company and eventually got transferred to the US department in Chicago. It had been the worst news I felt I was ever going to get in my life and I hadn’t even realized I was in love with him, then." John pauses, pondering the memory. "When did you get it?" – "When he kissed me at his parents‘ goodbye party. It was in his room, the party noises shut out by the closed door." – "How old were you?" – "I was thirteen, he was twelve." John smiles. "God, that’s been ages ago." – "Hmmm."
"The next time I fell in love was with a girl named Joleen. We were fifteen and met when I was in  class camp." Sherlock watches him raptly, when he glances his way. "You were together for quite a while... first sexual experiences... lost your virginity to each other. Oh, it ended badly. Did she treat on you?" John gives his friend a bewildered expression and slightly shakes his head. "She didn’t treat on me, but it ended badly indeed. Somehow." When John doesn’t continue, Sherlock can’t hold back. "An elder sibling... brother. Didn’t he approve of you? No... he rather approved too much of you." John shoots him an angry glance. "Bill and I didn’t... do anything before I broke up with Joleen. And we even waited several weeks before we started seeing each other." – "How very considerate." – "Hey, what would you have done?" – "I have absolutely no idea. The whole scenario seems utterly absurd", Sherlock answers blankly.
"...back." Sherlock opens his eyes, startled. "Never seen your Mind Palace thing having that effect", John states with an amused jerk of his head towards Sherlocks groin. Sherlock lifts his head to be greeted by the sight of a roomy tent, built into his pyjamas. He grunts and lets his head fall back to the couch. "Mind Palace John gives stupid advice", he mutters. "Told you to stay off my laptop", John shouts from the kitchen, where he’s putting the groceries to the fridge.
Sherlock is thoroughly confused, but glad, that John leaves the room. He is terribly out of his depths. The act has been more than enjoyable, so there is no reason for the current miserable feeling. Anger kicks in. He feels exposed and vulnerable and wonders how he couldn’t have foreseen it and stop the whole nonsense before he confessed having a crush on John. Even though he’s angry now, the tears continue to leave his eyes and wet his curls. He perceives of the water running in the loo. The doctor must be washing himself and Sherlock really, really hopes that he’ll go upstairs afterwards and let’s him be.
don’t keep me safe, I’m perfectly capable of doing that myself.  Did you possibly think you’d be the first lust-crazed boyfriend I’ve had to thwart?”
Sherlock’s idea of a lovely evening with John involves putting up with his crap telly while wriggling his toes under John’s bum, drawing maps of John’s freckles, and interrogating John about the minutiae of his life, which Sherlock stores in boxes of cleanly cut index cards in the office of his mind palace.  Some 10 percent of them he also writes in careful longhand on actual physical cards, which he occasionally shuffles through when John is late from the clinic.
Weeks go by and John starts a list in his head.  It is a fairly short list, each item headed with a bullet point, the whole titled “What Sherlock likes”.  It reads “fingers stroking in his hair”, “sitting too close while watching crap telly”, and, more hopefully, “pressure on the small of his back”.  John watches carefully for additions to his list, but they are few and far between, and often don’t hold up when repeated.  He starts another list entitled “What Sherlock liked at least once” and adds “being held by the shoulders”, “having his forehead kissed”, “drawing small circles on the soles of his feet,” and “ticklish around ears” with a question mark.
“That’s what sex is, Sherlock.  It releases tension.  It’s almost impossible to do it and not feel … happy … with the other person.  For me, I mean.  Obviously there’s a lot of people out there who are ... who can abuse sex, or get bored with it, or even use it to control someone else, but, well, that’s not me.”  He wonders how much he can tell Sherlock without triggering a relapse, but Sherlock asks, with genuine curiosity,
Sherlock has seen John's look and where it was directed, but his hands continue to move over John's body.  Very slowly, Sherlock lowers his mouth over John's forehead. The tip of his tongue reaches out to carress John eyebrow.  Then it is gone as Sherlock looks searchingly at John's face, then returns to touch just the corner of John's open eye.  A tremor goes through Sherlock's body, and John feels his own skin beginning to fray, tiny bits of his nerves nakedly exposed to pure pleasure, and it's too much, he can't hold on and he can't let go, his breath comes in tiny spurts as he struggles not to lose consciousness.
John has no clue how Sherlock has managed even one other relationship, but instead he says “Wolf-hound, maybe.  I can’t think of anyone less like a puppy, Sherlock.” Despite himself, Sherlock’s mouth crooks into half a smile, and John wants so badly to forget everything, to surrender to momentary warmth that doesn’t solve anything.
John blinks in surprise, savoring the sudden warmth flooding into his limbs.  “Always,” he answers, and follows Sherlock to bed.
“I am in fact making crème brulée for Mrs. Hudson and myself,” Sherlock attempted to look angelic while brushing at the remainder of the grocery receipt. “Should be ready by tea. You’re welcome to stay if you’re not busy.”
John barks out a laugh.  “Well, there was the magnifying glass, and the mud, and the razor, and the trampoline, and the sleeping with you…”
The flat is bugged, John has to assume that at least, so communicating his message to Mrs. Hudson takes some creativity.  Mycroft can say what he likes, and no doubt will, but John knows that England would fall before Mrs. Hudson would betray Sherlock, and he won’t tolerate the thought of her losing both of them in the same week.
"No?" asks Sherlock, and he sits peacefully for long moments, his eyes drifting closed.  Then, softly, "Not even if I said
"Look, Sherlock, I spent months fantasizing about anything and everything with you.  I never told you that, but it's true. Anything you wanted to do right now would be fine by me."
want, John.  I do, and I can’t tell you what I want because I don’t know, but you are … you are the first person who ever gave me the time to realize there
They lock eyes and Sherlock recovers in an instant, but despite that neither of them are breathing, and when John leans towards Sherlock, he couldn’t have uttered a word.  Instead he just lifts his eyebrows to ask for permission, and Sherlock nods once, and then they are kissing. John meant it to be only a quiet, close-mouthed thing -- whether Sherlock enjoyed kissing or not wasn’t the sort of topic they’d discussed (not beyond ‘married to my work’, thank you very much) but things get out of hand quickly.  He feels Sherlock’s mouth open like an invitation, so he plunges in.
