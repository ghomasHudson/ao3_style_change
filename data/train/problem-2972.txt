“No Cas, not a hunter,” Sam grunted. “My friend is not cut out to do what we do, sadly.”
“How so Cas…” Dean grumbled, putting the impala in park before shutting off the engine. “What—we have a little sleepover, braid Sam’s hair, watch scary movies in one room, then play stupid college games like ‘ultimate frisbee?’ Please, I rather just go out drinking…”
Clearing his throat to signal the two to be quiet, Sam rolled down the impala’s shotgun’s side window and smiled. “Uh, hey there Sir,” Sam forced himself to say as polite as he could while he himself also leaned forward towards the open window. “Forgive me please if I took your spot in the driveway—but I think we’re a bit lost.”
As the eldest witch chastised the other two—much like an older, loving sister would do to reestablish order in times of chaos—Castiel silently rushed to the Winchester’s side; determined to help them however he could. Yet, the very second he approached the two brothers, he was met with reprisal.
Refusing to comment before he knew what was going on, for James’s wardrobe had changed very suddenly since last he saw him, Dean gave James a quick glance over to review what he had missed.
Instantly Dean was thrust into the air and pinned against the ceiling. Held in place thereafter by the otherworldly gravitational force that the witch controlled, Dean glared back downward and cursed. “Son of a Bitch!” Dean spat. “Let me go!”
“Good work,” Fiona said. “It is done.”
Step. Step. Step. The owner of the voice came closer.
“Dude, it is on the other side of the home most likely.” Sam replied, leering back at Dean with a frown. “The majority of these homes here overlook the beach itself—or at least a part of it.”
“Thank you, Dean.” Castiel muttered.
Sam just shook his head, then scrolled back up on his phone to read the other text as best he could; including Dean’s as well. “Arrier…” Sam muttered. “E, it a arrier…”
Once both his flank and his front were clear, Dean dashed for the front door and slammed himself against it. Quickly locking the front door before daring to glare out the side window next to it, Dean grinned momentarily.
“He is armed!” Dean snapped back. “He has a weapon in his pocket and he is going to pull it on Sammy!”
“Rigor mortis?” Sam said softly. “Or is it a tonic seizure?”
Succeeding with his endeavor of threading the leather string, Dean inserted the string through the small glass loop sitting on top of the glass vial containing Castiel’s grace, and tied it snuggly. Thereafter, Dean stood up and walked towards Castiel. Upon reaching him, Dean secured the remaining end of the leather string around Castiel’s bare neck and formed a makeshift necklace. However, before he dared to leave Castiel’s side, Dean quickly made sure the twist-on top of the vial was secure and both ends of the knots were strong enough to support the vial’s weight. Only then did he return back to his seat and continued to sulk.
“I think it says, ‘I sense… something nearby.’” Sam muttered. “As for the second part, it says, ‘James, I— Crossfire?’”
Meeting the witch’s gaze within seconds while his body floated aimlessly a few inches away from the floor, unable to move nor retaliate unless elsewise permitted by the witch itself, Sam shuddered in place. “I’m sorry,” Sam forced himself to say. “We—My brother and I—mean you—”
“Forgive me, it is just I rather not say it…” Castiel replied.
“Damn it,” Dean growled.
.” Fiona pointed directly at Castiel’s chest and to the glass vial containing his grace that rested upon it. Twisting her wrist ever so slightly as she pointed, Fiona rotated her hand counter-clockwise until her pinky pointed up and her thumb was facing downward. “I suggest you amend your oversight, or least we risk losing Blue-eyes later through other means—due to his current state of mortality.”
There was no answer. Instead, there was only swift retribution.
, if you don’t mind!”
Pausing first for what seemed like a minute or so to allow Dean to counter his statement, Castiel continued to stare at Dean inquisitively, never once blinking while he waited. Following that, Castiel sighed and continued on. “Regardless Dean,” the blue-eyed angel cooed. “You drove for 10 hours straight without pause, blasting your favorite song albums nonstop back to back as you drove 80 miles per hour down the stretch of roads marked out for us by Sam. You need your rest.”
Sam didn’t respond, instead he just exhaled roughly with a drawn-out sigh. Blinking twice before speaking again, Sam ignored his brother and continued to talk to Castiel.
“Alright then, Sam.” Dean grumbled. “We’ll drive back to your friend’s place and check if he is safe, but the priority here is still Cas.”
James shot a quick uncompassionate glare at Castiel, yet said nothing in return. In response, Castiel just calmly looked back at him with an aloof glare of his own. Following that, the two just stared at one another indifferently, never once blinking for the longest time until it was required. Although, after a period of unbreakable silence which seemed to go on for countless minutes, Castiel was the first to speak; driven to start the conversation anew.
“That’s it Sammy, I’m going to blow his head off!” Dean said, reaching for his gun. “He’s reaching for a weapon!”
As the two brothers conversed with one another, ever oblivious to their beloved companion, Castiel, the angel himself, jerked suddenly without warning. Fixating his gaze thereafter on something in the distance, Castiel’s once stern expression shifted instantly to that of dread. “Something’s wrong…” The blue-eyed angel said, his face flushed and his eyes wide with concern.
For a brief period following James’s comment, the only thing that was exchanged was utter silence. No one present dared to comment nor make light of the supposed situation. Not even Dean, though he was still angered from the loss of his prized possessions, dared to jeer James anymore than he already had. He too was silent; lost in contemplation of how to proceed. Nevertheless, despite the long awkward silence, James chose to break it willingly himself; determined to explain what needed to be said.
“Whatever,” Dean grumbled. “I’m just glad we got to go to the market and pick up everything including beer!”
Sam just turned around to glare at Dean, his eyes narrowed in frustration. “It’s his phone…” Sam said, raising his voice minorly so that he could speak over the clamor of the scuffle. “It is his damn I-phone!”
…” The witch said with a sneer. “And ‘we’ wouldn’t want that to happen so soon… Because that would be tragic.”
Dean quickly glanced back and his best friend before Castiel started to speak again. Catching a brief moment of Castiel’s cute smile just before it vanished from sight, Dean could not help but grin subtly; his own mood improving almost instantaneously the second he saw Castiel’s dimples.
“Done already?” Fiona asked, before returning her gaze back to Sam’s phone.
Castiel just sighed weakly, then gestured to the witch known now as
“Damn,” Dean said, his voice low, yet blunt. “The witch discovered that I locked her out.” The eldest Winchester then stood back up and bolted forth, following the trail of bloody footprints to wherever it led. “Come Sammy—time to save your college friend.”
“T#I$ PL@c& I$ ^^@R&d t00.”
.” Castiel said, as his eyes began to glow softly divine luminosity. “And despite the unrelenting anguish and anger that enshrouds you—inspired by this corrupt and shameful world—it is these attributes alone that I sense emanate from you unquestionably.”
” Fiona muttered.
“Not going to happen, Dean!” Castiel snapped. “You didn’t sleep a wink while I drove!” Castiel reached down into his trench coat’s pocket and pulled out a cassette tape with both his index and middle finger. Waving it back and forth in the air as he displayed it to Dean while he spoke, Castiel shook his head with mild grimace. “Though you said you would sleep during my turn behind the wheel, I know you were just pretending to sleep!” Castiel balked. “You were listening silently with a grin on your face as I played my choice of music for the road trip!”
“You mean he is a hunter?” Castiel asked.
“Whatever Samantha…” Dean sneered. “All I know is this all better be worth it in the end—or there will be hell to pay!”
Dean raises a hand, and for a moment, it looks like he’s going to reach forward and cup Cas’ cheek, but it just hangs in the air for a moment before dropping back to the mattress. There’s a long stretch of silence then, and Dean swallows nervously a couple times before he speaks again.
He pretends that any of this matters.
“Spending the weekend with Claire and Kaia,” Sam answers as he passes the baby to Eileen. “They’re taking out a vampire nest up in Michigan.”
The Shadow purses its lips, and melts its body into the image of Cas. “What angel?”
Chuck might be dead, but so is Jack. Dean has tried to kill Jack before (then again, how much of that was really him, and how much of that had been plotted by Chuck?) but this is the first time that he’s followed through with it.
Something is
Sam grabs the shoulder of Dean’s jacket and stops his brother in his tracks. “Purgatory is where Chuck put his worst mistakes! Why would he give them a chance to sneak into Heaven?”
It was perfect.
How is it not there?
still echoes in Dean’s ringing ears.
“I think I would like that,” Cas answers after a moment.
Cas takes a sip of whiskey. “No.”
“He had made a deal with the empty. Back when Jack died. The first time. In exchange for bringing Jack back, the empty would take Cas. But only——only when he was happy. Only when he let himself be happy.” A weak sob wrenches its way from Dean. “He told me he loved me, Sam. That was——that was it.” He tips his head back against the cabinet and lets fresh tears run down the sides of his face. “I never got to say it back.” He closes his eyes.
Because hearing Dean say that makes Cas pretty damn happy.
See y'all soon!
And Cas...
Cas studies Dean——the illusion of Dean——going purple-faced in the dim light of the room, and squeezes harder. Dean paws at Cas’ hands weakly, and a terrified wheeze escapes him. Still, Cas doesn’t let go. If he kills Dean, the illusion ends. That’s how it always ends. Then they can start over. Maybe next time Dean will be less caring. Then it won’t hurt as much to know it isn’t real.
Dean wobbles to his feet and carefully steps over Sam before he politely heaves his guts up into the green
Dean thinks back to the rest of his time in Heaven, then to what he can remember of what had happened after Chuck.
He can’t, though. He can’t waste his energy on grief.
Amid the wreckage, Dean laughs for the first time in months.
Sam scowls in Dean’s direction. “The trees don’t all look the same.”
There’s a deep, lonely ache in his chest that refuses to go away. A hole where Cas used to be, before he was taken by something just as horrible as what Dean has become. Dean’s skin hurts from the power constantly washing through him, but it doesn’t matter much. Dean has been ignoring pain for years, and this is no different. Besides, it’s not like he doesn’t deserve it, especially after he’s failed so much.
“Ophiotaurus.”
They’re a miserable scene, really, and every one of them knows it. It doesn’t take long for Sam to finish rinsing the dishes and setting them to dry. After that, he sits a couple feet away from Dean and watches Jack sleep, feeling drained.
And if he can’t hunt, what’s his purpose?
Dean has the audacity to
That round ends with Dean staring blankly at nothing and mumbling Enochian. It’s sad, really, how breakable Dean is——both mentally and physically. Chuck had tried to write out most of Dean’s mental issues early on, before the Winchesters had caught onto his meddling. But over time, and without proper maintenance, the walls hiding them have broken down somewhat, and the more Chuck tries to work around all of the feelings Dean has connected to Castiel, the more disastrous things seem to become. Castiel has managed to weave his presence into nearly every nook and cranny of Dean’s brain, and trying to cut the angel out of anything only makes Dean worse. That doesn’t stop Chuck from continuing to try, though.
It had seemed like the right thing to do at the time, though. Dean loves driving, he really does, but something about this feels artificial. Maybe that's just Heaven. None of it is real anymore, but it seems wrong somehow. It's the right thing to do, though.
“——sleep.”
“Right. Cas will... he’ll need to fall. Become human.”
Yeah. That would go over as well as the time Dean replaced all of Sam’s Tofurky with the real deal.
“I’m not killing you!” Sam says, sounding appalled.
“Where are we?”
On the road, and on a roundabout path to killing god.
Dean’s head snaps up to look at Cas, his eyes wild and red-rimmed. “Cas?” He croaks. His voice is raspy, and he winces as he talks, something that is undoubtedly Cas’ fault.
I hope you like it!
Dean——the
(Chuck would much rather not go into detail on the ‘bad days.’ Dean shouldn’t be having them in the first place.)
They head out, kill some vampires, and Dean dies. It’s touching, really. Chuck even makes himself cry a little. The kicker is when he pushes the real Dean to awareness right before his tattered heart stops beating.
Dean doesn’t even want to begin to think about how he’s going to explain this to Cas. He
Sam is passed out cold in his bedroom. He’s earned a rest, and after Cas’ return, all energy had seemed to drain from his body, and he had barely made it back to his bed before passing out. Jack had been nearly unconscious by the time Dean and Cas had managed to pass through the door, but had managed to stay awake just long enough to give Cas a hug. Dean had carried the kid to his room while Sam and Cas had gotten reacquainted. He was dead asleep, and hadn’t so much as stirred when Dean had tucked him under a blanket.
The silence continues, and the atmosphere thickens. Words, thoughts, and feelings rattle around Dean’s chest, nearly suffocating him with their attempts to be heard. Even now that he knows he can have Cas, he can seem to make the words he wants to say order themselves properly.
Levels of unreality aside, Cas still has nightmares, and that’s what has him jerking awake at three in the morning, soaked with sweat, and shaking like a leaf. It’s dark——so dark——and for a moment Cas is certain that he’s broken the illusion and woken up to see the empty as it truly is, but then he’s thrown from his racing thoughts back into his body, and it becomes apparent he’s still trapped in the illusion.
drunk, but Sam knows better. Dean is good at acting sober when he has to. Sam walks over to Dean, prepared to lay into his brother for getting smashed when they’ve got
All the same, Dean throws the knife into the first trash can he sees. At this point, there are far too many bad memories attached to it to justify keeping it. He leaves Sam and Jack to their business, and locks himself in his room before stripping off his jacket, flannel, and shirt. The jagged gash on his side protests, and decides to continue bleeding when Dean keeps moving about.
“Please,” Dean wheezes. Cas can feel the air rush from Dean’s lungs, and hear as Dean begins to choke on nothing.
Maybe he does more than wonder.
“Damnit,” he groans, coughing. “Where the hell are we?”
Sam doesn’t end up on the floor at five in the morning, drunk off his ass, with only incomprehensible scribbles to show for it.
at each other. Their lips meet again, and that’s always when Cas jerks back like he’s been burned and spits up oily black liquid all over himself.
to give up. It’s just not written into his code.
The two of them stood, leaning on each other for a long time.
“You did?” Cas’s look of concern shifted to one of surprise.
he thought. He didn’t even realize how fast he was walking until Cas called after him.
“Look, we’re leaving and there’s nothing I can do!” Dean turned away and began walking again.
He can go now.
“Let’s get you out of here,” Dean stood and helped Cas to stand, holding onto his hand, “Just… close your eyes.”
“Dean, please, I can’t lose you!” Cas begged.
And that's a wrap. Thank you so much for reading!
Thump.
At around 9:30 pm, Dean decided he’d better leave. It was getting late and he didn’t want to impose. Plus, he’d told Sam that he would be back before he went to bed, and he wasn’t about to give his little brother the satisfaction of seeing him come home any later.
He felt like he was floating, and he couldn’t tell which way was up and which was down, but he wasn’t moving. He was absolutely still. It felt like the moment just between asleep and waking, where the world of dreams and reality blur, and everything looks and feels doused in a warm, hazy glow.
By some miracle, Sam hadn’t asked about the coat. It certainly wasn’t a woman’s coat, nor would it fit any girl his age. It was large on Cas and only slightly less large on Dean. Maybe Sam just hadn’t noticed. Whatever the case, he was glad Sam didn’t ask. Quiet as he could, he unbuttoned his shirt and put on an old T-shirt instead. As he laid down, he considered his leather jacket which was draped over the opposite arm of the couch, right where he’d left it before heading to the Novaks’, but neglected it and instead pulled Cas’s coat up over his torso as his blanket. He much preferred this; it was warmer, it was softer, and it smelled like Cas. He let his mind wander back to when he and Cas sat together on the hill, and how wonderful it felt when he laid his head on Cas’s shoulder, and when Cas did the same to him. A contented smile tugged at his lips as he drifted off.
Thump.
And they shared a kiss. Cas’s hands cradled the back of Dean’s neck, and Dean’s encircled Cas’s waist, pulling him as close as he could, but it was still hardly close enough. He breathed Cas’s sweet honey and cinnamon scent, he heard Cas’s own even breaths, he felt the soft fabric of Cas’s shirt beneath his fingertips, and he tasted Cas on his tongue as their lips pressed together. All of his senses were flooded with Cas, and it was heaven. He ran a hand through Cas’s soft hair, Cas sighed in appreciation, and it was paradise. Cas’s kisses traveled gradually from his lips to his jaw to his neck to his collarbone and it was bliss.
The month flew by full of stolen glances, lots of photographs, lunch break make-out sessions in the janitor’s closet at school, and of course, countless I love you’s. Dean had never been more happy in his life. He could almost forget about the innumerable horrors that prowled the Earth, so long as Cas’s hand was in his. He’d completely forgotten what it felt like before every one of his days ended with a kiss on his lips.
“I’m… I’m okay,” Dean breathed,
“Sorry!” Sam slapped a hand over his eyes but continued speaking. “You guys need to get up and get dressed right now. Dad just pulled into the parking lot.”
“Jesus! What the hell, Sam?” Dean exclaimed at his brother who stood in the doorway. He quickly pulled the blanket up to cover himself and Cas.
“Dean, I’m so sorry, I shouldn’t have- I should- oh God, are you okay?”
Dean hadn’t thought that this would be the day.
Once outside the apartment building, Dean started towards Cas’s house without having to think. He’d been there so many times in the last month, he knew exactly which way to go. He’d memorized every turn. He didn’t wait for Cas, just began walking swiftly, his hands shoved in his pockets, and the cool evening air stinging his already teary eyes, making them water even more.
“Nope, it’s… just us.” Dean kicked himself mentally. He hadn’t meant to make that sound so… implicative. Cas didn’t seem bothered, so he brushed it off. “Want to watch some TV?” he asked.
. At some point during the movie, the few inches of space that had existed between them vanished, and they sat shoulder to shoulder, hip to hip. Some time later, Cas’s hand found Dean’s, and Dean gasped ever so slightly. Luckily, an R.O.U.S. had just jumped on screen, tackling Westley, so Dean had an excuse to be startled. They stayed like that for a long time, their hands clasped between them as they watched the famous sword battle between Inigo and Count Rugan, then Westley, Inigo, and Buttercup jumping from the window into Fezzik’s arms, and finally the lot of them riding off on their four white horses.
Dean ran straight for the large vamp and tackled him to the ground. The floorboards beneath the two of them let out a loud crack and suddenly they were falling, tumbling through the decaying, hay covered floor and into some sort of lower level. Dean landed on top of the vamp and immediately raised his machete.
Dean shut the apartment door quietly in case Sam was already asleep, then turned around and leaned his back against the door and looked up at the ceiling, happiness welling up inside him. He exhaled slowly, replaying the events of the evening in his head and smiling to himself.
Then his angel led him by the hand, gripped him tight and raised him just as he’d done all those years ago, to heaven to say his hellos again.
John eased open the rickety barn door and crept inside while Sam and Dean waited behind, concealed by the shadow of the door.
“Are you alright? Are you hurt?” Dean asked, hurriedly running his fingers over the sides of Cas’s neck, checking for bite marks. He found none.
“I’m afraid it’s just you and me this time.”
Dean heard the front door open just as he finished zipping his pants. He glanced back at Cas, who had just finished tugging on his shirt. There wouldn’t be time to sneak him out, he’d have to face his father. He gave Cas one more desperate, apologetic look before opening the bedroom door. He could hear Sam talking to John on the other side of the apartment.
“How was your date?”
“And I, you, Dean,” Cas smiled tearfully.
“Yeah,” Dean replied, pulling it from the inside pocket of his jacket where he always kept it.
Dean scoffed. “What are you getting at?” he asked defensively, gathering up his photos and tucking them back into his pocket.
Thump.
“Cas?” Dean called as he frantically tried to follow Cas’s voice, “Where are you?”
They drove for what seemed like forever to Dean until finally, John pulled the Impala into the gravel drive of an old, dilapidated barn. “They were camped out here when I found them,” he gestured to the rundown structure.
Sam only stared at Dean, his smirk turning to a look of absolute bewilderment.
“We’ll go slow.”
Dean huffed a laugh. “No, Sam, I didn’t. We just ate dinner and then she showed me how to take pictures, then we read some Ray Bradbury together.” Dean pulled the stack of pictures Cas had given him out of his shirt pocket and showed them to Sam, all except the picture of Cas.
“Dean?” he asked softly. Dean could feel Cas’s low voice vibrating through his chest as he lay his head there, paying more attention to Cas’s steady heartbeat than the TV as Cas lay under him, his arm resting in the middle of Dean’s back, holding him close.
Dean laughed tearfully, letting out a sigh of relief. “God, Cas, I’m sorry, I’m so sorry.”
“Let’s just take the kid and go,” he heard one of the vamps say through the ringing in his ears.
TW: Anxiety/Panic attacks
They held each other after, each basking lazily in the other’s warmth. They laid on their sides, Cas behind Dean, his arms encircling Dean’s waist, his head resting on the pillow and his lips pressing soft, reverent kisses to the back of Dean’s neck. Dean’s arms were crossed over Cas’s, his fingers tracing patterns lightly and lovingly over Cas’s forearms.
“Hey, hey,” Dean sat up and gathered Cas into his arms, “we’ll figure something out, okay? My dad said he’d be gone for at least six weeks, most likely more. It’s only been four. We’ve got time.”
“It was wonderful,” he smiled to himself.
John, Sam, and Dean finished giving Cas “The Talk” as they drove back into town. Cas took it fairly well, although by the end of the drive, Dean’s hand was numb. He didn’t mind, though.
(See the end of the chapter for
Dean stopped walking and let Cas put a gentle hand on his shoulder.
Both he and Cas jumped up and stumbled around the small bedroom, rushing to dress themselves. Dean’s hands fumbled nervously with the buttons on his shirt. It had barely been four weeks. Why was John back so soon? His head was spinning and fear bloomed inside of his chest. This wasn’t right.
Thump.
Dean was shoved to the ground and pain jolted through him as he hit the concrete on his hands and knees. He could hear Cas yelling for him as he was roughly pulled to his feet by a young man in dark clothing.
“You sure you’re okay with this?” Cas asked again.
“How was your date?” He asked, switching off the TV. He asked Dean the same thing every time he returned home from spending time with Cas, and Dean had given up telling Sam that they weren’t dates days ago.
?” Dean asked.
. No more goodbyes.
Cas didn’t have to say it, but he did. He told Dean that he loved him whenever he had the chance. And every time, Dean would smile and say, “I love you too, Cas,” as if his entire vocabulary consisted of only those five words, and those five words were all Dean needed.
The vamp let out a strangled gurgling sound as he looked down at the jagged piece of metal sticking squarely out of his chest.
Cas’s hand, previously curled around Dean’s shoulder, came up to stroke his hair and hold Dean’s head gently to his chest. Dean’s eyes darted up to Cas’s, and Cas’s left the page momentarily to look into Dean’s, but his fluency was unwavered.
The large man let go of Cas, and the woman shoved him up against the chain link fence, pinning him there.
“Yes,” Cas answered sincerely, as if he’d heard everything Dean had been thinking.
Cas changed the pronoun from “her” to “his” as he brushed Dean’s hair from his forehead with feather-light fingers, as if he was the poet and he’d crafted this literary paragon solely out of his love for Dean. It reminded Dean of the days when he’d read little Sammy to sleep. His favorite story was
Dean thought for a moment, then replied. “We’ll run away together. You and me. After we graduate, we’ll get a little place in the city. You can take your pictures, I’ll find work in an auto shop somewhere, hell, we can even get a dog.”
“You’re welcome,” Sam said after a moment. “Now go get Cas before he leaves the building. Don’t make him walk home in the rain,” He instructed and gave Dean an encouraging pat on the shoulder.
“What are we going to do? When your dad comes back, I mean,” Cas asked, bringing his own hand up and placing it softly over Dean’s.
Sam promised not to bring him back.
“Well well well, if it id’nt Johnny Winchester. We been waitin’ for you.”
Dean didn’t want to let go. He let himself think that he could stay here, in Cas’s arms, forever, that as long as they didn’t let go, nothing could take them away from each other. “I never want to let go of you,” he whispered after a moment.
“No, I haven’t,” Cas shrugged.
“Yeah, I did, I’ve just… y’know, I’ve never done that with a guy before. Not that it’s all that different, I just,” Dean paused, “I just started thinking about all the things my dad would say if he knew.”
But he didn’t yell, nor did he cry. He knew better than to do so in front of John. He looked down at the floor and said, “Yes, sir,” then walked to the front door, motioning for Cas to follow him.
Sam and Dean both nodded.
As the movie played, the two of them sat in silence. It wasn’t a stiff or an awkward silence, nor was it heavy. It was a warm, comfortable silence that both of them could feel at home in, in which they could just
Cas was taking him to heaven.
He almost laughed at the thought, but couldn’t quite draw the breath he needed. He was on death’s door and thinking about his throwing stars. Stupid. He’d thought about other things too, mostly stupid things like what he ate for breakfast this morning (his last meal, he realized) and where he left Miracle’s leash after taking him for a walk, (when was the last time he’d taken Miracle for a walk?) and did he remember to reset his alarm clock this morning (It doesn’t matter) and did he finish filling out that job application form on his desk and did he take his clean clothes out of the dryer last night (it won’t matter, it won’t matter)
“Hello,” Said Castiel uncertainty.
“Oh come on, Dean, your phone call yesterday, you sounded practically giddy and the way Castiel told the story was that you ‘saved him and his friends’. You forget I know you… and he is very attractive, you’d make a cute couple…”
"You are Win67.. aren't you?"
Castiel takes a deep breath, shaking his head, deciding he’s had enough he climbs up and over Dean, straddling him, the thin grey material of his boxers is the only barrier between his cock and Dean’s. He brings the palm of his hand up to Dean’s chin and grips him tightly, turning his head so that Dean’s forced to face him and shocking him into silence.
“Jack, when he took me from the empty, he told me he was giving me a gift, he said I’d never have to go to the empty again. When I die… I’ll go to heaven.”
Dean glared at him heatedly, the next words murmured between them in an act of defiance to everyone who’d ever told him, he wouldn’t have a happy ending. To everyone who’d told him that Castiel would one day leave him. To everyone who’d implied, or outright told him that what he wanted was impure… If loving Cas was an act against God, all the more reason to fucking go for it. Screw Chuck, screw them all, what mattered was here, right in front of him, in his arms. Where it had been for years and he’d been to blind to see it, this was his happiness, his best friend, his home… His angel.
Somehow, he forces himself into a sitting position, and tries to stand. It doesn’t work. His legs are numb, and his head is far too cloudy to force them to cooperate.
That is all that he needs to say. Two sentences. Seven words.
He’s not going to kill the Winchesters immediately, but he’ll be damned if he’s not going to make them suffer.
Dean shakes the thought away. He can’t think like that. Focus, damnit.
That’s Dean’s breaking point. He likes to think that he kept himself under control until he was able to leave the room, but Cas probably wouldn’t have cared either way.
Cas, and that’s what matters.
“Cas, wha——“
“What did you mean when you said you don’t remember how you died?”
Heyyyy I meant to post this yesterday, but oops I didn't because my brain hates me :) :) :)
they haven’t thought about trying.
His voice is raspy and quiet, so much so that Dean can barely hear it, and Dean walks closer, not just so that he can hear Cas more clearly. He’s drawn to Cas by an unmistakable feeling that he has always been too scared to vocalize. A thing that he’s been taught to push down, to ignore, to pretend that it doesn’t exist. A thing that he’s been told is a weakness (in a way, it is), and that it brings nothing but hurt and pain (it doesn’t).
Blood trickles down his side and soaks into his pants as he gathers what he needs, and gets ready to stitch himself up. The first step——obviously——is usually to chug enough whiskey so that it doesn’t hurt, and then go to town on your meatsuit, but the idea of alcohol makes Dean sick right now, so he forgoes it in favor of biting his tongue against the pain.
A wide grin spreads across Dean’s face, and he picks up the book, then starts for the door. “Way ahead of you, buddy.”
(Not dead. He always comes back. Always has, always will. No matter what Sam——God says. But Sam is all-knowing, and if he tells Dean that Cas is gone——)
Dean, who had been too frozen to say anything, and who will never love Cas back.
Sam doesn’t look like he knows anything at the moment, but Dean chooses not to comment on that. Instead, he takes a left turn, and rumbles further into the forest. The road decreases in quality, which isn’t entirely unusual, but before long, it’s reduced to a thin strip of dirt, far too narrow for some Heaven-illusion of Baby to drive down. Dean eases up off the gas.
He’s here, with Dean, the world is safe, and it’s all
“Please,” Dean whispers, unaware that the plea has made it to his lips. “Please no.”
Sam argues. “Again.” He sighs, long and tired. “Just... rest. Eat something. We’ll finish this later.”
Cas opens his mouth, but can’t form the words. His throat clicks, and he closes his mouth, regroups, and tries again. “It’s d——“
Dean makes himself smile and ignores the blood caked to his hair, face, and body. “Driving.” He turns the radio on, relaxes into the road, and lets it guide him. “I like it.”
Cas is waiting to die.
“I think I have a plan. Can you do a scrying spell with this?”
He wipes his mouth on the sleeve of his jacket, and it comes away wet and dark with blood. Whatever did this to him
He’s drunk.
“I miss you,” Dean whispers, pressing himself as close to Cas as he can. One of Dean’s hands is in Cas’ hair, gently holding his head.
His movements and words are stilted, and Chuck had definitely made a few mistakes in the mental health department, because now Dean has enough newly resurfaced anxiety to kill a man, which is something Chuck thought that he had gotten rid of a few dozen edits ago. This edition of Dean is also prone to stuttering, which is something Chuck had
Cas nodded to show that he understood. “Do you still have the picture of me?” he asked.
“You can sleep if you’d like, I’ll be right here,” Cas whispered into the base of his neck.
His mind, previously whirling a mile a minute began to cloud and his thoughts began to slow.
He promised to keep on living.
Dean was speechless. He opened his mouth, but instead of words, a sob came out. It took him a moment to realize that his cheeks were also wet with tears. He was doing it again. He was doing what he always did without even realizing it; in his anger and frustration, he was pushing Cas away. All the girls that Dean had pushed away before had taken it in stride, concluding that Dean was just some love-them-and-leave-them asshole that never had feelings for them in the first place, (which was sometimes true) but Cas was different. Cas pushed back. He knew exactly how much Dean loved him. Dean collapsed forward into Cas’s arms, and Cas held him tightly. Dean buried his face in Cas’s shoulder and let his sobs out, clinging to Cas like a frightened child. “I’m sorry,” he hiccupped.
He reached over and pulled his brown coat from the coat tree where it hung and held it out to Dean. “Here, take it. I won’t take no for an answer.”
“Stay. Please,” he heard Cas murmur.
Cas noticed his anxiety and seemed to understand. He nodded and said “thank you for having me over,” before exiting the apartment.
Sam didn’t shake Cas’s hand. His jaw dropped as he put the pieces together and he stared at Cas and Dean in stunned silence.
“What are you thinking about?” Dean asked after a moment, breaking the silence. He could feel Cas smiling into the back of his neck.
“Okay.”
He turned his head to the side, unable to turn all the way around and look Cas in the eye. “Please don’t ask that of me, Cas,” he muttered, his voice low and pleading. Refusing Cas’s offer hurt him more than he thought it could. “I can’t leave Sam alone with my dad. Someone needs to take care of him.”
It sounded like a dream. He wanted to stay with Cas, he wanted to have that little place together in the city and a dog. He wanted it so badly, but he couldn’t have it. He couldn’t just leave Sam. Dean thought back to every time John had left them without enough money to buy food, and he'd had to steal or hustle games of pool or poker just to feed his brother. He thought about the times when Sam needed someone to talk to, and how he was always there. Mostly he thought about all the times when John would get angry. When this happened, (which was pretty often) Dean would instinctively place himself between John's anger and Sam, taking the brunt of it.
“Bitch,” Dean shot back without missing a beat.
Sam looked at him, his brow furrowed. “Of course I won’t tell Dad. Dean, it’s okay.”
“If you enjoy it, I’m sure I will as well,” Cas smiled fondly, letting loose a swarm of butterflies in Dean’s stomach.
When the scene of Westley and Buttercup’s final kiss came on, Cas turned to look at Dean, and Dean looked back at Cas. Cas looked like he wanted to say something, but no sound came out of his mouth. They looked at each other a moment longer, both pairs of eyes drifting down to settle on the other’s lips before they connected. Dean didn’t know which of them initiated it, and he wasn’t sure he cared. Kissing Cas felt like he’d been swimming for miles and finally come up for air. He breathed Cas in as their lips crashed together like waves on a shore. Their eyes were closed and their hands had found the sides of each other’s faces as the credits rolled, and Dean was floating peacefully in Cas’s gentle waters. His heart was singing and happiness was welling up inside of him, filling him to the brim, but then he was frightened. All of the sudden he was terrified. He was drowning. Dean pulled away from Cas and gasped, fighting to fill his lungs. Cas watched in horror as Dean began to hyperventilate.
Dean was taken by surprise as Cas grabbed him by the shoulders and pushed him up against the chain link fence that bordered the sidewalk. “Don’t you dare, Dean Winchester, Don’t you dare! This last month was one of the happiest of my life. I’ve felt things with you that I’ve never felt before. I’ve told you things that I’ve never told anyone! And I never want to have a life that you aren’t a part of!” Cas’s voice dropped from a yell to practically a whisper as more tears fell from his eyes. “So don’t you dare tell me that I shouldn’t feel that way.”
John turned to look at Dean and Cas. “Who’s this?” he asked, pulling out a chair to sit down.
“I’m sure I’ll be okay,” Dean shrugged, but Cas wasn’t convinced.
Dean closed the door behind him and turned to Sam, his stomach in knots.
Dean turned his head to the TV to see the unmistakable hourglass playing on the screen and grimaced. He and Cas hadn’t been paying much attention to what came on after their movie ended. He grabbed the remote and hastily switched the TV off.  “It’s not even dark out yet, what are you doing back here?” Dean asked, trying to change the subject.
Cas just held him and let him cry, stroking his hair consolingly and murmuring soft reassurances, “It’s okay, Dean, I’ve got you. I’m here,” all the while his own tears were staining Dean’s shoulder.
giving. There was no taking between the two of them, just offering and accepting. No demands were made, no expectations were held, it was just the two of them, emerald green and sapphire blue. Every breath Dean took in time with Cas was a sweet, summer breeze. Every sound uttered between the two of them, every affirming, encouraging word was a symphony; unique, beautiful, and for their ears only. Every kiss they shared was a supernova, burning hot and bright, then collapsing in on itself with such intensity that Dean thought he would surely lose himself in it, but he didn’t. He was there, and Cas was right there with him every step of the way.
It’s okay.
“Yeah,” Dean muttered, remembering the vamp’s bruised face.
Cas and Dean talked about everything. How Cas’s parents were dead set on him going to business school like his older siblings, when all he really wanted to do was take pictures, Dean’s life on the road with Sam and John, all the schools he’d been to and the places he’d seen, (Cas had scarcely been outside of Fairfax himself.) Dean even told him about his mother and how she died. (He’d left her cause of death at a house fire, opting to omit the part where the fire had been caused by some kind of monster.) Dean didn’t tell him about monsters. The existence of monsters was one of the only two topics that they didn’t discuss, and the other was leaving. Neither of them brought it up, until one night when they were watching movies together on the couch of the apartment, Cas asked.
The four of them were on their way back into town, Sam in the passenger seat and Cas and Dean in the back. Unbeknownst to John, their hands were clasped together on the seat between them, concealed by Dean’s leather jacket that he’d laid across their laps.
“Jesus, Sammy,” he steadied himself, “I told you we were just hanging out.”
“These are good,” Sam nodded approvingly as he thumbed through the stack of pictures, then chuckled, “Who are you and what have you done with my brother?”
“Well, here I am,” John held his arms out theatrically.
And then Cas kissed him. His lips were on Dean’s in an instant, and Dean’s back met the apartment wall. His kiss was eager and impassioned, wholehearted and absolute, unequivocal and true, and Dean knew without Cas having to say a word. He knew that Cas loved him too.
But then the glow spoke, and it said the two words that woke every molecule of Dean’s being, that warmed him from head to toe. Two words that filled him with hope and ecstasy and wonder and love, two words that Dean thought he would never have the privilege of ever hearing again.
“We’ve got company,” Sam warned, a signal for John to cut the monster talk.
Cas nodded and shut his eyes.
“No, it’s okay, don’t apologize, I… I wanted this.”
Dean only stumbled once on his way down the walk from Cas’s front door. He hoped Cas hadn’t seen. When he had walked about half of a block from the house, He lowered his nose to the shoulder of the coat and inhaled deeply. The coat smelled just like Cas. He floated the rest of the way home on a cloud.
Sam told him it’s okay.
Gathering all of his strength, Dean leaned his shoulders forward and charged at the vamp, knocking him back and impaling him on the bar.
on the boxy old television.
“What?”
“Sorry, sorry,” Sam held up his hands in a submissive gesture. “Did you at least kiss her?” he asked after a moment.
The vamp stumbled back, yelling and clutching his face as blood oozed out from between his fingers.
“Sure, of course,” Dean handed him the photo, the one that he’d taken of Cas standing on the hill in the sunset, the night when Cas first put his arms around Dean. “Only if I can write something for you on your picture of me.”
of this kind of thing with you, but my dad and my brother, they can’t know. Sammy might tell my dad, and I don’t know what my dad might do.” Dean shuddered at the all too familiar memory of John Winchester’s sharp tongue. Too often he’d found himself on the receiving end of its wrath.
“Ready?” John whispered.
“This is my… friend, Cas,” Dean answered.
They’d said their goodbyes.
The three of them wordlessly exited the car, armed themselves with machetes, and approached the barn door.
“Well, don’t let the name fool you, it’s got plenty of action, you’re gonna love it,” Dean set the remote down and leaned back on the couch.
“Well shit, Sammy. You caught me, I’m a closeted bibliophile. Take me away!” Dean held his hands out in front of him, palms up as if Sam were about to slap a pair of imaginary handcuffs on him.
Before Dean could think to stop him, Cas introduced himself. “Sorry, you must be Sam,” he offered his hand for Sam to shake, “I’m Cas.”
Cas was being held back by two people, one very large man and a woman with short, brown hair. They both opened their mouths and hissed sharply, showing their fangs. They were vampires.
“Can we… try again?” Dean asked hesitantly.
“I hope so,” Dean answered. He’d never have considered a life like that before he met Cas. It had just never seemed to be in the cards for him. He wasn’t even one hundred percent sure that it would be possible, but he wanted to believe. It was easy to believe with John not around. Cas made it easy to believe.
The three vamps stood on the other side of the empty barn.
Dean returned home after another lovely evening with Cas to find Sam watching
That’s not like you at all. I’d better get my knife to make sure you aren’t really a shifter or something,” Sam joked, beginning to stand up for dramatic effect.
“Hi, Dad,” Dean greeted his father as he stepped out of the bedroom. Cas followed close behind him.
was gone.
“Oh,” Dean exhaled nervously, “that.”
But how could he have escaped the Empty? How could he be here?
It was effortless, giving himself to Cas, and it
After watching the sunset, Dean and Cas sat in Cas’s room looking through more of Cas’s photos. Dean had tried to let Cas keep the pictures they’d taken together, it was his film and camera after all, but Cas had just smiled and tucked the lot of them into Dean’s shirt pocket. They spent the rest of their evening exploring Cas’s bookshelves. Cas read a story to Dean from his book of short stories by Ray Bradbury, and Dean’s eyes never left Cas’s face. He watched intently, mesmerized by the soft flutter of Cas’s eyelashes and how his lips moved to enunciate every syllable in that low, electric voice of his that made Dean’s breath catch. He’d never before found classic literature so interesting.
“We’ll go when you’re ready,” Cas told him, without the slightest bit of impatience. He would wait ten thousand lifetimes for Dean.
“Nice to meet you, Cas,” John nodded in Cas’s direction, then turned back to Dean. “Dean, take him home. We’ll stay here tonight then we’ll get going first thing in the morning.”
“Vamps,” Dean gasped, “three of them, they took Cas.”
When John pulled the car up to the curb in front of Cas’s house, Dean insisted on walking Cas to the door. He didn’t want to take any chances.
Dean followed his voice to the last stall and shoved it open to see Cas lying on the floor, his hands and feet bound with twine.
And Cas.
Dean jumped, startled at the sound of Sam’s voice. He hadn’t noticed that he was sitting on the couch with a book in his lap.
“Where’s your boys? I was kinda hopin’ they’d come join the party.”
Cas smiled and he looked to Dean, his heart full, but his smile forlorn, as if he knew a plan like that wasn’t probable. He didn’t protest though. “I’ve never wanted anything more,” he affirmed. “Do you really think we could have a life like that?”
“Honestly, yeah. I thought you’d be gone overnight.” Sam closed his book and stood up, walking over to the table and sitting down opposite Dean.
“Right,” Dean nodded, wiping away his tears, and turned to open the door. To his surprise, Cas was right on the other side. He looked back at Sam who gave him a nod, then stepped out into the hallway with Cas and closed the door behind them. Cas looked down at the floor.
The next few days, Dean and Cas were inseparable. They sat together in Mrs. Fitzgerald’s English class and stole glances at each other while they thought she wasn’t looking, they ate lunch together, and Dean was over at Cas’s house nearly every evening. They read to each other, snapped photo after photo, they watched TV, they talked, they laughed, they smiled. By the end of the week, Dean knew; he had fallen headfirst in love with Castiel Novak, and he didn’t give a damn. Sure, the realization still frightened him, but he wasn’t scared shitless anymore. He loved Cas, and it made perfect sense. The two of them couldn’t be more different, but yet they were one and the same. Emerald green and sparkling sapphire blue, swirled together like acrylic on paintbrush, amalgamating to form the deep sea color of Cas’s bedroom walls. Cas’s bedroom walls, against which Dean leaned, sitting side by side with Cas on the floor, Dean’s head on his shoulder and a book between them, Cas’s honeyed voice reciting the poetry on the page with such eloquent inflection. The heavenly sound entered Dean’s ears and flowed straight to his heart, and the world was right. There were no monsters, there were no ghosts. There was no school, no people, no anything. There was only Dean, Cas, voice, page, and walls. Yes, the world was right indeed.
Dean was never going to let go again.
Letting out a yell, Dean leaned back and then threw his head forward, smashing it hard against the vamp’s nose.
“Dean?”
“Oh, hey Dean. I didn’t expect to see you here, I thought you’d be at Cas’s house,” Sam paused and looked over at the TV. “You’re watching
Dean took the opportunity to twist around in the other vamp’s grasp and land a knee to his groin. As the vamp doubled over, Dean broke himself completely free of his grip and brought his knee up to his face. The vamp fell back onto the sidewalk and Dean kicked him hard in the side. He felt a pair of arms grip him from behind and hiss loudly, and swung his arm around, his elbow plunging into the vamp’s gut. He whirled around and tackled the vamp to the ground, landing punch after punch to his face. Dean’s fist was raised for another hit when he was grabbed from behind and slammed down onto the ground. Pain racked through his head as it collided with the concrete.
Cas walked him to the door and pulled it open. Chilly night air seeped into the entrance of the house. “You’re going to freeze if you walk home without a jacket,” He warned.
Dean wrapped his arms protectively around Cas, holding him as tight as he could.
Dean looked and sure enough, a slight drizzle had started. He hadn’t even noticed. Sam finally turned his attention to Cas. “Who are you?” he asked.
Dean smiled and allowed Cas to slip the coat over his shoulders. “Thanks, Cas, I’ll uh.. I’ll give it back to you at school tomorrow.”
Dean turned back to Cas and nodded. “I’m ready.”
. That’s all that matters. It doesn’t matter that he isn’t a girl. You never had to pretend that he was. You’re my big brother, you practically raised me, and I’ll love and support you no matter what.”
“Those things weren’t human, were they? I mean, their teeth…” Cas trailed off.
Dean lifted his head from Cas’s chest so that he could look into his eyes. He brought a hand up to Cas’s face and ran his thumb lightly over his cheekbone. “I don’t even want to think about leaving you.”
“Shit,” John spat, “get your gear and let’s go. I know where they’ll be.”
Most of the dialogue from this chapter is from s04e13 "After School Special" with a few tweaks added here and there.
As of now, I have no plans for continuing this work or making it part of a series as I am out of ideas. However, if this work left any other creators feeling inspired, I'd love to see where you take it.
“Vampires,” John answered bluntly from the driver’s seat. “They looked pretty beat up too. Did you do that, Dean?”
Sam’s eyes were reassuring and seemed to say, “We will.”
“You told me that you were only going to be here a month or two while your father was out of town on a job,” Cas explained.
“Yeah, it’s okay. You told me you love him and that’s
“I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to eavesdrop, I was going to go to the lobby and call my parents to come pick me up but,” he paused and looked up at Dean, his blue eyes wide with wonder, “Did you really tell Sam that… you love me?”
“SHUT UP!” Dean roared and swung the machete down, slicing through the vamp’s neck before he could finish his sentence. He breathed heavily, steadying himself as he stared down at the vamp’s headless body.
Dean pawed around at the ground beneath him, searching for his machete. When he found it, he faced the vamp and raised it, ready to swing it down and end him. A beam of light shone down from the hole in the floor that they’d broken through and landed on the impaled vamp like a spotlight. His face was dotted with purple and greenish bruises and his nose was swollen and crooked from when Dean had beat him earlier.
Dean invited Cas to the apartment the next day. He’d wanted to for a while now, but his fear always got the better of him. He was afraid that Cas would be disgusted with how he lived, especially considering how nice Cas’s house was. He was afraid of Sam finding out that the girl he’d been telling him about for more than a week, the girl he told Sam that he loved, wasn’t a girl at all. He was afraid that Sam would tell John that his eldest son was in love with a boy. He was mostly afraid of what his father would think, or say, or do. But John wasn’t there, and Sam would be staying after school with Barry for an astronomy club meeting. He’d told Dean all about how the whole club was going to get pizza and stargaze from the school football field. He wouldn’t be home until late, so Dean figured it was safe.
Cas looked around, taking in the dusty cabinets and bare walls. Dean knew what he must have been thinking, but Cas didn’t comment. Instead he turned to Dean. “Your brother’s not home?” he asked.
There was so much Dean wanted to say to Cas, to do with Cas, but the moment was cut short by the sound of the door opening. Cas and Dean immediately jumped away from one another, putting a good twelve inches of space between them and sitting back so as to give the impression that they were simply watching TV as Sam strode in, a glum look on his face. He dropped his heavy backpack on the floor and shuffled over to the living room before finally noticing Dean.
Dean nodded as he held the stitch in his side and tried to catch his breath.
“Dean!” Cas called from behind him, jogging to catch up. “Dean, please, slow down and talk to me.” Cas caught up to Dean and grabbed him by the shoulder. Dean turned and caught Cas’s wrist in his hand.
Dean wanted to cry. He wanted to scream. He wanted to yell at his father, to tell him that he wasn’t ready yet. He and Cas were supposed to have more time.
“Yeah, I am,” Dean replied, and he was. He’d never been so sure about anything in his life.
“Have you ever seen
“You let go of him, you son of a bitch!” Dean roared, struggling against the vamp that held him. Red hot anger boiled in the pit of his stomach.
“Dean, I…” Cas stammered, at a loss for words.
“Dean,” Cas whimpered helplessly, his face pressed against the fence.
“I’m so sorry, Dean, I shouldn’t have… I didn’t mean to scare you.”
“I don’t want to make you uncomfortable,” Cas started.
He was afraid. He was afraid, he was so afraid. And it was a different kind of afraid; one that he hadn’t felt since that night with Billie and the Empty and…
“Shut up and go to bed.”
“Heaven,” Cas affirmed with a nod, his hand still holding Dean’s.
“You just used the word ‘Bibliophile.’”
Dean turned back to Cas, taking in the sight of him. He was different somehow. He stood a little taller and looked a little brighter, as if a weight he’d been carrying around for years had been lifted from his shoulders, but he was still Cas. The same Cas that Dean loved.
John gave a small nod of approval, his eyes never leaving the road. “Good job.”
“Yeah,” Dean said without hesitation, “Yeah… I do.”
And Dean’s eyes were open. They were open in an instant, drinking in the radiant sight of his beautiful angel, (is it okay for him to think of Cas as his angel?)
Dean stood there, his anxiety levels rising, threatening to overflow and spill out of him. He was once again thrashing about in the deeps, struggling to stay afloat. He would start drowning again soon. He didn’t know what to say. There was hardly anything he could say that would make this situation any better, so he said the only thing he could think of, his gaze fixed on the floor and his voice soft, afraid, and pleading. “Please don’t tell Dad.”
“Hello, Dean.”
“There’s the Dean I know,” Sam chuckled before leaving Dean alone at the table, shutting the bedroom door behind him.
His head all of the sudden felt far too heavy for him to hold up and he let it slump to Sam’s shoulder.
The vamps slowly made their way to the center of the barn and began to circle John.
He and Cas walked home from school together that night, side by side, block after block until they reached the little apartment complex. Dean glanced absentmindedly up at the cloudy sky. He hoped it would clear up enough by tonight for Sam to see the stars. They entered the building and Dean held the door open for Cas when they reached his apartment. He took a deep breath and stepped in beside Cas.
“What, does Dean have a girl over?” he chuckled as he crossed the living room and threw his coat down on the kitchen table.
It was really Cas. He was really here.
The two of them held each other the rest of the evening. For the first time, both of them were afraid to let go.
Dean blew out an exasperated breath and stood up, pushing his chair in behind him. He shuffled over to the couch, sat down and took off Cas’s coat.
“Photography lessons? ‘Just hanging out’ with a girl? Hell,
Dean felt tears begin to slip down his face as Sam came over to hug him. “Thank you,” he sobbed, “thank you, Sammy.”
Cas only smiled and gave a small, warm laugh. “There will be plenty of time once we get to heaven, Dean.”
“What, are you surprised to see me back so early?” Dean pulled out a chair from the kitchen table and sat down.
“Yes,” Cas repeated, smiling solemnly.
Cas reached into the inner pocket of his brown coat and pulled out the picture of Dean leaning against the wall of the school, the one he’d taken on the day they met, and handed it to Dean, giving him a small smile. “Of course, Dean.”
“Me too,” Cas replied, and their beautiful, peaceful silence returned. They didn’t need to speak to one another to know what the other was saying. Every kiss on Dean’s neck, every touch on Cas’s forearm, every squeeze of Dean’s hand in Cas’s said all that needed to be said. Every one was a silent “I love you.” Their silence went unbroken a while longer, save for their even breathing, and their heartbeats. Dean savored every second of that silence, and every thump of Cas’s heart, his favorite sound in the world. He truly could have stayed there forever. He felt completely and totally relaxed, which was something that he was not accustomed to. He soon found himself feeling drowsy and let out a small yawn.
Cas nodded and they moved to the living room to sit down on the couch. Dean turned on the boxy television and started flipping through channels. He stopped when he caught the title sequence of
Dean looked up in surprise. “It’s okay?”
Dean could hear Cas speaking to him and could feel his hand gripping his shoulder. He focused on that as he tried to steady his breathing. All the while there was a voice screaming at him in the back of his head; his father’s voice. Dean squeezed his eyes shut and focused on Cas’s hand on his shoulder, blocking the voice out. He heard Cas mumble something like “probably go,” and felt his hand start to leave his shoulder. Dean’s hand flew to Cas’s wrist, holding his hand in place as his breathing began to even out. He tentatively opened his eyes to see Cas staring at him, terrified and concerned.
“May I take it? I’ll give it back to you tomorrow, I… want to write something for you on it.”
Cas’s hands found their way underneath the hem of Dean’s shirt and Dean shivered, delighted at the contact. Cas pulled away for a moment to look Dean in the eye, his beautiful, crystal blue eyes silently asking for Dean’s permission. Dean nodded vehemently.
“I understand,” said Cas. His hand still hadn’t left Dean’s shoulder.
“Just about how much I love you,” he replied. “Why, what are you thinking about?”
“Oh, your little boyfriend here?” the larger man taunted, strolling cockily in front of Dean, “He said your name was Dean Winchester, now wouldn’t that make you John Winchester’s boy? Naw, we’s gonna take the both of yous back to our camp and we’s gonna drain you, maybe make your daddy think twice next time he decides to roll up and kill half our people. We was gonna just follow him back and kill him, but,” he paused to let out a dry chuckle and brought his face close enough for Dean to smell his rancid breath, “I think this might just hurt even worse. And when he comes to find you, we’s gonna kill him and that little brother a’yours.”
Cas didn’t have time to respond, as the two of them were ripped away from each other.
Dean recognized the voice of the larger male vampire and anger surged in his stomach.
The smaller male vamp lunged at John, and both Sam and Dean took that as their cue to jump in.
“That was,” Dean breathed, “Perfect.”
“It’s been nearly a month. We should… talk about what you told me the day we met.” Cas’s words were slow and steady, bordering on hesitant.
“Sam!”
Paradise. Reunion. Where they could live. Where they could
John and Sam were seated at the kitchen table, but both jumped up in surprise at the sight of Dean breathing raggedly in the doorframe.
As soon as the twine on Cas’s wrists was cut, Cas threw himself forward into Dean’s arms.
“Sorry to interrupt such a touchin’ moment there, boys, but we got a little business with yous,” said the large male vamp with a drawling accent.
Dean’s love for that sound was beyond question, and beyond description.
“Cas, no!” Dean exclaimed sluggishly, trying to pull himself off the ground. His hands found the chain link fence and hoisted himself up. His head whipped around in both directions, looking for Cas and the vamps, but they were nowhere to be seen. They were gone.
“I thought I’d gotten them all. I’m sorry, son,” John said firmly. His voice was unwavering and didn’t sound the least bit apologetic or conciliatory, at least not to Dean, not that he expected it to. He was angry with his father. These vamps came after them because of John, they took Cas because John didn’t do his job well enough. He was angry with himself. The vamps took Cas because he wasn’t strong enough to protect him, or maybe if he hadn’t broken down, they could have made it to Cas’s house before the vamps attacked. Anger and accusation and guilt and blame swam around inside of his head.
“It’s raining,” Sam pointed out, gesturing to the window on the wall behind the couch.
Sam would be fine. He would be okay. He’d go out and grab the bull by its horns. He’d find a life for himself, or build one. He’d live long, die old, and he’d always keep fighting, just like he promised. And they’d see each other again.
“It’s okay. Dean, I’m okay,” Cas reassured.
“No, no, no, Cas, you couldn’t make me uncomfortable,” Dean reassured him, “I want to do...
Sam was still staring at him with a dumbfounded look. Finally, he spoke. “That’s Cas?” he asked.
“I love you so much, Castiel Novak. More than I ever thought I could love someone. Nothing can change that, and I never wanna be apart from you.”
Then the pain was gone. The fear was gone. The cold and the sharp and the raw taste of iron in his mouth was gone. (Was
“Hey, don’t question me Samantha!” Dean grunted, glaring at Sam with a stern expression from the rearview mirror. “If I am going to be stuck here at your ‘buddy’s’ house, forced to obey his rules and such without so much as a say in all of it in the long run, then I am going to live it up how I choose to!”
Obeying the witches call, the blood-red sigils that floated aimlessly in place around James’s body flew downward towards his feet at rapid speed. Embedding themselves one by one next into his flesh once they arrived, each blood-red sigil aligned itself accordingly to create a new pattern of symbols unlike any seen before. Finally, once the last of the blood-red sigils had relocated and amassed themselves to the soles of James’s feet, a bright flash of light was seen. After that, both the sigils and the collection of burning embers faded from view.
“No Cas,” Sam replied, smiling slightly. “It is so I can see an old college friend of mine—as well as so that we can have a minor vacation at the same time while I am visiting him too.”
Sam’s heart stopped.
“GIVE THEM BACK!” Dean ordered, before bolting after Abigail.
Still neither Dean, Castiel nor Sam dared to interrupt James. The three were too respectful and empathetic. They could relate to James’s plight far too well thanks to their own cumbersome and demanding past.
“No…” Castiel replied, bluntly.
Succeeding with his effort to wrestle the gun away from Dean, even though it was somewhat pointless now, Castiel swore under his breath. “Jesus, Dean…” Castiel grumbled, before confiscating Dean’s firearm, only then to quickly place it in his trench coat’s right pocket. “You are a piece of work.”
Ignoring the two hunters and their devoted angel companion, the three witches continued; undeterred by the boy’s chatter.
“Enough, Dean,” Castiel rebutted.
“Guess that means, I should help too.” Sam snickered.
“You see, I am the black sheep of the family.” James stammered. “Mainly due to the fact that I am Bisexual, eccentric by nature, and most of all, not really congenial in any proper way. And because I am socially awkward at the best of times, my pious, morally driven, hardworking middle class family views me as an embarrassment.”
“Alright!” Sam reluctantly said aloud, as he hid behind one of the master bedroom’s closed doors. “I’ll come out, but just hear me out first!”
“But that’s not the worse part.” Sam said. “Look.”
Ignoring the rabble, possible threat and all, the motorcyclist pulled whatever he was trying to fish out of his pocket and held it up high into the air before him.
Sam blinked twice, then looked about quickly before the two witches noticed his return to consciousness. To his right he saw his brother, Dean, who also was tied up and secured in place beside him by witchcraft. To his left he saw what looked like to be the beginning of a staircase leading down to a lower level of the house. Finally, when he viewed the entirety of the rest of the area around him, Sam soon realized that he was in what seemed to be a large loft—one that had probably been converted from an attic originally prior and rebuilt from the foundation up.
“The small driveway is just for my motorcycle.” The man said with a grin. “The garage I have is large enough to shelter your car, so I suggest you use that instead. But again, you gotta go back down another street until you wind up on the front of the house—somewhat—to reach the lower level and get into the garage.”
“And I you.” Sam replied.
Abigail snapped her fingers, and Sam Winchester was immediately smashed into the ground by an overwhelming spectral force. However, unlike the gravitational force that he had encountered prior that he knew the witch Kora controlled, the spectral force itself felt much different. It felt cold, heavy and concussive; as if he had just been hit by a stockpile of iron chains. Then, shortly after he hit the ground, Sam felt each of his limbs be pulled taut; preventing him from budging even the slightest inch. It was painful and yet at the same time, beyond unnerving—because it was not so much of a physical pain, much like any normal iron chain would inflict—but it was a harrowing experience that seemed to abrade both Sam’s very mind and soul. A sensation that was far too similar to one that Sam felt long ago and was forced to endure time and time again in his nightmares during the darkest of his sleepless nights. The very same sensation of the bindings used on Hell’s torture rack.
. But your presence here, still,
Getting up from where he sat, Sam walked over to where James was to comfort his friend as best he could. However, the very second Sam came near, James rebuffed his advance and grit his teeth. “But I don’t need pity, respect nor half-ass concern from anyone!” James huffed. “I never needed it before nor do I care what others think of me. I learned to survive on my own for the longest time and in the end that is all that matters. For I carry my own weight!”
“Cas…” Dean grunted, easing on gas petal the until the Impala came to an abrupt halt on the neighborhood street. “Cas?” Dean repeated, his heart beginning to beat faster and faster with each passing second. “Come on buddy, you gotta work with me here. You can’t just say, ‘somethin’ is wrong,’ den go dead quiet on me!”
“That is because James’s entire skeletal structure is warded by carved-in runes and hex symbols.” Kora huffed, slightly annoyed by Castiel’s comment. “A supposed Angel such as yourself should have been able to see that—regardless if he is graceless or not!”
“For Hell’s sake—it’s an expression Cas…” Dean huffed, expelling a loud puff of air as he glared forward in frustration. “I meant, tell me what you need to tell me. I can take whatever it is.”
Resuming onward with his examination, the next thing Sam noticed was a makeshift altar; one assumably meant for complex witchcraft. Behind that said altar, spread out on the large bed that stood behind it, laid James. And as James laid ever still, his shirt removed and his lower garments rolled up to expose the bear flesh beneath, Sam could see what seemed to be blood-red sigils painted all over his body.
The witches stepped backward momentarily, then they all leered towards the three Winchesters and smiled. “You can approach now…” The three sisters said in unison.
“Yes Dean, this is James.” Sam said, answering his brother’s question. “I was his roommate and classmate for the longest time before I met Jess. Then I moved out so I could stay with her.”
“What?” Dean sputtered. “Your Mojo acting up on you?”
“HEY,” Kora spat. "Stay where you are!”
“Still we are lucky he didn’t freak out when you did that! Let alone cast us out from his home.” Dean scoffed. “Most of the time when people learn you are an Angel and or see you overstep like that buddy, they tend to become alarmed.”
When compared to Sam, who in return was Six foot four and strongly built in form, the man in question stood at least six feet tall in height and was of a moderate, lean build. He had short auburn-brown colored hair and dark brown eyes. Other than that, the man had some freckles on his face that were subtly seen, and a very distinct voice that was both loud and clear—even though the man spoke normally in an average tone. Finally, the last thing that stood out when one looked upon the man, who looked slightly younger than he actually was in age, was a silver necklace with a figure of a howling wolf at the end of it around his neck. Other than that, he was a young male of about 30 years of age minimum.
“Don’t shoot the messenger dude!” Sam said, backing off slightly to gain some space. “All I was just saying was…”
As Fiona spoke, she cradled James’s head—whom in return was still unconscious—inward towards her body on her lap; holding him snuggly as he slept quietly. Currently she was sitting on the sofa down stairs directly set across from the Winchesters—who they themselves too were seated on the other corresponding set of furniture. As for the other two witches, Kora and Abigail, they were elsewhere. One was upstairs completing an unknown task away from the group, whereas the second had left prior for an unexplained reason. Regardless, despite Dean seemed reluctant to accept the apology, Castiel and Sam were more willing to; post explanation that is.
“Oh, do you mean that dark brown-eyed man with the wolf necklace I saw you talking to over the computer on a ‘Doom’ meeting?”
Answering his brother’s call without delay, Dean detached himself from the front door and ran towards the stairs. Climbing them as swiftly as he could, Dean darted to his brother’s side and grunted. “What is it Sammy?” Dean asked. “You hurt? Did you find James?”
“We hit a spell barrier!” Dean grunted. “And that means it was a hidden one we couldn’t see before.”
“Dean!” Dean heard Sam say urgently from upstairs. “Come quickly!”
“For Hell’s sake!” Both sisters spat, stamping their left foot down with rage. “
Abigail turned around and headed towards the garage, grumbling to herself as she walked under her breath. Time and time again her words almost became loud enough to be interpreted by those nearest her, but in the end the fragments of words uttered were too ambiguous in nature to be understood coherently. Nevertheless, though it seemed that Abigail was frustrated with her sister—for a scowl was ever present on her lovely face as she journeyed forth to accomplish her next task—Abigail did not dare challenge Fiona’s command. She knew much better to do so.
“He is not lying, Dean.” Castiel muttered. “I can sense how much hardship and pain he went through by just looking into his eyes—as well as the wavelength given off by his very soul.”
Confused, but also wounded by Dean’s statement, Castiel shuddered in place. “Wait, I never…” Castiel muttered, attempting to apologize for something he may have said. “I…”
“Don’t you dare contradict my sister,” Kora said with a loud hiss. “Obviously you are lying!” Kora pointed to the ceiling, the floor, and then to the walls around them all. “I have warded this house from top to bottom, as well as all of its foundations. And if anything suspicious enters or leaves this house, I am alerted! And you three qualify as highly suspicious! Especially since you are Hunters!”
“Dean be quiet,” Castiel ordered, before stifling Dean with his left hand. “The last thing we need is more enemies.”
That moment, both of the Winchester’s phones buzzed again simultaneously. Leering down together at the same time, both brothers read their text as best they could.
“That wasn’t the aura I was referring to, my dear.” Castiel cooed, ever calm and patiently. “Indeed I can sense and see that James here has the same type of warding I once forged into Sam’s and Dean’s own bodies to protect them from other angels and demons in the past—yet when I compare the two—James’s warding is far much stronger and more uniquely personalized through other enhancements. Some runic, magical, angelic, hex-like and other… Nonetheless, again, that is not what I am sensing.”
“Dean,” Castiel replied softly, his eyes narrowing briefly for a moment or two to glare at Dean with bemusement. “It has only been forty-five minutes since Sam took over driving.”
Standing at the top of the stairs was another African American witch—whom, like the other witches before her, beared a dark-copper tint of skin and black curly hair—and the Winchesters most beloved and trusted angel, Castiel.
“I don’t care, Dean!” Castiel spat. “You need your rest! Also, again, it is Sam’s turn to drive—and thus by your own rules set in place by you prior, since this is your car and all—he gets to pick the music!”
Fiona shot a quick glare at Kora, which in return silenced her quickly, but she did not intervene. Rather than chastise Kora for using her magic on Dean cruelly, Fiona instead remained quiet, offering a subtle warning with nothing more than the narrowing of her stern, brown eyes.
Immediately, Dean’s eyes widened and his mood shifted back towards frustration.
“Crap,” Sam muttered. “It must be urgent.”
Following Dean’s outburst, the motorcyclist uncrossed his arms and leapt onto his feet. After that, the man walked slowly around the impala until he reached the driver’s side window; his arms resting close against the sides of his body. Then, once the rider ceased moving, he reached into his right pocket and began to search for something.
“Ya yah, Samantha! We get it, you have feelings… And you feel like you neglected your friend and so on.” Dean grumbled. “But I still don’t see why we gotta drive all the way to California to visit him when you could have just did another Zoom meeting and called it even!”
“Well, first off,” Castiel continued, his eyes fixated on Dean’s chest. “This is a sober house—so there will be no alcohol here during the duration of our chosen stay.”
“Because Hun, unless those two Hunters are as dumb as they look—especially the grunt you seem so enamored with—I suggest you back up and return to my side.” Fiona said, before swiftly reaching into her pocket to retrieve something. “Elsewise, you risk them possibly killing you out of fear.”
“Thank you dear,” Fiona smiled. “Just try not to get hurt around your trigger-happy boyfriend.”
Step. Step. Step. Soon, both brothers could start to see a shadow of an approaching figure around the corner of the distant hallway.
“For Hell’s sake Sammy!” Dean growled, pushing Castiel’s hand away from his mouth so he could talk. “Stop beating around the bush and just throw down already if he refuses to answer!”
"He came into my store with his niece and nephew and bought some books, he said his name was Dean… I didn’t know..."
“Forgive me, I said - It does smell nice.”
Dean makes him heal Sam first.
been.
Dean is surrounded by nothingness. It’s pitch black, rolling and eternal, as far as he can see. Or, well, can’t see. It’s hard to tell if his eyes are open or closed. He feels kind of shaky, but pushes it down, pushes down the dread pooling in his stomach, and calls out.
“Dean, please answer me. I’m worried about you.”
Dean throws the paperback across the room, and seriously contemplates whether or not to set it on fire. It’s cursed, that’s no doubt, but he hadn’t expected it to be
Well, now Dean knows what happens when he thinks about something he’s not supposed to hard enough for someone to notice.
“It just made things worse?”
The title for this chapter is lyrics from 'Everything is Awful' by The Taxpayers. The entire band rocks so I recommend you give them a listen.
Dean stumbles through the door, jerks his hand from Cas’, and pinwheels his arms to stay on his feet. Luckily, he manages to avoid crashing to the floor, and has just regained his footing by the time Cas crashes into the bunker, and Dean’s chest in an entirely uncoordinated way. Dean grabs Cas under the arms before he can topple to the ground completely, and pulls him into a standing position.
Jack’s dad, and there’s nothing that Dean can do to change that, so of course Jack cares about him, and of course it had hurt when Jack had watched Dean get impaled.
Sam hasn’t changed much in the grand scheme of things. Yeah, he’s a bit more powerful and he can heal things with a flick of his wrist, but he still hunts, helps other hunters where he can, and seems generally the same. People aren’t scared of him. Not the way they are of Dean. They don’t flinch when he raises his voice, or duck out of the room when he shuffles into the kitchen to get some coffee that will have no effect on his body. They don’t mutter things about him when they think he can’t hear (‘always knew that Winchester boy was weird’), or say those words to his face when they’re brave (or stupid) enough.
“I don’t know,” Sam says. He’s sitting opposite of Dean, and his legs are bunched in an uncomfortable-looking fashion so that Dean has enough space to be laying the way he had been until a couple moments ago. “I asked you about the road,” he gestures at the now more-than-wide-enough road they’re driving down. “You were kind of spaced out, and then your head snapped back and you——you——I don’t know if you died, or...” Sam trails off, pale and small-sounding. “There was so much blood. It was everywhere.”
Dean takes a deep breath. Do or die. “I’m——“
The other side of the bed is cold when Dean wakes up. He blinks in confusion, and pushes himself into a sitting position. The blanket on top of his pools around his legs, and he kicks it off so that he can stand.
It was
“So you are telling me this wannabe biker dude is your old roommate from college?” Dean grunted, before sticking his head forward to glare at Sam from the front seat. “Cause I damn don’t remember him at all.”
Sam did not answer. Instead he just showed his brother the next few texts he had received from Castiel just a few seconds ago. They were the following:
“Indeed,” Castiel said sweetly. “Also, Miss Fiona, the three of us were invited here by young James as his guest for this upcoming week.”
“True,” Sam replied. “But at least we now know Cas is able to communicate with us—somehow and someway—and he is ok too.”
“I won’t ask again!” The witch said. “Show yourself—NOW!”
“The Hell?” Dean muttered. “Now mine too?” Ignoring his phone, Dean pushed himself past Sam and began his own inspection of Castiel. “Screw it, I’ll answer them later.”
“There are many things you still don’t know about me Dean.” Castiel replied, unvexed. “There are still countless secrets I have yet chosen to share with you or Sam. But yes—I can see the fate of one’s soul by looking into their eyes. I am an Angel after all.”
“Yes, Ma’am!” Abigail replied, sounding somewhat exhilarated. “I tweaked all the warding in the house and added the Angel’s signature to the spellwork formula as you requested. Now he should only feel dampened effects from the Hex-Barrier, as well as from all other hexes we place throughout the area.”
“What’s the difference?” Castiel muttered. “They are the same thing!”
“Barrier?” Dean asked.
“{aRr!er.”
“According to our allies at the supermarket and throughout the town, these Hunters were seen using James’s own funds to buy supplies for themselves! They even talked about hunting our own and using James’s house as a base!”
So far so good. Sammy’s at the steps without being spotted. Now for my turn.
“First off, I’m not going to try and even say that aloud…” Dean replied. “Two: What the Hell is that supposed to mean anyway?”
“Cas!” Dean said, shifting the Impala fully into park before thrusting himself to grasp Castiel. “Cas! Speak to me!”
It was a text from Castiel. One that was not only recent, but it looked like it was written in a panic too.
“SEAL!” The three witches bellowed.
“Poor choice of words, Hun…” Kora replied. “But, as you wish.” The witch simply waved her hand, and her spell came undone. “Who am I to deny you…”
“That’s right,” Dean grunted. “Check the Wolf’s phone. Heck, check Sam’s phone too!”
“Please,” Sam pleaded, as he felt the bindings around his throat begin to tighten. “STOP!”
Before Castiel could even reply, the eldest witch spoke for him. “Ignore him!” The witch said, focusing intently on Kora. “
“Are we there yet, Sam?” Dean groaned, before rolling his eyes in protest from the back seat of the impala. “I’m dying back here!”
“Cas is an all knowing, powerful celestial being who has survived worse than just being petrified in place!” Sam snapped. “But James is human, like us. And if these witches are the same ones that are taking out Seasoned Hunters with ease—then James doesn’t stand a chance! Especially if he is the one they are hunting!”
That moment, Dean came to.
Ignoring his brother, Sam sighed loudly. “But that wouldn’t make any sense—you are not dead nor should you be suffering from a neurological disorder…”
Castiel pointed at James’s feet with his index finger. “Just look for yourself.”
with a twist of his head. “She helped me,” Castiel replied. “Just as she is here to help James as well.”
“I don’t get the reference, Dean.” Castiel muttered, his face still cupped in his hand.
“You are a Lone Wolf by nature—but not by choice.” Castiel said with a blunt tone.
“Honestly Dean, I doubt he can even hide a large knife in his front pant’s pocket, let alone a gun.” Castiel sighed. “Cool your jets and allow your brother to handle it.”
Dean raised his weapon and stepped forward a few steps and paused.
From left to right, each individual Winchester expressed a different facial expression to match the befuddlement they were silently feeling. Sam’s expression was a mixture of slight embarrassment and dumbfoundment—for his eyes were wide, and the arteries on his upper neck pulsed visibly, indicating a sudden rise in heart rate. As for Castiel, the blue-eyed angel just tilted his head to the left, expressing the same confused expression he would normally display if he failed to grasp the reference or relevance of the conversing subject. Finally, Dean was caught off guard, for his facial expression mimicked someone who was either currently lost in thought, or analyzing the current topic too literally for their own good. In the end, a spry and subtle smirk crossed the elder Winchester’s face, before it vanished so quickly, that it seemed that Dean was surprised that he himself even enjoyed the idea of being compared to an escort.
“So he is like Garth—so to speak…” Dean mumbled. “Great… Would be easier to deal with him if I had a beer to calm my nerves, but sure, let’s see how he differs…”
“Hey, I’m not stubborn—Cas!” Dean rebutted. “I’m just highly motivated by my passions not to give up—that is all! As for hypervigilant—maybe… But then again I have to be for you two’s sake. Otherwise you two lovable misfits would be long dead like the ancient dodo.”
Following a few moments after Abigail spoke, a haunting, but benevolent purple hue shined out from within her clasped hands. As it shined, softly illuminating the very air between Castiel and herself, a powerful pulse of energy shot outward. Crackling like bolts of electricity as it surged through the atmosphere of the room unchecked, the pulse of energy launched itself in all directions; only then to instantly bounce off whatever it collided with—be it living or not—and surge back towards Abigail’s clenched hands at high speeds. Repeating this process three times before abating from both sight and sound, the pulse of energy faded and the light that shined from within Abigail’s clenched hands did too along with it. After that, everything fell still once more. Abigail’s spellwork was complete.
Sam’s phone buzzed loudly, which in return caused Sam to instantly answer it. Pulling it out swiftly, for he knew already who the text was from, Sam read the message.
James just sighed. “I didn’t steal them, if that is what you are assuming.” James replied. Gesturing to Sam silently with his head next, James narrowed his eyes. “They were donated to me, along with most of my other wardrobe by Sam.”
Pushing his brother aside so that he could examine Castiel without hinderance, Sam lurched himself forward and sighed. “Give Castiel a chance to recover before you go shaking him.” Sam said. “I’m just as worried as you.”
” Fiona said, swearing under her breath. “Blue-eyes is right…” The eldest witch hissed. “The curse still remains. All we did was dampen it.”
“Here we go!” Both brothers muttered.
Suddenly a sweltering heat shot up from the base of Sam’s spine, then surge rapidly throughout every bone of his body, inspiring an unbearable pain to surface within seconds. Following that said pain, his mind was overtaken by a chilling fog—one that numbed every neuron from firing and shattered every single thought like a rock striking a thin sheet of glass. Finally, when Sam couldn’t speak, see or hear—for his senses were rendered mute, Sam felt his very soul begin to be stabbed—perforated by what seemed to feel like thousands upon thousands of jagged rods—over and over again; repeatedly.
“Very well, Dean.” Sam sighed. “But remember this: If James finds you drunk as a skunk in whatever room he grants you, or sees you acting strange because you are drinking too much, he will most likely preform whatever nursing protocol he was trained to do on you firsthand. Such as pumping your stomach and placing you on Disulfiram thereafter!”
“Well, at least I know you can drive,” Dean scoffed from the back seat. “Still, I think you’re not finished Sammy. Baby is still half way in the street—and I’ll be damned if I allow her to be scratched by these crazy California drivers!”
“Son of a bitch…” Dean grumbled, his mind fogged and his body aching with pain. “Gonna kill dem damn witches when I get my hands on ‘em!”
“Come out, come out, Hunter!” The witch said. “Or I’ll kill your friend right here and now!”
At that moment, both brothers heard the supposed witch outside reach the front door. Attempting to reenter the house again thereafter, despite she soon found it to be futile, a loud racket began to surface; which in return alerted all others possibly still in the house that the brothers did not know of presently that something was amiss.
. Castiel’s very own angelic grace.
“Oh,” Castiel replied, smiling slightly. “That makes more sense.”
…” Dean grumbled, repeating Castiel’s last word impatiently again.
, who you know, Sis, was expecting an update!”
“There is a big difference Cas!” Dean rebutted.
“I swear Sammy, if the next song is ‘My Heart Will Go On,’ I will die right here and now from a self inflicted stroke or something.” Dean growled. “But not before I smash dat worthless hybrid DVD/CD you ‘had to have’ for your birthday to smithereens!”
“On the behalf of all—my sisters, myself and for James—I am sorry for the mishap earlier that led to an unneeded spat.” Fiona said sweetly, as she stroked James’s head softly with her right hand. “We all are very protective of James. And once our wards were set off, alerting us of intruders—as well as the sighting of you three in town by our fellow allies—we were believed to think the worst.”
Dean let out a low scoff, slightly bemused by the statement. “Didn’t know your friend was related to ‘Bigfoot,’ Sammy…” Dean muttered. “Anyway, they are going back towards the personal gym area I saw you eyeing earlier. Let’s follow them, and see if we can find any more clues.”
. He is a Winchester too.”
“{aRr!er.”   &    “^e #it @ {aRr!er.”
“I’m making a scene?” Dean rebutted, attempting to grapple his gun back from Castiel. “Look whose talking! And give me back my gun!”
“Excuse me,” Abigail asked. “What are you talking about?”
“Good afternoon, Mr. Ridley…” Fiona cooed calmly, attempting not to smile nor sound peeved as she spoke. “I assume now is a good time for you to catch me up on what is going on?”
Sam pointed down towards the ground. Baffled, Dean then sneered. “Crap…” Dean muttered.
Then, after what seemed like would be the start of an eternity of torment, something intervened. A single voice, despite all odds or reason, that was able to quell the chaos and return order to the dire situation.
“Cause those were great songs!” Dean said, blushing slightly, but otherwise trying to remain stoic. “And you have a good taste in music—unlike Sam here!”
were supposed to be on lookout!”
Alarmed, Castiel twisted himself around to stop Dean before he could draw his weapon on the man. Seizing ahold of Dean’s arm with his main hand, Castiel began to wrestle with his best friend. “Dean, no!” Castiel said. “Stand down! You are making a scene!”
“Drive!” Sam ordered, raising his voice almost to a bellow. “NOW!”
Before Dean could even react, Sam watched in horror as he saw his brother be pulled away by the same strange, gravitational force that had ensnared them before. Choosing this time to thrash Dean against the ceiling and back onto the ground repeatedly until he himself was struck unconscious, the gravitational force separated the two Winchesters; leaving Sam to fend for himself.
“Damn it Cas, I said LET GO!” Dean grunted. “He’s got a—” Blinking twice to confirm what he saw before continuing, Dean narrowed his eyes and sneered. “A—”
Following repeating the chant again, the blood-red sigils rose up from James’s flesh, then swiftly began to rotate around his body. Picking up speed as they orbited around him endlessly in unison, the blood-red sigils slowly altered their color one by one until over fifty different types were seen. Then finally, once thirty-seconds had passed and the witches had shifted their prayer-like motion to that of a new hand formation that created a triangle by using both hands with the palms of them facing downward, the blood-red sigils ceased their thrumming and fell still.
“It is already bad enough that we had to put up a magical barrier to keep all supernatural creatures out—including our allies as well… But now, we have Hunters in our midst?”
From the eldest Obi sister’s palm shot forth a bolt of violet-blue lightning. Striking James with the strength of a mild form of an electric shock, which caused him to jolt almost instantly upon contact, James was forcefully awoken from his unconscious slumber. Convulsing onto the ground thereafter as he slowly came to, James twisted his head to his side and looked up to see what was possibly going on. And to his surprise, despite he was still in a daze and fatigued, James soon realized that he was in deep trouble.
Following Fiona’s comment, both Abigail and Kora maneuvered around the bed and relocated themselves behind their sister. When they did, they too soon swore their own way under their breath.
“Yes Dean, it is.” Sam answered. “You and I both didn’t need our old clothes when we out grew them! Also, there was no point in holding onto them anyway because others, such as James, could use them.”
“More gibberish,” Dean muttered.
“Now please do as you are told Hun, or I can’t guarantee your safety.” Fiona continued. “To be honest, I have no idea how you are still able to function in this barrier so well. You should be dead!”
“This place is warded.” Sam interrupted. “Which leaves, ‘I sense, ‘something,’ nearby,’ and ‘James-I-Crossfire.’”
“Two, Sam asked me to warn you ahead of time that James is eccentric and unorthodox.” Castiel said, laughing under his breathe despite the fact that he did not know what those two words meant when they were used to describe one’s personality.
“James-I-crossfire?” Dean said, narrowing his eyes. “Your friend’s last name is ‘Crossfire?’”
“Is something wrong?” Castiel asked, before glazing back onto Dean for a fleeting moment to see if he was still alright. “Is he hurt or require aid from us?”
“So for now, before we elaborate more on what happened—please allow me to exchange overdue pleasantries.” Fiona said with a faint smile. Pulling in her other arm in next to form the gesture of bowing, the witch lowered her head to show respect. “
I need you! You said you loved me! You said I was beautiful!
“Yes, he does look rather proud of himself doesn’t he…”
"You alright man, you look like you've been..." Began Charlie.
"He was the doctor who fixed Charlie's mangled nose, you know the night Bal was a shithead," Said Meg watching Castiel and Benny talking to for a moment before declaring "Back in a min, off to the little girl's room"
Castiel took a step forward now too, his own voice lowering as he confessed, "I wanted it to be you too, Dean."
"Hello?" he called into the house from the hallway, however, no reply came as Lisa wasn't home yet. He walked through their house and dumped his briefcase and long suit coat on the sofa, loosening his tie from around his neck as he looked around the pristine living room. It was Lisa's house really, Dean had only moved in a year ago, selling his apartment a few weeks later. He walked into the study and opened his laptop, settling himself down in his chair as it loaded. He rubbed his tired eyes in his hands, wondering if there was any way he could get out of going out tonight.
"So listen, Benny..." Began Castiel
Luke catches the expression on Castiel's face and turns back to Dean, with a sneer, "You're full of shit, he didn't say no..."
Long story short, Castiel had now agreed to go and join the man on a hunt, just the two of them, alone.
He wipes his hand over his face, flicking away the tears of loneliness, his eyes fall on to the framed photo of Dean on the mantel. Sniffing he wipes his face again, smiling back sadly at his husbands image. A picture from their honeymoon, Dean looking so tanned and handsome. The exotic sun beaming down on him not giving off anywhere near as much light and warmth as Dean’s own beaming smile.
“No shame… Just hanging out with his wang out.”
“Do you think, when Jack brought everyone back, that monsters and ghosts would all have come back too?” asked Sam, out of nowhere.
Gabriel, walks behind Victor and John as they enter the Winchester farm. He doesn’t need front row seats to this show, he already knows what they are going to find. Well, not the finer details perhaps but certainly the general scene.
The angel’s steely attention solely focused on him made Dean’s heart hammer loudly and attempt to jump out of his throat. He could understand why people fled when those frosty blue eyes focused on them with that much intensity.
Every time he thought about telling Castiel the truth, his gut churned. After everything, he really didn’t want to lose him… but the longer this went on, the more the chance of that increased. Why was he so terrified?
Do not fucking test me right now, Winchester.
"I'm leaving," Castiel’s gravelly voice said, sending shivers of dread through Dean’s whole body.  Against his will, Dean looked up. He hadn’t known what to say and to ignore Castiel wouldn’t be fair but there were those big blue eyes looking down at him, almost sadly.
Charlie stood up and held Castiel's arm "Of course hon, whatever you need"
When they reached Castiel's room, Dean finally released his hand and began undoing the buttons on his pants, he kicked his shoes off and against the wall and slid his pants down over his legs, stepping out of them, in nothing now but grey boxers and socks.
But as his lips pressed into Dean's flesh kissing and nipping, his friend didn't pull away, he groaned again, he liked it... Castiel swirled his tongue over Dean's neck, nipping lightly as he rolled up to meet Dean's push down. He heard the pleased sigh vibrate out of Dean like a purr.
flirt. =)
Suddenly, Sam is there and he is shouting, grabbing Castiel’s hand and pulling him up. He tugs him along with him down the cave towards the light in the distance. A growling creature rushes at Sam from the shadows, shoving him forcefully away from Castiel.
"When are you going to tell him?" Charlie had a hundred questions, she couldn't work out which to ask first, this was nuts. Dean was 'win67'... And Castiel had no idea.
After a nice meal in a ‘not-to-fancy’ restaurant. Castiel and Dean take a walk through the streets together.
“Mon amour. Mon amour!!!!! Mon amour!!”
Castiel’s eyes wandered over the scene, moving back up the road from where Sam’s car had crashed, there were more paramedics, gathered around something on the road. Castiel crept through the tree line, keeping out of sight.
"Right!" said John, smiling proudly.
“You!!”
Dean wakes up to a hand over his mouth and piercing blue eyes staring down at him. Castiel raises a finger to his lips, “Shhh. I’m here Dean. I’m here.”
"I don't know, he was just passing, I guess... Here's our cab," Said Castiel as a black cab pulled up next to them. They both got into the back and the cab pulled away.
The weight on top of him stills and single fingernail draws a tingling line down from his chin to his jugular.
Dean laughs “Absolutely not”
Dean smiles, “I think he’ll be just fine, he’s God now but he’s still got us, and Cas.” Dean’s eyes travel over to where Castiel is talking to Garth. It still feels like a dream that Castiel is back and Dean’s heart thumps in his chest as Castiel catches his eye and smiles at him.
"No, right on time. Come this way and I will get your name badge for you and show you what you will be doing. Dean mentioned you were a 'storybook lady'? Would you like to do that here? It's not something we have done before but I have heard good things from my kids about you, I think they would be pretty upset with me if we hired the storybook lady and didn't have story time" He chuckled and Charlie smiled.
"I'm sorry, it's just you sitting there in a cow print onesie with what looks like a cow pat smeared all over your face." he laughed.
Charlie and Garth stared at him, "Er, no dude. Why?" asked Garth.
"Holy fuck," groaned out Dean.
His smile vanished however as he read the sentence
“It’s just so… stupid. After everything we went through, he survived that car wreck… Just to fall down the stairs? I know this is going to sound absolutely fucking stupid… but it’s not fair. I miss him. I feel like… it’s me, ya know? I’m fucking cursed.”
"No, I was just watching crap tv and about to order food." she replied, "Why? You ok?"
“I’m going to ask you ten questions. You will answer them clearly and correctly. Failure to do so will result in punishment. You must answer all ten questions in a row, for this to end. Do you understand?”
Looking between Luke and Dean, Castiel frowned, he really hadn't said 'no'.
His brain feels fuzzy, his eyes feel warm and oddly dry so he blinks several times. His fingers twitch on the bed, he gently curls his toes, his eyes move around the room, taking things in. He can tell that he is in hospital, his body is stiff, and there is a tube going into his nose and down his throat. Dean touches the tubing with his tongue, it’s uncomfortable and he grunts as his tongue pokes it against his throat.
"Mom caught John watching some show the other night, Dad had fallen asleep on the couch watching this zombie show and John woke up and went into the living room. Mom went mad," she giggled before adding, "Dad was in trouble."
"You know.. I think you should come out" She said as they walked into a little cafe at lunchtime.
“Balthazar being aggressive, this isn’t exactly new information Dean… He broke one of your ribs”
Castiel looked at him, not knowing what to say so Dean continued
“S’not your fault,” Said Dean “I just don’t know what I’m going to do, I can’t move into my new place for almost a week…”
"Bye." he hears Balthazar reply before hearing the front door shut
"Bacon," he said smiling and nodding, "Oh yeah - cooked it at home, hopefully, it'll still be warm. Bacon on bagels - oh this is gonna be awesome. This breakfast has been Garthed!"
“How can you serve this to people? It tastes like shit, and I would know…”
(See the end of the chapter for
"Dude, please tell me you didn't invite me on a first date?"
Castiel grinned, that was more like it, he decided not to interrupt Dean, so he said nothing.
Dean doesn’t want to ruin the moment, but watching Castiel fumble with shaking hands at his belt and zipper was just a little too comical and he huffed a laugh under his breath.The angel must’ve sensed it however, and his eyes lifted slightly to meet Dean’s and then narrowed. Dean gasped at the sudden cool breeze on his lower half, mentally cursing Castiel for using what little grace he had left to remove his jeans and boxers.
That night Castiel had left Dean in the bedroom, untouched. He had turned the lights off and closed the door, without so much as a single word to him since breakfast. The next morning, Castiel entered the bedroom to find that Dean was already awake. Dean looked up when Castiel came in, waiting for the usual ‘Good morning beautiful’ that Castiel had been greeting him with. Dean had thought it pretty creepy and all to familiar but now he found himself staring at Castiel as he brought his breakfast tray over and willing him to say it in his mind but Castiel simply untied the ropes and let Dean eat, only glancing at him out of the corner of his eyes every now and then. He led Dean to the bathroom and turned the shower on, Dean showered quickly, aware that Castiel was watching him in silence and then he dried off and returned to the bed.
“Ah… Not yet. I actually…” Dean paused thinking back to the message he'd received earlier “I’m going to nip back out in a bit, got to deliver something to a friend. But I thought I’d come a bit early and see the kids for a bit? Get them out yours and more importantly Sam’s hair for an hour or so”
Dean began scanning the room again, searching the crowd for Castiel... He couldn't see him anywhere... Finally giving up he turned back around to order his drink... That's when he realized. Castiel was stood right next to him but hadn't recognized him in the helmet and get up. Dean looked at him, thinking... 'Holy fuck he looks hot'
“All this time and you never said anything.” says Castiel, “It’s like you're only doing this now… because someone else wants me.” And just like that, Dean felt everything stop. Like he had been hit by an 18 wheeler. Like that bubble of warmth and hope inside him had suddenly been buried beneath an avalanche. What could he say? He couldn’t even tell Castiel that he was wrong, not really - he’d always wanted more with his angel but it was true, wasn’t it, that he’d only acted when he thought he might lose him?
"Thanks, seems alright so far." said Dean, glancing out the window and noticing the orange treetops, he realized he hadn't checked his messages since last night.
Dean blinks at Castiel, “What is this?”
"Are you sure you still want to go out tonight?" Asked Garth as he set the last box on top of the pile near the door.
"No. Confusing," said Castiel thoughtfully.
“We’ll see…” Said Dean
You clearly love sucking dick… I’m a dick… We are going to get along magically, no?
"Don't order anything, I have a huge pile of take out here if you want to join me? Balthazar is working late and I already bought this, girls night?" he added trying to sound as though his boyfriend suddenly agreeing to work late was not bothering him at all.
Now it was Meg's turn to snort "The only one who looks like a fool here Cas, is him. Come on, get up our cab will be here any minute. You’re better off without that shithead, okay? It’s gonna be alright"
I should have put socks on after my shower...
"Balthazar. Are you alright?" Said Castiel looking at him worriedly.
He’d told himself,
"Food and drinks are in the kitchen, help yourself to anything you would like - and Charlie, thank you for coming round. I was feeling a bit crap about Balthazar working late, again."
Dean’s eyes lift from the trolley to Balthazar’s face as he steps up in front of him, careful to avoid Dean’s puddle of sick on the floor… Balthazar has the scalpel in his hand and Dean swallows. He feels his toes twitching, moving, waking up. His hands curl into fists. His teeth clench, locking his jaw tight, Balthazar is leaning forwards right into his space… Dean can feel the mans breath ghost over his face, the scalpel closing in towards his face…
He walked into the door… That’s kind of adorable. Don’t mention it though. Don’t let him know you saw him. He is probably just as nervous as you… Right? His heart is probably hammering in his chest too…
“Yeah, well. I’m awesome, what can I say?” Smiled Dean
Garth nodded "Yeah Cas, I'm free, although.. could I invite Jo?"
“Hello Dean”
“Firstly, as long as there's a breath left in my body I will always come for you.”
Balthazar nodded before walking away to the kitchen, Charlie stuck her tongue out at him when his back was turned.
Lisa seemed to recover herself in time to add, "We haven't talked about that." to the person who asked the question, sensing the 'awkward' in the air, that person had moved away. Dean, noting the lack of the word 'yet' at the end of her sentence, relaxed, at least she wasn't expecting him to propose. If anything... they seemed to be headed in the same direction, they both wanted out, they just didn't want to hurt each other and didn't know how to approach the subject. Lisa caught Dean's eye
"Good, that's good, because I want you to be mine. I don't want anyone else touching you, you're too beautiful to be pawed at by different men all the time... I don't want to share" Castiel jacked Dean a little harder, pressing his front against his ass again so Dean could feel how much the man wanted him.
Have yourself a merry little Christmas Jensen Ackles
He smiled at her, "I slept fine. You?"
"What?" He asked her
He was jerked from his miserable thoughts when Dean suddenly blocked his path with his body. He frowned. The two of them did an awkward two step shuffle until Castiel managed to maneuver himself around the hunter.
Dean tried not to picture Castiel in the bath… He tried.
Charlie sighed and walked up to Garth putting a comforting arm around his shoulders "Forget about that.. Have you been eating Garth? Cas is right - you look dead on your feet"
“Dean…” He gasps “I want to…”
Castiel frowned and tilted his head, “I thought I was a ‘monster’? Why would you want to talk to me?”
"We only have the sitter for a few hours, we need to go to Jess's parent's party, sorry dude"
The man looked at Dean, loaded down with all his bags, "If you want you can leave some of your shopping on that free table by the back room? Might make browsing easier."
Dean couldn't stop himself before asking "A friend?"
"We were just talking - seems we both have had run-ins with people we dislike recently and he said he was feeling a bit shitty about it and I said I was too and he put that he could use a drink, and I said I didn’t see myself drinking for a while, jokingly and he just said, so I guess seeing if you wanted to meet up for a drink and a chat in person is a bad idea right now then?"
Castiel 'tutted' at her before opening the message.
“We made it,”
Recovering from his shock quickly, John glared back at Gabriel defiantly, “Where the fuck is my son?”
He and 'Win67' had been messaging for a few weeks now. Never anything personal, or crude. It had started when 'Win67', whose profile picture was a cartoon of a devil had popped up in Castiel's inbox, whose picture is a cartoon angel, had sent a cheeky message asking "I wonder if opposites really do attract?"
Weeks of secret planning. Learning the song. Making new friends. Picking out the perfect outfit. It was finally, show time...
"He called you a prick," Said Lisa angrily, her eyes still on Balthazar’s back.
"I reckon maybe he's on to something there"  Smiles Dean turning to face Castiel...
“Dean,” says Castiel again, now that he has Dean’s attention, “I’m not leaving you, I’m not going anywhere…”
"He was shooting zombies all morning on Saturday" Smiled Dean “He’s a regular Rick Grimes”
"Well Dean told me to let you sort that out, he said you knew what you were doing, you have a budget of three hundred dollars to go and get a seat for yourself and some cushions or whatever and there is a corner being cleared near the kid's section for you to set up. That's what you'll be doing today, setting that up, that OK?"
Dean could hear his heart pounding in his chest, his blood rushing in his ears. He couldn’t believe he actually did it! He finally acted, squashing his fears as he tilted his head to one side, praising Castiel with his kiss.
“No!” says Dean, “I want to go home!”
"Alright, pack up the bacon before I do start getting fat," said Castiel chuckling, feeling reassured by his friends, "Let's get to work."
"What did you do to your shoulder, you have a bruise?"
Dean's words rang out in his mind, stabbing at his heart like knives
Castiel smiles innocently up at Dean, "I don't know what you mean."
It had been biblical.
Ignoring his doubts he reverses out of the parking space but he can’t bring himself to go back yet, he can’t face Dean yet. He drives across the street, parking outside of Balthazar’s bar, The Lower Angel. He heads into the bar, so distracted by worries that Dean would find out what he’d done that he doesn’t notice the tall man standing at the bar, he doesn’t hear him speaking to the waitress Meg, he doesn’t even recognize the address she gives him as his own… Well, it isn’t really. It’s Balthazar’s house.
