The engine spluttered and choked, bouncing unsteadily on the wide expanse of concrete road. The old girl needed to rest real soon and Steve hoped he could make it in time to a local petrol station. With the sun beating down on the earth, he could see the burn on the road and the leather seat was starting to make a very uncomfortable ride.
Tony’s voice muffled with pain as Thanos’ palm clamped over his mouth – those lips that he spent kissing the whole of yesterday night – while he dug the shard deep into his ribcage.
Older. More tired. Much like he saw too much and lived too long on this world. Well, he did actually.
Rushing, he threw himself against the wall, willing himself to stay completely still as he turned the doorknob in one swift moment before tactfully maneuvering the body in front of him as he shut the door. Pinning the figure down by the wall, he tore down the leather hood soaked wet from the rain that must’ve come down during the night.
And now there was this problem of him accidentally incurring a blonde jock hot on his tail. Tony knew of his magnetic charisma but
Picking up his duffel bag, he heaved his way out of the tower – but not before turning around on his heels and grasping a grey tie for keepsake.
Clint was setting an arrow on its bow, pulling the strings taught and posed in a situation where he would need to release it.
And then he trailed off past the station back to his truck, rolling and unrolling the cigarette papers like he just did things for fun.
So, it was over. They won. He should know this because right after whatever happened, he was met with the weary sighs of his team, pain, grief, and yet a hint of relief and hope that maybe this would be the last war ever.
Tony that he kissed and held through all those years, back in the Tower, when sunlight would shine through and they would cuddle until late afternoon on a Sunday. Tony that he fought and argued with about anyone and anything. The Tony that Steve would carry back to their bedroom after long consecutive hours of seeing his lover tire himself out in the lab. Tony that he smashed his shield against and watched as the arc reactor flickered shut, along with his heart and soul that they both once pledged to each other. Tony that he missed after so many years after Siberia, how he clutched his own body tight at night, rocking back and forth to quell his sobs because he missed him so fucking much. Tony that he saw after all those years when the call was finally made but it was made by Bruce and Steve was just happy he got to see him at least once more in his lifetime. The Tony that he spilled the entirety of his being into the night they made love before the battle. Tony that he saw got ripped away from him and how Steve was no longer the same after that. Steve often liked to think of himself like a cat - having nine lives and all, each one dying and the next having cruelly thrust him to move on. And Steve did try to move on, move on from a life without Tony, move to another world - a remote one, where he could live off his days in something less than perfect but bearable.
Tony tilting his head to the side to look at Steve one last time as a teardrop slipped its way done the slope of his olive nose.
The stubborn, headstrong persona he was used to was watered down to something more quiet, sad. Those ocean blue eyes glimmered a dark navy, carrying that familiarity - like your favourite old blue coat nuzzled in the back of your closet that smells like coming home.
His eyes twinkled like the stars of this other new-wordly constellation - glistening, like he seen all the tears and pain and was buried underneath it all - rotting like a corpse would when they deterioriate under flesh-eating worms on this barren wasteland.
Steve lay idly by, his body heaving with difficulty breathing and it awfully reminded him of that Brooklyn boy centuries ago. The crumby ground dug into his scratched uniform and the smell of ash and fire burned his throat, nostrils, singed the edges of his gold hair until they were a musky brown. Eyes watering, he winced as he felt a sharp jab in his right leg. A gash opened its gaping wound up at him as the flesh around the edges burnt an ugly black.
Yet, they never failed to swim with a sort of familiarity - of hot mugs of coffee in the early chilled mornings, bedsheets warm and cozy or the soft glow of yellow from dancing in the kitchen on late-night Saturdays or even the shine of the arc reactor that demanded from life something grander, brighter and more magnificent than the ordinary of Steve Rogers.
He made his way over to the bed, gently placing his shaking form onto the soft white sheets, clutching his chest as he felt the rapid beating of anxiety and nervous shock.
. Yet, as he turned over to instinctively grab his shield, he only felt the absence of it, cursing under his breath, that maybe this was the time he needed it now more than ever – when he was sleep deprived, starving and just in no way to be in even a functioning state of mind.
“I’ve actually been hijacking any place I could sleep in. Crashed my car back when I was still driving on some highway. Can’t remember much except when I kicked my way out the crushing car door, I rolled out just in time for the whole thing to go up in flames”, Tony gazed off into the distance, scanning his wary eyes over the mist that had settled on the local streets. He turned to Steve, giving him a shit-eating grin, “and I got this cool scar up near my eyebrow”.
It was his body that reacted first, shooting up from his covers and freezing momentarily, before his mind could really catch up.
And then Steve was heaving again, clutching his cold body as he sobbed quietly into his ash-brown hair, kissing his forehead, cheek, any skin that he could touch to warm him up. Natasha buried her face in Steve’s neck, clutching them both, before hitching Steve by his armpits, softly pulling him away from the one dear thing he couldn’t live without.
He was hoping to find a motel that he could at least afford – not too shabby, maybe with a few local grocers here and there but he wasn’t particularly fussed. He lived in worse conditions before.
Tony – Tony in front of him was peering through the peephole of the door, muttering incoherently like he always did before he got lowered into… into the grave.
The collar of his blouse tightened in the clenched fists of the stranger. His body was lifted momentarily before being pushed down onto the roughed-up surface of the brick wall.
he wished for loneliness to come back. He was a charming man, he wasn’t going to deny it, but Tony was pretty sure he never seen this man in his life any more than he can remember a time when he was sober, but the guy acted like they were long lost lovers! He could almost taste the alcoholic puke threatening to bust out his throat.
He saw Rhodey gently taking over, kneeling beside Tony. Brushing the hair out of Tony’s face, Rhodey kissed Tony’s eyes – one at a time, before pressing his forehead against his best friend.
Tony didn't want it to end - didn't like how his heart would tug and eyes would wander when they glanced down at Steve's uniform. Didn't like how the dirt stains and crumby soot would slowly turn into gashes and wounds oozing a dark wine-coloured red. Didn't want to think about it but he did and it scared him so he thought of the only thing he wanted to ask -
The blood must’ve been drained from his entire body because the next thing he knew, Tony scowled at him, disdain his primary emotion.
Steve stood up in a panic, wide eyes like a couple of saucer plates as he grabbed Tony by the collar. His super soldier defense instinct never really left him. The banging on the door rose to a crescendo, and the muffled husky voices of men hushed outside the door. Not only a second later, the door burst open and two men in dirty corduroy jackets rushed in, hands bare and ready for a kill.
He tried swatting the hands away, only managing to scratch and slap weakly at the surface of his strong, big hands.
And then Ultron revealed himself, staggering into the main space on incomplete legs, dragging wires and cords in his wake and emitting literal sparks when everything erupted into chaos.
The setup for a snarky little callback was too perfect to pass up. Steve knew his face had to look smug as he tilted his head just a little, looking Tony up and down with the same cocky self-righteousness that he knew he’d radiated when they’d been seconds from breaking into a fist fight on the helicarrier, right before Clint’s arrow had blown through the propellers. “Oh, I’m starting to want you to make me.”
Bucky exhaled shakily, unable to look away from the genius. “And I told him that I would step aside if it meant the two of you could be together-“
Tony didn’t comment and instead ducked his head a little and turned to look at himself in the mirror of the vanity. Bucky couldn’t breathe again. Not when Tony proceeded to pull the tie from his hair and then carefully went about pulling the longer locks he was unaccustomed with back into a more tidy bun.
What’s worse though, was the fact that they’d figured out that he was also in love with Tony, because really, it was definitely love. He wasn’t going to deny it. But there was honestly nothing he could do about it, so he kept to himself on the matter and dealt with it in his own way.
. Liked touching himself, always testing, seeing how long he could deny the pleasure of relief before he inevitably pushed himself over the edge, usually not only once or twice, but four or five sometimes in a night.
Tony tensed for a split second and then seemed to deflate and came to sit down next to the brunet, glancing over at him as he drew his knees up a bit. “Do you want to cuddle?” Bucky asked gently. “I mean, I know you like your snuggles.”
Bucky grimaced slightly and shook his head, not bothering to try and lie. “Nah, decided to just wander for a bit. I think I'm gonna go make breakfast though. Can I make you something? Pancakes? Coffee?” He tried to distract.
there’s nothing to be sorry for, love. This was my fault, I shouldn’t have pushed, okay? Please don’t feel bad, baby,” Tony tried to console and Steve only let out a desperately wounded sound.
“You were wrong,” Steve murmured, shifting a little closer to him. “You were so wrong, Buck. The second I knew you were alive, I knew I wanted to bring you home, knew I wanted to be with you again. I felt guilty for wanting to be with you when I was in love with Tony, but he-“
Bucky couldn’t help smiling a bit at that and glancing over at the genius himself, who just so happened to be giving him a timid smile of his own. Soon they were back in the kitchen and Bucky was well on his way into his third cup of coffee when Tony stood and went to the fridge to get a glass of orange juice.
He dragged the tips of his fingers up to the Reactor and gently trailed them across the mottled scar tissue there, pink mostly, with whiter spots and just like his own they were slightly raised. They were tender too, just like his. It made him a little sad, looking at the scaring there, thinking of his own as well, but Tony had
Steve nodded, “I suspected that might be the problem. He didn’t want to talk about it and said he was gonna’ go down to the lab or something. But I’m glad he got to get some sleep.”
Seeing Tony’s body like this was driving him crazy. He hadn’t touched himself since that first morning in the shower, keeping his washing and bathroom visits perfunctory at best thereafter. But after seeing Steve spread out like a damned
when he finally got a taste of the man. He shuddered so hard he was sure his teeth were about to clack if he didn’t clamp his jaw shut. He let himself revel in the taste of the man for only an instant and then it was as if everything just snapped back into place.
Soon they were both sufficiently distracted by lunch preparations and the like. “Well, I think I'm going to head down to the lab and see if I can't get some work done,” Tony informed them with a bit of a stretch as he stood.
Bucky lost it. He cackled uproariously, practically doubled over in his hysterics and Tony looked over at himself…
And there was Loki standing with his back to the windows and grinning deviously at both Steve and Thor and now the rest of the group as they filtered. Tony and Bucky were the first and foremost to step into the fray but Thor hastily stepped in front of them. “Don't get involved!” Steve warned them both from behind them and Thor nodded gravely, turning his attention back to his brother.
Bucky smiled softly and nodded, following him to his drawers and they spent a few minutes grabbing him some pants and shirts, some pyjamas too. Tony’s gaze strayed around the private space of the man’s bedroom while Tony idly put together several articles of clothing for him to wear. It was opulent, surely, but tasteful and far more lived in than the rest of the space he’d seen so far,
, clearly surprised by the weight. It wasn’t unusual for Tony to just flop himself down across someone’s lap, he was definitely a cuddler. What was unusual was the weight, as clearly he had forgotten that he wasn’t his usual self and wasn’t careful about sprawling out.
For a time, he had been nothing but supportive of their relationship from the moment he found out, but inwardly he was fighting with the pain it had brought him. He and Steve were together, once upon a time. But that time had long since passed and even though he was still Bucky…he sort of wasn’t anymore. He was different now,
He grimaced as he did so and then glanced down at the chaise, wondering if he’d gotten anything on the lush fabric. He hadn’t, thank goodness and looking down at his own self he was grateful not to have made a mess on that front either. So, he sat himself back down onto the chaise and let out a bone weary sigh. “And now I’m tired,” He muttered, bracing his elbows on his knees as he pressed his fingers against his temple perhaps rougher than necessary. “And feeling insanely guilty.”
to the kiss, Tony was pulling back for only an instant to mutter, “You’re right, you really are bad at this,” And Steve made a soft
Bucky awoke to the smell of freshly brewed coffee and he smiled sleepily as he scrubbed his face with the heel of his hand. He shifted slightly and realized there was a heavy weight on his chest. His eyes quickly flew open to find that Tony had stayed asleep on him through the night and was still sleeping soundly against him. There was quiet laughter off to his side and he glanced over to see Steve coming towards him with two cups of coffee cradled in his hands, a fond smile on his handsome face.
Natasha shrugged, “Pretty good...though I'm more interested in how you're handling this whole thing. They seem to be doing alright though.”
Tony cursed under his breath when Steve bared himself a little more to him and then tugged roughly at his sac, the blond’s pretty grunt and whine of dissatisfaction so damn pretty to his ears. “That’s it, sweetheart,” Tony praised and Steve whimpered, backing off touching himself at all, but Tony was thrilled to see his cock jump yet again.
Bucky jerked in surprise when he felt the metal hand curl carefully around his elbow and Tony paused for a moment as he met Bucky’s gaze. “I’ve got a solution for that. So you and I are going to go up to the penthouse and I’m going to sort you out.”
“I am not trying to avoid you, nor am I trying to avoid the workshop…not-not really,” He amended and then grimaced slightly at the stupidity of that sentence.
Any excuse to give himself a bit of pleasure he usually took. After nothing but pain for so long, he liked to pleasure himself, he spent probably too much time exploring his own body these days but he
Steve nodded a little, but clearly he looked a little nervous about the idea of sharing a bed with Bucky’s body. Maybe even apprehensive. “I promise no funny business,” Tony chirped, chuckling nervously as he met Bucky’s gaze, but Bucky could also tell that Tony looked worried and apprehensive himself.
It was all too much. He felt overwhelmed by his desire for his friend, for Tony in that moment too and he stroked himself faster, grip tight and perfect as he thumbed roughly over the head, right beneath that sensitive ridge and he felt it. That tell-tale bodily clench, the heat beneath the surface of what felt like his whole self and he knew it was going to be a hell of an orgasm, but could do nothing, didn’t
Just as he was starting to really become lost in his thoughts of how to handle his newest fuck up with Steve and Tony, the aforementioned genius decided to make an appearance. Tony strode through the living room, coming up short when he caught sight of Bucky hunched in on himself on the couch, head in his hands and pretty well tugging at the longer strands of his darker locks. “Bucky?” He asked softly, not wanting to spook him but needing to make sure he was all right.
He was full on Captain America in that moment and Bucky couldn’t help it, he averted his gaze and stared sullenly at the floor, very nearly shrinking in on himself.
They were sitting on the floor for one thing, Steve sitting with his legs splayed out and Tony tucked in under one arm. “It just…
Tony had bullied his way between his thighs, forcing him to part his knees enough to allow Tony to step in closer and he was really fuckin’ close now. And it was
Steve huffed and gently squeezed Tony’s biceps before letting go, letting his hands fall to his sides. “Okay, I’m terrible at this and for the record, this is also part of the problem.”
Surrounded by holographic screens in blue and silver, bathed in that light blue glow of the dozens of screens he had up around him, wearing nothing but a thin black tank-top, a pair of blue jeans that had seen better days and a shockingly red pair of his treasured
Clint was still laughing as he called after him, “Wait! Think you might want to play COD before you nap?!”
Tony was smiling, but his eyes looked a little sad, a lot tired. “I think it had something to do with me working up the nerve to tell you that I love you, Buck,” Steve whispered.
Before he’d realized it, his feet had carried him to the workshop two floors down and half a world away or so it seemed to him. He always felt so far removed from the place, this safe space Tony had created for himself. Not many people had access to the workshop and Steve wasn’t stupid enough to think that the fact he had access wasn’t a
Loki had done this in the damn first place. He sighed deeply at the thought and shook his head, turning over onto his side to grab his book from the nightstand.
had Steve’s lips stilling against his and for a split second, Bucky let himself enjoy the sweet press before Steve was pulling back sharply, Bucky jerking back just as fast.
“Mornin’,” Bucky murmured as Steve came and sat down on the edge of the coffee table, only a foot or so away.
He sat at the edge of his bed, hunched over, hands wound tightly in his shorter hair as he tried to ground himself.
He exhaled shakily, pushing the button to call the elevator roughly and then again when it didn’t immediately open. He was scowling as the doors opened and then he was inside, the elevator taking him up the few floors to their apartment’s floor when he’d given the destination.
Tony gave him a weak smile and slipped in beside him, gently pillowing his head against the brunet’s chest, splaying his left hand gently beneath the Arc Reactor. Bucky smiled nervously and let his arm slip around the genius’ shoulder, holding him close. They chatted absentmindedly for a while, just curled up together like that. Not about anything of real importance, really; mostly about the show and who their favourite characters were.
Tony scoffed, but he was smiling so Bucky didn’t take it too personally as he dipped his hands beneath the cool water and then splashed some on his face. “You know, I could give you some of my clothes so you don’t have to wear stuff that’s too big for you,” Tony offered and Bucky cast him a curious look as he was handed a towel, to which Bucky pressed to his now damp face as he shut off the tap.
Later that afternoon, Bucky found himself lying flat on his back on one of the sparring mats in the gym as he struggled for air. He was wheezing and struggling to relax his frantically beating heart, but he couldn’t help laughing breathlessly when Steve leaned over him to check on him, a worried but fond expression on his face.
Steve laughed, “He does like his coffee. Anyway, I’m gonna’ grab a shower and then I’ll meet you downstairs?”
it from his hands. Steve never took it personally, just smiled and nodded and watched as Tony would turn away, move the cup to his other hand and as if by compulsion, clenched his now free hand in a fist before releasing the tension that had gathered there and in his shoulders.
Bucky sighed and stood, having witnessed the almost kiss and he was feeling a little conflicted at the moment. “Hmm, maybe I'll go take a nap or something. I'm kinda tired,” He said aloud, yawning a bit.
Bucky reeled slightly in surprise and watched as the red-head looked him over. “Seriously, Barnes? This is pretty amazing, not gonna lie.”
His forehead creased, brow furrowed in confusion for a half second before he remembered the text. He shifted to pull his cellphone out of his back pocket and relaxed when he saw a text from Bucky. He was probably just running behi-
Steve was smiling despite himself as he turned to look at the man. “You’re always working on a thousand things at once. I don’t know how you can focus on any one thing when you’ve got a dozen projects on the go.”
Bucky smiled a little and couldn’t help chuckling softly, “Ah…hopefully he didn’t cause too much damage?”
Steve let out a strangled sound and grabbed the pillow he’d been reclined against, shoving it hastily between his legs in an attempt to cover himself. His eyes were wide,
Bucky’s laughter slowly died and he smiled nervously across at the genius. “Be my guest, Tony. Just…be careful. The strength is probably going to take a bit to get used to,” Bucky warned.
He’d fucked up, he knew that now and the guilt of it sat heavy in his stomach. He glanced down at himself as he shifted, forehead still pressed against the door and grimaced slightly as his now cooling come started to get uncomfortable. He sighed as he heard Steve start up the shower and decided he’d better wash up quickly himself and headed for his floor, hoping no one would happen across him.
He tried to read, really, he did. But he kept getting distracted by the blond curled up on the sofa close by. He was curled up facing the coffee table, head resting lightly atop one of the throw pillows. There was one of the many blankets that littered the apartment draped over his middle and it appeared to have fallen from his shoulders during sleep.
” Tony asked, trying to distract Bucky from the glaringly obvious way he was practically exuding how uncomfortable he felt.
Now if only Bucky could make himself stop thinking of his best friend’s guy in more than a friendly sense, that would be great. He inwardly grimaced at the thought but quickly pushed it aside when he shivered on the next downstroke. The pleasure was too good to ignore right then and he let the hand that had been tracing carefully around the Reactor drop much lower, down to fondle his sac gently. He’d found that Tony was quite sensitive there, not like himself. Well, not entirely. He was sensitive just about everywhere, but his balls could take a bit of abuse, unlike Tony’s.
Bruce sighed deeply then. “Alright, well, I’ll be down in the lab if you need anything and Thor? Maybe you could come along for a bit? I wanted to ask you about the spell and see what you can tell me about it.”
Steve whined and shifted his hips against the bed and Tony watched in awe as his cock jumped again, pre-come weaving a glistening thread between abs and its shiny head. “You wish Bucky were here, baby, I know,” Tony consoled and Steve whimpered, shutting his eyes against the sight the man made.
“I mean it,” Bucky chuckled and Tony’s eyes crinkled as he glanced back to Bucky. “And…thanks, for this.”
as it were. And then there was Steve…the poor guy was starting to look quite strained around the edges. Bucky tried not to think about
“ Tony went on, smothering Steve’s complaint beneath the palm of his hand and making the blond kiss it in retaliation. “You came back and he
Bucky exhaled in surprise through his nose, entire body tensing up at the press of warm, soft lips against his. But of course his lack of well, kissing
Tony gave him a slightly nervous smile and that’s when Bucky noticed the posture. Tony looked stiff, uncomfortable and had his arms wrapped around himself protectively. “What’s wrong?” Bucky asked curiously, shifting to look at him better.
“That’s it,” Tony whispered, tongue darting out to wet his lips and Steve whimpered, hips shifting up from the bed.
Bucky roamed the halls by himself until the wee hours of early morning. He still couldn't bring himself to return to their apartment even after he was sure Steve would have been up and gone for his morning run. He didn’t want to chance running into either of them before he was ready. Not that he thought he’d ever necessarily be ready.
Tony swallowed hard and for a moment, didn’t say anything. They just stared at each other, seeing themselves through each others eyes and for a long moment, everything seemed to just fade away. “It’s just a number,” Tony breathed, blinking back a slew of tears he hadn’t even realized had been building.
Tony scowled at him and took a step towards him and Bucky realized that he was a fair bit taller than the genius. He swallowed hard, looking up at the brunet in his body and suddenly he felt very, very small.
But though he clearly had well defined abs, there was a softness to his middle that just made Bucky want to press his lips to them and feel them shiver beneath his tongue. He groaned, cock twitching feebly against his thigh and couldn’t help himself when in the next moment, he raised his hand to his lips and licked some of Tony’s come from his palm.
Steve made a soft noise of assent and took a step closer to the man. “It’s probably more my fault than anything…and I don’t just mean the kiss.”
Bucky took a deep breath and tried to calm himself. His thoughts were starting to wander and it was only going to go downhill from there if he couldn’t get a handle on himself. He really didn’t want to spiral today. “Well, I think it’s safe to say that you’re both benched from any missions or calls for the next few days while this sorts itself out,” Steve sighed, his gaze flickering between the pair.
. “I dunno, I mean, yeah it’s weird. But they’ll be back to themselves soon enough,” He told her with a bit of a shrug.
Once dried off and dressed, he flopped himself down onto his bed and threw his arm up over his face. He dozed for a short while and awoke to the sound of voices coming down the hallway.
Bucky glanced to him and watched as Tony took a sip of his drink and had to look away from his own face and distract himself with a sip of his own. “It’s weird, isn’t it?” Tony murmured and Bucky swallowed the mouthful he’d taken, savouring the beautiful smooth burn of it.
there too. Wanted the three of them tangled up in bed together, limbs thrown over one another in a haphazard mess. He wanted soft sighs and languid moans and warm mornings and bright laughter. He wanted sweet kisses and passionate kisses, hungry and needy kisses and he wanted hugs, so many damn hugs.
Bucky laughed and grinned, watching as Steve glanced over at the genius and his blush deepened as he took in the sight of Bucky’s body so openly on display. Tony grinned and cackled at the expression on Steve’s face before the blond seemed to catch himself and huffed out a breath, getting to his feet.
” He prompted, crossing his arms in front of his chest-metal and flesh alike-in a slight show of impatience.
to love them both, you’re allowed to have feelings for them,” He muttered and now he was really gathering steam. “But if you’re ever going to get over them, you’re going to need to come to terms with the fact that you
“No, you shouldn’t,” Tony interrupted and Bucky’s gaze flickered up to meet his, but he couldn’t get a proper read on him, on
Without much thought, Tony sprawled himself across the couch and half of him ended up across Bucky’s lap. Bucky
Natasha reached out to card her fingers through his shorter hair and he turned his head, resting his cheek against the counter to look at her as he pressed slightly into her warm hand. He tried to give her a little smile, but it didn’t reach his eyes. “You’ll be fine, Barnes,” She consoled before slipping off the counter and striding over towards the bowl of fruit by the fridge.
Steve smiled quietly as he watched the pair before Tony glanced over at him and took in the sight of the cup of coffee. “Is that for me?” He asked, reaching out and making grabby hands for the cup.
Clint cackled evilly. Well, so much for hiding the bit of fun he’d had in the shower, even if it had been tainted with guilt. Steve was looking at him with a bit of a nervous smile and his cheeks were slightly flushed and Bucky realized that he needed to get the fuck out of there, like
Tony frowned, brow knitting in agitation. “I’m pushin’ forty, Buck. You two are barely even thirty at this point, if you don’t take into account all your years as popsicles.”
Tony sighed and now Steve turned to survey him, frown only deepening when the genius shrugged and refused to meet his gaze. It only confused Steve more. “Yeah, I mean…I know you don’t like coming down here, so…”
“Then why?” Tony asked in confusion, shoulders slumping in defeat. “Is it because of Dum-E? I know he can be a bother sometimes, but-“
with Tony. The genius didn’t even have to search him out this time because they’d been watching a movie together with Steve and though they all kept a careful distance from one another, one that Bucky tried rather hard not to think about, Tony eventually found his way over to Bucky and they’d ended up draped over each other as they slept. Bucky also didn’t let himself think about how when he’d woken that morning, there had been a blanket draped over them both that definitely hadn’t been there before.
Hearing the worry in his friend’s voice wouldn’t even allow him to even contemplate refuting the idea. “Okay,” He found himself agreeing and Tony gently guided him to his feet.
. I think he’s loved you from the moment he first met you actually and even when he thought you were gone, he
Steve frowned. Tony sounded…almost disappointed, maybe? “Save me the trip?” Steve found himself asking.
“Good, my poor heart was hurting just looking at you like that,” He teased and Bucky chuckled, getting down off the counter.
Bucky made a soft noise in the back of his throat at the way the French just rolled off his tongue in a way that had goosebumps breaking out along his skin and
There was a soft thunk against the wood of the door and Tony frowned, knowing that Steve was probably pressing his forehead against it. So, he did the same and he knew Steve would be able to hear it just as he had.
“You have such a nice ass,” Tony sighed and Steve shot him an embarrassed glance as he made himself more comfortable, back against the pillows.
Tony sighed and shook his head a bit, “When it’s really bad, please just let us know. I already talked to Steve about it. We both agree that it’s not fair that you're dealing with this on your own, James. We only want to help.”
When Tony had come back not ten-minutes later with fresh clothes and a clearer head, Steve was still in the shower, so Tony busied himself with stripping the bed and pulling out a set of fresh sheets. After he’d finished that, he went about pulling out a pair of grey pants for Steve and a white t-shirt, knowing he’d probably be too warm after his shower to want a sweater on just yet. He pulled out a pair of black briefs and a pair of socks before he set them neatly on the dresser beside the bathroom door.
Steve shrugged a bit as he glanced down at his own cup. “It’s not your fault and really, it could have been worse, I think. I’m just glad my two best guys are getting along so well.”
Tony hummed and sidled up beside him, cup of coffee raised to hover near his lips and Steve tried not to think about how he could see how his first sip had left them wet and pink with warmth.
Steve chuckled nervously and nodded. “Uh, sure Tony. I can help you. But Bucky is right, we should probably be a bit more careful. Bucky’s used to his strength, you definitely, are not.”
“That’s why you never come to deliver my coffee yourself?” Tony asked, voice quiet as if he didn’t want to break whatever was brewing between them.
Tony hummed under his breath before he smirked over at Steve, raising an eyebrow and waggling it suggestively. “Gonna’ come and fool around with me?” He teased, and the moment the words left his mouth, he realized his mistake.
He lingered there for a moment, just listening to the sounds of the water running, splashing against tiles and glass and he frowned, closing his eyes as he heard the unmistakable sound of a soft hitched breath, a
Steve feel like a bumbling idiot around his friends and it wasn’t like it was really their fault. They were never rude or condescending...well, maybe a little rude, but they were just teasing him. Even Bucky still teased him and Tony too and it wasn’t as if Steve didn’t
He forced his gaze away when Tony huffed softly under his breath and Bucky just managed to catch sight of the growing bulge between Tony-
Bucky swivelled to see Tony standing not five feet away, eyes wide and hands up in a questioning manner and Bucky’s face positively
Bucky groaned softly and nodded, “Yeah, just a touch. Thinking about them sharing a bed is really fuckin’ with me.”
Eventually he just couldn’t take it anymore and got up. He was pretty sure the pair didn’t know he was in his room and he made a big deal of shutting his ensuite bathroom door loud enough so that they could hear it. Hopefully they would think he had been in the shower or something and not secretly listening to them.
Steve seemed to understand then and Bucky watched as the blond struggled with himself with the urge to touch and comfort Tony…in
his body. The first thing he noted was that his hips ached slightly, the second was that yeah, he could definitely smell Steve on him and not just his regular woodsy smell,
“Morning, Buck. I see Tony came and found you,” He nodded towards Tony as he handed off a mug to Bucky.
Natasha sighed and the other men seemed to sigh collectively as well. “I don’t know how I’m going to make it through the next hour let alone get through a whole day. Or worse, two or three days like this,” Bucky groaned, leaning forward and resting his forehead against the cool counter top of the kitchen island.
That didn’t last long. After he’d managed to wash his hair and face, he realized that he was going to have to touch the rest of him if he wanted to actually get properly clean. “For fuck’s sake,” He muttered, grabbing his loofa and pouring a bit of body wash on the pink puff.
“Thanks,” Bucky said gruffly, still not looking at him. “But you don’t have to lie ta’me. I’m no Tony Stark, I know that.”
Tony gave him a nervous smile, gaze sweeping over him, assessing. “Did you try and go back to sleep at all?”
Soon it was just Steve and Bucky in the living room together and the blond curled up on the little love seat across the room. He pulled out his book and started in on it and before long most of the afternoon had bled away. By around 3:30pm, Bucky stirred when he heard voices and he sat bolt upright, startled by the noise.
“What Steve is trying to say…is that he is in love with you, Bucky,” Tony clarified and Bucky blinked…and then began shaking his head and couldn’t seem to stop.
I didn’t ask if you were fine,” Tony huffed. “And I know you have a headache, so come on, up you get.”
Tony eyed him warily for a moment before nodding hesitantly. “Uh…sure, can never say no to coffee. Why don't I come give you a hand?”
. He relaxed, shoulders slumping slightly as he huffed out a tense breath. Tony watched him all the while, though he had taken a respectful step back as Steve tried to settle himself.
Natasha just smirked a little at him and nodded. “It’s not like he sees me like that anyway, I’m his best friend. It’s just me that wants something more.”
Steve smiled and soon they were arguing over what to order for dinner. Not long after, the rest of the Team came down to join them and once dinner had been decided upon, they ordered and settled in to watch a couple of movies together.
Bucky wasn’t sure how to move forward from this slightly awkward conversation, so he cleared his throat and tried another tactic. “I could uh…give you some of my clothes, if you want. I uh…well I know Steve tends to wear his shirts a little tight,” Bucky offered, a lopsided tilt to his lips as he let himself look at his own body and the way he was stretching out the grey t-shirt rather obscenely.
go back to bed. I’m sorry you guys, I’ll see you later. I’m fine, don’t worry about me,” He insisted and left the two standing in the living room, not bothering to cast a cursory glance over his shoulder at the pair.
Being superheroes on top of dealing with that shit wasn’t an easy thing to have to deal with either, no matter what your superpower was. And though Bucky wouldn’t call himself a superhero even in the lightest use of the term, he still participated on missions and the like when his particular skill set was called for. Still, he never entirely felt like he could ever be called a hero, no matter what anyone said. But really, that was a whole other can of worms to be explored at a later time. A
that he was intimidated by technology because Tony always did his best to guide him through his new inventions. He was constantly giving the Team new items to try in the field and Steve was always eager to help in any way that he could and Tony was always so kind, so
Bucky blew out a slow breath and nodded slowly. “Yeah-“ And his voice shouldn’t have been so hoarse, there was no reason for it. “It is.”
Bucky turned around, stopping him from coming too far into his room and pressed his flesh and blood hand to the blond’s chest to stop him, ignoring the warmth of the man’s skin, the steady rise and fall of his chest, the beating of his heart beneath. Steve instantly stilled at his touch and met his friend’s darkened gaze. “I’m fine, Steve. I-I’m sorry I woke you. I’m sorry I interrupted you and Tony,” He apologized.
Bucky immediately righted himself, completely caught off guard by the man. He hadn’t even heard him come in and that-that was never a good sign. “Hey,” He replied, quickly getting up from his spot.
Unable to help himself, he dropped the loofa in favour of taking a hold of the genius’ quickly hardening cock. He moaned softly and gave himself a firm stroke. His knees nearly buckled and he shut his eyes tightly for a moment or three.
Tony had offered to give him a quick lesson on how to do it and Steve had watched, bewildered by the way the man worked the machine as if it were nothing more than an extension of himself. And really, Steve shouldn’t have been
Steve rolled his eyes and huffed, “Yeah, I know. I really do want it to work out though...I just...I have no idea how to bring it up. I mean, I’ve not told him how just
“I wasn’t stupid,” Tony cut in. “I knew what you two were to each other long before we knew you were alive and when we found out, I told him that I would do everything in my power to bring you home. I knew Steve loved you, would keep loving you. But he loved me too and I believed him with every fibre of my being when he told me he wasn’t going to leave me.”
Bucky frowned, unhappy with the fact that his body was giving Tony so much trouble. Thor had said that the spell should wear off in a couple of days and he wondered just how much longer he was going to have to let Tony suffer. Furthermore, he wondered why the
liked Tony. The man was a lot of things; a genius, billionaire, not so much a playboy anymore, philanthropist as well. Not to mention a whole ton of other amazing things. He was kind, generous, had a huge heart and was in love with Bucky’s best friend.
The first person he saw was Steve sitting and reading who was now smiling at him gently. “Uh, hey...how long was I asleep?” Bucky asked, rubbing at his eyes.
Steve blushed a little and nodded, murmuring his good byes but just as Tony was about to leave, he decided to grab a bottle of water from the fridge. This time he was careful when he opened the door and he smirked triumphantly.
Bucky took a moment to glance around the space and swallowed thickly. Tony’s space was…it was something else. All clean lines and sleek marble. Black and white and greys with touches of cobalt scattered throughout. It was beautiful but looked as if you were to touch anything, you’d somehow ruin it. It was odd though, there wasn’t a stitch of red or gold anywhere.
Smirking, Steve slid his hand around Tony’s thigh and tugged him a step away from the wall, twisting him around to put him facing the wall. Using his other hand, Steve delivered a pair of good, hard swats to Tony’s bare ass, leaving a lovely pink handprint on each cheek. “Cap, what the fuck--”
Steve reached between their bodies, his fingers closing tightly around Tony’s cock and using the man’s own pre-come to slick his palm before giving the shaft a few swift, hard strokes. He grinned smugly at the tortured sound that he got in return, letting his hand slide back further until Steve’s fingers could tease over Tony’s balls, back to his taint. “You will for me.”
“Quiet,” Steve said shortly, knowing that his continued smirk would soften the heat of the order. He released Tony’s vest and caught his wrists, pinning them level with his shoulders. Following the momentum of the moment, Steve surged forward, reinforcing the command for silence with a hard, borderline savage kiss.
Once he was four-fingers deep, Steve was more than ready to drop the niceties and get things moving.
Steve intervened, stopping Thor from causing Tony actual bodily harm, but he couldn’t pretend that he didn’t feel a flicker of the same serious rage, himself.
And more importantly, Tony did not react in a manner that would have prompted an apology, even if Steve had instantly rushed to prepare one. The dark-haired man’s eyes leapt back to Steve’s, widening, his pupils expanding, and his lips parted to let out a startled exhalation that sounded--at least in Steve’s ears--like something tauntingly close to an aborted groan.
It wasn’t clear if it was his words, or the intensity of the fucking, or even just the fantastic sounds of their bodies slamming together. But Tony finally broke, letting out a shout that might just have escalated into a proper scream if his vocal cords weren’t being compressed along with his airway under the unyielding force of Steve’s hand.
Tony let out a shocked sound, rutting forward helplessly. Looking down, Steve saw that he was already leaking pre-come, leaving a darkened streak along the hip of Steve’s own pants. “Messy bitch,” he muttered, smirking. “I think I’m going to need to make you scream for me, Stark."
Steve huffed, unfolding his arms and taking a few steps closer. “Those lectures were designed for selling war bonds and scolding school kids in detention. I don’t think saying ‘I’m not angry, just disappointed’ will do much, in this case.”
“We’re the Avengers--we can bust arms dealers all the livelong day, but...that up there, that’s the endgame. How were you guys planning on beating that?” Tony’s face was both hard and scared, a mixture of emotions that Steve was not used to seeing on the billionaire’s handsome features. He looked more tired than the super soldier had ever seen him.
Keeping his pants on with Clint had been a matter of kink; now, with Tony, it was back to being situational necessity, like it had been with Natasha. Steve had no doubt that Nat would have subtly locked the lab door behind them all, but that didn’t mean he needed to keep his ass on display if anyone came back.
“You and me, we’ve got a history of winding up too tight and then going for each other’s throats,” Tony muttered. There was a bitter amusement in his tone. He turned around at last, leaning back against the computer station with complete nonchalance; he even crossed his fucking ankles, and his hands slid into his pants pockets as if he wasn’t concerned in the slightest about what Steve might do. It made Steve want to shake him. “No, I guess I don’t blame you for being pissed at me. No more than I blamed you for being afraid to let Banner loosen up, back when we were all on the helicarrier.”
From the choked-off whines and moans escaping from him around the intrusion of Steve’s tongue, the shorter man definitely didn’t appear to object.
“You blame me?” Steve asked archly. The negative emotions were bubbling a little closer to the surface, and he was hyper-aware of the fact that it was only the two of them in the room. This felt precariously similar to the moment of rising heat that he’d felt in Sam’s bedroom, on the run with Natasha. Something was about to snap...but he wasn’t sure that whatever happened next was going to be a bad thing.
Tony sucked in air, peeking down to watch Steve as he very intentionally, very slowly began unfastening the button and then the zipper of his pants. “Not playing fair, Cap, you know how long I’ve waited--”
voice. Straightening back up, he leaned in to kiss the sweaty curve of Tony’s neck just above his shirt collar, then nipped at his earlobe, grinning when Tony let out a cracked noise. “Call me if you need me to come back in here.”
Oh, fucking hell. Steve’s face darkened, his breath hitching a little as more restless anger simmered up through him. “I wanted to keep us all safe. Bruce didn’t resent that.” He licked his lips, and Tony’s eyes fell to his mouth. The itch deepened under Steve’s skin. “You’re pushing me on purpose, Stark.”
Sighing, Steve looked at Rhodes. “Can you help him off--and be his communications contact, here?” He saw the flash of confusion and then understanding, and Rhodes nodded, looking over at Tony; the other man hadn’t turned around yet. Rhodes murmured an affirmation, following Thor and letting the lab door slide shut behind him with a soft, mechanical hiss.
Steve rolled his eyes. “You know I grew up in Brooklyn, right? The boy scout bullshit was a part of the Captain America performance. Not really my personality.” He arched one eyebrow. “Nat didn’t have to do a damned thing other than make it clear that I was allowed to show other sides of myself around her.”
“I get to top at some point,” Tony grumbled, but then he squeezed his inner muscles, gasping when Steve reacted promptly by tightening his fingers on the smaller man’s hips again. “Yeah, okay, fuck--Goddamn, gonna need to mold a fucking dildo based on this monster. Pep will go insane to see me taking it...” He tipped his head back against the wall, smiling faintly. “Jokes aside, though...I’m gonna fix it, Steve.”
His hips sped up, and now his panted words were being underlined by the delicious slap of skin-on-skin as he buried himself inside of Tony with every brutal thrust. “Come on, Stark. You’re going to come just from my cock inside of you and my hand on your throat, and you’re gonna come
Tony’s breathing was more ragged now, and he was no longer fighting for control; Steve could feel him relax, trusting the blonde man’s hold on him and focusing instead on writhing as much as his pinned position would allow, almost managing to use Steve’s cock to fuck himself. “Close--I’m--”
“Shit,” Tony gasped, grappling at his shoulders. “Knowing and experiencing are seriously fucking different--”
The pre-come wouldn’t be enough, but it worked for a tease; Steve let the tip of his middle finger rub over Tony’s entrance, feeling how the furled muscle quivered and clenched against the suggestion of penetration. “Have you never--”
Finally, the stress and tension that had overtaken Tony from the instant they’d heard Ultron’s voice began to crack. He even almost smiled. “Isn’t that kinda my M.O., Captain?”
Tony gasped, jerking back enough for Steve to see that his eyes were almost black, his pupils dilated almost comically as he clawed at Steve’s shoulders. “Do it--”
Tony was pulling his pants back on, leaning his shoulders back against the wall for support. He smirked when he saw Steve stop. “All good here,” he said, adding a wink simply because he was that much of a little shit. “I’ll page ya, Cap.”
The party was wonderful right through to its near-end; once all the guests had left, and it was just the team, they relaxed and left the clean-up for later. Everyone was having one final drink, warmth and laughter making the atmosphere cozy and pleasant as the night wore on.
In the aftermath, Steve rallied the group to make sure that everyone was alright. All injuries were minor, and none of them needed more than basic first aid, so he encouraged everyone to gather in the lab so that they could handle that far away from all of the glass shards left from shattered windows and decor.
. Steve laughed, dark and low. “If I wanted to, Stark, I could hold Banner up--in either form. Not that I’d try, with the green guy...” He smirked, pressing Tony’s arms harder to the wall without a word--
He was cut off as Steve slammed their mouths together, simultaneously using the wall to keep Tony from so much as moving as he rolled his lower body again, and then again, fucking into Tony without ever drawing back enough to even risk him slipping. The kiss was just as demanding and relentless as his body; Steve bit and sucked at the swell of Tony’s bottom lip until he submitted and opened to him, and Steve took full advantage. His tongue worked in rhythm with his cock, pressing in deep and demanding that Tony simply take what was being done to him.
Rolling his eyes, Steve shifted his position to keep his balance without having to let Tony get back on his feet. “Or you could just ask for a good hard fuck whenever you need it. I’d prefer not having to deal with homicidal machinery in between rounds.”
Tony’s eyes rolled a little, and he managed to get in another few seconds of disjointed humping before Steve cocked his hips, pinning Tony’s entire body to the wall. “Pretty sure you’ve been made aware of how hot you are,” Tony muttered, his head thudding back in frustration at being unable to keep moving. “Of fucking course I’m hard just from you goddamn slamming me against--”
Still, he knew that Tony wasn’t going to just roll over--metaphorically or literally--and take it, not like Clint would. The shorter man wriggled a little in place, and before Steve caught it, Tony had managed to get one leg between his, and he rocked forward, grinding their hips together roughly.
“Security footage of the lab saved to an encrypted file and emailed to your personal server only,” she confirmed in her soothing Irish accent. “Footage is deleted from Avengers-accessible surveillance. Only you can approve anyone seeing the last hour in this room.”
“Yeah, yeah--” Tony panted, a little too dismissively for Steve’s liking; he was attempting to hook one leg up around Steve’s hip, though he had nothing on the older man’s strength. “Okay,
Tony’s eyes swept over each member of the team in turn, not looking for forgiveness, but rather seeming determined to make them see his point. There was an underlying pain when he reminded them of the army that had come down through the wormhole, almost an edge of panic as he described the glimpse he had gotten when he had taken the missile up there. Something far bigger, worse, stronger than anything that they had faced together to date.
“Then we’ll do that together, too,” he countered, but it did make something in his chest clench with fear. That was not something that Steve particularly enjoyed experiencing. “Let’s--just call it, for tonight,” he went on, forcing his voice to remain steady. “Dr. Cho, can you help Maria finish--” The doctor nodded, moving over to take the tweezers that Maria was using to carefully extract glass splinters from the soles of her feet. Clint drifted away from the wall at once to assist, letting Maria hook her arm over his shoulders so that she didn’t need to apply any weight to her feet, half-hopping and half-limping along as Clint and Cho guided her from the lab.
Finally, Steve swayed enough to let Tony ease back to the floor, and he eased his spent cock out of the other man, then lifted the hem of his shirt to check and make sure the bruises he’d left weren’t signs of worse injury. “I know you will. And we’re gonna help you.” Leaning forward, he pressed a gentle kiss to the darkest of the bruises, which held hints of distinct finger-shaped lines curling around Tony’s hip. He heard the soft inhale from above his head; he’d surprised Tony.
He winced, rolling his shoulder to hopefully ease the pain without having the luxury to rub it with his palm.
Turning to walk back out the door, he couldn’t fathom as to who she was or why she said such things. He might not have spider senses like Peter that Tony liked to talk about. But he couldn’t ignore the strange coiling in the pit of his belly as he settled back on his motorbike and rode off North.
It was as if these days his mind and body were detached into two completely separate things. There was always a sort of inkling of scorn berating him for not being there for the funeral of his lover and yet he couldn’t understand that there was a sense of innate emptiness that had curled its way into his heart, digging so deep within that he would wake up every night shrieking and clawing at his chest, trying to get that hollow itch out of his possessed body. Other days, he would reminisce back to the time at the shed when he had buried his cock deep into his lover and made love to him until the sun came up. Those days he woke up screaming his lungs out whilst he came into his bedsheets, tears and sweat running down his taut aching body and pooling into the ridges of his wounds. He was a mess. A nerve – like Bruce once said – exposed, defective, insane for his craving of Tony. For Tony to be warm and breathing and nuzzled up next to him again.
They have been wasting time. Steve straightened his shoulder and spoke sternly. He didn’t mean to sound harsh or patronizing, but if it meant saving the team and even so, saving the world, he would take patronizing any day.
Kicking his shoes off, he curled his knees under the blankets and nuzzled his nose against the pillow, drifting into the hazy comfort of sleep and void emptiness.
“Who the hell are you?” Steve snapped in his ear, roughly tugging his face to clearly see him in the dim motel light.
He caught a glimpse of the muscle power the blondie had, calves and body pumping out a rhythmic sprint, steadily inching closer and closer. It wasn’t too long before the blondie caught up with him, seizing hold of his wrist and dragging his protesting body over to a nearby alley, pinning him against the dry-cut bricks.
The men were heavy, their legs too weak to sustain the bulk of their weight. Steve continued to persist, dragging the human dumbbells over to the side of the window. There was a fire escape route just outside that led to the town below. If he could just get them out the window and roll them down the stairs and place them at ground floor, they could get away without having harmed anyway in the process. Yes – that’ll do, he thought.
Pushing on, Steve turned his concentration on the path ahead, breathing in the musky trail of dust and sand as few bushes and rocky landscapes receded by like he was travelling in one of Thor’s weird portals through space and time. He savoured the brief and rare moments when a chilled breeze would drift by, catching the taste and smell of smoked up gunmetal.
The door was rattling so hard from the loud banging and he could hear screams echoing throughout the entire hallway.
He didn’t fail to drive him insane when he disobeyed orders for the last time and flew to drive a stake right into the middle of Thanos’ heart.
Tony’s coffee cup. Silk bedsheets of Tony. Tony’s waft of cologne each time he opens their old wardrobe. His teammates that only served to exist to mirror the tragedy that they lost Tony. Tony’s workshop when he decided to finally pick up some drawing pencils and canvases he accidentally left there years ago, buried in a cardboard box in the corner that he thought maybe Tony never managed to abandon.
He must’ve been frustrated because Steve wasn’t answering him and for some odd reason, he needed Steve to answer him. Why couldn’t people just leave him alone?
He exhaled roughly through his nose in the next moment, his thumb and forefinger squeezing the tip of Tony’s cock before he swiped the slightly rough pad of his thumb over his leaking tip and then he was coming, hard and fast, so damn sudden it punched a desperate groan out of him. He shuddered hard, practically doubling over as he stroked himself through it, his eyes falling shut as he rode it out.
Steve lifted his gaze then and Bucky’s gaze softened, seeing the glistening of tears held there. “He knew that I was in love with you, Buck.”
Steve blushed even deeper and chanced a glance at the pair to see if they’d heard. They hadn’t. He turned his attention back to the red-head. “No...but it’s not exactly how I’d like to go about it,” Steve admitted.
but they were amazing. His gaze lingered on the Arc Reactor for a little while and he soon found his free hand tracing a gentle line of caresses along his abdomen, which was straining-
reflected in Bucky’s grey-blue eyes. He was ashamed to admit that his knees grew a little weak in the face of it. “Tony,
He quickly sucked in a breath before he pulled his t-shirt on, ignoring how it was too bug as well and headed out to see his friend. “Hey, Steve,” Bucky called. “How was your workout with Tony?” He asked as he came down the hall and into the living room.
and he was being kind and patient and-and Steve maybe fell in love with him a little bit and somewhere along the way he’d realized that yes, yes he
“And do you forget that this is one of the best bakeries in the city? And I usually can’t afford  even one of those cannolis?”
Bucky nodded as he got up, his voice gloomy but trying. “Yeah, I’m glad he’s taking this seriously.” He patted Steve on the back on his way past. “I got some work to do. Congrats, man.”
Tony nodded. “I can worry as often as you want. And we’re gonna have lots of moments, so I guess we can practice that too.” He tossed his phone on the table and kissed Steve again.
All too soon, Steve’s thrusts faltered and he groaned loudly as he came in his boxers. He stayed inside of Tony though, he knew it would only be a minute or two before he could go again, and actually get Tony off.
He leaned over the car, pulled a wire from one port and plugged it into another. Lights shone up from the chassis as the lights in the room dimmed, and a disco ball lowered through the ceiling as music started to play from inside the car, just a little grainy for authenticity, some old slow dance from the second world war.
Tony smiled sheepishly. “Yeah I… I guess that would seem like a big deal. I forget how much of this nonsense is just background radiation to me. Can I - Would you let me say that I’m sorry for all this again or is that just gauche at this point?”
“Yeah but it wasn’t ‘just’ anything. I did love her. I do love her. Why is that somehow less-than because we’re not having sex forever? How do I decide which of my encounters count on the constructed rubric of ‘real’ if that’s not?”
Heaving a breath through his tight-woven chest, he thought that if he didn't say it now, he might never get the chance to.
Her voice croaked in broken syllables, so Steve had to patiently wait and string the sentences together to fully understand her. Her lip wobbled, like she required every push of her strength to speak, looking as though she might collapse at any moment.
He had to act fast. Ripping the bedsheet and throwing it as a distraction tactic, he used it as a chance to land three punches to the gut of the first men, rendering his body a massive weight to throw in front of the other perpetrator. The loud crackling of glass shards echoed within the room and only then did Steve turn around to see Tony hitching his leg up over the window frame, brown hair ruffling in the cold chilly breeze.
Steve gave her a small smile albeit her being a bit odd, she was nice. She pushed her face right up against him until he could catch a faint whiff of her stenched breath, squinting her eyes at him like she was extremely interested in studying such a new specimen.
The men lying on the ground started to rouse, groaning and muttering profanities under their breath. Oddly, a stench of smoke drifted to Steve’s nose, the haze stinging his eyes. He spluttered a few times before covering his own mouth and nose with his own arm. He glanced around to see the source of the smoke, only to land his gaze on a small flame licking up the side of the bed from a lighter. He had to think fast. Pacing over to the two men by the floor, he took a hold of each other their arms, before dragging them, semi-conscious, towards the window.
Tony thought he caught a glimpse of guilt flash across the man’s expression, immediately withdrawing his hand like Tony was some hot stove that he burnt himself with. He wouldn’t even look up from the ground he was staring at.
Nat’s eyes met Steve’s; she blinked, somehow managing to flick her glance towards Tony in the same movement, and when Steve just gazed back at her--
And of course, it meant that the team could discuss, as Tony and Bruce had moved at once to move Ultron’s lanky form--corpse? Was a machine ever alive?--back to the table it had come from.
Steve’s hand slammed against the wall as he thrust forward with a hard snap of his hips, burying himself to the base in Tony’s ass and savoring the much louder sound, almost a yelp, that tore out of him in response. “Hence the takin’ my time on prep. But you’re open enough, now...”
“Glad you have that failsafe in there.” Steve kissed his cheek and laid his head on Tony’s shoulder. “Thank you.”
“Unlike Clint, I’m not keen on explaining our sex life to people.” He tightened his grip around Tony a bit. “I like keeping it to ourselves, so that it’s ours.”
Tony put his phone down and sank into the chair at the bank of graphic design stations he liked to think of as his cockpit. He felt sweaty and uneasy and out of breath. So this was dating. He went ahead and shut down his stations manually one at a time and went up for a shower and about sixteen hours of sleep.
Steve sighed. “I’ve learned to tune people out. At least when I don’t think it’s worth the energy. And these people aren’t worth the energy, so I’ll tune them out too.” Steve held Tony’s face in his hands. “I’m not going anywhere, Tony. Fate put us together for a reason, and I’m not gonna let some Fox News reporters ruin it for us. I’ve been to protests where there’s been tear gas used, I’ve been spat on, hit in the head with a literal bible, and I have stopped giving a fuck about the people who hate me for who I am. I’m not letting you go through this alone, and I won’t break because of them. So you’ll need to get used to me being with you in photos because I’m not going anywhere. Alright?”
“Definitely not. I’m actually kind of scaring myself right now.” He smiled in a way he desperately, desperately hoped was relaxed and charming.
Tony gave a heavy sigh. “I give you a pop quiz and have to stand for the pop bar exam, ok…” He sat back and thought for a while. “Well, where relationships are concerned, I guess there have been about four? Not counting you?” He felt like a weenie for being so unsure, but he’d been an ethical slut for so long the definitions most people used took some thinking to apply.
“Well, we didn’t. I told him I wasn’t ready for that, and he respected it… but there was a lot of kissing.”
Steve took a few minutes to really look at the different packers. He eventually decided on a decently sized one that wouldn’t look like he was hung, but still a decent size, probably five inches.
“Excellent Monsieur.” Tony laid out Steve’s order primly and left the churros on the table between them. He dipped one in his coffee and leaned in. “So tell me this impossible skin care secret so I can pine in envy forever.”
“I won’t give the big speech, but here.” He put a little ring into Steve’s palm as he lead him out into the clear space that had become a dance floor. “You’re the best and you know it, and if I ever stop telling you or showing you for a second, kick me in the head.”
Tony slowly stopped shuddering and relaxed into Steve’s embrace with a deep sigh. He marveled for a minute at how dry his hand was before noticing the dramatic damp streak across the covers. He wiped at his eyes and chuckled.
Tony nodded and let his head pitch back towards Steve’s shoulder. He felt like his voice was coming right up his center from the taut electrical well that was churning right below his navel, and he breathed words into Steve’s ear in a rapture,
Tony held the sketches and looked up at Steve with hopeful interest. He scooted over a little on the sofa to conspicuously make room for Steve to sit with him. Steve easily took the spot next to him, and waited in anticipation for a reaction. Tony leaned back and regarded the sketches seriously one at a time. He nodded slowly.
Steve gets commissioned to do Tony's car design, and discovers something huge from drawing a rough sketch.
“It’s the truth. You may seem like an asshole on the outside, but you actually care so much and so deeply about people that Stane couldn’t even hope to match it. How could anyone with a heart look at a
“Um… is there a crowbar or something we can use?” Steve asked as he eyed the crate. Upon further inspection, the return address was Stark Industries.
Tony folded his arms and mulled the thought over without finding a conversational handle, so he just said. “Wow.”
Natasha had already contacted the major networks and promised them each a different sort of exclusive access to the story at a later date, in exchange for pulling Banner’s audio off the recording and transcripts as they ran with it. No one else had to be dragged into this mess because of Stane, and Natasha would keep it that way.
“Yeah. Tell me about it. I could sell everything I own and still not be able to pay the taxes if you declared this.”
Before Steve could decide, he snap-clapped out of his awkward paralysis and headed towards where Steve was sitting to try words. Words were good. He could do words.
Steve shifted so his arms were around Tony’s neck, and smiled up at him. “Kind of glad I got my proposal out of the way first.”
Tony nodded gravely and tried not to look too happy that for once it wasn’t him. “Wanna talk about it?”
“Yeah, totally, be right back.” Tony scythed through the crowd to the counter and over-ordered only slightly before he headed back to the table and sat down. “They’ll call. When it’s ready.”
“So…” Tony took a deep breath and mustered up his sincerity in a deep effort to drop his facade far enough that Steve might trust him. “I’m used to not needing to worry about money. And I get that that’s not everyone’s life, and there’s this big social dominance bullshit about money but, seriously, it would cost me far more to start trying to worry about money than it costs me to just pay for things, you know? Anyway, you got us this great table. You know what that’s worth in this town?”
“And you were afraid when you first found out Steve was your Romantic Soulmate. What does that tell you?”
Steve got the feeling that he was being watched, and when he looked up, he was, by Tony. They locked eyes, and didn’t say or do anything for a moment. Steve couldn’t believe they even made it this far… and how the hell did a guy like him get to be Soulmates with someone as good looking as that? He was in a hoodie with an ACDC logo, jeans, and looked incredibly nervous. Steve didn’t know what to do, so he awkwardly waved at Tony.
Bucky grabbed the heavy-duty stapler off the table and used it to hammer the lid of the crate back down like he was sealing the ark of the covenant.
Tony smiled, and dismounted from taking himself so seriously. “Well, don’t cry for me, Stevearino. I’ve had a lot of fun. And I’ve always thought that being in a bad relationship is a lot worse than being in no relationship. So I’m glad that I’ve had what I had, and I’m glad that I have what I have.”
Tony leered lovingly at Steve. “I was thinking tails. Would that be too much do you think, Luce? He’s got such a great behind and long waist, I kinda want to make the public work for it.”
Steve groaned, and couldn’t help but grab Tony’s cheeks in his hands and spread them to get a better view of where they were connected. Tony started to move at a steady rhythm, and it still felt so good. Steve let his fingers stray to where his cock was sliding into Tony, and pressed lightly at his boyfriend’s rim. He had a sudden need to get a finger in there too, but now wasn’t the time.
Steve sat down on the bed with a sigh. Even though Bucky was his Platonic Soulmate, he was probably right. Tony had made the effort after just seeing his sketches and a phone call, so there was probably hope. He looked down what he was wearing at the moment, sweats and a blue hoodie. Okay, he could put on the ripped skinny jeans with the hoodie and it could look cool but also laid back.
Steve and Tony had two more dates before Tony took Steve to his tailor. Steve was nervous about being fitted as a trans guy, but Tony seemed totally confident. He just hoped Tony was right about them not being judgemental.
Steve shrugged. “He said I could know anything I wanted, it’s just the first thing I could think of.”
Tony melted into the motion and relished the sense that Steve was going to do whatever he wanted. He reached down between them and ran his fingers lightly over the head of Steve’s prosthesis.
“Yeah, I’d love to. But tell me what you want and I’ll go order first. The food takes forever here but I promise it’s worth the wait.”
There was a small plastic pop and Steve could feel the way Tony’s lips went soft and quivery as he started to prep himself. Tony rocked slowly with his own touch, and his breath got warmer and ran deeper. He turned his head, eyes closed, to run his open mouth down the side of Steve’s shaft to his head, describing the motion of his fingers with the tip of his tongue, prodding and rolling.
Steve let out a breath when the door shut behind him. “Honestly, I was afraid he was going to try intimidation on you. The fact that he didn’t is a good sign.”
Tony begrudgingly fixes the arc reactor, Steve makes a friend out of catcalling weirdo, and they finally make contact.
Steve stared at Tony for a moment. He had no idea this meant so much to him, or how badly he dealt with the press. It sort of made sense why there wasn’t much worse scandals out there about him. But Steve was nothing if not stubborn, and when he cared about someone like he did Tony, he’d go to the ends of the Earth for them. He placed his hand over Tony’s.
Steve let go and looked back at the packers. “I won’t ask how much these cost, but this is really thoughtful of you. I didn’t think you’d do something like this… I guess I should have expected it after the painting.”
Clint nodded. “You’re probably better off not trying to figure out Bucky’s advice. He’s kinda stupid lately. Your sketches are good. You should take ‘em.”
Tony didn’t free his mouth up to reply, but nodded shortly with an affirmative moan. Steve roughly tugged on Tony’s hair to move him off and directed Tony to get on the bed on all fours. Tony obeyed, flushed and eager. He got down on his knees and elbows, and glanced back.
“I hear you. Ok.” Tony took another little step towards him and leaned a little to one side, cocking his head speculatively like he was thinking of giving Steve a kiss on the cheek and waiting for a cue as to whether it was all right.
Tony nodded, and tried his best not to be ridiculous, although it did make him a little jealous. With a smile of self-satire he growled,
“The best gift you could give me is another scandal so they stop harassing me.” Bruce said as he sat down and opened the box. Inside, there was a very expensive baseball cap with a physics equation on it, and some Louis Vuitton sunglasses. “You want me to keep a low profile by wearing expensive camouflage?”
Steve followed Tony to the kitchen and started wrapping up his steak dinner. It wouldn’t be as good as it was now after being refrigerated, but he wasn’t going to pass up the opportunity to eat with Tony. He got himself a glass of soda, some forks and spoons, and sat down at the table.
“Oh good. I’d kinda been given the opposite impression. Look, I’m sorry about the painting. I won’t bother you anymore.”
painting, probably worth hundreds of millions of dollars, and here it was in his crappy studio apartment. They hadn’t even met yet, why would Tony spend this kind of money on him?
Sam’s eyebrows lifted and he pursed his lips in appraisal. He nodded slowly. “Well, can’t argue with a feeling like that.”
This actually made Steve laughed. Why the hell were they being so childish? Steve was usually way more mature than this.
“The audio released means that my privacy was violated and what ought to be a personal matter is suddenly not. But yeah.” Tony gave a deliberately ambiguous answer since he knew they were going to spin it however they wanted anyway.
“And now you are gaslighting to the extreme. Why don’t you just make the first move and call Steve?”
Tony took Sam’s hand with a moment of trepidation, unsure whether he was the kind of guy to get into macho-hand-crush stuff with the new boyfriend, but Sam’s handshake was just firm and assured. Tony nodded.
Tony stopped dithering long enough for his deeper anxieties to rise to the surface. “Yeah, I hear you. I guess I just feel like… I mean I feel like I already know him so well. And I know that no matter how I frame it he’s gonna say fuck the world and suit up with me in the best tuxes money can buy, and he’s not ever gonna blame me for what happens next. And I feel like, knowing that as clearly as I do, all I’m really doing is passing the buck if I ask him. I’m asking him to sign off on probably the worst decision of his life just so I can claim later that it’s not my fault, that he made a choice. When you and I both know, he won’t be making a choice.”
Tony put his arms gingerly around Steve and murmured into the scent of his hair, “Yeah. We’re safe.”
Steve couldn’t help but kiss him in that moment. Somehow, the word ‘amazing’ kept replaying in his head as he kissed him. Because that’s what Tony was, amazing and handsome as hell. He pulled back and said,
Tony Stark has a brand new car, and he needs a design. His assistant Natasha Barnes has someone in mind.
Bruce looked red faced and his posture said he was about to break something. And given that there was some broken glass near his bookcase which looked like the remnants of a cup, he’d probably done that already. Tony tried to keep an up energy, the better to let Bruce vent at him.
Steve went over to the coffee table and picked up his school sketchbook. He opened it to the page of rough sketches, mainly of the arc reactor. His instructor wanted him to draw something mechanical and complicated, so it made sense to use Tony’s invention. And Jarvis was a great help projecting file photos of the plant. He handed the sketches to Tony.
“You see? See that’s how I know you don’t get it. Not everything has to be about results, sometimes you can do things just to put them out there into the universe and just let them go.”
“I, um… could we…” He huffed a laugh at himself, trying to lighten the mood enough to think. “Could we go out and do this in front of the whole party? I mean, I’m going to say yes, I just love the attention and I wanna see Barnes’ face when you say I’m the most amazing man you’ve ever met.” He smiled sheepishly.
“Heart murmur, several cases of the flu, asthma, scoliosis, scarlet fever, deafness in my left ear from an infection, horrible vision, but I don’t even know if I named them all.” He hadn’t, but the last one would wait for a while.
Tony shook his head. “See, that’s something I don’t get about you normal people. Why would you ever not spice anything up? It’s not like we eat plain mashed potatoes most of the time and only have tacos once we get dangerously bored.”
Steve spit out his beer in shock and started coughing. “Jesus, Clint. Realize, Tony will want to take pictures of that if he finds out. In the name of research and liability.”
Tony softened a little and leaned forward with his forearms on the table. “That’s fair. If you’re not prepared to trust me, I get that there’s not a lot I can say that you wouldn’t just take as some kind of line, though. And to be honest this is my first time doing this highly specific kind of weirdness myself, so anything I try to tell you about how I am with a Romantic Soulmate would be me talking out my ass anyway. But lemme ask you. Do you really think that’s what’s gonna happen here? I mean, I’m not gonna walk if the answer is yes, I just wanna know what I’m starting from. Do you think that’s what I’m gonna do?”
“Why?” Clint didn’t bother to stop ogling his own boyfriend as he leaned over to pull out a spark conduit.
A text came in on Steve’s phone, which happened to be on the floor, and he chuckled. “Apparently Nat is recording this via Jarvis. And she insists nothing else.”
“Not sure. I’m pretty sure there’s one lady who dropped a car off this morning that was prodding me for information about who was around. But if she’s press it means they haven’t zeroed in on you as the most likely suspect yet. They’re just sniffing.”
“Well apparently celebrities do this a lot. When the news cycle gets too aggressive, they hide out until it blows over. Tony just didn’t want me tracked by paparazzi, and Bucky… I’m just thankful nothing has triggered an episode yet. Not to mention Tony made sure he couldn’t access the cameras no matter what. He just doesn’t want me hounded by the press.”
Something shifted inside Tony, and he felt braver. It was still likely to be awful, but Steve’s calm assuring voice carried the promise of
“I guess fate put that together for you because of this. Otherwise, it’d have just been Nat, Wade, Cable, and Domino. And we wouldn’t have been able to find you as quickly as we did.”
Tony’s throat felt too tight to respond. He pressed his lips together and tried to keep his eyes from overflowing. He cleared his throat.
Tony smiled. “Honestly, I’m not. I actually love this part. I love that you tell me when stuff bothers you. It makes me feel like we’re both invested in trying again.”
“Well, the secret to leading is mostly in knowing that your partner wants you to; that they’re in your arms and they’re rooting for you, and you can bring them along on something wonderful. I think you’d be great at that.”
And in celebration of the first set of prosthetics being launched, there was a launch party at Tony’s apartment for friends and family.
“Well, my assistant just told me it upset you, and she knows everything so, yanno, I’m just trying to apologize and stop making life so inconvenient among your circle of friends.”
“Yeah. I’d like that. But, listen, you should know about me, right up front, if you didn’t already, I’m kind of a pretentious asshole. Like, I practically re-invented the form for my generation. I get all antsy in public. People get touchy and stuff. So, if it wouldn’t make you feel too, I dunno, bribed or whatever, would you let me take you for coffee my way? No strings, gold or otherwise, I swear to god. I just want to have a snowball’s chance of acting like myself.”
Steve chuckled, and did have one question in particular. “Why did you sleep with all of those people? What exactly was the goal with that?”
Tony’s voice had gotten pretty rough after he’d had an hour to rest and calm down. He hadn’t realized how much he must have been yelling at some point. Or maybe it was smoke inhalation. He hoped it was smoke inhalation. He managed a smile for Steve, though, and croaked as he came close,
Steve took a deep breath despite the slight blush on his cheeks. “How many people has he had sex with?”
Tony laughed. “Well yeah, that’s the tradition, right? One week anniversary is post-impressionist art treasures, two month anniversary is latex genitals.”
Steve ran his cock over Tony’s cheek, and relished in the realistic sensation of Tony’s skin against the head. “And you’ll fuck yourself on your fingers, so you’re halfway there when I’m ready.”
Tony pressed his lips together, letting a little sincerity seep through. “I’m really sorry, man. Not in a way that you have to make me feel better about or anything, I just am. I’ll try to do better in the future.” As Bruce opened his mouth to reply he continued hastily. “Also I need your advice.”
Tony chuckled ruefully. “The guy with broken glass and reporter urine all over his floor thinks I’m being a catastrophist. Great.”
Tony walked sheepishly towards Bruce’s door, but the screw-head in him couldn’t help affecting a nasal tone as he called out, “Doctor Banner? I’m with the Daily Chatter…”
Clint smiled warmly and nudged Steve’s shin with his toe. “It’s ok. I’m just glad the last month’s craziness is settling out a little. And all for the better it seems like. I mean, Bucky’s still a little… Bucky, about stuff, but I think being confused about being with me is easier on him than being confused in a completely random and overwhelming way.”
Tony nodded. “I hear you. I hear you. So, yeah, just, sorry for the whole mix-up. It’s not you it’s me, yatta yatta yatta, I get it.”
Tony gave a small fluttering laugh. “Well that was underwhelming after so much build-up. Was it good for you?”
He gathered a tray with two cups of gelato, two cannoli, one latte, one hot chocolate, and a packet of mini-churros. He pirouetted his way back to the table through the crowd and set it down with a flair.
Steve cringed at the memories that came along with Bucky’s arm. All of those months trying different antidepressants, going from therapist to therapist, nightmares of gunfire and smoke. It was hard to get through, but Steve stayed by Bucky’s side through all of it. Bucky getting over his PTSD was so much harder than getting used to using one arm.
“He stressed-out a little yesterday morning, but there were no hallucinations or panic spikes, which his doc says is actually a good sign, that there’s some room there between having an intense reaction and having a full episode. We handled it. He couldn’t…” He grinned at his hands. “He couldn’t get why he was still feeling so unsettled and weird if you were doing ok. And I finally stopped being a dipshit and realized he was having feelings, he just wasn’t trusting them or showing them. And it was stressing him out. So I bit the bullet and told him what I thought it was.”
Tony cleared his throat, trying not to stare. He wasn’t prepared for the charming little way the edges of Steve’s mouth moved when he talked. Not in conjunction with the full brunt of that voice, unmediated by the tinniness of cell phones. Fortunately his years as a (highly neurotic) international businessman had taught him a lot of tools for breaking up interpersonal stage-fright.
Tony laughed, “Clearly we need a wedding big enough to be covered by the international press. Just to make sure he sees.”
