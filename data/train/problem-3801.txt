,” Cas replied back almost hungrily and those words sent a painful pang through Dean’s chest because even through the hunger in Cas’ voice Dean could hear the adoration.
…they were actually in the air. The best for Dean to do was to sit back and not look out the window, looking out the window meant seeing how high up they were and that was
“Oh fuck, I bet you played polo.” Dean said. By this point, they had been jogging for a while and Dean knew they would need to get back to the mansion soon but he was actually having a good time talking to Cas.
Castiel stood in front of the headstone in silence for several minutes, all Dean could hear was the sound of the wind rustling through the trees. Even Castiel’s soul was quiet.
"Good morning my little rays of sunshine!" Gabriel called when Dean and Cas walked into the kitchen.
"Oh I think you've done enough already don’t you?" Castiel heard Anna snap at Dean as she started dragging Castiel towards her car. What Anna meant by that was beyond Castiel and he was going to tell Anna not to snap at Dean, that was more his job and even then it was only mockingly, but the fierce look on her face told Castiel that even when drunk it was not a good time to say anything to Anna which could result in her making Castiel sleep off his hangover in the old workshop that was at the end of Anna's garden and seemed like a breeding ground for spiders.
“Really wrong, or just mildly wrong?” Dean asked as he traced figures of eight in the small of Cas’ back. It was very distracting and goosebumps flared over Cas’ skin. “You know Bela. She’s probably just freaking over something stupid, just ignore it," Dean said.
Dean woke to a strong arm wrapped around his chest, pulling him inwards so his back is flushed against Cas' chest. He would have complained bitterly about having to be the little spoon but it actually felt damn nice having Cas' arms wrapped around him, legs tangled together and Cas' face buried in the crook of Dean's neck.
Dean had barely slept for a few hours before his whole trailer filled with the sound of his alarm. It beeped loudly until Dean heard a grumble followed by his phone being silenced. A warm arm snaked across Dean's stomach, pulling him close as a head rested upon his chest.
"No, Nana Novak hasn’t died.” Castiel said rolling his eyes. “I got a letter this morning from the Minneapolis College of Art and Design actually." Castiel said pointedly. Anna’s eyes grew wide and she couldn’t hide the smile on her face.
Dean lifted his head to see which one of the girls had spoken. Amelia. A tall, composed woman with ‘wife material’ practically stamped across her forehead. Dean could see why Josie selected her for the show.
Cas was glad he had his tie to focus on because otherwise, his brain would have short-circuited. Dean Winchester in dance clothes was one thing, but Dean Winchester in a suit was on a whole other scale. The suit fitted him perfectly, showcasing his broad shoulders and strong thighs. Jesus, Cas didn’t know where to look.
“Honestly I’m more nervous than excited. Jimmy and I would have been just as happy with a small family meal but your mother was convinced on having a huge party. I swear most of the people she’s invited are her friends.”
There was some resentment in the look he gave Dean, he must not have been over whatever happened between them the night before.
"Shit, that's rough man...look do you want to stay here for the night? It's pretty fucking late anyway and I doubt you'd want to go home right now when your brothers are fighting. You can sleep on the couch if you want. It’s a damn comfy couch, I mean it has to be for the amount of times that Charlie has fallen asleep on it in the past during some TV show marathon.”
Tonight the ballroom had been transformed into a sophisticated looking room festooned with silver decorations. Waiters and waitresses floated around the room holding trays of delicate canapés or overpriced champagne. A large banner hung across the furthest wall spelling out ‘
He wasn’t even going to bother complaining as it had been many hours since he’d last kissed Cas and it was long overdue. With careful and deft hands Cas removed Dean’s coat and his hands so slid under Dean’s scrub top. Dean’s breath caught in his throat as his skin reacted to the touch. Muscles jumped as Cas’ fingers ghosted over them and without even thinking about it Dean found himself pushing Cas gently towards the nearest bunk. If they were going to do the whole ‘making out in the on-call room’ then they were going to do it properly. With nimble hands Dean pulled his scrub top over his head and threw it onto the floor, smirking ever so as he watched Cas’ eyes roam over his chest.
." He gasped out as Cas slowly found a rhythm. It was achingly slow, almost as if he was doing it on purpose to make Dean fall apart. Dean gripped onto Cas' thighs, hot and damp from sweat as the pace quickened. "Holy shit." He heard himself gasp out, fingers digging into Cas' skin. Holy shit, he was so close already.
With a stomach full of lead Castiel turned away from the road and looked up at Anna’s house yet again. He was so close to seeing his family and that pushed him into walking up the pathway to knock on the front door. The water hit him square in the face as soon as the door opened. Anna had only just started reciting the demon banishing chant when Castiel held up his hands stopping her.
“Do you want to go back to bed?” Dean asked as the two of them sat there on the roof, just watching the city go by despite the lateness of the hour.
“Holy shit, your bed is being graced with your presence tonight?” Jo said clutching her hand to her chest sarcastically. “Did you get sick of the hospital beds or something?” she questioned.
"Sorting shit out so Dad and Michael don't kill you. I was at home when the school left a message; I deleted it before Dad or Michael could hear and came right here."
“That’s pure bullshit. I've heard his prayers.” Dean snapped. “Just let us save him; it cannot possibly be God’s word to have him left there. Let us go and save him.”
The grave was simple. Two fallen branches tied together with twine to create a cross. The only way Castiel could tell that it was his own grave was the clawed away earth and the words scratched onto a piece of bark nailed to the cross:
There was loud music coming from the apartment, loud enough to be heard out in the hall, as Dean got out of the elevator from a long shift at the hospital. The music was frantic classical, a heavy swelling score with crashing crescendos that made Dean's teeth rattle. Something had to be wrong, Dean knew it instantly as soon as he recognised the piece playing. It was one of Cas’ favourites but he only ever really played it if he was frustrated, he claimed it helped to soothe him.
"Yeah, it's all good." Dean lied smoothly hoping that Josie couldn't see through him. When she raised a perfectly plucked eyebrow Dean sighed. "Seriously Josie, I'm fine. It's all good. Castiel is going to do whatever I tell him today. You'll get your hot library date."
“Drink your diet mountain dew and suck it up, princess.” Meg retorted. “Anyway, why are we glossing over the most important part of this whole thing?" she then asked. Dean looked at her questioningly. "I never pegged you as a bottom. Pun intended."
“Dealing with all this shit.” Dean said with a shrug. Jo raised her eyebrows as if to say that she didn’t believe him in the slightest. “Jo, I’m fine.” Dean said.
“First girl, go.” Dean said into his own mic. The limo door opened and Anna gracefully stepped out. Several members of the crew let out whistled. She was gorgeous, Dean wasn’t about to lie and say she wasn’t. She rocked the willowy red head look for all it was worth and the deep green of her floor-length ball gown looked great on camera.
"One of the women in the group replied with an angry face," Castiel said, shoving the phone over into Sam's space. "What about this photo could possibly illicit such anger?"
Claire, Kaia, Alex, Mary and Eileen all gave the redhead blank stares. Claire whispered to her girlfriend, "I bet its filled with curses." Kaia giggled back, "or a monkey paw."
Dean had dreamed many things over the past six months. He had dreamed of finding the perfect secret spell, of breaking into The Empty, of vanquishing that which held Cas against his will, and taking him home triumphantly in an against-all-odds rescue. Of rousing epic speeches and heartfelt words and saying all of the right things. Of Cas agreeing to stay and never leaving again. Never leaving
"Come on, Cas," Dean pleaded playfully, handing the small outfit set to his baby-mamma. "What's wrong with it?"
The former angel nodded, “Jack gave me a choice. Is going to give them all the same choice actually. As far I as am aware, I am the only one who has said yes.”
"Claire, it's beautiful," Castiel said sincerely, holding up the baby-sized trench coat so the rest could see. "Thank you."
The bunker did have a bit of a communal shower situation going on. Dean pondered as he and Cas walked down the hallway—
As they pulled out in the road, Sam shuffled around in the passenger seat trying to get his cell out of his pocket and started dialing.
Jack sighed in disappointment as Raphael—sans angel blade—still chose to lunge at Castiel—earning a one way trip to
Cas still tasted like freshly cooked eggs, and Dean was sure he still tasted like whiskey, barely covered up by coffee and bacon—well
"Hi, Sam," the angel greeted, completely unfazed, yet having enough modesty to partially pull the blanket over himself.
“Cas—” Dean felt like sobbing again. Cas chose this. Chose to give up everything in Heaven to come back to him.
Dean moved Jack's hands away from his ears as he walked to the other side of the kitchen to get a plate.
"Oh, right," the Winchester mumbled, snaking a hand in-between them where they connected to rub circles around just the right spot—
The hunter grumbled slightly, finding a more comfortable position using Castiel's breasts as a pillow.
Dean watched on in horror as the gentle blue glow above them was engulfed in its entirety by the infinite blackness and pulled backwards towards The Empty.
“But what of us,” one angel asked, “my garrison carried out the orders of archangels, where are they?”
Dean turned another page then glanced up from his book to study the woman-shaped form of Castiel. The Winchester was still dumbstruck by their situation, a look of shame passing over his face.
Every chance encounter, every random woman he went home with, every back alley liaison—as soon as things got heated, without fail, he would have a condom whipped out and ready to go. And if he wasn't packing, well—sex without protection was always a no-go.
Dean downed the last of the water. “The kid came through after all.” He stared at the empty glass. He prayed every night for so long. Prayed to Cas. Bared his whole heart. Prayed so much.
“Oh, hey little bro—” Gabe greeted cautiously, looking from Castiel to Jack. “Nephew—good to see you again. Thanks for the jail-break by the way—”
After a moment she popped up with a huff—hair now sticking up comically in several different directions. As Naomi attempted to navigate out of the maze of corn, she became increasingly aware of some very annoying music grating at her ears—and it was only getting louder.
”You are a good big brother, but I’m pretty sure he’s just hungry,” the angel explained, picking up the small babe and offering a bottle.
"Cas," Dean let out a shaky breath that he didn't realize he had been holding in. "What happened to you?"
There was a faint glow coming from the edges of his vision. But there should be no light in the void.
"How was I supposed to know!" Sam complained. "You guys have been staring at each other with the same goo goo eyes for years!"
"I—don't know," the nephilim responded slowly, lowering his hand. "I sensed something—odd—for a moment, or at least I thought I did."
“Oh! Oh!” The angel exclaimed, as the baby started fully crowning, and a soft light started to glow.
"See, Dean, it's a bee," Castiel explained when the hunter didn't react immediately, "it's got a hoodie and even a soft stinger on the—"
“See, I figure that if you hadn’t lobotomized Castiel’s brain so bad maybe he wouldn’t have become such a
"May cause hallucinations?" The hunter snorted as he read the fine print, muttering, "That's the last time I take any of this sinus crap. I'd rather sneeze my brains out."
“I met your boy, Jack by the way,” Crowley said, gesturing to Dean and Castiel. “I must say I am curious as to the logistics of how you two managed to make—”
Castiel immediately dialed Dean’s number. And then Dean’s other phone—even going as far as Dean’s other-
"Apparently," Sam nodded, "some sort of family squabble in their pack. He wants us to help track down the kid before he hurts himself or someone else or—"
“Eh,” Balthazar shrugged giving Cas a pat on the back and shooting a nervous look over at Jack. “What’s a good stabbing between friends, right?”
Finding Dean’s bedroom empty, Sam rushed into the main map-table room, to see his brother passed out on the table, a mostly empty bottle of whiskey turned over and dripping on the floor. Dean’s phone was also in the middle of the floor halfway on the other side of the room, surrounded by a variety of empty bottles.
A tall glass of water was sitting next to the clock, along with his cell phone and a hastily scrawled note.
"It's over. None of that happened," Cas reassured, stepping back to look his future husband in the eyes, "We're together. And I love you."
"Hm," Dean pondered for a moment before grinning widely, "only if we can give him the middle name Tiberius."
"The vessel itself was not damaged," the angel explained. "In such a case, my residual grace is enough to 'keep the lights on' as you say."
"The most important thing I think we need to ask is—do you want this baby?" Mary said with a comforting smile.
Behind them The Empty bubbled and boiled, another tendril from the dark preparing it's final strike, readying to take its final victim.
The freshly formed God frowned at the way this angry, lady-shaped angel was speaking to his favorite dad. He wasn’t going to allow that.
"There was so much more, Cas, it seemed so real," Dean sobbed into the man's wet shoulder, beads of water still dripping from his hair, "There was Sam and Jack and, and Chuck-he, he Thanos-snapped everyone we cared about to death. But then Jack pulled a Tony Stark and brought everyone back-well almost everyone-you were still dead. Then like a week later a rusty nail killed me on a routine vamp hunt with Sam. Then Sam got married to some chick, oh man, I don't even know-"
They both stood side-by-side, staring at Castiel's previous form which lay quietly on the bed before them. The rest of the room was mostly bare—it being one of the several unclaimed bedrooms in the bunker.
"I had a nightmare, a terrible nightmare," Dean sighed deeply, closing his eyes. "I dreamed that we were in the bunker, and you were leaving with The Empty, and Billie was was going to kill us, and you pushed me down, you pushed me out of the way, and then she was killed but The Empty engulfed you and then it dragged you away."
“No, it was a flight of stairs. Told the young lad he might as well have installed a stripper pole.”
“Time passes differently for me, now, even more so than it does in Heaven.” The young God looked pained. “At first, Dean prayed regularly, often, but now, recently the prayers have stopped. He is alive as he is not here. But the details are lost to me now.”
The first thing Castiel became aware of was the murmur of thousands of voices all around him and a blindingly bright light.
"It's still a bit early to be thinking about," Mary added, "since you are still in your first trimester, but towards the end of your pregnancy, would you like us to throw you a shower?"
The witch materialized a chair from thin air and continued ranting about how much she hated Rowena to her captive audience of two, giving zero fucks about the death glare Sam was shooting her as he listened to his brother shout profanities in-between Dean describing all of the ways he was going to murder this bitch for what she did to his angel.
Sam’s face turned beat red, promptly turning tail, determined to leave and go visit Eileen for at least a week.
"Technically, I am now capable of leaving this body," the angel frowned with a pained expression as he answered, "but our baby would die."
Castiel barely had a chance to shoot a death-glare at the archangel before Lucifer too vanished with a wave of Jack’s hand.
It was safe to say that Dean had finally remembered that important thing that he had forgotten—and had repeatedly kept forgetting.
The Winchesters barely managed to close their eyes before the room was engulfed in a bright light which then faded moments later towards the ceiling, leaving Castiel's body motionless on the floor.
With eyes glowing from the effort, a final push freed the shoulders, the rest spilling out onto the bed.
”Cas, please don’t stop, can’t the baby wait for two seconds,” Dean complained, “I was almost there.”
The bunker door swung open as Dean and Sam entered, carefully navigating down the stairs while hauling Castiel's empty shell in-between them.
In the background the angel was now doing some very weird things with his tongue trying to get every last drop of honey from the container.
The angel frowned with concern, closing the distance to put a comforting hand on Dean's shoulder, rubbing gentle circles, as the man stared at the floor and tried to gather his thoughts.
The first thing he became aware of was how warm and content he felt. He had said his piece to Dean, and now he could rest.
As Cas continued to stare at him, Dean suddenly realized he had not even hugged the man properly since he got back—drunken cuddles notwithstanding.
"I read that humans like to name their children with a theme or pattern," Castiel continued, "so I was thinking of a name that would fit with Jack."
of all people. And after the angel’s sacrifice he knew why—Cas’ words had been running through his head every day since. But that didn’t mean it was any easier for Dean to believe.
This time it’s Dean’s turn to stare at Cas while he eats, the former angel seeming to marvel at the taste of every bite.
Cas cried out as the last drops of his grace were ripped painfully from him by the force of the retreating darkness. The Empty had finally claimed him, but only that small part of him it was entitled to.
"Nephilim," Castiel swallowed hard before looking over at the older Winchester. "Dean, I think I may be pregnant."
"So you can see why it's not really a good time for me to come out to the cabin," she continued, choosing to completely ignore Bobby's comment.
“Dean?” Castiel questioned as the hunter pulled his arm forward until the former angel’s chest was up against Dean’s back.
The corner of Castiel’s mouth crooked into a smile as he looked upon the peanut butter and jelly sandwich in his hand.
Castiel draped a blanket over Dean’s half asleep form, satisfied that the man was comfortable, but as he turned to leave, the hunter grasped his wrist suddenly.
"Stay with me, Cas!" Dean pleaded as Cas closed his eyes, the world going dark to the sounds of the echoing vibrations.
They kissed right there in the middle of the kitchen, no longer caring that the others were staring.
For a few minutes Cas gently fought with Dean to try and get him up out of the chair and to somewhere else better to rest before realizing his coat was quite warm now inside the bunker. The former angel paused to shrug off his trench-coat and place it on a nearby chair when he turned to find Dean staring at him through blurry eyes.
Castiel’s head spun at that, suddenly replaying in his mind the time he himself was declared God and murdered several thousand of the very same resurrected angels that now surrounded him.
“Jack figured out how to dissolve The Empty,” Castiel explained, voice filled with pride. “Every angel and demon who ever lived returned to Heaven and Hell. And both realms are now permanently sealed. No more angels on earth.”
Moments later Castiel let his wings fall away as the tiny babe’s green eyes fluttered open, a piercing cry filling the room.
A few months ago, before he gave up on everything, Dean had all sorts of plans for what he would say to Cas once he was rescued and safe. How he would confess his feelings, tell him to stay, and so on.
They fell onto the motel bed in a passionate embrace. Forgotten on the dresser sat two cowboy hats and matching themed clothes ready for a fun day out in Dallas, Texas-that cowboy themed wedding venue wasn't going to find itself.
The former angel gripped at Dean’s hair for dear life as the hunter did the same to Castiel’s hips, holding him steady while he sucked him clean.
Dean was frozen in place, his mind racing, barely even registering all of the nice things Cas was saying about him, because after the first few words, he could only focus on one thing.
"I miss my cock," the angel said after a moment, staring at Dean hungrily, "because I'd really like to fuck you right now."
Dean watched as their savior walked over to the twitching form of the witch to finish the job with the familiar glow of a quick smiting. As soon as her life was extinguished, the spell faded completely.
"I will admit though," the Winchester said playfully, in-between kisses planted on his angel, "that I do miss those blue eyes of yours."
"Thank you, Mary," Castiel said appreciatively, before frowning at the other two Winchesters. "Was that really so difficult to explain?"
Sitting at the map table was a heavily-pregnant, dark-haired woman that Jody had never seen before, and she was currently eating honey directly out of a large glass jar.
Just as soon as it started, it had stopped. He felt mild concern for a moment, before several fish startled by the impact of the water jumped right up into his boat.
Sandwich devoured, Cas took to looking out of the window and just marveling at the fact that he was alive. And, that he was human.
The hunter stared with a mix of shock and relief as the man who was sometimes more human than angel these days continued to soap himself.
“Perhaps you should slow down on the bacon, Dean. I don’t want you to die from cardiac arrest so soon after saving your life.”
"Jack, go with Cas to the store," the hunter said after a moment. "You can already start being a good big brother by keeping an eye out for them before they are even born."
"I don't mean to interrupt you, Dean" Castiel said softly, looking up at the blushing man currently straddling him on the bed, the hunter’s hands shakily trying to tear open a condom wrapper that was being particularly difficult.
“Of course not. After I finished fixing the universe, I set everything to—I guess you could say—autopilot. Then I separated that which you would consider God from myself. But I knew it was too dangerous to leave in one place. So I split the energy into six different pieces and scattered them all to the far corners of the universe. My grace here was the last part.” Jack smiled widely, super proud of himself and his explanation. “I got the idea from a movie I saw.”
"One moment," replied a gruff voice that was several octaves deeper than what one would expect from such a petite woman.
"Jody," Castiel interrupted, "since you are here, I'd like to go ahead and invite you to my baby shower. All of you, Claire, the girls—and Donna if you could let her know too."
"My grace was burning as some side effect from the spell, and I couldn't stop it," Castiel explained, as Sam also sat down to join them. "I had to find a new vessel immediately or die."
Sure enough, after a long decent, Castiel popped out at Heaven’s playground entrance on Earth, nearly taking out a small child in the process, earning him an angry stare from who was presumably the child’s mother.
Cas stepped around them and walked to the black 1967 Chevy Impala, smiling when his husband popped his head up from under her open hood. Beaming, Dean crossed over to Castiel, pulling him in by his waist and pressing their lips together.
Jack Kline smiled brightly, standing on his tiptoes and reaching above him, attempting to hook the crappy target stocking above the large fireplace. Cas moved up to help him, standing beside the Nephilim to attach another stocking to the mantle. Dean craned his neck around to admire the back of his boyfriend, taking another sip of his whiskey-spiked coffee.
And yet when that alpha bastard had kicked Sam, Gabriel had growled like it was a friend that had been hurt. For god's sake, he hasn’t even had a conversation with the man.
“Cookies are ready!” He said cheerfully. “C’mon, Samalam, help me get them outta the oven.” When Gabe and Sam disappeared into the kitchen, Cas and Dean sat down at the table and Jack jogged forward to join them, grabbing the open bag of gummy worms and popping a few into his mouth.
“You’re not going.” Dean repeated. “I’m getting you outta here.” At this Sam sat up straight, staring at his older brother.
Gabe looked over to Sam, who was quite pale, twisting a pillowcase in his hands. He rested a hand gently on the alphas arm, leaning over. “You okay?” He whispered softly to him, gaining a curious look from Cas and a casual ‘remember, hurt him and I kill you’ look from Dean. He ignored them and continued to glance worriedly at Sam, who nodded once before shaking his head twice, bending down slightly so he could reply to Gabe.
Cas, who was now flush against Dean's chest, glared at him, pulling away but keeping one of his hands tight on Dean's side, frowning at the blood-soaked fabric that resided there.
“I’m… sorry,” He said softly, and the others nodded in agreement, feeling awkward. “But…how are you helping? The omegas in training centers, I mean. How do you get them out?”
He turned slightly to look at Castiel, who was in a similar position as him, face pressed into his pillow as he stared at his boyfriend sleepily. Cas didn’t answer him however and simply shrugged, running his fingers through his boyfriend's muddy blond hair.
“What do you think?” He asked, frowning slightly. Everyone turned to examine the mantle, and after a second nodded.
“I, uh, went through a bee phase. Stupid, I know,” he said, laughing, but it sounded forced. Dean smiled softly at Castiel, admiring the omega.
“Hey, you’re still sad! Why? Was it me? Wait… if it is me, I’m not sorry! Well, I mean, it’s not really your fault, but—”
“C’mon,” Dean repeated, pushing the door to his bedroom open. “I’m gonna try helping you.” Cas paused then shook his head.
“Yes...I am okay, I think. I’m, uh, sorry that I cannot help you, Dean,” He says softly, and he does feel guilty. If he still had his grace, Castiel would be able to at least ease Dean’s nightmares, keep them at bay. But now, freshly human, he could do nothing to help the human get the sleep he needed and deserved.
“Uh… because I’m an alpha magnet?” He half-heartedly joked, trying to come up with something to say. But his attempt at an ice breaker just seemed to make Sam more uncomfortable.
After he found it, Sam would spend as many hours as he could just staring out the window. It filled Dean with more guilt than usual every time he saw Sam by that window. It proved that he had gotten his little brother captured, and that it was his fault that Sammy would probably never actually go outside of his free will ever again.
“What can I say? The holiday cheer got to me too,” He teased, yawning before letting out a frustrated huff. “Dear god are we old. Not even 9 o’clock yet and I’m exhausted.” Cas rolled his eyes.
Thank you so much for those of you who are sticking through this hectic and weirdness, I appreciate it.
“Yeah, she’s been oddly fixated on that for some reason.” He smiled to himself as he felt Dean’s arm slip around his waist, the man placing his chin on his husband's shoulder. “I love you,” He murmured to Dean, cheeks light red.
Dean growled through gritted teeth. “You mean like those shitty omega ‘training’ facilities?” Azazel clapped sarcastically.
Giving three to Cas, Dean stuck the other two in the snowman’s face, giving it eyes. Cas placed the other three to form a mouth, and then they both sat back and smiled at their creation.
“Hey Gabe, how’re you?” He asked, moving to shake the other man’s hand. Gabriel grinned back at him.
“Thank you,” He said, before turning around and grabbing another packet of the powdered hot chocolate Gabriel had snapped into existence the other day.
Dean smiled softly into his plush pillow, pressing his cheek even further into it as he feels his angels fingers massage his scalp. “Not that I’m complaining’, sweetheart,” he began, smiling softly. “But what’re you doing there?”
Azazel sighed. “Whatever. I mean, even though me myself was put out of business years ago by dear old Johnny, Alastair and Asmodeus weren’t. And isn’t that just delightful?” He did a playful skip-and-a-jump. “You really should’ve thought to think that I work for a training facility, Dean-o. I mean, we’re only a couple of miles out from the Company, and I don’t think they’ll just let you walk after killing their best hunter.”
And he remembers his mother and father's blood, staining the plush carpet he loved laying down on and pretending he could make snow angels.
“Sammy? You okay?” Dean asked softly, obviously worried. Blinking up at his older brother, Sam simply tilted his head slightly.
The two jumped about three feet in the air and Cas lunged to grip one of the guns tightly, and Dean gently grabbed his wrist.
And then the alpha left, Sam shaking with fright and shock, still trying to process things, and Dean shaking with rage. Dean had been an early bloomer, and had presented as an alpha a mere week before. Sam was sure that if he hadn’t been around, Dean would’ve jumped right into the fray, defending his parents to the best of his ability and gotten himself killed, too.
Dean scoffed to himself, shaking his head. Gabriel had done a good job raising Castiel. You don’t come by omegas like Cas very often. Noticing the two guards that had ‘helped’ him escort the Novak’s to Alastair earlier, Dean pushed the omega out of his head. No time for that now. As he drew closer, he greeted them.
“But—“ Dean growled out a warning and the two scattered, leaving him alone with the three omegas. As soon as the door shut, Dean dropped to his knees in front of their cell, taking out his keys and undoing the lock.
Gabriel woke up to his little brother curled into his side and purring softly. Turning to curl around Cas, Gabe purred softly back.
“No…” He murmured, concerned. “I saw him earlier running towards the cells, but I haven’t seen him since. You haven’t…?” Dean, who had clearly picked up on Gabe’s concern for his brother but thankfully decided not to comment on it instead shook his head.
“Trust me, Gabe wasn’t lying when he said he’d shoot us.” Dean let out a short laugh, but it quickly turned into a grimace when his side lit up in pain as if on fire. Cas looked up at him, worry in his eyes, and applied more pressure to the wound.
Dean backtracks, raising his eyebrows at Gabriel. “I’m… what?” He asks and Gabe crosses his arms, scowling slightly.
“Right,” he said, and unlike Castiel, he couldn’t seem to stop staring at him. Gabriel couldn’t read his expression by just Dean's eyes, but he seemed surprised, as if he didn’t expect the omega to fall.
“Yes, I can’t believe I hadn’t thought of that!” He exclaimed happily, and started typing on his computer, no doubt looking for potential omega buyers. But then his hands stilled on the keyboard. He frowned.
I mean, Kevin barely tolerated him, and that was just for Sam. Slowly getting more and more repulsed by his appearance, he turned away from the mirror and pulled off his shirt, ignoring the bruises and raised skin from scars, along with the occasional cigarette burns from his ‘colleagues’.
I know this is kinda short and kinda sucks, but honestly I’m just spitballing and hoping for the best.
The angel squeezed his eyes shut, taking in a rattling breath. “Sometimes, I’m just so freaking scared that you’re going to… leave. Go off, say that you never loved me to begin with. And—and it hurts. It hurts, Dean, and I can’t… I can’t…” Cas’ breaths were getting more frantic, and Dean hurriedly pressed his hand to his chest, exaggerating his breathing yet again.
“Hey, I get it. You’re not the only one who walked in on it.” Dean slammed the wine glass back down, which was drained completely.
They stayed silent for half a second, just staring out into the large Singers Salvage yard before Gabe cleared his throat, fishing a sucker (which he had pretty much mugged Alex for) out of his pocket and extending it out to Sam, who looked at it and then him, eyebrows raised.
Castiel hummed, patting the snow in front of him firmly as he packed the fluffy white stuff into a ball. Dean sat cross-legged across from him, also molding snow to the best of his ability. “Why are we doing this again?” He asked, voice more amused than frustrated. Cas answered happily.
“You put ‘em on your cookies, Cas. After they get out of the oven, that is.” Cas simply frowned again as he set the bag back down on the bunker table.
“Down to dinner?” He ask, smiling shyly. Dean shrugs, leaning forward to catch his angel in another kiss.
“Hey Cas,” Dean sighed from behind him suddenly, causing the ex-angel to jerk up in surprise at his voice. “What’re you doin’ up?” The human asked as he passed him at the kitchen table, going over to where the cereal boxes resided in the cupboards.
“No kidding, Kitten,” He replied, glancing down at Castiel’s sweater. Cas let out a soft giggle at the nickname, burrowing his face in Dean’s neck. “What?” He defended, pouting. Cas, still giggling, pulled back from Dean’s neck.
“It’s okay.” He told his angel, rubbing a thumb over Castiel's cheekbone. “If you can’t remember, I’ll teach you, and if you just can’t, then I’ll help you until you can.” The love, the adoration, and care in the human's eyes were too much for Cas to bear.
Dean led him down the hall, his hand gentle just above his elbow. Normally, Cas would be badgering him about this and that, but the youngest Novak was a little preoccupied with panicking.
“Not really, but what’re you gonna do?” He sighed, glancing at Dean, who in question shrugged, eyes sharp with concern.
“I heard it on the television the other day and thought it would be a good word to use on you. You are in fact, kind of a moron.” Dean huffed but didn’t protest, choosing to instead bury his face in the seraph’s dark hair.
Although Cas was disappointed that he wouldn't be able to go out to dinner with Dean, he had supposed it was for the best and shrugged it off, moving on with his day.
“Cut it out,” He muttered at Cas, who was still shaking him. “You don’t shake it when it doesn’t work, Cassie, everyone knows that.” Sighing with relief, Cas let go of him, only to grab onto him again and pull him to his feet.
“And I’m gonna stop you right there,” Dean interrupts, but he’s smiling. “I love you, sweetheart,” He says instead, softly kissing the top of Cas’ forehead. Castiel smiles up at him.
“Late for what?” Gabe muttered as quietly as he could into Dean's ear when the other two alphas had walked ahead, per Deans command.
“We can’t,” He informed Castiel. “Alastair would have put out alarms all over, and the hospitals would immediately turn us in. Same with fire stations, deputy offices, anything you can think of. Even if they want to help us, it’s the law that bought omegas can not be turned into their responsible alphas. We’d be turned in within a second.”
“Sammy?” He shouted as loud as he dared with training rooms on either side of him. “Sam!” He skidded to a halt in front of their cell, where his little brother sat with his back to the wall and his head in his hands. At his voice, Sam looked up, revealing bloodshot eyes and tear tracks down his cheeks. Dean didn’t hesitate to plop down next to him, talking a mile a minute.
So Dean became a hunter, trying his hardest to get Sammy out of the Company, working as the Company’s perfect soldier to keep his baby brother alive and bullet-less.
But he’ll have to do it later, because Dean Winchester and Co. are coming into their room, and before he knows it, he’s being gently pulled down a hallway, and away from his brother.
Gabriel snorted softly. “Assbutt,” he murmured softly, then went back to examining the cell. Castiel rolled his eyes.
“Why’d you go on em in the first place?” Cas asks later, swinging their joint hands back and forth as they walk through the lanes of cars in Singers Salvage. “The scent blockers, I mean. No other alpha was on them.” Dean shrugged, staring up at the dark night sky.
"When did you get so tall, Jack?" the angel asked with a slight chuckle, his son now towering over his current form.
It had been years since Castiel had experienced existing as a simple wave of celestial intent. It didn't feel the same as the last time. He could feel his light fading. It was embarrassing how much grace that witch's spell had forcibly burned from him. In this state he wouldn't survive outside a vessel for very long.
The hunter obeyed, sitting back in his chair, watching in awe as Castiel—panting and grunting—started actively trying to push out their baby.
Jack threw open the door to the room where Castiel’s previous vessel had been stored for the last many months.
"Thank you, Dean," Castiel said appreciatively, before noticing a strange expression cross the hunter's face. "What's wrong?"
“He’s right, Dean,” Mary added, popping her head out from her bedroom door. “It will be several more hours before anything interesting happens.”
Mary was nodding off, and Sam was discretely texting Eileen—but Dean appeared to be genuinely invested in the tale.
Dean never thought he'd find himself in this situation again—once again digging through the lore books on nephilim.
"I know this—new thing—we have going on between us hasn't been going on very long but," Dean swallowed. "I wondered if you were still coming by my room tonight like usual?"
Cas closed his eyes in resignation, ready for the end, at the same time a desperate Dean finally laid hands on the angel blade.
"I am going to be a big brother," Jack said with determination, "and I want to know how to be the best big brother that I can be."
"Sure, just a minute," she replied to the nephilim before stepping away from the table, phone to her ear. "Yes?"
Cas willed himself to turn his head, a tightness at this neck, his eyes finally coming into focus on the green numbers of an alarm clock.
The hunter left his own shower space to invade the other man’s, taking the former angel’s face in his hands, and pressing a kiss to his lips under the spray of the hot water. And it was
Dean nearly tripped over his own legs several times on the way down the hall, but Castiel managed to successfully wrangle the inebriated Winchester to his bedroom.
Dean glanced up in the rear view mirror as he put Baby in reverse. The brown eyes of the lady-Cas stared back at him, sat next to the former body of the angel—leaned gently across the backseat.
“Ah!” the angel panted, falling forward on his elbows, wings flexing further inward as the yellow light of the nephilim swirled around the small newborn, before finally settling and fading into the skin.
A loud boom interrupted the witch as a side door near the back of the warehouse was blasted off its hinges, letting light pour in from the street.
Dean swallowed hard and quickly stripped off his boxers, taking his place at the shower to the right of Castiel’s.
Castiel shifted again, what remained of his broken wings suddenly manifested onto this plane, wrapping a cocoon of safety around him, blocking too much of the light from hitting Dean.
Dean shook his head, willing the images from his mind, reaching for a small pill bottle on the bedside table.
“Cas,” Sam continued, putting the phone back to his ear, “you don’t know how good it is to hear your voice.”
Dean then turned his attention to the soft glow from the bathroom door, crawling out of bed to investigate the sounds of a running shower.
"Yes, thank you," Jack responded, getting himself a plate before joining the younger Winchester at the table.
At that, the three headed on inside of the building, finding themselves in a room devoid of any light.
With a yawn, the hunter blinked awake to find the angel next to him scrolling through Facebook on maximum brightness.
"It's nothing, Cas," the Winchester shrugged, "I just had the sudden feeling that I had forgotten something important."
“What happened to all of Chuck's power? It’s not all in there is it?” Sam questioned, gesturing at the shiny object.
“What was it you wanted to show me?” Castiel asked as they traveled to some hidden corner of Heaven and Jack removed his hand from his father’s shoulder.
Castiel squinted at the corner of the room, seeing a familiar figure trying and failing to teleport away to somewhere—succeeding only in looking constipated.
Jack held out the empty vial again, and the angel nodded, putting away his wings and closing his eyes.
"Dean," Cas began slowly, walking into the bedroom still naked and dripping wet, towel in hand, to find the hunter wildly pacing back and forth, "What's the matter? You look like you just saw a ghost."
"My point exactly," Castiel said plainly, turning down another aisle in the baby section of the store and picking his own selection from the wall.
The young God closed his hand around the vial and rotated it in front of Castiel’s throat. When he rotated it back, he revealed it full of shining grace. Cas blinked his eyes open at the bright light he once held inside.
When Cas stepped forward, his bloodied hand readying to shove him out of the way, Dean snapped from his stupor of despair, and latched onto the shocked angel with all his might as soon as the hand connected with his shoulder, using the force of his fall to pull them both to the ground, narrowly avoiding the blast of ooze sailing above their heads.
"I'm an angel, Dean," Castiel replied, voice still tinged with shock. "I should survive birthing a nephilim, especially one conceived out of such weak grace."
Cas managed a few sips of water before he groaned, feeling faint from sitting up too quickly. He sat the glass back down and clicked off the light, letting himself slide back down into the blankets and memory foam.
Dean tossed and turned in his bed, unable to quiet his mind, but he must have fallen asleep at some point because the next thing he was aware of was startling awake to Jack calling his name.
"Jack, are you looking forward to Cas getting back to normal? He said yesterday that he will likely be strong enough today to make the swap."
"Why would you be looking up names when we don't even know the—wait—do you know?" Dean's eyes widened.
“Oh, Jack.” Castiel stretched his huge black wings out, eyes glowing, and felt of the full and healthy, dark feathers.
"Cas?" Dean watched as the angel's eyes glowed with enough power that he was able to move in spite of the spell to pull up his sleeves to reveal that runes from the floor had migrated to his arms.
Castiel listened with worry as he heard muffled sounds of shuffling, whispering, and clanking bottles through the phone as Sam tried and failed to get Dean to wake up.
"Good to see you again, Jack!" Jody replied, giving him a brief hug, before descending the stairs. "I was passing through and I thought I'd stop in and see you boys, it's been a long—"
There was another mechanical noise that echoed in the distance as the bunker systems tried to re-engage, but the hallway’s occupants remained bathed in the red glow of the emergency lights.
Sam immediately bolted up from his seat in the bunker library, scattering several books to the ground and ran down the hallway to go find his brother.
"Of course I want our baby, Cas," the elder Winchester brother reassured. "I just have to make sure nothing bad is going to happen to you first."
"I—I don't think so, since they stopped trying to bother with Jack long ago," Castiel replied, snuggling deeper into Dean's arms. "Honestly, the other angels should be mostly concerned with just keeping heaving running right now and not with our current activities."
Castiel tilted his head curiously as Dean stormed into the bathroom and threw open the shower curtain.
He blinked awake on the ground of a white void that was very much the opposite of what he would expect from The Empty. Glancing around, Castiel could see the tangled legs of his long-dead brothers and sisters all grumbling awake and righting themselves in equal confusion and shock.
Jack and Mary rose to meet them, watching an unfamiliar woman descend the stairs also—wearing nothing but a hospital gown and Dean's borrowed jacket over her shoulders.
Suddenly, the group was interrupted by a rush of air and a familiar figure materializing in the middle of the room.
“I—” Jack paused for a moment in thought. “There is still important work for me to do here. More pieces of Heaven and Hell to fix, more laws of the universe to put into place. But then,
“To angel-kind,” Jack clarified, producing a small empty vial from nothing and holding it up. “Cas, you have a choice to make if you wish to go through that door.”
“Dean, are you hurt?” The former angel questioned, leaning forward and reaching out a hand to gently touch the side of Dean’s face.
Sam breathed a sigh of relief as soon as they were able to move again, quickly checking his and his brother's skin for any remaining marks to confirm it was all gone.
As if on instinct, Castiel suddenly shifted positions from laboring on his back and leaned up into a squatting stance on the center of the bed, rolling back on his heels and spreading his knees.
Castiel gasped at the same moment as several bulbs burst above them in unison sending sparks of light raining down. The entire bunker went dark for a few seconds before there was a grinding noise and a loud hum as the red emergency lighting kicked in.
"Dean, I refuse to dress our future baby like a lumberjack," the angel frowned, promptly putting the offending garment back on the clothing rack.
"Cas," the hunter groaned at length as he followed a few thrusts later, the angel collapsing on top of him, pressing breasts to chest.
"Yes," the angel replied simply, starting to open it. "I believe Rowena is aware that if any harm came to me her life would be instantly forfeit.”
Now he swears he saw the two walk right past his door in nothing but boxers holding towels presumably for the shower.
“Hold on, choirboy, if you just pop back over to the pearly gates, being our fine, feathered friend again, what’s to stop you from just hopping back down that mortal slide? Would you just keep re-spawning infinitely like some sick video-game?”
They gasped as they worked into each others hands, pressed as tightly together as possible under the relentless beat of the warm water. Dean knew he wasn’t going to last long. Especially not with the way Castiel’s huge hand was roughly—
“Upon my mortal death, Jack said I would return to Heaven, an angel again. He took measures to erase the angel blades from existence, so I don’t know if it would be possible for an angel in Heaven to die with these new rules.”
"And I won't ever let you die like that," Cas murmured against his lips, "I promise you, Dean Winchester, that for as long as I live I will be by your side. And when it is finally your time and you pass beyond the veil, I will return to heaven and watch over your soul for all eternity."
It was only a few minutes into soaping himself up that Dean, soap-in-hand, chanced a look over at Cas to find that he had only one thing in his hand and it wasn’t the soap.
Next to him Dean stood, carefully cradling their son, James T. Winchester, who was hungrily suckling at a bottle.
For as long as he could remember, Dean held to the sage, ancient wisdom of 'wrap it before you tap it.'
The loud banging on the outside of the bunker door was answered by Jack, who undid the locks to find none other than Jody Mills.
Castiel’s grace was still weak and waning, but there was enough left for him to instinctively know this was Heaven—and to be specific, one of the blank white rooms that would eventually be the personal heaven of some not-yet-passed, human soul.
“Yes, I had no choice over who was resurrected. Every angel and demon who ever died has been returned to Heaven and Hell.”
The roar of the void was heading right for them as Dean sliced open the angel's throat, his grace spilling violently into the air.
"Huh, wha?" Dean snapped out of his daydream to find his brother glaring at him from behind his laptop.
"I did. I had to impart some more of my grace into my old body, since it seems I will be remaining in this form for the next nine months if all goes well."
"And I am still unclear why there are so many messages about showering babies," the angel continued.
Dean growled at her, "Whatever it is you are doing to him, you better stop it right now, or I swear there won't be anything left of you after I-"
!” Sam could faintly be heard yelling in the background, wrestling the phone away from the former King of Hell.
“What will happen when I die as a human?” Castiel asked plainly, wasting no time in stepping into the door of the tube.
“Country roads, take me home—” Lucifer sang off key, sitting on the porch, cornfield swaying in the wind, strumming a banjo he conjured from nowhere. “Come on guys sing along—”
"Dean?" He managed weakly, eyes fluttering, as he felt the hunter's hands at his neck, putting pressure to attempt to keep his human blood in.
"Who am I?" the middle-aged woman with dyed-green hair replied. "Who are you? Especially this one," she said, approaching Castiel curiously, "you shouldn't be able to move at all. Just what are you, now?"
"Of course," Castiel smiled behind unfamiliar brown eyes, crowding into the Winchester's space.  "So long as you'll have me."
Dean nodded, taking all of this in stride, before reaching for his gun in his pants, whipping it out and cocking it. "Now, where is this old bitch?"
"I had this brilliant idea," the hunter-werewolf sat his drink down, a large grin on his face. "We got one of the cows from the farm and a tub of blue food coloring which we fed to old Bessie. Then we had the pack tear into her during the party—we all really got into it."
There, in the middle of the room, Gabriel is being held down by two alphas with black masks covering their noses and mouths, screaming like Cas has never heard before, telling him to run, to get out of here, but Castiel doesn’t listen.
Hey! So I’m doing a bit of a time skip, going forward a couple of months into when they have Jack, because:
“I would love to watch a chick-flick movie with you, Castiel,” He muttered but smiled when Cas beamed.
“Hey! Careful of the arm!” Cas complained as Dean’s rough glove gripped his sore forearm. Dean’s hand immediately softened.
While Dean is slouched in on himself, trying to appear smaller, the other alphas are standing straight up and “strong”, the broad shoulders and height giving them an air of importance, but if Gabe had to guess, he would assume that Dean was bigger than both of them.
Okay, here we are! So again, I have never adopted a kid, so I’m going of the internet. And as you know, the internet is SUPER reliable, so I will probably get thin gas incorrect on the adoption process.
“Okay, so we’ll do that. Walk across the road, maybe come to a hotel…” Cas sighed, closing his eyes.
“Ok,” Castiel agreed, because Gabriel was his older brother, so he obviously knew best. “Did you know that bees can see all colors except for red?”
Since he had never seen him before, Sam guessed he was new, and since he had caught the fleeting scent of the omega’s toffee and cookie scent yesterday evening, he guessed that he was one of the Novak’s, either Castiel or Gabriel. He watched, upset, as the trainer made the Novak boy stand up straight and stick his arms out, but didn’t miss the soft snarl on the omegas face as he did what the man in white asked.
Dean winced and rubbed the scent gland where his neck and shoulder met. The damn thing was sore as hell, stupid scent blockers.
, that Gabriel just fell to his knees, breath caught in his throat. The guard could clearly smell it too but was probably used to it. What she probably wasn’t used to, however, were the two holes that were riddled into her neck not even a minute later. The alpha thudded to the floor, dead, and from his place on the floor, Gabe heard his brothers yell.
“Yeah,” he said, voice barely above a whisper. He had told Sam about the Novak’s as soon as he learned about them, telling him about everything he learned from the file. At the news of the capture, Sam’s broad shoulders slumped.
But protecting Castiel became even more important, however, when Gabriel presented. The moment he woke up with a dull ache in his stomach and wet sheets, all he could think was ‘oh, shit.’
Dean hums as he makes his way inside, having cleaned up the small table in the shed and now heading back into Bobby’s house.
Yes, I am aware it's short, but it's the only thing I could come up with that I was satisfied with...
As soon as Sam had come into view, the guard had frozen, staring at him as he bolted down the hallway, and didn’t seem to realize until after he was long gone that she probably should have stopped him. But then another two shots went off. Both Gabe and the alpha’s heads snapped to attention at the sound, but the guard didn’t make a move to do anything.
I'm aware this doesn't really focus on what happened to Sam and Gabe like how I wrote the destiel epilogue, but I had a couple of ideas in mind for what I wanted to do for the sequels and this was my favorite option.
“Are we together?” Kevin asked for him. “Nah. I’m not into alphas. They’re way too dominant. More of a beta guy. We’re just friends.” Gabe nodded, even though Kevin couldn’t see it.
Sam let out an anxious breath, fiddling with his tie in one of the mirrors of the court house bathrooms. “How in the hell…” He started, and a soft laugh was let out behind him. He turned around quickly to meet eyes with Gabriel, who was staring at him with an amused look on his face.
There’s no specific update time or date for this, but it will be done in no more than two weeks, I promise.
for the predicament he was in, Sam couldn’t. Today is Tuesday, the day he’s to be shipped out to Lucifer.
“C’mon,” His little brother grunted as he pulled them up off the floor. “We’re escaping.” Gabriel blinked, then looked at Dean, who was lurking behind Cas and staring at the omega as he had single-handedly saved the TV series
I really would enjoy a couple of prompts to do, mostly because I have a lot of ideas and don’t really know how to sort through them and choose one I like.
As he struggled to bring air into his aching lungs, wheezing like… he didn’t know, something that wheezes a lot, he heard Dean’s voice again and whimpers.
“O-okay.” He murmured, going boneless as Dean ran a hand through his dark hair. Although Dean obviously could tell that Castiel didn’t completely believe him, the man decided to drop it, for now, running one hand through his angel's hair and the other up and down Cas’ back, murmuring to him softly.
“Sorry! Sorry- it’s just…” Dean hesitated, drowning in memories, until Cas softly shook his arm in Dean's hand, jolting him back into the present. Taking a deep breath, he continued talking.
“Sure,” he said, following Gabriel into the back of the store. Castiel caught his husband's eyes, and Dean proceeded to mouth ‘sexual tension’ at him. Cas merely chuckled and leaned into Dean’s side, kissing him gently on the cheek.
“Why, sweetheart? You want a sibling?” Claire frowned, reaching her small hands down to touch the carpeted floor, drawing patterns with her fingertips.
“So,” Castiel began, eyes sparkling as he took a sip from his water, “What did you think of Pamela?” Dean, who had been staring at Cas with an awestruck look on his face, blinks then clears his throat.
It had come out of nowhere. Castiel had been wandering around in the bunker halls, just… thinking. About what he’s lost, what they’ve lost, what had been gained in the process. Still unused to the way his heart started to throb in his chest, and not understanding
Then, the ball really started rolling. The alpha appeared out of the trees, talking and laughing about something Sam didn’t pay attention to. He did pay attention, however, when Dean cocked the colt and aimed it at Azazel’s head.
But anyway, that is the end of the Seas of Struggle! I have a couple of ideas for sequels and one-shots, maybe a sequel with Kevin, or more on Benny or other supporting characters? But if any of you have suggestions, I’d be more than happy to hear them!
Cas smiles brilliantly, pressing his nose into Dean’s neck. “Thank you,” He murmured, but Dean wasn’t done.
Sure, life was hard, and sure, Gabe missed a lot of things about home, but as his brother grew up into a strong, independent omega, he never regretted it. If he hadn’t done what he had, there was no guarantee that Castiel would even still be alive, let alone his own person with a sharp mind and quick wit.
“Oh, come on!” Cas jokingly complained, having finally sat all the way up. He gently leans back down, laying a gentle hand on Dean's chest and rubbing it gently. Dean wanted nothing more than to cuddle up to his husband, to rub his stomach and lean against it, pretending to be able to hear the kid inside of Cas’s heartbeat. But he couldn’t.
“—Look, the scent thing I mentioned?” Gabe interrupts. “With the scents… melding? It happened with me and Sam, too. I can smell him scary easy, and our pheromones sort of just… bonded together. So I want to court him. And—” he raises his hand to continue when Dean opens his mouth, “I know that courting is technically the alphas job, but fuck that. I want to court your brother, so I’m asking you first.”
“He’s… uh, he’s dead. Killed on a hunt two years ago. You don’t need to worry, he died painfully. Kevin was thrilled at the news.” Cas, seemingly noticing that the dead hunter was a touchy subject, nodded and dropped it.
He remembers fighting about some stupid thing with Dean in his room, and his mother coming in, her scent sharp and almost painful with terror, telling them to go, to run.
Okay so, here’s the thing. Life’s been kicking me in the ass recently, which has given me less free time to write. Because of that, I’m going to have to move my updating time to only on Sundays.
Gabe let out a soft laugh, lips red and slightly swollen, as he responded to the sheriff. “We’ll be right there Jody, sorry,” He said, and the only sound was an exasperated sigh and the sound of fading footsteps. The omega turned back to Sam, smiling at him cockily as he straightened his tie, the alpha staring down at him with an awestruck look on his face. “We’ll have to have a rain check,” Gabe murmured to him, pressing a soft kiss to the blushing alphas cheek before stepping back, making his way out of the bathroom.
But it did later and when he confronted Gabe about it in the disgusting motel they were crashing it, Gabriel had simply shrugged.
With a bitter scent that, as was explained to him, smelled like acid, an alpha would pin down an omega so that they were helpless, and put the thin nozzle of the thing to each of an omegas scent glands: on the wrists, neck, and lower back. These would, in short, melt the glands off, slowly and painfully, so that the omegas could not signal with their scent for help. It would mess with their very being, and if given regularly, have the same side effects of rabies.
“Until it’s not,” Cas said, voice barely above a whisper. Dean gently rested a hand on Cas’ forehead, waiting for permission to do anything else. After a few seconds, Cas made a strangled sound and gripped Dean’s forearm, still struggling to breathe.
“I, uh, I… um… sorry.” He stammered nervously, making eye contact briefly with Castiel’s blue eyes as the omega himself tilted his head to the side curiously.
“I love you too,” He replies, lunging forward to press his lips warmly around Deans, sighing happily as his human melts into the embrace. Cas moves to straddle his human’s lap, linking his ankles behind Dean’s back and wrapping his arms around Dean’s neck and shoulders, diving back down to kiss Dean again when his movements temporarily pull them apart.
“Yeah, I guess,” he murmured, rubbing his eyes and groaning softly. “I just—“ he faltered. “I really hoped that they would have escaped,” he whispered.
It was at this moment that Sam walked into the shop, hunching his shoulders awkwardly as he half-smiled at Gabriel.
Dean nodded, ignoring Sam, who was frantically shaking his head. “If I give you a good enough head start, they won’t find you. Alastair will give up eventually, and you’ll be free.”
“We need to get help.” He told his older brother, craning his neck around to look at Gabriel, who was with Sam by the edge of the trees, keeping a lookout for Company men. “We need to get Dean to a hospital or something.” Gabe grimaced but didn’t move.
“You say something nice every day, baby,” He told his angel, smiling. “And besides, you’re better. Gabe does all sorts of cheesy stuff, and Sammy loves that. But you, my Castiel,” Dean pressed a kiss to Cas’ radish red cheek, “You are the sweetest angel turned human ever, and you’re amazing.”
Castiel immediately called out his brother's name, straining to get closer to him and see what it is making him so mad, and Dean let him, letting go of his arm and praying that he wouldn’t try to escape.
And although Cas still struggled with the thousands upon millions of weights on his shoulders, it was as if at least one had been lifted off his shoulders.
“What was that for?” He murmured, staring into the older Winchester’s green eyes. His husband merely shrugged, pressing another quick kiss to Cas’ cheek before pulling away.
Sorry if this seems kinda rushed and is really short, but on Monday the chapter should be slightly better, so stick with me here!
“God,” Dean Winchester snorts, “This is so damn cheesy,” Castiel looked up at him and smiled, eyes twinkling in the lights of the Christmas tree they sat in front of.
Mills didn’t even wait for the group to process this information before she began her story. “Same with my son,” She said. “I...was out of town. Sheriff's retreat. My dad, who’s an alpha, was staying with Owen and my husband, acting as the ‘responsible alpha’. My husband tried to protest when they came to take Owen, but he was a beta and they just…” She mimed someone pulling the trigger on a gun. Kevin flinched.
From in between the bars of the cell, Kevin shrugged. “He came over earlier today, but I haven’t seen him in about five hours or so.” Whilst he talked, Dean kept one eye on the Novaks, the older of whom was looking at him with a look that could have wiped out an army, and the younger frowning at him. Dean was having trouble reading his expression.
“Hey kiddo, how’ve you been?” Sam grinned, kneeling down to hug his niece, Claire happily throwing her arms around his neck.
“Whatever you wish, Cas.” He said and Castiel smiled once again, grabbing the lettuce and sticking it in the basket. At Dean’s questioning look the angel merely shrugged.
“Time to go,” one of them told Dean gruffly, eyeing the two omegas. The other one, who had been staring at Kevin, pointed to the cell he was held in, hackles raised.
Neither gazes ever drifted from where they watched TV in the Dean Cave, (Cas still wasn’t a fan of the name) listening to the corny songs that Frosty the Snowman sang. For once both seemed content to sit down and not do anything, other than to curl up on the warm couch with about a thousand blankets and hot cocoa.
Alastair didn’t look very intimidating. Or intimidating at all, really. Narrow face with a balding head, and a salt and pepper beard, the beta looked more like a middle aged dad than one of the founding members of an omega trading and training center. And, Castiel supposed, that just made him more terrifying.
“What was that all about?” Cas asked as soon as they were on the open road. Dean looked over at him from the driver's seat.
Sam snorted, leaning his head back against the wall. “Hell,” he hesitated, clearly thinking about something. “I heard you found Castiel and Gabriel. I smelt them,” Dean sighed, copying Sam’s position.
“Okay! I and Sully will be playing Cowboys and Indians!” Cas chuckled, rolling his eyes. She really is Dean’s daughter.
“Whew!” Dean let out a puff of air as they slid into the Impala, shaking his head to dislodge the snowflakes that had fallen into his hair. “Didn’t notice it had started snowing while we were in there,” He said, grinning over to Cas in the passenger seat of the car. Cas shrugged, rooting through one of the many bags they had brought with them.
Dumping his brush into the now cold soapy water and then scrubbing the floor, Sam kept one eye out for anyone that may round the corner of the sharp hallways and one eye on the golden omega, watching carefully.
Shaggy brown hair that almost hung into his eyes, which were as bright as the moon in the darkness, with a slightly chiseled face. And it sure as hell didn’t hurt when the alpha rolled his lip between the teeth.
“What? No, that’s not it, well, kinda, but it isn’t your fault, and I think—” Cas blinked, just noticing Deans posture. Interrupting himself, he spoke again.
Dean grunted at the weight of a full grown omega falling into him, stepping back a bit, keeping a firm but gentle hold on the two Novak's arms.
The omega had made his way out and Dean had greeted him, shoving what appeared to be a scruffy batch of wild roses into his arms before opening the door to the shed, leading Cas inside.
“You-you asked to see me?” He risked a glance up at the beta, who was at his desk, hands clasped together, a delighted look on his face.
Risking a chance, Gabriel cleared his throat and softly asked “Kevin?” He heard a bit of shuffling, then:
“An explanation would be nice,” Sam agreed, sinking warily onto Bobby’s couch next to Castiel and Dean. Mills cleared her throat and sat down across from them.
“Come in,” Chuck's tired voice sounded from behind the large mahogany door. Gabriel nervously entered, reciting his plan in his head. He was taken by surprise, however, when Chuck saw who it was that entered his study and smiled.
