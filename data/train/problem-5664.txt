She feels rather than hears the rumble he gives. "Forgot how good that tastes," he tells her, and before she can comment he dives right back in.
"Oh, we already have a problem, princess," the man replies, scowling at her with a strangely familiar glare. "We had problems when you stole my tech.  That suit you were wearing is property of Stark Industries."
Tony goes, climbing up into the bed with him in a way that is probably not good for their injuries, but since when does Tony give a shit?  She wiggles underneath the blankets and sighs when Steve pulls them up and over, covering them both in the soft kind of cotton she would have chosen.
With that, the last of the awkwardness hanging in the room finally dissipates. Man-Tony takes out a StarkPad from somewhere, and Steve gets started bustling around the kitchen, clunking through the new tower's cabinets and drawers with his brow minutely furrowed in concentration. Tony watches him putter around the island with a sense of fondness, her mind soothed by the familiar scene of Steve busying himself with cooking something or other. She watches him work, and while she does, she reaches up and quietly rubs her knuckles against the lower part of her sternum, trying to ignore the hole in her heart that doesn't seem to be going away.
"Hey, Stark, what gives?" Barton calls as they pass by the kitchen on the way to her room.  Natasha and Bruce are sitting at the island with glasses of--something, Tony doesn't care, she's thinking with her vagina and
"I want to feel you," she blurts honestly, feels a twinge of old panic at the naked desperation in her voice but she swallows and forces herself to continue: "
"Yes," he agrees calmly, eyes hooded and dark as he stares sleepily back at her, the red curve of his mouth soft with affection.  Tony leans forward and places a gentle, closed-mouth kiss on his lips, admiring the sweep of his golden lashes against his cheek as she withdraws in the moment before his eyes flutter open.
day--but when Steve posed that particular calm, innocently-phrased question, the Director scowled openly and leaned back in his chair, shaking his head.
"Yes, darling dearest; keep your tightpants on--" she mutters, distracted, still trying to calibrate her displays as she digs her feet into the ground to keep herself steady.
sad."
The biggest differences Tony can see between their towers (besides the whole Stark-not-Avengers thing) come from her counterpart's absolutely garish tastes in interior decorating. Not all of it's bad, to be fair--mahogany? Good, great; dark woods are always an excellent choice. Glass and steel surfaces? Perfect, Tony's on board; modernism is always the way to go, when tastefully applied. She strolls idly through the kitchen area and past the residential spaces with a vague, almost perverted sort of curiosity. As with the tower back home, Pepper clearly had a hand in all this. Tony can see her touches everywhere--the flowers on the drawing board by the elevator; the Ming vase sitting on the bar... This place is clearly as much Pepper's as it is Other Tony's.
They ride the rest of the way in silence.
And when he met Peggy, well...it was just a happy sort of coincidence that she also didn't have any words.
For the first time in his life, he'd finally been fully at peace.
"Of course," Bruce says simply with a glance at Natasha, who's just.  Watching them, speculatively.  Tony stares steadily back until, finally, Nat turns away.
"Steve's gonna need some medical attention," she tells a wary Bruce, because now that she's moved past her initial crushing relief Tony's noticing all these cuts, scrapes, and wounds, which, though Steve heals quickly, should still be looked at.
"No, that's not it," Tony admits, "but, I mean." Tony pauses and thinks, for a moment.  Gathers her words.
familiar.
"You need to be careful around him," he finishes at last.
"Yeah, real proud of that one, aren't you?" Tony mutters fondly, scratching the hair at the back of his head.  Steve arches into the touch like a cat and rumbles, "Got you to laugh, didn't it?"
"I don't like being directed places," Tony informs Steve for about the hundredth time, and he chuffs, but he also used the I-can't-be-dissuaded tone, so, contrary to her smart mouth, Tony plays nice and allows herself to be ordered.
"Thanks," she says, tossing it on the table with the armor, which lays there dormant on the table gleaming red and gold.
something with himself.
"See what I have to work with?" she complains, leading him over to the table. "Anyway, how's your suit looking?"
Tony moans long and feels herself clench around his fingers.  She arches her back and babbles, a nonsensical litany of "please" and "Steve" and "
sorry," a man's voice is saying, sounding sincerely alarmed and apologetic, "I had no idea anyone would be up here at this time of night; I didn't think to look--"
"Did you, now?" Tony replies, curious where this is going.  She leans into Steve's touch as his thumb begins stroking against her jaw.
It's the
"You seem a little overwhelmed," Man-Tony observes.
"Yes," Natasha confirms quietly behind her, startling a curse out of Tony, because
Obvious or not, his play seems to have worked, if their teammates' body language is an accurate indicator: Natasha's chin has lifted, Clint's lowered his bow a fraction, and the muscles in Bruce's shoulders have unclenched, relief plainly visible on his face. Tony, for all that she's vulnerable and lacking a suit, would have done the same sort of thing, if she'd landed in this situation at home--she might have gotten there first in
"I'll find my suit and shield," Steve agrees, looking steadier and more determined now that they're sorting themselves out.  Tony smiles.
"Jeez; warn a gal next time, will you?" Tony complains, peering up at her fianc√© with a well-deserved scowl. "I
Then, the door to the shower opens with a soft
"I thought you were going to find the lab," he says, a question in his eyes. Bruce glances at Steve and frowns.
"You," Tony says, with an extreme sense of vindication possessed only by someone whose has just had their drink thrown off a roof, "are a
And sure enough, to Erskine, Steve's blank skin was just another item on an apparently long list of qualifications that named him a good candidate for the serum.  And, after the serum happened... well.
Steve just gives them both a stern look (which might have worked, if his ears weren't still pink), and leaves the lab with a sigh, shaking his head.
"No," she says, smiling a little, "I can handle myself."
"Mmm,
"Just over that, yeah," Logan confirms, idly admiring the way Bucky's hair curls at the nape of his neck. The guy's got a nice jaw; Logan can't wait for the beard burn that stubble's going to give him.
"And why we're here at all," Tony adds impulsively, glancing up at Steve, because she
Steve's breath hitches.  He brushes the feeling aside as Stark comes closer.  This isn't the time.
He scowls through the next New Year, though, because this is the year he's finally gonna meet his stupid nonagenarian jerk soulmate. Great. He's sure they'll enjoy their assuredly limited time together.
Antonia "Tony" Stark goes silent.  Her mouth falls open in surprise.  Then--completely heedless of the chaos and violence going on around them, or maybe completely uncaring--her expression shifts from shocked to speculative, and, with no hesitation and with complete shamelessness, she leans back with a glimmer in her eyes and blatantly gives Steve a once-over.
to get stuck with skinny, asthmatic little Steve Rogers?  At the time, he figured there wasn't much he could do for any dame, or any
After he violently shuts down all the other intrusive assholes who bring it up over the next couple days, everyone learns to leave it the fuck alone. It bugs the shit out of him that
"Oh, I'm getting to that part," Tony says, shifting where she sits.
"Not that I care, honey, but I figure you'll wanna know
"No," Tony lies blatantly as she finishes drying off her forehead, giving up the pretense of subtlety: it's not her fault these pants make such an excellent sweat rag; she didn't give them to him, after all. Feeling brave enough to test her limits, Tony turns her head gently to the right and cracks open her eyes enough to squint up at Steve's face. She's sadly unable to keep herself from smirking when they finally do make eye contact.
"Unfortunately not, Miss," JARVIS says apologetically, and Tony closes her eyes, pressing her palms over them with a groan. "I believe there are some bathrobes in the bedroom closet."
"Dr. Strange, the Avengers," he continues, casting his eyes around the assemblage with an easy air as if he's knocking elbows in a tux at a charity dinner party, not preventing a fight between some of the world's strongest heroes, rumpled and covered in gravel dust.
"If you insist," he says, joining the others in the elevator.  Clint claps him on the arm, which is...strange.
"Back up, buddy, or we're gonna have a problem," she bites out, hands clenching into fists despite the padded shackles holding her to the bed.
It's clear just from initial observations that nobody was prepared this (well, insofar as they, the Avengers, are ever
Steve pinks a little and scratches the back of his head.
Anthony here that you were asleep, and furthermore that we weren't fit for company.  So, of course, he decided he had to come down and see for himself," Tony explains with a shrug. "Curiosity's a terrible thing." She begins examining her nails with a quiet sort of satisfaction while Other Tony shifts uncomfortably in her peripheral vision.  No doubt Steve is still glaring a hole in him.
"Agh,
"Oh, I found it alright," Tony says with great irritation, "And inside it, I found
"There's no point in struggling.  Those were made to hold back the Hulk."
"Sorry for the trouble," Doctor Strange offers somewhat apologetically from his own corner of the roof, looking a little bemused at the quick turnaround. "I just wanted to take a quick look at the portal site--duck in and duck out.  Didn't think I'd activate the night guard." Contrition and amusement war in his eyes as he watches everybody else shift around and grumble, the team going from visibly on-edge to visibly annoyed in even less time than it took them to be ready.
Tony releases her death-grip on his skin, and moves her hands, dizzily, onto the bent knee underneath that he's been using to support them. Steve's right arm shifts away to give her space, and Tony tries, weakly, to lift her head, but is immediately overcome by another wave of vertigo. She sucks in a breath and bows forward again, bracing herself over the shelf of Steve's thigh; his left arm follows her down, cradling her back as he murmurs something soothingly over the buzzing in Tony's ears. She presses her forehead into the unfamiliar fabric of his borrowed sweatpants and heaves through breath after breath, eyes blinking rapidly against the tide of dizziness washing over her like a sea. She feels Steve's left hand stroking gently over her back, and focuses on trying not to vomit all over his leg.
Steve's own phone buzzed and he pulled it up seeing a text message from Natasha. Fury was apparently on the war path, thanks to the World Security Council, and she and Clint were looking to get out. Steve wiggled his nose a little, kind of wanting the rest of the team to come here, but this was Tony's house, and he didn't know if he would like, or want, that. He wanted to check in with Thor as well, they needed to make some decisions about what was going to happen with Loki, and the tesseract.
"That never comforts me, Steve," Pepper sighed.
Maybe he was relaxing a bit too much when he had the sensation of floating, leaving the chair. His head lolled back and he took a deep breath through his nose. Then lights flashed through his eyelids and he opened them then. He bit back a gasp when he saw the darkness of space, specks of lights of the stars, staring back at him. He had literally started floating, out in space.
‚ÄúWant all of you,‚Äù Steve moaned against his lips, rolling his hips down against Tony.
"Hey, Pete," Steve said to the boy, and Tony raised his eyebrow slightly at Steve's own nickname for the boy. "You get checked out?"
"I think Peter and Wade look very handsome," Rachel said, leaning down to straighten Wade's bow tie. Wade beamed with a wide smile. "I wonder though, how did you get talked into wearing those shoes, Captain?"
Tony had his newest suit, Mark XIX standing by the main entrance, balloons in hand, a party hat on the helmet. He assured the parents that all weapon systems were offline, and it was on limited mobility. Basically, it could bend over and hand someone a balloon and a hat, that's it. Really, this was a way for Tony to test the suit, to see how far he had come in making a suit that could take orders when he wasn't inside of it.
‚ÄúI‚Äôm pretty sure I just said that.‚Äù Tony narrowed his eyes at Steve and his shit eating grin. ‚ÄúShouldn‚Äôt you be out in the kitchen with Peter?‚Äù Tony grumbled a little and Steve glanced over, raising an eyebrow. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt quite catch that.‚Äù
Everyone was pulled back to the sky, the grand finale bursting in the sky. The sound was loud, the pops vibrating through the air. Steve clenched his fist a little, and startled a little when Tony knocked his shoulder with his own.
Tony‚Äôs eyes fluttered a little. He was exhausted, but most of the pain had stopped, just pulses of leftover pain lingered. Whoever, or whatever, had him had worked to try and block the pain that he was becoming familiar with. He was sure that it was trying to block The Other from finding him.
"What if you need to work on more than one project at a time?" Tony now looked confused. His workshop was bigger than this house, easily.
‚Äô from Rapunzel, and now Peter was more eager to hold onto Jamie‚Äôs hands, to show off.
"Enough things that keep you from sleeping?" Rhodey asked, watching Tony pause, but kept at his task. "I can see that you haven't slept in a while."
"There you are." He chuckled when Wade crawled up on the bed, too. "Mr Wilson as well."
"That would be the same one."
Tony frowned. "Sir, Captain Rogers is attempting to call you." The cheeky bastard.
"If anyone can do it, it's you, Tony." Mary said, then pulled Peter's homework up to read over it. "But you can't hand over the Expo to Pepper? Or the construction part of this tower to her? It has to be CEO?"
‚ÄúGive her time,‚Äù Tony smiled. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure in a few more months she‚Äôll catch on. Hey Pete, you seen Papa?‚Äù
He gave the trap a wider berth, and quickly found apartment 3E. He knocked twice and waited, adjusting his dark sunglasses, hands finding his pockets again. The door opened a couple of seconds later and Mary was there, giving him a little smile, opening the door wider to let him inside. Tony looked around as he walked in, eyeing the little apartment. The walls weren‚Äôt chipping like out in the hall, but it also looked like Mary had probably painted the walls a soft blue. The floors were hardwood, no carpet except for the new rug in the middle of the small living room, obviously meant for Peter so he didn‚Äôt hurt himself on the wood. Tony saw that Peter was sleeping in a bassinet by the gently used loveseat, and he wondered if all newborns were as quiet as he seemed to be.
"Okay." This was going to stop now. He aimed his repulsors and shot from both hands. The machine needed to be-
‚ÄúWhy do you do this?‚Äù Mary looked at Tony as Steve was walking over to the elevator. Jamie was starting to wake up when she felt her Papa‚Äôs deliberate steps. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre antagonizing.‚Äù
‚ÄúWell, Wade already left for the day.‚Äù Both Bucky and Steve straightened a little. ‚ÄúI thought you would have known that.‚Äù
"Maybe I should get her to be a babysitter."
"To be fair, we haven't exactly planned out a lot in the past two days. While that's usually my standard MO, I'm feeling pretty at a loss here," Tony confessed. "I figure, I'll go in first, and I'll lead with you moving in. Then maybe you can come in? I don't know." He groaned and rubbed his face. "Play it by ear?" He leaned back against Steve's hand that was still on his back. "I would die for this kid, I'd do literally anything for him, cause that's my baby boy on the other side of these doors, but I'm just really hoping that this doesn't crash and burn."
"Contain first," Cap backed up Tony's words. "Keep us posted Iron Man."
"I don't want to take up too much of your time, though," Steve said. She was a single mother, in essence, and Steve knew how hard that had been for his own mother.
"Just a little shaken, wants to see his Daddy." Tony nodded to Mary's words as she stepped aside to let Tony go through the door. Peter was sitting on the little couch, and nearly flew off of it when Tony walked in.
Steve shook his head. "It was a rough situation. Actually the reason I got no sleep before Mary and Phil's wedding," he confessed and Tony nodded a little. He'd be asking for details later.
"Talk to me, Tony," Steve breathed out, pressing his forehead to Tony's. He felt a tear against the thumb that he had on Tony's cheek.
"What was that?" She whispered, before moving to crawl closer to him. "I could not see where you were, but I could feel something." She held up her hand and saw a shimmer of blue swirl through the red. "You have been controlled before." She smiled at him again. "I can use that."
If Mary was going to get married, then that meant that Coulson would be moving into the Tower for sure, which was okay. Meant more people around, and Peter liked Coulson. Bruce said that he would stay in the Tower, probably still travel around the world, but he felt better knowing that there would be a place for him to come back too. Clint had come back to check on Mary, and to apologize for his mind-controlled actions, but he had liked having his own room. He said that he probably wouldn't live there full time, but he'd take Tony up on the offer of a room whenever he was in the city.
‚ÄúI found it,‚Äù Steve announced, blowing a raspberry on her cheek. She let out a squeal of laughter, wiggling around. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs loud, too.‚Äù
"Depends on the importance," Tony threw in. He glanced at his watch again. "Rachel, can I entrust the boys with you? We've got to check in with the groom as well, then I'm going to rendezvous with Pepper." Rachel shooed them off, and Tony hooked an arm with Natasha to pull her form the room as well, Steve following.
Tony blinked, looking at Captain America, dirty, bleeding, exhausted, and took his hand, letting the super soldier pull him to his feet. "I'll take that into consideration next time." Tony said with a tiny smirk. He worked at the rest of the helmet, as Thor went over and picked up the faceplate he ripped off. As Tony pulled off the rest of the helmet, he took the broken piece and let out a breath. "So, where did we leave Loki, then?"
Steve sat up a little straighter. "Did you confront him?" He knew that Bucky was still fighting whatever conditioning he had been through, and they had let him go off on his own. He didn't want to add to another body count.
"I did, but she was pretty insistent that she was ready to return back home, and, I quote, 'Couldn't be bothered to wait another second.'" Tony snorted softly. "I do believe that Sergeant Barnes is shadowing her vehicle."
"Don't know," he said with a shrug. "But, with Steve Rogers you can expect homemade food, hopefully some good conversation, and maybe some catching up on pop culture with you as a guide."
‚ÄúEevee? Vee?‚Äù She trotted back and forth, looking around.
"It looks like Julie's ex-husband may be involved."
You guys are awesome, seriously.
"You're not real," Tony whispered, his body frozen in fear.
‚ÄúOkay! I think I have everything!‚Äù Peter declared as he ran back in, four books wrapped up in his arms. Mary took them to pack them into the bag before zipping it up. Tony bounced up from the bed to his feet and Peter grinned. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm ready, Daddy!‚Äù
"I'm on my way to you, Cap," Tony said, watching Jarvis re-set his flight path. "And who the hell is Sam?"
"He lived in India for several years," Tony said off-handedly.
"We are, baby boy," Mary said carefully, smiling, but not sure how Peter would take it.
He had saved his personal floors for last, getting all other living floors complete, mostly because he had managed to talk Bruce instead at the Tower instead of disappearing again. He was introduced to his Gems, becoming the 6
"Is Mr Steve a Doctor of Art?" Peter asked immediately.
"You need to focus on the problem, Mr Stark," Steve said in a clipped tone. Tony stood up straight, and looked at Steve dead on.
"No! Leave him alone!" Tony could hear shouting, then a single gunshot and he felt the anger building up inside of him. He was rolled onto his back, shadows moving in front of the eye slits of the mask, and he readied himself. One face passed through and Tony grit his teeth. He had seen the man in the SHIELD office last month. There was no way that there were working with SHIELD. If Hydra really had infiltrated SHIELD then it wouldn't take them long to find the emergency releases of his suit, and Tony would be ready.
Tony mildly enjoyed the little bit of attention he got when he pulled up to his own event, mainly because he liked proving people wrong about him. He gave a brief greeting to Obie, and moved on, mostly so he wouldn't have to actually talk to any reporters. He could play up the bad boy role for a little longer. The people he cared about knew what he was really like now.
‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sure, but, Tony,‚Äù Steve let out a sigh. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what happened, but, when I found him- Tony, I think he shot his Dad.‚Äù Tony‚Äôs eyes widened almost comically. ‚ÄúI heard the shots, and when I got into the room, the man was dead, and Wade was holding the gun. From what I saw it was self-defense, I‚Äôm not worried about that.‚Äù
The bathroom door opened enough for Meg to stick her head out the door, peering at Steve. "Cherries?"
Mary and Coulson knew the moment that Tony and Peter arrived at the restaurant, and Mary was very glad that she had picked a very casual restaurant, where you seat yourself. A small plastic Captain America shield went flying over their head, landing on the floor, and there was an adult sounding 'Whoop!' from behind. Peter ran over, grinning, picking up his shield, his plain ballcap from earlier replaced with a blue ball cap with the shields symbol embroidered on it. He was also sporting a new Captain America t-shirt underneath his new Captain America hoodie.
I won nothing, blah blah, Marvel owns stuff, blah blah. Yay!
"I feel like you have an unfair advantage," Steve said. "You've been living in this century, help shaped this century, since it started. I've only had a few years with it."
"In about fifteen minutes?" Steve raised an eyebrow. Tony just smiled at him. A very familiar smile that he had seen on Peter's face just a couple of hours ago. Faux innocence.
Steve smiled brightly at him, and Tony felt his insides melt a little at the sparkling of his blue eyes alone.
"He wouldn't-" Steve stopped when Coulson looked at him. "Okay, so he might." Steve pulled out his phone when it buzzed in his pocket.
Bucky narrowed his eyes a little at Steve, and Steve fought to keep a smirk down. That looks was pure Bucky, the Bucky from the Thirties and Forties that Steve had grown up with. That look said that Steve was a dirty cheat for using logic against him.
"Yes, Captain?" The AI responded just as softly.
"You know what, Parker." Mary giggled and danced a few steps away from him.
"Well, I understand you have to at conferences." Tony raised both eyebrows at Steve now, and Steve joined him walking down the hall.
‚Äú‚Äôaddy,‚Äù she called out to him, and he smiled at her. Steve was still asleep, creating a warm cocoon around Jamie and Tony, arm still across Tony‚Äôs waist. ‚ÄúOtay?‚Äù
Tony thought he was going to go insane. He actually might. Three days of being trapped inside of his mind, thanks to Strucker's Enhanced. He was aware of everything, saw and heard everything, and sometimes he could break through enough to say what he wanted, instead of just nodding, or shaking his head.
Pepper was supposed to come over to bring him the paperwork to sign for the Stark Expo, and his latest idea, so it could be delivered to the Board for approval. He could not look, or feel, like this when she got here. She'd rat him out to Mary, and she'd be over here to check on him, and if he was contagious he didn't want Peter to get sick because Mary had caught whatever he did. Tony was sure that wasn't what was happening, that would be too simple.
He wasn't sure how long he stood there, looking at all the tags, but his eyes only focusing on one set.
Tony licked his lips a little, then lifted his head up. "I don't drink alone. Beer, champagne, whatever, if I'm not getting drunk, I don't drink when I'm alone. That is a one way road to disaster, and my kid, kids, don't need to see me going to rehab, again. If there's even one out there that would take me." He let Steve wrap their arms around him, pressing him more firmly to Steve's chest. He took a breath, feeling it waver on the way back out. "It's just so damn
"Your fellow warrior had the unique experience of becoming acquainted with the entity that fueled the invasion on this realm." Loki's voice was calm, and it was getting on Tony's nerves.
‚ÄúHe said ‚Äòswell‚Äô unironically, Pep,‚Äù Tony gushed. ‚ÄúNext he‚Äôs gonna be calling me his best fella.‚Äù
‚ÄúI like the way your mind is working right now.‚Äù
‚ÄúYou were picking half those fights yourself,‚Äù Bucky pointed at him, daring him to refute the statement. ‚ÄúI ain‚Äôt saying they weren‚Äôt for the right reasons, but I ended up fighting next to you more times than shoulda been happenin‚Äô.‚Äù He huffed a little and dropped his arms. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt hurt the boys to know a little bit of the right way to do things, specially not with who they live with, and who their parents are.‚Äù
‚ÄúDid you really just say, Wild Blue Yonder?‚Äù Tony looked over at the super soldier.
‚ÄúI respectfully put them in their place,‚Äù Steve muttered a little.
Steve retreated into the bathroom to change, and as he started to dress he could see it coming together. Tony was having him dress as Luke Skywalker from the beginning of
‚ÄúHey, kiddo.‚Äù Steve smiled and walked over to give him a hug, the boy never moving from his piggy-back ride from Tony.
"Right, I remember now," Tony said waving his hand to stop him. "I need a favor."
"I sent her to take a nap," Mary smiled at him. "I think she's earned it. But, maybe I'm re-thinking that now. She would have loved to have seen this."
"Don't strain yourself, Tony," Steve said gently. "I'm not going anywhere anytime soon, we can talk at length when you're able to string together a paragraph."
Tony shook his head, glancing back down, trying to get a scan over the ripple he thought he saw, but nothing was showing up. ‚ÄúThey look to be a sort of metal for sure, but that doesn‚Äôt mean that the insides are the same. They won‚Äôt stay still long enough for me to get a proper reading, but if I can‚Äôt get my hands on-‚Äú
"Yeah," Steve said slowly, quietly. "I'll be okay," Mary took that as the bullshit answer that it was, but didn't say anything. "It's just," he took a breath, and there was that sadness creeping out into his voice a little now. "I had a date."
Tony hesitated, wincing at himself. Peter was almost two now. Tony had wasted two years already. "Uh, no," he shook his head. "I didn't want to be around, actually."
Peter rolled the ornament back and forth between his hands, grinning as he watched it. He suddenly looked over at Mary, face very serious. "Mama, will Santa know to come here? He's never been here."
"I think I'm bigger than a hen," Steve replied, guiding Tony towards the living room.
"And it's cold," Tony said, his voice finding volume again. "Again, it's that whole lack of anything out there, no way for heat to stay when it has so much room to move about." Tony met Steve's eyes. "I was dying out there, I felt it, and I was so damned cold. I wish I could say that the last thing I heard was Peter telling me he loved me, and it would have been enough. Surrounded by absolutely nothing, to either drift for the rest of my life until whatever else lives out there found me, or to be destroyed by the explosion I delivered. It would have been enough because my son loved me." Tony shook his head a little, before tilting it up, eyes looking at the ceiling. "But, there wasn't, there was another voice. You've heard it. Before Thor took his destructive little brother back to Asgard."
"You need me, too." Tony leaned up to kiss him, then wrapped his arms around his neck. Steve slid his arms around his waist, giving him a squeeze.
"They-" Steve stopped. They what? They tried to remake him? They created life? How did any of that sound good? When the truth was that they had tried to make another Super Soldier, and they were going to use an innocent life for experiments. As he looked down at her though, the bright blue eyes, blonde hair, strong jaw line, he couldn't deny that she looked like him. In that moment, Steve knew what he was going to do. "She's mine."
"I'm upset that I didn't have a direct hand in it!" Tony turned them to head back towards the front of the mansion. He wanted to get down to his workshop now, to see if Jarvis had finished production on those punching bags. "You are so not like what my Dad described-" Tony stopped abruptly. That was a train of thought that he did not need to go down, especially with the man walking next to him.
"Who taught you how to bribe? Seriously, I think I need to ruin them, financially, at the very least, because teasing me is illegal." Steve wrapped an arm around Tony's shoulders, then leaned back on the couch to continue watching the show, smiling.
"And we have to move from subtle, to direct," Meg added. "And Gods above if the man doesn't get the direct route."
"You got it, Soldier." Steve grinned at him. "Can you believe that Rachel said we'd be a good couple?? I think she's starting to like me!"
Incidentally, becoming Iron Man put things into a bit more perspective. Apparently when you're a superhero, you get into even
She's struggling to figure out her counterpart's motivations for putting them here, in this specific suite.  Maybe it's because her body's still devoting most of its resources to digesting the chicken sandwich, but Tony finds herself stuck in a strange, senseless feedback loop of confusion, her brain running through endless circles of logic.
That strange sense of tranquility pops like a bubble when she feels Steve's hands slide under her knees and push, folding her up and in, the angle permitting him to push deeper.  Tony groans and encourages him with her body as well as her words, reaching out to help him draw her thighs up higher as she babbles mindless agreement and praise.  Her knees pretty much end up in her armpits, but Tony's plenty flexible and with every jolting thrust Steve slams against her g-spot.  Tony claws at Steve's hands and thrashes, all kinds of little grunts and moans spilling from her throat while Steve fucks her faster and harder--the benefits of sleeping with a super soldier.
Steve carefully shifts his body to be more accommodating, helping to support Tony's unsteady muscles as she attempts to assume a more dignified posture. Once she manages to sit up out of the protective cradle he's formed around her, she blinks the small amount of static from her vision, and is startled to see just how much close, personal attention her little fainting spell actually got her.
(Tony straightens her shoulders, and very maturely resists the sudden, utterly
A knock sounds on the door as Steve begins rolling up her cuff, and her counterpart enters the room.  He takes in the scene before him and wordlessly raises his eyebrows.
"Who are you?" Steve asks finally, breaking the silence.  These strange, new Avengers all stare at her.
She sits back a little and just...takes him in.  Miles and miles of beautiful golden skin, all the curves and planes of his well-toned body laid out on her sheets.  His sex-ruffled hair, the line of his jaw, the thick curve of his dick and the happy trail that leads to it, everything lit up by the glow of the arc reactor in her chest.  And it's all
Tony's very slow, very reluctant return to consciousness is eased by Steve's soft, skin-warmed t-shirt under her cheek.
"Get her a sandwich and a Gatorade and she'll be back to normal," Doctor Strange adds from about the same area as Bruce. Two doctors here to tend to her momentary physical embarrassment; Tony's such a lucky woman.
Tony eyes them both narrowly for a moment before she replies to Steve's question.  "Yes.  I'm filthy, so I'm getting in the shower.  I assume my Lanc√¥me products are gone?" she adds, looking at her counterpart.
"Thor, buddy," Tony sighs in relief, sagging back against Steve, "I have never been happier to see you and Schr√∂dinger's hammer."
Steve doesn't say aloud,
"Something's off about this place," she says under the wind, certain that Steve will hear her.  They're both turned away from any of JARVIS' cameras, which is the whole reason Tony picked this particular ledge in the first place.
Eventually, though, his brain caught up to his swelling heart, and Steve lifted a hand his mouth to stifle a bubble of rough, disbelieving laughter.  Eventually, though, the almost painful combination of grief and joy he felt in that moment bubbled and swelled up within his chest to the point that he couldn't hold it back any longer, and Steve swayed on his feet once before he caught himself on the edge of the sink.  Feeling dizzy, Steve dropped to his knees hard and braced his forehead against the bathroom sink, breathing hard.  He covered his mouth with one hand to muffle the sound, lest someone from SHIELD come looking for him, curled in upon himself, and laughed or sobbed almost hysterically into his own skin for what felt like hours, clutching the cold porcelain as he allowed himself that emotional release.  It was impossible to say which feeling won out, joy or sadness.  Maybe neither did.
The click of the door echoes in the empty room around her.
"Thank you, darling," Tony says, patting his hand obligingly. Steve smiles at her fondly.
wanna suck your dick.  I can already tell you're a ladies-first kind of guy, and don't get me wrong, normally I'd be on board with that--but if I don't get your dick in my mouth
When Tony comes, everything in her world goes white.  She drifts back to herself to several seconds later, every muscle in her body trembling as Steve bows over her and shudders his way through his own release.  She manages to unclench her fingers from where they'd twisted in his hair and pets him weakly as he spills inside her, her fingers limp and trembling.  Just that effort has the muscles in her arm shaking violently.
, that is hot.
Jesus fucking Christ--"
"Oh.  Sorry, of course," Doctor Strange says, blinking as he drifts out of his own thoughts.
Captain America looks like he's about to crack more ribs than he already has, if he starts laughing, but instead he exercises some very manful control over himself, places his hand over hers on his now sluggishly bleeding thigh, and says: "Please do shut up, Miss Stark."
‚ÄúNo, just don‚Äôt want to see your naked ass again,‚Äù Bucky snorted out. ‚ÄúSaw enough of that even before the Army. Tony can call dibs on all that.‚Äù
"I think you're doing pretty well with Peter," Mary told him, rubbing the top of his hand with her fingers.
Steve walked back out to the living room, lemonade and water in his hands, and saw that the opening credits to a movie were on pause. He plopped down on the couch and Peter leaned over to pull him closer, so that Steve was leaning against Tony's bent legs. "Thank you for the drink, Mr Steve." Steve smiled and ruffled his hair a little, smiling when Peter wiggled away to settle back against Tony. Tony snorted and rolled his eyes, a smirk on the corner of his lips, and wrapped the blanket back around them.
"She's naturally, uh, spirited," Steve explained.
Tony let out a little sigh. "I should be alive." He couldn't look at her. "Unless it was for a reason." As much as he loved his son, Peter was not enough of a reason for the Universe to keep him alive. "I'm not crazy, Pepper," he said softly. "I just finally know what I have to do. And I know in my heart that it's right."
"You're planning their wedding a little, aren't you?" Steve asked.
"This is a conversation that we can finish later," Tony cut him off, leaning in a bit closer. He didn't want Steve to jump on his back because he thought Tony was being crass, but they didn't have time to debate what should, or even needed, to happen with Barnes. "And it'll come, don't worry. Jarvis will be watching to make sure that there aren't like, any Hydra plants still active in his head."
"Some scientist got a little over-zealous in the lab," Tony told him. He leaned over, looking over the couch, frowning when he thought he saw something small sail past the window. "We've got it under control though."
"I'm sorry, Tony," he said quietly. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs in surgery, but, they‚Äôre doing everything they can.‚Äù
"I was not aware that designing a child's room was that difficult-"
"Yes," Tony said, nodding. "Do it right away, Jarvis." Tony turned eyes back to Steve to see his eyelids fluttering. "Hey, come on, open those eyes." Tony felt more comfortable moving to sit on the bed now. Steve's eyes opened, his pupils blown wide, and they stuttered around as he took in his surroundings, before settling on Tony. "There you are," Tony said, putting a gently hand on Steve's chest. His heart was hammering in his chest.
"Why's that, Peter?" Bruce asked, and now Tony glanced up a little.
"Because, I saw Steve leave your room this morning." Tony pulled the blanket back enough to raise an eyebrow at Steve. "Did you two have sex in here? I don't wanna sit on dirty sheets."
The door hissed back open and Tony's head shot up. Another scientist walked in behind Strucker, holding onto a clear container with white cloth inside. He put it on the lab counter before leaving.
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt go on that ride anymore,‚Äù Tony told him. He put a hand on Steve‚Äôs lower back to lead them out, gathering Peter with them. ‚ÄúI have a literal heart condition.‚Äù
"Did he serve?" Steve whispered to Mary. Peter had never mentioned it, but he needed to know something on how to proceed.
"Someone keeps back a lot of secrets, sounds like," Loki said with a little smirk. Of course he could smirk, he was able to sit down.
"Oh don't worry, I'll figure that out," Tony grinned. "Steve, my boys made me a pilot! A scoundrel even! I'm so proud!"
‚ÄúEeeeeeeeeveeeeeee!‚Äù Tony peeked through his fingers at the near howl like cry. It sounded sad. She was calling for Captain America, and he wasn‚Äôt responding. There was a knot of sadness in his chest, and he dropped to his knees. He only wanted to try and cheer her up.
"There's already an extra crib at the Tower," Steve said. "Two of them, but we only has to use one at the moment." Tony's brow furrowed in confusion. Steve looked up at him when he didn't say anything. "For Conor and Rowan."
‚ÄúIt practically is,‚Äù Tony said as he stepped in and shut the door. ‚ÄúThe living room has a fireplace and plenty of seating, and there‚Äôs a dining room there, and even a little bar and kitchen area. And then down there is the main bedroom with an attached bathroom, and right next to it is the second bedroom, and another bathroom. Plenty of room for us and the kids, with an awesome view of the park, if I do say so myself.‚Äù
Steve tilted his head a little. "You'd let Loki in your house?"
‚ÄúHe went into the kitchen with Uncle Bucky,‚Äù he told him, and they‚Äôre attention was turned back to Jamie. Tony let out a little giggle and headed towards the kitchen.
‚ÄúEeeeeeveeeee!! Veeee!‚Äù Tony closed his eyes tight, hand clenching the counter of the bar. Luckily his soft cries were hidden over Steve Rogers calls of joy. He quickly left the room, his heart feeling like it was breaking in his chest as Vee was reunited with her Steve. He wanted to get to his room and drink away the sounds of Vee and Steve.
"You have a light," Peter said softly, looking at the blue white glow.
"I know that he'll never ask me out, so I need to woo him." Steve was sure in his actions. He wanted to get to know Tony Stark, wanted to know what made him tick, wanted to help build up the self-esteem that had been chipped at since he was a kid. Steve wanted to be there for Tony, to stay in his life, to keep that warm feeling in his chest whenever he saw Tony smile, or laugh, when Tony really just let himself be him. "I've got outside help, but I need an insider."
"No, Sir." Tony groaned and let his forehead fall on his desk.
"Tony??" He turned quickly hearing Mary's whispered exclamation. She was standing there, keys in her hand, holding Peter in her other arm, the little boy asleep against her shoulder. Tony felt himself freeze, just taking them in, looking at Peter, at how he had grown even in just the three months that he was gone.
"I can be persuasive."
‚ÄúHe does.‚Äù Steve opened the curtain and grabbed the clothes next to Bucky. ‚ÄúHe does it happily.‚Äù
"Tony, are you sure about this?" Steve asked him, stepping up to the desk.
"Didn't think you'd want to talk about them," Steve replied. "If what Loki says is true, and you're feeling pretty lightweight, then you have a lot you don't say."
"It's really warm," Tony muttered. Peter scrunched up his face in disgust. "Learn from my mistakes, Peter."
"It's true," Mary said as she came out, sitting in a chair next to the couch. "Do you remember how small and cute our little Peter was?" She noticed Tony looking around.
Steve turned to follow him, watching him slip into Bucky and Meg‚Äôs apartment. He smirked playfully and hurried over to follow him. He heard Jamie‚Äôs squeal as he walked in.
"He likes to sleep on people," Mary said, smiling a little at Tony. "And you have the nightlight."
‚ÄúExcuse you, she learned all about toes today thanks to me,‚Äù Steve exclaimed as he started to clean up the counter. ‚ÄúYou will be losing your socks today, and if you find a small white sock out in the living room, let me know.‚Äù
Evelyn, as Peggy had called her, stood protectively in front of the little boy, glaring up at Howard. She remembered the older man.
Steve frowned as he watched another news station. It had already been a week after Monaco, and Anthony Stark was still one of the top stories. The cameras hounded him at every turn, so much that you could barely see the man when they showed him on TV; cameras, and microphones, cellphones, and recorders shoved in his face, Steve was surprised the man didn't start exclusively using the Iron Man suit to get around. No matter what he thought of the man as a person, Howard's son didn't deserve to be hounded as he was.
‚ÄúI like the cream they use here,‚Äù Steve said, grabbing his spoon to start siphoning more whip cream off the stop. He raised an amused eyebrow when Tony placed the stem on top of the spoon. ‚ÄúThey make it themselves, old fashioned like.‚Äù
Emotions. And Fluff!
"It's sometimes weird how much like a little adult he acts like," Steve commented in a soft tone. He knew what it was like to have to take care of things at a young age, to have to deal with illness.
"Hey, Petey." Tony stood up, lifting Peter up in his arms with him. He suppressed a shiver when Peter's hands found his arc reactor.
Tony had been holding onto the wall as he made his way to the door. As he left the stability of the wall he stumbled, falling to his knees. He couldn't catch his breath, his chest really hurt, and it felt like his eye were vibrating. There were people coming towards him and he quickly backed up until his back hit the wall. He hissed when he bent his wrist a little too much. There were voices talking around him and he pressed his hands to his ears, shaking his head.
"Well, no, not exactly," Tony crinkled his noise a little. "I've miniaturized the arc reactor-"
‚ÄúVeeeee!‚Äù Tony nearly dropped his mug he heard the delighted cry of Vee. All his Gems perked up, dancing around when Vee ran over to them. Tony‚Äôs ears were assaulted, in a good way, with all the chirps and trills of his happy bunch. He put the mug down, kneeling down when Vee jumped at him, catching her in his arms.
"Sometimes, your stream of consciousness is absolutely fascinating," Steve told him with a smile. Tony's breath caught in his throat as he watched Steve's eyes. He saw something change, something shifted, as he looked at Tony. Everything seemed more open with him. Tony pressed his face to Steve's neck, the blonde moving to wrap around the genius. He tried not to think about what it meant, what he saw, just grounded himself in the moment, knowing that Steve would be back in DC before lunch time
"Sir, Dr Banner requests your presence in his lab," Jarvis spoke up, thankfully quietly. "It does seems urgent." He let out a little groan, then pushed himself up, tablet still in hand, and headed downstairs. Tony trusts Jarvis to get through to the information while he's working with Bruce.
‚ÄúDaddy?‚Äù The two pulled apart and Tony, almost, silently groaned before leaning up.
"Got it in one," Tony told him quietly.
Tony suddenly reached up, putting a hand on Steve's cheek, and Steve stopped talking. He turned his head a little, almost hesitantly, and kissed Tony's palm. "Tony?"
‚ÄúSo your precious bosom buddy is going to want her first word to be something along the lines of Stark, Tony, Dad, or Daddy?‚Äù Bucky raised a brow. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not hoping for her first words being something along the lines of Papa? Or Pops, even Steve?‚Äù
‚ÄúHmmmm,‚Äù Steve rumbled a little. ‚ÄúI need a break, and so do you. I‚Äôve already cleared it with Mary and Phil, and even Bucky‚Äôs gonna pitch in. Of course Rachel and William will be more than happy to spoil the kids while we‚Äôre gone.‚Äù
Peter looked at Mary, his little jaw wobbling with tears, and fear. He didn't want to leave her, he didn't want anything else to happen, but when he looked back up into the sky, he knew that his Daddy would need help.
"Aye, it seems that my brother is still able to control a minor part of his illusions," Thor admitted with a nod. "I can report that they are unable to do anything other than possibly annoy."
"I know, and I wouldn't ask if it wasn't necessary," Coulson said quietly, urgently. "We're trying to track Loki as we speak, but we'd like you and Banner with us on the Hellicarrier as soon as possible."
Tony feels raw and overstimulated by the time Steve comes; he clutches her to him like a lifeline as he shudders and jerks, hands digging into her hips hard enough to leave bruises.  They don't part immediately afterwards; instead, they both relax slowly into a boneless, sweaty heap, after he pulls out, tangled in each other on the bed.  Tony sort of can't breath super well because Steve's lying completely on top of her, but hey: sacrifices have to be made.
Tony makes the mistake of pausing to look at Steve's face, then, and she stops.
"You're the light of my life, Steve," Tony finally confesses shakily. "I love you so much it scares me, sometimes."
idea," he confirms cryptically, but that little tidbit of information he divulges confirms one thing Tony's been suspecting after hearing his title: he's not the only sorcerer making magic in the world.
In which Tony keeps her word.
The elevator ride that follows is both awkward and cramped.  Man-Tony's elevator may be 1.5 times larger than Tony's, but it still isn't quite big enough to accomodate seven grown superheroes and one mystery wizard comfortably. In addition to the physical discomfort, Tony (who finds herself pressed possessively between Steve's warm side and the wall, because Steve a) refuses to let his guard down around an unknown, even if that agent is a teleporting magical sorcerer who may be the answer to their problems, and b) is still being
It takes them a couple hours to actually get anything clean, since they keep getting distracted, but eventually, they're toweling each other off on the largest of the suite's plush bathroom rugs, fresh and clean.  Tony feels a lot better now that all the grime of the past two days has been washed down the drain.
over you."
"I didn't ask," Steve replies, and Tony's about to huff out a laugh but then Steve folds back over her and pushes in.
When Tony Stark, Iron Man, meets Steve's eyes again, all she says, with an air of false casualness, is: "Once this is wrapped up, I'm gonna suck your dick."
That's not--I mean, Pepper is great, Pepper is
The lab door closes with a hiss, and Tony turns to her counterpart.
Tony and Steve's entrance on the main floor is greeted by some fairly awkward silence.  Tony, unintimidated and fully aware of her own sex-tousled state, gives the assemblage a once-over.
Steve chokes on his own saliva, which leads to an extended coughing or laughter fit, Tony can't tell which.  She pats his back stoically, and gestures to the others that it's okay to approach.
Once she has it together enough to think, Tony opens her eyes.
"Look, Nat, I don't know if that's--"
Many eyebrows are raised, as per damn usual, but anyone who ever expects Tony Stark to be anything less than the Head Bitch in Charge is either stupid or deluding themselves.
Tony goes, feeling strangely off-kilter, and lets him lower her down to the pillows before he looms above her, elbows bracketing her body on the bed.

If he focused long enough to think about it, he'd probably realize it goes both ways. The hair on the back of her neck prickles.
This chapter has not yet been proofread in its entirety, but I'm a lot happier with it than I usually am when I first post a chapter, so I'm posting it anyway.  I will go back and make minor edits later, catch any typos that managed to slip the noose, but this is pretty much its final form.  Also, this chapter contains fucking!  WOO!  Actually, this chapter is mostly fucking, tbh.  Anyway: as always, thanks for reading <3
Well, shit.
Tony-not-Tony turns off the monitor and looks at her.  He doesn't seem to know what to say.
Soft sounds are coming from the bathroom outside the shower, almost inaudible under the sound of the stream on the tiles and the pound of Tony's heartbeat in her ears.  Her anxiety only increases as the long, unbroken quiet stretches on, but she doesn't dare turn around.  Instead, she stands there and carries on washing herself restlessly underneath the stream, even after water alone ceases to be effective.
"JARVIS, are my clothes back from the laundry room yet?" she asks, already dreading the answer.  Steve freezes with one leg in his sweatpants, eyes meeting hers.
pops to the surface, even through the white haze of pleasure that clouds her thoughts.
Steve.
Hopefully.
As she takes more of Steve into her mouth, about three-fourths of the way down his nicely-sized erection (not too big, not too small), she reflects on this benefit and hums as his hands weave their way through the slight curl of her hair.  He chokes a bit, then moans when she draws back to tongue at the head, licking at the slit and enjoying the salty taste she finds there before tightening her lips around his frenulum and sliding back down.  With one hand, she cradles his balls, rolling them gently every so often, and with the other, she keeps him steady while she sucks.  Once she's halfway, she flattens her hand and, drawing in a breath, opens up her throat and slides all the way down to the base.
"I don't want to finish yet," Steve says, and it's--it's
Natasha, without speaking, grasps the sleeve of Bruce's pajamas and begins to tow him towards the exit. The Hulk puts up a token protest, but gives up soon enough and joins the Wonder Twins in the lift with an air of weary resignation.
Steve turns and looks at her with a raised eyebrow. "And?"
not wearing a real shirt. His sleek, mechanically advanced quiver is slung awkwardly over whatever shitty, threadbare tank top, he threw on before bed, and though he
Howard Stark had put about ten million round-the-clock guards on her, and gotten her extremely thorough self-defense training from the time she could walk for good measure. Good old overprotective Daddy dearest.
After the initial rush of exploration, learning, acclimatization, and adaptation slows, Steve doesn't have much excitement in his modern life.  Even New York City is only so big, and re-learning all its streets didn't manage to keep him busy more than a month.  A week in, he found he'd already memorized his words.
"It's important to stay hydrated, especially after strenuous physical activity," Steve replies seriously, wordlessly handing Tony another bottle.
Tony decided to start with before the battle actually happened, so there's a weird moment where all that's visible are red lights and the emergency siren blaring on the inside of her dark, empty lab.  Across the room, Man-Tony's brow is visibly furrowed.
Steve finally does, openly laughing as Tony seethes and fumes wrathfully at his face, intercepting and batting away her flailing, ineffectual punches with easy hands as she swings her tiny fists angrily at his body.
with his tongue and the thought is swept away by the white noise of pleasure.
Tony thinks faintly as everything clicks into place. No, of course. Of course; it all makes sense. Of course he hates her.
"It's the same for me," he admits hoarsely.
"Starks keep irregular hours," Steve adds blithely, glancing at Tony over his shoulder with a knowing glint in his eye that makes her remember the many, many times he's come to fetch her from the workshop in the wee hours of the morning.  She blinks back at him obliviously.
Once he'd finished, Steve lowered his arm slowly and stood in front of the mirror for a long, long time.  Just stood there and stared at the words he could see without moving his arm, speechless.  The absurd middle line
When the storm calms and Tony's head slows its spinning, some endless amount of time that's probably a few seconds but feels like hours later, her vision clears enough that she sees the limb her nails have been digging desperately into is Steve's right forearm.  She immediately knows, without checking, that his other arm is the one carefully supporting the curve of her back.
"Fuck off, Barton," Tony snaps, the same time as Steve says, "It's open now."
" he complains as he crosses the room to join them, rolling his eyes as if having someone make you a sandwich is the most annoying thing in the entire world. "Have it your way."
Steve smiles, and reaches out with gentle hands. "Come here."
" Tony concludes. "Except, news flash: I'm actually
"Okay, okay, that's enough; we've had our fun--Steve, you're free. Go on, we'll stop fucking with you," Tony says between laughs, grinning at her bemused fianc√©.
"...Is this a trick question?" Clint asks after a moment.
Thor--has
"Stop messing around and roll the footage, Stark," Steve says drily.  It's weird to hear him say her last name like that.  Man-Tony rolls his eyes and mutters something, but he complies.  All the Avengers fall silent as the recording from her suit begins to roll.
She's thought about it a couple times since their arrival, but she doesn't know how she'd be coping, if Steve hadn't shown up here, too. She'd probably still be shackled to a bed.
"I don't like him," Steve informs her a few seconds later, frowning minutely at the closed door.
"JARVIS, give the man a gold star," Tony says absently as she examines the grain of the granite. It's nice, clearly something high-brow and imported--a little bit darker than what Tony has in the kitchen at home.
"You're welcome," Logan says curtly. He unfolds himself from the couch and stalks out of the room. It'll just be more of the same shit if he sticks around; he can just see Kitty and Kurt independently gearing up to give him painfully earnest pep talks.
In which Thor arrives.

"The Doctor says he felt a disturbance in the Force and came to help.  He's here to address our doppelg√§nger problem," her man-self adds almost belatedly, glancing over at Tony with an appropriately quirked eyebrow.  Tony feels the corner of her own mouth twitch in return.
Fury doesn't usually have many tells.   The man is about as readable as a stone wall on a
Bruce covers his smile with his hand and waits a moment before clarifying, "Well, maybe not in the physical sense.  It's, well...you seem to know me, but I don't know you."
She's frowning thoughtfully to herself by the time Steve nuzzles restlessly against her shoulder.  Tony lets her hand drop as he lifts his head, and turns carefully in his lap, ignoring the pang of loss she feels as he slides out of her.
"Nah, I deserved it," he snorts, staring down into his drink ruefully. "I was being a jackass." He contemplates it for another minute, rotating the glass between his palms, then sighs and takes another swallow.
"...It's three in the morning," Natasha observes mildly a few seconds later with an aura of heavy judgement, successfully breaking the spell.  The knives in her hands have vanished to god only knows where on her person (she's wearing
"Your calves are halfway off the bed," Tony points out, because they are.  It looks ridiculous.  Steve chuffs against her skin carelessly and swings his offending limbs up, bending his legs at the knees to fit everything onto Man-Tony's admittedly comfortable mattress.
"You like that?" he murmurs against her mouth before he draws back.
"The suit? Three, maybe four hours, give or take; JARVIS will let us know when it's done," Man-Tony says, reopening his work. "But anyway, we've still gotta finish fixing your suit, Pixie Stick."
Bruce just looks confused.
Meanwhile, out in the kitchen, Clint holds out his hand triumphantly.
, you piece of hairy garbage--I KNEW I should've dropped you off the helicarrier when I had the chance; fucking--
"Can we get those taken off, please?" he asks Man-Tony, an edge of command in his voice.
There are three different tidy, well-appointed guest rooms near the end of the hallway, mostly for friends staying in the Tower, and this is where Tony initially assumes her counterpart is leading them.  Instead, to her surprise, he stops at the first door past his own.
There is a second door into the bathroom on the wall where she came in.  Tony opens it.  It leads into the foyer, where her counterpart and Steve still stand.  They seem to have moved past formalities and begun chatting, if the atmosphere is any indication; they fall suspiciously silent when the door opens and look over at her.
Tony smiles blandly. "Antonia 'Tony' Stark," she says simply. "Billionaire, genius, philanthropist.  President of Stark Industries, Avengers co-captain, Iron Man."
"I like it," he admits, tracing back and forth as if he can't help himself. "Couldn't tell you why.  Maybe because you feel more, this way."
"Lead the way," Steve offers, glancing at her counterpart with a long-suffering air.  Tony huffs, but follows along behind them anyway when they head out of the guest suite, shaking her head internally.
Almost.
When Bucky died--when Steve watched his best friend and the only real companion he'd ever had fall from the side of a train--he had no idea what to do with himself.  Bucky was
.  The realization sends a hot spike of arousal searing through her like a wildfire.
(See the end of the chapter for
He's sleeping. Passed out cold in a lab chair--and good thing, too; he's got the kind of dark circles you usually only see on post-doc candidates and med students doing residency.
There are--padded cuffs around her wrists and ankles.
" she argues, but then Steve's big warm hand cups the back of her neck, and, as usual, Tony sighs and gives up fondly.  She allows him to pull her in for a long, lingering kiss, his lips soft and warm as his hand scratches through her short-cropped hair.
"Will we be staying in the medical ward, or will we be moving to guest quarters?" Tony clarifies, for expediency.
"Glad we tickle your funny bone, Doctor," Man-Tony cuts in, hands in his pockets, "but for Cap's sake, and maybe for the sake of our collective sleep schedules--" Bruce's jaw cracks helpfully on a yawn. "--We probably
Steve does, which is how Tony knows he's a keeper.
"So, what do we do now?" Tony asks seriously, and watches as Steve instantly sobers at her change in tone. "We need a game plan, Steve."
"What, maybe I have a side career as a psychologist; you don't know," Tony says; he just snorts disbelievingly and gives her a look, a knowing glint in his eye. Tony stops bullshitting and says, "I was hoping to fix my armor."
"Yeah, okay, hot stuff; you've made your point.  Let's get down from the ledge before we plummet to our deaths play-wrestling," Tony says maturely, because she is actually the responsible adult in the relationship.  Nobody ever believes her, but it's true.
Tony looks between this Natasha and this Steve, both pale and solemn, and sighs heavily.
-He, I mean, my male double, my man-self--he's... he's probably with Pepper, if I were to guess, but then--what about
shit.  Her life--Steve's life, Thor's life, Natasha's life--has not and never has been easy, by any means.
"So...if you don't know how they got here, how, exactly, do you plan on getting them home?" Clint asks casually, voicing the thought that was in Tony's head.
He starts laughing, loud and mocking and clearly disbelieving. "A truce? What, like this is some kind of negotiation between countries? 'I'll stop bombing you if you stop shooting my journalists;' is that what you think this is?" Tony's face burns hot with humiliation and anger, but she refuses to give him even an inch of ground. She stares back at him fiercely, uncowed, even as he moves in close to deliver the final blow.
"Tony," Steve says, brow creased with worry, "Are you sure saying all that was a good idea?"
Still, she pauses in the moment before boarding the elevator and glances at Steve, just to confirm everything's okay.  His posture and the gleam in his eyes indicates he's staying because he has Things To Say, which is more or less fine--or has to be, because Tony can't stop him.  When Steve Rogers feels he has things to say, he won't be silenced.  SHIELD's sure proven that.
Other-Steve looks thrown (and a little aroused, but then Steve's always had a thing for fiery, independent brunette trailblazers), somewhat reducing Tony's opinion of him.  Man-Tony, however, is surprisingly unphased.  Point to him. "Uh, well, nowhere," he admits, "but the roof only really has cameras, if you stay away from the elevator."
What's even crazier, Steve thought as he pounded his fists into the faltering bag, is that he already has a good idea of who his soulmate is, personality-wise.  He isn't one of those rare folks lucky enough to get a name in his mark, but even without a name, his words still offer up a lot of information.
"Enjoy your sandwich," he says, smiling neutrally.  Tony ignores the weird flip her stomach gives when he says it.
"I--well--" Tony's gaze skitters back to his blank arm again before she blurts, "Steve and I are sort of--soulmates."
Tony needs a moment.
"Worst fucking soulmate
Understanding pours down Tony's spine like ice-water at those five simple words, combined with the muted sorrow in Thor's golden face.  Steve's hand on her shoulder squeezes.  Tony swallows, then reaches up and covers it with her own.
disgusting," Tony retorts intelligently as Steve sets her down gently on a barstool, because no matter what Steve or Pepper might say, she's allowed to act like a five-year-old sometimes.
"Well, that was...productive," Bruce contributes dryly in the silence.  "Now what?"
"Dammit, Buck; if they were gonna be born, they'd'a done it already," Steve cut him off, slurring angrily at the spinning pavement with his head between his knees. "So just...shut up, okay?  Tell me that again when I get some damn words on my body."
Tony is happy to find herself pleasantly surprised, and cocks her head to peer at the guy with renewed interest, reevaluating her previous opinion of him in light of this interesting exchange.
"As long as your boner is down my throat now, I literally do not care," Tony declares as she undoes his fly.  Without any ceremony, she tugs him gently through the waistband of his boxer briefs and sucks him down.
, Tony," he groans, sounding wrecked, and she gasps as he thrusts, testing, shuddering as he bumps right against her g-spot.
," she gripes, boxing at him with her tiny, un-armored hands as he starts to chuckle, "God, fuck me, you're such an asshole; I don't know why I put up with this garbage, really I don't--"
his breath on her hot like a brand, his skin sliding slick against hers.  He hovers above her like a vision, wet mouth open and panting, eyes hooded (his lashes are so long), staring at her through his halo of sex-tousled hair with an expression so intense, it
Having words doesn't fix everything.  It certainly can't replace everything that he misses, but... well.
"I believe the chicken in question is, indeed, current," JARVIS offers drily above them, right as Steve makes an affirmative noise and pulls a Tupperware container from the fridge's upper shelves.
there, arousal; how nice to see you again.  She can feel a tingle run down her spine as his long fingers smooth over the skin of her stomach; the thin t-shirt she threw on is riding up, and the tease of skin so close to skin is driving her nuts.
Steve pants against her shoulder for a few more seconds, his breath hot and humid as he comes down from his own orgasm.  "It felt pretty much continuous," he admits eventually, muttering into her skin.  Tony laughs.
"Apparently," Tony begins, "that sparkly portal?  Leads to another dimension.  One where soulmates aren't a thing."
"Ohh my gahhh--Steve,
come first.  These," Tony says, placing a hand over where her words sit under his shirt sleeve, "are on
"'Stark-Spangled LAN with a Plan'?" he says aloud, corner of his mouth curled in a suppressed smile.  Steve chokes on air, and Natasha huffs to her left.
Steve's still standing in the foyer.   When she looks back at him, he's flushed all the way to the neck.  His face is pinched with a combination of indignation, which Tony had expected, and anger, which... she hadn't.  His eyes are bright and burning with something Tony doesn't instantly recognize, and a shiver of unease runs down her spine.
Steve," Tony pleads, writhing in his grip and reaching back to grasp at his hair, his neck, his shoulders, any bit of him she can reach in her desperation.  She's
"Oh dear sweet holy mother of God, that is a
"If it's about Bucky," Tony begins cautiously, and sure enough, this Steve can't hide his flinch, "he's fine.  He has a soulmate, too, just like anyone else."
"Ugh--well, let's hope he thought to include a razor somewhere in there, because if you keep that carpet on your face growing for much longer you're going to sand off a layer of my skin," Tony complains, rubbing against the spot where his blonde five o' clock shadow had scratched against the tender skin of her face.

"Even if he were that interested, which I'm still not convinced he is," Tony begins, barreling on when Steve opens his mouth to interject, "Even if he
So instead, she looks at Steve speculatively, and says, "Once this is wrapped up, I'm gonna suck your dick."
Tony can feel her jaw drop.
actually know how to help us--help
" Steve scolds, raising one eyebrow at her when the camera swings towards him.
"You're welcome," Tony mumbles, slinging an arm and a leg over his naked torso. "Pull the sheets up?"
Fortunately for everyone involved, Tony manages
"Man, you weren't kidding. Jeez." She pinches her lips and frowns down at it. Back in her lab, this wouldn't be hard to fix, but...
Steve's blue eyes are sad, but honest.  "I don't think there's much
"What, did you have the Hulk pry me out of it?" she blurts incredulously, taking in the twisted, pulled-open pieces of the main body.  The limbs seem mostly intact, as her emergency release system appears to have done its job, but Tony chafes at the exposed, gaping hole where her arc reactor should be.  That's gonna be a pain to fix.
His soulmark reads, and Steve's eyebrows shoot up at the mention of 'blood' and 'metal' before he continues:
dimension, too, if Steve hadn't been hovering over her so carefully.
"I--it's been a long day," she admits wearily, turning to look over her shoulder at the Notvengers, who are crowding uncertainly at the entrance to the balcony.  Steve frowns and turns to follow her sightline, and Tony can see the moment when he sees himself because his eyes practically pop out of his head.
"She's fine," Tony hears Bruce confirm with mild amusement, close by and to her left. "She's just overworked." There's a rustling noise as he rises up from the floor next to her--apparently everyone's hanging out to her left, which makes sense, since Steve's taking up the entirety of the right.
Tony thinks.
"It took a pretty good beating," Steve says somewhat ruefully, setting it down on the table. Working together, they untangle and spread out the cloth of his ruined uniform until it's fully laid out, displayed so they can both see and Tony can get a better look. She leans in and frowns over it, hands running over the myriad of scorch marks and holes in the material.
"You said that one was a little sad," Steve complains, "not
"Tony," Steve murmurs lowly, his voice less than an inch from her ear.  Tony shudders, deep and full-bodied; she bows back, and, like he was waiting, Steve's strong arms lift and close around her.
Steve, still just a child at the time, believed her.  In fact, he waited earnestly for his soulmate's arrival for most of his life--up until his mother passed away when he was sixteen.  Weighed down by grief, the Depression, and his own steadily declining health, the future looked incredibly bleak, and Steve began to doubt he was destined for anything, let alone any
The wind was knocked out of her the second her back hit the ground, and Tony reels, flailing, when she finally comes to a halt, gasping for air.
Steve (like he usually does when Tony employs self-deprecating humor) gives her a stern look, but it's ruined by the way the corner of his mouth twitches.  Tony smiles smugly at him and, inwardly, feels proud of herself for breaking his foul mood.
Tony snorfles against his skin, not very ladylike or dignified but neither of them seem to care; Steve's chuckling too, an aura of smugness radiating from him.
"Great," Tony mutters. "Let's go meet the prince of draperies in a bathrobe.  Stunning."
Tony and Steve go their separate ways, and Tony finds her way down to her counterpart's lab. Unsurprisingly, it turns out to be in the same place as Tony's--same floor, same hallway, same sneaky, "secret" staircase down from an unobtrusive closet-looking doorway. On her way there, though, she takes the opportunity to check everything out.
Steve,
The last thing she remembers before waking up to this shit is falling through that mysterious, sparkly portal.  Mystery Asshole said she fell from the sky--so, they probably found her wherever the portal dumped her out.
Because Tony, herself, has been through some shit--some serious,
"Ah, god; Marie was right," he says when he finally gets a hold of himself, grinning as he looks at his soulmate's bemused expression. "Logan Howlett, X-Men. We can catch up later."
"Yeah, I love you too, you star-spangled piece of trash," she says, favoring him with a fully deserved look of disgust.  She crawls from his lap and points imperiously to the shower caddy. "Now make yourself useful and help me wash my body."
She snuggles up to Steve, almost on top of him, and when he shifts restlessly she patiently allows him to adjust their positions until she's actually laying on top of him, head tucked in the warm crook of his neck.
Steve has seen some shit.  Unfortunately (fortunately?), nothing could have prepared him for Tony Stark.
"They didn't give you underwear?" Tony wonders mindlessly as Steve nudges her gently back down to the mattress and tugs off her pants, tossing them gently to the side.
Man-Tony's sitting in a chair, facing away from her. He has to have heard her come in, but he doesn't say anything, doesn't turn or acknowledge her presence in any way, actually. He hasn't even tensed up.
"Stop being a bitch about it and come eat with us," Tony orders over Steve's elbow, "before an angry Pepper finds you later and force-feeds you something you hate." She gives him the flat stare of I-see-through-your-bullshit, and that is what finally does it: his shoulders sag, and he throws his hands up in one last expression of protest in his exasperated surrender.
Tony allows her mind to wander as Steve sucks on her tongue.  It's baffling, really, how easy it is to lose herself in the foreplay--at least, when it comes to Steve.  Tony used to be all about the quick and dirty, but sometimes she thinks she could sit and just kiss Steve for hours, lost in the feel of his body against hers, all his wet little pants and groans against her mouth as his body scrapes against hers.  He's gotten way more aggressive about taking control of the bed since the first time they met (which is hot as fuck and Tony is five hundred percent on board, yes please), which was also new, since Tony's pretty used to be Head Bitch In Charge.
That head had to be at least fifty pounds. He glances at the stranger's metal arm with a raised brow and says, "Nice arm, kid."
She pauses at the threshold, tumblers clinking in her hand, then steels herself and steps cautiously inside.
"By the Nine," comes Thor's wondering voice from one side of the penthouse, "it is truly exactly as you said."
Steve's words are in the most brazen, obvious spot: if he doesn't wear long sleeves, anyone on the street can see them, curling in an absurd number of lines around and around the center of his left bicep (the only thing that keeps him from throwing all the t-shirts SHIELD gave him in the dumpster is the fact that the handwriting is so slanted and loopy, it's nearly illegible).  Steve knows there's no scientific proof that the location of your words has anything to do with your soulmate's personality, but when he first saw the mark, all he could think was,
a 'why,'" he tells them, sinking into Man-Tony's expensive furniture as if he's sat in it a million times. "Whatever or whoever sent you here could have had no reasons, or any reason at all," he explains, lifting one hand apologetically.
Steve chuffs at her a little, like he does every morning.  Tony drops her fists onto his washboard abs and glares dully at his fond smile.
Tony groans, and she feels more than hears Steve do the same as he slides slowly in, lingering so they can both enjoy that first delicious push.  Her vision blurs, and Tony's eyes flutter closed as Steve begins to move, slow and steady and
"He's probably got something of Pepper's laying around," Tony clarifies, and knows she's correctly interpreted the look on his face when his expression clears and he looks slightly embarrassed.  "Steve,
This is almost too much of a mindfuck for even Tony to handle.
"Only if I get to return the favor," he returns, pulling her bloody hands off his quickly scabbing wound. Tony doesn't even give a shit.
They end up on a rooftop somewhere, Logan waiting for Ororo to finish her debrief with the Avengers, and his soulmate--Bucky--assuring him that he's clear to wander off.
my efforts with one that's
"Heaven forbid," Steve drawls blandly.  Tony tries to sigh, as they pause outside the elevator doors, but since she doesn't fully open her mouth it comes out as more of a snuffle.
mess," Tony retorts sweetly, reaching around his leg for the hand she's not currently keeping imprisoned and swatting his thigh with the other. "Now help me up, soldier."
Tony stops struggling. "Nat?" she blurts in disbelief, craning her neck off the bed. "Natasha?"
cope.
Steve; just get your dick in me, come on--"
He inspects it for several seconds, puts his fingers through a hole in the suit and frowns at it the same way she did. He wiggles them idly the same way she did, thinking, then says, "Yeah, I have something similar. Not for Cap specifically, of course, but it should work well enough. Let's give it a shot," he declares finally, gathering the suit up and moving away across the lab. Tony glances at Steve, who's been watching them with fascination, and grins at how unsettled he looks.
He's smiling at her, despite their being on the pavement with hundreds of frightened German civilians fleeing around them. Shit is on fire, some dude's eyeball has been violently removed, and Loki and his magic wand are being loaded onto the ship. Down the street, a car explodes.
"Would you like to tell me how you really got it?" her supposed friend asks quietly, raising one perfectly groomed eyebrow.  Tony's just about had it.
Natasha looks speculative.  Tony eyes her warily as the Russian super-spy rounds the table, trailing her fingers down Tony's armor.
"None of your business," he tells her, words so precise he practically spits them. He stares at her with real, open hatred in his eyes, then stalks around the table and starts cleaning up, shoving circuits and servos this way and that with sharp, irritated movements.
Steve squints into the early sunlight for a moment, wind ruffling his hair, then says, "Yeah, I get that feeling, too.  I don't know, Tony."  He sighs heavily and gives her a weighted look.  "Some things seem the same, but...I think not having words has made life different here.
"...What I'm hearing is that we aren't going home anytime soon," Tony concludes tiredly, releasing Steve's hand to take hold of his elbow, instead, and pressing the other to her eyes, trying to ward away the creeping sense of hopelessness and fatigue. The headache, which was only coming in waves earlier, has now developed into a full-force pounding, throbbing against her temples like a vice grip of pressure.
In this case, the mysterious teleporting stranger takes priority.
"Coming, Cap?" Clint asks once they're aboard, to Tony's surprise.  Not-Steve seems surprised, too, for a moment, then smiles a bit, shaking his head.
The feeling was still new then, but it still helped Steve pick himself up off the floor.  Once the initial tide of emotion had settled, he splashed some cold water over his face before heading over to the small desk in the other room.  There, Steve sat down, picked up a pencil, and wrote his words out on paper for the first time.
She's still whistling, these little, breathy shrieks, when she comes down from it, writhing in his solid grip as he stares, smiling, up at her, fingers still working slowly inside her.  She stares at him blindly beyond the low buzz of pleasure in her mind, then moans, "You're going to kill me," before she flops back, boneless, against the sheets.
She finds Steve on the balcony level with Bruce and Clint, looking over Steve's damaged suit. They all look up when she comes in, and Clint immediately raises both his eyebrows.
"I...have my suspicions," Fury said sourly, glowering at Steve across his desk.  It sounded as though he hoped those suspicions would be wrong. "Will that be all, Captain?"
"Yeah, Tinkerbell, I would," Probably-Male-Tony grinds out as if it costs him something, "if you hadn't put--ugh." He covers his eyes with his hand; Tony feels deeply envious. "Look, I'm gonna level with you.  I couldn't get past the firewalls."
The dust has fully cleared by the time Tony calms, sobs quieting to sniffles as she gathers herself against him, letting the rough but soothing fabric of his uniform and his familiar hand stroking her hair ground her.  She gives one last hearty sniff and straightens, blinking blearily at him.
Once she calms down, breath slowing and sweat drying in an uncomfortable, itchy layer on her skin, Tony can think a little more rationally.
Suddenly, kneeling there on the end of the bed in just her VS cheekinis, joking all said and done... Tony feels very vulnerable.
The door chimes softly and opens, admitting one Steve, who looks around with mild curiosity as he enters.
wants to know how it's doing that.
"And you're sure there's no way to investigate that?" Tony presses, stepping forward with her fingers twitching compulsively at her side.
"Ooh, baby, say '
Steve gives her a tiny nod, so Tony, mollified, shrugs gamely and climbs aboard. "JARVIS, take me up," Tony orders.  He does.
that wouldn't matter to him.  Above anything else, that man only ever wanted you to be happy."
"It's nothing, J," she mumbles quietly, pressing her eyes into her palms as her fingertips scratch through the edges of her hair, and focuses on ignoring the homesickness threatening to rise up in her throat like bile. "Just a thing we do as a gag, back home. Nothing you need to worry about."
Of course.  "Yeah, I don't know why I bothered expecting anything different.  Fancy a stroll up on the rooftops, darling?"
Other Steve stands near the two of them, hovering awkwardly in front of Clint's left shoulder. His familiar-yet-unfamiliar blue eyes are still full of concern, and his hands twitch involuntarily when Steve starts to ease her up to her feet, conflict clouding his face, as if he wants to come over and help but knows it wouldn't be welcome--knows that it isn't his place. It sends a weird, wobbly feeling of guilt fluttering through Tony's heart and down into her stomach, and she finally looks away, unable to keep watching him when he looks so sad and troubled.
, now that Steve is both recovered and obviously in his right mind.
Tony's words had been a cause for panic, when she was born. No multimillionaire wanted their kid to have words that reeked of violence--and kidnapping, to make it worse.
doesn't have my words on his arm, so as bad as I might feel for him, honey--because he's been dealt a shit hand, you can't deny that--you come first.  You will
she thinks, even as she reaches up and starts jerkily scraping the filth from her body beneath the flow of the water, just to give her hands something to do.
Carefully and gently, so as not to make any noise, Tony sets down the decanter and glasses she carried down from the bar. She looks at her counterpart for a moment, then shakes her head, huffing with a weary sense of empathy.
"I have to go pee," Tony says, ruining the moment.  Steve's laughter echoes after her as she wobbles to the bathroom on coltish legs to make sure she doesn't get a UTI.  After she pees, drains as much come out of herself as possible (so that she doesn't have to do laundry tomorrow; she has nothing against jizz, itself), and washes her hands, she grabs a wet washcloth, stumbles back to the bed, and cleans off her soulmate's dick before patting it lovingly and collapsing into bed.
Tony's vaguely aware of
as her vision blurs and the world begins to spin but it all seems like it's happening in distant slow motion.  She sways, once, like a stalk of wheat in the wind, before her balance gives out and her legs buckle underneath her.
"Had whiskey, earlier," she croaks carefully into Steve's leg, "Brandy." Because she might not be able to move her head, but if anyone's going to be talking about Tony Stark's health it's Tony Stark.
to interject with any untimely and potentially offensive Harry Potter references, and maintains at least the
Tony had trouble getting to this point, at first--she couldn't hold out.  The second, fourth, fifth times they'd fucked she'd had to look away, shy and uneasy under the new intensity of emotion she saw and unsettled by how much she felt in return.  Now, she still feels overwhelmed, but in a strange and sudden epiphany she realized at some point that all she ever needed to do was accept the feeling.
Tony's blood goes cold. "Wait." She can feel the heat drain out of her face as she comes to a disturbing conclusion.  Mystery Asshole's regarding at her with a sort of confused but angry suspicion that's starting to make a chilling sort of sense, despite Tony still not knowing who the hell he is.  Tony looks back at Natasha. "Am I--am I compromised, somehow?"
"I don't suppose you can let me in, JARVIS," Tony offers, wrinkling her nose at the giant painting of himself Man-Tony has chosen to display in this particular location. Ugh.
"I guess you'll do," she acquiesces after what she feels is an adequate amount of feigned hemming and hawing. Man-Tony shakes his head.
"It'd be good if I could get the armor operable again," she grinds out reluctantly, running over all the damage in her head. "It shouldn't take too long, if I can get the Man-Beast to let me use his lab.  And even if he won't, I'm sure I can still get in without his permission."
(This sort of thing is nothing new--Steve almost always does this if he's nearby when she gets caught without the suit. Tony, meanwhile, with her six black belts and bevy of un-suited combat experience, always inwardly rolls her eyes, but they've had conversations about his protective behavior a million different times, and Steve never budges, so. Tony appreciates the sentiment behind Steve's actions, if not the unintended mollycoddling.)
"Details," Male-Tony says, waving a hand. "Give us access to it."
"Steve," Tony begins, drawing their attention to her.  She keeps her eyes trained on Man-Tony as she continues, "JARVIS probably
Steve Rogers has always prided himself on being a level-headed individual.  Through the Depression, training, the War, and everything that came afterwards, Steve has always managed to keep it all well put together, as Bucky might have said.  And he supposes you can't wake up from a 70-year coma and cope even halfway decently unless you're already pretty good at handling anything life throws your way.
"Watching your ankles," Steve confirms as he sidesteps neatly into the kitchen doorway, safely guarding her tarsi from further abuse.
"Does she ever stop talking?" Clint's voice asks conversationally as her eyes adjust to the light, and she hears someone--probably Steve--shush him.
"Yes, Ma," he replies, swabbing his face roughly before leaning in to kiss her again.  This time, she obliges, meeting his lips sleepily at first, but as the minutes pass she feels more and more alert, stretching catlike against his body and returning the kiss enthusiastically.
He's got her propped up on one of his thighs, her legs splayed around his, and Tony is absolutely drenching his skin.  She rubs nonsensically against his leg, already babbling and begging and strung up tight as he plays her body like a well-tuned instrument.
Then, every other Avenger currently staying at the Tower pours out of it and onto the empty rooftop, battle-ready and with weapons and/or powers bristling--including two Steves, both wielding their shields.  Before anyone can do so much as blink, they've fanned out in a rough semicircle formation around the elevator like a well-oiled machine. They shift like predators once they're in their positions, five sets of eyes (and, Tony's certain, every single one of JARVIS's cameras) trained on the unknown and potentially hostile element, the intruder in their territory: Doctor Strange.
When he comes, Tony's not coherent enough to be excited.  He gives a final few thrusts and spills inside her with a groan, leaning over her and touching his forehead to her back as he comes.  She has just enough energy left to reach back with a shaky hand and pet his head, fingers threading through his sweaty hair as he shudders.
He jumps to another robot when the first begins to plummet, and is busy slashing into its chest cavity when the fucker spins out and plows them both into the side of a building. The explosion throws him down onto the street, and he lands with a grunt, shaking off soot and gritting his teeth as the burn wounds heal. Goddamn robots--at least the Sentinals didn't blow up, for chrissakes.
Man-Tony makes a retching noise as he follows them into the kitchen. "Disgusting," he tells them emphatically, a twist in his nose like just he's smelled something awful, "absolutely disgusting."
been through some shit.  It's not like his life has been all apples and oranges.
They sit there enjoying each other's company for a while, Tony relishing the feel of the wind whipping through her hair. The sounds of New York echo up below them, sirens and voices and vehicles blending together in the white noise of the city.
Tony spends fifteen or twenty frustrating minutes struggling heavily against her padded restraints on the easily queen-sized bed, jerking and thrashing and swearing with all of her pent up frustration at both her shitty situation and her friend's unexpected betrayal.  The bed, despite her efforts, does not budge an inch.  All she does is piss herself off further, leaving her panting and sweaty on the bed after she gives up while her mind positively boils with rage.
Tony feels vaguely offended.  She glances over at her counterpart, but the withering, muted glower he's serving up the Captain says that this isn't something unusual in their universe.  God, if this is how they talk to each other all the time, Tony's not surprised the relationship is tense.
, hel-
"Miss Stark, Captain Rogers," JARVIS says, interrupting the moment.
"Uncanny, isn't it?" she says lowly, looking over at her counterpart where he's putzing around the opposite end of the lab.
"Well?" he prompts.  Tony flinches.
His memories, after all that, aren't exactly A+. He forgets when his words first showed up, so for a while, he avoids anything that has to do with old people.
, soldier.
"Shit, I'm fucked, I'm fucked!" she curses over the comm, putting as much power into her forward thrust as she can before she hits the horizon and goes--somewhere. "Shit, shit,
Before she even registers the change he's got her shirt around her armpits and his other hand down her pants, and Tony swears and bucks as he mouths at her nipple while his other hand ghosts over her clit, fingers dipping right past it to slip into her wet, wet folds.
good angle," she slurs, feeling her body twitch again as he begins thrusting in earnest. "Shit, fuck, goddamn."
After all...as far as they know, Bucky never actually met his soulmate.
Throughout this speech, Steve has gone from looking dubious to looking dubiously reassured.  He reaches down to brush her hair away from her face and says, "As long as what I said before still goes."
you, Tony, not just physically."  Steve's quiet for another moment before he admits, "I would, too.  I think he feels exactly the way I would, if I didn't have you."
"Okay," Tony says finally, raising an eyebrow at him. "Spit it out."
" Doctor Strange corrects. "Look, I didn't know what sort of problem I was dealing with until I got here fifteen minutes ago; you can't expect me to show up here with an obscure universal transportation spell ready in hand."
Steve--Steve shudders and leans into her palm, presses his cheek against her hand with his eyes pinched closed.  When he opens them, they're as wet as hers.
Tony shrieks, all incoherent noises at this point, and she can distantly feel her hands scrabble against the sheets while her arms spasm and flail uncontrollably.  Her legs, especially, are twitching badly, and she worries that she might kick him in the head until he does this
Very, very slowly, and holding her breath, Tony peeks around the edge of the chair, using the same level of caution you might employ with an angry bear.
"Something tells me I'll need to use it soon," Tony says, not sure what compels her to voice the thought.
"Whiskey?" Natasha's gentle voice queries mildly somewhere to her left, the same time as Steve sighs wearily, "Oh, Tony..."
"That reminds me," Steve contributes as he clears the empty bottles away, tossing them into the recycling chute under the sink (same place it always is). "Where should the two of us plan on staying while we're here?" He shoots Tony a wordless glance, and she raises her eyebrows guilelessly: she woke up on a Hulk-restraint bed.  Like she said, she doesn't think he'll kick them out, but she has no idea where he intends to put them while they're taking up his space.
Eventually, once he'd let off some steam, things settled and he could think more clearly.  Part of him was feather-light, giddy with the revelation that
Loki's smartly got his hands up, so she lets Natasha and SHIELD land their ship, handle things, and immediately attends to the very important task of panicking over the extremely fit and extremely wounded national icon at her six. As usual, her mouth is on autopilot.
"Steve," Tony whispers, like a confession.  Her voice is hoarse.  She's trembling.
Her stomach turns.  It's an uncomfortable reminder that this universe's inhabitants are different from the people she knows.  Even Thor, usually so generous and lively, and who is so far definitely the closest match to his counterpart of any of the other Avengers (besides maybe Clint), has a weariness to him, a somber, weighted quality that the Thor Tony knows doesn't possess.  And Thor--
."  He curls his fingers up and rubs right up against her g-spot, making her twitch and mewl and nearly drool in his arms.  While he's working away inside her, rubbing slow and torturous, he puts his mouth back to work and starts licking gentle circles around her clit.
When Tony returns to the now, Steve allows her to take the lead, lets her coax his lips open and bear his delicious mouth to hers, so sweet and responsive, but when she flicks her tongue sensually against his it's like flipping a switch.
"Oh, for
Her counterpart seems to think similarly, or follows her lead, at the very least. "Avengers," he declares, pitching his voice to carry and gesturing grandly as he steps forward, "Meet Doctor Stephen Strange."  He strolls casually through the neutral space in a bold move, obviously intended to defuse some of the tension in the night air.
Steve doesn't respond.  Instead, he's frowning at their joined hands in his lap, which--oh.  Right.
"You're welcome," Man-Tony returns, because apparently it's a universal constant that she's an ass.
Natasha--or maybe the Black Widow, with the shit she's pulling--doesn't say anything, just turns around and walks calmly out of the room.
"Thanks," Tony says with a smile. "Same to you."
The thing Tony really misses, walking through this version of the tower...is some subtlety. Everything is about 1.5 times larger than it is back home, every appliance and every entryway, and honestly, Tony knows she has an enormous ego, but
Voice 1 and Voice 2 don't seem to have realized she's awake, still talking quietly, so Tony decides to do what she does best: draw attention to herself.  She groans loudly, shifting and stretching where she lays as she gets her bearings, listening for her captors' reactions, and freezes when she feels her movement arrested.
the dad face.
A month and a half in, once the initial flood of grief had passed and the reality of the whole situation started to set in, having something to focus on helped Steve cope.  He finally worked up the courage to contact Peggy one day--Peggy, whose words had apparently appeared mere days after Steve went down in the ice--and after they finish catching up, he confessed to her quietly that he didn't feel like he deserved this.
By the time the lab door opens before her, Tony's feeling very sober--too sober. She makes a split-second decision and doubles back to the bar for a decanter of whiskey, hoping the booze might serve as a peace offering as she hurries back to the lab.
"I'm afraid you've got me at a disadvantage," he admits, observing her the same way he might something in the lab.  Tony snorts.
She'd like to stay and watch Man-Tony and JARVIS work for another moment longer, but the itch to get her own hands on a piece of tech gets to be too hard to ignore. Tony turns to get Steve's attention, then stops, blinking with surprise. His eyes are already focused on hers, bright and arresting.
"Only if you tell me what your other half thought she was pulling earlier," Tony says flatly.  Bruce's resulting flinch is satisfying.
In the meantime, she gets a handful of Cap's thick blonde hair and seals her mouth to his.  He groans and arches his body to meet hers, and the hand on her leg slides back and up to settle just underneath her ass.  His other hand mirrors it shortly, gripping her firmly while she moves her lips wetly against his, her tongue flicking out to slide against his sensuously.  She slides her free hand up to join the other in his hair and clings to him tight.
"...Ah," he says, looking between the two of them with new understanding. "Well, then. That, unfortunately, will be why I'm here."
"Which do you want first, your literal falling out of the sky, or your unexplainable possession of an Iron Man suit?" Mystery Asshole drawls, his sharp tone at odds with what he's saying.  Tony bristles.
so on the next downstroke, and Tony's eyes roll back into her head.
Then, without any warning, fingertips brush softly against Tony's spine, between her shoulder blades.  She jerks, shoulders drawing back on reflex, flinching up and out of the slight hunch she hadn't even realized she'd assumed.
He hasn't looked at her this whole time, Tony observes. She watches him stalk about in his bare feet with mild, unfeigned interest, simply curious to see what he'll decide to do next. The whole barefoot thing is very interesting, actually, because bare feet mean he was too preoccupied to grab socks or shoes before he came down here. Usually that only happens when Tony's struck by some brilliant idea that absolutely can't wait for stupid things like foot coverings, but considering the circumstances she's going to have to go with door number two: really thoroughly fucked with. Obviously this whole dimensional travel thing has shaken him up way worse than he's letting on, if he's using the lab to cope. The anger, too, she recognizes as one of their biggest defense mechanisms; it's a way they avoid confronting things that upset them on a deeper level. Interesting.
Tony doesn't fully put together the exact mechanics of what's happening at first, only conscious of the slick slide of him within her as her hips lift and drop, the vice of his perfect hands squeezing around her as her ass brushes against the hot, muscled planes of his lower abdomen.  Her muscles tense and her feet scrabble for purchase that they're unable to find, her legs too short to reach the floor from her position on Steve's lap.  When her leg slips and bumps awkwardly against his and he doesn't even stutter in his rhythm, Tony suddenly realizes exactly what's happening: Steve's legs and hips aren't moving at all.  He's just effortlessly jacking her entire body up and down over his dick, using nothing but his arm strength--
Tony's still not really sure what to make of it as her counterpart keys in the passcode, and the off-kilter, strangely confused feeling stays with her as they follow him inside, moving from the hardwood hallways to thick, plush carpet.  She wanders further into the suite as her counterpart begins talking to Steve, telling him something about passcodes and privacy locks and JARVIS helping them access things.  Tony's already more than capable of navigating the Tower on her own, so she doesn't bother paying any attention to the conversation and strays out of the room, instead.
are still my soulmate.  You.
"Awesome, I thought I remembered that correctly," Man-Tony says delightedly, visibly pleased with himself.
But Steve--Steve
"Hmm?" Steve says, ducking his head closer with a quizzical brow.
Why put them in the Pepper suite when there are three other perfectly good rooms just down the hall?  There are plenty of reasons, of course, but none of them really seem sufficient: to keep an eye on them (unlikely), as a show of trust (unnecessary; he just helped her fix the armor), an olive branch (ha)...
which means Tony knows exactly what that pinched, cloudy-eyed look means, guarded as both Steves seem to think it is.
" Tony explodes frustratedly as the elevator doors slide smoothly shut behind her. Everyone but Clint and her counterpart starts at the outburst.  Natasha's eyebrows flick up and Bruce's hand jerks reflexively to his chest (Tony's probably going to kill him someday).
"Thank you," he says, very seriously and earnestly, his big hand warm on her skin.  Tony swallows and, despite the heat that's immediately pooling low in her abdomen, glances at his arm.  His bicep is still very bare.
"Yours has a much better sense of humor," Man-Tony says as they head back to their work stations. "I must admit I'm jealous."
"...So I'd gathered," Doctor Strange replies, his smile pleasant but subdued.  An aura of mystery surrounds him.
Tony stops and glances back over her shoulder, raising an eyebrow. "Yes, Steve?"
Yes, Tony still has his arc reactor because reasons; idk, just ignore like the last 5 bullshit minutes of Iron Man 3 or something.  Tbc, since this unholy creation seems determined to exist.  Yay-we-didn't-die relieved sex accompanied by a rating change is incoming next chapter, yaaaaaaay!
," Tony sneers as they head back towards the elevator. "See where it gets you."
"Steeeeve--St--Ste-
After a moment, Tony heaves a sigh and opens her eyes.
that the real and only reason you're being such an asshole to me is because I'm
Tony murmurs agreement, but that's quickly choked off in favor of a breathless inhale when his hand dips lower, just brushing over her lips and the wetness that's been forming there for hours, now.  She shivers and twitches when his fingers dance over her clit, and her hands shoot down to grasp his wrist.  He glances up at her questioningly.
Tony honestly doesn't know how she would feel if she didn't have this constant sense of stability and rightness in her life.
"Steve, Steve
of him.
"JARVIS, turn off the lights," Tony mumbles as she snuggles into Steve's warm skin.
Tony just smiles at him, fond and sleepy.  "Yes, it did.  Now go to sleep."
She was a little shaken up by all this interdimensional travel business yesterday, when she first arrived in this place, but now that she's aware enough to figure out what's going on and see the direction they need to be going in, she's gonna consummately make it happen, thanks.
The doors close, and her friend raises an eyebrow.  "So," he says, because Barton is the king of segues, "you wanna talk about it?"
"That's beside the point," she asserts as he begins walking towards the kitchen. "What if I had fought you? I have six black belts; I could have stabbed you in the eye with my fingernails. What if, with all your supersoldier strength, you had--wait. Hang on a second," Tony says suddenly, shoving at Steve's left shoulder to get him to turn around once she realizes something very important.
"You know, I think that's the fastest I've seen him move since we got here,"  she observes, peeling her pants free from her calves and shucking them off.  She lifts the grimy, bloodstained material up for inspection, turning the denim in her hands and wrinkling her nose. "JARVIS, where's the laundry chute?"
.  On the 'bright' side (haha, Tony's so funny), they keep her from having Afghanistan flashbacks, so things could be worse.
She finally gets close enough she can drop awkwardly to her knees, shuffling closer and ignoring the broken glass that cuts into her jeans as she whispers, "Steve, Steve, baby, are you okay, are you conscious?  God, please
"You're such a disgusting morning person," she mutters while she levers herself up in a futile attempt to speed the wake-up process; her side twinges, and she grits her teeth and willfully ignores it it.  Steve, obligingly, scoots up just enough that Tony can sit in his lap, her legs splayed out on either side of his trim hips.  His thumbs stroke the jut of her hipbones while she rubs her eyes with her fists, bed headed and grumpy, and waits for her brain to come fully online.
"Yes," she confirms once again. "Logan's a jackass, but he and The American Sniper get along pretty well, between all the bickering.  He's a mutant, too, so they've both got the longevity thing going for them." Tony waves a hand vaguely. "The universe finds a way, you know; all that romantic, existentialist junk.  They have a cat now, apparently; it's all very domestic."
