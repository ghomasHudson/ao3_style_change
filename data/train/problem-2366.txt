Just as Draco was about to reply, there was a clattering outside the compartment. Harry opened the door and saw a dimpled old woman pushing a trolley laden with sweets and treats, all of which Harry had never seen before. There were chocolate frogs, liquorice wands, sugar quills, pumpkin pasties, odd-looking jelly beans and more.
Harry received a new chemistry set from Sherlock, three books on solving crime from John, several books on magic from Hermione, a large amount of sweets and chocolate from Fred and George, and an enchanted crystal magnifying glass from Draco.
“EXPELLIARMUS!” yelled Harry, pointing his wand at the startled headmaster. The wand flew from Dumbledore’s hand and Harry caught it, shoving it in his pocket before running to the headmaster and shoving him into the wall.
"Move along now," said a sharp voice. "The Sorting Ceremony's about to start."
Once Harry had recovered, he knocked on the door. It was opened almost immediately by Hermione, her hair even bushier than usual. In her arms was a thick, leather-bound book. She ushered her friends inside, much to the annoyance of the others in the common room. And what a common room it was.
"Harry Potter?" she asked with a heavy Scottish accent.
"I'll be off then. I do not want to anger my father. I'll write to you," he said. Harry waved goodbye as Draco walked towards a blond couple. They looked happy to see him, though his father scolded him slightly.
221b Baker Steet, Marylebone, London.
"RAVENCLAW!" The table second from the left clapped this time; several Ravenclaws stood up to shake hands with Terry as he joined them.
"Harry Potter. Nice to see you," he said, sitting up.
"My name is Sherlock Holmes. I'm with the police." The door opened.
Around halfway through the day, after Harry had finished reading most of the books, there was a loud rumbling and the apartment shook slightly. Bloody lorries, he thought to himself, then he returned to his book. The rumbling didn't stop. Harry got up and walked to the lounge to see what was making the noise. After checking the window, he saw that it was not made by lorries. He walked around the room. The noise seemed to be coming from the fireplace. Suddenly, hundreds of letters flew into the room from the chimney, covering the floor and floating through the room. Harry looked out the window again and saw dozens of owls fly past.
"Peeves," he said, leaning on the wall to catch his breath. "That poltergeist has got it in for me." Harry nodded and continued walking down the hall, leaving Neville behind. A flash of glass caught his eye. A small, glass ball was rolling down the hall. He picked it up.
Scotland Yard was bustling with police officers. No one really noticed the family as they made their way to Lestrade's office.
Harry had changed a lot in the past month. While he was still quite skinny, he was no longer emaciated. Almost everything brought a smile to his face. It had taken a long time for him to get used to three meals a day and not having to cook or clean the whole house just to get it. He had also begun to try and figure out where his scar had come from. It was an odd shape and didn't seem to be from any regular cut. He still liked it though. Though his fringe often covered it, he would gladly show it to every person he met.
"Holmes," said Harry. Draco looked shocked.
The flat of Sherlock Holmes was a messy one. Why bother tidying when it was almost impossible to forget where everything was? There were clothes and papers strewn across the floor. What little carpet could be seen was stained with chemicals. Some parts of it had been burnt through entirely, revealing the cheap wooden flooring beneath. There were clear paths that lead from the front door to the kitchen and to the small bed.
“Albus Dumbledore, you are under arrest under suspicion of manipulation with intent of returning a child to abuse. You do not have to say anything, but it may harm your defence if you do not mention when questioned something which you later rely on in court. Anything you do say may be given in evidence.” Lestrade cuffed the startled headmaster and marched him out of the room. Everyone followed quickly, but Harry was stopped by John.
And don't get in a flap!
There are so many of you guys, it’s really insane, and thank you all so much for reading
“Nothing,” replied Harry, inspecting the footprints. “Three days old, size eight, uk, around 170 cm tall, and-” he picked something up off the ground- “shoulder length hair, ginger. And, judging by the footprints, we have a wizard on our hands.” Sherlock swore.
"I’m sorry to say I sold the wand that did it," he said softly. "Thirteen and a half inches. Yew. Powerful wand, very powerful, and in the wrong hands … Well, if I’d known what that wand was going out into the world to do …"
"Hello, Harry." The boy looked up at the man. "You're going to meet a friend of mine. She'll help you get better. Then you're going to move in with me." Harry nodded, and, in doing so, shifted his fringe, revealing an oddly shaped scar. It was like a lightning bolt.
Dead flies and bits of fluff,
"One of four in this house," said Sherlock. McGonagall raised an inquisitive eyebrow. "My brother," he gestured behind him, "my son," he pointed to Harry, "and my husband," he pointed at John, who waved at the professor.
A pink-faced girl with blonde pigtails stumbled out of line, put on the hat, which fell right down over her eyes, and sat down. A moment's pause –
Upon seeing these things, Sherlock Holmes decided to investigate. These people were hiding something, and he was determined to find out what it was. The opportunity to do just that presented itself only a few months later. A murder on Privet Drive, the very same street the Dursley's lived on.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Well, we should get ready then," said Sherlock.
"I think so. It's never hurt like that before. Probably nothing." He picked up his goblet and took a sip of pumpkin juice. "This is so gross," he decided, putting it back on the table. Harry looked up at the top table. Quirrel was talking to Snape. There was another spike of pain through his scar.
"Is this all for me?" asked Harry, incredulous. The plate had a piece of jam toast, a couple slices of apple, and a glass of orange juice. Not a lot of food, but to Harry, it seemed like a feast. Sherlock cursed the Dursleys under his breath. Who could let a child live like this and still sleep at night? It was disgusting.
"Jeez!" exclaimed John, grabbing Sherlock's hand.
HOGWARTS SCHOOL of WITCHCRAFT and WIZARDRY
"There was a murder." The man's face paled. "I'm here to question you. Not that I think you did it." Mr Dursley begrudgingly let him in.
"Where are we going to go first?" Harry asked McGonagall excitedly.
When they stopped outside The Leaky Cauldron, Harry paid the cabbie and the five of them climbed out. Harry pulled up his hood to cover his face and they all went inside the stuffy pub. Nobody recognised them and they managed to get into Diagon Alley pretty quickly.
"I'm Sherlock Holmes, this is my husband, John Watson, and our son, Harry Holmes." The giant looked quite shocked.
Sorry for taking so long, and that this chapter is so bad. I made a few bad decisions concerning sleep and writing my main novel, and had basically no energy to write anything other than a few short fics for my friends. Thank you so much for everyone that has read and commented. You're all awesome!
"Thank you, Hagrid. I will take them from here." She pulled the door wide, revealing an entrance hall so large the 221 building could've fit comfortably inside. The stone walls were lined with lit torches, not unlike those at Gringotts. Harry looked up and could barely see the ceiling. Opposite them was a magnificent marble staircase. McGonagall started to walk towards a dor. The students hurried after her, none of them wanting to be left behind. Harry could hear the drone of hundreds of voices coming from a door off to the right.
"Okay. Sounds good." Harry then began to eat his meal.
If the outside was grand, the inside was on another level.
"That doesn't sound too bad. Though I think he wants to control every aspect of the school. The first person he sent to take me to Diagon Alley insulted my dads and said they weren't my real parents, while also seeming like a really nice guy, and I reckon Dumbledore had a hand in it."
“Hey, Harry,” said Draco, coming over to the Gryffindor table.
Harry smiled. He wasn't allowed chocolate cereal very often because it was bad for him, so he poured himself a massive bowl. It almost overflowed when he added milk. After carefully transferring the bowl to the table, he ate it all as fast as he could, making sure that he didn't get drops of milk on his uniform. Once he was done, he washed his bowl and grabbed his backpack. Inside was a couple of exercise books, a pencil case, and a Nancy Drew book. Harry loved the young detective and all of her books. Upon reading the first one, he had begged Sherlock and John to buy him the rest. They gave in eventually and he had been reading at least one a week.
The taxi slowed to a stop outside of an old, grey hospital. Sherlock got out his phone and texted Molly Hooper.
"Are you okay?" Draco asked, worried. Harry rubbed his scar and grimaced.
"Right, of course. I apologise. Hold out your wand hand." Harry held out his right hand, assuming that's what he meant. Ollivander produced a tape measure. It started to measure Harry's height, arm length, the distance between his nostrils.  It took him a second to realise that it was doing this itself, as Ollivander was searching through the boxes.
"What I don't get," said Draco, "is why Hogwarts would be safer than Gringotts. Whoever tried to steal the object before would probably know that it was moved here, so a potentially dark wizard now has reason to come here. That's something I wish I hadn't thought of-" he trailed off, looking slightly distraught.
“I doubt that,” said George when Draco explained that real witches and wizards would get caught on purpose in the Salem Witch Trials.
"What do you want, Sherlock?" asked Lestrade in a tired voice.
"Legilimency," said Harry. That didn't seem to clear it up for the twins.
"You know we can do magic now," he said, bringing out his wand. Harry smiled and bright his out too, whispering the spell to activate the runes. Each of them lit up with a bright golden glow, then faded slightly, though kept on emitting a slight light.
Harry searches the platform for a familiar face, and saw a flash of blond hair. Draco was standing around with some kids his own age and a blond man, clearly his father. Draco looked quite bored and was also searching the platform. He locked eyes with Harry and immediately ran over.
"Whatever it may be, it's an issue for tomorrow," said Draco as they entered their dormitory. Harry nodded and got changed. Once he was ready for bed, it took him a lot longer to fall asleep than usual. When he finally did, his dreams were filled with dogs and trapdoors.
Sherlock shrugged. “No, I’ve realized that I’ve done all that I can. I’m not happy about it, but…” he took in a deep breath, “I fear I may do more damage than good at this point.”
John turned around to gawk at Sherlock. “Really? Holmes, I could have deduced that.”
Sherlock waved Mycroft off. “No, I can manage that too, dear brother.” He ended with a smile.
He slipped the note underneath the pot before making his way over to a section of his bookcases that lined the interior of his office. He ran his hand along the spines of the books before he stopped on a copy of Alexis de Tocqueville’s
“Perhaps,” Sherlock began as he stared out the window, “he was led here under false pretense.” He then turned quickly, sprinting toward John before grabbing him by the elbow.
so late. Would have been nice to use your newfound deduction skills earlier.”
“Holmes, you need to calm yourself. When my men questioned Dr. Carberry’s servants, they said that they heard Dr. Watson arguing with the victim late last evening. He was the last person they saw visit the house.”
Sherlock let go of William as John got a better hold. “Gentlemen! Neither of you is the murderer.”
Sherlock nodded. “I’ve done some digging. I went to Carberry’s and found—”
Sherlock chuckled as he sat back in his chair. “You would be amazed, my dear Watson, at what some people are capable of doing in order to hold onto power. Whitehall has his eyes on the Prime Minister.”
“Watson?” Sherlock repeated as the inflection in his voice raised with concern.
Sherlock’s expression changed as John rested his hands on hips. “Not to say this is your fault, Holmes. But…from the murder to the prison to the drugs…it seems too interconnected as if—”
“Gladstone!” Sherlock cried out as the dog took him down to the ground. John swiftly shoved both Sherlock and Gladstone into the room before closing the door quietly. Sherlock was pinned to the floor with Gladstone licking his face.
“Lestrade, were those paintings returned this morning?”
Mr. McArthur stepped forward. “But, Mr. Holmes, how did you know that…,” he waved a hand at Madame Loire’s son,” this ghost over here knew the ‘Lotus Encounter’?”
“We need to leave, Watson.” John felt Sherlock pull him up to his feet.
Lestrade sighed heavily before answering. “I don’t know what that has to do with the matter at hand, Holmes.”
“Sherly,” Mycroft stepped forward, “I really think you should take it easy…there’s not much we can do at the moment…” he paused as he watched his brother then walk over to the fireplace, “Sherly.”
“Viktor Fedorov and William Davenport. William’s family owns a railroad company in America. Fedorov…” Mycroft stopped suddenly to pose thoughtfully, “well, actually, I’m not entirely sure
"They went back to the leaky cauldron," said Harry. Harry and Draco sat behind the crates for a long time, talking about their families and their lives. Draco was fascinated with every aspect of solving muggle crimes, and Harry wanted to know everything about the wizarding world.
"Do you use a different currency system?" asked Harry excitedly.  McGonagall nodded and began to explain the different coins and how much each was worth.
"I can put the runes on your wand if you want. You'll just have to say the spell and they'll work for you." Draco nodded and handed his wand over.
For I'm the Hogwarts Sorting Hat
"There's breakfast in the dining hall, if you would prefer," said Mycroft, wrinkling his nose at the sulphuric smell of pork.
"Slytherin has been perfect," said Harry curtly. "Why did you want to talk to me?"
"You're late, Mr Holmes." He said in a deep, unsettling voice.
Just as John was about to explain, Mycroft came back. He looked at McGonagall briefly before turning to his family.
"The Holmes family isn't magical," said Harry to Griphook.

The giant ma stepped through the doorway and looked at the ruined door sadly. He picked up the two pieces and placed them back in the doorway. Then he muttered something under his breath and pointed the pink umbrella he was holding at the door. Suddenly, the door looked brand new. Sherlock and John gasped. Harry smiled slightly. So magic was real, he thought to himself.
Thank you so much for reading and 92 kudos is insane!!
Soon the four of them were standing in the entryway of Gringotts. There was a plaque next to the door. Engraved on was a verse that sounded quite threatening.
After ordering some furniture from IKEA, Sherlock made a new room in his mind palace and began to fill it with information about raising children. It seemed that it would be fairly straightforward, but also quite time-consuming. It also looked as if his current living arrangements were inadequate. Perhaps it was time to move. He quickly went through all of his contacts, trying to decide who might be of assistance, and settled on an old lady known as Mrs Hudson.
“Why are you doing this, Malfoy? Why are you trying to be nice? We both know this is torture for you, so why bother?” Malfoy looked strangely taken aback. He opened his mouth to say something, but Harry cut him off. “Just piss off. I can’t deal with you right now.” A flicker of hurt crossed Malfoy’s face, replaced by confusion, then steely grey malice. He turned and stalked away, leaving Harry to bury his face in his arms, trying to rid himself of the headache.
"Good morning, Dad, Dad," he said. They didn't say anything, both too tired to think straight. He turned all the lights on and left. The two men groaned and got up.
"She's just super fast," finished Fred.
"Well, I think I'm done with reading today, so, if it's alright with you, I'm going to get some lunch," Draco said, walking out of the library.
"It's okay, babe," Sherlock said softly, trying to calm his husband down. It seemed to work, as John stopped fighting, but he still looked so angry.
"Saint Bartholomew's Hospital." The driver nodded and pulled out onto the street.
"What do you mean?"
*  *  *
On the fifth night of his nightmares, Harry finally gave up. Sleep left him exhausted and often terrified. When he was sure his dads had gone to bed, he slipped down to the kitchen and made himself a strong cup of coffee, slowly walking back to his room, sipping the steaming cup.
They climbed into a waiting taxi.
"Bulstrode, Millicent" then became a Slytherin.
Right, so I know I said I wouldn't be updating, but since I no longer have school due to the lockdown, I have a lot more free time than I was expecting. I still won't be updating often, as my other project takes priority, but I might publish every two weeks or so, then I'll go back to posting more often.
Sherlock was silent for a moment. "Well," he said finally, "if you want, you could become Harry Holmes. You could become my son." Harry contemplated this for a second, then nodded.
"Hello," said Harry. "I'm Harry. Are you going to Hogwarts as well?"
Together they not-so-carefully began moving the old man. Harry knew that McGonagall could easily use a spell to transport Dumbledore painlessly.
"The Chocolate Frog card," Harry whispered, finally remembering where he had seen Flamel's name before. "Here you go. I have to go." He dropped the ball in Neville's hand and sprinted down the hall, back down to the common rooms.
The Dursleys were - to an untrained eye - a perfectly normal family. They had a son, Dudley, who was only a few years old, a nice house in Surrey, and, it seemed, not a care in the world.
"And this was just an everyday thing for you?" asked George incredulously as the five of them walked back up to the castle.
Harry led her up the stairs into the lounge. Fred, George, Hermione, and Draco were all standing just outside the door, trying to be inconspicuous.
"Harry," said Mycroft, folding up his newspaper and coming up to the table, "Who's the man on my sofa?" he asked.
"Yeah," said Harry as he took off his glasses. He snapped them in half then raised his wand "oculus reparo." Once again, his wand glowed bright gold. The glasses immediately joined back up and were whole once more. Harry noticed that a lot of the chips and scratches had also been fixed, and the loose hinge was working as it should.
Somehow, even when the taxi had pulled up and the trunks were being unloaded, Hermione, Fred, and George were still asking questions.
The chauffeur opened the front door and they were led inside.
John looked slightly frightened by the goblins and kept his hand clasped firmly on Harry's shoulder. Sherlock was having the time of his life, examining every weak point and every way that the bank could be broken into. He studied every jewel and coin from afar, calculating the approximate wealth of wizardkind.
"They're the same plant. Can we please get on with the class?" Snape's scowl deepened,
"He's gone," he exclaimed.
Harry read it quickly, then re-read it, absorbing as much information as possible.
Mycroft realised arguing would be pointless, but that didn't stop him from trying.
"Just stuff. I managed to get him out of my head," said Harry. George looked at him oddly.
"Wait up!" called Draco. Harry only sped up, his need for answers blocking out everything else.
‘The Boy Who Lived Shall Die’ was burned into one of the walls, embers still glowing around the letters.
"They were deemed unfit to look after Harry Potter, you are not him, so you'll be able to stay with them no problem." Harry narrowed his eyes as a headache began, a burning behind his eyes.
"Vulnero."
A few minutes later the two boys were standing back on the street, their new robes wrapped up in paper. They ran around Diagon Alley, buying all their school stuff while avoiding Draco's parents.
Albus Dumbledore was now on his feet. He was smiling at each and every student, though Harry saw it become ever so slightly forced when looking at the Slytherin table. He had his arms open wide, welcoming everyone into his school.
"It has come to my attention that the two of you are avoiding something. It is something that even a blind man could see. I will be starting school next week, so you two will be spending a long time alone together. Might I recommend you put aside your pride and admit you have feelings for each other?" John opened his mouth to protest, but Harry kept on talking. "John, every single one of your girlfriends has been tall, slightly boring, and will almost always be wearing a dark overcoat, much like my father sitting next to you. I have made reservations at a restaurant somewhere, ask Mrs Hudson, and you are going to stop ignoring your feelings and confront them like the adults you are. Thank you." Harry stepped out of the room and went to read on his bed.
"What are you guys talking about?" asked Hermione. Harry explained the events of the previous night, getting more and more excited with each word.
Harry, Hermione, and Draco joined the first years crowding around Hagrid. There were around forty of them. Some looked at everything with wide eyes and slack jaws, some looked downright bored. Draco was among the latter.
"You're muggles! I can't just bring yer to Diagon Alley! And he's not your son, he's James and Lily's son." Hagrid's reply was a step too far for John and Sherlock. There was a small smile on John's face, and he laughed slightly.
“I knew it! Nicolas Flamel is the only known maker of the Philosopher’s Stone, but he’s also good friends with Professor Dumbledore.”
"You'll need these to keep the dragon away," he said, showing them how to use them and making a horrible sound.
“It’ll be fine, ‘Mione,” Draco assured her. Fred and George, both of whom had become close friends with the first-year trio, were beyond excited.
"You - Holmes- why didn't you tell him not to add the quills? Thought he'd make you look good if he got it wrong, did you?"
"Why was Aunty yelling?" He asked the man.
"HUFFLEPUFF!"
This time, when Dumbledore was locked up in a cell, McGonagall and Harry were there with him, their wands trained on him, waiting for the arrangements to be made that would hopefully put him in court. Others came to keep an eye on him, trusted teachers and government officials taking shifts, Harry having to be practically dragged away when his dads told him he had to go home.
*  *  *
"What can you tell us about the cases you've been on?" asked George excitedly as he and his brother sat down on the grass. Harry was more than happy to tell them about cases, it was far better than being asked about his dead parents.
For those who take but do not earn
A few long hours later, the potion was complete. Harry dropped the hair in. It dissolved immediately, a bluish smoke filling the air. Hermione grabbed a needle tied to a piece of string, dipping the needle in the potion before holding it over a map of London. It hung there for a moment before swinging around rapidly and tugging at the string. With a final tug, it left Hermione’s hand and planted itself firmly in the map book, right over Epsom. Sherlock took the pin out and flipped through the book, finding a map of only Epsom.
"It's so cool. Uncle Mycroft left heaps of games for my DS and there was a view of the stables and it was so massive." The three men smiled and sat down at the table. Dinner was served a few minutes later, a traditional English roast with about as much seasoning as you would expect. Harry would've preferred fish and chips, at least that would taste like something, even if it was ketchup, but he didn't complain about the lightly salted roast chicken.
Mrs Hudson, the landlady, was very nice to Harry, constantly giving him sweets and hugs. Harry found it a bit annoying, but put up with it. The toffee was worth it. Sherlock went to the Hospital alone that day, Mrs Hudson agreed to look after Harry on the condition that she would not become a nanny for him. Sherlock smiled, nodded, and left.
"There's nothing pulling the carriages, Harry. They're magic," the blond replied, looking down on Harry slightly.
"Bones, Susan!"
"Do you even get walks?" Harry asked, looking at it sadly. Unsurprisingly, the sleeping dog didn't reply. "You should be in the forest, eating unicorns or something." He sighed and sat up against the wall, turning his wand over. The national anthem was starting to get on his nerves.
A few long hours later, Draco, Harry, and Hermione were sitting under a tree beside the black lake, discussing their findings.
"You're Harry Potter, right?" asked the second. Harry sighed, wishing he could have some peace.
“So, what happened?” asked Harry. The client was shaking and stuttering, so Sherlock answered for her.
"Who is it?" It was the same gruff voice that had been yelling at the child.
He looked at the boy closely and did a quick deduction. Rich, proud, right-handed, and heavily influenced by his parents. Harry had a feeling there wasn't a single thought that went through his mind that someone else hadn't put there.
Ten minutes later, the nurses left, leaving Harry with a small meal, a drip, and a heart monitor beeping steadily. Sherlock was still sitting next to him, a slight look of worry on his usually emotionless face. Molly was just about to leave when Sherlock turned to her.
"Wingardium Leviosa." Harry's glasses flew into the air and collided with the ceiling, crumpling up and smashing. Then they dropped to the floor.
"Let's be off then," said Sherlock, grabbing one end of Harry's trunk. John rushes to grab the other end and the two of them carried it awkwardly down the stairs, Harry following with a fresh cup of coffee and Hedwig's cage under his arm. He finished it before he reached the bottom of the stairs and left it on a side table just outside Mrs Hudson's door.
John, struggling to put his coat on as the morning cold sent shivers down his spine, sighed as he sank down into his seat. Sherlock instructed the driver where to take them and they were whisked away to the residence of William Wheeler.
John groaned as the hansom started down the street. “I can’t wait to get back home—or Mycroft’s.” The correction brought on a tinge of pain that made John double over.
“Inspector Lestrade,” Mycroft appeared, flanking both his brother and Lestrade, “perhaps we should talk about this in your office?”
John sighed heavily as he helped Mary settle Madame Loire into a chair. “Holmes, I really think there’s a more plausible explanation for this.”
“It’s quite the pleasure to meet you in person, Dr. Moriarty. My father follows your work. It’s all quite fascinating.”
Moriarty smiled to himself as he watched the men work, satisfied that his plan was fully underway despite some minor hiccups.
“Miss?” The train employee huffed as he approached Sherlock, “everything all right?”
Sherlock stared at John, seemingly annoyed before cracking a slight smile. “Perhaps, Watson, perhaps.”
“You lost your pendant, right? That was the key considering the connection to Dr. Carberry. Lestrade thought it was circumstantial considering your close relationship with the deceased, but your outburst with Carberry coupled with the eyewitness reports from his staff made it a no brainer. I placed your pendant next to Carberry’s body after I killed him. It was easy to arrest you thereafter.”
Sherlock nodded as he walked briskly to the restroom. He closed the door behind him, looking around quickly before walking up to a sink. He opened his coat, carefully pulling out the items he had Wiggins acquire for him the night before.
“Sherly…” Mycroft stepped forward to take a hold of Sherlock’s arm as the latter was still trying to reach for John through the bars, “we should go.” He ended as softly as he was able given the situation.
And it had become clear, by the end of the man’s statement, that the joviality in the room had dissipated. Yet, Sherlock only nodded at the man at the end.
John groaned, but he let Sherlock hold him for a moment or so as he thought about everything except the case. He refused to answer which caused Sherlock to gently place both his hands on either side of his face, caressing him slowly.
Sherlock smiled again as he accepted the book. “Thank you.”
Both John and Sherlock glanced at each other. “How so?” John asked.
Sherlock thought to himself, hearing one of the voices say the name.
“His first stop was the British Museum…,” John began relaying the details of the case with another heavy sigh, “…a conservator found a strange poem on the back of a published print displaying an etching of the bust of Lord Nelson.”
Mamhud clinched his jaw as he sat up even straighter in his chair. “Well, after I heard the crashes…I saw Mr. Davenport come out of his room…then I heard Ms. Coventry…and I think I remember seeing Standish speaking with Ms. Coventry’s maid before retreating upstairs…but besides that, nothing else.”
John expressed his confusion as he looked as best as he could down the corridor see the guard sitting at the desk playing cards. He groaned with an eye roll as he faced Sherlock directly again, convinced that his companion had lost his mind.
“Yes,” Sherlock rose from the sofa to retrieve his smoking pipe at the fireplace mantel, “it’s all circumstantial.”
John shook his head. “We need to do
Sherlock took a moment before turning his head to look slightly at John. “Care for a stroll, dear?”
Sherlock groaned as he tried to push Gladstone away from him, but the dog was unexpectedly aggressive with his kisses. John laughed again as he helped Sherlock to his feet. Sherlock huffed as he straightened himself out before indicating Gladstone.
“Holmes, I don’t like this anymore than you do. I consider Dr. Watson to be a dear friend and it troubles me that he’s possibly capable of such lengths, but witnesses saw a man fitting Dr. Watson’s physical description leave the scene. I don’t know what else to tell you, Holmes. Those are the facts.”
“Size 10.” Sherlock retracted his tape measurer as he straightened up to stand next to John.
John sat back in his chair, sighing heavily from exhaustion and stress brought on by the entire ordeal that was only further fueled by memories of his argument with Carberry the night the latter died.
was the one causing delays, but I’m sure he’s told you something different.” Wheeler rolled his eyes.
John looked around the space before looking down at the cot; the carriage house looked like it hadn’t been used in years.
“Oh my god…” John interrupted suddenly. He leaned forward to place his head into his hands. Both Sherlock and Mycroft looked at one another as they waited for John.
Moriarty shook his head. “You’ve already captured my attention, Mr. Holmes.”
“We…found…him…like this…this morning, officer…” One of the voices explained, “this is such a tragedy…”
The event for Basil Whitehall was not until the next evening, but Moriarty planned to stay the night at the mansion to ensure that production was ready before the following evening.
“…as you can see, someone broke into the house this evening…poor Mr. Standish was a victim…”
“…I didn’t want Viktor to find out about the theatre closing down so I figure it was probably best to convince him that we didn’t know each other in front of everyone else. Standish would have surely said something if he knew that we were in a relationship…”
“I don’t know anyone named Schuller.”
After a few seconds, John opened the door to see Mycroft wearing his dinner jacket. The other man was smiling broadly, almost as if he were putting on an act of congeniality, but it felt insincere to John.
Some murmuring on the other side of the cell wall interrupted John’s attention; he could now hear Schuller talking loudly to himself, which wasn’t atypical, but the man sounded anxious. But before John could really dwell on it, he smelled smoke before seeing Sherlock running toward his cell, followed by a large cloud of smoke. John backed away from the bars as the mechanism in the door clicked.
“Carberry’s patients…he was giving some sort of a…concoction to the less fortunate…” John looked up to see Detective Baynes’s reaction, but he appeared unphased.
Sherlock stepped toward Mary and Mr. McArthur. “Why don’t we investigate what made the noise? I’m sure we’ll find that your father is correct, and it was most likely one of your family’s employees.”
Sherlock groaned as he sat back in the sofa. “Mycroft, we’ve been together for more than three years—almost four. You know that.”
“Well, I never turn down an opportunity to participate in scholarly discourse. So, please, I insist, uh, Mister…?
“Of course, Sherly…” Mycroft squinted his eyes again as if he were trying to decipher his brother’s demeanor, “I think that’s a wonderful idea as well.”
Clara nodded with a sigh.
Sherlock grunted an incomprehensible reply as he took his time rising from the sofa before walking over to Gladstone’s food bowl.
“Well,” William started, pointing defiantly at Fedorov, “don’t
“Beg pardon, dear?” Mycroft casually added as he walked back to the breakfast table.
Schuller squiggled around in the chair. “I don’t like being in closed, tight spaces.”
Sherlock shook his head as he reached out a hand to rub John’s leg. “Not entirely. You’re more useful than you think.” He ended with a kind smile.
Sherlock was now at the door. “We should try this address.” But John reached out to stop him from leaving.
Sherlock held up a finger to quiet John. “Listen, Watson.” He then pointed down the hall at two figures who were standing near the kitchen but were facing in such a way that they couldn’t see Sherlock and John spying on them.
Some minutes passed as John tried to reason with what was happening to him, trying to understand why the police thought he had something to do with the murder. As he tried to lose himself in his thoughts, John could hear loud rambling on the other side of the wall.
Sherlock motioned for him to continue.
And right on his fashionably late cue, the door leading into the cellar from Moriarty’s office opened wide, revealing the academic who was still wearing his teaching regalia.
are you on this train?” He repeated sternly.
“Holmes!” Lestrade shouted, his frustration seething, “I’m going to have to put you in a cell if you don’t remain calm!”
have anything to say?”
The employee shook his head. “One of my colleagues will take care of it.”
“Holmes,” Lestrade wedged himself in between the door and Sherlock, “you need to let the police handle this. The doctor’s innocence will come to light, I’m sure of it. Faked evidence won’t stand up in court.”
The man laughed heartily as he slapped Schuller’s shoulder again. “You’ll be fine.”
John raced past Sherlock, cutting him off in the middle of the hallway. “For god’s sake, Holmes. We’re on vacation. Something probably fell in the kitchen.”
The man laughed awkwardly as he waved his hands around. “Of course, we can handle the chemist! We’ll have the doses ready for the event.”
The woman reciprocated the expression. “Well, I’m not surprised…he seems awfully forgetful…and…” she looked behind herself before turning to face Sherlock and John, “and a little strange, if you ask me…”
“I suppose I should cancel my meeting with that associate of mine.” Mycroft sighed as he sat down in a chair near the fireplace.
They returned to their meal and chatted for a bit before John slapped a hand to his forehead, groaning loudly.
Sherlock groaned again as he walked into the bedroom, closing the door behind him. He sighed as he looked at the bed, dragging his feet to sit on the edge. He hadn’t slept all night; he knew he needed to do something quick before John’s case went before trial.
“Mr ‘olmes!” Wiggins started through several laughing fits, “you’ll get caught in that getup!”
“Wait…do you see it?”
John squinted his eyes; he was hoping Sherlock would be straight forward with him considering the situation, but something about the way his companion was acting was unnerving. John waited; he knew Sherlock would only elude him more on the subject although such maneuvering was becoming more frustrating as the minutes ticked away with this case.
Sherlock nodded. “Besides Turner…” He repeated as he limped toward their deduction board. Sherlock used his pipe to point to the British Museum.
“It’s a nice evening for a walk through a cemetery, isn’t it, Watson?” Sherlock was now in the vestibule near the front door. John looked back at James and Mary before sprinting to catch up with Sherlock.
Sherlock shook his head as he pointed to the inside of the woman’s compartment. The train employee looked at the compartment before looking back at Sherlock, squinting his eyes to indicate that he thought something was amiss about Sherlock’s disguise.
The men stopped wrestling with each other as John inched his way along the wall to find a spot to sit on a bench near the man sleeping on the cot.
Saxon stared back at Sherlock; his expression remained stoic.
“…I knew there was something unethical about it…I tried to stop it…,” John turned around to face Sherlock and Mycroft, “the last time I saw Carberry I was arguing with him about what he was working on…” John pointed to the vial, “that night I found out that he was testing his experiment on people in Whitechapel…”
“Surely, Mr. Holmes and Dr. Watson, the two of you
“Yes, I’m afraid you bumped your head, Mycroft.” John answered as he dragged him away from the row.
John grinned before he leaned downward to kiss Sherlock. “I love you…” He whispered.
You tell me, dear reader. However, I’m inclined to believe the latter.
John stared at the shear amount of items Sherlock had brought out with him to attach to their automobile.
With a contained laugh, Moriarty looked up at his men who were standing in the back before looking directly at Schuller again.
Sherlock stared at John before slapping his knee. “Something about it doesn’t seem clear…”
All the men halted to attention except one who leaned next to another, confused by Moriarty’s phraseology. The other man quickly explained what the professor meant which caused the other to halt at attention like the others.
John sat up as Sherlock continued to yank on his body, now pulling John up to the compartment window. “Hurry up, Watson!” Sherlock shouted as he shoved John out the window.
Not long after, Sherlock and John arrived at their destination. Sherlock walked up to the entrance of the house, motioning for John to follow before knocking on the door.
“Sure, let’s all quell Mary’s fears.” Mr. McArthur responded sarcastically which barely helped the situation.
John panicked internally as he watched his companion disappear down the stairs. Gladstone attempted to go after Sherlock, but John managed to take a hold of his collar before he also escaped. John kneeled down next to Gladstone in order to calm him and to get a better look at the men down by the furnaces. They were now talking about an event before complaining some more about Schuller.
Sherlock sat down in the sofa. “Why, Mycroft? I can manage alone.”
“Well, get on with it, Mr. Holmes.” He said in a huff as he plopped down in the chair.
“Last donation was received about three weeks ago and that was his first donation ever.”
Sherlock made a face, appeared taken aback by how willing John appeared considering everything that had happened including the night before.
John stared back Sherlock as if he didn’t understand what his companion was referring to. He took a moment before nodding back finally, rising slowly from the chair as he followed Sherlock out of the parlor, down the hallway, up the stairs, down another hallway until they reached the room Mycroft had Stanley lay out for them.
The shady figure waited a second before hopping onto the back of the train. Sherlock quickened his pace as he followed the figure from a safe distance, hopping on the back of the train out of sight of the platform station employees. Sherlock waited before following the figure further into the train, using the same window the individual had just pried open effortlessly.
Sherlock nodded as he beckoned Wiggins further inside toward his desk. “Wiggins, you’ve always been my most trusted informant…” he tore a page out of the book on the desk before grabbing one of the vials.
Mycroft scrunched up his face at his brother. “Sherlock, I’m telling you the truth. The only thing is…” He paused as he shuffled about, looking worried.
The man looked at the others behind him who had stopped what they were doing at the mentioning of Schuller. The man tried to ignore them before leading Moriarty from the space and through the narrow hallway. They walked for some time until they came upon a door. They could hear loud banging on the other side of the door which was accompanied by equally loud swearing.
Lestrade inched toward the detective as he lowered his voice. “The evidence you have is barely circumstantial, and you know it.”
my fault. I have to fix it.”
John grabbed Sherlock by the arm. “The thwarted terrorist plan?” He gasped.
Sherlock nodded before rising from his chair. He motioned for William to follow him to the exit. “Thank you for the suggestion. Will you send him in please?” He answered disingenuously which seemed to go right over William’s head.
John gawked at Sherlock, but then his expression changed as he reexamined the evidence. Besides everything else that had transpired, John did think there was something suspicious about someone targeting him especially. John had been considering for a while whether this mysterious person or persons had wanted Sherlock to be involved which would explain a great deal, but the motive wasn’t clear to him. He also didn’t feel comfortable mentioning something to Sherlock which might send his companion down another perilous rabbit hole.
Lestrade could see Sherlock eyeing him out of the corner of his eye. “Holmes, that’s all I can say for now because if I’m right…”
John watched Sherlock rearrange the clothes on the bed, and as he watched, something clicked.
John followed the smell through the hallway and down the stairs until he found the kitchen and Sherlock who was standing over a huge pot cooking on the stove.
“Mycroft.” Sherlock sharply commanded.
This new bit of information seemed to paralyze Sherlock the most as he stood still just staring back at Lestrade, reality sinking in that John could possibly be convicted for a murder he didn’t commit.
Sherlock groaned as he searched around the area, finding a window on the first floor that looked the easiest to pry open.
John nodded as he considered the idea before he frowned. “Holmes, if I remember correctly,
“Wiggins! Wiggins!” He shouted at a group of children huddled on the other side of the street. Wiggins turned around from his group at the sound of his name.
“Dr. Watson.”
“Henry must be in that smelting factory.” Sherlock said to John before running after Gladstone who had disappeared into the building.
John peered ahead to see that Sherlock had disappeared round the corner. He sighed to himself as he hustled along, rounding the corner to see Sherlock knocking on the door to one of the row houses. John hustled along until he met Sherlock at the door. They waited a moment before it opened, revealing an older looking woman.
“It’s Mary, Mycroft,” Mary answered quickly, “John’s friend?”
“Excuse me!” He shouted as he tried to straighten himself out before noticing that he had ran into a pretty woman wearing a scarf. He gathered himself, mustering up his usual façade that gave him access to anything he typically wanted.
Sherlock nodded as the woman stepped to the side to let them in. She pointed down the hallway in direction of Henry’s room. Sherlock and John walked down the hallway stopping at the door before the woman disappeared out of sight into her own room.
was the one who killed Dr. Carberry.”
“I guess influence and power knows no bounds, right, Doctor?” Mycroft grinned before going back to his food.
Mycroft turned around to sit down in a chair next to Sherlock. “I really do hope you know what you’re doing, Sherly.”
“…but please don’t get yourself into trouble, I don’t want the both of us behind bars…” John added quietly.
“I want to see what evidence Detective Baynes has managed to recover from the scene.” Sherlock demanded as he turned around to exit the office.
“Of course, right away.” Warden James nodded quickly as he turned to type a series of numbers into a keypad next to the door.
“You’re Conrad Coney, aren’t you? I read your column every single morning!” She added before Coney could walk past her.
Sherlock appeared in the room, watching John trying to relax.
Sherlock sighed loudly as he resettled. “Watson, please. You mustn’t take Mycroft seriously.”
John chuckled half-heartily as he took the moment to observe Sherlock reading his notes before returning to his own.
Moriarty had held up a hand to interrupt. “Just keep an eye on him. He’ll be fine once he sees the work he’s labored over come to life.”
John shook his head as he turned to face the board again. “Holmes, you know the routine. I have the mornings and you have the evenings.”
“I can accompany you both there, Mr. Holmes.” The director offered as kindly as possible.
John’s eyes went wide as he froze in the doorway. “Holmes! We can’t go back to the city. We’re on the run from the police. Remember?!” John knew Sherlock had a penchant for recklessness, even before getting caught up in the factory explosion, but this recent proposal went too far.
Standish laughed once more before slapping the shoulder of the man sitting next to him. “An admirer! Don’t have many of those nowadays.”
“Watson,” Sherlock turned slightly in his seat, “you have to trust me. I know what I’m doing. I couldn’t allow you to stay in Westgate because you won’t receive a fair trial.”
Sherlock nodded before holding out the inscribed knife with a handkerchief. “Does this look familiar?”
Mr. McArthur waved his son off as Mary stood up from her chair. “Mr. Holmes, those footprints cannot belong to James…” She looked back at her brother whose expression had change to indicate that he knew where she was headed next.
Mycroft nodded with a smile as Stanley entered the room with a telegram. Mycroft accepted the note, reading to himself before tossing it across the table in a huff.
“Well...,” John rubbed the back of his head as he thought about having dinner alone with Mycroft. He noted to himself that he hadn’t eaten anything substantial since the night Carberry died which made him feel even more hungry. But having dinner with Mycroft alone sounded unpleasant at best.
John sighed as he followed Sherlock but as they approached the house, they heard another hysterical scream, but this time it was a man’s voice. They ran quickly back inside the house to find that Mr. McArthur had fainted in the oval room and Mary was doing her best to make him comfortable.
Sherlock eyed his brother; he could tell that Mycroft was holding onto some key information but decided that it wasn’t worth it to get into a fight with his brother over his questionable methods even if whatever Mycroft was unwilling to disclose would help John. Sherlock knew he would find out eventually.
Sherlock hopped down onto the floor quietly, surveying the room before walking into the middle of the space. The room was filled with the usual instruments one would find in such an establishment but something in the corner of the room caught Sherlock’s attention.
Mycroft stopped in front of a room at the end of the hallway. “And finally, you’ll both have the pleasure in meeting Nigel Standish.” Mycroft concluded with the widest grin.
“After I realized that you two were gone—thank you again, by the way, Sherly, for not completely including me in your plans…”
The two searched around the cemetery before they found a small shack in a far corner. A man walked out of the shack as both Sherlock and Wiggins walked toward the structure. The man stopped to acknowledge Sherlock and Wiggins with a wave.
But all he could do, probably brought on by the confusion and timing of the escape, was nod as his weary body was finally freed from the miserable conditions at Westgate.
Something about the comment changed Whitehall’s expression again, but it didn’t deter Moriarty who remained still and serene.
Everyone murmured before Mr. McArthur turned toward James with a quizzical expression. “Son? Isn’t that the same sized shoe you wear?”
“Holmes!” John shouted once more as he ran toward his companion.
Sherlock refused to respond as he tried to eat the rest of his pastry. Mycroft sighed as he gazed back at his brother.
Fedorov returned soon after, announcing that the police were on their way. The guests went back to their rooms while Bridget stayed with Clara until the police arrived. Sherlock greeted them at the door.
Sherlock chuckled. “I haven’t forgotten, Watson.” He then walked ahead with Gladstone holding out one of Henry’s hats he had found back in his room.
Sherlock laughed as both John and Lestrade looked at each other with confused expressions. “Yes, that’s
Clara looked horrified. She nodded slowly as she let go of Bridget who looked as perplexed as everyone else in the room.
Sherlock begrudgingly accepted the plate. “Mycroft, I’ve told you this many times before, but no.” He ended sharply, frustrated with the events that morning and his brother’s annoying persistence.
Sherlock pointed ahead. “There’s a covering by the ground floor.” He whispered.
Coney nodded; by this stage in his career, he had become accustomed to his growing cluster of admirers, which were mostly women.
Clara nodded once more.
John thought to himself as he entered his compartment. He found his medical bag, but then also took a moment to retrieve his service revolver from overhead.
Bridget nodded once more before rising quickly from her seat. Sherlock turned to John as soon as they were left alone.
“Madame Loire!” Mary turned to quickly prop their maid up, waving a fan near her face again to give her some air.
Sherlock waited to respond as his expression remained the same. He then stuck out his hand for the professor to shake.
Sherlock reassured himself as he hung his head, thinking about his next plan.
John nodded as he listened.
“No one's taken your luggage?” Mr. McArthur questioned, frowning.
John wrestled with the man, trying to get into a better position to defend himself. He could hear Gladstone barking as he attacked the other man. John was concerned for Gladstone’s safety, but he was helpless as the man he was struggling with was stronger than expected. The man grabbed John by the collar before slugging him in the face once. John struggled against him before Gladstone appeared out of nowhere to pin the man to the ground.
Sherlock and John looked at one another. “Why would that be the case, Mr. Fedorov?” John asked.
Sherlock stopped at the corner of the street. “I keep a file on everyone I know for research purposes. Yours is the most extensive, of course.” He answered as if that wasn’t the strangest thing John had ever heard him say.
Every day he sent a letter to Draco. Even though they had only met once, they soon became good friends. Draco was the first proper friend had ever had, and Harry was the only friend Draco had that hadn't been chosen by his parents. Both of them were unbelievably excited to meet up and start school at the end of the month.
"If you are an example of the average wizard in your society, then it is not one that I wish my nephew to join," said Mycroft, his voice laden with hate. Hagrid hung his head in shame but did nothing to defend himself or other wizards.
There weren't many people left now. "Moon" ... "Nott" ... "Parkinson" ... then a pair of twin girls, "Patil" and "Patil" ... then "Perks, Sally-Anne" ... and then, at last – "Pot-Holmes, Harry!" Harry sighed when he heard his name. All this magic and they couldn't even get it right. A few mutters followed him as Harry walked up to the stool and put the hat on his head.
"Are there other banks for wizards?" asked Harry.
(Order of Merlin, First Class, Grand Sorc., Chf. Warlock,
Eventually, the boats stopped alongside a kind of underground harbour. Everyone clambered out onto the rocks, Neville tripping over the uneven ground. Harry and Draco helped him up before rushing back to join the group in front of a massive wooden door. Hagrid raised his fist and knocked on the door three times. It opened almost instantly and behind it stood Professor McGonnogal, as stern-looking as ever.
"I know. But I'm still gonna miss them."
“What are you doing?” asked Harry, raising his wand.
"Welcome, new students and their parents. Here at St Mary's Bryanston Primary School, we believe in hard work, integrity, courage, curiosity, and compassion." The lady droned on and on, Harry zoned out after doing a quick deduction. She was in her late thirties, with two, no three, young children and a golden retriever. She was having an affair with . . . Harry looked around the room . . . the deputy headmaster. Harry stifled a yawn and decided this would be the perfect time to work on his Mind Palace. At the moment it was just an unfurnished 221b, but that didn't have enough rooms, so he was redesigning it to better fit his purpose.
"Hi, Dad," said Harry as he entered the flat. "Who's the ex-army man?" The man looked shocked to see the small boy.
Thank you so much for reading! I can't believe it has 13 kudos! I wasn't expecting any :) It really means a lot!
"My father reckons he's off his rocker, but I think he's pretty okay. He's let a few too many mudbloods-" Harry looked at him, disappointed, "-sorry. He's pretty okay, but apparently very slack when it comes to rules," finished Draco, looking slightly guilty.
"Can I get you anything, Minerva?" asked the toothless barman, cleaning a glass with a cloth.
Deputy Headmistress
"You really should stop drinking that, Harry. It'll mess up your brain," he tutted.
He pushed open the door, feeling slightly nervous. A small witch approached him and smiled.
"Father has been doing it his whole life and he turned out fine," said Draco. Harry stifled a laugh, causing Draco to glare at him. "It's an easy way to practice Occulemency, the way you keep Legilimens out of your head." Harry stopped laughing at that.
Platform Nine and Three Quarters was filled with students in regular clothing and adults wearing multicoloured robes that swept along the brick floor. There were tears in eyes, some of sadness, some of joy. Students were hugging their parents goodbye and greeting their friends. The most amazing thing of all was the scarlet steam engine with Hogwarts Express emblazoned on the side.
“That search ended four hours later, when Sherlock texted me telling me that the wizard had been successfully detained and that it would be only a matter of time before the ministry of magic showed up to take away the wizard. Now, the reason it took so long for us to come home was because of the absurd amount of paperwork needed when a muggle refuses to be obliterated,” finished John, taking a sip of the tea that Sherlock had brought him while he had been speaking.
"How can you walk so fast?" he asked between gasps. Harry said nothing, just waited for his friend to catch his breath before continuing through the library and arriving at the correct isle. He looked through the books, reading each and every title before on caught his yee. The Art Of Occulmenecy. Harry picked it up and sat down.
"No more'n four to a boat!" yelled Hagrid. Draco, Harry, and Hermione climbed into one, Neville following right behind, still clutching tightly to his toad.
"When you were a baby, there was this super dark wizard. He was the Dark Lord," Harry sniggered slightly, but Draco ignored him. "He killed hundreds of people, mainly muggles, then decided that he wanted to kill you and your family. He came to your house in the middle of the night and killed your parents, but when he tried to kill you, it backfired and the spell hit him instead. You ended his reign of terror. That's why you're famous. You're super cool."
"Is there anything else you want to get before we go home?" asked Sherlock. Harry pulled out his list and scanned it, lingering on the last words.
"I don't see why we can't come," said John angrily. "He's our son."
*  *  *
“Who made you do it?” Harry knelt beside the wizard’s head, his voice calm, but anger etched on his every feature. Dumbledore said nothing, now looking afraid. “Who made you do it?!” asked Harry again, louder this time. Dumbledore flinched as Harry moved closer, but still didn’t answer. Harry jammed his knee into Dumbledore’s ribs.
"Ahem - just a few more words now we are all fed and watered. I have a few start-of-term notices to give you.
"Hello, Harry. This is John Watson. He might be staying with us soon." Harry nodded and turned to John.
Investigations continue into the break-in at Gringotts on 31 July, widely believed to be the work of dark wizards or witches unknown.
Teach us something please,
Harry soon forgot what he had been thinking as he arrived at the charms classroom, and the lesson began.
"But you said that the universe would never be so lazy," said Harry, remembering the argument Sherlock and Mycroft had so long ago.
The upstairs bedroom,
Dumbledore collapsed on the ground, clutching his side. Harry left the room without looking back.
"He's a bit odd, isn't he," said Draco. "Hogwarts really has gone to the dogs. Potatoes Harry?" Harry's jaw dropped. The empty gold platters that covered the table were now filled with food of every kind. There were roasts and Yorkshire puddings, and peas, carrots, chips, sausages, bacon, and, for some reason, mint humbugs. Harry piled his plate high, the massive amounts of food reminding him of Mycroft's home. The thought of his family made him slightly sad. He missed them already.
"Here's your post," she said as she threw a pile of envelopes onto the sofa. Harry thanked her and picked up the pile. He skipped through all the congratulatory letters from friends that couldn't make the wedding and all the bills. All that was left was a thick, yellow envelope that smelled faintly of lemon. The envelope was sealed with a wax insignia. A badger, an eagle, a snake, and a lion curled around an H. He flipped it over and in neat, green cursive, his name and address were written.
“We’re literally at the station already,” replied Harry. Just as the words left his mouth, the train slowed to a stop. Fred and George cheered and leapt onto the platform. The other three were quick to follow, dragging their trunks behind them. Hedwig was already at the flat, having flown there to drop off a letter and needing no reason to return, so her empty cage had been shrunk down and shoved inside Harry’s trunk.
"I was adopted out of the Dursley's so-called 'care' by my father, Sherlock Holmes," answered Harry.
John and Sherlock would basically sit outside of his door, waiting for the inevitable screams before running in to comfort their son. It only got worse when Dumbledore reminded Harry of Fawn and Voldemort. His dreams soon became warped nightmares of a red-eyed Vernon Dudley standing over him while Fawn stood laughing in the corner, though they somehow appeared concerned at the same time.
A few minutes later, Hermione came into the living room, joined moments later by Fred and George. Neither of the twins looked particularly well-rested, but they both looked quite happy.
“After class,” he replied through a yawn. Hermione nodded, though still looked worried. Harry knew they might start asking about the dreams, and the last thing he wanted was them to think he was some sort of… he couldn’t think of the word. Harry had an odd feeling that he would’ve known, if only something was… different? He couldn’t be sure.
The interior was unlike any bus Harry had seen before. Instead of a few dozen matching seats, firmly attached to the floor, there were dozens of mismatched chairs scattered around. A few of them had fallen over, a couple contained a witch or wizard, and several were lying on the floor next to their previous occupants. Harry decided against sitting and instead braced himself against the wall as the bus took off.
“What ingredients do you need for the tracking spell?” Harry asked Hermione.
He strolled into the dining room with a giant smile plastered on his face.
"That's where I heard it before," said Hermione. "I have to go." She sprinted off to the castle.
“If I keep this up, I’ll look like you by the time Christmas is over,” he said in disdain.
What was once held in vault 713 is an object of unmatched importance, but I could not tell you what it is, even if I knew. I hope you tread carefully, young Holmes.
The first-years lined up behind her and she walked out of the small chamber, back into the hall and through a pair of double doors, into the Great Hall.
The castle appeared larger and larger with each passing second. Harry felt so small compared to the towering school atop the sheer cliff.
“It could be anyone. Think of all the power that would come with immortality,” said Draco.
"Uncle said it was because I cried too much." Sherlock scowled. He hated that man even more. He hoped that he would be imprisoned for the rest of his life, but he knew it was unlikely, as Harry wasn't a justifiable witness.
"That is so cool," said Draco, looking at his own wand in dismay.
"What are they?" asked Harry.
"Well, that may be so, but it doesn't excuse the scientific impossibility of magic," replied Sherlock.
Lestrade was exceptionally surprised to see Sherlock Holmes walking out of the house with the child held in his arms.
"Nah," said George, who was completely fine.
"Uh, yeah. It's a remembrall. It goes red when you've forgotten something, which I think you might've." Harry looked down at the small ball and saw that it was scarlet.
"My dear Frair, haven't we given Peeves all the chances he deserves? He gives us all a bad name you know, and he's not even really a ghost - I say what are you all doing here?"
“Y’know, a few months ago I would’ve wanted this less than anything, and now I want nothing more,” said Draco, smiling slightly tearfully. Harry briefly wondered how bad his parents were, but decided not to ask.
A while later, it was declared that breakfast was over and that all students should begin making their way to class. Draco and Harry said goodbye to Hermione and began walking towards their first class.
And unafraid of toil;
"Of course," Sherlock replied. Harry beamed and hugged Sherlock again.
*  *  *
“Well, get used to that feeling, because we’re gonna be here for a long time,” said Harry, wrapping an arm around his friend.
Students may also bring, if they desire, an owl, a cat, or a toad.
Those patient Hufflepuffs are true
He had met her a few years ago while working on a case. After discovering that her husband was a drug lord and a crime boss, Sherlock had worked with Mrs Hudson to assure that the correct punishment was given. It had been quite easy to give him the death penalty with the extensive evidence that they provided. Since then, the woman had owed him a favour, and it seemed the right time to come collecting.
Harry looked down at his empty gold plate, feeling surprisingly hungry. The pumpkin pasties must have been ages ago.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Sorry," he said, "but have you seen a toad at all?" When they shook their heads, he wailed, "I've lost him! He keeps getting away from me!"
"Why did they want me to be Harry Potter?" asked Harry.
"Are there any super important wizard artefacts that could be hidden here?" Harry asked Draco.
"No," he replied, "I'm Harry Holmes. Why is this so hard for people to understand?"
The second they arrived, school began, and Harry almost forgot he was in a magical place. Though the term had only just begun, teachers gave out more work than Harry had ever had to do in his whole life. He had never had a formal class before, and decided a few minutes after the first one started that he was pretty glad he had been homeschooled.
"I had way too much to drink last night," said John. Sherlock nodded in agreement. They both stood up, struggling to keep their balance as the hangover set in.
Harry was so engrossed in his work, he didn't notice that the assembly had ended until all the kids around him began to stand up. He quickly followed suit. The parents were told to go home and to pick up the kids at three or twelve depending on whether they were doing a full day or a half-day. Harry saw that all the other kids were being led out of the hall and made a quick decision. He sprinted through the crowd of adults and ran into John and Sherlock.
"Fred and George Weasley," said the second, pointing to himself and his brother before holding out a hand.
Harry spent hours looking at all the different fish. Each one had him entranced. He read all the information plaques and asked all the employees dozens of questions. They all answered him, most of them shocked at his intellect. Sherlock had taught him well, he was way smarter than the average three-year-old.
"Screw this," he whispered, grabbing his glasses and a robe. He pulled it on over his pyjamas and slipped into his sneakers. Then he stood up and walked out of the dormitory. The common room was pitch black, the fire having burnt itself out hours before.
“What my dads don’t know can’t hurt them,” replied Harry. Fred and George smiled.
"Hope to see you in Hufflepuff," said the Frair. "My old house you know."
"I missed you, Draco," said Harry, letting go of the blond.
At the end of the street was a massive white building that dwarfed all the shops around it. There were large marble columns holding up an archway.
“To dissaperate, or teleport basically, you turn on the spot. It explains why the body has no external injuries, and why he wrote about the Boy Who Lived,” answered Harry, recalling a book he had read at the beginning of the year. John didn’t look any less confused.
A few days later was Harry's first Defence Against the Dark Arts class. This was one he had really been looking forward too, one that disappointed him immeasurably. Instead of learning defensive spells and interesting things about dark magic, the lesson was spent talking about small things that taught the class nothing. The teacher himself was a joke.
"Why do we have to move?" asked Harry.
“You would too if you’d stayed up all night,” said Harry, wishing he’d slept.
“Do you guys wanna come?” he asked his friends. Everyone was quick to say yes and they all followed John down the stairs and back on to the street.
You'll make your real friends,
Thirty minutes later, Harry was playing pokemon on his DS, John was reading the news, and Sherlock was pacing up and down the hotel room.
“Yup,” said Fred.
"Sorry," they said in an odd accent as they continued walking. Harry said nothing and forgot all about them as he stepped into the owl shop.
“We’re going to meet Sherlock Holmes,” they kept on telling each other.
“I was just gonna tell you your Dad won’t stop mailing me.” Malfoy turned and stormed out of the hall. Who was this guy pretending to be Harry’s dad? Was it Sherlock? Harry thought about it, trying to place Sherlock in his mind.
Harry and Draco sat down at the empty end of the Slytherin table, perfectly happy to only talk to one another. Harry looked at the coffee-free table in front of him in dismay. Already he was feeling tired. He pushed the thoughts of caffeine aside and instead looked over at the Ravenclaw table. Hermione was sitting alone and not looking overly happy about it. Harry waved at her. She came over immediately and sat opposite Draco and Harry. A few Slytherins glared at the new addition to the table, and Draco looked slightly uncomfortable, but Harry immediately struck up a conversation. All three of them grabbed some breakfast and began to talk.
“What do you mean by that, exactly?” John asked.
Yours sincerely,
“But how does it work?” asked Draco for the hundredth time while they were watching Horrible Histories.
"Anything from the trolley dears?" she asked in a sweet voice. Harry thought for a moment before nodding and grabbing a handful of each and depositing a large number of galleons in the lady's outstretched hand.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Of course, I had no idea where they went, so I called Mycroft immediately before checking the aurors in case they were injured. Both of them were fine, so I had no issue leaving them as I began my search for Sherlock.
"At least a hundred. These people really want to talk to you, Harry." Sherlock's phone started ringing. He put down the letters and picked it up.
By the time the front door opened, the sun had risen and Harry was shaking. John and Sherlock both apologised for taking so long, promising to tell their son what had happened once they had slept. Harry agreed and waited on the sofa, too jittery to sleep, but too tired to do anything.
“You know what, Harry?” asked John.
"I do a lot of reading." Harry began to explain everything he'd learnt about the fundamentals of magic, sparking a discussion with the girl, whose name he learned was Hermione that lasted for hours, eventually switching to a debate about the houses at Hogwarts. They kept on talking for a long time, Draco mentioning things occasionally. After a while, Hermione figured out that Harry was the son of Sherlock Holmes, and the rest of the train ride was Harry telling her and Draco all about his life.

A while later, Sherlock and Professor McGonagall came out of the bar and found him reading one of the books Harry had bought. There was a smattering of blood on Sherlock's shirt.
"Brother dear, tell me, what can you tell me about Harry Potter?
"What else do you need to buy?" he asked.
"They used to be. They once controlled the ministry, then they died out, or so we thought. Their fortune is yours now, Harry," said Griphook. Then the goblin whistled and a small cart came along the tracks in the ground.
"Yeah. It's called Legilimency. But it isn't supposed to hurt unless the Legilimen wants it to." Draco looked at his friend worriedly. "You don't think Dumbledore is using Legilimency, do you? Because I'm pretty sure it's illegal. If I tell my father, he'll put a stop to it immediately." With those words, all emotion dropped from Draco's face as he put on his Malfoy mask.
Or yet in wise old Ravenclaw,
“Sorry about the mess,” he said, stepping around a vase that had been shattered sometime during the day. The client muttered something under her breath.

there's too much i have to do, and i don't have the time or energy to really do anything with this anymore
"I'm going to have a chat with the Prime Minister," said Mycroft, taking his phone out and walking away.
Sorry this one's kinda short, and that it took so long (I feel like I say that a lot).
The second they left the cave, everyone put down their clankers and Harry heard the clinking of chains as the dragon slid back to the floor of the cave.
"I guess I should go," he said, getting up and leaving. The second he closed the door behind him and whispered "Finite Incantatum." he heard the dog wake up and start scratching at the door. Harry walked back down to his dormitory, not bumping into a single teacher.
All comments are awesome.
“We missed you too,” said John as they let go. “Who’re your friends?” Harry quickly introduced each of them. Fred and George stared at Sherlock in awe.
John looked astonished. An army wage did not get you to the Ritz. They sat in silence for a few minutes. It gradually grew more awkward until Harry burst through the door and dove onto the floor. He picked up the remote and turned on the TV, flicking through channels until he was on CBBC. Horrible Histories was on, the one show that Harry could never miss. John and Sherlock laughed and the tension resolved itself. Everyone in the family loved the show, even Sherlock. It was the only history that he knew. Harry was constantly making references and talking about it, so it was worth it.
"Well, I am not your uncle," said Sherlock as he slowly approached Harry. The boy flinched again, then relaxed as Sherlock wrapped his arms around him and pulled him into a hug. Harry hugged back and sighed.
Lestrade prevented himself from rolling his eyes; anything coming out of the detective’s mouth always sounded incredibly disingenuous, especially of late.
Moriarty grinned slightly. “The censure is only a ruse. They’re terrified of what you mean for the country.”
Both guards awkwardly glanced at each other before looking at the director who let out a strained cough. Mycroft looked at everyone around the group before clapping his hands together.
“I’ll distract the police and you take Gladstone.” She said before closing the door to face Sherlock and John again.
“And where are we going?” John inquired as he nearly toppled over from the force of Sherlock shoving him inside the hansom.
Sherlock laughed. “Indeed. I know it’s a secret, but the society has origins in England, am I correct?”
Sherlock poured John and himself a cup of tea. “We’re going there tonight.”
Sherlock looked down at the bag to see that the initials on the back of the pendant did indeed match John’s initials.
Sherlock turned to walk toward the door, but the turn caused him to groan in excruciating pain. John moved to help him, but Sherlock waved him off.
John turned his head slightly as he took his time regaining his composure, nodding back. His eyes had finally adjusted to the dark, but he could only marginally see Sherlock’s facial expression; Sherlock looked relaxed yet determined. John’s jaw hardened as he looked downward at the ground, telling himself that they were close to figuring out the case and that he needed to remain as calm as possible.
Detective Baynes looked up as the telegram landed on his desk.
“Watson!” Sherlock shouted, “quick!”
Lestrade’s glances went back and forth between the smoldering house and Detective Baynes who was directing officers around the premises. Lestrade continued to observe the detective’s mannerisms before he told himself that he needed to keep a low profile.
“It’s funny that all of London is after my dear brother but I still get invited to important events.” Mycroft pointed to the telegram that had landed not too far away from John’s plate.
“Standish deserved a lot more than a knife to the stomach, if you asked me.” Fedorov interrupted.
“This is it, Holmes. This is it for us. We’re either going to be hanged or forced to live out the rest of our lives in Mycroft’s estate.” John’s own comment made him shudder; he wasn’t sure which one was the worse out of the two options which made him cringe even more.
Sherlock laughed as he motioned for John to pick up their luggage as he descended the hansom to greet Mr. McArthur.
William rolled his eyes. “I was in my room. Nearly had a heart attack at the sound of those dishes and statue clattering around. I ran out into the hallway before I heard Ms. Coventry shrieking like a ghoul. I also saw Mr. ‘Han ben Mezid’ run out of his room.” He finished, severely mispronouncing Mamhud’s name.
