If you had asked Dean Winchester what being in love felt like, before he had met his angel, chances are he would have told you he didn’t really know. Dean knew what Love could feel like, because he loved his little brother Sam, and he would do anything and everything for Sam. So Dean might have said that Love was doing anything for someone. Dean just hadn’t really experienced love. Dean had thought he loved Cassie, and maybe he had at least a little, but after he met his angel, Castiel. Dean realized how naïve he really was because being in love was so much more complicated than just doing anything for someone.
Cas made a grumpy humming noise but didn’t move, content to let Dean hold him like this and just watched his coffee brewing. Cas was always extremely grumpy in the mornings and barely tolerated anything before his coffee. Dean pulled himself closer to Cas and nuzzled into his shoulder, they had another lazy Sunday.
Cas closed his eyes tightly and nodded idly, his head was spinning and he felt sick to his stomach, had gotten himself so worked up he was making himself sick. He desperately wished he could just curl up in bed with Dean.
Dean swallowed around the lump in his throat and reached his free hand up and cupped Cas’ cheek, the angel reacted instantly opening his eyes. Dean pulled Cas down and their lips met, finally, Cas started to move, slowly thrusting in and out.
It barely took 2 minutes for the door to open with Dean on the other side holding his gun, because rarely did anyone knock on their door. When he saw Cas his eyes widened with relief and he put on the safety before putting his gun away and hugging Cas so tightly, if Cas had been human he probably wouldn't have been able to breathe, obviously oblivious to Gabriel's presence. "Fuck Cas! Where the hell have you been, it has been 3 damn days!"
Cas wants a new suit, and after getting a tear in his trench coat, instead of letting the angel repair it with his grace, Dean suggests finding a new one, so they go to the mall.
Dean nodded a bit, something easing in his chest that Sam wasn’t disgusted by him as their father had been. “Yeah yeah, Shut up Bitch,”
Dan smiled warmly as he carefully handed Cas the flowers, “The blue ones are called Forget-me-Not’s so you don’t ever forget me. And these white ones are supposed to symbolize love, and passion, and the lady at the booth said they are supposed to be an aphrodisiac.”
Dean shook his head a little, sometimes he forgot how formerly unhuman his boyfriend was, “It’s pain meds. We need to get ready to leave and getting to the car isn’t going to be overly comfortable.”
Castiel had no real modesty, probably the whole angel thing, and just stripped down and pulled the more comfortable clothes on. The pants were a little too long and the shirt hung off of him more than it would have on Dean, but Dean was a little shocked because he thought he had liked seeing Cas in a suit but Holy fuck if he didn’t look like a fucking sex-god wearing jeans and his shirt. Dean forced himself to swallow before going with Cas into the kitchen.
Dean finds his old sketchbook from high school, filled exclusively with drawings of Mary. Dean asks to draw Cas and then pushes to see his angel's wings.
Dean looked over at Cas who was smiling gently, trying to give his hunter a win obviously and after a quiet moment, he laughed lightly. Dean climbed into Cas’ lap straddling his thighs and kissing him slowly, “I love you, Angel,”
Dean kissed him again before moving to get his pants on and going to the kitchen. Cas hesitated before following Dean, he wondered if he should tell Dean about his previous relationship with Balthazar, they had been a couple when they were fighting together. Cas had lied to Dean about him having been a virgin completely, but mostly because he had been ashamed of Balthazar at the time, they hadn’t ended well, to be fair it wasn’t Cas’ fault but Balthazar’s. Now though Castiel regretted having killed Balthazar, the memory was still too painful and he shook the thought away quickly. Cas then followed Dean to the kitchen deciding against telling him about Balthazar right now. When Cas saw Sam in the Library he decided to go into the library to talk to Sam. After entering the gently cleared his throat to gain Sam’s attention, “Hello Sam,”
Gabe sighed in annoyance and rolled his eyes, “Oh come on you guys it has been two weeks. I killed myself for you guys! I didn’t have to sacrifice myself to Luci to give you guys a chance to run.”
Dean looked over at the former angel, this time looking at him, he looked so broken, the way he had for the past few weeks since losing his powers and having moved into the bunker, Dean took a deep breath because emotional crap wasn’t exactly his strong suit, “Cas… you haven’t been talking to me about much of anything except for hunting… are you okay?”
Gabriel was tired of being ignored and cleared his throat, "That was my fault, sorry Dean-O, making Fantasy stuff can alter time a little."
Dean pulled Cas in for a long, passionate kiss before pulling away and going to his room with the duffel bag. Dean put his things away, then went to the bathroom and took a quick but nicely warm shower and getting dressed. When he ventured out towards the library, he could smell the burgers and his mouth watered, he could also smell something sweet but wasn’t sure what it was. When he got into the Library, the lights were now turned down lower, and candles were sitting on the table. Cas was slightly leaning against one of the chairs in jeans and one of Dean’s t-shirts that Cas had taken because the texture of the fabric was soothing.
Castiel needed to focus on something else and their joined hands seemed to be where his eyes wanted to fall as he chewed his lip, after a quiet moment he replied, “I thought maybe… I wasn’t sure if you remembered. Or… or if you still... I messed up so much Dean…”
Cas sighed gently but nodded and gently handed Dean his present, and the paper. “Thank you, Honeybee,”
Cas huffed in annoyance before getting up and grabbing his trench-coat, “I will return in a moment.”
Dean made a soft whining noise at being flown back to the bunker, the flight had always made his stomach queasy but it seemed worse this time. Dean clung to Cas’ hand desperately and curled towards Cas needily, “Cas… please…”
Cas gasped at the sudden change of passion and closed his eyes, he could hear Dean’s desires in his ears, radiating through his grace like Dean was praying, begging for him. Cas panted some and pulled away, meeting Dean’s eyes, “Are you sure?”
Cas could see the clarity fading in Dean’s beautiful green eyes and he could feel the clarity fading from himself. Technically Dean wasn’t putting out the usual pheromones an angel in heat would be, the spell was tricking Castiel to think Dean was. This was making Castiel feel as much need for Dean, as Dean was feeling for Cas. Cas barely had to nudge Dean’s thigh to get the man to spread his legs as wide as he could without it being painful, and even then Cas was sure it had to be slightly painful. Cas used his grace to make the lube appear in his hands, even though Cas was mostly lost to his instincts, he also knew very well that while Dean was acting like an angel in heat he would not be producing slick that would ease his discomfort in fucking him without preparation.
Gabriel pouted and tried to run off, but Cas caught him quickly, and they washed the two toddlers. Cas had much less luck with Gabriel then Dean had with Sam, so after Sam is finished, Dean helps Cas with Gabriel. They made a quick trip to the goodwill, and now the two very tired toddlers were cuddled together on Sam’s bed, positioned so they could watch cartoons. Dean tucked the blanket gently around the half-sleeping pair, and kisses Sam on the forehead, and started to go to his bed before Sam whined tiredly and whimpered, “Bean… you gotta sing da song…”
Dean pulled away and searched Castiel’s eyes, their mouths still only centimeters apart as they both puffed gently to catch their breath. “I love you…”
Dean carefully took Cas’ hand making the fallen angel look at him again, Dean smiled at him before gently leaning forward and pressing his lips to Castiel's. Cas sighed contently and leaned into Dean more, trying to follow the hunter’s lips as he pulled them away. Dean gave Cas such a warm smile that it made something in his chest ache because Cas could only imagine if could see Dean’s soul right now how brightly it would be shining. “I told you that night, that I loved you to Cas. Do you think that just because all this crap happened it would change how I felt?”
“I’m not saying anything for sure,” said Dean. “Maybe he really did die in a car accident. But I can’t say I like the timing of it all.”
“Hey!” Dean closed the small remaining distance, reaching down desperately to pull Young Dean back to the surface. The water soaking his clothes made him heavy, as did the burden of the sword. Dean wrapped both arms around him, pulling him upright. Young Dean clutched the sword tight to his chest, spluttered water, and shivered. He needed all of Dean’s help in staggering out of the waves again, back to the sand with Sam and Cas.
“You kidding me? You did great,” said Dean. Without the windshield wipers going, rain streaked down the front window of the car, blurring their surroundings on all sides.
“They can get stuck in a Dean-loop,” Cas said. “Usually it’s an argument, but shared interests do it too. Someone usually has to intervene.”
“There’s nothing to sense,” said Young Dean. “The Dark Watchers are absence. Angels have not even known what they have not known. That’s their words, again.”
“I’m not about to start questioning it,” said Dean. “I just need it to hold out a little longer. Till we get him back again.”
» I think the most fun for me as a former Vancity resident is setting this story in places that are definitively not Vancouver. please when you envision Big Sur, don’t simply picture a random shooting location just off the Sea-to-Sky highway.
“Dad sent me away again for a bit after that,” said Dean. “Sam never knew about it. And the worst part is, I’m pissed about it now, telling you, but back then? I told myself Dad was just doing what he needed to. Did it to look after me, to set me right. He said things… He said things that still echo through my head, that I still hear in his voice if I even think about…” Dean shook his head, took a deep drink from his beer.
“No, I moved here about a year ago,” she said. She took the pages from the printer, glancing at them as she handed them over. “There are a couple of staff who might still be around. Joanne Speers, she’s been here almost thirty years. And I think Scott used to be a student here. Scott Kinbote, he’s the guidance counsellor.”
Cas heaved another sigh, gaze turning skyward, blue eyes catching the light and turning clearer. “I go on,” he said. “And on and on.”
It proved the lie that formed the basis of everything his father had made him believe. That a man was stronger on his own. That relationships were weak spots. That a good hunter knew better than to trust anybody. He hadn’t known it at the time and wouldn’t figure it out again for years, but that stubborn mindset of cynicism and privation was no way to live.
“They gave me a library card,” said Dean, fishing the blue paper out of his pocket to show Sam the proof. “You can take out some books and bring them back to the motel, if you want.”
When Sam was gone, Dean and Cas relaxed with one more beer, drinking slowly so as not to outpace Young Dean’s winning streak as he played and drank and took in money. But they were pushing another hour, glasses long empty, when Dean noticed the shift. He only knew because it was him, and there was a fine line to it: good-spirited banter became too barbed, the bump of a hip against the table was no longer an exaggerated bit of theatre, his gaze looked focused, but it was at the expense of other senses. He wasn’t faking drunk anymore. He’d had too many and his game was getting sloppy. Even with his natural skill to back him up, he was going to do something dumb or reckless and lose all his money if got into another game.
“First off, I’m going anywhere you go,” said Cas. “And we’re going back to our world, to Jack and Sam and all our family and friends.”
In this case, a demon who fought like a wild thing, and, when he had the window for it, barely even felt the dig of his machete into her belly.
And here he was now, in Heaven, thinking about how he’d rather be doing all of this on Earth where his actions changed things. Where his existence had impacts, for his own future and for the world, for better or worse. Dean accepted it when he had to die, but now he wished there were no afterlife at all. No Hell or Heaven or Empty. No memories, no consciousness, no spirit to haunt a house or a flask or an old favourite ring. No eternity. Nothing but worms to eat his rotting body, and flowers to grow out of his grave.
He gave them till the food was ready. He brought it down with him to Young Dean and Past-Cas, talking himself into sitting down and actually noticing that it was kind of nice, really. He had to take off his outer shirt, getting too warm for layers. It might be in the high seventies now, with the warm devil winds still blowing. Maybe that was part of what made him uneasy about leaving Young Dean and Past-Cas alone. These winds made people do strange things.
“Walking wounded,” said Dean. “Which was more than we could say for this guy. Just get us out and—” He cut off. High above their heads, the barn ceiling reflected back a brilliant white light. It cast the beams into sharp, shadowed relief, then left darkness in its wake.
“Well, you asked,” said Dean, shifting stiffly in the creaky chair. The pamphlets taunted the corner of his vision: here the words ‘moral decline,’ there the phrase ‘predatory addiction.’ It was like a mosquito buzzing in his ear that he couldn’t swat away. The last fucking thing he needed to see while lying through his teeth about finding the Lord.
Cas paired his angled head with an unimpressed look. Dean returned it with his patented I’m-adorable expression and a helpless shrug, taking a drink from his coffee.
Sam leaned back easily against the fence rail. Wind blew off the water to rustle the dune grass, to pull at the plaid fabric of Sam’s shirt. He didn’t respond to Dean’s comment. He had that thoughtful look, that creased brow, which meant he was thinking too hard about something. About to say something that Dean already knew he would want to dodge. Dean knew his younger brother well, and knew it was already too late to avoid.
Cas looked up at Dean, then placed his hand flat against the grid covering the cell. His skin instantly burned and blistered, red hot. He pulled his hand away again and his skin healed itself. “It’s protected against angels, Dean,” he said. “If I could break through, I already would’ve.”
“Can you give me any tips on what I should do, when I get there? How not to suck? How to help people?”
Dean kept his focus on Waylon like that line wasn’t a giveaway as to just how much Waylon knew. He felt Jack’s gaze sweep to him, then back to Waylon.
“I told you, he’s out somehow. Whatever Jack did must’ve worked. So you can stow your ‘phantom limb’ bullshit and—”
“And let him look after you, too,” said Young Dean. Cas tipped his head curiously, eyes searching to understand. “He wants to,” said Young Dean. He tapped his temple. “I’d know.”
“Weren’t you listening?” said the Fisher King, squirming beneath Young Dean, trying to buck him but too weak. “Some stories are only that. Tales to amuse princes and ladies of the court. Look at me, child. If I had the Grail, I would be the ruler of all men. Not the overseer of a wasteland.”
“You won’t die,” said Cas. “You have to deliver the killing stroke, but the rest of us will be looking after you. You’ll come back here. Even if we got it wrong and getting the griffin egg doesn’t work.”
“So he’s working away on this project, he calls it ‘The Compendium of the Angelic,’ but I thought most of it was just armchair anthropology. Until… In 1984, he has this
“I’ll stay here as long as either of us can,” said Dean. “I’d stay here forever with you, if I could.”
“He has taken an unauthorized excursion to the future,” said the angel on the left. “He smells… He smells of another world.”
The truth was that none of them really knew how to fight it. It swept out with its wings, knocking Sam low. You couldn’t take your eyes off its black talons, which scrabbled forward fiercely. Every time it opened its beak the horrible sound of its shriek made Young Dean’s heart seize. And there was the fact that of the four of them, only Young Dean’s blows would be of any use, and he couldn’t even get near enough.
“I still think those references to innocence and pure-heartedness were editorial,” said Sam, clearly carrying on an argument from before Cas even whisked Young Dean out of 1998.
Cas didn’t wear the trench coat today. Or the dress shirt or slacks. No, these clothes almost looked like they could be Dean’s. They followed Dean’s layering rules, at least, but the colours were all Cas. A tan Western shirt with blue stitching left open over a soft purple t-shirt. A pair of dark jeans, with his t-shirt caught just above the brown leather belt.
The hag unstoppered the bottle and sniffed. A smile spread wide across her gummy mouth. She lifted her gleaming eyes to Young Dean and waved him forward, offering out the bottle.
“It’s different,” said Dean. “He’s died and been remade so many times. Jimmy’s soul is in Heaven, has been for years. I think… this is just how Cas kinda looks now.”
It was nearly noon before they got Young Dean out of bed. Rain drummed steadily against the living room’s tall windowpanes, the sky outside remaining gloomy grey. The wind sighed around the old house, and rain brought out the scent of the sea.
“Dean,” said Cas. He looked again at the graffitied entranceway. “Dean,” he said again, like he could speak to the man inside the compound. He sighed and looked at Young Dean once more. “I think if you remembered the future, you could become a very different man. I see the changes. I see the potential for openness and self-honesty that could alter you and everyone around you. But I also see obsession. Perhaps if you returned to your time and remembered all this, you would become like your father: single-mindedly pursuing a goal at the expense of every other relationship and opportunity. When you called us from your own time, I saw it then. I should have known you would do anything to get here.”
It was only through another dirty move that Young Dean got the chance to grapple, attempting to get Dean to the ground. Dean threw him off too quickly again. He was a little stronger than Young Dean, sure, but they were the same weight class and Young Dean was getting pissed. This was supposed to be an easy fight: Youth versus Experience. He was angry, though, and he could use that. Anger was an old habit, rising readily under his skin as he lunged forward again, careless now of whether he got hurt. It would be worth it to win.
“Alright,” said Young Dean, backing down like the fight bored him more than anything. “So, what else we got? Never had a bar mitzvah or rumspringa or debutante ball.”
It had been a long time since Dean debriefed Sam on a hunt like that, excited about something new, excited in his own sense of accomplishment. Sam put on a faint smile, bittersweet. Hunting was their life and always had been, and some hunts were awful and some were invigorating, but lately the stakes had been so high there wasn’t time to feel good about what went right. Young Dean didn’t know that yet.
“I heard the emergency whistles,” said Cas, alighting on the ground next to Dean. “I came straight here.”
Dean spit out his beer inelegantly, losing most of it down his chin. He dragged the heel of his hand against his chin, pinched his nose because some of it had gone up wrong and burned, then dragged his thumb against one watery eye. “Okay,” he said. “Okay, you really had me going. Joke’s up. You’re good, though. Kept a straight face, and the trick with the, uh—” He pointed at the device with his picture in it. “Don’t know how you did that part. But I know bullshit.”
Amara turned, keeping her eyes on Dean, pacing around the sigil slowly. Her black dress swept around her feet.
Cas looked agitated, but he ultimately didn’t resist the request. It was only a partial win. Neither would he meet Dean’s eyes when he spoke, still all too prepared to leave. “Speak what it is you would like,” said Cas. “But know that an angel is not like a fairy-tale genie. I am not here to grant three wishes.”
“What the hell?” He looked at Cas, who echoed his puzzled expression back down at the phone. “What is this? Did you make it back to the future?”
“Be not afraid,” Past-Cas said with grave authority. “We’ve arrived to assist with the deputation. What are our orders?” He looked at Cas.
“There’s more than that,” said Eliza. “There’s something I learned, as I searched for a way to build my own vessel. Your world may be different, but there is no God here.”
“No,” said Cas with a sigh. “You’ve been very helpful to Dean. We can take one trip. Come on.” He stood, gestured for them to join him, then in a flash had disappeared.
“It’s okay,” said Young Dean. “I liked it in the future, but it’s not like I would’ve tried to stay long here anyway. I had to go back to Sammy.”
He made his bed with military corners, even though no one would come up here to check. He lay down in the moonlight, listening to the wind in the trees, arm stretched up above his head, and couldn’t find sleep.
“Alright,” said Dean. “That’s alright Sammy. We’re just gonna hold tight here, out of the way. Okay?”
By noon they were driving through the stop-and-go streets of Carmel-by-the-Sea, tracking down the address Jodi gave them. Dean pulled over and parked, squinting ahead at another charming, whimsical house in a town full of charming and whimsical houses. “Guess that’s the place,” he said.
He unlocked the door of the motel, quiet as possible. Sam woke up, too well-trained not to, but he also knew that Dean’s unhurried and familiar tread brokered no urgency or danger. Sam didn’t say anything, just shifted and tried to get back to sleep. That was good. He had school tomorrow.
Jody entered the room then, looking down at her phone as she hung up a call. “Hey, what’d I miss?” she said.
Their second day of driving, shorter than the first, they followed Young Dean off and on along the I-64. Sometimes he would take off ahead, breaking speed limits just to test the motorbike’s capabilities. He’d pull off for a longer break, needing to stretch his legs more often, but then they’d see the old Triumph catch up with them again along the highway.
“Yeah,” said Dean. He scraped his fork through the hot sauce on his scrambled eggs and took a few more bites while he had the chance.
Dean picked up EMF activity throughout, sometimes strong and sometimes weak, with no real rule as to where or why. No other clues of the monstrous along the path. Or, for that matter, the angelic.
It was an earlier night than he’d expected for himself, but he was bone-tired. After brushing his teeth, he crawled beneath the scratchy motel blankets and fell to sleep at once.
Cas smiled sadly. “A few times,” he said. Voice soft, almost apologetic, though this Dean couldn’t understand why.
“I’m not very connected to other witches,” said Wallis. “Nana said most couldn’t be trusted. But she and Rowena were old friends. She used to come here. I heard
I knew it.” She handed Dean the carafe half-filled with water and abruptly left the room. Not for her library of hunter’s texts, but to another part of the house.
Cas looked uncertain, not sure how much to say, or where to begin. “There have been interruptions. Missions and causes that were mine to take on. My unintended absences. Possession or exile or death.”
These were questions he wouldn’t find answers to unless they finally succeeded, and Young Dean promised unequivocally that they would.
“I suppose he had my help,” said Cas. “I did fill Past-Cas in on a significant amount about the events of your lives, and the knowledge we’ve built. Not everything, by a long shot—I didn’t know what would change and what would remain—but it must have helped.”
“No,” said Mary with a faint shake of her head. She still looked unseeingly ahead. “One moment I was in a room in the house with John, and next time I thought of trying the door it opened out and there was more. I didn’t use to think of trying the door.”
“And you can’t return me till you're juiced up again? That’s what it sounded like, from what they said.”
They didn’t hear the story—likely for the best—but as they made their way back to the car managed to sort out the more productive task of planning their visit to Bernadette Higgins. At the cars, Holden handed over the ‘Compendium of the Angelic’ so that Cas, Dean, and Young Dean could look it over as they made their way back to Bisbee in the station wagon. Tempting as it was to show up on her doorstep that minute, they’d want to go in fully prepared. In the meantime, Holden would take Sam around Tucson to nerd out in a museum and find some good local grub.
“Holy shit.” A different voice, approaching Young Dean, who hadn’t looked away from the face of his older counterpart. The older Dean had only just redirected his attention from Cas to Young Dean. Looked him over with a passively critical glance. Young Dean made a scornful face in return, then turned his head over his shoulder towards the other voice he heard.
Past-Cas finally looked away from the pale buds of a flowering manzanita. “Hello, Dean,” he said. It wasn’t what you’d call a welcome with open arms, but Young Dean had the impression that he probably led a lot of the way, when Castiel first arrived in their lives. He sat on the ground cross-legged, facing Past-Cas.
Holden’s wan smile lingered. “I don’t think I would. You’re not an ordinary hunter, Dean. You saved a lot of us that day.”
“Hey, now. Aren’t you a scoundrel?” said Dean. He lowered to kiss Cas again. “My reputation,” he muttered against Cas’ lips. “Up in shreds.” Cas shut him up the best way he knew.
“Can you know that for sure?” Sam asked. “That’s what prayer is about. Having faith. Even if you don’t get an answer.”
Bobby glanced at Dean’s bag, but he didn’t ask to see the books at once. The promise of them already started to tip things in favour of believing Dean’s wild experience.
“Dean, I love this bike,” said Young Dean, tone shifting as he grasped at a brighter topic. “Do you think it will go through a portal?”
He might check out the sci-fi section, or the Westerns. He paused at the end of one shelf along the way. The slatwall end-cap propped up a few featured books. One caught his eye in particular. The cover was a painting of a winter scene, a river winding through the centre, mountains in the background, and a saddled horse. It had that almost sentimental quality of many old cowboy paintings and paperback Western covers, but something elevated it.
“We’ll save it for our golden years,” said Dean, leaning back a little and taking a relaxed swig of his beer. “Down in the community hall, drinking terrible coffee, triple-checking the numbers on our raffle tickets when they do the draw.”
“It would’ve gone faster if they hadn’t assigned a scouting partner with quite so many ‘hunches,’” said Cas. “But they’ve recovered Rachel and Peter’s bodies.”
He met something softer than the ground under his shoulders. Arms wrapped around his back. Pulled tightly against something solid and warm, and then he was no longer falling, but rolling roughly against the ground in an undestroyed part of the loft, his head protected by a cradling hand.
Cas sat back in his chair, eyes narrowed. “We’ll focus on the Fisher King for now,” he said. “As soon as that’s done, though, you need to tell us everything.”
Past-Cas lowered his heavy-lidded gaze to Young Dean’s mouth as if he could seek out the truth there. He lifted a hand to Young Dean’s jaw and traced a thumb against his bottom lip. Scientific curiosity. Reverent fascination. Unparalleled tenderness.
Cas stirred, eyes cracking open, grumpy and sleepy and muttering something unintelligible that had the sound of a question. Asking what Dean was doing, probably.
“God I hope I’m right about this,” said Sam. “At least you and Jack aren’t his type? A little past the age of adoption.”
Cas’ hand tangled with Dean’s, asking him to come back to the present. “What is it?” he asked. They stood close, nearly chest to chest. Dean’s head bowed, body slackening to rest further against the wall, and he looked over at Betty lying on the dirt floor in her calico dress. Limbs askew but face peaceful, Cas’ quick spell of unconsciousness a kindness.
Dean kept his arms folded. “That’s the gayest thing I ever heard.” His brow furrowed. “Or. Said?” The complicated question of whether or not Dean, in the present, had truly said the words Young Dean just spoke was too messy to pursue for long. “Both,” he decided.
“Did you like it?” Young Dean asked. He paced to a stop in front of the window, moonlight silvering his features. He looked over his shoulder. “Is that something you like, me being close to you?”
Cas studied him carefully before speaking. “I’d say that it shouldn’t be scary, but then I know how complicated communication can be. It’s something that always struck me, on your previous visits. You were so open when he wasn’t. I could say things to you he wouldn’t let me say to him.”
The man glanced down at the bottle in Dean’s hand, half-full, tipped his head, then sighed and said, “Sure.”
Her brown eyes rose to his face. Alarm battled with uncertainty, an urge to run and report fighting against the desire to stay.
“Cas, buddy,” Dean said, bumping a knuckle against his arm to ground him. “The world gets complicated, alright? But you get your grace back.”
He didn’t dread sleep. He felt with it a strange longing to go somewhere, to exist somewhere else. He couldn’t wrap words around the feeling.
“Yeah, god forbid you show me some fucking charity,” said Young Dean. He felt too near breaking so he took a long drink from his beer, letting it burn with how rapidly it went down his throat.
“There’s some bad news,” said Cas, sitting down on the bed opposite Dean. Dean moved to sit upright, tired but attentive, bringing his feet down to the cold motel room carpet.
“It’s true,” said Dean, standing at Cas’ side, purposefully letting their arms line up against each other. He nudged Cas with his elbow. “You two make good friends, actually. Couple a’ nerds.”
Young Dean woke up when they stopped for lunch and gas. Dean saw about filling up the tank, but when Young Dean made to go inside Sam stopped him. “Maybe you two better stay by the car,” he said, looking between the Deans. “You might draw the wrong kind of attention. You’ve got this sort of Uncanny Valley thing going on.”
it, Cas,” said Young Dean. The dread made him sink lower, and made Dean’s knuckles turn white on the wheel. He just had to get past the mountains, past this range, and then he wouldn’t feel these harrow-waves of ill-intent. Some frequency beyond hearing, but dammit he could feel it in his teeth. He fared better than Young Dean only because he had something to focus on, something other than the sense of menace burrowing under his marrow, scraping his bones.
“Yes,” said Cas. “It’s very warm out.” He looked at Young Dean again, taking off his outer shirt and hanging it over a chair as he spoke. “Temperature regulation is also new. There is a very limited range of comfort for the human body. I don’t know how you do it.”
“If we were to continue the metaphor, I think you’d be called a wildcard,” said Cas. “And you’ve brought me into it, too.” Cas looked away, lips pursed. “It
“And I’ll offer my thanks, even if you won’t remember it,” said Cas. “You’re such a gracious, courageous man, Dean. Thank you. We couldn’t have done it without your help.”
Past-Cas looked around the room as he came further inside. “You like it here,” he announced. “It feels private, but not lonely. You aren’t used to that.”
Knowing they might encounter demons on the mountain changed how they packed. Young Dean’s chief weapon had to be the gifted machete, which he kept strapped to him to have on hand. But they had other tools now, things Young Dean never dreamed of. Demon-trap bullets, angel blades, and this little pig-sticker of a knife that they said would end a demon for good.
Crowley turned his gaze up to Dean, studying him, taking his measure. He prowled forward, no longer needing Sam and Holden as human shields with the Lance of Michael in his hand. “You’re familiar with me,” he said. “Though I dispute being called ‘snake-eyed.’ I take it that in your world, we’re very good friends.”
Young Dean, solids, had two balls left and was on track to win, though his opponent had just made a successful shot and was lining up another that he’d have to be a real hack to fuck up. Dean wasn't worried, though. He'd had this game sketched out in his head since the start, down to the quippy one-liners. He shifted aside a hair as the waitress came by to clear away beer bottles from the surrounding tables, casting her a cursory glance.
“I’m not going to put anybody at risk,” said Young Dean. “I’ll tell you what’s relevant when it’s relevant.”
“That’s alright,” said Dean, looking away. “It’s a bummer, though. I was hoping to talk to you-from-the-future. I want to go there, for a visit.”
He hadn’t had an easy life. The way that John raised him and the things he faced in the hunting life burdened him. There were things he’d already done out of desperation that he couldn’t take back. When Young Dean first arrived in the future, it was clear just how used up and tainted he felt he was, despite all his youth. Coming to the future had given him some perspective, but for what? All it came with was the tragic promise of losing it again.
Dean smiled and just as he was about to make another smart ass remark, Cas pushed into him, using his grace to ease the discomfort and pretty much short-circuiting Dean’s brain.
Dean was supposed to be out Christmas shopping, and grocery shopping, but he accidentally forgot his grocery list and needed to come home. Cas was cleaning the kitchen as Dean had asked, and listening to music and dancing when Dean comes home.
Cas hesitated but he was frustrated, technically he could do this with his grace, and he had been getting ready to do it when Dean sat down. “Only if you promise not to peak at your present…”
Cas knew Dean knew exactly what he was doing, and leaned forward to kiss Dean, before moving them so he was on top of Dean, his legs now between Dean’s legs, and lazily rutting himself against Dean, earning a gasp and moan from Dean.
Cas’ eyes were a more dull blue then Dean was used to seeing, his hair slightly matted to his forehead with sweat, he whimpered, “Hurts…”
Dean shrugged some, “You can if you want to but I have kind of been needing to do a good deep-cleaned of the kitchen and whatnot. I just haven’t really had the chance, well I guess the motivation to actually do it,”
Dean watched Cas silently as he was making his coffee the former angel’s back to him, before gently wrapping his arms around Cas’ waist, resting his head on Cas’ shoulder, “Morning Cas…”
Cas bit his lip harder as he watched Dean fall gracefully to his knees. A couple of hours later, Dean and Castiel were both very naked, but they had now moved to the kitchen because Dean had gotten hungry. Dean grabbed an apron to cover himself because despite looking like a dork while wearing the apron while otherwise completely naked, it was going to keep him from getting hot grease or whatever he ended up cooking on his skin.
For a moment the girl was quiet, and Dean wondered if maybe he shouldn’t have mentioned the fact that he was in a gay relationship but then her face split into a bright smile and she practically squealed, “That is amazing! So let me guess you want something pretty meaningful, right?”
Dean looked at Cas with confusion, but then when he uttered that word worried washed over him, “What Cas?”
It took a few minutes for Dean to relax and the energy fade more so he felt utterly content. Dean refused to let go of Cas’ hand, and they reassured the rest of their small family that he was fine. Castiel insisted everyone go inside so that he could have a minute alone with Dean. Cas carefully pet Chaos as Claire walked by before he watched everyone go inside. Cas then smiled a little at Dean who looked less pale, and more relaxed. The ritual had affected Cas as well, but his grace was able to absorb most of the effects from it, but since Dean was human, he got the full effect, not to mention since Castiel was an angel it had added another unexpected layer to the ritual. “I love you, Dean,”
“Well you could get some Forget-Me-Nots, they symbolize true love, and imply that the person giving them wish never to be forgotten.” The young lady showed Dean the flowers she talking about. Dean liked them instantly, and they were a brilliant blue color, five petals and a little clumping of yellow pollen in the middle.
Castiel's mind floated back to the hunt, they were hunting a dragon who had a taste for Virgin men. They didn’t think that Cas had any chance of being taken because his vessel wasn’t a virgin but that apparently didn’t matter to the dragon. The dragon could sense the soul inside the non-virgin vessel was very much virgin.
Castiel welcomed the darkness that surrounded him, it was his time, and he knew Dean would survive, even with the likes of Chuck who was causing terror at every turn. That was who the Winchester’s had become, they were survivors.
Dean smiled and kissed Cas slowly, “Anything for you Angel, Do you want to watch some of that TV show I know you’ve been watching on the nights you don’t sleep?”
Cas blushed again deeply and then the smell of burning food drew their attention Cas pulled away and watched Dean turned around and groan loudly, the pancakes that had been in the pan were now burnt and he had no choice but to throw them out. Once he was finished he made his plate and Cas’ before taking it and they joined Sam in the library.
Cas closed his eyes and tried to contact Gabriel through angel radio first, but he got no reply, and when he focused on Gabriel’s grace, he could barely sense the archangel’s grace. Cas frowned and suddenly grabbed Dean’s hand, as he was lucky enough to feel enough to lock onto Gabriel’s location, “Hold on Dean,”
Dean nodded some and gently rubbed Cas’ back trying to soothe his boyfriend, “I know Angel… I know I am sorry Cas,”
Of course, Dean’s mouth worked faster than his brain and before he even realized he was saying it the words spilled out of his mouth, “So Angel, I was kind of thinking about us really getting married. I know I said at. First, we don’t have to and stuff but… I would like to call you my husband,”
It was only 5 minutes later when Cas heard the familiar rumble of the Impala’s engine as Dean pulled into the garage, Cas went to the library to greet the brothers. A minute later, Sam came in, and he looked outright exhausted. Cas couldn’t help but visually check over the hunter, though he knew Gabriel would do a more thorough job, Cas could only see a cut just above his eyebrow. Sam looked over at Cas and nodded some, and he knew what Cas had planned, “He is getting the guns… they need to be cleaned.”
Cas nodded some and kept running fingers through Dean’s hair, “It’s alright Dean, Do you think we should try and rest, it has been a long few days…”
Cas carefully set Dean’s plate and his coffee in front of him and watched the former hunter as he started eating. Over their past 40 years of marriage, they had had their arguments, even a couple nasty ones. Those had been so bad Cas, and Dean slept in different rooms for a few nights, but rarely apart for long because the angel and the hunter were too addicted to one another’s presence that sleeping alone for more than two nights would have them both realizing how stupid they were being. Now though, it was nearly impossible for Cas to watch Dean growing old because he knew that Dean was going to be gone soon. There had been a few close calls from hunts, but Cas or Gabe had been able to save him. When it came to growing old, Cas couldn’t change that, it was inevitable, and it broke his heart. Cas shook the thoughts away and moved next to Dean, gently touching Dean’s back and soothing himself, reminding himself that Dean was still there, had woken up another day.
Cas smiled contently before going back to eating his breakfast, the couple fell into a comfortable silence as they finished their breakfast.
Dean turned his back quickly and then going to his room. When he got back, Cas was no longer in bed, but the bathroom door was open and he could just see Cas lying on the floor. Panic went through him again and he rushed to Cas’ side, Cas was pressing himself against the cold tile and there was vomit in the toilet. Dean flushed the toilet before getting a rag wet and gently wiped Cas’ mouth and stroked his hair gently, “Hey there Angel… Gabe is coming okay,”
Dean looked at her, then the ring more closely, “Well, I would like to get one of those, the ring just like that, but… is there any way that blue band can be made green, like as close to my eyes as possible?”
Sam rolled his eyes and smirked gently, he knew what his brother was about to do, “So what are ya doing Dean?”
Dean stared at the mess of the kitchen; he was not really sure if he wanted to put in the effort to clean up the mess they had made. Yesterday Cas had distracted Dean while he was making dinner, then they left the kitchen in a bit of a disaster. Gabriel had mentioned possibly coming back today or tomorrow, Dean couldn’t remember considering he hadn’t really listened to his brother or his brother’s boyfriend. There was whipped cream, now hardened chocolate, ketchup, mustard, and a few cups that were now shattered, although Dean had not remembered the cups falling let alone breaking, then again Cas had him very much distracted.
Cas was quiet as he listened to Dean, letting the man speak before Dean trailed off and his face grew red, Cas could see the embarrassment in Dean’s eyes. “Dean…”
Dean smiled and then walked next to Cas to the register. Cas handed the woman the clothes, and he stared awkwardly as he watched her ring them up. Finally, she finished and looked up at Cas, “That’ll be 166.62”
Dean huffed in annoyance, and he was about to say something, but Sam walked in and cut him off, “Everything okay? I can hear you yelling from my room, dude?”
Dean took a deep breath as he stood at the end of the aisle, nodding to Sam as he made his way to his chair that was behind Jody and the girls. Dean locked eyes with Cas, and he attempted to choke back the tears he waited for them to stand before starting down the aisle. Dean nearly laughed as he sees Claire holding their adopted kitten, but he was more focused on his angel than anything else.
Dean gasped out with his last breath “I love you, Angel,” Dean’s eyes fell closed, and Cas could feel his heart-stopping. That finally broke the dam and Cas sobbed hard into his husband’s shoulder, clinging tightly and desperately to Dean’s body. Cas could feel Dean’s soul drifting out of his body and attaching itself to his grace, near where his heart was, and it made Castiel sob even harder.
Dean looked at Cas with concern, "Because you are a King, you are the king of the Roman Empire sire. Are you not feeling well?"
Cas’ eyes fell closed as he pulled his grace further within himself and focused on the sensations without his grace. Cas was almost overwhelmed by them before he found the right levels and Cas gasped loudly as suddenly Dean was now taking him all the way to the base and he fought the urge he felt to thrust forward.
After making a quick pit stop to splash some water on his face and calm himself down, Dean returned to their table and made small talk with Cas while they waited on their food. Once it arrived, Cas did eat most of his dinner, partially to appear to be normal since it would seem odd if he didn’t eat any of his dinners. However he also wanted to see if he withdrew his grace enough if he could taste the food past the molecules, and after a few attempts at trying to find the right level of his grace, he got it. Cas liked the champagne, and it was bubbly on his tongue and lovely. Cas also was pleased to see Dean relaxing as he ate his dinner as well.
Castiel wakes up to the most intense pain he had ever been in, his wings being the main source of his pain.
Sam easily remembered the last time he had seen Cas, "I saw him at like midnight, I was getting a drink of water, he was acting a little weird I guess. I tried to say something but he ignored me, I just thought he hadn't heard me..."
Dean ignored his brother's annoyed tone, "Have you seen Cas? I woke up and he was gone, and I can't find him."
Dean almost instantly felt overwhelmed by the sensation of having Cas touching him, it had never felt this intense before but then again with Cas everything was more intense, it always had been.
Castiel's face twisted with confusion and he tilted his head just so at Dean, and Dean couldn’t help but admit that it was adorable. Cas’s voice was even deeper and more gravelly than usual as he replied, “I am no longer an angel Dean?”
Dean chuckled again and smiled, “It was cute Cas, a little subdued, I think. What are you even listening too.”
By the time Cas was finished explaining, he was shaking some and his wings were folded against his back tighter then before as if for protection. Dean gently reached out and took Cas’ hand pulling the angel’s focus to him, “Shhh, hey Angel your wings are amazing, you helped us defeat Lucifer, who gives a shit about his wings being pure white, he rebelled right? Just because your wings are a certain color doesn’t mean a damn thing. They are breathtaking” Cas stayed silent, letting Dean hold him and calming himself and his emotions down.
Dean sighed gently before nodding, gently running his fingers through Cas; hair and stifling a yawn as the exhaustion he had been deliberately ignoring was starting to become overwhelming again. “Okay Angel, as much as I love sitting with you I need to lay down, I am sore and exhausted,” Cas blushed gently feeling bad for making Dean continue to be sitting up and moved so Dean could lay down. Dean scooted over so there was enough room for Cas, “Come on angel, lay with me?”
It's been almost a week since Charlie's death, Dean hasn't been sleeping much at all but this time his body is just to exhausted and he sleeps for over 12 hrs
Sam pouted and looked between Cas and Dean before finally climbing into Cas’ lap, Gabriel followed quickly. Cas looked like a deer in headlights as the two toddlers cuddled into his side. Dean couldn’t hold back his laughter this time, and quickly grabbing the seatbelt and seat belted Cas and the toddlers in, “Alright well, since they were sent to get dinner and didn’t. We are going to get dinner.”
Gabriel shook his head taking a slight step back instead of closer, “Pretty sure if I touched him you would try to kill me baby bird.”
Castiel slowly nodded, “Yes, but, the child would have us, and as an angel, I could protect them… even after…”
Before Cas could bury his face in Dean’s chest again he shook his head and hooked a finger under the former angel’s chin and kissed him chastely before saying, “I have been up for an hour already Cas. Come on angel, let’s go and eat some breakfast. I will even be nice and make you pancakes.”
Dean is 72 years old now, it is the morning of his birthday and the day goes like every single birthday in the last 5 years. Except for the ending.
Dean hummed gently, “I will take a scotch and soda, and he will have a glass of champagne, something sweet.”
Dean bit his lip to keep himself from laughing as he watched Cas dancing around the bunker as he was cleaning. Sam was gone to help Jody out with something, and Dean had meant to be gone all day so that he could go Christmas shopping, and then grocery shopping. Dean, however, had needed to come home after finishing his Christmas shopping because he had forgotten his grocery list. Dean knew normally his angel would use his grace to clean since he had gotten it back, but sometimes he would clean the human way.
Dean sighed some before nodding and going with Cas inside, holding his hand tightly. Dean went up to the booth, with Cas just behind him and waited as the girl with black hair was writing something down. When she looked up, she smiled warmly, “Hi, do you have a reservation?”
Dean resisted the urge to laugh, knowing his angel wouldn’t understand it and would get more upset, he shook his head, “Cas don't you get it, I have fucked up a lot too, and done things well… some unimaginable things but I will tell you about that later but my point is, Is that we are just as fucked up as the other Cas. Despite the literal Hell we have been through, I think that finding you, us finding each other in all this shit, it makes it… tolerable.”
There was a moment of slightly awkward silence before Sam cleared his throat gently, “Gabriel thinks he needs to talk to Dean, make sure Dean knows not to be a dumbass and fuck this up with you. Gabriel also thinks I should have a similar talk with you but… well truthfully Cas, I think you are the best thing that has ever happened to Dean. I know Dean can be a real pain in the ass and I want you to know that if you and Dean ever do get into it bad, that you can come to me and I won’t just immediately take Dean’s side. You have made a huge difference in Dean’s life Cas, so thank you for being there for him.”
“This seems like as good a time as any,” said Sam, “to say we should head out. You can drop me off at the airport.”
“Yeah, you are,” said Dean. If anything, the fact he didn’t respond with a jibe went to show how seriously he took this. Sam’s posture shifted minutely, granting deeper attention.
have and Dean didn’t even need to ask that to know it for fact—but he was damn good at pushing the limits. There was something Dean was missing. Neither Young Dean nor Past-Cas said a word about it, Young Dean striking up a conversation with Sam as he went about filling up his plate with eggs, licking away some bacon grease from his thumb.
“Trust me, you’re going back to an easier time,” said Dean. “Before angels and gods and the repeated apocalypse. It’s almost refreshing.”
“Right,” said Young Dean, biting his lower lip and nodding. “Getting Cas back is only Step One for a better world. Then… there’ll be everything else.”
“I know,” said Dean. “I know, it gets more complicated.” Sam set down his toast again, hands wrapping around his coffee instead. He didn’t lift it to drink, watching Dean carefully instead.
“Bisbee, Arizona. October of 2000. If anything, you’ve got a better idea of what’s ahead than me.” Young Dean stepped through the portal.
“This is the most damfool thing I may have done…” Bobby muttered, but he got up and opened one of the kitchen drawers. It rattled with half-rusted tools, old batteries, and one or two bottles of pills. He came back, tapping a couple out into the cap. “You can have these, but nothing to drink. Hell, probably good for you to get some sleep. Never seen you this messed up.”
“Wouldn’t we all?” she said. She looked at Young Dean. “What about you? You said this was your second visit to the future. What was so great you couldn’t get enough?”
Cas regarded Dean last, his eyes searching him up and down before turning back towards the scrubland at the side of the road. His gaze turned millions of miles distant. “It has been some time since I looked upon something beautiful,” he answered.
“Hey, don’t bring us into this,” said Dean, raising his hands. “But also. Lanie? Hunter to hunter. Take the good where you can get it. Nothing’s guaranteed, not even tomorrow.”
“You can’t feel anything yet,” said Cas, and that was all the warning he gave. He lifted the heavy beam easily, but Dean had to look away as Sam yelled out in pain. Cas quickly placed a hand on Sam’s arm, grace flowing through to repair his limbs and heal every scrape and bruise.
“You have brought us a queenly gift,” said the hag. She took another pull from the moonshine and cackled in delight. “But land-farers do not summon the three sisters for nothing. What do you seek?”
“I’d have nothing to do with it,” Cas said, looking at Dean again. “It won’t be the first time they’ve ‘corrected’ me. The angel with ‘a crack in his chassis,’ remember?”
“No one’s answered my question,” said Young Dean. “If I step out the door up there, I’m not gonna find some irradiated nuclear hellscape, right?”
Cas gave a slight nod and watched Sam go before turning as Dean came in, he checked over his hunter more thoroughly, Dean had a cut on his cheek, and the man was favoring his left leg, with his grace he could see a deep cut on Dean’s leg, and there was a small fracture. Dean carefully put his duffel bag and the bag of guns on the table before he moved to wrap his arms around Cas.
Dean drove to the mall with Cas sitting shotgun, holding Dean’s hand gently. Cas had wanted a new suit, and his trench coat had gotten a large tear in it, Cas had wanted to restore it with his grace but Dean suggested he get a new one. Dean needed a few more t-shirts and new jeans as well. Gabriel had given Dean a credit card with an apparently unlimited amount of money on it or something like that. Dean hadn’t really listened to Gabriel, and just took it since he didn’t want to have to pay for it himself.
Dean chuckled softly and nodded, grabbing the grocery list from the fridge, stepping more into his angel’s space, “I forgot the list for the groceries, so I came back to get it. Having fun, Angel?”
Gabriel threw his head back and groaned heavily, “Damn it, okay fine. Go back to your room, I will be there in a minute.”
Dean’s head turned so fast he practically gave himself whiplash, because he recognized Sam’s little voice saying a name he hadn’t heard since Sam was nearly 7. When Dean turned around, there sat a 3-year-old Sam Winchester, and Dean’s eyes widened considerably. “Sammy?”
Cas started to pull away, but Dean was faster and easily hooked his arm around Cas’ waist keeping him in place. After a quiet moment, Cas looked down and his voice was softer and shakier than Dean had ever really heard it, “Do you not find me, attractive Dean?”
Cas nodded and moved out of Dean’s way so Dean could look. Dean easily found all the pieces in Cas’ size. Dean handed them to him then looked at Cas, “Do you want to pay for it?”
Dean’s eyes opened and at first, he just noticed their nakedness but when he saw a small flutter behind Cas his eyes caught Cas’ wings and his eyes widened, and he met Cas eyes, “Really Angel?”
The Empty narrowed its eyes at him, then licked its lips before speaking, “It was always about Dean Winchester for you, even when you woke up the first time, when I looked through your memories, you were far more concerned with Dean than Sam, well in a different way. You loved him.”
Dean sighed, having hoped and maybe even prayed a little, that the former angel would forget that detail, but of course, he hadn’t. “That my angel is a story for another time. Why don’t we figure out where the hell we are so we can get home and I can have access to booze if you want to have that conversation.”
After almost half an hour of lazy thrusts, tender kisses, and nothing short of what felt like worship, it was no longer enough for both of them and Dean begged him for more. Cas slowly pulled almost all the way out before slamming back in, and not giving Dean time to process before he was doing it again, this time speeding up between each thrust. Cas used his wings to help him keep his balance and this was turning Dean on even more and pushing him even closer to his orgasm.
Cas’ voice sounded more broken than he wanted it to and Dean could tell the angel was lying, it hurt something deep inside Dean to see his angel so broken. Dean knew Cas would protest to being called an angel because he wasn’t, but wings and halo or not, Castiel would forever be his angel. Dean turned the radio off and carefully scooted closer to Cas. Despite his feigning of straightness, the hunter was very much not straight. He was bisexual, pretty much as long as he could really remember but didn’t accept it until he was 16.
Dean closed his eyes tightly, doing his best to fight the tears that threatened at his eyes and trying desperately to swallow around the lump in his throat, Charlie was gone, and it had been his fault, he should have been closer. Dean had been riding on a high since they had started their relationship, even with their first hunt together having gone a bit sideways, Dean had been letting himself think that maybe for once things could be good. Now, thought he couldn’t stop himself from wondering how long it was until he got Cas killed too.
Dean sighed more heavily this time before taking a deep breath, “I was going to… I have… I have just been nervous about this Sammy,”
Dean shook his head gently, smiling warmly at Cas, “You can call me whatever you want Cas, Honeybee is good.”
An hour later the doctor came in and Sam gently nudged Cas, they both stood and the doctor smiled some comfortingly, “He is fine, we had to intubate him and he is still intubated right now. We are giving him some antihistamines via an IV since we found no stingers we believe that it was wasps. We will be prescribing him an Epi-Pen because of how severe this reaction was and we don’t want this to get this bad again. He will need to stay here overnight for monitoring but if you would like I can take you to see Mr. Ackles now?”
I apologize now guys,  this one hurts a bit. Also this is a canon death but not the actual way said character died so
It only took a few more thrusts before Dean was spilling over Cas’ hand, “Castiel” Dean came with a shout.
Cas smiled some, finding it slightly adorable to see how nervous Dean was. Cas gently stretched out his wings, they were the only part of him that was even remotely stiff, instead of making them disappear he decided to fold them against his back and he stood up so he could look at the drawing. Dean hesitantly handed Cas the sketchbook, quickly looking at how not wanting to see how much Cas hated the drawing. What Dean missed in watching Cas look at the drawing, was the way Cas’ eyes widened in shock and awe, the drawing was beautiful. Dean had put the most detail in his wings but, seeing them drawn like that, Cas thought they were beautiful. “D…dean?”
Cas looked at Dean, his eyes were starting to drop sleepily, and Cas sighed, he had wanted to bring up the idea of a child, wanted Dean to be fully aware it was an option, and not something he had made a decision for on his own but he also didn’t want to keep Dean up anymore. Cas pulled Dean closer, kissing the side of his neck gently, meant to be more comforting rather than sexy, “Go to sleep Dean, we can talk more later.”
Just as Sam had opened his mouth to argue more, Gabriel waltzed in smiling gently, “We got a case? Cool.”
Cas took Dean’s displays of affection as permission for his own and he gently pulled Dean into his arms, his arm wrapped gently around Dean’s waist, “I know Dean, you should have heard the things he was thinking,”
After a moment Dean carefully reached out to run his fingers along with Cas’ wings, eliciting a gentle breathy moan from Cas, “Dean…”
Cas had had his grace back for a few days now, it was currently midnight, Dean had fallen asleep two hours ago, Cas had tried sleeping the first night that he had his grace back ended up having a nightmare and just decided to use his grace to maintain his vessel and stay awake. Cas didn’t mind not sleeping, he loved to watch Dean sleep even if Dean told him it was creepy, all the tension and worry on his face disappeared and he looked happy. Cas carefully stroked his fingers through Dean’s hair gently using his grace to make sure Dean was having pleasant dreams.
Cas looked down at Dean and smiled softly, Dean’s hair was sticking up in funny ways, reminding Cas of a hedgehog. He replied softly, “Morning my sleepy Honeybee”
When he finally reached Cas, he couldn’t stop himself from wrapping his arms around the angel and sighing into his arms, Cas did the same and felt him relax into the embrace. Dean could feel everyone’s eyes on him, but he couldn’t find it in himself to care, he missed his angel even though it had only been a few hours.
Dean laughed as he walked away pulling Cas along with him. After eating his lunch Dean helped Cas with grooming his wings. By the time Dean finished Cas was groaning gently with pleasure, in an attempt to stop the purring and high-keening noises he bit his lip. Dean finally finished and stopped teasing Cas, because the last five minutes Cas had been done but his angel was making such pretty noises. “Okay Angel, all done. You can put the wings away now.”
Cas closed his eyes tightly and let his head hang before chewing on his lip, “He… he wasn’t breathing Sam… he…”
Castiel closed his eyes after pushing Dean away, welcoming the feeling of the Empty pulling him in, ready for sleep. Castiel had said what he needed to, to Dean, finally, the words had passed his lips, words for feelings he had known for a very long time.
Dean smiled happily as he watched Sam and Gabriel disappear, Gabe had wanted to take Sam away for the weekend to someplace in another country. Dean hadn’t listened past Sam telling him they wanted to leave for the weekend because it meant he could be alone with his angel.
Cas eyebrows rose excitedly, in the last few weeks of living in the bunker, Cas had discovered his favorite food was Dean’s pancakes. “With blueberries?”
Sometimes though when Cas was struggling lately he noticed that Cas tended to seek Dean out more than Sam even though Sam was more equipped to handle the emotional baggage. Dean took a deep breath and softly spoke, this was as good of a time as any to finally figure out if Cas still felt the same, “Cas… do you… do you remember what happened when we were in Purgatory?”
Technically this is the 21st prompt but i am not going to label it so, just know that now, all the prompts are actually 1 number lower
Cas attention was drawn back to Dean and he nodded gently, “No I do, I just… it has been a while since anyone else could help me with grooming my wings…”
Sam nodded some and then looked towards Dean’s room as his music started playing loudly. Cas knew that was his signal, and Sam nodded to Cas when he looked at Sam as if asking permission to go before getting up. Cas walked to Dean’s room, before gently knocking, not that he needed to, Dean would know who was coming in but he wanted to give Dean a chance to make him leave if he still wasn’t ready. When no refusal came Cas gently entered the room, Dean was lying in the bed, seemingly listening to the music but anyone who knew Dean well enough could see he wasn’t paying attention to the music. Cas gently stripped out of his shirt and jeans before joining Dean in bed, waiting silently for Dean to be ready to talk.
Dean looked around with obvious confusion in his eyes, he could see he was in a hospital bed, and he saw Sam getting up to leave, Dean knew probably to get the doctors. When Dean’s eyes met Cas’ he could see the worry on his lovers face. Dean wanted to talk but the tube still in his throat made it impossible, Cas gently cupped Dean’s cheek and whispered, “Shhh Dean just relax, Sam went to go and get the doctor so they can remove the tube, just try to relax Honeybee…”
Cas nodded some and it took a bit for the pain meds to start to kick in but once they had his body relaxed completely. Dean smiled and with Sam’s help this time took Cas out to the car laying him down in the backseat. They took a pillow and the thin quilt-like blanket from the motel so Cas could sleep as much as possible on their drive back to the bunker.
A moment after Cas’ text, Gabriel knocked on his door, Dean took a deep breath before getting up and opening the door. Gabriel glared at Dean for a moment before letting himself into the room. Dean sighed gently before closing his door behind the archangel, Gabe sat at the desk and tilted back on the chair as most kids do in school when they are bored.
If he wanted to, Cas could have let himself cry, but he refused to cry yet. Cas just smiled warmly at Sam, “Thank you, Sam, it is my honor to be a part of your wonderful family.”
Dean’s eyes widened as he stared between the food and Cas, he couldn’t stop the smile that crossed his face, “Cas…”
Cas had been able to get a few hours last night, and now he was just laying in bed with Dean, Dean was awake and gently running his fingers over the taut skin of Cas’ abs. Cas’ stomach fluttered and his arousal spike, he let out a soft moan, “Dean…”
Dean sighed gently, he knew how Sam had felt for the archangel after a drunken night ending with Sam sobbing to sleep over Gabriel’s death. “Because Sam, I don’t trust the guy enough to leave him here by himself, so we take him with or one of us stays back with him.”
Sometimes Cas was even right alongside him as these things happened, and Cas would understand what he was going through because a lot of the time Cas was feeling the same things.
The case Sam had found, was a witch who was De-aging people into toddlers, and then the children ended up dead. Sam hadn’t even been sure if the case they had, was even a case because it was just abductions, signs of demons, and then children looking similar to the people had been abducted showing up dead a week later. Dean and Sam had decided to check it out just in case, mostly because of the signs of the demon’s in the area, Castiel and Gabriel had agreed to go with them, so they could lend a hand in case it was something more than simple abductions.
Cas smiled before his hand glowed gently as he used his grace to make sure Dean stayed asleep, then he closed his eyes, pulling his wings from the other plan. His right-wing hurt and he was unsure why but he needed to figure it out. As he stretched them out and brought it so he could see at least part of it, he could see there was a singed feather twisted the wrong way, located exactly where the pain was. Cas reached up and gently tugged on the feather, whining a little at the slight pain but was finally able to pull the burnt feather out. Cas stared at the burnt feather, it was still black but the edges were frayed from having been burnt by Hellfire. Cas closed his eyes to make the feather disappear, then sent his wings back to the other plane. When he looked at Dean the hunter was still fast asleep.
Cas was the one who spoke up this time before Sam or Dean could argue, “He is correct Dean. Gabriel had a history of running away from our family, he faced Lucifer so that you and Samuel could have a chance to stop the Apocalypse and Lucifer killed him, I do believe you need to give him more credit.”
When Dean Winchester had imagined his deathbed, he had once thought that he would be going out in a hail of bullets or getting killed by a monster. Sure there had been close calls over the years, and he had died a few times, but this time, this felt final. Dean knew very well he wouldn’t be coming back from this death. Dean thought he was ready for death, but after everything, he wasn’t so sure he was prepared to go, but something was telling him it was the end, and he was actually scared now. Dean whimpered as his chest got tighter and he clung desperately to Cas, blurting out, “I… I am sca…scared Angel…”
Cas shook his head vehemently at the idea of even arguing about this, “Dean you could have died, you… you nearly died, and I couldn’t do anything about it… I… I can’t…”
The Empty hummed as it moved over to the throne Castiel had found it sitting on before. It was an elaborate throne, muted gold, and Castiel wasn’t sure if the muted color came from simply being in the Empty or if it was meant to be that way. The jewels were barely glittering as well. The Empty looked over at Castiel once more, leaning back in the throne crossing its legs and the blond curls falling down its back. “Humanity, they always seemed so boring to me, until I looked through your eyes Castiel. You see them as more than the apes your brothers and sister see them as.”
Dean sighed and slowly looked up at Cas, he wasn’t expecting to see the amazement and shock in Cas’ face. “You… you like it?”
Castiel didn’t regret his words for a moment, not even regretting ending his life to protect Dean, that was who Castiel had become. The Angel of Thursday, who had once followed Heaven’s every order,  to an angel willing to lay his life down for one man. A man he had come to love wholly and endlessly, nothing had ever mattered to Castiel as much as Dean Winchester had.
Gabriel shook his head, “Wrong, you are feeling aroused and protective. Every time Dean makes even a slight noise you look at him to check if he is okay and then you look at me as if I am encroaching on your territory”
Dean hugged him gently and closed his eyes, he could tell that it was a sore subject for Cas and he wouldn’t force Cas to talk about it right now. Dean helped Cas up, and they walked back to the Impala.
Cas looked away from Gabriel as he started to explained everything that had happened since Gabriel died. After he was finished, he refused to meet his older brother's eyes, too ashamed of all the bad decisions and the things he had done.
Cas closed his eyes tightly and covered his face, something told him to play along for now until he could get out. Whatever this was he needed more information so he could find his way out. "N...no I... I am sorry Dean. I... I am fine... I... I had a bad dream."
Cas didn’t mind the way Dean was clinging to him, in truth Cas relished in it, he could feel the desire to be as close as physically possible coming from Dean and in truth, he felt the same.
Cas had made all of Dean’s favorite food, bacon cheeseburgers, French fries and there was a pecan pie in the oven. Cas had even bought vanilla bean ice cream at the store to go with the pie. Sam and Dean had left for a hunt the day after Cas’ wings were finished molting, not having much choice. It had been 6 days, Cas had not wanted to leave the bunker, after his wings had molted he had felt the overwhelming desire to be at home, Gabriel had explained that it was common after molting, to want to stay in a familiar place, Gabriel called it nesting but Dean had made fun of that.
Sam hit the horn over and over as he pulled up to the emergency entrance, two nurses and a few doctors ran out to meet them. Cas was trying to wake Dean and one of the doctors pulled Cas off him and Cas growled and tried to fight against them until Sam grabbed his arm, “Cas! Cas come on let them do what the need to!”
Cas nodded gently and looked at the toddlers again with apparent hesitation, “How… how do we… I… I do not know how to take care of children. I mean I even avoided spending time with fledglings… I…”
Cas pulled away so he was sitting more on the back of his heels and started thrusting harder into Dean, pumping Dean’s cock faster as well. “So good Dean… you… feel so good.”
Cas cheeks suddenly felt hot as he blushed and chewed on his lip before replying more quietly, “I… I um called you Honeybee…”
Cas looked out the window and he could recognize he was in Rome, but something about what he was seeing was off, some of it seemed blurry that should have been clear. Cas couldn't figure out what was wrong though, he just knew something wasn't right. Castiel knew he shouldn't be here, he knew he was an angel. When he tried to use his grace he was being bound by something, and when he tried to call his wings they refused to appear and panic coiled desperately in his chest, "No no no no..."
Cas gripped Dean’s shoulder and used his grace to change their clothes, Dean in his swimming trunks, and Cas put himself in some trunks of his own. “There,”
Dean took Cas hand in his while the man was focused on ringing up the last 2 pairs of jeans, at first Cas was hesitant to let him because he knew Dean’s views on public displays of affection, especially with him, and he could tell that the man in front of them was obviously homophobic, simply by the awful thoughts going through his mind, as he projected them to heaven, obviously unknowing Cas was an angel. When Cas’ saw Dean’s smirking though he relaxed minutely, knowing full well Dean intended to piss off the jerk in front of him.
When Cas returned the pizza, Dean was already sprawled out on the couch in one of the rec rooms that Sam had set up. He was currently trying to find something on Netflix, “What should we watch Angel?” Dean spoke as soon as he heard the telltale flutter of wings.
The woman paused for a moment before an idea popped into her head and she went to another basket, grabbing some white flowers, and some more green foliage and made a rather elegant looking bouquet. As she came back to her small counter so Dean could pay, she explained, “These white flowers are called Dittanies, they symbolize love, passion and some people believe they are an aphrodisiac.”
A week later, they brought home, a runt of the litter, black male kitten, with one bright blue eye, and one bright green eye. Since Cas was the one who wanted the kitten in the first place, he let the angel name him. Despite the kittens sweet, very calm demeanor Castiel chose the name Chaos, saying it just seemed right.
Dean chuckled tiredly, rolling his eyes some before stretching himself out but not really moving away from Cas, before tugging the blanket over him more, smacking his lips tiredly as he asked, “What time is it?”
Dean was still hesitant, he believed Cas when the angel said he wasn’t going to disappear but at the same time, this felt too surreal. How was this not just a dream, after twelve years and Castiel had died in front of him for the millionth time it felt like, after finally admitting his feelings for Dean? Dean was angry with himself that after twelve years and the angel dying in front of him he still hadn’t been able to say it.
Cas sighed and then nodded, “Okay, are you sure you want my help though? I know you are very protective of her.”
So I am sorry this is a day late guys, its been a rough weekend. My mom had a heart attack and I didn't have this chapter pre-wrote so I couldn't just upload it and I was to busy to write it.
When Cas’ orgasm finally died down, he was able to focus on Dean, to see that now Dean was out cold and panting hard in his knocked out state. With some gently maneuvering and some help from Cas’ grace, Cas was now laying spooned against Dean's back, his cock still hard in Dean’s hole, and his right-wing now covering them like a blanket. Cas was relieved that Dean was relaxed enough to be asleep now, his skin was not as hot now but still much warmer then Cas would have liked. Cas tried to remember how long an Omega angel’s heat lasted but couldn’t seem to recollect the information. Cas knew though that Dean would need him through the whole thing and he promised to himself and Dean that he would be there the entire time.
Cas chuckled softly, and then the two started making out again, this time with more passion before Dean pulled away hesitantly and ushered them back to Baby and drove home. After wonderfully passionate sex, Cas was watching over Dean as he was sleeping. His eyes traveled down to the ring on his finger again, and carefully pulled it off to examine it better, the green band in the middle was almost the exact shade of Dean’s and as Cas was turning it over in his fingers the inscription caught his eyes, “Always my Angel” in a fancy cursive font. Cas couldn’t stop the tears that he shed as he looked from the ring to Dean, and back at the ring again with so much love, he thought if it had been possible his heart might have burst.
Dean shook his head before turning on his side and grabbing the lube out of his drawer and then forced himself to take a deep breath, he would show Cas instead. Dean gently nudged Cas away from him, “Just… watch and… and then do what I do.”
Dean and Cas followed the girl to a booth towards the back of the restaurant. Once Dean and Cas had both sat down she set their menus in front of them, “Your waiter will be with you in just a moment, please enjoy your meal.”
Dean nodded and then cuddled more into Cas’ side closing his eyes tightly. He was mentally and physically exhausted, the smell of Charlie’s blood and burning flesh clinging to his nose and making his stomach turn, he dug his face further into Cas’ shoulder trying to just focus on Cas’ smell. Dean wished desperately he could bring her back, Charlie hadn’t deserved to die, especially not the brutal way she had, it wasn’t fair. Dean closed his eyes tighter clinging desperately to Cas, and he didn’t realize how tightly he was clinging to Cas until Cas’ fingers were gently raking against his scalp to calm him and his voice was a little strangled “Honeybee, hey it’s okay…”
Dean looked at Cas, smiling at the thought that his angel had done everything for him, but tears also forming in his eyes, “You… you did all of it?”
Dean blinked a few times before refocusing and then taking Cas’ in his mouth, carefully using his lips to cover his teeth and going slowly, taking Cas nearly all the way before his gag reflex forced him to pull off some.
Dean picked up his jeans again and explained as they walked toward the register, “The first number is the waistline, and the second one is the length.”
So because there are only 30 prompts and 31 days in August I split this prompt into 2. Also because I am an evil person and wanted to make you wait for what happens next another day.
Dean smiled warmly at the text, his chest easing with some of the anxiety he had been feeling. Although knowing that Gabriel wanted to talk to him alone made Dean nervous again, because if Sam wanted to talk with Cas, it meant that their brothers would be lecturing them. Dean was mostly worried because as carefree and nonchalant as Gabriel seemed most of the time, Dean knew very well that the archangel was very protective over Cas and so Gabriel’s lecture, would be more threatening than anything else.
Dean choked on his food, coughing hard to dislodge the food before taking a swig of his orange juice and then glaring at his brother, “First of all I like it, and secondly don’t even think about making fun of Cas for it, I don’t want him thinking he needs to feel ashamed of it.”
Dean could see the pain that crossed Cas’ face, and he knew Cas had thought about his death, so he gently pulled Cas close to him, “Come on Angel, let’s go wash Baby.”
Dean softly chewed on his lip before nodding some Cas was right. He had only gotten his usual 4 hours during the hunt, and then after killing the werewolves they had come straight back to the bunker, then Dean had spent an hour building the pyre and then they had spent the day outside watching her burn. As Dean started to relax, his music lulling him to sleep and the warmth of Cas next to him, he was able to finally fall asleep.
Dean smiled gently and nodded, “They are bud, but you can’t just grab at them okay. You have to ask if you can touch them first. And if he says no, that means no right, Sammy?”
On the inside Cas wanted to scream, he tried to argue, he wanted to go to his father and demand that Dean live, even though he had known this was going to happen eventually it didn’t make things any easier. Cas pulled on his grace and snapped his fingers to light the fire, before watching the fire consume his husband’s body and collapsing to the ground as all the emotions broke over him again.
Cas gasped loudly as Dean’s hole spasmed around him and he only manages another thrust before he found himself spilling inside of Dean.
Cas gave a soft nod, “After you took such good care of me when my wings were molting I wanted to repay you,”
Cas turned to see Dean laying net to him, but he recognized he wasn't seeing Dean's soul, he was seeing Dean as if he was a human again. Dean smiled and leaned forward, "Good Morning my King,"
Dean smiled and took them before walking back towards Baby but stopping at the Honey booth. He bought a few different jars of honey, one of them had fresh honeycomb in it, and Dean knew Cas would love it. After the man wrapped up, the honey Dean headed back towards Baby. Dean took a deep breath before pulling his phone out to text Cas to get dressed in his new suit, then carefully put the honey on the floor and the flowers on the seat next to him. Dean’s drive back to the bunker had his nerves on edge, and the ring box was burning a hole in his pocket.
Instantly the need to protect Dean faded, Cas was now remembering what he had been taught about angel sexuality, and he knew that this was because he was in his own space. And this space hadn’t been touched by anyone else in the last half-century but by him and Dean.
A hunt for a witch goes wrong when the witch hits Dean with a spell and suddenly Dean needs Cas more than he has ever needed Cas before. Only problem is, Gabe and Cas are in Heaven, how will Sam reach them.
Sitting next to where Sam had just been, there was a toddler version of Gabriel, Cas carefully, but awkwardly picked the toddler up. Dean looked at Cas, who was awkwardly holding Gabriel and held back a laugh as he stared at Cas, holding a toddler Gabriel.
The next night though, Castiel finally brought up the one thing he had been avoided for so long now. “Dean there is something I need to talk to you about,”
Cas spun around so quickly he nearly gave himself whiplash to see Gabriel standing there with a small smirk on his face. Cas stared at him with shock and fear and tried to move away, "You... you are dead this isn't right."
Cas scoffed a little, rolling his eyes at the same time having expected the question. The Doctor smiled some before shaking his head, “We want to keep you one more night for observation. Some of the wasps' venoms could still be in your system and we would prefer to keep you with the Intravenous antihistamines.
Being in love with someone who understood the life of a Hunter was probably the best thing, because after a rough hun or even getting hurt Cas was there to come home to.
Dean turned around planning to find his angel, and his angel was standing in the doorway, his hair wet and just a towel around his waist, Dean raised his eyebrow curiously, “You never shower anymore?”
Dean gets home, and after getting dressed he gives Cas the flowers and the honey. And then they go to dinner.
Dean stared at Cas’ wings, there were huge chunks of feathers missing, and just making Cas’ wings appear it had made him lose more feathers. “Is there anything I can do?”
Cas lifted his eyes slowly to meet Dean’s before this time more confidently saying, “Well… we have been… a couple… for a month and a half now, but… we have not had intercourse… I… I know I am not in the same state as when I was an angel… I more scars and…”
The Library got cleaned and then they moved to clean Cas’ room, not that Cas actually used his room anymore but he did keep his clothes and some of the things he had there. Dean had said it was a good idea for him to have his own space so that when they were fighting or Dean was being an asshole, they could both go somewhere to be alone. Not that they had had any fights or either of the men had wanted to be apart for long periods of time at this point, but then even that could cause arguments.
Dean didn’t reply to his brother this time and just went to his room. Dean changed into his fed suit, he had had it cleaned last week, and they hadn’t had a case, so it was still in pristine condition. Dean trimmed his stubble, and then put on his favorite cologne before studying himself in the mirror for a moment, and maybe silently giving himself a pep talk, because despite his brother confidence Dean’s was shakey. Dean finally grabbed the bouquet and the jar of honey, before he went back into the library, where Cas was enthralled with whatever lore book he was reading. Dean took a breath before clearing his throat to make sure Cas looked up at him. Cas gasped gently at the bundle of flowers and the jar of honey.
Dean woke up slowly to the room being uncomfortably silent, Cas wasn't snoring, and he didn't hear the TV. When he looked at the spot next to him where Cas had definitely been when he fell asleep, the angel was mysteriously gone. Something was wrong, Dean didn't know what but something was wrong, he had woken up alone before but somehow he had always felt Cas, now he felt oddly empty. Dean quickly got up and started checking around the bunker, first the kitchen, then the library, then the gym, no sign of Castiel. Finally, Dean went to his brother's room and pounded on the door trying to fight the panic coiling in his chest. When Sam answered the door, his hair was a mess and it was obvious his brother had been sleeping still, "Dude what the hell?"
Cas used some more of his failing grace to ease things for Dean and slowly pressed himself all the way in, and Dean gasped out his hand’s searching for something to hold and Cas reached his hand out to grab on and their fingers laced together instantly.
Cas panted hard, continuing to hold himself off of Dean before making his wings disappear, then slowly pulling out of Dean and collapsing next to him.
She smiled and then gathered a few, also putting in some other small greenery, so the bundle looked a little fuller, but she still thought it was small and softly asked, “Awesome, do you want to do just these or maybe something else too?”
Dean smiled and moved closer to Cas, kissing him gently, “Do you mind if I get lunch before I help out with your wings?”
Gabe nodded and watched Dean as he laid Castiel down, once he was settled Gabe carefully placed his hand between Cas’ shoulder blades and focused on bringing Cas’ wings forth to this plane. “It usually happens every 100 years for us,”
Dean shrugged some before pulling away, “I gotta get dressed, I found a nice restaurant, and its owned by a gay couple so.”
Cas carefully moved out of Dean’s embrace, wanting to make coffee and breakfast for Dean. Cas treaded lightly out of the room to make sure Dean stayed asleep. After quietly leaving Dean’s room, he went to make him coffee first. Sam was at the coffee machine making himself a cup of coffee and turned when he heard footsteps, smiling some at Cas, “Morning Cas, so what’d you watch last night?”
Cas sighed before slowly getting up and stretching his tired limbs out, he could audibly hear and feel the joints popping which would have sounded bad but it made him feel better. Dean gently tossed the former angel a pair of his jeans and one of his older band tees at Cas who easily caught them.
The woman moved over to the register, putting the order in and when she was done she nodded, “Okay so that will take 3 and a half weeks, We can call you when we get it in?”
Cas held back a chuckle, shaking his head some before helping Dean up, and then sitting him on a chair, Gabriel made appear. Cas carefully stroked a piece of hair from Dean’s face, he was only slightly worried still, but he was ignoring the very concerned looks from the humans around them speaking softly, “I am sorry Dean, I did not expect you to have such a reaction… this ritual has only been performed with humans before to combine souls… It was never performed with an angel before… I should have realized there would be some problems…”
Cas chewed his lip then looked away, a thought popping into his head but suddenly unsure how to tell Dean he could technically carry a Nephilim because his grace itself was genderless. Just as he opened his mouth to say something there was a sudden crash, and the lights inside their motel room were out, Dean’s head shot up, and they were both quickly back inside the motel room. Gabriel was sitting on the bed, all the lightbulbs broken, as well as the TV, and Sam giggling hysterically at the table still. Dean stared in complete confusion. “What the fuck?”
Castiel felt his heart tug painfully in his chest and he kneeled down in front of the hunter and his voice was soft, “Dean…”
So angst? I love writing angst, honestly, I do, it might make me a terrible person but whatevs. Anyways, hope you all enjoy this one. Cas is wounded on a hunt only a week after they finally admit their feelings for each other
Cas carefully moved to sit next to Dean, and then a thought popped into his head, and he softly spoke, “You know Dean, I had also been considering proposing to you, I know it is a customary human thing after being in a relationship for so long.”
Dean looked at Cas, clearly slightly confused about the name for just a moment before nodding slowly. Once they removed the tube he coughed hard, but Cas carefully helped Dean sip some water. Dean swallowed the cool water gratefully, before looking at Cas, “W… what happened?”
Cas looked at Dean confused for another minute before the words sunk in and he nodded some before a large yawn forced its way out. The former angel pulled himself closer to Dean and huffed some before burying his face in Dean’s chest, despite having the best sleep he had had since becoming human he still felt exhausted.
Unlike his human, Castiel had realized much quicker how he felt for Dean Winchester because it was easy for Castiel to know. Castiel learned early on in his life, that feeling things, feeling Human emotions was the first step to falling.
Cas looked at Dean with obvious hesitancy but despite his nerves he nodded, “Anything for you Dean,”
Dean yawned as he started to wake up and stretched his arms out sleepily, usually Cas would immediately cuddle into Dean’s open arms. Dean opened his eyes when Cas didn’t insert himself into Dean’s waiting for arms and saw Cas wasn’t there, for half a second he started to panic until he remembered that today was their wedding day. Sam and Gabriel had forced them to sleep in separate rooms to at least follow some wedding day traditions and much to Dean’s chagrin, and he wouldn’t see his angel again until he was walking down the aisle.
Panic overwhelmed Cas at the thought of Dean seeing his horrid wings. Dean looked at Cas with awe, “They are gorgeous Cas, why didn’t you ever show me them before?”
Castiel was frozen for a moment, he had certainly been expecting more anger from the man but then he moved and wrapped his arms around Dean. Castiel closed his eyes, relishing in the feelings of happiness and love radiating from Dean.
Dean groaned and arched up into Cas’ desperately, begging for release. Every single thrust made him feel like he was being wound tighter and tighter, his entire body felt hotter and ten times more sensitive in ways he could barely recognize. Suddenly Cas hit his prostate causing Dean to scream in pleasure, “CASTIEL”
Dean remembered there was a farmers market at the edge of town, and he hoped it was still open. To Dean’s luck it was free, after parking Baby in the grass he looked for a flower booth. Dean quickly spotted one and walked towards it, passing by a booth that was selling raw honey, and he made a mental note to get Cas some as well.
An hour later they were on the road to Dodge City, Gabe had tried to complain and say that he could just fly them all and the car to Dodge City but Dean had refused, not trusting Gabe enough with Baby. After the 3 hours drive, Dean found an old western looking motel, the kind with themed rooms. Dean asked for two kinds and pull out couch for Gabe.
Cas quietly listened to Dean ranting, and he smiled just a little. Dean was OCD, even if Sam didn’t see that. Yes, when it came to eating, he would just shove the food in his mouth but Cas knew that had nothing to do with him being a slob. It was the way Dean had grown up, constantly unsure when he would eat again, constantly giving the little food they had to Sam. Dean had learned growing up that if there was food in front of him, he needed to eat it because he wouldn’t know when he could eat again, and because of his tendency to always make sure Sam was fed, he had not learned that aspect. Dean had become OCD because of his need to keep things organized in his completely unorganized and unstable environments. Cas forced himself to shove those thoughts away because they made him hate John Winchester even more, and he desperately wanted to go to the man’s heaven and lecture him, try to make the man see the hell he had put his oldest son through. Although Cas was unsure what he would be capable of if he had ever come face to face with John Winchester.
Cas relaxed some and wrapped his arm around Dean, slowly rubbing his hand up and down Dean’s still naked back, “I’m not going to disappear Dean…”
Gabe sighed but nodded and touched Cas shoulder, taking them back outside the bunker since he couldn't get in on his own. Cas relaxed when he saw the door of the bunker and he knocked gently.
Dean chuckled before pulled Cas’ face to his and kissing his angel roughly for a moment before whispering, “Are you going to fuck me or not Angel?”
Dean hummed gently in agreement before replying, “Look, Gabe, I know… I know I have fucked up in the past with him, and it took me way to long to get my head out of my ass and get to this point. Cas is my everything, and I will do anything for him too. I… I will be honest I never wanted to get old, not because I didn’t think I would, but because I didn’t want to be alone the rest of my life, even with Sammy around. Cas… Cas will be by my side the whole time, and that is what matters to me,”
When Cas’ words started to become a bit to intermingled, he slowly took Cas’ hand, cutting the angel off and gently cupped his cheek, “Angel, I love you dearly. Whatever you are trying to say it doesn’t matter to me.”
Dean studied Cas for a moment before asking, “Do you want me to check Angel?” Cas eyes widened, it would be better to have someone else groom his wings, and he had already let Dean touch his wings before so it wouldn’t be that intimidating, but the intimacy of grooming his wings when they were already in a relationship would be overwhelming. Dean could see the hesitancy in Cas’ eyes and gently spoke, “Hey… if you don’t want me to, I don’t have to Angel"
Cas looked hesitant but soon nodded, “Of course Dean, though I am not sure I know where to find a trench coat…”
Dean softly hushed Cas and pulled him close again, he understood Cas’ reasoning and if the roles were reversed, he knew he would feel the same. “If you want to get your grace back I understand… where are you going to look?”
Dean swallowed around the tears because just thinking about his mom hurt, not to mention seeing Sam so small again brought up a bunch of hard memories to the forefront of his mind. Dean slowly nodded, “Yeah… after the fire… Dad… tried to sing it to Sammy once… but Sam hated it, and he cried the whole time… One time when Dad was on a hunt… he left us with a babysitter, she put us to bed and then left… Sammy had a nightmare, and I… I didn’t know what else to do to calm him down but to sing that song like mom would for me… and then after that, I had to sing it every night before bed until he was eight years old.”
Cas shook his head. “Not that,” he said. “Not quite.” He looked down at his own hands, studying them as if he might find a clearer explanation there. God, those hands. Dean swallowed hard and looked away. “At the risk of being too candid with a stranger, it surprises me, too. But I’m learning that when it comes to you, there’s little use in reaching after fact and reason.”
Castiel set about putting his things away in his office before turning off the lights in his office, plunging himself in moonlit darkness. He took a moment to adjust his eyes before he made his way to his bedroom, stripping down to his boxers, suddenly too exhausted to put on something more decent. He used the last bit of his energy to kneel beside his bed and say a quick prayer, crossing himself, before slipping into bed, pulling the sheets all the way up to his chin despite the usual heat of the summer nights.
Dean’s eyes fluttered closed as Cas’ touched his scar, the scar he had left twelve years ago. Cas had never touched it directly like this, not to his memory at least, the feeling that went through Dean as Cas’ hand met the scar was beyond words. Dean’s first thought was safety, he felt safe, unafraid of anything.
The Empty looked up at him and smiled some, the smile looking wrong even though Castiel had seen Meg smile countless times, it looked odd now on The Empty’s face, “Because I wanted to ask you a question.”
Dean smiled before leaving his room and going to the Library. For the most part, it was clean, there were a few things that had been broken after Charlie’s death but Cas had dutifully and carefully glued them back together or with Dean’s help fixed them. Dean swept and then Cas followed after him with the mop. After doing this a few times to make sure it was completely clean Dean started looking through and fixing some of the books that Sam had put back upside downs. “You know as much as Sammy calls me a slob, he really just does not pay attention when he puts these books away, I mean honestly at least half of these are upside down. How hard is it to take the 2 damn seconds to make sure they are facing the right direction”
Dean pulled away once more and started unbuttoning Cas’ pants, slowly pushing them down with his boxers as Dean kneeled in front of Castiel. Dean gently pulled Cas’ feet out of the pants and then pushed the bundle of clothes to the side, still kneeling on the ground before looking up and meeting Cas’ eyes.
The woman looked at the ring, then went around the corner and opened the display case, carefully pulling out the ring that is displayed on a single finger holder, “That would depend, what would you like to do?’
Cas felt himself stiffening, just having Dean kneeling in front of him was enough to set him off. Dean’s beautiful green eyes locked with his and Dean licked his lips, it was a quick motion that seemed to go slowly.
Now if you asked Castiel, Angel of the Lord, what being in love felt like before he pulled Dean Winchester from Hell, he would have told you that he was only capable of loving his Father, and that would be the end of the conversation.
Sam hesitated before responding, “No… I mean we just watched all these people disappear in front of us man…”
Cas hummed softly, “It’s alright Dean, I just, I want you know I’m not going anywhere. I promise. Get some rest, I will wake you when Sam and Jack return.”
The please was what broke Dean, it was soft and Cas’ eyes were filled with worry. Dean slowly nodded and sat down at the table, letting Cas get their food. Dean only ate half his dinner before the pointless chatter between Cas and Sam was too overwhelming and he suddenly got up, the chair scraping against the ground loudly and he went to his room. Cas watched Dean tossing his half-eaten food out, he wanted to follow him, to comfort him but he knew Dean needed space more than anything, but not too much or he would push Cas away completely. Sam looked at Cas before softly supplying, “You should probably go after him…”
Castiel nodded slowly, “Dean changed me… he showed me compassion, he showed me how to care about Humanity.”
Sam made a small noise, “I don’t know Dean… we have just been standing here… I’ll get back to the bunker..”
Dean finally opened his eyes at the feeling of his comforter against his back and looked up at Castiel, Dean’s eyes were indeed watery but they were both silently in agreeance to ignore them. Dean slowly cleared his throat, “Um… there is lube in my drawer and... “ Dean’s face felt hot at the sudden realization he was going to have to explain this to Cas.
Confusion hit Sam and he was a bit flustered but he could hear the anger and obvious concern in Cas voice so he quickly grabbed the keys to Baby and headed for the garage, “Not that I know of but I don’t think he has ever been stung, Why Cas what’s wrong?”
Dean yelped in surprise at the bruising grip on his wrists but he cried out, “Yes Alpha!” Dean’s eyes suddenly flew open after the word Alpha come out of his mouth. That wasn’t what he had meant to say, he wanted to say Cas’ name. Cas could see the clarity in Dean’s eyes as he brokenly asked, “W…whats wrong with me Cas…”
Cas stopped himself from smiling and in a softer appeasing tone, “Dean the more frustrated you become, the more mistakes you are making,”
Its the day after Dean and Cas had sex practically all day, and they need to clean up the kitchen. After they clean the kitchen they started to clean the rest of the bunker.
When the thundering in his ears died down and his vision cleared, Dean realized two things, and the first thing was that at some point he had collapsed to the ground. The second thing was that Cas was talking to him, “It’s okay Dean… I’ve got you now; you are alright now Honeybee, you are safe.”
Dean made a gentle humming noise before nodding and shrugging his shoulder, “I guess you are right, So I think we can go to the Library, organize some of the books and mop, I haven’t really looked at what needs to be done in there,”
Cas smiled warmly, before kissing Dean again “Thank you, Dean, I know this was all out of your comfort zone, but it was wonderful, and I will never forget tonight,”
Dean wanted to follow Cas because he knew his angel was overwhelmed, and terrified of screwing this up, so he let him be by himself for a moment. After calming the two toddlers down, he sat in front of them as they ate, “Okay guys, we need to take it easy on Cas okay? He hasn’t dealt with kids so can we try to be nice to Cas?”
Dean got up and kissed Cas deeply, then sat back down and finished his dinner and fries. After that, he ate two pieces of pie, with the ice cream, of course. Once he had finished, Dean was full, and the exhaustion kicked right back in. Cas went with Dean back to his room and slowly massaged his sore muscles, using his grace more than anything really, but it wasn’t long before Dean was out cold.
Because Castiel was an angel, Gabriel had suggested a special binding ritual, that was more binding than a regular human marriage. At first, Dean had been confused but after Castiel described it, it sounded beautiful. It bound Dean’s soul to Castiel’s grace permanently, so when Dean did finally die because unfortunately, it was inevitable. Dean’s soul would become attached to Castiel’s grace for the rest of Castiel’s life.
Castiel had been in Heaven, he had spent centuries in Heaven, but having Dean Winchester, the man he had silently loved for twelve years, kneeling at his feet with Cas’ cock in his mouth, was better.
One by one Dean was cleaning the cuts and burns. The hunter tried to work as fast as he could be he needed to make sure they were clean before he sutured them so they wouldn’t get infected. Cas’ screams of pain were muffled by the rag in his mouth and he tried to move away from the pain but Sam held him in place. Dean’s voice was gentle as he cleaned the cuts, “I know Angel, I know baby I am so sorry… just breath in and out…. Okay”
Cas didn’t argue as Dean hit the play button, and the familiar chords of Cas had been listening to started again. Dean narrowed his eyes, slightly curiously as the actual singing started. “Cas come on this guy is singing about some girl and how he sucks at one night stands? Come on…”
Cas relaxed his grip on Dean’s hands and moved one hand to cup Dean’s face gently, now his voice was softer and full of love, “The witch’s spell has put you into an angel’s heat… I would love to explain more but this moment of clarity won’t last long but I want you to understand Dean that anything I say is not meant to be insulting to you, you may find it to be so later but I am quickly losing control of my own instincts. I may even speak Enochian, and it is possible with her spell, you could understand me. You are safe Dean. I will keep you safe Dean.”
Cas took it but then promptly laid it and the flowers down on the table before pulling Dean into a long, slow kiss. Dean sighed happily into it as his angel snaked an arm around his waist. After pulling apart just enough to see Dean’s face, he spoke, “I love it all so much, Dean, you didn’t have to do all this.”
After they had eaten, and Cas finished his glass of champagne, he carefully slipped the ring to the waiter when he came to retrieve their glasses when Cas was distracted. While he had relaxed during dinner, now that the ring was finally about to be presented to Cas, his nerves kicked up all the way again.
The women looked slightly confused for only a moment before nodding and writing the phrase down, “Alright, do you want to pay now or set up a payment plan?”
Dean made a face and shook his head, his voice going up a bit as he denied it, “No way, I mean I guess it was okay, but it wasn’t that great.”
Dean smiled gently, then he started to draw. The 1st two attempts were not that great as he got back into the groove of drawing again. It took Dean 2 and half hours before he finally felt like he was finished with the drawing. He looked up meeting Cas’ eyes, “Okay… uh, I think I am done…”
Dean looks at the clock again and tries to hold back a sigh. It had been nearly two hours now since Sam and Gabriel had gone to get dinner for them all. Dean had only started to get worried half an hour ago, and he knew Sam and Gabriel could most definitely be on the side of the road somewhere having sex, not that he loved the idea of Sam and Gabe having sex in Baby. Cas was anxious at this point, and he finally spoke, “Dean… they should have returned by now,”
“She… she has essentially turned him back into a fledgling, but… not quite at the same time… it’s different… Gabriel was never a fledgling when Father created the archangels, he created them as they are… I… I cannot reverse it, however, but… from what I can sense it is temporary…” Cas spoke as he studied the young version of the archangel.
So if you asked Dean Winchester what being in love felt like now, he would tell you that being in love, was more complicated, but also more amazing then you could ever really imagine.
Cas eyebrow’s knitted together in slight confusion, he had never paid with a card before so he was slightly confused. Dean cleared his throat gently and whispered in his ear, “The card angel,”
Cas nodded, “Yes, yes he does.” Cas turned and went through the saloon looking doors Dean had just gone through and Dean now had his cowboy hat on, “This is so great isn’t it angel!”
Dean followed Cas to the kitchen, sitting at the island as he watched Cas move around the kitchen quickly. Cas started the coffee first, then made eggs and turkey bacon and toast. Despite Dean’s initial protest, or well almost temper tantrum if the angel was honest, the hunter had grown to like it.
Cas shook his head minutely, then realizing something, “That’s why she is killing them, the spell is only temporary, and she needs to harvest the energy they give off as children before the spell can wear off,”
Cas hummed gently but stayed quiet, this time the person at the register was a guy and he kept glancing at the proximity between Dean and Cas. Dean knew what the man was thinking, he had seen that look on his dad’s face before, the disgust. It made Dean feel awkward and nervous before Dean would have made a show of moving away from Cas or making a comment to Cas about it but this time he refused to because frankly, he was tired of hiding who he was anymore.
Cas looked at Dean curiously but stayed quite still. Dean went through the drive-thru and got them dinner, Cas had lost his appetite at the prospect of needing to deal with the toddlers and so when Dean asked him what he wanted to eat he just shook his head. After getting their food, they were soon back at the motel with Sam and Gabriel were happily and very messily munching on their dinners. Cas watched the two toddlers eating and couldn’t help but feel confused and slightly concerned as to how he was going to be able to care for the two toddlers over the next week. Cas had learned that humans were messy, and he had mostly accepted it, but human children, ten times dirtier Cas thought silently.
