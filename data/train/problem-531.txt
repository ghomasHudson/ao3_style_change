"Just friends, Watson.  And not close ones at that.  I assisted him with a delicate personal matter and he provided to be a critical reference early in my career.  That is not to say I believe he deserves his sentence."
We sat against the brick wall, wrapped in coats, hats pulled low over ears, mufflers pulled high over noses, and gloved fingers tucked away for warmth. I could feel the press of his body, hip to knee.
Sexual relations were an extension of romantic love and he gave freely of his body to his bed partners.  He asked for nothing more than for the love an affection he had to give to be accepted by them.  The first time he tumbled into bed with Sherlock Holmes, he realized his mistake in thinking that the man was capable of accepting his affection.  But he was a generous soul, and when Holmes indicated again and again that he needed physical release, John Watson was there to oblige.  Until one day it became too much and he simply could not say yes any longer.
Something had been on Holmes's mind all day.  Watson knew his friend well enough to understand two important things: first, that Holmes would be deeply offended if he was asked to reveal his thoughts before he was ready to share them; second, that Holmes wanted Watson to know that something was on his mind.  Experience had taught Watson patience, so he had settled in with a book before the fire in the hopes that Holmes would come round to revealing his thoughts before it grew too much later.
He stared at me through cold and considering grey eyes.  "You would stay here, in Baker Street, no matter who joined me in my bed?"
The pause went on long enough that Watson raised his head from his book and closed it, finger marking the page.
For my sake, I would need to speak to Holmes about the future of our physical relationship. I could only continue on with him in that regard if we could find a place of intimate companionship again and grow it into love.  Giving in to his seductions on other terms would only break my heart, quite possibly for the final time.  I could spend the rest of my life with him if we were nothing but friends, but I could not share my body with him unless we both were committed to each other and no other.  I needed the words spoken aloud.
I had eaten my dinner, read the evening paper, responded to my correspondence, and spent some time organizing our case notes all while he muttered, sulked, scratched at his violin, tossed papers about, and otherwise thought aloud with his whole body. The answer was absurdly simple.
"Why does it upset you, so?" I asked carefully, turning the question back on him.  Wilde's prosecution for sodomy after his failed libel case against Queensbury bothered me, true, but that was because I found the man completely astounding in his stupidity.  Holmes, however much he was dismissive of stupidity was rarely angry over it.  Especially when it had nothing to do with a client or case.
I jerked awake, images from my dream so vivid I reached out for Sherlock laying beside me to ensure they weren’t real.
We sat there a moment more before he declared himself recovered enough for a short walk and we set off for Sterndale's.
After our investigation at the Vicarage and my expedition to the village, I met Holmes back at the cottage.  I couldn't help but be excited and was heartened to see that his eyes were bright with focus.  He looked almost healthy, and I preened under his praise as we discussed the lamp and he led me to the conclusion of the case.
Holmes leaned forward and pressed his lips to Watson's. The kiss was tentative, dry, and far too brief, but sweet all the same. Watson returned the kiss with one of his own. Holmes kissed him again, and they spent an embarrassingly long time there in the kitchen beside a roast growing cold, trading gentle kisses.
Given his enthusiasm of the night before, I had half expected him to offer to join me, and was relieved that he didn't.  I was still a bit unsettled at the ease at which we had both fell back into that familiar dance.  One night did not solve years of trouble in that regard and although I did not regret our intimacy last night, I did regret not insisting we speak about it first.
By the time I made it back to the cottage I had worked up a good sweat from the sun, and I decided to be simply lazy and enjoy a mid-morning bath.  I heated and ran the water and settled into the tub.  Holmes arrived back at the cottage shortly after I had settled in and spent a few moments informing me of how he had followed Sterndale.  He stood in the doorway and let his gaze wander over my his gaze wander over my body while he spoke before leaving me to finish my bath alone.
To his surprise, Watson found a confidant and true friend in Mrs. Hudson as well. He'd attempted to explain Holmes to one of Watson's many friends at his officer's club, but had either been met by outright incredulity or skeptical disgust. He had become so sensitive to the feeling that he had to both explain and defend his friend that eventually he gave in and simply offered the same sanitized and highly edited version of his life that he provided to his agent, Doyle, when pressed to talk about his infamous companion. But he never needed to defend his exasperation to Mrs. Hudson, and they shared many chuckles over the actions of their house's third occupant.
I found myself instead rather enjoying the break from London scandals and quite fond of the doings of a Mrs. Crabetree and her apparently near-nightly dinners at the Cross residence.  Small-town gossip amused me to no end and I was quite well on my way to crafting the most ridiculous story in my head as exactly what those visits entailed.
Holmes made a noise of frustration in the back of his throat and returned his gaze to the fire.  They were both quiet for several long minutes.
We had been awoken in the middle of the night to investigate, and in the chaos of leaving he had forgotten his needle and dose.  I thought little of it, dismissing it, not appreciating how dependent he had become on the drug on a daily basis.  His mood worsened with every mile that passed on our way to Chislehurst.  He was distracted and angry and any attempt to engage him in the case left him sniping at me.  It was Hopkins's frustrated exclamation of disgust after asking Holmes for the third time if he had any questions about the alleged robbery that finally did me in.  Holmes had remained silent and distracted the whole time, leaving Hopkins and I to both prompt her ladyship for information and to provide comfort in her distress.  It wasn't like Hopkins to grow frustrated with Holmes, and with startling clarity I realized that something was very wrong, and had been for quite awhile.
"It was the groom," I breathed aloud over the sound of my pounding heart. Sherlock reached out and patted my hip beneath the warm blanket on the narrow bed we shared.
"I fear I was still trying to punish you, even after I returned and demanded you come back to me.  It wasn't fair of me, Watson.  The fact that you have not given up on me yet?  Well, it's far more than I deserve."
Domestic life with Mary had awoken something in me. I desired something more than long periods of bachelorhood punctuated by moments of overwhelming excitement.  I was content to be Holmes' friend for the rest of our lives, but I did not desire to be an occasional bed partner, no matter how enchanting I found him.
His hand raised and pressed against my cheek. I could see tears gather at the corners of his eyes.  He made a quip about madness and I smiled at him.
I did not want to pry as to how he had been friends with Wilde, but since our chat by the fire I had been wondering.  It had only recently begun to dawn on me that perhaps my companion's eschewing of the softer emotions was not quite what it seemed, but rather a lack of interest in the female sex.  For all his bohemian ways, Holmes also was not foppish, but experience had taught me that was not a reliable indicator of deviant behavior.
It was years of practice at being interrupted at whatever I was doing with demands of "now, Watson!" that allowed me to meet the Vicar at the door, nearly presentable, if still a bit damp.  Holmes's excitement at investigating an untouched room led me to believe that he had the solution already and was merely thrilled with the opportunity to confirm and prove it.  I grabbed my notebook and we headed back to the Vicarage.
Desperately not wanting to offend, he accepted and found himself once again enjoying a rather delicious roast and pudding at his landlady's large kitchen table. This time, Mrs. Hudson offered a small comment or two of her own and seemed more congenial in general if still distant and quiet overall. This time, he felt less like he was intruding.
"A little higher Watson," Holmes said with exasperation. I startled and raised the dark lantern up a bit to its original position - illuminating the lock that Holmes was busy picking.
So it was quite a shock to be roused long before dawn by the screeching and scraping of a bow across strings in a manner that was surely designed to cause the most obnoxious noise at the loudest volume possible.
I gave Holmes a narrow-eyed look.  Dr. Agar was a very old friend and I had no desire to be anything but perfectly clear with Holmes.
"John, I do hope you'll forgive me."  Holmes stopped and stared back into the fire.  After a long pause, he added, so softly Watson almost missed it, "Some day."  Holmes stared down at his hands clutching his spent pipe.
We took twice daily hikes along the bay, slow and gentle to accommodate his weakened physical condition.  He called it gloomy and I replied that it was romantic.  He quoted a tragic love story, and I told him it was beautiful. We began to find our easy rhythm once more.
I had fallen asleep to the sweet sounds of a simple waltz played so perfectly by Holmes on his violin.  I dreamed of a glittering ball, a gloved hand in mind, and a trim waist to wrap my arm around. It was a thin body that pressed up against mine and I did not mind one bit that my feet weren’t tangling in skirts, but instead stepped crisply and cleanly with polished black dress shoes that matched my own.
He grinned unrepentantly before he leaned down and gave me the shock of my life by kissing me squarely on the lips.
"You're right, but I know how much you love them. So on occasion..." Holmes trailed off with a shrug.
"You see everything, Holmes," I whispered, "How can you not see me?  The world knows that I would do anything for my friend Holmes, but you know there is absolutely nothing,
Experience had taught me to best leave him at it.  It had also taught me that my intervention would be tolerated as long as it was not intrusive.  Food would be consumed if I put bits of toast and cups of tea at his elbow and threatened to bother him at regular intervals until they were consumed.  Small meals could be tricked into him by asking leading questions about whatever the subject was and hoping he consumed at least a few bites between the rapid fire explanations and expansive hand gestures.
"Yes," he moaned.  I smiled and grasped at his lean hips, arranging him just so - he was pliant and willing.
Watson kissed him, slow and languid.  It wasn't their first kiss of the night or even their tenth -- and quite possibly not even their hundredth, if one counted the way they had pressed their mouths to each other's, roughly, messily, not a few hours earlier as their hands had brought each other release.
We fell into the routines of our younger years, the easy back and forth of case work, the late nights and whirlwind trips, the intimate friendship.  But we were no longer young men - both of us were a decade older than we were when we first met. Holmes and I had been lovers in our early years, although with the casualness of two young, attractive men.  I had other lovers, men and women, and I was aware of at least two of his, both male.  I had no idea if there were others, nor did I care to know.  We came together when it was convenient for both of us, and it meant nothing more.
"-And an apology."  He shook his head at me, his eyes wide in shock.  "It was an unjustifiable experiment.  Even for oneself, but for a friend… I really am, I really, I am, I am very sorry."
Nevertheless, I couldn't help but enjoy the gleam in his eye that was put there by a puzzle to solve and not the mania brought on by his cocaine.  "This is an exceptional case," he said, pleading.
Watson's breath caught.  He could count on one hand the number of times Holmes and called him John, first names an intimacy they had rarely shared, even in a friendship going back a decade.
"Really Watson, my sleep last night was sound and restful, what I got of it at least.  I am hardly taxed."
I took my observations down, and checked my notes against Hopkins' before I collected a pacing and distracted Holmes from the front entry.
"John, perhaps it would be best if you spent a few more nights away.  I will be able to advise you best after I have had time to consult with Mr. Holmes here and he has been through the worst of his symptoms."
So here it was, months later, and we were happily back in 221B and I was itching for a bit of rough play.  Watson was napping as I carefully donned my riding outfit and selected the riding crop.  I knelt over him and trailed it across his cheek…
I pressed my face to his, "you know that it's my greatest joy and privilege to help you."  I stroked my thumbs along his cheeks.
"Exactly right, Doctor!" he said.  He leaned forward and pressed his lips against mine.  I grinned at him in response and he squeezed my hand before sitting back and handing me the paper with the crystals of the drug he had found.  His face turned solemn and he considered them carefully.  I was unsettled at the sudden shift in mood.
London seemed sadder, diminished, for the loss of Wilde.  I went to the theater, same as always, and the music halls.  I spent time in the company of women, and even a man or two. Holmes and I settled back into our ways.  The cases came and went, and I did my best to put my thoughts about my companion firmly from my mind.  It was for the best, I assured myself, even as I found myself more and more drawn to him.
A dog barked outside, the sound dampened by the snow.  It was otherwise quiet and peaceful, snow muffling sounds of a city that never really slept.   Watson shifted again, his toes scraping against Holmes's leg.  Holmes twitched but resettled a little more snugly against Watson.
Holmes looked a little unsure, "Well, I am sure that some mornings I may not be able to, as I cannot predict what cases--"
The private carriage was courtesy Mycroft and the swathes of bandages and blankets insured our relative anonymity as we returned to London. Holmes had not regained true consciousness since I had found him splayed out on the rocks at the foot of the falls. I was a doctor and I knew what this meant - a brain injury of this scale. I could only hope that he would be one of the miracle cases, but the Sherlock Holmes as we knew him was dead.
It was only a little at first, but quickly grew out of control.  I knew we had reached the point where something must be done when Holmes nearly bungled a case so badly that we would have left the victim to possibly hang for the crime.
I folded his hand around cups and encouraged him to drink. I read to him, endlessly, and wrote furiously by his side. But he seemed not to know me from anyone else.
"I'm a bohemian, you see," he said, as if that explained it all.  It didn't, but I had learned to be patient when it came to the morsels of personal information that Holmes doled out to me.  "His prosecution of Queensbury was ill-advised, we all told him so.  And now the inevitable will occur."
Everything was silent for a moment except the soft scrape of his tools in the lock and I shook my head hard in an effort to stay awake.
"Then to what end, Watson?  The man is going to gaol for his own selfishness.  His own inability to control himself.  His flights of fancy, his indiscreetness, and his absolutely moronic prosecution of Queensbury.  Over who?  Douglas?  That twit."
"I have done it!" he said, shaking me by the shoulders, face inches from mine.  "Colonel Brixton is a liar and a thief and I have the means to prove it! We shall eat well tonight!"
It was all quite by accident. Initially, at least. We had been invited up to a hunting and shooting party in the countryside by an old friend of Watson’s. Normally I declined to accompany Watson on these little outings, preferring to stay in London of course. But this time I had accepted. The new aspect of our relationship meant I was disinclined to spend a week apart from him, especially when he would be spending it in the company of hale and healthy sporting men.
Holmes looked down at his lap and then returned his gaze to the fire, unable to maintain Watson's look.  Watson's heart seized in his chest. Was he understanding Holmes correctly - did he mean for the apology to be a request for Watson to try to love him again? For Holmes, he was as good as flaying himself alive in front of Watson, begging to be understood and accepted.  A decade had given Watson the grace, strength, and understanding to know what to do next.  He had never stopped loving him.
It had been nearly six years since Sherlock Holmes had returned from the dead.  In order to rebuild their friendship, they had cultivated a careful distance between the two of them.  At first, Watson's lingering hurt, anger, and betrayal had made that distance necessary.  But in the last year, that distance had begun to lesson and Watson had learned how to be gentle and careful expressing his love.  There was a hand pressed in thanks, a soft smile, a tap on the wrist to catch one's attention, and even, very occasionally, a clasp of a shoulder to say goodnight.
We let the moment that had passed between us that night be and carried on as usual the next morning.
So after Holmes returned, when I wrote to her that I was selling my practice and returning to Baker Street, Mary expressed no surprise.
"I will take you any way I can have you, but I will not do so if it means you continue to abuse your body in that way."  I nodded to his needle, empty of his morning dose already and left out in readiness for another one.  "You must be done with cocaine, once and for all."  I rose from the table and left Baker Street for the day.
I awoke to a gentle shake of my shoulder and a warm smile as he nodded at the docks signaling it was time.
Over the next few hours I was treated to a torturous assault on my mind as well as my body.  Holmes applied himself wholeheartedly to his efforts and I was not disappointed.  He sent his long fingers dancing against my skin and caught my eyes offering me smiles that could only be described as sultry.  He engaged me, laughed at my jokes, humored my storytelling, and teased me about our cases. By the time supper was over I was undone.  I was able to slow him long enough to set a fire in the bedroom. The storm pounding against the windows seemed to complement his determined, wild mood.
In my dreams we had danced all night under glittering lights, sipped champagne, and fumbled for each other in darkened corners, mouths hot and hands needy.  It could not have been more perfect.
As we returned from the morning walk, we were greeted at the door of our cottage by two no-longer taciturn Cornishmen. Holmes brightened and demanded details over my strenuous objections and despite the lingering deep cough that was plaguing his body.
He looked shocked for a brief moment.  I wondered if I had perhaps not been as easy to read as I had always thought I was.
He stood and set about arranging the room in precaution of the drug's effect.  His lips were pressed tight and his eyes pinched with concern.
In fact, I was a bit chagrined to admit that this even applied to myself.  At various times in my life, I enjoyed intimacy with men when women were not available.  Yet because I was not a Nancy, I dismissed these as simply needing urges satisfied.  Men needed not be nancies to be inverts, or even inverts to enjoy relations with other men and believing that it was only these men who did was dangerously close to theorizing ahead of the facts.
"Yes, I heard," I said dryly.  "I couldn’t help but hear.  I quite frankly had no choice in the matter."
When I returned to Baker Street the day after that, Holmes and Dr. Agar were seated in the sitting room together.
It didn't mean the same thing, surely it couldn't mean the same thing. He looked up at Holmes, terrified his heart would break right there, over a Sunday roast. Holmes smiled at him, one of his rare shy grins, and he shrugged, cheeks turning pink.
When Sherlock Holmes found his mind occupied by one of his little “brain puzzles” as he referred to them (I thought of them as “armchair cases” since he rarely left his armchair to solve them) there was often room for little else - sleeping, eating, etc.
"No, Watson.  No one wanted this case and only Wilde seemed to be surprised that it happened at all.  It had simply gone too far after the Queensbury trial to not proceed.  But as you said, a conviction for sodomy is inevitable but this was prosecution was not brought by zealots bent on punishing those for private matters."
"Really, Doctor?" he responded with a quick brush of his hand and the expression he gets when he's waiting for me to catch up.
Holmes was fully absorbed by his researches into early English charters, and yet was surprisingly companionable,always finding time for a late supper with me and a few minutes by the fire for a chat before bed.
Three pipes later, Watson was very nearly ready to throw open a window, freezing air be damned.  His patience was nearly as absent as breathable air in their sitting room.
Then, I understood with startling clarity - he meant to take the drugs himself.  After everything.  But I could see no way out, not when I thought about it.
"It won't be Sunday roasts if you don't want them. I know you do not care for them," Watson said, reaching for Holmes's hand. He caught it and pressed his fingers to his lips.
After solving the Tregennis murders, Holmes spent the rest of his holiday immersed in the study of Chaldean roots of the Cornish branch of the Celtic language.  I spent mine distracting him as often as possible from it.  At one rather memorable point, I had promised him that I would consider his finishing the manuscript an abject failure to perform my duties as a newly committed partner and that I would do everything in my power to ensure it didn't happen.  I had been quite creative in my distractions.  And very successful.  His manuscript remained unfinished.
"I almost cannot believe that you would still be willing, after all we have been through, to try yet again to love me, but thank goodness for that goddamned heart of yours."
"It is. As I was saying, I am off to fight crime for the next fortnight, do not expect me for supper."
However, two weeks later Holmes had disappeared again for the afternoon about the time tea was to be served. Mrs. Hudson knocked on the sitting room door and entered at Watson's call. She did not carry a laden tray of food as Watson was expecting, but instead folded her hands carefully in front of her waist and invited him to eat downstairs if he wished.
I let the conversation die at that point my thoughts in too much turmoil to continue.  I was sure Holmes could seem the plain as they ever were to him, but for me, I needed more time to sort through it all.
A few days passed, and the subject appeared to be well and dropped.  The newspaper tucked under our breakfast every morning at our furnished lodgings was decidedly less enthusiastic in its reporting of the hung jury of Regina v. Wilde.  The report of Wilde's speech was sterile at best, but the eloquence of the words still rang through.  But I knew the issued had become too politicized and another trial was inevitable at this point.
Watson had long since made his peace with the fact that he had fallen in love with a man incapable of loving him in return. Oh, he was quite aware that Holmes loved him, but they loved each other differently. Watson never felt as if anything were missing. He had Mrs. Hudson and he had Sherlock Holmes and that was enough for him. He did not share his bed with anyone, but the warmth of the kitchen table, the sitting room at 221B, and in the kitchen garden of a seaside cottage in the South Downs, he had found his family. He asked if Holmes might be willing to take on a lodger here in this cottage. Part time at first, but after a year or so, perhaps permanently. Holmes lit up in a way Watson was unsure if he'd ever seen before and agreed readily, nearly tripping over his words as he did so.
Then one morning I awoke, a sore neck, stiff shoulder, and aching leg to the soft whisper of, “Watson?”
"Holmes!" I exclaimed.  "Was none of that suspicious to you?  Nothing, from the broken glass, to the beeswing, to the bell pull?"
"No you hold still!" I lept up as soon as the third arrow hit, distressingly close to where my feet were curled against the armrest.
That sunny summer Sunday afternoon was the second supper in what became a tradition for the two of them. At first, their conversation was practically non-existent before it grew polite but stilted. But Watson's naturally easygoing personality and Mrs. Hudson's no-nonsense but practical sensibility found a balance and by the following summer, Watson considered Mrs. Hudson amongst his friends. He suspected that in addition to be a fairly quiet and reserved woman, Mrs. Hudson kept to herself for propriety's sake as well. There was no Mr. Hudson at 221 and Watson had no inclination to ask - although he was quite sure Holmes had long since deduced the information and Mrs. Hudson had a ready answer whether it was true or not. An independent woman of means was a target for the less scrupulous, and even those who meant well but had no respect for someone valuing their independence and freedom. Watson certainly had grown to understand the challenges such women faced in the world even from those that they called friends - plenty had darkened the doorway of 221B and shared their tales of struggle and strife with Holmes while asking for his help.
Their friendship survived, for a time, but when one literally overflows with love, one has to find a place to put it, and so John Watson did.  It broke both of them, but Watson had someone to comfort him. Holmes did not, and so he did what he thought was best and left his friend in peace.
This was the thing about Holmes, what made him so clever.  My stories always seemed to imply that his was a natural cleverness and a sort of clairvoyance that fueled his deductive reasoning and crime solving skills.  And it was, but the man was like a dog with a bone when a subject interested him -- nothing could tear him away from learning absolutely everything there was to know about it.  To the point where his own health was sorely neglected.
The kitchen in Holmes's cottage was always well stocked when he came for a visit. A woman came from the village three days a week to cook and clean for Holmes, but when he was on his own, all he ever seemed capable of preparing was toast and tea. It didn't take long before Watson found himself one evening gathering the ingredients together to make them both a simple dish of baked fish and garden vegetables. Although not much of a baker, he managed a simple shortbread biscuit and they ate far too many of them after dinner, drizzled with honey from Holmes's hives.
During one of our ambling walks returning from tea with the local vicar, he set his arm in mine as we walked.  At first, I suspected nothing, as it wasn't unusual for him to take my arm from time to time.  But when his long fingers wrapped around my forearm and squeezed with meaning, I glanced at him from the corner of my eye.  He smirked.
"WATSON!" I startled awake and fell off the sofa onto the floor at the sound of Holmes’s shout and loud bang of the sitting room door flying open and hitting the wall. I found myself trying to calm my racing heart as the world’s only consulting detective strode across the room in a flurry of movement, tossing his hat in the general direction of the hat stand and his coat at the table before he quite literally pounced on me.
"What the devil do you think you’re doing!" I shouted at the madman shooting arrows at me, indoors of all places.
"I'm not disputing that.  I'm just saying his inevitable imprisonment is a waste.  The man is a genius and that genius will likely be broken under two years hard labor."
He slipped off the sofa and kneeled at Holmes's feet.  He placed his hands over Holmes's twisting restless fingers and stilled them.
"You stopped snoring," I responded as I pulled the paper out of his hands and arranged myself over him.  He blinked at me sleepily.
I barely had time to pack for an indeterminate amount of time before we were out the door for the 12:05.  Once again, I thanked my years of service for Her Majesty in the Army to make me so prepared to mobilize at a moment's notice.  I lifted Holme's valise onto the rack and grunted at the effort it took.
The decision to spend the spring in London had been made after a very tiresome winter trapped indoors with Holmes and his habits.  The first month apart, I believe we both enjoyed our distance.  The second, he answered my letters with telegrams and hastily scribbled notes that were letters in name only.  The third month began with a sure sign that the silly man missed me.
"Mmm, perhaps not the common ones, but the rich will be bored and trapped in their houses and growing weary of each other."
He lay there in the mid-morning sun on the sofa, stretched out, newspaper still in his hands, snoring softly.  My Watson had grown lazy and domestic in his middle-age and he was charming, simply charming like this.  I paused in my experiment, pulled my lab book closer to me, and picked up my pencil nub.
He laughed at me, and the last few months became all for naught.  I blushed and looked down at my breakfast only to glance up at him and see a fond and indulgent smile on his face.  He quickly hid it, but we both knew I had seen it.
"With the window and door open we should have ample warning," he said, waving away my concerns.  I crossed my arms in determination as I took my indicated seat and affirmed my readiness.
We settled him in my home in Kensington - a sunny bedroom at the front of the house - and I began my vigil. My practice suffered greatly for the time I spent by his side. But I didn’t care for anything but my patient.
Holmes hummed in response and studied his evening brandy with far more attention than it deserved. I held my breath, afraid of upsetting the careful balance of the moment.
I had learned long ago his words of affection were in a different language entirely.  It was that case, that one in particular, that had changed everything for us.
"It was just a spot of harmless archery," he gasped as he struggled up the stairs towards my bedroom.  The bastard was laughing.
It was two days after Christmas and the new year and new century was nearly upon them.  Christmas had been a quiet affair.  Gifts had been given to Mrs. Hudson and the maid, Molly.  Holmes had dolled out sixpence to his Irregulars and Boxing Day envelopes to the various tradesmen who regularly made deliveries of goods and intelligence to Baker Street.  Mycroft had even called round to deliver a gift to his brother.
"Oh!  Watson, you’re awake!" Holmes said, ceasing the noise at once and leaning forward.  The violin dangled from his fingertips. His face was angular and his eyes sparkled in the wane light spilling in through my window.
I smiled fondly at his dark look.  He shook his finger at me for good measure, but I refrained from laughing because I wasn't entirely sure he wouldn't follow through on his threat.  He would tolerate a great deal from me, but not anything.
A few days later, after the little puzzle of the three students and the exam, we sat down to breakfast. Holmes was positively buzzing with cheerfulness.  A solved case would do that for him.  Especially one that relied solely on his cleverness, worked out so neatly for all involved in the end, and granted him an audience of more than his Boswell for the solution.  I could not help but delighted and found myself utterly charmed by him and unable to suppress my delight.
"Well," I said, breaking the heavy moment, and turning back down the lane, "I must say, I can't wait to get you back home to enjoy the rest of what comes after vows like that."
"Might as well eat here," she said, setting the plate down at the table. He dragged the stool across the floor and carefully perched on it. "I'm not carrying all this up there only to have to carry it all back down again. I gave my girl the afternoon off."
Although Holmes was certainly the Great Deductionist - he also could be remarkably dense at times when it came to the simplest affairs.  Especially those involving jilted lovers, jealous brothers, or thieving maids. He shook me awake last night after sitting beside me for hours, rambling all the while, still fully dressed, as I slumbered the night away and finally said, “it’s the footman.”
Watson grinned at him, smile lighting up the room, bright as a summer's day, and then he tugged at Holmes's hand and pulled them both back towards Holmes's bedroom.
The next day, I received a telegram asking me to make arrangements for a two-week rest cure at a remote location not tied to any of Holmes's cases.  Remembering the posters that had grabbed my attention on the platform not that long ago, I purchased tickets immediately for Poldhu on the Cornish coast.  The bay was remote and wild and the town sleepy and simple.  No case to distract him, just a chance to rest and for both of us to decide on our future.
I slipped back in just after midnight and slunk past the sitting room where Holmes was still up and straight to my room.  The next morning, I returned to the sitting room and settled into my chair in my dressing gown and slippers and attempted to distract myself from distracting my companion.
Apparently I was not being subtle and after being a bit overzealous over the consumption of a few bites of Mrs. Hudson's fine roast I was banished.   "Distracting, annoying, and about to get himself killed if he interrupts me one more time," was what was shouted at me as he all but shoved me out the door.
It became their habit to take a full Sunday dinner, lovingly prepared by Watson with as much food directly from their garden as possible every week. Holmes would eat sparingly even during their happiest times, but on Sundays, they sat down together at the kitchen table, read the newspaper or their correspondence and took in a full meal. Watson limited his roasts to those provided by the pub in town.
The return of others to his bed, in this case the frustratingly likeable and competent Stanley Hopkins, broke my heart, but I bore it.
Watson dropped his bag and rested his shoulder against the doorway, floored by the gesture. He hadn't thought Holmes had noticed, or had noticed that he had noticed, or had even cared one whit about food except when Watson pressed it upon him.
I quelled him with a look of my own, stern and serious.  He just chuckled at me and tapped his long fingers against his lips. He considered my body up and down as he might a client fresh in our sitting room in Baker Street.  Apparently he believed I merely needed convincing.  The man, damn him, was not wrong.  His particular sort of seduction had always been my undoing, time and time again.
At first I had such high hopes for Holmes.  In the past, he had stopped or curtailed his habit for extended periods, but that time it was mere weeks before he relapsed into use again.
Holmes caught my eye and smiled, but I was troubled.  It was not like him to forget such a detail in the least.  I was distracted by it and frowned at him.  He turned away and headed out the door.
I spent plenty of time fretting that perhaps I had something to do with it, until an enquiry for Captain Basil appeared and  set my mind at ease.  I couldn't help the absolutely delighted grin that broke across my face when he appeared with that barbed-headed spear in our sitting room.
He met me at the door of our little cottage, so similar to the one we had shared in Cornwall.  His expression was bright with a mixture of delight and outrage at my little provocation.  I didn't even have time to set down my case and take off my coat before he was on me.
I took his arm and led him home and straight up our seventeen steps into the sitting room where I locked the door and pressed him against it, hands firmly wrapped around his upper arms.
Holmes sighed, as if his words were the clues to a puzzle Watson was failing to grasp.  "Yes, I did not understand what-- no,
I had attempted, after our marriage, to be a doting husband. Our relationship had been tender and loving, but it had taken me awhile before I realized that was not what Mary had wanted.  Mary's heart belong to another as much as mine did.  We could not divorce, but I assured her she would not find any objection from me if she wished to start over somewhere else.  I only made her promise that she would let me know she was well and happy.
"Oh for god's sake, John, if you sigh one more time I will not be held responsible for what happens next."
I looked forward to him seeing it, eventually.  He would read his favorite bits of my stories aloud, in a dramatic voice with expansive gestures and exaggerated expressions and I would attempt not to laugh.  Then he would take me to bed and thoroughly ravish me.  It was a game we had played for years to both of our delight.
"You can't think because of the abuse you inflict upon your body. You are sick because of what you are doing to yourself. Cocaine will only make it worse."
Watson dipped his head and brushed his nose against Holmes's.  Holmes followed the movement and answered by brushing his lips against Watson's, dry, soft, and warm.
5. Has a delightful splash of freckles on his shoulders that I love to kiss, but are currently hidden by a shirt and house coat
The clatter of a speeding carriage broke my reverie.  I sat up and looked out the window, shocked to see a two-in-hand careening nearly out of control.  I lept from my bath, grabbing for my robe and bellowing for Holmes.
I needed a moment to think.  The day had been warm, but it was cooling and I set about closing the windows and arranging a fire in the grate.  But I knew we would end up in bed together, it was merely an issue of how long I would torture us both by resisting.
"I want a life, with you, with or without the cases.  But I am not willing to pay the price of your cocaine habit in order to have it."
I awoke to the sounds of someone rummaging in my wardrobe. I blinked and rubbed my eyes to clear them of sleep as I sat up and could make out the shape of Holmes half-buried in there.
The only damper on the mood was the papers proclaiming the news that Wilde's third trial had begun.  I read it with a sort of detached interest, still troubled by the whole business.
I let it be until we were back in the small front room of our cottage. He crowded me against the door as he slipped his coat off, his intentions more than clear.
Early in our association I would attempt to engage and respond to him, but I soon realized that he did not actually need me to respond, but rather would just as soon address his comments to his bedpost. Which suited me just fine - I was happy to serve as his bedpost.
"He won't flee, you know.  The idiot doesn't know if he's doing it for love, pride, or ennui, but regardless he won't flee," Holmes said before shoving a piece of toast in his mouth.
"Did you finish your manuscript?" I asked, tearing my mouth away from his.  He chased it back down, fingers twisting in my shirtfront.
Then, one Sunday, he arrived on the afternoon train. Holmes did not meet him at the station, but Watson walked the easy two miles to the cottage and let himself in the back door. The sight of a large roast complete with vegetables and potatoes and simply drowning in rich fragrant gravy arrested him in the doorway.
I doubt I was fooling either one of us, but bless the man, he did nothing to torment me further.  In fact, it was just the same as it ever was.
It would be a new year in a few short days.  It was a time of celebration, rebirth, and hope for the future.
Once again there was a report on Wilde and I found myself growing a bit tense as I read the report.  It was sensational, and designed to both titlate and entertain and I found myself soon annoyed.
I was trying to be quiet, honestly I was. Watson had retired hours ago and I knew that after the exhausting day he had he would be fast asleep in his bed. But the results of adding the two solutions together was…
I felt the terror wash over me, then despair and pain like I hadn't felt since the fever in India.  Holmes's insane laughter broke through my terror and despair and I lept for him, wrenching my fingers open against the pain and then closed around his arms.  Every instinct in my body screamed against me, but the sight of Holmes's face face rigid in fear and pain overrode everything and I dragged his body stiff and resisting as I fought my own mind and body every step of the way to the door.  I held in the overwhelming desire to scream out every hurt, imagined and real, until I was dead, and dragged us both, step by excruciating step out of the house.  My mind had no idea what was real and what wasn't, one moment I was in India, bullets flying, heat oppressive, blood everywhere, the next I was struggling down an unending hallway to a door I felt like I would never reach, then I was back in the bowels of the hospital ship on my way to London, out of my mind with typhoid, then back again.  My only constant was the feel of Holmes in my arms and the unwavering determination to get out of this hell we were both trapped in.
A few days later, Wilde was on his way to Pentonville by way of Newgate, Holmes had finished his research, and we were on our way back to London by way of the express.  I found myself considering my partner.  His manner had always intrigued me, drawn me in, and kept me fascinated. I had always thought my attraction to his mind, but was beginning to understand it was not just his mind I had been attracted to.
I sat up, gasping, crying, shaking. The sounds and smells of Maiwand were fading, being replaced with the familiar comfort of freshly laundered bedsheets, coal embers glowing red, and the faintest lingering hint of sex.
They lay together now, in the dark quiet of the snowy Christmas season night, shifting and tangling together, sharing, taking, and giving of their bodies and more with each other.  Watson was content to simply share in what Holmes was offering.  It struck him then, that he was no hedonist and that Holmes was no ascetic.  Rather, they were two very different people who had spent far too long not being able to understand each other despite desiring the very same thing: to love and be loved in return.
"Do you know what you are asking?" Watson whispered to Holmes, looking up at him with an open expression.
It had become John Watson's habit to take Sunday dinner at the large table that dominated Mrs. Hudson's kitchen at the back of the ground floor of 221 Baker Street. The first time he had done so was a few months after he'd moved in to 221B. She had failed to deliver tea at her usual hour to the sitting room and so he had worked up the courage to descend the seventeen steps to investigate as to why she had failed to appear when expected. He'd stammered apologies before haltingly asking when tea might be served after she answered his knock, clearly surprised and curious to see him.
"He'll be convicted and they'll sentence him."  There was really no other outcome possible at this point and everyone knew it.
Holmes had worked some rather delicate cases.  I remembered the first time he had included me on a case that involved a pair of male lovers.  They had come to him for assistance in a family matter and he had provided it without so much as raising an eyebrow.  Holmes had worked hard at leaving me out of it, but it was a rather complicated matter that involved my pistol at one point and he had taken me into his, and his clients' confidence.
He grumped, but I could see the smile creeping around the corners of his mouth.  I felt strangely cheered to be on a train heading out of London with Holmes who, while clearly distracted, was in a marvelous mood.  I smirked at him and settled in with my newspaper.
I found myself at loose ends in the spring of 1895 and knew that my boredom was driving my friend and fellow lodger absolutely batty.  Holmes had already sent me away once, but the wet and dreary countryside was no better than wet and dreary London, so I returned before I upset a friend less likely to forgive me than Holmes was.  Something had caught Holmes' attention, and I watched him fall into one of his typical obsessive moods as every waking hour was consumed by whatever little problem he was researching.
Holmes stepped out of the shadows dressed head to toe in all black, a white ‘H’ stitched onto the mask-and-cowell’s headpiece.  He hefted a shield.
Holmes huffed out a breath, his amusement clear.  Watson smiled despite the fact that Holmes's eyes had never opened and he wouldn't see it.
We had arranged for the release of young Neligan after Holmes utterly dazzled young Hopkins with his deductions.  I couldn't help but admire the way Holmes enjoyed revealing the solution to the case to the young inspector.  After he had left Hopkins with a promise to help on future cases if needed, we headed back to Baker Street, arm and arm despite the heat.
"I have always known your heart to be overly generous, Watson," he began.  "But I never thought myself worthy of it."  He held up his hand to forestall my protest.
3. Prefers the house slippers I bought him three years ago to the pair Mrs. Hudson bought him for Christmas
I had cared little for what living arrangements the men had and reminded Holmes that I had seen far worse crimes than buggery in the Army: if buggery was the worst of men's depravities, we'd all be better off.  He had seemed satisfied with my sensitivities, and thereafter included me on other such cases where clients required additional levels of discretion.  It never crossed my mind to wonder as to why these clients felt comfortable trusting such personal information to Holmes.
"Yes, I cannot continue to sit in this room with your sighs and the noise of you reading that damned newspaper.  Perhaps you'll be less annoying away from London.  If I'm going to be forced to bear your presence I refuse to do so in this sitting room for even a moment longer."
"Did Reichenbach teach you nothing?" I asked.  My devotion had been more than proven during those three years.  "You see everything-"
He learned, about a year later, that Holmes would resort to eating a roast, but only when it was pressed upon him by a very desperate and concerned Watson, it was the only thing the small Yorkshire inn they were lodging at was serving that day, and Holmes had not eaten in three whole days while chasing down a horse thief. The next morning, when they were presented with the cold congealed leftovers of the previous night's dinner and Watson took in Holmes' look of disgust, Watson begged pickled egg and toast off the innkeeper. Even Watson had a difficult time eating that particular roast.
I glared at him. “Also, the whole ‘quick and dirty bond’ thing.” I glared between them and sighed. “The rational part of me says I should drop out of it and get you to time and space to figure out your own shit. I mean, you’ve only known me for like… a day. I shouldn’t be in this yet, if at all.”
I cleared a low stone wall and staggered as I landed. Something big had just swept through, heading for the town.
<I have an idea on that. I need to Awaken Potentials, that’s not negotiable, but why not let them think that you’re controlling me somehow? You mentioned a leash earlier, and I didn’t get the impression that Acton thinks wolves are very smart, so…>
Holmes turned to look back at the Hall. He could see Fox leaning on the window frame, waving. “I suppose he does have a point, John.”
<So, I have a proposal for the Crown, to be expedited with your help. I am the only wolfwalker in the world right now.>
He bustled into the morning room behind a messenger, one of the young men he’d seen the day before hanging about the forge.
He was kneeling on the ground of the clearing, speaking softly to the faun. The faun seemed relaxed. That was good. Fauns were skittish, usually. A faun sticking around to talk to someone spoke well of their character.
I waited until nightfall, when I could only scent the priest in the small cottage behind the church. There were more elementals hanging around the church grounds than I expected. Most of the supernatural avoided religious places like churches. It did speak well for Father Simeon, however.
The salamander climbed one of the larger branches, trailing fire as it studied me. <How much longer can you run, Hunter?>
He could feel the blood drain from his face. He dropped his stick and bag in the hall, tossing his hat behind him as he rushed into the parlor.
I laughed. “Not until he’s on the other side of puberty, at least. Hormonal teens are bad enough without letting them become wolves. But yeah. Davy’s a Potential.” I rolled back and looked up at Holmes. “Actually, almost everyone in Hewe-Upon-Arun is. Father Simeon isn’t, the blacksmith isn’t. Your butler isn’t. You aren’t.”
Holmes drew Mycroft’s attention away from the bowl, gesturing silently to the number of creatures crowding into the room. He could recognize fauns, and salamanders, but others seemed unknown to him.
“I suppose this is you repaying me for years of the cocaine, isn’t it?” he asked, pouring a cup of tea and adding cream to Watson’s liking.
“I highly doubt that. Those abominations are impossible to kill,” Lord Acton snarled, unable to tear his eyes away.
Mary barked a bitter laugh. “I need you. I need you to stay here, with me. To tend your patients and come home to me. But you couldn’t do that, could you?” She shot him a tear-filled look over her shoulder.
Since they all were Potentials, I’d wager they had some inkling of what was going wrong in the area. Potentials were like that.
Of course, there were other ways to gain power, if they weren’t hitting up elementals. There were dozens of rather nasty rituals one could use, if one wasn’t particularly picky. Drugs, rape, torture, murder, all these and more were ways of gathering power for the unethical mage. As with most things, these same rituals could be used ethically. Consent was the big factor. You could get the same amount of power with a willing bedmate as from a rape victim, but that detail managed to get suppressed. Thank the Church for that one. And very few people would look at the rituals and think to try them with a willing partner.
There was a pack of kids waiting at the gate as I left the church. They straightened up as I approached, and I slowed, studying them as they studied me.
She looked surprised. It didn’t smell feigned. “Really? Well, good luck, wherever your travels take you next, Fox.”
The excitement in the faun’s voice was almost palpable. I flicked an ear. Elementals were usually happy when a wolfwalker passed through, but never before had I heard one this… frantic.
He caught Holmes studying him from out of the corner of his eye. “There’s a telegram at the post office,” he said mildly.
I looked up as the door opened, not really paying attention. Two men were standing by the door, studying the room. Both were well-dressed, and drop-dead gorgeous. The man in the lead was tall and lean, easily six and a half feet tall, with a strong jaw and aquiline nose, and cheekbones for days. His companion was a bit shorter, probably just under six feet, with a very impressive mustache adorning a round face. I could feel some ignored part of my psyche sitting to attention, whispering “Mine”. Honestly, I don’t know which it was talking about. I’d be happy to stare at either.
Holmes waved his hand, pipe trailing feathers of smoke. “She realized she wanted something else. I did tell you I couldn’t congratulate you. In my experience, women are as stable as quicksand.” He drew from his pipe, face softening. “I contacted Mycroft. He’ll complain, but he’ll set everything into motion, to allow you two to sever the marriage without dragging it through the papers.”
I pulled out the top item. There was enough fabric to make a tent. I shook it out, confused. It quickly came into shape. A skirt. I raised an eyebrow at that. It was massive. I threw it over one shoulder and continued rooting through the pile.
I cleared out a small spot on one end of my hollow and lay a small fire. Once it lit, I pulled out the first volume of Holmes stories. I started reading the earlier ones, mostly because they were simple, familiar, and comforting. A salamander joined me, keeping the flames in check. I waved an absentminded greeting, but it didn’t seem to mind. The faun joined me, curling up next to me.
Lord Acton flashed a grin, briefly looking half his age. “Go home, Doctor. See to your wife. I don’t believe this is going to amount to anything, but warning must be given.”
I continued on, tracing a spiral toward the small cottage. There were others caught in the mage’s traps, and so long as they remained, he would have their strength. I found the Roc first. It’s difficult to overlook a Roc. They’re huge. It glared at me as I approached, but remained silent. I cocked my head at it, meeting its insane gaze. Yeah. It was going to attack as soon as it was free.
I headed down the hall, dropping the pack just inside the door of a small, neatly kept room. It should have felt cramped, but instead felt cozy. There was a massive bed dominating the room, and every available stretch of wall was taken up by bookcases, with a large wardrobe in one corner. A window overlooked the garden, and I was pleased to note that it was large enough I could use it as an exit, if I truly needed to.
Watson barked orders at the staff, uncaring of how it sounded, while Mycroft kept Lord Acton in line. Watson caught Holmes’s eye as  he poured water into the bowl.
“I see,” he said, dryly. “Bring Dr. Watson some tea, I’ll have the letters ready to go out by the time you finish.”
I shrugged. “Little bit of business, little bit of pleasure.” I took a drink of a very nice beer offered with lunch. “I had… something of a falling out with my family. It seemed easier to be elsewhere for a time.”
I was right. The troll was struggling against the bonds, and apparently had been for some time. The downside of elementals is that they don’t tire out. Not like mortal creatures.
The swaying grew more pronounced, before the head dropped once more. Holmes watched, stomach in knots, when he saw the large dagger embedded in Fox’s shoulder. Watson leaned in, studying the dagger.
I planned to grab some food and return to the south, see if I could narrow it down any further, when Father Simeon stopped me.
I nodded in thanks, filing that away. I would need to explore at night, but honestly, I was just exhausted. This was probably the first time I could really let my guard down since the banishment. Plus, I would have a real bed. God, it had been, what… nearly seven years on the road? With damn few comfortable hotels along the way. The cheap ones, who would take cash and not ask too many questions, tended to not be very nice.
There were voices above me, but I couldn’t understand them. Then there were warm hands on me, and I closed my eyes.
I shoved my racing thoughts aside. I could freak out later. The sylph was right. I sent my senses out, stiffening as they brushed against shields.
I snorted. “Or you’ll realize that your people have been feeding you lies and you’ll wind up helping me. This might come as a shock, Doctor, but we aren’t actually on opposite sides. I don’t know what’s building power out here, but I will stop it. You’re welcome to help me or not, but please know, I will not hesitate to go through you to stop it, if it will protect the people here.”
He could feel Holmes’s gaze on his back, but he ignored it for now. However, he couldn’t quite suppress the flash of satisfaction when he inhaled sharply at the sight of the salamander.
“Alright.” I took a breath, gathering my thoughts. “There are other worlds. The technical term is parallel universes, but that’s not really important. I’m from a different world. It was 2010, and the pair of you were- well, that’s not really important.”
Holmes raised his walking stick, gesturing ahead. “And here is the Laughing Deer Pub, home of some of the best food and drink you’ll find in Sussex.”
“I don’t think I like where this is heading…” Watson said. I could feel him reach for my hand, and I took it, grateful.
After breakfast, I headed out to the town. It would feel different walking through it as a human than it would observing it as a wolf. It felt… comfy. Homey. There was a general feeling of goodwill over the whole town. But there was something…. The barest hint of a shadow, just on the edges of the town. Whoever planted it was careful,oh so very careful, and patient, to boot, but they would leave some trace, eventually.
“When you’re sending food, send up the burned tome that what’s-his-name was using. I want to see it.”
<In the interest of full disclosure, I personally could not swear an oath to place British interests above my duty. My duty is to protect humanity, all of humanity. I can not, will not, be stopped by an arbitrary border. I will eventually be forming packs in every country. If I have the support of the Crown, I will start with British packs, and those countries deemed allies, and I will provide warning before I awaken packs in ‘enemy’ countries, but those will be happening regardless.>
I laughed. I couldn’t help it. Sherlock Holmes, the most famous fictional character in the world, was real, and staring at me across a crowded pub. And this puppy thought he was interested in me. It was probably just the hair, honestly.
<Rules on my end, too, but at this point, I think its better to break them. Nice to see you agree with that. Get the window, would you?>
But the people seemed happy to see me, and the kids were being kids. I forced myself to relax a bit.
It’s the nature of wolfwalkers to protect humanity and elementals. We’re the balance. We keep the balance. True, oftentimes we keep it through blood, but we are necessary. I could no more refuse the Unicorn’s request than the sun could rise in the West.
“It’s a nice night, I think I’ll walk back,” I told Watson. He nodded in reply as I half-turned to bow towards Holmes and began walking toward the village and the rectory.
A pair of salamanders formed a path between Watson and one of the carriages, low lines of fire scorching the pristine white stone. Watson nodded at a pair of men, large brawny types, and approached the lead carriage.
Holmes grumbled in reply, but the grin on his face belied his tone. “I was hoping to visit the village today, see what I can pick up on our priest and our mystery guest.”
There was a gasp behind me, and I whipped around. There was a small opening that served as a window, and I climbed up to it. There was a stack of crates piled up outside the shack, and I could see a small form trying to cower between two of them.
The rain stopped a few hours later. It was cold, and I had managed to acquire several more fauns during the day.
Acton snarled quietly, but Mycroft kept him pinned into his chair. The men who accompanied him ranged silently around the room, glancing between the creatures and the reflection of the wolf.
I dropped the paper, shifting back to wolf as I leapt back out of the window. To hell with any prejudices he might have, I would need a mage at my back to handle this, and Watson was the only one here who could help.
John sighed. “There are rules, that every mage must abide by. By rights, I should have said nothing to you, and by so doing, I branded myself a traitor to the Solar Council.”
Well, I was here, and needed. So, first to figure out how to fit in with the human element, then to figure out the magical end of things.
Spirit mages were rare, even moreso than female skinchangers. This changed a lot, actually. Spirit mages tended to go one of two ways: either they were absolute evil, or absolutely pure. The evil ones were obvious, too. Dead ground and enslaved elementals. Usually derived further power from torture, rape, murder. Fun people. Those were the mages that went in for human sacrifice and other nastiness. The other ones… well. They were the kinds of people it was easy to hate, and then you’d hate yourself for hating them. They were genuinely good people. Didn’t matter who or what you were, if it was in their power, they’d help you. They always strove to make the world a better place. And usually, they’d succeed for a few years.
I waved as the carriage passed me in the lane, not overly surprised when it pulled to a halt a short distance away. I took the implied invitation, climbing in across from Father Simeon.
“Potentials are special. Mostly, they look indistinguishable from humans. Unless you know exactly what you’re looking at, you can’t tell. But they’re wolves, too. And a skinchanger, like me, can Awaken that potential.”
He shouted something is some guttural tongue, but the end of his words were cut off by my teeth meeting in his throat. I pulled his throat out, letting him fall into a bloody heap at my feet.
“Hardly,” Holmes lit his pipe as he considered Watson. “Mycroft did have something. Personal, rather than business.”
“Very well. You,” Watson announced, pointing at me, “lie back down. I’ll send up luncheon and Mycroft, the pair of you can discuss Shanbrook. You,” he continued, pointing at Holmes, “I believe we should take the gentleman’s suggestion and talk.”
<If you two don’t kiss each other already, I will crawl down there and smack both of with a turbot.>
Holmes debated stepping in, trying to claim his own chance with Fox, but no. Watson was his dearest friend, he couldn’t, wouldn’t, try to impede his happiness.
I shrugged. “Unicorn. That mostly falls under ‘shit I will explain when we have time.’” I turned back to Watson. “And since I haven’t worked with anyone for the past seven years, we’re going to have to figure stuff out, quickly.”
Holmes barked an order, setting the carriages rattling towards the hut. He turned to regard the image again.
I sighed, slowing as I approached a nasty snarl of magics. <Right now, nothing. I would like your permission to drain off your energy, should I need it, but that will be later.> I walked along the leading edge, then something struck me. <Actually, yes. Get a cart or something set up. Don’t head out here yet, I don’t want to give him any more warning than needed, but getting a lift back for the kids would be good.>
Whatever, whoever this deranged idiot was south of the town, he’d managed to snatch all of the kids in one swoop.
I grinned as I grabbed for the underthings on the bed. “At least we don’t have to worry about my hair.”
“Some, certainly, though I hope to speak to Father Simeon tonight to see the details of his plan.” He studied me, then flashed a grin. “You should join us for dinner. There’s more than enough room.”
“Don’t worry, it gets worse. So, my world was pretty lean on mages and heavy towards wolfwalkers. The old bastards who called the shots decided that we would be keeping track of our lineages, you know, like people do for show dogs. That kept up for… honestly too long. We ended up kicking up more pups who were Potentials or soulshifters, and a lot of boys. It eventually reached a point where any skinchanger was heavily celebrated. Males would be able to go off and have the world offered to them on a silver platter. Females….”
I glanced between the two men, then sighed. “Okay, new plan. Watson, you distract them, and start scrying as soon as you can. You know how to feed magic between lovers’ bonds?”
A laugh, bright and sudden, dragged him from his thoughts. A woman, with a man’s suit and shaved head, was sitting at a corner table, surrounded by children. Watson turned, to remark on her appearance, only to find Holmes staring at her.
