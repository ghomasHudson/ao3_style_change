“I’m probably gonna be done with Gabriel’s car today.  Come by and pick it up?” Dean asks fixing his hair in the mirror.
"I dare you to make out with that one.”  He points his cup in Castiels direction who walks out of the bathroom, with his shirt half wet. "I've seen how he looks at you, why not give him a taste of what he's missing?"
It’s 9 pm and it’s raining in Lawrence Kansas. There’s an unconscious man that lies on road less travelled, and he’s accepted he’ll die today.
"Cas there isn't anywhere in this world I'm not willing to follow you."  Dean looked so proud telling that.
He forces Dean to come inside with him who is as confused as him and overall afraid. He tries bargaining with Castiel that he’s not prepared or even dressed properly despite just coming from a graduation. Though it takes a look of Castiel's puppy dog eyes and he's following him, grumbling underneath his breath about how it's not fair.
“Well congratulations dear, we knew you’d get in.” His mother says not even looking up from her plate.
You never how much something meant to you until it surfaces back again in your life. Like an old friend, only you don't know how to feel about it. There's pain, anger and the realisation that you never healed from it.
Dean stops the car in front of Castiels house. He contemplates calling him but he realises doesn’t have his number. He’s about to horn but before he can. Castiel walks out in a blue denim jacket, sleeves messily rolled up, his hair a perfect example of bed head.
Dean’s quiet for a moment,” They’re gone.” Castiel turns to look towards Dean. “Just me and Sammy.” Their eyes catch in the rear view mirror for a minute before Dean diverts his attention back ob the road.
Dean was changing. Burning less brighter now. At first he didn't get it. What could possibly make a star loose it's shine. Then it clicked. It was him. Somewhere along the way of sharing his pain with Dean he had burdened him with it.
Behind Dean, Charlie and Dorothy laugh while taking goofy pictures. Charlie bodily laughs when Dorothy makes a funny face with crossed eyes.
"I've never asked much from you mother and right now all I'm asking is to go on a road trip with Dean."
She smiles. It’s a warm one too because if he’d seen that before he knows his heart wouldn’t melt so easily. “Well I’m glad you stopped by. She walks back into the kitchen,” I made pie.”
Dean chuckles behind him.”I bet” He chucks of his shoes and Henley leaving him in him in his plain black T-shirt. He nudges  one of Castiels dangling foot.” Come on let’s get you into something more comfortable.”
Castiel sheepishly made his way closer avoiding direct eye contact with his brother. Gabriel moves aside to let him enter. The lounge is still. Even the lights are off.  Most importantly his mom isn’t sitting fuming or asking about his whereabouts or scolding him. He breathes a sigh of relief at that.
Charlie huffs out a bitter laugh at the name,” Cas has barely spoken to me. I don’t even think he knows how I feel.” She pauses to sniffle,”It’s like he’s done with me.”
Castiel sighs. His appetite completely gone now. “Of course. Keep telling yourself that” He pushes the plate full of dinner away,” I think I’m gonna head out early to Dean’s. Probably gonna stay the night.”
“Come on buddy let’s take you to bed.” Dean rasps out, forcing  Castiel up who grumbles in response.
They both share a knowing look before she turns to him,” Oh Castiel, you don’t know what you walked in to.”
It’s Friday,Castiel waves Charlie bye as he enters his brother’s barely functioning Baleno.  Gabriel turns the key but the car only screeches painfully on his first two attempts.
Castiel leans on his bed, one hand holding the phone the other pulling the curtain back. From his window Castiel gets a full view of the front porch and there’s Dean’s car, parked right outside his house.
He tilts his head, furrowing his brows. Sometimes he wonders if Charlie purposefully skips out what she's talking about.
He found himself spending a lot of time looking down, wondering what it would feel like if he just leaped off the edge. Would it hurt? Would he feel anything?
“Nah” Gabriel waves it off, relaxing back in the booth.” I just do that to annoy her. Jo’s just a friend.”
“Gotta admit, the guy is pretty hot and that’s saying something considering I don’t even swing that way.”
Dean chugs the rest of his beer down, mumbles,”Fuck this game.” And gets up. He strides towards Castiel with his chin up and chest out.
“So you’re the boy who stole my sons’s heart.” She says eyeing Dean cautiously even though there’s a slight smile on her lips it doesn’t look forced but it doesn’t look genuine either.
Castiel releases his breath and leans forward to softly peck Dean who eagerly accepts it. “Thank you.” He mumbles against his lips.
Stupid highschool and the speed at which news spreads. Stupid friendships and stupid guy with a cocky personality.
Castiel laughs a sweet laugh at the scene. Dean watches him. The laugh captures the attention of Jo who climbs off the table and towards Castiel. Castiel realises even before it happens. Jo ignores his continuous dissents and pulls him into the cheerful crowd.
He doesn't want to think about that. That means leaving everything here behind. His relationship with Dean, his brother and Charlie.
“Gabriel said he’d treat me and Dean to some burgers.” His eyes squint out of their own accord, trying to gauge his mother’s mood.” So I just came to grab a change of clothes.”
“The owners a family friend, he taught me couple of things so I help around.” That’s all that Dean gives. The strain in his voice although speaks more.
Dean had pulled over where the dark sky could be seen with the town beneath it with it street lights glowing like little pearls. It was beautiful. They sat their for a while talking and drawing close to each other slowly. Soon it wasn’t just talking, they shared kisses between. Castiel could feel the buzzing phone I’m his pocket but he couldn’t care less.
His arms goes numb from being in the same position for too long but he doesn’t care. He just sits there basking in the moment.
“Because this is life Dean, nothing is ever enough.” She’s quiet for moment, taking extra care of folding foil around the pie,” I'd rather not see my son lagging in life because of you.”
“Well the night ain’t over yet.” Dean reveals, because he doesn’t want it to end either. “Open your window.” He instructs doing the same and stretches his arm out, palm open. Feeling the wind brush through his fingers.
Saturday rolled around and Castiel found himself at the party where the music thrummed a little too loudly for his liking and the stench of sweat was up in the air of the bodies dancing in sync with the beat in the main room. The lounge was where people were sitting in groups playing different games. In one corner of the room there were sophomores hyping their friends in chugging.
There’s a weird sort of tension rising and Castiel doesn’t know what to do with it. Thankfully he’s saved from further thought of it by Jo.
“I always wanted to be a mechanic.” Dean shrugs,”Besides I think I’ll be happy as long as I have you.”
The keychain jingles as it’s inserted. Castiel looks up from where he’s seated on a chair beside the table. His sketchbook rests on it with a half done sketch. Songs blaring from his phone.
They arrived at their destination and Gabriel bid Dean bye. Castiel swings the door open and steps out. He doesn’t say anything just keeps walking. Doesn’t know what to.
Castiel is silent for a second. “Okay.” He closes his phone and gets up. “Lets go.” He walks past a Dean to the door, hand on the knob when Dean speaks up again.
Dean opens and closes his mouth, trying come up with an explanation of why he had   Castiel’s journal in his lap.
Pain, so much pain. It poured out of him now. He was no dam being cracked or breaking. He was a cup, one that was over flowing now, so much so that it was spilling off the table now and there was no hope of it ever stopping.
It  feels like home. Always does. Standing there, for the world to see that they belong to each other. For the world to realise that no matter what crap is given to them they will get through it, as long as they have each other.
The answer seemed to make Dean laugh, " Out of all the places in the world you choose the stars, why?"
By the time he’s in and showering off the shampoo, the bathroom door opens and a few minutes later a warm body hugs him from behind, peppering little kisses on the nape of his neck.
He heard the soft howl of the wind as it blew past his window and impulsively twisted himself on his bed and slid the window open.
It doesn't sit right with him, this new side of his mom but he'll have what he can take. At least for today.
Castiel  sits there with a smile playing on his lips.” Thank you, for tonight.” He softly speaks, still looking at him.
The bell rings and he’s saved from responding. That doesn’t stop him from pondering over what Charlie said.
It's frustrating to act like a couple who just doesn't want to be outed even though they're both very comfortable in their sexuality. It pains him to see all those damn couple hanging around school while he can't even do that with his fucking boyfriend.
He’s smiling, all teeth and gums and it’s perfect to Dean. He still sits in the corner observing him. Their eyes meet and Castiel gestures for him to join too. Dean just lightly shakes his head. He’s content at looking at him.
Then something happened that brought Castiel back from his stupor. Dean Winchester looked to Castiel and winked. This time a blush adorned his cheeks too when he turned his head down towards his textbook.
"Hey, hey it's okay." Dean whose voice was still raspy from the little amount of sleep he got, who made shushing noises that somehow did help him. Who stayed despite knowing how fucked up Cas is.
Dean stands stiffly beside Cas, unsure of what to say or do now that he's finally facing Castiel's mother.
“I got my acceptance letter for Stanford.” He mumbles like it’s nothing, more so like it bothers him.
He shakes his head and burrows his head deeper in Dean’s neck. At that Dean does crack a smile. Although Castiel does lean forward for Dean to dislodge his hand.
Castiel stares at him. He huffs out a laugh, leaning back in the black leather seat. “Your unbelievable.”
He had fallen in love with Dean. Dean who shined so bright while Cas, he was just nothing, no purpose, no meaning. Dean on the other hand had so much he wanted to do, become a firefighter, save people, be a hero.
When he opens them back he catches sight of a leather journal on the dash. It’s rough around the edges and the pages seem to  be bursting out of it. Although that’s not what intrigued him. It’s the snippet of colours on the said pages.
Hello lovelies enjoy this chapter full of love and some hint into Castiel's relationship with his parents.
“Did you better, called a mechanic who'll look into your car and tow it back. A friend of mine actually, he'll be here soon.” When Castiel tilts his head in confusion She explains.”Could see you two trying to get that piece of junk to work for a while.”
Charlie laughs. It’s sudden and catches Castiel off guard. “That’s the best excuse you could come up? Save it Cas.” She turns to leave.
Doubt seemed to be winning a lot of battles recently. It surrounded Cas, towered over him and making him feel more powerless. As if he wasn't weak already.
“If I didn’t know any better I’d say you have a date.” Gabriel says walking closer to the disaster in the room.
It’s late, way after is usual curfew but Castiel doesn’t seem to care about that right now. All he wants is for the night to not end. Of course he doesn’t voice his thoughts.
Fourteenth of February. Valentine’s Day. Castiel finally forces himself out of his bed. He grimaces when a glance at his table shows the list of things Charlie had given him excitedly like a nine year old who is handing out her birthday invite.
“Not as much.”Castiel mumbles.” When you’ve got the money for a plane ticket why bother, that’s what mom and dad always said.”
His eyes travel up until they land on the moon and he hopes that tomorrow holds more than today did.
Castiel huffs out a small laugh at that, leaning against the side of the hood. “Thank you Dean but those aren’t good enough for a scholarship.”
He exits the place to find Gabriel under the hood” what’re you doing? Do you even know anything about cars?”
“You want a ride?” Dean asks, leaning out of the driver’s window with his hand hanging out. Steering the car slowly at Castiel’s speed.
He’s on his phone  going through a website talking about places not miss when visiting Kansas when the door opens and Dean walks in.
For some reason he doesn't feel like doing it this year. Hanging out with Charlie and talking about how miserable their lives are. Maybe it's because it's their last oneor just because he doesn't want to.
They arrive at Castiel’s place where the boy himself stands with a huge bag slung over his shoulder, holding his sketchbook. He’s wearing one of his graphic shirts, sitting outside his house with a huge smile on his face.
They drive off. The sun shinning high above upon them. At some point Castiel opens his window, tilting his head out and letting the wind mess his hair up. He feels free, like he could fly away with Dean if we wanted to. Somewhere where no one expected so much from just a couple of teenagers.
She laughed," Honey if I let you make your own decisions you would've already wasted your life away to some art school."
He wants to shout at her and be angry for using Dean's name like something to be disgusted of when in reality he's the only who he can always count on. He wants to tell her how much he hates her for everything. The hurt, the pain, the numbness, every single thing that she ruined for him.
“Holy fudge you’re actually back. We didn’t think you’d be since you guys left with almost all your stuff.”
He’s going through the list again, making mental notes of where he would need to stop before hand and the things he can just get with Charlie later. That’s when his phone rings and of course it’s Dean.
Dean stops the car in front Oak Hill Cemetery. The place was well taken care of, considering the greenery. If there weren’t any headstones to go by the place looked brighter than a park.
Castiel opens the door to their room and drops their bags at the entrance. He doesn’t bother taking of his shoes and just flops onto the bed over the covers.
It wasn't an apology but for one God damn day he just doesn't wanna fight with her so he'll take what he can get.
“Is it true?” Charlie interrogates slamming Castiel’s locker. He's starting to pity his locker for the all the banging it suffers.
“I feel like I’m missing a big chunk of backstory.” Castiel says, eyeing Sam who takes out his phone and starts typing away.
Dean rolls his eyes but braces himself for the onslaught of questions.” Becky, nice to see you too.” He gives her a tight smile.
A tear slipped down his cheek as a lump formed in his throat. Sob after sob escaped him and he couldn't find it in himself to even control them.
He’s a little out of breath when he gets there, because of course the bathroom they had to choose as ‘their spot’ had to be the most secluded one.
Because you remind me of them and he is not even close enough to compare to the brightness Dean shines upon the world by just his mere existence.
Dean takes them to the roadhouse. It’s bustling with people tonight even though it’s a Monday. They seat themselves in a corner. Unknowingly it’s the same place where Castiel and Gabriel sat.
Dean’s on him the second he enters. The door hasn’t even fully closed when Dean crowds him in the wall beside it, kissing him like crazy.
The window rolls down and there sits Dean Winchester in the drivers seat. Castiel shifts himself away from the window. He's not in the mood for any social interaction nor does he have the energy for it.
Apologies for this being kinda late, life has been a little crazy recently. But here have this chapter in which you guys will finally see Dean's POV too!
Dean starts driving the car without another word and Castiel instantly feels guilt washing over him. They sit there in awkward silence for while., Castiel fiddling with a loose thread on his sleeve while Dean just tries to focus on driving.
Dean eases back beside him bending one of his legs up on the car. He bodily twists himself to Castiel staring at him.
Castiel doesn’t see him approaching.  When he does, it’s a little too late for words. Dean quickly cradles his face in his hands and kisses him. Backing him up against the wall.
It’s beautiful. That’s the first thing that comes to his mind. The pages are filled with wonderful landscapes and sketches. He recognises one of the sketches as Charlie Bradbury in a Star Wars costume. His lips curve up into a tiny smile. Some drawings are dark and grim with skulls, red and black prominent in those.
He doesn't feel like dressing up and ends up wearing his most worn out black jeans with his favourite old graphic sweatshirt. Castiel doesn’t even bother brushing his hair to a proper style.
They stop at a signal when a sleek black car stops beside them. He doesn't know about cars much but this one looks old yet well taken care of.
They sit in companionable silence for a few minutes before Dorothy speaks again. “Charlie, even after whatever happened between us, I still consider us friends. Of sorts.” Charlie cracks a barely there smile at that.” What’s bothering you? I’ve barely seen you at school and you didn’t even come to the last LARPing.”
March rolls around and Castiel sits at his usual corner in the cafeteria alone. Charlie had texted him, telling that she wasn’t feeling well and Castiel had took for what it was. It didn’t bother him that much as it should’ve because he was able to meet Dean more with no Charlie stuck to his hip.
Castiel is in the same state, lip locked with Dean. They both are practically gleaming, feeling proud of graduating together.
The stars seemed to shine so brightly that night. Oh how he wished he could reach out and touch them, be them.
“You don’t just feel happy.” She interjects with air quotes,”there’s gotta be something you not telling me.”
“I don’t think so.” Dean hands the journal to Castiel.” You shouldn’t give up before even trying.” He emphasises again.
Castiel takes a deep breath and looks down on his thigh, gashes on it with no certain method. Some go deep while the others are just tiny long cuts.
Lifting the blanket, Dean gets comfortable on the bed, facing Castiel who has got his back turned to Dean.
Until you're so lost in the feeling of the pain that for a moment you can forget about everything. The trauma, the sadness, self loathing. For a minute the world around you seems to dissolve into an abyss of darkness.
“What’s gotten in you? You’ve been humming like a lovesick puppy” Sam asks , his face scrunched up while glaring at the textbook in his lap. They’re in Bobby’s auto shop. Sam sits on one of the benches with his book in his lap.
Or maybe the fact he hoped Dean would do something considering it's their first Valentine. Though it was pretty clear nothing was going to happen when he saw how Dean reacted to even the mention of the date.
If Dean’s arm wasn’t numb and hurting he’d probably laugh. He whispers Castiel’s name and at that he gains some amount of sense because he hums back.
He takes deep breaths , or at least tries to. His blurry vision falls on the bracelet around his right wrist and something changes in his demeanour. His body starts to go lax and his vision consumed by darkness but there’s a slight smile barely noticeable on the man’s face. In that moment, behind his closed lids those emerald green eyes play through all those moments with his lover.
In the lounge sits Dean with all the other jocks he's warmed up to. One of the girl’s sitting in Benny’s lap suggested truth or dare to relive past years or some shit so that’s how they end up taking turns spinning the bottle and asking questions or daring one another.
Later when she leaves for a few minutes to attend a phone call des Dean explain,” She has this freaky psychic thing where she can tell your future by just looking at you.”
It was often easy, to some extent, mute the shouting and screaming around him. The fights mom and Anna would have were better to ignore too. You just ask them to stop then somehow it's taking sides. You tell them they both are wrong then apparently it's still taking sides.
Of course that had not lasted. He had to pick up and when he did he fake coughed his way through the call.
I know I’ve come off as weird or crazy to you and for that I apologise but I only mean well. These boys are like my own children. Just be careful when it comes to Dean. That boy feels things more acutely than anyone I’ve ever met. When he loves someone he will do anything his power to keep them safe and happy. Don't give on him so easily, will you?”
Charlie slumps in a seat nearby. She’s surrounded by people, mostly her juniors or freshmen out with their dates. People walk by her, laughing and enjoying the night. A group of friends walks by talking about the movie they just came out from watching.
“Still no luck with your artists block?”Charlie asked as she took a bit from her apple.  They were in the school cafeteria, bustling with students talking to their friends. Charlie and Castiel sat in a corner with his journal open on the empty page. “I’m sure inspiration will strike your little brain soon.”
"Oh come on Cas, it's senior year and nothing interesting or fun hasn't happened yet, by the looks of it this guy might change the game.
The door opens not a second later by Mrs. Novak. Her hair neatly clutched in a bun, eyes sharp and cold as she looks at the comer.
That’s why the cuts are so wild. It seems as if his hand has a mind of his own as soon as the blunt blade touches his skin, creating art upon his body.
At some point he succumbs to slumber too because Dean’s being shook awake by Sam. He rubs the sleep out of his eyes and notices the t.v turned off and the table  clear of their earlier wrappers of snacks.
Life doesn't just magically get better because of a person entering his life. The mess still exists. You just get good at ignoring it when you've got something else to give your attention too.
Does time actually heal or it just leaves a mark on you forever to look at it and think about it. To have quiet moments to yourself where you look at your scars and wonder what goes so terribly wrong in one's life that they hurt themselves. Whether it be for punishment, penance or just to forget about the emotional pain with physical one.
He coughs, hoping to loose the lump in his throat. “Hey mom, dad. I’m sorry we didn’t come to visit for a while. You probably know but Bobby thought it better for us to get out of this place. Something bout being close to everyone else.” He pauses to take a deep breath.” Sam’s good though, he actually fit right in. Made a couple of great friends there. “ Dean smiles, until his eyes zone back in to where he’s standing.
Charlie reaches for the door knob but stops. She reconsiders and instead of opening the door and making herself comfortable like she’d always do, she knocks.
Dean tries to move but his hand is still wedged between Castiel and the couch. He softly shakes Castiel who at first doesn’t seem to get the memo and cuddles closer.
It gnaws at his insides and he averts his gaze back to Dean. Though that doesn't mean it goes unnoticed.
Dean glances at Castiel but does a second take when he catches him staring. It’s amusing, the way he’s leaned and back and more open, looking like a pleased cat.
“You’re annoying.” Sam huffs, places his books back in his bag and hops of the wooden bench.” I’m gonna go to Kevin’s.”
Dean kisses him softly, till his anxiety seeps away into nothingness and it’s just him and Castiel. Standing in a three star motel comforting each other with actions where words are useless.
Castiel smiles.” I thought you would’ve heard me walk in but I guess you were too busy snooping around.” He explains with his dorky air quotes.
Castiel grumbles something incoherent but does comply. He gets up and goes to the bathroom. When he returns it’s only in his boxers, collapsing into the bed again but this time he does get under the sheets.
“Hi Mrs.Novak is Cas home? He hasn’t been replying to my texts and we were supposed to hang out today.” Charlie lies, offering a sweet smile.
"Cas you Okay? Forgot something?" Dean asks from inside the impala. His face distorted in confusion and worry.
"Hurry up Sammy or else we're gonna be late." He shouted, banging over the bathroom door, ignoring the sting in his knuckles.
Dean’s quiet for a moment.” No offence Cas but they’re wrong. You should at least try before giving up.”
She pauses her movement to give him a soft smile. “Because you haven’t seen the mess life brings with age Dean. You both are young.”
When they arrive at the joint, it looks a little old. From the outside the precariously positioned sign reads “Emma’s Diner”. Although the interior of the place is better with its checkered flooring, bright red stools and booths.
Castiel raises an eyebrow at him before sitting beside him. He takes a deep breath, inhaling the  smell of dirt, leather and everything else. A glimpse towards Dean shows him deep in gaze of the stars glittered above in the dark blue sky.
“Didn’t expect to see you here.” Someone spoke from behind Charlie, they walked into view and Charlie catches Dorothy's eyes. Her hair are tied in a pony tail, her hands in the pockets of her jeans.
"We've got a new kid in our year, he's the talk of the day because apparently he sent two dudes to the hospital for, whatever school he came from."
did, always have. For once he wants to fight for what he wants, rather than let them take the reigns and for something that doesn't belong to them.
Okay one thing i forgot to mention in my story is that this story starts after Christmas break so my bad for not mentioning it earlier in a chapter.
Charlie steps back, her eyes full of unshed tears.” We’re done.” Her voice wavering,” You can keep everything to yourself now." Castiel watches a single tear slide down her face before she bolts out, slamming the door
That night when they retire to the now familiar motel bed, laying in each other’s embrace, thermostat turned to its coldest temperature just breathing in each other’s scent Castiel asks Dean of something.
After some examining he speaks ,”the problem ain’t hard to spot, but I gotta tow her back to the garage.” He turns to look at Castiel , who’s standing beside him and smirks,” I could give you guys a ride.”
Dorothy's look softens at that. “I know, but don’t think like you’re loosing anybody. I’m still here, Castiel-“
"Well I changed my ins since you took ages in the bathroom." He said, shrugging on his leather jacket. "What took you so long anyway?" He considers his words," Never mind don't answer that."
Charlie nods with the same smile on her lips and slowly walks up the carpeted stairs. By now Mrs. Novak has left to continue whatever chore she had left to answer the door.
“Oh come on sugar don't give up now.” Gabriel whined to the car as if it’d start working on his command, completely ignoring what his brother said.
The door opens and a body falls on the gravel. It’s a guy in a torn and bloodied leather jacket. He’s got a gash in his head which awfully bleeds onto his face and legs to numb for moving. He drags himself with this hands away from the crumpled car. Despite the trauma afflicted on it, the radio sings on.
Dean huffs out a sigh and gets to work of ridding Castiel of his  socks.After which he looses his garments too until he’s only in his shirt and boxers. He takes Castiel’s phone out of his jeans pocket, typing a text a to Gabriel about him staying over.
" Don't you see it Dean? I'm not good for you. You're this perfect person with perfect plans with their life and I'm nothing i have nothing and all I do is bring mess to your life. I'm not good luck Dean."
“Dean just because I don’t own one myself doesn’t mean I don’t know how to drive it.” Castiel settles in the seat, strapping the seat belt in.
"It was actually." Cas wipes the tear away, "Dad was a sap, used to hold moms hand as he'd drive. Would even change the gear holding her hand."
Charlie had already dispersed in the throng of sweaty bodies. Castiel gave up on trying to find her. He was making his way out of the room when one of the jocks  bumped into him, spilling his drink onto him.  The guy didn’t even bother apologising.
He huffs out a sigh before walking across the front and getting in the passenger seat. Dean looks at him with a raised brow. He doesn't know why but he feels frustrated.
Though that doesn't mean he didn't have hope for finding love himself. That's the worst thing about hope, you can't ever loose it. There's always some of it in you, showing itself when things go a little too good in life but with that so does doubt creep in. Doubt of it actually being true.
He was watching the stars with Dean again on his roof. From being a spot on the roof it became the spot. Where they would sit and talk about the future. Cas had realised he didn't know what he wanted to do it. He never knew he'd make it this far.
He doesn't know where to begin. He's never felt so alive, so happy and so just full of life. It's more like he's drowning, drowning in voices and there's nothing to grab on to.
She sighs, rubbing her temple and pulls the phone away to check the time.  The numbers 7:56pm glow brightly.
Dean walks in with a demeanour which can only be described as tired. He softly shuts the door behind him, places the keys on the side table and takes of his extra layer.
" I-I don't understand Cas everything's good so why are you doing this?" Dean had pleaded and it pained him. It pained him so much and he couldn't stop his outburst from coming.
Dean grumbles something incoherent but shifts himself to the other side. Castiel stretches his limbs grimacing at the sweaty feeling.
Dean pulls over on the edge of the road, green bare land on both sides. He gets out and Castiel does the same, silently questioning his actions. He follows him to the back of the car. He hop in the trunk of the impala and pats the place beside him.
The morning light filters through the thin curtains directly onto the bed. He can hear the baby birds chirping in their nest on the tree right next his window. In some ways the scene looked quiet peaceful but to Castiels sleep addled brain it was all just too noisy right now.
“I knew I sensed some tension between you two.” Jo gives both of them a knowing look. “ Anyways what can I get ya?”
There's too much emotions swirling inside his heart right now. Love, adoration, care but fear too. It scares him how much he's willing to do for Cas. He could ask him to fight the world for and he would.
Dean smiled at the sight. He seems to do that a lot around Castiel. He kisses Castiel’s soft raven black hair and keeps his face buried in the bed head for while with eyes closed, just breathing in the minty shampoo.
So many times. He considered doing it so many times yet something always felt unfinished to him. Ironic isn't it?
“Becky Rosen Tyler would you leave the poor boy alone.” An old lady says from behind the counter, wiping her hands with a towel.
Their helping clean the table and Castiel somehow ends up drying the dishes beside Missouri while she washes them.
Castiel follows suit, flexing his fingers to the cascading air blowing past them. He observes the lack of cars and sticks his head out. After a few minutes he thumps back in the seat giggling, hair a mess.
Castiel never understood the point of love. Not for a long time because all he had to go by were the shitty experiences his parents had or the toxic relationship Anna, his sister was in. It made Castiel come to his own conclusion.
Maybe that’s what scares Dean the most. How he can imagine a forever with Castiel. This man, who hums to cheesy love songs, whose eyes shine bright at the smell of cheeseburger, who cherishes art. This man who Dean can imagine a future with.
“Since you started fucking with Dean and you forgot about me.” Charlie completes it for him. Her voice slightly wavers at the last word.
They’re at a place called the ‘Roadhouse’, a place Gabriel recently took a liking too. The place looks more like a bar than a burger joint but overall it isn’t too shabby nor is it obnoxiously bright coloured like the previous new joint Gabriel took him too. It’s simple,decent and not too crowded.
A prided vehicle with too many good times. Memories with his lover still linger in it. So does the faint feeling of him against his now weak hands.
“They were homophobic assholes who deserved it.” He immediately tells, with no anger, no frustrating in his voice. “There now you know.” He softly uttered the last words.
“No, I mean even after you’re gone for college, stay with me. We’ll work something out. I’ll come visit you and maybe after Sam leaves for college I’ll move there get a job. We’ll have one of those little cozy apartments or maybe those studio ones, whatever you like. “
Before He can say anything more, soft thumping of feet against the carpeted stairs aware them of Castiel’s arrival before he’s even in the living room.
I guess it’s just everything is happening so fast you know, I just feel like I’m loosing everyone and everything even before I’ve graduated.”
Castiel just shakes his head in disbelief although there’s a smile playing on his lips. This is most definitely not where he expected the conversation to go.
When the waitress finally leaves with their order after being called for, and Castiel can't help but taunts.“Thought I’d have to starve and die for you send her away.”
Charlie places her hand, not allowing Castiel to open it. “Dude, it’s Dean Winchester we’re talking about.”
Castiel’s quiet for a second for the left side of lip quirks up in a smirk. He mirrors Dean’s position and lowly says, “ I don’t know, I think you’ll have to make me promise  to something else too.”
Dean gets out of the car for Castiel to occupy the vacated space. “ You sure you know how to drive?”
Lastly apologies for keeping y'all waiting for this chapter, I have not been in a good headspace these past few days.
It's April and the click clack of the spoons colliding with the plates is louder in the silence of the residents of the Novak household. Their six people dining table, filled up to four.
Ah yes, Single's valentine. A tradition they started in freshmen year in which they go to the movies, make fun of all couples a send their day at Charlie's place most likely eating ice cream.
The humdrum of his school's hall wasn't enough for his mind to shut off. He tried focusing on the laughs he heard as the jocks made jokes about someone or the gasps another group made when they heard a new gossip.
As abruptly it had started, it ends the same way. Dean swiftly pulls away, ignoring the hollers of his friends. He takes a second or two,  standing there with Castiel’s face in his hands just taking in the moment. Castiel just stands there, eyes wide open with shock and lips slightly parted.
“Oh no,“ Castiel waves Dean off,” it’s just this thing Charlie and I did, singles valentine. We’d watch movies and stuff nothing better than this though.”
Dean under the hood of the old Baleno, hands deep inside the car. “Those are some big accusations coming from a lil guy like you.”
to me” Castiel says with air quotes.” Besides, since when do you call a girl, you're on first name basis with, a friend?”
"Sorry I just, um remembered I've got a quiz on Monday." He gets in the car, giving Dean as assuring of smile he could right now.
They both lean in for a kiss and meet in the middle. Dean kisses softly, all his previous sadness washed away by Castiel's pure soul. This is the point perhaps, where everything shifts from just a relationship to the relationship. The point where they stand at the edge of cliff tipping on falling
When Castiel retires to his bed in his pyjamas he scrolls through his contacts to find Dean’s number. Scrunching his face when he doesn’t find it in D, he scrolls further down till he finds it. He smiles when he finds a contact he knows he definitely did not save.
That really is a question that Dean should know the answer to, and the fact that Sam expects him to know it has Dean fidgeting. His mind turns slowly as he thinks back. Hadn't he shown up one time, and the lights in Cas's place were off, like he'd been asleep? And when he woke up that one time with Cas curled against him, just how rhythmically had he been breathing? Dean remembers it now, the stifled yawn that he'd skipped over, too busy chasing his thoughts in his mind. And Dan the Chef--Cas knew his schedule, knew when he'd be willing to cook them a meal. He watches as Eileen smoothly swaps out Cas's beer for Dean's empty one when Cas isn't looking and plays innocent when Cas seems perplexed, and Dean wonders just how much he's missed.
He can’t get himself to look Cas in the face quite yet so he zones in on the handful of bees that are undeterred by his presence and far more interested in surrounding the angel—as if they’re equally as mesmerized by the sight. Dean’s eyes track a single bee as it lands in Cas’ dark locks. He fights the urge to swat it away in mild terror, but quickly notices just how docile it is, simply resting on the angel’s mane. Resting. The realization encourages Dean to release the air he’s holding on to. It comes out in a long sigh that causes not only his face to relax but his shoulders to drop a few inches too. He’s not sure he’s ever felt so… calm.
“Enough,” he grits out. “That is an outright lie and we both know it. You deserve whatever you want.”
Dean quirks an eyebrow in confusion and amusement as Cas frees his hands to reach into the front pocket of his apron.
Dean sees red and rushes toward the angel with enough force that Cas releases an involuntary grunt when his back meets the stainless steel of the counter. The pots and pans dangling overhead clang violently, the heat in Dean’s eyes flaring in tandem. His hips keep the angel pinned while his palms and fingers grip Cas’ biceps, the material of the stark white button-down bunching in his unforgiving hold.
“I’ll be careful. Scouts honor.” Dean mock salutes, making an attempt at shifting the somewhat tense energy to something a bit more lighthearted.
He swallows down a shiver and grasps onto what might be the only sliver of bravado he has left. “You
Dean’s frustration roars at even the implication that Cas thinks he might not like being around him. “Tolerate? I love your company, Cas. You’re my best friend. You have to know that, don’t you?”
So when the heat in his belly builds, all he can manage to do is hold on. He clings to Cas as if he’s afraid of falling, afraid that this magic will disappear in an instant.
That’s the part that scares him the most: companionship. A chance in heaven and in hell that someone might want him not just as a warm mouth or a more-than-decent lay, but as a partner. A companion. And not just someone. Castiel.
And with that, Dean is pushed out of the kitchen and instructed to wait to return until Cas gives him and Sam the all-clear that dinner is ready. Dean grins and nods and goes to find Sam for the time being. The younger, yet taller brother, is in the library with his nose in a book—perhaps an attempted replacement for his laptop that has been intercepted by Cas.
Cas grins and steps into his space. Dean senses his hesitation, perhaps due to Cas’ inexperience, so he uses his free arm to wrap around the angel’s thick waist and pull him flush against his body. He grunts at the feel and his eyes flick to the full, chapped lips he’s helplessly daydreamed about in the past. As his mouth connects with Cas’, he can’t stop the full-body smile it ignites, causing their teeth to clank. The kiss is rather disjointed in terms of technique, but they both come away a little breathless and pink. Although Dean’s insides are humming, he notices the wave of relief that begins in his heart and ends at his toes. He’s relieved. Relieved to finally be here, to finally be allowing himself to love and be loved in this capacity.
As their breathing events out, they remain intertwined. And when Dean’s brain comes back online, his head stays put, nestled just below Cas’ chin, but his eyes glance this way and that way, surveying the now still garden.
. Certainly love,” he states without room for argument, “But maybe even companionship. And if that means a shot at happiness, then why wouldn’t you swallow the fear and find out what’s there?”
He wraps a heavy hand around the base and tugs, allowing the soapy residue that lingers on his hands to ease the movement. He should be chaffing from how much he’s done this in the last 12 hours, but not a single orgasm has left him feeling satisfied. As his head tips back and the crown connects with the shower wall, he releases a low groan at the contrast of the cool tile and the scorching heat of the water pelting his raw skin.
And then there’s the catalyst for all of this. Castiel. The man, angel, celestial being, whatever, that left a mark and created a bond so strong with Dean to the point he can no longer ignore the way he aches for his companionship. There's no more pretending that what Dean feels is trivial. The hope he once had that his desire for unbridled connection with Cas would vanish the longer he fought or ignored is not only null and void, but something Dean isn't sure he even wants to come to fruition anymore.
Although he realizes there’s some truth to the statement, Dean is determined to make the angel spell out, in neon-fucking letters what he’s trying to say. “What the hell are you getting at?”
, as a weakness. As a flaw. There’s still so much self-loathing that resides in you. And none of it’s your fault, Dean. Your father not only subjected you to these wounds, but he nurtured them.”
Dean whips around to glare at the angel. “Alright. You want to talk? Let’s talk. How about we start with you telling me
Dean steps back an inch on instinct. Almost afraid that his presence will disrupt the unexplainable magic that’s unfolding. He sucks in a breath. The realization that he’s bearing witness to whatever the hell is taking place fifty or so feet from his forever home with his forever husband causes an unforgiving wave of gratitude to crash into him, as does the gnawing feeling that he’s seeing something he has no right to see.
much better.” He continues, throwing his hands in the air. Suddenly remembering his state of undress, Dean wraps the rogue towel aggressively around his waist. “Look, I don’t know if celestial beings have the same needs as humans, but we do.
Dean tries to breathe through the oncoming wave of panic that’s crashing into him. Fortunately, he supposes, he’s coached Sammy through an attack or two to know how to do this.
Without looking up, Dean says, “You heard Sam. Time to head out.” Although there’s frustration evident in the sigh Cas releases, he lets the argument go, noticing the note of finality in Dean’s voice, and moves to leave the still humid shower room. A burst of cold air from the hallway pushes its way in, causing Dean to shiver slightly as he tugs on a clean flannel.
Here it is, the final, smut-filled chapter. Not sure how, but this one got away from me. The other four chapters have all hovered around 2,000 to 2,500 words. This one? It's nearly 5,000. Hope you like soft, loving, gentle, and passionate smut between a hunter and his angel.
Dean backs up a little in an effort to speed up the process and also to admire the being before him. As his eyes sweep downward, all reservations now proceeded by a building lust, the angel gives a triumphant “aha” and pulls a piece of mistletoe out into the space between them. “I thought I might have a need for this eventually.”
“Dumbass.” He quips nervously, using crass humor in attempt to mask that he’s on the verge of fleeing the bunker and locating the closest bar to engage in a self-sabotaging bender.
Sam nods. “Of course.” But before he can make his way out, Cas puts a hand out in front of Sam to stop him.
Cas strokes the top of his hand with his thumb. “Sam got off lucky, but you, you’ve been carrying around this weight of misguided expectation since childhood. As much as I wish to be the one to heal you from this, I can’t, Dean.” Cas’ voice almost breaks at that but he holds it together to finish, “So I most certainly won’t be the one to break you.”
Dean is honestly relieved to be talking to Cas’ back at this moment. He thinks it might actually increase the odds that he doesn’t chicken out twice in one evening. “Look, I need to apologize—”
Dean shakes his head, whether in disbelief at Cas’ logical rationale and understanding or his annoyance at himself for lying, he’s not sure. Probably both. Dean being amazed by the angel and fed up with his own antics in the same frame of time seems like a pretty common dichotomy.
With a grumpy, narrowed gaze zoned in on the flying insect, the hunter resumes his journey further into the backyard. It’s as if the bee is guiding him. Its flapping wings and persistent buzzing code for “Come along, this way. There’s something just over the hill that you need to see.”
“I want you to listen and do as I say. Can you do that for me, Dean?” The stark-still, shockingly turned on, and flushed hunter nodded. The responding smile from the angel was an arousing mix of gentle and predatory. “Good. While I procure a glass of water for you, I need you to go to the bedroom and strip.”
That had been two weeks ago, and the wedding ceremony? Just a week. It certainly lived up to Dean’s standards and he hoped it did for Cas’ too. The angel had all but left the planning to Dean, content to let the day unfold as he saw fit, saying, “Our union could take place on a beach, in a rainstorm, or next to a dumpster in a dark alley, and I would be happy.”
Dean's pacing ceases and he gulps. He's not sure if he was expecting that answer, but the way his heart flutters is evidence enough that he wasn’t truly prepared. This selfless, magnificent being is not only concerned about his happiness, but he loves him.
Dean is scrambling up off the bed and marching toward the door. He has no clue what his plan is, but at this point, he’ll swallow his pride, get down on his knees, and beg the angel for forgiveness, for another chance to do this right. But when he makes it to the table, expecting or at least hoping, to find Castiel there, he’s greeted by a depressing sight.
When Dean returns to the bunker, he finds himself smack dab in the middle of what appears to be a Hallmark movie. Bing Crosby is playing through a set of shotty speakers, there’s red and green tinsel, and what appear to be hand-cut paper snowflakes, covering the entirety of the map table, and on Sam’s laptop, a virtual crackling fire is on loop. Once his nose catches up to his eyes and ears, he’s hit with a scent that causes him to salivate: pie. Apple with a heap ton of cinnamon to be exact. Dean doesn’t know whether he should pinch himself or turn around, get back into Baby, and drive away.
“I mean it, Dean. It’s like yin and yang at work. He’s awkward, reserved, and somehow still innocent, while you’re crass and loud with a tough-exterior. And when you’re apart, both of you suffer somehow. But together… balance is restored. And even without the profound-bound-created-in-hell-by-an-Angel-of-the-Lord, you and Cas—you’re good for each other. And maybe that’s not what you want to hear, but there’s just something…
was different. Dean wasn’t John. Sam, Cas, and Bobby made that clear, even if Dean still struggled to step into his own definition of being a man.
“You’re welcome, Sam. I left a plate out for Dean. It’s a shame he wasn’t feeling well.” Cas responds, not fully succeeding at covering his disappointment, Dean notes with a frown.
need to decide on what to make for dinner. And soon—before Dean’s stomach decides to go rogue and tries to metabolize itself.
While Dean had stumbled over his words and fumbled the ring as he went to slip it on the angel’s slim finger, Cas was the picture of patience and calm. As he recited his vows, Cas spoke with eloquence. Every word dripped with devotion. Dean came close to passing out.
The hunter’s heart and chest expand at the gesture, still so taken aback by the constant consideration Cas doesn’t think twice about offering up. Although Dean heard the command, his need to kiss the angel is stronger. The noise of surprise he evokes from Cas when he draws him in for a brief but hard peck is worth the moment of semi-disobedience.
I'm hoping my efforts to capture Dean's intensity and humor, along with Cas', are working! There's a bit of angst, but some hefty fluff in there, too.
Over all of these years and chapters and moments, juxtaposed by both heartbreak and hell—and now, somehow, peace, Dean has yet to bear witness to Cas’ wings. Beyond an ominous shadow or the quietly shocking proof they exist when a stray jet black feather the length of the hunter’s forearm floats to the ground following one of Cas’ hasty exits, Dean is all but new to their magnificence. Or at least what he envisions them to be. Most of the time, he forgets they exist. Yes, he’s aware Castiel is otherworldly, a warrior with brute force strength, and grace—the color of ocean and ice—running through his body, but more often than not, Dean sees him simply as
Dean drops onto the chair across from Sam and lets his beer clank as it meets the dark wood of the table. He huffs. “I’m scared, Sammy.”
“No, Dean,” chuckles Cas, brushing his thumb along the stubble that dots the apple of Dean’s unshaven cheek. “This is real.
Sam shakes his head and huffs. “You really want me to go there?” Sam hesitates until Dean gives me a firm nod. “Well, first off, you two bicker like a married couple already—”
Dean exhales, and with it, a small laugh escapes. He feels Cas breaking his hold on his wrists and instead of gripping tighter, he allows it. His fear that the angel might be changing his mind is quickly dismissed when Cas’ fingers snake their way into his palms. His hold is both gentle and sturdy and Dean suppresses a shiver at the long-denied comfort and intimacy it stirs up.
Although he doesn’t dare look up to witness Sam’s reaction to his confession, he hears the unmistakable sound of a book closing. He’s certain his brother’s full attention is now directed at him, which causes his jaw to clench. Sure, they’ve had heart-to-hearts over the years, but rarely about romantic love and pining and longing for partnership—and certainly not about this.
Dean thinks. Because then maybe he could instead wake up to find his hips and groin plastered to the backside of a ready and willing Castiel—versus glaring at the shower curtain like it’s personally wronged him.
So now, as he wanders through the kitchen, heading toward the backyard, Dean’s mind ruminates on the inclusion of the garden.
As for the honeymoon, well, they’re still on it. Except instead of some far-off getaway, the pair is shacked up in a humble house with a front porch and a generous garden that Jack and Cas had designed and erected well before Dean even arrived at his slice of paradise. The garden wasn’t something Dean expected, never one to have the patience to watch delicate plants or his food grow from seed to flower to fruit. When he had arrived, Bobby, who led the welcome wagon, told him that everything in existence had been suited to Dean. Here, Dean’s likes and dislikes were essentially the showrunners.
“Dean, look at me,” his throaty voice had rumbled into the stale air of their dimly lit kitchen. The tug-of-war happening inside of Dean had snapped to a halt at the summoning tone. When his eyes met Cas’, they weren’t their usual sky-on-a-cloudless-day blue; they were jet black like a demon’s without the chilling coldness.
The words rang out in the hunter’s head as he watched the rescued angel acclimate to the present moment. In some sense, they were alive. In every sense, they were together.
Dean feels a wave of curiosity and underlying jealousy flare up in his belly when it dawns on him that Cas, for however long, has been keeping this discovery to himself. He tries to stomp out the sparks before they can catch but his smart mouth is quicker. “So why am I just seeing them now then?” He regrets vocalizing the question as soon as he asks, noticing the way Cas tenses and drops his gaze. “Hey,” he coos, adjusting his tune, “I’m not mad. I just—you can tell me stuff,” he finishes with a shy shrug.
Cas swallows and then opens his mouth in explanation. “You didn’t pray, no. But lately, our connection has been stronger. I-I can hear your thoughts more clearly.”
Sobs threatened to claw their way out of Dean’s throat at the confession but his resolve to shove them down wins out. Instead of relief or joy, he’s overwhelmed by the belief that he’s not good enough to be on the receiving end of basically anything when it comes to Castiel. He shakes his head and looks at the almost raven-haired man before him with tears in his eyes.
“Dean Winchester, it’s absurd just how wrong you are. And I will argue that until the day you grow old and perish, and even then I’ll find you in the next realm and I’ll start again.” Cas declares, stepping forward with his hands balled into fists at his side. “You may be stubborn and reckless and intense, but you are so much more. You contain multitudes, Dean. To think of yourself as one-dimensional is a crime I will not let you commit. Not on my watch.” He states, head shaking. “How dare you say or think you are impossible to love. You are loved, rightfully so, by many, including me. And you give that love back without hesitation in ways others fail to fathom. I consider myself lucky to stand in your presence, and I would truly consider myself unworthy of
After five minutes of slick, rhythmic tugs, Dean’s ministrations grow rushed and his breath exchanges in short, wet pants. With one more slide of his hand, he comes, grunting the angel’s name in a whisper. Before he can work to catch his breath, evidence of his release washes away as if it were a fever dream.
Castiel is in the very center of the garden. Wildflowers and dense green plants that nurture developing fruit surround him in a delicate yet bold display of growth and tenderness. The angel is sitting on his hunches, not a stitch of clothing to be found. Dean takes note of how his olive skin is contrasting with the purples, blues, pinks, and greens of the garden. But Cas’ state of undress isn’t what’s causing Dean’s mouth to fall agape. No, it’s the set of iridescent wings that are resting undisturbed against Cas’ bare and broad back.
After the kid had successfully managed to pull off a rescue mission of sorts, Jack returned a thought-to-be-lost Castiel to the place he knew he was most needed, the place he knew he would be loved. Dean’s version of Heaven.
“Blasphemy,” Cas huffs, shying away from the compliment. As the angel stands to clear the table, removing any and all evidence of their indulgent snack, Dean knows it’s now or never.
Cas stares, unmoving. As if he’s holding his breath, waiting to see if Dean has figured out this divine puzzle.
“He covered for me,” Dean sighs, watching the angel closely, hoping something other than disappointment and perplexion will make its way across Cas’ features. “You can be mad, Cas.”
Dean chokes and tries to disguise it as a cough. He silently hopes the heat from the shower is a good enough excuse for the blush that’s, much to his dismay, rising to his cheeks.
As he pulls back a second time, albeit a smaller amount, he rests his forehead against Cas’, grinning mostly to himself at the turn of events. “Best Christmas ever, sweetheart.”
In addition to the exchange of air, he hears the sound of his own heartbeat gaining volume. He can hear Cas’ voice too, as he continues to speak, a look of longing and sympathy plastered to his features, well aware of the hunter’s internal monologue. Dean listens to all of it, overwhelmed but also hanging on to every word because he’s terrified of blacking out.
Dean stands dumbfounded, stuck in place as he watches Sam stroll around the Impala to pop the trunk, retrieve his duffel bagel, and sling it over his right shoulder. As the taller brother rounds the car, he stops where Cas is still sitting in the backseat and motions for the angel to crack the door open. The two exchange a fair amount of words, none of which Dean can make out. After a minute or two, Sam departs and beelines it for his room and offers a curt nod to his brother.
Dean’s stomach grumbles again but this time something deeper in his gut heats up at Cas’ use of a nickname. “Don’t have to tell me twice, partner.” He quips with mock machismo, attempting to hide even a spark of arousal.
Dean feels sweat gathering on the nape of his neck and notices how dry his mouth has suddenly become. Since when did it get so stuffy in here? He wants to bolt from the knowingness of his brother’s gaze, but he's aware that’ll be even more telling so he just holds his ground. He fishes for something to say but before he can utter a single word, Sam is returning to the old text laid out in front of him.
“What we have, Dean, is beautiful. I know you believe that, too. But I need you to be 100% here with me versus stuck in there,” Cas says, hand reaching up to press the pad of his pointer finger into Dean’s temple. “There’s no need to rush, either. I would wait a millennium for you.”
Before Cas can elaborate, there’s a firm knock at the door. “Yeah?” Dean grunts in response, patience wearing thin.
Just when he thinks he’s dodged a bullet and can breathe a sigh of relief, Sam pipes up again. “Figure it out, Dean. He’s someone special.”
Dean lets his arm fall and shoves the mistletoe into the pocket of his jeans, so he can grab Cas around the back of the neck and coax him into a more passionate exchange. The angel gasps and grips the sides of Dean’s shirt in surprise. Instead of teeth, Dean’s tongue swipes into Cas’ mouth to explore. He groans at the way the slightly shorter man melts further into him, happy to hold the typically stoic creature upright.
“Shouldn’t the honeymoon phase still be in full effect?” Sam mumbles, curiosity and concern peaking.
When Cas turns to head back into the kitchen, Dean’s eyes notice a floury handprint on the back of the angel’s slacks. He groans and laughs simultaneously. Cas ushers him to the fridge where there’s a plethora of holiday-themed brews. His head spins as the Angel of the Lord spews names and types and the hints of flavors he can expect to find in each.
Before the two can continue their hushed bickering session, Cas hands Sam a glorious looking plate that causes Dean’s empty stomach to grumble.
They’re more breathtaking and majestic and kickass than Dean ever expected. He can’t help the gulp that follows as he sways in place, transfixed by the scene before him. “This can’t be real,” he says mostly to himself.
The tension within the confines of the Impala is palpable. Between the way his jaw is set tight to how his shoulders are hiked up near his ear lobes, he’s certain Sam can sense it. Even without looking at Cas in the backseat. Dean grits his teeth and this time he does pray—not for or to Castiel—but for Sam to remain silent on the matter. His hopes, however, are null and void, when he notices his brother shifting in his seat to glance back and eye the angel in curiosity before returning to face the open road through the windshield.
The hunter’s heart swells without his explicit permission. Dean groans. At least once a day Dean wonders how he landed here, in heaven, with a damn angel by his side. How? How did Dean Winchester “the ultimate killer”—as Chuck had said—not only find his little slice of paradise but get to live it out, for eternity, with Castiel, wings and grace and all, in the passenger seat?
do. So sue me for needing to release some tension in what I assumed was the privacy of the shower. So unless you’re here to lend a—”
“Talk to me, sweetheart. Ya feelin’ good?” Dean has no clue where this bravado is coming from, but he feels like he’s flying, like he’s the one with the wings and the ability to make magic happen. If he wasn’t hellbent on cataloging the texture and weight of every single feather he’s busy exploring, you could convince him this was the makings of the best damn wet dream.
The hunter swallows but nods his OK, inching closer. About a foot in front of Cas, Dean moves to lower himself to the ground, his bottom connecting with the somewhat dewy grass, legs crossing to mimic that of a pretzel. He suddenly feels silly realizing he’s sitting like a kindergartener at storytime eager to find out what the teacher is going to read today. Cas, on the other hand, looks both gentle and stoic. Dean feels like a mere peasant who has been honored with a face-to-face meeting with a damn deity.
he could hear John say as he tried to swallow back tears. He feels those same tears threatening to spill once again, but this time, instead of holding them in, he lets them breach the threshold and fall. But before Cas can see just how broken and pathetic he already is, he turns for the door and rushes out into the night.
The act of undressing, of stripping one another bare shouldn’t continue to make Dean’s cheeks heat up but it does—especially now, outside in the open as the sun dips below the horizon leaving a faint orange glow in its wake. The process is slow but far from unpleasant, Castiel taking his damn good time unlacing Dean’s boots and caressing the skin of his ankles and feet as he frees them. When Cas traces the arch of his sensitive foot, the hunter is successful in suppressing a giggle that threatens to escape, but soon an indigent moan breaks loose when the angel slides his hand up the inside of his thigh to cup his groin. “Shit,” he huffs.
Dean eyes him suspiciously. Sam throws his hands up. “We’ve got work to do tomorrow. You and Cas?” He pauses. “Well, you’ve got work to do tonight. Good luck.”
Cas swallows and his eyes shift away and from Dean for a second before reconnecting to his gaze with renewed determination. “Because I love you and your happiness is important to me.”
The one where Dean is a little reckless, John Winchester is a douche (even beyond the grave), and Castiel is there to save the day.
As the suds of his shampoo cascade down his body and toward the shower drain, Dean allows his right hand to snake its way closer and closer to the erection that lies thick and neglected between the v of his groin. He feels like a damn teenager again, unable to keep his hands from his crotch for more than a handful of hours at a time. But Dean’s been suffering from some serious sexual frustration and far too many cases of blue balls lately. Four weeks have passed since they kissed in the bunker’s kitchen. Four weeks since he let himself embrace his bond with Cas on a whole other level. And in those four weeks, they’ve maybe engaged in some heavy petting at best in the dark confines of his bedroom. And yeah, Dean appreciates the consideration. He’s new to this, to having a male counterpart on the other end, but in a month’s time, he’s yet to get his rocks off by efforts outside of his own. Sure, he’s had one or two minor breakdowns over somewhat coming to terms with his sexuality along the way—Sam says it’s something called “bisexual”—but if he and Cas don’t sprint to a new base soon, he’s going to be cashing in his one-way ticket toward another sort of meltdown.
“The garden is for you, Cas,” Dean whispers, tilting his head up to meet the angel’s gaze. “And the kid knew my heaven wouldn’t be complete without you.”
The angel’s face shifts, creased brow softening and mouth falling into a melancholy frown. He moves from his place on the edge of the bed and strides toward Dean and reaches for his hand when he’s close enough. Cas brings Dean’s knuckles to his mouth and presses his lips to the flesh. Dean shivers involuntarily at the contact.
The angel leans forward and pecks his open lips. The move is comforting but also so damn shy that it makes Dean’s insides twist with affection. The look on Cas’ face is a glorious combination of excitement and trust. A small part of Dean wants to argue that he’s not worthy of
Every chair is empty. And the room, while still decorated to the nines, exudes the air of a party that ended far too early or never even got the chance to happen. He spots a plate of food at the head of the table and sighs. He thinks of all the work Cas put into the night, from preparing dish after dish, whipping up dessert, and turning the bunker into a holiday snowglobe—and all of it simply to make Dean smile. And he didn’t show because he was too afraid to face the possibility of happiness and let someone else put him first.
Following one more quick rinse for good measure, he steps out of the steam-filled shower and yanks a seemingly fresh towel from the rack to dry off. But before he can so much as press the pilling, absorbent material to his skin, his attention is jolted forward at the sound of someone clearing their throat.
Dean can’t help but notice the concern in Cas’ voice as if Dean’s reaction is of the utmost concern. He knows Cas knows that Christmas is special to Dean, but this over-the-top display can’t be for him,
“Cas,” he hollers into the twilight. After a beat or two, his attention is drawn to a fast-approaching, bounding Miracle. Dean leans down to greet the shaggy white dog with an affectionate head scratch. “Where’s Cas, pal? You seen him?”
“Hello, Dean,” Cas says, breaking the silence but not the bubble of purity that surrounds him. The angel cocks his head, motioning with his chin for Dean to come closer.
Their reunion was hesitant. Dean’s heart had thudded at an alarming rate but he stood stock-still, unsure of what to say or do. It was the first time he had seen Cas since the angel sacrificed himself to save Dean, complete with a love confession that ended in a rush of tears and the hunter wanting to claw out his own heart so he didn’t have to feel.
Bobby officiated in his gruff voice as tears threatened to fall. A broad smile never left Sammy’s goofy face as he stood next to Dean. A beaming Charlie made failed attempts at suppressing giddy laughter as she watched what was a no doubt lovestruck expression play out across Dean’s features from where she stood behind Cas. And Jack, he had bounded gleefully down the makeshift aisle between just a few rows of occupied folding chairs to deliver their respective gold banded rings.
Unconditional, I’ll-wait-until-you’re-ready love? Wide-open feelings and vulnerability, those were the things of Dean’s nightmare, because when he wore his heart on his sleeve, he had grown to expect that it would be squashed or spat on.
“I am a little hurt but more so confused. From what I’ve gathered, you like the holiday of Christmas, and I know you enjoy eating, and you seem to tolerate my company, so why would you lie to avoid a combination of those things?”
He doesn’t like the idea of Sam crashing alone when they’re on a case, especially one that involves demonic activity. But he has to remind himself that Sam isn’t his helpless, naive little brother anymore. Yes, he’s still hopeful, forgiving, and a little too optimistic for Dean’s taste, but he’s capable, tough, and a hell of a lot smarter than he is. Plus, he knows Sam is attempting to help by staying out of the way of whatever the hell is going on between him and Cas.
“Cas,” he all but whispers, letting his feet carry him toward the counter where the angel’s back is facing him.
As his mind reels, Dean brings his right hand up to his left bicep and squeezes. Although faded, the mark of the angel, his angel, always manages to ground him in the midst of external, and currently internal, chaos. The action reminds Dean to breathe and as he does, he imagines Cas’ hand in place of his own. A calm and yet claiming gesture that sends shivers through his body.
By the time Dean’s boots connect with the spongy support of the grass, his curiosity over the garden is replaced by his desire to locate Cas. The sun is on the verge of setting and he’s hungry, and somehow, in the magic of this place, Castiel’s taste buds have come alive. So with more than one palate to consider,
In that very moment, Dean is beyond grateful he hasn’t taken another sip of his beer. Otherwise, he’s reasonably certain he would have choked on it or spewed it unceremoniously across the room. He tries his best to rein in the blush he feels spreading through his cheeks while thinking of a response.
The eldest Winchester brother laughs. Against his better judgment, Dean decides to clarify. “What I meant was that you’re special and kind and… thank you. Thank you for all,” Dean gestures to the holiday explosion, “of this.”
For the next two hours—but what feels like an eternity—he tosses and turns in his bed as his emotions mimic the discomfort and anxiety coursing through his body. From one moment to the next, Dean is caught on a spectrum that slides unstably from anger, directed at himself and others, to hope and longing for even a chance at happiness with Castiel.
“Some gentle, elderly lady on the internet—who claims to make the very best meatloaf in the world. Which seems boastful, but she had a kind face so I’m hopeful,” Cas shares. “I also followed her apple pie recipe.”
That’s all the encouragement the gruff hunter needs before plunging his fingers into the feathers. The gasp Cas releases is one of the most beautiful things Dean has ever heard, and he struggles to decide if he wants to make it happen again or swallow it down greedily. A pronounced shiver wracks Cas’ form when the retired hunter cards his hardened fingers through the iridescent wings. Dean groans when the callouses adorning the pads of his digits, from decades of digging up both ancient and fresh graves, catch on the edges of certain feathers. The stark contrast between weathered skin and far-too soft down makes his throat go dry and his groin twitch.
Before the other man can respond, another voice echoes through the bunker. “A Christmas explosion,” Sam huffs. Dean notes the lack of malice in his little brother’s voice and chuckles.
Minus Dean’s genuine moans over how delicious the pie is, they eat in relative silence. Although he wants to say more and make an attempt at conveying his gratitude for Cas’ efforts, he’s enjoying the quiet company. But he knows he’ll have to swallow his nerves and make a more obvious and concerted attempt at apologizing for his abrupt absence earlier.
Dean’s cock that lies between them dribbles precum and twitches on his belly as he reaches forward to bury his spread and greedy hands into the soft down. The urgency and carnal tugs seem to spur the angel’s hips into motion. A throaty grunt is pulled from Cas’ throat when a particularly deep thrust is matched with a particularly rough clutch of feathers. Any lingering doubt that the feathers aren't an erogenous zone flees Dean’s mind.
Dean wracks his brain for a witty comeback but comes up short, train of thought derailed by what the angel states next.
Dean waits for another order but the angel’s stare is steadfast, patient yet demanding. “Fine,” the hunter whines like an annoyed child. “You. I want you. I want to touch you. I want to feel you. Dammit, Cas. Come on,” he finishes, wrapping his legs around his husband’s torso in defiance and desperation.
“No!” Dean breathes out, zero hesitation to be found in his voice. “They’re incredible, Cas,” he admits, eyes performing a very obvious once-over. Dean’s gaze flicks back to his husband’s face just in time to notice the subtle blush that’s beginning to color his cheeks. The angel’s involuntary reaction gives Dean an ego boost like a shot of liquid courage and he runs with. “Can I?” he asks, calloused hand reaching toward the glimmering appendages.
While his hands wrap around the angel’s form in search of the downy feathers, his lips find Cas’ plush mouth. Although he feels utterly out of control with desire, he’s able to keep his touches, even on just skin, soft and gentle. Maybe it’s his nerves winning out, but whatever the case, he’s fine with it. Grateful even. When he reaches the edges of the wings, he hesitates, breath growing ragged.
The proposal, and the bare-bones ceremony, had been far from a grand gesture—what the angel truly deserved—but it was so very
The nod Cas gives is subtle enough to miss, but Dean of course is eyeing him like a hawk. However, before his hand can continue its journey now that he has permission, the angel’s low and gravel-like voice demands his full attention. “They’re sensitive."
With one more spoonful of the divine dessert, Dean is satiated. He looks down at his plate and is tempted to lick the leftover globs of whipped cream and crumbs from the crust off of it, but he somehow reins himself in. The spoon in his hand clatters against the plate and he leans back to place a heavy palm on his even heavier stomach. “You outdid yourself, man.” He declares looking up to see Cas gazing affectionately at him.
“Seems a little cocky, don’t you think?” Dean quips with a smirk, enjoying the easy banter that works to cloak any lingering anxiety.
The brief but vulnerable conversation ended in a tangle of lips and limbs. And at some point, in a rush of adrenaline or to Dean, what felt like clarity, the hunter asked for more than he ever thought he’d possess the courage to do. “Marry me,” he had whispered, both a question and a suggestion.
Aside from a single ten-minute stop at a Gas-N-Sip for fuel for Baby, mixed nuts for Sam, peanut m&m’s for Cas, and a couple of sticks of beef jerky for him, they make it to the motel just outside of Little Rock without any issue. As Dean puts the Impala into park, Sam unbuckles his seat belt and reaches for the door handle. “I’ll go grab us rooms.”
He tells Cas to surprise him and when he takes a sip of the festive drink, he’s pleasantly surprised as a lightly spiced ale dances across his taste buds.
The smile Cas expresses is small but it reaches his eyes. He grabs for one of Dean’s hands and pulls it to his chest, just over his heart. “Yes, Dean. The garden is for me but I’m here for you.”
Dean is certain he must be exuding a state of panic already but before he can stop his feet from moving, he finds himself pacing a strip of the cold kitchen floor.
At that, Dean’s knees had nearly buckled. He was fairly certain he had never been so turned on in his life—until now.
“We do—have ‘needs’,” Cas interrupts, fingers offering somewhat pathetic air quotes around the last word, blue eyes glued to the bathroom floor.
“Well, you’re not the occasion itself, but you are the reason for the occasion. Christmas in itself is quite silly, but humans love their holidays and I wanted to make this one special for you.”
His imagination wanders to the angel and he envisions Cas’ long, slightly delicate fingers working him under the spray. He pinches an already hard nipple and moans. “Cas,” he whispers lightly, voice still echoing within the stall.
Although his mouth is dry, Dean is determined to speak, to verbally express just how goddamn breathtaking the being before him is. His own hand lifts and his fingers wrap around Cas’ wrist like an anchor. “Cas,” he breathes out. “You’re beautiful. You’re—is this real? I didn’t die again, did I?”
Once he sees Sam heading back to the car, he opens the door and slips out. Sam tosses him a key. “You two are in room 21, I’ll be in 25.”
“Dean,” Cas says wiping around, quick to forget the rather disastorous kitchen, “You can’t control what your body does…”
“That’s hardly the reaction I was hoping for.” The angel groans. “Where’s your Christmas spirit, Dean?” He questions earnestly.
voice. And it makes Dean quiver, all bravado and smugness shot to hell in a flash. He gulps, trying to pacify his mouth that has very suddenly gone drier than a Nevada desert smack dab in the middle of July. Dean blinks at the being before him, simultaneously taken aback and utterly turned on by how fast Cas has gone from a peaceful, heavenly creature with bees and birds and flowers enthralled by his energy to a damn demanding and authoritative lover who’s unafraid to challenge him.
Once inside the $40-a-night room, Dean notices the two twin beds. He wonders if Sam requested the layout after sensing the tension. He doesn’t know whether to be grateful or annoyed. Just as the door shutters closed with a metallic clang, Dean glances back at Cas. He tosses his gear on the bed closest to the window and crosses his arms across his chest.
Dean shakes his head both in disbelief and in response to his husband’s question. “Everything is perfect, angel,” he croons. “But there is something I need…”
“My mother would probably be disappointed but I’m going to go with the dessert before dinner option,” Dean nods with an uncharacteristically shy smirk.
The bee that was once hovering by Dean’s side has now floated toward the angel. It joins its brethren that are busy circling not only the flowers in need of pollination but the stripped-down being at the very core of it all. It’s as if Cas is the sun, breathing life into the garden, and everything that surrounds him is grateful to be basking in his life-giving presence.
Dean squeezes his eyes shut and lets his hands slip down the length of Cas’ arm until their hold resettles on the delicate skin of his wrists. For a moment, he sways between the angel’s confession, the feel of his fingertips pressing into flesh, and the urge to recoil from the love Cas is offering up so blatantly.
Dean can’t help but roll his eyes at the angel’s display of politeness and pushes past to grab what’s his from the trunk and lock up Baby before they hole up for the night.
“Please don’t, Cas. I’m not worth any of this and I’m certainly not worthy of you.” The angel steps forward, seemingly ready to put a halt to the beginning of Dean’s self-loathing monologue, but the hunter is quick to continue, fearful of losing steam. “I’m crass and stubborn as hell. I'm blinded by anger half the time and I don’t think twice about hurting those who get in my way. I use cockiness to hide all the broken and bruised pieces that make me utterly impossible to love. And the thought of you loving me is terrifying because I know that it’s bound to end in disappointment and heartbreak. I… I don’t want to hurt you any more than I already have, Cas, so please, just...” The words die on his lips and his shoulders crumple at the thought of hurting Cas in the past, present, or future. He doesn’t want to be the reason for Cas’ earthly pain any longer, so the sooner this ends, the better his odds are. He looks up to see the angel's eyes flash and he braces himself.
There’s no malice in it, but that doesn’t stop Dean’s grip on the steering wheel from tightening, knuckles growing impossibly white. “Don’t,” he grits out, side-eying his brother with a gaze he hopes embodies a thousand angel blades. Sam shrugs sheepishly.
The way Sam says the word love without an ounce of hesitation slams into Dean’s chest. As if loving another man isn’t even the hard part. Dean doesn’t know how to do this, how to just get over what he’s been fed by his father, his flesh and blood, since he was a kid.
. The being who protects him, who cares for him, who believes Dean to be righteous and loyal and good.
“The house, the old-man front porch, the roadhouse with an endless supply of cold beer. It all makes sense. It’s all
Dean thinks. The meeting of Dean’s flesh and the wings must surprise Cas too because the feathers rustle excitedly.
The whimper his angel lets escape on a particularly good tug sets off a deep and almost predatory growl that emanates from Dean’s chest and crawls up his throat. Cas’ grip on his shoulders is bordering on painful in the most delicious way, and Dean grunts imaging the indents and bruises that will remain for days to come. “D-dean,” Cas pants between them.
Dean lets out a noise of protest but Sam continues anyway, so he settles for an irritated glare instead.
Cas connects his forehead with Dean’s and nods. This time, the celestial being is the one to plead. “Please, Dean.”
Wet slaps of skin, pants of hot air, and deep grunts fall into rhythm with the whistling breeze, chattering birds, and dull buzzing as the insects around them begin to fall quiet for the night. Dean hears his heart thudding wildly above it all, but he imagines Cas can hear everything loud and clear. He hopes the sound of their lovemaking is harmonious, the crescendo to whatever masterpiece in the making Dean waltz into. He hopes Cas feels loved and wanted and needed, more so than he’s ever been able to convey through words.
The request is somehow daunting. Dean’s head wages a war in the confines of his skull. He wants to peer into those striking azure eyes but he’s afraid of what he’ll see. Sam’s comments from earlier echo through his mind:
“I don’t know if you can say that. It was my first time making pie in this realm so there was nothing to outdo.”
Dean takes a nice long gulp from the beer in his hand to buy himself some time. But when he fails to respond quickly enough for Sam’s liking, he’s met by his brother’s quirked and teasing eyebrow.
That was until tonight. Until Cas went and made somewhat of a grand gesture. Until Sam had enough of his bullshit and called him out. Until he let his poker face fall when called out on said bullshit. Until he actually, for a millisecond, considered admitting how he felt. How he felt about another man.
Cas’ eyes flash up, pinning Dean in place with the heat that’s building behind his gaze. “You think I don’t want you, Dean?” Cas asks incredulously. “I’m holding back because you’re not ready.”
Before he can beat feet and pretend he was never here, Cas is peering up at him, a slow and gentle smile playing at the corners of his mouth. Dean waves lamely.
When Cas’ brow somehow inches a bit higher, Dean knows he needs to find the gumption to speak. “I-I need…” he trails off, feeling a little pathetic.
A heat spreads in Dean’s abdomen and eventually settles in his groin. “Hell,” he huffs out. “Y-you gotta let me, Cas. Please,” he whispers, only audible enough for the other man to hear.
“It seems Jack was able to initiate the process of restoration when he rescued me. First, my grace returned, and more recently, my wings,” Cas explains and gives his wings a little flap. Dean gapes.
He hates that Sam is being vague, he hoped one of them would be brave enough to just spell it out, to state, plain as day, what this profound bound truly is. But as much as he’d rather not sugarcoat it, he can’t find it in himself to say it, so he decides on: “What do you mean by
He knows the vulnerability and rawness of his voice are prominent, and of course it is, he’s essentially alluding to the fact that he, Dean Winchester, son of John Winchester, is not only terrified over matters of the heart but also matters of the heart that involve his best friend—another man.
Without turning, Dean is certain Cas’ eyes are on him. He doesn’t have to see it to know. “What?” He grits out, feeling his confusion and frustration in the form of anger flare up again.
Sam must register the turmoil churning inside Dean because he suddenly has a sickeningly sympathetic look plastered on his face.
"Who says you get to be the big spoon?" he says, needing to cut the tension, and he feels Cas's lips spread into a smile against his hair.
Last night feels so far away from tonight, a whole lifetime apart, like Dean aged forty-two years all over again in the past twenty-four hours. Dean the hunter, and Dean the early retiree, coming together to watch Westerns and Star Wars, surrounded by all the faces that they have left.
"I do. I was -- I'm a coward. Okay?" He splays his hands out and states it like a fact, though Castiel knows that isn't true. "I'm a coward. I didn't -- I couldn't say anything. To you. When you..."
Bobby huffs in his seat and gets up abruptly, tossing his book down before he stomps out of the room. Okay, so maybe this isn't the
. Sam sees it too and he glances between them, looking like he’s about ready to take flight, if he had the wings for it.
okay," Sam insists, giving his shoulder a squeeze, and Dean swallows thickly before he shrugs his brother off.
It all sounded okay, mostly, sort of, in theory when he had Castiel in borrowed boxers and a T-shirt leaning against his chest and brushing kisses to his neck. Now, though, Dean feels hot and suffocated, and he'd really prefer it if Castiel wasn't here to witness this because it makes him feel guilty, on top of everything else. He'd promised, after all.
He slips his phone into his pocket and starts for the elevator, since it deposits him in the back hallway of the department. The hallway's deserted, and he slinks up to the door to the computer room. Since this room hooks onto the lounge, they've turned both into party rooms, but the food's in the lounge so there aren't many people over here. He doesn't think about how the combination lock on this door could foil his entire plan -- after all, Don Félix de Montemayor would hardly be a badass if he struggled with temperamental doorknobs -- but it yields to him, miraculously, and he pulls the door open.
It'd be one phone call. It'd be easy. Cas would bring him his food, no problem. But Cas would come to the main entrance, outside of which Dean eats with his other coworkers who are committed to wide, open, outdoor spaces along with a contingent of students who also seem passionate about fresh air. They fight over tables in the sunshine or the shade, depending on the weather.
It's hard to imagine blurring life in his snow globe with life on the outside, but Bobby's house has always been a safe zone, a bit of a snow globe in and of itself. He'll take that step, at least.
Dean's blood runs ice cold as he clears his throat and brushes past his brother as quickly as he can. He's got a fake smile ready for when Eileen gets there, and he manages to make it through dinner with a few easy laughs and a carefully crafted routine where he just keeps asking questions to keep her and Sam talking, like he's conducting an interview, because that at least he can do comfortably on autopilot. Cas is as quiet and weird as ever, but Dean guesses that's a comfortable autopilot for him too, at least until Cas starts rambling halfway through the cake about the poetic beauty of ant colonies, and he nearly knocks his glass off the table.
Dean flushes, but before he can say anything else, Cas is against his ear, murmuring, "Tócame. Adesso." He pulls back, eyes glittering, but Dean flips them both over before he can be too satisfied with himself.
"He's the one that goes out with a big 'fuck you' to everyone," Dean counters, lowering his voice automatically. "God, the devil -- Félix just thumbs his nose at all of 'em. Tells 'em all to fuck off." The swearing has brought him a step closer to Castiel; that, and the secretary just squeezed behind him to get at the cookies. He's in Castiel's space now, closer than he would like, but they're not
Everyone's occupied by the time Dean finishes his lunch, and he gently, as if it's the easiest thing in the world, sets his hand over Cas's on the bricks between them. Cas glances over at him, then gives a small smile and slips his thumb over the back of Dean's hand, then jumps back into his discussion. Dean finds himself caught between the two tables, each one in the middle of something Dean doesn't particularly care about, but that lets him drift off, try to calm the racing of his heart, and try to appreciate the possible simplicity of standing here with Cas with the bright light of the sun shining down on them.
“I just want this to be—awesome.” It’s the best he can salvage under awkward circumstances, but Castiel seems grateful anyway.
Castiel blinks, refocuses on Dean, and Dean holds back a chuckle at the fear flickering in his eyes. “I do not want to go to another Den of Iniquity.” He lowers his voice, leaning closer to Dean, and Dean can’t stop laughing this time.
Castiel has his hands in the pockets of the jeans they bought for him, wearing a flannel shirt that Dean threw into the basket for him when he wasn’t picking anything out. Dean still hasn’t gotten used to him without his trench coat, and he’s cracked a few jokes about it, but secretly he doesn’t find it that funny. Castiel just doesn’t look like himself, and it only compounds the whole thing where Castiel doesn’t
After, they bump elbows as they do the dishes, sneaking glances at one another, until eventually they're sharing a smile, back and forth, every time they touch, and Dean's filling up with a feeling that he's hesitant to name because it feels like happiness, like giddiness, like a goddamn teenager who snuck his boyfriend in while his parents were out, except Dean didn't really get to have that kind of thing, and instead now he's a 40-year-old man, dead, standing in Heaven with the angel that he's asked to stay with him for the rest of time, and Dean isn't sure what to do with himself.
, and by the time Bobby is joining them, Dean still hasn't heard one single negative word. Again -- not like he thought he
"I've been helping people. Little good deeds here and there. The owner of this place was alone, and dying." Cas looks down at the table, a soft sadness in his eyes. "She needed someone to keep her company until the end. And I promised I would look after things for a little while, make sure the new owner wouldn't make a 'mess of things.'" There are no actual air quotes, but Dean can almost hear this ghost of a woman in Cas's voice just then. "He's letting me stay at her apartment for the time being."
It doesn't shatter. Dean meets him this time, matching his emotion, and suddenly there are teeth here and there, and a breathless kind of need before they need to resurface. When they do, Castiel is laughing again, and after a moment of insecurity, Dean is too. Castiel leans in, his forehead against Dean's neck, and he's clinging to Dean and laughing at the impossibility of all of this.
Dean leans in and lowers his voice conspiratorially. "That's how you know copiers are evil," and he adds a wink.
"Yeah. What did you mean?" Dean immediately feels like a 14-year-old girl about to braid someone's hair again, and he practically scowls to himself. Cas is across from him, frowning now, his eyes narrowed. It's a familiar look, and Dean knows it well.
“Wow, that guy can really take a pounding,” Dean murmurs, and he fidgets, pulling from his beer again.
“Dean, I don’t. It doesn’t matter to me at all.” At Dean’s raised eyebrow, Sam relents, shrugging. “Well, okay, maybe I was a little
"I don't know." Castiel wears exasperation well -- though Dean thinks he wears most emotions well. "My car has stopped working, and it isn't the battery."
Sam and Eileen make their exit as Cas heaps another happy anniversary of her birth and a merry rest of her mortal existence onto her before they manage to flee up the steps. Cas is slumped over on the table by then, head down, and Dean scrubs his hand over his face. This really isn't how he envisioned his next significant encounter with Cas, but here he is, looping Cas's arm around his neck and helping him up out of his chair.
Maybe it isn't very hot that the first time Dean sees Castiel without any pants on isn't before sex, but it approaches something like 'romantic' before Dean starts backing wildly away from trying to figure this moment out.  They slide under the covers and share another kiss, gentle and soft.
He turns out the kitchen light, and he slides into bed with Castiel; he tangles himself with blankets and sheets and Castiel's legs, and he falls asleep to the sound of Castiel's breathing, soft and steady beside him.
Smiling, satisfied, Sam grabs a spatula and tosses it to him. "Then help me make breakfast, and then we can go home."
He isn’t really paying attention to what he sees on the TV screen though because of what he thought he heard when he leaned over Castiel just now. It was faint, but it sounded like a small gasp, something that Castiel’s taken to doing now, maybe a side effect of his slow slide to humanity, but usually it takes a special occasion. What was particularly special about Dean reaching over him, he can guess, but he’d rather not.
He could drop this. He could clear his throat, wave the waiter down, get their check and roll out of here. But--there's a part of him that's burning up to talk about all this, and sure, he has Charlie, but there are some things that he doesn't really want his pseudo-sister's advice on.
He doesn't deserve that now, though, of course. He almost just killed Cas for worse reasons than Cas had to almost kill Dean, this last time and the one before that, and anyway, that's a fucked up basis for a relationship, isn't it?
"Sorry, I've got enough crap to study right now. I'll save the emotional seminar for next fall," he shoots back, and Sam rolls his eyes, and things almost seem... okay, between them.
It's right about now that Dean realizes what he should've known, what he maybe knew in the back of his mind, as soon as he finished his conversation with Garth. He couldn't give Cas an answer this morning because as much as this should be about him and Cas and only him and Cas, Dean's never really imagined his life without Sam in it.
If he doesn't, then nothing changes. If he does, well. Dean's done worse, been worse, than be in love with someone like Cas.
"Sorry," she says, to Castiel and to Dean, and it's sincere; it's in the way her mouth turns down at the corners. "It was just a joke."
God, this is going terribly, and Dean scrubs his hand over his face, trying to think of some way to salvage it, but he thinks he's just going to have to dive in.
Which is all why he's reluctant to question it. And anyway, maybe Castiel doesn't even want to call this anything official. Maybe this is just two guys with fucking amazing chemistry (even denial!Dean can't deny that) who are smart enough to enjoy it while it lasts.
Chuckling, Dean pockets his phone and gets to work, setting about replacing the alternator, which involves a lot of little things needing to be connected and parts to keep track of. Currently, that's a big problem because he can't get that teasing look of Gabriel's out of his mind because it was as familiar as Castiel's exasperation. Dean's pretty sure he's teased Sam about a girlfriend or two with a face like that.
Dean stands abruptly, glowering at Sam, and he makes for the bathroom. He doesn’t want to have this talk with his little brother while he still has half a boner, while he can still practically taste Castiel, and his neck’s still warm from where Castiel had been touching him.
Dean is aware of Cas's inhale as he sneaks a hand up his shirt again, nails grazing the delicate skin of his stomach, dragging up his side and back down again. He's pleased when Cas's hand drifts up, palm flat against him, steady, steadying, as Dean dips down to mouth at Cas's throat, mixing teeth and tongue, chasing that sharp inhale again as he figures out what makes Cas tick.
And then Castiel’s on his feet, and he sets a hand on the back of Bobby’s neck before he pulls him close and kisses him too. Dean only realizes his eyes are wide and unblinking when they start to go dry, and he can’t even manage a laugh at the look on Bobby’s face, even though Sam is rolling with laughter in his chair.
"Where's Sam?" he asks, and Dean tries not to read too much into the question even though it makes him need to remind himself to breathe for a second.
He moves away immediately, turning back around and mumbling a thanks. Normally, Castiel might say that it was nothing, but the slope of Dean's shoulders tells him that it wasn't nothing.
. His eyes fly open and Castiel is looking at him with a mixture of confusion and hope. He brushes his thumbs over Castiel’s hip bones, and the faint, barely-there inhalation is enough of an answer for Dean.
. He’d barely begun to even entertain the idea that he wants to sleep with Castiel at all, and now here he is, threatening to knock Dean’s beer out of his hand as he leans against Dean.
"Really, Señor? You play?" Jack asks, all happiness and light. The kids are all looking at him now, and Dean is intensely aware of the power of their observational skills; that is, spotty. He's almost positive that this little display will begin and end right here, with no gossip following anyone back inside, when he catches Claire looking between him and Cas and their hands, evaluating. She smiles, but Dean senses it's something more private than that, not meant for Dean, who surely is an adult and doesn't need to see reminders that queer people can live full, happy lives, can grow up, can lounge outside work, eating lunch with their partners, free and easy.
"Anyway," he says thickly, pressing on, "Bobby had us move in with him, but his stipulation was that I had to go to college. Probably under any other circumstance I would've said fuck no," Dean says, huffing a humorless laugh, "but he caught me at a weak moment."
Dean's saved from fumbling through an appropriate follow-up sentence in Spanish by the lecture series director introducing the first speaker. Thankfully today they're all focusing on Spanish literature; at the conference in Dean's first semester, there'd been a paper in Italian, so he spent 15 minutes comparing Italian pronunciation to Spanish and trying to imagine how a word was spelled based on his limited understanding of Italian words.
"Yes, Lucifer. My mother is a religious studies professor. A top scholar in the field, actually. Haven't you ever wondered about my name?" When Dean relents and nods, Castiel chuckles. "Michael is an obvious choice for a first born, and after that Mom really wanted to name her next son Lucifer. Gabriel was a surprise. If you recall, Gabriel was the one who came to Mary to tell her of the pregnancy."
"Thanks for the coffee, Cas," he starts to say, starts to head for the door, but Cas is moving behind him.
"Then you," Dean says, leveling a finger at Castiel, and their eyes hold, and Dean swears there's something crackling somewhere because he can practically hear it, "are weird."
Dean missed the person working here because of the dildos, yes, but also because he's in a corner off to the side, surrounded by cardboard boxes. There's dust smudged on his nose, and his hair has fallen over his forehead, and his eyes--a bright, piercing blue--look out from underneath with a steady, almost unblinking gaze.
“No, stop—” Castiel needs twenty seconds to compose himself enough to talk, and in those twenty seconds, Dean feels like someone threw him into a pond and told him that there may or may not be flesh eating piranhas inside, but give the person twenty seconds to tell him one way or the other.
"I sense this rage comes from more than just the door," Castiel says hesitantly as he sits again in front of the other computer, and Dean tenses.
, come to that. They haven't said anything, but Dean knows it's there, knows it runs both ways; there's a connection, and it's deep, and the extent to which Castiel manages to penetrate him (not like that -- not yet, anyway) still makes him a little nervous.
"Jesus," Castiel exhales behind him, and his shoes scrape across the linoleum. "Fine. If you're going to let that stop you, then fine." Castiel's walking to the door, and Dean feels each step reverberate through him, jolting the nerves in his stomach. He holds tight to his anger and whirls around.
"Nice," Dean says with a smile, and they both drift back into productivity. The reality check of him and Castiel being a thing -- like, a
When Cas's hand closes around his cock, though, Dean freezes. Up until now, he'd managed to dodge Cas's touch on his cock, somehow, and he was fully aware that that couldn't last forever. It was just going to get kind of conspicuously weird if he kept that up, but then he didn't let himself think about keeping this going in any kind of explicit way. Still, though, Dean's not entirely prepared for it, and Cas stops, looking up the length of Dean's body.
He stays still as Cas picks up the bowl, moves closer, and puts it back on his lap. They aren't close enough to be touching yet, but Dean is distinctly reminded of first dates, shy teenagers; he remembers, suddenly and with a deep pang, a time when he sat side-by-side with a boy who deserved more than Dean could give him then because he was just a kid with a lot of living left to do, and a long road before he could be okay with something like this.
kind of moment, where they stare at each other and take in the fact that they live on opposite sides of the country, and how sometimes that really, really sucks, before Dean can't take it anymore.
. If Dean's going to have a huge breakthrough about his big gay crisis, or whatever, he'd rather it be on his own terms, preferably with a power ballad in the background, maybe in front of dramatic scenery. He didn't really want it handed it to him along with his ass in his kitchen with the scent of cooling sausage hanging heavy in the air.
"This place... Near as I can guess, it's an amplifier. Everything that makes you human is still there, but everything is just a little more...
"Jimmy wore a lot of layers. It's cumbersome sometimes," he says, and then digs out a pair of pajama pants.
"What's up, Sammy?" Dean's voice is gruff because that's how he's been handling these questions, and Sam accepts it, which is pretty fucking painful because Dean knows it's under the assumption that just divining that Dean is dating someone is enough. He doesn't need more detail because Dean'll tell him eventually, when it becomes important, when they get beyond these teasing stages.
But that's not a thought he wants to have as Cas backs up to his bed. Better to worry about the here and now. Better to worry about what Dean has now before it's gone again.
Castiel shuts the door behind him and stalks into Dean's apartment like he owns it, and Dean clenches his jaw as he trails after him.
"Uh, yeah, I don't..." He clenches his jaw and thinks about how he should have an easy answer for that. That he's not gay, but it's not like he feels
This time, Dean hears the footsteps approaching, and Castiel does too; he sighs heavily, his lips a thin line, and both of them wait while the person turns down a different row and drags the chair for her carrel across the floor. Castiel regards the shelf and plucks a book, the picture of calm, but more like a lake after a rock's been dropped into it; he's vibrating with emotion, and it tears through his act.
The brothers start cleaning up, and Castiel drifts outside, needing the wide open air, needing to take a breath without inhaling gunpowder, salt, whiskey. His back is to the door when it opens, as he knew it would, as he'd been almost counting the seconds before he heard the creak of the hinges.
He draws Castiel's thumb farther into his mouth, between his teeth, and he bites it gently while Castiel's eyes flicker shut and open again, breathing slowly. He pulls his thumb free, lets his fingertips trail down Dean's neck, and draws Dean up into a kiss. Dean's cock slots against Castiel's hip, and he rolls their hips together, earning a gasp from Castiel that breaks their kiss. He reaches for the shelf on his multipurpose headboard, the one that's usually always obscured by an only occasionally necessary pillow, and he comes back with a box of condoms and a bottle of lube. Castiel arches his eyebrow, but his hand slides low over Dean's back, and despite the layer of sweat and the humidity between them, Dean shivers.
Maybe Dean dozes, maybe he doesn't; all he knows is that there's some vague passage of time with his nose buried in Cas's hair, enough that he starts to get a chill again, that his arm starts to go to sleep, that Cas is tracing symbols over his skin and Dean thinks about asking him what he's writing, and then decides that talking is overrated.
"Did you think I was lying just to come over here and break your car?" he says with a smirk into the engine.
"One thing my dad did do," Dean says, finding the words bubbling up out of nowhere, "is fix up the Impala with me."
He flops into bed hoping the wine will pull him to sleep, but he gets dragged into a confused assembly line of thoughts, nearly all of which focus on how amazing Castiel is and how much it freaking sucks that he isn't in Dean's bed right now, but it isn't even the sex thing. It's the way Castiel fits against him and is considerate with the blankets, even when he's unconscious and snoring a little but in a breathy-not-too-annoying way. And when Dean nudges him in the side, he mumbles something that isn't always English (or any other language, for all Dean knows sometimes) before he rolls over.
He chances a glance at Sam, and then finds Castiel’s eyes in the rearview, practically burning two holes in it with their intensity. There’s silence again, as Dean just nods at Sam and focuses on driving, keeping an eye out for deer. There are a long few minutes before Sam speaks, sounding as if he’s about to start laughing.
, ahora, coño." It's fonder now, and he pulls Dean in for a kiss that's as much teeth as it is tongue; he nibbles Dean's lips, draws them into his mouth, licks over them, as he rocks his hips up against Dean's again. "
Overall, beside Castiel not being here, he’s feeling less regretful, less panicked over all this than he thought he would be when he woke up. He was expecting the return of that instinctual need to run away from something as selfish as a relationship that means something to him, but instead, there’s just that anxiety buzzing around his Family Center. What that makes Castiel, he doesn’t know. Boyfriend sounds too feeble, lover too stupid. They just
“Two kisses are better than one.” He shrugs his shoulder and picks up his glass of wine, sips at it, while Sam actually is wiping tears of laughter on the sleeves of his shirt, and Jess is fighting her giggles from behind her hand.
Sure enough, Castiel’s hand finds its way to Dean’s lower back more than once as they slip back out into the crowd, with Dean leading them off to where they last saw Sam, not that he thinks Sam would be there. He should be more eager to find his brother again, but he doesn’t mind a little alone time with Castiel, either. It’s frustrating watching Sam baby him, or frown pitifully at him. He doesn’t need pity.
This moment is fragile, and Dean's afraid of it, afraid of what he'll do with it. He works his mouth and then forces words out this time.
By the time they make it to Dean's room--or is it their room by now?--Dean feels like they've been at this for hours, and they've only just begun to pull at each other's clothing. Cas has taken to wearing button-downs most of the time, and Dean fumbles to undo this one, a bright, pumpkin orange that he'd teased Cas for; he's interrupted by Cas tugging his shirt over his head and then ducking in to mouth over Dean's collarbone. Dean cradles his head for a moment, his eyes sliding shut, as he tries to catch his breath. He remembers back the past few times they've been here, how he dodged Cas's eyes, how he'd hurried them along, and how even when Cas took charge, there was an urgency to everything, a recognition that it was all temporary.
, but Dean was able to point out that he wasn't terribly shy about talking about Cas to his first work friend, Benny, or his second, Charlie, and in fact, Cas has accompanied Dean to their houses when they were invited over for game night or Benny's famous shrimp boils.
"Cas," Sam says behind him, and Dean takes another five steps back because he really hadn't planned for this.
"Don't," he pleads, again. "Don't, please. Just--" He reaches for him, and Cas, through a frown, steps into Dean's embrace. He tries to go for Dean's hand, but Dean cups the back of his head again, fingers lacing into his hair, and convinces Cas to lean into his frame.
Sam sits back down and rubs his hand over his hair, like he's trying to push the situation into his mind in a way that makes sense.
Castiel slides into his seat, and he orders them a couple glasses of wine, and Dean swallows down his nerves as he leans back in his seat.
“Yeah. Just jawing. Catching up. Bobby went on and on about how he’s gonna retire one of these days. It just got me thinking.”
The fact that he has to stay, to stick with this, despite it being fucked up or hopeless, and despite Castiel probably deserving someone who isn’t a total fuck up like Dean, is almost soothing. Yeah, that’s terrifying in a bone-rattling kind of way, but what would be more terrifying is the idea that their relationship would have to be some perfect thing.
His mind is buzzing with all the reasons that Cas doesn't need to link his fingers loosely with Dean and lead him to Dean's room. Number one is the obvious thing that cold clothes don't mean catching cold, followed closely by number two, which is really more of a question: can you get sick in Heaven? Number three, Dean thinks as Cas pulls him close, close enough to start pushing the flannel off his shoulders, is that Cas could probably just touch Dean and whammy the cold and the damp away.
that he'd done it. He'd fought his way in, tore through the Empty, pulled Cas from the nothingness, watched him come back to himself; he'd been so sure he'd pulled Cas out, like Cas did for him, like he owed it to him to do, like he's repaid the debt he's been carrying around for years.
while Castiel shares some choice student errors and it's pushing midnight when Castiel finally leaves, lingering in Dean's space before kissing him softly.
"You mean she didn't question your masculinity," he ventures, and when Dean looks up, he tilts his head and adds, "or your sexuality. She could be trusted with this interest that other people wouldn't have seen the same way. And you enjoyed indulging in it because you knew she liked it too, knowing how good it felt for you."
“I knew turning gay would make you into some kind of Martha Stewart,” Bobby grunts as Dean recaps the Sharpie. These comments aren’t wholly funny to him yet, and he glares up at him for a few seconds before he tosses the Sharpie over to him.
"Nah, I've got a couple of athletes in my first class, and they're alright. I laid down the rules early enough, let them know they're not about to get away with any shit, and I cut 'em off when they try to mouth off. No, what's annoying is my second class.
There's a ring, and another ring. And another. And another. His heart starts to sink before he hears the click, the start of a voicemail message.
"Tell me about it later." He really doesn't need a reminder of Cas, shirt open and knife sticking out of his chest, or of what he and April had gotten up to the night before, not right this particular second.
"He said that he wasn't even sure what his happiness would be until just then," Dean starts, defensive, but Charlie narrows his eyes and gestures impatiently for him to go on. "Because he... He said the one thing he wanted was something he knew he couldn't have. That he was happy just saying it."
“You said the situation was urgent,” Castiel prompts, and Sam seems grateful for a direction to this strange moment. Case first. His brother’s love life later, apparently.
"I'm sorry; I've been busy with settling in." He gestures at the boxes behind him and turns back to Dean. "I appreciate the welcome."
"Are you going to tell me what happened back at the party?" he asks, rounding on Dean. He can never quite get his apartment bright enough; probably he needs a different kind of fluorescent light in his kitchen, but right now his apartment's full of a murky orange glow that makes shadows in the corners and in Castiel's eyes, though Dean's not convinced that's entirely a trick of the light.
by Cas; it's Cas. Sure, this makes things awkward now, and maybe they should have some space from each other for a while, but -- no, that's the end of it. Instead, though, that feeling, leftover from a forever ago when he was a skinny, scared kid in the gym with his father watching him get a little too close to a friend, seems so far away now. Dean's lived a whole lifetime since then -- a couple of them, if you count all the times he died along the way -- and is he the same person as he was then? Does he want to be?
Dean's mouth goes dry, but he reminds himself he's Don Juan and he's going to get Castiel back without almost going to hell to do it.
For about five seconds, Dean's delirious with happiness because his plan had worked, and he'd annoyed Bobby into asking him about his texts, which is pretty hilarious, all things considered. After those five seconds, though, he remembers what the plan was all about, and the smugness drains away. He shrugs, self-conscious suddenly, and slides his phone into his pocket.
even while he’s almost squirming underneath him. Still, he bites back a smile, pressing his lips into a thin line while he gets a grip on himself.
"No," Sam says quickly. Dean's thankful Sam can't see him wince. "No, that isn't it. It's, um. Well, it's something I want to ask you about -- um. About Jess."
." It's his serious voice, all gentleness gone. Dean doesn't really want to turn around, not with the sickness that's curling around his stomach now, but he does, bracing himself for whatever it is that he deserves. "Can we
Castiel chuckles and drags his hand over to the side of Dean's neck, and maybe Dean'd been a bit overeager in the porn star assessment. There's a hesitancy here now that suggests to him that they're wading into territory that Castiel's maybe had less experience with. He's got incredibly hot make-out sessions covered, though.
He stares at Sam's text, something supremely uncomfortable rolling around in his stomach, a striking contrast to how warm and comfortable he is otherwise right now. So he ignores it.
"I'm tryin' to reconcile my grades, but they never click the 'turn in' button. I have no idea what any of them are really missing, and I just don't have the patience to sort it out. Could you email me that FAQ again?"
There's a bell on the door now, and it rings as he steps inside. There aren't any boxes anymore, and there's a proper register, a TV up on the wall, and Castiel picks his head up from where he'd been resting it on his hand to glance at the door. He sits up straighter when he sees Dean.
-- he wants to talk about this after all. Where it feels almost impossible with his brother, with Charlie -- with his sister, maybe, it feels less impossible. "The deal was he could live until he felt a moment of pure happiness, and then the Empty would grab him."
“What a Wonderful World” plays on the TV, and Sam and Jess are kissing, and Bobby’s taking a swig of his drink, when Castiel turns to Dean, an eyebrow raised.
trying this stuff out, he has to work a little harder not to hear Cas's voice in his head, commenting on everything as it happens. Or how he winds up buying some porn just because he needs new, different sounds to occupy his mind, keep himself focused on the task at hand.
Castiel's breath comes out in a huff, and Dean isn't sure if it's from impatience or arousal or what, and Castiel's hand slides over his arm, clutching.
“Sammy’s always in the same room,” is Dean’s soft reply because he isn’t trying to give lip, not exactly. He also knows that that kind of thing would be enough to diffuse some of his dad’s anger, if he says it gently enough, and sure enough, the tension eases in his dad’s shoulders and he sighs.
He hears a sound he hadn't thought he'd ever hear again -- the flutter of wings -- and suddenly there's Cas beside him, smiling, and Dean experiences two things at once; the first is a kind of happiness so intense, so vibrant that it blinds him a little bit and sends him careening into the other thing he's feeling, which is a kind of fear, of uncertainty, of painful anticipation, of unasked questions and unspoken thoughts.
"Can't say the same for you," Dean admits, his lips twitching into a smirk. Castiel laughs, his forehead resting against Dean's temple.
Breakfast is way too easy, with light conversation and Castiel tilting his head at the Today Show, taking everything in like it’s a new gospel. Dean mostly watches him, figuring it’s his turn since Castiel stares at him enough, and just when he starts to think about calling Sam, there’s a knock on his door.
“Look, are you going to make following me everywhere a thing?” he asks fondly, running a finger down her spine and watching her body move to meet him. “Because you’re gonna make my boyfriend jealous.”
"I'll be in my office if you'd like to get lunch later," he says and waits for Dean's nod before he turns around, his overcoat swaying out behind him as he leaves the office.
“Don’t be like that, Bobby.” Jess is up before any of them really knows what she’s doing, and she cups Bobby’s face before leaning in for a kiss. “There,” she says, beaming as she steps away.
He just wants to make it last, to lose himself in the heat of Castiel’s body and the firm line of his mouth for just a little longer, but Castiel’s moans are mounting to short cries, and Dean knows he’s near the edge. He grips Castiel’s cock, and it’s only a few strokes before he looks at Dean, utterly bewildered, and then it hits him, and he’s crying out in pleasure, shaking beneath him. Dean follows almost immediately, and he collapses onto Castiel, sweaty and breathless and exhausted but warmer and happier than he’s been in a while.
Dean drags in a breath, his eyes shut tight. "You know that's not for me, man." He tries to make it into a joke.
Dean hitches a breath and gets up quickly, turning around from the table and facing the stove, if only to put some distance between himself and Sam, long enough to try to get a handle on whatever his face might or might not be doing.
Thankfully, Dean wasn’t in the middle of a sip of beer, otherwise he would look like a fucking cartoon character, spraying beer all over the cheap motel bedspread. As it is, he jerks his head to the side, surprise and a dash of uncomfortable fear in his eyes. There should be a law against angels being allowed to ask questions like that while looking so freaking calm. Dean couldn’t begin to decipher Castiel’s expression beyond curiosity, and maybe that’s all it is.
something. It's then he realizes that he wants to; he wants to put his hand back on Dean's back and kiss him with an intensity that surprises even Castiel. How long had that lain dormant?
It’s just a dream, but Dean’s glad when his dad shows up two days later and carts them off to Illinois, and he promptly forgets that guy’s name.
Cas is maddening with this; he likes taking Dean apart too, and Dean sometimes wonders if he's cheating, if he learned Dean's sweet spots when he stitched him back together; wonders if he dipped into Dean's memories and remembered a little too much of the good stuff whenever he looked into his soul, or whatever. Probably, though, it's because Cas is a nerd, and thorough, and fucking patient because he takes his time teasing Dean until the teasing and the actual sucking of his cock blur together into one long moment, Dean gasping and twisting until Cas grabs him by the hips and holds him still.
At some point, he decides it would be best to flick the soapy water at Cas. If he's feeling like a teenager, he may as well act like one, right? Cas freezes, looks down at the bubbles on his coat, at Dean with a dish in his hand and mischief in his eyes, and Cas grins back. He flicks water back at Dean, aiming higher, getting soap on Dean's cheek. Dean wipes it off with a shrug of his shoulder, nodding, pursing his lips as he sets the plate down and casually shakes his hands over the sink.
It's Cas who tips over the edge first, and Dean wonders if it's because he probably wasn't doing some soul searching like Dean's been doing, or if he's just still new to all this. His last coherent thought, though, is that Cas still comes like it's a surprise, all sudden inhalations and nails digging into Dean's thigh.
He goes back to making French toast and doesn't say anything when Cas slouches into the kitchen and drapes himself over a stool.
Sam laughs, and they squabble, have brief fork battles over who gets what bite, and they rock-paper-scissors over the last piece of sausage. Dean glowers over at Sam, who mm's his way through the entire link. He grins a shit-eating grin (or in this case, last-sausage-eating grin) as he finishes, and Dean punches him in the shoulder.
And that's how Dean moves from Sex Education 101: Learning the Body to Sex Education 102: Exploring the Mind.
There's a crunching of leaves, but there's always a crunching of leaves, but this one gets louder, and louder, and finally Castiel looks up to see a familiar sight, the black metal glinting in the few rays of sunlight that manage to reach through the trees.
The cool night air and the metal of the Impala's hood have only begun to seep into Dean's skin and lower his blood pressure when he hears footsteps behind him.
"No, I'm not a prude. I believe that it's important to understand your body and that people should be educated in how to pleasure themselves."
But somehow, they finish one glass of wine, and another, and Dean finds out Castiel has three older brothers, and Dean tells him about Sam, and they skirt awkwardly around the subject of their parents to turn back around to their travel abroad trips in undergrad. Dean wins a few more rare hard laughs from Castiel, and they finish off two more glasses of wine before they make their separate ways home.
Even though Dean didn't have a lot of excuses left for thinking anything different than that, the simple sincerity of Cas's words, of Cas's feelings, finally strewn out on the table in front of him -- it knocks the air out of him, and Dean almost feels the room tilt. Charlie was right, of course, and is probably right about how Dean doesn't have anything to be afraid of, but that doesn't make this any easier.
It starts with Dean bringing Cas back a plant, something leafy and dark green, with vines spilling over the edges of the pot. When Cas asks, Dean shrugs and says he thought it'd brighten up Cas's room, which is true, for the record. Then Dean starts making Cas PB&J's for lunch; he tries a rotation of burger recipes, an array of different types of food, paying attention to every sound of appreciation Cas makes and finding more recipes so he can hear that sound again. He never asks, not explicitly, and Cas doesn't comment, not in so many words, but Dean feels his eyes following him every time he sets the plate down in front of him, every time Dean doesn't look at Cas when Dean says, as lightly as possible, that he's turning in and promptly leaves the room, before Cas has a chance to think anything more of that.
"No promises." His voice is warm, and he gives Dean's hand a squeeze, and Dean lets out the breath that he'd been holding onto.
"No, no," he says, maybe a little too quickly, and he has to take a breath and make himself exhale before he keeps going. "No, it's okay. I just didn't think you'd want to like.
"Would you let me talk?" Dean grunts, annoyed, but when Castiel looks up at him, patient and a little longing -- for this conversation to be over, for it to have a happy ending, for it to never have happened -- Dean's words run dry again.
So when he falls to his knees in that same room, exhausted, hurting, breathless, and he feels a hand on his shoulder and looks up to see Cas, he realizes that he doesn't have a single clue about
Castiel sets their beers down and picks Anna up; she butts her head against Castiel’s chin, but her paws reach over his arm and toward Dean, as she’s clearly not finished exploring this new person.
The irony is painful, and Castiel can't help an uncharacteristically bitter laugh, but before Dean overanalyzes it, Castiel places a hand on his shoulder and kisses him, firmer, more sure of himself, though still as if he were stealing something that was not his.
that people might become aware of -- is a little unsettling, and he lingers in his office even after Jaymee leaves; he absently stares at the comps notes but doesn't actually read them.
Dean's hand travels, wanders over Cas's back, his hip, lower, onto his thigh, as Cas writhes beneath him, seemingly unable to process it all, but Dean isn't able to slow down very much either. When he grips Cas's hip, when he rolls their bodies together, Cas's gasp is sharp, less sure of itself, and Dean forces himself to still, his mouth over Cas's neck.
The door opens, and Cas starts pocketing the key, but Dean is already on him, mouth on the back of his neck as he hurries Cas through the door and lets it close behind him. Cas turns in his arms, breathless, and Dean finds his mouth again and pins him against the wall, until finally Cas tries to start leading them up the stairs. Upsettingly, this means they have to pull away from each other. Dean's lips are flushed; his heart is beating hard, loud, fast, and he's still afraid of what will happen when this bubble bursts, afraid that Cas will try to say something once they start heading upstairs.
"It's just a flirtation." Cas's words are soft, gentle, an olive branch, and Dean turns around. Cas looks the same as ever, and Dean's heart constricts, his stomach churns. He feels a surge of warmth and revulsion. This is wrong on every level;
"All the better to cover your ass," Charlie says, soothing. "I give a couple of reminders before I go for the nuclear option, but the last thing you want is parents discovering a string of 0's and 1's on the report card."
"It's complicated, Sam," he barks, scrubbing vigorously at the pan, harder than is really necessary.
“Yeah. Sam…” Dean stares steadily into Sam’s eyes, his face turning from sad to expressionless. “He didn’t bring enough donuts for the both of us.” He pushes the door open wider so Sam can see Castiel on the couch, just starting to turn away from the TV to pay attention to the brothers’ conversation.
“Alright. Mark that one down. You don’t do well in a crowd.” The doe-eyed way Castiel looks at the world now, the way he’s retreated into himself, it really isn’t any wonder that being suffocated by bodies wouldn’t really do much to make his day any better. Dean tugs on his sleeve and starts for the water machine he sees near the bathrooms.
When he opens his eyes again, it's because he's cold everywhere that Cas isn't. He doesn't know what time it is other than his sense that it's
They smile at each other, enough that Dean has to reign himself back in, try not to laugh, as he pulls the phone back against his ear.
Dean's laugh is a surprise, almost painful, and he hates it; it doesn't belong in this moment that's just supposed to be about disposable intimacy, something that can happen here and there but only in the dark, something that should never be let out into the light.
Dean makes a noise there, involuntarily, and turns around before he says something like how he misses Cas too, but--again--Cas is the one who got them into this boat. Right?
Maybe Dean had intentionally sparked the Spanish in this conversation just so he could hear it roll off Castiel's tongue; he thinks he could hardly be blamed for that. At the mention of food, though, he inhales and smells more than just Castiel's shampoo and detergent; that's definitely the aroma of something delicious. Hot and a good cook? Dean hit the jackpot.
It doesn't take too long to gather up Cas's things, which by now consists of a few books and a few changes of clothes, and for Cas to return the key to the apartment. He tells Corey that it's time for him to move on, and Dean decides he doesn't need to hear Cas say this goodbye as he feels Corey stare a hole in his back on the way out of the door. When Cas climbs into the car, Dean watches him say a silent goodbye to this place, and he waits until Cas turns around and gives Dean a nod.
"Dean." Cas's voice is thick and bracing, coming from somewhere underneath Dean's chin, and he tenses, but then Cas nuzzles into him and grumbles, "The light is still on."
"Har, har, Colonel Mustard. No, you said Cas saved you," she starts, and Dean fidgets, suddenly and unexpectedly uncomfortable. "He had a deal with the Empty. What was the deal?"
"I'm not any better than you. I just don't have as many hang-ups," he says simply, and he interrupts Dean's attempt to process that with his lips on Dean's and his hand moving over his cock, and Dean's mind skips a few beats for a few more reasons.
Dean's head actually hurts from the swirl of thoughts in his mind; they press at his temples until they throb, and he can't catch hold of one thought long enough to analyze it, decide if it's worth keeping or throwing back. He knows, though, that he floods with sick relief when Castiel stops walking to the door. He could go through with this, could really let Castiel walk out the door, if he had a good reason, something compelling, but all he has is something labeled cowardice, and what Castiel has to offer is a lot more appealing.
There’s silence for so long that he can hear Castiel’s impatience in the shuffling of his weight on his feet.
"Very impressive," he says, his voice a low rumble, and Dean hopes no one else recognizes the sex-tones in it. "Don Juan Tenorio?" Castiel's got one arm in a sling, and he's wearing what looks like a repurposed colonial costume.
“So, I spend all my time reading for comps, and you dump me for a cat?” Dean asks, not entirely seriously, and Castiel shrugs.
"I'm not--" But he stops because Dean's smiling widely now, and Cas starts to smile in return before he rolls his eyes. "That's definitely not a rule that you follow," he says instead, and Dean swats at him lightly with the towel still in his hand.
"I thought you weren't going to go?" Sam asks as Dean turns away from the calendar on the fridge. It'd been months ago that Charlie had written in the date of his high school reunion and scribbled stupid doodles all around it.
"Listen, Cas, I..." The anger of betrayal has flooded out of him, but Castiel can see him struggling. He decides he doesn't want to do this, after all.
"Hi, Dean. How's your brother?" she asks with a disturbingly wicked grin that has Dean frowning deeply as she scans the table for his nametag. He starts to reach for it, but Becky doesn't stop; she keeps scanning until she picks up another tag, one that has Dean's heart halting in its rhythm and maybe starting to move in reverse, actually.
"No, Cas, I -- " The words are forced. Castiel is almost sure he doesn't want to hear them. Behind him, in the cabin, the sink starts, the sound of running water and clinking dishes a domestic backdrop to this utterly un-domestic scene, to this swan song of a domesticity that he used to chase.
He thinks about that from earlier tonight, but he thinks about it--what, two years ago now?--on the floor in that crypt, the air so musty and cold, and Cas's eyes, faraway, robotic, more than he'd ever been. And Dean, clinging to him; Dean, feeling words that he didn't know how to say, so he'd said different ones, and he watched as Cas came back to him.
"Just figured I owed you a birthday present." She grins, just for a second, and then she nods at Cas. "Besides, you need to take him to do something fun. You can't just let him rot away with you in that hole in the ground."
There are a few days, before Jess and Sam come by and Castiel comes back from visiting his family, where it’s just Dean and Bobby. It’s probably unfortunate for everyone else that the bulk of the decorating happens then because the Christmas tree winds up having washers and nuts strung up along it, and the advent calendar is actually just Dean and Bobby taking a shot every night. They wrap presents together, sharing a six pack and crooning along as off-key as possible to the same old tired Christmas songs on the radio.
Castiel cuts off whatever Dean had 'just' too, and Dean hears determination in the sigh on the other end of the phone, but it's more than that; he can tell when Castiel's about to start on something he's rehearsed, like a lesson plan or the premise of a paper.
Maybe the first few times they'd gone out hadn't been a date, but this time he's pretty sure -- he's got a date with a professor. All those times he'd teased Sam about being a teacher's pet seem to be coming back to bite him in the ass, but if that's something Castiel's down for, then Dean would be okay with that.
"No," Dean says, shaking his head, "no, it didn't have to be like that. It didn't have to--I told you not to say it, Cas," his voice breaks, but he doesn't want to go down that route; he straightens, tightens his jaw, hardens his gaze. "Things were good. They were good.
"Come in." He steps aside stiffly, and Dean follows, licking over his lips and going over the script he'd written for himself. It's currently in its fourth version, and Dean decides that none of it is actually any good and rejects it all before he even turns around to face Castiel.
Balthazar's lips turn up in a smile that's too knowing for Dean's tastes. "So I see. Castiel, I need to talk to you about the changes we're making to the 3010 course. If you'd follow me to my office...?"
“Because it seems like we’ve been gearing up for that since you stalked into that shack the first night I saw you,” he answers casually, shrugging, and he turns back to the TV, only he doesn’t get to fully settle before Castiel grabs his shirtfront and kisses him hard—harder than Dean’s ready for, really, and harder than he thought Castiel had in him. This one they don’t surface from for a while, though Dean thinks about it, tries to; Castiel just pulls him back in, and there’s nothing but Dean’s ragged breath and Castiel’s ragged stubble until Dean’s lungs are burning for a proper breath.
"Yeah. Pretty much. Am I the weird one for being cool with however my holidays shake down, so long as I have good food, good beer, and my family around?"
“You wanna ride that?” Dean asks, and Castiel frowns at him briefly, as if weighing the question, before he nods slightly. Dean bites back a sigh. His fear of heights is pretty strictly limited to airplanes, but Ferris wheels, on occasion, have given him a twitchy feeling in his gut. But he remembers the way Castiel had looked interested way back even by the car, so he knows there really isn’t much of a decision here.
He tugs his pants up, fly still undone, and climbs onto the bed, moving up Dean's body, up to Dean's cock, hard and trying its damnedest to break free of his jeans, and together he and Cas undo his fly and wriggle his jeans lower until his dick pops up, tenting his boxers. He leans down and closes his mouth around the head of his cock, the heat and the wet pressing through the fabric to leave Dean squirming.
"Yeah, he is." He runs out of words, already feeling like he's told his life story, and he and Castiel lay together for a few moments, with Castiel's fingers lightly following the swell of Dean's hips.
Castiel smiles at him, a real smile, and he glances at the student before settling those eyes on him again. Dean silently wills Castiel to tone it down. It isn't that he's embarrassed about... Alright, maybe he's embarrassed about it, but only when he has to be in some semblance of power. He doesn't know what his students would think of him if they knew he was dating a dude.
"Cas," he starts, and his fingers tighten on Cas's hip. "I don't--" He doesn't know how to ask for help on what comes next, so instead he says, "What do you want?"
"Is what about?" Dean asks, bracing himself for whatever connection Sam's made, bracing himself for how he's going to have to affirm, or correct, and bracing himself for what comes after that.
"Bad?" he asks, his thumb rubbing a small, soothing circle into his hip. After a moment, Cas shakes his head.
"Oh, great." He pushes himself up; if anything puts a guy out of the cuddling mood, it's being reminded of his colossal fuckups.
“Cas.” He turns around, disbelieving. It’s been a week, and other than a few comments from Sam about missing Castiel’s gruff voice from the back, it’s all been quiet on the Castiel front. Castiel’s mouth opens, and then closes again.
There's such a gentleness in Cas's voice, and Dean can't even remember anymore when that started happening. Was it the mental hospital, after Sam and Cas were broken? Or was it sometime before that when Cas started to learn how humans work, when he started to
With a jerk, Dean wakes up to discover that it isn’t Castiel’s hands at all that are all over him, but rather Castiel’s whole body, pressed against Dean’s side. It’s still dark outside and the red lights of the clock behind Castiel’s head looks like a five or a six, according to Dean’s blurry, freshly-roused vision. Frowning at Castiel, he buries his face in his pillow, which he belatedly realizes is half comprised of Castiel’s shoulder.
"Aw, you big softie." Garth's delight is practically palpable, and it leaves Dean feeling warm and comfortable.
Dean shakes off the idea of next time and uses two fingers to push Cas back onto the bed. It only occurs to him just now that this, what they're doing, will mean that he's going to see Cas naked, and sure enough, here he is, trailing his fingers down Cas's chest. Dean licks over his lips, momentarily losing that bravado, the veneer that so far had been giving him the fuel he needs to keep doing this. His fingers reach Cas's waistband, and his eyes flick up to watch him as Cas's eyes flutter. Dean reaches his fly, thumbs over the button, watches Cas closely for his cue.
“We had a ball, Sammy.” He laces with voice with sarcasm as he pulls out his keys and jangles them. “Let’s get this show on the road.”
Leaning over, he kisses Castiel in something that starts chaste, but once Castiel seems to accept that it’s happening, he responds with the spark that Dean’s been missing in him since the non-apocalypse.
Dean thinks again of being a teenager, of the few brushes he ever had with someone outside of his dad's worldview. He thinks, unfortunately, of his dad's worldview, of the influence he had over Dean's life, over the ghost of his father that's been haunting him basically all afternoon -- basically his whole life. Bobby had been happy, when Dean told him about the wedding idea. That is, Bobby had barely said two words about it over the phone, but there was a significant pause in which Dean could almost picture him smiling in his comfortably messy house, just messy enough to let you know someone lives there, and happily.
When he sleeps with Dean, he keeps to his side of the bed, like he's afraid of disturbing Dean out of his own rest. When the bed's all his own, though, he's all limbs, and right now the blanket is twisted around one of his arms somehow, and his shoulder's exposed. His face is buried in the pillow so all Dean can really see is a mop of tangled hair and his back rising and falling, slowly.
. He glances quickly over at Cas who's smiling his satisfied smile again, finally pocketing his phone.
Dean goes red again somehow, impossibly, but before he slips too far into a memory, Cas is leaning into his eye line with a soft smile.
“Look,” he starts, clenches his jaw, and tries again. “We don’t exactly have the most functional relationship in the world, okay, but most of the time we can swing being friends. You’re one of my best friends, actually,” he amends, and he rolling his eyes up to the ceiling. “And I don’t think angry sex will help either of us to keep that up.” Bringing his eyes back down to Castiel, he’s just sitting there, anger building up behind that disquieting gaze, but Dean’s resolute.
"Good," Cas says, his hand moving over Dean's arm. "Good, just..." He bites his lip, and Dean draws back, watching his face, but Cas is staring at the ceiling.
Regardless, Dean's laughing to himself, just a little hysterically, as he tears open a condom wrapper. He isn't
is the ultimate comedian-plays-all-the-parts movie, and so Adam Sandler really should just shoot himself in the face."
He’s a regular at this one bar, drinking away his inactivity and frustration at being left behind again, though he knows it’s necessary. It’s necessary for Sammy, as he’s told Dean countless times, and Dean can accept that. It doesn’t mean that he won’t still feel like he’s going crazy, and it doesn’t make him feel any less far away from his father.
And then he feels a warm hand on top of his, and he opens his eyes to Castiel’s steely gaze, but it’s full of that hesitant, uncertain look that moved in ever since Castiel realized he was human. At least, and Dean notices this with a dizzy surge, Castiel doesn’t look so morose. He turns his hand over and links their fingers together, steadfastly ignoring the cliché of the whole moment.
"Would you -- ? I'm trying to do a thing here, man." What it is, he doesn't know, but Cas gives a watery smile and finally takes Dean's hand. He'd expected it to feel electric. It wouldn't be the first time they've done this, but every other time, one or the other had been bleeding, or dying, or the world was falling down around their ears. This time, there's only the hum of the machines in the bunker, as familiar to Dean now as any home's ever been, and when Cas's fingers slide over his skin, there's a reverence, a care, like Sam when he's handling some new, fragile book he dug out of the archives. It isn't electric at all, but warm like a fireplace, and Cas's hand fits neatly into his, grips him firmly.
Dean wishes he could say that he remembered Cas now, but he doesn't. He's looking at pictures of him, skinny and with darker circles under his eyes, still a shock of rumpled hair, still dressed neat as a pin. Dean tries to remember a skinny kid with a religious reputation, but he's got nothing, but then, huge chunks of his high school experience are blank spots, smudges where memories used to be.
“I agree.” Though Castiel understands Dean, Dean wishes he could understand the meaning behind that small, barely-there smile before he turns back to the screen, and
He pries himself away long enough to pull the covers over them, and Castiel rolls over; Dean takes the invitation and curls up at his back, draping an arm around his waist. It's quiet, then, just the sound of their still-uneven breath in the darkness, and he really ought to tell Castiel about Bobby. It's good news; he ought to be able to tell him, but when he tried to bring it up over dinner, the words choked in his throat. They do now, too; he even inhales, in preparation to speak, but they don't dislodge.
“Dude, you gotta get out more.” His hair somewhat drier, he glances at the screen, and it’s some meaty looking guy working out. Boring. He can’t judge until the boobs come out. Crossing the room to his bag, he digs around for a T-shirt and some boxers to sleep in.
"Sure," Dean says, with a quick nod. He's carved a niche for himself where he supplies people with all the information that the administration really should make more widely available, but doesn't. "I gotta tell you, man. I am sick of teaching this way."
Dean peels his own jacket off and drops it on the floor. God, it's been so long since he did this, since he felt something beneath his fingertips so decidedly...
"Listen, I'm... I'm sorry," Dean says, knowing it's not enough. "I'm sorry about--about the last few months, I'm sorry for icing you out, I'm sorry for--" He breaks off sharply. This is the root of it, isn't it? "I'm sorry I didn't say anything back when you..." Cas's gaze is as steady as ever, and Dean can't stand it anymore.
"I can't imagine a class getting the upperhand over you," Castiel comments, and Dean looks up because that sounded a little like a flirty thing, but Castiel's concentrating on his wine, so Dean picks his glass up too and takes a sip. Good, not bad. Beer's better.
Castiel texts Dean between the morning and the afternoon, and Dean actually can sit and picture Castiel in his house, making coffee, papers in his lap and pen between his fingers, but he's too busy deciding the appropriate time to text to concentrate grading.
“The word of God has been confused through the multiple channels of communication that resulted in your Bible.” Castiel sounds so
Castiel will have to know about Bobby; Dean will tell him tomorrow, take the morning to work himself up to it. He nuzzles against Castiel's shoulder and closes his eyes and lets himself be content with his decision.
He used to have a thousand excuses ready for that one, but he can't seem to find any that are worth bringing up now. His dad flashes into his mind then, and Dean tries to imagine taking Cas around to his dad's, and he just can't put it together; but his mom...
Cas pulls a stack of mail out of his inner coat pocket and holds it out to Dean, who robotically takes it, and robotically starts shuffling through it, not really seeing things, until he
"No," and Dean knows he's grinning like an idiot, but he doesn't really care because he's too busy setting Castiel's grading aside, on top of his laptop. "No, you didn't mention that."
he feel about that? The funny thing is that he'd done such a good job convincing himself that what Cas had said hadn't meant
real, the more that he walks, the more that his feet meet the ground, solid and dusty, the more that he breathes in the air, dry and crisp, with a touch of snow in it, though the sun is too bright, the air too warm to really let that happen. The cruel irony continues as he approaches an empty gas station, but he'd known that it would be there. He knew precisely where it was, how long it would take to get there. When he approaches the door, he half expects it to be the same as it was then: clean, well stocked, but empty of people.
"I prefer biting," Castiel murmurs, just says it just like that, and it takes Dean a few seconds to realize that's Castiel-speak for a joke. He thinks. He's pretty sure. He forces a laugh anyway, and Castiel's mouth twitches with a smile, so he thinks he was right. The trouble is though, now he's thinking about Castiel and his mouth, which is bad because he was already thinking about Castiel and his hands. Maybe it's just that he's recently come out and so it's all new and shiny to think about dudes this freely, this easily.
The next time Castiel gasps, it’s because Dean has a finger in him, and then two, and he’s moaning when it comes to the third one, his hips learning how to rock back against Dean’s hand with a steady rhythm that makes Dean impatient, but he wants this to be good. He knows that one slip could make this not awesome, no matter what Castiel says, so he takes his time, and nearly fucking kills himself doing it.
"Yeah, took me a while to adjust to it too," Bobby says, Dean back on the porch, beer in his hand. Sam is visiting their parents, but Dean hasn't felt ready to see anyone yet. The bigness of where he is, the smallness of how he got here; it's all been too much to process and, he supposes, he needed a lifetime to start to figure out how he felt about it. Sam's lifetime, it turns out, though it didn't feel like anything to Dean.
"There hasn't been anything for a while now," he says gently, and Dean stops, his hands over the keys. "Do you think maybe it's time--"
But most of Castiel's witty whatever is swallowed up when Dean presses their mouths together again, and he tugs at Castiel's shirt, because Dean's ability to listen promptly checks out when his boyfriend uses the words "sick, twisted sex" in that order.
Maybe Castiel should dress up as a fucking wizard for Halloween because all it takes is for him to tilt his head like that, to put a new shade to his eyes, and suddenly the air in the room starts to sizzle with anticipation. Dean licks over his lips in an effort to keep his mouth from going too dry, and he leans back in his seat, spreading his legs a little wider, draping his arms over the armrests.
"I'm doing alright keeping up with grades," Kevin is saying, "but mainly that's because so many kids haven't turned anything in."
Castiel smiles. One of those smiles that make his eyes crinkle at the corners and his teeth fully visible. “When did you turn into such a sap?”
“Dean what will happen to us in the Summer?” He found himself asking Dean one night on of their late night calls.
“How was your day?” Dean murmurs softly for Castiel’s ears only. Even though there’s no one else here.
Gabriel raises his eyebrows in question, turning to Castiel who's standing there gaping, thinking the odds of this happening and thinking over his earlier statement.
Dean sighs and walks to him. He offers a hand to Castiel who takes it with furrowed brows. Although his posture relaxes when Dean hugs him tightly, face resting in the crook of his neck. Castiel’s hand reach up in Deans hair, petting and massaging.
It's May. The sky is filled with graduation hats as they’re thrown proudly high above. The crowd of graduates cheers louder for themselves. Hugging their friends and kissing their loved ones.
February rolled around in a blink and Castiel found himself wondering where did all the time go? His days more often then ever were blurred into one. It's been a month since he's been dating Dean yet it doesn't feel like a month at all.
Dean pulls back enough to look at Castiel’s face. It’s beautiful. Not just in the ways of societal beauty but in a way that’s just Castiel. His ocean eyes, soft and confused. His lips slightly parted unknowingly between the peach fuzz that encompasses most of his face. Castiel stares at Dean with adoration and trust. Dean stares at him like he’s his everything.
This story is completely written and I will post each chapter as I edit them so don't worry about it being abandoned :)
“I don’t know, Charlie I only had one lesson with him.” Castiel replies while playing with his slimy cafeteria food.
Of course this is the point his father chooses to speak up . “Castiel, you’re mother is right. There’s no future in art.” And for a cherry on top he adds,”We only want what’s best for you.”
“Oh I come here to walk, you know, helps clear the head.” Dorothy speaks while taking the spot beside Charlie.
They sit in a booth in the far corner. Castiel draws little doodles on his journal in an effort to pass the time while Gabriel flirts with the waitress.
They leave to have breakfast at greasy burger place which Dean highly speaks of, though Sam does point out his brother’s exaggeration it doesn’t change the expectations Castiel has set for it.
Hey guys I know I sort of went dead silent for a while even though I promised y'all that this story won't be abandoned and it isn't I just had a lot going on emotionally hence I was to exhausted to edit the chapters. Though here I am wth another one.
“I’ve met someone. He’s, he’s great. Amazing actually. His name’s Castiel. I wanted to bring him today but I just didn’t want to make it weird for Sam. Cas understands though. Always has. You would’ve loved him.” He’s quiet for a Moment, swallowing past the lump in his throat. “I know I do.”
Before Dean can reply her eyes fall on Sam and she scoots in beside Sam who just pushes himself farthest from her until his back is against the window
He walks with a subtle skip in his step, excitement thrumming beneath his skin. He gets in and settled. “Let’s go.”
He found himself sitting on a bridge at night, looking over the water rushing beneath it. Coursing through so quickly.
Castiel rolls his eyes at Gabriel’s miserable attempts to get it to start. He places his journal on the dashboard, gets out of the car and walks in the diner. Jo’s behind the counter wiping it.
Charlie takes a few deep breaths,,” You should’ve told me.” She says as calmly as her self control let’s her.
She peaks  out of the door with a towel on her shoulder not knowing of the awkwardness rising.” Oh good your here, their car won’t start and I couldn’t stand watching his clueless ass right outside.” She points at Gabriel.
Castiel has to slightly look up at Dean but he does He does in a way that shows worry clear in his voice.” Shouldn’t I be asking that?”
“Oh my god is that you Dean?” A voice squeals behind Castiel and Dean. Sam sees the person walking and looks outside the window.
Castiel does as he’s told, his brother accompanying him. He climbs the carpeted stairs and enters his room. He sits on the edge of his bed facing Gabriel,preparing himself for the oncoming burst of anger.
Everyone starts to cheer and it’s all family friendly. Soon one of the other waitress hauls up a little girl who wants to dance. The cheers increase , watching the little girl jam to the music.
They end up staying at a three star motel but that is enough for them. Sam gets a separate room while Dean and Castiel get one with a double bed.
All the waitress in their hats and black shirts jump up on the counter in unison. They start to dance. It isn’t anything mature or dirty, it’s just them dancing to the rhythm of the song.
Cas liked Dean that much he had realised. Though just like always, the two beings on his shoulder would whisper their thoughts about it. Maybe Dean will be good and Cas will realise that not always the sweetest of starts have the bitterest of endings or maybe Dean will just end up proving him right.
He wanted to call out to him but he knew it was pointless, nothing could be heard over this loud music.
Charlie sits at bench in a park a block away from her house.  There are children playing, laughing and just enjoying life. Her lips curl up in a smile when she sees a little boy with raven hair helping another girl his age after she fell down.
Then he met Dean Winchester who was a star among the rocks floating about in space. A bright one too.
A hand ruffles his hair and the body it belongs to takes a seat beside him. “Am I not gonna get my first kiss of the day or what?”
“Hey Cas!” He shouts over the rumble of his impala to Castiel who turns around,” See you around.” He speaks with a smile to contagious that Castiel can’t help but slowly return it.
Dean Winchester, Castiel found out by third period, was his name. He came late to the class and when he did all eyes were on him. Even the girls who would sit behind him and gossip in hushed voices stopped.
Dean stares at him until Castiel turns and looks at him too, his eyes soft. Dean crumpled under the intensely soft glare.
“Okay fine, have your way. I won’t bring it up again.” Not the best option but better than not being able to talk to him for almost a whole day.
“Uh, Becky?” Sam tries but Becky doesn’t get his memo instead she crushes him in a hug. Sam stares at his brother for help.
After they left Castiel and Dean came to the roadhouse where everyone congratulated them. Dean had jut left to talk to Ellen.
"Dean if I ever go away, look at the stars." Cas had told Dean, surprisingly without his voice wavering.
"You know you gotta relax more. It's Thursday right now, you've got a whole weekend for that." Dean shifts the gears and they're moving forward.
"What? You're gonna say you were going to tell me, when? It's been what, four fucking months. What the hell Cas, I thought we were close. More than close, I was there for when you would fucking cry yourself to sleep because how bad you felt here.
She saunters off before Castiel can ask her anything. He looks to Dean who just smirks at him. That’s the moment loud country music starts playing in the joint. Castiel looks at Dean more confused than ever who I’m turn just shrugs at him.
They both turn to lol where he’s entering from. He looks from his mom to Dean. “Everything alright?”
The other waitresses jump of and join in the crowd.  Castiel’s laughing and dancing, all his previous reluctance disappeared. Jo’s dancing with him, she takes her cowboy hat off and places it on Castiel’s head. He just laughs and enjoys.
The door opened and Sam appeared with a grumpy look on his face." You promised you won't call me Sammy, Dean."
“Of course you do. Especially after the night you must’ve had.” He waggles his brow suggestively but leaves after Castiel threatens to throw another pillow.
If the scene wasn’t so intense Castiel would be laughing. Something must’ve shown in his features because Dean Winchester’s eyes bore into his. He kept looking and Castiel didn't back down either. Or at least he tried to.
“Oh! You boys. Warn a women before arriving at her doorstep.” She pulls the brothers together in a hug. Castiel shifts on his feet, feeling out of place.
Castiel pecks Dean before getting out of the car, wondering how he’ll get in without anyone noting his late arrival. Although the many thoughts are short lived when Castiel opens the door, his hands folded over his chest and eye brow cocked at Castiel with a look which can only be described as barely contained fury.
He made his way to the bathroom and shut himself in it, trying to rub out the alcohol off his shirt as much as he could.
Castiel considers it for a moment, his eyes watch Dean behind the counter getting smacked in the head by Ellen. Jo laughs at the dramatic wincing Dean does, rubbing his head.
Later when they stop at truck stop, they each get slushes for themselves which they do end up regretting, considering how coloured their teeth are left after drinking it.
“Oh yeah definitely that, she even proposed to Sam. No boyfriend, no friends straight to marriage, but Sam here is an heart breaker.”
“See this why I didn’t tell you. You-you always find a way to make every single thing about yourself. For once Charlie, I wanted something for myself.”
They get in the car, castiel relaxing back in the seat with a deep safisfied sigh while Dean drives.
He’s resting his head on the window. The roads are mostly empty the closer they get to his home. He twists himself so he can look at Dean.There’s a soft smile on his face too. Not like the earlier ones full of mischief or smugness.
Time passes by, their food is served to them and they eat it in companionable silence. Castiel teasing Dean about his table manners while Dean just scowls at him.
“Okay, look I’m sorry. I didn’t know it would piss you off this much.” Dean sighs.” I just, we’ve been dating for almost  four months now and you still haven’t told Charlie. I mean she’s your best friend. I can't even come sit with you during lunch when she's around."
"We had this nightly ritual of going to this tiny shake place near our home whenever dad would come from work." The memory was one of Cas' favourites despite only having a handful of good ones. " Mom would always worry about dad being tired but dad would always say something along the lines of how spending time with his family was how he relaxed."
Castiel bodily laughs till his insides hurt at Sam. Dean joins in too when he catches a flash of it in the rear view mirror.
“Dean!” Somewhere along his word vomit Castiel had come closer to him, placing his hands over his shoulder. His blue hues hold Dean’s green ones. “It’s okay.”
He wanted to be annoyed at her for thinking that but he couldn't. She wasn't wrong. He has been 'sulking'.
“Yeah.” Castiel sighed and closed his journal replacing it with his neglected tray of food. “It better.” He mumbles under his breath, feeling equal parts frustrated and exhausted.
room. Who is standing there, scowling with his arms folded over his chest, at all the clothes spread on his bed.
Castiel remained silent, taking in what was told. Dean just stared at him. He looked like an angel under the moonlight,blue eyes glinting with innocence. Minutes pass by before Dean speaks softly again, “When can I see you again?”
Charlie takes a deep breath and opens it.  Castiel is lying on his bed, phone settles beside his right ear by the pillow as he smiles at whatever he's told on the line. Although that same smile falls as soon as he sees Charlie. One of his hands grabs the phone and excuses himself before cutting the call.
Castiel manoeuvred himself on Dean’s lap. It’s a tight fit, considering there’s a steering wheel jabbing at his hip but it’s not enough for him to pull away. He crosses his hands behind Dean’s head,” Now if I remember correctly, you brought to me here with the promise of a night to remember.” He emphasis that with grinding down in slow circles.
He thought he was getting better. He hadn't harmed himself for a while now. He thought that Dean was making everything better. Though maybe that's where his mistake lay.
Charlie takes a deep breath,” Ever since Christmas I promised myself that I’d do everything at least once in these last few months. Parties, LARPing, sneaking out,” she glances at Dorothy with a smile at that,” and whatever every senior does. I just, I just feel like- I just miss the old me.
They stay like that for a a couple of minutes until the song changed to one familiar to Castiel’s ears.
“Have you? When? This whole semester I've felt like crap and you were too oblivious to even notice. At least Dean cares. He's the one who I've talked to when you weren't there and he actually helps so maybe for once, for once I wanted to keep something good to myself before you ruin it .”
The pain helps to quiet is mind for a while. The time Cas uses up to sleep. God knows how hard that comes by for him.
That is until the teacher acknowledged his presence and he found himself averting his eyes to the textbook on his desk, what's gotten into him?
Gabriel sat in the passenger seat while Castiel cowered in the backseat looking out the window. Clearly not knowing how to handle this.  Although he’s saved by any direct conversation with Dean by Gabriel who continues to ask him question after question.
The pen clicked too loudly in the silence of  the midnight for Castiel's liking. His leather journal lay open on his bed, the empty page mocking him. Sometimes he wished inspiration would come to him as easily as it did before. Though now he felt as if he stood in front of dead end with nowhere else to go.
Castiel watches how his brother points at various things under the hood as he explains in his own childish way. He couldn't decide between being worried for his lack of knowledge about his own car or be amused.
The boys object against his change of decision but Crowley speaks up, “ Alright then," He pauses probably thinking the worst dare he could give him.
The last two chapters will be hopefully posted in the next two days together and this story will be wrapped up...for now.
“I’m sorry but it’s just this is the first we’re visiting them and Sam’s already grouchy and I just-“
She sighs," Castiel I know I've always been hard on you when it comes to studies and your future but that doesn't mean I'm no less happy." She walks over to him," In just a couple of months you'll be gone to Stanford just like how we've always planned it and so happy you trusted us with your future."
“Can you believe it?”  Charlie asks once shes walking out of the school with Castiel. “Like we’re gonna graduate in a few months.”
They stand there tenderly making out for a long while. Until the faint sound of the bell ringing forces them apart. Till both of them are  light headed and their appearance a mess.
It seems unfair to not count this as art considering the most amazing writers too come from their own hell yet no one ever says writing isn't a form of art.
“Oh fuck you Novak. I have always been there when nobody gave two shits about you. I became your friend.”
“Castiel? What the hell dude I’ve been calling for almost an hour where the fuck are you?” Her voice is loud and saturated with anger.
They lay wrapped in the confines of the blanket naked and sated. Castiel's head rested on Dean’s chest, left hand fiddling with the amulet Dean wore.
“And let him have the satisfaction of me needing him? No thank you”  Gabriel stretches the last word with his usual cheeriness. “Besides this piece of junk has too many good memories buddy.” He says patting the dashboard.
Dean gets up and stretches his hands over his head, flexing his fingers in an effort to shake of the numbness.
His conversation with Charlie makes him realise the finality of everything. No more Saturday brunches with Gabriel or hanging out with his best friend. No more time with Dean. This is it. This is all he’ll ever get.
The lunch is less intense. She spills all the embarrassing stories of the brothers while Castiel listens and laughs. Though she does give him weird looks twice more it does end.
Dean types away for a couple of seconds before handing it back to Castiel. “Now you have my number.” He states with a smile.
The thought sent a shiver down Castiel, a man who sent two dudes to the E.R. Though that still didn't help clear up his confusion“I still fail to understand how this interests you?”
Castiel sighs, knowing he won't win an argument with Dean like this. “Will  it help if I say I’ll think about it?” He asks, bending down to peck a kiss on Dean’s lips.
He rushes upstairs, not giving his parents a chance to say anything more. Although when he's coming down he doesn't miss when his mother says," That boy isn't good for Castiel."
“I mean this is it. No more LARPing or game nights.” She realises.” Hell this is gonna be our last single’s valentine together.” She hesitates before continuing,” we’re still on for that right?”
