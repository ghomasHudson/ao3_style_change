Dean clapped a hand over his neck and Castiel buried his face in his hands.
"You talked to her for awhile," Sam said, a simple statement that sounded like a question he was hesitant to ask. "Interest-"
Dean slapped his hands on the bed. "Get over here and pound my ass, for Christ's sake!"
Dean was nineteen and had just finished hanging his GED up on the wall, encased in the sterling silver frame his mom had bought him just for the degree, when John Winchester came in and grabbed him by the shoulders. Dean nearly fell onto his dresser he was so startled. He spun around, arms folded and nostrils flaring.
He shrugged. "It was a  long time ago. My step mom is pretty cool." He pointed to a another photo, one that looked like a family portait. "We took that last year, when Adam turned three. And that one is of my roller derby team."
Dean was busy reading the file in front of him while beating the tip of his pencil on the legal pad in between writing notes and searching on the internet. He was interrupted every so often by Lucifer's steps pacing along the back of the bullpen, waiting on a call. It was distracting, especially since Dean knew what the call was for. Benny would distract him every so often by questioning something from the case file.
Last week, as Senator Worthington is once again running for re-election in the state of Utah, local residents seem to support him. To well-known business people and philanthropists in the area, Naomi and Zachariah Novak supported the proposed bill by backing the re-election campaign with $100,000. As written now, the bill will decrease the rights of omegas in getting jobs, going to school, and getting in relationships to the will of the alpha-in-charge. This bill will also limit who is considered to qualify to be in charge, limiting to parents and guardians in most cases. Those from foster care will have freedoms assigned to them by the state when the child is not adopted.
"Thanks, Papa," Lucifer jokingly said.
"I don't understand what you want me to do," Castiel told her.
"And you grass wasn't burned?" Charlie asked.
"Yeah... Haven't really figured out how I back though."
"So, get this...," Charlie began once she caught her breath. "I found several cases of murder victims that match our M.O. Several omegas across the country, male, female, hardly identifiable. It seemed that over time, this person has gotten better and better at hiding the bodies. There was one murder that matched the M.O. but didn't make sense. A beta named... Uriel Jones... was found in New Mexico with nearly the same wounds. After that, the string of omegas starts. It's almost as if this beta's death really brought about the killing of the omegas. It's bizarre. There doesn't seem to be a pattern, which in and of itself, maybe a pattern. There are leads on a couple of the omega's identities, but..."
"We're fine. Don't need any help."
"In fact, I'm sure a couple of them would enjoy the challenge. Now, Castiel, come with us, don't make this any harder than it needs to be," Naomi finished.
After loudly yarning, Dean asked, "What's up, babe?"
"You said we could have macaroni."
Sam and Dean looked at each other and shrugged. They walk away from John and continued back on their way. John continued to look at the books for a couple more minutes until he was sure his sons wouldn't come back. He then proceeded to close the book that was in front of him. He had other research to do. Sure, he'll feel bad about the people dying in this town. "It not like I have all the information I need," he reasoned with himself.
"They went upstairs for a bit," Lucifer answered. "They'll be downstairs soon."
"I'm going to have to call up ahead of time then."
"That's quite enough, Lucifer," Castiel said. "I'm old enough to make up my own mind about things. Now, if you excuse us..."
"You pee on it and wait a couple of minutes," Amara explained.
Sam and Dean walked into the house hand-in-hand. Dean angled himself forward. Not entirely use to no being able to smell himself in his own home. Deciding the coast was clear, Dean walked out of the walkway, taking his boots off while Sam bolted his way into the kitchen.
"Dean says that eating fries from someone else's plate makes them taste better," the thing had said.
"We'll pick this up in the morning then," Sam said, picking up all of their plans and putting them into his side pack. "So, sleeping arrangements?"
Lucifer looked on with a knowing smile. "If you wouldn't blame her, why are you blaming yourself?"
"That would be an understatement," Dean sighed, running his head down his face.
Lucifer stood up and waved Dean over to the living room. There was a very different sight than he left. All of the pillows and cushions were off the couch and lying in a pile. On the very top of that pile rested some blankets gently resting over it.
"And Emma?"
"I'm just trying to do what is best for this family."
By this point, Lucifer had walked up to the three of them. "Nice to know you're not as big of a prick as I thought you were."
“It’s not school day, Uncle Cassie,” her answer made Cas chuckled, then she took a chance to shot a respond to Gabriel before turning to the man on her right side again. “What happened to your phonecall, Uncle Cassie?”
He didn't feel this yesterday, everything was fine. Dean needed to distract his mind off Cas for a moment, and decided to plan out the evening.
At least he could give Cas a hand sign to stop interrupting him. Dean took a deep breath as he tried to compose himself to continue. It took him a while, but he finally could collect himself before he looked up to Cas again with a smile, although he couldn’t help his tears from falling. “Thank you for loving me all this time, Cas.”
talked about his childhood to anybody else, so he never knew what to expect from people’s reaction after hearing his story. But now, hearing how Castiel responded to his story made him feel like there was a knot in his chest that was untangled softly. And he unconsciously let out a relieved sigh.
Charlie’s approval would be a great bonus.
As he heard Jack’s answer, Dean could feel his insides melt with guilt. He could still remember the last time he lost Cas; he thought he went mad with grief and anger. To the point that he gave very little thought to his own life. Dean knew Cas would personally end his life if ever he had an idea of being suicidal again.
“Oh, right, I’ve got it here,” she took her planner and read the appointments that had got in for Castiel, who listened while nodding his head and asks little details about previous treatments of the patients that he had handled.
“Correct,” Dean grinned and nods. “Hey, I could pick you and Juliet up, then we’ll go shopping and then, my place, dinner and movie.”
man getting close to Jo, which earned him a knowledge as the wall between them and Jo, even with Jo had a black belt already.
“You know, tall, handsome, light brown hair. Your new boyfriend?”
"He loved me, Sammy.
Right after she said that Dean showed up from the back door of the bar and walked approaching them. “There you are. Claire, your cab is here. Kaia’s waiting for you.”
"I know, right? I'm sorry, man, but it seems like this weekend will be
Dean shrugged, "I don't know. Maybe I feel good about life now. Chuck's gone, I have everyone I love under one roof. I have you here, safe and alive. I don't see why I shouldn't be happy."
It dawned on Dean why he didn’t have any recollection of the incident. “Okay, continue.”
!” Charlie claimed cheerfully. “I’ve
“I-I’m sorry, Dean.”
A light chuckle came from across the line, “Well, Baz would love anything artsy.”
“Oh, right. Samandriel. Well, mine’s a Samuel,” Dean (finally) looked back to the road.
It took Castiel a moment before realising that he was
“Okay. So, water and kale salad or anything kale, right?”
“That’s why I asked you to help me reading them,” Dean opened another bottle of beer.
“Okay, uh, just so you know, you can tell me if you’re feeling uncomfortable with it, okay?”
at the thought of Castiel, in
Now everything felt hollow.
Sam turned to Jack in interest, "What was loud, do you know?"
That would be a lie.
“Okay, I’m finished,” Sam broke Dean’s thoughts, as he grabbed the doughnut boxes (he got two of a dozen) and put his money back into his wallet. “Thanks a lot, Gabe. I might drop by here more often now that we know each other.”
And, of course, their kiss.
“Nope. Hey, come on, what should I get here?”
talented mouth, he also played
“I-I’d like that. Thank you, Dean,” Cas could feel Dean let out a relieved sigh and then he saw him crossed his thick arms in front of his body. It took Cas few seconds to realised that he was staring. “Um, I, uh, I wasn’t prepared for a sleepover, though.”
That didn't help to ease up The Empty.
Luckily for the vamp-mime, the children were still alive, so spoons could be put aside. However, though, they were with the nest that was ready to raise them with healthy and nutritional food, just so the vampires could feed on them whenever they needed it.
Which probably inspired by the Sherriff of Nottingham in
“Sure, brother.”
Stupidly.
As he put the meat in the freezer, Dean looked inside and wonders if that would be enough, since he would also be making for Sammy, and his brother had an appetite of six people. Dean shrugged the thought off, if it wasn’t enough for the three of them, Sammy could always go out and get himself food anyway.
“Dean Winchester. Seriously, Cas. That awesome room of yours can be turned to bedroom? Why are you working out of your house, again? Next time we’re having dinner at your place, I want to watch a horror movie on your sofa,” another chime came. “Dean Winchester. By the way, I just remembered, if you bring Crowley’s puppy over on Saturday, I can make Sammy babysit her for you. He loves dogs.”
“You can call me Cas, Dean, if you want. I like it,” Cas shrugged and smiled to Dean, and he knew his just got wider when seeing Dean returned his smile.
“Where do you park, Cas?”
The sudden hysteric from the young lad didn't seem to bother Dean. he was still sitting with the whiskey glass in his hand while eyeing Jack. The latter stood a foot away from the table and started to get teary. Dean sighed before he got up and walked to Jack, and when they stood face to face, he placed a hand on the back of his neck and tried to find Jack's eyes, only to find the green orbs of eyes were practically swimming in tears.
The man in red track pants almost jumped of joy reading the message on his phone, but he remembered that one of his students might came back to say they had forgotten something. Instead, he sat down and typed the reply.
"Your what now?"
Sam and Dean shared how they confronted Chuck to Rowena, with Sam carefully treading around the topic of Cas' sacrifice. He'd left that to Dean, that if he wanted to share it.
“Cas?”
“Hang on, Dean, I think I accidentally switch the camera. Hang on,” Cas kept on laughing while tapping the screen to return it to the front camera. When the view on his phone was showing Dean’s face again, Cas smiled at what he saw, chuckling Dean who was enjoying the klutziness of Cas and his phone. “That was embarrassing.”
“Sure, though you have to leave Misha home.”
“Hey, Claire,” Cas moved closer to his niece. “Thank you for being so supportive of me and Dean, and sorry that you have to hide something from your dad.”
The sharp and lewd groan that Cas released when Dean's hand touched his dick was utterly sinful, it almost made Dean believed that he could come just from that sound. He kissed Cas' chest and nibble on his nipple softly as he moved his hip faster into Cas, and had his thumb rubbing the head of Cas' penis.
But the park apparently had a downhill from there. The largest vampire pounced down the younger brother and knocked him unconscious, then brought the older brother down to the ground while he was fighting the other vamp-mimes. He was pinned to the ground by their force, something that was odd since he usually could take at least one vampire with his mortal strength.
A brief moment where the sky blue met sapphire put a smile on the human’s lips. “Good morning, Misha,” he mumbled to the pillow. Misha, the yellow kitten that he rescued last week, mewed before purring loudly and curled on Castiel’s side. The man chuckled at the soft vibration just below his ribs and played his thumb on the soft baby fur. It didn’t take long for the kitten to had its attention caught on Castiel’s moving hand, next moment he knew the little feline was trying to catch his fingers, and the human happily obliged to tease it more.
The girl took her phone down as she made a thought, “You know somewhere I can golf?”
Fortunately, Rowena might have noticed the odd air between the hunter and his angel, she hopped off from the war table and walked towards Jack. “Well, now that you both had found each other,
Suddenly the door opened, and Cas showed.
“He’s my
“My girlfriend suddenly have to go home to her parents’ house, and Dean … I don’t know. Dean, were you planning to take anyone before?” Sam asked in such cheeky tone.
The look on Cas’ face almost blinded Dean. He was beamed with the excitement of a child when faced with a certain magic he had never witnessed.
“Yes, Dean?”
It probably would be the last place in the city where someone can find a professional dentist be, yet for some reasons, that exactly why Castiel had chosen this place to spend quiet time during his lunchtime. He knew that
He didn’t mean to say it as hard as it came out, but the change of look on Cas’ face quickly made Dean realised that he must be a little bit to hard on the comment.
of the people we love. Our family. It couldn't be like that, especially now we've downgraded Chuck, and Jack was still alive. We also might have a shot with Eileen and Cas."
“Hey, Cas, it’s me.”
Dean raised his eyebrows at Sam, “Dude, that’s not comforting.”
Going through that one particular road on after hours time would be an interesting example of living hell, he had had enough gotten stuck for
“Oh, probably tea. Green tea.”
“Well, yeah!” replied Sam almost too excitedly, it became suspicious, “Dean, you never brought anyone home before. The last time I saw you took someone home, it was Lis-well,
Dean jerked his head upwards at the question, then at the same moment he asked himself, why did Cas couldn’t make it to their dinner bothered him? It wasn’t like he intended to do so. Well, at least from the way Cas told him, he seemed as upset as he did.
"Yes. Unfortunately, Mr Ketch hadn't got his new supply when he died, so ... yeah."
Amara laughed at the comments from Eileen and Sam, and then she fell into her thoughts again. But, only for a moment, before the light bulb in her mind started to light up. “I think I know who can help me with that. I’m gonna get him, and hopefully, he'll forgive me and be willing to help. No, it’s not Chuck, guys, I promise.”
Dean led the way and as they reached the door, Dean holds it for Castiel, who was blushed heavily over his lightly tanned skin. They both walked side by side in silence, once in a while their hands brushed and Dean decided to let it, while clenching his jaw not to smile so widely.
“The dinner still on? When is it?” Bela asked excitedly and moved closer to Dean.
When he knew that he almost caught his orgasm, Dean lifted Cas' legs and hooked them on his elbows as he thrust harder into Cas. His pace just got shattered as he felt his orgasm build, when Cas suddenly said, "Dean, bed."
“Order?” the waitress asked dryly.
He knew that both Charlie and Sam would thought he was a jealous fool, and would tease him endlessly on it, but not with Cas. Dean felt the man sitting next to him suddenly went stiff and awkward. And his guilt crept up.
“Is everything okay?” Castiel asked and leaned back to the kitchen island, with both of his hands holding the edge of the counter.
“Claire, this is Dean, and that’s his brother, Sam,” Cas pointed to Sam, who smiled widely at the girl, “and this is Balthazar, and Charlie. Dean’s friend.”
Cas grinned when he saw Sam knelt down to rub the pup’s head and it didn’t take long until Juliet rubbed his body on Sam and showered his face with friendly licks. Cas only assumed that Juliet felt like she met someone of her own species, hence the fast familiarity. “Sam, here, you can take her for play or walk,” Cas handed the leash, and the tall man quickly took it from his hand and lead the dog to the living room.
By the way, i based the canteen from the food court my old workplace used to have here in Indonesia, so i'm sorry if some of you might not familiar with the setting!
Someone answered the call. No, not someone, Castiel answered the call. The man he was actually looking forward to talking with.
” Castiel giggled to his sister, who copied him.
“Cas? Hey, is this thing still going? Cas, you’re frozen there.”
Rowena chuckled, "With him actually being like that, I wouldn't be surprised that his children were all rebellious; Lucifer, Castiel, Gabriel."
After he was sure that Claire won’t be finished soon, Castiel went to get some proper clothing and took his shower in the bathroom near the kitchen. While he was under the water, Castiel kept wondering why did Gabriel insisted on him and Claire to come, what was it with his client that would get their interest?
“Hello?”
it was.
It wasn’t an immense interrogation. The brothers were only asking the whereabouts of the children from the case they found, and whatever answer the vamp-mime would give, he would end up dead anyway. At this point, it would be the vampire’s call. Whether he would be dead from the big brother’s machete, fast and clean, no muss and no fuss, by giving him the straight answer. Or he could refuse to provide them with answers and suffered from the little brother’s pocket knife, where he would keep sawing and sawing to get the head off. It was no threat when the younger hunter said that the vampire would feel every muscle and every tendon being cut—
understand that reference.”
"Interesting. You're just as interesting as what Castiel had in mind, Dean Winchester," The Empty grinned. "However, that thing with Billie? She didn't tell me at all about it, so I guess she was just planning to
“My klutz of a brother lost his keys again, so I have to go home and get him inside,” Dean huffed and slides his phone back into his jeans pocket. “Look, Cas-Tiel, tonight was amazing, but I’m sorry I have to end it sooner. Thanks to my brother.”
angel, Castiel.
"Of?"
Dean blinked in confusion when he heard Jack’s reasons, “Did any of those ever happen to us?”
Castiel smiled as he heard his sister’s words, “Thanks, Abbie.”
fashion to his family. “Nice to meet you, Castiel.”
"What did you see?"
“Good night, Cas,” Dean planted a light kiss on the back of Cas’ shoulder.
After each man took a machete that would help behead vampires and a gun for support, they headed into the barn. It was eerie on the inside, empty with stacks of hay placed here and there, along with farming pieces of equipment that could hurt anyone who didn’t use it properly. It was curious why vampires, or vamp-mimes, would make a nest in this place.
“Very,” Dean answered shortly and rose up to his feet to embraces his friend into a hug. “How are you, Bela? It’s been a while.”
“Yeah, but both of us have had an understanding that we work better as friends this time,” Cas quickly added before Dean had any different thought about him and his former lover.
"As for my mother," Dean took his hand down from Jack, "I'm not gonna lie that I was really,
Dean glared at Jack, only to meet the child's playful smile. "Right, anyway … this is excellent, guys, we're onto something, finally! Let's go meet Sam and Rowena to tell them this plan."
Here's the next chapter, hope you lot enjoy reading it as much as i enjoy writing it!
Here goes, the next chapter!
Amara smiled, “I understand. He fooled us all, he even absorbed me to boost his power. I felt stupid for thinking my brother would grow from this narcissistic boy,” she paused for a  moment before lifted his face and smiled to the rest of the room. “Thank you, to you all, for not killing Chuck. Although I honestly don’t know what to do with him now.”
phone call trying to convince him to go here."
The tone of Dean’s voice sent Castiel aback. It was a great contrast of what he heard all night during dinner. There was nothing soft or loving in the voice, it was deep, harsh, and demanding. Clearly Dean was upset.
It would get worsened for the vampire if the children were dead. The older hunter had emphasised to the creature sitting on a tree trunk before him that his little brother would do the beheading using a
"Cas," he called softly as he parted from Cas, and met with the teary blue orbs of eyes again, "please forgive me."
Bela sent 4 invitations. I’m taking Jess. U?
As he said that, Castiel’s face had now turned several shades of red. It was something that Dean didn’t know an angel would and could do, but there Cas was. Dean smiled and walked closer to Cas to cup the angel’s face again, and he could feel his smile got wider when he saw Cas looked even more puzzled with his action.
“Come on, you’re gorgeous already,” Cas groaned.
“Nothing happened, really. We just talked and ... eat,” Dean pushed Benny’s glass closer to the man, “nothing fancy, really.”
Abaddon sucked through her teeth, “You know, Cassie, not that I don’t love you, but I’d prefer that you
"They're adorable," Eileen answered giddily, "I had stories from both sides now. From Sam on how you first met her and how she grew fond of you guys, then from Rowena on how she was irritated by you both and started to accept you as somewhat family. She seems lovely and has her own way to show tough love for you both."
Castiel smiled, "Are you really happy, Dean?"
“Um, sorry. Yeah, it’s okay if your next class is up, Dean. Will talk to you soon?”
“We might be able to rip a portal to The Empty,” Eileen continued, “Sam reckon that there should be something on the books here about it. Or, if we bumped a wall, we might ask for help from Rowena.”
“I don’t know, but if you said anything would be fine for you, then why not give this a shot?”
Dean also asked for Jody advice on when would be the best time to tell Claire. Now as it just happened, or later after they know whether they can bring Cas back or not. Thankfully for Dean, Jody said that they should do their best to rescue Cas, and let her deal with the news delivery to Claire.
“He is, Doctor, but’s he’s already arrived now,” Naomi replied.
He tried to track back on how the wonderful day could give him a one-eighty and landed him in this situation, where he was uncomfortably standing with so many people and could hardly move. Castiel leaned his head on the glass, then he smiled when he remembered that today will be the day to meet Dean Winchester again.
“Shut up,” Crowley’s snap returned Castiel to his seat before the man. From the look on his eyes, clearly his mother was not the issue Crowley would like to discuss today. “So, how’s it going with your lover-boy?”
“Great! Oh, Cas, Sammy’s calling, I gotta answer this. I have to answer or he’ll bitch. So, I’ll see you tomorrow, yeah?”
my, I’m flattered you showed up at my door, looking all dashing with a classic car.”
Maybe for the first time ever, Cas wished he put on chapstick more often. He always had issues with chapped and dry lips.
she would be happy finding out that I'm more comfortable and happier with myself now, you know? But, yeah, probably not so much for Dad. We’ll see.”
"Hey-"
Dean kept on locking his look to Cas, who had another adorable look on his face. It was at that moment Dean wanted to make sure that Cas would always have that expression on his face.
Dean lifted his face slowly to Castiel, and he could see that the blue eyes before him didn't look as bright as before. "Um, you keep saying that. Everything's good between you two?"
being a demon?
the same?
He locked his phone and put it on the table again, then he claimed the remote before continues his story absent-mindedly, “We were planning to have dinner today, at his place. But, something came up and I have to cancel.
Sam stepped in with Jack followed behind him, it was evident that the boy was afraid to meet Dean. "We think that Amara brought most of Jack's power with Her. You remember what Chuck said about Light and Darkness balance? It might be that to make Amara, The Darkness, work as a God, She would need the Light from Jack."
" in his signature manner, Crowley added a dramatic pause while taking a sip from his drink. "You have to make him want to release Cas for you to take your angel home. That I can't help you."
It amazed Dean how much the kid had grown. In human years, Jack would be around three years old. But as who he is, Jack is a full-grown man with maturity and patience that probably had passed Dean’s. Maybe he, Sam, and Cas did a good job raising him.
The shorter man smiled at the question, “Let’s get another
past,” Claire spread Nutella on her toast. “When I first came I honestly thought I would see people in leather and chains.”
They went to different campuses, as Castiel studied Ancient Languages and Abaddon went to learn Medical. The twins lived in an apartment located in an area that was right in the middle between their campuses. Their habit of sharing morning after stories came from the days they live in that apartment, as compensation for kicking the other out when one’s having someone over.
on. "Oh, thank you very much, whatever station you are!"
“Thank you, and I also would like regular orange juice. Thanks very much,” he looked to the name tag, “Lily.”
"See ya, Cas."
stubborn."
Dinner.
"Hush," there was a curious glint in Castiel's eyes that Dean hardly saw before.
“Um,” Cas closed his tablet and walked back to the sofa to lie down, “anything would be fine for me, Dean.”
"That's really nice of her," commented Dean, who was supported by Castiel's nod.
Dean slithered his arms around Cas’ shoulders, when he stopped the kiss, to take a look at the angel who was laughing sheepishly. Never in his forty-one year of life, he thought that he would see an angel blushing and giggling as Cas did, and it was a celestial level of cuteness.
The little brother shrugged, as Dean could see from the rear view mirror. “I demand explanation later, then,” he said with a smile.
“Hey, you okay?”
“Yeah, that’s the name. That’s okay, I’m on it for that one, Cas. Anything you want for drink?”
"Well, I'm not using the apartment anymore. Anyway, so you guys will extract Jack's grace so Dean can go to The Empty to rescue his angel?"
"So, how's this process of coming up with a spell?"
"You clearly have given this more thought than you need to."
"Didn't get it. We talked about Game of Thrones and Lord of the Rings."
Castiel shook his head. "That's a pipe dream. It... it would never work out."
"Yeah, well. We'll deal with her at a later time."
"Yeah, I figured that out." There was a soft crunching noise.
Castiel tilted his head. "I thought you wanted this to be temporary."
"No," Dean replied. "I may never eat pancakes or waffles again."
Dean obeyed and watched, amused, at Cas as he sat down across from him. His laptop was also on the table, closed and with a heart shaped box on top. Dean put the book and donuts right next to it.
Dean felt his face burn. He should've known what it was. "Oh. Uhm." He spotted a picture on the desk; the doctor was standing with two women and a man who were around his age and an older man. One of the women was holding a baby in her arms and the younger man had his hands on the shoulders of a little girl with blonde hair. "That her?" he asked, pointing.
"Hey, hey," Dean said, scratching the back of her neck. "Everything is alright. I'm right here. Nothin' is gonna happen my sweet little lady. We'll go back inside, you'll get some ham, and we'll get under the covers in bed, yeah? Toasty and warm and sa-"
"Yes. I enjoyed are time together." He tilted his head. "Did you?"
The two men stayed up late, the TV was always too loud, and  someone kept leaving the toilet seat up. Wet towels were left on the floor, lights were never turned off, cabinets and doors left open, dishes were not put away properly. So far the only positives were that he felt slightly less lonely when he came home from work and he's had more sex in the last thirty-three days than he's had his whole life.
"But her dad and stepm-"
"This is nice," Castiel said in his soothing voice.
"Don't b-" Dean hiccuped. "Fuck."
Dean stopped and pulled him across the street. "You were in the car when I parked."
"A pony, definitely."
"Mm. I think I'll start at 5 or so. And we can eat at 5:30."
Dean shook his head, smiling slightly. "No, Cas. Just annoying."
"Do you think you can take more, Dean?" Cas whispered, low and husky into his ear. He had one hand on Dean's throat, the barest amount of pressure, and the other was pushing three fingers in and out of him.
Bones sniffed. -He doesn't need help.-
Cas sighed. "Did you forget or were you just not listening when I told you about it last month while you were in Texas?"
After dinner and a dessert of chocolate cake, Cas followed Dean back to his own chalet. In his and Sam's room they lied on the bed. His parents and Jo and Sam were playing Catan again, and Dean had the door closed and locked.
"What'd you make for real dinner?" Dean asked as he sprinkled the little chunks.
The first floor of the chalet had a living room with two long couches, one against the wall and the other in the middle of the room, and a smart TV with a blu-ray player attached to it. There was a yellow and black striped rug laid on the maple hardwood floor between the couch and a small dining area. The kitchen was tucked into the corner, fridge and cabinets clean and stocked of only the bare essentials; thingd like salt, pepper, and ketchup.There was a bathroom with a tub and shower and a closet next to it with a washer and dryer and haphazardly stuffed with cleaning supplies.
"Wait. Don't hang up!" Dean pleaded.
He gave Castiel a sidelong glance. It was hard to figure out the way his mind worked, especially lately. When they would have sex at Cas's, there would be about a minute or two where they cleaned themselves up and Dean was allowed to catch his breath before his clothes were handed off to him and he was given the boot. At his own apartment now, Cas obviously couldn't kick him out, but he would roll over and there would be almost a foot of space between them on the bed. Dean always ended up grabbing his pillow and hugging it tight, a terrible pain in his heart.
"I think I dislocated my testicles," Cas groaned, hands gripping his crotch.
Uncle Sammy needs his own Cas, Miracle thought.
"Did you wash your hands?" Dean asked.
Castiel took a deep breath and plastered on a smile that he hoped looked a lot more real than it felt.
"Think you'd have more luck if you went back to looking like a hippie. And why? You have a job."
“Uh, okay. Thanks, Naomi. See you tomorrow.”
"Cas!"
Claire’s response drew a small laugh from Dean, “Yeah, no, sorry. I took your orders, and you had quite some drinks with you tonight, girls. So, either I’m calling a cab or I’m going to drive you all home by myself.”
But when Rowena said that she could also make a spell as Dean requested, he could feel like his hopes just boosted again.
There was another moment of softness in the air after Sam's words.
Eileen’s words brought warmth to Dean; even the rush and chaos inside his mind started to calm after she said that. Not only because of the sweetness of what Eileen told him, but also how her words reminded Dean of what Cas told him the very first time they met.
Claire’s blue eyes shone brighter at Castiel’s offer, “Really? Dad couldn’t have to say no to that.”
Dean released himself into the condom inside Cas. He kept on pumping to ride the orgasm before he finally stopped moving and let Cas drop to his chest once again.
“I, uh … I have a cat.”
Cas was really stunned to see the amount of food Sam could have in one sitting.
“Everything alright with you, brother?” the tall and buffed man started, while moving his bright blue eyes to Dean.
“Jerk.”

He watched his students practised doing some proper lay-ups in the gym hall, and decided that they should do on their own for some moments, before he finally took his phone out again, took a deep breath and start typing.
Dean chuckled as his little brother slammed the door to continue his shower, then he walked back to the dining table. He ate his breakfast while watching the television through the living room’s door. He let out another laugh at an advertisement that showed a beautiful woman giving a seductive smile, with her hair flying around her, only to reveal a second later that she was testing a number of fans that she would like to buy through an online shop.
Castiel had to bit his bottom lip to prevent a smile seeing Dean bending down over his steering wheel and narrowing his eyes while scrunching his face, trying to look up to the top of the building. Based on the information on his folder back at the practice, Dean is thirty-four. And no thirty-four year old man should be as cute as
For the second time that afternoon, Castiel gave Dean the tilt of head, and this time he narrowed his eyes that made him looked utterly confused, “What’s the matter? Is everything alright?”
“Dean, I’ll give you access to the door and elevator now. I’ll see you up here, okay?”
Charlie paused for two seconds before her laughter exploded; it took her a while to realise that some heads turned to their booth’s direction. She stopped and cleared her throat before continuing to interrogate her friend, “Dude,
Dean huffed a smile, right behind Cas’ neck, and he could feel the man in his arms trembled with goosebumps. Dean inhaled the scent in Cas’ hair. He knew it was his shampoo that Cas used, but somehow it gave a different sensation to him. Why did that shampoo never smell this good when he used it?
“Okay. Thanks, Baz. We’ll see how it goes.”
The tall man laughed lightly at the innocent comment, “Yeah, something probably happened along the way, after we broke up. It came as a surprise that he introduced me to Dean, with good intentions for us. But, I’m happy that I can be friends with him again, like we used to back in college.”
“No, thanks. I love my blood pressure as how it is,” Castiel continues driving to the direction of the airport, and felt the huge urge to kick Gabriel out from the car when he heard his phone chirped a text message notification, and the shorter man grabbed his phone faster than he did. “Dammit, Gabriel!”
“Did Lucifer had a phase where he talked back to your dad and then got banished?”
“Jesus, Cas,” Dean let out a low growl in between their kisses. Few moments after that, they stopped for the much needed oxygen, while having their foreheads on each other. “Cas …”
"Dean," Cas caught Dean's shoulder to stopped him from moving, "allow me."
“Ooh, we hug now apparently,” Rowena chuckled and returned the embrace. “Well, Jack suddenly popped down in Hell and asked me if I want to join him visiting you boys. So, it was Charles after all?”
Cas could feel his entire body shivered to the touch, and he really wanted to hold Dean’s hand that was on him, but he couldn’t. He couldn’t even made a verbal response to Dean’s call.
To the janitor closet.
A pair of brown eyes that always glinted with malice was looking straight at Castiel, accompanied with mischievous smile that never failed to made him, reflexively, went stiff and prepared for what sort of plan his colleague had for him this time.
What he felt now was probably his own ego, that was fed a certain amount of pride that he will brought Cas home and introduced him to Sammy, and showing off his bunker. Only to found out that that won’t happen.
“Hey, he tried to give that sick girl everything that make her happy, and she’s … that’s
The older Winchester threw Rowena a faux annoyed look, something that he'd given so often towards people he loved. It didn't take long for Dean to finally decide that it was about time he told them about what happened in the Archive Room a few nights ago.
Since Dean had replaced his thumb with his lips. The kiss was rough and sweet at the same time, it got better when Dean caught Cas’ wrists and pinned them next to his shoulders, then he kissed Cas’ neck again and placed several bites there.
"What makes an angel? Wings? Halo? Grace? Harp? Cas almost didn't have
“Then, why? Dean, I’m not Dad. I’m not gonna judge you for who you wanna be, or be with,” there was a slight hint of hurt in Sam’s voice, and it made Dean’s chest heavy with guilt. “We’ve been having each other’s back since … forever. You’ve been there through my hard times, I’ve been there through yours. So … why not now?”
"Jack," Eileen rose up from her chair and walked to the boy, "I think there's a room in the dungeon with Men of Letters' archives and documents. Let's find something there."
The message made Dean felt a little bit uneasy, then he remembered that Castiel always have a full schedule at his practice.
"Did you know what Cas' true happiness was, Sam?" Dean smiled at his little brother, and without waiting for the answer, he continued. "His true happiness was being open of who he was, to embrace and to accept the emotions and feelings that he had. Even though Cas knew that he couldn't have what he wanted, but the thought of being, of saying how he feels is enough for him. It was so pure, Sammy. As expected of an angel like him."
That was the correct term. Castiel would find someone who could help him release his horniness.
on one of the sliding doors.
hung!”
Cas smiled at the reply. And to his heart beat that suddenly became faster.
Again, Dean had managed to made Cas blushed furiously, then quickly changed the topic, as if nobody had affected of his words. Cas was that close to complain, but soon after he saw the twin emerald eyes before him, he knew that his mind was done for.
drunk and couldn't consent.
Hey, call me?
his first time being manhandled, but this was the first time the other person was bigger and more buffed than him. And it felt fantastic.
They both then continued eating their breakfast in silence, a comfortable silence. Castiel took this moment to look around the place. He just remembered that he didn’t get to check out the area when he arrived since they both were instantly involved in an absurd conversation about their night adventures.
“No worries, angel. Hey, could you help me set up the table? The plates are there,” Dean pointed to one of the top cupboards.
Both men were still for a few moments, enjoying the comfortable silence and pleasure between them until Dean felt that he had gone soft and he could pull himself out from Cas. "Oh, right," he looked to his hand that was covered in Castiel's cum. "I think I had wet wipes inside the compartment."
“They left her, but they ripped out her tongue.”
"So, are you dead?"
“Your brother sounds amazing, Cas.”
“Oh my God, Cassie.
“Cas, hello? Seriously, man, where are you?”
“Well, it’s my big brother’s. He practically gave it to me when I told him I’m moving here to work,” Castiel shrugged at Dean’s reaction and continued the conversation, “what about you, Dean?”
Dean had eaten his pasta before answering the question, and it gave Castiel a time to have his as well. “Yeah, it got its own view. It’s beautiful during winter, with all the snow, you know?”
“Can I kiss you?”
"Shut up," Castiel rumbled again before he pressed his face even deeper to Dean's chest, only to pull away a few moments later with a gasp.
got bored and started to nag Charlie to retreat to their room. The geeky girl then rose from her seat and told Dean that they should continue their discussion in the morning. Then Abaddon dragged her to their room.
“Yes. Eileen should be where she vanished that night, Sam.”
“Cas, thank you.”
Castiel was really taken aback with the familiarity from Dean. It was probably the first time his sexual adventure took an unusual turn from the roommate. "Orange juice sounds good. But, I might pass on the pancakes. I already have a plan to meet someone, uh, my sister."
"She put a spell on me, something that hurt my heart from the inside, and Cas helped me. He took me to the dungeon, 7B, and he put a spell on the door that could stop Billie, but only temporary, I guess. We were trapped, there was no way out from that room. I know-I know that once Billie got through, Cas would step in to
Crowley agreed with his mother, which is surprising for the Winchesters. He also said that he'd returned to Death's Chamber to see what he can do with the place. He even gave Dean a new Death's Door key, just in case he'd needed it since the last one they had was destroyed by Billie.
“I’ll just park outside, if that’s alright. I don’t want to pay for the parking,” Dean grinned cheekily, then he moved a little bit further and halted the car.
"Good morning to you too, sister mine."
entity."
“You’re in a good mood today,” Samuel suddenly appears in the dining room, (almost) all dry and nicely clothed. “Ooh, pancakes!” he rubbed his hands together, then stalked the fridge and came back minutes later with a variety of vegetables in a bowl, he then made a veggie wrap with his pancakes.
from the corner of his eye. Someone with dark floppy hair and moved in slight awkwardness. Dean turned his face to the direction of the man. Dark hair, eyes so blue that it would be visible in the dark, like a cat. Especially now that they were so wide in surprise. At the sight of him, perhaps.
Cas chuckled at Dean’s enthusiasm, “Yeah, it was good. I watched it with Claire few years ago, I think.”
"Huh. I knew that Cas could have that dom potential, but I didn't expect him to be a Nazi," Crowley wondered and clearly was talking to himself, more than to others.
"Well, well. It's been a while since I saw you boys."
He smiled at Cas' sleeping face. He still looked angelic when he slept. Dean fixed the blanket that was now only covering Cas' legs, and he ran his fingers over the fluffy dark hair. He smiled when there was no reaction from Cas, seemed like the angel was really exhausted from all of the excitement today. Dean bent down to plant a kiss on top of Cas' head, but when he turned around and about to lay down on the next bed, he felt his pants were tugged softly.
“Yeah, about
Dean ended the conversation and announce to the room, “I’ve got a six o’clock appointment now, so I can go to that meeting later.”
“Huh, he looked alright. Let me know how it is tomorrow, okay?”
into women.
The small canteen is mostly visited by the employees of the building across his practice. It was only a small room with square-shaped windows on top, near the ceiling, and there were four long tables and benches for customers to sit on while enjoying their meal.
“Did you just fucking giggle?”
As quick as the light came, it also went in a flash.
Again, Dean chuckled at his brother's reply, "Yeah, thought so. Anyway, the case went downhill and ... I died."
“No. I think Fergus shielded himself from any power to find him, even from my magic,” Rowena shrugged lightly, “Well, maybe if he wanted to, he’d find me.”
That was Dean's cue to add another finger and enjoyed another sexual sound that came from Castiel. A former angel of the Lord.
"Exactly," Crowley smirked and made a finger gun at Dean.
“I got the table, Cas, upstairs, okay?”
The last message was sent seven minutes ago, so Cas only had three minutes to let Dean know that he had arrived. He quickly dialled Dean’s number and waited until the other man picked up.
Dean turned to the next table, "Anything I can help?"
same thing!”
"You-you made me a human?"
Should he ask Cas about this? But will it be awkward? No, Dean couldn’t do that. Not when the day went really well.
"Uh, yeah, just a bit surprised. My phone fell”, she started looking on the floor.
“What do you mean?” curiosity filled Jack’s eyes as he asked this, and he did a squint that was obviously clear where he learnt it from.
Had Dean suddenly turn his attention to him made Jack jump a bit. He looked up to Dean and continued what he started as his hand flew to the back of his head and scratched nervously, "I have to agree with Sam in this, Dean. We just managed to defeat Chuck, and life started to go well and somewhat normal for us. I couldn't bear to have another family member die of a deal or sacrificing oneself to another. I'd rather we do another way."
“Well, yeah, Cas. I like dogs,” the smile in Dean’s voice made Cas released an exhale that he didn’t knew he was holding. “You want to bring the puppy?”
"That's unusual of you, Dean. You're usually the shoot-first-ask-questions-later type."
"Are you fucking insane? That plan is
Jack shared a similar horror expression on his face.
The man turned, and as he saw who was behind him, he got up, "Hey. You're up."
The so-done expression that was shown on the little brother’s face had said enough of his unsaid opinion. “Yeah, or vampires.”
risky!"
Castiel looked up to Dean, there was a hint of surprise in his eyes that was mixed with sadness. He was expecting Dean to start talking about the last time he died, that Cas opened up his whole heart to Dean before The Empty claimed him. But turned out, it wasn’t, it was even more painful for him to hear that Dean was having a miserable time after he was gone.
“Okay, let’s get back to the bunker, then,” Dean shuffled to the driver’s side of Baby, “we still have things to do there anyway.”
“Okay, your name, Sir?” the woman on the line asked accompanied by faint sounds of clicking keyboard.
He was home.
Of course, the Blue Remington that could be found here is nothing like that. Instead, since the owner is a fan of the genre of film - and music - the name seemed suitable with the ambience and atmosphere of a bar. It’s the place where everyone knows everyone, the guests who dropped by seemed to bond a tight community where they could share a laugh, drinks, a few games of pool or darts, and on weekends they will burst out to mass karaoke sessions.
Cas eyed widened at that statement. He didn’t expected Dean to actually do what he said before, but this was really surprising for him. Not that he didn’t believe Dean before, but this still came as a surprise for him.
When he arrived in his room, Dean took a quick shower and lay down on his bed, staring at the ceiling for a few moments before remembering what Charlie told him before. Dean reached for him phone, and opened the Message application. He got a picture message from Charlie.
“Oh, yeah. Gabriel introduced us before.”
upset at me and decided to reject me."
with your patient?”
“I know, right? I mean, what if someone was in a critical condition and he couldn’t afford the big hospital rightaway? He or she might never survive this process.”
Sam then sucked his teeth at the question, “Okay, I was quite sure we have the thing here in the bunker somewhere, but Eileen and I need to look for it first.”
It was a delicious meal, the grilled chicken satay was dipped in a mix of peanut and soy sauce and slices of chili, and it even more savoury to be eaten with rice. Dean thanked the Almighty for whoever created this food. For a brief moment he forgot about the dark-haired man, and was too busy enjoying his food. It was until when he’s halfway eaten his food, Dean looked for the man who attracted his attention before.
the process of getting to know each other and everything? That sounds exhausting.”
Castiel did the head tilt that made him looked like a confused kitten, “What happened to their parents? If I may know.”
“Hello, Charlie.”
"Come for me, Castiel."
Something on the back of Dean’s mind told him that whatever he had with the adorable man might work out.
From the times he spent with Dean — both of them — he was quite sure that Dean was queer, at least a bisexual. He even foolishly believed that there was something to look forward to from the time they talked for a long time at the park, that they even exchanged numbers. Unusual for him, Castiel also thought that there might be something that he could look forward to from knowing Dean. From the way he treated Castiel from the very first moment they met to their meet up at the park. Including the number exchange. Apparently, Dean Winchester was just a really thoughtful person.
“Aaw, you’re very loving, my love,” Balthazar stretched his arm over Cas’ face to run the back of his hand on Dean’s cheek, who ignored it and continue eating.
After Crowley’s black vehicle dissapeared from their sights, Balthazar turned his attention to his friend. “Where do you park, Cassie?” he ran a back of his finger on Castiel’s cheekbone, while the younger man was wearing his leather jacket on.
“What about
“It’s called
It didn't take long for Dean to reached his own climax, and he released it into the condom while still having his dick inside Cas. "Oh fuck," he groaned and placed his head on Cas' chest while he caught his breath.
, just now!” Charlie pointed a finger to Castiel's face and made a circle around it. The smile on her face grew wider when she knew that the man who sat opposite him was going to throw a disapproval note. Unfortunately, it was cut when a woman’s voice called before them, to Castiel’s name.
“No,” once again, Claire and Jack gave their answer at the same time. Another trait of them that easily made people mistaken them as twins.
“Yeah, I guess I was lucky that nothing bad happened to me. I checked in the morning; there were no bruises or anything. But then, something’s more interesting came in the morning after.”
"Oh, you heard about that?"
“Oh, okay.”
When the door slide close before him.
* * *
“Yes, Doctor Novak?” She quickly stood up, and flashed that smile that made Castiel feels a little uneasy for some reasons, along with her unnatural thick eyebrows, that she had to retouch every
Castiel gave a small wave to Naomi and walked out to the car that had been waiting for him. He tapped his pocket once to make sure that he brought home his motorbike’s keys, even though he left the vehicle at work, due to carrying the box for his new kitten. “Let’s go home, Cat.”
“Hey, you girls alright there?”
"Well, it wasn't," again, Death deadpanned on his answer. "I did say that someone up there might be responsible for this, but it might get something to do with this ring."
scratch it. Claire, no drink and drive, if I ever get a phone call from the police station, for whatever reason, I won’t be bailing you. You’ll be staying there for the night. Or however long they told you to. Is everybody happy?”
“Yeah?”
The way Dean looked at him all night was enough to make Castiel weak on the knees. He had lost count on how many times his breath was choked in his throat, and his heart drummed so loud every time he looked into the beautiful jade spheres that were Dean’s eyes.
“What time is your next period, Dean?” Cas quickly threw a topic before Dean realised what effect he gave to him.
“What? What’s wrong, Cas?” the sudden urgency in Cas’ voice made Dean stopped and almost get inside of his car again.
The blue-eyed man laughed at the last question and answered his friend sincerely, “No, I didn’t tell her. I never intentioned to stalk around my workplace, announcing my sexuality, thank you very much. Those days are way behind me.”
Cas shut his eyes and tried to calm himself down. Probably it was a futile action, since on the next second he felt Dean was leaning his forehead on his while copied him panting softly. It took him a while before Cas finally opened his eyes fully and looked into Dean’s eyes. The man before him was smiling widely with his face still flushed from their previous activity.
Yes, it might sound like something out of a cheesy romantic comedy or novel, and it would end with the ultimate pair to kiss and watch sunset together or something like that. But, will it really going to be like that? This is real life, it would be better to be a little bit more cautious than sorry, right? You never know what will be written for you in the future.
“Shit,
“Where did you learn those words?”
Sam shrugged, “I think the library will do. Join us whenever you’re ready, Dean.”
“What do you mean you lost your keys, Sammy? Well, I’m not in the city but I’m not far, you wanna wait? Why do you wanna know? Okay, just wait there, I’ll be home in fifteen minutes.”
“Nah, rabbit food is Sammy’s area,” Dean shook his head animatedly while answering that, and it made Cas laughed. It was clear on his face that he was proud of himself for making the dentist did so.
"Okay, then do you have anything? Any plan
They talked about the moments that were missing throughout the twelve years of them knowing each other, they laughed about the stupidity that happened between them. They also thought that they should give Sam an apology present for giving them a hard time with their bickering.
“What?”
when that happens. Of course, Pamela would snap him after for not helping, even though she knew that she wouldn’t need any. Then Dean would reply that he didn’t want to take out all the fun she was having.
“Dean,” Castiel chuckled at the cheeky question, “his name is Dean. Well, it was good so far, we started to get to know each other, and he’s an interesting person. He’s gorgeous, mind you.”
“Cas, what happened?” Dean could feel his own panic attack crawled from his stomach.
Dean shook his head at the idea, “Jack, your grandfather killed you. Twice. That won’t be a memory you want to re-experience.”
Dean wasn’t wrong when he said that this house is a bunker, because it really was what it looked like. There was only one door greeted him. A heavy iron one from the look at it. Although it can be seen that there was a building on the back, that looked like the rooftop of a castle. Whoever designed this place must be heavily inspired by the middle ages.
If they were not on the phone, Dean was sure that he and Cas would exchange look, like those in chick flicks. But, somehow, Dean didn’t mind having a staring contest with Cas. He could never knew, when he could take his eyes off those beautiful blue orbs. Everytime Cas was looking at him, it was like he was looking into Dean’s soul and he liked what he saw. It felt amazing to see Cas’ expression whenever they looked at each other.
"Okay, Dean," Cas placed his hands on each side of Dean's head and brought the older Winchester's forehead to meet his.
“It was worrying that you and Chuck even
“Okay! Ghibli marathon, Cas,” Dean corrected his own words, “so, you’re, uh, ready for bed now?”
This time, he knew that the future that waited for him, and everyone in the bunker later, would be their own. They would write their own destiny, not Chuck.
"Well, if I was the valet girl, I'd try to get as
Castiel pet the head of his new kitten, “I wish he wasn’t my patient,” he admitted.
“Which means it would take around midnight for this to finish.”
As the call ended, Dean released the breath he didn't know he was holding. He'll be seeing Cas soon. Didn't they just met yesterday?
“Of course, Dean,” Cas nodded his head to no one in particular. “Enjoy the movie.”
He almost jumped from the chair when he heard the low voice, and when Dean looked up there stood the man he was panicking for. “Jesus, Cas! You scared me.”
After years living on his own in some dirty apartments or rents, only with his brother, he still couldn’t believe that his grandfather – whom he had never met before – had bequeathed a house just on the suburban area for him and his younger brother. ‘A house’ probably wouldn’t do justice for what the building actually is, it’s more like a bunker.
Jack raised his eyebrows in puzzlement, “What’s wrong with the name? It sounded like a good name.”
“What? Why should I? Why are you calling again, Gabe?” Castiel straightened his back, as he could hear his big brother laughed menacingly and he became even more suspicious of the purpose of the call.
If he thought about it, that might have sounded fair, since Cas probably hadn't been asleep since he became an angel again a few years ago. Dean turned and suddenly had Castiel's face nuzzled to his chest, which he wasn't sure if the other man did it on purpose or he did it in his sleep.
Cas gave a smirk as a reply to Dean, then he put the empty wine glass on the stone railing a bit far away from him. He looked up to Dean, who was standing next to him, smiling. He knew he could never forget the look on Dean’s eyes that night, it was soft and loving. It was like he just found the very reason of his mission on earth.
archangel Michael?"
"Yeah, yeah, it's in the car. Sammy! Hey, Sam!"
Just like usual, the big brother could always found the perfect time to crack a joke in their serious moments.
Ooh, look at that! We've passed the fifth chapter now! Thank you so much for y'all who had read this new fic of mine (even though I still have one ongoing and it's practically hanging now), I even saw some of you leaving Kudos and Bookmarked this one. That's very sweet of you guys!
“So, Cas, how was your adventure in The Empty? Oh, do you like the whisky, or do you want a beer instead?” Dean was now leaning his backside on the war table between Rowena and Jack. He smiled as he watched them went all excited in seeing Castiel again. Dean could feel there was a slight flutter of butterflies in his stomach when Cas stopped walking and stood right before him.
If Cas had to name one of his favourite moments in his life, this would be on the top three.
children would take it?"
Suddenly came the Scottish-accented voice around the car.
Dean threw a look at his little brother. He knew that Sam would forgive Chuck, Sam was the one with more compassion compared to him. Yet, Dean also knew that if he murdered God right there and then, Sam would understand. He probably wouldn’t stop Dean to do that. For once, Sam probably could just close his eyes for it.
“With you niece?”
“That’s perfect, thank you …?”
person or have to go through
“What? Does it have to have a mission behind?”
Castiel barked a burst of laughter, "Really, Charlie? From all the mess that happened before, you got time to eye my cousin?"
Just in time there was a knock on his door.
“I can’t feel my powers,” Jack repeated, “I don’t know what happene-.”
"Oh no, sweetie. I'm so sorry," Rowena walked closer to Dean and embraced him in a hug.
“Yeah. The spell worked divinely.”
The man in his arms pulled back and looked up to Dean. “Yes, Dean?”
"Oh, fuck, come on, Cas," Dean groaned as he gripped Cas' hips harder and slapped his ass once in a while, making the former angel let out wanton gasps.
They had almost finished the first glass when Castiel's eyes caught Dean was walking from the bathroom direction and approaching them. In a way, he was grateful that Charlie asked where the alcoholic drinks were before they came into the house. At least the effect after he drank the wine would disguise the blushing shades and heated sensation on his face.
“I’m sorry. I don’t know why my nose suddenly got so itchy,” Dean took another leaf of tissue from the desk. “Yes, you were saying?”
“Dude, I’m a girl, I
“You’re still beautiful as ever, Cassie.”
The Empty somehow looked satisfied with the answer given, then he made a sitting movement. At that moment, the black goo that surrounded him before started to make a shape that looked like a chair with a Gothic regal design.
The look on Dean’s face was actually enough for Cas to plot his little revenge, however he had completely smitten by the man that he got lost for words.
. You should know it from me."
And why in the world his response sounded like a widower who had to deal with his child's question about his late spouse?
“Fuck, Cas,” Dean repeated before kissing Cas again, even when he was saying the following words, “Come on. I’ll. Show you. To. Your room.”
Crowley stopped on his steps and looked at Eileen, "On behalf of my Hellhound, I apologise. I didn't expect Ketch to release my hounds to you in such a cowardly manner. I expect him to go for these lumberjacks."
“Hey, Cas,” another smile was shown on Dean’s face, and he looked sincerely happy when Cas accepted his video-call, the grin that was plastered on his face had made Cas almost certain that the man was high on something.
gardening. Can you believe it? Bobby Singer knitting and gardening!” Ellen chuckled and handed Dean a bowl of salad. “Stop peeking, take this to the table, and get Bobby. He was busy at the garage last time I see. Would be great if he could help me here once in a while.”
. While he knew that both Jack and Claire weren't shallow, it would still be a challenge for Castiel to come out to his children. Especially after
choice.”
The answer made Dean started to notice that the jealousy rose from the interest that was shared between Cas and Sam.
Charlie’s facial expression scrunched even more when she heard Castiel’s reply, “You couldn’t come up with something better, could you? Some people go for a walk or buy snacks for breaks. You just have to go and
, Castiel was served with a monologue on what are the ingredients the cafe used for both cat food and dog food. The explanation also included nutritions that are best for Siberian Huskies and domestic cats, that Castiel actually had known from his vet. Still, he really appreciated that the cashier person learnt
Hello, Dean. That’s ok, I was talking with Claire and Gabriel anyway. Still up and unfolding the sofa bed for Gabriel and me. Claire had went to bed upstairs.
“Let him off, Winchester, you love your chick flick,” Charlie got up from her seat and switched the film.
“No,” Cas shook his head and laugh, his eyes narrowed and there were soft wrinkles on the corners of his eyes.
When they entered a bar by the name of Blue Remington.
There was a long silence in the room after Jack said that, it seemed like everyone was lost in their own thoughts after hearing the innocent words from Jack, that was deep and brought meaning to each of them.
“Dean, are you okay?”
“So, what is this event about?” Charlie asked, probably she had gave up on the discussion of such serious topic on a Saturday night, “You guys promised to tell me on our way.”
Cas ordered a big plate of green salad and salmon fillet. God knows why did he chose that, but seeing the excited look on the dark-haired man as he saw the dish in front of him managed to make Dean ignored whatever reason came pass. If Cas wanted to eat a horse, and it will bring that smile to his face, Dean will personally shop for the horse.
“Ah, that’s why you and Dean were both surprised,” Sam shot a smug smirk to his big brother.
smitten.”
many?” she groaned softly.
“Maybe it would be better if all of us take a rest first. It had been a long day for us,” Eileen smiled and rose to her feet, right at the moment Sam stepped back into the library.
“So, Castiel, how did you and Dean met?” Sam opened the conversation, and Dean prayed to the Heavens – and the
“Whoa, whoa, one at the time, please?” Dean raised one of his hands that were not on the steering wheel. “Balthazar, Charlie, thank you, and Sammy, yes, Cas is my Friday dinner guest.”
He gulped down cold water through cupped hands and walked back to his room. Sam singing softly to the baby. It was a song Jack didn't know, and he quickly and quietly ran to his room and shut the door so he wouldn't hear anymore.
Cas stared at a chip in the paint in the wall behind Dean. I miss you, too, he thought. "You'll live. You were fine there before we met."
"Hey, uh, Dean," Charlie said. "Can I ask you something kind of random?"
“What? Come on, it’s, well, quite the stereotype of the BDSM activities. It’s just no wonder if many people thought of that,” Castiel tried to defend himself. “Okay, except for the BDSM ambience, what else can you tell me about the place. I’m curious.”
“Hey, Cas, you got a-” Dean lifted his hand and reflexively took a napkin then wiped the cream off, but somehow his hand didn’t stopped there, they moved to Cas’ lower lip and he brushed them softly. The way Castiel parted his lips when Dean cleaned his mouth was really inviting. Dean had to work all his muscles to
It was strange to Dean as they both could talk spontaneously and excitedly on the phone before, but now once they finally met it felt difficult just to find a decent topic to talk about. He watched as Cas looked around and stopped at some objects that grabbed his attention.
“Yeah, I’m driving. But, it’s alright. Thank you, Dean,” Cas received the drink from Dean and took a sip, then he had lost count how many times he and Dean got involved in a staring contest that night, and he actually enjoyed all of them. Only this time, he felt like he should say something. He didn’t want to send the wrong signals to Dean.
“From the change of your look, it means yes. Glad it worked out for you,” Benny jumped off Dean’s desk and went to his own.
Cas smiled reading Dean’s rant on his phone, so he put down the beddings on the coffee table and replied.
The Impala went to a halt on the traffic light, and Dean turned the tape on, to one of his mix tape that he made few years ago. It was when the song got to one of those classic rock love ballad, that Dean smiled goofily to himself and made Sam noticed.
“Oh, this is so cute!” the red head squealed, “Look at those colours! Damn, now I’m craving for some sweets!”
“No, completely clueless.”
Even still with confusion in his eyes, Cas did what Dean told him to. Soon as Cas had his back on Dean, the larger man trapped his guest in his arms. One arm acted as a pillow for Cas, and the other circled the dentist’s waist.
“You okay?”
Cas turned the lights on and pouted, “What do you mean like me?”
For this chapter, i borrowed a story from a friend of mine who had many experience while taking the bus to work, i had told him that i wanted to borrow his story for this, and he allowed it. Yay!
. At least he would get a full 40-minutes of privacy while both of them are arguing about the impossible plot of the medical soap opera.
Gabriel laughed, "What, you're stalking your old crush's Facebook?"
"Okay. Thanks, Crowley. Oh, do you know anything about something being loud in there? Because Jack said when he was pulled out from The Empty the last time, it mentioned something about Jack made it loud, and it was furious."
Gabriel looked at Sam from his head to feet, as if he just realised the size of Sam’s physique. “You’re right, Samsquatch. What if we just leave them here, and let them find their own cab to go home?”
“Six times.”
He could feel Cas went stiff and awkward again, and Dean didn’t blame him for that. The question he just shot just went wrong in every way. He sounded exactly how he avoided it to be, someone with a hidden agenda.
He couldn’t contain his laughter and tears of joy when he heard his name rolled from Castiel’s mouth. He missed that silly husky voice. Dean invaded Cas’ personal space in one step and bumped him with a bear hug. He could feel Cas squinted in confusion and, if he could, he might tilt his head as well, but Dean didn’t care. He broke the hug and placed both of his hands tenderly on the sides of Cas’ face.
," Crowley unbuttoned his suit jacket and pulled a chair in front of Rowena to sit there. He smiled at his mother for a second before had his attention to the older Winchester again. "First, to answer your earlier question, yes, when I died in the alternate universe, I was awakened at The Empty. A lonely and depressing place, where you could hardly see anything and hear anything. There was practically nothing in there, I almost lost my mind staying there, can you imagine?"
“You would be too if you get to my age and find that there’s a rodent in the house,” Bobby rolled his eyes before stepped forward to give Dean a hug. “How are you, boy? The bar’s good?”
“No, you haven’t, Dean.”
“Thank you, Dean. You’re really kind,” Cas looked up to the PE Teacher, with a look that might as well was a neon sign declaring his love for the man before him.
"To be fair, he was a dick angel at the time," Dean raised his hands to defend himself. "Long story short, he swallowed half of the souls in Purgatory to win the Civil War in Heaven. Then he claimed himself as the new God, and went murdering people who he didn't see eye to eye with."
He was open about himself, he was loved for being who he is.
– he got another chance to see the colour of the sky during sunrise while having his lunch.
Dean could hear a soft chuckle from the intercom, “Hello, Dean. Yeah, I could see you. There’s a camera on there.”
Castiel smiled when he remembered the small talk with one Samuel Winchester after he and Dean kissed, and how he turned out knowing about Lucifer. "Oh, Sam knew about Luci. We were talking before and when we talk about brothers, he mention Luci."
"All those questions you throw at me, you were finding the flaws in my rules, aren't you?"
Sam slung his arm around Eileen and said to Dean, “So, hey, you don’t mind having Jack with you here? He could give you a company for the drive home.”
“Yeah, yeah, I had checked myself in the mirror. There were no signs of violence whatsoever. I think this man was just post-one night stand
Dean took a deep breath, to calm himself down. He had to be patient now, so many things had happened in the past twenty-four hours, and they had to sort everything out first before he could start thinking about what he wanted.
"If you put it that way."
Unfortunately for Castiel, just after Abaddon threw that question to him, a waitress came to their table for their orders. Obviously, the poor middle-aged lady heard the semi-announcement from the stunning woman sitting in the booth. It could be seen in her sour expression as she looked
Dean turned to Jack and gave the kid an awkward smile, which was returned with a knowing and understanding one from the Nephilim. “So, you think you can pull Cas again from The Empty this time, Jack? What did you do the last time?”
Of course, he didn't have any plan to be in a serious relationship now, but wouldn't it be better not to say never?
But, of course, he couldn’t say that to Bobby and Ellen. Even though they’re not his biological parents, but Dean can expect that they would love to have grandchildren from him and Sammy. Something that he was quite sure that he couldn’t give them. Dean just couldn’t bear with the disappointment on their face when the time came.
"I'm so jealous of this Castiel."
"He did. You should be proud of him," Cas said lovingly, like a father to his son.
your fault. Just never do it again? As you promised right after that reaper killed you?"
Dean parked his beloved Impala at the parking lot of the building, and walked to the food court. He had tried the Marv’s before, and he was thinking to give another stall a try. Probably the one that he saw was producing deliciously smelled fog all around the place when he was here before.
“Yeah, I need you to be more specific, buddy.”
Dean finally knew what people were saying about butterflies in the stomach, when he saw Castiel’s shy smile after he shot out the question. “I-I’m going home. I don’t bring my bike today, so …”
Once again, both Eileen and Jack expressed their agreement to Dean's words, by nodding vigorously in unison while eating the sandwiches.
Claire turned her beautiful blonde head to the direction of the living room, “Not yet. I’ve seen this episode, though. Gabriel hasn’t. So, friend of yours?” she asked as turning her head back to Cas’ direction.
“No, no, Dean, that’s okay. I, uh, it was a surprise indeed. But a nice one,” and there it went again, the unintentional smile. Cas should have his facial muscle checked one of these days.
"I never saw you this bummed from the idea of losing someone."
So was The Empty.
The sound of people arguing brought Castiel to his consciousness, and it seemed like he had fallen asleep while watching
“Are you taking my photo, Crowley?”
Castiel laughed at his friend’s comment, and then he leaned forward to take some chips from the small bucket on the table.
“That’s awesome.”
Before Dean could answer, there was a familiar sound of whooshing and a flap of wings.
“Hey, Cas, have you tried – how to read this? – ren…dang?
nights,” Castiel said in a faux solemn voice that lasted less than five seconds before he finally laughed again.
Rowena tilted her head, "When it comes to you two, we always agreed on it, dear. Now, who's gonna share it with the class between you two?"
I promise i'll update it more often! As an apology, i'll give you TWO chapters.
“Excuse me,” Castiel called the young man who was cleaning up the dirty plates from the tables.
Or he needed to wake up.
“He is. Well, he’s better as a friend than lover anyway for me, so we’re totally good now,” Castiel drove his car to an exit, the GPS on his phone showed that the place Gabriel meant was not far from there.
"I, uh, I was … I just ended a long, long and messy relationship, and I met Abaddon at the gym. We talked and found that we have some things in common. Next thing we knew, we got close," Dean started his story groggily. He was also looking at the almost empty glass in his hands as if it was the most interesting almost empty glass he'd ever seen. "She's, uh, she's terrific. She wouldn't take any shit from anybody, and she's sharp. So … yeah."
Lucifer shrugged it off as he sat down.
"We're expected to have a full crowd."
"Yeah, Lucifer told me you would be by. I just need to get the kids to school. They're just about ready to go."
"I like to read. I can't read the really big words by myself, though."
"I never really got that feeling from John."
"Is there anything that you love to do?" Mr. Novak asked him.
"You look way too happy," Benny informed him.
"Probably in the back. That's where they keep people until they testify in order to prevent witness tampering. It's pretty common in cases this big. She'll be back there until she's done."
"And you're going to call me every day so that I know that you're okay."
Once the car was out of sight, John led the two down the street that would lead directly to Bobby's junkyard. The two were silent, holding hands and swing them between each other, walking down the street with the nagging feeling that John had just wouldn't be ignored.
Zachariah heading into the forest at a small dirt road, the slow drive continuing making sure nothing was out of place on the road. It soon opened to a vast expanse, revealing a parking lot and shiny building, entirely out of place for the middle of the forest.
"Sounds interesting, buddy. We can talk about it on the way home and over dinner."
"Had to prove something. He didn't get anything. Unfortunately, I found out a lot more than I would care to. Something we should not talk about here. Too many ears."
"Stop playing coy and tell me what she said."
He watched the children run wild inside of whatever imaginary world they had imagined for themselves, away from the troubles of the world, for the most part. Cas had noticed Sam giving him looks every now and again. The pup was too smart for his own good.
"What was that?" Bobby, the first one to ask.
"You need to keep your strength up. Eat and then go to sleep before the thoughts get too bad. I have a feeling that the intrusion will get worse the closer they get. That goes for all of you," Celine ended, looking at everyone sternly. "We all need to be in top shape to have a hope and a prayer of dealing with tomorrow."
They responded with panic looks on their faces. They looked at each other, having a silent conversation between themselves.
"How may I help you, sir?" the man said with interest. I wouldn't surprise if he saw practically no one in his position and was excited to actually be talking to anyone.
"Well..., no," Cas admitted. "Micheal doesn't know."
Dr. Robertson quickly walked back down the hallway and soon disappeared from view. The only sound that followed him was the sound of his footsteps, and the bang of a wooden door closing.
"They're fine. I'm going to take them out of here and call some beat cops."
"I'll take you anyway: cursed or not."
"Cause you don't know a thing, right?" Sam asked, more like said, at John. Even if he was his father, he still had the right to be angry.
"When I asked about the list of witnesses the prosecution would bring up, you mentioned nothing before."
"For the apocalypse to occur, Sam and Dean needed to be born."
At the lack of response, the woman went ahead and felt around the injured paw. Except for a slight whimpering from Maddie, there was nothing of concern.
"Maybe we can go some other time," Sam said with a disappointed tone.
Dean looked closer at all of the information in front of him, squinting as he looked through the stack. "Did you say that you were adopted when y'all were young children?"
Maddie looked around at the people around her, considering the option deeply. "No, thank you."
"Yeah?"
It took her a bit for her to realize that she was saying that John was bad. She stared at the man, wide-eyed. "You're not John, are you?"
"We're actually going to Mount Rushmore. We can make a detour through there," the passenger said after consulting the driver.
"What are you?" he demanded. "What do you want?"
"Then why did it take so long to catch our parents?" Gabe asked.
"No one's going to like us stepping on toes if this does spread out."
"Yes, the person we're here for has arrived," Amara said, putting the onesie to the side. "You two, have you come up with names for the pup yet? I have a suggestion."
"A bright soul belongs to a good person. The more bad deeds a person does, the darker the soul becomes," Cas explained.
Walking into the room, he said, "So, I hear that some little ones want to hear a story."
"Children?" he asked, confused for a second before settling on the three children, more confused than anything else, around the table.
"Alright," she said as she came back out of the room, "I'm going to direct you to my car, so I can give you a car seat," she said to Dean. Toward Benny, she said, I'll be back up shortly to go over some of the paperwork that will go into this case."
Everyone looked over to Castiel. He was frozen in place with a far-off look in his eyes, which usually happened when he was conversing on Angel Radio.
"Do you remember where you went afterward?" Dean asked.
"Eyes burning?" Celine asked.
Lucifer looked at the two sitting in front of him, looking pretty cozy. It wasn't hard to get information on one Dean Winchester, thanks to some old contacts that he had around. They would be working in the same department, which would make it a lot easier to keep an eye on him. He didn't think that he would have something to show his brother this quick, but the sooner this was over, the better.
"What were the FBI's next steps?"
Cas's eyes cleared up significantly and gave Dean a gummy smile. "Are you sure?"
"It would be faster than figuring out how to separate everyone again," Sam agreed. "You take right while we take left."
"It'll be good practice for our own children."
Gabe held his hands over his ears. "I can't hear you. Were you saying how awesome candy is? I thought so. I can tell you all about the history of chocolate and how it changed the course of world history."
Before Dean could run at them, the two disappeared in a puff of sulfur. He collapsed to his knees and continued to stare at the spot where they disappeared. The rest of the group walked into the room, through the door of that room.
Footsteps were heard slowly coming down the staircase with Dean leading Cas back into the living room. Although it wasn't long, the angel was already looking better.
"Yes, Sam."
"Even if you monitor the entire thing? I really need to make a call. Doesn't everyone get one call?" Dean ended sarcastically.
Hands lifted up everywhere before Ms. Harvelle pointed to one of the journalists.
"This was not the way we wanted to tell you," Dean said sheepishly.
Mary quickly changed into a comfortable outfit for today, especially if they were going to be facing a witch. She walked out of the room and toward the one next door. Unlike the previous day, the lights were on signaling that the occupants were awake. She knocked firmly on the door until it opened. Once again, it was Sam who greeted her at the door.
“Okay, here you are, Charlie. Thanks for the fun weekend,” Dean stopped his car and climbed out to help the girl with all of her stuffs.
Sound of a clapping hands awaken Dean from his personal thoughts. “What?”
steakhouse nearby,” the shorter man flashed out his cheeky grin, knowing that his friend could
“Night, Cas.”
"So, that night when Dean and I returned to the bunker to find Billie, that was the night when it happened. Dean and I were cornered in the Archive Room, with Billie on our tails. I knew that I had to save at least one of us. So I told Dean about the deal."
It was then all excitement and impulsiveness from him, as Dean brought Cas' face closer and kissed him.
“Because it’s my turn to cook, Cas,” Dean answered shortly.
“Ah, it would be alright,” Crowley waved his hand lightly, “Juliet was gentle, she wasn’t into attacking other smaller animals, really. Everytime I took her for a walk, she would wag her tail madly when she saw cats or squirrels!”
The green light beamed, “Okay, let’s take a step back and start with … you kinda always knew?”
The British dentist looked at Castiel as if he just sported a brand new leg on top of his head. “You’re still daft as ever,” he mumbled, and when his friend returned the look, Crowley decided that he had to elaborate. “Come on, Castiel, you had dinner with him and he willed to see you again. It’s not rocket science, mate. Where did you guys had dinner?”
was when I drew the line.”
But he couldn’t.
Dean smiled as he offered his elbow for Rowena to grab as they walked to the others on the centre table. After Rowena went to sit in front of Sam, who looked confused with one of the books he read, Dean leaned his bottom on the table next to the other four people who were sitting on.
“Oh, fuck yeah,” once again that night, Mick was on his knees and sucked Castiel’s dick.
Dean sighed lazily while pouring himself a glass of scotch, "Well, turned out Chuck wasn't as good as he said. This Earth and the other universe, including the one you were dead with, were his creation and he meant it as his ant project."
Having a family breakfast, or brunch, at Bobby and Ellen’s is something that they regularly do on Saturdays. However, this week they were having it on Sunday since Bobby had a house call to fix a car of one of his notable clients. Most of the time, breakfast would even stretch all the way to dinner. It was one of the favourite moments for Sam and Dean because they know that the moment they stepped into the vintage house, they were children again, even if it’s only for a day.
“Oh, um … is your show finished?” Cas asked, and cursed silently in his mind when he heard Dean’s giggle.
There was a mild reaction on Crowley's face that actually was hard to see, except when you knew him as much as Dean Winchester did.
The middle-aged man with curly hair and dark brown jacket went over Funko Pops collection aligned neatly, even arranged, along with a diorama on their surroundings. Created a perfect scene that seemed like it has its own personality and character.
“So, uh, you have any plan in mind?” Dean drummed his fingers on Cas’ helmet. “Watch a movie, dinner, anything?”
Cas raised his eyebrows at the question, “What is that, Dean?”
“I-what? How is Cas and I are parents to you?”
“I don’t want anything to be weird between us, Cas.”
Dean, I’m not into incest!”
In the kitchen, Dean opened the fridge and took a bottle of beer out. He knew that he had to start somewhere, and this book might be it. However, Dean couldn’t help to have his mind playing with him.
quiet—the perfect settings to drive your mind insane. I mean, at least in my Hell the torture I'd give you was a hallucination. Here, you're just on your own."
? After the dinner they had yesterday?
“Cas?”
Matcha.
"Cas, welcome back!" Sam laughed and ambushed the angel in a bear hug. "I can't believe my idiot brother's plan actually worked."
“Hi, Dean.”
Now, Castiel lived in the penthouse at one of the posh apartments, just outside the city, all by himself, and he owned an SUV and a motorbike to go around.
The blonde man let out a ring of laughter, that sent warmth into Castiel’s chest, before answering, “I had an offer to work as a French teacher, so I thought … why not? I didn’t know that you’re in the area, until I met our Fergus at the cinema few days ago,” Balthazar turned his eyes to Crowley, who pouts and drank up his wine.
“Yes, that is my appetiser.”
, Gabriel.”
Sam saw the exchange's confusion, then he turned to Eileen and communicated with her without saying anything. They only had to exchange looks, and an understanding came between them.
Dean lifted up his face to Cas’ action, and looked both sides of the road although he knew that it was a one-way lane. Apparently he had very little faith in fellow road users. “By the way, yeah, I know this area, Cas. Come on.”
"How could you still
Dean huffed, "I honestly don't know. What do you think, Crowley? How easy would it be to find Cas in a place called The Empty?"
Claire’s voice awoken Castiel from his thought, and as he turned he saw Gabriel smiled triumphantly.
Again, Dean let out another laugh, only this time it was more of pity. "I really disappointed Cas that day. I could see it in his eyes, probably that was when he thought the lowest of me. Fuck, that was awful, to see that look on his face."
His mom crossed her arms. "Well excuse me for wanting you to settle down with the perfect person. Was I wrong about any of them?"
"Maybe he's better at hiding it then you are."
Dean looked up from his BLT to find Jack staring intently at him, as if the answer to the question he asked was the most important one in the world.
Kaia tool out her phone and dialed his number. It started ringing and they waited in anticipation.
"Hurry up," Cas's father demanded from his seat next to Dean. "Not getting any... younger." His tongue poked out as he wrote in the book Cas had gotten him for his birthday.
Cas chuckled and Dean closed his eyes and enjoyed the vibrations he felt. He listened to the steady thumping of the man's heart. Cas started running his hand through Dean's hair.
"Alastair Lobelia," Jody chirped. "You are under arrest."
Dean grabbed his book and drink from the table and stretched his arms up high. His stomach growled loudly at him and he patted it a few times. "Soon," he whispered.
"It's a hat."
"Is he there?"
"37 years. Loved every minute."
He took a big sip of water. "Will you also be ordering a vegetable?"
"I was watchin' Dr. Sexy, and great call on the HD by the way, and he had his shirt off. And because I'm totally fine with the being into guys thing now, I jerked off."
"No, really. It would be awesome. We can write it together!"
Castiel rolled his eyes. "If you throw up, I'll make you a chickpea and kale soup or goat cheese pizza."
"Miracle, I have a feeling we're not in Lebanon anymore."
The Reverend walked up to the podium, and everyone rose.
-Oh. That's a nice name.- He gestured to the female. -Is she your mommy?-
"Guess you don't like them 'cause they're meat heads?" Dean quipped.
Halfway through the second chorus he felt a tap on his shoulder and Dean turned to see his mom standing next him, swaying slightly on her feet, Cas standing awkwardly on the steps to the stage.
"No, I... It's really dumb." Silence for a few seconds. "Okay, so my m- uhm, Jody Mills, you guys know her?" Maggie said she didn't and Jack told her he had met Jody once. "Well she had advised me not to go on this hunt alone, it was this asshole shapeshifter, and I decided to ignore her and I kind of almost died, but her and these girls I live with, Patience and Alex, came in saved my ass at the last second. And, uh..."
"You're heavy," Dean complained.  "Get off."
Charlie leaned forward. "Are you Impala Knight?"
"Hm. It does," Claire agreed. "Put it in the sink," she told Jack and put the syrup and ketchup on the counter. She dashed over to the door that led to the living room and pressed her ear against it.
"Hello, Dean," Castiel whispered.
Cas stared at him in silence.
Telling his little sister he sucked off Cas in the bathroom at the bar the man used to work at fifteen minutes after they met would not be good phone conversation.
"And she dumps me through a text," he exclaimed. "A text! 'Sorry, I'm actually gay, bye'. I mean is that normal?"
"I do. I've been in love plenty of times."
"Interesting how you think there is a universe where I would buy your feminine products for you."
Dean perked up. "Cherry? Blueberry?"
At around 11:30, Dean was downstairs dropping off the rent for the month. He slipped the envelope into a narrow slot at the security desk and headed back to the elevators. He tripled checked the mail in his arms, making sure the check for the month wasn't there. Looking up at the elevator doors, he was surprised at the person standing there.
Dean wanted to answer but Cas's balled up dirty socks shoved into his mouth made that difficult. All he could manage was an unintelligible muffled moan. A hard nip to his ear had his eyes rolling.
"Get it out!" he would shriek, from where he stood on the toilet, either at his own apartment or Cas's. "It's right there! Get it"
"Wh-what? Safeword? This is- Cas we don't need..." He pinched the bridge of his nose. "This is not an actual BDSM relationship, dude. We don't need one."
Miracle smacked into it again, even though his head hurt. It fell completely onto the floor.
"Jack, stop looking for birthday presents," Castiel demanded, annoyed. He spotted his shoes by his nightstand and sat on the bed to put them on.
"I've never listened to them," he said as held the front door open for Dean. "Are they good?"
"Hey, sweetie," he soothed, scratching the girl on her back. "Let's go. Come on, it's okay, I'm here." She let out a loud whine. "Heh. You jumped pretty high up. Maybe I should enter you in a dog show.
"That's him," Gabe said, pointing at the man.
Dean smiled. "Just for me? Aww."
The ground that Dean was looking down on was a strange swirled pattern, something he'd never seen before. Inward to outward, the bricks were painted red, orange, green, yellow, blue, and purple. Sparkling in the light of the bright sun was what looked like multicolored glitter spattered periodically on the bricks. The rest of the ground, surrounding the swirl, was colored a simple brown.
"Yeah, didn't I tell you?" There was piece of cheese hanging off his face.
"Todd, you have to slow down," Sheriff Mills scolded the boy with the soccer ball from earlier. She was helping him stand up. Something was clutched tight in his fist. The sheriff inspected both his knees. "Oh, you're bleeding."
Banshee thought for a second. -I don't think so. I haven't met anyone else.-
"Is that why you're here?" Dean asked from behind Cas.
"And what do you want me to do about it?"
Jack laughed. "They care so much about me they forgot me at the park."
"Hear that Fee?" Jack rubbed the snake lightly with two fingers. "You're coming too!"
"Yeah. And wet."
"You gonna let me go?" Alastair spat. "'Cause last I checked, you gotta have proof I committed a crime to keep chained up like this."
"Huh?"
Jack, in the backseat, leaned forward. "You told me we were getting ice cream."
The school they played soccer in was a Catholic school, so every game had to start with a short prayer. As everyone recited the Hail Mary, Jack covered his mouth to hide his yawn from his coach, Gabriel.  Last night, he had woken up several times; Kevin and Maggie's stories of vampires and ghosts and demons had scared him. Every little noise he heard woke him up and he kept thinking he saw something in the shadows of the apartment. He had even almost fell asleep during breakfast.
Dean went limp again, throwing his head back and letting his left arm dangle in a way that seemed uncomfortable. "Take me home, then."
*****
Dean licked his lips and rubbed his eyes. "Kid, I-I probably shouldn't have said that... I didn't mean... it didn't have anything to do with you. I was just really excited about Claire. You're still my nephew, and I love you. I'm sorry, okay?"
"Hey, you find her?" Sam asked, breathing hard. Dean shook his head. "Well, she wasn't in my room or mom and dad's or the linen closet."
"Big City Greens! It's so funny, do you..." he trailed off, his eyes wide when Cas came back in.
Castiel stomped his foot. "No, I didn't! You always wanted to go because you like sleeping in your own bed and getting up early."
Miracle gave his cousin a kick and shoved his head into the human female's stomach, trying to push her closer to his uncle, but she just thought he wanted a head pat.
"Oh. Sorry," she giggled. "Oh, God. Another one?"
The boy skidded to a stop at the table. "Pizza!"
"Sorry, tiger," Sam whispered.  "Mommy didn't have the baby."
Despite it not being that late, Dean actually felt tired. He stripped down to his boxers, flipped the light switch off, and crawled into the bed. He grabbed his pillow and hugged it tight before he fell asleep.
"No... I should. It's late." Dean wiped his face with his robe and shoved his glasses on, making eveything clear.
"Balthazar, please do not compare my feelings for Dean with your ill advised trysts with three of the worst human beings I have ever met."
"I-I uh," Dean swallowed, clenching his fists to stop their shaking. His heart was bashing against his ribcage. "I know what this, uhm, what this looks like. I didn't ru- what I mean is, I wasn't, like, driving, y'know? I was actu- there was this storm an-and my dog," he glanced briefly at Miracle, who was sniffing the sheriff's feet, "I couldn't find her and then I did. Then the car, uhm, was kind of like, in the tornado? I know it's crazy, but th-that's what happened, ma- uh, officer. I di- I mean the car just," he lifted one clenched fist into the air and brought it down onto the open palm of his other hand, "y'know? Right to the fl- ground. Bricks."
"Mick tried... he tried to tell me the truth, but I didn't listen to him." Dean laughed humorlessly. "Guess I should've. Why'd he forgive me, Cas? He said, 'Water under the bridge, mate'. Did you have something to do with that?"
-Yes he does!-
Balthazar ran into the bathrom and locked it, leaving Cas holding his groin and groaning in pain.
-I'm trying to help!- Miracle insisted.
"Listen. It's church, not an amusment park."
Cas ignored that question. "We need a safeword."
"Cas, c'mon. I need to get these achievements. I'm the one doing the 'work' part of the teamwork. You can't just have your character stand around."
Jack hummed. He was thinking.
Dean started and dropped the towel onto the floor.
Dean's stepmother, Kate, and his brothers came down then.  When Sam was about to take a seat, Cas stopped him.
"That could be part of the rouse! Get the cute kid to get in close and then," he loudly clapped his hands, "they get ya!"
"You are a real comedian," Cas deadpanned, but Dean saw the beginnings of a smile. "The massage place on Fifth Avenue is hiring yoga instructors. I went to apply and needed to look presentable. My interview is on Tuesday." Now down to his briefs, the greens ones Dean liked, he tossed his clothes into the hamper and sat next Dean.
Dean shrugged. "You need a sense of humor I guess."
"Uh, yeah," Jack replied, confused. He looked up and down the sidewalk.  "Where's Kevin? And... Dean?"
"Th- you kno- wh- Al? Solvent?" Dean's brain was whirring. He was more confused then he could ever remember being. "Wait, is that gonna mess up my car?"
"S-sure," Dean stammered. He took the phone and put his number in.
"Why do you look like you lost your prom date?"
"What happened to you?" Dean stepped aside to let the man through. "Watch your step." Shutting the door, Dean locked all three locks.
Cas covered his mouth to stifle a laugh. He had to admit Dean was inconsistent with what their girl could and could not eat for a snack. It seemed to change ever week. Some days he said she could eat string beans some days he said she couldn't.
"Hey! Cassie!" Gabriel shrieked from their room. "I got an idea, I'll come with you!"
"Eggs!" Jack clapped excitedly. "That's better than Cheerios!"
"Understand what? That you're a coward?"
Dean kissed his cheek again and went over to the stove.
Dean waved a hand dismissively. "Nah, forget it. Seriously. Brothers suck sometimes."
"Thank you, I'll try."
"No, no. You don't have to stop. Just. I don't know. Do it on the terrace."
"Of course," Cas repeated. She gave him the exact address and he hung up, running out to the hallway and immediately slipping onto the floor because he wasn't wearing any shoes, just his socks with the winking cartoon frog printed on them.
"Oh my G- I-I am so sor- I didn't mean t-" Dean stammered as he frantically patted himself. "The tor- I wasn't trying t- I can't find my uh, my uh... the th-thingies that make the car go, sir."
"Startled me too," Dean grumbled. "I didn't even know Eileen was here. Not that you're not allowed here, Leen. Just, I was... surprised."
"Leaves aren't food," Dean declared, chugging his Coke.
"Dean, if I have to fuck you to fuck her, I will. Move."
"Yes, but I still don't believe it would be appropriate. Sorry."
The person stepped into the kitchen, brownish liquid dripping from his head.
"I hide it very well."
His boyfriend smiled back and leaned over to kiss him.
"Cas-"
"Did you enjoy tonight?" Cas asked, breaking the silence.
"Hex bag," Jody said, studying it. "This was what was hidin' you from us all these months. Where'd you get it?"
Jack ran up the short slide as fast as he could. Stopping at the edge of the chain bridge, he bent over with his hands on his knees and panted. He looked behind him and could see Kevin climbing the pole a few feet away. Carefully, and holding on to the chain banister, he made his way across and up the steps to the big monkey bars.
"Claire is such a cute baby," Kevin said, grinning.
"Roller derby. You should come watch... we, uhm, have a game tomorrow." That pretty blush blossomed on his cheeks. "Y'know, if you want."
"That's why it was so easy to get him to clean my room when were younger," Gabriel quipped.
"I might have been a bit... overbearing. I'm sorry." Helen wrapped her arms around her daughter. "And this sorry is directed at you too, Char."
Kaia pointed to the only phone not in a case.
"Unfortunately, I do," Dean called out as his dad ran out of the room. He looked at the doctor, who was smiling politely at him, hands folded on his desk. Dean smiled back and looked around the room, trying to find something he could use to make conversation. Besides the usual framed degrees on the wall, there was a messily painted rainbow flag taped up.
"Great," Castiel beamed. "I actually have to go and pick up my sister from the babysitter's. I'll see you tomorrow."
"Oh. Sure." She let go and Jack rubbed his face. She turned to Dean and Cas. "Where an I sleeping?"
Upstairs were the three bedrooms. Each had a bed, dresser, small closet, and nightstand. John and Mary had chosen the one with the biggest bed and Jo had a room all to herself.
Dean twisted the sheet in his hands. "Can you just... stay? For a little bit. We could... uhm." He squeezed his eyes shut. "Snuggle?" He felt himself blushing when he said that. The bed shifted and Dean opened his eyes.
"Jus' sayin' it's worth a shot."
His father laughed.  "We'll see."
Dean's eyebrows shot up to his hairline.
A shrill noise stabbed Cas in the ears when stepped into the Winchester house.
"That is... also nice."
"You're gonna have to give me a few minutes," Dean admitted. "Could you get me a drink?"
She bent over and threw up on Dean's shoes.
Max put his hands up. "Just once. It was his first date with a guy. He got drunk and cried a lot."
"Hello, I was wondering if Inias was available at the moment. I'm his cousin, Castiel."
He spotted Dean's teammate, Caesar, grilling by one of the picnic tables. There were two plastic tables nearby full of food and drinks. Dean sat on the ground and took off his blades, shoving them back in his bag, and took off across the grass. Castiel followed behind at a considerably slow pace.
"Hey there Cas," Rufus greeted. "Bunch of us in IT are goin' out for drinks after work. You coming?"
Jack slid his way through gaps in the crowd until he found his mother.  Maggie was nearby with a few of her friends.
Dean licked his lips. "Oh. A n-next time huh?"
Maggie gave him a weird look but didn't bring up Claire again.
"Right. Look, Dean. I gotta fill out a report about what happened and I need your ID. You got it on y-"
Dean nodded in response. "Probably be awkward for her to hang with him after that. I'll ask her about it later." He gave Cas a grin and his heart gave a flutter when it was returned.
"We baked today. Double chocolate."
"He's great. He misses you and Sam."
The high schooler shook his head. "I'm good." He flicked the plate with his index finger and it spun.
Castiel smiled sadly. "No. I meant about... the stuff I've been doing. Trying to make you healthier. Are you going to break up with me because of that?"
"And," his mom continued, "Kevin and Maggie will be there too."
Downstairs, his parents were watching a movie and Sam was next to them reading a different book than the one from the car.
Dean grit his teeth and pulled his sister towards him by the strap of her backpack. "No, no, no. There will be none of that. Gimme your stuff, you're sleeping in my room. With the door locked. And you," he turned to Sam, "go finish with the groceries."
She put her hands up. "Okay, okay. Jeeze." She studied Jack's face. "What are you, anyway? And are you really Cas's kid? Did he bone your mom?"
Walking into his kitchen, he spotted the apartment's two other occupants at the table. Sam was slurping a soup that smelled rancid and scrolling through his phone, while Castiel sat across from him with a rice noodle salad in front of him and reading a large hardcover book.
In response, Cas held up a hand. "Wait. I need to finish this chapter."
Miracle rolled over onto his legs and brought his ball over to his daddy's legs. He whimpered softly and stared up at him. A smile was returned to him and the ball thrown.
"Short for 'noodles'," Cas finished quickly.  "Don't repeat it."
Cas dropped something on the floor, and Miracle darted over and snatched it up. While the humans talked, the dog chewed and looked for more scraps. He noticed his daddy's and Cas's chairs were right next to eachother, and Cas was rubbing his daddy's leg. He looked over at his uncle and saw that there was a large space between him and Eileen's chair. He'd need to fix that.
"You don't like your food?" Gabriel suddenly asked, startling Dean. "You haven't taken a bite."
Dean shook his head. "I would've remembered..." he trailed off when he saw Castiel walk back in, Jack trailing behind him. They were both carrying duffelbags. The green monstrosity of a hat was on his head.
When the movie ended and everyone wiped away their tears (Dean, of course, pretended he hadn't cried at all), Castiel took Twister out of the closet and set it up behind the couch.
Cas squinted at him. "I've been busy, Dean. I have a baby, you know."
"Why are you calling? Are you hurt?"
"Did you not realize we've been dating for ten months? Is that why you told Jo we weren't serious?"
"He's not..." Dean replied half heartedly. If he was honest, he wasn't sure.
Gabe exchanged worried glances with his brother and Kelly.
"I... love you," he mumbled, and Cas rubbed a thumb along his knuckles.
"I mixed the batter," Jack called out happily. "And made the shapes." The nine year old had gotten cookie cutters shaped like dinosaurs the previous Easter and he took every opportunity he could to use them.
Inias sighed. "Alright, I guess I could walk by a few times and text you some updates. And I'll ask Dumah."
"At the bookstore," Jack piped up, chewing on a waffle, "Cas used to complain to Kevin all the time about Dean playing it. He even missed two dates with Cas, and he said it was 'cause of some big events in the game he just had to do!"
"Thought I smelled something," Claire mumbled.
"A-ha!" he shouted in triumph.
"Though to be honest," John went on, "part of the reason I call him that because 'Cas' is a similar name to Dean's ex, 'Cassie'. She was actually s'posed to go on this trip but she dumped him. Isn't that right, kiddo?"
"I'll take care of it," Castiel stated, walking past Dean without looking at him.
"Mmm." Anael quickly snatched one of the mini hotdogs and popped it in her mouth. She snatched the cooler up and headed out, quickly sliding the door shut behind her.
At first, Dean thought it was sweet of him to do that, since they had stayed up until 3:30, first watching Tombstone on his laptop and then, after it ended, he was informed that Castiel was horny and was flipped onto his stomach. Dean still felt sore. But then he realized, since it was Cas, there was probably some selfish reasoning behind it.
"Double gross!" Jack used his shoulder to wipe away the saliva.
"What... what's that smell? Is that chocolate?"
Him and Dean sat across from Cas and Kelly, Jack of course next to Cas again. The boy was vibrating in the chair, hugging the gift Dean had gotten him; a plushie of Grogu from The Mandalorian, which got Kelly's family all talking about the show. Dean had stayed quiet, even though Gabe knew he loved Star Wars almost as much as Jack did.
The older man started fucking in and out of him, keeping a slow pace. Heat was rising in Dean's belly and his toes curled. Castiel nipped at Dean's neck as he pounded into him.
Charlie kicked her her leg out and sunk it into Castiel's stomach. She stared at the screen and she shook her head. "Dude. You are obsessed."
"I'm not a coward."
"Whatever. By the way, I hugged you more than once today."
Jack blinked and sat up on his elbows. He yawned and rubbed his cheeks, trying to wake himself up. He looked over at Felix, his corn snake, who was curled up in the corner of his terrarium on the desk.
Gabriel snatched it back. "Tell her you changed your mind. This is fucking ridiculous."
"No," Cas interrupted. "I'm only taking Jack and Maggie."
"Depends," John responded, crossing his arms. "What are you having?"
"Dean, please. Stop. I can't... I can't do this anymore."
Benny clapped his shoulder twice. "Charlie and I are gonna be doin' Livin' on a Prayer. You joinin' us?"
"You mean 'would' Dean," Cas said, picking Emma up and kissing her cheek. "She hasn't done anyting."
"What happened?" Cas asked, speaking over the alarm.
"Whatever. Eat."
"Maggie, are you ready to go?" Cas asked.
Dean furrowed his brow. "Dinner party?"
His dad was at the front desk, making a follow up appointment for March of next year. Dr. Garrison had told him his arrhythmia condition hadn't changed and he'd gotten a renewal for his medication.
"Yep, that is definitely a dick," Jo said, suddenly behind him. "It's not attached to a cloud. Isn't it supposed to be? I think I read somewhere or heard somewhere from someone that it is. Aunt Mary, are the horses gonna be okay? What about us? Should we go to the room downstairs? You know, the uhm... the basment! We should hide, right? You think it'll destroy the house? There was a tornado on this episode of Desperate Housewives and a couple houses got all messed up. Someone even died."
Sam rolled his eyes. "If they had their way we'd have 20 kids."
Holding his hand, Cas led Dean up to their bedroom.
His daughter shrugged. "Her foster dad took her Nintendo DS. I was helping her get back at him. How was I supposed to know Small Dad had a cake in the oven?"
"You were snoring."
Kelly glanced at him and grinned, and Gabriel's heart missed a couple beats. "Good. Thanks. You know, I only allowed you to come 'cause I figured my fake boyfriend's brother would help sell this whole thing."
She took a deep breath and bit her lip. "Uhm... I have a thing th-that I... I need to buy tampons."
Dena looked up at him, eyes shiny. "It's... it was supposed to be le- l- lemon chicken. I was trying... I wanted to." He sighed loudly. "I know how to cook. I'm not an idiot. I... really wanted tonight to be special. You're going back to school tomorrow and I... I h- had this whole thing planned. To show you..."
"Why don't you ju- oh, never mind." Dean drummed his fingers against his thigh. "Okay. Chocolate milk."
"Eh, not really," Claire said, "they chose too."
"I'm not blind. It's pretty obvious."
"Either of those things are possible."
They had to wait a bit for their turn; Alicia and her brother Max sang off-key to a One Republic song, a group of tipsy woman celebrating one's birthday got halfway through a Justin Bieber song before dissolving into giggles and leaving the stage, then after that several solo acts came up and a couple actually sounded good.
"He... told me about you. Kind of." She turned to Maggie. "You are a stranger."
Tears threatened to escape Cas's eyes. "I didn't mean for  anything to happen! I just thought you'd yell at him. And I felt so guilty afterwards, I had to break up with you. I told myself it was because your jelaousy was so stifling, an-and that's what made me do what I did that night. But the truth is I couldn't stay with you after what I'd done. What I chose to do. I've been pretending to be mad at you so you'd move on and find someone else."
Cas put his arms out. "Come on, Dean. Get down."
"Y'know, I figured they would be askin' me stuff. Like my parents did with you."
"You did?" Dean's mom asked, grinning at the kid. "Good job, sweetie."
"I'm gonna get shitfaced," Sam decided on the drive over. "So fucked up I'll forget her name."
"I..." Dean cleared his throat. "S-save the kinky stuff for another time, Cas. We've only fucked a few times."
"Uncle Castiel," he started before he could stop himself. "Why do we do the Blue Moon Festival?" The words hung in the air and Jack really wanted to snatch them back and swallow them.
Dean chuckled. "You better get her something good. What is it this year? Gold? Yellow diamond?"
Cas blinked up at him. "Since we met?  Did I misinterpret our relationship?"
"I have money, you know."
"I didn't know that. Like I said I do not have my phone. How did you even know I was here?"
"Mom," Kelly interrupted, "this is Dean. Winchester."
As she turned to the sink, Dean quietly went out the door, slowly shutting it behind him. Licking his lips, he looked over at the chalet and, in the dim glow from a light on its porch, saw a figure lounging in the hot tub.
"What is it?" Dean asked as he took a large sandwich shaped piece of foil.
"I didn't mean to..." he sighed. He had had no intention of telling her how he felt during this trip, or anytime in the near future, but since he did say something he thought he'd might as well keep going. "Okay. That... it's true. I like you. A lot. You're pretty and smart and a great listener and a great mom a-and just great in general. I've been thinking for awhile, but I was too chickenshit to ask, maybe you'd want to, maybe, if you want, go out with me, maybe?" He clenched his hands into fists, trying to stop them from shaking.
"You pick."
A look of confusion flashed momentarily across Dean's face before a wave of realization made his eyes light up.
Castiel moved his mouth up to Dean's face and kissed him while he slowly jerked him off. Groaning with pleasure, Dean grabbed onto Cas's shoulders.
"I woke you up because I wanted to talk to you. I was gonna let you sleep, but I'm getting really worried. This past month y-you've barely slept, haven't built or fixed anything, not done any housework, only been eating one meal a day, and you look and smell awful. Have you been showering?"
Castiel reached across the table again but Kevin anticipated his move and slapped the hand away.
Jo gently pushed the door open, coming into the room and looking nervous.
"I need to save money, Bonfire Boy's parents don't. For God's sake, they own two houses!"
Miracle barked in reply. His daddy smiled and tossed the ball even farther. A fluffy poodle tried to take it by a large tree he didn't like, and Miracle gave a low growl that scared her off. Happily, he picked it up and ran back to his daddy and Cas. Next to them now was his Uncle Sammy. Excited, he ran up to the man and scratched at his legs.
Cas waved back. "Now you really have to get out."
The whole time they had eaten their ice cream, Dean worried Cas would bring up that the Winchester had gone through the lazy river three times, and then he would have to quickly come up with a lie. He couldn't admit he did that just to get a glimpse of Cas at his lifeguard station.
unhappy that death seemed like an easy way out for you?”
Dean lifted up his face to his room’s doorway and saw Cas stood there, drying his hair, wearing his t-shirt – that turned out was a bit too big for him – and that shorts. Dean felt like patting himself on the back for picking the clothing combination for Cas.
The thick Scottish accent welcomed them in a friendly tone, and on the next moment, Rowena approached Castiel to look at him from top to bottom.
Before she returned to Hell, Rowena mentioned to the brothers that she expected a wonderful celebration over the weekend.
This time it was Castiel’s turn to be surprise, “Oh. Right, that means both of them.”
Castiel waited until his last patient had left his examination room before closing the door and took his phone out from his pants’ pockets. He dialled a number, and while waiting for the person on the other line answered, he cleared up his desk.
It took him around five minutes to decide which one to wear first, before finally deciding to sit there a little longer. The bed was really comfortable, and he almost fell asleep
