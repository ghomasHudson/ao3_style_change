“He had something to discuss with Michael,” he replied without turning around. “He’ll be here in a little while.”
“So…” she trailed off and kept her entertained look fixed on John, “…you’re not living with Michael anymore, then.”
“No, I wasn’t asleep. I could only barely hear you on the strings. I was…thinking.”
“She was wrong,” Sherlock said finally, meaning it with all his soul as he continued to stare at the perfectly pressed pinstripe shirt under his fingers, “that day, the day we closed the First Rip, Alice wanted us to leave, remember? She wanted me to take her and the girls to Suffolk. She said we didn’t belong anymore, that we needed to leave London.”
As usual, Sherlock spared him a glance as he stalked to the hat stand to fetch his favorite scarf.
“Neither did you.”
He couldn’t help a tiny huff of amused surrender, aware that denying what she’d already deduced would be both foolish and pointless. So when John reentered the room and settled down on the carpet on other side of Sherlock’s chair rather than in his own, which was still vacant in expectation of his arrival, neither Sherlock nor John himself commented on the change in setting.
“I…I just hoped…I wondered if…”
The man found himself flashing back to those early years together, as he often did nowadays as they were reforming that bond into what it had been, and though there was a lot in John’s words so far that he wished to explore, there was most of all a blazing question that he felt would burn him alive if he didn’t ask now.
He turned on his heel just in time to watch the flicker of emotions chase each other in John’s eyes—the grief chased away by confusion and then the confusion by disbelieving annoyance at the lack of decent reaction to his torturous confession.
He didn’t know if he understood or liked the direction
For the very first time since he’d known him, beyond the sorrow and distant, silent suffering, John’s eyes held a spark of hope. Sherlock couldn’t stop himself from smiling at that, as the fingers of his other hand twitched at his side, anxious to reach up and touch John too.
John sighed again, this time one of relief, as if he were still expecting harmful repercussions at such a request. He crossed to the other side of the bed and climbed under the disorderly blankets, trembling just slightly from the cold in the room, while Sherlock stretched up to turn down the gaslight on the wall.
Very soon everything was more perfect than he could ever recall the world being. His addictions were present (and perhaps they always would be) but manageable at the joy of being alive after spending three years as a dead man, and with all the distractions life possessed for him now. He rejoined John in consulting for the police and took on private clients and rebuilt both his reasoning ability and his reputation every day. On days not taken up by cases he played his violin in the sitting room and conducted chemistry experiments for his own amusement and wandered the streets of the city just because he could. At least once a week he treated the children (they insisted they were not so anymore, but he couldn’t resist calling them that anyway) to supper, and as the weeks had gone by, the four of them, and particularly his daughters (the reality of which still alarmed him sometimes) had begun to stop by at increasingly frequent times. After a while it seemed his sitting room had become a sort of community spot for them where they appeared unannounced to drink his tea and peruse his books and give their opinions on cases. He pretended to be annoyed and sarcastic over it, but he couldn’t say it bothered him too much, honestly. He even moved the furniture around so that the couch and chairs surrounded the fireplace so the could sit and be warm. 221B had been full of grief and silence for too long. How could he do anything but embrace this?
When the clock chimed eleven and the conversation had dwindled into sleepy, contented yawns, the boys waved their goodnights, Jessie smiled at Sherlock and John with equal fondness, but it was Bea who waited for a moment while the others went downstairs.
“You said it yourself,” he reminded him, “that day. Do you remember? You said she was changing me. I’m just not sure if how much of it was my choice and how much was possibly because she touched me and got into my head.”
He held still and allowed it when Bea did something helpful with the uncooperative sleeve so he could get his arm in more smoothly.
“D’you know what I think?” Bea’s voice, always with a peculiar musical quality despite the darkness she’d endured in her life, broke his long silence.
The moment lasted all of another heartbeat, and then Michael entered the house downstairs and called John’s name, pulling the man’s gaze away from Sherlock and to his lover. John met Michael at the sitting room doorway, took the man’s arm, and pulled him over to the desk; he explained the case to him with an air of excitement and pride barely contained by his distinguished self-control.
“The killer established a rather decorative trend when he impales Glen Reese’s head outside Baker Street. It’s a clear cry for attention “look at me." However if the murderer really wanted to be caught, he would have left behind some evidence, minute probably, but not so inconspicuous that not even Scotland Yard wouldn't be able to get somewhere with it. No, he simply wanted to state that he was paying attention, but not ready to play yet.
Sherlock can admit that, on some level, John’s company is pleasant. He doesn’t try to engage Sherlock in idle conversation or to force him into trivial small talk to fill the silence.
“Good morning. A bit chilly for a picnic, isn’t it?” He nods to the basket.
Thanks to everyone who are still leaving me kudos and comments, it's thanks to you that I'm managing to write anything at all. <3
“I’m always frank,” Sherlock says.
“The source being James Moriarty, a man who, according to all databases, doesn’t really exists.” Marlow wets the tip of her fingertip and flicks to a new sheet of paper. “The hard-drive that belonged to doctor Fenway, how is your progress with it?”
The image of two men, hooded and masks, carrying stacks of televisions and computers into a van. A young woman pulling on a lucious fur coat, ripping off the tag and stepping out of the display window to the laughter and giggle of her friends.
“I spent most of my childhood living in fear of my Alpha step-father, and whenever I approached any level authority for help, I was always told that it was natural for Alphas to act in this manner. To dominate, control, that he could not be held accountable for his actions.  There are hundreds, if not thousands of cases like mine, of leniency given by the courts if the case even reaches a magistrate’s desk that is. A few months probation for rape, a restraining order for repeated sexual assaults of a minor, six months for murder. We have in our midst dangerous predators and our way of dealing with them has been to just accept this as an actuality.”
“I am Alexander Lee Finkle, Glen Reese’s defense attorney.” Ms. Finkle pulls her hand back and wipes it on a handkerchief. In the corner of his eye John sees DI Lestrade begging for patience from higher powers.
He’s hyperventilating, John diagnoses, his chest heaving and lungs crashing in their attempt to keep up with the wild thunder of his heart.
He tries to reconjure the image from his last visit to 221 B, the one of Sherlock in that posh chair, with steepled fingers and looking put out with Lestrade’s tardiness in figuring out Sherlock’s oh-so-subtle clues.
“But who is he meeting?” Sherlock is now pacing back and forth in front of the map, rattling of his deductions without pause. “Perhaps a former medical colleague? But John left King’s College early and completed the majority of his training in the military and most of his associates from the army are still overseas. He’s not lecturing or teaching, there’d be no reason to lie about that. He’s not connected to the College in any professional capacity. No he’s meeting somebody there and he doesn’t want me to know who it is.”
“He did something to upset you.” Sherlock curves down towards John until they are suddenly eye to eye, and he locks his gaze with John’s, and John suddenly realizes that they are close enough to kiss and a part of him really hopes they will. He can feel his pulse increasing and the sound of his heart beating echoes through in his head. This amazing, impossible man is so close to him that he’s stealing John’s breath, his words, his entire world.
agrees,
Fifteen minutes later, Sherlock and Sam return. The former is calm; the latter is red-faced with puffy eyes and his collar wet from tears and snot while his face has been cleaned. He extends his arms as soon as he sees John, curling up in his arms and clinging to him for dear life.
“Oh.” John runs his hand across Toby’s head, the dog licks his fingers and then sets about to investigate the rest of his surroundings, nose firmly pressed to the floor. Sam watches the dog, his expression stuck somewhere between joy and caution, his hand clenching and unclenching against Sherlock’s. The sight pulls at something in John’s chest and leaves him feeling breathless.
John suddenly feels foolish for imagining Sherlock asleep in his bed, Sherlock probably went to the Yard as soon as John bid him goodnight and has probably been working on Doctor Fenway’s case all night. What if he the one who identified John’s set of fingerprints? Had he suggested John as a prime suspect?  Would he lie to protect John? The thought makes his stomach coil in unease. Sherlock knows that John is capable of murder, what would he think about-
His fear comes to life as soon as he steps off the taxi.  Several people are crowded around the bus stop, pointing at something above them. John’s breath catches in his throat, his knee suddenly gives in and he limps towards the crowd, craning his neck to see over their shoulders.
“Mr. Holmes, is this some game you are-
But DI Lestrade is alone and John doesn’t want to voice his disappointment.
When the news broke in the media, they had all been subjected to hearings and inquiries. For months, nobody dared to put so much as a toe out of line.
Sherlock is bristling with impatience, and he stuffs his hands  in the pocket of his great-coat, to keep them from grabbing Amanda Carson by her shoulders and shaking the information out of her.
I am terribly sorry to keep you all waiting, but is a lot more effort than I had ever thought.
"You´re an Alpha."
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
“Right. Fine.” John concedes, he can feel his angry scowl slip from his face and he has no idea what to replace it with. For the first time in many years, John doesn’t know what to do next.
“Oh yes,” Glen Reese nods. “I used to go frequently when I first presented as an Omega when I was seventeen and when I bonded with my Mate, less so in later years. I guess I’m just not as interesting.”
“The anniversary is months away- why-”
“The way he casts his glance to the side, looking for confirmation from somebody that he’s on the right track, the calm way he talks about his sister’s suicide, the effective use of pauses to enhance his message. This was a speech that has been practiced and edited many times.”
Marlow uses her index finger to slide the file across her desk to Lestrade.
There was only one person that John had met lately, who he had not mentioned to Sherlock, and who he would have felt compelled to help, even in the middle of the night.
John knows him as the only lecturer in King´s College London who teaches the mandatory course in Alpha-Omega physiology and anatomy and he´s only seen him from the back row of the lecture theater. He´d looked smaller from afar. Up close John sees that he is slender man in his late forties with small, brown eyes and a beaky nose. He dresses like most of the professors and lecturers on campus, in tweed and a plaid shirt. Despite his dull and bland attire there is something regal about his posture and the way he´s studying John. It makes John slightly uneasy without being able to say exactly why.
Sherlock opens his mouth, but seems to change his mind. He turns stares at the fridge. Lestrade follows his gaze, wondering why he hadn't seen it before. A small magnet is holding a piece of paper to the fridge, he recognizes the logo from St. Bart’s hospital.
A pair of men dressed in white, plastic, suits are carrying a covered stretcher away from the public pool house. The camera swings around to capture the crowd of curious onlookers, young and old, men and women, all of them huddled together and watching the stretcher rolling out of the main doors of the pool house. Well, almost all of them. A young man is standing apart from the crowd, his hands stuffed in his pocket with an air of casual nonchalance. To John it seems as if he is more interested in watching the crowd than the crime scene.
John enters the small cell and looks about it a little helplessly, uncertain of what to do with himself and in the end he decides just to stand in the middle of the tiny room.
The Trapeziun bone.
By the time they reach the tube station, it’s late afternoon and the commuter crowd is peaking. Exhausted office workers, tired moms with their children and kids in their school uniforms move in a slow throng down the stairs to the platform. Sam presses himself close to John, both arms wrapped around his neck. His gaze is locked on Sherlock who is walking behind them, a solid, looming presence. John wonders if Sherlock is aware of this protective instinct that has become his second nature. Sherlock is, by his own definition, the most observant man in the world, but he can be dreadfully ignorant of himself.
“Well, I’m just fine. I don’t need anyone taking care of me.”
“The valve isn’t working. You know how it is with these old radiators….” She winks at him, as though they are sharing a great secret.
“The door!” He hears Sherlock lament, “the gap is too narrow, but this has to be the-“ something shuffles across the floor before he hears Lestrade’s heavy sigh whisper through the phone.
Right.
“I’m not….pitying you.”
How old was Sherlock when he concluded that the world was uninteresting? When had he started rebelling against boundaries in chase of his next high?
Lestrade awkwardly shifts his weight from one foot to the other, clearing his throat several times before finding his voice. “So, if we cross-reference the name of Doctor Fenway’s patience files with our victims, we might be able to find a connection?”
“We may seem like a small party,” Edward says, “and even if we are, as you say, a gasoline fire, remember that it doesn’t take much more than a small spark for the fire to spread.”
“Oh, they were after John, I fear.”
John settles Sam down in Lestrade’s massive office with large windows. The child is holding a toy dog in a death grip while cooes and babbles with glee at all the cars and uniformed people moving below.
“The wound is uneven and serrated,” Albert Thompson narrates, as he instructs his assistant to take several close-up photographs. “I’ll know for certain back at the lab, but my preliminary estimation is a saw of some kind. Probably manual.”
He can see Cobb’s lips twist in an annoyed sneer, but just then, Glen Reese launches himself from the floor with the cry of a wounded animal. He barrels into Cobb, who doesn’t shift his balance fast enough and the two of them crash to the floor in a tangled mess of limbs. Cobb’s gun goes off with a deafening pop. Jane Hill curses and grasps her shoulder as blood blossoms between her fingers.  She stumbles backwards, dropping her gun to the ground.
The room is silent again for a moment.
An unwelcomed visitor.
“Look up.”
Suddenly things are interesting and he can´t remember having this much fun in a long time. Which, he suspects, says something about his definition of “fun.”
This chapter is unbeated.
John relaxes his grip on the gun, and then, not knowing what to do with his hands, folds them at the small of his back as he falls easily into the pose of a soldier awaiting his next instructions.
“Do you wish to see him?”
“May I have a new pudding?” Glen mumbles from where his face is pressed into his pillows.
John wakes suddenly and blinks grogginess from his eyes. He is in his own bed, and he doesn't remember how he got there. He twists his head and glances to his left. Somebody has left a glass of water on the nightstand and he uses it to wash away the foul stench of stale vomit from his mouth.
“He said that you’re a great man, Sherlock, and that he felt like he was there just in time to…to look after things for you, in your absence. He said he was proud to have done it, and that he didn’t regret our time together, but now that you’re back he knows this is the right thing.”
“I…suppose it might be habit. Michael always left our bedroom door open. And it is somewhat cold tonight so I thought it would be warmer that way.”
“I think, John,” he suggested gently, “that maybe you should go and talk to Michael now, and come back when you’re done? We’ll save you some dinner and I’ll have tea waiting when you return.”
It happens in a flash.
The games begin and Sherlock’s mind is awhirl, flickering through each possibility. Is Moriarty trying to appear relaxed, knowing that Sherlock will see through it?  If that is the case, why the ruse? Why the gun? In their previous encounters Moriarty has never been one to dirty his own hands. Does this mean that truly feels uncertain?
“Is that so? Yes. You claimed you don’t have a heart. You may even be able to delude yourself into thinking that you won’t care if I paint the walls with John Watson’s brain, or put your land lady’s head on a pike or spread the remains of your Gregory Lestrade all over the Thames.”
“Thanks,” Lestrade lifts his cup as if he’s initiating a toast.
John checks in on Sam and Toby, both sleeping peacefully, curled up together like lifelong friends. He leaves a kiss on his son’s forehead, before slipping away to his own bedroom.
They navigate the late-lunch crowd and waiters. John leads them to a table tucked in the far end corner of the terrace. The child is there, sitting in a wooden high chair and dipping a breadstick into a bowl of yogurt. The tall man in the suit is watching the child intently, but when John arrives, he gets up from his chair and moves a few paces away, standing with his back to the table and his gaze on the crowd. The toddler gives Sherlock a sullen look and then points his breadstick at John, demanding an explanation.
“What else did you discover?»
“No, Ann Lewis’s fiancé, Toby Henricks was with her.  He confirms Ms. Annabell Lewis’ story so far.  They called and knocked on the door, but in the end they had to force it open. They called an ambulance as soon as they saw what had happened, but all the ambulance personnel could do was confirm that she was dead and then they called it in to the Yard.”
Every month he meets with Doctor Fenway for his Omega session. Doctor Fenway tests his senses and reflexes, and makes John feel like a bloodhound. He asks hundreds of questions about his life in the army and living amongst Alphas. About the Suppressants and how well they worked. Were there any side effects? Did he ever feel any sort of compulsion to the Alphas in his regiments?
“Who are we waiting for?”
“Sure,” John says faintly, his head swimming.
Adrian Reese is sitting in the chair, his hands still chained to the table. He looks somehow younger than the footage on the surveillance camera, his hair in disarray and his hands folded on the table. His head is thrown back and the wall behind him is covered in small, mist like stains of blood.
“—and here I am,” John was saying, “and all it takes is a
He realized a second later why she’d sounded so urgent. Michael was evidently a common fixture in their lives now, a sort of kindly uncle figure to the unsure fatherly one John had donned. John had met him a year and a half ago, he’d learned later, when a case had led him to interview at the courthouse, and Michael had spent the entire interview struggling to stay on the proper topic whilst simultaneously praising Watson’s abilities as a writer, a detective, a gentleman, and an interviewer. And evidently he’d uttered all these praises with complete sincerity, because six months later John had packed up all his things and left 221B for the last time. Sherlock wasn’t sure precisely why that idea sent an uncomfortable jab into his chest.
Sherlock shook himself from his unusual reverie, wondering where in the hell any of that had come from, and clapped his friend on the shoulder.
Title is from the
“It wasn’t so much a choice,” came the predictably matter-of-fact response. “I told you—you had me within the first week.”
Sherlock did gasp at that, because he could see that John was being completely honest possibly for the first time since they’d met, and he could hardly believe he deserved such a statement after some of the things he’d done.
“More?” he offered.
“What’s wrong?”
“She was wrong,” the detective said conclusively. “And I was wrong to listen. Sometimes I wonder if—”
His mind began to wander in the silence, and he thought back to that crooked steeple case John had mentioned, to the night after when he’d only had the presence of mind to whimper that he’d had a nightmare before he’d dug his face into this same strong shoulder and drifted away into slumber. He’d forgotten it entirely, but the identicalness of the position now brought a fleeting, delirious memory to his mind. Had John kissed his head that night after he’d gone still beside him? He thought he remembered feeling the press of his mouth, just a tiny brush of John’s lips against his hair like an affectionate, protective gesture before he’d lost consciousness again, but he supposed he couldn’t be sure now.
for the past as well. As another little step in accomplishing this, he pulled the heavy blanket off the back of his own chair and tossed it over Bea’s shoulders, as she was the only one of the four wearing no jacket over her long sleeves and the room was growing chillier.
“Why ever not?” Sherlock pressed, fueled by his suddenly overwhelming desire to see his friend in his old place again. “Your bed is still there, and your chair, and I believe you left a couple of your books on the side table in the hall,
Sherlock squinted a bit as her shadow moved down the staircase wall before the front door shut with a slam, but John offered no explanation for the bizarre exchange and so he asked for none. Let it be their little secret, he supposed.
“I suppose,” he said, pushing himself up just slightly, “this is our home, yours and mine. Even in the worst times it’s where we belonged. I never even thought about leaving you after the First Rip, John. And I wouldn’t have left you in the second one either if I’d had the choice. You must always remember that.”
For all his ability to keep count of everything, he had no clue how long it was before they broke apart; it could have been only a couple of minutes, or it could have been over a half-hour. All he knew was that when they did pull back, pressing their foreheads together again for a long moment while they caught their breaths, he was dazed at the reality of it. He had kissed John,
+++++++++++++++++++++++++
“What is it?” he questioned, his tone soft and, he hoped, soothing.
Sherlock realized abruptly that the edges of his vision were getting a little unclear, and forced himself to take in a breath where he’d been taking none for several moments.
“Well, of course,” Sherlock smiled back, shrugging one shoulder. “What do you take me for?”
He watched a shadow of confusion dim Michael’s charmingly angular face when John stopped his imminent display with a hand on his chest, but his eyes flickered to where John pointed and he flushed with embarrassment, which turned almost instantly to astonishment at John’s low, ever-calm voice.
“Besides,” he added, because his mission wasn’t just to be more thankful these days, but to uplift those around him too, “your eyes are positively sparkling. They’re always captivating, really, but when you get good rest they’re even more so than normal. And that cravat brings them out. You should wear that dark bronze color more often. It really suits you.”
He could see the answer in John’s whole posture, how his shoulders dropped and his brow softened. They were both recalling the same circumstances, Sherlock knew—those five years of arrogance and ignorance on his part, the next ten full of grief-fueled fights and blame and bitterness, and the those last three in which he’d seemingly abandoned John without gratitude or care. They both knew how dark their relationship had gotten at some points, and how so much of it was Sherlock’s fault, and yet all he could see in John’s face was love,
When he failed to continue, seemingly fumbling to put his wants into words, Sherlock sat up straighter to arrest his attention. John was holding himself back again; Sherlock could see it clearly now where he never had before. And if it was the death of him, he’d make sure John Watson never had to hold anything back from him again. He was determined to know and love this man in the same measures he’d been known and loved all this time.
. I always have. And you were wrong when you said you don’t belong anywhere, because you belong here too. Don’t you see that, John?”
“They’re immaculate,” Sherlock explained, then continued at the inevitable rise of a questioning brow. “I know you’ve been taking on patients again here and there during the week, and you told me yourself you make house calls on Wednesdays. Those boots are your most comfortable pair that are still nice enough to be professional, so you always wear them when you think you’re going to be doing a lot of walking but are still going to be seen in a professional light, like yesterday, Wednesday, when you were making house calls. You’re wearing them today because you aren’t sure what to expect during the investigation, but they’re perfectly clean even though it rained nearly all of yesterday. You wouldn’t have cleaned them last night because it’s
“I suppose I’ll never know,” he murmured, stroking his fingers thoughtlessly against the fabric of John’s button-down. “It doesn’t matter now. What matters now is that she was wrong, and I was wrong, and you are wrong too, John.”
“How long?” Sherlock repeated unconcernedly, his own thoughts barely making sense to him except for that one word,
While John fetched his hat and coat from off the sofa, Sherlock turned away as well to start cleaning up the mess of papers before they’d be inevitably trampled by four pairs of careless, grimy street boots.
He’d thought himself to be awake when he’d felt John’s fingers brush against his shoulder. He’d opened his eyes into the early morning sunlight in his bedroom only to find the fingers that were touching him were dripping blood onto his mattress, and John was staring at him through empty, bloodied sockets, his throat parted straight across the center so that a waterfall of red soaked his new friend’s shirt and vest. He’d awoken in reality a second later, his bedroom still dark with night, the drugs having convinced his sleeping mind that John had been murdered sometime in the last week due to his own failure to apprehend the murderess in time. And yes, he had been so terrified that he hadn’t even considered how rude and ridiculous it was to get into someone else’s bed without their permission. He’d just curled up against John so that he could feel his living warmth and slept until noon the following day. It had never occurred to him to wonder why John had still been there when he’d awoken, hadn’t even moved to push Sherlock’s head off his shoulder all night and half the day.
“I do,” the doctor stated simply.
It didn’t matter now. None of that did. Because compared to the man standing in front of him, even the brightest memories he possessed of Alice seemed to dim even further. John Watson’s light was blinding in his head—his genius, his devotion, his endearing moodiness, his unexpected and unpredictable humor, his courage, his care. In Sherlock's mind Alice’s pretty face and soft curves were replaced by John's square jaw, his strong shoulders, his full lips, those gorgeous, gorgeous expressive eyes….Sherlock had always known he was attractive, objectively-speaking, but his unending, ridiculous, apparently limitless love made him suddenly the most beautiful creature Sherlock had ever laid eyes on. It seemed, then, that he knew now whether or not he was capable of finding a man attractive after all. But he would have to be careful; almost twenty years is a very long time to live with one’s heart broken, and he would have to be gentle putting John’s back together.
John’s breath seemed to stop for a fraction of a second, but when his eyes met Sherlock’s again a great part of that infamous stone wall had crumbled. Sherlock counted this as his sign of victory for the last few months’ effort.
Three pairs of eyes sought out Bea’s opinion as Sherlock offered the man his own teacup whilst settling his hand on the doctor’s shoulder with an uncommon warmth. Sherlock looked intently into John’s face, which John allowed, still holding the teacup in one hand without sipping from it yet; seeing that the other man was steady after his difficult conversation with Michael, Sherlock sat up again but did not remove his hand from John’s shoulder.
you,” Watson now spoke up, a hard edge like accusation in his tone, his stoney features impossible to read in the slanted four o’clock sunlight but delightfully familiar all the same. “You ran. You had never planned on leaving that cavern without her. The moment you knew she couldn’t leave, you knew you would stay, and you
were dead.”
“He was better to me than I deserved,” was his simple answer, and then he followed Sherlock’s lead. “I’m going to unpack and ready for bed.”
As much as Sherlock had loved Alice (or thought he had, or whatever), all at once her lithe, feminine form and pretty delicate features were gone from his mind once and for all. He’d been slowly releasing her, ever since that day of the Second Rip, when she’d abruptly seemed much different from the way he’d remembered her as she'd smiled beatifically about bringing literal purgatory into the living world. Perhaps she wasn’t the woman he’d thought she’d been, even before that. Perhaps he’d been holding onto some idealized memory after all, like a porcelain statue carved to smooth out the flaws of the real subject and easily shattered at a wrong touch. Perhaps his grief was never quite justified and he really had simply been mad for a decade.
; if anyone had the right….
Bea’s grin widened, but she let it go for now and went to fetch more of the extra tea Sherlock now purchased just for them.
“It’s just,” he explained hastily, “I’ve been thinking about it, for so long, you know. Do you remember just after the case of the crooked church steeple, when you’d been using those damned drugs to keep yourself awake for so long they gave you nightmares when you’d finally solved the thing and allowed yourself to sleep? It was the middle of the night when you came crawling into my bed, half-out of your mind from the cocaine, and you just mumbled something about a nightmare before you went straight back to sleep.”
And Sherlock was only just now remembering that he’d never told him so, had he? Seeing him glow with Michael’s praises had felt strange because John had never
and to no one else. You were wrong about another thing though; I did see you. I always did. Just not well enough, not the way I should have. But I want to change that now if you’ll let me try.”
John’s mouth twitched in amusement, for when they’d moved in together all those years ago it had been because both men were abjectly poor; now, Sherlock Holmes had been paid more money by grateful monarchs and politicians and celebrities than he could ever spend on himself in a lifetime, and yet the only time any of his fortune had been spent was when he’d been thought dead and John (being the beneficiary) had offered large portions of it to the girls for their wellbeing. John himself had spent not a penny, despite that he’d owned everything of Sherlock’s, and so when the detective had returned from the grave most of his wealth had still been waiting for him.
would be,” John countered.
He hated it, making accusations like this that he couldn’t confirm, as much as he feared they were true. But John’s instincts had always been powerful, perhaps better than his own, and the other man’s piteous look told him he was probably right to accuse. He’d been changed, turned into a man who would pack up and leave during an apocalypse, who would abandon his dearest friend to fight it alone and potentially die while he hid someplace safe, and no matter how blind or selfish he’d been then, that wasn’t
“Well,” he said, stepping toward him with a contained eagerness to show off his restored deducing ability, “your boots told me.”
Sherlock pushed himself out from under his blankets a bit and scooted over so he could place his beloved violin carefully on the nightstand.
“Absolutely,” he answered sardonically, winding the scarf around his neck and only halfway doing up his jacket buttons, then added, “I’ll be back by suppertime if you want to eat with me.”
The words echoed from a distant past, from the day the First Rip had closed and taken Alice with it; he’d relived every moment of that day in his mind countless times and remembered every detail, including that conversation. Sherlock had been managing his mistakes well, he thought, but now a fresh flood of guilt took him by surprise. He’d always considered that exchange to be the precursor to his downfall and nothing more; now he understood what he’d been missing in it, what he’d been missing for over a decade now. Michael gave John something he’d never had but desperately needed. And if Sherlock Holmes was really anything like the genius he was supposed to be, why had it taken him so damn long to understand? John deserved to be built up too, craved it, even. And the one who had the most reason to praise him never had. Like everyone else, he’d been too preoccupied with himself.
“I might be more interested in her,” he stated, “if she had a bit of scruff on her jaw, and a…”
, perhaps more than the average British gentleman; he still tended to be a little too abrupt at times and needlessly authoritative, but not as much as he used to be, before. He smiled more easily now, and laughed rather often even if it was just a small chuckle, and ate regularly, and even stroked Bea’s and Jessie’s hair sometimes with carefully affectionate fingers. Once or twice Sherlock saw him place quick kisses to their foreheads, hug them tightly (if still the smallest bit stiffly), and pat Billy’s or Spike’s shoulders with uncharacteristic warmth. Equally as surprising was that none of the four seemed to find his wary, mindful closeness uncomfortable or unwanted. With Sherlock absent for three years, John had evidently had the time and energy to take responsibility for other things; the doctor had always been a caregiver, despite his sometimes-ominous and often-harsh aura, but in the last few years this aspect of his nature had flourished on behalf of the daughters they’d both cruelly neglected, as well as their two friends who were equally in need of a parental figure.
“I'm glad he made it easier on you,” he said honestly, and after another moment of comfortable quiet, he glanced to the mess that had been made of the coffee table. “I should clean up.”
Sherlock frowned at that, for he rarely saw his friend in such a disputatious mood these days (as he himself rarely was too, in fact). As he knew John had no quarrel with the children, that left only one person who could illicit such a reaction in him. It was likely a problem, then, with Michael.
“Why did you not tell me?”
“Where’s John?” Billy asked as they set up the food in the usual spot on the coffee table before the fireplace.
But then again, he thought about how the man’s eyes had flickered to his exposed collarbone earlier in a concealed wanting, and he obtained a little more nerve to pose his question.
“Thank you, for choosing me.”
thought either,” came the low, unhappy reply. “According to him, he still cares about me and wants to be friends, and yet he wishes me to move out within the next week.”
He didn’t notice it, then, when John paused in the doorway and looked back into the sitting room just as Sherlock turned up a couple of the gaslights. His dark, tired, slightly disoriented but now-peaceful eyes followed the detective’s movements for a few seconds as he moved about the room collecting the mess of papers, his form still elegant despite the permanent damage the drugs had done to his nerves—forever slim, oddly fragile despite his wiry strength, and possessed of a peculiar masculine grace not unlike the Stradivarius violin he loved so dearly. This man was John’s to touch now, after years of silent, painful yearning. The thought almost took his breath away.
“What?” he pressed, genuinely wondering. “What do you want, John? Tell me. The truth, remember.”
The rest of John’s words were lost on Sherlock, with only that one statement repeating in his mind, and his instincts were screaming at him that there was a deeper meaning behind it—
A moment of indecision twitched in John’s jaw, but then the man answered with just slightly more openness, and some sadness,
. He was going to do everything he could to be good to him, and figuring out exactly how to do that would be the most important, and most enjoyable, mystery he’d ever unravel, he was sure.
I'm so sorry to anyone who might've been waiting for this chapter. I always try to post on time, but let's just say some shit happened yesterday and leave it at that. x) BUT this chapter is the longest and I THINK you'll like where it goes. :) So I hope that makes up for being a day late!
But then that shyness dissipated into a deep uncertainty, which was equally as rare in John Watson’s demeanor and gave Sherlock pause in his playfulness.
John looked sidelong at him and he could understand why; they had never actually discussed those dark days their friendship had endured, and so he supposed this was as good a time as any to broach the subject.
“I could’ve pointed them your way easily,” Sherlock told him. “So why? Why didn’t you give any of them a chance?”
And yes, perhaps he was still a little unsure of his own general attractiveness these days, his haggard body feeling forever foreign to him compared to his healthy youth. John had changed so little, as handsome and fit as ever. It was almost unfair, if Sherlock hadn’t done it to himself.
,” he repeated, uncompromisingly. “You belong with me,
“I’ll just take this upstairs,” the man said to Sherlock, ignoring her.
As he’d worked to improve his character, to be a better man for his children and his clients and his friends (well, just the one friend he had, anyway), Sherlock’s world had become better than he could’ve imagined. After nearly a year since his miraculous return from the grave, his fame had soared to fantastic heights so that kings and commoners alike sailed the oceans to consult him; his daughters had lost most of their hesitancy regarding him and were entirely relaxed in his home, even opening their arms for his embrace when he reached for them these days (although he would be the first to admit he had a long way to go still in proving himself to them); and John? Equal with his newfound fatherhood, John was perhaps Sherlock’s most dramatic success.
“Surely you didn’t think I would disapprove of you for it,” he said, insistently. “We had male friends who felt the same. You could have chosen any one of them and they probably would have fallen all over themselves trying to win your hand.”
. Because in the same way that 221B had become a meeting point for the children, it had become that for John as well—just a meeting point.
His friend huffed a small exhale, as if he’d made a decision but was unsure still if it was the correct one, and then he dropped his shoulders from where they’d been held in defensive tension.
But as he should have expected, his attempt to distract them from asking anything more was unsuccessful on Bea. Her eyes narrowed on Sherlock as she pulled out a serving of chips wrapped in brown parchment paper and she questioned,
“John?” he called out from where he’d been arranging some old newspaper clippings in the sitting room floor.
I know I said I'd update Wednesday, but then I remembered that I'm going out of town and I don't know if I'll get the chance. Thanks so much to everyone who read the first chapter! This one's longer and has a little more flow and story to it. I hope you enjoy!!
“Cock!” Jessie shouted from nearby, inducing a chorus of uncivilized chortling from the four friends.
. It had never been. It must have been her. But was it on purpose, or was she as much a victim to her abilities as he was, using them unwittingly and without malice meant? Or was it all intentional, but for the purest reasons—because she thought she was doing the right thing, enticing him to make the right decisions for all of them?
After that, it had been a very short time indeed before the final lightning strike shocked Sherlock Holmes’s mind. He would’ve liked to think it was without warning, but the facts were that he’d been dodging this particular revelation for weeks.
++++++++++++++++++++++
“No,” John agreed, obviously also recalling that young, brash, self-important consulting detective that no longer lived in these rooms. “You’re better now.”
“So what am I supposed to do now?” John’s voice was rough and jagged, and he didn’t even seem to be addressing Sherlock anymore, but possibly rather the uncaring universe outside the window. “What the
“No,” Sherlock assured him, putting some seriousness back into his tone for John’s sake. “That’s not what I’m offering. I’m sorry for what I’ve done to you. I’m sorry I didn’t start to fix it until now. But I’m telling you that you don’t need to fear me, John Watson. I’m going to do my very best to be good to you and good
“Well?” came John’s world-weary, immensely bitter voice from behind him. “Are you satisfied then, Sherlock? Do you have all the truth you want?”
. It didn’t matter to him that John was a man, or that he was a liar, or a jealous fool, not even the slightest bit. Because he’d said
Sherlock’s startled gaze lifted to meet his again, for though he was trying his damned best to fix his mistakes, he in no way saw himself as
Three years had passed; that shouldn’t feel like very long to him, as he’d lived
“I don’t think that would be the best course of action,” he stated.
In the end, it was John himself who presented the solution to the issue, thereby creating the very lightning strike revelation Sherlock had been tiptoeing around for weeks.
, so now every time I wake I look at him, but all I can think about is you, wondering what you’re doing in that moment, if you’ll need my help today, if you’ll
He would never forget the first time he put his mission into action.
“Sherlock,” he called, annoyed by his own hesitancy but not wishing to alarm the other man by revealing too much of his pent-up passion too quickly.
“Thank you, John,” he answered.
A flood of thoughts wrote themselves into Michael’s unassumingly handsome features, but his eyes were clear and intelligent, his step easy and self-confident, and so he ended up doing the wisest thing possible in the moment. He introduced himself and offered Sherlock his hand.
John had left the room nearly seven minutes ago now, and Sherlock had been staring after him all the while, dumb and wide-eyed like the fool he was.
be impressed by his charm which was sadly lacking these days anyway. But despite knowing him through and through, John
John switched his hat to his left hand and passed around the furniture to where Sherlock stood; with his right hand, he cupped the pale, scruff-dusted cheek and pressed a quick but deliberate kiss to his willing mouth.
“Ever since then,” John was saying, “I’ve thought about those hours and just wanted to feel you, asleep against me like that again.”
“Is part of the house okay?” Spike piped up from the sitting area. “Like, just the kitchen maybe? Or the bath?”
“Because,” Sherlock added, bolstered, “this is.”
“Back to You” by Tony K, which is used in the show and the lyrics are
“Yes, please!” called out Jessie (whose love for the stuff was just as immense as her father’s, evidently).
“Behold, John,” he declared, “the most beautiful woman in existence, according to stage critics the world over.”
(See the end of the chapter for
But before he moved to put his things back in his old room, John met Bea’s eyes deliberately. She must have been pleased with whatever she saw there, because when he was gone from the doorway, she looked back at Sherlock once again and hid a grin in the teacup she held with both hands. Her eyes fluttered from the fire to him and back to the fire again, dancing with delight which she finally focused on Sherlock’s face knowingly.
“Are you all right, John?” he asked instead. “I mean, about Michael.”
(See the end of the chapter for
For the times when John
felt refreshed enough to bother with such a menial task when it wasn’t necessary. Hence, you went to bed early and slept well.”
“The children will be here soon,” he said.
He should probably stop talking now, he knew; already today they’d said enough. Everything else should be preserved for another time when they weren’t both so worn out from too many emotions in one day. But among Sherlock Holmes’s many vices was that he never did just shut up, especially when he probably should.
John’s imposing figure entered the room and took in the sight of Sherlock propped up on several pillows with his violin in his lap over his tangled blankets, and the lamplight on despite the late hour.
“Haven’t I been humiliated enough, Sherlock? Do you have to do this to me?”
“Will you finally be getting a tattoo now, then? I mean, I think it’s only right since the rest of this family’s got one.”
“You’re working so very hard,” John said quietly, “to do good to everyone around you. You’ve become a father to the girls, and a hero to so many people in need. You’re kind, Sherlock; you always have been, but once it was shrouded in your quest for fame and glory. Now it’s all that motivates you, and it’s made you so much better than you ever were before. You’ve come out of all that pain and suffering and only let it make you wiser and gentler here on the other side. I have never once stopped being proud of you—”
“A week?” Sherlock repeated, stunned indeed. “But whatever for, John? What reason did he give you?”
The other man stopped mid-step where he’d just been removing his hat, brows knitted together in confusion.
“You,” he spoke, his tone matching the grave set of his brows, “and me.”
“Good morning, John. Thank you for joining me today. I think an extra pair of sympathetic ears is exactly what our poor client needs. Well, look at you—you must have gotten plenty of sleep last night.”
John’s breath stuttered, and Sherlock was horrified to see a single tear slip from one eye and dash itself against the carpet at his feet.
“You mean, that she was using her powers on you?”
“What could be better?” Sherlock urged, smiling as well.
in any sense. His failures were too stark, too permanent, for that.
John gave a bittersweet sigh at the mention of his (former) lover; even though it had been Michael’s insightful suggestion in the first place, and he’d been nothing but understanding about it all, they really had been happy together while it had lasted. Admitting to Michael that he had been right, that John unfortunately could not stay anymore, would not be easy to do without hurting him in a way he wouldn’t deserve.
+++++++++++++++++++++++++
John nodded once.
Sherlock let her go, gave both girls the time and distance they needed to process it—that their mother had not only knowingly instigated the slaughter of hundreds by reopening the Rip from the other side, that she’d planned to turn the world into a never-ending purgatory for both the living and the dead, but that after all that, she’d ended it by stepping back through…but on her own condition that Sherlock Holmes go with her, even if it was against his will and through the force of her overwhelming mind powers. She had touched him, kissed him goodbye, and in the process had used his grief as a door to implant her own desire that he run to join her at the last second, when no one would expect it, when John Watson wouldn’t be prepared to grab him in time. Even the words he’d spoken to John in those last seconds had been prompted, motivated by her. And the only reason Sherlock hadn’t been lost forever was because his brain was thankfully not as slow as he’d feared it’d become, and had been just quick enough with its newfound connections to darkness to hold the Rip in place—open not wide enough to let anything out, but just enough so that he could have a chance to find a way back, like a sewn-up hole that could be pulled apart again with the right strain and then closed back.
“Nothing,” John’s voice snapped, with an air of misery.
Thank you so much for reading! I hope you all have a fantastic week!
That made the doctor look up in concealed surprise, just as he’d suspected it would, for there was no haughty self-satisfaction in his voice, no arrogance like there used to be, but only pure soft gratitude.
She let out a small but definite laugh at his expense, but then they seemed to share another silent, serious conversation which Sherlock understood even less than the first. Abruptly, Bea closed the distance between herself and John and wrapped her arms around the man; if John was startled, he did not show it, but pressed his hand against the thick, silken locks of her hair and held her in return. The embrace lasted only a heartbeat, and then she was bidding them a hasty goodnight before rushing out to catch up with her friends.
at me. And that’s not fair to him; he deserves so much better than what I can give because I’ve already given everything to

“You will tell me the truth from now on,” Sherlock told him unrelentingly.
“The truth, John,” he reminded him instead of meeting his temper. “When?”
She had just glanced away from his openly affectionate gaze with a happy gleam in her eyes when the stairs creaked again and John’s familiar figure crossed the threshold once more.
“About what?”
Sherlock couldn’t bear to look at him any longer; turning his back and taking a couple of steps into the unlit side of the room, he tried to organize the sudden onslaught of dizzying emotions while being overwhelmed at seeing John in such gut-wrenching distress. And how many years had he been? How had Sherlock never known it until now, when it had been so clear all along?
“Does it matter?”
for this Sherlock and John.
than in him, because Michael Morstan knew he was homosexual while Sherlock Holmes had not, and Michael knew it intimately, apparently.
Something like a sob choked his voice for only a second, as his hands tightened on the wooden frame of the sofa so hard Sherlock feared he’d have bruises on his palms or do damage to his joints, and his face took on a look of agonized fury though he still never raised his eyes to look at Sherlock.
He readjusted so that the blankets were less tangled and emphasized with a gesture the empty left side of the bed.
Sherlock spent the next few days letting the girls process it without pushing, because he understood how difficult it was to align all of Alice Flagg’s beautiful and angelic qualities with the monstrous ones mixed between them that seemed to contradict the good in her incomprehensibly. Why? He often wondered in those early days. Why would she scold and shout at him for abandoning their girls (with good reason, of course), but then trick his mind to do exactly that only a moment later to be with her? Why would she have insisted so many times that closing that first rip was everything, but then beg him the next day to move them all to the countryside and never look back, only to change her mind again in an hour? Why did so many of his memories now seem tainted with the realization that his behavior toward her had often bordered on unnatural obsession rather than devotion?
Sherlock watched as he made his way to the end of the dim hall and up the winding carpeted stairs to the third-story bedrooms. It was some thirty minutes afterward that he was finished straightening up the sitting room, and by then the house was silent; when he passed John’s room at the top of the stairs, the door was open (which was a change from his routine before) but no light or sound came from within. And so Sherlock simply went to his own room, comfortable and confident that the next day would be the start of the best part of his life, if he were clever and kind enough to make it so.
“Not too long ago I might have said yes, but now I have life anew and I’ve concluded that one could never have enough adventure, John.”
“I hadn’t noticed,” he said, and then immediately recognized how foolish he sounded, as he fumbled with the jacket trying to get his arm in.
I know how you take your tea—just a splash of cream and a biscuit on the side even if you won’t admit it.”
In the three years that Sherlock had been gone, John had moved out of Baker Street. He’d moved out of their home and into one that was only a couple of blocks away, yes, but despite how spoiled and selfish it sounded, Sherlock Holmes had come to realize that a couple of blocks away was a couple of blocks too far. This was particularly a problem because the house in which John now lived had another occupant who took up much of his time these days—a primly handsome, well-tailored, well-educated barrister with smooth olive skin and round brown eyes that gleamed at John whenever he was in view like John Watson was the only man he could see at all. And though he did not understand why, these days when John's gaze left Sherlock to shine right back at Michael, Sherlock was
“Tell me, John,” he found himself commanding, his voice much harder than he’d intended. “No more lies. We’re finished with all that.”
“There is nothing else special about Michael Morstan than that,” the doctor went on, his voice trembling like Sherlock had never known, his brows clenched as though he were in some great agony. “I was never interested in those other men because how could I be? While you were alive, how could I look at anyone else? How could I even see any other man while you were in the same room?”
“After everything,” Sherlock continued, scarcely able to believe it, “everything I’ve done, all the ways I’ve failed, you
“Back? So he came here and left already?”
Though John clearly tried to hide it, the flinch in his features was clear.
Bea whispered with covert urgency the first time he met the new housemate, one Michael Morstan, a week and a half after his return.
Bea, along with the others, saw the exchange clearly but didn’t bother with a reaction, and so the other three followed her guidance and gave none themselves.
He glances at his hands, fears for a second to see them sticky and red with Sherlock’s blood.
The two of them disappear into the kitchen. A few minutes later the sound of kibbles hitting a metal dish draws Toby’s attention and the dog skips happily towards the sound, leaving Mycroft and John alone in the living room.
"So, you´re sure it´s a man?"
“Hello, John Watson. I wish I could say I’m surprised to see you, but where Sherlock Holmes goes, you are likely to follow.”
Charles Waxfield sighs, his considerable weigh sagging.
He constructs the message and sends it.
“I might get paid good money to keep you alive, but they weren’t specific on the conditions. Shut up, or I’ll shot you in the leg.”
John is really regretting meeting with Glen Reese. He does not need to have all his suspicions about his own life spelled out like this, he gets enough of that from Sherlock who’s even deduced why he’s now taking his coffee with extra milk and sugar.
“I need to-“
Sherlock rolls his eyes, but he pulls on the gloves before he proceeds to carefully push the bathroom door open.
Sherlock isn’t convinced, he lacks too much data to be able to make a confident analysis of what John may or may not do. John isn’t the only thing that has changed. Lestrade’s got himself married again, to Molly Hooper, (nothing like a massive lie to bring people together). Mrs. Hudson has actually left Baker Street to spend the winter with her sister in France. London has changed. He knows her statistics by heart, crime rates are up by a record 20% the past two years. Minor incidents, in the grand scheme of things, muggings, drug-trafficking, shoplifting, scuffles and fistfights outside bars. Alcohol-induced violence.
It wasn’t written anywhere on his records, but he could read between the lines. Burrell wasn’t the first Alpha to be discharged from the army for minor misdemeanour and injuries.
“Well.” He pulls his glasses off his nose, cleans them with the edge of his shirt. “I only wish it wasn’t necessary.”
“Don’t leave me!”
John looks around the room for anything he can use to staunch the bleeding, and in the end he rips off the sleeve of Jane’s shirt. He folds it into a solid square and presses it against the wound. Jane Hill winces, but remains still.
“It’s interesting because it would make the motive a monetary one,” Sherlock muses aloud.
After a few seconds in silence, he increases the volume of the radio and John is grateful for the music on Radio 4.
, John says.
“It just makes me very confused,” Lestrade says and interrupts Sherlock’s retort with a raised hand. “If it was an execution which, according to John’s contention, was done to give it the appearance of legitimacy, and you add that it was done out of a personal motive, what do these transactions mean?”
“Hmm.” Lestrade pulls away and moves over to his desk where Sherlock can hear the rustling of paper as Lestrade consults the mess that he calls a filing system on the top of his desk.
“Alphas do not work well with other Alphas. We are far too mistrusting for that. We’d fight for dominance. It’s highly unlikely that two Alphas should cooperate in such an elaborate venture that includes going through the effort of moving Simon Whitewell from his prison… No, the connection between our victims might very well be doctor Fenway, but they might be Omegas,” Sherlock says.
In vivid detail, stark, harsh colours and dissonant soundtrack. It’s easy to do. It’s the same thoughts and fears that plagued him when he sat down in doctor Fenway’s office for the first time, after barely escaping being sexually assaulted. There had been no lucky escape for Glen Reese or anybody else on Edward’s list. And those responsible had walked free, to take more lives.
"Check-ups" John says bitterly "you mean, examinations."
The downwind spiral of his thoughts is thankfully derailed by Sam when he accidentally knocks over his glass of milk. Tears need to be wiped away and reassurances given, milk and crumbs cleaned up. When they are finished, Sam is sitting in John’s lap, sniffling and feeling rather sorry for himself.
“Try not to die again, little brother, your loss would break my heart.”
“You’re giving me a house.”
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
“Obviously,”Sherlock replies in that exasperated tone of voice he uses whenever he’s confronted with the stupidity of the human race.
"Only male Omegas, dear. And those are very rare."
Lunate.Triguetrum.Pisiform.Capitate.Hamate.
John sighs and pulls away from washroom, finally deeming it safe to return to Sherlock.  He sees DI Dregs pocketing his notebook and moving to stand next to Sherlock, taking care to maintain his distance from the Alpha.
John blinks at him for several seconds before he catches up with Sherlock’s thoughts.
John feels Sherlock’s firm grip on his arm, firm and dominating and the effect is jarring, he can’t do anything but comply with the Alpha.
Lestrade has gone utterly rigid, and for a moment Sergeant Donovan worries that he’s going to faint or throw.
John bites the inside of his lip almost hard enough to draw blood. "Sure." John agrees.
Sherlock is bright-eyed and watching John expectantly.
Fake his suicide, he corrects himself, and go into hiding.
“Well, the main character, David, sounded a lot like Doctor Watson, so I thought it’d be interesting to see if it were true. Both soldiers, no strangers to dangers, a bit of a thrill seeker. So I though I the best way to figure it out was just to ask him. But, you know, Doctor Watson said it wasn’t.  But I’m not sure I believe him; he was all flustered, and I could hear his heart rate increase. Us Omegas, we've got great  hearing you know. And besides, there were so many obvious similarities.”
Lestrade nods again. He cannot help but be impressed by her concise summary of such a complicated case.
Bugger this, John thinks. He feels foolish for being herded into the corner like a damsel in distress. He grabs at Sherlock’s sleeve to push the taller man away, but Sherlock remains a rigid barrier between John and DI Dregs.
John twists the bottle around until he finds the familiar tear in the right hand corner of the label.
“You know, I didn’t think we’d meet again like this. It’s such a funny old world.”
John thinks about Glen Reese coming to 221B with the wretched book that sent John running down to Doctor Fenway, who, rather than trying to placate him riled him up with his taunts.
“Yes,” John presses his lips to a thin smile, “I know.” He feels guilty, not for the first time, for leaving without a word. Even if the circumstances was out of his control he should have called or sent a postcard or even asked Mycroft. He’d thought about her, once in a while, wondered how she was doing, if she was still sharing sand cakes with the next-door neighbor. But, irrevocably, any thoughts about Mrs. Hudson had led him to think about Sherlock and for such a long time the only thing he found down that trail of thoughts was pain and regret. It’s an excuse, and he knows that’s Sherlock’s, not the only one who owns Mrs. Hudson an apology.
edition.  Free Press: 2009)
It’s been a long day at the clinic and an exhausting evening with Glen Reese and though he’s used to running after Sherlock all over London, this is a different kind of weariness. John is so used to avoiding thinking about the fact he’s an Omega and everything that implies that he feels jet-lagged, like he’s been traveling from a place where he isn’t an Omega to the one where he is and his mind hasn’t really been able to catch up.
“Well… ” Lestrade says slowly, bidding for time. There are so many things wrong with that statement he just doesn’t know where to start.
“Where is it?”
“You're going to have your Heat very soon,” Glen Reese says with a nod at John's disheveled figure, “that's why you're so warm and uncomfortable. Don't worry, it gets worse.”
For his plan to work, it is necessary that Moriarty feels completely in control.
In a thinly veiled attempt to not allow Mycroft to tell him what to do, Sherlock doesn’t go to the park until it’s almost noon. It’s one of those bright days at the end of autumn,before the days will become bleak and cold. The nice weather has drawn a large crowd of people to the wooden pavilion at the Inn The Park and waiters are hurrying to and fro. Gathered around the pond are several children, some wearing vests and caps from primary schools, some clinging onto their parents. The arrival of some many people heralds food and the ducks have lined up, gurgling and quaking along the embankment, squabbling for bits of bread.
My warmest and most sincere and heartfelt thanks to all of you who read, kudos and comments on my story. You brighten my day when it's gloomy and inspire me to keep writing when I just want to give up. Thank you.
He shuts his eyes at the sound of high heels against the aluminium floor, and when he turns to greet his handler, it’s with the most insincere smile. He hates these meetings, because they can only mean one thing.
“Yes, but not until the evening. I agreed to meet him at his office at 10.pm.”
There’s a hiss in Lestrade’s ear as John and Sherlock loudly discusses something. Lestrade keeps his smile, even as he listens to Sherlock’s absurd suggestion. Then, the mic changes hands and John’s voice resonates through the headphones. Lestrade instantly begins to repeat what John tells him.“You are correct, of course, ms. Alton. There are strong legal safeguards in place to protect patient’s confidentiality. However, there are exception circumstances to this rule, such as for the police to investigate a serious crime.”
Sam signs and shows Sherlock the white outline of a skeleton, a few yellow bones slotted in place.
Burrell leans over the desk, sneering at him. “Do you think I want to spend my life sweeping fallen leaves in the middle of the village? Let everyone look at me waddling around and think I’m an utter failure?”
He should have known that Mycroft would even best him in emotional blackmail. Sherlock scoffs and ducks his head to hide his expression. Before he has a snide reply ready on his lips, the door opens and a nurse enters, carrying a tray of grey bowls and plates.
John remembers sitting at his kitchen table, seeing his father’s disgust at the vicious murders.
“Mr. Holmes, I was told you were awake. Perhaps you would care for some dinner?”
“Paper?»
He’s still sitting there an hour later, when Sam clambers onto a kitchen chair, a bundle of crayons clutched tightly in one hand.
Sherlock grabs John’s jumper and yanks him forward until he can press his lips against John’s. John’s free hand slides along his arm and closes down on his shoulder, his thumb pressing gently into the muscles of his neck. He deepens the kiss for a moment until Sherlock tips his head back to look at him, feeling the warmth of the ridiculous feeling that’s made a home in his chest. A notch mars the skin between John’s eyebrows, curious, a little concerned, and his gaze studies Sherlock’s face intently. He places a hand on his cheek, spreads his fingers against the skin.
Sherlock lets himself fall back against the couch and mirror’s Moriarty’s pose: legs and arms crossed.
“Sherlock….” John tries again, but Sherlock’s eyes holds at Moriarty.
John turns to stare up at a broad shouldered man, with narrow eyes and the unshaved jaw of all-nighters. His thin smirk looks far from apologetic, but John returns the forced smile and ducks his head in acknowledgement.
A few weeks ago they had been looking through a picture book together and practicing the signs for animals. Of all the animals, Sam had been most interested in the otters, and he spent the following days asking questions about what they ate, how long were their tails, where did they come from and if one might come to visit him? John had been saved from having to secretly Google the answers on his phone by Mycroft’s calm explanations, that the otters lived in rivers and swamps, that their tail could be up to 35cms long, and that their primary diet consisted of fish. On Sam’s last question, he’d been suspiciously tight-lipped and John wondered, not for the first time, if Sam might not have wrapped the most powerful man in Britain around his little finger.
Thankfully, the door to his office is pushed open and John ambles in, smiling thinly and carrying three cups of coffee and a brown paper bag. Lestrade is immensely grateful for the timely interruption. He lifts his cup in a mock toast to John, who simply smiles back at him. Lestrade glances at Sherlock and he cannot help but notice that Sherlock gives John a studying, slightly suspicious look, as if he’s never seen John before. Sherlock then returns to staring at the map, his back an angry T.
A woman bursts out from the darkness and comes running down the street. She must be an athlete of some sort because she is running very fast. Sally rises and moves towards the bus doors to get a better view of the woman, half expecting an ax-wielding maniac to come chasing after her.
Nobody pays him any attention as he moves through the throng and heads for the front door. There are more people inside, hanging about in the corridors, talking to each other and passing around cans of beer. A couple of children run past unattended, screaming and laughing. A broad-shouldered fellow arrives with a massive takeout bag from McDonald’s which earns him a cheer of a large group of guys and girls who are lingering outside apartment 301.
“She…she contacted me on the internet. There's a website for people looking to earn a couple of quids under the table. Five thousand was just too good to pass up. She had everything ready, the uniforms, the security cards. We didn't exchange any words, she just told me what to do and I…did it. I’ve never saw her before and she never talked to me beyond describing the job.”
The Alpha cradles John’s face, and John feels rooted to the spot, to this moment, and then he watches Sherlock smile, slow and deliberate, watches as breath ghosts across his skin.
“Yeah?” The woman in the high heels says, “how are you gonna prove that from your little show?”
graphic depiction of a crime scene.
“Now this, this I never really mastered.” Sherlock confesses low and tight. “If I do it correctly, you will just be momentarily indisposed. If I do it wrong, the indisposition will be permanent. It might take you a few minutes before you fall unconscious, but I am confident I can stretch this out to be as long and painful as possible.”
"Boys can get pregnant?" Harriet boggles, as this goes against everything she´s ever learned when they had The Talk at school.
His smiles grow teeth and there is something in his eyes that suddenly makes Alice feel like she’s sitting next to a matryoshka doll and that only the first layer has been exposed.
“Nothing,” DI Lestrade confirms. “She’s been identified as Ann Lewis, twin sister of Annabell Lewis.  That’d be the crying woman in the living room.”
“Do you remember passing out  in a public restroom in Brentwood?”
But Sherlock needs him, needs John to be a barrier of reason and common sense and to insist that  he needs the occasional sandwich or bottle of water to keep himself alive. He needs John when Sherlock´s bouts of boredom and melancholy drive Sherlock to engage members of the gangs in London into a deadly game of hide and seek. To remind Sherlock to form a plan and not just wait and spring the trap, just to prove to everyone how smart he is.
When the door closes safely behind him, John allows himself to experience the pain that came with….what, Sherlock’s rejection? Is that what he recognized in the silence? He’s not sure how to name it, because Sherlock hadn’t said or done anything.
John tells Sam
"Putting it simply- the Alpha´s urges is a part of the human brain that in Alpha-Omega nomenclature is called the "lizard brain". It is their most base, most primeval urges. It is almost impossible for them to suppress the most basic instinct of their nature. Controlling hormones is something we have mastered."
“And how did you become acquainted with Mr. Reese?” DI Dregs asks. He drags his chair even closer to the table so that his long legs stretches out under the table, almost touching John’s who immediately pulls back and his instinct to flee rattles against their cage. Suddenly, there’s a loud crash on the other side of the mirror and all eyes turn to it to see it vibrating angrily. It lasts for only a second before it falls still, and the noise on the other end of it grows to an angry murmur that John can barley distinguish as DI Lestrade’s baritone voice.
The waiter reappears with their food, looking rather nervous as he places a steak and ale pie in front of Sherlock. He gives John his fish and chips and then places both the salad and Sam’s food in front of Molly.
Suddenly his tongue feels like it’s made of cotton and his stomach heaves unpleasantly. He should be a titter with excitement at the prospect of seeing Sherlock again, but he can’t escape that old memory of Sherlock, can’t escape that nagging voice in the back of his mind. What if Sherlock blames it all on hormones and a biological drive outside his control?  That John's affection was nothing more than a chemical defect, the foolish Omega mind striving for the companionship of an Alpha? An instinct almost completely eradicated from the human gene pool, if not for aberrant like him?
Sherlock lifts the card up towards the light and studies how the optical variable ink changes with every angle.
John lets go of a breath he didn’t know he was holding.
“ We have a slew of charges against you.” Lestrade flickers through a stack of papers on his clipboard. “Impersonating an officer, stealing a police vehicle, accessory to kidnapping. You're looking at a long time in prison, but if you are willing to cooperate I may be willing to speak with the district attorney.”
He gives John´s shoulder a casual clap that almost sends him crashing to the floor and he finds his footing just in time to stop the drinks from spilling all down the front of his shirt.
“I’m sorry,” Sherlock says, quietly and the words feels odd, “I was just surprised.” (And happy that you aren’t married and living in the countryside and that you still have your wretched jumpers.)
John takes a deep breath and meets Sherlock´s gaze. His face is impassive, but there´s a spark in his eyes. Interested. Attentive. Hopeful. John´s suddenly busy with sitting up straight, trying to negotiate between his stupid urges to please Sherlock and ignoring his presence. He's spent his life with Alphas in his regiment and they had never made him feel like his conscience and emotions have suddenly become a minefield he had to navigate.
“Alright,” John says quietly, turning his gaze back to the wall. His hands skim along Sherlock’s arm, returning the gesture of comfort.
John shrugs a little. “For a career spanning over 30 years, and as a specialist in Europe? There might have been individuals he only saw once, but they would still have gotten a patient file. Three and a half thousand isn’t really that unreasonable. If he wasn’t an Alpha-Omega specialist, you might have had a list of ten or twenty thousand patients.”
If Burrell notices his discomfort, he hides it well. His breath escapes in ragged pitches. “You don’t know what it’s like having…..it’s like you’ve got this gift, yeah? You’re quick and clever, can run faster and farther, you’re assertive, you’re fearless, right? It’s what the military wants, and then suddenly you’re ruthless, aggressive, a walking time bomb ready to go off and just attack the- and then the military just washes its hands off you.”
ohn swings his feet over the edge of the bed, shaking Sherlock’s knee. Sam is already waiting by the door with an expression better suited for a sullen, impatient teenager than a toddler.
John suggests, forcing his trail of thoughts onto a more pleasant path.
“It’ll be fine, these reports are utterly useless,” Sherlock ensures him and then returns his attention to the computer.
John is not the only one who is moving tensely around in the flat. They collide when they try to pass each other in the corridor and are forced to resort to the little dance where they both move left and then right, before they both stop and wait for the other to pass. They bump elbows and shoulders more often when they try to move around each other in the kitchen, and each touch makes John’s skin prickle and his breath hitch in his throat. Sherlock and he have fallen out of their little habits and norms they had perfected over the last few months of living and working together.
And he doesn’t worry that caring isn’t an advantage.
“He’s the only one who had a cellphone, you’ll want to secure that.”
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
He shuffles away and returns a few minutes later asking her to play again.
As if he had been alive when it happened.
“You must know him, then,” DI Dregs comments and Sherlock nods absently. “Only by reputation, he gave up trying to contact me after Mycroft paid him a visit.”
“Oh, John, this is wonderful!”
"Our lab will confirm it," Constance continues, "but that is most likely suppressants. There's only two physicians in London who describes this type, the late Doctor Fenway and Doctor Mizuno."
She proceeds to measure the length and width of the head and photograph it from every possible angle. Now and again she´ll pause and say “hmmm” in a way that Lestrade has learned to recognize actually means: this is strange, unusual and really
Which is why he’s standing in the foyer of the impressive facade at Westminister at seven in the morning, waiting for doctor Phil Coleman.
Is the connection not between Nash and Crawford, but between Crawford and Braithswort? Does Nash have access to funds they haven’t uncovered? How did Crawford come to know about them?
He grabs the towel, dabs it his split lip and winces. He’s never going to underestimate John’s strength again.
For a second John doesn’t have the brainpower required to make his legs move and figure out the implications of what Sherlock just said.
“Two weeks,” Mycroft says smoothly. He surveys the living room like a crocodile breaking the water’s surface to inspect its surroundings. John wonders what he deduces from all the Christmas decorations. Can he tell that they are all Sherlock’s construct? Are some of these items familiar to him? Are they old Holmes heirlooms?
eyes suddenly calculating.
“I’m still not sure what you are hoping to prove, Sherlock,” Lestrade says, “The crime scene was a locked room, the key was inside the room -under- a magazine.”
"You…." the guy sneers, his voice low and hard, his hands fisting in John´s jacket.
Mycroft clasps his arms at the small of his back and moves smoothly across the floor to stare out the window. John can’t tell if he’s keeping an eye on somebody on the street below, or if he just wants to put some physical distance between them. John isn’t so easily deterred.
"Oooh, I totally will!"
“Of course not.”
“Let’s try to keep him from inheriting your appalling eating habits,” John mutters, “or lack of them.”
John expects another dreary, British, manor house, but Mycroft directs them to the top floor of an apartment overlooking  Savile Road. It looks ridiculous expensive and posh, but with its white walls and scant furniture it’s airy and light in a way that the heavy wooden panelling of old British interior just isn’t.
you, for a change, instead of just you to me. You’ve given me everything, all this time, so I’m returning that gift with an equal one. Just take it, whatever it is you want. It’s yours. Take it.”
“Stay here,” he begged. “Move back into this house. This is where you should be.”
“No, no,” Sherlock interrupted gently, smiling, “not about that. What I mean is, I belong
“So I am,” he answered simply, with a timbre of frustration underlying his baritone voice.
the brilliant one, John, and I should have been listening to
“Not your pity,” John snapped, still not willing to trust his smile, trying to protect himself from further hurt.
, his and John’s—ragtag group of children stomped up the staircase, voices carrying in a cacophony of playful banter. The smell of fried fish and potatoes struck his senses a moment later, as they entered the sitting room just as Sherlock was putting away the last of his newspapers in a desk drawer.
Sherlock was
to follow her, Sherlock—”
“Really?” she said, and he wasn’t sure if he was imagining the knowing lilt underlying her neutral tone. “I thought you noticed everything now that your brain’s working again.”
John’s breath was increasingly unsteady, his heartbeat faster where Sherlock still hadn’t moved his hand from his chest, and he was still waging that internal war he’d been fighting for over a decade now; he shook his head, but even as he did he bent forward just slightly, just enough so that Sherlock could lean up and press their foreheads together, and then hope won at last, it seemed. John tilted his head and, with his eyes squeezed shut still, he pressed his mouth to Sherlock’s fiercely, like he was trying to get his fill before he would be shoved away.
“I think,” Bea continued behind him, “he makes him happy. I mean, he definitely loves him, doesn’t he? Every time I see Michael he looks like he thinks of himself as the luckiest man alive. Actually I remember hearing him say just that once. Even when they have their little arguments, they always make up pretty quickly and you can still see they’re in love afterward.”
Where he’d spent the first six months frustrated without knowing why, Sherlock spent the next few agonizingly aware of every new moment between John and Michael as he added to his count of kisses and compliments, and adding new categories as well—for instance, the number of times John waived spending time on a case to spend it with Michael instead (too many), and the number of times Sherlock walked into the sitting room late in the evenings and found himself wishing intently for John’s steady voice to fill the silence (
(See the end of the chapter for
“John,” he said, carefully, “if I ask you something, swear to me you’ll tell the truth.”
John, who looked no less overcome, eyes wide and disbelieving as they searched Sherlock’s face for his reaction.
“No, it wasn’t like that,” he answered, his own voice now soft with sorrow and awe at how very tangled it all was. “I ran to her because…because she told me to. She forced me to.”
from you and I’m at your side again without question, and of course Michael knows. He knew from that first time he saw us together that no matter how hard I try to love him more, he will always be the second man in my life.”
“What do
Sherlock tilted his head curiously, his eyes—those devastatingly sharp and brilliant deep brown eyes—narrowed on him in scrutiny.
John looked up with a start again, but there was more startlement than offense in his expression this time.
A slice of his own guilty pain cut through him when he tried to brush the fingertips of the other hand along John’s jaw, and the man shut his eyes again as though it burned and leaned slightly away.
…or how horrified he’d been, how helpless, when John had been screaming his name, clawing at his arm, trying so desperately to pull him back from the Second Rip while Sherlock’s very mind had been hijacked by Alice’s desires and he had no freedom to stay.
“Michael, something happened while you were out of town. I want to introduce you to Sherlock Holmes.”
“I’m sorry; I didn’t wake you, did I? I didn’t think I was being very loud.”
me—we belong to each other, yes? That’s it, isn’t it? That’s what I haven’t been able to see all these years, like the damned fool that I am. It turns out I’m not the brilliant one in this partnership at all, am I? It was you all along—you saw it when I couldn’t.
“It might just be that Michael needs some time to resolve whatever it is in his own mind,” he suggested. “Rather than renting a whole other room, you could just move back into your old one here, until you resolve the problem between you. I won’t even ask you to pay half the rent this time.”
“I know,” he said softly, holding the other man’s gaze, “that I have not ever been the friend you deserve, but I want nothing more than to spend the rest of my life righting all my wrongs, and that includes towards you, if you’ll give me the opportunity. Tell me what’s wrong, John. I don’t like seeing you troubled.”
me; even after she was gone you didn’t ever look again. And then you were gone too, through that second Rip after all those years, and I thought that was the end. I thought you’d chosen her for good, and that you were gone forever, and God help me, Sherlock, I thought I was free of you.”
Sherlock knew he probably shouldn’t persist, but in that instant he learned something about himself—if Michael Morstan had hurt John in some way, Sherlock would be all too happy to forget his usual tendency toward nonviolence. He just needed to know exactly what he’d be decking the man
Next chapter will be posted next Sunday night. In the meantime I hope you all have a great first week of May. :)
They were at Baker Street again, working on an case Gregson had handed over to them—something to do with a stolen necklace and the whiny-voiced prima donna it had been stolen from—with the children hovering at their elbows and offering advice that more often than not was shrouded in jokes. The case was going to be an easy one; that much had been clear to all of them since they’d gotten it that morning.
Sherlock could feel that his own face had gone slack and colorless with the shock, but he could not find his voice to interrupt and could only listen as the words poured from John’s mouth like he couldn’t stop them any longer, and perhaps he couldn’t.
He would have liked to say he knew exactly what John’s answer would be, but he’d been so intent on ignoring it in case he was wrong, and so distracted with the idea John could possibly be coming home, he didn’t understand the context until John actually said the words aloud, turning his head to look directly into Sherlock’s eyes for the first time.
. He was free to live wherever he wished, with whomever he wished, just as Sherlock had been free to choose Alice.
“John!” he hissed scandalously, snatching the photograph and adding it back to the pile. “Do be still; there are children present.”
He turned on his heel and offered her a disgruntled look as reward for her attempt to be annoying, then he recalled that he’d lived with John for fifteen years but it had taken a trip to Purgatory and a handsome new suitor for him to realize his best friend was interested in men, and even longer to realize why this particular man had him so enraptured.
He trailed off, his expression faraway for a moment as he smiled fondly.
a man, and certainly not
“Aren’t you meant to be…rather far from here?” he finished his introduction with a question that was both polite and direct, which was oddly reminiscent of Sherlock's own methods, and
Bea considered this for a moment, or at least pretended, and then she spoke again with a grave nod.
“You belong
“Get out,” he commanded with no real heat.
He raised questioning brows, but John seemed to be looking at something worthwhile, despite the scars and ugliness in him now.
“That is not an answer, John,” Sherlock informed him coldly, and he would have kept going, but John’s next words cut him short.
“So what is it, then?” Sherlock pressed, stepping just one step closer to him in his urgency, and perhaps his jealousy was a little too obvious but he couldn’t stop himself now. “What is it about Michael that makes him so special?”
He punctuated this with a quick, impulsive kiss to John’s jaw in the dark. When he lay down again, the man’s arms wrapped around him all the tighter, and he had the strangest sensation strike him. He knew that somewhere out there, horror and tragedy and pain were occurring—all of which would be their responsibility tomorrow as they went out into the world as helpers of the victims and rescuers of the lost. But somehow that thought didn’t torment him quite as much as it usually did, because he knew none of it would touch him again as long as John and the children were there, safe and sound close by. Together they would be brilliant enough to overcome it all, he was sure.
"Well, of course you´re not." Sherlock says in a tone of voice that suggests that he actually doesn't quite believe John at all. John´s insulted by the suggestion because he did after all just save Sherlock´s life.
“Right,” John tries not to feel guilty about his own impromptu expedition to a crime scene without Sherlock. Sherlock would see and deduce everything, not only about the crime scene but also about John and his ties to this place. He can’t really explain why he doesn’t want Sherlock to have this glimpse into his unpleasant memories associated with Paradise Gardens. Perhaps, a small, nasty, voice tells him, it’s because Sherlock is hiding his own bleak past.
“Lestrade wants to talk, something about a newspaper add.”
There is the seasonal outbreak of flu, and John spends most of his time at the clinic tending to crying children and worried parents.  When he’s not working, he is spending an unusual amount of time at the pub, sometimes with mates from work, but more often than not he is alone. He’s not drinking because he is too aware of the addictive tendencies in his family, but it’s nice to get out and meet people and talk idly about the last football match or the latest shenanigans of MPs.  John also tells himself he’s not actively avoiding Sherlock.  Occasionally he even manages to convince himself it’s true.
“Right, governor.”
“No. Absolutely not. I will not issue a warrant before you bring me some concrete evidence of Edward Blithley’s involvement in the triple homicide. We cannot afford to skirt the edges of the law in this case.”
But his black coat, delicate stitching, coarse, smooth and heavy fabric. Perfectly tailored and fitted across John’s broad shoulders, runs smoothly down the arch of his back. Upmarket label. Harrods, no- never, Savile Road.
“Was he complaining of a headache before the seizure occurred? Did he fall and hit his head? Did he have trouble speaking or complain about fuzzy vision?”
“Love is a chemical defect found on the losing side, it’s simply a string of pointless transmission between neurons . It’s an evolutionary cul-de-sac, just like the male Omega.  Have you ever heard of anything as useless?  There is really no need for fertile males when there are an abundance of fertile females to carry on the species for those who are so inclined to produce progeny.”
He feels Sherlock’s hand curl around his and John stares at the long fingers over his as if sheltering him. Sherlock tugs on his hand and pulls him along, hands still joined. John’s eyes are drawn to Sherlock’s back and even through the thick layer of his coat he can see the anxious twitch of his shoulders, taste the scent of his worry. Sensing Sherlock’s unease makes his own heart quick its pace. In the back of his mind he knows it’s just a chemical reaction to the Alpha’s state of mind. The knowledge does little to calm him.
“That logic works both ways,” John points out, “he could have called her just to have an alibi.”
Sherlock stands under the lip of a red tree, hands in his pockets and wonders why Mycroft has sent him here. He tries to wrestle with the image of John, sitting alone on a bench, tossing crumbs to ducks and pigeons. It’s a depressing and very dull image. When he sees John, he recognizes him from the ludicrous knitted jumper he’s wearing, a horrid, green monstrosity in looping Shetland pattern. His coat (the expensive one (the nice one) that Mycroft got him) is draped over his arm. He’s standing at the edge of a group of small children who are trying to toss breadcrumbs at the ducks, though their efforts don’t quite reach the water. Uncaring ducks wobble up from the water, nipping at their feet, making the children scream with a mixture of glee and alarm. John is watching the children (his catering tendencies shining through) while talking to a tall, handsome man in a pinstriped suit.
"Thanks. For. You know. Saving me."
DI Lestrade does not look entirely convinced, but he strides off to the interrogation room.
Molly offers him almost apologetic smile “My father still insist on using a fax machine. I guess some people prefer old technology?”
he asked me to!”  Glen Reese’s voice grows suddenly quiet and distant, “Even all those… strange customs and things he wanted in the bedroom.”
Sherlock makes a considering noise.
"I know. I wonder- I wonder where they….." Harriet lowers her voice again and brings her lips closer to Fatima´s ears. A few seconds later the two girls howl with laughter. Shoulders still shaking, they look back at John and this only spurs another fit of sniggers.
“Charming,” Mary says in a voice that doesn’t sound entirely sincere. “May I come in for a moment?”
Jane Hill shrugs, and then groans in pain.
“What-”
“Mhm,” Mycroft says.
They soon fall into their chairs, legs stretched out, tips of their toes touching. Sam runs to and fro the room, placing pieces of a puzzle, building blocks and crayons on the table, obviously with some scheme in mind. There’s the gentle clinking of a cup in its saucer as Sherlock rises and collects a book before settling down again, one long leg crossed over the other. Toby shuffles over and curls up in his basket. John feels the heat of the tea seep into his fingers, and he closes his eyes, relishing the comfortable silence of
As always, my most sincere gratitude to all of you who give me kudos or who shares your thoughts with me.
“Shouldn’t we just leave?” she whispers.
For a moment, the only sound in the cab is the uneven, ragged breath from Sherlock. Then he seems to collect himself. He straightens his posture, steeples his fingers.
“You said, that the image was so grainy you could only see the driver.”
John wonders how obvious he is in displaying his affections.  Are the adjectives he chooses in his blog too telling? Is he too considerate when he offers to make Sherlock tea just as he knows Sherlock prefers it? Is he touching Sherlock more often than would be considered acceptable between friends, colleagues or flatmates?
“Certainly, doctor Wilson.” She hands Burrell a pink, silk handkerchief that looks ridiculous in his large hands. Burrell accepts it, dabs his puffy eyes and then blows his nose.
“Obviously, there will be Christmas gifts and Father Christmas.”
Lestrade tries to sort out the hundreds of little voices, whispering implications, listing up people who would fit Doctor Coleman’s criteria.
“So, where were they from Friday to Sunday?”
Anderson is vibrating with rage, and he stares at DI Dregs, speechless, his mouth open with wrath.  For several seconds, the two stare at each other and John can feel the room grow tight and hot with suspense and for a brief second it looks as if the two policemen will settle their difference with a physical display of might. John can see DI Dreg’s knuckles turn white, and Anderson straightens his posture before he yanks himself free of the detective inspector’s grasp. He stalks towards the door, kicks it open and slams it shut so hard that the windowpane in it rattles.
“It’s fine, Sherlock. Really.” John says calmly, anything to stop the two Alphas from jumping at each other again. “I’ll go with DI Lestrade.”
Dregs is still watching him, dark eyes measuring as if he’s calculating his odds against Sherlock and naming himself the victor. He grins a smile that is all teeth and chill politeness. He turns and walks out of the room, his back to Sherlock, unafraid and uncaring. Whistling, low and off key and every note grates on the last restraints of Sherlock’s calm.
“Did you drug him?”
Moriarty turns and saunters away from the window. He tucks the gun into the waistband of his pants, he stops at the mirror in the corridor and smooths back a few errant locks of hair. He pauses at the doorway, as if he’s just realized he'd forgotten something, then, with a shrug he proceeds down the stairs.
“Edward Blithely is just a pawn. If it wasn’t for that webpage we might have thought he was sincere in his desire to increase awareness of child abuse.”
There are rigorous protocols to follow: the building is evacuated, the unlucky delivery guy is detained to be questioned for hours, the bomb squad is summoned and are discussing the best way to approach the package, when Sherlock calmly points out that bombs seldom bleed.
He can hear Glen Reese’s short, shallow breaths followed by, “I can’t live without him,” and then the phone is quiet, the call has ended. John stares at the dark screen in his hand for a second, and then he hits redial.  The phone chimes and chimes, but nobody answers, and, after the twentieth ring, John gives up.
“After the Omega has experienced its first Heat, they find themselves with the choice of hiding their true gender or battling the stigma of being an Omega in modern society. Modern pharmaceuticals have made the former easier, as the media has made the latter increasingly more difficult. Very few seem willing to draw parallels between the current attitudes about Omegas and those regarding homosexuals in the early 1900s, which in some countries carried, and still carries to this day, severe legal ramification, ostracization. It may be prudent to remember the World Health Organization did not declassify homosexuality as a mental disorder until 1990, and in China not until 2001 and that many countries still practices the death penalty for homosexuality. One may wonder how long it will take before it becomes acceptable to live openly as an Omega.” (Lee, Finkle A.
John is already moving towards the kitchen. Sam is clutching a broken crayon in one hand, thin streams of tears running down his cheeks. A quick assessment of the situation tells him that Sam’s not injured, but John’s teacup is beyond saving.
They make their way through the quiet house with its closed doors. Sam has one arm hooked tightly around John’s neck, while his other hand goes through the motion of the finger alphabet, spelling
He closes his eyes. Lets his head fall against the cool glass. It’s quiet. The only sound is the monotone hum from the refrigerator and the faintest ticking of the clock on the mantelpiece. If he concentrates hard enough, he can imagine the dulcet tones of John’s even breathing. He pictures the way his expression relaxes, seems almost still and docile- even if he knows John can spring from asleep to awake and alert in a heartbeat. He thinks of Sam sleeping on his back, one fist curled loosely by his mouth, the other wrapped in the fur of his toy dog. Sherlock finds that he doesn’t care much for any other knowledge than knowing that the two most important people in the world are safe and warm. And if he squeezes his eyes shut, he knows that the fear of losing them is a livid, savage thing living in his chest.
Sherlock gently pries John out of the chair and tries not to find John endearing like this, his eyes warm and pliant and his movements sluggish from sleep. It’s entirely wasted on the New Scotland Yard.
"Let me go!" John grunts. He tries to sound defiant, and strong but he is terrified.
“Do we know anything about the victim?” DI Dregs asks as he pushes himself away from the corner to stand beside Sherlock, though keeping more than a respectful distance between them.  John is immensely grateful that Sherlock answers for him.
“You mean,” Doctor Fenway says smugly, “your Alpha, Sherlock Holmes, will realize.”
“We’re from the Council,” he lies smoothly, “making sure the flat is ready for the next occupant.”
“The pole is about…two meters long, it’s been cleared of bark and dried. It looks like oak. Further analysis will tell us more, but I wouldn’t hold my hopes up. There is a couple of prints in the blood here-”
“…When somebody….comes home.»
“…My name is Joseph Braitworth. I am an Alpha and a monster. I am to be held accountable for numerous illnesses inflicted on my employees. I knew they were working in unsafe environments, but I did not care because I thought them worthless and lesser human beings…. For….I…I frequently travel to…travel abroad to buy sexual favors from children and I…. “
I owe an immense debt to my beta reader, kgratz. She's amazingly insightful, helps me weed out all the stupid mistakes, and aids me with working out the main plot.
Four.
He’s not really sure how Sherlock would react to finding out his new flatmate is an Omega. He’s not really one to be concerned with social conventions and he’s never expressed any opinion whatsoever on the Alpha/Omega dynamic. But John doesn’t want to test Sherlock’s indifference.
“Nothing,” he replied, and Sherlock’s observational skills might still be on the mend, but no one would have missed the lack of conviction in the single word. “It’s fine.”
John’s little huff of a laugh and the gleam in his eyes and the flush of his cheeks were all only partly due to Sherlock’s good humor, and more to do with the last hour as a whole. He nodded and took in a deep breath to steady himself before finally letting go of Sherlock. (The detective tried, and failed, to ignore how he missed being cradled by that muscled, trustworthy arm almost immediately.)
(Billy, Sherlock had noticed in the last months, tended to gravitate toward the doctor almost like a kitten emulating its mother's feline skills...or rather a better comparison was a cub emulating a mighty lion. His past experiences had clearly made Billy slow to trust and quick to fight, but luckily both of these qualities were well understood by John. The man had managed to win Billy over not only through personal understanding of that mistrust and temper, but also because he was willing to take the time to teach the young man all the skills he'd wanted to learn but had had no father to teach him—specifically, self-defense and the defense of others. Now Billy was certainly more confident than he had been in the past, and though he carried himself like a strong man, his quick eyes still sought out John like a boy in search of his father's attention every time he entered the house.)
Sherlock realized he’d been stacking the perfectly-stacked photographs for a few seconds too long, and reached to pick up his jacket where he’d tossed haphazardly it on the desk.
“He’ll be back soon,” Sherlock replied neutrally. “I told him I’d save him some, and make some tea. Would you like any?”
Inseparable, that is, except for one issue; it was the same one that had plagued him from the start. A year ago, he’d believed it to be displeasure that John was no longer living there, no longer just across the hall from his room, a constant that was both useful and comforting. But it wasn’t just that, was it? It was that John was off living with
He was half-grinning—he couldn’t help it—almost playful despite the gravity of it, because at that question, John’s gaze fell automatically to his lips, then to the low cut of his old undershirt, then forcibly back up again. And Sherlock knew in that moment that this, their relationship, the rest of their lives, flirting with John and getting him riled up like this…it was going to be
But that had been years ago, so many, many years—nearly twenty in fact, and all those admiring acquaintances and so-called friends had been gone for so long he’d forgotten half their names. All except one, that one who had
“So I see.”
No answer came, but John entered the room and tossed his coat over the back of the settee with the same measure of heavy forcefulness he’d possessed near-stomping up the staircase.
around, however, Sherlock had given himself a new, secret mission. He was careful not to impose any drastic change too quickly, but he was determined to change his behavior, or rather his lack thereof, where it concerned John’s role in his life. Sherlock Holmes was a new man, no longer a wretched addict or a grief-stricken failure; he was a detective again, and a father for the first time, and so he would cease in making the same idiotic mistakes he’d made in the past..
“I suppose so,” he replied, hanging the hat on the stand and adding his coat with it. “Why do you say that?”
ANYWAYS. Sorry for babbling. Thank you so much for giving this fic a try and making it through all those long paragraphs. The next parts will have more dialogue and movement to the story. I just wanted to set it all up well in this first part. Chapter 2 next week on Wednesday!
“Haven’t we had enough great adventure for a lifetime?” John asked warily.
? he wondered in a flash, before he was distracted by the continued outpouring of his friend’s trembling baritone.
He smiled back at her, always a little shamefacedly with the guilt forever tucked into the back of his head, but reminded himself he could only do his very best to be the girls’ dad from now on and try to forgive
Only John wasn’t so distant or solemn or stone-faced anymore, was he? Well, he
Thank you so much to everyone who's left kudos and taken the time to comment! This story started out as just a little fix-it but it ended up meaning a lot to me so I'm glad y'all enjoyed it. This is the final part but I'm considering writing more for this show in the future so keep on the lookout for it maybe!
I just want to be clear here that I’m not against Alice as a character! And I don’t actually think the canon meant for her to be manipulative or anything. I just never felt like her relationship with Sherlock was a healthy one with true love, honestly, especially there at the very end. I mean she started the apocalypse ON PURPOSE but he still chose her?? Not my cup of tea for romance at all…plus, okay, yes, I want John to have the chance to be happy with Sherlock, damn it. But I just wanted to be clear that I’m
Sherlock hummed agreeably.
Only faintly uncertain because of the newness of the touch, he brushed his fingertips softly along the perfectly-groomed cut of John’s jawline. The man’s eyes lifted again to meet his, and Sherlock wondered exactly how many touches it would take before his friend would stop looking so surprised by them. That was something he was actually looking forward to counting.
“I thought you were sleeping,” Sherlock said, adjusting the instrument’s neck against his shoulder.
“So,” she said to John, “you’re moving back in.”
“John, why did you ask me to pick you up here?” a bright, articulate voice echoed up the staircase into the sitting room. “You could have asked me to come with you, you know. I know how hard it is for you to come back to this house when you need something. I really don’t mind tagging along for the support.”
Then they both found themselves smiling softly at one another, for no reason that either of them could really explain.
Though they both tended to be rather capable speakers, by the time the moment settled and they knew someone should say something, neither seemed to be able to find the vocabulary. As it happened there was no need, because the silence was shattered by the mantle clock’s brief seven-o’clock chime. Sherlock stepped back only slightly to look at the time, and found the room to be much darker than when he’d noticed last.
Well, that was the real extraordinary difference, wasn’t it?
been there.
“I think Michael is really good for John.”
“No,” he stopped him before he could even begin. “No, John. The truth only, starting now. What is it that Michael possesses that makes him so much better than any of those other men?”
He ignored how the girl’s eyes did not lose their suspicion and, through perhaps one of his finest performances ever, managed to keep his elation undetectable for the next two hours. While they told him about their week and all the trouble they’d gotten into within various social circles, he regaled them with a thrilling tale of a missing naval document and how the shallow cut on his arm got there in his retrieval of it. They teased him for being too slow when the villain had pulled the knife, and he halfheartedly defended himself while the fire crackled and the tea got cold. When he sat down again after brewing a fresh pot, he looked first to see Jessie’s cup entirely empty where she was sitting on the carpet next to his chair.
