“Understood.” Natasha said, getting to her feet, she nudged Clint, kicking his ankle when he didn’t move fast enough.
Clint was shifting around, his knees bouncing and fingers tapping with restless energy, Bruce was worrying at his bottom lip and there was a frown on his face as he stared out of the window.
“No, Europe somewhere,” Sam said, “I think Natasha is more interested in getting to somewhere with no extradition treaty while Rogers wants to find Barnes.” Rhodey snorted, rolling his eyes, as if that was news.
“As I was saying, he even brings a friend along, carries him so he doesn’t get over tired, and what does he get? Insults and ingratitude!”
Bruce would leave them to sleep, Peter would make them coffee and waft the cups under their noses to wake them up, Zach jumped on them and yelled at the top of his lungs for them to wake up.
“No!” Tony cried, but that was partly the truth, partly what he feared happening.
“No!” Tony screamed fighting against the restraints trying desperately to escape them to get to his baby, but Commander Kovarian ignored him, taking the baby out of the cell heedless of Tony’s screams.
It was just words, Zach didn’t mean it and Tony knew that but it also hurt to hear.
Getting through Manhattan was still difficult, and getting to Stark Tower was even harder but Steve had learned a few tricks in WWII that came in handy in avoiding the police barricades so he was able to pull up outside of Stark Towers and headed into the building, unsurprisingly he was stopped by security before he reached the lift, but once the receptionist had made a phone call to her HR, who’d called Pepper, who in turn had called, (Slapped a distracted Tony upside the head to get his attention) Steve was allowed to go to the Penthouse and given access to Tony’s private garage to park his bike first.
Feeling sick Steve ordered Natasha to close the portal. He stared up at the sky, watching as the hole closed up his eyes widening when he saw the red and gold suit. “Son of a gun!”
“I would like to keep you alive really.” Doctor Curien said, “But…perhaps, since Iron Man and the Avengers may indeed come looking, it would be better to just take samples and perform an autopsy before we discard you.”
“Would I be so shallow?” Tony pursed his lips and shrugged,
Zach’s face lit up in delight, “Can you show me how to get through the vents?” He asked.
“You came here very severely wounded, Mr Stark. You shouldn’t have lived, your aorta was ruptured and you should have bled out, you also responded very swiftly to treatment, far swifter than you should have given how gravely ill you were.” He explained, “We decided to run a blood panel on you to see what was going on and we found that your white cell count was far greater than normal yet you had no prior injury or illness to have caused this. So we have looked further into your blood work and found similarities to the blood work of Captain Rogers.”
“Promises, promises.” Tony purred, leaning back against the pillows and watching with rapt attention as Steve lubed up his fingers. He lifted his left leg, maintaining eye contact with Steve the whole time, as he placed his heel on the man’s shoulder and smirked at him.
“Does he have any allergies or medical conditions?”
His Father had hurt his Mamma?
Tony wanted to scream, wanted to fight, he wanted to hold his baby inside him and keep it there until they were safe, but he couldn’t, when the contraction came, he couldn’t do anything but let nature take its course. This contraction had barely finished before the next one hit and he hardly had a chance to drag in a gulp of air before he was pushing again and then the pain was gone and… the most beautiful sound was filling the air, his baby was crying for the first time!
“What happened?” Rogers asked, as horrified as the young man, Sam, Steve thought his name was, at the mention of Steve’s earths destruction.
“Sorry.” Peter mumbled guiltily. If he hadn’t thrown his own tantrum earlier then Tony wouldn’t have to be dealing with Zach having one now because he couldn’t play with Peter.
“The garage?” Steve repeated following after Peter, “Why would we go there?”
But might have had something to do with Expresso climbing over his head at two in the morning as the damn creature had decided it wanted attention.
“With blueberries and maple syrup.”
Both Zach and Cal had ice skating class every Saturday afternoon for and hour, having this activity in common had helped them form their friendship both in and out of school.
“I… sorry, I didn’t… we were, I was…”
He did an Expo, the first since Howard’s in the seventies, opening it in the suit now he had lost enough baby weight to wear it again.
“I do need them Pep, and I won’t be selfish with them, the staff can use them too, just think of the benefit for their stress levels! You can even hold your boring board meetings in there and when some stuffy old fart gets to annoying you can shoot him without getting arrested!”
Tony shook his head, tears rolling his cheeks, “I didn’t,” he sobbed, “I was dreaming, and I saw the end of the world,”
“Spiderbrats!” Tony called from the lift.
“Nothing wrong,” Steve reassured him, or attempted to, but Tony was shaking his head and staring at him in shock,
The ultra-lean and ultra-toned might be seen as the ultimate form of physical beauty in the twenty-first century, but Steve came from a time when being chunky was considered attractive, when curves were far more desired than bones. There had been far too many starving waifs during the late twenties and early thirties thanks to the depression, no one found the sight of a protruding rib cage, or pelvis attractive back then, because pretty much everyone was on the verge of having such a physique because they couldn’t afford to eat.
There was more blood on his clothing, down his front, some on his thighs, smears of it on his face and his neck, some had even dripped down beneath the neck of his clothing and smeared on the skin of his chest.
“Where’s your Mother?” Steve asked wondering if Tony was up yet.
The silence hung heavy in the tower after Tony’s speech, an uncomfortable silence that no one felt that they could break, they couldn’t meet each others eyes or do anything but stare down at their feet.
“Tony.” Steve breathed throwing himself down and scrabbling at the dirt, everyone followed his lead, shifting away the charred brick and metal, revealing more and more of the armour until finally enough of it was clear for Thor to get his arms about the torso and pull it up and out of the rubble revealing a naked and bloody Peter cradled in the arms completely shielded from the fire.
“Hopefully a promise of blueberry pancakes will win him over.” Steve said, knowing that Tony wouldn’t be happy about a dawn wake up call.
“BARTON!” Tony bellowed stomping for the lift, “Damn your feathered brainless ass, I’m gonna stick you up on a pole in a field and use you as a scare crow!”
Yawning he tugging his arms out from under the bed covers and fisted his eyes, rubbing the sleep out of them then promptly looked around at his bed companions.
“Captain Steven Grant Rogers, US Army, aka Captain America,” he replied, “You?”
“Hello Mr Stark.” The moderator greeted, “Before we begin I’d like to offer mine and everyone’s best wishes on your recovery.”
Tony grinned without opening his eyes. He knew it! Those Captain America shorts had pushed Steve’s buttons.
“No I’m not.” Steve said, “I am far from perfect. Everyone is. Everyone makes mistakes, you, me, everyone. But what matters is that we try to make amends for them, that we try and do better so that we don’t repeat the mistakes we’ve made.”
“This isn’t your fault either.” Steve said cutting Tony off before he could speak, “I know you hate this, being dependant, anyone would. I know its humiliating to not be able to do basic things for yourself, and I know its hurting your pride, but you need to know that no one, especially not me, thinks any less of you.”
Stark Tower.
“I have some acid in my lab we can use to dissolve them.” Bruce offered.
“Ancient, I’m younger than you.” Steve protested, nudging Tony back, taking care not to use much strength, he didn’t want to knock him over. Tony of course retaliated, elbowing Steve and poking at him until the Captain lifted him up and carried him over one shoulder with Tony hooting with laughter, oblivious to the stares that came from the Shield staff observing their antics.
Pain struck Peter’s throat and his eyes brimmed with tears, “I’m sorry.” He whimpered, “I just wanted you to be proud of me.”
“And you need to focus on finding the tesseract.”
“I know I want to marry you but…..why does it have to be so complicated. In my day people booked the church, got rings and outfits, then had cake and bootleg champagne at their parent’s house.”
Peter just had to hold his nerve, keep his mouth shut, put up with his guilt for a little bit longer and then he could present his parents with all the evidence he, MJ, and Ned had gathered on Osborn and prove to them that he was capable of being an adult and an Avenger.
Tony and Steve made use of these, covering their clothing and their faces to conceal with identity as they entered the hospital.
For his hearing Tony created a set of earphones that could completely cancel out sound, but could also receive sound with different settings, so Peter could gradually increase the amount of sound he was exposed to until he learned to control his ears enough to not need to shut out sound at all.
But then, as he was walking home from school, on one of the rare occasions he wasn’t picked up by either Steve or Tony, he had seen a mugger ripping a purse from an old woman, knocking her over and leaving her in the gutter.
Clint had been sleeping at the time and had awoken to something prodding his leg and saying “Exterminate!” as it flashed a blue glowing light at him.
Steve chuckled, he knew that twins would be a lot to ask for and really he would be satisfied with one baby, but he couldn’t get the image of both him and Tony holding a baby in their arms, tiny little new borns with scrunched up faces, big dark eyes, and impossibly tiny hands that looked like they belonged on dolls.
“Stop!” Tony cried, “Please stop!”
“If we are going to do this, if we’re going to work together on this then we have to trust one another.” Steve said looking around, “That is the only way this will work. It’s the only way any team works.” He looked at each of them, “Tony’s told us all his story of how he came to be here, everyone knows mine, how I went from picking fights in alleys to being chosen for the super soldier program. Now how about the rest of you?”
The host blanched looking sickened, “The man deserved to die for such actions.”
“Is it alright, did that bastard do something?”
He managed to escape from her and got out with the file from Mrs Davies, happily appropriating the car the fake Government agent had been driving.
Since the serum he didn’t need to relieve himself as much as he had before. His body was better at using all he consumed for energy so very little waste was produced, however some was, and his body really wanted to be rid of it.
Curien was sweating and pacing in the filthy alley he’d been hiding in as he waited for Osborn to pick him up. He was in a lot of pain, the doctors at the clinic had patched him up and given him a shot of morphine but that had worn off and he had no money to get any pain relief or the follow up treatment he needed. His arm was as good as useless right now, hanging limp in a sling with the fingers numb and the rest of the arm throbbing, especially around the shoulder joint which felt like it was on fire. He almost wished that Stark had blown his arm clean off because that would have hurt a lot less then this did, and he might yet lose the arm depending on whether or not surgery would be successful in treating the damaged nerves and tendons, not to mention the bones that needed pinning and plating.
Deep down inside Tony had known even before the doctor had told him, he had just not let himself acknowledge the truth, hadn’t wanted to admit to himself that he couldn’t feel anything past his pelvis and not very much below his belly button.
She smiled in the darkness of her room. Tonight had been the closest she had gotten to pushing Stark over the edge, just a little more and she would succeed in bringing her families murderer down.
Steve found himself enchanted by the playful machines, laughing as they chased after the tennis balls he threw for them, the mess Butterfingers made with a smoothie and tried to feed to Tony, soaking the Geniuses shirt in green gunk.
At least some things had stayed the same, he mused, taking a good look at this Tony.
Tony began kissing Peter's face and held his IV free hand tightly begging Peter to be strong and to come back to them.
“He’ll be alright.” Thor said nodding his head, trying to appear more confident that he obviously felt, “He is strong, he is a fighter.”
“Bah bah, nah!” Lily giggled, tugging at Tony’s beard, yeah that still hurt and so did her grabbing his hair and tugging on it.
“But what if I can’t get a handle on it?” Peter asked, “What if I’m going to always be like this?”
Once everyone had eaten they took turns taking showers, shaving, and getting their swimwear on. Natasha posed smugly in her bikini that covered just enough skin to be legal in public and smirked at the blushes her curves drew from the men. She also commandeered Clint to smother her fair skin in sunscreen before she doned a sun hat, a pair of sunglasses and flip flops ready to go to the beach.
“Those labs, where were they located?” Steve asked.
Ross chuckled, “That is why I am calling you, to give you a chance to save yourself.”
The timid question came from across the room, from Peter, pulling everyone’s attention to him. Steve lifted his head from Natasha’s shoulder to look at the pale faced teen who stepped forward, rubbing his nose on his sleeve and sniffing as he did.
“Was it scary?” Peter asked, looking up to meet Tony’s eyes, “On the other side?”
“I’ll whip us up a chilli if that’s alright with everyone?” Bruce offered. He received several nods of agreement, Sam even took over his unpacking so Bruce would be free to go and cook right away which meant they’d all be eating sooner.
So they did. Dressed in traditional Wakandan garb, they were wed by a Wakandan priest with every superhero on Earth as witness as they exchanged vows.
“This seems a good place for lunch.” Steve agreed setting his own pack down in the shade.
Tony scoffed and rolled his eyes. “Why does no one take me seriously?” He muttered to himself, “Here we are at horror movie central. The middle of nowhere, so no one can hear us screaming when we’re being ripped apart or eaten or both, and all anyone thinks about is tent pegs.”
“Human, shit like the stuff Hydra was doing?”
“Somehow I don’t think he will.” Tony said his tone resigned, “The bastard doesn’t care about his Son, or about anything but himself.”
Zach grinned, he’d heard his Mamma use that code a few times and now it had come in handy, “Take me back to Mamma, Jarvis.” He ordered the AI.
Peter cringed at the nickname and quickly typed back yes before he could loose his nerve. They exchanged a few more texts before stopped so they could finish their homework and go and have dinner.
Deadpool clasped both hands over his cheeks, “Well your denial of our searing hot romance is killing me!”
“Is Jarvis back online?” Steve asked.
“There’s no need to get snippy, missy.” Tony grumbled scowling at the eggs, which had become stuck to the pan. Thankfully he used a spatula to scrape them from the pan before going to get another couple of eggs from the fridge, snagging the toast from mid air as he passed Toby, the toast was slightly singed, but edible, which for Toby was a miracle.
Steve Roger’s time in the ice.
Steve grinned, “I’m flattered, and I would love him to think of me as a Father. So long as it’s alright with you.”
Hydra Safe House.
“What would you prefer, another New York attack?” Natasha asked sharply.
“Stark, you know that’s a one way trip.” Rogers said.
“I will.” Tony said, regretting it when Steve moved back, missing the warmth of his body.
Steve was sure Stane would have been the type to abandon Tony after this kind of injury, to write him off as damaged goods and leave him to fend for himself, while Tony was just stubborn enough to get himself together and thrive on his own just to spite Stane, it wasn’t fair that he would have had to go through all this alone and Steve was thankful that things had played out in such a way that the Omega had a strong support system around him.
“When you are in the bath and it becomes cold can you make it hot again?”
“Where is he?”
“Oh? So he wasn’t asleep on top of you this morning then?” Sam asked far too innocently and Tony slipped with his tools and cursed. He risked looking up and saw Steve blushing furiously and stammering incoherently.
He provided me with a roof over my head, tools that I needed, and some dubious home cooking so I wouldn’t starve.”
“Nope, you’ll have to wait for the party.”
“Because he’s an idiot.” Tony said cutting up some of his bacon and gave it to Espresso, this of course meant that he had to give some to Gingerbread too, as the cat was whining at his feet.
*****
“And I can do that while I design a new armour.” Tony said, “And while we’re at it I need a coffee, I am serious caffeine deprived and going into withdrawal, so chop chop Cap, get me my coffee, a tablet, and my brain child!”
“You’d kill me anyway.” Clint scoffed at her.
“Wha….” Peter mouth dropped open and he stared at MJ in horror, recoiling as she took a tape measure from her pocket, “Lets get you measured up!”
It was a good threat, Iron Man, and the whole world knew of what Tony had done to Killian for hurting Peter and Kidnapping Zach. Doctor Curien however didn’t look overly impressed.
With repulsor blasts from both of his gauntlets he destroyed the doors in a shower of exploding glass and metal. He marched into the factory crushing debris under the weight of his boots.
“I am not meaning to upset you.” Pepper said, allowing Tony his dramatics as she was very well versed to them.
“Tell them what?” Tony asked, looking between the Lexus and the Lamborghini.
“Spending time with my best boys? Sure, we’ll have a great time won’t we?” Happy replied.
“Not my fault you’re short.” Zach said with a far too innocent grin.
“No, but I’ll bet groping your ass will!”
“Hurts.” Tony panted.
*****
“For how long?” Peter asked.
“Why?” Tony asked gesturing to the explosion of pink.
“I think we’ve got some Limpets here.” Peter said from where he and Tony were looking into another pool, “And a starfish.”
Once the emergency services arrived on the scene they began to take over the rescue effort, the fire department got to work on putting the fires out while the Police too brief statements and rounded up the workers for further questioning, they took statements from the avengers too, but allowed them to keep on working, the medical services took away the first woman to be pulled out of the debris and soon had several other people to care for, all suffering burns, smoke inhalation, blast wounds, and crush injuries, that would likely prove fatal even with medical intervention.
“Oh its so sweet!” Wade cooed, he looked from Steve to Tony and back and again, “The two of you have got to do the super-cock, male pregnancy thing and make a baby together, just imagine it, Cap’s boyish, all American masturbation fantasy looks, and Stark’s super brains, he’ll be the super sexiest, super smartest, mother-fucking, motherless superhero ever!”
Thor frowned, “I do not have any jewels with me on Midgard. All jewels are in the treasury on Asgard.”
“We can explain everything Mr Stark, I promise!” Came Peter’s voice and Sam resisted the urge to face palm, especially when Deadpool breathed on the glass and began to draw obscene pictures in the condensation.
“It is possible. I am afraid I cannot provide you with certainties.” Jarvis said, “I can however hypothesize that they will not be satisfied by merely wounding Sir, even severely, therefore they may well attempt another assault to finish the job as it were.”
Turning away from his slanging match with MJ for the moment, Harry turned back to Peter, “You know, if Stark hadn’t been looking for good publicity to make up for the shit he did at his fucking expo, you’d have just been left to rot in some shit hole care home, have become some redneck truck drivers bitch instead of Stark’s mascot. You ain’t special, you’re just a pathetic orphan than no one gives a fuck about.”
“The fuck is this?” Tony whispered, “An AI?”
“Great.” Tony expanded the design on his tablet screen so he could get a closer look, “The interior is going to need a complete overhaul for all of this, the harness needs to be able to support my weight but not be constrictive, I’ll also need to make sure that my spine is well protected and isn’t put under additional stress.”
Steve nodded, “Whatever it takes.” He said, “So I can be with you both,” He paused and looked into Tony’s eyes, “So I can earn back your trust.”
Zach was rarely ill, something that Tony was deeply grateful for. He’d gotten all of Zach’s shots, even thought he hated seeing his Pup crying as the needles went into his skin, and he’d taken extra precautions changing Zach’s nappies after the Polio immunisation, having a booster jab for himself.
“Yeah, go on.” Steve said ruffling Peter’s hair. He really wasn’t a bad boy, he was just a teenager struggling to cope with puberty, and then his entire being changed by the mutation, and it had all gone to his head, a bit of mouthing off was to be expected, but, Steve would make sure Peter knew that there was a line he didn’t cross so that situations like this wouldn’t be repeated. A week of no internet except for school work, and not being allowed to leave his room except to go to the bathroom and for meals would teach him a lesson but would also do him no harm.
“The camp you rescued him from, Skull had used a bastardized form of the serum on him.”
Deciding to take charge for the moment, until Steve came back to his senses, Tony looked around for something he could use to drag the suit with them, doubting that it would fold back down into the suitcase form, not until he’d done some serious repair work on it, all he needed was some rope and he’d be able too……blinding light shone in his face and Tony held his good hand up to shield his eyes.
Steve was now pretty sure that his bottom jaw was on his shoes. Pepper patted his back, “Don’t worry.” She said encouragingly, “You do get used to his eccentricities after about a decade of being around him.”
“Do you have anything?” Steve asked, sitting up for a moment, giving Tony a good look at his washboard abs and firm pectorals. He couldn’t help but to feel a little intimidated by Steve’s perfect physique. While he was not over-weight, Tony was well aware that he was not as fit as he used to be, nor did he have a six pack. When he was eating properly his abdomen tended to have a slight roundness to it these days, thanks to his metabolism slowing with the onset of middle age.
“Do you think Stark would mind if I killed this clown?” Bucky asked, glaring at Deadpool,
“Okay.” Peter said managing a small smile, “Can I go speak to Mamma now?”
“Brain washing, some kind of hypnotic suggestion.” He whispered, his voice hoarse both from the swelling in his throat and the sudden dryness of his tongue. “They might even have him on some kind of drug to supress his memories.”
Bruce snickered at Tony’s impression of Gollum, “A fair comparison.” Jarvis allowed, “And from the readings we have taken, of the object and your MRI, CAT, PET and EEG scans, we can definitely see matching energy readings between the two.”
“I am.” Peter said earnestly, “For all of the trouble I’ve caused, and I promise this will never happen again.”
“You come too.” Zach said, “And we go for Ice cream.”
Thor chuckled, “Twas the closest water source.” He said, “However I think it would be wise for us to return to the hospital.” He stood up and offered his hand to Zach who took it, getting to his feet somewhat shakily, “It will be alright little one.” Thor assured him, lifting the boy up into his arms and holding him to his chest, “Now, would you like to hold Mjolnir with me?”
The restaurant that Steve had chosen for them was a small, family run steak house. While he was enjoying trying new cuisine, Steve still liked the foods he was familiar with and had always enjoyed, Steak especially, since meat had been rationed during in the war, and difficult and expensive to buy, at least decent cuts had been during the depression, a really good steak had been a rare treat.
Carefully, Steve began to extract his arm, tugging carefully at the limb, trying to slide it out from under Tony without disturbing the Omega, not an easy task when Tony was moved every time he pulled on his arm.
He had a great sense of humour, could banter with Tony, and dear God could the man flirt!
Once the presents were open, Bruce disappeared into the kitchen with May and Laura to cook the dinner, while Natasha curled up on the couch with Pepper to talk, leaving Rhodey and Sam to discuss past missions from the air-force.
Bruce wore a pair of grey and black Hawaiian trunks and a t-shirt, he also had a thick book to read and had the presence of mind to put together several beach towels.
Aside from that embarrassment, Peter was left feeling exhilarated and powerful. It had been childs play to stop the muggings and the drunks, none of them had known how to fight, not properly, they’d thrown wide arched punches at his head which he would have been able to dodge even if he didn’t have fast reflexes. With the training he’d been getting from Steve and Natasha, Peter was able to flip them onto their backs and secure them to the nearest solid object without even breaking a sweat.
“I’ve fucked it up, I’ve fucked everything up!” Steve wept.
“Damn, Honeybear are you ever letting that go?”
Jarvis tilted his head to the side as much as the Vision armour would allow, “It is possible.” He said slowly, “It would have to be done with the greatest of care and you would probably need a support brace for your back, but I believe it is possible.”
Tony explained the decision to keep his actions a secret to Zach as best he could without frightening his Son, who had already been traumatized enough for one lifetime. He explained it in a way of saying how comic book super-heroes kept their identities a secret in order to protect their civilian lives and families, and how The Doctor never actively sort out recognition for what he had done, he left his actions speak for themselves.
Steve looked back down at him as Tony glanced up and his expression had softened, “We can, but you need to talk to me, we need to have communication between us otherwise things will never work.”
Bucharest
“But you are my AI!” Tony whined giving into the urge to stomp his foot, “I made you, I nurtured you and taught you, and have helped you grow from a baby AI to an adult AI. I gave virtual birth to you Jarvis. I am your Mother and creator, and…… and it’s not fair if you take Steve’s side over mine!”
Of course, that was the black and white view his child self had, when he’d been wiping blood from his nose after Howard’s fist had struck again. He had yet to go to college and be exposed to endless supplies of alcohol and drugs, had yet to meet Ty Stone and find himself date raped by the sack of shit.
Stane had been proud of what he was doing to Tony, proud that he was causing him to self destruct.
“I don’t think it was just the gamma radiation that has affected you, but also by the spider itself.” Bruce typed out on a tablet after the incident.
They ran for the stairs but found it blocked by tourists and agents coming up the stairs, more were following them down the corridor leaving them with no escape route, or almost no escape route.
While MJ worked on getting into the computers from the inside, Peter began to go through the desk draws and filing cabinets looking for anything interesting and possibly incriminating, he was just flipping through a file when a loud moan made him jump and drop the folder to the floor, papers scattering everywhere.
If Steve had been angry before, it was nothing compared with how he felt after Tony had told him of the horrors he’d been suffering in his mind since Sokovia. It made him even more eager to track down the Maximoff’s and destroy them.
Tony grinned, “I know just the guy for the job.”
“What’s going on, Boss?” Happy asked.
“Its over now.” He said, looking to Lily who’d cried herself into an exhausted sleep, “Let’s get these assholes locked up and head for home.”
“I didn’t attack him.”
“He’s not alone, bitch!” Bucky said from behind her and his metal fist smashed into her face.
“Everyone loves Zach,” Tony said rolling his eyes at the thought of his toddler, “He’s impossible not to love. All big eyes and cheeky smiles, everyone melts when they see him.”
“After all the help your Son gave me, I think it’s the least I can do.” Tony said truly not caring about the money, he was far more concerned with how Peter and Harley were becoming thick as thieves in the new workshop. “Don’t you two start getting ideas on plotting against me.” he called out to them, “I’ve told you already Pete, college first, world domination after.”
“It doesn’t matter anyway.” Sam said, “What happened to them is sad, its horrible even, but they aren’t the only kids who have lost their parents during a war. Civilians are always caught in the cross fire, thousands if not millions of children have lost their parents in similar circumstances, especially during the blitz.” He looked to Steve as he said this, the Captain nodding his head in agreement. “And those children have not grown up to join Hydra or other terrorist organisations.”
The sky was on fire, the atmosphere of the planet was in flames; the ground was scorched black and crumbled under foot sending plumes of smoky dust into the chocking fume filled air.
“Wade… “
“Yeah but maybe you could start doing some stuff. Like maybe not taking on Aliens and Nazis but helping people out like you did MJ when Harry attacked her.” Ned suggested, “You could stop bullies from beating up kids, stop muggers from robbing old ladies and stuff like that.”
“I don’t care!” Rogers yelled, “Stark has Bucky, we have to save him before Stark can hurt him.”
“I’ve missed you too, and you’ve grown.” Tony said, “You’ve got to stop that now, I refuse to allow you to grow anymore. Friday make a note, Zach is not to be fed anymore, he’s not to be given any sunlight either, he’s got to stay in his room in the dark so he stays small.”
“A mind rapist, great.” Clint grunted. He of all the Avengers had a special hatred towards mind control after what he’d gone through during Loki’s attack on New York.
“The City will be on fire soon then, and covered in spider webbing, we’ll be getting calls from the local police department about raging infernos and people sticking to walls, buildings, and the streets!” Tony prophesized, “And Clint will be encouraging the mayhem, because he always encourages mayhem, Laura told me that he engaged in open warfare with Lila and Cooper and over two dozen eggs were sacrificed and her living room had to be completely redecorated!”
“Your mission is accomplished?” he asked eyeing the deep gnash in the metal arm. “Stark and Rogers?”
His handler was cursing as new information came to him. It didn’t matter to the Asset, he didn’t handle that side of things, that was for the handler to deal with, he just did the physical work, the elimination of the targets. Who picked them, who decided these things was unknown to the asset and he did not question it, didn’t think to, he didn’t care. He hadn’t been programmed to care.
“Please just kill me, if I have to listen to this shit any longer I’m gonna slit my own throat!”
“Is your Hammer really magic?” Zach asked, “And can only you lifted it?”
“Pizza?” If Tony’s go to food was burgers and Zach’s was pancakes, Peter’s was Pizza, the cheesier the better.
“No.” Steve said, “No racing, not here, not now, no.” He scowled at DUM-E who seemed to blow a raspberry at him which made Zach laugh.
That was definitely one of the best parts of the twenty-first century, the abundance of food, and so much variety too. He didn’t have to feel guilty now that he ate more than anyone else, because no one was before forced to make do with less.
The man had already lost so much, he deserved better than spending his life tied to a crippled partner.
“You’re on.”
“Mamma.” Peter whispered his voice choked.
“I’m glad he and Pete get along with everyone so well.” Tony said as he snuggled into Steve’s chest.
Before them the Oscorp factory was burning, the top floors having fallen down into the ground floor leaving just a few walls standing. Smoke was billowing out towards the sky and fire burning against the stone.
Zach nodded, “I understand Miss.” He said brightly and then startled the teacher by hugging her, “I’m really glad to be back I’ve missed learning here so much!”
“Prove it.” Steve challenged and the screens began showing images from Zola’s archive, the creation explaining how Hydra had evolved and had been playing a long game to get Humanity to willing give up its freedom instead of just taking it from them. How they had been in the heart of Shield from the beginning, a malignant growth hiding deep inside the body, slowly but surely gaining size and strength, perverting justice, twisting fact and fiction, mongering war to their own ends.”
“Spy Lady brought Birdy Man and offer man to see you, Mamma.” Zach informed him, wriggling down from Natasha and running over to get picked up by Tony.
“And with additional electrical stimulus and robotics to the joints, the legs will be able to function as if you are walking normally.”
“But only when there is absolutely no other choice.” Steve coldly stated, he had a hard look in his eyes when they turned to him, “I know all about the sacrifices of war, Agent Romanoff, more so than you, and the action taken by your employers was wrong.”
“Fuck.” MJ breathed, running her hands through her hair. By now a crowd had gathered to watch the fight, several kids were recording it on their phones and were cheering the boys on.
“One put together with wooden spoons and bandages?” Fury drawled eyeing Tony’s makeshift splint, “Carter, go and get the medical supplies, Stark needs something better than that.”
“Hold on, I’ve got you,” Steve said, gritting his teeth, he was fighting gravity and his position was wrong for lifting which made this all the harder, but he had to do it, he had to get Tony back up onto the landing pad.
“It’ll be alright Steve.” Bruce said, but they both knew it was only words, something to say to try and make them both feel better, because the truth was, neither of them knew if anything was ever going to be okay again.

“And you think this could really work?”
“Wipe his face.” The archer instructed retreating to a safe distance with Rhodey, Thor, and Sam, while Pepper and Natasha stood behind May and Bruce with the towels and bed sheet at the ready.
Red faced and spluttering, Reed attempted to defend himself and a rather juvenile exchange of insults followed that Clint and Johnny may or may not have been encouraging, while Natasha and Sue tried to stop Hulk and Thing from destroying anymore property by getting into a brawl.
As he welded the helmet Tony called Happy on his mobile ordering him to keep the kids away from the Tower and if possible to get out of New York altogether.”
“Probably not so do fascinate us please.” Tony deadpanned, shifting Lily who grabbed onto his beard, “Oww, sweetie please, we’ve talked about this.” He took her hand from his face and Lily giggled, blowing a raspberry at him.
He made his way through guided by Jarvis, passing through a hidden doorway and into what had to be the main vault where a downed leviathan lay in ruins along with the sceptre.
Sam grinned showing perfect pearly white teeth, “It sure was, Mr Stark.”
“We need to find the spear.” Tony said, his fingers tapping a nervous rhythm, “We don’t know what its truly capable of. Reindeer games could control minds with it, shoot energy beams from it, whose to know what else it can do, or what it might do to people stupid enough to play around with it.”
“Again, no, it’s Agent. Agent Agent, not Phil and certainly not Uncle Phil.” Tony protested. Coulson shot him another unimpressed look.
“The same goes for you Ned.” Mrs Leeds said, “I am so disappointed in you.”
“It’s not ending here.” Steve replied his heart pounding as he spoke.
“You do, right here.” Tony said pointing to the end of Zach’s nose, “Here too, and here and here,” He tickled Zach’s sides until the boy was a squirming and giggling mess sprawled across his lap.
He led them into the Tower and took them up to the common room, where Tony was speaking a frazzeled and sleep deprived looking Bruce.
“Indeed the Man of Iron is greatly wounded.” Thor said bowing his head.
The Principal said it was serious. If it was serious then they might die and if they died….
By the time they were done it was time for lunch. Sam and Steve had gone back to the villa and made up sandwiches and wraps, bringing them down with bags of crisps and mini snack cakes.
Rhodey opened his mouth but couldn’t find anything to say, “I don’t suppose we could ask her?” Matt asked, and Tony shook his head,
Three months, he had to be on this stuff for three months, and then when his heat came he had an increased chance of conceiving.
“So, who’s home?” He asked.
It was completely unfair, Zach had never been in trouble at school, not beyond the odd bit of mischief in class, he’d never been in fights or caused damage to the school property, but because he was enhanced some parents had decided to kick up a fuss about the possible threat he might pose to their children and the school had been forced to suspend Zach until after the investigation.
“Now Rhodey!” Tony yelled, from the air as he blasted at Glaive’s back while Steve beat at his front with the shield,
The first dinner he had with his family after his mood swing was awkward, he wasn’t sure what to say to the rest of the team, he’d apologised to Tony and Steve but everyone knew that it would take more than an apology for things to be completely alright.
“Lady and gentlemen I have eyes on the prize.” He said tapping on his suit which broke away from him.
“I jarred it when we went through the window.” Tony said, “Probably knocked the bone out of alinement again,” he looked to Maria, “Can you set it?” He asked her, Maria frowned.
“Grown ups do funny things.” Zach said going back to his drawing.
The questions continued in this manner, with the reporters steering towards the more business like questions and keeping away from personal matters. They asked Pepper about SI and what impact this would have, they asked Rhodey how this would affect SI’s contracts with the military, and if War Machine would be stepping in as well as Vision and the Iron Legion.
Clint was happy to be filmed practising his archery at the range. He enjoyed showing off his skill and answered all of the hosts questions on the bows he used, the type of arrows he used for each shot, how he judged distance and wind speed to get the perfect shot, and from what range he could fire from.
“Out of everyone here, who is wearing a spangly outfit and not of use?”
“Shut up Darnel!” One of the guards snapped.
“My parents?” Tony whispered looking sick, his skin colour had leached away, his face was pasty and grey.
As it was he was being crucified by the media, along with Wanda for her past affiliation with Hydra.
“I’ve found animals.” Peter whispered back, “Lab animals.” He looked sadly at the poor creatures wishing he could free them. Maybe he could take them back to the Tower when he came back here with the Avengers?
“Tony, you don’t need a miniature bowling alley, laser quest, or paint balling range.” The red head protested, batting away the holographic screens Tony had pulled up.
Oh God, oh God, the Doctor was cutting him open, while he was alive!
“Incomplete, and the doctor who developed it couldn’t complete it herself, she needed Tony. Killian and she kidnapped Zach, putting Peter in the hospital, and attacked Tony. He injected Zach with the serum which severely endangered his life to put pressure on Tony to complete the serum.”
For smell Peter was given a face mask with a filter that would block all smell or allow a small amount in so he could gradually expose himself.
“I’m with you Buck, till the end of the line.”
Fear gripped at Tony’s insides like a giant fist had wrapped around his intestines and begun to squeeze.
“Shut it feather-head.” Tony said with a roll of his eyes as Steve protested about being a virgin before this.
“You’re coming for a dunking Stark!” Clint yelled gleefully, unaware of the panic that was setting in for Tony.
“Absolutely, what other kind is there?”
Clint chewed on his bottom lip, “If there is no discussion of my family brought up. Or our past missions.” Natasha hummed her agreement at that.
“Unless you drop the law suite you are pursuing against my company.”
“Do you think anyone will notice if we sneak away before dawn to go on honeymoon for like… the next month or three?” Tony asked conspiringly,
Natasha pulled back her shoulders, her expression resolute, “Fine by me. We’ll get along fine without you.” Inside she was already wondering what the hell they would do, and how she was going to manage dealing with Wanda’s adolescent tantrums, and Cap’s self-righteous idiocy. She supposed that she could go it alone if it came to it, but she hoped that it would not, as she did not have many places she could run to now for safety, not once the news of the Stark’s murder came out.
“No, God no!” Tony said, letting out a little laugh, “He’s straight, and even if he wasn’t I’d be the last person he’d want to be with,” He tried to say it as a joke, as thought it didn’t sting, but in truth, Steve Rogers holier than thou disapproving attitude towards him did hurt. Tony had never been ashamed of his sexuality before, but Steve had a way of making him feel that way when it came to his liking men and women. Really it was just another thing that Steve disapproved of, along with the drinking, the sass, the sarcasm, the way he threw his money around. Iron Man was probably the only thing that Steve didn’t disapprove of and he’d gone and fucked that right up as well hadn’t he?
Tony tipped the porter with a wad of notes that added up to a nice round grand, then went and threw himself down onto the plush sofa, putting his feet up on the coffee table and turned on the TV.
“Sorry.” Tony said, “I know he was your friend and all, you don’t need to hear this.”
“Because you never had one.” A voice whispered to him,
"What?" Tony felt his legs go out from under him and had it not been for Steve holding him up he would have fallen to the ground.
“I am not a sack of potatoes!” Tony complained as he was jostled by the motion of Steve running,
“I suppose.” Tony murmured looking at the tray table containing something bland and likely tasteless, “Okay, I’ll eat.” He said and Steve immediately brightened, “So long as you get me a cheese burger!”
“Why is this happening Mamma?” Peter sniffled, his face red and wet with tears of exhaustion and pain. “I can smell everything, taste the scents on my tongue, hear everything, and the lights are too bright, far too bright!”
They were as shocked and horrified as Tony had been when Steve recounted his tale of what had happened to his world, the utter destruction that Thanos had brought, and how Steve and Lily had barely escaped with their lives.
“Zach!” his Mamma breathed rising from the counter, Zach stumbled backwards, his pants falling from his hands as tears filled his eyes.
“Aaaahhhh!” Lily declared and reached out grabby hands for Tony,
“Hopefully you’ll be out here soon.” Steve said patting Peter’s good leg, although the other was nearly healed, the fractured bone was almost completely knitted back together and the gunshot had already scarred over and was starting to fade.
The Doctor gagged and implored Tony with his eyes until he lessened his hold on his throat enough so he could speak.
“Friday, Peter, and Bruce helped me make it.” Zach said, “I thought it’d help you get things down from high places or low places.”
Pepper had begged him to get help, Rhodey had tried to reason with him, both no avail. Tony had been determined to self-destruct, to bury himself in work until it finally crushed him. Eventually his body hadn’t been able to take anymore and he’d collapsed, being rushed to hospital, sick with malnutrition, dehydration, and exhaustion.
“I’ll have you roasted if you carry on,” Pepper growled, Tony mimed zipping his lips, looking like a misbehaving five year old.
“Us three.” Steve said falling into place between him and Natasha.
“Yeah!” Zach cried his eyes lighting up at the promise of chocolate goodness.
“I mean what, what do I have to do to convince you that I am in this for the long haul?” Steve asked gesturing at Tony, “Saying I love you isn’t enough, asking you to marry me doesn’t work, building a relationship with the boys hasn’t convinced you, being at your hospital bed every day for three months doesn’t change your mind and get you to believe that I love you and won’t leave you. Just tell me, what do I have to do to get you to trust me?” It was anger in Steve’s voice, that would have been easier to deal with, it was hurt, deep hurt, just as Steve had felt when he’d found out about Tony’s fertility treatment.
“So, would you like to move back to New York?”
“It’s not all your fault, Pete.” Steve said, “Don’t start blaming yourself for everything and take the weight of the world on your shoulders. That’s your Mother’s job!” It was a weak joke but it did manage to make Peter smile a little. “You want to know how you can make this up to us?” Steve asked and Peter nodded eagerly.
“I know.” Steve groaned, really wishing he’d been able to catch that before he’d said it. He did make himself feel a little better by flipping off the bike and then hurling it into an on coming jeep, “It just slipped out.”
“You want Mamma to get better quickly so he can come home don’t you?” Peter persisted, this got a nod of the head at least and Peter grinned, “Well, you’ll do whatever it takes to get him home quick then won’t you, even if it means having to go on ahead of him.”
Breaking out of the momentary trance, Tony took Lily from Steve, letting her wrap her arms about his neck and nuzzle into him with a contented chirrup.
“Burn him.” Natasha said throwing lighter fluid onto Tony’s prone body,
At least he’d been allowed to have his friend Rhodey in attendance, otherwise he’d have had no one but Obie and his Parents socialite friends and business associates. Tony had gone through the whole ceremony feeling sick to his stomach. Since Ty he hadn’t wanted and Alpha near him, but now he had no choice, his heat was approaching and the marriage had to be consummated.
“Help me.” Tony whimpered, doubling over again as the pain returned.
“Because you’re brilliant.”
“Indeed Sir, and as you have said many times in the past. Life is not fair.”
“Ah well…” Tony shrugged, “I’m used to crazy, I’m an old hand at it now.” He grinned at Peter and stretched, cracking his neck which echoed in the quiet of the camp, “And speaking of hands, anyone for poker before bed?”
Good Luck.
“Umm, is it okay if we do?” Peter asked Tony,
“Tones.” Rhodey protested,
“So you are heading to Miami?” Steve asked once Tony paused for breath,
Peter nodded, that made sense. “We’ll also be running more tests to see how else you have been effected. It is possible that this is only temporary, but it might be permanent, we don’t know yet.”
Steve sighed and began to pull away, he knew that there was no point in arguing with Tony when he was in this mood. He also doubted that after the day they'd had that Tony would be feeling overly amorous. However, as he pulled away Tony reached out and stopped him.
“We weren’t putting him in danger.” Ned sobbed, giving up on holding back his tears, his lips wobbled as he looked up and took all of Clint’s strength not to pull the kid into an embrace; all of his parenting instincts were screaming at him to comfort the crying boy, but he knew that both Ned and MJ needed to hear this, needed to learn a harsh lesson so something like this never happened again.
At that moment Steve saw red. It didn’t matter that this wasn’t his world, that this wasn’t his Tony, all he could see was A Tony Stark hurt and in danger, and a threat before him, and he reacted on instinct to defend his man, punching Rogers in the face and sending him across the floor.
The first failed as Tony and Clint glutted themselves on the marzipan and then spent the better part of three hours being sick.
Zach nodded still sniffing and rested his head on Tony’s shoulder his previous enthusiasm gone, “Wanna go home Mamma.” He mumbled.
Steve shook his head and followed after Tony and Peter giving up on sanity.
“Because that’s what relationships are about, Tony.” Pepper said, “In sickness and in health, for better or worse. You support each-other in good and bad times. Not pick and choose; and this isn’t a weakness, this is….just one of natures cruelties, but its one you can get through together if you let Steve in, trust him enough to help you.”
“Whose going to be your best man?” Clint called from the cockpit. “I can make great speeches, and I can take you on an epic stag night.”
Well at least some of the attention was positive if embarrassing, he supposed, he’d rather have people calling him cute than a freak. Although when one person went into graphic detail about what they wanted to do with him in one of his webs, Peter beat a hasty retreat to class. There were some things he just wasn’t ready to hear.
“So, what do you fancy?” Steve asked, “To eat I mean,” At Tony’s snicker he groaned, “Food wise, not… not that!”
“We have our orders, we should follow them.” It sounded lame even to his own ears and Stark certainly wasn’t impressed.
He was uncertain with the team, Pepper, and Rhodey at first. Unsure of how he should be and how they would react to him, but as time passed and they carried on being how they had always been, (Inspirational and academically stimulating, Bruce.) (Annoying and cute. Clint.) (Adorable and fun. Thor.) (Terrifying and amazingly astute, Natasha.) (Impossibly honourable and beyond sexy, Steve.)
There was blood all over his hands. Blood soaked his sleeves all the way to the elbows. It was damp in places but dry in others, cracked and peeling off in flakes that fell to the floor. It was cacked under his nails, thick meaty like rolls were packed beneath the skin and the nail bed.
“So, Hi.” Steve said giving the kids a smile. “I can’t promise that my public speaking will be as entertaining as Tony but..”
Tony was rather concerned over Sam’s mental state when he felt it perfectly safe to flirt with the Black Widow of all creatures, as if he didn’t know that Natasha ate the heads of her victims and crushed testicles and sprinkled them over her cereal at breakfast.
“Yeah, I’m here, I’m real.” Steve assured him, “And I don’t hate you, I’ve never hated you, why would you even think that?”
“Tony explained how Howard was, you don’t need to protect him from me, if he was still alive I’d punch the hell out of him for how he treated Tony.”
“Indeed.” Steve said slapping a hand on Tony’s butt cheeks, “Absolutely everything, it’s like your butt as a weird magnetic force that attracts everything to it and once they are on it they can’t let go.” He squeezed the ample flesh for emphasis making Tony snort.
Nodding his head, Bucky quietly made his way to the living area and sat back down in the same chair, picking up the menu and scouring the breakfast choices. The full English was something he recognized. Eggs, Bacon, Sausage, tomatoes, baked beans, and fried bread. The Cereal choices were new to him beyond the corn flakes. The waffles sounded good, as did the pancakes, the croissants he wasn’t sure about, and he didn’t think he’d get much energy from the fruit salad. The smoked salmon dish made him feel a little queasy, fish wasn’t a breakfast dish as far as he was concerned.
Killian glanced at Tony, “She thinks I don’t know.” He said, “She thinks that I am not already well aware that it is not her that I need to finish this project.” He took a gun from inside his jacket and fired at Maya killing her outright, “It’s you.”
“Why did you even go there?” Sam cried,
Fury also put in requests for everyone else too, giving Maria quite a shopping list of supplies to keep them going for the next few days.
Eight months, Jesus Christ, eight months! Digging the needle in deeper, Tony snarled into the Man’s face, “My baby?”
“Did not, and you’re grounded!”
“If he did that to me I’d have dumped his crazy ass on the ground!” Sam groused as Vision bore Deadpool clinging to his back and carried him to the UN.
“Tin Man.” Hulk bellowed leaping down onto the street to protect Iron Man, snarling at the bots who came close to him.
Zach looked confused again, “Why don’t they just tell each other?”
“Go groom your feathers, fly boy, this a private conversation.”
Once inside Steve locked the door and both he and Tony took off their masks, “Hello Doctor, bet you never thought you’d see me again.”
He snickered at how eagerly Sam bounded up. Poor boy, he was obviously suffering some sort of brain damage, actually enjoying being beaten into the ground by sadistic red head.
It was not what Tony had in mind.
“Why aren’t you in bed?” Peter scolded him, setting aside his pad and saving his homework.
“Great.” Tony murmured, “Now zoom in on the faces of these images, let’s get a close look at them.”
“Right, just like you’ve never seen Titanic, Shakespeare in love, Pretty Woman, or Bridget Jones Diary.” Sam drawled leaning over the back of his seat and grinning at Tony. The Billionaire bristled at him,
Tony Stark Pregnant.
“I do a similar thirty minute run myself.” He said, letting Sam take the bait before adding, “Usually a good twelve to thirteen miles every morning.”
“Thank you Mr Murdoch, Sir.”
“Bitch.” Tony murmured, getting a small smile from Pepper, “They haven’t shown up here, yet, but I suppose it’s only a matter of time. I’ve been having Friday field their calls, I’ll have her do the same for you. That alright baby girl?”
Oh Rogers knew that it was legal now and everyone should be respectful of that. But to him it wasn’t right. Two Men lying together, two women lying together, was against Gods commands. It was unnatural, a perversity, and it turned his stomach to think of a version of himself acting in such a vile manner.
The diseases of Steve’s youth had been all but wiped out, people were immunized against them, there were even treatments for cancer that actually worked, organ transplants, embryos conceived in test tubes and then implanted in wombs.
All in all it was very good night, much better than getting shit faced would have been, and Tony finished up the night in Zach’s room watching him sleep as he sat in the rocking chair, the Milky way reflecting on the walls and ceiling.
“Please don’t, my writing is terrible!”
He made his way over to the bed and reached out to take Tony’s pulse which was when Tony struck.
No, no, no! Why, why did this keep happening, why did Peter keep losing his parents?
“Uh huh, and… you what, want a job?” Tony drawled, “I don’t really have an opening for highly trained assassins. Okay they might be useful when it comes to some business negotiations but most countries frown on using murder as a way to get leverage, they don’t even allow torture or death threats.”
This was nothing, a poxy bit of metal was not going to be the end of Tony Stark.
“Maybe.” Tony said, “We’ll ask him when he comes back.” He leaned down and kissed Zach’s head “Now you go off to sleep, remember you have to be asleep or Santa won’t come.”
“What does this mean for the wedding?” Christine asked, “Will you be going ahead or postponing?”
“Not munchkin.” Zach said with a pout which quickly became a smile as Steve handed him his burger and a carton of fries, he gave Tony his burger and got out his own along with chicken nuggets, fries, and packets of ketchup. He also handed out drinks, a coke for Peter, a coffee for Tony, a vanilla milkshake for Zach and a chocolate shake for himself.
“Its healing well. The doctors think I will have a scar but that it will be very faint.” He replied, “My chest doesn’t hurt anymore either, that finally stopped the night before last.”
On his first day back Steve cooked him his favourite breakfast of French Toast with strawberries, and hot chocolate topped with whipped cream. He’d also packed a lunch for Peter that was designed to help his new caloric needs.
“Its no sweat, the bakery is on my route anyway.” Sam assured him, “I just wanted to let you know as I’ll be gone about an hour or so.”
The bots and Peter helped keep him amused while Tony and Bruce ran tests an simulations. The whole procedure lasted a long weekend in which neither scientist slept until they had a formula to stabilize the extremis. It would allow Zach to keep the ability to produce heat and fire from his hands at will and it also gave him immune system and natural healing abilities a massive boost to the point he would never get sick again and would likely heal from broken bones within hours. But he would not be breathing fire from his mouth or run the risk of exploding with the liquid fire in his veins getting too unstable.
Zach scurried behind some large packing crates and paused to catch his breath before he caught sight of a door, biting down on his bottom lip and ran for the door and stood on his tip toes to get the handle, by luck the door wasn’t locked and he was able to get through to what looked to be where the products were packed up ready for shipping.
“You may not take Mr Stark and Captain Rogers Daughter.” Vision calmly stated, “Hand her over now and your life may yet be spared.”
Natasha scoffed, “Hasn’t this obsession of yours already cause enough harm Stark?” she asked, “This what led to the Ultron disaster is it not?” again Tony flinched at the mention of Ultron and looked away.
“And do you believe your hands to be the right ones to have access to such a weapon?” The French Representative asked, her glasses sliding down her pointed nose as she looked at Tony, who shrugged,
*****
*****
With his expression hardening Tony lifted Lily out of the swing, “Lets get the evacuation in order and alert the teams and UN.”
Choking on laughter, Tony lifted his head and cleared his throat, “Oh Captain please save me, I have no control over my butt, it is constantly demanding attention.”
Peter bit his bottom lip and reached down to rub at his ankle where the spider had bitten him. Ned frowned, “How do you know this?” He asked MJ.
Hearing Zach call him Daddy was still something of a shock to Steve. While he could easily think of Zach as a Son he had never expected for Zach to think of him as a Father.
“No.” Tony said sitting besides him,
Tony grinned, “Sure, you can take it to him at bedtime.” He said kissing Zach’s head.
“Clint can be the talking bird, because there are always talking birds in these kind of stories. Natasha can be the dragon, and Bruce can be the wise old man/wizard who gives you a sword or password, whatever, Thor can be the King/Father/aged knight who bids you go on this quest, Sam can be your Valet/Groom, and Peter and Zach can be the talking rabbits and Squirrel, oh and Dumm-E can be your trust steed.”
Sam made a choked noise, Natasha remained stoic but her hand was poised ready to draw her gun, Steve looked disappointed in Wanda as well as angry with her.
“That’s it Stark you are dead!”
Zach frowned at his snowman, “We got to make more.” He said hurrying to start rolling more snow.
“Get the little bastard!”
“That’s not the point.” Mrs Leeds said, “You acted very irresponsibly, you put Peter at risk which has led to him being seriously hurt along with Mr Stark. What if he had been killed?”
Natasha smirked, “If you believed that you’d have never closed down the weapons manufacturing. What’s wrong Stark, guilty conscience? All that blood on your hands keeping you awake at night?” Her smile became poisonous and vindictive, “Tell me, how do you reconcile the fact you murdered your Sons Father, your own husband?”
Lily’s disgruntled cries grew louder and Steve secured her in his arms, “She’s hungry,” he said, recognizing the pitch she gave when she wanted feeding,
“Fine.” Steve then paused, “Um, I’ve never changed a nappy before.”
“They knew.” He whispered, “Oh my God they knew.”
Smiling, he took Tony’s arm and together with Clint, Natasha, and Bruce, they got into the lift and headed down to the garage where the limo was waiting for them.
Steve ignored the conversation, as did Rhodey, the two of them following Clint and Natasha into the cell.
“It was fine. It was your delicate old man guts that couldn’t handle it!”
“Tony, I don’t know what to say.” Steve said looking around the place, he could feel tears pricking in his eyes. He didn’t deserve this much kindness, Tony had no reason to show him this much generosity.
Stark Tower
“Keep dreaming wings, it’ll be Clint Junior!” Clint said.
Steve’s stomach lurched, treatment, what treatment, Tony wasn’t having any treatment, was he?
“Maybe.”
“What about Peter?” Steve asked, Tony shrugged and shook his head.
“You really will do anything to get a vacation won’t you?” He teased, “Never mind the rest of us working ourselves to the bone while you’re enjoying lay ins and room service, I’ll bet they are even bringing you cocktails on demand.”
Steve’s only answer was a growl of approval and he pulled Tony closer still, not wanting the slightest trace of anothers scent upon his Omega.
“That bird’s much smarter than Uncle Clint.” Tony snorted
Stripping an unconscious man wasn’t easy, but Tony managed it and swiftly pulled on the Doctor’s plain black shirt with the red Hydra logo on the breast which the lab coat had been hiding. It was too tight and didn’t fit over his bump, riding up and leaving part of his belly exposed, the trousers he couldn’t fasten, there was just not enough material to fit around his bump for that to be possible, but he was able to secure them by tearing material from the hospital gown, which he hooped through the button hole and wrapped about the button then tied the two ends tight, leaving some excess material to fall free over his exposed groin.
“We don’t have exact figures but there is something else.” Natasha said, the view changed and a graph of wave lengths appeared. “Jarvis ran scans of the base and the surrounding area and picked up very unusual readings.”
The phone was answered but Natasha didn’t speak, for a moment Steve considered not speaking himself, then figured that if he did so she would hang up and they wouldn’t get anywhere, and Tony had said these phones couldn’t be traced so while he’d be letting potential enemies know he was alive, (Which he probably already knew) he wouldn’t be giving out their location.
“I can live with that.” Steve said shouldering one of the tents.
The pre-teen sat stiffly at his side, chewing on his bottom lip as he watched Steve try to comfort Zach.
Steve couldn’t say he disagreed with Tony’s opinion. He had attended a few dinners like that back in his stage days when his employers had been trying to impress the local mayor or governor, they’d take then out to the fanciest most upscale restaurant in town. Steve would feel so uncomfortable in those places, his shoulders seeming too big and wide for the suits he was forced into and his lack of social graces painfully obvious.
Tony didn’t have time to turn or to move or to do anything before his back was engulfed in pain as Killian set him on fire.
The shock quickly turned to anger and suspicion, that Steve was surprised to see directed at Tony.
“Gay?” Christine repeated, raising her voice enough to be heard over the noise.
“I’m sorry sir, but I have two kids here insisting on speaking with the Avengers about your Son, Peter.” The security guard said, “They say he is in danger.”
Wong and Strange held off Ebony Maw while Tony and Steve fought with Glaive, counting down the minutes until Rhodey fired the weapon vaporizing the ship that they had come in.
Peter had been pretty underwhelmed at the prospect of a trip to Oscorp. He lived in Avenger's Tower for heaven sakes, his family were the Avengers, what could possibly be thrilling for him to see at Norman Osborn's Tower? As far as he was concerned there was no where better than Avengers Tower and his Mamma's lab. Hell Norman Osborn didn't have a DUMM-E, Butterfingers, You, or a Jarvis like Mamma did. Granted that meant there would no toxic smoothies, fire extinguisher being sprayed everywhere, and things blowing up whether they were supposed to or not, but without all that it seemed pretty boring since the teacher said they could only look not touch.
When they stopped to get drinks and take a break, Clint picked up rocks and took aim at the coconuts managing to knock several loose which he put in his backpack for them to break open later.
Spaghetti bolognaise
Since Pepper’s press conference the media had blown up in regards to Peter and Zach being enhanced, so far it seemed that the world was split fifty fifty on who was to blame, with perhaps a little more siding towards pro Stark pro Avengers.
Steve frowned at him, “The serum heals me faster than most humans, I can wait.”
“Your exhibit or the rest of the fossils?”
“You do not feel he is in any way to blame for his Son’s becoming enhanced, even though he decided to publicly promote himself as Iron Man?”
Natasha hissed something vitriolic in Russian at the TV and then scowled as a sticky arrow was fired at the screen courtesy of Clint. The two of them were watched a publicized debate between Pro-Ironman congressman Reynolds and Senator Stern, or Senator Assclown as Tony had called him several years earlier.
“You’re grounded!” Tony called after him only to receive loud laughter for his trouble.
Tony froze and stared at Steve in shock. Red eyes, Wanda’s power. This was her doing.
Steve rose an eyebrow, “Like you told me about the nightmares?”
“As Steve Rogers has strength far greater than that of a normal man, extra measures have to be taken to ensure he gets a good workout. For this the team, and Tony Stark’s family help in this.”
Tony rolled his eyes at Zach’s pouting and puppy dog eyes, cursing the fact he was pushover for his kids pleading and nodded his head. But was rewarded with a huge hug and several kisses from Zach so it was well worth it.
Well that didn’t work, Steve managed to gross himself out but his penis remained stubbornly hard, then Tony shifted and made the problem worse, the Omega was grinding his delectable backside against Steve’s erection providing the most delicious friction.
Harley’s eyes grew inexplicably wider, “I’m cold.” He whined.
This was enough to have Tony launching himself off Steve’s lap and storming through to the other room, where he seized Deadpool by the neck and body slammed him into the wall.
Steve cringed but was saved from speaking when another socialite joined them, a younger woman, but still middle aged and heavily botoxed, so much so that she could hardly move her face at all.
As smartly dressed Pepper in an immaculate white business suit dress arrived along with Rhodey in his dress blues, the two of them took seats on the opposite side of the bed and were soon joined by Steve in crisp suit of his own. Happy had taken the boys out of the hospital and was exploring Prague with them while Tony did this.
“You kids get away from here, I don’t want to have to call the police.” He said to them through the doors.
“It’s alright munchkin.” He tried to reassure her, bouncing her as he’d seen Tony and Steve do, “Nothing’s going to happen to you, I promise.” Supporting her with one arm he reached inside his jacket and pulled out his phone, swiftly dialling Sam’s number.
Pietro would probably argue but it would be easy enough to convince him that she was right, she had done so before and she could do it again, and once they were in America they could take their revenge on Stark, strip his family from him like he’d taken their parents and then, when he was broken and begging, only then would they kill him.
“Oh God, oh no, I’m sorry!” Peter whispered as tears pricked at his eyes. With trembling hands he felt for a pulse in the man’s neck but couldn’t find one. With a couple of tears running down his face Peter gently closed the man’s eyes and made himself step away from the body.
"Very good Mr Stark. Now can you hold out both hands in front of you?"
Fury looked at Natasha and she explained that it had been the Winter Soldier AKA Bucky Barnes who’d attacked him and Tony.
Once everyone was watered and rested they set off again, cutting through the jungle where he grew denser as no footpath had been worn into it. This was great fun for Zach and Peter as they got to climb over trees and roots and help Steve find the way through to the other side of the jungle where they came out on the cliffs again.
“We did.” Tony said, “Thanks to you.”
“Well yeah, but fighting makes great foreplay.”
*****
Shot? But the suit….
“She made you see what honey?” Steve asked, resting his chin over Tony’s head,
“Yeah but Dude, we could be like mega rich, like Jeff Bezzo and Elon Musk rich!”
A late night burger and seeing Peter relaxed and smiling was what Tony needed to soothe his own anxiety. After eating in the lab with Peter and Steve, Tony headed back up to bed and stretched out, watching shamelessly as his naked super soldier came in from the shower.
Wanda wouldn’t have it, she shook her head violently, a mask of hatred twisting her features, “That doesn’t mean he’s innocent.”
“Sorry,” Tony slurred, not really sure why he was apologising, but feeling like he needed to anyway.
“Was is one of the bombs sold by Stane during his reign?” Natasha asked Jarvis,
“Hey, that’s our Deadpool you’re damaging!” Peter yelled shooting web into Cull’s face, as Cull swung at him he webbed himself up onto a passing Leviathan out of reach and cheered as Wasp blasted the chitauri rider off it.
“Clint used it to block the bots when they were throwing plums and peaches.” Natasha informed him, her face and hair were sticky from fruit juice and she had seeds stuck to her chest and sliding down between her breasts.
The side of the Queens World Fair Globe.
She alone stood on Steve’s side, while Natasha and Sam berated him for a fool.
Bending his knees and holding his breath Tony leaped off the catwalk and counted a few seconds in his head before firing the repulsor at the ground, clearing debris and breaking his fall as the blast shot his body back up once he was ten feet off the ground, so when he did hit the ground it was not as deadly a fall as it would otherwise have been. That wasn’t to say it didn’t hurt, because it did and Tony felt his shoulder dislocate as he rolled over on it, getting himself to his feet running for the exit as fast as he could.
“Can we watch Dr Who?” Zach asked, his head resting on Tony’s chest.
Steve growled and clenched his fists, he swore he would wring that bitches neck himself for what she was doing to Tony.
“Tony…Peter and Tony, Jarvis are they okay?” Steve asked tapping his ear piece. He met Natasha’s eyes worriedly, she was battered and bruised, had a bloody wound on her forehead and soot smudged beneath her nose.
The two of them had been talking well into the night, comparing the differences between Steve’s world and this one. Apparently it hadn’t been the Avengers who had found him and thawed him out in this world, it had been Shield, and for a time this worlds Steve Rogers had worked for Shield, which, had been infested by Hydra. He and the Black Widow had taken down Hydra, but also destroyed Shield in the process and compromised America’s national security.
“Uncomplicate it, jackass.” Tony barked.
“Nope.” Peter replied popping the P. “I wonder how much I can lift, how much can you lift?”
Steve smirked at him and took a very long and slow drink of his coffee, “Hmm a fine rich roast.” He purred, “Strong and smooth, just what you need to wake you up in the morning.”
“But if I had lived a better life, not drowned myself in alcohol and drugs I’d have spotted Stane’s treachery sooner and never ended up needing the arc reactor or getting palladium poisoning.”
“If we are to agree to such a Weapon, Mr Stark, then you may not be the one to have control of the weapon as you say.” The English Representative said, “It would be far more likely that the codes for such a device would held by the United Nations.”
Both in his dream and his physical body, Tony let out a moan, in his dream he was on his knees on the barren ground, clutching fistfuls of ash, the ash that used to be his son.
“Flash.” Peter corrected his lips twitching over Tony calling Flash Trash. “And no, I erm, it was me, I hit Harry, a lot. I hit him a lot and he’s in hospital.” That was the worst part, he’d hit Harry so badly he'd given him a concussion and Harry had been taken to hospital to be checked out. He almost certainly had a broken nose and might have worse injuries.
When his eyes focused he made out the sight of a hospital room and a police officer on the door, the officer noted his return to consciousness and alerted the nurses, within moments a team was around him, checking his pupils, asking him his name, date of birth, and other questions.
“I’ll explain later,” if there is a later, “Just do as I said and get as far away from the city as you can.”
“Very well, thank you, Captain, and its Pepper,”
He would stumble about like that for a while, then he would come across them, one by one. Hawkeye, Clint with his arms wrenched from the sockets and his eyes torn from his head laying in a pool of his own blood, his wife and children besides him, broken, bloody, and dead.
Leap out of the vents to try and scare the camera crew, Yes Clint, that means you.
“No just scare him shitless.” The detective said dropping all act of professionalism, he rubbed his face, “As a cop I can’t do this.” He said, “But, as a private citizen when I am off duty at six pm tonight, I could not stop you visiting the hospital, or room 207 on floor five and speaking with the individual in there.”
It seemed to take him an age to get across the floor to the door but he reached it eventually and tried the handle, it was locked of course, this was no hospital, they’d have no reason to lock him in a room.
“That’s not true!” Harry cried.
“How did you get here?” Steve demanded as he walked around.
The three of them sat in silence until Zach’s tears had subsided, to Steve’s distress it was because Zach had thoroughly exhausted himself crying and had finally fallen asleep. He felt like a complete failure as a parent, having not been able to stop Zach’s tears or do anything other than to hold him while he cried himself out.
He figured he’d be doing it up until heat-secession.
“My pleasure.” And Steve did proceed to just that, making sure Tony was far beyond words for the rest of the night and most of the following morning.
The baby moved and Tony grinned as he felt a tiny foot pushing against his hand, “Doesn’t matter, I’ll know what to call you when I see you. Until then, how does Poppet sound?” He felt a kick and decided to take it as agreement.
The food was excellent and conversation flowed easily, over a variety of topics; they managed to keep away from talking shop, neither of them wanted to speak about Hydra while on a date as that would truly destroy the mood.
“Zach.” Tony said not looking up from tracing Zach’s face with his fingers, “Zachary Yinsen Stark.” He smiled down at his Son, staring into baby blue eyes, “We are going to have so much fun together as you grown up, I’m going to teach you so much about the world and how everything works, and I’m going to teach you how to speak, how to walk, and I’ll play with you everyday, we’ll go on camping trips, beach trips, horse riding, rock climbing, I’ll even take you flying one day, when you’re bigger. I’ll make you a special suit and harness so you can fly with me.” He lifted Zach up and kissed his forehead. “It’s going to be perfect, I promise.”
Steve coughed and choked on smoke and brick dust, his back hurt and his arm was twisted painfully over his head, the Shield over the top of him with a heavy weight on top of it. Beneath him Tony was coughing and spluttering too but very much alive to Steve’s relief.
I must follow Miss Potts orders, AKA The Boss Lady and voice of God.
He’d been certain nothing could compare with that, nothing could faze him anymore, not until Jarvis called over the com in what Steve could only describe as a chillingly frightened tone.
“Those are rare.” Tony pointed out, “And I am unlikely to conceive multiples.”
“Are you sure you want to risk having another one?” Steve asked. He and Tony were considering asking Pepper to surrogate for them so they could give Lily a sibling. “Keep her out of trouble is a job and half as it is.”
“The asswipe douchebag who bullies you at school.”
“Umm, no but.., I’ve never held a baby,” Tony admitted, looking at Lily like she might break if he touched her. Carefully he took her into his arms, holding her with fear of dropping or damaging her somehow. “Uh, hi Lily, I’m Tony,” he stammered at the baby girl, who cooed at him, reaching out with a chubby hand to tug on his goatee, “Okay, oww, no beard pulling,” he complained, balancing her on one arm and taking her tiny hand into his own, surprised by the grip she had when she latched onto his fingers, “You’re strong aren’t you, little one?” he said, grinning at her, “I’ll bet you’re going to be a terror when you start walking,”
*****
“Smooching again!” Zach laughed,
“You have my word.” She promised.
Along the way Steve and Peter got into a conversation about the possibility of their being able to catch one of the trout that were in the lake or one of the other fish there and having it for dinner. Tony doubted that they’d be able to since they didn’t have any fishing gear and would have to either make spears out of branches or try with their bare hands, neither of which would be easy.
Tony sighed, couldn’t he get a moment of peace?
“Peter says that they fluff wit’ each-other but don’t tell each-other that they like them like that. Why is that?” Zach asked frowning in the most adorable way, “And when I asked Mamma if Steef will be my Daddy if they get married he said that it wouldn’t happen, but it has to happen! If people like each-other they get married, like Roary and Amy, and River and the Doctor, so Mamma and Steef have to get married.”
Tony snuggled into Steve, letting himself be lifted up into Steve’s powerful arms and carried across his lab to the couch, where Steve sat, with Tony cradled on his lap and in his arms, slowly crying himself out.
New York
They waited, Steve counted the seconds in his head, counted each moment until Jarvis replied.
“Then again, the mental age of some of our team mates might be just around Zach’s age.” Tony drawled, making Steve chuckle and pull him into a kiss; neither of them aware of the spectators in the Sky scrapper opposite them, taking pictures on their phone.
Steve shook his head, trying not to think about the needless expense that was probably pocket money to a Billionaire.
“Yup MJ’s getting a five minute head start, three and half minutes now.”
“You do?”
“Which you are doing at six am.” Tony sighed, he freed one arm and ran a hand over his face.
He thought back, trying to push away the thoughts of his nightmare, but that had been going on for so long, had been replaying in his mind since….the base, Struckers base. Yes, he’d been in Struckers base and he’d been…., hurt, he remembered pain, remembered blood, he’d been hurt, he’d been shot.
“Oh, and what’s that, Precious?”
“Eugene?” Tony asked.
“Oh.” Natasha said sounding disappointed, “I’ll have to try harder next time.”
“Mamma!” Zach cried out choking on a sob, he coughed and spluttered, gulping in air far too fast. Tears were rolling down his cheeks and evaporating on his skin which was turning red and blistered as the heat seeped out of his body.
“Not until you tell me what’s wrong.”
Bucky snatched his arm back from Deadpool with growl, “Touch it and die!” This did not have the desired effect as Deadpool placed his hands over his heart and fell back against the couch cushions with a dramatic exhale and threw his legs obscenely wide,
When they had been ten Sokovia had been in the grips of a civil war that had torn the country apart. A bomb which had been bearing Stark's name had dropped onto their house killing their parents. The twins had been burried in the rubble for two days staring at the name Stark and developing a natural hatred for the name and the man it reprisented.
The host was a young bubbly blonde woman who seemed to have a permanent smile on her face and had a rather high pitched giggle that she used frequently. She was joined with a camera man and sound tech who seemed friendly enough as they were introduced to the team.
With food and drink packed up, sunscreen plastered on, and comfortable footwear adorned, the team set off to hike around the Island.
“Indeed.” Jarvis agreed, “It may be prudent for you to practise the movements with the braces outside of the suit before adding them to the interior.”
As the reception drew to a close, Tony took Peter through to the living room and collapsed on the couch with him. Zach was in Malibu with Happy and Pepper. Tony hadn’t wanted him at the funeral, he was too young to understand and Tony hadn’t wanted him to start crying during the service, he’d also wanted to be able to devote his attention to Peter as this was a very difficult day for him.
“Do you want to be worrying about flower arrangements, ordering food, drink, the cake, bands, photographers, table arrangements, and a dozen other things, or just hire someone to worry about it for us?”
“He seemed like a good man.”
“You wouldn’t!”
A knock came at the door and he swore, “I’m not hungry, leave me the fuck alone.”
“Such a vicious woman.” Tony mused, shifting Zach’s weight, “Now, introductions before we eat. Zach, Peter, these are, Natasha Romanoff AKA Black Widow, Clint Barton AKA Hawkeye, Bruce Banner AKA Hulk, Thor of Asgard, and Steve Rogers AKA Captain America. Guys, these are my Sons, Peter and Zach.”
“I shall endeavour not to.” Jarvis said, “Even if said family comes with three misbehaving little brothers.” He of course meant Dumm-E, You, and Butterfingers whom Friday was having the joy of taming in Tony and his absences.
“Now, do you two want to practise your German?” Tony asked Zach and Peter, he was teaching them both German, he was also teaching them Italian, French, and Spanish, but he suggested German as Steve was reasonably fluent and could join in the lesson.
“Fiction written about fictional or even real people, it’s posted at online websites, they aren’t making any profit from it so they can’t be charge with plagiarism.” Tony explained, “There are even some fics written about me out there. I’ve been paired with Rhodey and with Pepper, they’ve even had us in threesums!” He shot a glance up at Steve, “There are even some about you, you are slashed with Bucky mostly, but sometimes with Howard which grosses me out in so many ways, a couple even have the entire Howling Commandos having an orgy!”
“Thank’s Tobes.” Tony said, setting it down on a plate, “If only I’d AI’d the oven too….”
"Then that concludes these stupid investigations."
Healthy was not enough.
Right there, in front of half the worlds press, was his “Twin” declaring himself homosexual as if it were something to be proud of!
“I knew that Iron Member needed help. My Spidey senses were tingling!” Peter looked affronted at this,
“No I’m not.” Tony said, getting up from the bed, “If I was Peter wouldn’t be struggling like this.” He bent a grabbed a T-Shirt off the floor and a pair of jeans. “I’m going to the lab.” He said pulling on the clothes, “I need to do something.”
Tony wrinkled his nose, “Reed Richards is such a dick though, and Spider-Man has only just started to web the streets of New York,”
“Right I’m not.” Peter agreed thankful there was someone on his side even if it was a vicious teenage girl who was terrifying, maybe she was taking lessons of Natasha….
“I was trying to part my legs.” Tony said bitterly,
Steve had been sketching when the phone had rung, he’d taken the call, saving Jarvis from having to do so and wasn’t surprised when the woman on the Phone had asked for Tony. While people thought of the Tower as Avengers Tower, it was really Tony’s Tower.
“I’ll get him out of the hospital.” Thor said, he alone could approach Zach and withstand the heat coming from the Pup. Steve grabbed the Gods arm,
“I don’t need protection!” Tony protested.
He was also warned about a possibility of bedsores on Tony’s thighs and buttocks, if he suspected that a sore might be forming he was to inform Tony’s GP right away and begin treatment, they couldn’t afford for an ulcer to form which it too easily could.
Steve gave her a grateful smile, "Thank you." He said loosening his grip on Tony just a little. The receptionist sighed heavily and shoved a pair of glasses onto her face and began to type onto her keyboard.
Pepper, Rhodey, and Happy arrived at the Tower for Christmas, and there was also the annual Stark Christmas Party which everyone attended.
“Maybe we can work something out.” He said looking up at the others and found himself smiling at the hope that bloomed on Steve’s face. “I’ll get my lawyers on it, let the overpaid bastards work for their money for once.”
While Tony and Zach were getting cleaned up, Steve got the bed ready for them, plumping up the pillows and rolling back the bed covers, brewing tea and getting some hot chocolate for Zach. Peter brought a tablet through to the bedroom along with a pack of playing cards, and a box of cookies to snack on.
“Oh.” Steve managed to cover it but couldn’t help but feel elated at Tony’s admission. He’d always thought the Billionaire was off limits because of his relationship with Pepper, but now he was single which meant there was no reason that Steve couldn’t pursue him. Well, none but Tony’s health, which clearly needed addressing.
“Of course.” Steve ground out finding it difficult to feel pity for the woman who had allowed Howard to neglect and abuse her own child. Were he feeling kinder, then he could have reasoned that her spirit had been broken by Howard, by the loss of the Pups and babies before Tony’s birth, that by the time her only living Pup had come into the world she had become too desolate in her heart to find the strength in herself to fight for her Son. But right now Tony was his only concern, not a woman he had never met and would never meet.
“I know, I know its going to be alright.” Pepper said “I know you’ll get through this, I just hate seeing you hurt.” She squeezed him tighter and let out a couple more sobs before she got control of herself and stood up, wiping her face. Tony kept hold of one of her hands and squeezed it smiling at her.
Several minutes passed until Tony’s breathing was suitably under control and he was able to speak to Steve again.
Steve had his back to the camera and was concentrating on making breakfast, while Tony negotiated with Zach, convincing the stubborn four-year-old to eat porridge and blueberries rather than blueberry pancakes.
There may not be anymore updates on my stories for a couple of weeks as I am moving to a new flat and things are rather hectic right now. I'll try and get some updates out but I can't make any promises. I am not abandoning any of my fics though this will just be a short leave of absense while I deal with real life.
“Friend Darcy wished to try Asgardian Mead and my dearest Jane had a glass too. It made them both very merry and they wished to give me a makeover.” Thor replied. Spying Clint’s breakfast he slapped the archer on the back almost hard enough to knock him right through the table, “Friend Hawk, soon you will be the size of Volstagg!”
“Um, yeah, I guess.” Tony murmured, he knew vaguely of Alpha courting, but he had never experienced it himself, he’d been married off to Obie, there had been no need for Obie to woo him as the contract had been signed and sealed already.
“So, we could have an Andrew Morgan, or a Morgan Hannah.” Steve said,
“Oh hell no, I’m not getting up at the arse crack of dawn to pound the pavement. I had enough of ungodly wake up calls when Zach was a baby to last me a lifetime.”
“You are not beating him.” She growled, “Leave him be.” Her eyes flashed dangerously at him and the man grumbled, letting his arm drop.
Once more, as Natasha went to interrogate Loki, and Thor spoke the Coulson, Steve was left feeling like a spare part, which was how he came to wander into the labs in time to see Stark jabbing Banner in the side with something that made the other scientist yelp.
It was after one such nightmare and Tony was staggering to the kitchen to get a cup of peppermint tea to try and clear his head that he ran into Captain America, or rather Steve Roger’s looking as haunted as Tony felt.
“Dude, it is so cool Mr Stark and Captain America are letting us stay in the tower. I mean wow, two whole nights at Avengers tower with the avengers!” Ned had been tripping out over getting to stay at Avengers tower since Peter had suggested it and his parents had agreed.
Steve had to proceed with caution and try to keep Tony calm. “No one is going to get me, honey.” He said, giving Tony a reassuring smile, “I’m only going next door to get you some ice, I’ll only be a second or two.”
“This is urgent.” Phil Coulson said.
“That’s enough!” Maya Hanson suddenly shouted, “Let him go.”
*****
Security guards, probably armed and ready to kill anyone trespassing.
“So.” Tony said back reaching out to tangle his fingers with Steve’s
Tony hummed. He knew Steve was right he couldn't argue with the logic, but he also couldn't quite forgive himself for upsetting Zach and Peter. He hated seeing his boys upset and hated even more being the cause for their distress. "I've got to get this sorted." He said in a flat tone. "As soon as we get back to New York I'm starting therapy and I am going to get this under control, so that the next time I get soaked I don't freak the fuck out."
“And that’s the downside to kids,” Tony said rolling his eyes, “They kill the mood completely.” He got up from the bed and grabbed his dressing gown, belting it about his waist and waited for Steve to cover his modesty before he opened the door and let Zach in.
“I have, Tony’s crippled, Zach’s gone, I can’t do anything!”
Tony looked to Steve, an alarmed look on his face, “Dear God he actually gets worse. I hate you right now.”
The smile on Tony’s mouth didn’t falter as he met her gaze, “By my own hand with intent, probably around two dozen. But to be fair, they were terrorists, they deserved to be burned to death and blown up. As for my being responsible for the deaths my weapons caused, well, a weapon cannot fire itself, a gun, a missile, hell, even a knife cannot act independently, it takes human intervention and intent to take lives, without that, those weapons are nothing but inanimate lumps of metal.”
“On it Boss,” Friday replied, moments later the gauntlets were on his hands, the chest plate was closing around his torso and the boots were enclosing his feet. The helmet had just come down over his head when a figure came through the portal, shocking Tony into freezing on the spot.
“It’s okay. I understand.” Steve said stoking his wet fingers up and down Tony’s arm. “I don’t like it, but I understand.”
“And you, you are encouraging this behaviour.” Tony said pointing at Peter, “You are encouraging him to keep soaking me in this crap.” He ran a hand through his soaked hair and glared at the foam that came out. “This is my fate isn’t it? I am going to die in this lab being suffocated in flame retardant fired at me by my demented bott while my eldest runs about shooting webs at everything.”
Blow them in the water the others had moved back to the edge to give Clint space.
“I’m afraid times up for tonight. Or rather this morning.” The Doctor said having the decency to sound regretful, “You can come back later on this afternoon. Visiting hours are between two and five pm.”
“Good, because I don’t want till jumping up and down at midnight.” As he said this Tony was munching on a donut, the sugar getting all over his beard and moustache. Steve snickered,
“Because it generally is your fault.” Rogers spat contemptuously, “Ultron…”
Was this an out of body experience?
“Shush, you’re not traumatizing them, you are protecting them, protecting the world. You are making them very proud of you,” Steve lifted Tony’s chin so the Omega was looking up at him, “You are not to blame for any of this, this is all on Killian and his insanity, please don’t blame yourself because of him.”
“In your perverted dreams, Stark.” Sam groused, “Door Matt here ain’t my type!”
The very inappropriate question came of course from Deadpool, who was lounging across the sofa talking to an uncomfortable looking spider-man.
He still wasn’t clear on who this Bucky was, or who this blonde with the shield was, although the shield seemed familiar somehow, as did the outfit the blonde wore, but something about the outfit didn’t seem right, it wasn’t bright enough, or shiny enough.
“Always.” Tony said and snuggled right up to Steve, laying his head on the super soldiers chest. “Thanks for taking Pete out, it really helped calm him down and cheer him up.”
Flustered and fumbling, the Principal rose and went to Tony asking if he was alright and if he needed anything.
“Baby sitting,” Clint replied, glancing at Rogers before looking back to the infant and bopping her on the head with the teddy bear he was waving over her head. She let out a shriek of laughter and made grabby hands for the toy. “Oh you want bear, you want bear do you? Well you’ve got to do better than that!” he bopped her on the head with the bear again and lifted it just out of reach, teasing her and making the infant squirm and giggle until he finally let her have the bear, which she promptly began to chew on!
When Tony gave her the nod, Pepper stepped forward and brought the conference to a close, answering a few questions for them about SI before she too departed for her office.
“Are you alright?” Steve cried, fearing for the Billionaires health. He knew that his Tony had a serious heart condition, it was probable that this Tony did too, though he did not appear to have the arc reactor in his chest.
“Well he’s my Stellina.” Tony said, his cheeks flushing slightly.
“Stay with him.” Tony said, “Tell him I’m sorry and I’ll see him soon with Zach. But aside from him and the team, don’t tell anyone I’m alive. Let the world think I’m dead for a while, if no one is looking for me I can move undetected, that’ll give me an edge going after this bastard.”
*****
“Maybe we should think up a name for you, hmm?” he asked stroking the bump, “I don’t know if you are a boy or a girl so I think a unisex name would be best. Max, Aiden, Taylor, Spencer, Jamie, Riley, Dylan, Morgan, Jordan, Alexis, Theo. Damn, there’s just so many to choose from isn’t there?”
While Steve got breakfast ready, Tony took Zach and Peter to do their business in the woods and then made sure that Zach washed up properly afterwards. Peter was old enough to do this without prompting, but Zach still forgot hygiene when he was distracted or over excited.
A Fiancé
“Yeah, okay, how about the Smithsonian?” Steve suggested,
As Tony continued to whisper to Peter, Steve turned and glared at the night staff as a syringe of sedatives was brought, “You are not giving him that.” He growled, “If you want to do something, go and get the discharge papers, Peter is coming home with us.”
“Her testimony?” Steve asked.
“You won’t get my baby.” Tony panted, writhing on the bed in complete agony, “I won’t let you take my baby.”
Steve wanted to comfort him, to tell him that Sharon was wrong in saying what she did but his mind was reeling over her having been spying on him, the fact she was Peggy’s niece, and the painful reminder of Peggy’s wandering fragmented mind.
“Yes, Jarvis, what is it?” He asked.
“Wha…,” Peter looked around helplessly, thankfully Tony was close by and lifted Zach up, balancing him on his hip while he read the paper, rolling his eyes. Peter saw him say something to Zach and ruffle his hair before setting him down on his feet so he could run over to Steve, who lifted him up onto his lap so they could draw together.
Steve grinned, “Thank you Colonel, I promise I won’t take advantage of your trust.”
“Wait a minute…” Steve begged trying to take hold of Tony and make him see reason, but the genius wasn’t listening and piece by piece the suit began to appear, “At least wait for back up….” Steve trailed off as Tony fired the repulsors and sped off out of the Tower and up into the sky.
Cull roared and flailed, vomiting blood that seeped through the web mask, from behind Deapool rammed his katanas into Cull as hard as he could, pushing his full weight behind them, skewering Cull on all three blades and holding him there until they were sure he was dead.
“Uh, Winter?” Rhodey asked, confused by the mention of a third party, “Who..” He broke off at the sound of police sirens which suddenly pierced the air. Tony groaned and rolled his eyes while Bucky tensed.
He was learning to distinguish scents from people, MJ always smelled of vanilla from her perfume, and a sweet scent that was unique just to her. He couldn’t really describe the scent beyond sweet, it wasn’t like honey or chocolate or cake, it just smelled sweet.
“Oh yay think?” Sam asked as he swept past Clint and swept up four soldiers took them up to about ten feet and then dropped them back down.
“My Pleasure Friday.”
“Hey!” Steve laughed, “I’ll have you over my knee if you do that again!”
“Umm, I forgot.” Clint said unhelpful as ever,
Tony had been heart broken when Peter had died, it had taken Steve over an hour to pry Tony’s arms from Peter’s body, the Billionaire just hadn’t been able to let him go.
“I know you are not the Tony I had in my universe. While there are similarities between you, I can also see the differences and I assure you, Anthony Gregory Stark…”
“We’ll see Mamma later honey.” Steve said hating himself as he further distressed Zach by turning and carrying him out of the hospital room, resulting in Zach screaming like he was being murdered.
“Alright,” Steve agreed, frowning at the tremor in Tony’s hands as they gripped the wheel. There was not much he could do to repay Tony’s generosity and kindness to him, but he could look out for him, keep those sorry excuses for Avengers from hurting him anymore than they already had, and he made a promise to himself, to his lost husband, that he would do so.
“What?” That didn’t make sense to Steve, he’d read the file, the report on Vanko and the dead CEO Hammer, they’d been the ones responsible for the disaster at the Expo, not Tony. The file had also contained the true account of what had happened with Stane, not the one that the public had been informed of. How Tony would handle telling Zach about his Father, Steve didn’t know, he certainly didn’t envy Tony the task of telling the little boy that his Father had been a murderer, had tried to kill Tony while he’d been pregnant with Zach.
“Someone must have recognized him.” He sighed, handing Lily to Steve and stepped forward towards Bucky, his hands held palms up to show he wasn’t a threat.
Ignoring them, Tony made his way across the room to the opposite door, finding his way into the lockers and changing rooms.
“Uncle Bruce what’s this?” Zach called pointing in the water, “Is it another crab?”
The day started out perfectly well, almost normal, or what passed as normal in a tower occupied by Norse Gods, rages monsters, homicidal assassins, demented archers, spider mutants, fire mutants, super soldiers, super soldier groupies, and slightly deranged geniuses.
"Peter Benjamin Parker Stark. August 10th 2000." Tony recited. The receptionist typed the information into the computer and then tapped her electric blue nails on the keyboard as she waited for the results.
“Tell that to every battered woman, Omega, and child.” Steve coldly stated.
“Full access to all information on anyone and everyone at any moment of the day, three full battle-ready ships air born over major cities. It isn’t just security cameras or remote surveillance of hostiles. This normal everyday people having their entire lives documented and recorded.”
“Exo-program.” Tony said, “He flew the falcon wings, I’ve got Jarvis searching for whatever silo they’ve been dumped in, once he finds them we can go and liberate them from mothballs and we’ll have some air born back up.”
“Murderer.”
“You are incorrigible, Mr Stark.”
“And human experiments would still be going on.” Tony said, “While ill-advised, what you have done is expose horrific acts of criminal behaviour.”
Keep his hand firm on the bullet hole in Tony’s back, Steve leant down so he could see Tony’s face that was half hidden between his shoulder and the floor. Even in the poor light Steve could see how pale Tony was, he could see a darkening around his eyes and mostly alarmingly the blood that was spilling out of Tony’s mouth as he took shallow breaths with painful effort.
Now though, Zach was getting older, he needed more activity, more to occupy his growing mind and help him develop. Tony could keep him entertained with colouring books, children’s stories, and toys for now, but that wouldn’t last forever, Zach was growing more energetic and adventurous by the day, he’d already climbed over the gates in the play pen twice, giving Tony a heart attack. Thankfully Jarvis had alerted him the second he’d done so, so Zach hadn’t gotten anywhere near the equipment in the lab which he could have seriously hurt himself with, but it had shown that Zach was getting bored, the play pen wasn’t enough for him anymore and the Lab was no place for a Pup that young.
“We can also get help from an ex-air force Sergeant.” Steve offered, “He was part of the uh..”
“You are welcome Mr Stark.” The detective said rising up and holding out his hand for Tony and Steve to shake, “I hope Doctor Curien has a much less pleasant night than my own.”
“Oh, one time, I keep you waiting one time…”
“I cannot guess the inner workings of Sirs mind, but I believe he simply did not wish to worry anyone unnecessarily.” Jarvis said, “This project was a last resort, only to be activated if his death was imminent or his injuries were to be considered life changing.” The red faced head tilted to the side and Jarvis regarded the team, “I am to assume that Sir’s condition is severe?”
“I am sorry Mr Stark, but Colonel Rhodes asked that I intervene and prevent you from doing something you will regret.” Vision said, sounding apologetic.
I'm back!
“Yeah, you and me can run through the City and Peter can capture us.” MJ typed.
“A few more meals like that and you might not look like a puff of wind could blow you away!” Steve teased, as the coffee and port or brandy was served, along with after dinner mints and truffles.
Thing had just gotten worse from there.
Steve remembered hearing something about people who were always making jokes or being constantly loud and larger than life. That they were horribly insecure about themselves and were making the jokes first, speaking first and drowning everyone else out so that no one could get the chance to start tearing strips off them.
“Pleasure Sir.”
“You’re insane if you think bringing that nut job into a team is a good idea, besides, he’s already turned down the X-Men. Called Colossus a cock gobbler, among other things!”
“Considering the appetites of our team I’m thinking a seven tier cake minimum.” Tony said looking over some very elaborate and decorative cakes smothered in icing, marzipan, cream cheese, and chocolate.
“You have to admit, it does have style.”
“Go to hell!” Tony screamed and clenched his fists as the next contraction came. He wanted to stop this, wanted to keep the baby inside him where it was safe, but he couldn’t, his body was ready to deliver, the baby was ready to come into the world, there was no stopping it.
“Because people are going to be giving you serious shit of it, Man,” Sam said, “All of the pro-gay and gay rights activists will be campaigning against you,”
Tony Stark.
“How can I not? I’m just being patriotic.”
“Thor, Sam, and Clint had a battle.” Zach said, “Thor won and now we’re gonna make sand castles.”
He gave up trying to appear brave, gave up trying to hide his fear, he tipped his head and screamed for Tony, for Steve, for all of the Avengers to come and save him.
“Hey you go champ.” Steve said placing a straw against Peter’s mouth so he drink water from a plastic cup, “Slowly now, don’t choke.”
Tony and Bruce took batteries of bloods, urine, faeces, hair, and skin samples to test, looking at everything that could be looked at while scanning Peter multiple times and having him do certain things for them so they could measure his heartrate at rest and during activity, his breathing, and how quick his recovery time was.
Jarvis was less trusting now, was more guarded of his maker, never again wanting to come close to losing him. He also took greater care over his makers mental health as well as his physical health.
“Sokovia.” Natasha said as Jarvis centred in on a small country, “Formally part of the Soviet Union. When the union fell it got independence and has been through several civil wars since then, one of which is still on going, the country’s government is shaky at best and just barely holding onto power. The rebel cells are thinning but the war is also being fuelled by Hydra.”
“Whoa.” Tony cried and Steve looked shocked, “That little shit hit MJ?”
“I never fart, or burp, its undignified.” Tony lied making Steve laugh again, since spicy food made Tony do both. The laughter however eased the tension and they relaxed, settling down in the bed and as he rolled over onto his side Tony couldn’t help but to smile as he felt the reassuring warmth of Steve against his back, the Alpha feeling much the same about the presence of Tony’s body close besides him, well within reach so he could protect him if the need arose.
“Howard Stark had something in the boot of his car that night which Hydra wanted, so, one of our most useful assets was deployed to retrieve it and eliminate all witnesses.”
“You okay?” Steve asked worriedly,
“Are you okay?” Steve asked, his powerful arms circling the Omega protectively.
The armour was like Tony’s suits but had a solid core instead of a hollow space for a person to be enveloped in. It was dark red and silver, colours that Jarvis himself had chosen and the face plate, rather than the typical Iron Man mask, was moulded to appear like a human face.
“Make that two.” Steve added, the waitress took a note on her pad and left them to get the drinks order.
Fury waved him off, “At least you’re more polite than Stark.” He grunted, which Tony ignored.
“We will do our best.” The consultant said as they approached the lift, “I’m afraid you’ll have to wait up here or take the stairs down there isn’t room for everyone.”
“Oh God!” Steve chocked out, his cheeks turning an interesting shade, “And slash?”
“Noted Bossman.” Friday chirruped,
Had he not been feeling so crappy Tony would have laughed at Jarvis’ snark, but he felt too tired and achy, that was another two things, aching and feeling tired. Just as he had in the early months of his pregnancy with Zach. Damn Hormones.
Just as dawn was starting to break, the sky turning pink with streaks of orange as the sun just crested over the city, Bruce wheeled Tony into Peter’s room.
“I cannot fathom Sir.”
“Are there any places to dive here?” Clint asked Tony, looking at him over his purple sunglasses.
Steve kept the fact he was doing an interview a secret from Tony because he knew that the Omega would try to talk him out of it or insist on joining him.
“You haven’t caught me yet!” MJ shot back.
The story Tony had told of the bomb being a Vietnam era bomb had been proven true, the media had looked into it and confirmed it, to the point where no one could deny the claim factual, no one but Wanda who was still adamant that it was Tony who was responsible.
Giving up on sleep the Billionaire had gone outside of the tent and lain down on the sand to watch the stars. At some point however he must have fallen asleep because the next time he became aware his face was warm from sunlight, there was the smell of something delicious nearby along with the siren scent of coffee, and the worrying giggles of his Sons.
“Howard Stark was a good man, a lot better than his Son. Don’t you dare judge him for Tony’s actions.” Wanda glared back,
Peter made himself keep going, past the cages and towards the tanks where he found creatures that belonged in horror movies.
“We could do an interview if you want.” Tony said, “I’ve received offers from various magazines wanting to do one with us.”
“Now you wait a minute…” Rogers began, but Steve wasn’t done,
Nodding his head and taking a deep but regretful breath Steve moved back, away from Tony. “I understand.” He said, as he slid out from between Tony’s thighs, leaving the Billionaire feeling bereft and exposed in more ways than one. “After what you’ve just been through I should have known better than to do anything. You need comfort and support. Its natural and I understand and I promise I don’t hold it against you.”
He had built them a fire which had provided some warmth but that was now burned low, there were only a few embers left and the air was cold.
“Is a homosexual pairing, femslash is two females.” Tony grinned, “When we get home I’ll show you some of the fics that have started to be written about the team. Bruce and I seem to be one of the most popular pairings, we are Sciencehusbands according to the internet, where you and I are Superhusbands.”
“They are, their parents have taken them home.” Steve said, “They came to the tower and told us everything.” He sighed heavily, “You should have told us what you were doing Peter, we came really close to losing you.”
Everyone ran over to where he was standing, a flank of gold and red armour could be seen at his feet peaking out from the debris.
“I’m gonna see Osborn burning on pyre for this shit.” Natasha growled observing as the mangled, mutilated bodies were taken away.
“Captain Roger’s, Mr Osborn, please, this is getting us nowhere.” The Principal said, alarm in his eyes. If a fight were to occur then a Norman would clearly come off worse, but he didn’t want a fight to break out in his school.
“I’m not saying your shouldn’t pull all nighters, big guy, what I am saying is, you should invite me to them. We can have an epic science night, you, me, and some sensitive equipment.” Tony wriggled his eyebrows suggestively, making Bruce scoff and roll his eyes.
Tony managed a weak smile that didn’t reach his eyes, nothing about this situation was going to be an easy fix, himself especially and he wasn’t sure he even deserved to be fixed.
A scaly monster that looked like it had been cross bred with a Komodo dragon and an alligator snapped vicious jaws at him and watching him with evil eyes.
“No one, not the full details, if you don’t include the team and family.” Steve said, “There has been a press release by Pepper, but it only said you were seriously injured not what your injuries were.”
“Yes, but you’ve been scientifically cheating on me with Dr Banner, schmoozing and handling equipment!”
“Maybe I will!” Steve said and suddenly dipped Tony, making the smaller man yelp in surprise and then giggle, as he held Steve tighter to support himself,
The idiot sighed, “My name is Trevor, Trevor Slattery.”
“I think that is human nature.” Steve said, “We focus on what is closest to us, what matters most to us and ensure the safety of our family, friends, and our own well being before we look to the care of strangers.”
So he passed Zach to Pepper when he decided to step out and get some air, which was when the thought struck him…
“But I’m hungweey!” Zach whined, kicking his legs into the mattress, “Please Mamma, PLEEEEEAAAASE!”
“Oh come now FRI, don’t you want a little sister to play with?”
“Tony?” Steve whispered not wanting him to startle him. His heart was pounding and his palms were sweating with fear for Tony’s life. One wrong move here and Tony would plummet to his death.
“What would you know?” Wanda screamed at him, “You, a privileged American, you don’t know what it is to be orphaned, to have nothing. So what if we joined Hydra? We thought it was Shield at first but it didn’t matter. The world and Stark had taken everything from us, so why shouldn’t we take something back?”
“A grabber?” Tony repeated,
Tony screamed and sobbed as Steve wrenched the shield back up, but he couldn’t stop the soldier from slamming it back down, shattering his femurs and pulling it back up with a spray of blood then bringing it back down again, severing Tony’s legs from the rest of his body.
“And then you will give yourself to me, declaring undying love and passion and we will be married before the talking animals and have lots of babies and live happily ever after.” Steve said.
More than once the two were found in the morning by Bruce or Peter or Zach after they’d fallen asleep on the sofa having spent the night talking.
It was a good thing that he was awake and alert when they got there as Zach’s reaction to seeing his big brother was launch himself up onto the bed and threw himself into Peter’s chest so hard that had Peter not been ready for it he would have probably hit his head on the headboard and suffered a concussion!
New York
“I wonder if it’ll last past five years, the last three marriages haven’t.” The woman who’d insulted Violet muttered beneath her breath.
“And Bucky?” Steve whispered, “How? no one could have survived that fall.”
The Doctor nodded signing the official handover form and got to work. “Looks like our friend here isn’t a popular man.” He commented as he cut through the dressings on the wounded arm, “This looks burned as well mangled, like he had a firework go off on his arm.”
“Hulk smashed Loki into the floor.” Tony said with a shrug, “You do have a video of that don’t you J?” He asked his AI.
“Emotional manipulator?” Steve asked with a chuckle.
“Hey little buddy, no one is taking you anywhere.” Steve soothed kissing Zach’s head, “Your friends at school were in a very dangerous environment, their mother was doing something illegal and dangerous with her boyfriend, so the children were taken for their safety.”
“This was your fault Tony.” Steve rasped with his dying breath, gazing at Tony as he stared at his dead and dying son, “You should have done more. You could have saved us, instead you killed us.”
Before doing so, Steve searched the cupboards for some biscuits and set them on the table, helping himself to a white chocolate and cranberry cookie while Tony poured the water into the mugs and added generous helpings of honey before bringing them over to the table.
“Steve.” Tony panted, “I’m having our baby!” He heard Steve’s sharp intake of breath.
“Fools!” the Skrull spat, “Even if Stark was jolted out of his sedation, he would be in no condition to do anything!”
Firstly Zach was in bed with Tony and Steve, and Peter. The two boys had snuggled in the middle while Tony and Steve lay either side of them. Thankfully the bed was King size, or they wouldn’t have fit. Steve’s broad shoulders took up a lot of space and Peter was a wriggler, his gangly limbs flopping each and every way as he slept.
“I like carnations.” Tony murmured, “If you are thinking of getting me flowers, I like carnations.”
Peter and Zach showed Tony around the re-modelled penthouse, taking him into their bedrooms where they had both cleared easy pathways to their beds that Tony could take while in the chair, the same had been sorted for the master bedroom and a new lower sink had been put in that Tony could use sitting down, the toilet had hand rails so he could easily move from the chair onto the toilet and back, the shower unit had been taken out and a simple non slip wet room style tiling had been put down with a drain so that Tony didn’t have to try and deal with the lip of the shower stall.
“Just how big is this place?” He asked.
Dr Bruce Banner, the Hulk.
“Doctors said a couple more days,” Tony replied, “Why?”
“Crazy.” Tony declared, moving from the shade to the sun and stretched out, his olive skin was already darkening with the sunlight and he was determined to enjoy it for as long as he could.
“Tell me again, Rumlow,” Pierce asked, “What did Rogers say to you in the lift?”
“But he didn’t, you saved me.” Tony reminded the Alpha, “And somehow we’ll save him.”
He’d had to act, he couldn’t just walk away. Quickly he’d pulled his sweater off and wrapped it about his head and lower face leaving just his eyes and forehead visible. Carefully he’d helped the old woman back onto her feet and had then taken off after the mugger.
“Tony, what happened, are you ill?” he asked,
Clint nodded looking relieved that he wouldn’t have to try answer questions from the press while more reporters screamed at him and blinded him with the flashing lights of their cameras. Bruce too looked very relieved, he wasn’t someone who enjoyed being the centre of attention and this would be a lot of attention, so to not have to do more than smile was a relief to him.
Options. He knew that, he did, he could terminate, it wasn’t like he’d been planning this, it wasn’t like he was parent material, but…. For some reason he couldn’t get the image of a pup, his pup out of his head, he imagine holding a tiny infant in his arms, rocking them to sleep, holding their tiny hands as they took their first steps. He imagine baking brownies in the kitchen and getting chocolate in his hair and over his face, imagined playing hide and seek, tag, and dress ups. He imagined himself teaching his Pup about science and technology, working on projects with them in the lab.
Okay this is the last update until after the 1st of September as I am going to be without internet for a while in my new flat. Once that is sorted I'll be back to regular updates. Hope everyone is doing well and staying safe. <3
“You need to move on, Man,” Sam said. His voice sounded gentle, but his tone was mocking, and he was acting like he was talking down to Tony, like a wise man to a fool. “Cling onto this because it was Iron Man’s most glorious moment is not doing you any good…” he trailed off, as Tony promptly turned, placing Lily in Steve’s arms and marched out of the room, letting the door slam behind him.
“Okay, breathe!” Rhodey said taking Tony by the shoulders and shaking him a little to get his attention, “First off, why would Steve move to Canada? Secondly, you are not fucked up, thirdly, he won’t hate you, he already adores you so you don’t need to worry about that, and you are not that much older than he is.”
“About the Avengers? You are probably right.” Tony said, “In fact you are definitely right, it’s only going to be so long before the next super villain shows up, best to be prepared.”
“Oh Mr Stark, we’re so sorry!” Ned cried leaping to his feet and nearly tripped over them,
He repeated his exercise until Tony was breathing normally again. “Alright now baby?” He asked, moving Tony to sit on his lap and cradled him to his chest, rocking him gently back and forth.
“One that is easily removed with a couple of bullets.” Natasha reminded him, “Not even you can survive a bullet to the head, Cap.”
“I want to do an interview.” He said firmly, “If Stern has the right speak about my family then I have the right to defend them.”
“And it’ll leave a hell of a mess on the side walk.” Spider Man called, holding Lily with one arm while dangling spider silk over her head which he waved back and forth as she made grabby hands for it.
“Will you stop?” Steve snapped managing again to shut Tony up, “What Howard did to you was cruel and perverse, and just plain evil, and if I could go back in time and break both of his arms for him and wring his neck then I would.” He sighed and let go of Tony’s hand to reach up and cup his cheek, “But I can’t do that,” He said stroking his thumb over Tony’s stubbled cheek, “What can do is be here for you, and make sure you don’t destroy yourself because of what that bastard did to you.”
“Of course you can sweetie.” Tony said, mentally planning to enrol Zach in skating classes in the new year. He was enjoying his martial arts classes and had made a couple of friends in the class, another activity would give a chance to make more.
With antlers and a sceptre, and a bunch of magic tricks that would have impressed Steve if the man/God/whatever wasn’t in the process of threatening the planet.
What did Steve have or had ever done that could possibly compare?
Tony set about making the kid a decent suit to wear so he would actually have some protection on his body rather than the spandex crap he was currently wearing, he was going to make sure that the suit was flexible as well as durable so it wouldn’t hinder Peter’s abilities or weigh him down, while still providing him with protection from injury.
