Sam spins to face him and this time, his expression is sad.
The fifth time it happens everything becomes clear to Dean, which is good because while he is technically the right age for a mid-life and/or sexuality crisis, it’s just fucking exhausting and Dean doesn’t really have time for that shit.  In any case, by the end of the night, he’s way more scared but a hell of a lot less confused and for now that’s something he can live with.
“Don’t think I don’t know,” Dean says ruefully, looking up at the sky.  “Don’t think I don’t know that the whole rough quickie in the back of my car thing was at least partly your idea.”
“Sam.”
it.  Had anybody suspected that the two of them might eventually find themselves in this position?  Had somebody seen something they hadn’t?
“Problem, chief?”
"Easy," Dean muttered into the angel's hair.  "All the girls I've done this with say it feels better if you can relax."
“I think you would start all slow and intense, sitting in my lap and just rocking your hips against me, letting my cock push up against the underside of your balls, teasing yourself as much as me.  Would you kiss me?  I feel like maybe you’d probably just stare at me – the fucking
Cas reaches out a hand towards Dean’s face and he’s so tentative as he stretches out his fingers, as if afraid that Dean will shy away, that Dean feels a tear trickle down his cheek.  Cas thumbs it away and leaves his hand there; Dean leans into the touch.
“And you don’t see how that’s worse?  You knew I was out there doing nothing but killing and praying and trying to get to you, and you just left me to the wolves.  Thank fuck Benny came along because it’s the only way I could rest enough not to fucking die, and we took apart Purgatory piece by piece to find you … and it’s like that means nothing to you because all you want to do is give up.  How do you expect me to feel about that, Cas?  You say you did this to keep me from getting hurt?  Well, how the fuck do you think you did on that one?”
Dean couldn't help but glance at his shoes and flush a bit at the note of warmth and steely pride in the angel's deep, raspy voice. When he looked back to Castiel, his friend's eyes were again focused on the pair of arguing men.
knows that he’s stalling now.  He hits ENTER on his keyboard and up pops the website.
Dean gave a genuine chuckle.  “They weren’t really.  I passed a pawn shop one day and saw this thing in the window.  Figured I had enough of a bad ass Johnny Cash thing going that I could pull it off.”
with Cas.  Let’s just say that Cas
“No, it’s hypocritical.”
Dean watches, aroused beyond belief, as the Dean inside his head rears back and hastily yanks at the fly of his jeans.  Dream Cas flips onto his belly without a word, trying to push up to a kneeling position but the Fantasy Dean braces a strong forearm across the back of Cas’s shoulders, holding the angel down against the worn leather.  With a deft tug, Dean’s doppelganger pushes down his pants and boxers, letting his erection bob free in the cool air as he pulls the white dress shirt free from Cas’s dress pants.  Dean knows where this was going now and a little moan that ekes past his lips as he turns onto his stomach, his twitching erection pinned against the seat.  His blood pounds when he realizes that he’s in the very same position where the Cas in his head moans and writhes.  As the hunter in his head leans down to reach under the angel to slide down the zipper of his trousers, Dean brings an arm up under his face to stifle his helpless noises in the sleeve of his shirt.
Sam ignores him.  “Does that feel good, Dean?”
“Where?!” the hunter shouted at the face that merely sneered back at him.
Cas stares at Sam, wall-eyed.  "I've never even
I … I can’t.”
“Bitch,” Dean responds with a smile and goes to fish out a clean pair of boxers and t-shirt from his duffle.
Dean does it, guffawing the whole way.  Strangely, the entire exchange made him feel a hell of a lot closer to comfortable.
Dean swallows.  He knows it will ‘break character’, but he has to ask: “Do you really want me, Cas?”
“Dean,” Castiel gasped, turning his face downward so that the corners of their lips brushed when he spoke.  “Dean, I want—I want to please you.  Tell me what to do ….”
Once they got the blood, they were on their way home, when Sam started making small talk which Dean sometimes detested.
"Commander, huh?" Dean asked, smirking.
"Lucifer, don't be rude," the detective hissed behind him pulling on his hand. Lucifer had suddenly gone stiff watching Castiel.
doing?"
"Bonded?" Dean looked at him.
"What a gentleman," Sam teased. Dean has learned to ignore Sam's snarky comments by now. Cas sat opposite of Sam, and then Dean himself sat at the head of the table (it was a tradition for the eldest in the family to sit at the head of the table after all). They had dinner and invited Jack to join them.
Cas felt a new surge of pride watching Dean defend him, and every time Dean said "Castiel" instead of plain old "Cas", the angel couldn't help but smile. Cas had always admired how Dean was so loyal to his family and friends, and God help anyone who dared disrespect them in front of the hunter.
Dean's voice cracked, as he fought to get the words out, "I- after what happened with Chuck, it was easier to blame you for everything. It was easier to lash out at the person closest to me, and that person always happened to be you."
"Well, most people think I'm a pain in the ass," Dean grinned, that child-like manner returning.
"And what happens if it… collapses?" Jack asked, breaking the crisp silence.
"That's our queue. We'll see you around, Lucifer," Sam said, ready to step through.
Dean turned around on the final step, "You're hurt too, Cas. Heal yourself first. I'll go take a long ass shower."
"You know, you
"So you're telling me you're from an alternate universe where you also have angels and demons and there's another version of… me?" Lucifer huffed, "I can't possibly allow this! There can only be ONE Lucifer, surely!"
Cas frowned, concerned, "Is everything alright?"
The hunter stood up, "Cas, I didn't just stay with you because I needed you to keep me alive. I enjoyed spending time with you, even as annoying as you are sometimes. And I thought…"
"What do you mean missing? Castiel, you were supposed to look after him!" Magnus said.

Dean pulled away from Cas, pointing an accusing finger at David, "You
"And how many times have you used THAT line, eh?" Dean asked with another laugh.
Cas shook his head, furiously.
Cas waited patiently for Inias to gather his thoughts, "I overheard David and a few others talking. They don't like Dean, you know."
Dean drove fast, recklessly. He couldn’t get the images of Cas screaming out of his head. He drove faster and faster until his stomach started to churn. Dean slowed and hit the brakes, pulling the impala to the side of the road. He immediately opened the door and threw up. Dean stayed there, feeling nauseated, uneasy and overall like absolute shit. Every time he closed his eyes, he saw Cas, blood-stained and beaten.
"And you guys are the only ones who can kill these demons because only Shadowhunters can wield a… seraph blade? So, what do you need our help then?" Sam asked.
This section is written from Dean's POV and what SHOULD happen after 15x03, enjoy!
to be another way around this…"
"It's the way you talk about him. My brother, Amenadiel, says I look like an utter lovestruck fool when I talk about Chloe. You have the same look. You would do anything to keep Dean safe, wouldn't you?" Lucifer asked, as images of Chloe dying in the hospital flashed in his mind. Lucifer had willingly gone to hell, to save the detective. It wouldn't seem like a big deal, but Lucifer wasn't particularly fond of hell. He had dreaded going back, but Chloe's life was at stake.
This chapter is longer than normal but I absolutely loved writing it and I think it's one of my favourites. This is when the story takes a massive turn, and Dean and Cas are thrown into a new situation where they become closer and Sam gets the opportunity to step up.
This was really happening huh?
"We should go. See you," Cas said to those who were there. He gave a little wave to Clarissa, as did Dean and they exited.
Sam indicated for the rest of them to sit down wherever they pleased. There weren't many chairs, just two, so Clary and Isabelle squeezed into one. Alec and Magnus fell into one of the beds, and Sam and Dean sat on the other bed. Jace just stayed standing, Alec grinned at him teasingly. Magnus used his magic to conjure up more drinks for everyone, but God knows they'll need it. Alec and Jace spoke for most of the time, well, mostly Alec, trying to explain their world, their demons, and their jobs. Sam and Dean nodded, trying to wrap their minds around this whole new world. According to Alec, there were different types of demons: Greater demons and Lesser demons, who had the ability to possess a human and leave, leaving the human with no memory of when they were possessed. Sam huffed, watching as their case slowly pieced together at last.
“Jesus, Cas, do you have
Benny whipped around to face Dean with a raised eyebrow.  Castiel, on the other hand, just spun slowly and stared back at the hunter with a resigned expression that said he’d been expecting this conversation for days now, which only fueled Dean’s anger.
Hope you enjoyed this.  Stick with me, babies, because the pay-off that happens with Cas will be SO WORTH IT.
His eyes fluttered shut as he leaned back against the tree that towered above the two of them, reaching out with his Grace to scan for enemies and finding only the lingering, cold presence of the vampire, stalking in ever-widening circles around their tiny encampment.  Though the two of them had exchanged no words as Dean settled in for the night, Castiel was grateful that the vampire seemed to understand the angel’s need to stay with his friend, watch over him as he slept even though the hunter certainly would extend the angel neither speech nor kindness.  Another piece of Castiel’s penance; another item on a list that never seemed to stop growing.
– until I was human, when I first was able to look at you and see your body as other humans do.”
since he was about eleven, especially not sex.  Hell, he practically waved a flag with a condom on it every time he thought about sex.  Dean scrubbed a hand through his hair and tried to will the redness from his cheeks.  He wasn’t blushing because it was sex, he was blushing because it was sex with just about the last person on the planet he’d ever expected to have sex with.  Sure, pretty much everybody and their brother – even Cas’s brothers – had joked about it but ….  That actually made him wonder if any of the people that poked fun at him and Cas over the years about their ‘profound bound’ had actually, well,
bartender throwing himself at me and I couldn’t close the deal,
Dean stalked around the clearing, running a circle opposite to Benny’s, using the hand not gripping his weapon to card through his hair.  Every now and then, the panic boiled high enough to have him grip the short, dirty-blonde strands in punishing grip, stopping his restless circling long enough to let out a frustrated grunt.  There weren’t many things that could rattle Dean hard enough that he couldn’t either bury them or burn through them, but whatever the hell this was going on with Cas … it was more than enough to say he was sufficiently rattled.
Benny had been ganked and in Purgatory long before Dean Winchester ever walked the Earth, but word of the fearless and ferocious pair of hunting brothers threaded among most of the monsters that had ever encountered him.  He had known who Dean Winchester was long before he saved the man’s hide; he’d heard bits and pieces of stories chewed on by shifters and vamps and all sorts of creatures, some who knew the boys by reputation only and some who had the Winchesters’ stern faces as their last living memories.  He’d never personally had much of an axe to grind with hunters like the Winchester boys, but Benny was damn sure that Dean’s history with the population of Purgatory was half their problem.  But Benny hadn’t really been able to help feeling just the slightest bit sorry for Dean, even before he’d known him.  Unlike most of the creatures he encountered here as well as their hunter counterparts, Dean and his brother hadn’t chosen their lot, it had been forced on them.  Maybe Benny sympathized more than he ought to, but he understood the way that kind of burden weighed on a person.
Dean thought with a wry half-smile.
“Damn it, Sam!”
“But Cas isn’t—he doesn’t … I mean, he doesn’t think that way.  Feel like that,” Dean argued weakly.  “He doesn’t have those kinds of feelings.”
“You are
Cas had turned him on more than anything had in as long as he could remember.  So Dean does what he does with any problem: barrel straight at it, both middle fingers raised, and kick it in the ass.
Enjoy,
.  Every time the hunter twitched in his sleep, the angel’s voice became a little louder, a little more desperate in his prayer.  The angel would pause in his recitations just long enough to press a hand to the hunter’s head, healing whatever ailed the man and unmistakably draining himself a little more each time he did.  As jaded as Benny was towards “Hot Wings”, he couldn’t help but feel a pull in his heart at the sight of it.
So what the fuck does he go for?  Who the hell is he supposed to be if he’s trying to appeal to guys?  Standing in a motel bathroom in his boxers, pulling his hair in frustration is definitely not what he wanted out of this evening.
“Or maybe,” Dean says, letting the fantasy spin out of his head and into his mouth as he pictures it, “maybe you’d want to draw it out.  How would you start, Cas?  Would you suck me off?  Wouldn’t be the first time I’ve pictured that happening.  You on your knees, stretching your lips around my cock.  I bet you could take me all the way down to the back of your throat.  God damn, that mouth of yours; just the idea of pushing my dick between those lips makes me want to come.”
Dean groaned as if in pain when Castiel grabbed at his hip; Castiel thrust harder into his grip.
For no good reason, Dean is trying to resist the temptation.  Maybe it’s that he doesn’t want to risk moaning his brother’s name while some kid who looks vaguely like Cas writhes in his lap.  Maybe it’s that getting a lap dance from a barely-legal-to-drink
(See the end of the chapter for
Dean smiled wryly and, before he realized what he was saying, blurted out, “Then how ‘bout you volunteer to be a better pillow than these tree roots?”
“Whoa!” Dean can’t help that he practically shouts; being airborne during sex hasn’t exactly come up before.  “Holy shit.”
Whatever protests Dean made, it had taken Benny less than ten minutes to realize that it wasn’t only the angel carrying a torch.  It had only taken about ten more minutes to realize that the hunter didn’t have the slightest concept of how deep those feelings ran; his or the angel’s.  The more time they spent needling each other as the group crossed Purgatory, the more frustrated Benny had gotten.   There was only so much pussy-footing around that two people could do before you have to make a choice to either get up and dance or walk away from the dance floor.  Well, the vampire had been nearly certain that Dean would run like hell, but lo and behold … it seemed that the hunter had learned to dance.
“I wouldn’t though, Cas; not in your mouth.  I’d pull you back up into my lap, push my tongue into your mouth, taste myself there.  You could stroke both of our dicks together while I stretched you out on my fingers –
Dean almost wishes that the case had been more than a simple salt-and-burn.  It became insanely obvious that the big bad in this case was the ghost of an animal rights activist that had been run down in an alley by the leader of a dog fighting ring, and the spirit had been working his way through all of the local ring runners.  Of course, only assholes like Dean would have found their methods of death funny – like, seriously, one of the dudes suffocated because a squeaky toy got lodged in his esophagus; every time he tried to ask for help, he just squeaked – but in the end, he just burned the bones of the poor dog lover and that was that.  In fact, he almost hated doing it because after having a dog’s noggin for a couple of days, Dean thinks that those dog fighting assholes got exactly what they deserved but he can’t in good conscience leave a ghost running all over hell killing people, so supernatural cookout it is.
The angel watched Dean’s eyelids flutter shut and his throat work as he swallowed several times in rapid succession.  Castiel’s hands itched as they clutched at the ragged folds of his trench coat, longing to tangle them in the worn leather of Dean’s jacket to pull the hunter closer and yet, not daring to make such a bold move.  Castiel’s throat clenched, his heart seemed to bounce against his ribs as he watched Dean take deliberate breaths that inflated the man’s chest until it seemed fit to burst.
And it was enough to have the hunter tumbling over his peak into the void, cushioned by Cas’s warm body, steady breaths, and gentle hands at his shoulders.  For just a moment, his sins were forgiven and Dean felt pure.
Okay, breathe, Dean.
“Will you dress up as Slave Leia sometime?” Cas asks with a lopsided grin as he tosses the condom aside for a moment to focus on the small plastic bottle in his hand.
An expression of open astonishment on his face, the angel raised a hand towards Dean's face, so near to his own. In contrast to the last time this had occurred, Dean found that he didn't shy away from the hand in expectation of further violence; as a matter of fact, he couldn't seem to resist leaning into the long, graceful fingers as they cupped his face. Dean's eyes fluttered shut without his consent.
Castiel’s lips quirked up at the edges.  When Dean moved to settle down for sleep, Castiel rested his head in the pocket of the hunter’s shoulder and draped an arm across his chest.
Dean sneered.
“I just … you know, I thought it might help to have you next to me while I sleep.  You know … if you don’t mind.”
“That’s a nice sentiment, Dean, though slightly strange coming from someone who once tried to procure a prostitute to rid me of my virginity.”
Sometimes, Dean just wanted to punch Cas in his entirely-too-pretty-for-a-million-year-old-virgin face.  The fact that after all this time, practically an entire fucking year, that winged son of a bitch still thought he would leave him behind.  Maybe it shouldn’t make Dean mad that Cas was trying to release him from guilt if things went sour, but damn it, he was mad and he had every right to be.  After all the shit they’d been through even before they crashed in Monster Land, Cas still thought he didn’t fucking matter enough to Dean to find a way to save him?  And after everything that happened
~ Canto XIX, lines 115-120
to it, right?  So as much as it makes his throat hitch with nervousness, Dean forces himself to settle back onto the pillow, one arm cushioned under his head.  Since Sammy will be gone for at least an hour or two, and really, he’s safe inside his own head, Dean gives himself permission to think about it.
“You know what?  Your Smitey Face kind of does it for me.”
.  Nerdy dude with wings.
“Bind?!” And okay, that sounds way more harsh and panicky than Dean means it to, but after quasi-bondage sex and sort-of declarations of love, it sounds a little too rape-y right now.
Castiel seethed with anger as he stalked through the trees surrounding their camp.  Sensing only the scurrying of small beasts that would be of no concern to Dean’s safety, he focused his intuition towards the farther-off threats of larger creatures; they would most likely be drawn to Castiel’s presence rather than Dean’s, especially given his current emotional state.  Despite his nearly unchanging facial expressions , Castiel had already been angry enough to unconsciously ignite two tiny brush fires just by failing to control the energy released from his Grace when upset.  He couldn’t afford to be so careless, with his conspicuousness or his output of Grace.
“Yeah, neither do I,” Dean grumbled.  “Jesus, I hate that I have to sound like a fucking after school special.”
“You can’t see any stars here.  I miss the stars,” Dean mumbled absently.  The hunter’s eyes darted sideways just enough to catch Castiel looking at him and then wrenched back upwards.  A smile quirked the corners of Dean’s lips, still slightly swollen from traversing Castiel’s neck.
“You all right?” Sam responds, the annoyance draining away to leave only worry.  “Need to talk about it?”
Nudging Castiel's top leg forward until the angel had to prop himself up on a knee and elbow, Dean slowly slid the wet fingers between the rounds of Castiel's rear.  Castiel pressed his face into the worn leather jacket propping up his head, stifling a drawn-out gasp in the folds.  His limbs felt both watery with nerves and electrified with anticipation, his vessel barely able to send the proper messages to his brain for translation.  All he really knew was the word Dean repeated over and over again as the hunter gingerly breached Castiel's body with a single damp digit.
“Nut up, Winchester,” Dean growls to himself because even
“I told you that I don’t having any objections,” Cas said, impatient.  “I would have thought that was obvious given my vocal encouragement during our sexual encounters—”
amused with himself at the outcome.  Dean’s eyes drop shut as he reaches out with his mind.
~ Canto XV, lines 108-114
“Dean,” he spoke again, “you sound jealous of the fact that I have had a lover.”
“You’d better, God damn it.”
Sam whirls back astride Dean, boxes him in between his arms again, and this time, Sam wraps his legs around the back of the chair so he can balance with Dean’s erection sliding up against his ass over and over again while he’s staring Dean dead in the eyes.
Cas’s hands work to unbutton his cuffs as Dean starts yanking at the line of buttons down Cas’s chest, and this time it’s Cas who gasps as Dean sucks on Cas’s jaw, his throat, his neck.   Cas looks like he’s wrestling the damn dress shirt but it’s finally on the floor, Cas’s bare chest pressed against him as he winds his fingers into the angel’s hair, clutching and clawing at him as their tongues battle again.  Cas starts to make for his belt but it’s taking too damn long, so Dean just reaches down and grabs handfuls of Cas’s ass, dragging him against Dean so he can feel Cas’s answering hardness, chafe their groins together until they both groan from it. Cas grunts, low and needy, against Dean’s shoulder and, Jesus, just hearing him making such an animalistic noise drives Dean fucking crazy.  Opening up his legs to let Cas step between them – Cas is close, but not close enough, damn it – Dean groans when Cas grabs Dean’s left thigh with a firm hand, Cas’s palm skimming across the thick muscle to dig into his ass and pull up.  Dean winds his leg around Cas’s waist on instinct – and really, where the hell did
and his hands are motherfucking shaking.  “I need—you have be sure.  If I were to have you, be with you this way, and then you changed your mind or regretted the choice, I ….”  Cas flinches, closes his eyes.  “I could never live with it.”
"Sweet!" Dean encourages.
“Eight years ago, I couldn’t have thrown a fucking rock without hitting a chick who would bend over backwards to ride me like fucking Sea Biscuit and you know what?  I was happy with that.  And then you stroll your angelic ass into that damn shed with your stupid sex hair and those fucking eyes and the god-damned trench coat.” A yelp of anger leaves him.  “And it’s like you were a fucking tornado that blew away everything I used to be.”
“Even better,” the kid says.
“Sam,” Cas says by way of greeting, and it’s little more than a grunt.
The angel’s hands drop from Dean’s shoulders and although he doesn’t move that far away, Dean’s feels the distance yawn like a chasm.
Dean settled on the ground as he always did, removing his coat and folding it for a pillow for both of their heads, but when he laid down for sleep, instead of stretching out on his back to wait for Castiel, the hunter turned away from him, curling onto his side and wrapping his arms around his heaving chest.  Castiel scowled as he watched his friend, watched him quaver as he attempted to hold in sobs, clutching his crossed arms to his own chest and turning his face away towards the ground.  Lowering himself to a crouch behind Dean, Castiel put out a hand to his friend’s shoulder.
"Oh yes."
“Cas showed up in Atlanta after tuning into Dean Winchester FM,” he says, tapping his forehead, “and he—”
having sex was a main concern.  He’d laid it out for Cas back when they’d come up against Famine: when he wanted sex, he went out and got it.  Dean was “well-fed”, and he’d never found that to be a potential downside until now.  Now it seemed to have made him into a poster-child for greediness.  He watched Cas as he cast those ice blue eyes up to the sky, shielding Dean with his leaner body as he scanned the surrounding trees for something Dean could only guess at with his comparatively dull senses, and couldn’t help but feel like a glutton in comparison.  Dean had described himself as “well-fed” back then; he’d never had trouble going after what he wanted, never had qualms about it.  If he had a certain hunger, he tended the need.
Before the gender of his partner of choice had ever been called into question, the issue of whether or not to have sex hadn’t been so damn difficult.  The answer was almost always “yes” and Dean couldn’t remember ever having to be so worried about the consequences, because to Dean, “sex” and “consequences” used to just mean “wear a condom” and “don’t slobber during foreplay”.  Even when he’d been with Cassie or Lisa, when the relationship itself had been complicated, the issue of sex never had been.
“Not entirely inaccurate,” he admitted, “but still, that’s different.”
has Dean’s eyes rolling back) and when he dares to look down at the sight, he has to bite his lip to keep from teetering close to the edge of coming.  It doesn’t stop a loud moan from coming out though, which makes Cas glance up and catch Dean’s gaze.
Cas had dropped to his knees so quickly and unexpectedly that Dean actually cried out in shock when the angel’s mouth engulfed his erection.  He had to fling his hands out behind himself to brace his body to keep from wobbling over, a moan tearing itself out of his mouth as he watch his slowly disappearing and reappearing from between the angel’s lips.
Something warred in Cas’s face at that, something Dean was sure he wasn’t telling him, but eventually the angel just nodded.  “I’m sorry, Dean.”
Dean had barely gathered himself when another fanged freak came barreling out of the scrub and tackled him to the ground.  Cursing himself for not being aware of the second attack, Dean struggled as the vampire above him snarled and snapped in his face.  He’d managed to drop the scythe just out of reach – how the fuck did that always manage to happen? – and his knife was still buried in the tree, so the hunter just did what he could with bare hands to keep the thing from tearing him to pieces.  He fought his hardest but he knew, after just a few seconds, that it wasn’t going to be enough.  Dean was too tired, had been too startled, the vampire was too strong.  It wasn’t going to take this jerk long to get the upper hand, pin him down, and rip him to pieces.  As he fought with his last few rounds of strength, Dean managed to send out a quick thought:
Dean tries to shoulder past Cas and at least put a shirt on, because having this discussion half-naked now seems like an incredibly bad idea, but Cas grabs him by the wrist and heaves, and this time, Dean slams into the wall with enough force that his head swims a bit.  Cas moves so close they actually bump noses.
Cas didn't hesitate. "I've missed you."
“Holy shit, man,” Dean guffawed, “that’s the funniest damn thing I’ve ever heard.  If
Dean's eyes watered suspiciously, but he laughed at the end, a sad smile pulling at one end of his lips. "You didn't see me with my dad, though. It was all 'Yes, sir', 'no, sir', 'of course I'll take care of Sammy, sir'. When I was with Dad … I
just a good soldier."
He’s probably only about 5’6” and slender, but Dean can tell the kid’s got good muscle tone under the tight black pants and t-shirt.  He’s got hair so dark the black looks blue under the colored lights and it’s artfully tousled back away from a round, friendly face.  Dean’s new admirer favors him with a softer smile after a long, assessing gaze.
His pulse spikes pretty much immediately as he considers those bright blues eyes that tear through him with laser intensity.  Eyelids fluttering shut, Dean grazes his palm against the fly of his jeans, his erection building as he imagines the angel’s acute stare directed at him, glazed over with lust.  He gasps in a breath and chafes his hand over his pants more firmly, letting his thoughts drift towards slim, graceful fingers and how they would feel against the hot skin of his abdomen.  He lowers the zip on his fly, pushing jeans and boxers down below his hips in one swift movement.  In his head, the hand wrapping around his achingly hard erection is pale and slender but strong, cool against his heated skin, and Dean can’t help the way his hips leave the mattress as he thrusts into his own palm.
“Dean, I’m sorry,” Castiel gabbled, his cheeks flushing as he scrambled to disentangle his arm from Dean’s.  “I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to—”
Dean just lies still on the bed, too drained and shocked to even let go of his deflating erection.  He supposes that answers his question about whether or not he’d be able to think about Cas “that way”.  As he blinks and stares at the ceiling, contemplating the bristling thrill at the back of his mind, he gets the feeling that maybe Cas has been forced into a revelation today, too, if that wild, bewildered exhilaration is anything to go by.
Or maybe Dean had just gotten sloppy.  He hadn’t slept in days now, so all of his senses seemed muted and his muscles had begun to scream with soreness after even the most minor fights.  The hunter had learned very quickly in those first panic-filled days that letting himself sleep at night made him ten times as vulnerable.  Most of these creatures had senses keening than any animal on Earth and at first, he’d assumed that meant that moving at night would only put him at a disadvantage.  What he discovered, however, was that a damn vampire could sneak up on him a fuck lot faster when it was cloaked in darkness; Dean had nearly lost a freaking leg learning
"No, he doesn't. Dean, Cas could never hate you. He just needs some time to pull through this. You both do," Sam said gently.
TW: a form of self-harm and minor panic attack
Jody was the first one to react. She got a message from a friend who went with Castiel saying that something had gone terribly wrong. They didn't anticipate Michael's monsters to be there. She tried to call them, to get in touch with the group but the calls never went through.
"Shit, sorry, I-" Dean breathed out, watching Cas close his eyes, and put his head back again.
"Oh come on detective! We can do the paperwork later!" The towering man whined.
"That's awesome," Dean replied. Cas agreed, holding Dean close to him.
"I'm okay, Cas. I always am," Dean muttered back. Dean pulled back searching for something in Cas's eyes. Cas still looked unsettled, so Dean kissed him, nice and slow. Lately, most of their kisses were like this: gentle, reassuring and filled with so much love.
responsibility, alright? We're gonna work it out together, all of us. You need to stop beating yourself up for everything," Cas said carefully.
"Are you stupid or insane?" Dean hissed in his right ear.
Sam knew his brother inside out, and he had known about Dean's maddening and intense feelings for the angel for a while now. It was impossible to miss, what with the constant staring and dying for each other type of shit. Sam had always known. But seeing his brother at that moment, finally, admitting it was unexpected. Dean looked scared. Not because he was able to be open, but scared to lose Cas. Again.
Dean stepped out into Lucifer's living room, and his question was answered. Lucifer and Castiel were out on the balcony- one with a glass of bourbon in his hand. He watched them both quietly. An angel and the devil himself- it was a strange sight to observe.
"Of course, and spread the word: we leave for headquarters tomorrow at dawn," Cas said.
Cas and Jack asked simultaneously. Dean forgot that Jack had not met Maze back at the precinct. Cas's eyes flared at Dean.
" Dean tried again, and pulled Cas's hands away from his father, "what
Cas went on his mission and was due to return in the morning of the next day but he didn't. Dean got anxious waiting for Cas. He didn't have Cas's number to text him, so he got it from Sam, but Cas didn't text back. Sam wasn't worried at all, because he knew Cas had secure backup. Dean got his own bedroom, his own bed, for the first time in over a year. Kristy, their cook, kept him well fed. She was around his age, maybe a bit younger, extremely attractive and Dean admired her culinary skills. Dean wore Cas's clothes and revelled in the fact that it smelled like Cas. Dean became gradually more concerned as he waited for Cas's return.
"Sam, I want you to take over. I want you to carry on my mission, to train, fight and beat Michael. Dean and I will help where we can, but I need you to
Dean thought reminding himself not to laugh out loud. The gun began to shake in her hands as she stepped back a little. Dean very slowly tried to reach the knife in his back pocket.
Dean took a deep breath in before answering bitterly, "I guess you didn't know me all that well, then."
"Yes," Cas replied plainly.
"Fair point detective. So how can we possibly help?" Lucifer asked again eyeing Dean.
Fight For My Survival- The Phantoms
"Dean, hey, don't," Cas reopened Dean's fists. They stared at each other for a split second, and Cas saw a broken soul staring back at him.
"Dean?" Sam asked over the phone.
"Are you two together or something?" John asked, pretending as though Cas didn't just call him out on all his shitty parenting decisions. His eyes went to Dean, and then to Cas, watching and observing all their small movements: the way Dean was naturally leaning into Cas, and how he had a firm hand on the angel as though he was holding him back, or the way Cas was now standing in front of Dean, like a protective human barrier.
This was a very cute chapter to write omg
"Hey," Dean said. Cas looked shit scared. Dean bowed a little politely, offering his hand, which Cas took without hesitation and Dean pulled Cas into him leading him down the small steps and into the crowd. Dean hooked his arm into Cas's, guiding him over to where Sam and Jack were staring at them.
for once.
"Guys, stop it! You're hurting him!" Dean screamed begging at Sam, but Sam and Rowena continued. Cas's screams grew louder to the point where Dean wished he didn't have ears anymore. The rain poured down on them, lightning flashing across the skies, fire and blood surrounding them, it was like the end of the world… again.
"I'll show you what's impressive later tonight," Cas teased, giving Dean a side-eye. Dean grinned, going pale red.
Cas looked at him, a bit speechless, so Dean continued, "I'm proud of you and everything you've achieved here. I don't say it enough I know, but you're fucking incredible, Cas. The way you lead these people. You taught them everything you know, you helped Sam, you found me and you helped me. You made friends in those kids. You helped these families and all these people."
"Castiel, can I ask you something?" Lucifer asked, his rings tapping on the glass gripped in his hand.
"Hey Cas," Dean said, without looking up.
"Castiel! Oh, it's so good to see you again! How are you?" Inias said, pulling Castiel into a very unexpected but heart-warming hug.
Cas sighed, "I know you're angry. But this has been going on for too long. If you won't apologise for what you said to me, then after all this God shit is over, I'm leaving. For good this time. I can't be around you, knowing that you hate me. I just can't."
Lucifer choked on his glass of bourbon and Jack nearly tripped over the edge of the carpet. Both of them looked up at the same time.
"Now where were we?" Lucifer said, his eyes glowing red momentarily.
Dean pulled Cas into him, his stare burning into Cas's eyes, "Of course it fucking matters! You're all that matters!"
"Yes they will. I just need some time to recover and the rest of my feathers will hopefully grow back," Castiel said as they approached the doorway.
"It's okay. I'll ask Sam to lend you some. You can stay here, with me. Sleep here, I have some things to finish anyway. When we get back, I'll give you a proper room, a proper bed, clothes, food, anything you need," Cas said.
-last part to the small sequel
Castiel sighed gazing back. He couldn't refuse Dean, "When you were in hell, I- well I repaired your soul and put you back together. I'm afraid that if I try to perform this procedure on you… that it will break you," Castiel said staring intensely at Dean.
Sam placed his fork down, "Does this mysterious man have a name?"
Dean quickly caught his arm, "Okay, sure. But I- uh- I was wondering… when you're done, maybe I can treat you with dinner? I can give you my number-"
You know damn well that's not gonna happen."
The dinner ended smoothly, with Dean remaining silent for most of it, and John went to the guest room to clean up and sleep. They would figure out how to send him back tomorrow. Sam threw away the Chinese take away boxes and chopsticks, while Dean, almost immediately, rushed into his bedroom. He closed the door and let out a massive breath. Did he just accidentally and unintentionally come out to his entire family? Or
Dean was in his room when an alarm went off, indicating the return of the jeep. Dean sped down the halls, his anxiety rising to a maximum. He found Sam nearly the garage, watching the two jeeps to roll in. Cas got down from the first one, nodding to his friends. He saw Sam first, who smiled and welcomed him back. And then before Cas had time to think, Dean had already wrapped his arm and body around Cas.
Dean thought.
Lucifer called upon his brother Amenadiel to travel using his wings and retrieve the fruit from the tree of life, Cas and Jack split up to search for the Seal of Solomon while Sam and Dean went to find the Most Holy Man.
to meet you Lucifer," Cas said, shaking hands with the devil.
They both said simultaneously.
And just like that, the fireworks disappeared. The sky vanished and the people were no longer there. The next time Dean opened his eyes, they were back in the bunker, back in the dusty old storage room. Cas was still in his arms. When they both realised they were home again, Cas sighed and let his head fall into Dean's chest, letting out a massive breath.
-deancas established
Dean bit his lips, eyes wandering off from Cas's lips to his rich sky-blue eyes.
The next morning, the boys drove over to the forest where they had heard a "supernatural unholy being" had been inhabiting the forest. Sam and Dean paired up, as did Cas and Jack, and they split up. Both teams brought lighters and flares with them.
Dean inhaled, and nodded, "thank you, for literally everything." Dean fell into Cas's arms, finally letting the tears splurt out. Cas held him tightly.
"I have no idea but… I mean if we're really in LA, may as well enjoy ourselves am I right?" Dean chirped checking out the women walking down the street with their expensive bags, skinny polished legs, and their shimmering jewellery.
shirts," Cas said.
"You should eat and rest for a bit," Cas said, throwing the backpack to Dean.
"Well, that's... interesting..." Lucifer said, not knowing how to top that.
"Trixie's teacher called, she got into trouble and Maze is dropping me off at her school. I handed the case over to Dan to handle it so if you want, you can work with him. But Lucifer, please play nice," Chloe said checking her phone unbothered to remove the strand of hair that fell over her face.
Sam blinked a few times, astonished and clueless.
"Alright everyone, help me with the books," Sam broke the silence to receive a "hell no" from Dean who went to grab another drink.
"No." Both Sam and Cas answered simultaneously.
"Why couldn't you heal me?" Dean questioned.
"Your heart's desire was to have your dad back?"
"Cas, you know I'm not- good with words. Or talking about how I feel," Dean said quietly.
he added in his head. Cas gloomed, watching his adoptive son laugh with Lucifer.
Dean laughed, "I know. But if there are- uh- other things you need, I can give it to you."
"So, you and Dean are what exactly?" Magnus asked, hooking his arm into Alec's.
"Cas, it's nothing don't worry," Sam murmured back. Dean couldn't rip his eyes off the angel's wings. He had seen them before a few odd years ago but this, this was different. Everything was different. Castiel shifted trying to get up but again, flinched and fell back down.
that I would never hurt Dean," Cas said, stepping forward and staring down Sam until he gave in.
"But I'm one of the best fighters we've got!" Dean argued.
Dean stepped forward, he was a few inches taller than Cas, "Don't I? We're
Castiel searched high and low but he couldn't find Dean Winchester. Something was pulling him to the room on the far end of the hallway, the lights bursting and screams blasting in his ear as the war raged on around him. Michael's monsters and fighters were strong but hopefully, Castiel's army was stronger. Dean and Cas had gotten separated over a year ago when Dean got pulled away from him when the apocalypse started by the archangel Michael. And by apocalypse I mean the whole shebang: volcanic eruptions, shattering earthquakes, trees falling, extreme weather, unpredictable hurricanes and tornadoes everywhere. It was a miracle some people even survived. They found other hunters, and whoever was alive, and they appointed Castiel to be their leader. Years passed, and Cas was still hell-bent on finding Dean.
"Back in Purgatory, I wanted to tell you something else but you cut me off," Dean said.
The first thing Dean saw was the massive chandelier swinging from the ceiling looking like it's about to fall. Then he saw the table in front of the TV which was literally lined with gold. There was a massive spiral staircase leading to squeaky clean tiles covering the ground.

The devil, an angel and Heaven's most despised human being: the unholy trinity.
"So, the demon has Dean… damnit," Sam muttered.
Song for the chapter:
"Cas, don't leave!" It was Clarissa. The little girl Cas adored, fire for hair and fiery for a personality. Cas stopped, gazing at her with a small smile. Another kid stood up, Owen, one of Clarissa's friends, "Dean's right! Cas gave us a home and a family and purpose to fight for! He can't leave!"
Cas saw Sam and Dean talk casually with their father, as though the man hadn't been dead for the past 12 years or so. Dean saw Cas standing in the doorway from his peripheral vision, and paused. He called Cas over, and although Castiel was hesitant at first, he obliged. John Winchester stared at Cas, unable to figure out who Cas was.
"Well, I'll be damned," Lucifer exclaimed, utterly star-struck.
"Yeah, my brother is a pain in the ass. But he really tries for you. He was scared shitless yesterday when you went on that hunt."
Song recommendation for this chapter because the way the music slowly builds up from calm into absolute chaos is literally what happens in this chapter:
"Yes, she is. I hope she's okay," Dean calmed down from his fan frantic geeking episode.
"Do we know where it's nesting?" Cas asked, unsure.
Cas just shook his head smiling to himself, leaving the room.
"Oh, how rude of me. This is my incredible partner, detective Chloe Decker, the very best of her kind," Lucifer said to which Chloe Decker nodded in return.
"Jesus Christ, I'm never touching weird hexed fairytale books ever again," Dean muttered, feeling Cas laugh into his chest. They pulled away from each other when they heard Sam and Jack calling out for them. Sam entered the storage room, staring at Dean and Cas with a huge grin on his face.
Cas wrapped his left arm around Dean weakly, "I know."
Dean looked down, blushing all sorts of maroons and reds, "thanks, Cas. I should get going."
The boys fell into their universe. Sam, who had stepped through first, rolled down the hill but was able to swiftly find his footing. Dean and Castiel were less fortunate as they both tumbled down the hill with Dean landing directly on top of Cas with a loud thump.
Their Fridays continued like that, one movie after another, Sam and Eileen being cute and sharing kisses and Cas always sitting a little too close to Dean. But Dean never complained. Not once.
"Fuck off," Dean snarled. But this time, Cas persisted, grabbing Dean's working arm, sending his grace through Dean's body until his other arm healed perfectly. Dean growled and pushed Cas away. Cas stumbled back a little, annoyed now.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Dean, let me heal you," Cas said, feet shuffling to reach Dean.
"Sam said that he wanted to speak with you and Cas. He wants to join our camps if I'm not wrong, but we need to plan everything properly. We can coordinate an attack together," Jody was rambling on but Dean was too tired to pay attention. Claire noticed the way Dean's hands moved slower as he ate, nodding absentmindedly.
"Save your strength," was all Cas said in return. He placed his hand on Dean's bare chest, watching how Dean winced at his touch and prayed that Dean will pull through this.
"Find Jack and the other hostages," Dean whispered into Cas's ears.
"He's a real piece of work, huh?" Dean asked, watching Lucifer leave. Cas agreed. The night wind howled against them, and the chill smacked them in the face. Dean's hands were freezing, and trembling when the glass slipped out of his hands and shattered on the ground. Dean yanked his whole body back in shock. This man has faced the end of the world but nearly shits his pants when a glass breaks.
"I'm a centuries-old warlock, I learn fast," Magnus said, "You're working this case right? The three dead teenagers? We think it's our kind of demon."
"Cas, I know this is hard for you, but you have to promise me. Sam doesn't have what it takes, and Jack doesn't need that kind of trauma in his head. It
Dean nodded, “Yeah, I don’t know what you did to me, but I haven’t thrown up again. I feel, good.”
Dean pushed Cas furiously against the wall, "No. No, you don't get to leave until you fucking explain how we know each other. Cas, is it?"
Dean didn't remember Castiel, but he felt his heart wrench in pain.
Dean and Cas sprinted through the forest in the dead of the night. They kept running for a long few minutes until Dean declared he needed a break. They spent the next few hours until sunrise, running and hiding, fighting when they had to, and saving each other's asses over and over again.
"I understand, Sammy," Dean said quietly, "Is that where the sudden storm came from?"
Song for the chapter:
"I've- uh- been thinking about everything. About what you said last night," Dean said quietly. Cas tilted his head but nodded.
"Sam, you're hurt," Castiel said.
"They're a part of my body Dean. When I am hurt, I bleed," Castiel said matter-of-factly sounding more humane than ever.
Cas swallowed nervously, "It doesn't matter."
Cas looked at Dean, and he could see Dean visibly shaking with the cold.
"If you found me, then why aren't we back home yet?" Cas asked, genuinely confused because he thought they had reached the end of the story. Dean sighed, gripping the handrail as he stared out at the ocean of people below.
"How are you holding up Cas?" Dean asked approaching him. The angel sighed and shrugged, "hmm okay."
Dean paced himself, "Cas, I'm sorry. I fucked up, big time. I was so blinded by my rage and grief, that I shut you out, and I became the last person I ever wanted to be. You gave me everything, you were always there for me, and you cared for me. I was stupid and big-headed, and I didn't realise how much I was hurting you. I know we can't fix this, but I just- I need you to know how fucking sorry I am."
Dean thought.
After a while, Cas pulled his hand back and along with it, a blue glimmering light. Dean gasped when Cas released him. His head fell back to the couch with his eyes sealed. Dean's grip on the angel's hand loosened, allowing Cas to pull away. Jack helped Cas put the little piece of the soul into a small bottle and closed the bottle tightly. Cas turned his attention right back to Dean, and for a split second, he thought Dean had stopped breathing.
overdue, "thank you for not only saving me countless amounts of times on a daily basis but thank you for being there for me through this fucking crazy ride. You've always done what you thought was best for me and Sam. I've never had anyone care for me the way you do, to be fucking honest. I mean, I have Sam but he's my brother. It's in his job description to look after my 2 brain cells when I can't. And my dad, well, he never fucking cared about what happened to me. Everyone else in my life that I cared about either got hurt or died." Dean sighed because as morbid as it was, it was true. Every single word.
"Dean... about tomorrow-" Cas started but Dean cut him off.
"It makes sense when you say it like that. Cas spent a whole year worried out of his mind about you. And he finally gets you back and he's probably scared you'll get taken away from him again. Think about it, Dean. He still wants you as a friend, I'm sure. He
The man stood up, fixed his expensive suit and held out a hand, "I am, indeed. Lucifer Morningstar at your service. How may I help you dashing lads?" Lucifer's eyes landed on Dean. Sam awkwardly shook Lucifer's hand trying his best not to flinch. Sam has had some harrowing and traumatizing experiences with their Lucifer that he would not like to re-visit.
They all remained silent because nobody knew what to say.
Dean had simply shrugged and muttered a small, "I know it's fucking years ago, but it still reminds me of the crack of the whip I would hear before-"
Cas rolled his eyes and snuggled close to Dean like he normally would. Every time their skin brushed, Dean felt the immense heat travel through his body and all along his nerves. Cas looked up, still perplexed.
Sam hesitated before going, "Dean, you hurt him, pretty bad." Dean held his breath, falling into a cold silence.
Dean refused, "I'm good, Cas."
Sometimes Love- UNSECRET and Chuck Adams
"Have we met?" Cas asked, puzzled.
huh?"
Are you
"Reality happened, Cas! Life happened! This is the cold hard truth and if you're too much of a wimp to face it, then fucking leave! I don't give a rat's ass if you don't care about me anymore, I won't let these people walk to their deaths, especially,
-------------------
When Dean and Cas stumble upon some familiar faces, things take a sudden change.
"If by fun you mean nearly causing the end of the world, TWICE, then yeah it's brilliant!" Dean said sarcastically as he chugged down his drink.
Dean pulled Cas's hands away, "No. Come on, I probably deserved that for being a dick to you. But you fought through her bullshit mind control, Cas.
Dean was stumped like his feet were drilled into the ground. He looked at Cas, speechless because Castiel had never been so openly intimate around him.
worry about you, Cas. But yeah- you're right. I'm sick of the fighting too. It's so fucking exhausting fighting with you. I'm sorry for being a shithead, or as you call it, an assbutt." Cas's lips curved into a gentle smile, relaxing his shoulders.
"Dean, this entire thing is
When they walked back to the Impala, Cas interlocked his fingers into Dean's silently and neither of them said a word. Cas was right. They were already home.
"Oh, come now, you can't fool me, I'm the devil after all," Lucifer grinned widely, "You didn't see the way he looked at you when he was breaking apart your soul for the spell. To see you in that much pain was torturous to him. And trust me,
"What else did I say?" Dean asked, eyes focused on Cas.
"And I was, Cas. I know you don't trust him, I don't either, but let's give the guy a chance okay?" Dean replied calmly.
Dean watched Castiel turn his back on him and walk up the sturdy stairs. It was almost too painful to watch. Cas opened the door to exit the bunker, and Dean was still frozen into his spot. Cas said he wanted to move on and walked right out. Dean was starstruck and hadn't been expecting this at all. Cas was the one person he was so sure would stick around until the end, but Dean had broken the angel in ways that he couldn't even fathom.
"Fuck, Cas, I know! I know no matter what I say it will never be enough because I fucking broke you! This is why you should have never cared for me in the first fucking place!" Dean yelled.
"So what I'm getting from this is that Castiel and yourself are Jack's parents?" Lucifer asked closing the menu. A waiter came by asking for their orders. Dean ordered his usual and while Lucifer was tempted to try one of their daily specials. The waiter scribbled their order down giving Lucifer an ominous look before leaving.
Cas pursed his lips, nodding, "we're good." He weaved Dean's fingers into his.
This picks up after they find the spell to re-open the rift.
After a moment of silence, Sam finally found his breath, "Guys what the hell? Lucifer? As in the devil? He's not serious?
"Fucking hell," Dean cursed, bending down to pick up the pieces. He was crouching down, trying to pick up a small glass shard.
He hung up to find Cas on the phone with a raised voice.
"How's Cas holding up?" Sam asked Dean as they ate their meals in the diner.
"I'm not asking for a massive speech, Dean. I need to know exactly how you feel so I can work this out with you. I need to know where we stand," Cas was so gentle and careful when he spoke as if Dean could shatter any moment. Cas saw Dean was very uncomfortable with all of this. He took Dean's hand and kissed the back of it. It was a small and simple gesture but to Dean, it said so much. Dean looked at Cas, and then looked at the roses, and looked back.
"Hell yes, I do. But I wanna ask, what did my soul feel like? Do souls even feel like anything? Am I making sense? Because I feel like I'm just talking shit," Dean asked, and his words slurred a little.
Cas took a long breath, "you're afraid of him."
"Don't you
"What?"
Cas sighed, closing the papers and stashing them away. He pulled Dean into him, as he leaned against the edge of his desk.
"What about Dean? Will you look after him like you looked after us?" Clarissa asked, twisting her head up to smile at Dean.
"Yeah, I didn't ask them to call me that, it kind of just happened," Cas shrugged.
Castiel answered on the first ring.
"Hey! Wait!" Dean called out.
"Isn't that what you've always wanted?" Dean said, exasperated and frustrated.
"Cas- I-" Dean stuttered because it was much harder for him to get those stupid little three words out than it had been for Cas.
Dean kicked off his boots, hung up his wet jacket, stripped to his boxers, grabbed a clean towel and started cleaning the water off him. He went up to Sam, still in his boxers, and slammed the picture down on the surface of the table where Sam was intensively doing some research on his laptop.
Castiel looked at Dean dead in the eye, "Yes."
"They'll heal on their own don't worry," Castiel said quickly sensing Dean's stress. Dean made his way to the front to face Castiel with a cheeky grin on his face.
There was an instant reply.
"Do I know you? You look very familiar," Dean said, examining the man up and down a frown forming on his lips. The man was maybe an inch or two shorter than him but he was attractive. The man had a small stubble, kind eyes, and wore a coat over his suit and piercing blue tie that was the wrong way around.
Cas nodded in response, "So if we finish the story and get our happy ending, do we get to go home?"
"We'd pay you but all the jewellery we had is gone," Sam said slowly.
The rift in the universe glowed like a beacon for danger. Even though the pure existence of the Winchesters was enough to bring danger upon themselves, they were about to make things even worse. I mean who's surprised?
Cas rolled his eyes before saying, "I'm serious, Dean. You deserved better than that."
"Hey, would ya look at that," Dean grinned. Cas watched Dean's smile grow brighter and could help himself from smiling too. Dean sighed, now suddenly exhausted, like his fatigue was hitting him all at the same time. He put his head to Cas's chest, muttering a small "goodnight" as he passed out.
The two men arrived back at Lucifer's place with Dean going, "still can't believe you own this entire place dude."
Sam and Dean stumbled across a case, three dead teenagers and the attackers had no recollection of what happened to them, all of them had woken up with their hands drenched in blood. Sam thought it was demons, Dean thought it was witches but there were no traces of sulfur nor hex bags.
"I couldn't save them," Cas said slowly.
Dean knew Cas was healing him, any internal injuries the ritual left him with, Cas was already healing him. And for the first time in his life, he felt something else. There was a weight blanketing him and him only. Dean could have even sworn he saw a shadow of Castiel's broken wings that were wrapped around him.
"Nevermind, that's a whole different conversation for another day. You need to rest, Dean," Cas told him.
"Dean, calm down and breathe. You're going back into old habits again. Don't change your frustration into anger. Just breathe," Cas said gently. Cas knew all of Dean's habits- the good, the bad, and the ugly.
Dean couldn't help but laugh, "It's alright Ella. It's- complicated but Jack is my adopted son."
Sam entered the tent, with a questioning look.
"How are you holding up Dean?" Cas asked.
Dean was exhausted like all his energy had been drained. There was a light irradiating the horizon, indicating the sun was about to haul itself out of the sea of city lights. He pulled the angel into a hug and buried his face into Castiel's neck.
That night the moon was full and bright. Dean stared out the balcony gazing out at city lights below them. LA was beautiful but even more so during the night when the city was alive and thriving.
Cas seemed to sense Dean's anxiety too, "What time is it?"
Dean took a deep breath in; it was inevitable. But after a pause, he nodded. It was the only way to end the story and go back home.
"Cas, are you okay?" Jack asked. Castiel felt Dean's trauma pushing down on his chest. He couldn’t see any of Dean's traumatic memories, he just felt the strain of it all.
Dean looked up disconcerted, "What?"
"Oh… demons… wait…
Dean gulped, trying to keep the acids and the bile down in his stomach, "I remember you breaking my heart."
They entered the booth and a young attractive waitress with gorgeous wavy black hair approached them.
Dean grumbled and sank into his chair, "You have his number?"
Dean yawned and stretched his arms, pulling them up. He dried his hair as best as he could, turned off his lights and plunged into the pillow- drifting off to sleep the moment his head crashed into the soft fabric.
Eileen rolled her eyes at Dean, "well yes, but it's beautiful!" She signed as she spoke.
for his family. He damn well fought for
Dean nodded, "I can't do this." And Cas knew why without even having to say anything. Cas bridged the empty gap between them and Dean subconsciously put his hand on Cas's waist. Cas looked out the balcony, the moon shining so bright enough to illuminate the town below. He looked back at Dean.
"You guys are okay?" Dean asked, checking the girls up and down.
me right now? So what, all you people are going to just sit there and watch this
"You guys have powers now?" Dean asked, grabbing his bottle of beer. Magnus looked at the bottle and squirmed.

Leading the pack- Sam Tinnesz
Cas turned around first, "Dean, why are you awake?"
Castiel said.
Sam sighed, shaking his head, "I hate all of this so much. Cas is the last person who should be going through this."
"Cas, Cas fucked up."
John took another bite out of his chicken before saying, "So, what I'm getting from this, is that you and Dean are almost like Jack's parents?"
But Cas, completely ignoring him, stepped forward. Dean quickly grabbed his hand, pulling him back.
"I get it now. I get you're scared. About losing me. About losing this fight. I get it, Cas. I'm not gonna ask more from you, I've already asked too much. Just- let's not fight okay?" Dean asked trying his best to be truthful no matter how difficult it was, "We need to focus on the fight ahead and we work better as friends anyway."
Cas shrugged, with a gentle smile, "maybe you can start by taking me out for lunch? I'm getting a bit hungry over here."
"They're maggots. We use insects to determine the time of death," Ella said showing Jack more pictures. Jack's eyes went wide as he went through the pictures he knew he probably wasn't allowed to see.
Dean watched Cas turn on his heels, and their eyes met after avoiding each other for a whole week.
"You, me, dinner," Lucifer said directly to Dean. Dean, completely thrown off, stuttered, "what?" Dean wanted to kick himself in the head, Dean Winchester doesn't stutter.
what's going on?" Cas asked, his voice shaking with the nerves. People around them talked in hushed voices wondering who this mysterious man was. The music continued and people began to disperse around them but some still confused. Dean could hear the whispers. The ladies seemed jealous and baffled by this unexpected guest.
Dean sighed,
“This is about what happened between us that day, isn’t it? Your body isn’t reacting well to all this stress, pain and trauma. Does Sam know?” Cas asked.
"Rosaline and Maria didn't come back last night. Henry found Maria's corpse, but we don't know what happened to Rosaline," Inias said.
Cas sighed, "I don't want you passing out tomorrow. Rest for like 4 hours, if anything happens I will wake you up, otherwise, I'll watch over you."
"Oh, he went off to find his friend, Maze. She's a demon," Dean said opening the first page.
Castiel and Sam entered the apartment swiftly; Cas almost jogging to keep up with Sam's long legs.
"I never let myself open up, or let myself be happy because every time I did that in the past, people I love would get ripped away from me. And Cas, I couldn't lose you. It was easier to yell at you because you were the closest to me. It was easier to blame you than to admit that- I- I fucked up. I let my anger and my head control me, and fuck- I'm a shit person I know. And I know I don't deserve you. Nobody does. I don't want you to think, I hate you. Because I really don't. I could never hate you, because like you said, I care too damn much about you too."
The witch smirked, magically transforming a wooden stick on the ground into a glorious silver sword to match Sam's one. She used her magic, levitating the sword in the air pointing it at Sam. Sam dodged attacks by the bewitched sword smoothly but he was quickly losing ground as the witch stood there not moving a single muscle, making her magical sword do all the work. Dean cursed as he hurried to Sam's aid. Dean swung his sword maliciously, both brothers fighting side by side against a witch. That sounded more like Sam and Dean. Dean thrust his sword forward putting his weight into it, and Sam attacked from the side. But this was an
Cas looked at Dean as they walked away from the building.
Dean was going through a mix of emotions, both anger and sadness, "you are NOT our weapon. You are NOT a tool. You're an angel. You're- you're my friend. Fuck, Cas, where the fuck did we go wrong? Cas, I need you. Now more than ever. I need you fighting by my side. The last time I left you in this god awful place, you got mind controlled by Naomi, I am NOT leaving you again."
"Who the hell are you?" Dean ordered.
"Cas said he's scared he'll lose me again if we become… you know… that. He said he wanted to work things out and then he flipped and said it won't work between us and I just don't know," Dean said, throwing his hands in the air.
"Alright Cas, go get some rest. Here, have some food," he threw the paper bag to Cas, "I'll take over."
"I've missed you too. I'm so happy I found you," Cas mumbled.
The detective rolled her eyes at Lucifer before saying, "Well only a few months ago I didn't even know angels and demons even existed so is this
"Oh, sorry to disturb you," Jack said backing away.
Dean's mind raced.
"Commander, how is he?" He asked.
but there's still tension between us. Human emotions are too complex for me, honestly."
"You're okay," Sam breathed and pulled Dean into a tight, bear hug.
"I know. Shall I tell you a story?" Cas asked.
Sam nodded, "Yeah okay. Goodnight, Dean." Sam left hesitantly, leaving Dean alone with his thoughts which was usually never a good idea. Dean went out to his balcony, staring at the town below him. Sam didn't get to finish his sentence earlier, but he knew what his brother was going to say. The story usually ends in a kiss or a wedding. Dean didn't want to think about that now. This was
Dean's head screamed.
Dean and Cas walked out of the elevator. Cas looked disheartened.
Cas grinned, "I've lived a very long life, Dean. I have learnt to be patient. I could wait for you for another thousand years if I had to."
Dean sighed, "Honestly, well... I think
Having an angel rip away a small piece of your soul isn't something you can come back from easily and Dean Winchester is about to find out the hard way.
Once Cas's shirt was off and Dean had spent several minutes admiring the angel's chest, Dean's hands tugged on Castiel's trousers, starting to undo his belt. Cas stopped him hesitantly.
"Dean, I never imagined this would happen when I did what I did. I didn't think we would even become this close. Or that I would even still be alive," Cas said inaudibly.
. At this point, there was nothing to throw up. But every time he thought about Cas, his stomach stirred threatening him.
and watched Sam just leave the door with a slam. Castiel smiled as he sat on the edge of the bed.
"You're an angel aren't you? But you're not from around here…" Lucifer said observantly. Dean watched the exchange between the devil and the angel.
Dean's stupid grin grew even more as he said, "a 1967 Chevy Impala."
Cas clenched Dean's shirt with his fists and pulled Dean closer to him.
"I'm gonna go check where everyone went. They can't have all just disappeared," Sam said eyeing Dean. Dean nodded in agreement, "we'll join you in a bit Sammy." And with that, Sam left.
-------------------
"I know I said this before, but seriously Cas, thank you for saving my life," Dean said in a light-hearted manner but the angel would see how Dean genuinely meant it.
"He can if he wants to."
"Dean-" Dean was out the door before Cas could get another word out. There was a powerful demon roaming around, possibly tracking Dean and now the hunter just left because he had to bring up all that darkness again.
Cas took one of the clean towels and cleaned the blood off Dean's chest and the rest of his body. He kicked off Dean's shoes and took off his pants leaving him in his boxers. He pulled up the covers over the hunter, watching him as he slept soundlessly.
"I can't believe you searched for a whole year," Dean said, closing the gap between him and his angel.
“I know,” Cas muttered.
. You're a distraction to Castiel, and we can't afford any distractions," David said, his eyes flickering down to the ring on Dean's finger, "Here is a list of all people who signed to kick you out."
"I love you too, you take good care of everyone, alright?" Cas asked, beaming.
it felt.
Dean sighed, kicking off his slippers and rested his head on the pillow, "Weird. Very weird. I think the only normal thing was watching you kill a witch."
"You mean when he's distracted with
"Cas, you gotta see something," Sam said. Cas immediately rushed out and found Inias, who was kneeling over a corpse.
"I mean there's the servant Castiel, but he couldn't have gone to the ball, your highness," The step-mom said, waving her hand.
"Well that was certainly something," Sam said with a sigh, "I need a beer and a week of sleep."
"Wait Cas," Dean jogged to catch up, "Your wings, will they heal?"
"Hey, did you talk to Cas?" Sam asked, making his coffee.
"We'll talk later. Come on," Sam took the lead as they walked trying to avoid fighting as much as they could. Dean interlocked his hands with Cas, quickly realising how Cas's shoulders relaxed at his touch. Dean and Cas got into the back of the jeep, with Sam squeezing in along with some others. Cas was pushed up against Dean, but he didn't complain. Dean put an arm above Cas resting it on the back of the seat, so Cas leaned into his chest.
-------------------
It's supposed to be a replica of my mother's ring. You don't deserve Cas. He loves with his entire friggin' heart and soul, and this is how you repay him. You know, Cas and I might not agree all the time. We fight teeth and claw with each other, but at least I know what he's worth. He's worth
you."
"Dean, why are we in LA?" Sam asked worried and starting to panic. It was a replica of the Los Angeles they were all too familiar with.
"Dean what are you doing here? You have to go, you have to-" Sam stopped and his eyes trailed to a figure behind Dean. Dean's skin went cold as he reached for the gun he left on the ground.
-------------------
(contains spoilers!!)
"Dean?" Castiel's voice broke. Dean turned around to see the angel,
"Damnit!" Dean said. Sam immediately went to check on the men.
"I don't understand."
"Dean, what are you doing here? You should go," Cas said, closing the door. Dean reached a hand out and caught the door just in time before it shut.
"Yeah pretty much. I used to hate the kid because I mean when you say Lucifer's son you don't tend to think rainbows and sunshine, you know? But Cas trusted him with his life and hell, I trust Cas. He turned out to be alright," Dean looked down his smile fading. Castiel's death when Jack was born was still one of the worst memories he had stored in all the trauma in his mind.
"What if something happens to you?" Dean asked, worried.
"Dean, I know you didn't mean any of it," Cas said slowly.
The city was unexpectedly quiet and calm. Lucifer was about to order a taxi back when a man at the other side of the street yelled out his name, "LUCIFER!"
Dean felt like he got slapped across the face. He was slowly starting to remember. Vague memories and snippets of him yelling at Cas in the bunker. The look of absolute shock and betrayal on the angel’s face. Castiel on his knees begging, Cas with a bloody face, Dean punching him, all that anger, regret, the pain just ripping out of his fist and into the angel’s face. And then he took the blade, pushed Cas down to the floor between his legs, and ripped his shirt apart. Dean remembered moving the angel blade down Castiel's chest hard enough to leave a trail of blood behind. The hunter closed his eyes, shaking his head.
"I always am."
Dean shrugged, "he's our best friend, well the ONLY friend we've got."
Dean asked. He subconsciously put his hand on the angel's back and Castiel recoiled.
"Let's go," Dean said. Cas nodded, and silently followed him through the forest. Dean didn't bother making conversation as he normally would, and he kept a few steps ahead of Cas. Being in purgatory was difficult for them, but they put their differences aside to complete the task.
"I mean, I know you've always liked flowers and bees and shit like that," Dean laughed.
All the love,
They sent out a second team of three skilled fighters to find out what happened. In the afternoon, Jody received a call. Once the call ended, Sam and Dean stared at her.
Cas gave him a look that was all too familiar. Purgatory had not been kind to them. Cas had spent a year running from monsters trying to keep them away from Dean. And Dean had spent a year running towards the same monsters in hope of finding his angel. Dean's faith in Cas had never wavered. His faith in their friendship had never faltered. But this time, everything was different. Dean and Castiel weren't on the same page anymore. Dean couldn't even find it in himself to
Dean nodded, "I know, it's just- this is different, Sammy." After a long pause, Dean continued, "do you ever feel like someone is missing in your life? Like there's something you're supposed to look after, protect, love, to
"This ain't no trap," Dean gritted his teeth, "that fuckhead has him, hasn't he?" Cas nodded, biting his lips.
Sam laughed, looking at Dean who was wearing his baggy shirts, "yeah you're probably right. You'll be okay?"
On My Own- Ashes Remain
Dean groaned, "He won't talk!"
Dean felt Cas's shoulders move up and down as he laughed.
Cas gave Dean a very exhausted look, "don't play with my feelings, Dean. I deserve better."
Castiel burst open the door to Dean's room and found Dean gripping the sheets in his sleep, yelling "NO, DON'T DO THIS!" at the top of his lungs. His knuckles were going white and tears were crawling out. Anyone who knew Dean fucking Winchester knew that this man did not shed tears, even if Death herself asked him to.
"Well, you know what I'm like- tough as a rock," Dean said, still extremely tired and out of it.
Dean sighed and let his heavy head fall into Castiel's chest.
Sam sighed, "I will in a sec. I just- it's hard to fall asleep sometimes."
Song for the chapter:
"Dean, I don't know how we can get out of here," Dean was all too familiar with Castiel's "I-need-10-years-of-sleep" look.
"Someone's got moves," Dean laughed. Cas shook his head a little. The clock struck midnight, Cas whipped his head up in a panic, letting go of Dean's hands. He turned and sprinted away, quickly, muttering an apology. Dean sighed watching Cas frantically find the exit. Dean looked down to find a note laying by his feet. He picked it up and opened it to read
"My powers don't work in this universe but this lady was in trouble! I couldn't not do anything!" Cas fired back.
Dean spent the next week, trying to take Cas’s advice and heal. He didn’t even know where to start. Cas went on more hunts with them, but he was still reluctant and hesitant when approaching Dean. Sam never asked what happened between them, but he supported Dean whole-heartedly. Dean made sure to never raise his voice, even when he got pissed off again, and it helped. He kept his temper under check, although that was much easier said than done. Cas was right, he didn’t throw up again. He smiled and nodded, and did his best to act normal around Cas, and Cas started to ease up to him as well. It was a slow and painful process, but healing couldn’t be rushed.
"Here, let me see," Cas said, taking Dean's hand.
Dean was starting to settle down but it was difficult. Loud noises shook him, bright lights made him panic, and he was always on edge. Sam noticed that Dean was more jumpy than normal, but decided not to bring it up. Sam looked after Dean while they waited for Cas, he brought Dean up to speed with everything he missed over the past year.
angel, and he's my other half. He always has been. We never stopped fighting for each other, even when the world went to hell. That's why Cas is special. He
They went through with the plan, Isabelle and Jace going through the front entrance, loud and proud. Jace used his cockiness to his advantage, annoying and challenging the demon. The rest of them entered from the back. Magnus didn't need to do any spell to track Dean because Dean was laying on his knees right in the middle of the warehouse, blood dripping down his bare chest. Sam grimaced as he saw his brother injured yet again, but Castiel just felt pure anger. They hid behind the shelves at the back, peeping through the gaps to watch what was happening.
"Dean!" Castiel immediately went over to Dean shaking him. Dean didn't wake up but his screaming subdued.
Sam, Dean and Jack remained quiet trying to absorb the information being thrown at them. Dean turned around scratching his head, pacing back and forth nervously.
Dean bit his lips. They were really gonna do this five in the morning, huh?
Sam saw the way Dean put a gentle hand on Cas's shoulder in agreement. Sam loved how much Dean has changed in the past few months. Before he was so closed off and distant but after spending an entire year alone, fighting monsters on his own, Sam could tell something had clearly changed. Dean was now more open. And that was proven by the way Dean openly backed up Cas just then. Sam had never been more proud of his brother, even if the circumstances were shitty and stacked up against them.
"I never wanted this for you. Life out there, in the streets, it's harsh and cold and bloody," Dean muttered.
"He used his grace, Cas has a few tricks up his sleeve," Dean said, careful not to mention the stuff with the wings. He wasn't sure if Cas would appreciate him telling their friends about all that. Claire didn't seem convinced but she dropped the topic, waving a goodnight before Dean went off to his room.
Cas walked up to Dean until he was standing right beside him. Cas took the spatula out of his hand and pushed him to the side, “You’re a hopeless case, Winchester. Scoot over so I can make you a real breakfast.”
"I'm gonna go out. I have some shit to take care of. Be back later," Lucifer sang, as he waved and exited.
Dean frowned trying to make sense of everything Sam was saying but he obliged.
Dean's bit his lips. Telling Cas how he felt was one thing but sleeping with him was something else.
Sam nodded again, pulling out his phone, "Just… just be gentle, Dean. You don't remember him, but he remembers you. He cares for you in a way I've never seen with anyone, Dean. Don't hurt him, don't yell at him or get pissed. Being away from you is hurting him more than you'll know."
"Yeah, crazy huh? I'll text Cas to get his ass over here," Dean said, pulling his phone out and typing furiously.
Dean's eyes flickered open.
Cas glared at him, "oh, because Earth is?"
"How did he even know I was alive?" Dean asked.
Castiel carried Dean Winchester out of the scary dark basement in his arms, bridal-style. Dean's head lolled onto Cas's chest.
Lucifer choked on his bourbon, "what?!"
Song for the chapter:
"Hmm… that's great, Cas. Stay with me," Dean murmured, before completely passing out. His head rocked back and forth and then fell onto Castiel's shoulder. Cas knew this was bound to happen so he wrapped his left arm around the human, while his eyes never left Dean, making sure he was going to be okay.
Dean froze when he realised the L-word had slipped out.
The second Friday, Dean picked Tombstone because Sam and Eileen hadn't seen it yet. Dean had already made Cas watch it before, so Cas stood up to leave and get more popcorn halfway through the movie. When he returned, he gave one bowl to Sam and the other to Dean. He sat closer to Dean this time, Dean noticed. Cas reached out to the bowl to get some popcorn, and his hand brushed against Dean's very quickly. Dean became unnecessarily flustered muttering a small "sorry". Cas just smiled and waved it off.
"But you're not going to listen to him right?" Dean asked.
"Thank you Dean." Castiel turned to face him for the first time and met his eyes before leaning over and embracing him in a hug. Dean quickly returned it and relished the warmth that radiated from Castiel's body. "I'm sorry I didn't believe you." Dean heard Castiel's voice breaking. "When I-I say you two, I-I j-just got s-so-"
"I'm a prefect, not many people like us."
"Don't come in! I was getting in the shower! I'm naked!" Castiel quickly shouted before Dean had the chance to unlock the door.
"You know I could help you out Cas."
"I'm not lying!" Dean braced himself. "Dude-just hear me out-"
"No, of course not, I don't want to work as an office runner for the Ministry."
"It'll be okay." He murmured to himself before descending the staircase to the common room and freezing in place when he looked over to see Dean pinned down onto the couch by his fellow prefect Lisa Braeden. Castiel felt a strange rush of emotions such as jealous and hurt wash over him and tears threatening to form in his eyes. Lisa had positioned herself above Dean and was passionately kissing him by the fireplace, and Castiel shook his head as he felt his heart could burst and quickly stormed through the common room and to the main door before opening it and slamming behind him while hearing Dean shout "Cas!" from behind him.
"Yes. I've seen Castiel." Her voice was cold when she turned to face him. "Have you?"
Dean felt his chest warm up at Castiel's offer but he managed to keep a straight faceand nod. "Yeah, sure. I'll explain it to Charlie in the morning." Dean watched Castiel stand up and then glanced at the sofa. "But Cas, I could always sleep on the couch, I don't want to take up your bed."
"Yes, as always." Castiel sighed. Dean Winchester has been his best friend since his fourth year. He'd known of the Gryffindor since the first time they'd been sorted in their houses four years ago. Dean was a bright-eyed Gryffindor and Castiel was a nervous Hufflepuff. Dean hit it off with every girl in a ten foot radius whereas Castiel's only friend at the time was his older brother Gabriel-the only brother that was ever remotely kind to him.
"Cas? You in there?" It was Dean's voice in the other room.
"Well." Dean knew that Castiel's family was a touchy subject, so he didn't push any more information out of his best friend. "I better get going if I want to make it back to my room, the Fat Lady told me she wouldn't let me in past curfew if I was late again." Dean stood up and looked at the clock. "Shit, three minutes." He cursed as he knew he probably wasn't going to make it.
"Agreed." Dean nodded.
"I like you Dean." He murmured barely audible.
"Castiel you need to start thinking about your future. It's bad enough that you were sorted into the worst house, you need to prove that you're actually cut out for the Ministry." Micheals voice harshly scolded from the fireplace and a disappointed sneer could be seen in the embers.
"Castiel you will join us at the Ministry and you will stop with this Auror nonsense!" As Micheal yelled the flames from the fire rose drastically and Castiel had to back away to avoid getting burned.
I know she's had a crush on me for a few years now, but I've never really been interested-especially after the love potions and shit. I really shouldn't have underestimated her and what she would do when we sat down, and I heard you coming down the stairs and was going to leave when she pounced and started kissing me-dude I was so shocked I only heard your footsteps before the door shut. And I swear Cas, as soon as you slammed that door I pushed her off me and ran after you." Dean desperately willed Castiel to meet his eyes. "I looked for you in the hallways, then I had to ask Charlie where you were to find you. Dude, Lisa means nothing to me, she's just another girl with a silly little crush. But Cas, you and I have history together, we're best friends." Dean finished hopefully.
"Shh. It's okay Cas." Dean interrupted him and rubbed circles into his friend's back. "It's okay, but why did it bother you so much Cas?" Dean asked while continuing to comfort his friend.
"Woah Cas, this is all yours?" Dean turned to Castiel who was putting his robe on a hook on the wall.
"Castiel, do you remember when we have night duties-?" Lisa had turned to face him and a look of realization crossed her face. "Dean? Dean Winchester?" She instantly placed her book down and stood up with a flushed face. "I didn't expect to see you here."
"Yes, but I'm practically broke until then, and I want to get Gabe something for his birthday."
"Do not raise your voice with my Castiel." Micheal's voice had an edge to it this time and the flames of the fireplace sparked angrily.
"Gabe isn't influencing my decisions, you are!" Castiel fumed.
"What the hell do you want?" Spite dripped off his words.
"I guess that helps ease my tension a bit, I was sure people hated me for being a prefect." Castiel had taken off his tie and shoes and was left in nothing but his button-up and his black slacks.
"Sorry if I picked the wrong side of the bed, I saw your wand over there so I figured that's where you normally slept." Dean spoke up and Castiel forced himself to face his friend.
Dean looked down at the large king bed and pondered for a moment what side he should take, he didn't want to steal Castiel's favourite side of the bed-if he had one like most people do. He then noticed where Castiel had placed his wand and decided that he should take the other side of the bed, so before Castiel came out of the bathroom Dean slipped into the large bed and stayed on the edge of the mattress.
"Stop letting our brother influence your decisions." Michael commanded.
"Shit Cas, you need some help in there?" Dean reached for the doorknob and found it locked.
"No, just hear me out Cas, that's all I'm asking. If you still hate me after I explain myself then-then I'll never bother you again." Dean tried to meet his best friend's sapphire eyes but he refused to do so and only nodded in acknowledgement to Dean's request. Dean then sat down and motioned Castiel to sit beside him to which Castiel did silently and without meeting Dean's eyes. "Okay, so I woke up when I heard the bathroom door shut. I heard you say 'Fuck!'-which was pretty entertaining to hear you curse honestly-we talked and you got in ht shower." Dean glanced at his friend to see if he other student was still listening and he could tell he was. "So, I got dressed and noticed your robes weren't in the bathroom with you, I figured that you might want to change more privately than in front of me, so I grabbed my wand and went downstairs to wait in the common room for you. When I got down there Lisa was already there and I was going to head back up but then she started talking to me-I didn't want to be rude-so I just kinda humored her and sat down-y'know, figuring you would only be a few more minutes before you came down.
"Dean what are you talking about? These couches are way to small for anyone to sleep on-let alone you." Castiel shook his head. "It's fine, I don't move much in my sleep anyways, it's no trouble." Castiel was oblivious to Dean's reasons for offering to sleep on the couch and he started walking towards his prefect bedroom. Dean silently followed after him and stopped after Castiel opened his bedroom door. Castiel's room was huge and had everything you could ask for to accommodate a single person. There was a bathroom door in the back left, along with a small separate kitchen on the right of the room. A large king sized bed was in the middle of the room and everything in the room was in black and yellow.
"Dean I don't want you to do that." Castiel looked over at Dean who was poking the fire ashes with a stick.
"Uh. I noticed it while we were-um, kissing... Mind if I help you with that, I'm a bit excited too." He motioned to Dean's crotch and moved his hands to reveal the bulging fabric of his pants.
"Same here, although I've heard of your talents before."
"You're a Hufflepuff prefect, you'r the only ones people don't hate."
"Uh-Yeah!" Cas responded quickly.
"You're not lying?" Castiel asked weakly.
"Why? Is the truth too loud for your precious little ears?" Castiel stood up in defiance and turned when he heard a knock on the common-room entrance door. He ignored it and turned back to his brother, the other Hufflepuff prefect probably invited someone over.
Dean looked to see Castiel sitting on the edge of the huge empty tub and felt his heart breaking at the sight of Castiel's broken hunched form. From where he stood he could see a small puddle of Castiel's tears and he noticed Castiel's sad labored breathing.
A look of realization crossed Charlie's face and she only shook her head and started to think. "Okay." She paused as she batted around ideas in her head. "When Cas is upset he always goes to the prefects bathroom on the fifth floor. You need to go explain yourself before he starts overthinking and over-analyzing everything." She pushed him towards the doors. "Go!"
"Yeah! I'm okay, I just slipped and fell." Castiel covered.
Castiel washed his face with cold water and stared up at his reflection in the mirror before letting out a long sigh at the look of it. He shook his head slightly before running his hands through his hair and taking off his pants. Castiel then turned and left the bathroom and paused when he saw Dean lying in his bed. He felt himself blush and avoided Dean's gaze when he turned to him and simply climbed into the bed next to Dean without sayin anything.
"Fuck." Castiel quickly locked the bathroom door and palmed himself through his boxers while trying to keep from making any noise as to not alert Dean in the next room over. God I could kiss those lips, if only he'd-Castiel soon found himself weak at the knees as he released quickly due to him holding himself back for so long. "Fuck!" He let a small cry out and weakly started to pull himself together.
"Don't lie to me!" Castiel yelled while turning around to face Dean.
Castiel glanced at the bathroom door before letting out a deep breath he didn't realize he'd been holding. As he tried to calm himself down he removed his shirt but decided to leave his pants on for now as he was fighting an unwanted buldge in his crotch. Castiel took his wand from his pocket and put in on his beside table just before Dean came out of the bathroom. They both awknowledged each other before it was Castiel's turn to slip into the bathroom.
to think of Cas while whacking it.  He intends to think of Cassidy or Cassandra or whatever the actual fuck her name is, the tasty brunette front-end manager for the B&B they’re currently investigating.  He’s muttering to himself as he stretches out on the bed, blunt fingernails scraping across the front of his jeans just at his zipper, and out the name comes as if it’s the most natural thing in the world.
“So,” Sam says, leaning into Dean’s space far enough that his breath puffs against Dean’s nose, “what do you say, Trouble?”
“What’s wrong?” Castiel began to ask, but as he did so, Dean shifted, and the action result in Castiel pulling in a lungful of air through his teeth in a hiss.
He sounds equal parts concerned and pissed off.
The hand not currently jammed knuckle deep between his teeth to keep moans from escaping clutches at the door handle and Dean jerks his hips as hard as he can manage.  In his head, he hears the gravel of Cas’s voice panting his name, but it’s not the Cas that he sees behind his eyelids, not the Cas that he pictures shaking under the force of his climax as the leather upholstery muffles his moan.  A gruff exhalation bounces around inside Dean’s head and he knows – he’s
Castiel yearned, to his very core, to know this man in every way that existed, and he found himself irrationally hating anyone who possessed the comprehension that he did not. Most of all, he fumed with jealousy of his fallen sister.  The envy of it was like fire in his blood.  An angel, once, who knew Dean Winchester in that most fundamental of ways.  She’d lain with him, had the audacity to place her hand on Castiel’s mark on the man’s body as she took him, and had flung that carnal ownership in the face of not just Castiel but everyone in the barn that night.  She’d known it was Castiel’s print on Dean’s shoulder, as well.  He’d felt the jolt of awareness – both of Dean and of his sister – through his Grace when she touched it, felt the undercurrent of her smug teasing when she kissed him in front of Castiel.  He had respected her once, loved her – insofar as he understood love at the time – not just as the general of his garrison, his commanding officer, but as his sister.  And now he could only flare up with jealousy.
epic poem, specifically
That in and of itself would have been grounds for teasing, but the fact that he tried on three things before settling on his current choices would probably have resulted in at least four jokes about prom and not letting the other teens pressure him into anything he’s not ready for.  That’s what Dean would say if the shoe was on the other foot, and … well, he may not have worked up the guts to go if he’d heard it.  Thankfully, the motel room features blissful silence as Dean considers.  He’s about to throw on the sort of thing he wears every time he goes to a bar: boots, comfortable jeans, shirt that brought out the color of his eyes (because yes, he knows how to work his best feature when he wants to), flannel, leather jacket.  Maybe a teeny bit of product in his hair, pilfered from Sam, to give a little polish.  But he thinks about it this time: that’s the sort of thing he wears when looking to pick up
Dean flew into action, shoving Castiel aside to charge at the vampires, his wicked scythe-like weapon barely sticking a moment as it cleaved through muscle and bone as he hacked away at his opponents.  Dean did not notice, as Castiel had, that one of the combatants had been brought up short as she scanned their faces, her expression dropping into one of great surprise.  The hunter didn’t register that the vampire called out his name, which caused Castiel to drop his hands and tilt his head to the side, taking only an instant to place her in his mind.
in the purgation of converted souls;
"It is a somewhat disturbing mobius strip of reality, isn't it?"
"I can't speak to the dynamic between you and your father," Castiel said gently.
Dean nodded, trying to keep his face stony.  Dean made it out; Cas didn’t.  He knew it was the truth, and yet, the last few hours were making him doubt everything he knew.
Castiel sighed again and Dean couldn’t help clenching his fists around his weapons.
“Sam, this needs to stop; you need to stop.”  He tries to sound commanding but it comes out desperate.
Dean rockets up, and immediately regrets it because damn his muscles feel stiff.  “Nine minutes?!”
The brace across his throat moves back to his chest and Dean gulps in air as inconspicuously as he can.  Before Dean can answer, Cas uses the hand he still has at Dean’s shoulder to shake him a few times, thumping Dean’s head against the wall next to the bathroom door sill.
Dean nodded, as he placed a calm hand on Cas's shoulder, and Cas just very slowly began to relax under his touch. John looked from Dean to Cas and back, trying to fit the pieces together. Dean saw the judgement in his father's eyes and pulled his hand away. Cas sensed that Dean was feeling uneasy beside him, and his anger began to boil.
Dean grinned idiotically, "Oh trust me, sweetheart, you'll understand one day."
"I don't know, Jack. But hey, if anyone can figure this shit out, it's us," Dean said matter-of-factly, "Call Cas and Sam and tell them to get their asses over here NOW." Jack nodded and began calling Sam first.
bad. John looked furious and ready to send his fist flying into Castiel's face.
Dean stared at the ground, moving his feet in his seat uncomfortably, "I was worried."
"As long as you promise to shut up, and keep your shit under the table."
"Dean, you're a full-grown man, not a teenager anymore. You're in control of your life, and your father can't control you," Cas said. Dean stopped pacing and went over to the angel.
"Shut up, Castiel." That was what did it for Cas. Dean never called Cas by his full name unless he was serious unless it was the last straw.
"Alright, I like you," Dean said. Magnus smiled back, amused, while Alec nudged him with his elbow.
"You lot use my father's name too? Unbelievable," Lucifer huffed, rolling his eyes.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Heya, Sammy."
There was something about the way Dean said those words that Cas absolutely detested, "You don't mean that."
Lover- Taylor Swift
Dean brought his eyes back up, "I know you and I are… complicated. But I- uh- look- I need you. Ok, I don't know what it is, but I need you. And every time you go into one of these hunts and something goes wrong, I get so fucking scared, Cas. So maybe I get it. Maybe I get how you feel when I throw myself into danger all the time."
"Other wolves are coming, we need to leave, NOW."
"You know this isn't easy for me. To talk about how I feel and shit like this. But I can't- I can't lose you again. Cas, I just can't."
"Just this once," Cas replied. He kissed Dean again, pushing Dean back against the couch armrest. Cas placed soft loving kisses down Dean's jawline and neck.
Dean and Castiel have a challenging time out on the streets, hunting and surviving together, but it brings them closer than ever... like literally.
Dean stood up, stretching silently, careful not to wake up Jack on the other side of the bed and Sam on the floor.
"WAIT! NO!" One of the daughters squealed.
Dean found the strength to look at Cas, and honestly, Cas's smile was so stunning it took his breath away.
"You're bossy," Dean muttered, still doing as he was told.
The moment the door closed, Cas sighed and covered his face with his hands.
"Dean," Cas said weakly, "Please come here." He was now standing up, hand over the bandage.
Cas gulped, "yes, sometimes angels come down to Earth, fall in love and build lives with humans, although it's forbidden. When they become one, the human can sense the angel's wing presence amongst other things. Our connection must be so strong that you can already sense my wings."
"Do you have any food here?" Jack asked entering the room and Lucifer beamed, "Of course!"
Dean and Cas nodded simultaneously. They both moved their right hand forward without thinking, but it was Cas that spoke out first, "Yes, Rowena found that Michael has started creating hybrids successfully. Decapitation works."
"Can we meet him?" Sam pushed. The two daughters muttered to each other.
Dean found Cas in his room, head buried in maps and files.
Love you goodbye- One Direction
Dean closed his eyes, he didn't want to have this conversation now. He was exhausted out of his mind, his body and muscles ached from weeks of hunting and fighting.
Dean shook his head again, "No I'm okay."
Sam knew what that translated to:
"Wait, Dean, are you sure you guys will be okay?" Sam asked concerned. Dean nodded.
Sam pulled away and explained everything that happened- but just very briefly.
peachy?
evil." He tried to keep his answers short and simple. Dean was just pleased that neither of them had broken into a fight... yet.
"Other than the massive headache I'm experiencing? Yeah, I'm
"Listen, Cas, we don't have all night and we're both drained. If there's something you need to tell me, go right ahead," he was finished.
After a moment of brutal silence, Cas murmured, "because I saw the good in you. I saw why my father had chosen you to be the
Dean and Cas were nowhere to be seen. The sun was finally peeking from the horizon and light poured into the room through the open balcony.
What no one was prepared for, was the massive thunderstorm that struck them that night. They had another day's walk to that new camp everyone was so anxious about but the thunderstorm had come out of nowhere.
"Castiel is an all-powerful being, you are
Dean exhaled like it was a breath he had been holding in for years. He looked up at the ceiling, "please, hear me, Cas. Please, know that I'm so fucking sorry. I'll make this right, I have to. Because the alternative is too fucking shitty. I won't lose you, again."
"Angel grace is like our life force. It's what makes us who we are and gives us our... powers..." Castiel said watching Lucifer watch Dean. He didn't approve of the way Lucifer was eyeing Dean up and down with a shine in his eyes so he took a step towards Dean to make his point. Lucifer's eyes shifted to Castiel with a smirk coated over his face knowing full well what was happening.
"Oh my god," Dean whispered into oblivion. He remembered it all, he remembered everything. And along with that came a throbbing headache.
just kick your leader out? Castiel has given you a home, a place to feel needed and loved, he gave you a sanctuary, he taught you how to fight, how to hunt! Castiel has treated you like family! And you're all just going to abandon him? After everything he has given up for you?"
After strolling through the forest for a few hours, Cas stopped, "Dean, stop. Leviathan."
Dean pulled away, suddenly nervous and scared he fucked up, "sorry I-"
After the ball ended, and they all cleaned up, Sam found Dean checking out his closet. Dean had all sorts of suits for different occasions and his closet was so huge you could probably hide a horse in there.
They stayed in a weird silence for a while. It wasn't awkward or uneasy, but it wasn't entirely comfortable either.
"I know what it's like. The pain you're feeling, I've felt it. I've lost Cas too many fucking times. He got ripped away from me when Michael set the world on fire and I thought everyone died. I'm truly sorry," Dean finished.
Sam and Dean left the impala and entered their motel room, switching on the light to find a bunch of strangers in black clothing and strange weaponry standing before then. Dean pulled out his .45 caliber, and Sam yanked out the angel blade.
After a beat, Lucifer slowly went, "You guys are out of your god damn minds." with the most baffled expression on his face. Lucifer and Jack made eye contact for a split second before Jack turned away.
Dean rolled his eyes overdramatically, "Yeah, well, it was bound to happen. You're like a ticking time-bomb sometimes, man."
"I owe him everything, man."
Sam's eyes went wide. Dean didn't make any further comments, but fast-walked into his room.
"I have loved you for a very long time now, Dean Winchester," Cas said quietly. He put a small hand on the back of Dean's neck. It was weird, touching Cas, being this close and intimate should feel weird, but somehow it felt natural.
"That's bullshit, Cas. This isn't on you. We needed some of my soul for the spell to get back home. It's nobody's fault, you hear me?" Dean said.
Cas knew exactly what Dean meant without him having to say it. Cas ran his hands over Dean's hair with a fond smile.
As it turns out, Castiel and Magnus got along splendidly well. They were both powerful beings, way beyond their time, who were hopelessly in love with a mortal. Alec and Dean talked a bit, Dean didn't like Alec's attitude much but he kept his mouth shut because he knew damn well Magnus would turn him into a frog if he said anything against the Shadowhunter. Dean got alone fine with Jace too. Jace was cocky and stubborn and reminded Dean of his younger self. Isabelle and Clary spoke with Sam, the three of them in a deep conversation about other worlds, and then somehow moved onto talking about weaponry as Isabelle was the weapons master at the New York Institute.
"So how do we get out?" Dean asked.
"He's a real angel, ain't he?" Lucifer laughed. Dean couldn't stop himself from smiling widely. Dean moved his gaze from Lucifer to out to the open illuminated sky.
"Dean, you've got to stop this whole secret flower thing," Cas laughed, watching Dean awkwardly straighten his back.
"Are you fucking
"Magnus? Dean's missing," Cas said, the panic in his voice reaching Magnus.
Dean picked up the note reading,
"Well, for one, I would like my hands back," Dean said laughing when Cas blushed and let go of Dean's hand, "I don't know what's next for us Cas, but one thing I know is that I'm so fucking glad we had this conversation."
"Uh- Cas, you wanna- wanna continue watching the movie? Or go to my room?" Dean asked, breathing fastening with each kiss.
"Seriously guys! I'm not putting other lives at risk like this! Not if there's something else we can do," Dean said, now standing up, his rage and fury taking over in a flash.
"Well, you can hang out here with us, then." Lucifer relaxed his shoulders, "Dear old Castiel was telling me all about you little journeys together."
"Holy shit, dude, that's awesome!" Dean said excitedly.
Cas was still fuming with smoke gushing out of his ears.
"You're an idiot. You didn't let me come with you
"Shut up, you love it," Dean replied just as quick.
Dean went red, "I- uh- I-"
David frowned, this wasn't the answer he expected. Dean went to Cas, while everyone started speaking in hushed voices.
help, instead of laughing," Cas muttered to Dean. The hunter helped him with the food and distributed them to the others.
Another girl stood up, Tatiana, "Cas is our family, and so is Dean!"
"Thank you for healing me, feathers," Dean said quietly, not sure if Cas had gone back to sleep. But then he saw his lips curve upwards.
"I'll do it, without a question," Dean said almost immediately, his head spinning to look at Sam.
"Maybe this time around, it won't be so bad. I'm gonna pass out now, wake me up in 4 hours," Dean said. Cas said goodnight and Dean mumbled something inaudible in return. Dean fell asleep with Cas's wings muddled up in his fingers, and his head on Castiel's chest.
"I don't know what world you come from but we don't have angel 'grace'" Lucifer quoted causing both Sam and Dean to groan dissatisfied.
"What the-" Dean said shocked.
Cas looked at the picture and bit his lips, "Dean. I'm sorry-"
at Cas. Their bond, their relationship was broken.
Cas smirked, “My grace can be used for a wide range of purposes.”
Dean bit his lips nervously, trying not to think about the possibility of Cas dying. He nodded and stitched the skin back together, earning a quiet hiss from Cas. Cas gripped Dean's shoulder tightly, teeth-gritting through the pain. Dean cleaned the rest of the blood and covered the area with some bandages.
look.
It was an early Monday morning, when Sam left the kitchen abruptly, leaving Dean and Cas alone for the first time in a week. Cas stood up, excusing himself ready to leave when Dean mustered up the courage to speak up.
"Step away from him!" Magnus shouted as he waved his hands and streams of golden glittery magic poured out of his hands. The magic tied Hecate up to the point where she couldn't move. Magnus pulled her in and away from Alec and Jace. She fought back but her power was no match for Magnus Bane. Magnus breathed in slowly, sending silent daggers at the demon.
"And there he goes. What did he leave behind?" Sam asked, sipping his wine. Dean gave him the note.
"Guys, we need to talk about this," Sam said entering the room to find his brother and the angel missing. Lucifer had just said a hilarious joke to Jack and they were both laughing, with tears seeping through their eyes.
"I thought- I thought I lost you," Cas whimpered into Dean.
Cas almost choked on his spit, Sam's eyes went wide, and everyone else went dead silent.
"DEAN," Sam bellowed.
"We have a second option?" Donna asked, confused more than anything. Dean felt Cas sending death glares at him, but he ignored it.
"Sam and Castiel will
Jody sighed, "Perhaps." It just dawned on Dean how lucky they got, and how much worse it could have been.
"Cas!" Jack said, wrapping his arms around him. Sam helped himself to a few strawberries on the table.
"Inias back at it again?" Sam asked with a smug expression.
Dean fully collapsed back into the bed, when they were back in his room, still in his robe and his feet hanging over the edge. Cas watched him with a small smile, but he joined, sliding into the covers from the other side.
"No Cas, I mean, I was worried about you," Dean sighed.
"What? I don't get... panic attacks," Dean said.
Dean felt nauseated again, he put a hand to his stomach. Cas frowned noticing something wasn’t quite right. Dean muttered a small “sorry” before hurriedly leaving the kitchen.
“What’s going on with you?” Cas asked, disconcerted.
"Fucking hell," he moaned. He opened his eyes, waiting a moment for his vision to adjust, and saw his angel flipping through one of his books.
The rain started to splatter on the building they were hidden in.
"Was about to ask you that. All good?" Claire asked, "You look like you need to shoot something. Who fucked up this time?"
The morning arose and Dean's headache was gone. He dressed ready for the day, and went to find Sam who had fallen asleep on the table in the library on top of a book he had been reading last night. Dean smiled, gently removed the book, and wrapped his little brother up in a warm blanket. Sam didn't stir. Dean continued the reading.
"No no we have to find a way back to your world," the detective said pacing up and down the room as she does when she's over-thinking.
"Shit, Cas, I thought you died," Dean muttered, pulling away.
"That's exactly why we need you here," Sam said, to which Jody agreed, bobbing her head up and down. Dean wanted to fight back but he wasn't up for a fight with his brother today.
"It's gone. The magic is fully gone. I can't feel it anymore." Just as Castiel said those words, the skies cleared and the sunlight began to slowly peak out. Dean looked up at the illuminating sky above. It was finally over.
After a quiet moment, Cas replied with, "what makes you think that?"
Dean looked at the place the angel had been standing only a few minutes ago.
"He abused you, Dean! I won't let that go unnoticed," Cas snapped, firing silent daggers at Dean.
He looked down at his hand, the place where the cut should have been. Dean squeezed his hands, digging his fingernails into the palm of his hand, trying to feel any kind of physical pain that could distract him from the shithole his mind was twisting into. The pressure he exerting was almost enough to draw blood.
"You won't quit, will you?" Dean asked. Cas glared at him, and Dean stopped trying. They had a small break and then continued their hike to the stream. They encountered more leviathan and other monsters, and they fought teeth and claw for their lives. When Cas couldn't save himself, Dean did and vice versa. They never spoke about Cas's outburst, but Dean was careful with his words. They worked well together and fought well beside each other but the tension was still there. Dean hated it as much as Castiel did.
"Don't worry Cas, I'll be back soon," Dean said giving his friend a good ol' slap in the back before leaving.
"Sam, did I love him?" Dean asked in a very small voice.
"Dean?" Cas asked, rubbing his eyes.
Cas just smiled in return, "Of course, Dean. I'm not judging."
"Yeah. Never better. Thanks to you, of course," Dean said hastily. Cas checked out Dean once over, nodded, and his head fell back into the pillow, eyes closed.
Dean silently prayed.
Dean shook his head.
"Dean, I enjoy what we have going on here. But we can't keep this up. I mean sooner or later you’ll run out of flowers,” Cas joked, “I understand what you're trying to tell me with the flowers, I do. But we need to
Sam finally found the one they were looking for and almost cried with happiness and pain looking at the size of the book.
Dean stretched out his hand, and the man took it, "Jimmy. A pleasure to meet you, Dean." The man, Jimmy, as he called himself, immediately left without even paying for his room leaving Dean very confused and lost. What an odd person.
"I hate this weather," Dean said, fiddling with Castiel's tie trying to distract himself from the light and the sounds.
"Yours don't?" Magnus asked, humorously.
Savin' Me by Nickelback
That morning Cas placed the tulips in the vase alongside all the others. It was a strange mix of flowers and Cas wondered where Dean even got half of them but then decided not to ponder on it. Cas walked into the kitchen to get a glass of water when he saw Dean trying to make breakfast and failing miserably. He was trying to make pancakes, but they were all burnt. Dean was never a good cook, he had taken after his mother. Dean’s comfortable demeanour immediately tensed up when he looked up and saw Cas.
"I didn't mean to violate you," Dean mumbled.
"Yeah, but Cas seems a little more on edge these days. I don't think he likes how much you've been hanging out with Lucifer," Sam said very carefully, afraid he was stepping on a time bomb.
The angel stared at Dean, who was now visibly starting to break down. Cas hated this. He hated seeing Dean hurt and upset, but it was even worse now because he knew it was his fault Dean was in this state.
"Alright, alright. Calm down. Sam's on the way. Get him and get something that belongs to Dean and meet me at the Wendy's near the bookstore," Magnus said, quickly cutting the call.
as his eyes were blinded by lights pouring out the chandeliers. After his eyes had adjusted, he found the staircase with its gold-plated handrails.
"What's going on here?" Dean asked, looking at the angel and the ladies who were huddled together bowing heads over a phone on the table in the middle.
Supernatural never spoke about this issue where Cas had to practice killing fake versions of Dean in s8 and I was so bitter about it so I brought it up here. And a little surprise in the end.
"That's fair," Sam replied.
Dean opened his eyes again.
"Cas and I are just friends- that's it."
"I used most of my grace to try to heal Dean," Cas explained, leaning into Sam for support. Magnus bent down to Dean's eye level. Dean was awake, but his breathing was extremely slow... a little
your guardian angel after all," Castiel said watching Dean the way he does. Dean looked up again and met the angel's eyes.
Cas finally replied with:
Sam looked at Magnus, eyes pleading for help.
"Perhaps later. When I know you're okay," Cas replied. Dean nodded, turning his body so that his face crashed into Castiel's shoulder. Dean shifted closer, draping his legs over Cas's ones. Cas saw the hairs standing up on Dean's skin and realised Dean was cold even though the cool didn't bother him much. So, he pulled the covers up over both of them, watching Dean sigh in relief and pull Cas even closer to him. Cas moved his left hand away so that he could wrap it around Dean's shoulder. He didn't know if Dean was asleep yet, but he tried to heal Dean again. Four ribs down, one more to heal.
is that?" Dean asked worriedly.
Dean snarled at him, "So would you kick your family to the curb as well? Your wives and husbands? Cas is like that. He's my friend, he's
Here's a shadowhunters/spn crossover nobody asked for, bc why not :)
"Um Dean, what happened?" Castiel and Jack who were admiring the view from the balcony turned to find Lucifer pouring them drinks.
Sam came over and shook Dean the same way the angel did, but Dean remained eyes closed, with his chest rising up and down rapidly.
"Wow, honest much Cas?" Dean rolled his eyes and got comfortable.
That night, after Dean was well-rested, they decided there was no reason to delay things any further. Sam mixed all the other ingredients excluding the human soul (keeping that for last) with the help of Cas and Jack. Dean said his final goodbyes to Lucifer, who pulled Dean aside to speak to him privately.
"Cas, we gotta work this out," Dean said, closing the wrapper and remembering not to litter Purgatory.
"Hey, Cas. Can we talk?" Dean asked.
"God damn I KNOW!" Dean said raising his voice. He knew where Sam was going with his and he did not like it one bit.
"Hey, Cas, can we leave?" Dean asked. His voice was suddenly quiet and little. This caught Cas's attention, and he turned to see that Dean had turned white. Cas nodded and left, Dean followed him on his heels.
Dean settled the food down on the small circular table in his room, Cas perched on the chair and began eating. Dean sat opposite Cas, silently waiting.
Dean held his breath, eyes wandering to Cas. Even David was surprised by his answer.
"I'll go," Dean volunteered. Sam stared at Dean and after a moment, shook his head, "No. We'll send some others."
Dean laughed, leaning forward to rest his elbows on his knees and knot his fingers together.  “Yeah, well, that’s a special exception.  We thought you were going to die in less than eight hours.  We didn’t have time for sentimental bullshit.”
The statement hung suspended in the air between them before Dean let out a held breath.
“Dick, Sam.  I like dick,” he repeats.  “I mean, not
Despite the angel’s pleas, Dean kept his strokes along Castiel’s length maddeningly steady.  Impatient, the angel grunted in frustration, and Dean threaded his other arm under Castiel’s head to brace it across his chest like a firm hug, pausing his motions to mutter in the angel’s ear.
“But—” Dean started but Benny had gotten just frustrated enough to nip the argument in the bud.
“Jesus Christ,” Dean mutters and he can’t type fast enough.
“Dean,” he chides, sounding slightly scandalized.  “You can’t kiss me, I’ve just had my mouth—”
“Just get this beginning part over with, Cas,” Dean grunts gruffly.  “I know you’re trying to be gentle and that’s sweet and all, but seriously, just … just get it over with so I can adjust and then we can get to the good shit.”
Little butterflies take flight in Dean’s stomach.  Okay, so
“Jesus Fucking Christ!” he bites out because the tongue moves again, seemingly determined to cover every fucking inch of real estate down the crack of his ass.  Dean is fairly sure that if Cas’s hands weren’t clenched on his skin, keeping him upright and spread open, Dean’s knees would have given out by now and he would have ended up in a sprawled heap on the floor.
Castiel barely even registered the noisy gasp that left his mouth.  He was, however, very aware of the hoarse groan that left Dean’s parted lips when Castiel closed his hand reflexively in surprise, slotting the hard length of flesh into his palm.
“God damn it, Cas,” he growls, slamming his hand against the steering wheel.  “I could have gotten laid tonight.  I could have gotten blown
“God, Cas, Jesus.  I just want to—I can’t—but Christ, I
Dean wriggles against the bed because it isn’t just his cock that needs the friction, the touch; he feels like he’s going to climb out of his fucking skin if he doesn’t get relief, and he needs it everywhere, everywhere.  He can feel the itch for it all over him, as if Cas is really here and raking his nails down every fucking square inch of Dean’s body all at once.  He rolls over onto his stomach, letting the rough scrape of the cheap comforter against his skin scratch at his senses as he thrusts into his fist, burying a moan into the fabric.  Turning his head to the side, he lets the words keep tumbling out.
"You know about that, huh?" Dean coughed.
Before he could even register the brush of Castiel's nose against his, Dean felt the warm, damp pressure of the angel's lips against his own. His hand flew up to clasp Castiel's wrist in his grip, not pulling it away from him but clutching like a lifeline. And before Dean could barely acknowledge that the kiss had happened, it was over.
Cas mumbles approval into Dean’s neck – “Good, Dean; very good” – and then the kisses trail over Dean’s shoulder, down his back, and dart away as Cas’s hands push at Dean’s pants, letting them puddle on the floor at his ankles.  Some rustling at his feet and Cas must have mojoed his clothes somewhere else because Dean is suddenly
A/N - All right, my babies, the moment you've been waiting for ....  Bottom Dean, as promised.
A tiny quirk of lips formed around a slow Louisiana drawl.  “What, no thanks for saving your hide?”
He couldn’t help but stare, dumbfounded, out the window.
Dean’s head snapped up and green eyes locked onto blue.
Panic bangs at his ribcage.  “I don’t know what you—”
Dean groans inwardly, but he can’t find it in him to be mad about it because now the kid is writhing back and forth and it feels so god-damned close to sex, the smell of sweat and booze and body heat making Dean’s head swim.  He clutches at the kid’s inner thighs as Sam moves in Dean’s lap but he chides himself before the kid can do it with another mumbled “Sorry,” even though he’s not sorry in the least.
All in all, it only ate up about 36 hours of time, which is a damn shame because Dean’s still got that itchy unsettled feeling that he did when he came back from the club he other night.  He had hoped that the case would take his mind off the kid at the bar and sexual revelations and most of all Cas, but the distraction proves minimal at best.  Dean’s dragging his feet packing his shit up because there’s a tickle at the back of his mind telling him that despite the fact that he cleaned up after himself this afternoon, something about this ain’t over yet.  He puts in a quick call to Sam and gives him some lame-ass reason to stay in Atlanta another night because he just can’t shake that jittery feeling of anticipation.  Dean’s packed his bag, gassed up his baby, eaten lunch, and field stripped and cleaned the two weapons he used today, but he still feels an adrenaline jolt that won’t let him sit still.  Something’s gaining on him, he knows it, and whatever the hell it is that zip in his spine says it’s a bad-ass motherfucker.  Nothing’s popping up though, so he takes a shower just to give himself something else productive to do.
Dean jumped up to his feet and backed away from Castiel a bit, stumbling over a downed branch.  A moment of manic energy suffused the hunter as he glanced around, searching for Benny.  When Dean realized that they were, surprisingly, alone in the clearing, he stopped pacing to scrub both trembling hands over his face and up to clutch into his hair.
“So I’ll ask you again, Dean,” Cas demands, “what were you trying to accomplish with this little display?”
He fumbles when he reaches for the lube bottle again because he doesn’t want to tear his eyes from the screen.  Not even taking the time to shimmy out of his boxers, Dean maneuvers his cock out through the slit in the front, dousing his hand with way too much lube; he can’t be bothered to care because the angel on his screen writhes and moans and thrusts his hips back against Giant’s face, and Dean bangs his head backward into the wall a couple of times just to give himself something to focus on other than how quickly he’s racing towards coming.  His strokes are fast and uneven, squeezing too hard on some and not enough on others but it doesn’t fucking matter, he feels like he’s going to come in about three minutes flat.  The screen in front of him shows that they’ve gotten down to the actual fucking now, but Dean barely registers it.  Instead, he drops his head back to the wall and slams his eyes shut, unable to help the tidal wave of visions showing Cas kneeling on the bed in front of him, ass up and face buried in the covers as Dean laves his
A rosy blush spreads over Dean’s face, and because he really
“Oh, thank fuck,” he mutters into the trench coat as he drops his head to Cas’s shoulder.  “I thought you were never going to touch my cock.”
Dean’s hands clench and release at his side several times before he can force out the words.
~~ ** Lady Tuesday ** ~~
Not for the first time – nor, he suspected, the last – Benny felt a pull of envy at the intense and thoughtful look the hunter focused in the direction of the retreating angel.  The vampire himself hadn’t been the subject of a gaze like that in decades and seeing it again here in this wasteland made him even more determined to get home and revenge his loss.
The angel’s forearm jumped in his grasp.  Dean propped himself up on an elbow and gazed up into his friend’s face.
Dean may not have been able to see it – still stewing, as the hunter was, in his days-long fury against the third member of their company – but Benny didn’t miss the signs of fatigue that had begun to eke out in the angel.  Whenever fights were over and the world around them calmed for a moment, the vampire glimpsed slumping shoulders, dipping of head and neck, which bespoke exhaustion and bleakness.  The first time he’d seen it, Benny couldn’t help but think that the jumped-up jack ass had brought it on himself, but the longer time went by, the less apt he was to judge.  He’d seen the look before, that expression of weariness of someone just barely holding it together.  The angel was a self-righteous ass, no doubt about it, but there was something more going on there that Benny just couldn’t wrinkle out, but he was certain it had everything to do with Dean and why the hunter’s sudden renewed vigor just happened to correspond with the angel’s slow collapse.
Cas’s reaches out towards Dean’s bag, and with a tiny glance in that direction the small bottle and a foil package just freaking

, even in the solitude of his thoughts.  When had this temporal collection of cells become a flesh manifestation of his being instead of the transportation ewer that his training and very nature told him that it was?  That it
Thank you SO MUCH to all the people who have read, reviewed, given kudos, or commented.  Seriously, it gives me life.
Dean bites down on the inside of his cheek, deciding how far to go with this.  Flicking his eyes to and from the road as he moves with the traffic he thumbs out a response.
~ Canto XXVI, lines 82-84; 88-89
Stayed tuned for Friday's update.  Can't wait for you to see it!  <3
Dean stretched back swiftly and caught Cas’s wrist before it disappeared from his side into the folds of that stupid trench coat.  Without wasting any more time, Dean gently tugged the angel’s arm back in place, relaxing into sleep only after he felt Cas’s steady breaths on the back of his neck.
“I scoured the countryside for you, half out of my mind, when I found out you were alive; I traveled across the world to help you rescue Sam.  After everything we’ve been through, questioning my devotion at this point is almost as insulting as it is ridiculous.  But you seem to forget at the most convenient moments that I have other obligations, Dean, and that I am not some pithy being designed to be at your beck and call.”
“Jesus, that has to be the sexiest thing I have ever seen in my life: you on your knees with my cock in your mouth, looking up at me with those eyes.  You’ve got the most perfect eyes I’ve ever seen in my life.  I swear, Cas, I’ve never had to try so hard
Dean looked up from where he had started to slowly orbit the clearing again and caught sight of Cas as he traversed the inner circle empty of trees.  Watching the angel as he moved about the space, eyes closed, palms gently raised as he mumbled something in a language Dean could neither hear nor understand, Dean felt struck to the core.  Whatever it was that pulled at him, pulled him towards this being, felt like it was anchored behind his heart and he needed to either just let go and be reeled in or swing out a knife and cut the rope altogether.  Every single fear and years of training told him it would be safer just to cut bait; he could easily say or do something just dismissive and cruel enough to make it clear to Cas that the line was drawn between them, and no matter what other instincts Dean had, he wouldn’t step across.
Castiel raised an eyebrow.  His friend aimed at a joking tone of voice, but a note of something harder lingered behind it.  “If you are referring to sexual intimacy, then yes,” he said flatly.
“Of course you are,” he murmured.
“Cas, please,” he groans, jerking when Cas brushes his prostate again.  “Please stop, Cas. I can’t take it anymore.  Please—”
Because Dean is Dean, he can’t resist: “Yeah, all seven and a half of ‘em.”
That claim was easier to believe at night.  After the few first evenings of requesting Castiel’s presence at his side, Dean seemed to reconcile himself with the decision and simply operated on the assumption that he would not be sleeping alone.  The hunter would remove his leather jacket as he descended to the ground, folding it into a longer shape than previously, with room enough to pillow two heads rather than just his own. Dean would stretch out at one side and silently wait for Castiel to settle on the other.  For the first few evenings, Dean laid out on his back, staring blankly up into the canopy above, his face carefully blank, until Castiel rested beside him; only then would the creases born of anxiety and stress of the day relax and disappear from Dean’s face and he would allow his eyes to drop closed.  Sometimes the hunter would murmur to Castiel as he calmed his vessel into a meditative state, softly babbling about memories of their shared experiences, postulating theories of what might be going on back on Earth.  On the nights that Dean felt compelled to talk, Castiel simply listened, a quiet hum of breathing being his only noises as his friend used the anonymity of darkness to find the courage to eventually speak about his worries about Sam.  Inevitably, those were the nights that propelled the shift in their dynamic, with Castiel resurfacing from his meditative state to find Dean curled around him, unconsciously seeking the comfort of his presence in sleep.
Oddly enough, that amusing little gem of knowledge brightens Sam’s whole morning and he stands and stretches.  Suddenly, he feels freaking wonderful.
Cas turns Dean back over to look him in the face.  “Not in the manner of a compulsion, Dean, just….”  He trails off, searching for words, then regroups.  “You had spent so long under torment and your soul was so ravaged and warped by torture, that you were half-mad with grief and anger.  I imprinted your skin with my Grace so that you would feel its goodness, recognize me as an ally.  So you would know that I was there to bring you into the light.”
“Dean, you were completely unresponsive for nine minutes.  I believe my worry was justified.”
The next text has Dean laughing out loud again.
“Dean?”
Completely opposite of what Sam expects, Dean’s face crumples and he looks … scared.  Emotionally scared, not Run Like Hell scared.  He stares at the table and picks at his thumbnail.  Okay, not World Ending Catastrophe, so … oh God, what if something happened to Dean?  What if something happened to Cas?  Dean would never get over it.
This time, Cas doesn’t even have to flick his hands; an invisible pressure squeezes down on Dean’s wrists and he’s pinned there like a butterfly again.  The force of Cas’s Grace isn’t the only thing holding him to the wall, though, and Dean can’t help but notice the hot rising of Cas’s flesh beneath where his weight rests on the angel’s hips.
“What does it matter what you believe,” he snapped, more harshly than he meant to, “when you got your head so far up your own ass you don’t even see we’re already done for.  Angel knows it.  We are never going to make it with him next to us, glowing like a beacon.”
“I want you, Cas,” he groans in a harsh whisper.  “I didn’t know it at first, was too afraid to look at it, but … God, I want you so fucking much.”
"He was right about one thing, though: you didn't deserve what your father thrust on your shoulders. Any of it."
“Well,” he drawls, tapping his lips as if considering the question, “you’ve been looking at pretty much everybody in here, but no one person for more than a few seconds.  You’ve parked yourself towards the back where you won’t be noticed
“And when exactly has that line of reasoning ever fucking worked for any of us?  You say you did it for me, to protect me, but that’s bullshit, Cas.  Just like it was bullshit when Dad sold his soul for me, just like it was bullshit when I did it for Sammy.  Because if you had stopped to think for one second about how I would feel about it —” Dean growled through a break in his voice, “—you’d have known that I wouldn’t have wanted you to leave me.  We handle.  This shit.
The angel pulled himself to a sitting position, favoring Dean with a small smile as the hunter resituated his clothes.
The first one doesn’t do all that much for him.  I mean, yay for enthusiastic blow jobs and all, but only about 30 seconds worth of the clip rolls by before Dean clicks back to the main page, deciding that overly muscular, tatted-up guys are apparently not his ‘thing’.  Neither are beardy/hairy “bear”-type guys, it would seem, if his lack of reaction to the second video is anything to go by.  Unsurprising but hey, he might as well explore.  The next one sparks his interest for a little longer: the guy who seems to be in charge in this one has a slimmer build, lean but toned, and definitely an
Castiel gave an unsteady laugh.  “It means that we’ve been wasting time, Dean.”
His hands slide up Dean’s chest as he rights himself.  A tap of fingers and Dean’s ‘restraints’ release.  He can’t help but roll his shoulders against the uncomfortable twinge of soreness.  Cas’s slim digits wrap around each of Dean’s shoulders and as the fingers knead at the thick ropes of muscles, Dean feels the cold tingle that accompanies him healing Dean.
“Jesus, Cas.  I really need to teach you some tact with this shit.”
Strong fingers plucked across the metal strings, both quiet and loud in the abandoned parking lot as Dean began.  Cas’s gaze was laser-keen intent but friendly on his face as he glanced between the paper and his friend.  With a slight hiccup in his voice, he started to sing.
“Cas, I—” Dean started to say but trailed away to nothing.
When Cas eventually came down from the high of his climax, he realized that Dean still rocked up within him rhythmically, still hard and searching for his own climax.  Dean had let his eyes drop closed as he leaned his forehead against Cas’s chest, straining too hard to find a peak that danced out of his reach.
Sliding down to lay at the foot of the tree where he'd been praying, Dean removed his jacket and pulled it over himself like a blanket, a parody of sleep. After a few long moments of forcibly measured breaths, Dean continued whispering his vow to Castiel, hoping with every atom of his being that the angel could hear him.
It’s not as if Dean had ever exactly been aces at “talking it out”, anyway.  Sammy had always been the closest person in the world to Dean, the only person he’d ever really trusted with his feelings until Cas came along, and even Sam had to pry his emotions out of him with a crowbar.  In true Winchester fashion, the only way Dean really knew how to deal with his shit was to bury it in a fucking lockbox because the crap he dealt with on a daily basis would tear you apart top to bottom if you didn’t.  Purgatory was no different.
Rummaging through his bag, he eventually unearths a pair of jeans that aren’t his nicest but hang low on his hips and hug his ass like crazy, which can’t be bad if he’s trying to appeal to dudes, right?  They ride a little tight on his crotch – which is why he doesn’t wear them much anymore – but that’s probably not too bad either, considering Dean is a little more blessed in the package department than most and hey, if you got it, flaunt it.  He starts to pull out one of his nicer henleys and stops.  No, this is a club he’s going to, not a bar.  He digs around for a minute and pulls out a plain black t-shirt; okay, a bit boring, but Sam shrunk the hell out of it last time he did the wash (payback for some kind of prank Dean pulled) with the result that it’s clingy as fuck … but hugs every muscle, shows off the guns, and just hits the top of his jeans.  Ridiculous and impractical for hunting monsters, but hunting men?  Dean twists this way and that as he gazes in the mirror, watching the shirt move over his upper body, the way it pulls up and shows an inch-wide strip of his stomach (which is still flat, fuck you very much middle age) when he moves.  Perfect.  A minute or two spent on his hair and he thinks he’s actually good to go.  He leaves his jacket on the bed – not like he needs it in July in Atlanta anyway – jams his wallet in his jeans pocket, and palms his keys.  There’s a nervous flutter in his stomach which he resolutely ignores as he shuts the motel door and strides out to Baby.
in it than Dean feels shattered.  His heart squeezes, his eyes prickle (god damn it, he’s not crying during sex!  He’s not Sam!), and he feels like he can’t breathe for an entirely different reason than before.  One of Cas’s hands slides down Dean’s belly to cup his erection, stroke him back to fullness (he hadn’t even realized that he’d mostly gone soft with all the anxiety).  And okay, it’s starting to feel better, and the more Cas licks at his mouth and strokes at his cock the more the pain eases, but he can’t help but think
His words skittered to a halt when, contrary to every outcome he could have expected, Dean’s grip on his arm tautened, effectively trapping him against the other man’s body.	After a long moment of silence broken only by the hunter’s measured, deliberate breathing, Castiel ventured, “Dean?”
you to know that prayer isn’t only heard by the angel that you are speaking to.  The entire Host witnessed your ‘conversation’ with me last night!”
"Wow.  Sinner," Dean chides, but he smiles as he says it.  "Lost your cherry to your sister's boyfriend who was thirty?!  Jesus, Sam, I underestimated you."
“Aw, hell,” Sam curses and plunks down his mug.  “I owe Jody ten bucks.  Thanks a lot, Dean.”
Dean scrubs both hands over his face as Sam steps back a few paces.  He thumbs backwards towards the door.
.  You picture yourself undressing me, yet you imagine me to be the one aggressing upon you; you see yourself as the one penetrating me on the seat of your car, but you imagine me to be writhing in your lap, dragging you down on top of me, pulling you inside me.  You depict
“Sorry, Sammy.  Nightmare,” he babbles, pleased that he could come up with something other than “
It wasn’t anger, Dean knew, but sorrow and shame that caused his friend’s resolve to break, caused the angel to drop his gaze to the ground and mumble, “I was trying to protect you.”
He flicked open his eyelids to see the angel pulling back from him slightly; Dean was left feeling as if those morning sky eyes could dig down to his soul just by looking into his. And though the press of Cas's lips on his had only occupied the space of a second or two, he felt as if the angel had sucked away every drop of oxygen in his lungs.
“For your information, I was married for nearly seven months; I am adequately educated in that regard,” Castiel said with a haughty tip of his chin, missing Dean’s startled expression.   The angel’s face then flickered to something much more pensive.  “The assumption regarding our roles in the scenario seem reversed, however.   Given his sexual history in comparison to mine, Dean would be more likely to be the Pizza Man; I would be more plausible as the inexperienced babysitter.”
“No, no, you don’t have to.  Please, I’ll just—”
It seems a little … callous.
"Understand the reference," Dean finished for him. "Yeah, I know. Dude, someday when all this bullshit is over, I'm tying you down to a couch and forcing you to watch all my favorite movies and TV shows. Just so you'll understand what the hell I'm saying most of the time."
“When did you learn to play?” the angel persisted, striding close enough to watch as Dean’s hands anxiously but lovingly stroked the neck of the guitar.
Love to all of you.
“Huh?” Sam says, distracted.
A/N - Well, that's it, everybody.  But it isn't really, is it?  ^_^  Stay tune for the next part of the series.  I'm already working on it, so it should be on its way relatively quickly; hopefully, I'll have at least the first chapter out before Thanksgiving (end of November in the USA).  Thanks so much for all your time, your responses, your encouragement.  Seriously, it means the world to a writer to hear from people.  *MWUAH*
“I don’t care what you’re comfortable with,” Dean snarled to the vampire’s umpteenth only-slightly-veiled suggestion to leave Castiel behind.  “We agreed to—”
--- another stand-alone sequel: case fic heavily featuring Shooter Boy Sam and the scads of backstory I made up for him in my head. My sister, also my beta, Skeptikitten and I have been doing a lot of plotting and chatting, so hopefully both of these works will come hot on the heels of the end of You Can't Spell Subtext.
It’s not quite an
“I should just let you remain sticky,” he retorted with a scowl.
"I like that," he said. When Dean raised a single eyebrow, Castiel explained, "You and I. 'After the bullshit is over,' as you said."
A/N - all right, my babies, this is the last "proper" chapter, with the epilogue coming next.  I have to admit, the epilogue is the chapter that I had the most FUN writing, so I hope you like it.  But this one actually does a fair amount to set up the next series that will happen ... so again, subscribe subscribe subscribe.  Wink wink, nudge nudge.
“Hey you,” a twangy tenor voice says and Dean turns to see a slim slip of a kid who can’t be more than 20 or so giving him a sharp, predatory smile.  “I don’t see a drink in your hand and I bet you could use one.  Looking that good must be thirsty work.”
– that he hears the real Cas and that the angel is in much the same state as Dean.  The knowledge that somewhere out there in the world, the angel is watching a panoramic view of Dean fucking him senseless in the back of a car and the sight drives Cas out of his mind with lust.  Jut the idea of that unravels Dean completely.
“Should I?”
The ‘angel’ turns out to be a guy with a pair of pitch-black feathered wings tattooed across his back and down his arms, but the guy has a slim build and dark, tousled hair, and Jesus Christ on Toast, this is definitely a bad idea.  Dean doesn’t click away though, and he finds himself watching as the ‘angel’ sinks to his knees and frees his partner’s stupidly large cock from a battered pair of jeans.  Pink lips stretch across the faceless guy’s length and the sight transfixes Dean; he’s not even bothering to resist stroking his hand along the ridge his erection makes in his boxers.  By the time Twink Angel clambers onto his hands and knees and fixes the camera with a fierce gaze, Dean strokes his cock through the thin cotton with one hand while groping towards the drawer of his nightstand for lube with the other.  He bobbles the bottle when there is a sudden extreme close-up of Giant Cock’s fingers plunging into Twink Angel’s ass.  More than a little shocked, Dean winces in sympathy.
“Is that where I should start, Dean?  Remind you of who I am by pushing you to your knees and thrusting into your mouth, taking my pleasure between your lips?”
“Stop talking.  You do not need to fill the silence if you feel awkward about engaging in intimate sexual congress.”
Cas brings his thumb and forefinger together in mid-air in a weird pinching gesture and Dean’s wrists snap together.  A light flick of the angel’s hand and his wrists are pinned to the wall above his head; Dean barely even needs to tug on them a few times to know that Cas somehow angel-mojoed restraints, but he does it anyway on principle.  He’s a tad ashamed to admit that being stretched out and pinned to the wall while Cas goes back to playing Oral Oregon Trail on Dean’s chest makes him so hard he feels a bit light-headed again.  In an immediate departure from its previous thundering gallop, Dean’s heart seems to stutter to a stop when Cas drops to his knees.
Castiel's eyes smiled even if the rest of his face didn't follow suit, and Dean shifted in his seat, watching Cas's long fingers smooth across worn leather.
“A nightmare?” Cas said, starting towards him.  The angel stopped short when Dean thrust out a hand to his shoulder, keeping the other man at arm’s length.
Even though he knows it’s coming, Dean still sucks in a huge gulp of air when the flat of Cas’s tongue strokes up the bolt of his jaw.  He pants outright as Cas catches the edge of Dean’s earlobe with his tongue and he can’t control his breathing when Cas leaves a trail of open-mouthed sucking kisses across his jaw, down his throat, over the wing of his collar bone.
“Is that what you’re worried about?  I don’t really.”  When Castiel scoffed, Dean persisted, “I swear, I don’t.  Look, this is just as new to me as it is to you.  I just … thought of what feels good to me and figured I’d go from there.”
Castiel waved his hand across both his body and Dean’s, removing any traces of their activity, before resituating his clothing and rolling to his side to watch as Dean replaced his own.
Dean’s green-eyed gaze searched the angel’s face as breath seemed to return to Castiel in a rush.  His friend’s expression, naked with anxiousness and a twinge of fear, touched at something in the angel’s chest that ached and he found himself propelled so far forward that Castiel could practically feel the vibrations from the strings as the hum died away.
Castiel didn’t hug him back.  That fact stuck in his mind as he trekked behind Dean and the vampire, crashing through the crackling undergrowth heading away from the stream.  Dean had hugged him after jogging down to the bank of the water where Castiel had been rinsing the grime from his face.  The hunter looked happier than he had done in Castiel’s presence in so long, and his friend’s expression of complete elation at finding him had torn at his heart nearly as much as staying away had done.  Castiel had been so overwhelmed by an ebb of conflicting emotions that he hadn’t even thought to return the basic, simple gesture of Dean’s arms clasped around his back.  Stupidly, Castiel wished for the opportunity back, a chance to connect – even on the briefest level – to the being that meant more to him than anything had in millennia.  Perhaps ever.  His opportunity had come and gone and Castiel couldn’t help but long for it in the tense silence of their journey.
“Do you like it, feeling my ass pressed up against your cock?  Tell me,” Sam spits out in a harsher voice than Dean would have expected.
“Oh,” Sam says, parsing it a bit more.  “Sam is a girl.”
Dean looks up, startled, as if Sam had derailed him from a prepared speech.  “What?”
The angel narrows his eyes but nods.  “Better,” he confirms.  “Shall I reward you, then, for behaving?”
“Dean?”
Given that when Benny snorted in amusement as Dean passed and was rewarded with a grimace that could take down a water buffalo, the vampire did his best to suppress a smile before gesturing that the angel follow after Dean.  Whatever hornets’ nest he’d managed to unintentionally stir up between the two men just then, Benny was fairly certain it would have some damn amusing consequences before this whole episode played out.
"He was wrong, you know;
“Dean!” Castiel boomed, clasping a firm hand to his friend’s shoulder and grabbing his upper arm to stop the lethal swing of his blade.
“What was this song about, Dean?”
As Dean drove the knife up through the monster’s jaw, he felt like smiling for the first time since he’d landed here months ago.
Dean fights the blush that rises to his cheeks and fails miserably.
The hunter sighed heavily and swiped his non-weapon hand over his face.  “Not this again.  Guys, honestly—”
(See the end of the chapter for
, for fuck’s sake, and built your body back piece by piece?  How do you even
It wasn’t really a question.  The angel’s expression told Dean everything he needed to know.  But he said it anyway.
“Pleasure, Dean,” he says calmly.  “I came here for every single sinful pleasure your body can give.  Maybe I should just take it from you.  But where to start?”
“Where is the angel?” he asked calmly.
“Yeah, but I’m paid to be a tease,” Sam jokes.  “And I’d say that right now, you’re probably a big fan of my teasing.”
“Dean,” he ground out,
After a minute, Dean hoists up onto a stool and lets himself relax more than he had before.  He gives Sam a nod of thanks when he sets down a pint glass – “On me, sugar” and another wink – and rolls his shoulders to relieve some of the tension.  Maybe this won't be as hard as he thought.
fighting because, God damn it, I said cursed or not I want you on my fucking team.”
“You fought me, Dean.  You wanted to stay.”
Compelled. That was a good word for it. Dean couldn't seem
“So yeah,” Dean says after a long moment of quiet.  “That, uh … that was pretty spectacular.”
Dean whirled around to see Castiel behind him, glancing at the two other Deans, one practically snarling his insults as the other did his best to keep a calm façade in the face of having his worst insecurities laid out to him.
Dean” in that voice that sounds like ten miles of bad road, Dean’s climax seems to burst from nowhere and shatter him to pieces.  His hips stutter and every muscle in the lower half of his body clenches and unclenches in random patterns.  Dean slides down the tiled wall to fold himself into a heap, uncaring of the state of cleanliness of the tub for the moment, just letting his twitching muscles come to rest as the last of the hot water runs out.
“So yeah, maybe I’ve got a checkered past, but I don’t regret
So if you've read this before, you've probably noticed that it's been an insanely long time since I updated.  I won't go into the many, varied reasons and RL things that have kept me away - from this fic in specific but from writing fic in general - but I am back.  If you've read this before and have stuck with me, I can't thank you enough.
Sam paused for thought and Dean knew that he was just trying to find a way to be kind about what he was going to say.  “That’s … not possible.  You said it yourself: you made it out, he didn’t right?”
“Too bad, too,” Sam murmurs and rolls his hips again.  “If it weren’t the rules, trust me, you could grab me anywhere you want.”
hurt but not his body.
ass kicking for whatever the hell she did to you. I will use your angel blade to make that bitch's wings into a frickin' angel kabob, I guaran-damn-tee it."
The angel’s mind whirred as they moved through the desiccated forest.  The angel couldn’t bring himself to regret seeing Dean again – especially now that being in his presence meant a much more concrete way to protect him – but he also couldn’t help but berate himself endlessly that this was the very basis of why he’d chosen to run in the first place.  Dean was in danger every second that the seraph was at his side, and if anything happened to his charge now, with the man so close Castiel could reach out and touch his worn leather jacket, there would be no end to the penance he would need to inflict upon himself for eons to come.  Yet again, Castiel’s willpower crumbled to feebleness in the face of Dean Winchester’s determination.
Cas huffs but smiles as he settles back down onto Dean’s shoulder.  They’re both quiet for a long time and it feels … comfortable.
"She's a '67 Chevy Impala.  Fixed her up myself, several times."
He doesn’t want to be shy talking about this because Cas just had his tongue up Dean’s ass a bit ago, but he can’t seem to make himself say it. Cas and his lack of social graces to the rescue.
The third time it happens is completely, inescapably, smirk-inducingly planned and Dean can’t help but be
~~ ** Lady Tuesday ** ~~
Castiel’s eyes searched the other man’s face.  Dean watched the normally blank appearance pinch into the tiny minutia of his friend’s facial expressions that Dean had learned to interpret over the last four years: pain, sorrow, shame, guilt, misery.
Okay, so Dean could admit to himself that his relationship with Cas had never been exactly “normal”, whatever the hell that meant.  He didn’t have a
Sam blinks and smiles, but Dean just sips his beer and continues without waiting for a response.
The liberation left him with a fairly fucking huge problem, though.  Namely, it wasn’t just Dean’s heart that seemed to be warming to the idea of “something more” with Cas.  Every time they laid down to sleep now, Dean curled onto his side away from Cas because when the angel wordlessly pressed close against his back and laced a lean arm around Dean’s ribcage, he couldn’t lie to himself that he felt nothing.  No, his brain had started spinning out all the different ways that he could show Cas how to “go native”, and quite frankly, he’d never been so damn sexually frustrated in his life.  Poor Cas was only trying to give Dean whatever consolation he thought his friend needed, not put the moves on Dean, for fuck’s sake.  The whole thing had started out as a desperate plea for comfort from Cas after he’d nearly ganked a creature that had
.  It was more than just him being a dude, or an angel … maybe because he was both of those things, and Dean just didn’t know what the fuck to do with that.  He couldn’t name it, he couldn’t control it, he couldn’t even fucking hold on to whatever the hell he was feeling, and he felt like if he let go with both hands  then whatever the fuck it was would pull him under.
is the Top, isn’t he?”
A/N - So as you can see, I really adored my OMC, Sam.  He has a whole back story that formed itself in my head like a bolt of lightning and while it doesn't belong/fit in this story, I really hope I can find another usage for him in a future work, because I really came to adore this character (and as you'll see, I think Dean does too).
barrel at it and kick it in the ass. Or fuck it in the ass, which seems more and more likely to be the case here … aaaaaaand now he’s come back around to the burying his feelings part.
“Good morning, Dean,” he murmurs and adjusts his position, seemingly unconsciously, to be closer to where Dean stands at the fridge, even as he turns his back to pour himself a cup of coffee.
“First time in a place like this?”
.  So what angle does Dean want to work to appeal to another guy?
“Okay, I’ve got to admit, I’m going to go ahead and fully endorse your shameless cheating because this feels ….”
A long beat of silence passed before Castiel noticed the corners of Dean’s mouth twitch up just the tiniest bit.
“No!” he says a little too hastily.  “No, Sammy, I’m fine, thanks.  I … uh … I think I’m going to get some air.  Sit outside on the hood.”
Instead, Castiel found himself to be glutting on everything that Dean subconsciously offered up when his active mind gave way to rest.  Perhaps he was able to seem disaffected and constant during daylight hours when Dean’s outward behavior remained as it always had been, but in the darkness when the hunter sought out Castiel’s comfort, Castiel’s body, the seraph found his resolve crumbling away under an avalanche of longing and gluttony.  Every touch that Dean unknowingly offered with his body when his mind was tucked away, Castiel devoured readily.  His mind and conscience battled with his judgment, insisting that what he accepted and fed on from Dean were merely unconscious expressions of insecurity from a man terrified of being abandoned.  Shame picked at him during the day every time he looked upon Dean’s face, smeared with dirt and blood and bisected by the lines of anxiety and the stress of the journey across this barren place, but he couldn’t seem to stop himself from gorging on the hunter’s touches at night, regardless of his stinging guilt.
Benny doesn’t pause for a response as they continue on towards where the angel headed, but he does note that Dean has gone suspiciously quiet.
“Don’t be such a prude, Sammy,” Dean grins and claps him on the shoulder, heading towards the fridge.  “Even butt sex is a beautiful thing.  Trust me on that one.”
“I had thought that my love for you was obvious enough not to require declaration.”
Being unable to restrain a snort of laughter is clearly the wrong move for Dean to make at this juncture.  In an instant, Cas’s hand grips Dean’s chin so hard it’s going to leave marks and his face is so close to Dean’s that the hunter can feel the angel’s breath ghosting along his cheekbones.
“You’re still an angel, Cas.  You shouldn’t be taken by a man with blood on his hands.”
Without stopping or even slowing his thrusts, Cas reaches underneath Dean and pushes two fingers back against his body, but this time it’s just beneath his testicles, and Dean lets out a burst of noise as he gets a sudden shock of pleasure.  Cas is nowhere near his prostate, so how—?
“That’s the idea.”
It was barely perceptible at first, a quiet slide into a more intimate way of relating to Castiel.  A touch on the bicep to get his attention became warm fingers around his wrist.  An elbow nudge to the side – coupled with Dean’s trademark quirk of lips – to reveal a touch of humor became the back of his hand against Castiel’s stomach.  An open palm between his shoulder blades to check his health after a fight became both hands wrapped around his upper arms – just where Dean bore the print of his own hand – coupled with a searching gaze.  Which eventually became one hand at his shoulder and the other wrapped around the back of his neck.  The gradual shift to a greater familiarity over the course of several weeks might have been undetectable to most people, but not to Castiel.  Every touch seemed a beacon to him, a sign of some fundamental change in the alchemy of his friend.  Something that might indicate that he was not mistaken, that there was something there that was so very much more than friendship.
