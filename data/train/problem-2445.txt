Sometimes, the sweetest thing is also the simplest.
"John. Exactly how many pain pills have you ingested in the last 12 hours?"
Swooping in, John latched his lips to the side of Sherlock's neck like a leech. "Fuck, you beautiful man, you ridiculously gorgeous creature." Sherlock squirmed, overwhelmed by it all.
you, love. Let's focus on you."
"If you expect me to reply in French, you're going to be disappointed. It's plain Jane English for me, mate." John grinned, warily maneuvering into the room. He gave Sherlock a wide berth with the crutches.
"Yes," Sherlock agreed, "It most definitely was that, and then some. How are you, John? Did our rather -

the detective mused with chagrin. The only refuge from the excruciating agony came through submergence in his own mind. Sherlock's mind palace served more than one purpose.
Greg struggled to downplay the injury, nervous of triggering a third...episode, but this was Sherlock observing him. Fat chance of that happening, yeah?
John flinched, caught in the memory of a uni physics elective...v=d/t. This was not going to end well. Sherlock was going to crash on his arse.
Sherlock cleared his throat and jerked his head in John's direction, his gaze remaining on the DI. "Do it, Lestrade," he growled. "Otherwise, the good doctor here will never let it go. Trust me, I've learned from painful and protracted experience. You're a relentlessly nosy little bastard, John," Sherlock spat out sourly. "Quite an excellent trait for solving crime, yet here I find it tedious in the extreme."
Whew, now I am pooped (worn out).
Jesus, no," John pleaded. "Christ, Sherlock. The time we've spent together has been the happiest of my life.
"Fucking shite!" the former soldier howled, resting on all fours in a oil-slicked puddle. He smacked at the sludge with annoyance. Sherlock was going to have a field day with this.

"Ngh?" John mumbled, only marginally awake. He didn't move.
"I see." The doctor halted three feet from the bed. His eyes darted to the bed, then at Sherlock, and finally down at his crutches. He was a man who looked ready to bolt. "So...now what."

"Shut up and make me come," John piped in rebuttal, and bent down to suck on his cock. It was marvelous, this - to love and be loved, especially by the love of your life.
"Whilst I agree that it is an appropriate measure from a medical standpoint," he sniffed, "there was absolutely no need for those old prunrs to act so appallingly rude." Scooting a chair up to the bed, Sherlock dug into the cup using his fingers. He frowned. The ice too, was giving him trouble.
Boiling-hot rage welled up like mercury in an old glass thermometer. His hands clenched back into fists, steadfast and restless to strike. Dr. John Watson generally labored to save lives; after all, he'd taken an oath. Dr. John Watson was also a soldier, and he was having a very bad day.
"Sherlock..." the doctor groaned. "And now I've fucked it all up because of
you thought of my silly infatuation. I certainly wasn't going to bring it up if you weren't. I was afraid it would destroy our friendship."
The detective waited with out-of-character humility for an answer whilst watching John's pointless attempt to get comfortable. The doctor beat the tired cushions with ruthless abandon, irritated now beyond reason. With his harsh thrashings, the split in John's jeans yawned wide open. A triangle of golden brown thigh peeked through. This patent exposing of thigh recalled the taunting of (gay) male strippers. Sherlock shook his head in self-disgust, appalled at associating those images with John. He had some serious deleting to do.
John's hands were the hands of a healer. The barbed wire savagely squeezing around his heart snapped, one razor-sharp barb at a time.
John found this sexy as all hell. He snuffled, scenting Sherlock's armpits; reeling over the heady masculine musk, that earthy Sherlockian bouquet. John, feeling wanton, yearned for more. He drew his wickedly talented tongue up the column of Sherlock's neck, savouring the essence of Eau de Genius. Not halfway to satiated, John formed a seal with his mouth, laving and sucking until he licked over the edge of his lover's ear.

Sherlock blanched, horrified. John was suffering - again - because of his own thoughtless actions. Not just the war, then, but he himself. How often did

"Murray! Dempsey! It's Watson. I'm here, I'm okay!" John's voice cracked on the name of MacAvey. That little shit...that fucking smart wanker. Mac was still shaving peach fuzz - but a hell of a field paramedic. "State your name and where you think you location is compared to mine!"

"I came to see about John. How is he doing since his surgery?" In desperation, Lestrade thrust both hands in his trouser pockets, fumbling in hopes for a nicotine patch. Nothing doing. "And when is he being released?"
, bawling like a nancy boy done wrong." Unthinkingly, he drew the back of his hand under his nose, and then grimaced as he caught sight of the thick nasal discharge left behind in a smear.
John attends to Lestrade, sort of, and a new line of communication ensues.
"Giddy up, John, giddy up!"
The doctor resorted to his oft-used personal reset button by reflexively shaking out his hands. John then extended his fingers, whereby they wavered like world-weary starfish. "Ohhh, God. I do feel like I'm under the weather, Sherlock. I'm bloody all turned around. I can't think straight."
It was half four in the afternoon by the time they reached Baker St. Sherlock felt empty, but Lestrade's heart was full up.
"He seems simple enough on the surface, yeah, but - "
The genius licked his lips, caught between ecstasy and nervousness. "I want...I want..."
"John, you look terrible! Sit down!" The tall man bawled, bags dropped hastily to the lino. He was right. John's eyes, normally a formidable and piercing dark navy blue, now floated wanly in a sea of red ink. His sclera were bloodshot, pupils overly large. John looked like a man on his way to the mortuary. Sherlock cursed himself for being such a nitwit. He should have never left John in this state.

friend. He'd never do anything to purposefully hurt you, or put you in any awkward position with the press. You do get that, right?"
"I'll hurry," Sherlock promised.
"Oh, fuck, Sherlock. Yeah, keep doing that, just like that," John begged. "But, if you think that I can't multi-task under pressure, then you're sorely mistaken." He squirmed against Sherlock's strong hand. "Don't forget. I was a doctor
Unfortunately, Sherlock's body - to be precise, the parts that weren't reveling in bliss, put out an urgent appeal for attention. The strain of bridging John's length burned, blood caustic from building lactic acid. The genius took one-one thousandth of a second to tell his bellyaching limbs to piss off. Protecting John's ankle was tantamount, superseding his personal discomfort. Sherlock shifted, hoping to ease his aching muscles. Mind over matter, and such. Or, so they say.

The doctor flicked his wet tongue, promptly jamming it in Sherlock's flushed ear. Sherlock gasped in shock. "Would you like me to touch you down here," John ruthlessly palmed Sherlock's cock, "and bring you to kicking and screaming to orgasm?" Sherlock squeaked high in his throat. "Baby, do you want me to rub your cock," the doctor jiggled his hand meaningfully, "or put your sensitive prick in my mouth?" The detective appeared to be choking. "Tell, me, love. Would you like me to suck you off, flick the head with my tongue,
At only one other time in his life had John suffered such a sense of impotence; the day that he'd watched his best friend die.
John's hands slipped down his lover's chest, tracing raised remnants of contrition. "Juh...John," Sherlock stuttered, pulling aft. "I don't - I though we were done with that business."

He'd hurt Greg. He'd hurt Greg.
One thing I can tell you is you got to be free.
Let me do this. I've been wracking my brain for the words. I never thought they'd come, but they did. I don't know how, honestly. I think - I understand now, that some ideas and feelings are so big that words can only hint at their essence." Sherlock's eyes welled with tears. His amazing, wonderful John.
Beforehand, the lovers had sworn not to touch on the subject of pillows, or lack thereof. For that matter, they'd agreed to avoid conversation at all. This was a time for fucking, not in depth scientific observation.
Lestrade had been correct about one thing, at least. Children's parks made an excellent venue for stealthy abduction. His companion was nowhere to be seen.
Sometimes something bad needs to happen for good things to follow.
"I still have my phone. I'm assuming that you still have yours?"
British term for spatula (which makes so much more sense). ;p
No! Sherlock gave himself a stern mental smack on the head. He needed to set the record straight about the scars. They were horrific, and there'd been too many lies as it was.
"Deduce for yourself, Scotland Yard," Sherlock groaned. "It's been difficult for John. Being injured, that is. You know what they say about doctors."
Honestly, will these two men shut up and bonk already?
John's eyebrows peaked higher than the Alps.
"I'm suggesting that you get your guilty arse out of the flat. You didn't cause this," John gestured to his leg, "and you know it. It was
The genius ignored him, mumbling in an unending, unintelligible loop. Greg dithered, fearful about triggering another...episode? Nevertheless, he chanced it and invaded Sherlock's personal space.

"Jooohhhn..." Sherlock moaned. "Are you ready?"
But, bloody hell, where to begin?
with this whingeing. So much crying - too much crying. He was a soldier, by God, and a Brit of the male persuasion. He'd not wept this much as a tot still in nappies, sucking on a dummy whilst kipping in his cot.
A miasma of mental meanderings mucking up Sherlock's mission. What. I like alliteration, okay?
"Oi!" John shouted. "Put me down!
Come on, you great tit! Tell me where you are. I'll come to you."
John manoeuvred his way over to his chair. "Mmm, don't really know, but ta for making me sound like a lush." He plopped down hard on his arse. "How's your own pain situation, by the way?" John parried. "One through ten, and please be honest. My scripts haven't done much for me personally, but our cre....cshre...chemistry is different. Strange word, that... 'chemistry'. Keeeeeh...miss tree. Keh-MYStery. Ha. My point is, I could len' you a tablet or two, if you want to give it a go. Also, they appear to be much more effective when combined with scotch."
John groaned loudly, "Fuck, Sherlock, you are amazing. And yet, I do understand your nervousness. I've been there myself."
"You...love me. I'm sorry for being obtuse, Sherlock, but I was once informed in
"Please, forgive me if I am making a colossal fool of myself right now." Sherlock lowered John's hand, but did not release it from the warmth of his own. "I love you as in...as in I
"I wasn't having you on when I asked you to show me your scars," John said, angling his chin down and to the side. Peering up thoughtfully from the corner of his eye, the little man raised his eyebrows whilst pursing his lips. Dr. John Watson, determination personified. The doctor nodded one, then lifted his head up for an audible sniff. "Also, I'm going to need you to help me. I wasn't joking about my feet."
"Neurocysticercosis. Right, brilliant, little squigglies ingesting the meat of our brains," John exhaled. "Lovely image, Sherlock. Explains the nausea and disordered thoughts, yeah?"
Business attended to, John sat back down on the lid with one less issue to deal with. Unfortunately, his left ankle throbbed in tandem with his heart; intolerable torment and no deliverence for the foreseeable future.
A pretty, pink flush now stained the whole of his cheek. John waited, afraid to say anything that might hinder Sherlock's recovery. The little man sat, and waited, and watched. Sherlock lifted his head. He proceeded to uncurl his arms, straighten his spine, and stick out his chin like a soldier.
"Human beings are funny. They long to be with the person they love but refuse to admit openly. Some are afraid to show even the slightest sign of affection because of fear. Fear that their feelings may not be recognized, or even worse, returned." - Sigmund Freud

Dreading the inevitable, Sherlock crossed the bed on his knees. His shirt swung to his sides as he shuffled, an intimation of what was to come. He couched forward and down, sinking into John's sheltering arms.
The rich olive brown skin of Greg's arms exploded in an epidemic of goose flesh. The silvered hair on his nape stood on end. Sherlock, by nature and practice, was a remarkably articulate man. His mouth also sped though a million words per minute - on a bad day.
"Yeah, I get it," the DI nodded, chastened. "It's been a difficult few days for you both. I wouldn't bother you, except - this involves several kidnapped children. Three, in fact, all from different families but with the same M.O. It's a dead ringer, no pun intended, for a series of kidnappings in Manchester six months ago, obviously unsolved. The investigation just never got going."
It appeared that cuddle time was over, not that it ever really began. It was sexy time now, and sex with Sherlock was very, very good.
The duo trudged along the winding chalk path to the playground, two men on their way to a funeral. Consummate professional that he was, Lestrade pushed past his trepidation and continued to parse out the most reasonable abduction scenarios. He should have saved his breath. After several minutes of one-sided conversation, Sherlock chewing on one thumb, Greg paused to spare a long look at his friend.

Eventually, the frescos got damaged. Time, and the climate, even other idiot painters who wanted to touch it up. A couple of years ago people restored it. Some moron had decided to cover it with glue...presumably to prevent it from cracking." Fingers followed the curve of taut shoulders, bridging the trapezius muscles to fall into the wells of his clavicles. "Multiple puncture wounds, also compromised by infection. Extensive keloidal nodules across the joints, significant likelihood of adhesions... puncture wounds, is my guess. More knife-work?"
Granted, as an army doctor, John had been witness to the detestable depths to which men sunk. Nevertheless, what those -
The doctor snorted, amused at the thought. Sherlock's coat as his cape. A vivid image of the detective, ripping open his purple-shirt-of-sex, flying off to fight crime in his Superlock suit....why not? He giggled merrily, tilting his head back to gaze at the sky. The doctor gave a full body shiver as a gust of cold air whipped through the alley. His teeth began to emphatically chatter.
"Uhhh...but of course. Whatever you think that will help," Sherlock fumbled, checking his pocket for his phone. "I'll just pop down to Bart's and see what Molly has cooking. Uhm...figuratively speaking, of course." He checked his watch. "I should be back in two hours, at the latest, I swear."
...do that again...wickedly talented. When you - Shit, John, stop dawdling about and get in me!" Sherlock panted. "You bloody tease, making me beg like some sub-intelligent, sex-crazed tart."
"You are, John, trust me... God knows I trust you. Even if - hell, John. My brain is mired down with all these
As John surreptitiously scrutinized Lestrade, Sherlock blatantly scrutinized John. The genius glowered, resenting John's countenance. Earlier that day, his feelings had been grievously hurt. He'd been shocked by his blogger's hostility. Upon reflection though, during the ride to the crime scene, Sherlock analyzed and then promptly dismissed it. John's attitude was simply a prototypical manifestation of his constipated ability to express sentiment.
John liked sex. Sweetly satisfying, was sex, and simple as - yeah, that's utter tosh. Nothing's so simple when it comes to humanity's inexplicable quirks. A strange enigma is man.
Even infrequent opportunities grew difficult the further he delved into Moriarty's web.
"Really, John?" Sherlock snorted. "How trite." His mouth pinched and pressed to one side. "John, I honestly want to do this, to have penetrative sex. No, wait. That's not correct. I mean that I want us to make love. I've been wanting this for ages." He closed his eyes, scrubbing at the lids. "But how do I handle all these sensations when I'm so bloody - me?"
crutch
your exceptionally talented cock. And my fingers," he waved, making a moue, "aren't half as bloody long or talented." John swallowed, feeling suddenly lonely and bereft. He tried to rally. "Yeah, of course the scenario really got me going, especially - bloody Christ, your voice, and that wicked, wicked mouth. I thought I'd come before I started buggering myself."

Sherlock stood coiled tight as a spring, shirt back on but unbuttoned. A stripe of chalky-white skin bisected his shirt like a tie. "Stop it, John!" Sherlock snapped, affronted. "If I'm not mistaken, I've just provided you with an appropriately gruesome example of the aftermath of self injury - or am I so sorely mistaken?" John's ash-blonde hair tumbled as he nodded, and then rolled his head side-to-side. For good measure, the little man finished up with a shrug.
Pigeons in the square, and the markets, and the ad nauseum tapestry displays. And
Sherlock and John efficiently resolved the issues involved in supporting an ankle; John privately channelled MacGyver.* And oh...John deemed his earlier failures a blessing. Sherlock's refractory period matched that of a fourteen-year-old at a wet t-shirt contest.

"That you're injured and hurting."
"But of course. Apologies," more gratuitous throat clearing, and a sniff for good measure. "When a virus transitions to the lysogenic cycle after being triggered by environmental stressors, it multiplies, literally exploding out of a cell. Obliterates a host's cells, John. Rips them into bits, John. An eruption of death, if you will."
Sherlock stiffened, nodding forlornly. "Yes, John, but of course. Not a problem."
Lestrade's question was apropos of nothing. Obviously, the answer was
"warmed up."

"Sherlock, is this an attempt at a metaphor? Because otherwise, you have lost me," John groaned. He checked his watch for the time. One more hour until narcotics were medically prudent. He shoved the Union Jack under his left buttock.
John slipped his other hand under his vest to pinch at ice-tipped nipples. The little nubs were already hard due thanks to the sub-arctic chill, slightly numb.

Sherlock dropped his head, silently contemplating his options. This was a terrible time to leave John, the morning's conversation interrupted as it was. Nevertheless, John would have shoved him out the door if he'd been present during Greg's pitch for aid. Childen came first for them both, kidnappings the worst of the lot of The Work. The race against time upped the ante for everyone, family and detectives alike.
Sherlock's teacup grew heavy in his hands. It tipped sideways, and he bent to set it down before tea spilled. Unconsciously, solicitously, Sherlock calculated a number of horrid possibilities. He bent farther, nudging carefully until the cup rested under the bed. There was absolutely no need here to tempt fate. Only one injury allowed at 221B at a time, thank you very much.
John attempts to tap his past heterosexual history for purposes of "physical therapy", yet finds himself less than inspired. Bachelor John Watson, a man who is unequivocally "not gay" finds he suddenly needs something more.
Masturbation, as a rule, did not have a functional role in Sherlock's life. Yes, the sensations of his hand roughly manipulating his penis felt strikingly pleasant. The experience of orgasmic contractions sent his eyes rolling, mouth gaping, and pelvic girdle bucking uncontrollably. Despite the detective's best efforts, high-pitched whimpers escaped from his lips.
"John," the tall man whispered, "I am ready."
Desperate for pain relief, John tries to give wanking another go. Much to the author's surprise, however, instead of dreaming up a deliciously detailed sexual fantasy and tossing one off, John end up crying on the floor.
Within the span of three minutes, however, he accepted that it just wasn't happening. He'd have to move in another direction. No orgasm, no endorphins.
John rubbed his eyes using the meat of his palms. Grimacing, he yanked his hands back and scowled at their faint, salty sheen. "Fucking hell, I was crying?" Appalled, John scrubbed the sheets until his hands feel clean. He might as well have been scraping off dog shit.
Nevertheless. John had withheld painful truths, and what's worse, he'd withheld them from
The detective cringed as the doctor turned his head and shot him the fish eye. "John? What is it? Do you need something?" Sherlock half-pushed off the arms of his chair, ready to spring into action.
The doctor rubbed along Sherlock's thighs whilst remaining quiet. "Open your eyes, love. Look at me. I've got you. I've got you, I swear." The men locked eyes, sinking into the sensation of John's hypnotic stroking. Eventually, John ceased to rest his hands on Sherlock's hips. "Come down here, you lanky git," he smiled encouragingly, "and snog me senseless. There's no rush You've always been
I'll make him feel guilty for leaving me behind."
John knew that anal sphincters were composed of strong skeletal muscle, the primary purpose of such lay in keeping the anal canal closed. Sphincter muscles were permanently contracted (offering a secondary meaning for the term "tight-arse"). Even so, Sherlock's bum hole seemed downright
Eyeing John cautiously, Sherlock stepped closer. He carefully crouched down in the tiny square foot of space between his lover and the sink, precariously balanced on the balls of his feet. John held out his hand in repentance, palm upwards and trembling fiercely. Sherlock placed his own gargantuan palm on top and proceeded to thread their fingers snugly together to form a single unit. The detective brushed his lips over John's knuckles, anointing each joint with a soap-bubble soft kiss. "John," Sherlock breathed in despair, "This sounds ridiculous, coming from me, that is, but you have to stop being so impulsive. You're going to end up breaking your neck at the rate you're going."
"I'm sorry, John. I am...different, now. I'm not strong."

Feigning annoyance, Sherlock sniffed and straightened, feigning an air of disdain. Those...the

That's," he pointed sagely at his mate, "...tsss when I lost my bearing and fell. So you...see..." John continued, sticking his floundering finger in Sherlock's face, "why tsszz not yer fault. I got scared by a... fucking
"Well, yes!" Greg burst out. "Christ Almighty, but that's a load off my shoulders." He swiveled to look at Sherlock. "The boys are safe! They just went to hospital for a look-see. And Goddamned Dimmock was the...well, of course. You'd probably figured all this out during my phone call. I know how you hate it when people repeat."
Carefully, cautiously, Sherlock pushed out of his chair and walked the three short steps over to John. The fire had ebbed somewhat, bathing him in a bluish-blue glow. He could have been a ghost; hollowed out cheekbones and lengthy, slim limbs. In one hesitant move, the detective sank to his knees before John, carefully avoiding John's feet.
"One might compare the relation of the ego to the id with that between a rider and his horse. The horse provides the locomotor energy, and the rider has the prerogative of determining the goal and of guiding the movements of his powerful mount towards it. But all too often in the relations between the ego and the id we find a picture of the less ideal situation in which the rider is obliged to guide his horse in the direction in which it itself wants to go."
" He fought to maintain his composure, but to what ends? Mrs. Hudson had gone to the countryside. Sherlock was bothering Molly at Bart's.
"Another jaffa cake, John?" Sherlock said, lips pressed to his glass.
"Shut up, John, and get back to work! How was I to know that the theatre director used to make furniture! It makes no sense, logically speaking; in fact completely contradictory, considering his skill set." The detective risked a surreptitious peek from over his shoulder. John looked angry...no, John was furious.

To get back homeward
to place a barrier between his fingers and John's mouth. Any more finger sucking, and the results would be disastrous for his composure. He wiped off John's saliva on his pants, silently begging his penis to cool it and act like a dignified gentleman.
Between sweet gropings, and kisses, and the eventual frantic groping of cocks, John considered the feasibility of Sherlock actually teaching him to speak French. Or German, perhaps? The doctor was fairly confident about the word "Ich", German wasn't so "swishy"...like French. It didn't matter if John had the brains or not, at least, not at this moment. Sherlock was bare-arsed and giggling, free with his body, and he'd communicated his feelings to John.
"May I help you with the door, John?" Anthea inquired, sauntering up to his backside. Swooping down to pluck the flat keys from between John's legs (a move that in other circumstances that might have triggered a willful erection), Anthea smiled enigmatically.

Author screams and pulls out hair. Also, I've never written anything faster in my life, so there might be some inconsistencies. I'm just really irritated that I posted prematurely, AGAIN!
"Tut tut, John," he huffed. "No sense in throwing a wobbly." John might be shorter but they weighed roughly the same stone. This endeavor was increasingly perilous. Sherlock conveyed the struggling doctor up and over the coffee table whilst his lean arms trembled with effort. "John, please, just a moment," he wheezed. John commenced to flop like a fish out of water in his eagerness to escape Sherlock's grasp.
Sherlock," he paused, at pains to regain control, "I'm so sorry. I feel like my brains are melting. I don't know what I am doing anymore."
do you hear me? Split me in two, John! Drown my arse with your seed, fill me up until my arse is painted liquid white." The detective grinned, supremely satisfied, marking John's increasingly desperate groans. Sherlock beamed, practically splitting his face in two. He owned two sets of cheeks, after all.
Now, help me up. I need to clean my teeth. My tongue feels furry, like a rat crawled onto it and died - and after which it voided its bowels."
Abruptly, feeling much abused, the doctor thwacked his hands on the mattress. His thin bottom lip thrust outward, a forty-something toddler in full strop. Sherlock found to his chagrin, that John looked completely adorable. "I am thirsty," he said, pouting, "and re-ehhm...quahhh...wan' more of those cold drippy thingies. It is duty, yeah? Your duty, deary. Give me more!"
After a bit of rough rasping and gasping for air, the stripes settled down and the lighting resumed. Acceptable blood/oxygen levels restored, John took the time to sequester his manly bits.
The doctor's shoulders hitched up to his ears upon detecting the snick of an opening car door.
Something, some
Sherlock preened. "That would have been something to see."

a detective, broadly speaking. I can help wrap this one of my own."
"Sherlock. Wha... happe...?" he croaked. Hand shaking from the pain meds, he touched his fingers to his mouth. "Some...uhm...to..." he wiggled his fingers, "for...water?"
The crackling of the glaze added depth to the beauty." John squeezed Sherlock's biceps before flattening his hands over his chest. "Because, see, no matter how much we try, everything in life sustains a bit of damage. It's unavoidable. The very act of living is dangerous. You're a scientist, you know that," a sharp hitching breath cut short his thoughts. John's hands had reached the injuries sustained by Sherlock's own, guilt-ridden hand. Short fingers brushed from one razor slash to the next.
John thought.
in the hallway out of John's line of sight. Out of sight, out of mind, and good riddance. Sherlock sat down besides John.
"Sherlock," John murmured anxiously, "come over here. Come sit with me. I'm sorry I've acted the prat, please. Come here, love." He patted his thighs in invitation.
Disbelief flashed over John's rounded face. He twisted his mouth bitterly, slightly hurt. Did Sherlock consider him to be so naive that's he'd blindly accept this untruth? Seriously?! On a scale of 1-100, 100 being the most insensitive response possible, his reaction scored over 1,000. Say what you what about Mycroft, the man

things like this in the Commonwealth.
"John! You genius! Your cock is a miracle of nature!" He tossed away his wild curls, inexplicably tangled up with his eyelashes. "I can't help it," he whimpered, brutally pounding John's pelvis with his bum. Despite his plush posterior, Sherlock knew that he would find himself bruised, come morning.
Later on, Sherlock quietly conceded that perhaps, another tactic might have been preferable. He'd paraded into the flat without even knocking, followed by a flamboyant swirl of that damn bloody coat. It had taken weeks for Sherlock to receive anything resembling absolution from his flatmate. Sherlock meekly succumbed, submitting to several weeks of John's hysterical diatribes and a month-long banishment from their flat. When John had finally relented and given the detective consent to return, Sherlock still been subjected to agonized looks and long, stiff awkward silences.
Unfortunately, the detective's amended position also concealed his expression, eclipsed as he was by the light. John understand that Sherlock had changed positions on purpose.
Precisely 11 minutes and 22 seconds - give or take .03 of a millisecond later - Sherlock was reduced to a writhing, distracted mess, because John was waxing poetic. "How do I love thee, Sherlock? Let me count the ways. I love thee to the depth and breadth and height my prick can reach. When feeling..."
John's smile morphed from sweet to indulgent, and finally ruthless. He was going to take this ethereal seraph apart.
Sherlock parted his lips to reply. John cut him off before he could say something stupid, adamantly shaking his head. "No, stop thinking, and
"William Sherlock Scott Holmes, for a genius you're being exceptionally thick!" The little man bawled, frightening them both. "Love doesn't stop at the skin!" John's voice slid up the scale from tenor to squeaky contralto. "You are gorgeous, you're beautiful! Being tortured by gangsters - who I'd send straight to hell if I had them..." he growled, "doesn't change the love that I feel!" The doctor's voice cracked, sallying forth straight past mezzo-soprano to hit 8va high C. "And frankly, Sherlock, I'm a little insulted! Do you honestly believe I'm that shallow?" He threw his head down on the pillow. John pushed back against the softness as if trying to drill a hole through the mattress.
John blew out a long breath for clarity, which didn't work. "Sherlock!" he snapped, curbing the urge to raise his voice. "Kindly get your round, rosy arse out of your bloody thick skull, and give me a cuddle this instant." No additional response was forthcoming. John felt like stamping his foot. "

"If you're expecting me to come in and give a statement, you are sorely mistaken, Graham. I am needed here." Sherlock sniped. He flipped up his collar and attempted to fluff up his bedraggled hair. Nothing doing.

At precisely half two in the morning, John was wheeled into the surgery's recovery room. Two metal pins and three bone fragments shy of a complete tibia later, well... perhaps Sherlock should find John's old cane. At least John could rest assured that his new limp wasn't psychosomatic.

"Damn it! Sherlock, forget that. Shit, I'm sorry, I'm so sorry," John whined. He surged closer, ignoring the jolt of pain shooting up his left calf. The doctor pushed his compact frame up against Sherlock's as much as he could,
" Sherlock said, clearing his throat, "you are not...at...fault. It's just one of those things."
Greg pretended that his bollocks hadn't just shrivelled up like raisins, and just
Immediately, Sherlock complied. His mind had been so wrapped up in the pleasure of his prostate, he'd completely forgotten about his cock. Sherlock pumped his member up into his hand and then pushed down to engulf that of John's. Up, down. Up, down. Each grind of his hips was a collision, smashing into John's increasingly arrhythmic thrusts. Sherlock felt his heart seize as John arched up, wailing like a banshee. "I - fuck! Sherlock! Here it comes -
," he cried, "My love, please believe me when I say that the sight of your scars isn't that which made me vomit. Something - shit. I became ill in the knowledge that I wasn't there to protect you. God, you were there all alone."
"Ah. Of course," John nodded, lips pursed. "Ah...
...hello, Sherlock, and a very pleasant morning to you, too. It's a bit early, don't you think, to say things that might give me a heart attack?"  John scrubbed a hand over his face.
Bring whatever you must back here. If you must. But please...just let me sleep."
The DI's face crinkled up in concern as Sherlock's hands began to shake. "Jesus, Sherlock. I'm sorry. We're all sorry. This was a big bloody mess, and there was nothing for it! You had to go play dead, and John had to stay ignorant, and Mycroft had to manage everything, and I had to keep my head together, and Molly had to hold her tongue, and all because of James Fucking H Moriarty!"
I know that the rhyme used for the this and the last chapter are in reverse order, but I had this vision of Sherlock (said weasel/otter-thingie) popping up off of John's lap. So, there.

The doctor batted at the roll of loo paper, and rubbed the entire roll across his face. Saline and snot simply smeared. John gave it up as a loss, and threw the paper as hard as he could toward the closed bathroom door.
Nodding, Sherlock remained behind. His muscles tensed as John angled past his line of vision. A horrible crash sounded, jolting the detective to his feet. The commotion was immediately followed by an agonized cry. Sherlock took two enormous steps down the hallway before freezing mid-stride. He'd spied John, not writhing on the floor as expected, but on his feet and clutching the frame of the door for balance. He was sporting a radiant, shit-eating grin. The doctor's left-hand crutch lay abandoned, the obvious implement for proper sound effects.
forced me to do anything, ever?" Sherlock spoke tetchily. He sunk down to sit on his bottom. The detective's words would have been more formidable if he wasn't hunching over like an injured gosling.
Deciding to ignore the arctic chill, (no sense in wasting precious energy on things he couldn't control...ergo, wanker flatmates) John grunted as he eyeballed his set-up.
"Da," Sherlock smirked. "It means 'No problem'."
"Barking mad for your body. Around the twist for your touch." The smaller man's normally light voice had gone deep. "And, Sherlock," he hesitated for a second, "Thank you for telling me the truth."
Gently, Greg took possession of the bottle and walked it back in to the kitchen. He didn't bother with trying to locate the cap. The DI returned, bearing a large glass of water and two chalky round tablets of paracetamol. He'd swallowed three of his own in the kitchen whilst sucking water straight from the spigot. "John," Lestrade said loudly, "it's time to wake up. Sherlock and I are back from the case." The doctor's nose twitched, answering Greg with an ear-splitting snore. "John. Mate. I need a bit of doctoring here." Nothing doing. John was
Sherlock reached down with his lanky arms, but then pulled back, floundering with indecision. "Uhm, should I help you now or leave you alone?"
"Indeed," he agreed. "Come on. My arse is freezing. And what in God's name, excuse me,
Did that show really still get airtime? Unbelievable. What was more strange was that John had not switched the station in disgust. Sherlock peered in, squinting through the dark of the flat; the telly being the single light source in the room. "John?" he called, voice barely audible above the programme. If John had fallen asleep, his stay of execution might well be postponed a few hours.
It was too much. John slid down to the floor.
The roll of toilet paper smacked Sherlock square in the nose. A muffled curse sprang from his lips in response. "John!" he cried, spying his friend on the floor. "Christ, did you re-injure your ankle?" He fell to his knees besides John, frantically performing a full-body.

"Mmmm."
As a matter of course, Sherlock generally neglected the needs of his transport. He'd cultivated this habit early on, the pesky hormones of puberty impeding brainwork. Hunger, sleep, thirst, or what have you; these were deemed a time-wasting chore. He brushed off basic biology at the tender age of twelve and four months (and three days, if you want to be precise).
Take my fingers. Push them harder. No, harder. No,

John screamed, voice rough from overuse. There'd been a lot of screaming orgasms in the last two weeks. "You came untouched! That's fucking
Sherlock's upside-down body slammed full-force into Mycroft's stomach, who then stumbled back off the landing. Instinctively, the boy curled around his brother and bore the brunt of the fall. He sustained a textbook greenstick fracture two inches above his right wrist, along with a fair slew of splinters.
"Oh, my... But of course, John. Anything you want," Sherlock's eyes dripped anew.
John's hands pulled into fists, yanking hard on his hair. Some of it broke off and twisted between his fingers. "Fucking fuck! Okay! Yes, I'm angry! But not at
"Which is?" John said, grimacing as he straightened out both legs. "You know what? Never mind. We can have this discussion some other time. Right now, I just want to get off the damn floor of the loo. Move over. I can do this myself." Sherlock got to his feet and backed to the sink.
Lestrade hovered above the two men uncertainly doing an awkward two-step, unsure as to how to proceed. All of a sudden, he felt like an intruder. He wasn't sure his presence was needed anymore. "So, you two better now?" Lestrade prodded.

"Mate. If you really
John sighed. "Because you've had experiences that you've kept mum about, for obvious reasons...shit, Sherlock. I'm going to say things and do things that trigger you, even if it's not on purpose." If Sherlock's eyes were sun off the ocean, John's were the blue-black depths of the Mariana Trench. "I won't mean to, and I'm going to feel bloody awful about it every damn time it happens." He sniffed. "But it will happen."
A snort burst from under the pillows. "You can see through the sheets? Amazing. Taction is touch, John...i.e.  physical contact." Sherlock lectured, as if addressing a second form class. "Skin-to-skin. Honestly, man. You're a writer, roughly speaking. Open up a thesaurus. Spare me from such asinine questions."
The doctor interrupted posthaste. "Greg, I really can't say what you're on about. If you seriously think that I'm..." and now Lestrade budged in, cutting John off at the pass.
Hand flying, John wanked as if his life depended on it, or at least the foreseeable future. He reveled in the slight cessation of pain, panting harder as his balls closed in on his cock. This was it - this was going to work, he just knew it. The fantasy female John envisioned (whom he was presently fucking balls-deep) incorporated some unusual new features. Traditionally a "tiny built blonde/sky blue eyes" kind of bloke, this willowy temptress had translucent cyan eyes and burnished copper-brown hair. Her mental visage shot sparks of pleasure straight to his hot, throbbing cock. John's free hand tensed unconsciously, illusory locks held taut in his grasp as he squeezed.
"Mmm, yeah, if you don't mind me saying so. Frankly, I didn't expect any different from you. The whole world knows your opinion on sentiment, you've certainly said it enough." Lestrade nodded.
― Sigmund Freud, Civilization and Its Discontents
"Yeah, but it's tolerable - just annoying. How are you?" John whispered, switching gears.
Sherlock had no choice, really. Kill yourself, or kill your friends. Not much of a brain teaser, that. In the end, he'd sustained scratches and full-body bruises. One simple step forward was all it would take. The knowledge overwhelmed him.
are you hinting at?" He leaned into Lestrade's personal space. "About whom are these thing in reference to? Tell me at once, I demand it."
"Christ, John, I am sorry," Sherlock gasped, ashamed. "I wasn't thinking. Please sit down." Sherlock gestured to the bed, which had been straightened up with what must be clean sheets. They were too white to be anything else. John flashed him an inscrutable look, which could have meant any one of a thousand things. Sherlock's bravado instantly withered and died.
there was the rub. The man had been dead for the last three years, so to speak. The specifics of the mission remained classified, including the stunt where he'd jumped off a building.
The DI, now chewing his lip in earnest, held his breath and cautiously rose up for a look-see. Sherlock's long legs knocked fretfully about, leather shoes gouging holes in the dirt. And, although Sherlock's limbs were growing increasingly twitchy, his words trickled into silence; the only noise now being his quick, shallow gasps whilst he breathed.
Pressing his right hand into service, Sherlock ran the flat of his palm to the hollow just below his left deltoid. One the third swipe up to his shoulder, John heard himself choke out a cry. A thin, colorless roll of silicone came forth out of nowhere. As the tall man doggedly repeated his actions, (rotating his arm for easier access), a thin circle of rubber now demarcated the border between real skin and... not real skin.
Once there was a way
"Right. Bear with me here, I am completely aware that you know all of this already," Sherlock paused to clear his throat. "Influenza is an insidious predator, attacking people when they are at their most vulnerable."
Love you forever and forever,
John's arms zinged, full of static. He surged upward on his elbows whilst Sherlock dropped, their mouths colliding with a "mmmmph!" It was a not-so-comfortable kiss, as kisses go - too much teeth, not enough lips, overenthusiastic tongues. Nevertheless, this was the communion of flesh they'd both ached for, and for that reason alone, was perfect.
"Ah," the consultant's voice rang strong from a distance. "That would be...no. *
Sherlock, unfortunately, derived no such feelings of release. His stomach clenched once he'd rid himself of outerwear and flung thoughtlessly on to the floor. For the bloody awful, umpteenth million time, reality sucker slapped the genius in the face. Baring his soul to John Watson entailed the baring of his corporeal person; every
The doctor persevered, peppering his lover's face and forehead with sweet, gentle kisses. "I love you..." he breathed, "and I'll continue to love you tomorrow, and the next day - forever.
"No, you have a very nice behind. My metaphor was in reference to how delicious they are!" the tall man tittered like a teenager.

on the other hand, quite amu -
"Please...yes. Oh God, yes. You can have me, I'll give you everything. Anything you want, just don't stop!" The little man's head flopped forward heavily, landing on Sherlock's taut chest. The genius accommodated to support John's weight, face stretched in a cheshire grin. Sherlock felt satisfyingly vindicated. "The Virgin", a coldhearted oddity, had sent John swooning.

"Irregardless, I think that you were experiencing some form of flaaa - " Greg abruptly gurgled, the very picture of a cat hacking up a hairball, "...were in a wonky altered state," Lestrade hastily amended what he'd been about to blurt out.
John sighed, and looked. Greg had obviously suffered enough grief for one day, and he himself hadn't fared much better. As for his flatmate, his attitude was definitely off. Sherlock came back after a case either jubilant over his own brilliance, or irascible and bitter because somebody
"Ye-eees?"
It was simple logic...which all things considered, could be judged rather unfortunate. Care for the needs of his transport, or chance Moriarty's underlings
Gingerly edging forward, John dared to smooth down the snarls in his hair. "Sherlock," he whispered. "Come back to me, stay with me." Chills shot down his back as Sherlock's eyes flicked open, vacuous and unfocused. "Sherlock! Look at me, love, I need you here, now." John all but jammed his face into Sherlock's in a bid to command his attention.
that would be...good." Considering his being a genius, and all, Sherlock's brain was failing him miserably. Where was his fluency of expression? His lexicon included over 131,963 words, not counting the 33,792 additional obsolete word annex, or the 43,363 derivative word sub-entries.
"I'll never get bored, John. You're unique! And, you challenge me in ways that I never expect!" Sherlock bawled so emphatically that his voice cracked, mid-yell.
John had not been abandoned or left behind. Snuffling, John left go. Hard, barking sobs shook his chest. Snot ran streaming from his nose to his mouth, but the doctor didn't care.
"S'all right. It's fine, it's all good," the genius mumbled. "Good news
"Piss off, you bloody berk. My legs feel much better...thanks, I think. You can stop with the ruthless manhandling." John flashed him a rueful grin; the cute, crooked one that always forced Sherlock's heart into bouts of frantic arrhythmia. "Now help me up. I need to walk around a bit to finish waking them up."
Use that big, brilliant brain and take this in. I. Feel. The same. Sherlock, Christ, I love you. I'm crazy about you. I'd follow you into the very depths of hell. In fact, nothing and no-one is going to keep me from you - except for you." He scrubbed a hand through his hair. "The two of us against the world, Sherlock. Together."
John's hands threaded into Sherlock's wild, woolly hair, drawing him in for a kiss. All the doctor wanted was to flip Sherlock down on his back and ravage that exquisite body.
He felt slimy, and shriveled, like veg left for dead in the crisper. For Christ's sake, he
The detective's eyes, virtually colorless in the late afternoon light, hungrily searched his face for clues. Being the subject of such single-minded scrutiny made Lestrade feel distinctly uncomfortable. "Well," he cleared his throat, "let's just say that you're not the only man who has secrets. And Sherlock, I believe that I'll keep it at that." Fidgeting with his safety belt, he added, "After all. It's not my story to tell, so you can put the damper on that little business you do with your eyes."
Lestrade made a face at such cheek. "Here." He handed John the pain meds, which John quickly swallowed with gratitude. The doctor decided to move the proceedings into the bathroom, the flat's usual makeshift surgery. It was easier said than done, but the doctor and the DI made it there in one piece. Twenty minutes and quite a bit of blasphemy later, the men emerged,  from the loo. Lestrade looked ridiculous, nose bound in a beige, thermoplastic nasal splint. The bland colour made his purpling bruises that much more lurid by comparison. John kept see-sawing on his crutches. Lestrade was forced to surreptitiously hold him upright. Both men had sweat beaded on their brows. Both men were obviously in pain.
The detective blanched in the face of Lestrade's rage. Sherlock's large hands remained clutched at his sides whilst he submitted to Greg's passionate pounding. Two black eyes, a swollen lip, and a sore stomach later, Lestrade had given him a hug. Considering the ferocity of Lestrade's thrashing, it was a toss-up to decide which had hurt more.
A large thunk combined with a curse startled John from his musings.
Sherlock stirred, terrified that he'd made a horrendous faux pas. He still had a chance of transmuting his course. Maybe, just maybe he could subtly reshape his confession of love into a simple commentary regarding the depths of their friendship. John was in his cups, after all. But, no. He would not be a coward. He'd wasted enough time as it was.
John was debating the dubious merits of a second hot cuppa when the familiar *
much to sort out."
"John, that's my point. That's precisely why I'm putting this on you. We already know what I want; I believe that I made myself clear," Sherlock stated, eyebrows lost under his fringe. "So the question is, what do you want, John? That's what I want to know."
(See the end of the chapter for
"Oi!" Lestrade bellowed for the umpteenth time. "Where the blazes did you go? Sherlock, did you find something?" In desperation he cried, "Are you still even here, you clot, or did you bugger off like normal!?" Tilting his head, the DI strained his ears for a comeback. He heard zilch, unless he counted the sweet chirps of birds. "
Sex came with self-help books, touting patchouli-scented candles for proper "ambiance". Sex came adorned, with blood-red rose petals scattered artfully on black silk sheets. Sex came scripted, with drawn out and highly elaborate scenarios. Men wined and dined women, looking for a one-off. Women tarted up for men, hoping for a ring. Twenty-somethings showed off their assets in red satin bustiers, lacy pink negligees, and naughty knickers with more holes than strictly necessary. John liked this part of sex, very much so.
"Shit. Well, of course. Why should I expect any different? Now you know. Can see. Deduce. Whatever. You know why I was snapping at thin air," John said stonily, gazing at his hands. "Brilliant. Just brilliant."
to be specific, John Hamish
The doctor stalled, hoping for clarification. Sherlock declined to speak, however, or even make eye contact. Breathing harshly, his fingers twisted together like dueling octopi; squeezing his hands free of blood.
"Sherlock, Sherlock.
To John's consternation, the detective's eyes had been rendered indistinct and colorless by the dull, yellow light from the hall. Neither man had suggested that the overhead lighting be used, hence the bedroom door still hung ajar. The little man nodded. "Good, Sherlock, that's... good.
John's mouth tilted up. "Spooning, Sherlock. It's called spooning. Besides, I have my own pressing needs to attend to. As it turns out, right now I need the loo. And for pity's sake Sherlock, what the bloody hell is 'taction'?" Grunting, he added, "And stop giving me that look, yeah? It gets really old after a while."
"Dear heart, oh my love," John breathed into his ear. "Please don't be afraid. Not of me, not of us." There's so much that I want to tell you, and show you, and..." he squirmed, attempting to ease his sore thighs. "There's so much. But," he smiled ruefully, "I need to change the venue, as it were. Both my bloody feet have fallen asleep."

"No, baby, shhhh... It's alright, we're okay, it's all good," the little man murmured between soft, ardent kisses. "I love you, I love you, I am here for you now."
in all of their days on the job had Sherlock voluntarily ridden in his car. In retrospect, Greg understood why Sherlock would find traversing London via panda car distasteful. So...what what this? What shenanigans were about to take place in his vehicle? Suspicious by nature and occupation alike, Lestrade was afraid that he knew.
, not re: artillery or shrapnel. He groaned and opened his eyes.
"Your body is a fresco, Sherlock. A beautiful, treasured work of art." John's words lingered in the air, tickling along the edge of his ear. The doctor's small frame was practically pasted to Sherlock; sweaty, and sticky, and
Twenty-two seconds until go-time. Sherlock adjusted the iPhone mount he'd positioned with mathematical precision on that bloody deathtrap of a metal shelf.
The doctor crossed his arms to rub at his biceps.
Greg cleared his throat again, trying to order his thoughts. "Right. Back to the case. The answer to your question is no, I don't think so. This bastard perpetrator is a smart one. He must have used gloves, and wore different shoes for each abduction. In addition, he managed to avoid every goddamn CCTV camera in London. Also, and each child was taken differently. He didn't leave much for us to go on. So," he hedged, "Will you come?"
Lestrade framed a question towards Sherlock with a lift of his brow, asking,

"Year-old dry wood, from Hudder's nephew. They have that farm out in Sussex; lost a hundred-year oak in a storm." Sherlock spun back to the flames, restlessly jostling the logs with the poker.

There, there he is. John sees pale, dead sightless eyes framed by red ribbons of blood. Sherlock has no pulse, his arm limp and loose as a dead fish. Hands pull John away from the body, and the doctor is too debilitated to stop them.
"What sodding stupid experiment is clogging the sitting room now? Mrs. Hudson just cleaned and vacuumed! Honestly, Sherlock, if I trip over any more stray body parts..." John shook his head, feeling the first hint of a migraine coming on. The memory of squished fingertips threading up between his toes was enough to make him feel ill.

"I'm impoverished for the lack of your fabulous cock," Sherlock joyously opined. "In veritably humble supplication, dear one, I meekly appeal to your baser animal nature." Screwing up his face, he wailed, quite pathetically overblown. John huffed out a laugh. Sherlock rather fancied blowing things out of proportion.
From day one, John saw that Sherlock was brilliant. After solving Andrew West's murder (but before being strapped to a lethal Semtex vest), a metaphor arose in John's mind to describe the detective's rare gift.
Lips forming a speculative moue, Sherlock repeated his manipulations. Now, however, he had both hands roaming industriously across John's chest. John's nipples tightened rock-hard, whilst he squirmed and thrashed on his mound of pillows. "Jesus, Sherlock, that's...yeah," John whimpered, "yeah, that's good - Christ, that's good. I thought you said you were a virgin!"
and I
John snapped out loud, his voice piercing the delicate silence.
To John's eternal delight, Sherlock squirmed in an adorable combination of mortification and arousal. Crimson color flooded his cheeks, neck and chest. John fought the crushing desire to consume this miraculous creature, body and soul.
Sherlock, whilst cognizant of sex's basic logistics, understood nothing of foreplay's minutiae. Nevertheless, John, honorable and stalwart companion, would never lead his best friend astray. John would know what he needed. John would know what to do.

John nodded, and then remembered their pitch black conditions. "Why not. Sherlock. We're not ill. Exactly what does H3N2 represent in our circumstance?"
A continuation of the last chapter, which was posted too early by accident. On that note, I did a fair bit of revising after it went up, if anyone is interested in giving it another look-see.
"John," Sherlock whispered, contrite. He brushed his full lips across the crown of John's head, automatically collecting data about the strangely coarse texture of grey hair.

Got you, you little pissant." He sat back up, now smiling, wielding the dildo like a BAFTA. "It kept slipping out of my hand, you know, because of the - "
The detective opened her mouth to express her opinion, but was waylaid by the noise of the umteenth deafening siren of the night. Two minutes later, a hefty man sporting a patchy brown mustache (partially chewed off, John surmised), wheeled the trolley over the uneven road. Its wheels grated in protest with each crack and divot, and John wondered how painfully jarring the return trip would be. A buxom redhead, uniform buttons straining painfully, jogged past the shops with their gear.
Boy, was this fun. I meant for the chapter to get to the nitty gritty, but I got tired. A reminder to the fandom that I am not a young woman. Besides...I have to pee.
"I've never been. I never saw it first-hand. But my aunt did," John continued, timbre tender. Hypnotic. "She took a whole mess of pictures. I was leery at first, she tended to give hours' long slide shows. My father always forced us to watch...he was
Also, it is not my desire to turn this story into a case fic. It's already gone from "lighthearted sexcapade" to "Notify the shrink, I need her to up my meds RIGHT NOW" as it is. I am actually using the case as a way to introduce Lestrade, who then of course, blabs. His lowdown on John forces Sherlock to reflect on how John suffered during their hiatus as well. Gee, thanks, Graham! No, honestly. Lestrade rocks. Because of him, the boys finally get their shit together, with no more secrets between them.
wee bit. The sensation startled me, that was all. They incurred no damage, John. Honestly, you can trust me." He wavered under John's suspicious glare, attempting to look earnest. He was telling the truth, after all, but John tended to be ridiculously cautious when it came to his lover's personal well-being.
"Now listen here...
"Not all men are worthy of love." - Sigmund Freud*
(See the end of the chapter for
Onward, Ho! Or, in this case, Onward, John, you dirty ho!
Sherlock leapt to his feet and leaned over John with a pained expression. "I...Uhm," the detective dithered, swiveling in an arc to scan the room for the obligatory plastic water pitcher replete with bendy straw. "Hold on, John. I will ask the nurses." Straightening up, Sherlock strode out of the room, relieved to have something helpful to do.
"John," he wiggled and whinged, desperately begging for...what. He didn't have a clue. "Oh, Jesus...dearest John, can we...can we,
...All your life
In fact, John amazed himself with his quick ability to adapt. The shoulder injury had been far more debilitating. Encouraging, that. He was keen to return to the surgery, mind-numbing claptrap or not. Wrangling snotty toddlers beat mouldering in the flat for months. Also...the money. He needed the money. Beans on toast doesn't cut it.
Not good. No, both of them, not so good. Keeping John's hand captive, Sherlock shifted his balance to plop down hard on his bum. The men rested shoulder to shoulder up against the tub. The twisted shame in John's countenance eased up a little, although Sherlock understood that this was undoubtedly due to fatigue rather than catharsis. John was a caregiver by nature, a desire running deep in his bones.

Drawing near, they bumped foreheads; their emotions too intense to lock eyes. Sherlock shifted lower, hiding his face in John's neck. Feeling decidedly fragile, he murmured, "I love you. John, I... so very much. I've never..." he hesitated, nuzzling John's ear, "loved anyone this much. Is
Unlike the speech center of his brain, John's body was brilliantly expressive; dare one say, deliciously loquacious, in fact. Sherlock let fly an uncivilized groan amidst the collision between his flesh and John's mouth. He lay prone and helpless, rapt by the entreaty of those inconceivably clever, thin lips brushing the rigid peaks of his nipples.
The detective must have been waiting just on the other side, because the door drew instantly inwards. "Hi," John breathed. "Can I come in?" He saw that Sherlock had undressed, now clad in a ragged grey t-shirt and cotton boxers. Poised atop Sherlock's cheekbones, his eyes glimmered with a strange, wavering light. Flashing John a sweet smile, he shuffled his bony feet backwards.

The doctor felt his blood pressure rise.
He started, the line of reasoning cutting off full stop. Sherlock's head jerked forward and dropped, bobbing one...two ...three times before falling limply to his shoulder. Lestrade watched Sherlock shake his hands twice, re-set his head on his shoulder, and stand as still as a statue.
John finally wearied of his own pompous posturing, and chose not to press any further. He was too tired to bandy words, mentally and physically, but above all, in his soul. At any rate, two more laps completed the job. John stopped, hunkered low on his crutches. "So."
. The soothing warmth (essence) of (Sherlock's) silky fabric permitted John to forget the temperature and focus on his cock. His fingers wrapped around it's increasing length, but he still needed more. John slipped his hand inside his pants to touch skin-to-skin.
Sentimental, supercilious, dangerous-deadly tripe, topped with a steaming pile of bullshit.
The doctor only hoped that if Sherlock took any new cases during his hiatus he remembered to collect the client's cheque. The detective got lost in the mystery of the case, most often completely forgetting the notion of bills to be paid, food to be purchased, etc.
John lived with a strong sense of his place in Sherlock's personal hierarchy of need; somewhere between "Go buy more milk" and "You're slowing us down".

"Sherlock, my dear, don't be daft. This, here," John snatched up both of Sherlock's hands, weaving their tense fingers together. "You - and me," John yanked up, jerking their clasped hands between them, "we're together, yeah? This..." he squeezed, "is incredibly special to me." John, still clutching at Sherlock, bodily manhandled his lover to share a furious kiss. "You're right. This isn't what I'm used to. It's better, you're better, the
had bungled up the evidence and the case had not yet been solved. "Yeah, okay. I'm sorry I've been such an arse. It's possible that I've had a bit too much to drink, and I was already in a funk as it was."
He though sternly.
"Here, wear this," Sally grumbled, yanking off her sports coat and wrapping it around John's shoulders. "I suppose Sherlock wasn't around when you fell?"
Before finishing up with the discharge paperwork, a soft-spoken nurse had split the left trouser leg up to the thigh. John watched, dismayed as her practiced hands ran stainless steel surgical scissors along the seam. The woman, prematurely greying hair bobbing over her eyes with the effort, flashed him a genuinely sympathetic smile.
Sherlock snorted. "As if!"
pisses me off like you wouldn't believe." Sweat popped up on his wrinkled brow, eyes ensconced in a face consumed by misery.
Sherlock eyed John as he laid on the pathetically low thread-count sheets, and even worse hospital mattress. His skin, colorless and weathered, sent a sickening series of cramps in his stomach.
Sherlock sternly suppressed the urge to evilly laugh, "MWHAA-ha-ha-ha..."

close to his special places, so sensitive that John thought he might explode despite his cock not yet even been touched.
The conversation continues. Sherlock tries to dodge the bigger issue, but John's stubborn nature just can't leave it be.
Unlike his consulting detective, Lestrade learned from his mistakes. The ability to explore the reasoning behind his errors was what had honed his skills as a detective. Lestrade had an excellent reputation as a DI, despite what certain geniuses might say.
Forgotten, the crutches spilled to the floor.
Now it was John's turn to roll his eyes. "Mmm. Charming. Such a lovely comparison." He shook his head to shake away the image. "Well, my dear Holmes, I aim to please.  So, get ready," the doctor hissed through his teeth, "here I go." John's hips rose up, Sherlock's meeting him halfway. Soon, slapping noises set a tempo for their groans.
Despite Sherlock's whinging, John luxuriated in the peculiar sensation of being pampered. This felt decidedly different than pity. Sherlock was acting out of love, pure and simple; and it was okay to accept this. It was.
My Christian name. Correctly. Now, I know that it's a bit of a joke with us, well, more with you than with me...but, Jesus. Sherlock. Please. Please! Tell me what's wrong!"
Sherlock besmirched deities from three separate religions before locating the string of the light bulb. Thus far, the search had gone rather poorly. He'd come close to tipping arse over elbow, tripping over an empty plastic bin. He'd stepped into something sticky. The substance sucked at the soles of his shoes. He'd sliced his thumb open after jamming it into a rusted metal shelf. Sherlock cursed again, sucking on the much maligned digit. He tasted iron and old pennies. Splendid. His skin barrier had been breached, and now he'd bled. Such a fine use of taxpayer monies, purchasing such rubbish. Dangerous mould spores flittered across his consciousness.
Against his better judgement, the genius acknowledged the summons. He opened his eyes and took a good hard look at his blogger. Lestrade, he couldn't bear to confront. John, he had still yet to deduce. "Feeling any better?" Sherlock queried blandly. "I see that you've chosen to self-medicate with alcohol for the second time in the two days since surgery. Are the analgesics not helping as they should?"
Once again, John followed behind poised with notebook and pencil. Once again, his gun wedged up against his backside, his fists curled and ready to fly.
Please please me oh yeh, like i please you
Sherlock's eyelids fluttered in confusion. "I do trust you, John. I've never
"Shush. Enough talk," Sherlock murmured lovingly. "Ease up, so I can move back."
"Surely...John, you weren't there to
What?
The "not skin" matched the tone and surface texture of Sherlock's epidermis in every conceivable way. For all John could tell, his lover had slipped an elastic band onto his bicep as a mean-spirited joke. A random memory shot into John's conscious mind; no, not random, but incredibly apt. "Is this - did you use something like this when you faked your... you know. When you
Giggling, Sherlock patted John's arse. "It's obvious, John. You're my muse!" He dramatically cleared his throat, for absolute peak bloody voice gorgeousness. "And of course, you will bathe with my gracious assistance, you most precious, delectable man."
"No. Tragically, I could not. Dreams, and such. But, in order to regain my life, to even have a life, I had to hold secrets quite close to my heart. Hence...the costume. The 'vest'. An alternate skin, as it were," Sherlock mused, eyes darting. "Along with a fabulous story - and a good coat."
"Sherlock, love. You've got to relax. I hate to point this out, but you're a vir-" the doctor soothed, simultaneously reflecting unease.

it. The filth. I can tell all the way from here. Pervert! Another unexplored kink. Oh bugger, think of all the possibilities, love. You know every single manky hole in the city." John groaned, bucking up his pelvis. "I'm getting harder just imagining it...me, on my back...on ripped cardboard..."
The cacophony of police sirens abruptly rose in volume, and John blinked as a blur of one, two, three police cars whizzed past in the cross street. Tires squealing, the officers followed Sherlock's trail. John smiled at the ironic twist of order.
"I'm Looking Through You" - The Beatles
...like the right affable bastard he is usually. In point of fact, Sherlock," the DI bit his lip, "John looked bloody awful. Is he having a lot of post-operative pain, is that it?" The recalcitrant consultant huffed and picked at the skin around his nails. "Or, God help him, complications because of the surgery? Come on, Sherlock..." Greg's voice sounding much sharper now, "seriously." He snarled. "Spill."
He saw Sherlock's hands tremble, and for some reason it steadied him. He had absolutely no idea what he was doing when it came to dating a man; yet, from what Mycroft inferred, Sherlock had never dated a soul.
I think I rushed this by submitting so quickly after writing. I polished it up enough that I felt that it needed re-posting.
"Ooof!" John lost his breath. "Wanker!" He slapped Sherlock's arse. "Lift up, before I asphyxiate."
They clumped up the stairs with taut military precision. As usual, the door to the flat was wide open. The muted sounds of crap telly drifted from the sitting room, possibly
"Yeah, yeah. Shut up and kiss me, you berk. There won't be any more
The detective snorted. "Merely doing my duty. Don't get used to it." She smiled down at him, expression belying her unfriendly words. "You're not as much of an arse as your flatmate. I am simply trying to keep you stable until the medics arrive

John forced himself not to ruminate on the image of swarms of bacteria, rimming the spout. Sometimes, medical acumen hindered more than helped; in this particular case, whilst his lips wavered so close to the metal.
John gaped up at his flatmate. Sherlock towered over him, a full six feet of artless detective. His friend's face radiated a confused jumble of regret, dejection, and panic - emotions John had never witnessed him expressing before.
"That would be lovely, thanks," John mumbled, packing away his supplies.
“You're going to do me in one day, do you know that? John groaned in submission. “I'm going to keel over and die because all ten pints of my blood are in my cock. Fucking hell, love.
"Ahhhhh...let me see how it goes first, yeah? If I drop on my arse, you'll know I need help." John gathered himself up and ambulated awkwardly down the hall.
or...love. Too pedestrian, useless, and boring. Cold, hard reason directed Sherlock's world view. Anything more would be frivolous. So, here in this moment, one change of clothes pending, John panicked. What if his body betrayed him?

"Well," John tipped his head thoughtfully, "this big boy certainly did the job. Having said that, it's no substitute for you
Sherlock's pale, but sane eyes conducted calculated sweeps across Lestrade's face. The DI stared amazed, as the genius's face went from impassive disinterest to crumpled in on itself in misery. For the first time in Letrade's company, Sherlock wept.
Sorry this took so long to get up. Having a bit of writer's block. I kept thinking that "Yes, I'll be able to post today.", only to turn on my computer and feel compelled to  rework the whole damn thing. I need to find a beta to bounce ideas off of. Any takers? :)
The soldier reached down deep for control, but the final fact fair drove him mad.
John had forgotten how claustrophobic long hair could be after years of severe military haircuts.
"Shit, John, your use of profanity has corrupted my Broca's area." He squeezed John's bountiful arsecheeks. "I had a dog as a child...
"What I'm trying to say is, that,
Irregardless, by the end of the second month, life reverted to their status quo - Sherlock being all mysterious with his cheekbones... and his collar turned up so he looked cool.
Sherlock took a moment to tighten the sash on his dressing gown before flashing Greg a spine-chilling grin. "Having breakfast, of course. I would have expected you to deduce this, seeing as you
His lips puckered as if he'd been sucking lemons - and not his lover. If John still had the ability to be think, then he himself wasn't doing his job. Annoying. The detective's dander rose. His demeanor changed, no longer 'playful kitten' but 'slavering jaguar', a beast beguiled by the smell of fresh meat. (Later on, reveling in their post-coital haze, he forgave himself for such lusty aggression. John was simply too delicious not to devour.)
Surprise shot over Sherlock's face. "What do you mean?" he spat. "It's so obvious, your anger. You're practically dripping with rage, John, I can see it." And then, in a softer voice, Sherlock added, "I watch you, you know."
"Hi, I'm John Watson. I'm not gay."
of you should be holding anything back." Greg's attention flipped over to the doctor, who'd started shifting anxiously in his chair. "John, don't you agree?"
John pumped his cock faster. It was fully erect now, red-tipped and stiff. His head dropped to his chest in relief, pleasure and excitement drawing his mind away from the throb of his ankle.
Sherlock fingered the planes of John's eager face, limned rosy gold in the light. Without stopping his ministrations, the little man twisted to press his gilded cheek into Sherlock's cupped palm. John's action resembled that of a feisty ginger cat in need of a scratch. The strands of sliver threaded through John's ashy blonde hair glimmered which each turn of his head. John Watson, the man cast in silver and gold.
Having said that, there may be typos and possibly some issues with consistency. I wrote half of this on my phone on the way to see relatives.
John's chin unexpectedly dropped to his chest.
"John," Sherlock gabbled finally, "here's the thing. It has come to my attention by the things that you have said; that you think, or indicate, rather," he sighed, "
The doctor suddenly blanched, thinking about the chain of events he'd set in motion. New clothes meant changing. Changing meant removing his jeans. Unless he wanted a repeat performance of the loo he might need a bit of assistance.
Besides, the stylish oak bed wasn't even his. It belonged to Mrs. Hudson, like the breakfast table and John's battered red recliner (sans Union Jack). The quantity of fluffy pillows on said behemoth of a bed held exactly 0.00% of his interest. The fact that the wood stain matched his hair colour was a fortuitous happenstance, or though John privately mused.
"Yeah, I guess you're right," Lestrade smiled wanly. "I -
"What?" the detective snorted. "John, I'm not quite sure what you're getting at, but I - "
John pulled back and looked up, not that he was able to see anything. It was important to demonstrate his focus. "I'm listening, Sherlock. I'll do my best. I'll...
"Legs back, or up? Or both?" Sherlock groaned, shaking salty sweat from his eyes. "Be more specific. On my end, it's bloody fantastic."
More burns. Serious burns."

For the record, I found the the quote by Eckhart Tolle only after I'd written the last chapter. I felt brilliant for a whole five minutes...go, me!
"Look. I've been a right git today. I'm sorry." John sighed again, heavier this time. He attempted a one-sided grin. "Yeah, you wanker. Stop dancing around and give me a hand."
"Are you sure?" John moaned, reaching for a refill and downing it in one go. He threw down his glass to make air quotes.
"John. I didn't know. Has this gone on the whole time, the...dreaming?"
John now listlessly debated the likelihood that this particular patch of jeopardous fungi was a component in another experiment. It was that, or the result of shoddy housework. Either way, it didn't matter, black mould posed a serious heath hazard.

"Ha! What would Sherlock be, if not rude? Possibly, he and I are both ridiculous," the doctor protested. "Sherlock for being a egotistical wanker, and I for putting up with his outrageous behavior. Nevertheless, it sounds as if he's solved another crime tonight. Perhaps, he can have his moment in the sun. And

"What - ah. But of course," Sherlock said, rummaging blithely in his trousers for his wallet. "You can count on me." He swept into the Belstaff with a flourish and shot out the door.
He'd meandered without purpose all the way to the back side of the playground, Lestrade by himself on the other. Glowered impatiently, Sherlock scanned over the length of the park.
Sherlock made no move to join him; rather, Sherlock made no movement at all.
No matter what, I was never alone."
"Sherlock. Hey." John reached up to brush away sweaty strands of hair plastered to the taller man's forehead. "Come on, you. I want that cuddle we just talked about. Skin-to-skin, yeah?" The doctor demonstrated his nakedness with a flourish of wiggling hips. A deep line creased the bridge of Sherlock's nose.
Eventually, John felt sated and twisted the tap. On to the kitchen for some food.

"But, John..."
And let me finish. This isn't a 'Let's make John feel less like an imbecile now that we've shagged' moment. This is a 'I'm going to shut the fuck up and let John finish a sentence' moment. Alright, you bloody git?" John's own face reddened.
**********
The detective pushed back from the table, striding up to the window. His head dropped down to his chest and he sighed. John found that he desperately needed some air. The flat shrank exponentially the longer Sherlock wavered, shoulders rounded inward and hunched towards the floor in guilt.
Sherlock groaned, shuddering from a muddled mass of emotions. "I can't, they're not...why you - ." He was prevented from saying more by John's palms, which had unexpectedly cradled his jaw. They felt soft, loving and gentle, yet but pressed hard enough to seal his lips shut.

A sharp intake of breath later, the doctor heard Sherlock clear his throat hard before lifting a foot over the threshold. "No, John. I'm coming. Just stay put," Sherlock murmured, voice congested. "I...need to freshen up in the loo."
John tapped the power of Three Continents Watson and quickly got down to business.
John didn't know how much he should panic. Granted, the previous twenty-four hours had been like living in a madhouse, what with navigating an emotional minefield whilst his flatmate struggled to play nurse. Sherlock had cracked from far less. However, right now the man should be floating in a virtual sea of endorphins, fast asleep. Witnessing Sherlock's magnificent, breathtaking orgasm had almost brought John to tears.
"The moment I left the bloody continent, and the
For all Sherlock's fine efforts, yanking on the string only yielded a sickly, orange lambent glow. Sherlock grimaced, staring at his hands. His enviable, milky pale complexion, a feature that John extolled, was now more reminiscent of an over-ripened, slightly mouldered canteloupe. Whatever. Irrelevant. Still, his expression reflected a hint of concern. This light source was clearly insufficient to satisfy the scenario that John had put before him. Sherlock checked his watch. There were less than five minutes until go time. Turning on his phone's flashlight, the detective made do.
John remained still, awaiting his flatmates big speech, yet nothing seemed forthcoming from the lanky man's lips. John tilted his head forward whilst lifting his brows; a clear indicator to Sherlock to spill it, already. He started to rotate one hand in a "gimme" gesture. It was a no-go.

" John bawled, "don't forget milk!" His flatmate gave no reply, and John groaned.
"Kerr um tha kunet," Sherlock growled, reaching around to squeeze at John's arse. Apparently, multilingual expressions of sentiment made the genius feel randy. John's hibernating cock gave a yawn, stretched, and opened one eye.
Sherlock paused, full lips pressed into a line. He nodded briefly before allowing John to embrace him. "I am tired, John," he confessed, the words falling from his lips in a torrent. "My brain is on fire, yes? Brilliant or not, the sad fact is that the bloody thing never shuts off. Ever. Sometimes, John, I honestly hate possessing this neurological mine field," Sherlock said, his right index finger cocked and aimed like a gun at his temple. John promptly yanked Sherlock's hand down and kissed it.
"No!" Greg startled. "No, nothing like that, Sherlock. I swear!" He rubbed his forehead in exhaustion. "Actually, I was hoping that you'd go in for both of us, and we'd drink it here, in the car. I'm not much up for anything other than a hefty dose of caffeine and some painkillers," this last said with an apologetic smile. "Honestly, if you're not up to going in, which I completely understand, mind, I'll just drive us back to the flat. I should...yeah. I should have John have a look-see at my," he gestured lamely, "my nose. I don't know much how this goes, with broken noses. I might need to have the damn thing re-set."
The detective pushed himself back upright, and quietly considered his friend. Voice bland, Sherlock murmured "Are you willing to accept my help now?" He held up the clasp in his pale, plate-sized palm. It lay still, looking innocuous and innocent...John knew better. This little fucker'd been sent straight up from the fiery depths of hell.

John, coping with his first day at home.
John doubled back to Afghanistan; to the make-shift hospital in Helmand. By the time he'd been shot, the army surgeon had operated on multiple...no, hundreds of burn victims. IED's, mortar rounds, gas explosions, overturned Humvees, even plain, old-fashioned house fires... you name it, he'd been witness to the ruination extremely high temperatures caused. The doctor dearly wished that he hadn't. Dearly.

To be precise, it was Mycroft's arm that snapped, rather than one of the baby's tiny, twig-like limbs. The incident, as it were, occurred on Boxing Day; the irony of which the Holmes then and forever henceforth ignored.

The DI promptly snapped from his fugue into management mode. Drawing even closer, Greg towed Sherlock closer to his own chest to steady him. "Right. Right. Okay. Listen mate, let's get go back to the the bench."
Ooh, oh, oh, oh

He glumly contemplated his ankle.

I don't ever want to hear such rubbish coming out of your mouth again." His deep blue eyes darkened with heartache. John's lips twisted in a parody of a smile. He tried again. "And, weeping is a physiological - and a normal, may I add, response to great stress." Sherlock grimaced, ashamed of being thought weak. "Don't give me that, love! Aren't I right?" Sherlock glared down at his hand, pretending that John hadn't spoken.
Over me
"I think that this is the least of my worries," Sherlock snorted derisively. The guilt was making him cranky.
"Lestrade..." Sherlock scrubbed his face with his hands. "Spit it out, will you? Just tell me. I've got a full plate as it is." Despite himself, Sherlock shot his eyes toward the en suite. "John is..." His eyes dropped to the floor with a heart-rending sigh. "I am
The detective, having the advantage of a superior intellect and excellent powers of deduction, slowly drove John out of his mind. And, he swallowed. Had there ever been any doubt that Sherlock would refuse anything John chose to give?
John howled helplessly in pain.
He wished Sherlock had left it alone.
"So," Lestrade sighed, shifting the car into park. "Question. How much of all this history have you told John?"

he growled, the impulsive expression of ire piercing Greg's skull.
He'd been outwitted for once, played for a fool by the insane Moriarty. The man was more than a match for Sherlock's intellect. Moriarty, master villain, the unequivocal victor of their sick, twisted game.
Horribly, horribly short. More like a few paragraphs than a chapter. On the other hand, it's December 17th and I have yet to put one ornament on my very bald, very sad Christmas tree.
fractal patterns whilst trimming their Norway spruce tree. Once a mathematician, always a mathematician, Papa later quipped (after an aside conversation with Mycroft, the man not knowing fractals from fractions).
"Yes. Small mercies. Quite." The tall man slitted his eyes, irritated. "What evidence have you collected thus far? Do you have the files to give me? Is this something I can solve from the flat?"
Mrs. Hudson had slapped him in the face.
therapists (hateful, sanctimonious, overbearing idiots, the lot of them), Sherlock launched into what he hoped wasn't perceived as hateful, sanctimonious, and overbearing claptrap, whereby he finished up sounding like an idiot. Nevertheless, he didn't hold out much hope. At least he had better taste in apparel.
After what felt like an eternity, John's stomach had expelled all its contents, down to bile, spittle and all. Unfortunately, his autonomic nervous system wasn't paying the slightest attention. Abdominal muscles spasmed in hateful mutiny, emotional turmoil now running the show. The little man heaved so intensely and often John's oxygen intake decreased. Brilliant, of course his body thought it time for a new psychosomatic condition.
Sex, and one last confession - not necessarily in that order. This is the second to last chapter, I think. The whoopee will show up in Chapter 53. After this, on to smaller (hopefully) and better things.
"Eww, Sherlock. That's disgusting, just letting your spunk lay there," John wrinkled his nose.
you idiot, which means, if you are not ready - ."
The DI's physical stamina had swiftly waned as of late - a strange state of affairs, to be sure. Most assuredly, had nothing whatsoever to do with his increase in smoking. At any rate, Greg's chest hurt. He rubbed small circles into his pectorals, the muscles unexpectedly sore after being Sherlock's airbag. He pushed his right hand under his left shoulder, half-convinced that his heart would pop straight through his ribcage if he didn't take the time to simply breathe.
Sherlock grunted and shuffled side-to-side as if drunk. "I must apologize..." he muttered tiredly, "for the recent reprehensible behavior. My loss of control was appall -"

Sherlock popped up on one elbow, instinctively reaching for John. He slipped one plate-sized hand under his back and drew John into in his arms. The men huddled together, neither speaking, breathing hard. Sherlock fought off the temptation to rock, despite how it quieted his mind.
You know I love you still.

Without his noticing, John's hand slowed down to a crawl. His fist then stopped completely, but still clutched his cock; during which it had slumped to half-mast.

Sodding sex drive; absurd, daft, shallow, physical
"John," Greg murmured, clasping his hands in the space between his widespread knees. And John shuddered, shrinking into his jumper like a turtle.
Eyes wide with indignantion, Sherlock erupted, both fists slamming down hard on the table. John jumped in unison with the myriad of char-broiled toast crumbs. These crumbs, these remnants of toast that his best friend had made just for him; falling from his plate to his lap. Bitter tannins coated the length of John's tongue. Once again, he felt his gorge rise.
"It appears that with my...eh...blunt manner, that I have implied a disregard...that is, I have treated our relationship with disrespectful frivolity, in that through my thoughtless wording I may have inadvertently indicated..." His head sunk to his hands. "John! Sentiment is useless and a high-minded twat! I hate it!"
As per usual, Sherlock's suggestion was brilliant. A different set of fingers slicked up, phalanges lengthier and fine-boned. One finger became two, 'til three long fingers plunged into the detective's arse. John's blue eyes darkened, almost black, consumed by blown pupils. He found another, superior use for his own fingers, short distal phalanx be damned.
In Sherlock's brain, the spastic voice-over of a play-by-play announcer bawled in hysterical amazement, “

"Yes, but of course. If you'll give me twenty minutes to prepare, we can ride to the scene together." Sherlock shot up to his full 6'1" height, whirling to his room without pausing for Greg's reply on way or the other. He'd have to move fast to get himself situated, considering the lengths that he went to. The confrontation with John would have to be put on the back burner, something he was sure John would approve. To be honest, Sherlock harbored doubts that John would give the subject more leeway, and his absence in the flat furnished them both with a respite.

Sherlock heaved a great sigh of relief. "Yeah. Okay. I've deduced, John, you little tart, that you need my gigantic cock up your arse - balls slapping at your arse cheeks. So hard, John. I'm so hard, my balls so tight looking at your ripe, beautiful arse." The detective reached down, lifting his penis; cradling it in the palm of his left hand. For now, the touch was for demonstration, only. One pump and he'd be gone, seed ejecting from the glans like a rocket.
"Yes."
"I'll shoot you a text. Yeah. I got it," John moaned and threw his head back. "First the meds, then the ice. And then,
His bladder was calling. Just peachy. Manhandling his leg to the floor, John clutched his crutches. "One the count of three. One...two...
Finally, finally, finally, Sherlock shows John his scars.
, Sherlock. Your penis should be categorized a lethal weapon."
Irregardless, perhaps incorporating hand signals and a sock puppet, the lovers settled on the appropriate new venue. The kitchen table, a.k.a. Sherlock's holding place for experiments provided the perfect height for their needs. This time, John voiced nary an objection whilst Sherlock toted him through hallway and into the kitchen.
"Enough with that nonsense." John snapped, amending his snarl with a kiss. "You and I both know you're not a sociopath, high functioning or otherwise. As far as - " John breathed, unable to speak without a waver in his voice.
