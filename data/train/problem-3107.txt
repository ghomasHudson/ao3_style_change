be there for Hannah too; perhaps the right push would set things back on course. He would find Hannah when they were sure to be alone and declare his romantic desire for her; from there, the spark would grow naturally from their existing bond. Simple.
. Castiel grit his teeth; he’d recognize that condescending tone anywhere. As he drew closer, the glow in Michael’s eyes became ever more apparent—not the white-blue of grace, but the frostier blue of Djinn magic.
Castiel smoothed a hand languidly over Dean’s hip until it settled against his lower back as Dean arched beautifully up against him, gasping broken versions of his name when a sensitive spot came under Castiel’s ministrations.
to go smoothly, Castiel suspected they’d all be patting down their pockets for a stray rabbit’s foot or lucky coin, so unusual a circumstance would it be.
And yet, even though the legends told a tale of deep, romantic love born of a predetermined connection, each of them ended with a unity ceremony
Dean’s number was in the air almost before Crowley had finished speaking, but the significantly discounted rate seemed to have appeased several in the crowd. Two more bids went up in quick succession and Dean growled under his breath.
Selfishly, petulantly, Castiel could not help but direct some of his frustration at those very books themselves. Somehow, it felt as though a promise made to him had been broken. In stories, romantic love was such a powerful, visceral, thing, something all-encompassing that produced a deep need for closeness and intimacy, something people killed for and died for.
Hannah started out into the clearing towards the water, and Castiel followed behind her. From the trees it hadn’t looked like anything special, but the closer they got, the more detail—or lack thereof—Castiel noticed. The lake wasn’t just calm, it was
"Wash the dishtowels at home or throw them out," Dean added over his shoulder on his way back inside. "If you bring fleas into my cafe, I'll kill you."
He’d gone that night to Dean’s hut, banged on his door until Dean let him in, demanded that Dean talk to him about this, about everything, about
It would only be much later that Castiel would find it odd that none of the stories he’d been told ever mentioned the Princess’ caretaker.
“Hannah, please don’t blame yourself,” he said when he thought himself capable of speech and when Hannah’s sobs had lessened slightly, “In truth, I’m…” The bubble in his chest inflated suddenly and a hysterical half-laugh escaped him. “...
“Filthy.”
They stared dumbly at one another, eyes flickering intermittently between vials and faces. The contents of the unfamiliar vial matched those of Castiel’s almost exactly, except that where his glowed faintly blue, the other boasted an iridescent shine that shifted minutely between purple and green.
“Alright,” Sam sighed, placated, “I’ll take the first shift.”
Gradually, the colors of the forest around him grew more vibrant, the air more crisp, a telltale sign that the kingdom’s famed oasis was not far off. Castiel wondered if that was Dean’s intended destination; one of the other guards had likely mentioned it to him. Locals loved to boast to foreign visitors about the blue waters that stretched half a mile in all directions, surrounded by plants in every color imaginable. According to legend, the oasis had been a gift from the creators, a beautiful meditative place where one might find peace in an otherwise weary world. Some even claimed the water offered minor health benefits.
Ever since Dean had gone to check on him, they’d been skirting around each other like tetchy cats. Questions were asked only when necessary, answers were given in clipped tones and with the fewest amount of words possible. Meetings in the bunker’s hallways consisted of stony faces and clenched jawlines, or outright denial of one another’s presence. Narrowed gazes followed retreating backs long after they had disappeared through doorways, followed by expressions that might have been apologetic if pride would stop getting in the way.
Castiel moved swiftly towards the kitchens, keeping an eye out for the current head chef who was wont to tut at him about the improprieties of a prince preparing food or drink for himself.
SO: Did you write the porn yet?
The urge to rub at his nose for the four hundredth time was strong, but Dean knew it would help nothing, red and raw as he already was. His doctor had assured him that despite a rough start, things would get better gradually now that he was past the first few rounds of immunotherapy.
“Her majesty has graciously offered me the services of her personal tailor,” Hannah said, “I’m scheduled for a consultation tomorrow, so that she may start on my gown.”
What if he did not find Princess Hannah suitable?
Castiel sighed and closed his eyes before answering. “Lucifer may have…worn me out more than I originally let on. But I will heal, and be ready to fight the Darkness again soon, I assure you.”
By the end of a full twenty-four hours, Sam had worked himself all the way up to frantic. Despite Castiel’s insistence, he clearly had not slept.
. I’d still be rotting away in Hell if it weren’t for you, but more importantly, I wouldn’t be the same person if I hadn’t met you. Neither would Sam. And hell, do you know how much closure it must give Claire to still have you around?”

“So?”
The gentle lull of kneading dough was gradually replaced with the crisp, wet sounds of produce being cut. Curious, Castiel wandered closer to watch as Dean worked his paring knife rhythmically through a ripe, red apple.
There were delighted murmurs around the room and even Dean raised an eyebrow, intrigued. There were several here who bought into the fetishized ideal of the male omega if the half-phrases that reached him were anything to go by; many were drawn to the idea of an omega who could not be impregnated and thus would necessitate no additional precautions. Dean was far more interested in this Castiel’s build; an omega over six feet was fairly uncommon regardless of primary sex.
him. Castiel had not been picturing himself wrapping her in his arms, but he was determined to fix that.
“...Hannah?” Castiel asked numbly, more barely-formed thought than actual question.
“And you are not?”
There he stayed, limbs slackened in repose and gaze directed outwards over the oasis as the sun dried him. Every so often, Dean would swing the leg that dangled off the side of the tree trunk lazily back and forth, the tips of his toes just barely skimming the surface of the water.
Hannah placed her smaller hand on top of his where it rested on the arm of his chair, squeezing gently. “Thank you,” she said sincerely, “That would make him—and me—very happy.”
The bowl he’d been rinsing slipped from his fingers, clattering noisily against the basin. Castiel blinked at it.
He wasn’t ready for the immediate chaos. Cas’ wings snapped into focus and whipped outwards roughly, knocking into the nearby storage rack and sending several glass containers smashing to the floor. Wind appeared from nowhere and blew around the small kitchen, and the pots and pans that hung on the wall clattered together noisily.
Two hours passed in silence, despite Dean’s numerous attempts to grow a pair and think of some concise way to explain to Castiel why Amara’s statement had been utter bullshit. The night air chilled rapidly around them, and Dean cursed himself for not bringing a heavier jacket. He didn’t realize he had been shivering until Cas’ voice cut through the quiet.
The remaining few hours slid by in too much of a rush for him to pay any real kind of attention, and before he knew it, he and Hannah were standing in the archway of the presentation balcony. Hannah looked radiant in the vivid purple gown the Queen had commissioned for her.
"You know," he said, crouching down and offering his hand, "it's
Castiel gulped in between shaking breaths. “I...apologize…” he managed, blinking dazedly up at Dean’s lovely face.
“No need to be so modest, Dean,” Michael crowed, gesturing as though addressing an unseen audience. Dean winced. “Let’s see how they look on you.”
Fun Fact #4: The author is at least three of the ten people willing to get into Meg's bed.
Hannah smiled. “Yes, that’s what I said too. Even Anna hasn’t ever been to it, but I suppose we don’t have any better leads, do we?”
, Castiel.” Dean exhaled sharply, irritated. “You and your kingdom have shown me great hospitality, and I am grateful for it. But make no mistake; my loyalty lies unquestionably with Hannah. If you hurt her—”
Perhaps he should have felt afraid, and perhaps some rational part of him was. But another—decidedly unwise—part of him felt something dark stir in his own blood, something hot and vicious that made his stomach swoop and had him aching for Dean to shove inside him already.
“Let’s go again, shall we?”
“Is that so, your highness?” Dean had clearly gotten his meaning. “Then, I didn’t tempt you away from Hannah; I simply
“What are you called?” Castiel asked as the man ducked into the alcove, “Besides ‘Winchester’?”
"Is it okay?"
“I told you,
to touch him in any way. He spat a summation of those thoughts at the face in front of him, the words sharp as they lashed themselves out of his mouth.
Well, Dean never truly
Dean brought his hand down across his other cheek this time. Castiel was prepared enough to expect it but not prepared enough that he could conceal his reaction; a startled yelp found its way out of him, earning himself two more slaps.
Eons later, long after the first beings had come and gone, a mighty King and his beloved Queen ruled over a massive territory. They were generous, benevolent monarchs, well-loved by their subjects.
“You’re a menace,” he growled against Dean’s infuriating smile. Dean only laughed in between kisses.
Dean laughed at his own joke while Sam rolled his eyes in exasperation.
Cas looked annoyed but seemed too tired to argue. He shuffled past Dean to sit on his bed. “Yes. It’s part of the healing process, no cause for concern.” He was sitting up straight like he usually did, but it wasn’t with the same effortless ease. He swayed slightly, and Dean could see his shoulders shaking with the effort.
There was a bite to his words, and Dean suddenly felt like Cas was accusing him of something he didn’t know he’d done. He rolled his eyes and nudged a shoulder against the door, pushing it open and stepping inside as he said: “Listen, if we know what’s wrong Sam and I can try to find something to help you out, so just tell me—what’s—uh…”
“No, that’s…actually, I wanted to see if you maybe wanted to…to try it with—with me. Can’t, uh, can’t have you thinking what you experienced was a good reflection of what it’s like to kiss me, ya know?” Dean laughed nervously at his own joke, lowering his eyes to the floor again as his face flushed. Castiel didn’t answer right away, and Dean must have taken that as rejection, because he moved to turn back down the hallway, saying “I—I was just kidding, don’t worry about—“
To his surprise, Dean didn’t look pleased by the offer. He opened his mouth to say something but seemed to reconsider before finally trying again.
“Thank you, Inias.”
The smile slipped slowly from Hannah’s face, replaced by trepidation and perhaps a little guilt. “Dean…” She glanced at Castiel, but he had no answer for the question behind her eyes. “It may be unfair of me to ask any more of you, but I must; will you accompany me to the western kingdom?”
effect on Castiel, even if he had misinterpreted the circumstances. Was there harm in being straightforward with him now? In his apology he’d stated that his actions had been born of desire he’d temporarily lost control over, but that could mean many things; Castiel was leary of misreading his intentions a second time.
Meg yanked the black fabric away from Castiel in one swift motion and Dean made his decision then and there.
Dean’s eyes were hooded and pleading, but it was clear there was some amount of shame attached to the request. Why?
Blessedly, there were soft footsteps from inside the room and the door swung open with a dull creak.
Were they alright? He was sure Anna and the other prophets would not let the land fall to chaos, but had it fallen anyway? Was his mother worrying herself sick about him? Were Hester and Samandriel still doing well in their classes? What was going on back home, right at this moment?
At first, the light was quite content in its peaceful, solitary existence. But eventually, as time and space spread outwards in every direction, the light grew lonely and bored. With a great burst of energy that sent the first sounds and colors hurtling into existence, the light tore itself apart to form an equal opposite.
Dean chuckled obligingly. "Castiel, then. One almond milk latte coming up."
“Sometimes,” she admitted, “but it’s difficult to say for sure.”
For a moment he simply stood, arms crossed, and observed the glittering waters. Castiel smiled, appreciating the view with him.
In the context of romantic intimacy, someone wiping a stray crumb from his mouth was almost laughably tame and barely worth acknowledging. Still, despite Dean’s near-constant proximity as Hannah’s guard, he and Castiel shared relatively little physical contact. Castiel looked forward to the rare times they did briefly interact no matter how perfunctory the touch, so infatuated had he accidentally become with Dean. The way his cheeks warmed, then, came as no surprise.
notice anything was likely chalking it up to them worrying about the Darkness, or any of the other worries that were constantly present in a hunter’s mind.

.” Cas hadn’t yelled, but his voice had smothered Dean’s with an authoritative finality nonetheless. “My wings were injured when Lucifer himself was ripped away from my body. I need time for them to heal, and after that, I will
Dean did not believe Castiel thought so little of him?
The second awkward encounter with Cas’ wings had happened a few days after their return to the bunker. The three had spent the past forty-eight hours with their faces pressed into books, reading in near silence save for muttered apologies about accidentally kicking someone under the table or asking for another beer. Dean had recently returned from a few hours of sleep, but by now he had gone through so many books that he doubted he could remember which titles he had already checked. The words and pages and articles were all running together to become one long book in his head. Still, he had dutifully resumed his position at the table with a new stack of reading material.
Hushed voices in the main corridor pushed slowly through the lustful haze overwhelming his thoughts. Dean seemed to have noticed too, but when Castiel pushed him gently away, the mischievous glint so often in his eyes made a sudden reappearance. Dean held a finger to his lips, grinning wolfishly, before rolling his hips very deliberately against Castiel. A whimper escaped him against his will, forcing Dean to cover his mouth with one hand lest they be discovered.
Dean grinned as the black fabric was replaced over Castiel’s head and he was hauled to his feet and off the stage. He couldn’t wait to meet him.
Dean’s number went up again. A few steps away another number went up, its owner holding up two fingers to indicate two thousand. Dean glared at the back of the man’s head and held his bid card high, his other hand coming up to indicate five thousand.
Charlie turned the remaining line of customers over to him with a grateful smile. Dean found his usual rhythm preparing drinks and serving his lovingly crafted baked goods until a familiar, gravelly voice interrupted his autopilot.
Hannah stepped forward on Rowena’s other side, smiling and looking just a bit pink at the chorus of cheers that went up.
The notion seemed awfully farfetched; wishful thinking on his part. Nevertheless, Castiel felt those damnable, elusive butterflies take flight in his stomach.
“Dean,” he whispered, tauntingly close to Dean’s lips, “you’re going into rut.”
That made Dean pause. “When did you even come in
“It’s incredible, isn’t it sweetheart?” Dean said, just barely loud enough for Castiel to hear. Impala snuffled agreeably.
"Sure," he agreed again, resigned. The cafe was only open for lunch on Thursdays; they used the afternoon to prep for weekend catering jobs, if there were any.
After one last reassuring squeeze to both his and Hannah’s arms, Rowena swept into another graceful curtsey and made her way back towards the entrance to the temple. With one hand on the door she paused, turning to look at them over her shoulder.
“I could have killed you.”
Dean snorted. “
“Your Majesty.” The words were deferential but clipped, tight with the same purposeful seriousness.
If he hadn’t already been holding his breath, Castiel would have stopped breathing. His blood ran cold, and he felt tendrils of dread race down his spine, but he kept absolutely still, maintaining the facade that he was busy gathering information.
Once the nurse had gone, Dr. Novak took his place next to the examination table. The cat went to him immediately, nuzzling at the sleeve of his coat and chirping expectantly. Obligingly, Dr. Novak offered his hand, face softening from cool professionalism into something warmer as he scratched gently behind the cat's ear. The expression looked good on him.
“Should we—I mean, do you want us to stick around? Just in case?” Sam shifted his weight onto one foot and then the other, likely torn between giving Dean privacy and being available for backup if (when?) things went awry. Jack hovered awkwardly in the doorframe behind him.
“Precisely,” Castiel nodded, “but it seems prudent to confer with the High Priestess first; she is more knowledgeable than either of us in this regard.”
Anna hummed her appreciation; it was a good name, a
to feel degraded.” He tapped his chin thoughtfully, nodding to himself. “That must be it. As a warrior of Heaven, I’m superior to you in countless ways; strategically, it makes sense that you’d want to defile me until I’m brought down to your level.” He blinked emotionlessly down at Dean. “Maybe Uriel was right to think of you as ‘mud monkeys’.”
“Much better than the shifter,” he said, and a smile broke out across Dean’s face Castiel jerked his head back in the direction of his room. “Would you like to stay with me, Dean?”
—ran his hands down Dean’s spine and bent to bite teasingly at the supple swell of his backside.
“Don’t.” As expected, his tone was terse. “Just...don't.”
Dean snorted loudly. "What are you doing, man?"
With a sigh, Castiel gathered the various kitchen wares he and Dean had dirtied and brought them to the wash basin in the corner. After a quick pause to sweep stray flour from the countertop he filled the sink and began scrubbing as quickly as he dared. The head chef disapproved of his very presence in the kitchens; Castiel feared for the health of her heart should she catch him washing dishes. Still, he didn’t want some poor kitchen worker to be scolded if he left a mess.
No Exit is a great play; I went back and reread it during research for this fic and it was just as interesting the second time around. You don't need to read it for this story to make sense (assuming I've done my job, anyway), but I encourage you to pick it up if it sounds interesting. =]
Well, so what if he was a bit of a proud parent about his menu; it meant he could be trusted by his customers to deliver quality products.
“I know I said we’d wait until my rut,” Dean’s voice came from near the door, followed closely by a soft click. The overhead lights went out, leaving only the gray light from a cloudy afternoon streaming through the large windows on the left wall. “But I have one more training exercise for you.”
,” she emphasized, “Do you know what it’s composed of? Do you know its meaning or the reason it is trapped inside those little vials of yours?”
doing here?” Dean asked belatedly over his shoulder as he deposited his jars onto the counter. Had Castiel been paying attention, he might have noticed the other ingredients and tools necessary for making dough already out and waiting.
The next time Castiel woke up, the torch in the doorway had been put out and the sun shone through a window high above the bed, sending natural light bouncing off the colorful gems littering the walls. To his relief, many of his aches had vanished entirely and he was able to sit up at the edge of the bed, though there was still a twinge in his stomach if he moved too suddenly.
“That...sounds wonderful,” Castiel said at length, hoping the strain in his voice was undetectable. Hannah nodded, smiling agreeably, and Castiel studied her, unsure whether he hoped to find reassurance or apprehension or something else entirely. Her features were unusually fixed, offering no answers.
He lost himself for a moment, parting his thighs and thrusting gently forward into the liquid silk around him before pulling back, an apology already on his lips. Dean hummed around him and pulled away, but instead of reprimanding him (as would have been warranted), Dean resituated himself so that he lay flat on his back once more. Arching a challenging eyebrow, he encouraged Castiel forward with a hand on his hip until Castiel was watching himself slide back between soft lips. Another, more suggestive nudge to his hip had Castiel swallowing thickly, worried of misinterpreting Dean’s offer. Studying his features for signs of trepidation or injury, Castiel cupped Dean’s jaw and very carefully let his weight sink forward again, stroking his thumb over a flushed, freckled cheek.
In the car, he commented on Cas’ newfound humanity.
Dean Winchester lifted a champagne flute from the tray of a passing waiter and watched the other occupants chatter amongst themselves. Body language ranged from threatening remorselessness to gleeful lechery, but none seemed at all perturbed about the motivations for this particular gathering. They may as well have been attending an art auction or a political gala, for all their hesitation.
Castiel did not follow him. He had clearly read the situation wrong somewhere, and now that the spell was broken he felt foolish and mortified. With any luck, Dean would be willing to forget his inappropriate behavior with minimal awkwardness.
“Cas, what the hell, man?! I could have driven Baby into a ditch!”
"You can crunch numbers just as effectively in sweatpants," Sam had said.
“Well,” he hedged finally, still looking a little unsure, “that’s good news then, I suppose. You...are really not in love with each other?”
Castiel felt the heat rise to Dean’s cheeks and suddenly it dawned on him that the reason his memory counterpart seemed so disconnected from what Castiel knew himself to be was that all the faults that he saw reflected in his own face—once a warrior of Heaven, now little more than a joke amongst his kind; an arrogant monster who once had the laughable audacity to think himself God; haggard and weary under the weight of his mangled wings and the many turmoils that had befallen him since his arrival on Earth—were absent.
“Don’t make me regret trusting you, Cas.”
Contempt curled his lip against the rim of his glass. It was only to be expected of the sort of crowd that could afford to be at such an event, he supposed.
“Have you never been inclined to marry?”
Sam, but eventually, Dean had admitted defeat and started working on the cafe's accounting books at home.
Princess Hannah lay clothed in a white frock, though the folds of her skirt were hidden beneath a bedspread of rich, amethyst velvet. Gentle hands crossed delicately over her midsection and a thin silver chain sat around her neck, tapering to a point a few inches below the neckline of her gown. Through the canopy, the torchlight was softer but no less bright where it fell warmly against lovely, soft features. Dark chocolate tresses framed her face and fell around her shoulders, contrasting prettily with her healthy complexion. She was incredibly, undeniably beautiful.
perfectly human, if not a little awkward, so it made sense to Dean that he thought of Cas less as an angel and more as a sort of…juiced-up companion.
“I am Prince Castiel, son of King Charles and Queen Naomi and heir to the western throne,” Castiel spoke clearly, “Princess Hannah is my divinely chosen match; I intend to wake her and bring her back to my home.”
Castiel raked his hands roughly through soft hair, curling his fingers closed to tug as he laved his tongue against Dean’s lower lip. A strangled sound left Dean’s throat as he thrust his hips forward into Castiel, his head tipping backwards. Castiel wasted no time dragging his lips along the edge of that sharp jaw he so adored before moving even further down to mouth at the spot just above Dean’s Adam's apple. Dean did not let him wander for long; the hand still on his cheek guided him back up so Dean could connect their mouths again, and Castiel found himself stuck between progressing further and being completely unwilling to stop kissing. The fingers of Dean’s other hand gripped at Castiel’s hip underneath his tunic, promising that ridding themselves of clothes would be well worth the effort, but the thought of releasing Dean to do so made him ache.
Cas nodded and moved past Dean towards the hallway. “Thank you, Dean, Sam.”
There was a beat of silence once he had gone, and then Dean gave an annoyed sigh and stood to bring his plate to the sink. He set about scrubbing the dish and tried to ask Cas what the hell had been bothering him lately, but his voice felt stuck in his throat. Behind him, Castiel was silent.
There was no furrow to her brow, no signs of distress or discomfort; she looked utterly at peace. Castiel smiled softly, feeling a little more peaceful himself.
The swordsman’s breath hitched. Perhaps the severity of the situation had finally occurred to him, now that he knew who he held at knifepoint.
“So I figure,” the shifter continued, facing Castiel enough that he could see a sarcastically easy smile spreading over his face, “any bargaining chip is a good one, right? Desperate times and all that.” He faced Castiel fully again and spread his arms in a gesture that echoed his why-the-hell-not attitude. Castiel noticed that the skin on Sam’s face was starting to peel, and his eyes looked sunken and dull. The shifter would have to shed soon.
“I dunno, to keep us from worrying, I guess?” Sam shrugged, and pulled his book closer to himself.
loved, the way our favorite stories talk about—I feel sick with myself for not being capable of giving you that—” The words spilled from her as quickly and uncontrollably as the tears pouring down her face until she had dissolved into wracking sobs, unable to utter a single word more.
Wary, he took a few careful steps towards Michael, armed and ready, but Michael did not acknowledge him. Castiel stepped closer until he was directly next to him—still, Michael’s gleeful gaze remained fixed on Dean. Quick as lightning, Castiel drew his arm out and swung his blade in a graceful curve, landing the sharp tip square in the middle of Michael’s chest. The blade disappeared through him, but there was no give. There was nothing corporeal to fight.
“I came to make something for myself, too.”
Fingers curled and tugged gently at his rim, drawing a low hiss as he was stretched. Dean made a strangled sound and roughly tugged his fingers free. Castiel suppressed a whine at the loss, but a moment later he could hear the clink of Dean’s belt buckle and the rustling of fabric.
The question was perfectly innocent; Dean knew nothing of the tumultuous evening Castiel and Hannah had spent together, as far as he was aware. Even so, he felt caught off guard.
He savored the taste, almost mourning the eventual need to swallow. His eyes had closed of their own accord and he opened them to see Dean’s pleased expression.
“Dean, I’m not disgusted by what I saw.”
“No, I uh—“ he coughed awkwardly, “I walked in on Cas in the shower.”
Castiel’s puzzled expression must have been enough of a cue, because she paused only for a moment before explaining further.
A slight tilt of his hips tore a shout from Dean and from then on Castiel did his best to keep that angle. Another thrust, another, another, and then Castiel was knocking Dean’s hand away from where he had begun stroking himself so that he could wrap his own hand around Dean’s length instead. Dean watched him hungrily, leaned down to kiss him filthily, and on the next thrust spent himself over Castiel’s chest and stomach. Castiel stroked him through it, loving the way his hips twitched as he rode it out. Finally,
"He's fine," the nurse assured him, smiling warmly, "Dr. Novak thinks he has a mild upper respiratory infection—a kitty cold, more or less."
His eyes, ears, and nose had utterly failed him for the first time in Castiel’s memory.
Perhaps it was insulted by his apprehension.
Castiel stopped moving altogether, his lust momentarily forgotten.
He strode to the middle of the room where Castiel scrubbed frustrated hands through his hair as he faced his current nemesis: a basic lock.
“Dean…” he whispered, his breath clashing with the cold air in a wispy puff, “Thank you.” Cas came closer again and pressed soft kiss after soft kiss against Dean’s mouth.
But Dean didn’t look offended by his tone. “On the bed,” he said, nodding towards the large mattress. “On your stomach.”
Hannah smiled wearily at him before drawing him into a gentle hug.
I'm so lucky to have gotten a chance to work with the lovely Aggiedoll for this year's reverse bang! The art masterpost for this story is
“I’m sure there’s an interesting story to go with it,” Rowena reassured him, “so, off you go. Tell me the story.”
A loud clang to his right brought him out of his quiet observance and he had turned to find Sam bending low to grab his flashlight from where it had rolled under a conveyor belt.
Dean shifted his phone and unblinking, yellowish eyes flashed blue-green in the bright light, watching him warily.
Dean shrugged, a carefree smile on his face.
Once had been more than enough for him, especially given how late he'd started college. He hadn't planned on going at all, knowing all too well that their dad's inability to spend money on anything besides liquor meant there would never be enough for two college educations. He'd been perfectly willing to skip straight to earning cash if it meant Sam could have the chance to become the hotshot lawyer he wanted to be. But then one night, in the middle of Sam's senior year of high school and Dean's third year of scraping together paychecks from the local body shop, Sam had come home with a scholarship decision letter clenched in his fist and a huge smile on his face. It had taken some significant persuading to get Dean to put his savings towards his own education instead, but at long last, he'd agreed to apply. Four years later, with the help of several additional scholarships and his very generous uncle Bobby, Dean was steps away from a degree of his own.
Before he could dither further about whether or not to seek out Hannah, a choice was made for him in the form of his mother catching sight of him as he passed the entrance to the castle garden.
Dean snorted at Castiel’s frustration and gestured for Sam to reset the alarm. The more of Castiel’s voice he heard, the more certain he was that someone had bottled thunder and forced it inside his vocal cords just to see what would happen.
The official path gradually dissolved away past the forest entrance, leaving wanderers to keep track of their own trails. Ahead and to his right, Dean’s chainmail glinted in the dappled sunlight. With enough distance between them that his presence could be explained away as coincidence, Castiel followed.
“Dean,” he spoke clearly, watching for signs of acknowledgment. Though booming, his real voice sounded distorted and far away even to his own ears. He stepped directly between Dean and his clone, blocking Dean’s view of the unfeeling eyes, and tried again.
“Come,” he said, guiding Castiel with an amicable hand on his shoulder, “Surely the Princess is plenty well-rested by now.”
Cas!”
Castiel smiled reassuringly at his mother. Queen Naomi stood poised and elegant, every bit the picture of reticent, graceful leadership, but Castiel was not so easily fooled. Behind closed doors the night before, Naomi had fretted and fussed over him as any loving mother would.
to know he wasn’t just another convenient tool in Baby’s trunk, something to throw in the duffle bag if they needed him.
He needn’t have worried; a moment later they both dissolved into peals of laughter, all traces of cold formality eclipsed as Dean picked Hannah up and spun her in a circle, squeezing her tight once he had let her down.
sound.
SO: Good!
(See the end of the chapter for
Dean said nothing, and Castiel’s great wings trailed out of the room after him.
Around them, the dreary space fell apart and they were weightless, suspended amidst Dean’s thoughts and memories.
She took it gratefully, giving one last watery giggle as she dabbed carefully at her wet eyes. “I’ve no idea,” she said, “but Castiel, whether there has been a mistake or not I...don’t think we can marry.”
They stared at each other in the dying light of fire, reeling from the past few minutes. A slow, shaky smile parted Hannah’s lips and she giggled, hiccuping a little after so much crying. Once she started she seemed unable to stop, her giggles morphing into full, hearty peals of laughter. Her mirth was contagious and soon Castiel was laughing too, the ridiculousness of their situation fueling the hilarity. Before long their laughter was little more than wheezing as they clutched at their sides and at each other, trying in vain to catch their breath.
The words came out flat, disinterested. He’d slipped into autopilot without meaning to, so accustomed was he to gritting his teeth and letting his owner have their way without regard for him. When he was lucky, it was over quickly.
"I'll send you home with some antibiotics; he'll need a dose twice a day for the next week. The pills are small, so most cats won't notice if you hide them in a bit of wet food, but if he's particularly picky you can let the pills dissolve a little in some tuna water."
“You know, the brothers are idiots. I mean it’s like they willfully ignore what’s right in front of them, you know? The rest of us aren’t so stupid. We know about your little crush on…
"Hello sweet boy; I know, I know, I missed you too," Cas responded, navigating around Simba to remove his coat and shoes even as the cat brushed insistently against his legs.
him—bordered on obscene in its sheer eroticism. Castiel clutched at Dean’s wrists, scratched blunt nails down his waist, and finally settled for pressing fingers into his hips and upper thighs hard enough to bruise in an effort to be impossibly deeper.
He let green eyes look their fill, feeling strangely humbled by the open need in Dean’s expression. Dean himself had admitted to his predilection towards coquettish behavior, and while it was indeed flattering to receive such attention, the way Dean looked at him now was somehow
“Dean, I made a mistake. You are not the reason I was taken hostage.”
Hannah approached Dean slowly, placing a hand gently on his arm once she was in reach. Dean turned to face her, wearing an expression of forced stoicism. For a moment, they simply regarded one another, and then Dean bowed low.
He saw Hester training a young female student on how to conceal weapons on her person.
“I’m awake,” she said, disbelieving, “I’m awake!” Smiling beatifically, she reached up and clutched tightly to him, laughing and sobbing words of gratitude against his shoulder. Castiel held her close, offering confirmation that he was indeed real when she insisted that he do so.
Castiel swallowed thickly, aware that there was no reason for his continued presence. He should return to Continental and ride back to the castle, leaving Dean and all knowledge of his nakedness behind in the forest. The purpose of this excursion had initially been to sort out his feelings for Hannah, after all.
in places Castiel might not have guessed him to be. Referring to Dean in such terms felt rather silly—Castiel was sure he would balk at the descriptor—but try as he might, he could conjure no sufficient alternatives. Tough and assertive though he might otherwise be, in this setting, in this context, he looked soft and warm and inviting. Tempting.
,” he amended proudly, crossing his arms over his chest and smirking.
“I went with option B.” The shifter winked cheekily at him, coming close and stopping directly in front of Castiel while the angel determinedly avoided the green eyes trying to capture his attention. A hand reached out and took hold of his tie, and Castiel wished he could pull away.
Castiel lay with his ear pressed against the spot over Dean’s heart, its sure rhythm lulling him to join Dean in a long, well-deserved sleep.
Dean’s eyes were mischievous, eager. On his own head be it, then. Castiel nodded. Dean rewarded him by taking hold of his hips and thrusting upwards, setting a rhythm no less brutal than when their positions had been reversed.
“Don’t do that.” He didn’t look angry, but it was clear that he would not be argued with. Dean’s brow furrowed.
When directed, they turned to face each other and took each other’s hands. The crowd fell silent once more and heads bowed respectfully as Rowena began her prayers. Finally, with a great flourish, she concluded and bowed, indicating to Castiel and Hannah that they should open the vials that hung around each of their necks.
On the next brush of his hands, Dean’s fingers trailed feather-light over the edge of Castiel’s spine, leaving a tickling, itchy feeling behind. Castiel tried to will it away, but it was a lost cause; the feeling had taken root. When Dean’s fingers passed over the same spot, he flinched reflexively.
“Listen, I,” he paused to clear his throat, “I’m not good at, you know, chick flick moments, and talking about feelings and all that crap, but…well, Amara…” Dean glanced sideways at Cas, who was looking at him, patient but curious. Dean cleared his throat again and gathered his courage. “What Amara said to you was complete bullshit.”
, the look said. Loosely translated, anyway.
Simba's ears twitched, and Dean sat back in his chair as the cat raised his head to look towards the window. Two seconds later—like clockwork—Simba chattered happily and hopped out of Dean's lap, trotting out of the office with his tail high in the air.
“Where’s Sam?” Cas asked.
-weeks later-
When he looked around, Dean was smirking at him from over by the closet.
The cat sniffled, twitching its nose before giving a huge sneeze.
Whether Dean was aware of Castiel’s flaws and actively dismissing them or filtering them out subconsciously was unclear, but the implication was not lost on him: Dean did not see those things in Castiel. Dean recognized a better version of him, a version Castiel desperately wanted to be. He swallowed thickly (or perhaps it was Memory-Dean swallowing around a big bite of burger) as the memory faded away until he was once more adrift in the unpredictable tumult of Dean’s mind.
“Djinn got him,” Sam huffed. To Castiel he said, “Let’s get him to the infirmary.”
All looked to the mother eagerly, for this was her right and her right alone. Naomi smiled gently at the child.
Dean’s eyebrows rose in surprise; whatever he might have anticipated, it had clearly not been that. Castiel was certain he wore a very similar expression. Practically speaking, if Dean was prepared to join them, Castiel could see no reason that he should deny Hannah a companion from her former life. After all, legend dictated that upon waking she was meant to return to Castiel’s home, not her own. Still, he could not recall any instance of a matched pair returning with a third in tow.
“So,” Castiel said once his breathing returned to normal, “You like being choked.”
But the more repetitive motions associated with baking, much as he loved them, would take their toll eventually. Dean turned back towards the kitchen door, mentally running down the list of orders scheduled for the end of the week.
Dean gulped. He only had enough medical knowledge to survive a non-fatal wound, he didn’t know a damn thing about wings and was certainly not equipped to handle
Rowena walked back to where Castiel and Hannah stood and offered the book to them. Hannah took it with careful hands.
The kitchens were, thankfully, quiet. Castiel made his way over to the pantry, mentally running down the list of things he needed. Enough time had gone by since his last need for Misery Tea that he couldn’t be sure whether there were any dried chrysanthemum leaves left, but if not he’d make do with—
Still, Castiel had to admit that modern media’s attempts to visually represent the inner workings of the subconscious were creative and amusing, if inaccurate.
But maybe not. Gabriel was a pretty happy-go-lucky, go-with-the-flow sort of guy, but Dean knew he had a particular soft spot for animals (that soft spot was, after all, the cause of his current predicament), and he didn't think Gabriel would forgive him if he returned from sick leave to find out that Dean had let his pet stray die.
And so, together, Light and Darkness set about creating everything.
There were too many things he wanted to say, the more inane of which involved asking Dean to marry him on the spot, but he was too exhausted and his mind far too jumbled to make real sense of any of them. It could wait.
It was Dean’s grin at him in the mornings, given from his usual post near the door while Castiel and Hannah ate breakfast, that made his stomach swoop. It was the sight of Dean heading for the guard’s quarters, shirtless and out of breath after a good sparring match, that set a flush high on Castiel’s cheeks. It was the tinkling laughter of whichever maiden Dean has turned his flirtatious attention towards that sent a pang of jealousy through him, leaving him bitter and quiet for the rest of the day.
"What are you doing?" Dean asked again, crossing his arms and nodding at the armful Gabriel had only just managed to stop from tumbling to the ground.
“I don’t understand the appeal,” he stated flatly. Dean only frowned, confused. “Why do you desire my participation in an act so...debasing?”
The office phone rang, sounding particularly shrill in the quiet kitchen. Dean insisted to himself that he wasn't pouting at the interruption as he set aside his bowl of apple slices and removed his gloves.
“Verbal answers, Cas.”
The whole thing was ridiculous because, among other things, Castiel knew comparatively little about Dean. His physical attraction could easily be blamed on Dean’s naturally good looks—he’d once overheard the stable boy exclaim over a pint of ale that Dean had “unfairly symmetrical features”, and Castiel found the description both hilarious and quite apt. But the rest had managed to materialize from nearly nothing.
"Which vet did you go to, anyway?" he asked as he slid into the passenger seat, a recently purchased carrying crate on his lap.
He’d set out on his horse in search of the elusive butterflies that, if the stories were to be believed, marked attraction towards whoever had sent them aflutter in his stomach.
The door creaked softly closed and Castiel kneeled at the side of the bed, turning his attention to his charge.
Castiel swallowed thickly, becoming aware of his own parted mouth and the slightly ragged breath that left him, as he ached with desire once more. It was best that he leave before his luck ran out and Dean discovered him, swollen and wanting, in his hiding place. Slowly, quietly, Castiel rose from the forest floor. With one last look at the tempting vision before him, he turned and made his way back into the forest, leaving Dean and the oasis behind him.
At last, the light gathered above their hands, and Castiel gasped along with Hannah and the crowd as the ball of light shot into the air, returned properly to their creators.
He sat back down with a sigh. The nurse who greeted him had asked him to wait, had said the vet would take a quick look, and then they'd discuss next steps.
Castiel went, relishing the soft slide of the plush comforter across his bare skin.
“Hello, Dean.”
“You haven’t tempted me from Hannah—” Castiel started, but Dean scowled and held up a hand to cut him off.
In the wake of the epiphany he’d had while doing dishes and his subsequent mad dash to contact Rowena, Castiel had managed to let the morning’s awkwardness fall to the back of his mind. Now it returned to the forefront, lighting his cheeks on fire along the way.
And finally, Cas didn’t want to hurt anymore. During one particularly bad sleepless night that found him curled in on himself and clutching his thin blanket to his chest, he thought about death. But he didn’t want to die; he just wanted to stop hurting. Besides, though Dean never said it, Cas was needed to help around the camp and on raids, just like everyone else.
But there was another part—the part of him that wondered dubiously about the practicalities of loving someone based on nothing more than prophecy, the part that knew the well-being of his family and his kingdom and Princess Hannah’s kingdom depended on a successful union—that was anxious and fearful to set his fate in motion.
The nurse was back, sans cat. Dean stood, clearing his throat and hoping he didn't sound as ridiculously congested as he felt.
“I assure you, though my eyes wander through other books, only one library truly has my heart.”
Castiel and Hannah glanced sheepishly at one another. Rowena was quite right; Hannah was puffy under the eyes and her hair did not sit as smoothly as it usually did. Castiel’s shirtsleeves were still rolled up to his elbows and the front of his tunic was dotted with flour (oh, how the head chef would fuss) from his work in the kitchens.
“I don’t know that anything’s wrong; I think he’s just asleep.”
“Hey, Cas…”
“I’m sure she’d do a fine job,” He scuffed his boot along the stone floor, as though embarrassed. “But making it myself seems more sincere.”
Queen Naomi reached for the vase and Hannah relinquished it to her before turning back to Castiel and offering a conspiratorial wink.
Castiel came back to himself enough to realize that he was clutching at Dean unusually tightly; in the past few days, none of their trysts had developed beyond this point. He loosened his grip, laughing under his breath his subconscious attempt to prevent Dean from vanishing. Dean used his renewed freedom to pull his hips away and press forward again, the new angle doing wonders for both of them.
Gabriel nodded, smiling. The cat's tail swished happily as he scratched under its chin.
Fun Fact #???+1: Given all the smut I have read in my however many years in fandom, you'd think actually writing my own porn would be NBD. In reality, the very first draft of all the porn in this story was...kind of hilarious, in my opinion. Imagine, if you will, a friend sitting next to you and narrating a shitty video on pornhub. That, but like, worse.
“My next guess was that you had run away to start an illicit relationship with another, younger library.”
A bed with rumpled white sheets—a stark contrast to the dingy grays all around them—had replaced the couch. Dean was on his knees in the middle of it, head tipped back against his partner’s shoulder and provocatively on display. Just this sight alone was enough to send Castiel’s stomach swooping pleasantly, his eyes wandering of their own volition down over Dean’s torso and hips to where he was hard and leaking between his legs.
“I see,” Castiel said, glancing at the spice shelf where Dean had collected an assortment of jars. “Well, you are more than welcome to anything in our kitchen, of course.”
“This is such a stupid thing to be stuck on.”
Sam hung up the phone and turned his attention to Dean.
“I’m sorry for projecting my problems onto you, and I apologize for any inconvenience caused by my injuries; please know that I’m healing as fast as I am able. I’m one of your strongest weapons against Amara, and when you need me I want to be ready. And perhaps, if I am to lose my life to her in the process,” Castiel paused, turning and making to leave the room, “I can do so feeling like I was worth something.”
They rose at the same time, Dean drawing a silver dagger and Castiel sliding his angel blade out from inside his sleeve.
"Yeah, but charge him a rush fee."
anyway—and you’re down here! What are you doing?” Gabriel regarded Castiel, cheerfully popping a sucker into his mouth.
At first he’d tried to endure. A matter of time, it was just a matter of time before Dean came to him, spoke to him, smiled again, he’d told himself. But time wore on, and Dean didn’t speak except to convey information about the next supply run, or strategize about the best plan of attack. Dean didn’t smile.
Hannah tore her eyes reluctantly from her current book, blinking at him as she registered his question. She hummed thoughtfully.
A thought flickered somewhere in the back of Castiel’s mind. “Didn’t you hunt an alternative breed of Djinn? With Charlie?”
“By order of the western throne, I command you: name yourself!” Castiel tried again, his patience tested.
He closed his eyes and took a deep breath before sinking underneath the cool surface of the water. With his head fully submerged, sounds were muffled or silenced entirely, and though the sun shone brightly overhead Castiel would have sworn it was night underneath the lake. He opened his eyes with trepidation, sure it would feel uncomfortable, but he was surprised to find that he could see quite clearly, and what he saw was astounding.
To everyone’s delight, the day of the ceremony dawned clear and mild. Castiel and Hannah were afforded only a scant half hour of privacy to eat their breakfast before they were being whisked away to begin preparations for the upcoming festivities.
Castiel used the opportunity to spread his legs wide, bending one and sliding it up along the mattress. And then Dean was back and Castiel grabbed at the blankets as Dean curled strong hands around his upper arms, keeping him pressed down into the bed. Dean’s weight settled against his back, warm and heavy, and Castiel caught something spicy in the air as Dean bent to mouth at Castiel’s shoulder. He thrust his cock experimentally against Castiel’s slick hole and groaned softly. Castiel was on scent blockers too, of course, but he wondered if Dean could smell his arousal anyway.
True to form, Dean snarled and pulled out until just the crown of his dick was sheathed inside Castiel and then dropped back down, his balls smacking heavily against Castiel’s skin. Castiel felt the furrow in his brow ease at the rough slide of Dean’s cock, and Dean must have noticed his reaction because he leaned forward to speak into his ear.
“I’m sorry,” he offered anyway.
“It is,” Dean admitted quietly. Castiel had to commend him for how hard he was clearly fighting not to avert his eyes. “I let my own desires get the better of me and it led me to act inappropriately. I understand why you reacted the way you did and I don’t hold it against you.”
of the leather sounding audibly as it was tugged free. Chainmail clinked gently as it joined Dean’s boots, and finally he removed his tunic, baring his chest to the warm sun.
However his heart might balk, his duty was first and foremost to his kingdom as their prince, to Princess Hannah as her divinely chosen soulmate, and to his mother as her son. Castiel could—and
The see-through material did nothing to hide that Michael was correct in his assertion that Dean was experiencing sexual arousal, despite his obvious embarrassment.
Dean rolled his stiff neck and shoulders, humming at the satisfying pops and cracks that followed. He was long overdue for a vacation; with the cafe doing as well as it was, time seemed to slide by without him noticing.
Nearly a week ago, Castiel had paced back and forth in front of the ever-dimming fire, reviewing his happenings ever since the tower in an effort to pinpoint exactly when his desires had veered from their expected trajectory. Hours later, well after he should have been asleep, he had tugged at his hair in frustration as he knelt on the carpet, forced to face the disappointing conclusion: there
Distracted by the sudden gold hue of Dean’s usually light brown hair, Castiel failed to realize that Dean was undoing the ties of his breeches until far too late. In one swift motion Dean pushed the fabric down his legs and stepped out of them, unknowingly revealing himself to his hidden audience. Castiel tore his eyes away in a belated attempt to offer privacy, but only seconds later he sought Dean’s form again, sweeping his gaze indulgently over the swell of his backside before he could stop himself.
“Sam and me, we’re so bad at remembering to care about anyone who isn’t in our immediate vicinity, maybe because it’s so unusual for us to have constants in our lives. But you’re a constant now Cas, just like Jody, and Bobby, and Claire.” Dean paused for breath but didn’t feel brave enough to meet Castiel’s gaze. He gulped and went rambling on.
Castiel was unsure how to respond. Dean spoke matter-of-factly, as though he were mentioning his plans for the day; either he was extremely adept at hiding his lingering pain from the experience, or there was none.
“Alright, enough!” Sam stood and gathered his books and food as he continued. “You guys have been acting ridiculous for the last few days. What are you, thirteen-year-old girls?”
There had, however, been a few instances where the wings were ultimately inconvenient.
Dean was annoyed. He and Cas touched each other
Yet for the past three nights there had been no action on his part, only increasingly feeble excuses. A cantankerous nobleman had kept them well past the end of their meeting with his trivial gripes; his head ached. Hannah seemed so engrossed in her book; it would be selfish to pull her away from it. He was too tired; it could wait one more day.
“Okay, that’s it,” Sam declared, pinning Castiel with a firm—albeit tired and worried—look, “Cas, it’s time to get inside his head and see what’s going on.”
Nerves, he supposed. He lacked any significant real world experience to draw from outside of the few instances of rushed, experimental touches in his younger years. Most of what he knew of romance came from books.
“Not of you, of—” She gulped, looking near tears. Her hand came away from his chest and she clutched it to herself, eyes wild. “Of
“Do you know what this is?” she asked.
Curious murmurs rippled through the crowd and Crowley banged his gavel against the podium, demanding order. When the room was quiet once more, he gestured at the screen projected behind him. A number appeared in the top-left of the screen.
As though summoned by the very idea of catering, Gabriel leaned out through the office door to catch his attention.
An actual conversation with my (very patient and encouraging) significant other:
“That was Jody; sounds like we were right about the werewolf activity up in Wisconsin. Two of her friends were injured, so she asked us to check in with them after we’ve taken care of things.”
“I’m asleep,” Dean stated, more to himself than to Castiel.
“Of course I will,” he said, his small smile growing at Hannah’s sound of delight, “I’d be honored.” She hugged him again, wrapping her arms around his middle and squeezing tight. Castiel smiled with them, glad for Hannah’s happiness.
Dean gave an experimental tug of his hips and Castiel hissed as he slipped free. He turned onto his stomach as Dean stretched lazily, yawning. Castiel watched, baffled by Dean’s choice of training methods.
“What happened?”
Ten minutes later, Castiel had donned his armor and the pair were setting out.
"Mr. Winchester?"
“I’m not delicate,” he bit out, “If you mean to fuck me, then fuck me.”
name.
Lisa had such high hopes for him and would be heartbroken if he let this tank his performance, and he would never forgive himself if he brought
“And that’s what happened earlier?” If he were perfectly honest with himself, Castiel was unsure he wanted an answer to that. Both options seemed equally demoralizing, somehow.
I hope you've enjoyed my work! Comments sustain me (but I'm a little bad at replying. Sorry in advance.) and you should wander over to my beta's and artist's links and take a look at their work too. Cheers!
Just hearing the wrecked hoarseness in Dean’s voice—a result of his earlier generosity, Castiel was certain—sent him teetering dangerously close to the edge again. A sound halfway between a moan and a sob forced its way past his lips and Castiel clutched desperately at Dean’s hips, unable to nod fast enough. “Yes—Yes, Dean, anything.”
Castiel was not around; Dean assumed he was either out or resting. Sam had peeled his eyes away from his own book and given a loud yawn, declaring that he was going to take a quick shower to refresh himself. Almost as soon as his footsteps had faded they returned, and Dean looked up to see Sam looking awkward and thoroughly embarrassed.
Two months in, he stopped asking Gabriel daily whether he had made progress finding the cat a more permanent home. In hindsight, Dean had gotten used to Simba's company startlingly quickly; it became difficult to imagine watching TV without a ball of warm fluff keeping his toes warm, or brushing his teeth in the morning without Simba's usual stream of commentary.
The guy was intimidating at first glance; he stood straight with his shoulders back and down, his gait was purposeful, his gaze had a commanding edge to it, and in its neutral position, the corners of his mouth tilted ever so slightly downwards. Had Dean not known better, he might have guessed Dr. Novak worked as some kind of bodyguard.
There were few people on his usual path today. All the better for focusing on the issues at hand, though; his horse knew his desired route well enough to carry on with little instruction.
Pictures swam across his vision, though whether or not the images themselves marked the bottom of the lake was indiscernible. It was like looking through a window at seconds-long snippets of people's’ lives.
He glanced sideways at the Dean from the past. This Dean still cared for him, still valued him, maybe would have let Cas love him just as much physically as Cas did emotionally, given the chance. But in this world, Cas knew, that would not transpire. He would become the cold, closed Dean that Cas existed with and—damn him—loved anyway. It was just a matter of time.
Dean did not pull his hand back immediately. Castiel swallowed his mouthful and stood still, perplexed.
From his hiding place Castiel traced Dean’s form with his eyes, admiring the broadness of his shoulders and the slight taper at his waist. Sunlight fell against him in such a way that his muscle definition was dramaticized, although Castiel was certain someone of Dean’s proficiency with a blade did not need tricks of the light to lend him the appearance of intimidating strength. However much Dean might mock him for his inferior swordsmanship, Castiel was no stranger to the effort required to learn to weild a weapon in any meaningful way.
Dean laughed and rose from the bed to flick the desk lamp on. Castiel blinked against the sudden light.
Dean’s eyebrows rose in surprised delight as he took surer strides into the oasis; Castiel guessed the reaction was owed to the ever-perfect temperature of the water. Regardless of the season, the oasis was always just warm or cool enough to complement the weather.
The memory transpired through Dean’s point of view, of course, but Castiel immediately recognized the diner they were sitting in nonetheless. The memory-version of himself to Dean’s left was unexpectedly transfixing; there was something rather unsettling about seeing himself through someone else’s eyes. This Castiel was equal parts unrecognizable and identical to the version of himself he saw regularly in the mirror.
"Nah—“
First, there had been that time in the Impala; Dean and Sam had been on their way to Wyoming after some pleading from another hunter who sounded like he was way in over his head. Dean had insisted that Cas stay behind because “You need to get your mojo back, man,” and Castiel had reluctantly agreed to stay after Sam suggested that he do more research on anything that might help them put the Darkness away.
“It’s a fruit pastry,” Dean explained without looking up, pausing briefly to indicate a bowl already full of sliced fruit—apple, and perhaps pear too—sitting close by. “It may have a proper name, but Hannah and I never knew it. My mother let us experiment in the kitchen at home one day, and this is what we concocted.”
Hannah shook her head, the corner of her mouth quirking up. “I already had some. Please, help yourself.”
SO: Did you write the porn yet?
"You've got so many opinions," Cas responded encouragingly, giving him a few good strokes before standing up straight. He smiled fondly. "Hello, Dean."
Dean smirked at Castiel’s expression; when annoyed, he had a habit of glaring at inanimate objects as though his wrath alone could scare them into apologizing for purposefully wronging him. Last week it had been the espresso machine.
The sky had darkened and Dean felt the usual tension he carried with him fall away as Baby rumbled down the road, crooning familiar songs up at him through her speakers. Sam dozed in the passenger seat, and the world felt peaceful for a brief moment.
Gabriel hummed agreeably, drumming his fingers against the metal table until the cat wandered over to him to investigate, swatting at him playfully.
“I am Light,” the light explained to its other half, “and you are Darkness.”
like a sleeping princess to you?”
It wasn’t just a feeling anymore. Flashes of violence spun behind her closed eyes, visions of blood and torment and agony, and he seemed to be alone through it all. Such a bright young child, surely he was not meant to suffer in this way?
didn’t want to tell us anything about his dream world,” he added.
“Thank you brother, but I think the profound bond Dean and I shared has been eclipsed.” Castiel directed his attention to Dean’s form a final time, and then turned to leave.
"Ah, shit."
Castiel looked at Hannah for confirmation, and without any words she understood his request. A firm nod from her calmed his nerves and she kept her hand in his as they turned to face the crowd together.
of romantic feelings?” he parroted incredulously., “But what about the wedding? And the Unity Ceremony?”
Castiel frowned, worried. “He should have,” he confirmed, drawing his grace forth and pressing two fingers to Dean’s left temple. The blue wisps shifted out of the way of his fingers, but otherwise continued their leisurely path. Other than a slightly elevated heart rate, nothing troubling made itself known to Castiel; Dean seemed to be peacefully asleep. “I don’t sense anything wrong with him.”
, this isn’t how it works—”
Suddenly, the hand at his chest pushed him back with surprising strength. He blinked down at where it held him away, and when he looked up he was very startled to find Hannah looking distraught.
Hannah chuckled, turning her hands up into his and squeezing gratefully. It occured to Castiel, as he studied her, that perhaps part of the reason his attraction had mistakenly fallen to Dean was that, obvious differences aside, Dean and Hannah were alike in their remarkable aesthetic appeal.
came a snort that was far too reproachful to truly be Bobby.
“Hmm.” He felt rather than heard the appreciative rumble leave him. Grace pooled like cool water at his fingertips and he placed his hands against Dean’s crown, petting gently at the soft, sandy hair before he could stop himself. His eyes blinked closed, and he let himself sink into the yawning void of Dean’s subconscious.
line," Dean groused. The cat chirped cheerfully back at him.
Eternity dragged on, and neither time nor the soft murmurs of his brothers and sisters could console the Angel of Tears and Solitude.
(See the end of the chapter for
Nothing made itself known.
He found that drugs dulled the pain.
He felt Cas’ wing tug tighter around him, and a hand pressed against his shoulder, encouraging him to turn and meet Cas’ gaze. He did, slowly, feeling rather raw after opening up so much to someone besides Sam.
Water rippled and purled around Dean as he sank low into the oasis and drove himself forward in an easy glide. At the apex of the next stroke he vanished fully from Castiel’s sight, only to break the surface a few moments later, sodden hair stuck flat to his scalp. For a few minutes he swam back and forth lazily; Castiel allowed himself to be lulled into a meditative state as he tracked the ripples and whorls that appeared in his wake.
“I present to you, Prince Castiel of the western throne—” There were raucous cheers from down below, and Castiel was warmed to see so many of his kingdom present and in high spirits. “—and his soulmate, Princess Hannah of the eastern throne.”
“Relax,” he muttered against Castiel’s spine, but Castiel couldn’t tell if the order was meant for him or if Dean was chastising himself. The tremor was everywhere now; it was in the stutter of Dean’s hips, in his twitching fingers against Castiel’s arm and hip, in his uneven breathing against Castiel’s skin.
“What happened?”
Castiel nodded, watching another tear spill down over Dean’s freckles. “Help me get him to his room. I’ll have more space there.”
Castiel should be happy, he supposed.
Castiel realized his mistake too late as the water droplet he’d been tracing passed Dean’s navel and rejoined the cool blue below. Water fell away from smooth skin as Dean continued towards shore, revealing slim hips and then the vee of his groin, and in between one blink and the next Dean was bared to him properly, his nakedness glorious against the shimmering, fantastic backdrop that was the oasis. Warmth pooled low in Castiel’s gut the longer he stared, the front of his breeches gradually pulling taut over the evidence of his arousal.
His orgasm burned through him and he sank his teeth into Cas’ neck, growling and groaning as blood filled his mouth, hips twitching and grinding into Cas as his cock throbbed and pulsed and coated his insides with sticky warmth.
The cat looked at Dean directly for the first time since they had entered. Dean looked back warily from his place against the wall; the cat was perched on the very edge of the table, as though it were going to leap across the room at him.
Dean smiled wide at him from across the table, a mischievous glint in his eye. “We’ll start tomorrow,” he said, winking at him as he sunk another ball.
Jack’s eyebrows rose. “Could that be why Dean won’t wake up? Because he’s afraid?”
For a brief moment he hung weightless and still, suspended in hushed darkness, and then in a sudden, wild flurry of movement and colors and sounds the space around him exploded into activity. Encouraged forward by a tug just behind his navel (or rather, where his vessel’s navel
A pretty blush reddened the apples of her cheeks. “Thank you, Castiel.”
Fun Fact #???: Barring a single <1k word thing from long ago, I think this story features the first ~actual porn~ I have ever written.
“I’m happy too,” Castiel said honestly, offering her his hand. She took it, shifting to put her bare feet on the ground and standing slowly, carefully, testing her weight. “I’ve been told the stories—our story—since boyhood,” he told her, “though I’m afraid they’re rather lacking in their retellings of your perspective. You’re very brave, Princess.”
The atmosphere between Dean and Castiel remained somewhat tense, but the anger that had previously filled the air between them was no more, replaced instead by pensive, self-loathing silences and guilty staring at turned backs. Sam, at least, seemed more or less convinced that everything was alright again, or if he
The longer he looked, the more intrigued he became. Though it was difficult to spot through a camera lens, a dark, mischievous glimmer flickered across his eyes and made Dean wonder about what lurked beneath Castiel’s surface. It reminded him of a loose thread, he realized; most wouldn’t notice it, but now that it’d caught his attention he wanted to give it a tug just to see where it lead.
no such point.
When he was done with the red apple he dragged the bowl closer, adding generous amounts of cinnamon, nutmeg, and brown sugar before reaching in and turning the contents over themselves until the spices were evenly distributed.
"Cassie!" Gabriel called from behind him, barreling forward to gather the man in a bear hug. Dean's eyebrows rose in shock, but instead of startled the man looked equal parts exasperated and resigned to his fate.
Castiel stayed stock still as Dean resumed his petting, eyes wide and heart racing. At each brush of Dean’s palms over him he held his breath, waiting to see if Dean would swipe the ticklish spot again and only exhaling once he had successfully passed it.
The hallucination solidified around him quite suddenly and it took two awkward, lurching steps to regain his balance. It was immediately clear that whatever this Djinn had been up to, it didn’t involve keeping its victims happy. There was almost no furniture and the colors here were muted and gloomy. In lieu of a room with four discernable walls, the hallucination simply frayed and blurred at the edges before disintegrating into the shapeless void beyond.
. Finding himself capable of reducing Dean to this flushed, wanting version of himself made Castiel feel powerful in a way he very much liked.
“Your obligations as my caretaker are more than fulfilled,” Hannah amended quickly, “I ask this of you not as your Princess, but as a dear friend. It would bring me great comfort to see a familiar face in a foreign land.”
Castiel couldn’t help but roll his eyes. Really, it was such an uncharacteristic and ridiculous thing for ‘him’ to say. A poorly-done caricature of himself. Cartoonish.
“He’s on scent blockers,” the employee who had brought Castiel out explained.
Dean considered him for a moment, his hand paused in its return to the fruit bowl, then grinned. “If His Majesty desires a floury doublet, who am I to stop him? Here, help me place the fruit.” He shifted to one side, indicating the dough on the counter.
“Let—go—”
face.
Nevermind that Castiel had been attracted to Dean since well before their confessions to one another.
“No need,” he replied gruffly, “I’m flexible.”
And yet, as Dean toed curiously at the edge of the radiant blue water before wading a few steps in, Castiel lowered himself slowly to the forest floor, arranging himself to sit comfortably as he watched.
Quick as lightning and without any warning, a firm slap fell against his ass, sharp and stinging. If not for the ticklish spot he might have fallen asleep this way, but now he was wide awake, too surprised to make any noise.
"Thank you, Garth," Dr. Novak said, "Can you print the care instructions please?"
Dean was sighing appreciatively with every rock back against his own fingers now. Castiel watched rapt as a pearly bead of liquid spilled from the tip of Dean’s erection and trailed slowly downward; he reached to catch the drop against his finger and smoothed it back up over the head, swallowing hard when Dean twitched his hips forward with what could only be described as a whimper, another drop spilling from him to join the first.
There was no sense in the idea that he could be tempted away from Hannah unless he was in love with—
of his knife slicing through fresh fruit. Gabriel would be here soon, bringing with him the to-do list for the day, but until then Dean would work in the steady calm and let his thoughts wander wherever they pleased.
Castiel started at the sudden, derisive gibe, dragging his eyes regretfully away to see Michael standing next to him, watching with a sneer. For a moment Castiel glared, thinking Michael was finally addressing him, but then Michael moved to stand at the edge of the bed, speaking lowly to Castiel’s clone instead. Dean seemed unable to hear him.
"Oh," Dean said, relieved he wouldn't have to face Gabriel's rage over the loss of his not-quite-pet, "that's good. So, uh, where is it? Um, he?"
I haven’t—I tried to—I hoped it would happen on its own, that with time—but—”
"Have you considered sitting on the table and meowing? It works for Simba."
And for the next half an hour, they did so. Rowena listened patiently while Hannah and Castiel recounted the details of their conversation the previous night. If she was angry or disappointed in either of them, she did not show it. Her expression remained calm through their explanations, although it twisted briefly in sympathy when Hannah tearfully admitted to the increasing guilt she had felt as the wedding drew nearer.
Dean frowned. “Why would he do that?”
He cleared his throat, retrieving his hand to scratch awkwardly at his own nose, belatedly realizing that he was delivering allergens directly to his sinuses.
Castiel flushed brightly, but nodded, willing himself to hold Dean’s piercing gaze.
There were whoops and cheers from the crowd below and Castiel pulled Hannah forward into his arms, ecstatic. Hannah squeezed him tight, a few tears of joy landing on his shoulder.
With a grunt and some careful balancing, Dean managed to get the back door open without setting down the bin of flattened delivery boxes and other assorted recyclables he was lugging along with him.
“I admit, this was partly a selfish endeavor,” Dean said, grinning as he pulled two small plates from a nearby shelf. He plucked the topmost pastry off the pile and offered it to Castiel before adding one to his own plate. “Try it.”
The wing around him twitched but did not leave him. It felt like Castiel was preparing for some kind of rejection. But Cas deserved to hear that he was important, even if Dean didn’t have a beautifully prepared speech ready. He would just have to run his mouth, and hope for the best.
Castiel preened under the praise, reaching back for any part of Dean he could find. His fingers brushed a wrist and he closed around it tight, urging Dean on. He let himself get lost as Dean’s thrusts blurred together in his mind, drunk on the pleasure and the forgotten feeling of getting fucked the way he wanted to.
Fun Fact #3: I'm really excellent at carefully peppering my first drafts with continuity errors. In the first draft of this chapter, Bartholomew kept slamming down a Bible that he never picked up.
Dean flinched.
Castiel was quickly coming to admire the genuine way Hannah communicated; where others—himself included—were wont to stumble over or dance around their vulnerabilities, their gazes pulled downwards by guilt or shame, Hannah spoke openly and honestly, head held high.
"No worries, man," Dean reassured him, looking around for the clipboard of orders that needed filling. He grimaced at the sheet—Gabriel's absence would certainly be felt today. Maybe he'd see if Kevin could come by for a few hours. "There anything important I need to know, besides the orders I've got here?"
Dean marked his place and closed his notebook, smiling as the usual song began. One regularly pitched meow, followed by increasingly louder and lower-pitched ones until Simba was making more of an
Castiel could only jerk his head in what he hoped was a nod at the gasped words. Dean thrust hard once, twice, before his knot began to catch at Castiel’s rim.
Any interpretations of the play are based on my understandings of it, and I admit critical analysis is not really my forte. Apologies in advance to anyone who is better acquainted with it if I've gotten something horribly off-base.
Confusion pulled his features into a slight frown when warmth spread across his shoulders and down his back as if someone had draped a heated blanket over him. He turned to ask Castiel what had caused it, but Cas was looking resolutely in the opposite direction. It was hard to tell in the dark, but it looked like the part of Castiel’s face that was still visible was dusted with pink. His right wing (or the shadow of it) twitched gently, and his left wing…
Halfway to the vet, his immune system had kicked online, protesting the trembling stray's presence in the limited space of his car. His hands itched where they had touched fur and his sinuses were so stuffed up it felt like he was on day three of a bad cold. His nose was running like a faucet despite the many tissues he'd already gone through, and his eyes felt just a little too watery.
“How do you want me?”
He wondered vaguely if the atmosphere of this place was purposefully crafted or entirely coincidental.
to wear down.”
Though she hadn’t been a teacher in trade, Castiel took her lessons as seriously as those of his other tutors. Missouri had been a wonderful mentor, whether that had been her intention or not. At her funeral, he’d sworn to her that he would try his best to be honest—even if only to himself—about his feelings.
Dean was different; a pliant, submissive mate didn’t suit him.
"If it's alright with you, the vet would like to keep him here for a few nights. We'd like to do a more thorough examination after he's gotten some fluids; make sure he doesn't have any other health problems, give him some basic vaccinations, that sort of thing."
Three near-misses later, Castiel cursed the palace trainers under his breath for his clearly inadequate education. In his frustration his form grew sloppy, his thrusts ill-aimed. The other swordsman perspired but otherwise displayed no signs of fatigue; the likeliness of a favorable outcome for Castiel dwindled rapidly.
Twin low chuckles reached him distantly, one fond and the second dark and suggestive—Benny and Dean respectively—but Castiel was far too wired to keep up the pretense of propriety.
Castiel felt his heart in his throat.
you, I—” He swallowed, unable to meet the imposter’s cold gaze. Castiel leaned closer to hear the mumbled words.
The darkness returned thick and menacing, spreading over the prophecy of Castiel’s life like ink spilled over fresh parchment.
Dean’s eyes flicked briefly up to meet Castiel’s before lowering once again, though not all the way to the floor. He shifted his weight from one foot to the other, and Castiel waited patiently for him to speak.
"Mr. Winchester?" called a deep voice a few minutes later, and Dean looked up to find a man about his height, with bright blue eyes and kind—if maybe slightly stiff—features.
“The princess is my charge.” The swordsman peered down at the vial around his neck, encircling the glass with careful, protective fingers. “Just as she is bound to sleep until her soul match comes to wake her, so too am I bound to stand guard at her side. By the will of the creators, a Winchester has always looked after the eastern throne.”
“Castiel? What—”
But then there was more movement and the real Dean appeared before Castiel, reaching up to pick apart the chains while Sam confirmed that his shot had truly killed the shifter. Able to lower his arms at long last, Castiel was so engrossed in the wonderful feeling of no longer being stretched that he didn’t immediately hear the scolding Dean was giving him as he picked the lock on the cuffs.
“Can’t believe he thinks about this,” Michael said through a mocking smirk, “Imagine; You, a holy warrior, a being too unfathomably great for a simple, ephemeral speck of existence like him to comprehend…” He laughed outright. “...and he wants to defile you by having you
A cycle was born. Unable to resist meddling altogether, Darkness returned every few decades to gift another soul to a grieving King and Queen. If Darkness spent the next several years in solitude, diligently crafting a new soul match, Light need not be any the wiser.
When Castiel saw Dean pass the small wooden sign proclaiming that the oasis was just ahead to the northeast, he smiled knowingly and brought Continental to a stop in a small field of clovers. Eager to see Dean’s uninterrupted reaction to the incredible scenery, he left his horse to graze happily and closed the rest of the distance on foot, arriving just in to see Dean’s slack-jawed expression at the sight before him.
“This what you want?” he asked, punctuating the question with two more hard thrusts and a nip to Castiel’s earlobe. Castiel groaned breathily and arched his back, pushing his hips as high as they’d go in his current position. “Should’ve guessed by your build that you could handle more than most,” Dean was saying, “That’s part of why I brought you home, after all. Knew you weren’t some delicate flower, knew you could handle me.”
“Go,” Benny said, presumably to Dean, “I’ll guard Hannah tonight. Find yourself a bed, or at the very least a less public space than this.”
Or was he willfully projecting his own desire for this particular freedom onto any solution that might allow it?
“Besides,” he added, pausing to meet Gabriel’s eyes, “I pulled him from Hell. I fought with him, fought
The same nurse from Dean's previous visit greeted them when they arrived, gesturing for them to have a seat while he retrieved the vet.
Dean snorted, unable to maintain his fake pout, and leaned forward for a soft kiss. "Welcome home, Cas."
She could feel little Castiel’s pain and her head ached. She clutched the baby tightly to her, causing him to stir and cry out unhappily at her grip. It seemed to go on for ages, nothing but blackness around Castiel and his once average life. Perhaps he was to die young? But the emptiness, the complete lack of existence that accompanied prophecies of death was not present. She could not see Castiel’s end beyond the misery that had overtaken everything.
(See the end of the chapter for
Despite being opulently dressed, most guests carried with them a layer of something dark and miserable, grimy ghosts wrapped around their shoulders and cascading over suits and gowns; an unintended accessory. Perhaps it was a side-effect of the poor lighting. Perhaps not.
Dean opened his mouth angrily, clearly expecting to need to argue further, but closed it abruptly a moment later.
Castiel took a deep breath and rapped his knuckles against the door to Hannah’s bedchamber. His pulse hammered loudly in the silence of the corridor for a moment before her gentle voice broke through the cacophony to usher him inside.
The weathered stone was cool to the touch and Castiel laughed under his breath at his own silliness; after years of tracing the paintings, he had mistakenly expected the stone to feel like paper. He let his fingers tangle gently in the verdant ivy that sprawled upwards along the wall as he made his way around the curve of the edifice. A third of the way around he came upon a wooden door; distantly he wondered if he’d need his smaller tools to unlock it, but when he gave an experimental tug the heavy door creaked open without much resistance.
Dean gave him a wry look. “Do you suppose faeries kept Hannah from starving to death in her sleep?”
His horse snuffled at him when he dismounted and Castiel hushed him with a comforting pat before making his way towards the lone building. The forest encircling the clearing was still and quiet in the dappled, late afternoon sunlight, as though even the trees themselves knew the sacred nature of this place.
“Yes. Well,” Castiel clarified, “One victim had been found dead by the time we arrived. We did speak to the second victim though—”
The bed dipped next to him and Castiel pressed his other cheek into the bedding so that he could see Dean. His body language read calm and collected, but his eyes gave him away; there was hunger there.
throat. He didn’t know how hard to squeeze, didn’t know where to put his hands so he didn’t cause lasting damage. The dark feeling in the pit of his stomach swirled and made him wonder if he’d be able to let go at all.
“And let us know if there’s something we could do to help,” Sam added.
Castiel swallowed, apprehensive. Had someone else sought to wake the Princess? Their efforts would have been futile, of course; she would wake for no one but Castiel. Still, his blood turned to ice at the thought of Princess Hannah, unaware and unprotected, prone to a faceless monster intent on committing unspeakable crimes. His hand went to the hilt of his sword and he listened carefully.
“Cas…”
Perhaps either outcome was fine with him.
Dean smirked triumphantly. “If you paid more attention, you would have been able to deflect me.” He released Castiel and dropped his gaze to the floor, suddenly looking rather meek. “I had to wait until Hannah retired,” he explained, voice quieter, “I don’t desire an audience.”
An hour before close, Dean went dutifully into the alleyway bearing a saucer of cream, another of tuna (he'd had to run to the nearby grocery store on his lunch break to pick some up; Gabriel had better be appreciative) and a small bowl with fresh water. To his relief the cat was nowhere in sight, so he set everything down by the edge of the dumpster and ducked back inside before it could make an appearance. When he stooped to retrieve the dishes later on, he found the cream gone, but the tuna only half-eaten. Perplexed, he tossed the remainder in the trash on his way inside. Surely cats didn't have a brand preference when it came to tuna, right? Maybe Gabriel gave smaller portions.
Amara had remained.
“Prince, Princess,” Rowena asked softly, smiling, “Have you anything to say to your subjects?”
good for you. It’ll ultimately help with your work to change it up a little bit, I promise.”
Finally, Dean raised his hands in a gesture of surrender and went back out into the hallway. And if he closed Cas’ door a little harder than was strictly necessary, who had to know.
“Yeah, well, I used to belong to a much better club.”
He called it an appreciation of his own craft.
“I know,” Dean said, rifling through his drawers for clothes, “but you didn’t. That tells me I can trust you not to wander off on your own tangents while we’re out and about.” He paused on his way out the door, and his next words were a quiet threat.
with her, Cas? If you met her you wouldn’t even be alive!”
“Dammit Cas, just tell me what—“
“Try it one more time,” he said, giving Castiel a pat on the shoulder. “After we’re done here, wash up and come to my room.” Blue eyes searched his face. “Your clothes won’t be necessary.”
, Dean," he griped, "Do you have any idea how much it would cost you if I had a heart attack on the job?"
The horse, he recognized; Impala was a sleek, black mare with a reputation for being quite picky about her riders. It was not uncommon to see Sir Bartholomew leaving her paddock, swearing and stomping, after yet another unsuccessful attempt to persuade Impala to cooperate with him. Castiel was therefore surprised and rather impressed to find Dean sitting astride her, both of them looking perfectly at ease with the arrangement. Dean stole a quick glance around himself—though why he thought that necessary, Castiel couldn’t guess—before leading Impala past the treeline and into the forest.
He shouldn’t watch. Djinn magic didn’t simply create scenarios out of thin air; it relied on knowledge of its victims to stimulate the desired emotions. This Djinn had known this to be a shameful secret of Dean’s, something that he wanted but that caused him intense embarrassment to acknowledge. He shouldn’t watch.
The corners of Dean’s mouth twitched upwards ever so slightly into a heartless smirk.
It was a very good thing that breathing was not a necessity for Castiel, because he only realized he had not taken a breath for several minutes when Dean moaned low and wanton, pushing his hips back against fake-Castiel’s ministrations.
“I’m only teasing,” Dean offered with a small, apologetic laugh, “Most people don’t think to wonder. I suspect the fairytale of the beautiful maiden asleep in the woods would lose most of its charm if the more grotesque aspects of keeping someone alive for so long were detailed.”
“I must admit, it sounds like a bedtime story to me.”
Much to his surprise, his fingertips made contact with cool fur without any fanfare. He prodded a little more firmly, testing his boundaries, but the cat stayed where it was, huddled and shivering.
By the end of the second week, Castiel was entirely fed up with Dean’s childish antics. Sam had wisely refrained from commenting (or else he’d been explicitly told not to) on Dean’s strange behavior, but when a coffee mug shattered on the kitchen floor following Castiel’s arrival in the kitchen, even he couldn’t keep the exasperated irritation off his face.
And when the Dean from eons and eons ago (so it seemed, anyway) entered his hut and asked him to strap on his angel wings, he heaved a delirious chuckle. Dean,
about this man, did you even ask it to do the silver test?! Jesus! This place is huge what if we hadn’t found you until it was too late?”
He wanted to fling himself into Dean’s space, encase him in his arms and sob against his shoulder, and let Dean do the same. Instead, Cas returned to his own hut, and yelled himself hoarse until he fell asleep.
“Is that so?” There was that charm again, albeit a little thready through whatever nerves Dean had stirred up in himself. Perhaps he would ask about it later.
The trip from the infirmary was short. Once Dean was lying flat in the middle of the bed, Sam turned to follow Jack back into the hallway, but paused, fidgeting indecisively.
“I apologize,” she said between watery giggles a while later, “There was no way to know how long it would be before you woke me.” She pulled away from him, swiping her fingers underneath her eyes to brush away her tears of relief. “It was far more frightening than I had guessed—falling asleep wondering if I would wake the next morning—” A fresh tear spilled down her cheek. “Oh, I’m so happy you’re here. I’m so happy to be awake.”
Like her guard, Hannah was easy to get lost in. Her clear blue eyes, prismatic and captivating in a way that reminded him of the oasis, were especially vivid in contrast to the long dark brown hair that framed her face and tumbled in soft waves past her shoulders. Her red lips and full cheeks served her expressive nature well and were perfect for warm, sincere smiles that put people at ease until they were smiling too.
The voices were clearer now; if either speaker thought to look down Castiel and Dean’s corridor, the night would end rather differently than planned. Another twitch of Dean’s sinful hips, another gasp against the hand over his mouth. Dean breathed heavily against his neck, pressing rough kisses against Castiel’s skin with each roll of his hips to keep himself quiet.
“You lived there?”
“Cas, are—are those your
Dean sighed, defeated. It was clearly too late to hope the stray would give up and looked for food elsewhere.
“Maybe I could at least—“ Dean had reached up to brush along the wing joint, pushing a few errant feathers to the floor, but Castiel abruptly pulled his wing back and folded it down against himself.
The kitchen door creaked open, hailing the arrival of Gabriel. His eyes were cast downwards, monitoring the pile of things precariously balanced in his left hand as he pushed the heavy door open with his right.
Dean ended the tour in Castiel’s room, just down the hallway from his own. By the slight raise of his eyebrows, he guessed that Castiel had not counted on having a space of his own; Dean hoped it would help him acclimate quickly.
“My pleasure,” came Charlie’s voice in his ear, “The cameras are all on a loop and the alarms are off. You’ve got two guards making their rounds, so work fast; you’ll have about five minutes, maybe seven.”
Castiel took great pleasure in his new friendships with Hannah and Dean. He had made many friends growing up whom he valued dearly, but never before had he felt so free to indulge in his own interests, no matter how inane. Being royalty herself, Hannah did not treat him with the hesitation other people sometimes did, which made Castiel feel less prince and more person.
Dean watched as his wings drooped behind him, fell against his back and shoulders.
Hannah flushed prettily at the compliment, something in her expression relaxing minutely. Beside them, Queen Naomi made an approving sound.
“I am too,” he said, leaving it at that for the time being.
On the third pass, he felt it again. He pulled in slow, deep breaths, trying to relax his way through the nagging discomfort. It was no use; one more swipe and he was flinching again.
The other man blinked slowly at him. Then, much to Castiel’s surprise, he threw his head back with a shout of laughter.
“I think she must not have gotten a full dose,” Sam interrupted. “She told us she was attacked behind the bar, but managed to fight her way out. The third victim…” His fingers tapped arrhythmically against his leg.
With a sickening jolt, the void seemed to tip violently across some imaginary axis, sending everything sideways. Before Castiel could do so much as try to reorient himself, he was being flung back into his own body, kneeling at Dean’s bedside.
Kevin smiled, tired but grateful, offering thanks and a wave before disappearing back through the kitchen.
not trust your chef?” His tone was teasing.
Castiel nearly jumped out of his own skin at the unexpected sight of Dean rummaging through the spice shelves. Dean must have been equally caught off guard because he swore loudly and fumbled the jar of cinnamon he’d had nestled in the crook of his arm.
A private moment.
Hannah was no longer a stranger; the idea that he simply didn’t know her well enough yet was absurd. Neither could the case be made that he was too absorbed with other business to let himself become enamoured. Not a day had gone by since their return that he did not seek her company at least once. Even—or especially—when his day was filled with long, tedious meetings arguing over this or that policy, Hannah was there to suggest an evening stroll after dinner or a night tucked away in the library.
“Look, you’re—“ Another pause, until finally, “Goddammit Cas, you’re important to me, to all of us, Sam, Claire…”
The third time Castiel’s wings came into full view was not so much awkward as it was intense.
"Look, just...just wash the saucers when you're done, ok? On high heat. Twice."
“In that case, let’s see if I can’t tempt you a bit more.”
The sound of his own heartbeat grew thunderous as the silence stretched around them. Then, abruptly, the sword was withdrawn.
“—and I mean we
When at long last they arrived at Castiel’s quarters, they separated just long enough to divest themselves of their clothing without an ounce of finesse before tumbling gracelessly onto the large bed, incapable or unwilling to allow too much distance between them.
enticing.
To their left, Sam and Charlie had Alistair and the remaining angel blade wrapped and ready to leave. Sam signaled their departure and tugged Alistair behind him, purposefully swerving so that he scraped and bumped over piles of rubble.
"That's
Sam and Gabriel could at least
Dean gripped the steering wheel tighter. Sam was right of course, they couldn’t afford to slack on finding Amara.
“His name will be Castiel.”
“Good.” Dean vanished from his line of sight and re-settled himself across the backs of Castiel’s legs. Castiel waited, straining his ears for any sign of what Dean planned to do, but Dean made no noise, not even when he leaned forward to place a warm hand against Castiel’s left shoulder blade. If not for the point of contact and the shifting of the mattress with his weight, Castiel wouldn’t have known he moved.
“Let me try,” Jack said, hovering a hand over Dean’s forehead and gathering a golden light at his fingertips.
He felt Hannah tremble against him. Determination renewed, he parted his lips ever so slightly to slide the tip of his tongue against her sealed mouth. Hannah placed one of her hands against the middle of his chest and he took it as encouragement, sliding his own hand down from her shoulder towards the swell of her breast.
the corks came free, and Hannah and Castiel joined hands again as grace from each vial sought its companion. Wisps of grace trailed from the open vials like liquid smoke, gathering around their joined hands and shimmering in the setting sun.
"Joke's on you," Gabriel had chimed in, raising an eyebrow and fixing Dean with an accusing look, "Staying for hours after close to do the books isn't any more balanced."
knows it. You’ve been looking at me the way Uriel used to, like I’m something on the bottom of your shoe. Just
Dean wasn't immediately sure what caught his eye. The bright light overhead cast harsh beams down around him, throwing the alleyway into sharp contrast so that beyond the edges of the building the world seemed pitch black. The dumpster lid squeaked and creaked as he lowered it back into place, peering around him for whatever had darted momentarily into his peripheral vision.
Dean shone his flashlight into the space between the dumpsters, wondering if the cat had wandered off for good, and was surprised to find it huddled right there, maybe a foot away from the food. He stepped closer cautiously, but the cat just blinked up at him sleepily.
Despite the unforeseen benefits of pet ownership, however, Dean felt like he was going to lose his marbles if there wasn't a proper improvement in his allergies very, very soon. Being doped up on antihistamines most of the time was not the most productive state to be in, and he was extremely ready to have the fog lifted from the edges of his mind.
Dean was restraining himself.
“Hmm,” Dean hummed, running his thumb thoughtfully across his lower lip, “It’s a big change, I suppose.”
All he wanted to do was go home and take some strong antihistamines. If not for the need to drive home, he'd have already taken the ones in his pocket, but they tended to knock him on his ass fairly quickly. His eye twitched and he fought the urge to rub it, knowing that would only make things worse. He tipped his head back against the cool window behind him and tried to focus on something else.
Jack frowned down at Dean from his place beside the bed. There was silence.
“So, where is it?”
“I—” he tried, but it felt like he was talking through a mouthful of honey. Castiel cleared his throat and swallowed thickly before trying again. “I apologize for making you uncomfortable; I did not mean to misread things so severely.”
Sam scrubbed a hand down his face—a nervous gesture that ran in the Winchester family, from what Castiel could tell.
Dean chuckled darkly behind him and applied pressure until the tips of his two fingers slipped inside. Castiel’s hips twitched reflexively.
Dean nodded without looking away from Castiel. That suited him fine; both he and Sam were on scent blockers most of the time and he’d planned on requiring that Castiel stay on them too. It helped with anonymity.
This answer didn’t appease Dean in the slightest; in fact, he felt anger rise in him again. Here he was, manning up and trying to actually talk things out, and Castiel was deflecting as if he hadn’t been giving Dean the silent treatment all week.
him. I don’t want better.” And with a gust of wind Castiel was gone.
“Going once,” Crowley warned, but no one was willing to bid higher on a disobedient omega, no matter how gorgeous he was. “Going twice…” Crowley cast one more look around the room before bringing his gavel down firmly on the podium. “Sold, for five thousand dollars.”
It was easy to forget that Castiel was an ancient, powerful Angel of the Lord squished into the comparably quite small human form of the late Jimmy Novak.
driving him around. For months. Dude’s probably just tired.”
Behind the stage occupants, the screen with Castiel’s information shifted to make room for a close-up view provided by the camera that started by his feet and panned slowly upwards. Dean watched attentively, comparing his mental checklist with what he saw.
Across from him, Castiel Novak breathed harshly and looked exactly the way Dean felt: absolutely disbelieving, something between furious and confused, and thoroughly embarrassed. The pool directly next to them threw blue light across Castiel’s face and his wide eyes stared at Dean from beneath a creased brow. His stance was aggressive; feet apart, shoulders squared, fists clenching and unclenching and re-clenching. Their combined heavy breathing and the water lapping innocently against the sides of the pool were the only things breaking the silence. They were
Dean tugged his lip between his teeth, unintentionally coy and seemingly pleased by Castiel’s eager reaction. At last the cork came free of the oil jug with a dull pop and Dean smoothed a generous amount over his fingers before rising slightly off of Castiel’s lap and reaching behind himself.
“So,” Dean said conversationally, rubbing his hands together under water from the pump to rid them of their stickiness, “do you know what ails Princess Hannah this morning?”
“Cas—” he coughed, sitting up and rubbing a shoulder, “why did you—”
Even though Michael was not addressing the real him, Castiel opened his mouth automatically, caustic words on his tongue, but he was interrupted by movement on the bed.
“Well, what did you see?” Dean couldn’t quite keep the note of worry out of his voice. He knew Cas’ grace was little messed up, but if he was seriously injured, why would he say nothing and suffer in silence?
Castiel felt his mouth shape to make the words in Dean’s voice. Memory-Castiel tilted his head to the side, smiling knowingly.
When he returned to the castle, Castiel really ought to visit the temple and offer his gratitude to the creators for their mercy.
After a moment, they broke apart and observed each other. Castiel could feel that his cheeks were slightly flushed, and noted that Dean looked both happy and as though he were anticipating some kind of evaluation.
Abruptly, fake-Castiel halted his ministrations and rose to his knees. The hoarse whine Dean made sent delightful shivers racing down Castiel’s spine and he greedily watched Dean’s red mouth part around harsh inhales, his fists still clenched in the white sheets. For a moment, fake-Castiel seemed to be petting him; one hand slid slowly over Dean’s flank and came to a stop at his waist. The other hand mimicked the position on the other side and the furrow between Dean’s eyes eased slightly.
He peered around the trunk; the rustling had stopped altogether, but Castiel was sure the danger had not passed. A thief would have just taken his unprotected bags and gone; this was something else.
Castiel slowly lifted a wing and stretched it out as much as he could within the confines of the room. The last time Dean had seen his wings, it had been dark and from somewhat of a distance. Up close, he could see the rough patches that had fewer feathers and open gashes that leaked blood into the surrounding area. Whenever Cas shifted a few more feathers dropped, and Dean could see that the feathers around the outer edges of his wings were tattered and frayed, some bent at uncomfortable looking angles and others just barely hanging on.
Dean snorted.
This old factory was big; Dean had suggested that they split up to cover more ground, so off Sam, Dean, and Castiel went in different directions, each armed with a silver knife and a reminder to be wary of anyone else they might come across lest they become the shifter’s latest disguise. Castiel had made his way towards the east side of the place, following shadowy corridors and peering into rooms as he went, the beam from his flashlight falling harshly against cracking tiles, dusty glass instruments, and the sides of ancient metal machinery. Eventually, he had found himself in what must have been an assembly space; old conveyor belts stretched away from him into the darkness, and large vats and bins lined the walls. It was silent, save for Castiel’s own dust-muffled footsteps, but he felt as though he could hear echoes of the room’s past liveliness, as though the room itself was humming its age at him.
Glass bottles tumbled noisily into the metal dumpster, followed more quietly by the cardboard boxes. The cool, humid air clung to him, made him feel sticky and eager for a warm shower. As he reached to retrieve the now-empty bin, something bright flashed in the corner of his eye.
"He may sneeze or have the sniffles for another day or two. If it doesn't clear up by the third day, bring him back in and I'll take a look."
“So tight,” Dean murmured, sounding reverent. The fine tremor that Castiel had detected in Dean’s hands when he’d first dug fingers greedily into his skin had relocated to his voice, and for the first time in many years, Castiel felt pride at his owner’s enjoyment of him.
Arousal had simmered just beneath the surface of his skin for six long days, fueled by the giddy happiness that came with knowing his affections were reciprocated. The handful of hot, frantic kisses they had managed to steal in dark corridors did nothing to sate him; just when he let himself get swept away, Dean would pull back and rush off to his post with an apology and a promise of next time, leaving Castiel flushed and wanting and thoroughly incapable of giving his undivided attention to whichever task was currently at hand.
It only took a few half-formed thoughts in that general direction before Castiel grimaced, abruptly concluding that Dean was quite right. No further justification necessary. Much more pleasant indeed to focus on making his Misery Tea.
In fact, if a hunt ever
A sound somewhere between a whine and a snarl left Dean as he reached down to line himself up properly and then he was pushing in, slowly, achingly.
Dean redirected his attention to the path in front of him as Sam, about twenty meters ahead, disappeared around a cluster of trees as the path curved to the left. Dean huffed a relieved breath and pressed on with renewed vigor; that bend meant that the campus soccer fields were up next, and that was where the yoga class had been setting up.
The distance to his own chamber seemed strangely insurmountable; Castiel therefore offered no resistance when Dean diverted them into the same corridor he’d pulled Castiel into weeks ago.
Side by side, they pressed spiced fruit slices into bits of dough until the bowl was empty. Dean slipped their tray of pastries into the oven to bake, declaring that it would only take around twenty minutes.
Dean laughed. “Careful, unless you’d like your tongue burned.” He looked up from his own pastry and stared at Castiel for a moment before setting his treat back down with an amused snort. “Your royal highness has a royal speck—” Without finishing the sentence he reached up to swipe a thumb against the corner or Castiel’s mouth, presumably detaching whatever bit of pastry had clung there.
“I don’t love you!” Hannah exclaimed. Her eyes were wide and guilty, as though the confession had burst from her without permission. A tear found its way down her cheek and she gripped tightly at Castiel’s fingers. “Castiel, I don’t love you, not the way I’m meant to. You are so precious to me and so good; you deserve to be loved,
. He might have saved a significant amount of time if he’d thought to try that earlier.
Dean rubbed the back of his neck, feeling awkward. None of that sounded cheap; was there a way to convey "he's a stray, I don't know if I'm willing to hand over a bunch of cash if he'll just go back to being a stray" without sounding like an incredibly cruel, heartless bastard? He didn't think so.
It hurt worst of all that night, even in his drug-addled state.
Castiel raised the still-hot sweet and bit into it hesitantly, worried about burning himself. The dough flaked pleasantly and the flavors of the apple and pear, enhanced as they were by the spices Dean had added, exploded across his tongue. It made him think of cozy autumn evenings by the fireplace with his favorite books and warm cider.
“We missed something, Cas,” he insisted for the third time, pawing through a heavy tome far too quickly to be obtaining any actual insight, “This isn’t right. The Djinn is
In response, Hannah swept into a deep, graceful curtsey. “Sir Dean of Winchester,” she returned, tone equally severe.
Castiel looked even wilder in person.
“Some of you may have seen Castiel in the catalogues,” Crowley was saying, “but the handlers have informed me of some noteworthy changes to the personality profile.”
One year later, to everyone’s delight, the Queen gave birth to a healthy baby girl.
His slow response left him open to suspicion, if the critical way Dean studied him was any indication.
The knot of guilt in his chest squeezed tightly at the perceived accusation before the rest of her joke reached him. He laughed weakly, feeling foolish.
He could just put out an extra dish towel for the cat to curl up on and call it a night. Maybe the cat would feel better in the morning, and Dean would return to find empty saucers waiting to be taken in and washed.
Dean nodded, the tips of his ears still slightly reddened. “Thank you,” he said quietly, shifting his chosen spices into his arms and waiting for Castiel to step aside so that he could pass.
No more. The wedding was fast approaching and Castiel grew more anxious with every mention of it. He would do this now.
“Please don’t despair for me; I grew up knowing our story too, after all.” Hannah reached to rub his arm soothingly and Castiel mirrored her small smile, trying to push the more heartbreaking thoughts aside for now. “I only mean to say that in ten years, people change. Things change, places change. I have no doubts that I would be welcomed home with open arms, but I suspect it would be just as strange an experience as looking at myself in the mirror. Perhaps someday, I will feel ready to visit home.”
"That's...well, he's a stray, if that matters."
ones.
Dean had been delighted to find that in addition to being strong, Castiel was incredibly flexible. He had very little trouble dancing across the laser grids Dean set up for him and no trouble at all twisting at awkward angles to reach things. Basic lifts and misdirection came easily too.
“My...grace?” Castiel offered slowly, puzzled.
Disconcerted as he felt, he knew he needed to retain some passable semblance of composure. His trepidation could be explored later, in the solace of his bedchamber.
; even without his magical powers and extensive knowledge about the happenings of several millennia, Cas’ teleportation was more than enough of a giveaway that he was beyond human.
“Oh?”
. Scroll down the page and you'll find the video Castiel plays for Dean!
“What if I kissed you, Cas?” Hearing the nickname was jarring. “If I kissed you, would you tell me where the angel tablet is? I’ve heard angels don’t care much for physical intimacy, but if I recall you were human once. You must have wondered.”
Sam had shrugged carelessly, replying “I was, but I must have taken a wrong turn somewhere. I did find something though, looks like the shifter recently shed his old skin. Come take a look.”
His train of thought was cut off by a quiet, almost hesitant-sounding knock at his door. He opened it to find Dean, looking down at his own feet.
Sam nodded and returned to his work.
“The only reason I spared him was because he carries a grace vial,” Dean went on. “Speaking of which—” He retrieved the iridescent vial from its pouch and offered it to Hannah. Smiling, she tugged it free of the leather cord it hung by and with practiced fingers hooked it to the silver chain around her neck.
Poets would probably have done the piece more justice, describing it in sweeping lyrical sentences just as magical and beautiful as the atmosphere around them, but for Castiel the one word was sufficient.
“Sam, have you finished with the tome regarding pre-biblical theistic cultures and their—“
“I could say the same of you,” Castiel retorted, scowling even as his racing heart resumed an appropriate pace. “What are you doing here?”
"Dean-o! Councilman Roman just called about his reelection brunch this weekend; do we have enough time to swap the cranberry scones out with the gluten-free version?" Gabe's tone was as chipper as ever, even as he pulled an exasperated face.
He twisted his wrist just slightly at the top of each pull on his length, pausing every few strokes to slide his thumb through the gathered wetness at his tip, smoothing it over the sensitive head.
Feeling bold, Castiel tilted his head ever so slightly and, watching Dean closely for a reaction, pressed his lips against the pad of Dean’s thumb in a soft, unmistakable kiss.
. His anger was unmistakably directed at Dean, as evidenced by the way his warm, relaxed features would tense up and become expressionless whenever Dean joined them. For days Sam said nothing, choosing only to roll his eyes at the change in atmosphere. Eventually, however, his patience ran out.
“We ought to start the wedding later in the afternoon,” his mother continued, oblivious to his current inner turmoil, “That way, the Unity Ceremony should fall at sunset. Grace shines beautifully in the setting sun.”
Prophecies, like the people they belonged to, often shared similar qualities but were unique in some way or another. Of course, not everyone was meant to slay dragons and rescue princesses. The majority of prophecies depicted an average life with an average amount of joy and hardship: he would live a long life, she would excel at cooking, he would be liked by all who met him, she would be a talented spell-worker. Every now and again a prophecy was somewhat more impressive: he would embark on a quest and win the heart of his beloved, she would be renowned as the best swordsman in the land. More rarely still, a prophet would find themselves at a loss for how to tell a mother that her child would suffer.
Jack leaned close once Dean was properly situated on a bed and studied the blue Djinn magic that trailed over Dean’s temples and up into his hairline in a lazy, endless loop. “Shouldn’t he have woken up when you killed the Djinn?”
—see the legend through.
Castiel watched dumbly as Dean strained against some invisible force that was slowly but steadily pulling his hands away from his body, leaving him properly on display. Dean glared fiercely at Michael, but the effect was tempered slightly by the bright flush spilling across his face and down to his clavicle.
“Wh—I—” Dean stuttered, the red returning to his cheeks. Fake-Castiel tilted his head, frowning down at Dean and speaking almost as if to himself.
“Are you...” Castiel started, searching green eyes intently when they rose to meet his own, “...a dragon?” It was admittedly difficult to be sure in the fading late-afternoon light spilling in from the windows, but these eyes lacked the cold, calculating emptiness he might have expected to find in a dragon’s greedy stare.
“Just rabbit food toppings, then. Your loss.” Sam merely snorted. Dean scooped up the lone fried egg from the pan and placed it delicately on top of his own burger. The runny yolk was his favorite part, he didn’t want it to break before his first bite.
“This isn’t real,” Dean repeated, and Castiel parroted him, encouraging.
"You just need to feed it," he rushed, "Just put out some milk and food in the evening and walk away, no need to stick around. You can grab the dishes when the trash goes out. Please?"
"Alright buddy," he cooed—
Dean clapped a hand against Castiel’s trench coat as he went by, before heading towards the kitchen and calling over his shoulder to see if Sam wanted another beer.
Specific details of what he might find beyond the entrance were unhelpfully absent from the stories, but Castiel might have expected dust or damp or vermin, something to indicate the passage of time. Princess Hannah had been asleep for the last ten years, after all, frozen in place until Castiel had come of age. And yet, the flagstones were free of debris, the air fresh and cool.
Dean, for his part, seemed thoroughly unwilling to waste energy caring about Hannah or Castiel’s status, or his own relative to either of them. Able as he was to adhere to an appropriate degree of decorum in public, he never shied away from countering Castiel’s opinions with his own, dissenting or otherwise. Honorifics were used only when he meant to tease.
The clanging of the great door had summoned Jack, who peered up at their careful descent and winced as Dean’s boots dragged and thudded against the stone steps as he was pulled along.
"Jesus
“She informed me that I wasn’t worth the effort!”
Castiel knew he should wonder about Dean, ask the lake for anything on the whereabouts or wellbeing of their Oracle, on the off chance that Hannah’s information was accurate. Before he could help himself however, his mind drifted to his home, and his friends and family.
The red in Dean’s face darkened and he inhaled sharply, audibly, before finally meeting Castiel’s gaze. For a second he looked stunned, but then he pulled his hand away abruptly, hurrying to put space between them.
At last, the King could stand his lady’s sadness no more and he summoned a High Priestess to their chambers and asked for a ritual, a ceremony, a miracle that would give them the child they so desperately wanted. Together they prayed long into the night, begging that their blessed creators hear them.
“Well, you know. Nature calls. Can you help me pick out what to wear?” Castiel glared back at him, silent. “I could put on your face and find your idiot friends. Or I could put on Dean’s face and see if you’re willing to open up more to him. Thoughts?”
wedding, dear,” Queen Naomi said, exasperated, “For goodness sake, clever as you often are, sometimes I thank the creators that you were blessed with your father’s good looks.”
“Can you, uh,” Dean shifted awkwardly towards the bed, “Can you show me where—what’s wrong?”
Early afternoon had turned to night by the time Naomi fell back against the blankets with a relieved sigh, looking exhausted but accomplished as she watched the doctor quickly examine and clean the baby boy. With her last bit of strength she reached forward to accept her child, smiling down at him and cooing softly to soothe his cries. The family shifted in the room, each member stepping close in turn to see the new child. Quiet words of praise and excitement melted together, until Anna’s voice rose slightly above the rest.
Darkness surveyed the void around them. “There is nothing here but us,” it said.
"What's up?"
“It was my duty,” Dean said, more to the floor than to Hannah, “but I would have done so regardless.” He returned her fond smile.
"Hey, Dean," came Kevin's voice from the doorway, "Fridge is restocked, inventory's been taken, floors are clean. Am I alright to leave? I don't want to be late for study group—“
The telltale echoing click of heeled shoes on stone reached them at last. Hannah rose as the courier reentered the private temple followed closely by High Priestess Rowena. Her glittering skirts swished heavily against the floor as she dropped into a low, sweeping curtsey.
Castiel remained silent, considering. The name Winchester was very distantly familiar to him, as though he’d overheard it in a dream. He was quite certain, however, that the stories of his and the Princess’ destined meeting made no mention of a guard, Winchester or otherwise.
