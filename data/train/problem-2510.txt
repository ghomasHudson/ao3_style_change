Sorry for the late/short chapter - it's been a week :(
It’s all fine.
“We’re up.”
She arched an eyebrow, then began scanning the room, her eyes pausing at the wall of pictures. Her eyes softened slightly, then continued their sweep of his shitty little bedsit. The empty bottles….the lack of personal items….his clothes hanging out of his duffle bag, wrinkled beyond redemption. Her eyes swept down and stopped. Mycroft did not surround himself with stupid people; he knew that it was a matter of moments before she figured out what he had tried…and failed….to do. John slowly laid his head back down on the floor and at her sharp intake of breath, he closed his eyes.
Very slow, John pulled the nose of the gun out of his mouth and lowered it to the table. He didn’t dare let go; it was the only solid thing that was keeping him focused in the here and now. As he looked down at the gun, pressure began building in his chest. He let out one shaky breath, then another. Suddenly, the anger came roaring up out of him and he stood. Pain shot down his leg, his hands began trembling.
"I checked with your brother, too. We wanted to pick something you'd like." The DI rambled on.
"If I was one of them, why would I need to tell the others where I am? Wouldn't they already know their own hiding place?"
"That was…" came the mumbled attempt at words and the doctor felt himself chuckle as he kissed his lovers hair.
He pondered on that one, but his gut feeling was that the suggestion felt right. So he nodded slowly.
Lestrade shrugged "The blokes from evidence- you know how it is"
Sure, when he raised his hand for John to slide the golden band onto it, his left ring finger refused to straighten like the other ones. But John simply uncurled it with the utmost care in the world and slid the wedding ring in place. The finger bent again after that, but Sherlock let his other ones relax as well, and suddenly it didn't seem out of place anymore. They both grinned at each other.
John found him sat on the toilet's closed lid, hair damp and body already dry – so successful shower, at least – and wearing loose pajama bottoms.
"Yes"
But then the girls' mouth was free once again, and her screams pierced right through him, destabilizing his efforts completely.
But then the detective was breaking the kiss and pulling back just enough so that they could look each other in the eye.
The next day, after lunch, they were all packed and ready to go.
They were given a wide berth when they entered the Yard. Either word of their altercation had flown to everybody, or Lestrade had made sure to tell people to be on their best behavior. Whichever the case, they saw neither hide nor hair of Donovan as they were escorted to a small interrogation room.
Sherlock was asleep by the time he got back, so he went to his couch, lay down and tried to sleep, but failed miserably for hours.
"What's he doing? Is he taking pictures? Oh my god, see what I told you? The freak's taking pictures!" she accused, presumably to Lestrade, Sherlock hadn't turned around yet.
John temporarily looked like a fish, opening his mouth to say something and closing it again over and over "Oh. I- that's, then, great- it's good. That's good." He cleared his throat and felt his heart attempt to leave his chest via his mouth. "Alright. Ok. Then. Yes."
Eventually, the man stopped. It looked like someone had cut his strings loose, because Sherlock just sagged. His arms went limp at his sides, the violin drifting to the floor, the bow pointing downwards in defeat.
"Just going to take my gloves off" he assured, and started to do so very slowly.
He was so focused on texting John – and stopping his partner from mobilizing the entire British Intelligence – that he didn't hear the footsteps approaching and only realized he was no longer alone when Donovan's voice cut through the scene.
He actually left the hospital building and hid on the steps near bushes so he could let it all out unbidden. He cried again, like he had when Sherlock had died, like he had when he saw the man's mutilated hands. He cried with his hands over his mouth and snot running down his face because god- it hurt.
They smiled quietly at each other for a while, both basking in their own satisfaction.
He spent that night thinking, looking at John's sleeping face, memorizing his features and internalizing how much this man trusted him, loved him. If he told John to jump, he'd just ask how high. His lover was willing to lay himself bare and be completely vulnerable in front of him- it was actually touching.
After over a year, John thought he had mastered navigating their physical intimacy and avoiding being a patronizing twat. He hadn't had the need to rein himself back in ages, but this? This he had to be sure of.
"This is fine. This is perfect, ok?" Sherlock told him firmly, and it was part exasperated, part appreciative.
There was an overwhelming response of laughter and mocking as the men clapped their friend on the back.
When they got back, he helped Sherlock back into his bed and for a moment their hands brushed and the unspoken words screamed between them again.
The question was taken as the distraction it was meant to be and soon they were talking increasingly absurd wedding scenarios that neither would ever agree to.
When they woke that following morning, it felt like there was nothing standing between them anymore. They stared at each other instead of immediately moving to get up, and if Sherlock ever needed to define the word 'Home' with startling precision, this moment would have been it.
"I shouldn't have said those things about you. I'm sorry." She said, straight to the point. Despite her cool demeanor, it was very clear her words were sincere and unprompted.
After a bit, the detective moved up on the bed so that they were roughly at eye level with each other and the younger man kissed him softly on the lips before saying "You were brilliant, John" because the doctor had read the situation expertly and known exactly what to do; Sherlock didn't know what he'd done to deserve him.
One day, Molly came over to deliver fresh body parts as per Sherlock's insistence. She cried and hugged him, but John later found out that she had known about the whole faking-his-death thing, and he couldn't help but brood the rest of the day.
Using paper towels he'd found on the counter, John cleaned himself the best he could before he turned to face the DI again. Sure, his trousers were now damp, but he didn't think anyone would notice it much.
The detective looked at him in a silent thank you; a small smile on his face trying to balance out the heaviness of his shoulders and the fear in his eyes.
He cleared his throat "Well, ahm, you were on a mission. In Serbia-"
"Oh, god! What, Lestrade? Just spit it out!" Sherlock demanded, annoyed. He couldn't help but notice that some of the Yard's officers had also left the conference and were lingering around them like a group of uncertain stray cats.
The detective nodded minutely.
"I'm fine, John. Go to sleep" came the tired reply. And then Sherlock shifted on the bed, groaned and became silent again.
John had his mouth closed and expression closed off for a good few seconds, picking his words carefully. "You don't
"Because this case is important! And I didn't want- I knew what you were going to say."
A bit tiredly, but accepting, Mycroft simply got up and took his phone out. "I'll have John's things transferred to the flat" he said to no one in particular, as he allowed the doctor to speak to his brother about the finer details of his future routine.
Well, they weren't inside the building itself; Mycroft had been waiting for him outside in the gardens, back turned and umbrella firmly planted on the floor between his feet.
"I'm really glad we're getting married tomorrow."
They fell onto the couch in a tangle of limbs and Sherlock discarded his gloves along the way – Mycroft had simply showed up one day and handed him a box containing designer leather gloves; they fit him like they'd been made for him, which granted, they probably had. Every time the detective went out, he'd wear them. And while four of the fingers either didn't move or were empty, no one would notice if they weren't staring fixedly at his hands.
"Well, we don't know for sure how or if he's tied to the murders at all, but he's the owner of the house." The DI gestured towards the property up ahead.
Part three is up =)
That night neither of them slept really well. Sherlock tossed and turned the entire time. He'd wake up every couple of hours and John would wake up with him; he was in his soldier mode, completely alert and ready to spring to action.
"Do you want us to take our clothes off?" John offered, as though he had just started reading from a list.
John leaned over to place a peck on the tip of his nose "Well, I am" he assured.
John wasn't even trying anymore. He was sniffling as much as those gathered around them, and this time it was him who almost jumped the gun straight into their kiss.
They moved into their room, and John promptly stood by their side table, hand poised over their lamp. "Lights on or off?"
"Alright, you mad man." The doctor murmured, but his huffed smile was indulgent. He grabbed his discarded coat and followed his partner out the door.
But the detective shook his head. He'd thought about it before, very distantly and very vaguely. Sometimes, he would get hard when he was kissing John; he was sure the doctor knew that by now. But at the moment, he had already disconnected himself from the whole thing. If anything, he wanted a shower.
She turned around and left the room, unable to keep her temper.
Amanda was shaking, her blue eyes completely bloodshot, but there was a slight glimmer of hope in them. She wanted to believe him.
And then all hell broke loose.
They ended up both awake and exhausted at four in the morning, sat in their tangled sheets and damp bed. Sherlock had a glass of cool water in his hands, his head up against the wall and the eyes of a sleep deprived man.
Sherlock and John had mostly retreated after the bust at the abandoned station; it was all up to the Yard to do the clean-up now. Lestrade did text them here and there to update them on the current arrests, but for the most part, they were left alone.
But the consulting detective shook his head "No. I have John. I don't- he won't mind." He intervened, not wanting a strange person intruding on their life beyond this hospital "I don't mind." He added, because he wouldn't really need any help aside from what John currently helped him with anyway. It's not like much would change.
He was dragged toward it, the chain on his right leg long enough to allow it, and placed before it on his knees. Then he was bent forward so that his torso lay on the chair and both his arse and mouth were roughly at crotch level for the men who kneeled around him in a circle. It wasn't as comfortable as it would have been if he'd been able to stand on all fours, especially when the wooden chair dug into his broken ribs, but it was better than the contortionist position he'd been in before.
"You'll have to be a bit more specific. As you can see," he gestured to their surroundings "I am at work, I have patients. I-"
It honestly just looked like he was going to get up and pull John into their bedroom, at first. But Sherlock didn't move and then he was placing both his hands on John's knees, his face dangerously close to the man's crotch.
He was as surprised by this question as he had been two nights before when Sherlock asked if he could touch him. Strangely, this one seemed even more unexpected.
Sherlock's lips twitched; Mycroft was nothing if not thorough.
Lestrade sighed and then looked up at the younger detective "Look, just- just tell me what you find, ok? I'll be- I need to get an ID on these guys, so if there's even a small chance-"
There was no opposition; Sherlock tilted his hips the tiniest bit, leaning into the fingers, and John trailed them down to cross a line he never thought he'd cross.
Going to the bathroom turned into one of the most terrifying moments of his current predicament. The pain was so great that he actually sobbed when he had to do it, and the feeling of humiliation afterwards just made it that much worse.
"I see you are rather aware, brother mine. Welcome back" the man said, balancing on his umbrella, but Sherlock could read his emotions like a book. "Doctor Watson, I believe you would find fresh air to be quite invigorating this evening, I'm informed the staff has just brewed some tea" he said to John, but his eyes never left his brother.
"Sherlock? You ok?" the man asked, his voice as worried as it sounded sleepy.
"Wait- what-" Lestrade started, spluttering.
"They're not getting any deader, John"
He'd never admit it, but his heart was almost at his throat, in fear he had been too late. According to his sources, the original message had been sent over three months ago and he had no idea how long Sherlock had been held captive before that.
He felt it build up like no other orgasm he'd had before. It was intense and overwhelming and he thought he'd black out for a second there.
That first day, they both sat together for hours in almost complete silence. He wondered if there were no world-changing catastrophes waiting for Mycroft back in London, but he didn't care enough to ask.
"No. No, there's- no. Please" sometimes he could reason with them, but they weren't listening-
(See the end of the chapter for
After the whole thing was done and the media blinded John and Sherlock with their excessive flashes, both men were subtlety escorted out of the room by Lestrade.
John almost jumped from his seat in alarm, his eyes wide as he stared towards Greg and Sherlock in turn. What- what? How did Greg even know- and weren't they all dead-
Can we talk about how the *vast* majority of Sherlock's vows, and part of John's were taken straight from the actual series? Like. How was Johnlock not endgame I can't.
John had already given up and was sat on one of the comfy chairs in the living room, watching as his lover paced.
"I don't think this would be an easy case for anybody. But you can't pretend it doesn't bother you, because I know you and I can see it does." he voice was still level, but a bit softer now "Just promise me you won't shut me out. That's all I'm asking."
An umbrella was tapped emphatically against the floor as the elder Holmes turned around.
His eyes scanned the message again and it was simply impossible to stop the automatic memories that came upon reading that word. Flashes of his time in Serbia always crept up at the most inconvenient times, but granted this one was entirely justified.
"I don't want to"
The man's tongue peeked out to lick at his dry lips and he seemed to frown the tiniest bit. "Am I-" he started to ask, and his voice was very hoarse from disuse "Am I in England?" he asked, finally and John had never heard a sound so beautiful in his entire life.
Hailing a cab, he quickly made his way across London to the crime scene where he was greeted by the Yard's finest, looking frustrated and clueless as per usual.
"I know, I'm getting there" John told him playfully, but pressed a kiss to his shoulder and then finally, finally, held himself in his hand and lined them up with purpose.
Sherlock shook his head.
When they arrived at the hospital and piled out of the police car, however, Sally lagged behind.
John's sigh of defeat matched his and the army doctor ran a frustrated hand across his face, the other arm falling to his side. "I know." He half murmured, half bit out. "I just- I meant what I said. I meant what I said and I don't want you to doubt that." He explained; closing his eyes and whishing he could will his erection away. "I try to… keep it out of the way, but I can't exactly… control it." He gestured vaguely downwards, shifting uncomfortably on the sofa.
As they pulled on each other and kissed fiercely like they were trying to meld their bodies together, Sherlock's eyes spoke to him. The piercing, pale blue eyes were blown with lust, with love, and they wanted something from John.
But the guy had no interest in his reservations, he pulled Sherlock roughly by the hair and lifted it off the floor so the detective was arching very painfully in one of the most uncomfortable positions he could imagine.
A cold breeze brought his attention to the window. Where there was once a single pane of dingy glass, there were only shards hanging around the frame. He gritted his teeth and breath through his nose. Once. Twice. Fuck.
“Okay, Okay! We’re not as young as we used to be!” The crowd hollered back “NNNNOOO!” as Greg shook his head.
Sherlock was looking down at him, panic clearly etched across his face.
John’s hair fell over his eyes as he glanced down at the guitar in his lap, doing a quick visual check to make sure he had his finger placement right before he looked back up at Greg Lestrade. Although he had been playing backup guitar in Greg’s group for almost 3 years now, he still wasn’t confident enough in his ability to find his placement without looking first. He signed internally; Sherlock would probably be able to play Bach on the guitar on the first go, after a snide comment about how “common” the instrument was.
The approving roar and clapping of the rest of the pub brought John out of his stupor and even Sherlock jumped at the sudden noise. Sherlock stared at him for a moment, then took one step, then another towards him until they were mere inches away, the microphone the only thing separating them.
As the last “Hallelujah” rang out across the silent pub, John blinked away the tears in his eyes and glanced up and into a pair of blue-green eyes.
Of course…of bloody course. Even in this, he was a fucking failure.
“M…Moriarty?” John croaked out, unable to move.
Moriarty sniffed the air, then turned with a smirk on his fanged face. “Oh look, hors d’oeuvres!” he leered. John leapt into the air and dove towards the spider, blades pointed forward. Moriarty hissed and jumped back, but not quick enough to avoid the slice of John’s blade as it nicked one of his legs. He screamed in pain and began throwing balls of black fire towards his now smoking leg.
Greg finished off the latest song and bounced back from the microphone, grinning. He leaned over to grab his water bottle next to John’s feet and as he came up, he met John’s eyes, eyebrow raised. John stared at him for a moment, then nodded. He grabbed his own water bottle, took a swing and then grabbed a stool left on the edge of the stage. It was time.
“After the wife left, I thought my world had come to an end. Everyone was sympathetic, but they had their own lives. My insurance was shite, so going to talk to a professional was out of the question. My mum had always said cleaning was good for the soul, so while I was cleaning out the closets, I found my old guitar from school.” Lestrade smirked at the memory. “I wanted to be the next David Bowie, but I was total crap the first time I picked it up. The feeling, though….that release of emotion on the first chord I learned….I never forgot it.”
John rubbed his eyes. "I...I...all I could see was that bloody door. If I go through that door and up those stairs, it will only make it real. I...I...just can't! To see the stacks of paperwork...to see the experiments in progress....like he's just ran out to a scene and would be back in a moment.” He let out a shuddering breath. “I can't go back there, Mycroft."
John carded his fingers through Sherlock’s black curls and reached for his dimming grace. Gently, he kissed Sherlock’s forehead and rolled his now limp body to the ground beside him.
Sherlock looked into his eyes and read the truth.
John signed and texted: When?
By the time Sherlock came back from the dead, they were performing every Friday night at the Ram’s Head and getting paid for it. The pay itself was shite, but the tips were always good, especially when they managed to add a new song to the rotation.
“John? Can we try something a bit different?” Greg asked tentatively.
“You’re…you’re my Conductor of Light. How can I...how….” Sherlock shuddered as the first tear ran down his cheek and dripped off.
John gazed at the damage for a moment, then a chuckle made its way out. He pressed his lips together – this was a bit not good – but another chuckle escaped. His lips twitched, then a bellow of laughter ruptured forth. John bent over, laughs and snorts rolling out of him. He didn’t notice when tears began to intermingle with the chuckles, slow turning the tide from hysterical merriment to just hysterical.
“Nnnnnoo, no…this isn’t how this was supposed to happen. I was supposed to DIE so you can live!” Sherlock managed to gasp out, his shoulders now trembling.
John’s lips parted, whether in amazement or to console Sherlock, but he wasn’t sure which one it would have been because Sherlock suddenly leaned forward and pressed his lips gently against John’s. John sucked in a sharp breath and then reached for Sherlock, knocking the microphone over.
John waiting another month before texting Greg and Mike, asking if they were still practicing and if he could rejoin the group. Both responded with an enthusiastic “Always, mate!” and “Yes!” and John smiled down at his phone as Sherlock came through the door in a whirl of his Belstaff.
"You are welcome to stay for as long as you need. I will maintain the rooms on Baker Street until such time I am able to deal with them." Mycroft noted.
“Since I know most of you blighters, make sure you behave or else you are pulling crossing guard duty until you pension out. Don’t forget to tip the wait staff!” Greg looked over his shoulder at John and Mike. John grinned, feeling the butterflies, at last, subside, and the familiar surge of anticipation and adrenaline filled him.
He broke into a run. His dress shoes slapped the pavement, his lungs burned as he pushed harder, faster, to put the memories of that door behind him. If he can keep ahead of the memories, then they aren't real. It never happened. He found himself at the bridge, watching the Thames sweep by underneath. A small part of him wondered if the water could sweep away the memories…the pain…
Cool fingers brushed his hair away from the collar of his jumper and then he felt the needle slide into the back of his neck. Before he could take another breath, the world went grey at the edges, then started to go black.
Greg grinned back and nodded at Mike, who began the drum into to “My Sharona”. John and Greg jumped in with the guitars and Greg began crooning “Ooo my little pretty one, pretty one….” The crowd began to dance and sing along. They, amazingly enough, knew the words, but John smirked; it was early yet and the alcohol hadn’t come into play this early in the evening.
So small, but yet so final.
“I can barely play the guitar as it is…and my voice isn’t as smooth as yours.” John protested.
John’s eyes drifted up to the wall where his precious pictures of Sherlock were posted. This was the last thing he wanted to see as he left this world – the man who was his everything. His heart.
“I think you should take lead vocals on the next one.” John was already shaking his head even before Greg finished his sentence.
It’s fine.
“Get back here, you little annoying humming bird!” Moriarty shot out web-like strands of hellfire towards John. John dipped and twirled through the air, his left shoulder and wing twinging from the strain of not being used like this in millennia.
As he slipped away into the darkness, he thought he heard Anthea murmur “Oh Doctor…we have failed you...”
“Not now, John…..I have thinking to do. Case.” Sherlock cut him off abruptly and fell silent.
A murmur of laughter rippled over the crowd but died out instantly as John strummed the first opening cords of the song…
He had still followed the news for the first month, but as the newspapers were awash with the stories of Sherlock the fake, Sherlock the fraud, he stopped picking those up. Apparently not even Mycroft could keep the papers on a leash. He shot out the television one night in a moment of drunken rage when the commissioner of Scotland Yard denounced Sherlock's work with the department.
Click!
“Clear!”
*****
John bared his teeth and leapt back into the air, his massive wings beating once, twice, to give him the desired height. With a roar, he lunged towards Moriarty, the flaming blades flashing through the air. He dodged several of Moriarty’s massive legs, scoring a hit along his side before he veered away, shooting back up into the air.
“Please God, let me die.”
John was in a free fall when Lestrade first came to him with the idea. It had been 6 months since “The Fall” and John had lost interest in everything….the Work, his medical practice, his blog. Although he had functioned just fine before Sherlock (at least, what he could have accepted at that time as fine), he was living in a world of blacks and greys, with the occasional sepia moment. Then, with an explosion of light and color, Sherlock had whirled into his life and John willing boarded that roller coaster. Then, 18 months later, a phone call, a whispered “Goodbye, John” and a fall had shattered his world.
“We really need to start covering happier shit.” John muttered under his breath.
Click!
“Now, now, my feathered friend. Would upstairs approve of such language?” Moriarty tsked as he stood up and began brushing his clothes down.
They turned the last corner and John blinked. The pub was full, with patrons spilling out on the sidewalk. John turned to Greg, confused.
John nodded again; he was in autopilot. The less he had to think, the better. Mycroft gestured to the waiting black car and he slid into the back, barely registering as Mycroft slid in behind him and murmured something to the driver. The car swept away from the bridge and headed towards the outskirts of London.
John furled his brow. “I appreciate what you are trying to do Greg, but I was a mediocre clarinet player at best in school and my tremor has come back.” He held his hand up to demonstrate.
At the sound of his name, his paralysis was broken but his heart had climbed up into his throat. He could feel the very air around him pressing in, the buildings curling overhead, threatening to crush him with their very mass. He spun on one hill and started walking briskly down Baker Street...away from that infernal door.
He spent most of his time, when he wasn't drinking or passed out, looking at the grainy photos of Sherlock he had cut out of the tabloid rags before he stopped buying them.
Greg raised his hand and waved as he led Mike and John to the raised stage in the corner that the pub kept for live performances.
John signed. At least Sherlock won’t ever know about this.
He stepped up to the lead microphone and looked out over the sea of people now crowding up to the stage. John plugged in his guitar first then Greg’s into the sound system, then did a quick strum. Mike was climbing into his seat behind the kit and flip the switches back there.
“Hush now…hush…this will all be but a bad dream…hush, love” John whispered as the other man closed his eyes and trembled. Sherlock leaned over and pressed his forehead to John’s.
Click!
The practices have been going surprisingly well and other than snide remarks from Sherlock every time John left the house for practice, Sherlock has left him alone. He didn’t invite John back on the cases either, but it’s fine, it’s all fine. Or, at least, John hoped it would be.
“She started by asking me a question: ‘Why didn’t you tell me you’re demisexual?’”
I liked, and even later in our marriage, loved Anna. I made a family with her, but she never had my heart like Ossian.
Life can change, even if we think nothing will change.
Sherlock’s bed is very narrow but he thinks he will sleep alright in it for the few hours he needs to sleep.
“Like I started to breath again.” The words comes out of John in a low voice.
“I think it’s the same time as it took me, 44 weeks, or maybe a bit longer?
“You don’t think you knew him as much as you could have?
“I loved my first boyfriend with all my heart. When he touched me I felt like my skin was on fire, but my mind was calm and safe. The sex was the best sex in my life.”
Peter nods, understanding what John is talking about.
“He will fight it.”
He reads: Buckie 8 100 people lived in the town (2006). It’s a very little seaside town in the north of Scotland. The name comes from a spiral-shelled marine gastropod or its shell.
Without saying the word demisexual, it was like the author wrote Sherlock being that. It also made me think about how few Sherlock stories  are actually written from a demisexual person’s POV on / experience of love and sex.
“Sherlock?!”
“Neither have Monty and Giles, they haven’t gotten any answers from St Gregory church. They’ve talked with Father Holstii twice and the only thing he told them was that his great-grandfather suddenly left one day at the end of 1925. Monty said that Giles has a feeling the priest really knows what the reason is, but doesn't want to tell them. What do you think is the reason Hamish left his family and didn’t take them with him to London?”
“Good morning, my name is Sherlock Holmes and I’m a Consulting Detective. John is my friend and colleague and sometimes writes about our cases on his blog.”
Saturday morning at John’s house. Rosie is woken up early this morning and demanding breakfast. In the last week she has been up very early every morning.
“As far as I can understand from the books he had two long relationships and many one-night stands.”
Looking up, John doesn’t say anything but pulls Sherlock down with a hand behind his head. The kiss is just a slow movement of lips against lips, each searching for approval from his partner.
“Yes, sometimes. She texts, or she comes over some evenings. She’s met Richard and likes him, but thinks he’s not my future husband.”
“John, are you listening to me?” When he gets no response, Sherlock takes a step back and lays his left hand on John’s shoulder, squeezing it carefully. “John!”
Sherlock only looks John in the eye. They’re just standing there, looking into each other’s eyes.
“When I met you I realized that you were bisexual and in the closet. You tried to pick me up for a fuck at Angelo’s.” John recoils when he hears Sherlock’s words. Sherlock never uses vulgar language.
“How would you advise me to handle the situation, then?”
John is try to collect himself but is feeling so lost and sad.
John’s shoulder starts to hurt so he lies back on his back again.
“Something central, near you and Mrs Hudson if it’s possible, but the rental is probably too high for me too manage.”
“Daddy, I caught a frog. Rosie was quiet and didn’t make a sound when I did that, but the twins ran to Auntie Moira screaming!” Hamish starts to laugh happily and Rosie joins in.
Sherlock is probably still in bed but he wants to know if they will get together today for a chat. His stomach is crouching with nerves.
John has difficulties sitting still in the chair. His left hand is clenching and opening, and he’s shifting around on the chair.
“I think cousin Hamish has something to do with that!” is Sherlock’s whispered response.
Sighing, Sherlock turns to his left stretching out in the bed. He couldn’t lie to himself any more: his sex drive was back with a vengeance and apparently John felt the same way.
…………………………………………………………………………….
“Not everyone has the same faith as you, Father!” Monty says, in a low but sharp voice. The priest falters in his step forward and turns his head to look at Monty.
“Peter suggested it last time I had therapy with him. Darin Wilkinson, his partner at the clinic? He explained to me that Darin has worked with agents who have been through traumatic experiences and now are living with PTSD.”
………………………………………………………………………
“Yes, I can understand that it was.”
“I can´t wait!”
Bear with me, this is embarrassing, but sometimes a voice in my head makes me react negatively even when I really want something. I think it´s my father´s voice.
“Well, you have the right, after all the times I’ve cockblocked your dates.” Sherlock says this with a smile.
Sherlock looked at John and nodded his consent, so John gladly said yes to the invitation.
“Is that true! Are you two really Mr Holmes and Dr Watson? Some years ago I read your blog, Dr Watson.”
“John, thank you!” Sherlock whispered before his mouth sought out his lips.
After a very short time the man was back again. Again, Sherlock refused the man a kiss, the guard did the same thing at last time. Now the man let a very long-time pass before he entered the room again.
John starts to laugh, but there was no mirth in his laughter.
Peter had also pointed out that John’s demand, to always know when Sherlock would meet Richard, was an attempt to control Richard and Sherlock’s interactions.
“Why would I want to meet a woman again?” Both Greg and Mike laugh at what he said.
After only three meetings Darin had realized that. He had asked him if he had any friends aside from John; he then plainly asked, what about Richard?
“Hello, John, I've been preparing a celebratory evening to start our anniversary weekend. No Mrs Hudson or Rosie at home to worry about.”
John doesn’t understand what’s makes him wake up, but when he looks besides his bed he sees Sherlock. Sherlock is standing there besides the bed in his old silky blue dressing gown with bullet hole in the sleeve from when he shot the wall. It makes John smile at the memory.
“Richard has his baggage too from his own relationship, he’ll understand.”
He reaches out his hand to the woman and says at the same time,
John’s anger and long walks had lasted for nearly two weeks after that gruelling discussion and Sherlock’s deadpan solution that didn’t involve him.
“No, I haven’t seen it. Why did the paper’s front page upset you?”
Rosie is screaming and crying rather upset now.
Sherlock was very tired the next day when he enters into Darin´s office.
“That must have been awkward?” Peter sounds very sympathetic when he answers. Trying to move along the discussion, he asks,
“I’ll give you a suggestion of an activity you can try. When you’re lying in the darkness before going to sleep, try to tell John something that you want him to know but don’t dare to tell him in daylight.”
“Oh, only thinking how good a friend Janine is.”
That’s the last answer John was expecting to get. “Toy?”
Sherlock doesn’t respond directly, and John waits for him to say something.
“Dr Watson?”
“Sherlock! Aghhhhh!”
“Sherlock, even John has the right to his privacy. Do you tell John everything you do?”
Dear Mrs Watson,                                                    29th October 1982
After coming back from that week--in Liverpool of all places because of Claire’s family living there--James had no time for a holiday.
Sherlock had answered an equally calm “Yes.”
“Yes! It’s my personal life experience. Therapy made it possible for me to get married to Giles and stay married to the love of my life. Why shouldn’t you be able to do the same?”
Listening with eyes wide open and a bit startled, Sherlock protests.
“Yes, On 3th Charrington Street, a parallel road to where we used to live at 24th Penryn Street.”
“Yes, or maybe more reinforcing my earlier deduction? Your father and sister are gay, you have just accepted being bisexual. Three people in the same family? Monty was only a part of the puzzle. Then we have the things with the name Hamish, you were ashamed of your name! The same with Monty--Giles had to fight to give their son that name.”
As soon as he tries to rise from the bed Rosie startles awake again. She’s not having it, that he should leave her and daddy. John takes her in his arms and tries consoling her.
“Mum must have been crushed.” He’s shaking his head in disbelief before he says. “She loved him so much, nearly desperately. Even as a child I understood that it couldn’t be good for her.”
He had never used one, and being in a relationship, why should he?
At last John could talk, “My safe words are;
Stop: Cane (I hope to never need to use it again.)
“A soldier on his mission,” Sherlock thinks.
That fic will start posting when it is already completely written! Tildathings/Tilda
“After one time to many of his negative response to moving in with me or buying another house some other place there we could live together. I couldn’t stand it anymore. Living a half life always waiting on his bread crumbs of affection and companionship. There were nobody left for him to think of that would take it badly if we lived together. Yes, his sister! But they were never close and they so each other maybe on time a year or less!”
“Can I help in anyway? hesitant John ask, he doesn’t want to intrude but he can understand the other man’s feelings.
**********************
John is having a hard time, liking the boyfriend of the man you love isn’t easy.
“I think both John and I are pretty good at doing that.” A sad smile comes over his face. Peter accepts the answer by nodding his head and asks a new question.
”Hamish joined the military because it was the easiest way to get an income to support his family. The first day of training he met J.H, as he was called, and my Father wrote in his diary *I felt like a ton of bricks fell over me*  when he met J.H for the first time.”
Smiling, John nods. When Sherlock sits up and John rolls over onto his stomach and he hears a thoughtful, “I think it’s better if you’re sitting on the bed with me behind you.”
He’d thought Monty would say something more about jealousy when he come back from the kitchen.
Sherlock was hitting a punching bag in a corner with nobody around.
Nodding, Peter realizes that his client isn’t ready for such a step--to masturbate in the same room as Richard.
“Is it too early, or could we go to bed too?” Hesitation is clear in John’s voice.
John hadn’t even seen the condition Sherlock had been in when he came back. Could he ask if he’d hurt Sherlock’s back even more that night? He’d hurt him badly, hadn’t he?
“I don’t think they do, Madam. John and I, aren’t a couple. We’re meeting Father Holstii for an investigation.”
Again John’s brain works at warp speed: “You like soldiers?”
In the reception they’re greeted by a woman in her forties with a big smile.
“That’s what Peter thinks, that I took on a case that made it possible for me to allow myself to use. Then Mary gave me the permission again to save you.”
Silently John takes the lube from Sherlock and starts lubing his dick. With a low but serious voice he says, “when I had those sexy dreams about you, your dick looked exactly like this. How could I know that?”
“Yes, but you seem to be a bit nervous?”
George became friends with students that were gay at university. He kept the friendship all his life even when the school he worked for was trying too get him kicked out.
Then his eyes move over Sherlock’s body down to his penis, and his mind boggles. How did he know in his dream how Sherlock’s penis would look? That long penis, not too thick, with a plump head?
John couldn’t stop thinking about the dream. Shame, lust and many other feelings keeps creeping into his brain.
“In the beginning it was very unsettling. One of the positive sides of our relationship is that I like having him around. Doing things together, like cooking or watching boring movies.”
“If your Alex would walk through that door”, Sherlock had pointed at the door of the flat. “which one of us would you choose? You would choose your husband, wouldn’t you? Not because you don’t love me but because he’s your”- an inhale, and Richard’s face showing him how hurt he felt, stopped Sherlock.
“I don’t for a moment regret my experience with my lover. That’s a treasure in my mind palace.”
“You would tell him that even after yesterday’s affection from John?”
“Roger and my Father had a hook up!
“It has nothing to do with me! It has nothing to do with me!”
“You’re willing to kill yourself with drugs, but not willing to live for me!” John starts to cry. All the stress of their talk and the sorrow of losing even his friendship with Sherlock was all too much to bear.
“Which points do you think would describe your demisexuality?”
John frowns at him over the fact that he’s been smoking.
“How do you mean?”
The first year at King's College in London had been a great relief. He no longer had someone’s eyes on him at every move he made.
“That would never work,” Sherlock interrupts.
What have you done? Chapter 17 I love you
-Sebastian taking advantage of Sherlock, when he was grieving and on the rebound!
“Forty- eight years old, a year younger than Mr Watson. They had known each other all their lives and were great friends, everyone thought. Mr Watson had been married from a very young age, eighteen, I think, and remarried very soon after his first wife died.”
“And you didn’t know?”
“She’s my daughter and--”
After dinner, the evening went by very quickly. It was with a bit of sorrow the two cousins said goodbye around half past six.
It’s hard for John to find the right words and he isn’t sure he can ask the things he wants to ask. Questions about Richard and what they have done this last week burn in his mind and on his tongue. After mulling it over he decides to ask,“What are you afraid to tell me about the fall?”
“Hi, My name is John Hamish Watson, I’m bisexual and still in the closet. But we’re working on that, me and Sherlock, the man by the way whom I love!”
Hi reader. This chapter is now beta read by Totally Silvergirl and edit by the author, so if you still see any wrong spellings or grammatical problems, please let me know.Tilda
“Perfectly?” He snorts and shakes his head. “No, after she left I couldn’t keep up the charade. John saw this but he couldn’t figure out what the truth was, one way or the other.”
Mrs H had gone on a holiday with her sister to the USA, visiting old friends of them both.
He became taken with the man the first time they met, but Commander Sholto kept his feelings in check and for a very long time never let any interest show. They made it through a whole one-year tour in Afghanistan with John falling more and more in love with James.
Peter sounds very satisfied.
“Don’t think I didn’t see your battle with yourself, I did!”
John nods, blushing.
“I’m sorry. I was so angry and jealous that I couldn’t think straight.” John is whispering and kisses Sherlock’s neck at the same time.
“He’s strong minded, our Hamish!”
Suddenly Monty says, “He did feel remorse for leaving his daughter, but not his son?”
“Yes. Peter said that maybe the rampant homophobia in my family comes from generations of gay and bisexual people in the family.”
But that night Sherlock had a very bad dream, and he startled everyone awake with his screams. When John hurried to take care of Rosie a sweaty Sherlock passed him on his way into the bathroom. Sherlock didn’t look or speak to John before opening the bathroom door.
“Maybe? It’s the first time we’ve really traveled somewhere outside London.”
He has thought about Sherlock’s hands and cock.
“IF I want to do something sexual, go for it! If my body and mind are screaming NO! Stop immediately and make the person trying to do things realize that’s not on!”
John sighs and murmurs, “this was the best idea of yours for a long time, sugarnuts!” Sherlock starts to laugh, “you seem to have a thing for my nuts!”
“Well, he’s getting a divorce now!”Greg points and John turns around and sees Sherlock and Richard kissing. Nobody else in the pub seems to react to what they’re doing.
“I know, love.” He takes Sherlock’s nearest hand and holds it. Trying to lace their fingers together.
“That would probably work. I’m a bit surprised that Sherlock is so eager to do this.”
“Don’t forget to inform me if anyone of you can’t come to a therapy session because of your trip to Buckie. I think it’s best to do that investigation as soon as possible? It can have a impact on how our work together will go, regarding what you learn about the scandal?”
“Monty and I want to know about the scandal that made our great-grandfather leave the church and Buckie in 1925.” John starts the questions.
Peter answers his smile with a big smile back.
“Any more questions in the interview that upset you?” Peter asks quietly.
“I told him about six months ago to start taking care of himself and changing his life to something better for him. He really enjoys his time with Rosie and he’s happy that you trust him with her now. After some time talking to each other we even talked about him being gay and wanting a partner in his life. He had just realized that you would never move back to Baker Street and you would soon find a new girlfriend or wife.”
“Yes. I have things to tell you and that I need help to tell you in a way that wouldn’t break us even more. Things about my time away from you, and some personal information about myself that I have problems with telling you.”
John and Richard are watching them from the kitchen. Richard shrugging his shoulders and says.
“Why Hamish? His name was also Montgomery, wasn’t it?”
In a thoughtful tone John answers, “Maybe we can stop somewhere and have something to eat and drink”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Plump head on his dick that is the same as his ass! He moves over the head feeling the start of eruption coming.
Not your servant
“No! Never! I will do this even if it’s kills me.”
“He’s not single anymore and he’s my friend.”
Slowly Sherlock turns to John, catching his eyes. Nervously he bites on his lower lips. John reaches out his hand and intertwines their fingers. “Tell me!”
“Alright, I will answer you as soon as I can. See you soon.”
That question had John humming and nodding, desperately searching for words to describe how the atmosphere in his childhood home had been.
“I can see why you think that. Therefore it’s important that you two talk with each other in a safe place.”
John’s face had immediately closed off and he looked stonily at the carpet.
“I think he handled the situation very well. If he hadn’t said anything, and the reporter had hounded him home to Baker Street, what would have then been printed in the paper this morning?”
John feel a connection between them he never thought he would feel for the man dating Sherlock.
John’s phone gives a signal for a text message and he puts his hand in his pocket to retrieve it to read the message.
“Thank you. I’m sorry for your loss of your son.”
“The highway accident with all those cars. That was two weeks ago.”
Maybe it’s just that I've been in this fandom for over ten years and read so many fics. The stories that make me really engaged have some elements that make them better persons.
If it was John?
“Then I realized how far in the closet John was. I didn’t want a *one night stand*, I wanted a flatmate and whatever else he was willing to give me without leaving.”
1982 November 3, John’s mother kills herself by taking sleeping tablets in the     evening. She is found the next morning by her husband when his wondering why she isn’t up and making breakfast.
“Go on!” John’s voice is steady and calm, maybe because he had expected this explanation.
Peter nods his head and gives him a smile. Seeming a bit settled by that, Sherlock keeps on talking.
He smiles when he finds it and thinks in a little part, Scott should be credited that last night was so good. It was Scott who made it possible for Sherlock to make love the way he and John did last night.
“I love you too, and I am impressed!”
“Call it a professional interest, suicide is always intriguing for a psychiatrist. Especially if the suicide isn’t a suicide.”
They say their goodbyes and John promises to call soon and then they can decide to meeting with Rosie.
“So Sherlock organized this pub evening? So I would start to date again? Did he tell you that he also had a date tonight?”
“How did they know?”
Sherlock gives John the tube and lies down on the bed. John sits up, with his legs tucked under himself. He pours some cream on his right hand, then closes the lid. At the same time his eyes follow Sherlock’s spine down to the pajama-clothed buttocks and he thinks what a lovely view.
“Hope she’ll sleep when we settle down on the train.” Sherlock sounds a bit worried in John’s ears. Suddenly John understands that he feels responsible for them traveling with Rosie, because he suggested that she should come with them.
“What are you two talking about? John, your daughter needs you and I’m hungry! Sherlock storms into the kitchen with a worried face on display.
“Pardon?”
“You learn to live with it. Our I have thought I had learnt to live with it?
In the bedroom Sherlock hesitates for a moment before asking, “Do you want to use the bathroom first?” Then after a short hesitation, “Can we sleep in pants?”
Ten minutes later Sherlock returns, wearing his deep blue dressing-gown.
John isn’t exactly surprised because that’s usually how Sherlock does things he considers significant. John knows now that he’s the most significant person in Sherlock’s life.
Sherlock makes a suggestion.
No, don’t think about it! Sherlock reminds himself sternly. But his mind didn´t listen to him, it rambled away to thinking about the Christmas party, his own nightmares, and John holding him for a very long time that Christmas night.
“So, John, what happened this morning?”
she tells them.
Even he sees that Sherlock is trying to hide his nervousness. It’s obvious for Peter that the man is very upset. “Wonder why?” he thinks for himself.
Sherlock had felt a bit disappointed at the other man’s silence when he told Richard about the session’s conclusion.
“I need to blow my nose, sorry.”
“Sex isn’t important for me for long periods, like months. When I have a need for release, I prefer to do it on my own. I don’t find a person *sexy* when meeting them for the first time. Being with another person can be–”  here he stops speaking, searching for the right word.
Greg and Mycroft had been together for two years, and he and Sherlock for one year.
“Yeah, I would lose you whatever I did.”
Thank You, Silver Girl for beta reading and giving very good suggestion under the development of this chapter.
1909. A daughter, Sarah, is born.
“Yes, the one person you feel the most close to in life can still surprise you and hurt you badly.”
That explanation took Sherlock’s breath away.
Now he had put her down for a short nap. He looks on the kitchen clock on the wall, It said 9.32.
That question seems to throw Sherlock. Friendship– no sex!
Lifting an eyebrow over the change of focus, Sherlock responds laconically.
Seeing the other couple’s reaction, Sherlock realizes what he has to do. “I can’t keep on deceiving myself or Richard, I have to end that relationship. I’ll never love him the way I love this man.” He looks at John with a little secret sad smile.
“If Rosie doesn’t wake up when you laugh, nothing can make her do that tonight,” he remarks in a dry voice.
Greg plucks his lower lip with his fingers, thinking.“No, Sherlock only said hi and started speaking with him just before you came. Who’s he?”
The only person who could see through Sherlock’s mask was Janine. His mouth makes a moue of disapproval when he thinks about that.
“Yes, and I mean it as a warning. Be prepared for what you will see in a moment.”
Hesitantly Sherlock glances in the rearview mirror at John before giving a answer: “You was rather upset when Giles and I came back from church. Do you want to tell me why?”
“That’s a good result for this subject of the session. Is there something else that’s the meeting with Marcus have made you think we must discuss?”
“Your bath is waiting for you to get the day’s grit off.” Sherlock then nervously adds, “I would gladly take that bath with you.”
………………………………………………………………………
After a short moment to gather his thoughts he starts to speak in a low voice, nearly whispering.
How’d that man even been able to contact Sherlock so many years later, and ask for help?
Very soon the kiss gets heated. Sherlock manhandles John onto the bed on his back and straddles him quickly.
“Why am I shocked about that, the bloody man are everything to me!”
He gasps out, “Love, wasn’t frottage on your list?”
When they arrived at a boxing club Sherlock silently went in and naturally John followed. Inside John found clothes and shoes in the bag.
Maud is her opposite, she has dark long hair and is tall. She looks down so John can’t see her eyes. She talks very little and looks uncomfortable.John smiles at Maud and fetches her a chair to sit beside him.
Late that evening, John is laying in his bed in at the flat that doesn’t feel like his home. The flat have never felt like home. Through the babycam he hears Rosie. She is mumbling for herself and then she is snuffling in her sleep.
“Richard tried to talk about us doing sexual things in the middle of dinner, last evening.”
3 February 1877. Ossian Hamish Bell is born in Buckie.
“He’ll be seeing Richard in the meantime?”
“Yes, everything is okay.”
John is up from the sofa and in front of Marcus in no time at all. He is shouting.
Now we know, the fear and shame of losing their work and being expelled by the community. Caused by an unjust law and prejudice!”
John’s mother had always been waiting for her husband to give her the time and love she wated. Mentally she hadn’t been there, only her body had kept taking care of the children, her parents and her husband's parents.
“Oh! I thought it’s started early after mum died?”
Oliver’s 11.01
“Well, we can visit Marcus first and talk to him and after that you can decide what you want to do? Sherlock’s voice is so soft that John get a lump in his trout.
Therefore some of Sherlock’s experience and solutions to his sexuality are the things my life experience has taught could work.
“He expected me to go on after he committed suicide.” John says through clenched teeth.
*****************************************************
He’d put his head against the other man’s chest and chortled. After a moment Sherlock had a joyful laugh with him.
“I had survived and found someone who kept me from thinking about killing myself 24/7. What the hell was I to do? When you might leave me again without a word?”
“What are you thinking about?
“You’re called John Montgomery Watson?” Comes with a bit of a stunned voice.
“S-s-s-Sorry! I made a mistake! Sorry, I thought you were a local  resident, John Watson.” The man doesn’t know what to do and can’t stop staring at this unknown man.
Letting go of much air from his lungs before answering, John feels light-headed.
During those eight days Sherlock had only kissed John a handful of times and cuddled and laughed with Rosie a few times.
With John in the bathroom Sherlock looks at John´s note.
John has the same feeling he has when Sherlock is trying to deduce him without asking questions.
How did we end up here?
He looks at the list of breakfast options that they can order for the morning. They can eat in the compartment or in the lounge on the train.
He breathes in and out, and then asks the most important question for him at the moment.
“Good, do you and Watson come with us home? She can have a nap and you call Marcus. After we can see what Ancetry.com know about your family.”
“I want you to know that I will love you even if you don’t clean, washes or shop our food to love you! But I’m a lazy man and if you don’t makes it clear to me, I will be a brat and letting you do everything!”
Peter smiles happily at him before asking.
John feels like the worst dad in history and is ashamed over having a sex dream about his best friend that’s in a relationship with a man that isn’t him and are a better man than he is.………………………………………………………………………………….
Sherlock bursts through the door and John has only to see his face to walk straight into his arms.
Anyway, here we go! Tilda
This is the first time John has seen the scars this closely after the session in Peter’s office. He runs his hand over the ridges of some of the scars and that makes his breathing hitch. No wonder Sherlock has PTSD and nightmares.
After that short exchange the two calmly had wished the priest a pleasant afternoon and left.
Sherlock looked more and more upset and worried, looking him to Peter and back again, obviously wondering if he should interfere.
Suddenly one of the prison guards had opened the door and walked into the room and opened the cage. He put two blankets outside the cage door, before coming into the cage and standing in front of sherlock.
John grumpily nods and sighs.
"Okay, dad!"
He had taken John into his arms and kissed him.
It's important that you feel safe in my arms and not disgusted or threatened. I have had those feelings and don't want to ever feel them again. The safe words are both for your sake and mine.
At last this fic is finished! But this is not the end of this universe. I will return with a second fic, about the anniversary weekend that John and Greg had planned.
Dinner was serene and happy that evening. The table was set in the hotel’s conservatory, and had a stunning beach view out the window.
“The sooner we get off this train and into the car the better it will be for her.” Sherlock says when he passes him to retrieve John and Rosie’s bags.
******************************************************
****************
“Thank you. I will do my very best to not disappoint you.”
John had thought angrily. He could still feel how scared and furious he had felt over their last discussion about toys.
“What are you thinking about?”
Sherlock’s answer had really shocked John.“You think I would make you do anything you don’t want to do?” He had sounded so crushed.
John looks down on his hands holding hard at the tea cup that’s now nearly empty. He then says in a low voice so Richard can’t hear him if he’s trying to listen at them.
“Yeah, what’ll happen to our little bee then?” John huffs out between spurts of laughter. Sherlock answers him with a smile, feeling so happy that John is calming down from his nervousness.
“Thank you, love. I’ll remember this all my life, you’re doing so well.”
“If we would start a relationship I can’t promise you sex every time you want to have it, sorry!”
“Scandal!” Peter claps his hands together in a loud bang.
“See you at the pub Two Broken Hearts, Maryland Road. Greg and I are on our way there now.”
❤️ Congratulations to our brothers-in-law, for finally getting your act together! Looking forward to meeting my new family member for a pub night. Greg
“I know. We’ve already hurt each other too much to be a couple, John.” He breathes for a moment, keeping eye contact with John.
Looking at the woman he deduces some things:
******************
“Do you understand what I’m trying to get you to see?”
“She did know that you were taking drugs? Why didn’t she try to stop you?”
When the detective did not move, he very efficiently shoved one of his hands down to Sherlock's crotch and grabbed his balls in a very forceful grip that had the detective screaming in pain.
John stood in front of Sherlock, his hand raised and placed gently on the taller man's face. The detective was leaning down and into the touch, his gloved hand coming up to cover John's own. They seemed to be talking, their heads pressed close together almost as if-
John put a hand up in interruption "You think- you think this is some show Moriarty's putting on to mess with your head?"
The man held a small laptop and was pointing at it enthusiastically "You see here? Your base locations. Your friend give gift to us, so we give gift to he." He told Sherlock in heavily accented English, tapping a thick finger against his forehead- probably where he'd placed the bullet in the other guy's head.
"Me too, love. Me too."
"It's not that part yet!" he said, joking through sniffles. And the entire church laughed with him.
"Stop looking at me like that. I was half planning to seduce you into round two, this morning" John said, and it probably wasn't true, but it helped ease the concern on his lover's face. "It's a nice sort of ache." He added, because there was no use trying to deny the soreness altogether – his lover was a bloody detective.
, and they spent the whole car ride in tense silence.
The way they were positioned now, Sherlock towered over John even as his mouth hovered over the man's half hard cock. He was lying down comfortably in his own bed, propped up on his elbows, instead of kneeling on a hard floor. His own cock was nestled warmly against the mattress, pulsing ever so slightly, making Sherlock rock his hips the tiniest bit as he enjoyed the friction. It was a much better situation.
“They both lost their work, and three days later the Sexton died.”
They kept up with the evening beers for some months. Sometimes Bill or another one of the soldiers working in the sick tents sat down with them. Every time John felt like they were trespassing on his time with James.
When Rosie was born I thought very much about how my mum would have been as a grandmother? It’s hurts that she never had the opportunity to be that.”
“Last night you asked me if we could talk in the dark. Tonight I’ll ask you if we can do that again?”
Sherlock was totally absorbed in what he was doing with a dildo.
*************************
“We have both been through fights with family members.”
1970 September Hamish starts his studies to become doctor.
“Well, maybe it will give me some answers to Hamish behavior to?
“How do you feel when he touches you?”
I so dearly want to show you tenderness, we BOTH need that.
John looks at them and shoves over to the other side of the bed, leaving room for Sherlock and Rosie to lie down besides him.
“Respect?”
Slowly they start walking with some of the other passengers out to the train. It arrives at the platform but Rosie keeps on sleeping, even though the train makes so much noise.
He stood there with hungry eyes, looking at the man he loved.
“No! You did everything right. It felt wrong for you to be thrown on the bed with me over you. It’s surprising that you used your words instead of punching me!”
“You didn’t tell him that you were gay either or asexual?”
Sherlock closes the door and goes to the driver seat and starts the engine. The car smoothly starts running.
“Afraid, ashamed and terrified!” Breathing hard, John fights to calm down. After some deep breaths he starts talking again.
Outside the pub the guy asked if he lived nearby, or--?
***To avoid the really explicit section, you can skip from this part of the story***
Sherlock feels like he's been given a big gift: at last John is trusting him with real secrets about himself.
John smiles  back happily and comes with his suggestion: “Or one of us could be called Johnny and the other one John?”
Quickly he stands up and goes to the window looking out and turning his back to the psychiatrist. He desperately wants to get a grip on his feelings and not make a fool of himself in front of the other man.
Sherlock comes into the lounge and sees Rosie and John sitting in the middle of the car wagon. A woman keeps looking at them from a table on the other side of the corridor.
********************************************************
“Tea, Thank’s.” Sherlock starts to make tea to John.
“It depends. I need a connection with the person I have sex with.
“No, I’m a bit surprised but it’s been a very active day for her at the daycare. They had a birthday party for two of her group mates today.”
Darin's suggestion was to book a meeting with him for a couples session.
1965 April 2, Hamish and Jean Leekey wedding day.
Laughing, Sherlock helps him to not fall over; once the socks are off Sherlock pulls him into his arms and starts kissing.
John lays down pen and paper on the table besides his chair.
He’s too shocked by what Peter is telling him, then a lightning thought goes through his mind.
Sherlock huffs out when turning to the door to go after the breakfast tray,
John sighs deeply and plays with his fork a bit before he says something.
Putting the two children down for a nap takes some time.
Asking me out on a romantic dinner and showing me in every way possible that you love me?
“Did you see the front page of the Standard this morning?”
For each training Sherlock having more *interesting* pants.
“Sounds like a plan then!”
This infuriating man, how could he ever think Sherlock didn’t have feelings?
John can’t hide a smile.
“But you were marrying Mary!” Monty’s astonishment is clear.
Spontaneously a big and ironic smile appears on Peter’s lips.
“Richard? But maybe that’s can feel strange for both of you?
Secret’s are revealed and motions are high.
“She seems to be not too bothered by being on the move.” He looks at his goddaughter’s sleeping face. Her cheeks are a bit flushed.
Seriously, don’t read if this is a trigger in your life.
“It can also be like the time when we lived together and we had had a good time the night before, talking and eating dinner. The next morning, Moriarty did his break into the Tower. You were going from the bathroom into the living room after a bath. Showing your newly shaved legs and a bit more of your throat in the bathrobe than you normally did.”
“Stupid people!” He thinks for himself.
1965 April     Hamish education at Sandhurst starts.
He sighs and tries to pull his head together, but it’s hard when most of the blood in his body isn’t in his head.
1967 July Hamish and J. H home on leave. For one year.
John’s heart is pumping so hard in his chest that’s he thinks it’s a wonder that Sherlock can’t hear it.
“How do you feel about that idea?”
John has thought so many times about how he should tell Sherlock about his impotence problems, for a long time now.
The shower stopped, and after some time John heard the noise from the electric toothbrush.
Marcus is looking down on his hands that is folded in his lap.
After a month the situation was much harder and the sick tents were full of injured soldiers. A platoon had been hit by an attack two days before and that day two young soldiers had died.
“Lestrade because of Mycroft Holmes; and Sherlock told Anderson he thought he had the right to know.”
“Years?” His shocked face tells John everything.
“He said that if you were mostly straight you would have a better life as a man with a family. Even if you sometimes cheated on your wife with a man! Yeah, I couldn’t believe he said that either!”
“I told him the first time he asked about relationships that women weren’t my area.”
…………………………………………………………………….
“You’re expecting your John Watson to today?” Sherlockinterrupts the man.
He slips out of the kitchen, keeping his back to her. It's good that he made her favourite meal today - shephard's pie and salad.
The room falls into silence after John says the man’s name.
“Greg! Keep quiet!” Sherlock glares at him. “Go on, John.”
“They kidnapped you on your way to me.”
“Longing for what?” For nearly the first time in his life Sherlock feels totally stupid. What was John longing for? Mary? Or- HIM?
“Well, it’s the best orgasm I had in years.” He thinks sorrowful.
With a shuddering breath Sherlock responds.
“I can understand that, but it’s always hard to break a relationship that’s isn’t good for you but you still love the person you’re living.”
Sighing, John looks away, over Sherlock´s left shoulder. “I would use other words. Like, back at you or, you´re my lovely wife. If she said I love you, my standard answer was *you too*. That all stopped after you revealed that she shot you, and her old life as an assassin. I just couldn't get the words out.”
“When did you see that? Peter is surprised.
Sherlock holds his hand and caresses the parts he can reach with his thumb.
“You know how your brothers are, terrified of their own shadow,” Giles huffs out.
“Why did you want to do therapy with me? What haven’t you told me?” John’s voice is upset and aggressive.
“Your great-grandfather worked for the church for many years as a organist. The church must have some documents about why he was let go from that position. Even if the scandal was hushed up for both the sake of the church and the people involved in the scandal.”
“John! Come here man, what do you want?” Greg cries when he sees John.
This chapter isn’t beta read. I have had help in parts from the lovely people on Discord’ Johnlock club. Thank you everyone that helped me.
After a moment John turns and hides his head into his shoulder and neck.
“We’re not working today! We’re celebrating our anniversary!”
Old Mrs Brown would come up to both of us with snide remarks,  about a year before I married the first time. We were both becoming very afraid that people would send me or Ossian away.
“Whatever has this to do with Sherlock?” Greg  interrupts angrily.
It had become even worse when Sherlock moved in with him and Rosie.
Hastily he swept the whiskey in one go. Rose from the armchair and walked out of the room.
“Yes, therefore it’s better you give us all the details of this ‘scandal’.” Giles answers with a condescending tone to his voice.
After chatting for sometime about Rosie, he asks if he can go through to the backyard? He tells her that he must make an important phone call and he needs some privacy and fresh air.
Why did he say that? But he loves that the other man is calling him darling. Yes, he damn well wants to be Sherlock’s Darling or whatever sweet things he wants to call him.
“Sorry, it hurts, John.” The words are spoken in sorrow and John’s heart hurts too.
It’s still uncomfortable silent between them.
John didn’t take the news well when Sherlock told him about them going to the concert together. John had invited him over for dinner that Monday afternoon. John couldn’t really show what he felt because Harry and her new girlfriend, Miriam were also invited that evening.
A determined look comes over his client’s face.
“Remember one thing, John. You’re not your parents. You haven’t done the things your mother or father did. Even if you didn’t realize it before, you’re stronger than them. You’ve walked your own way in life. That’s something to be really proud of.”
********************************************************
“Hi, it’s John Watson.”
“I said before that I’ve been a stupid homophobic asshole, marrying a woman I never should have married. Protecting my precious straightness in other people’s eyes.” He glances at Monty trying to see if he’s shocked and estranged him forever.
Looking over the list he wonders how long it took before Hamish started studying to be a doctor?
“So the best thing you can do is to invest in a new apartment that probably will get a higher price if she sells it when she becomes twenty-one?”
His mind went blank when Sherlock took off his trousers, he had tight black pants and-- That was the first real sight John had got of the other man’s *package*, though. He hadn´t really seen anything when Sherlock strolled around in a sheet at the palace. When his mind started working again Sherlock had left for the boxing hall.
He stood there looking positively befuddled, glancing between her and the people walking around them. He had no idea what to do with himself or what to say. He even tried to open his mouth a couple of times to form some kind of reply, but none would come.
"No." was the immediate, snapped response he got from his lover. And then the detective was walking into their bedroom and closing the door pointedly behind himself.
John didn't look terribly convinced, but he sighed and nodded "Let's go find Greg, then."
There was nothing else in the room but empty space, it had no telly like usual hospital rooms did, nor was it overly decorated. It looked like an empty ballroom; the walls painted in a warm, inviting yellow and curtains white and tasteful were the only thing on them aside from the couple of paintings of landscapes.
Slowly, he let himself fall on top of his lover; he felt boneless. He hid his face in Sherlock's neck and just breathed him in for a good couple of minutes.
Lestrade sighed tiredly "Yes, I did. I try to tune out their bickering-"
He knew he needed to say something, anything, but there weren't any words- there were no words. His heart was being stabbed repeatedly in his chest and he wanted to bolt from the room so he could cry in peace yet again.
He lay back down on the floor; he didn't have a cot, but he did have a dirty, thin blanket which right now was the single most comforting thing he could ask for. He wrapped it around himself like a cocoon and lay on his side, trying to ignore the persistent pulsing pain coming from his abused backside.
He turned around, holding the patient's chart to his chest like a shield. And when he looked towards the nurses' station he was surprised to see none other than the British government himself, Mycroft Holmes.
"So who's this guy, exactly?" John was asking as he frowned and followed Lestrade's lead.
He even managed to devise a half decent plan of how to subdue his captor when he was taken to the Shower Room by a single guard. He managed, even in his weakened state, to head-butt the man, get his knife, cut his hands free – finally!!! – put the man's clothes on and carefully, very carefully peer around as he disappeared down the hall.
"I'm really glad you hadn't done your hair yet." John, flush-faced and panting, said, because his lover's curls were pointing out in all odd angles from his grip.
The government official had a very likely theory as to why his brother did it, but he did not think Sherlock would appreciate him sharing it with the doctor. Besides, being a doctor meant John was most likely jumping to the conclusion of brain damage, and perhaps it was kinder to let him think that was the case.
The implication was there, but it had been almost two years since their relationship started and Sherlock had never shown any hint that he wanted to cross that particular line. It was reasonable to be unsure of it.
As the door was closing behind Greg, Sherlock rolled his eyes and looked up at John. "It's like they're blind on purpose." He told him, shaking his head. And then grabbed the other shoe and started scraping something off the laces.
"I'm sorry, what?" Lestrade prompted. "He just admitted he threw the bodies in the Thames-"
His lover was very much not looking at him. "I may have forgotten to mention all the details of this case."
"Why does he keep doing that?" John asked out loud once when Mycroft's visit coincided with Sherlock waking up.
The laptop was placed before them, and Lestrade looked almost pained to let it go.
John leaned down a bit so they were closer to each other and he squeezed one of Sherlock's hand in his "I'll come back with you; even today if you want to. But let's go home now, ok?"
Lestrade had never woken up so fast in his life.
This time, The Kid stepped up to him but made no move to fuck his mouth or his arse, instead he said "I clean you" and gestured vaguely towards the detective's back.
With less care than was probably allowed in a crime scene, he started pulling things away from the wall. He jumped on the washing machine, crawled under the table and almost comically sniffed around the books on the bookshelf. He had the urge to pull on them one by one, but refrained. He was half glad none of the others were here to witness it.
He knew what was going to happen.
John was sat on his chair, his old arm chair, and was looking at him with startled eyes "Greg" he breathed out the name in surprise.
There had to be a room under the house they still hadn't seen.
The detective shifted a bit and stole a quick kiss, bumping their noses in acknowledgement of his lover's apprehensive expression.
He searched the detective's eyes for answers – afraid, so afraid, that Sherlock was only doing this because he thought he owed it to John – but the man simply looked earnest; curious?
He'd woken up while one of the nurses was with him, changing the bandages on his back. He was completely still and pliant under her touch, but once she realized he was awake she tried offering a reassuring smile and nodding.
"What you see is the result of the Serbians' hospitality." Mycroft went on, gesturing to the tablet. "He has been back in England for a week, now. I was waiting for him to stabilize before attempting to contact you." That the possibility of Sherlock dying on the table had been very real went unspoken. "I'm afraid he sustained a rather extensive list of injuries- some of which are not of the physical variety." His voice sounded contrite again and John wanted to sob in frustration at the information.
John had to think fast, but he'd also been doing this for years, so it came out naturally "Something about the paint on fence, you know how he is." he said over his shoulder, even as Sherlock did not once turn around to face the police officers.
Her chin trembled a bit and her eyes stung again at the prospect of this man really being her rescuer.
When they made it up the stairs, Sherlock made a beeline to their room and John only stopped to leave his trousers in the laundry bin before following the detective.
The morning was positively hectic.
the motivation being different." He reiterated pointedly as he stepped away, trying to lighten the mood again. For the first time that day, it worked.
John leaned down and kissed him hungrily in response. The moan that was dragged out of his throat made it clear what he thought about the suggestion.
"Just go, come on. You deserve the recognition, you know?"
Sherlock wanted to say that he wasn't actually protesting, but he couldn't voice the realization he'd had just yet.
John opened his mouth, tried to think of something to say, realized he actually didn't have a defense for that, and just shut it again.
"Of course I've thought about it. I've thought about a lot of things." John's fingers were playing with the cap of the lube as he admitted it.
Sherlock rolled his eyes in exasperation and then shoved both his hands inside his pockets.
Beneath the bushy beard and the myriad of bruises was a gaunt face with sunken eyes and pale, chapped lips. It was so beaten and dirty with grime that Mycroft actually took a few seconds to recognize the person for who he was.
Slowly, feeling his heart racing, he nodded.
An order was barked to his friends, and soon they were all stepping forward to each hold one of Sherlock's arms and legs. He tried to struggle against them, more out of instinct than logic since he knew he had no chance to overpower even one of them, let alone four. His hands had last been mutilated after his brief escape ten days ago, his left pinky being the most recent loss, but all three stumps were still healing and he knew it was an exercise in masochism to attempt to stop the men with his hands.
When Sherlock thought about their room, the first word that came to mind was
They were going to shower separately. John even started to – honest-to-god singing in the shower from the mood he was in – but Sherlock was quick to follow him into their bath. Wordlessly, the detective got in behind him, bit down on his earlobe and wrapped his hand around his soon-to-be-husband with a hunger he couldn't hold back.
Sherlock allowed the image to become a scenario in his mind palace and he hid in there, hoping he could borrow some of the scene's warmth for his shaking bones.
"I'm not going to…" was the mumbled reply.
The unspoken question still hovered in the air, but John went on to take care of the surgery scar on Sherlock's leg. This one he had already been helping with; it was essentially healed and only needed a bit of creams applied on it so it'd heal faster.
would they?"
"Yes, well- yes."
"Sir, we've run him through the system, no matches." The mousey boy said, fumbling with his papers like he needed a cheat sheet to report to Lestrade. "We're trying to get a match on the samples we took from the body-"
They stormed in guns blazing.
." He emphasized pointedly.
"John?" came a mumbled sound from the hidden figure.
He did exactly that, and when his hand finally, finally reached inside Sherlock's pants and wrapped around his cock, the detective gasped against him. It was a very good gasp by the look of it, though. And when the teal eyes opened to look at him, they were almost pitch black from his blown pupils.
"Ran off." Donovan said.
When Mycroft came in later that evening, presumably after work, he actually seemed to ponder on the issue of Sherlock's discharge instead of adamantly vetoing it.
He ate a spoonful of the soup and the look of pride and happiness on John's face was enough motivation for him to keep going.
Amanda was looking straight up at him, her red eyes looking slightly panicked "Don't go."
There was a single mattress on the floor, a bowl, chains and a metal pole that was bolted to both the floor and the ceiling. There were dried splotches of blood scattered in different places.
"Sherlock?" John prodded, putting his book down on his lap.
The sequel is also a very short story, and it's almost done. I'll post it soon! So subscribe if you want to be notified of when that's going to happen!
"I won't"
Needless to say, his captors had been less than pleased to find him out of his cell and the security on him had doubled. They did not, however, realize what he had managed to do. As far as they were concerned, they had an MI6 agent on their hands and were going to push him till he sang.
"Don't!! Don't pick it up!" She shouted immediately, completely set back by the new potential threat.
. Then,
John laughed and even Sherlock chuckled, putting the envelope away in his pocket.
Ignoring her, Lestrade just motioned towards a shed where the naked body of a girl lay on the floor.
"You misplaced it?" Sherlock echoed.
It got to the point where he was working himself into a full blown panic when he felt the need coming on, and a week after the ordeal with the wooden leg, he couldn't bring himself to eat anymore.
John was blinking rapidly, and he was already preparing this huge speech about how it wasn't the same thing; about how having something taken from you against your will, under the threat of violence – or, wrapped in violence – was completely different from sharing your body with someone you cared about. But then he realized that it was useless to say it- that's not what Sherlock needed to hear right now. Hell, that wasn't even the point John wanted to make right now.
"We're gonna ask for help."
The muscles around Sherlock's mouth tightened and his nod was almost, almost imperceptible.
Which is why Sherlock found it so strange to be summoned to the Yard a few days later.
"Alright. So just- let me clean this up and I'll be right back. Even a cab won't pick us up looking like this." John gestured to his trousers.
More notes (yes I write too many lol):
Sherlock had thought about it? About them? John's throat tightened even as he caught onto another piece of information.
John nodded.
He'd found his brother, he'd finally found Sherlock.
rather than defensive.
John had kicked some of the sick off, but there was a lot still there and the smell wasn't that faint either. He was a terrible liar, so he made sure he was facing the sink, away from Lestrade, before answering "Sherlock's got a bloody stomach bug. I told him not to go out on a case today, but you try stopping him from doing something he wants to do." He said with his best Disgruntled Sidekick voice.
It was never dark inside his cell, there was always an anemic overhead light that cast a sickly orange glow onto the room, and so as he shifted sorely he could see the mess left on the inside of his thighs. They hadn't pulled his trousers back up, so he pulled it all the way off enough that he could use the filthy fabric to wipe himself clean, flinching as it rubbed against his raw entrance.
He closed his eyes shut with force and tightened his hands into fists. Trying to put two years' worth of misery into spoken language was a ridiculously difficult task.
"Lestrade" Sherlock raised his mug at him in a mock greeting, but took a seat on his chair, completely unwilling to participate.
"Why don't you give your brother a call, then? See what he's got lying around."
-There are some parallels with scenes from S3 here =)
"Why? Sherlock, they're… there isn't a reason for these things. People do it because… " John couldn't find the words to say that rapists raped because they simply did.
John groaned "Oh for christ's sake, you tosser!"
"Amanda" Sherlock nudged, after a couple of minutes had passed. "Scotland Yard is already here, they came with me. But if you don't let me talk to them, they're not going to get to us."
When they were finally sat on their respective chairs, digging into their sandwiches, footsteps could be heard coming up the stairs.
"Yes." The detective couldn't help a small smile. "There are pictures of us on the phone, if you want to verify what I told you."
The DI went on "He showed us where they get the films. It's a site on the deep web. It's got all sorts of security measures in place, but his account is already verified – we have access to all the content now. They do livestreams, we recorded the most recent one." He turned to look at Sherlock. "If you can get anything from the video- anything that could tell us her location… "
The two detectives looked at him, almost having forgotten he was still there. And the sudden focus made both Yarders look at Sherlock properly for the first time. The man wasn't wearing his signature gloves. But more importantly, he was holding a mug in both of his obviously mutilated hands.
Careful with his enthusiasm, John started moving quicker, and the detective was meeting his thrusts and setting his own pace.
"See? If you cooperated, we be friends." He shrugged "But now? Now you, no value." He was still grinning, and the two other men standing by the door also looked just as pleased.
"John" and this time the request was bordering on a whine, bordering on a command.
This time, the doctor had no response to give. Instead, he looked at Sherlock intently, his expression serious and thoughtful.
But then again, brutal rape cases were never easy on the stomach.
For the next full minute, he had to keep himself from looking directly at the screen; he wouldn't last long if he didn't pace himself by looking away.
She looked away from him again, put her hands in her pocket and paused pointedly before continuing "I don't know anything about your life. And even though you get under my skin sometimes, that doesn't make you a psychopath. And I'm sorry I called you a freak. You're not. You're just… smarter than all of us."
"That's the whole point. They're not in London anymore" The detective said, standing up from his seat in a rush.
They'd had no use for him anymore- they now had no use for Sherlock anymore, either.
Uncertain, but unable to refuse, Sherlock got onto his usual position only to feel the excruciating pouring of alcohol down his back and into his arse. He did believe that they were simply trying to clean him with something anti-septic, but it did not lessen the pain he felt when the alcohol came in contact with his open tears.
is why I didn't want you involved. You're going to attach meaning to everything I say. You think I'm trying to- to what? Give myself some kind of closure?" his expression reminded John of when Sherlock had been angry at him for starting to believe Moriarty's lies, back before The Fall.
Once she was dressed, she seemed to calm down significantly, and Sherlock counted it as a win.
"Jesus Christ" Greg murmured under his breath, similar noises echoed by the other people in the room.
The staff often had to explain to him, again and again, that he was in England, in a hospital, and that Mycroft had brought him home, but he would ask it almost every time he opened his eyes.
Into the second week, one of the men walked in and nudged him with his foot "Go" he told him, gesturing vaguely to encompass that Sherlock ought to position himself rather than be held down like they'd usually have to do.
"I wasn't sure if you knew"
"So, ah, it was very- there was a lot of… internal damage." He finished, finally, because he couldn't think of anything else to say aside from getting into details.
"We haven't set a date yet." He answered thoughtfully, as they rounded onto the main corridor. And by the time they reached Amanda Walsh's room, he was honest to god having something akin to a conversation with Sally Donovan.
"John, mate," Lestrade said again, and it was a mixture of pleading and exasperation. "Sherlock?" He turned to plead to the man himself when his blogger didn't seem terribly inclined to let them in.
"Don't blow up the flat while I'm gone" he warned with a mock stern face and Sherlock only smiled a bit mischievously back at him.
It was probably the wrong thing to say as John's immediate response came in a flood.
, but he also thought about their bed and the other positions it allowed for. Here, in the living room, Sherlock had pretty much no choice but to kneel in front of John if he wanted to suck him off. But on their bed, he could spread the other man down, hover over him and-
When they did reach the bathroom, however, things changed rather drastically. The memories of the painful, painful, painful trips to the toilet back in Serbia were very fresh in his head and he shut his eyes forcefully as he tried to chase them away. But it was fear like he couldn't explain, irrational, overwhelming, of the same kind that made him refuse the food he'd been offered.
Sherlock had decided, after much deliberation, to forgo the white gloves he'd initially planned to wear at the wedding. There weren't many ways around it if he wanted John to slide a ring onto his finger. And the thought of hiding that ring, the one that bore John's name, under gloves until the end of time – he couldn't do it. So the gloves came off, never to be worn for hiding again.
He bent down to kiss his detective, but did not move to straddle him just yet. "You sure, love? If you were on top, you could control things better."
And indeed, unlike his prolonged torture sections, this was quick and to the point. The man finished, zipped himself up again and left without as much as a word.
"We've got one of the rapists!" Greg announced once he'd barged into the flat.
Sherlock's smile was tentative, but still there "I do, too."
The stench that came off his feet and the stumps on his hands never went away, though; he imagined they were all getting infected. This was something that John would have known; John would have been able to tell him exactly what stage of infection every single one of his wounds was in.
They exited the car together and slowly made their way up the seventeen steps, one by one. Mycroft and the minion went up ahead to get the doors and leave their things in the living room.
Some part of him still looked around and rattled off deductions in his head, still tried to think of ways to escape, still tried to think of how to get the upper hand.
"I don't know." He sighed, feeling guilty as he saw John was already getting soft.
Sherlock never said anything, but John liked to think the younger man appreciated the scenery. He'd talk to him, tell him about the book he was reading or would just point out the trees in the garden or the new flowers that had come in. He'd wheel him up and down the small balcony before settling down beside him, and together they would stay there for at least a half hour.
He wanted to corner her and ask her all the details, but she was gone before he could get his voice back.
Both men frowned at him. "Who?" John prompted.
He looked up to see they were alone in the room and that his lover was staring worryingly at him.
" he repeated, still dazed.
Sherlock nodded, understanding now why they wanted him when they seemingly had all the information they needed already.
"I know" the detective replied after a while. "You keep them in your left pocket ever since that incident with the tourists."
"Yep, me and John."
He had also brought puzzles, actual picture puzzles, and Sherlock had taken to putting them all together as quickly as he could. It made for John sitting and staring at him for hours at a time, staring at his right hand with the three fingers and his left hand with the four fingers and a ring finger that did not move.
"Oh my god" Sally exclaimed again, turning around like she couldn't look directly at the scene. "Oh my god. The freak-"
There was some shuffling from inside and another sigh. Then finally, the detective said "You can come in." and he sounded defeated.
When the doctor came out, she didn't look terribly disheveled.
"Let's see it" he said almost absentmindedly as he continued to stare into the distance. There was some shuffling inside the room, which he imagined was Lestrade, but soon John's hand was closing around his upper arm and pulling him towards the corner.
The look on John's face was one Sherlock wasn't certain he wanted to dissect. He actually looked befuddled, but it was a look that carried a bit of pity.
"No. Me and John. Alone."
When John finally positioned himself properly and lined them up, they stopped moving altogether and just stared at each other in anticipation.
That startled a laugh out of John, who slumped back down and just grinned into his partner's skin.
He looked down at his hand. Semen was drying on his skin and he really wanted to get up and clean it off-
Out of all the scenarios Sherlock had imagined when he first heard the gunshots, this one was probably the last on his list.
They both stood there having a staring contest, neither willing to back down. Eventually, Sherlock growled in frustration again and spun away, going to stand by the window before turning back sharply.
The younger man continued heaving; subdued moans accompanying each spasm. But there was little more than bile coming up and soon it was just dry heaving that kept him hunched over the side of the bed.
he thought "But- I hadn't expected it to actually… feel good? Physically? It feels good. It felt good- I really didn't think it would."
John had his eyes closed and his hand up to stop Lestrade from talking as he processed the information.
Hope you enjoyed it, and subscribe if you want to know when I post more stuff =)
On the background, said forensics people waved timidly at them.
Acquiescing, Sherlock tried to right himself a bit and then cleared his throat. He drew in a deep breath, squeezed John's hands and let his love flow out of him without restraint.
Sherlock honestly had expected to be back before John's return from Tesco but the crime scene had been further away than he had anticipated.
His ribs had almost entirely healed at this point, sometimes they would still hurt a bit, but it was barely there. His legs weren't quite there yet though and sometimes they would simply give out on him, though thankfully not both at once.
Sherlock nodded, but then looked back to where their victim was still sat on the floor, overwhelmed by the commotion despite her relief.
"That's exactly what I don't want." The detective replied matter-of-factly, shaking his head "If I have to worry the whole time about whether or not I'm hurting you, or going too fast, or just- I'm not going to get into it."
He sighed, and decided to just march on "Fine."
, he meant it literally. Unzipping his trousers and reaching inside was allowed, then.
"I'm- I'll just- I need to-" he was standing up so fast he almost knocked his armchair over, which was a feat given how bulky it was, and then he was running out of the room.
Sherlock could only watch, hungrily, as John opened the bottle cap with movements that spoke of familiarity and coated his fingers with lube before reaching behind himself. His doctor had long grown out of any shame when it came to pleasuring himself in front of Sherlock. A huge part of their initial sexual relationship had relied solely on John masturbating while the detective watched on.
On one particularly sunny afternoon, the detective seemed more agitated than usual. He kept shifting on his chair and licking his lips over and over. When John noticed and asked him if he was thirsty, Sherlock turned his head to look at him very slowly and nodded.
"Do you want my coat? I can give it to you." he offered, because when he'd been in her place, his blanket had been the most comforting thing he'd had.
John was the one to groan angrily at the noise and finally give up on sleep. "I'll get it" he bit out, grumpy as he had all rights to be.
John gestured towards them and asked conversationally "What are those?"
Then the doctor turned around slowly, his mouth opening in a soft "Sherlock-"
"I know that" Sherlock said, as though it was obvious, but he still looked around with suspicion. "I'm- I should go back to my room." He said then, and John didn't argue.
John remembered that, so he nodded "But they would have been caught, if that were the case."
The doctor finally dropped the pretense of not having anything to do with the situation, and stopped eating to look at him. He shrugged "Military, remember?"
John had the decency to look sheepish, but he just shrugged as the door opened.
Tentatively, John raised one of his hands and slowly placed it over Sherlock's left one, stroking the back of it every so lightly while giving him his best awkward smile.
to form hypothesis, to
He even made it to the door that would have led to the outside, the place wasn't very big and the activity was mostly kept on the other side of the building, but it was locked and he had to think quickly. There was a keypad by the door and he could deduce the password numbers by the use, but not the order, so he'd have to try his best guess.
He didn't want to hover around his flatmate, but the man was taking a shower on his own, with no support bars like the hospital had and John didn't want the detective to slip and hit his head or something. He was taking too long.
"Come on, let's go upstairs." He said in an equally hushed tone. "I got you, ok? I got you. You're fine."
"Oh, you know what, I think I'm gonna run to the desk for a bit, see if they have some aspirin. I have this headache and…" he trailed off, still not looking Sherlock in the eye lest he'd give himself away.
"Oh that's just perfect. What is
Monty tries to stop laughing, in between bursts of giggles he gets out, “Yes Mrs H!”
Silently he moves his fingertips over the book page as he’s just seen John do.
“I don’t have anyone left to lose. Harry, my sister, is the only one left but she’s a lesbian.”
“She heard me! She wasn’t even angry when I came out of my room after putting on some clothes. She had made tea and sandwiches, ready on the table and a big smile on her face!”
The order is clear in Peter’s voice.
“Good. Please don’t repeat Hamish’s mistakes. Tell people around you what you feel and accept help to formulate your feelings. If I had to do it all over again I would have made us talk, Hamish and me.”
Realizing how blind he’d been to Sherlock’s suffering from PTSD had been a real shock to his system, both physical and mental.
“Yeah, homophobes be warned!” John chuckled and Sherlock looked very proud at the man holding his hand.
“You’re going on a journey with John, maybe that will give you an opportunity to talk.” Sherlock doesn’t say anything, only looks at him.
“Jealousy’s a bitch!” John’s voice is very sympathetic.
……………………………………………………………………………..
“That’s being a grown up, taking care of your own sexuality. The person getting a no must take care of themselves.”
“Two weeks later at 21 of August he threw a blow at Hamish head. Hamish answering with blows back and there needs four men to separate them from the fight.” <
She quickly shakes John’s hand too. John is glancing at Sherlock, why did he do that?
Peter Morse comes out to the reception, speaking quietly with Theo.
Telling each other things they never told anyone else.
“John told me yesterday that you two met at Saturday and agreed that you, Sherlock, would help him investigate why homophobia are a problem in Watson family?”
Slowly John’s fingers distribute the emollient from Sherlock’s shoulders, down to his spine.
If your partner tells you that they are demisexual, it’s best to ask them questions about what works for them.
He stops in the doorway looking at the pair in front of him and smiles.
“One photo was of them at a film store selecting a DVD, another photo was taken when they were strolling through Regents Park. They're arm in arm, Sherlock laughing and Richard looking at him with heart eyes!”
“You mean telling him more about my sexuality?”
“We would be foolish to try too be together now. Too many things are broken between us. Too many things that would break us apart after very little problems. I can’t lose you all together from my life. You and Watson are the most important people in my life.”
“No. I was thinking about my session with Peter, I’d been to a session before meeting Richard.” A distressed frown comes over his face.
“No, we talked about what I feel when I’m being touched.”
Sherlock doesn’t react at first. Thinking over John’s words carefully.
John looks up on his back and gasps.
"Rosie, I will only go to the toilet. Eat you lunch in the meanwhile."
A comfortable silence reigns in the car. John is looking up information about Buckie and the hotel they’ll be staying at.
“For god’s sake! Why didn’t you tell me?”
“Maybe we can get some more data on Hamish’s parents and siblings,” Giles says in a low voice. It’s like the room is suddenly very cold after the two other men have left.
“Yes. I just want you to feel safe.”
John and Monty walk to Giles’ sister’s house, John had only met her briefly this morning. She was as tall as her brother and had the same smile, maybe a couple of years older than him.
Sighing loudly, Peter relaxes back into his armchair and smiles broadly at Sherlock.
“What about having a sexual relationship?”
Mary McKerrow was a different situation. She threatened to tell everyone what sort of friendship Ossian and I had. She wanted to get married and didn’t care that I didn’t love her. She didn’t want to be a maid, for her it was like winning a prize when she walked in on us kissing. Forgetting to lock doors in the heat of the moment was our downfall.
“So then your Father was born 1947?”
“I have been impotent for a long time. I couldn’t get it up before I saw you and Richard in the kitchen hugging, your hands roaming his back.” Shakily he breathes out.
After some moments when Sherlock’s shock and panic subside he lays his hands on John’s hands and squeezes them a little.
“Why?!”
Intriguing and furiating at the same time. Good storytelling, Jane!
Silver girl is doing a fantastic work.
“That he’s his great grandfather too. His grandfather was Hamish Montgomery’s second son with his second wife.”
He looks pointedly at Sherlock to get an answer. Hesitantly, Sherlock asks, “You know that there’s been a bit of sexual tension between us?”
Even when the tea was ready they remained paired up as before. Sherlock and Giles helped the children eat, and
1964 September/November Hamish asks Jean out on a date.
The young secretary Theo is very nice and obviously finds Sherlock attractive. He’s flirting in a discreet way. Sherlock is surprised at himself because he enjoys the man’s flirtation, and is flirting back. Theo looks like a young Harrison Ford, like in the first Indiana Jones films.
“NO! Of course not! What I meant was that you always go your own way. You don’t follow the norm and you always pull me with you. I always do, trusting you. The only time you haven’t gone with you, both our lives have gone to shit!”
John has already gotten a decent lead, but Sherlock can’t start running before he’s admired John’s back and buttocks for a few seconds.
John felt such sorrow and guilt at that moment, but the consuming feeling was anger. His lifelong friend in life, a consuming anger!
Hastily he leaves John and Rosie through the door.
“John, your beer!” Greg calls and motions for him to come and get it.
“This is important, being with you. Feeling your hand in mine and feeling your fingers on my face. Looking into your eyes.”
John turns to the other man, having a rude answer ready, but then he sees Sherlock’s face. Something in Sherlock’s eyes makes him let go of Rosie.
They’re now only a block from Baker Street.
He turns to his right side, looking for a better way to sleep. But his mind doesn’t give him any rest.
“She had gotten a new dress that day he asked her out. She kept the dress and would take it out to show us how good looking it was. The reason for us existing!”
“What happens if you feel the way you did  with Sebastian Wilkes, and after a very little time he leaves you anyway?”
“Ready to leave the train?” Are the good doctor's first words when he sees Sherlock.
“The beginning of July 1965.”
1970 July, John is conceived.
[Yes. Rosie is napping now so if we’re a bit late it’s because of her.] sent 09.40
John had been frozen in place; his mind had been racing.
Richard had met Sherlock at the door at Baker Street the morning when he came back from Buckie.
Rosie squill when she sees the pancakes and John is forgotten for a moment.
A man who never instigated fights or trouble for other people? A peaceful man?
"It's ok, you know..I.... your past..addictions don't..y'know scare me off" John stammered. Slowly he saw Sherlock's eyes move from the screen until they were staring right into his eyes.
"It's a drugs bust" Greg replied, trying his best to remain calm. His hands gestured around the room to the other officers now continuing what they were doing before john and Sherlock floundered in like a couple of horny teenagers.
John must have felt the same because seconds after he was licking his way into Sherlock's mouth. With the most delicious groans John had ever heard, Sherlock opened his mouth to give John the access he most desperately wanted. It was messy and it was uncoordinated but it was the best kiss both of them had ever had. Filled with passion and need and all kinds of other pent up emotions.
Sherlock's expression never faltered, he just kept watching intensely on what John would do next. Not daring to move less it cause John to move away. Awkwardly the army doctor decided to look to he floor, as if contemplating what fabrics were ingeniously used to create such a pattern.
John leant his head back against the wall, noting the texture of the wallpaper against the back of his head. This moment was just incredible. Standing beside the most gorgeous mad man he had ever met. He had only known him a day and in that time space he had regained that sense of wanting to live. That sense of being useful to the world. To Sherlock.
"Shut up!" He growled, anger filling him because the secret he wanted to keep most hidden from this man was practically painted across the room and there was nothing he could do to cover it up. Stupid sentiment, making him feel things.
"Oh for god sakes, I am clean!" He stated loudly, addressing the whole room of officers.
"Get that unintelligible malformed creature out of my flat before you have to arrest me for braking his nose" Sherlock spat out through gritted teeth, not even turning to bother energy to look at him.
But no! This isn't what Sherlock wanted, he's moving away. He's going to shrug it off! No no no. This can't happen. He actually likes this one and hell be dammed if he's going to let this opportunity be passed on.
All to soon it was over and they exchanged questioning glances. Why was this so awkward! John had snogged plenty of blokes before, he was never this stiff or sweaty. Mentally he wiped his palms against his trousers.
"Graham, get your officers under control or better yet, why don't you all just get out of my flat entirely" Sherlock snapped, sulking off to a corner of the room to try and occupy himself with his laptop.
"That wasn't just me" John chimed, his voice raspy from the intake of fresh air. He hadn't ran like that in ages. Feeling the wind trying to desperately push against him, but continuing to prevail. The feel of the blood pumping through his  veins. The feeling of being alive!
From that night John would say that the most beautiful part of Sherlock would definitely be the face he makes when he's thinking. He looks so interested in something no one else can see. The functions of his mind can be seen working and working to try and bring sense to his predicament. But John really loves the most is when he has solved his puzzle and will burst forth with his solution, with a smile of utter confidence and pride.
He couldn't do this! This was ludicrous. He's only known the man ten seconds and he had already made it spectacularly clear that he isn't interested.
The moment Sherlock had set foot inside the door he was being pushed up against the wall. Being assaulted with a barrage of kisses, eyes closed, allowing one another to just feel the carnal desire charged with every sweep of their tongues.
"John you may want to shut up now" Sherlock whispered into his ear, there shoulders brushing ever so slightly.
Abruptly they pulled apart for air, gasping like fish out of water their chest's heaved.
"Oh this is ridiculous, you can't just barge in here!"
Once again they found themselves mouth to mouth except this time, hands began to roam as both became more confident. Sherlock's hands planted themselves on John's shoulders, grounding himself against him. John on the other hand instinctively went if the hips. Squeezing with varying amounts of pressure, looking for the right spot to make the man  before him putty in his hands.
Meanwhile John had slipped over into the corner to try and comfort Sherlock. He edged close to him but not too close, he still isn't too sure how this brilliant unpredictable man would react.
"What?" Sherlock questioned. John stared at him longingly. This man was so beautiful and out of this world it was simply unbelievable.
"Again?" Sherlock asked, a little bit too loudly. His voice saturated in hope. He looked so innocent in that moment, like a virgin touched for the very first time- to quote Madonna.
Sherlock surged forward to be in the centre of the room to give forth his solution. John just watched from the sidelines, perfectly content knowing he is going to be very happy living with this mad man in the flat of 221B.
"Yeah......do you want to try.."
Anderson made a small noise of disgruntlement before placing his empty evidence bag on the counter.
"I don't mind" he choked out, his gaze fixed upon John's eyes. Silently pleading for more. He needed more. Good lord how he needed more. This was insane, never had he wanted to share another man's embrace than he did with John Watson. "Please"
"Bedroom?" John inquired. God this was going fast, he barely knows the man. This can't be happening.
They were getting close now, the bedroom was just a hall way away. So caught up in there haze of nonsensical passion that neither noticed the door opening far too easily when their bodies pushed against it. All they cared about was getting these clothes off and drawing pleasure from one another's bodies.
The taller man made an almost inaudible whimper at the loss of contact, his eyes looking so unsure. It was pitiful.
"...really?" The taller man asked quietly, his face taking up that pure look of innocence once again. It made John's heart flutter, to see him, this man that could so confidently read his whole life story from him, look so unsure.
Sherlock was first to regain brain function, pulling away from that disaster of a first kiss. Embarrassed they both stared at each other, blush tinting there faces hilarious shades of red. Eyes shifting back and forth between one another, waiting for someone to say something. Anything!
Sherlock was also a fast learner and began to join in with using his tongue. Recording and cataloging the best ways to raise the most wonderful noises from John. Turns out he has a very sensitive part behind his left ear that when stroked causes him to groan while involuntary bucking his hips, pressing his arousal harder against Sherlock's pelvis.
"THE PHONE! Oh you are brilliant!" He cheered before grasping both sides of John's head and pull him forward for a brief kiss.
"The what? The phone?" Greg asked from behind them.
Greg looked up at Sherlock, seeing the seriousness in his glare.
That did it. John was completely smitten with this man and needed to take him to bed right now. Instantly, the army doctor was pressing the detective against the wall. Hands tangling in those magnificent curls to pull him into a glorious kiss. Sherlock melted into John's touch instantly, his skin felt like it was on fire and the space in his pants began to grow tighter.
"John?" Sherlock's baritone voice broke his thoughts like a prince braking a long, hazardous curse. John's gaze latched onto those resplendent sapphire blue eyes, his breath quickening and before he could register what he was doing he was leaning in.
And who was John to deny him anything?
That was definitely a mood killer.
"You can't be serious, this guy a drug addict" John inquired, his voice filled with disbelief.
"What in gods name are you doing here? What is this?" He screamed as he stormed into the middle of the room to address Lestrade. Trying as quickly as possible to button up his shirt to regain some decency.
But what he saw when he opened his eyes was not the beautiful scene of John Watson trying to undress him in the private confines of his flat. What he saw was a very stunned Lestrade sitting in his chair. As well as half of Scotland Yard ogling the pair.
"And you can't withhold evidence"
Sherlock froze, his eyes wide in shock. Sensing the Sherlock's change in mood due to the hands in his hair going very still and everything going very quiet, John pulled away only to see that they weren't alone. Awkwardly john retracted his body from Sherlock, quietly standing beside him whilst trying to will away his still very hopeful erection.
That evening after that session, Sherlock put Rosie to bed and made two cups of tea before sitting down on the couch. “John, I’ve something to discuss with you that Darin suggested we try, to make our life better.”
“Go! Have a fun night out. You haven’t been out socially without Rosie for a long time. Your period of mourning is over now. Try to move on, John. Date again. I’ve realized at last that even I must move on. Good luck with the ladies, John.” Sherlock gives John a sad smile and turns back to Richard and starts to talk with him.
John burst out in a giggle, and Sherlock turns his head even more to look at him in the dark. He can’t see John so clearly because tonight rain is making the night very dark.
Sherlock wonders why this is so important for him to write down.
John looks up at him and moves a bit further in on the bed to leave space for Sherlock to lay down. “Of course. Why haven’t you asked me before?”
