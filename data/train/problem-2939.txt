It's a turning point. If he does this now, there's no going back, no pretending it didn't happen. It's more dangerous than jumping off a cliff like he did earlier. Sam waits a moment, retreats within himself. 'Yes,' he thinks, 'no going back. Mine, forever. For all of eternity.' The words spill out of him, granting permission, "Yes." There is no more pausing, no more waiting for clarification. The angels pounce together, carrying him higher and higher into bliss. Sam closes his eyes, lets himself be carried upon the tide of their love for him, and when the time comes, he falls. When he comes back to himself, the angels are right there with him as they had promised they would be, catching him and grounding him.
"I guess I could, if that's what you want. I already have a toothbrush over here, so what's the difference between a toothbrush and some clothes, really?"
"Honey, you're not Lucifer. My ex-husband is Lucifer," Misha whispers to Jensen, who's shoulders start shaking as he laughs.
"Hey, this is Sam on Dean's phone! Dean's on the potty right now!"
Lucifer laughs. "It won't last forever. You'll write to me, right? Often?" He feels uncharacteristically shy asking, but he should let Sam know he's important, and that Lucifer isn't going to forget about him.
"Well Sam was a baby! It's not like he asked to have the demon blood! John, tell me you didn't tell your son to kill his brother."
"You tell him, Sammy."
"There's an Omega in heat upstairs. I'm going to get them."
Sam had to be rather impressed by how well Dean procrastinated when he wanted to. He had turned over and went back to sleep five times this morning. When he finally woke up at nine- which was quite late for a Winchester- they checked out of their motel room and went to breakfast. Somehow, Dean managed to make a meal that typically took thirty minutes into a two hour affair, and he wasn't even flirting with anyone. After that, he drug them into several different curio shops, talking weapons with the owners and admiring various guns and knives. Once his shopping excursion was over and he was walking away with two new silver knives, he drove Baby in the opposite direction of Gabriel's hotel for a solid two hours, until it was late enough that he felt okay to turn around and head back.
"Just a nightmare," he mumbles, voice still heavy with sleep. "Lemme up a minute. Just gotta call Dean real quick."
"And when you come back-"
"Stop saying that!" Lucifer yells.
The cafeteria has been changed, and now looks like an arena with aisles of chairs surrounding it. Dean's standing off to the left of a giant ring, saying something to Cas. He certainly doesn't look worried, leaning forward as he laughs at whatever Cas said. Sam's eyes stay glued to him, taking comfort from the fact that Dean isn't worried.
"For real. Dean gave me a ring."
"I won't stop you," Sam promises.
"I don't know, but the website gives them so I figure they must matter at least a little."
Cas turns back with a confused look as he pulls on the blue and black pair. "Black jeans... which shirt?" He glares at the jeans in his hands like they are personally responsible for the frustration he's experiencing. "I'm not wearing these yet." They get tossed onto the bed. "Do you think blue is good?"
Dean shrugs modestly. "Perhaps you shouldn't have agreed to marry a man with lock-picking skills, then."
"Okay, Cas, it's time to push again, okay?"
"No," the bartender calls. She comes back out, gawking at Cas openly now. "My gosh, you look so much like your brother!"
"You talked to my parents?"
"What do you want to know? I think I speak for all of us when I say we'll answer just about any question you've got," Bobby begins.
"John and I can take defense of the flag too," Mary volunteers.
"Right. That's what I thought."
Sam nods. He notices what Michael doesn't though, that Dean's gaze is finally locked on something rather than staring vacantly into space as it had been. Sam has no doubt that he heard Michael say that he is one of the only people who is able to open Heaven. In the next second Dean's gaze is back to being vacant, and Sam almost screams in frustration. He looks back to Michael, who is looking at him as though he's expecting a response. "I understand, my Lord," Sam says, bowing respectfully. He turns his back on the archangel and stalks out of the throne room.
"Spoilsport," Dean whines.
"You're marrying a Winchester. What does THAT say about your mental well-being?"
"How old?"
"We're getting married. You kissed me, you WILL NOT go flirt with another woman now. That's rude."
"Father in Heaven," Lucifer mutters. "I can't- you're so beautiful, Sam. Your soul isn't twisted at all, and it never will twist. It's pure, it looks like Dean's did as 'the Righteous Man' actually. I can't imagine- there is no part of me that can fathom that you are mine. You are so perfect. Beautiful. Breathtaking. Awe-inspiring. Exquisite. Astonishing. I thought I was irredeemable, but to see you is to see my Father's forgiveness."
"Move, Gabriel. You're in Sam's way if he needs to hit me again."
"Oh. My. God. Lucifer, he's a baby!"
"Her child ran away and jumped on a plane, wouldn't you be mad?"
"Lawrence."
"Did we date?"
"Wait!"Lilith screams as she glances down at her phone, "Everybody quiet! Lucifer's calling!"
Cas pops back into existence directly in front of Sam. "What?" he replies.
Sam is 16
Lucifer moves in to touch him, so Sam leaps away. "Have you met my mother?" he babbles. "Mom, this is Lucifer, Lucifer, this is my mom."
He breezes through the door and sits down to dinner again, and it's only when Gabriel stops eating to gape at him that he remembers he's just been in a fight, and is probably covered in blood. Within minutes he's upstairs in the shower, then when the water runs clear instead of rust-colored he's toweled off and back in his chair, dressed completely. It's only when glancing around the table that he realizes with a start that Sam has now joined them. And while it's certainly not unusual for Dean to end up at their house, Sam typically doesn't join him. Plus, neither Dean or Cas are at the table, which means they're over at the Winchesters, which means Sam came over by himself, which is even more unusual.
"Yes you do," Lucifer agrees. "You've got an hour and a half," he decides with a pointed glance at his watch.
"It is, but that's how it works," Lilith says.
"Did I know that my brother, the same one I have lived with all my life, except a few short months of playing normal at Stanford, is deathly afraid of flying? Nope. Never came up," Sam says sarcastically.
"Okay. After all, we're going to get married some day, and then you'll drive a real car like this."
"That's your other baby saying hi. Congratulations you two, you're having twins."
"How unusual," Crowley drawls.
"You sure? It's going to be a long day with the wedding, so you might need something."
Sam reaches back and touches Gabriel's hand, squeezing once for strength before dropping it. "You cannot have Castiel. And you will not harm my parents."
Lucifer stops with his hand outstretched toward his fiance. He withdraws, both hands down at his sides now so Sam realizes he's not planning to attack. "It's really me," he insists.
"Dean told me what?"
"Exactly a month from now."
"He looked so confused!"
"Why didn't you?" He's curious to know the answer.
"Adam?" Sam hears his father ask. Both boys turn together, watching John cautiously now. "I didn't expect to see you here, I did everything possible to keep you away from this life."
"Sure you can. And you should, so he can help relax you. Without freaking you out completely, there's totally ways Alphas can help stretch you. And lube. Lots of lube, especially if you're doing it- him- outside of your heat. Trust me on this one."
"Why the long face?"
"I'll guard the flag with Balthazar," Gabriel offers. Sam hands off the flag.
"I DON'T LIKE HEIGHTS!"
"No! He has to choose us, Gabriel! Forcing him is useless."
There's senior pictures of three boys: both Winchesters and Cas. Dean's picture is him in a green flannel and jeans, leaning against Baby with a lazy smirk. In his hands he's holding a wrench. To the left of his picture there's a picture of Sam, dressed in a black button-up and dark pants, holding a gavel with a mock-serious expression. His hazel eyes are sparkling, belying his stern expression. To the right of Dean's picture is Castiel, dressed head to toe in navy blue scrubs, stethoscope stretched between his fingers and held behind his head. He's got a slight twist on his lips, like he's trying hard not to laugh. Beneath those three pictures there's one more: Dean and Cas, both in black graduation gowns clutching diplomas, heads thrown back as they laugh at something together. The empty space to the right is clearly for one on Sam's graduation day.
Sam exhales in relief. "Just wanted to be sure you were okay."
Sam takes the stand, bouncing anxiously as a way to quell the nervous energy coursing through him. His opposing lawyer hasn't arrived yet, and their debate starts now.
"Out in the Garden with Joshua and Chuck."
All three of them perk up at that. "What kind of answers?" Balthazar asks.
"You didn't care! You abandoned us! You wanted me dead!"
To his surprise, it's not Mary but John who picks up the phone. "Hey. Sam's asleep, I was going to let him stay over tonight."
"You were better off without me. So was she."
"What is Wincestiel?"
They both don't see Cas glare at them for a moment before he settles down again. Michael doesn't have the same response, he continues to glare.
"Okay, fine. So any older brother Hunter would have left the younger alive after a demon blood addiction? Any Hunter brother would have teamed up with Ruby?"
Dean laughs. "I know. It means people who sit there and offer commentary, like Jimmy and Amelia."
"When did I marry you guys before?"
"Do you have any idea of when your visions take place?"
There's a large bed, probably a king or California king, dominating the space. It's got memory foam, some part of Dean notes distantly. He reaches out, touches it, and his hand sinks in. It'll remember him.
"Why would I take offense to that?"
Gabriel let's out a loud war whoop when he sees Sam. "That's my boyfriend!" Then he launches into 'My Boyfriend's Back', which was probably never meant to be sang at the volume Gabriel is currently singing.
Broad-spectrum antibiotics: can fight off a whole bunch of infections at once
"Wow," the young guy ringing them up says. "That's a lot of cake."
"No, I know. But you're wonderful, you know? You're brilliant, and you're gorgeous, and for some crazy reason Fate thought 'Ah yes, you know who would be good for this beautiful Omega? Dean Winchester.' And whenever I look at you I just realize all over again how lucky I am to have you."
"Well, no, I know. Like, I wouldn't want to talk to Cas about the size of Dean. But like, I have to know. Are knots size proportional? You'd know, you have a mate."
Lucifer shrugs at the demons as though to say, 'What can I do?' and steps over his vessel and his brother. Then he reaches down, grabs both men's shoulders, and physically yanks them into the room with him, jumping around them again to shut the door.
"No kidding?! Which one are you?"
They lay him on the couch. "Sam!" Dean hears Claire gasp. Ben is with her, grabbing her arm as they both stare at him in horror. "What happened? Is he going to be okay?"
"We need to get the ingredients for those angel hex bags that Ruby taught me about!"
Sam's brow furrows as he tries to figure out the hidden meaning behind that message. Lucifer had never...had he? Sam was almost certain he would remember that. He remembers the other forms of torture, so there's no way he wouldn't remember being raped if it had happened. So it hadn't happened. But then why was he supposed to be in bed?
"By Father, you and your brother are stubborn! I'm not asking you to say yes to the Apocalypse, I'm asking you both to become familiar with a new extension of yourselves in order to protect yourselves!"
In response, Gabriel climbs her and shoves his tongue in her mouth. "You love it," he gasps when he pulls away to suck in air desperately.
"I am a gem and any man would be lucky to have me, and that includes you, Sammy."
"Thank you. Come on, we're going to eat now that Sam is finally here. Sam, you and Adam in the backseat, you too Dad. Mom's sitting up front."
Chuck doesn't respond to that at all. "Sit down, Lucifer."
"Great, where are we starting?"
"It's beautiful."
"I know, I know. And yes, your suspicions are correct- I did in fact suggest rigorous sex so that I could leave without you realizing."
As he comes back inside, he can hear his own voice arguing with Ruby. "I thought you said you weren't coming until later," not-Sam says.
There's the sharp sound of Mary's scream before it cuts off. Sam's hand twists, so that instead of the hellfire blasting toward his mother it's all directed internally. His screams pierce the air, two separate voices of the dark cloud entity and him wailing their pain together. Sam doesn't let up though. Even though he's screaming in pain, his hand stays fixed on his torso, blasting the fire into him.
Sam sighs, turning toward Cas with a strange look on his face. "I'm sorry. I wanted to get to know them, because I can't remember them, but I didn't want to be coddled or pitied. So I snuck out of Lucifer's house and climbed the tree and jumped in through the window. You should probably latch the window, by the way."
"Ew! Did not need to know that!"
He dreads heading back to the hotel, but begrudgingly does it anyway. It's a simple matter to hide beneath the stairwell with his paper, spreading it out curiously.
"What are you talking about?"
Lucifer guides Sam down to the front, seating him next to Gabriel. "Remember, there's nothing to worry about. Dean's going to be fine," he reminds Sam, echoing Michael's words from the night before.
Dean lurches them to a halt, nearly enough to throw Sam off the trolley, and he tumbles off still laughing. "That was the best! C'mon, Cas, Dean and I will push you together."
"Cas and I can watch Sammy, if you and Lucifer need to host more meetings to prevent civil war," Gabriel offers to Michael.
"How do you know we're not ready? We might be," Dean argues. Mary sighs, realizing she's lost her logical approach with her eldest. Now he's just going to argue with everything she says.
"Balthazar, Crowley, and Bobby," Chuck lists, and Dean snorts.
Cas responds immediately, blazing into the room, dragging Dean behind him. "Sam, what's wrong? Are you hurt?" he asks as he drops Dean's hand to fawn over Sam. Michael pops into existence a split second behind them, uncalled but obviously having figured out where they went.
"I remember! Cas, I remember that! I don't remember why we were at Stanford, but I remember the swans. And Dean- Dean kept telling everyone I had a crush on Lucifer, and he said...I can't remember what he said. I have to go ask, I have to go find out. I remember that! Woo!"
"Or I could take the coward's way out and fake sick until it's time to leave."
"I told you, he doesn't want to get mated yet. He wants to get to know me better."
Jensen looks up blandly. "Cas. We talked about this. Personal space?" he prompts.
"Michael? We're going to get married," Cas announces.
He yanks Lucifer in after him, and together the men seal Hell again. Sam turns and Lucifer just barely feels him jump, and only because he's still holding onto Sam's arm. There's a crowd of demons surrounding them, led by a redhead Lucifer remembers creating- one of his own Knights of Hell. He searches through his memory for her name, and finally finds it. "Abbadon."
"You have to, buddy," John says, taking Dean from his wife. "See, it's a good thing. That means Lucifer will be able to help you keep Sammy safe."
"Get out of my body, you son of a b***h. There's your final one-tenth. I've got possession of my own body again," Lucifer complains in Sam's voice, then collapses.
"Mom and Dad brought us," Dean explains. "They dropped us off last night."
Balthazar steps inside, instantly feeling like he's been transported back in time. The Winchester house has hardly changed in the time he's been gone, just a couple new pictures he doesn't recognize. He leans down to check them out.
"Sam, you all right?" Michael interrupts the start of his panicked thoughts to ask.
Sam woke with a gasp, staring around the room slightly disoriented. He's almost surprised to find that Dean isn't bleeding out from a sword wound somewhere inside the room.
"I know. I'm not your idea of an all-mighty being."
Dean pulls away. "I'm going to die more often if this is the greeting I get when I come back," quips Dean.
"You're probably hungry. I'll go get you some snacks. What do you want?"
"Must be an awfully long walk, if it takes twelve hours!"
Both people wait a minute but when Cas doesn't respond Dean says, "He'll take the Swiss Mushroom burger with fries."
"No, I'm not."
"I was thinking that maybe I'd go back to Stanford."
Cas shrugs, fingers still in his mouth.
"You're welcome," Sam snaps, watching Lucifer. "Gabriel? What's with your brother?"
"Dearly beloved, we are gathered here today to witness the marriage between the three elected to be liaisons and ambassadors to Earth on behalf of the holy ground of Heaven and the unholy terror of Hell. Bobby Singer, my son Balthazar, and Crowley, King of the Crossroads, and later, King of Hell," Chuck says. "If anyone knows of any reason why these three should not be bound in holy matrimony, speak now or hold your peace for the rest of eternity."
Raphael is drug to the door. "Get out," Uriel orders. The door slams and Uriel is alone. He inhales in relief, sucking in the scent of his baby brother in heat. Well, not so much a baby now, is he? Cassie's hit his heat, something even Gabriel hasn't done yet.
"Lucifer! Balthazar! Uriel!" Gabe bellows, slamming the door of their house.
Lucifer and Balthazar are 27
Sam turns to watch the employee come out from the kitchen. "You all need anything?"
He realizes it's breakfast time, so he curiously checks the dining room. If his room is empty...
"I'll build the house, we'll show you tomorrow. Anything you don't like, we can fix easily. I can do all of the furnishings and stuff too. Oh, and Michael wants to get some wedding planning done tomorrow, so be sure you don't go to bed too late."
"Three more fights? Apiece?"
"I'm here, Sam. What do you want to talk about?"
"That's impossible, we were dancing together and I was with him and my drink both here at the table before that! He had no capability of putting that drug in my drink without me noticing!"
"Are we going to talk about this?" Lucifer inquires. "Sam?"
"Hello?"
"Well, if you two are comfortable, I'll get back to hunting for a nice area for a house," Lucifer offers. "Any particular region of the world you're partial to, Sam?"
Dr. Prescott's gaze snaps up to him, then he barks, "Dr. Winchester, go get Dr. Blake instead. Tell her to scrub up, you can't be a part of this one. Go help with the other victims that are coming in. And page L&D."
"One final thing Sam. My greatest fear. If I haven't come back yet, then the fear god knows I'm onto him and I'm being held somewhere. My greatest fear is that my family won't come for me. Good luck." The screen cuts to snowy static, and Sam leans back against the couch. They're in grave danger, and in a split second, he knows what he has to do. 'Lucifer, I need you. Come alone.'
Lucifer nods over to the house next door. "Winchester."
Michael's apartment looks okay from the outside. It's nothing spectacular, but it's not a permanent home either. He reaches out and pounds on the door. No response.
"Friend, no," Chuck answers, "husband, yes."
"Well, maybe I could be like a second Alpha for you. Like, I could help protect the house when your husband isn't home!" suggests Lucifer, bouncing on his toes excitedly.
"We do, I promise. I've been saving my tip money from bartending. And apparently my parents had a college fund for me that they're dedicating to this instead. So come on. You deserve this- no, you deserve the world, but I want to start with this."
"If the problem is safety, why don't Dean and I go too?" suggests Cas. "We can stay with him, and if you're not comfortable with a hotel, we can ask to stay with Michael for the weekend. I'm sure he'd accommodate."
"I see," Crowley murmurs.
"Winchester? I don't have a Winchester. I have a Cas-teal Novak."
"Why? I'm not following."
Sam leads the way, ensuring that they don't end up in the one he's familiar with. It's enough to re-live Gabriel's death once.
"Hello, students, and welcome to the first day of the rest of your life. I know many students don't have to do this, but I want to know a tiny bit about all of you. I want you to start with your name, designation, and why you chose to become a doctor."
Ben snaps out of it, leading Claire into the dining room. John gapes at him as he leaves, though he doesn't notice it. "Dean-"
"I told him I loved him," Lucifer adds.
Gabriel moans as Kali bites his neck. His phone vibrates on the nightstand, but he ignores it. "God, yeah. Do that again."
"Well that's very concerning. I'll talk to him about it."
"Mike called. It's been almost a year since… The trial is coming up."
"Well, short of asking him to measure and buying toys to find out if you can take him- or trying to measure him yourself, which I do not recommend- I'm not sure what you want me to say here."
Lucifer turns and hobbles out the door. "Hey! Luce! Do you wanna drive?" Lucifer is already hobbling down the sidewalk, but Michael catches up within a couple seconds."Get in the car, Luce! Use your head here! I know you're worried about your twin, but you need to work with me here."
"I don't want one," repeats Dean. "I'm fine living in motel rooms all the time."
Crowley comes in with a flourish just as the alarm starts going off. "This had better be important, Moose," he grouses.
"Come on, Dad. I did most of the raising Sammy job, and we both know it."
Sam frowns at that, looking back and forth between them. "What changes are you guys undergoing, if you don't mind my asking?"
"Bluebells." Dean turns to listen to the music, cocking his head as Cas does when he's confused. "Dance with me?"
"Wait. Really, Mom? You took on an angel?" Dean asks, sounding impressed.
"Dean was planning to hide out in Baby and invited me to join him too. We can both join, if he'll let us."
"There's no ice in your dispenser,"
.........................................................................................
Sam groans. "Gabriel, I can't just say that!"
"Were we happy?"
"No."
"What's a Tumblr?" Cas asks, but nobody answers.
Green eyes roll dramatically. "Which of you is the adult, as you're always so fond of reminding me?"
Dean is alone in his room for once when Mary comes knocking at his door. He's working on homework, but Mary's visit promises a distraction.
Sam's face goes red, and he scrambles off Lucifer. He pulls his fiance to his feet. Lucifer grabs him before he can pull away, tucking Sam's arm in his. "Don't pull away from me, please. I can see you're already beginning," he requests, words for the two of them only.
"Yes sir," agrees Sam, grabbing a plate to throw pizza on it for himself. He doesn't miss Dean's snort, but he prays his Dad does.
Dean sounds defeated when he answers, "He's not."
"Who gives this Omega's hand in marriage?" Michael asks as they stop inches from the rest of the wedding party.
Gabriel pushes Lucifer off of him. "I think-" he pushes Lucifer again as Lucifer tries to climb back onto him, "Sam's feeling jealous."
Uriel is 26
"You wanted to kiss me?"
Dean closes his textbook, algebra abandoned for the moment. He pats the bed, and Mary comes to sit with him. "What's up?"
"We don't have time," Dean snaps back. "We're getting married in..." his voice trails off, because Chuck never actually told them when they were going to get married.
"Maybe you should. That way you can feel him out. And barring that, just do us all a favor and move out with him."
"Crowley? Will it even work?"
Gabriel saunters over to the bathroom, stripping his clothes off on the way. He's sashaying his hips, but the effort is completely wasted because Sam is facing the other way pulling on jeans.
"You died several years ago," Sam says. "We accidentally got sent to your world by Balthazar, and you were killed by an angel!"
"Thanks, I guess," Cas decides.
Cas tries to argue, but Lucifer has already hung up. So instead he stalks back over to the Winchester's, ready to talk Sam through his first heat.
"I couldn't. Your mom was starting to resent me, I told you that."
Sam hears his voice and jerks violently. "He'll hurt me!" he whispers frantically to Dean.
"Sam Winchester, tell me you didn't come all the way down here, into the Cage, dragging my very human brother with me, so that you could come charging in here with no plan!"
With no time to spare, he drops to the plush carpet and rolls beneath the bed, clutching the laptop and blanket combo to him.
"Cassie is in heat? Is he okay? Is Dean there? Are Mom and Dad with him? Where were you? Why didn't you pick up the phone?"
The doctor's hard brown eyes fix on the professor. "I am only taking one student," he says in a clipped angry tone. "Which is it?"
"What did you just say?" Dean asks as he turns.
Sam, on the other hand, is very pale. "Unfortunately that makes sense."
................................................................................................
"Okay. Did we kiss?"
"Yes, yes, yours," Sam responds. He rubs his neck up against Lucifer, and Lucifer knows without the shadow of a doubt that if he doesn't put Sam down now they're going to end up mated tonight. He's waited so long, and he can't. Not now. Not when he's so close to being graduated.
"No. You found out a few years ago. We didn't do anything about it until I moved back here a few months ago. Then we started dating."
Michael's face falls quickly. "I can't do it."
"And I told you why I want to stop you."
"He wanted your brother to kill you. That alone is grounds for being sent to Hell. To say nothing of the multiple times he hit you or your brother, the times he left you without money, the times-"
Michael turns toward Sam now, face incandescent with fury and eyes alight in an odd way that Michael's never are. "Fine. New plan." He waves his arms and the grace wall reinforces, and just in time- Lucifer and Gabriel have finally realized something is wrong and are trying to help. With Michael's addition, they won't be able to.
"And I do as well," Michael finished. "Dearly beloved, we are gathered here today..."
Sam reaches for him and shivers as they make contact. "You feel gloriously cold. Can you cuddle me?"
Cas sets off to find a nurse. Mary goes with him, to tell them that they can actually give Cas the information. After a few minutes, Cas is back. "They're saying his oxygen rates are holding steady, they're hoping they can wean him off the ventilator soon."
"I'll take offense too. Dean will most likely let Azazel guard the flag with Lilith, and I can distract them," Crowley decides.
"You're freaking out? How do you think I feel?"
"We don't know what Sam is. We had no idea what he would be capable of, but based on that display he is significantly stronger than we ever dreamed," Gabriel says, with a fond smile directed to the unconscious man. "Dean, what your brother did was unprecedented.
"What do you think?"
"You mistreat my son and I'll kill you myself, you understand me? I don't care if you're the devil or not."
"This thing preys on your worst fears. The more people we take, the more people have to fight their fears, and the more potential we have for things to go wrong."
"Are you back for good, now?" Cas asks uncertainly.
"He's burning up," Dean says.
"How's it going now that the baby is here?"
"You are completely useless."
"Mom."
Lucifer ignores her. He has nothing to say. He's still watching Sam, and barely bites back a growl when he sees a blonde girl with her arm around Sam.
"No!"
Lucifer kicks the door lightly once he gets to their room, and Gabriel yanks it open. "Sam?" he questions, alarmed, but when Lucifer places a finger to his lips he hushes.
"Stop it, both of you stop!" Sam orders. "It's no big deal."
"Really, Dean? I knew you were into him before I died! Why do you think I refused to sleep with you?"
Azazel announces his plans to test Sam, to draw him back into hunting. He doesn't discuss methods, and Lucifer doesn't ask. He agrees to whatever Azazel thinks best, and Sam knows he's getting into the parts of his life he remembers most. After this, Jess will be dead and he throws himself back into hunting.
"No," Sam says decisively. No need to bring up bad memories.
The waitress has the audacity to wink at him. "I'm certain I don't know what you're talking about."
"One of each."
"Demon, Michael. Singular."
Downstairs, Dean is pacing an agitated circle, new wings fluttering anxiously behind him. He can't control his wings right now, he's too upset, and it's fairly obvious. Cas is standing nearby, frown etched deeply into his mouth. Lucifer enters the room, shutting the door tightly behind him. "What the h*ll was that?" he asks grumpily.
"They did," Cas confirms, wondering how long he can drag this out for. "You might not know them though, they slipped under the radar."
Sam's whole world crashes down around him. He smacks back into Earth like Icarus, crushed to his core. Lucifer didn't want to kiss him.
Dean crosses his arms, glaring back at Sam again. "You're just saying that so I feel better."
Sam's already up, leaping the grace barrier as Michael kicks Dean back into the wall. Dean literally goes through it, leaving a hole in the drywall. Sam catches Michael in the side, barreling into him in sheer desperation.
"Obviously. Not like we need to do it again."
Sam's sitting in his room writing an essay when Mary knocks on his door. "Come in!" He leans back in the chair, stretching his prepubescent body out as he flexes his arms behind his head. "What's up, Mom?"
"No, Dean, you can't," Lucifer argues, "you don't have the grace. Trust me, I can see it."
Cas shrugs, fingers still in his mouth. He sits next to Dean and reaches for the Impala.
"What do we do now?"
"I wouldn't want him to relocate. Besides, I'm planning to come back to this area again someday, so it kinda seems pointless to leave for college. I figure I can leave after college, and take some neat trips around the world and all that."
There's a loud thud, then, "But do you think Dean will care?"
"I'm sorry. You're right, it's not. I just think it's sweet of you."
"No," Rowena says slowly, glancing to Lucifer as she answers. He's sitting there staring at Sam like the boy hung the moon in the sky.
He leans in for a deep tongue-curling soul-melding kiss. Then another. And then Claire cries. Cas pulls away with a frustrated mewl. "We could ignore her?" he suggests.
U: 'No.'
"Good strong name for a boy, I like it," Chuck says. "And Claire is a good name as well."
"Not tonight."
Sam wraps his fingers around the handle. "Thanks."
It's a simple matter to head back to the old apartment and let himself in, hellhounds tumbling with him. It's been repaired since the fire, and Sam doesn't recognize the wall color. He wanders it for a moment, trailing curious fingers over the wall.
"That just means you get double the fun," Sam points out. He watches a tiny smile cross Dean's face, though he tries to scrub it away quickly with his hand.
"Sweetheart, you're crowning."
"He said you weren't ready to hear it then. But now you are."
Anna's hand flies up to stop the blade as Castiel brings it down. She jumps up and the two circle each other, obviously looking for weaknesses.
"None at all."
"We're sure he's not going to hurt Cas?"
Someone's fist hits his face hard, skin giving under his rival's knuckles. That's alright. He doesn't need to look pretty, but he does need to win this fight. Sam is his, and anyone who thinks differently- with the exception of Sam himself- is going to pay.
"I scheduled us for a tour of the medical program here!"
The rest of the night is relaxing. Sam is able to dance with Gabriel, then Lucifer -though they don't do the salsa yet- and Dean. He dances with his mother and father as well, though they stay in safe little squares as they move that are difficult to mess up. Then he has to dance with Balthazar (and only steps on his toes twice, as Balthazar is spinning him around fast enough Sam feels he's ready to vomit), then Bobby and Crowley, and even Lilith, Ruby, and Azazel. Sam is tense during all of these dances, but he relaxes again when the song 'Barbie Girl' comes on and Dean rushes in to grab him so quickly that Azazel literally goes flying away. Dean laughs hysterically as he starts moving like a stripper, grinding awkwardly against Sam. Apparently, all of Dean's watching strippers was great practice for this exact moment.
Sam stares at the spot he vanished from. "He seems...high-strung."
Balthazar drops his gaze suddenly, biting his lip. It's one of his tells. He knows something he thinks Lucifer will be upset about. "Bal?" Lucifer prompts.
"Yeah. Yeah I am. Besides, I couldn't leave my mate alone forever."
"No. Of course not, Dean. But it's like, you've always been my one constant and you're slipping through my fingers like melted butter."
I just got a comment suggesting I put the kid's ages somewhere, so ill put it in an author's note at the start of each chapter
"Don't!" Lucifer barks, hand flying up to stop Cas' words from leaving his lips. "Castiel, the thing that took you preys on your greatest fears. If it knows what you're afraid of, it will come true."
"You don't want me to, though."
"It's not that I don't want to be married," Cas explains, "it's that I'm flummoxed I'm hearing those words out of your mouth."
"We'll help you figure it out," Michael vows, taking Dean's hand again. "But Lucifer is right, you and Sam are certainly not alone."
"Dean says he writes to you."
Sam tries to develop a new plan as he runs. He remembers Gabriel saying that they'll need to overcome their fears, and Sam isn't afraid Lucifer will hurt him. Sam's not, but clearly Lucifer is. He needs a way out of this crazy mess, he needs to take control again. If this thing stays with Lucifer, it might end up that Sam literally dies. But if he gets control back, he can manipulate the ending. The only way to do that, though, is to have more fears than Lucifer. Become prey.
Dean grunts at him around his sandwich, which Sam takes to mean, 'I'm listening, but my mouth is full.'
"You're such a prude, Lucifer."
"Okay but it's still not legal."
Gabriel rolls his eyes. "Trust me, short stuff, I won't. Wouldn't do me any good, anyhow."
"Yeah!"
"Desserts, anyone?" The manager has returned again. Lucifer has hardly touched his plate; hadn't even seen the plates were brought out.
"Except Richard," Misha agrees.
Beside Sam, Dean gets to his feet, brushing Sam off when he tries to yank him back down. "If either of you hurt him, I will kill you."
Sam gives Gabriel a suspicious look. "What did you put in it?"
"Oh!" Cas looks scandalized. "Really?" Dean nods. "I'll be sure to sleep the night before, and go to bed so I can get up early without trouble," he amends to Michael.
Cassie's phone is on the counter nearest the freezer, and Uriel grabs it urgently. In seconds he's phoning Dean.
"I'm sure he'll love it."
A short, startled laugh. "I'm not lying. Just eat your ice cream."
"Cas," Dean replies evenly. "How many times have I told you not to do that?"
"What?"
Then he turns to Lucifer, "Wait. I'm not going to sprout horns, am I?"
"Castiel has a lot of wisdom for being so young."
"Fatherhood! Do you remember that time that we went grocery shopping with Cassie when he was two?"
"Well, I'm sure you remember my ex-boyfriend Alastair?"
"It is. It will be. And whatever's coming for them is waiting for me," Sam realizes.
"Spicy black bean burger. I don't like meat as much as I used to."
"Oh, I'm fine. The morning sickness is over for now, and I'm feeling really good."
The woman at the counter smiles at Cas when he walks over staring at the selections of banners. "Hi there, what can I do for you, handsome?" she asks, dragging a hand up his arm.
Sam, however, pushes Dean away and staggers toward Lucifer. Lucifer catches him, pinning him against the wall as he pulls his shirt off, searching for any bruises that aren't there. Sam's reaching for his shirt, murmuring "I'm okay, Lucifer. I'm okay. Are you?"
"Hey," Sam greets awkwardly as he gets close enough.
The two guys jump him at once, one of them yanking his arms behind his back so he can't fight. The other gets three good jabs at his unprotected kidneys before he throws his head back, knocking the guy hard in the nose. He's sure there's blood in his blonde hair. Again, doesn't matter.
"You'll be killed!"
"Me first," Dean announces. He runs over to the luggage trolley and bounces up on it. "Push me, Sammy!" he orders.
"I empathize with your situation, but there is no medication I can give him to fix this. Gently reorient him, bring pictures of events that he should remember- his graduation, the wedding of your brother and his mate, and maybe a picture of everyone in the family now so he's able to recognize everyone, a journal, if he keeps one. It may help."
When Cas' Mommy finally comes for him hours later, that's how they find the boys. She picks Cas up and takes him home, Cas waking up just enough to know he's with his Mommy before he goes back to sleep. His Mommy and Dean whisper together for a moment, and Cas is invited back again. Then they go home, Cas is tucked into his own bed, and he doesn't move again until early morning when the sun peeks through his curtains.
"No, not really. Some ideas I've already had, but...you can't marry someone if they don't want to be with you."
They're nearly back before Dean exclaims, "This one!" and drags Cas in. It looks okay, clean and not too busy, so Cas allows himself to be taken inside.
Sam's face burns. He's not sure what to do- he and Lucifer have not been intimate- nowhere even close- so it's not like they'll be making use of it tonight. Or any night in the near future, probably. Unless Gabriel knows something Sam doesn't-
"Well, don't tell anyone, okay? Not Mom, not Dad... have you told anyone yet?"
"I do!" Cas hastens to reassure. "Just, maybe not right now."
He has enough time to look up and realize he doesn't recognize the demon's true visage as the demon hurtles toward him. Sam ducks under the swinging knife and pops up, slamming the heel of his hand into the demon's face. The demon reels back, holding its nose.
Sam maneuvers so Gabriel is shoving his brother out of the way and he can walk beside his mother again.
"Aren't you supposed to tell me I'm being ridiculous? I feel like I'm being ridiculous."
Gabriel lands in between them, arms extended.
"It's more complicated than that, but that's the long and short of it." Sam takes the water out to Lucifer, who is just starting to stir.
'Sorry.'
"Hello?"
Sam grimaces. He doesn't know what that means, but he's not entirely sure he wants to find out, either. By the time he looks up again, the demon has disappeared and Meg has stolen the lead. Sam runs right past her, but surprisingly Meg doesn't complain again. Any demon that spots them is lit on fire, until finally they've reached the entrance to Hell and spill out into the sunlight.
"So we're just waiting on Gabriel to get off yet?" Sam asks.
Lucifer is 21
"Sam." Mary places her hand on the chair and spins him around so he's looking at her again. "What's going on? You and Lucifer used to be good friends."
Lucifer takes off then, nearly flying as he hunts Alastair. He fully intends to kill him as he'd threatened, but in order to kill him he has to find him first. It's an easy matter. Alastair and he, while not friends (perish the thought!) seemed to run in the same circles. Lucifer knew exactly where to find him.
"I'm not!" Lucifer declares hotly. "Castiel, fix your boyfriend, there's something wrong with his brain."
"Castiel Winchester, do you know who I am?"
"We're glad you liked it," Gabriel tells him.
"Do you know what gender they are? Are they identical?"
"Shut up, we don't have time. He's working off your worst fears. You're not going to kill me."
"I know. If he would just let me open the gates of Heaven, we could at least go back to Hell, be sure everything is running smoothly, then go look for Gabriel, Castiel, Lilith, and Bobby. I don't like sitting around being useless! I wonder if Raphael would open the gates for me?"
"That's my brothers number!" Cas chides, attention mostly absorbed by the blue screen.
Balthazar has no response. Finally, he comes up with, "Um, what?"
Cas smiles. "That's great, Sam. Hey, I wanted to show you something if you're up for it."
"That sounds like an interesting field of study," remarks Anna.
"C'mon, Bal. We just talked about splitting up for the first time ever. Just sleep with me tonight."
"So, you were finding out who you're interning with today, right?" Dean asks Cas at supper that night.
"Who was it?" Becky questions. "Don't keep us in suspense, sweetie!"
"We need to get to Lucifer's Cage."
"Because your letter made it sound like you were so busy. I didn't think you had time to write to me, and it was distracting you from other, more important stuff."
"I sent them back to their universe. They had a surprise birthday party for Misha that they all needed to be present for."
Uriel falls silent for a moment. "Was that a 'Lord of the Rings' joke?"
"I'm being serious. We're all aware that you'll be itching to join Dean in a fight, especially once he goes up against Michael and it becomes obvious he's going to lose. So it's to keep you out."
"It's too early for the babies to be here anyway, and honestly I'm okay."
"I haven't gotten a letter from him in a while, Mary. I just didn't mention it because I wanted to give him the benefit of the doubt."
Sam frowns and jabs a finger Dean's direction. "Don't you dare tell him."
Dean disappears into the kitchen for a moment, and he appears much more alert by the time he comes back. He's also carrying a bouquet of flowers with him. "Here. I got these for you."
"Speaking of gifts, we should begin research on how to sue. But I have a major test tomorrow, so I can't start tonight. And don't you dare do all the work. In fact, no starting without me."
Balthazar sits down next to Gabriel, setting Castiel down on the ground. Cas crawls into Gabriel's lap, patting his brother's arm and trying to wipe the tears off his face. Balthazar takes the ice that Dean's daddy brought out and wraps it around Gabriel's arm. Cas' eyes well up with tears seeing the wound, but Balthazar doesn't notice.
Dean is already waiting in the Novak's backyard. "He's good," Sam mutters, leaning into Dean as he speaks. The music swells and Sam straightens, watching Gabriel start down the aisle. In keeping with the wedding sixteen years ago, the Novaks are walking down the aisle by themselves, in order from youngest to oldest. All the boys are wearing silver suits. Dean's clad in black, and Cas is in pure white. Once Gabriel hits the end he hugs Dean before taking his place on Cas' side. Uriel is next, then Balthazar. Lucifer follows, winking at Sam after he hugs Dean. Michael rounds out the brothers, stepping past them into the traditional place for the officiant.
Dean watches Lucifer huff out of the room and rolls his eyes. "You've got to be kidding me!" he growls.
Dean shrugs off the comment. "Been practicing," he mumbles.
"Dude! Why haven't we gotten married? If you'll let me sleep with other women...I bet Michael won't let me sleep with other women."
Sam finally gets back to Indiana and goes into the hotel. His eyes are burning as he tries to hold them open for a tiny bit longer. The hellhounds knock him out of the car and onto his face, but thankfully it's early enough no one is around to witness it. He staggers into the hotel tiredly.
In his memory, Lucifer answers the deceased Sam, "You're right where you were always meant to be. But it's not your time. Stay with me for a while, and when you return, fear not, for we shall be reunited in a few years."
Lucifer rests his head against Gabriel's for a moment, breathing deep to stop the tears welling up in his eyes. When he gets himself under control again, he asks, "Where's Sam?"
"Could what?"
"You know?"
"It's fine. Just wasn't expecting that," Cas mellows immediately upon hearing Dean's apologetic tone.
"I hid them with a bit of grace," Cas explains, waving his hands for a moment so that their unconscious bodies become visible. "I knocked them unconscious myself, because it's easier to hide them. Unfortunately, the same is not true for Gabriel. He was like this when I got here. But Sam, there is potential that-"
"Following me. It's annoying."
"Even back then," Lucifer confirms.
He waves his hands so a hotel room bed appears. Dean's laying on it on the left side, Jensen on his right. Then he waves again, and Misha and Jared appear too.
"Boys or girls, boys or girls?" Lucifer calls.
"Oh yeah. Totally," Sam lies automatically.
Once they're out of the shower and Sam is redressed, Dean comes back into the room. Cas leaves with him on the guise of getting ice cream to go talk.
He can hear Lucifer directly behind him but ignores him as he takes deep breaths, slipping into a Dean persona. That's who he knows best, after all, and, best of all, when Sam was a kid he thought Dean was fearless.
"No! We were helping Crowley to look for Rowena!"
The day of Dean's birthday, Charlie arrived early in the day and whisked Dean off with her. Cas doesn't ask for details on where they go. Instead, the second the door closes behind Dean he takes Sam and Kevin to a store called 'Party City.'
"Hi, Michael." Dean greets him, though Sam can't help the fierce jolt of pleasure that runs through him when he realizes his brother isn't looking at Michael, either.
Sam shoves past Dean, who holds the door open wider. "Well in that case, you might as well as come in," he offers magnanimously.
"She always told me it was a guy with a motorcycle, a one-night stand she met at a bar."
Gabriel holds the eye contact and proceeded to stuff three small cupcakes into his mouth. He eats them quickly, getting icing all over his face. To top it off, he drags his fingers through the icing on his face, licking off his fingers with a moan similar to one he used on Casa Erotica.
"Nervous about leaving?"
"Wait. Dean, can you come sleep with me?"
Gabriel laughs. "Seriously, though, I wouldn't mind a romantic relationship. I like you a lot, Sam, and so does Lucifer."
"We need some other hunters to start sacrificing for the greater good," Sam muses.
"Because knowing my brother, I don't think he'll be content to let you sleep in a separate rooms afterward."
"Sorry, but Cas needs this necklace to be shorter. Dean gave him a ring he wants to show off."
"I know it wasn't," Lucifer reassures him, placing a hand over Sam's where it rests on the table and squeezing
"He's a child!"
"Yes."
"To all of you," Michael amends. "I am certain only time will prove I am telling the truth, but I've changed my ways during my time in the Cage."
"Well f**k him."
He can feel the wall once it crumbles, and realizes Lucifer really had been blocking him before. The last resistance crumbles, and Sam can feel everything. He searches through Lucifer's mind, feels his enthusiasm as God announces to the Heavenly Host the need for the true vessels. Can see Lucifer helping to create him, offering God suggestions as Michael leans over his shoulder cracking jokes- and apparently, his long hair was an idea of Michael's- and slapping Michael's hand away, laughing as they create Sam together. He feels the rejection and abandonment of the Fall, and collapses back onto the bed with the pain or Lucifer's suffering. Sam had never stopped to consider how much it would have hurt, to be cast out by his brother. The pain sends him reeling, and he feels Lucifer stop and try to awkwardly fast-forward his own memories.
"It's a talent. No seriously, though, listen to me. And this is serious. You need to talk to him about this."
"Quiet!" Uriel barks, knocking on their shared wall, and Lucifer and Balthazar have to smother frantic laughter into their pillows.
"What's wrong?" Dean demands the second Mary's footsteps fade away down the stairs.
Sam grabs a pillow and smacks him with it. "You are not taking this seriously!"
Dean seems to take that as some sort of sign, because he starts walking faster until he's up in Cas' personal space, Cas moving out to meet him. They collide, Dean knocking Cas off his feet so they're both laying in the dirt. Cas rolls, trying to gain control, and then their mouths meet. They kiss like they're trying to consume each other, a tiny distant part of Sam's brain notes. He stares at his brother and his angel friend, who are still rolling around on the ground trying to eat one another. He opens his mouth and can't think of anything appropriate to say. His mouth closes again. "Finally," he breathes out.
"Yes. And for your friend?"
"That's wonderful!"
Sam clicks the safety off the gun. "Where's Adam?"
"Dean. I'm a mechanic, and I bartend."
"Yeah, of course. That it?"
"I mean, no, I really shouldn't. I'm very tired, and you've got a child to watch. I should, um, I should go."
"I feel like I'm losing you," Sam confesses, "both of you. And I don't like it."
"Let's take down the demons," Lucifer whispers to Sam quietly. Sam nods, pulling a bowl of strawberries toward him. A wicked smirk, and Lucifer is snapping his fingers to create huge green smoothie cups like Sam had. Sam abandons his strawberries in favor of the smoothies.
"Now you can look," Balthazar corrects. Sam glances at Lucifer, who gives a nearly imperceptible nod to confirm his twin's telling the truth. Sam drops his hand. Balthazar is dressed again in the grey suit pants he wore at the wedding, still shirtless, with a frustrated expression on his face. "Seriously, don't you two knock?"
"Yay, 'As!" Then he turns to Dean with his arms spread out, yelling, "Bean! Bean!" Dean takes him, tossing him up in the air and making him squeal with joy.
"You had no right to go prying around in my head!"
"Cassie?"
"Um, I guess?" Sam answers questioningly.
There's a loud crashing sound to Sam's right, and he jumps. Dean took a bottle of beer and threw it across the room. John's standing next to him, leaving Sam no doubt that their father offered Dean the alcohol as a way of coping with his missing spouse. Dean throws another bottle and another, squeezing a fourth until it shatters in his hand, and when that doesn't seem to help him he grabs the whole table of expensive drinks and upends it. Beer, steak, lobster, salad, dressings, and dips cover the whole room overtop the glass. Dean stands in the middle of the mess, chest heaving, uncaring of the blood dripping from his hand. "I am coming for you Cas, I promise."
Something must happen that Sam misses, because Cas has Anna on her knees now, angel blade to her throat. They stare at each other for a moment, and Cas reaches to help her up. Anna trots off, head held high with dignity, and Sam lets out a breath he didn't realize he was holding. Cas looks fine, no blood or oozing grace to speak of.
"He didn't, relax. You're not exactly quiet during your heats, if you get my drift," Dean explains.
"Perhaps we should take this inside," Cas interrupts. "Mary, can I grab your bags?"
He doesn't look around, which gives Sam plenty of time to gawk at him. The years have been kind to him in a way that Sam thinks just isn't fair. His hair has grown a bit shaggier, tousled neatly into blonde spikes that jut from his forehead. It looks soft; Sam clenches his first by his side lest he go over and run his fingers through it. He's possibly taller than he was when he left five years ago. He's definitely more muscular, teenage body hardening into something that's all man.
Sam cracks his neck and looks around with a pleased smile. "Beautiful. I like this one better than the last. Let me just see-" his voice trails off a moment, then resumes. "Of course. Thank you, that's brilliant!"
"You want to go to him?" Michael sets the baby down and he toddles off toward Cas determinedly. Just before he gets there, he wobbles and nearly falls. Cas snags him before he can hit the ground, lifting him up with a "You did it! Yay!"
Dean frowns. "When did you meet my dad, Cas?"
There's one other patron in the building, and he swivels to stare at them as they walk in. Cas ignores him, yet he still presses closer to Dean.
Lucifer is hurt. He's not saying anything, but it's obvious. Ever since Sam's smart remark to the manager about 'thanks for the ice cream, not so much for the advice' in response to him telling them they should date, Lucifer's been really quiet.
He finally-painfully- tears his gaze away from Sam and over the water. "I used to come read your letters here," he confesses.
"You still haven't told him?"
Lucifer and Balthazar are 26
"No, no, no, I'm sure this is fine," Sam says unconvincingly. He swings himself into the Cage, Lucifer following him. As soon as Lucifer's feet hit the inside, the Cage door swings closed behind them.
Lucifer reaches down and yanks Gabriel up, catching him before he overbalances and falls back on his face. "Alright, good enough. Let's go!"
"Back up, when did you get married?"
"It shouldn't have been. Sam has evidently grown much stronger than we realized. He hasn't learned how to control his hellfire, hasn't bothered learning how to act like a demon... Basically, he's acting off of instinct. It's a good sign for Gabriel and I that he's this strong this quickly, but I don't imagine it makes him happy to know he's done yet another monster thing."
Chapped fingers get pulled out of his mouth. "Castiel."
Balthazar and Lucifer run together to their fence, where Gabriel's voice had come from. Gabriel is in the neighbor's yard, and has fallen into their glass table and broken it. He's bleeding, and that's why he was yelling. The door slams, and a man who is probably Dean's father sits on the ground next to him, holding a towel to Gabriel's bleeding arm. "Where'd you come from, buddy?"
"Wait, you didn't tell me anything about you!" protests Lucifer. He's walking home now, and sees Lilith out front of the bar sweeping off the door mat. They both wave to each other and he continues on.
"His mother and I," Chuck replies.
"I'm sorry, Dad. Really. It won't happen again."
"Oh, come on!"
"Don't let him push you around," advises Cas.
"Dude, they've been having that since I still lived there a year ago!"
"What about him?" Cas asks in his gravelly voice from directly in front of them.
"Crowley. You look...no different than usual."
Dead-Sam vanishes before he can answer, and Lucifer's memory of himself chuckles. "Even now, you've become a thorn in my side, Vessel of Michael," he addresses the ceiling.
Cas laughs. "Okay. I'll see you when I get home."
He first met the boy that was his age at the park. Dean was in the sandpit making his toy Impala drive round a castle with obnoxious car noises. He looked up and the boy from next door was standing there, fingers in his mouth as he watched Dean play.
"Yes. Yes we are," Mary answers. "My name is Mary, and this is my husband, John."
There's unrestrained glee when Lucifer finally steps free of the Cage. Sam feels his shock as he searches for him and doesn't find him, and then he goes after Nick. Automatically, Sam can see the difference between Lucifer's chasing after him and chasing after Nick. It's true, Lucifer had offered not to harm his family, to resurrect them. And though he offered Nick the same, and appeared as Nick's wife in much the same way he appeared as Jess, he had not terrorized Sam as he did Nick. Sam feels a sudden flash of guilt toward Nick. Perhaps, if Lucifer had appeared to him in the same way, he would have said yes a lot sooner.
"Gabe-"
"No problem. C'mon, Sam, Crowley. Let's let the newly-mated couple in peace."
"We both didn't want to wait," Balthazar corrects, and he leans forward to kiss Rowena's cheek.
"Nah. I think it's too early to do that stuff."
"Probably because my face isn't tear-streaked and I'm not wailing morosely about how Michael is unloved," he quips.
When he finally does get out of the car, he hardly notices Rowena has arrived. He just calls Gabriel over to let him know he's heading up to their room, and blankly accepts the kiss he gets on the cheek. Everything is shutting down, and he barely makes it to the bed before he collapses.
Gabriel's bakery was in the heart of town, with other small businesses around it. Entitled 'Sweets and Treats', Cas can't help but feel it is the biggest Omega stereotype around. There's lots of pink, and blues. And rainbows. And a whole wall decorated in a glittery candy scene, in a style similar to the children's game 'Candy Land.' It's nauseating and over-the-top, and so completely Gabriel it's unreal.
"No cold feet for me to talk you out of?" Lucifer asks from the doorway. He looks stunning in his grey suit; it makes his blue eyes appear even more icy. Sam shivers. He still can't get over how gorgeous this Alpha, his mate (!) is.
"Now come on! I don't want us to be late!"
"Winchester! We're headed over the ER. There's an Omega who is suspected to have received a date rape drug at a bar. He's uncooperative with allowing us to perform a urine test on him, and you're the only Omega on shift tonight."
Dean cuts her off with a snapped, "I know what dating is! I just didn't realize you two were doing it. You're not allowed!"
Lucifer flashes out of Sam's body, and once Sam has singular control over his vocal cords he repeats, "It's okay. I said yes this time."
"Not asking about him."
Cas fakes a smile. "Sorry, Mom. I'm interning with Dr. Prescott."
"What is the definition of true evil?"
"I'm not adopting him. I don't know the first thing about children."
"Let's try it."
Sam makes a sturgeon face at her, but allows her to go first with a sweeping gesture.
BAM! Sam's and Meg's heads snap up in tandem. "What was that?" Sam asks.
"Oh, you two haven't figured it out yet? I'm not a prophet of God, Sam. I am God. I have told you this already, several times."
The bartender slides it to him. "You want a tab or pay as you go?" Lucifer hands the girl his card in answer and downs the shot.
"So let me get this straight- your fiance and your other fiance are in the same bathroom. One of them is naked, and you just trust they're not having sex without you because you're 'waiting til marriage'"?
Cas shrugs, feeling entirely unrepentant. "Too bad. You woke brand new parents. You're going to talk now."
"The correct lane, for one," Sam jokes, and Balthazar swerves into it. "Should we paint the rooms first?"
Cas makes this cute little mewling sound and his knees buckle slightly. Dean presses forward more, because who needs air, or even to stand, when he's finally kissing Cas? They fall together but don't stop kissing.
Dean comes over and yanks Sam to his feet. "Let's go back to the hotel. I don't feel safe out in the open like this."
The three men troop back upstairs. Gabriel quickly takes charge in the kitchen, which is good because Sam has been known to char toast on occasion. (Occasion meaning every time he had cooked before.) Within half an hour even Sam's stomach is rumbling, but Gabriel has an amazing fruit platter prepared, on top of egg sandwiches with bacon, sausage, and ham available. He leads them out to the huge dining room and shrinks the table so it's smaller and closer.They eat their breakfast with their legs tangled under the table and their elbows bumping, but it's nice and domestic and Sam actually enjoys it.
