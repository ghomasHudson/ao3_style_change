Sherlock and John nodded and turned south-west. “So they escaped Moriarty and started to venture out…”
It started with one sneeze, one which went unnoticed by the other five people sitting around the kitchen table of 221B Baker Street.
"Why didn't we think of that?" Sherlock muttered as he walked over to his lover. "John you're a genius!" He said then pressed a firm smacking kiss on John's mouth.
"Nope now let's go up TOGETHER and go see what it is Sherlock. This way you cannot hide it before I see it."
After the 'tea incident' the Holmes quickly figured out that if Lily did not like something then she was quick to foist it onto someone else… usually tampered with and usually Mycroft. Needless to say by dinner he was at his wits end.
Soon they were rolling around while John grappled with Sherlock's shirt, each groping and pressing sloppy kisses to each other's skin when Sherlock suddenly yelled making John pale. "Crap! Sorry!" John muttered then shrunk back at the stare. "You bit me."
"Oh she's menstruating!" Sherlock almost yelled to everyone's embarrassment. "This is what I meant about sensitivity and being subtle!" John hissed. "Why? It's a natural bodily function that she has no control over. The female of nearly every kind of animal goes through it so why be subtle?" Sherlock demanded. "Probably because we females don't want it broadcast what we are going through to an entire café…Kind of like walking around with an erection." Lily said with a quirked eyebrow making the boys stare at her and Lucian groans her name in embarrassment.
Both john and Sherlock both blinked at the story. "What was it that Mycroft said when he brought them? That the twins wouldn't hesitate to take out a threat? I think this is what he meant." John muttered mainly to himself.
"Of course I am why do you…Oh my god…have you never seen that movie?!" Greg asked and only gripped Mycroft's waist harder as he started to squirm away.
John only sighed as the cab dropped them off at The Monument. "Sherlock why are we here? No let me guess it's a secret."
"okay dishes are done!" Lily announced as John jerked away from Sherlock's warmth. "Do either of you want to watch a movie?" John asked hurriedly making Sherlock frown at him. "I guess…" Lily stared at the two before curling up with her brother in Sherlock's chair. Why couldn't they sit on the couch? John thought to himself then saw an opening. "Who wants popcorn?" he asked with a smile as the twins raised their hands simultaneously. "Alright you three decide on a movie while I make the popcorn…with or without butter?" He asked then fled at the 'butter and salt please'.
Both twins jolted in fear for they knew what an adult's slur meant and it was usually either drugs or alcohol. The only thing they didn't know was which of them he was going to harm first. To make matters worse this seemingly doped up man was blocking their only exit out of the room. "Alright you said good night now go to bed before you fall down." Came a lighter tone from behind Sherlock making him visibly jump. "Sorry you two but he fell asleep on the couch and wanted to say goodnight before going to bed. Sorry if he startled you we'll see you in the morning." John smiled at them before pulling the tired detective out of the doorway.
Everyone took a bite then signed as Lucian was the one to grab for the milk. "Wow I didn't know they made glue that sweet!"
“Well things change. But the kids are hungry and I promised dinner. You’re more than welcome to join us if you wish.” John remarked not noticing the kids gently pulling them away.
Greg's head snapped up at John's voice. "Oh sorry I was in my own little world... anyways like I said I know you don't want to stay with Harriet so you can always stay at my old flat for a while. That way you can keep in touch. Plus it will be easy to find you once we've located the children."
Every time they had asked Lily a question Lucian was the one who answered. That was when they saw them.
"Hello John I just wanted to come by and see how you are doing." An elderly woman said once he let her inside.
"You might have a point there...but you wouldn't be lonely." Sherlock muttered as he stirred something on the stove.
"So why were you shooting at Lily?" Lucian asked making Jim blink. "SOMEONE SHOT AT MY DAUGHTER?" he practically screamed making the twins flinch. "Sir that's what I was trying to tell you before. You see Mycroft hired a sniper to go after the girl and pretend to try and shoot at her." Sebastian said making Jim frown.
"What the?!" John exclaimed on seeing no trace of the twins in the flat. "They went to school." Sherlock said as he lifted a note that had been duct taped to their door. "How?...Oh alright…now what?" John asked as his daily schedule was now in a complete disarray. "Easy, we can either go to Scotland Yard and pester Lestrade for a case or…" Sherlock trailed off as he wrapped his arms around his lover. "We can go back to bed and…occupy ourselves."
Sherlock smiled as he saw his two children walk up the aisle to stand beside him. Next came Greg and Mycroft, both wearing black tuxedos adorned with purple flowers. Then came Molly and Mrs. Hudson both wearing ankle length violet dresses with icy blue edgings, they were both holding a single violet rose. Next came Kyle holding a light blue pillow on which rested two silver and gold rings. Then came his John and Sherlock lost sight of everything else as the love of his life walked up the aisle accompanied by his sister Harriet. John was wearing a dark blue suit with a purple rose boutonniere and a heather grey handkerchief in the pocket. His undershirt was a light blue colour and his tie was a heather greyish. His hair had been gelled (against his will) to stand up in small spikes and the only thing that adorned him besides that was a smile on his face which lit up his blue eyes. Likewise John could not take his eyes off of Sherlock who was dressed in a dark purple suit with a violet undershirt and an ice blue tie. His boutonniere was a single sprig of heather and his handkerchief was an ice blue color. He had used all his wiles to escape the mad hairdresser so his curls had not been touched by that evil person. Sherlock held out a single hand which John lovingly took as they stepped closer to the podium.
"Oh for heaven's sake I DID NOT KIDNAP THEM!" Sherlock shouted making everyone flinch. "Those are MY CHILDREN!" He was getting highly annoyed with the train of conversation but even more so at how they were scaring the kids.
." How the woman packed so much venom into one little word the children would never know. "It's not only making a mockery of families but the children of such unions will no doubt become criminals."
"Thank you kids...How did you get Mycroft to wear a party hat?" John asked making Lily give him a slightly evil smile before she twirrled away to force a hat on Sherlock.
"Like I said you're an idiot. Now let's go let him get a walk and feed him. Obviously he's going to start scratching at the door being cooped up in a room Sherlock. But that's not important what you should have done is come to me and told me."
"You think you know everything but really you only know the story they told you. You see we didn't kidnap you to harm anyone, least of all you two. We wanted to save you from Sherlock." The black haired man said making them even more suspicious. 'Why would we need saving from our father?" Lucian asked the insane man before him.
The device in question was relatively small only standing thirty centimeters in height. The odd thing about it was that it was covered in small tubes that spiraled around the base towards the top to flair out. The base had eleven buttons between the pipes and when pressed seemed to correspond to the different pipes. "Try the blue button it spits out bubbles." Lily remarked spoon dangling from her mouth. "Lily if you don't know what it is you shouldn't touch it." John said as he rubbed the bridge of his nose. "If you don't touch it how do you know what it is?" Lily asked off handedly with a tip of her head. "There is nothing that can be solved by touching it." Sherlock remarked with a quirk to his eyebrow making Lily's back stiffen. "Yes there is." She pulled the spoon out of her mouth with a pop. "Prove it." He remarked back watching her own eyebrow quirk. "A Rubik's cube." She said making them stare. "Stop arguing." Sherlock grumbled making them stare.
Sherlock bolted out of the car and into the waiting room. "John Watson." the girl behind the desk held up a finger as she chatted on the phone with what sounded like her boyfriend.
"ENOUGH!" John snapped seeing the argument that was rapidly turning into an all out war between the two of them. "John's right you two fight nice." Sherlock interjected making Johns eyebrow furrow in confusion. But instead of asking what he meant he just looked out the window. He had known Sherlock for years and he knew better than to ask that sort of question.
Again she started to argue. “No Lily, you have always been the rock for Lucian but stood on your own. Which admirable as it is, isn’t healthy. A rock that stands on its own while as strong as it is is liable to crumble. No John and I have spoken about this and we honestly think it will help.” Sherlock spoke as he knelt by her legs to take her hands into his, at how someone so inwardly strong could have such delicate hands. “Please just try, we are worried about you.”
“Yes yes yes everyone is alright and all set for school.” Sherlock sighed then started to complain about how school doesn’t actually serve a purpose and was only an excuse to get rid of children for hours at a time.
“Alright your father and I have been talking and we both think it’s best if you two see a therapist.”
Lily grinned evilly making the DI glad that he was not the reason for the smile. "Oh we chose the name specifically to annoy father. That was the entire reason for it."
John stared at the detective until he continued. "I only know of two people how two people who know that…Mycroft and….HER." Sherlock growled then jumped at the knock on the door. "Just remember Sherlock…It's not just you and I anymore…we have the kids to think about." John smiled as he opened the door to find the twins on the other side of the door. "Can we come back in now?" Lucian pouted making them chuckle as Lily glared.
"Alright so what do we do while we're here?" Lucian asked as they walked through the small field next to the loch.
All three men jumped as someone else knocked on the door and Sherlock shook his head at lestrades hopeful question of 'the children?'
just wanted you peoples to know that I now have a tumblr! I have no idea how to use it! but they (My friends who may or may not be imaginary) told me that I need to spread my weirdness around! So...Yea! any questions concerns and/or comments can also be relayed there were i'm sure you can comment more that once (Unlike here)....that's all!
Lucian growled at his sister only to lunge at the power cord by the wall. Suddenly the door burst and a BANG radiated throughout their room.
"Oh holy crap you speak English!" Lucian grinned and threw his arms around the boy. "You are so my favorite person! We need help, we were separated from our parents and then this guy shows up with a gun and sort of brought us here. But we escaped and can we use your phone?"
“Kids?” He called then heard them whispering in the other room. “We’re fine, go back to packing!” came Lucian’s voice.
Chapter 50: will be the supper fluffly epilogue with Sherlock and John on their Honeymoon (Or sex holiday what ever you wish to call it) with the kids being watched, because you don't bring kids on a sex holiday that would just be weird.
Normally such an action on her part would not be cause for concern but even through the fog of his mind palace Sherlock could see the blood that stained his daughters face and arm before she collapsed against the wall.
He couldn't help it, he chuckled making Sherlock huff in annoyance. "Sorry love, I know you're trying to comfort me and trust me the fact that your trying means the world. But I'll be fine in a while just give it time alright?" He said giving the detective a firm kiss.
Half an hour later Mycroft walked back into the room, face pale from barely controlled panic. "Sherlock…John…"
"Just great Sherlock I bring them all the way here and you frighten them off." Mycroft muttered as Sherlock stared at the empty couch. "Where did they go?" he asked softly.
"John did you not say that we needed groceries?" Sherlock asked hesitantly while John sat on the couch to read a book. "Oh yes I did didn't I?"
“Mrs. Hudson there’s something that you should know” Sherlock started then winced as she opened the door and frowned at him.
Moriarty waited for the girl to elaborate but quickly gave up when he realized that she was not a blabbermouth like all those dull people in the world. Instead he turned his attention towards Lucian.
"I have no idea, you can do some awesome drawings though, you now have time for it since we're out of school and don't have any homework."
"Who would leave a bomb on a coffee table set to detonate only when their target figured out how to turn it on?" Lily scoffed. "That's insane!"
"Thetwinsfoundhiminanaleywayinatrashcanandtheycouldntjustleaveittherejohn!Sotheytookhimhomebecausetheydidn'tknowofanyanimalsheltersandi'vebeentakingcareofitwhiletheyareatschoolandthey'vegrownsofondofit! Andit'scuteanddidn'tmakeanynoiseuntiltodaybecauseyouarehomebuti'llhelpthemtakecareofitand-"
He did not like these people; he did not like them touching his John. But if he put up a fuss he knew that his John would get angry at him so when the man let go he placed his arms around John's waist.
What surprised them most was the fact that there seemed to be no one else in the building. It was just empty room after empty room until they finally found the front door.
“I did it just said shit…how can you watch your mouth It’s below your eyes….” Lily wondered as she picked up the disinfectant spray.
He groaned and went to run a hand through his curls when he found that he could not move his arm. Looking down he saw that had been stapled to the floor. His children were definitely little devils.
The next day saw them at the secondary school with Sherlock fretting over his children and John pulling him back to give them air. "For the eighth time yes we have everything we need to take the exam! It's not like we can fail it!" Lily finally snapped then winced when Lucian smacked her in the back of the head.
"Have a nice nap?" John asked from the kitchen making Sherlock jump. "Yes...Why do I have the urge to hold her close until she feels better?" The detective asked making the doctor chuckle. "Sherlock all you want to do is make her hurt go away right?" Sherlock nodded. "Sherlock...that's one feeling I can't explain very well... it's a parental feeling...Love I guess."
We have and it's obvious that we are not wanted here. He doesn't want us at all and it's better to be with the devil you know. Lily mouthed at her brother, tears forming in her eyes from yet another rejection. Lucian nodded and sighed placing his forehead against hers. "Alright lets go" he whispered as he and Lily crept out of the flat not turning to look at the detective who was currently trying to strangle his elder brother, only to be pulled off by the doctor.
"Mycroft she's only testing you, if you didn't let it bother you so much then she wouldn't do it." Greg said as Mycroft tried to wash out his mouth after a bite of doctored cake. "But why me? Do I have a sign on me that says mess with me? Why doesn't she do this to John or Sherlock?"
"Alright sweet I'm going to leave a few bottles by your bed." He said and after forcing her to drink one of them he braced himself for the Inquisition that waited him down stairs.
Greg sighed again when he realized that this month will undoubtedly be the longest month of his life.
John was laying against the pillows of the bed he shared with Sherlock, smiling to himself. He was glad that he did not have to go In early today, especially after last night's sexcapades that even now brought a blush to his cheeks.
"No, not really." Lucian responded for the two of them as Jim led them back to the recreation room. "Alright you two unfortunately I absolutely HAVE to get some work done. Sometimes being an adult  SUCKS! But I will be done soon...ish. I'll be done soonish. Have fun!" Jim smiled insanely before walking off.
“Hello there you must be the Holmes children. Good afternoon I’m Julia Verone. You can call me Julia. Now please have a seat and we can get started.” She smiled then watched as both twins sat down then simply stared at her.
"Sherlock I can't find the twins anywhere!" Molly cried as she burst through the door. "They're right here with me." Sherlock sighed as Lily waved at the mortician. "You two nearly gave me a heart attack! Don't do ever do that again!" Molly almost shouted making Sherlock glare.
While the air marshal and the small team of barristers began to chatter amongst themselves, Sherlock took a glance at his
"Sherlock are you sure you are alright? We were a little rough last night." John worried over his husband who only turned and gave him a smile. "Yes I am sure. It was only the way I was sleeping that did it."
"Neither do I but we survived... raspberries!" Lily exclaimed as she ran over to one of the bushes only to jump as she frightened several birds and squirrels away.
John stared at his flatmate then sighed. "They will need to be disciplined for this you know…" Sherlock looked back up with a frown. "Why? There were no witnesses…perfect planning I might add…"
"I want to try this and the chair is too small to be of use." Sherlock smiled and laid his John on their bed.
"Your brother has decided that me working in Scotland Yard is 'no longer acceptable' and has put my resume in to various government offices!" Lestrade fumed making John openly gape. Thought he would have more sense than to do that! John thought. "Perhaps he believes you to be wasted on Scotland Yard?" John pondered hoping to diffuse the bomb cleverly disguised as Lestrade. Seeing his partner open his mouth with that gleam in his eye (the one that said that he was going to say something that is defiantly 'a bit not good') John covered his mouth with one hand, effectively quelling the comments that were about to come out of the consulting detectives mouth. "I don't know! All I know is that I kept getting calls asking if I still wanted the position that I applied for and when I asked Mycroft about it all he said was 'Scotland Yard is no longer acceptable' then ran off!" Lestrade shouted as he started to pace.
If anyone had told him a few years ago that he would be helping to raise his Homosexual lovers twins he would have laughed. But at this moment he couldn't think of anyplace that he'd rather be than with his lover and the twins beside him.
Keeping with the theme Sherlock set a brutal pace, pulling back only to slam back into John harshly making him groan.
Sherlock tried not to let it show how much that look affected him, tried and failed miserably as he was immediately by the boys side, wrapping his arms around him. "It's alright I understand why you did it." He said not noticing his lovers smile, nor the fact that John took out his phone to take a picture.
"Hello I'm Sherlock Holmes and this is my partner John Watson, is there any way to get them into as many of the same classes as possible?" Sherlock asked then raised an eyebrow at Tinsdale's sneer. "Keeping them together will only make it harder on them in the long run…so no it isn't possible." He scoffed making John glare. "Listen those children have never been apart for very long so forcing them apart will only result in panic attacks. I'm a doctor I know these things." John said as he drew himself up to stare down the teacher who only scoffed again at him. "Fine but if they get put in my class they won't be together for very long." The proctor almost snarled at the doctor who only gave him a curt nod as he received the answer he was looking for. "That is fine." He said and pulled a sullen Sherlock to sit and wait for the twins to finish their exam. "But I wanted to yell at him." Sherlock mumbled making John chuckle. "As long as it isn't physical you can do whatever you want to, to the next one. Alright you numpty?" John smiled as Sherlock wrapped his fingers around his.
“Kids can you come down here please?” He called up the stairs. “I know its only been a few days and we are all trying to get used to each other’s presence but that won’t happen if you two hide in your room all day. Your room is still your room and we will not go in unless we get either of your permissions first. But we would both like for you two to spend more time down here.”
"Hopefully tower of London if not the bottom of the Thames." Lily's voice made even the iceman flinched. She did not like this woman not one bit.
"I need an itsy bitsy favor from you two." He smiled at the twins who eyed him suspiciously. "And that would be?"
John walked down stairs to find Mycroft and Sherlock faced off with a seething Lavonia. "Sherlock…You need to go up stairs…the twins need you." Was all he said as he walked forward to slap the children's mother. "John!" Mycroft exclaimed.
"Do you think Sherlock is angry at us? I mean John does have PTSD…" Lucian whispered across the gap between their beds. "I don't think so…I mean he did get to cuddle with him." Lily whispered back as she laced her fingers with her brothers and let their clasped hands dangle in the air. "Hey..I want ted to shay goodnigh...'fore you and he went to shleep…" Came a slurred baritone from the doorway.
“Greg! What’s going on?” John said as he got up from the desk where he had been looking for more books and art supplies for the twins.
"Yea right as if anyone would willingly want to go to bed with you. Now sweetheart, where is your mother?" Anderson asked as he managed to grab Lily around the upper arm, almost knocking her off balance with the force of his grab.
"A bit not good blah blah blah." Lily remarked eyeing the attendant down. "Listen lady we need some help, we've been kidnapped by MI6 agents to use against our father…"
The next morning a sullen Sherlock saw his children onto the school bus accompanied by a camera bearing John. "Not fair…I just got them and already their being taken away…Why?" He grumbled making John sigh. "For one it's the law all children need to go to school. Second of all they will be back in a few hours. Now let's go upstairs and I'll make you some tea alright?"
Both of the twins stared at Sherlock, disbelieving what they had just seen. "I have a question for you two…" The detective trailed off as his anger depleted. "Yes?" Lucian asked with hero worship in his eyes. "How the hell did you two manage to make if from Molly's office to here without being seen?" He questioned after mentally running though the corridors. "Magic…" Lily said off handedly then signed at the look Sherlock gave her.
"And you believe this?" Lucian asked voicing the thought he knew was rattling around in Lily's head. Kyle nodded his head but before he could answer the question verbally there came a shout from down stairs.
"Now is this only allowed on the face? Where is it not acceptable to do this?" Sherlock asked straddling Johns hips and staring down at his john in confusion while holding him down for questioning. "Sherlock there are no rules for giving affection….You just do what comes naturally." John smiled up at Sherlock who gave him a hesitant smile before gifting his john with his 'affection'.
"How did he get inside?" John asked looking around at the three Holmes's and Lestrade. "He had to have had someone on the inside…but who?" Mycroft asked as he scanned a list of names trying to figure out which one was weakest. "He would have had to have something on the man to do that, anyone come into mind Mycroft?" His father asked.
John smiled again as the thought of a sick Sherlock was not something he would like to see in the near future. "ACHOO!"
Lily and Lucian ran down the corridors peering into every window they came across, looking for their father. "Where the hell is he?" Lucian snarled after almost running into Anderson flirting with a receptionist. "And how are we going to get around that git?" He asked making his sister smile. "Leave that to me."
It had been a fortnight since Lestrade had heard from Sherlock and at this point he was very worried. He had heard from John but that was only through texts. The detective Inspector had tried to ask what was going on, but John had only replied that things were a little hectic at the flat and they were going through some stuff. The doctor had promised to explain things in due time. With that, Lestrade had planned on leaving the two alone for the time being, figuring that they will get in touch when they can.
“Sherlock, dear brother, it’s nearly four hundred kilometers from here to Scotland. That would be almost eight and a half hour long drive which is a VERY long drive especially with you and two kids in the car Sherly.”
"I hope Kyle didn't get into trouble for all this." John started off as he poured the tea for his lover and the Detective Inspector, making them both smile. "No we just went over what happened and since they were the ones to throw the first punch and he was defending a girl, he wasn't in any trouble." Lestrade smiled then cast a worried look at the stairs. "I get the feeling that silence from three children is not a good thing." Sherlock announced as he tried to see what Greg saw on the stairs.
"I know John! That's what I've been trying to say!" Sherlock said as he pulled John's hand from his mouth. "I just wished to make my feelings on this matter known. As soon as you are ready I wish to marry you. But if you do not wish to marry then I am happy just to be with you."
"No shit. First of all he's a guy and sweet and innocent doesn't actually work with him. Second of all he's a known threat so getting on his good side? Yea not going to happen. So he plays it as himself. Thirdly you both made it OBSENELY easy to fool you both. Just tip your head and widen your eyes a bit and 'wa la' the big bad assassins tripping over himself to cuddle you and make everything all better again."
Lily and Lucian sat in the back of the car dressed in black, Lily unhappy that she had to wear a real dress but did not say anything because she did not wish to upset John.
Now all that was left was to locate a toggle switch, some wire, solder and solder items. But that couldn't happen until tomorrow. So she hid the camera behind a rock and went back inside.
Quickly both the detective and blogger's faces were smeared in green icing, even getting some in their hair. But both men (and everyone else attending) were laughing.
What Is wrong with me? She asked herself as she caught herself falling asleep in French class. "Mademoiselle Holmes! Reveiller!" Madam Riesen demanded as she stood at the head of the class. "Je suis desole Madam Riesen Je suis fatigue." Lily responded with a yawn making the professor eye her skeptically. "Your French Is very good for someone who just started taking this course." She commented making Lily shrug.
Lucian wrapped his arms around his sister and rocked her gently in his arms, pressing a kiss to her hair. "It's alright A Ghra." he murmured before turning towards the men who kidnapped them. "Who are you and what do you want with us?" Lucian demanded to know.
“Leave my kids alone.” Sherlock sighed, already tired of her actions and motioned for the kids to follow him.
'Sherlock, These past few years have been a whirlwind of chaos and I honestly cannot say that this has been boring. But even after all the chaos dies down, and life stills just a bit I can honestly say that I come out on top. Because I'll have you. You make life worth living for and I don't want to think about where I would be without you because it hurts to even imagine life without you. I love you so much Sherlock..."
The man was nice enough to give the twins a large jug of water and some food in a bag before kicking them off his land. He might not have had a good grasp of the English language but that did not mean that he didn't know that trouble was following them.
He made it to the park before he had to sit down, his leg feeling as if someone was trying to skin it and he was having a little trouble breathing. All it took was a few words from Sherlock and he was bordering on a panic attack and his psychosomatic limp came back worse than before.
“Sirs…We wish to apologize for our behavior and recognize that your children were not in the wrong. The security officer will be fired before the hour. You and your children and Captain Watson here will all receive a complimentary flight back as well as a full refund on this flight. And since there is still almost an hour wait for the flight we would like you all to have one of these.” He said as he pulled out four black cards. “Each will get you anything and everything you want in the airport. Food snacks, tchotchkes you name it. And it is completely on us. We apologize greatly for your inconvenience.” He said then gave a little bow before fleeing in the opposite direction.
When Sherlock and the twins walked into Scotland Yard they were met with stares and whispers of 'they look just like him' and 'I can't believe its true!'.
"I can't find the off button!" He yelled as the radio started to turn up all by itself. "Unplug it!" She cried.
The twins however, were having the time of their lives. Lexy had bought them ice cream and they were sitting on one of the benches and people watching while Lexy ran around town looking for them. "I like it here, it's quiet."
"Of course I saw it before we jumped I'm not insane you know. I saw it from the tree but you can't see it from up there I guess…now come on we have to climb up and get to that church, hopefully they have a phone."
The next day Mycroft had the files sent over which John immediately opened, pouring over them with Sherlock reading over his shoulder.
Sherlock was in the act of gently placing his violin in the case and the twins were both curled up on the couch, fast asleep.
Soon both twins were covered in the sticky red juices and groaning in the delight of having their stomachs filled.
John and Lestrade looked at each other before staring at Mycroft. “Well I speak a bit of Farsi and Arabic. I can get by in English what about you Greg?”
At this point Sherlock returned from the shops, carrying a few bags, just in time to hear Anderson yell at John. "Oh you are such a sicko…How long have you been holding them for? And I thought that you John had the decency to not let him do this.”
The coffin was led out of the funeral parlor and into the Hearse where John took his hand and placed it above his heart. Then he turned and walked back to the car, motioning for everyone to follow.
"Everything all right dad?" Lily asked as she and Lucian turned around in their seat to peer over the headrest.
That put a sad look on John's face, which did not make Sherlock very happy. "I'll be alright, how's Lexy doing?"
Sherlock scoffed at that. “I do not speak hollow words. You are my children therefore my responsibility in all things. Now we must go and get you clothes…and beds…and…stuff so you can stay here. To be honest I don’t know what that entails but we shall figure this out. John what do teenagers need?”
Sherlock, John and Greg were sitting at the (surprisingly clean) kitchen table having tea when the children came down stairs. "You called oh mighty overlord?" Lily snarked at her father making John smile.
The twins spoke one right after the other and Jim tried not to snap his neck from one to the other as they spoke. "Thank you."
Lily frowned as the boy upped the anti. "But you don't even know me how could it concern you?" She questioned as she added to the pot between them. The cracker pile was growing significantly.
Bed? HE SAID BED! Sherlock's mind screamed and he lifted his blogger up into his arms and carried him into their bedroom, his lips never leaving Johns skin lest the spell be broken and John would remember that he's not-gay.
“To be honest? No. I ordered x-rays for the kids and John...both kids have had numerous broken bones and fractures and judging the healing, this is over the course of their entire lives.” Sarah looked to be on the verge of tears.
So thinking that this would be easy John took Sherlock and the kids to the baker to choose a cake. Five minutes later John figured out what hell looked like.
"Yea I don't think she ever got that eye bleach she asked for either." John grinned as he walked over to put a baton in Lucians coat pocket.
Lily smiled as she danced with her uncle Mycroft, trying not to step on his feet and laughing as she was whirled out of his arms by Greg who demanded a dance with his girl. But that partner didn't last long as Lucian walked over to give the two a bow and asked if he could cut in.
"it's a piece of paper…" Sherlock said looking at John curiously. "Lily found this in her locker at school…you need to read it Sherlock."
John was pretty sure that it he didn't get Sherlock to stop he was going to die…or explode. Fortunately he was able to pull the detective back up his body to kiss him with everything he had; eliciting one of the most pornographic moans he has ever heard. "GOD JAWN!" the detective growled and began to rut against the blogger beneath him. . "Sh-sh-sherlock…Oh god…I-I-I want…." John stuttered and panted as he wrapped his legs around his waist. This caused Sherlock to pause.
"Alright this is a sample platter of different cakes. The first row is of a sponge cake, the second is a type of angel cake and the third is a butter cake. The flavors from left to right are vanilla, chocolate, spice, carrot, pineapple, banana, strawberry and raspberry. Bon Apatite."
"True, but you would think that because we stand out and it's such a small village that we would be easy to find…I mean this must be the fifth time she's ran by us."
“I am very sorry this has happened. If I had known of your existence much earlier, I could have done something a lot sooner. I promise you that no harm will come to either of you in this house, not by John, me or my brother.”
“We’ll try” Lucian said then moved to sit by her sister, obviously unhappy with her about something.
"I see the girl is a bit possessive isn't she?" Duncan winced at the pokes but endured and ignored them in favor of speaking to John.
John shuddered as Sherlock growled in his hear and pressed back against him. "I absolutely ADORE the second option…" he purred and lifted his head for his lovers kiss.
"Let's drop Anthea off first." Greg asked as he thought about it and decided that leaning into Mycroft, no matter how much he wanted to, would only make him hotter.
The twins were curled up in Lucian's bed, facing each other with their hands clasped in a symbol of unity. "I've already taken at least thirty photographs….want me to send you one?" Sherlock asked as john shook his head in amusement. "Most definitely. I'm going to frame it for my desk at work…you know they look a lot like you when their asleep?" He asked with almost hidden amusement. "Well half of those genes are mine so I would be remiss if they did not look like me even a little bit…"
"Lucian and I played Spec. Ops." Lily remarked making her brother snicker while John frowned. "And that means?" He started then continued when Lily opened her mouth. "Not the definition…how did you play spec. ops?" John asked making Lily blush. "We got bored in Molly's office and she kept trying to feed us tea and cakes…and she treated us like we were five so Luce and I snuck around till we found dad." Lily explained then realized her mistake as Johns eyes narrowed. "But he was in the laboratory so Luce and I just hung out while he worked! And we had too Molly kept trying to stick me with unicorn paraphernalia and I don't like unicorns their really really…sparkly…." Lily said looking up at John through her eyelashes. "See? No rules were broken."
Alright I know this is not a comedy but why would she pick out a sad movie? Ah I see the sad movie is for my benefit if the looks Lucian kept shooting at me is any hint…But how. Wait she purposely sat in the chair with her brother…how is a sad movie and them sitting together helping me? Ah I see she is trying to get John (not that I need any help) perhaps a little closer? Sherlock thought as He moved even closer to his friend. "What are you doing?" his friend snapped quietly at him. "They look comfortable and I wanted to try it…" He blurted out then mentally patted himself on the back at the lie that flew from his lips. "You mean Lily and Lucian?" John whispered back and turning to look at the two.
Might as well Lucian said silently with a quirk of his eyebrow. One more chance? That's all he gets with me. Lily responded with a stare and a tap of her finger. "Alright…" Lucian responded as they cautiously followed their father out of the train yard and back to 221b Baker street.
John had never done the marketing so quickly and would be loathe to take Sherlock anywhere for a while…especially after the man managed to bean him with an over ripe tomato.
"A horror show. The man decapitated his wife by breaking a window and shoving her neck into the shards dad. He killed her simply because she lost her baby after HE hit her in the stomach..." She said as she pulled her knees to her chest.
“Great now we have company…” John remarked as he pulled himself to his feet and rubbed his lower back. “Evening John, where is…What happened here?” Mycroft asked staring at the three figures covered in white powder.
John smiled gently at Sherlock before pulling him into a hug. "This is why I love you, you insane man."
"Air head? That's solid vacuum." Lily remarked watching the woman run back yet again then stop and type something on her phone.
"No it's alright." Lily said making them all frown then she reached behind her and withdrew a cheap disposable camera. "Besides, I took pictures."
"TWINS!" came a shout from down stairs making them jump and blush in guilt. "Crap…wanna bet what that's about?"
In the end John ended up with a silver wedding band in place of an engagement ring. He had said no to numerous requests and ideas including a tattoo on his forehead that said 'Taken'.
"Really?" lily sneered as she stepped over the unconscious man only to sprint through the restaurant kitchen ignoring the shouts of horror and the demands to stop the followed her until she got onto the street.
“He does assist me on cases as well as working at the clinic.” Sherlock said watching as Lily nudged her brother and gave a pointed look to the violin.
"Greg, Kyle, John, Lily, Lucian this is my father Sir Trymman Alexander Holmes and his wife Amalee Holmes." Mycroft smiled at the guests as he made the introductions. "Ah yes, Sherlock's children." Trymman said as he made his way over to the twins and he grasped Lily's chin forcing her to look him in the eye. "You, my dear, have much of your fathers rebellious spirit in you…as well as his coldness…be careful you do not feed the ice within you too much my dear otherwise you may not be able to find your way back." He whispered as he turned his attention to towards his new grandson. "You have his shyness…and I see you also inherited his artistic ability as well. What medium?"
Sherlock wanted to reach out and comfort him but knew that if he did then he would lose it as well. "Sherlock, your vows please."
"Nope not going to have this discussion with you again. Now let's get up there and make sure that everything is fine alright?"
That night Sherlock simply held John in his arms. They simply laid together in silence, John seeking comfort and Sherlock clueless as how to give it.
Greg laughed as he pulled his lover up to kiss him on the lips. "Make yourself comfortable I'll be right back." He smiled even as Mycroft growled at him. He didn't want to get out of bed but he did need to go to the bathroom.
Lestrade knew the signals that he was being ignored and only smiled at the detective. "How is Scotland yard?"
Mycroft stared at the image of his broken love in the door way. "Gregory…I thought you didn't like your job…I mean you complain about it all the time and I just thought…I was only trying to help." He said as he pocketed his phone. "And as for the last few months …if I seemed as if I was taking you for granted forgive me…I'll try harder it's just, other people's problems are easier to than ours because…When I look at you…all the problems of the world just don't exist anymore and all I can think of is you're MINE and I can't believe it…"
After a few second John started to groaned and thrust back into the digits lodged inside of him "M-More..." He groaned as Sherlock started to add another finger to the two that were already inside of him.
"Alright Greg has a big night in front of him as we aren't helping him move into Mycroft's place. Now come along kids say thank you and good bye." John smiled and as always was in complete control of the situation. "Sherlock don't be long."
“What?!” Came the indignant cry from under the table where the detective was no doubt pretending to clean.
"Oh this that and the other, you know how it is. How are things at The Yard?" she smiled and leaned into her friend.
"I love you John. And you're mine...MINE!" Sherlock roared as his body poured into Johns forcing the doctor to follow him over that cliff and into bliss.
"Why is everyone so concerned for you? I mean they usually just show concern for the descendants of the deceased and not the nephews and nieces…right?" John sighed at the question.
After they purchased and changed into the clothes their mother shoved them onto yet another bus and took them to Regents park.
"So you purposely manipulated her into speaking even though it made her angry at you?" John asked missing the fact that Sherlock scooted closer. "Yes she clearly was not going to speak while her brother was going to do it for her. She is too careful for that and now she knows that she can speak not only to you but to me as well." He reasoned as he lay against his John, only to jump up as the door opened to reveal the Detective Inspector with Sally and Anderson following. "Alright you know the drill." Lestrade said.
"What the…Hello?" He asked missing Sherlock quickly looking out the window at something that was apparently very fascinating.
Achfary does exist as does their black and white phone box. have I ever been you ask? no I have not did I just pick a small village at random? Of course!
He was even more prideful when John broke a random coppers nose after he made a comment about gays in the military.
"He would. But you shouldn't." Greg could see the vein in Mycrofts temple start to throb. "Why shouldn't we? I mean we learned all about sex in school...kind of disgusting to be honest." Lily made a face at that making Greg laugh. "Well it is disgusting and I don't recommend you ever having sex...perhaps you should wait until you are forty." Mycroft responded as his eye started to twitch when he thought about all the suitors that would inevitably come knocking at Sherlock's door. Yep his brother was definitely going to jail once the world population of boys figured out how beautiful and untouchable his niece was. "You're odd." Lily remarked making the minor government official want to pound his head on the steering wheel.
"I don't think I have ever seen Sherlock this happy." Greg smiled absentmindedly as he leaned into Mycroft who just showed up. Both were watching the two drunks sway together in an imitation of a dance.
car instead of having her almost faint from the heat." Greg shot back and Mycroft took the time to actually look at his boyfriend.
Lily and Lucian crept down to the fuse boxes where Lily placed her device next to the opened panel. "Watch this." She whispered excitedly as she rapidly turned on and off the device only to wait for a moment before turning it on.
John smiled as he walked over to the cake, hand in hand with Sherlock only to laugh out loud as it was finally revealed.
John and Sherlock had a week of bliss before they started with the details of the wedding. First was the date which brought up the questions of the suits. If they had the wedding in the spring or summer the suits would have to be pretty light weight. But if it was in the fall or winter, they would have to be thicker. But that all depended on if they wanted the venue to be outside of not. And if they had it outside would it be in a tent or an open air wedding? If it was open air then what would they do if it rained?
Directly off the plane John and Sherlock took a cab to Greg and Mycrofts flat where they thought (extremely briefly) about knocking. But Sherlock being himself, opened the door to find Greg sitting on the couch reading the paper with no children in sight. "Jes-" He was cut off by John's hand as the doctor a finger to his lips, shushing the detective inspector.
"Lets see the tea set would be for John, a flask for Aunty Harriet, the handcuffs for him and John (You're totally right to not want those back by the way) and I'm pretty sure the monocle would be for Uncle Croft as his birthday is coming up and I'm not really sure what the baton was for...Unless the copper was harassing him or John in some way." Lucian smiled as he thought about his father.
"Alright I don't understand so help me out with this one." Lucian said, the sound of the rushing water covering his words. "Luce, that guy has cameras EVERYWHERE inside that place. He is definitely lying about being our father and about Sherlock I know that much." Lily said and sat down on one of the large rocks that laced the water's edge. "This place is most definitely a gilded cage." She said then continued at Lucian's confused look. "You know looks like a dream house but it's still a prison."
"She didn't put anything in it. She's just standing there looking evil to make people think that she did. Smart that one."
Is that his mouth? That's his mouth TONGUE! Oh god TEETH...Too much! Sherlock's thoughts were a blue of John's actions as he pried his friend off of his cock and lifted him to ravage his mouth only stopping to strip his blogger of his pants. "Oh GOD!" John growled as Sherlock lay on top of him and started to grind.
John sighed as he walked up the stairs. He woke to an empty bed, something that he did not especially like.
The man handed their mother an envelope that was bursting with bills. “You will not bother them again and if I find that you try to wring any more out of them or their father I will find you and hunt you down. Now come along children.”
John and Sherlock were having a nice conversation with one of the local couples when the twins ran by. Then a group of boys ran by after wards, one was bleeding profusely from the nose.
“Alright so go pick out clothes” Sherlock said as they entered the store and then stared back at the twins who simply stared at him.
"Sherlock…Dad, we've never worried about…well THAT with you and John." Lucian rasped after he stopped giggling. "And I'm still sorry about throwing things at you and yelling at you." He whispered and sent his father a pleading look.
John blinked at the tone of Mycroft's voice. He was obviously worried. "Oh the twins came down with the flu bout three or four days ago and your brother refuses to leave their side...you know how he can get."
"Fine then you pick a direction!" Lily shouted and stomped off leaving her brother to sigh and follow her. "Lily-lie wait up. Let's just keep heading in this direction for a while alright? I mean it has to be better than staying in one place. Alright so let's take a deep breath and just keep going." Lucian smiled at his sister making her feel guilty. "Alright we'll go."
“Yes, I seen them. I tried to let them use phone but no service out in my town.” The boy said with a gentle smile.
Lily forced herself to blush at his words. "We were curious as to what you do as security but you always knew we were there…"
not surprising that Monopoly was soon thrown across the cabin but surprisingly it was Greg who tossed it. He and Sherlock got into an argument over one of the railroads and Greg decided to put an end to the childish game once and for all. However, they only had half an hour before landing so the couples went to different sides of the plane. John and Mycroft listened while Greg and Sherlock complained about each other.
"Thank you" the twins said simultaneously as they sat on the couch, obviously not wanting to be parted from one another. "Hope you don't me asking…but what or who are you running from?" Raz asked as he put the kettle on.
"What do you want to do today?" Sherlock sighed and curled a little harder into John, making his point clear. "Point taken." John replied as he rolled over to embrace his husband.
When the kids left Lestrade handed Sherlock a file. “A total of seven bodies have turned up over the last three days. Each body had markings carved into their faces and hands. Obviously we have no idea what these markings are.”
Sherlock was about to just shrug off his concern before thinking twice about it. “Kids can you wait outside for a moment?”
" See that didn't take long." He smiled then his face fell when he saw the look on Mycroft's face. "What's wrong?"
John and Sherlock nodded solemnly at Mycroft. They knew better than to get their hopes up for Moriarty was a sly little devil so it may take a while before they are even able to pinpoint the twins’ location.
"We didn't not get seen…there was a receptionist who was more than happy to distract that Medical Examiner thing while we went by. Then there was that man who distracted that woman…Doberman? For us then again he seemed a little off. It's just a matter of distraction and not a little bit of sleight of hand." Lily remarked as she flipped through a medical journal, unaware of her father's smile and her brother's headshake. "Modest isn't she?"
John thought for a moment before pulling Sherlock’s head down. "I love you too Sherlock and I swear if you ever do that again..."
“Alright you two, sit down. Sherlock come in here…yes you as well.” John insisted making the detective glower at him.
Sweat poured as bodies pounded together. Each man was slamming into the other, trying to gain that little bit of sensation that would push him over the edge and into oblivion.
“School is starting soon and while your father has voiced his opinion on the matter, he is wrong. You have to go to school.”
Harriet stared at the venomous little girl who was currently having what looked like a very serious conversation with Sherlock. "Uncle Shamus died…he's asked to be buried in Scotland and for you to be a pole barer…"
"Why is Sherlock pouting now?" Lestrade asked as he and his son got into the car. "He doesn't want to go to the manor and just lost a fight with Mycroft over it." Lily helped as she then turned her attention to Kyle in order to ignore her father who was pulling Johns phone out of his hand. "Oh relax its only Harry and you don't even want to talk to her right now." He snapped and turned the conversation elsewhere.
"What in god's name were you two thinking? I mean in the last week you two have put glycerin in the fountains, switched the lavatory signs, covered Tinsdales car with Post-its and somehow managed to put lockers in front of his office! What were you doing?" John asked evenly which scared the twins more than shouting ever could.
They were both extremely drunk when John decided that he would like to dance with his beloved. (Luckily to a slow song, Sherlock didn't think he could survive one of the fast paced ones while inebriated)
Oh yes I do, I really do. But if I were you Sherlock, I would keep an eye on those precious to you. After all I do owe you and lets not forget that you aren't the only one who gets bored. And what lovely playthings you have to distract you M
to say is that it’s probably a good idea to let other people know about the twins. Just so this doesn’t happen again.”
"I know Luce…at the moment your sister is ill and therefore defenseless. Being her twin this brought out your protective instincts that are connected to her. But I hope you understand that neither John or I would EVER harm either of you…Neither physically nor sexually. Your too short for John and I prefer blond army doctors." He added making them giggle.
She sighed as she sat back gingerly; it had taken her almost an hour put this device together and she was in the final leg of the race. She carefully re-inserted the battery. The device was ready. Now all that needed to happen was wait until the most opportune time showed then they would be free.
Summary: Four years after Sherlock's return from his fall Mycroft visits with two unexpected visitors. Normally that wouldn't be a problem but...what? They're his kids? How will this change our favorite consulting detectives life? and what happens when the enemy appears and takes an interest in the two kids? Mainly dialogue for this first chapter. (Just to get the ball rolling)
Sherlock shrugged as he sat down on the couch and pulled his lover into his lap. "No idea. But there isn't any explosive of any kind in that machine. So it's safe and the fog is non-toxic." He murmured and started to kiss down John's jugular vein.
“Oh come on John, the boy had no marks on his hands where Lily had several. So she was obviously the one that hit him.”
So far they had not spoken a single word to the man and from the looks of it, the man was not surprised.
Mycroft finally looked up at his boyfriend, that posed as bad news. "Let me see..." He strode quickly over to the CCTV footage and stared. "I'm going to find Sherlock...Our dear doctor looks to be having a severe panic attack and his PTSD symptoms seem to be surfacing. Which direction did he come from?"
"An experiment, I'm relatively sure that human contact will decrease the flight or fight reaction in case you have a night terror…" Sherlock smiled inwardly as he felt his john weigh the options concerning Sherlock wrapped around him. "Alright…but if you wake up with bruises and what not I tried to warn you and you will not pout about it and I get another bed…alright?" The army doctor reasoned gently with his detective…besides Sherlock was rather…warm.
Lily and Lucian were laying on her bed when Sherlock and John burst into the room. "Come along children." Sherlock said gleefully as he jumped up and down. "Come along get your things packed the cab is waiting!" John said as he poked his head into the room. "I don't understand you are meant to be on your honeymoon!" Lily cried as she started stuffing her clothes into her suitcase. "We decided that we wanted you with us. Now you have two choices. You can either stay here or come with us."
Sherlock stared at John through lowered eyes. "Fine.." he pouted before following his army doctor up the stairs and back into their flat.
"It was good no one died or poisoned themselves this time." Lucian grinned as he slipped a flask in his pocket, unnoticed by Sherlock but not by John. "I mean it is that time of year where all the students are bored with the subject and just want to take off for holidays." he grinned.
He stood there simply looking at his lover’s body until said lover gave an audible throat clear and looked pointedly at his clothes.
“Find a way in ourselves” Lily sighed and tried to pull away from the Marshel who just held tighter.
Mycroft had a pleasure of watching his younger brother's eyes fill with horror and the blood drain out of his face.
"Well I'm done for the day…do either of you need anything or wish to go somewhere?" Sherlock asked three hours later then frowned when he did not receive an answer. Turning he found Lily and Lucian curled up in one of the chairs, backs turned towards the other and deeply asleep. Smiling at the sight he walked over to take a few photos before waking them up to bring them home.
“Lily. Sarah gave me the medical files today and… it’s not good.” He said then went on to describe the old injuries both kids had acquired and ending on Lily’s current ones then what Sarah had said to him.
Sherlock's shoulders sagged in defeat as his little lover used his army voice. "Alright just.. sit there and I'll...go and get it."
Greg sighed as he watched John struggle into a shirt. He didn't know what to do. John's leaving will most definitely break Sherlock in a way that will destroy him. He knew that Sherlock will have to be put on full surveillance once again because John was Sherlock's world as were the kids and with both of them gone...
Alright people I'm extending the story a chapter and the next one will be the wedding then the honeymoon. Mainly because I was up till two AM and don't feel like doing anymore research tonight...and I have to be up at six tomorrow. So yea ending it here...
“Evening John, where is…What happened here?” Mycroft asked staring at the three figures covered in white powder.
"No you aren't the enemy but you're not doing anything either. Your USELESS here...That's all you can do isn't it. Just make tea and try to SOOTH some nerves. Why are you even here? This isn't just another case here. These are MY children and you're useless here. Why don't you go to the clinic or something? Leave and let me find MY children." Sherlock snarled at his lover.
"Hello children how are you fairing with Sherlock?" Greg asked as they walking in his office without knocking. Interesting he usually berates me for not knocking…it must be because of the children. Sherlock thought then noticed the look on his offspring's faces.
"AND YOU DIDN'T THINK TO USE IT TO CALL SOMEONE?" Mycroft roared from behind them and they both jumped as they didn't hear him come in. "Actually yes the thought did occur to me but considering I was under fire from a friggin sniper I thought it prevalent to keep my family as far away from him as possible." Lily snarled back at her uncle then sat back to await John and Lucians return home.
"Ah, you must be the Holmes's. Second door on the right please." Said the receptionist, a pretty young blond woman who eyes Sherlock. Young and dumb…useful Lily thought and gave the woman her 'I'm small, cute and shy protect me' smile which made her melt. For some reason being small and shy brought out the protective instincts in people, though Lily never understood why.
Sherlock and John spun slowly as the song rose and fell, Sherlock lovingly whispering some of the lyrics in John's ears. They slowed to a stop once the woman stopped singing and John laughed to find himself a little misty once again. "I love you, you berk."
"She's fine… She likes the floor for some reason." Sherlock intervened as he sat up to look the woman over. But at the shake of John's head left the deductions in his head, unspoken.
Lucian stared at the man, unmoving until he felt Lily pinch his back. "Wait...Sherlock isn't our father."
Sure enough Sherlock pounced as soon as he left the room, bombarding him with questions. "What Is It? Is she going to be alright? How serious is it? Will she have to go to hospital?"
"It's alright sweeting, we aren't going to hurt you. Bad Sebastian had to knock you out. After all we couldn't have you seeing where you were heading now could we? As for Kyle… Well we left him back at the manor. Lucian is here though, he's in his own room!" He giggled and flicked the tip of her nose. 'Alright mad man thinks' I'm harmless, I can play that up.'
"John…" Sherlock whispered as he finally came face to face with his friends soldier side. "Sherlock…you may need to sit down…I don't think Lily and Lucian can handle telling the story again..."
“No he wouldn’t…would he? Why would he do that?” Sherlock got close and eyed the doctor making him smile.
“How about you take turns asking questions and try to get to know each other?” John said as he came down.
Moriarty frowned at the girl's odd request. "Disposable cameras? Wouldn't you rather a digital camera?"
“No, I did not. I understand it’s entirely unexpected but…I’m not sure how to say this.” Sherlock said as he lifted a hand to his chin and looked a little confused for a second. “Apparently I am a father.”
"Still can't believe that he sank down to this level." Amalee Holmes sneered at her sister even as they took their seats in the front row. "I know! I couldn't believe it myself when I heard Sherlock was getting married!"
Greg felt like someone wiped a ice-lolly down his spine, he knew that they didn't see much of each other and considering the line of the conversation they just had... this did not bode well at all.
Mycroft simply sighed at the childish insult before smacking his little brother in the head with his umbrella. "Hmm I would have thought it would have made different sound as your head is as hollow as your heart is. You're an idiot Sherlock. You are not the only one suffering the loss of the twins. But you just cannot see that can you? Do you know what you have done? Do you even care?" Mycroft growled as Sherlock rubbed his head.
. We made a pact along time ago. It’s always been us against the world so there can be no secrets between us.” Lily hung her head even farther with Lucians words and winced as her brother continued. “When did this even happen Lily?”
