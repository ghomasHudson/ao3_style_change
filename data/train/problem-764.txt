Are you at work? - SH
How can you be closer to Mycroft? It's like he's got his umbrella stuck up his arse - JW
John. John. John. That's all I could think about. I knew that bringing her back was a mistake, but I needed those images. My head went into overdrive. What did he mean 'Get away from you'? What had I done? Did he dislike Irene? Couldn't blame him, so do I. She was clingy. Intelligent but very irritating. The night had gone better than expected. She didn't have much to say but I drowned her out anyway. It was her idea to come back here, so why was John being weird? Maybe I should have told him it was for a case. I could tell he was extremely uncomfortable when I introduced them. John adopted his military stance, meaning he felt threatened. Threatened by who? Me or Irene? There was too many questions and no answers.
"Oh John, I'm so sorry. I never meant for this to happen." I walked over to his beside and reached for his hand. He recoiled at my touch which was understandable. He looked at me and spoke.
Wow. How'd he manage that? - JW
Like I said, a genius - JW
That doesn't explain why. When you're bored you normally take it out on the wall - JW
I was lost in my thoughts, so I never noticed John enter the room. Only when he sat down in his chair, did I acknowledge him. I raised my head staring into his eyes. They were pure and perfect. I would gladly sit for hours getting lost in his gaze. A few moments past, he was starting to look uncomfortable. I took in the rest of his appearance. He was soaked through, and there was a small puddle forming at his feet. I stole a glance at his face which was etched with concern. I didn't like it at all. I wanted the smiling, happy John back. I seemed to take him by surprise when I asked him why he was wet. Apparently it had been raining, I hadn't noticed. Not that it was of importance. I told John to go get changed. I really didn't want him to be ill. I'm no good at caring for people. As he walked away to go upstairs, the words slipped out. I said them to myself and as soon as they left my lips, I wanted to bring them back.  I prayed that he hadn't heard me. I am Sherlock Holmes afterall. The sociopath with no emotion. I thought I saw him pause mid-step, but he carried on upstairs so maybe I got away with it. If he brings it up, I can make an excuse up about being bored. If only that were true.
Sorry if I have - JW
First friend? Really? - JW
"Want something stronger?"
"Don't worry, you're not in trouble. We're friends. You and Sherlock help me on cases, but I suppose I should let him explain that. The other guy who walked out after Sherlock is Mycroft. He's part of the government and Sherlock's older brother." He gave me a small smile. Government and police? What did I get myself into? And since when did I help on crime scenes?
Not really. I was kinda drunk the first time I met him and he hated me. I don't really remember him! - JW
Well sometimes! Anyways, what you doing? - JW
I sorry John. I didn't expect you to be happy about it but I didn't think you'd walk out because of it. - SH
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I sat myself down in one of her dining chairs, preparing myself mentally. Once a coffee was placed in front of me, I told her everything. I don;t know where it all came from but it all came out. I had only planned on telling her about the John/Irene problem. Instead I told her how much I adored John; how I'd been ignoring him and how I'd pissed him off by bringing her home back.
Very funny! Don't you ever go to lectures? - JW
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I didn't know I had to inform you of everything that goes on in my life - JW
"I was just finishing work and they walked past the cafe. Their arms were linked. He hasn't text me in 2 days now."
"Look, if you don't feel the same way that's -" "No." Oh he didn't feel the same way. "Of course I love you Sherlock." My head snapped up. He was grinning at me. "I love you too. Have done for a long time but never knew how to tell you. I never dreamed you'd actually feel the same way." John started laughing which started me off as well. A few of the other tables turned to stare at us but I couldn't care less. John loves me. This evening is definitely going in my mind palace. We spent the rest of the evening giggling and recounting the past few months. I told him about seeing Mrs Hudson and the advice she gave me. John told me about staying at Lestrade's and planning to jump out of a cake. "I would have loved that." He was crying with laughter by the end of the night, we both were. We paid and started walking back to Baker Street. Part way home, John took my hand and held it in his. I felt sparks up my arm from his touch. I couldn't help but grin at John. My John. We eventually arrived at 221b, trying not to wake Mrs Hudson as we crept upstairs. As soon as we reached the living room, I knew something was seriously wrong. All the papers were scattered everywhere, books were tossed about the room, cushions littered the floor. It wasn't a robbery, it was too organised for that. My laptop was open on the coffee table with a message on the screen.
Oh come on! You going to pass up this chance to mess with Mycroft? - JW
I've come to expect the unexpected from you - JW
Save it Sherlock - JW
I think I'm gunna do that. I don't understand how Greg can stand him. He seems so full of himself - JW
Fingers? Where did you get fingers from? - JW
You seemed pretty happy linked up with her the other day - JW
Oh shush! Anyways, I gotta go. Greg's trying to call me. I'll text you later - JW
"Something like that."
Where am I? Why am I in hospital? My head is pounding. I pushed the button next to my bed to call a nurse. Instead a doctor arrived.
"Most likely the latter. I've been thinking me and Sherlock weren't gunna-"
Deduced? Okay wow. - JW
__Incoming Call__
Why don't I believe you? - JW
"Then don't do anything"
I knew it! :) - JW
Haahaa yeah, that's true! Obviously I do but it's not gunna happen for ages considering he won't meet me face-to-face! - JW
They still bugging you about your non-exsistant wife? - JW
Don't! - JW
I cam out of my thinking pose to find that John had fallen asleep. I stared at him; he looked so young and peaceful. I was transfixed and I got up and knelt in front of him. Why was I doing this? I found myself wanting to hold him, to know what it would feel like to have his lips on mine. I backed away quickly, thankful that John had stirred. Where had all these feelings come from? I knew that there was something different about John from the moment I met him. He had found my deductions 'amazing' to quote him, which came as a shock as no-one had accepted me before. I had noticed a shift in the way I regarded John after the pool incident with Moriarty. John had been prepared to die to save me. He tried to save my life. I hadn't given it much thought before, but now I could think clearly. John Watson tried to save me me, Sherlock Holmes. Why? Did I actually mean something to him?
"Sorry. I thought you'd like it. It's fine if you don't, I-I just thought that because you've been down lately it might make you happy."
"To say you're a genius, you can so dumb at times! I love you too! I just figured that..you wouldn't...so"
Once again, the door opened and three men walked in. Not what I was expecting. Maybe they're my friends. The tallest one was apologising for something then he grabbed my hand. I pulled it back and asked him who he is. Going from the look on his face, this wasn't what he wanted to hear. The other two men in the doorway were exchanging glances.
Please tell me you haven't grown...attached to John? - MH
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Lost? I stared at Irene. She just stood there smirking at me. That's when it all fell into place.
You gunna torment Mycroft with this? - JW
"Brother dear-" Mycroft started.
Okay, okay. Calm down! What happens when I text him and he doesn't reply? Or what if he does reply? Do we just pretend none of this happened and carry on where we left it? I couldn't do that. - JW
Deleted it? It gets easier. Besides you're fascinating. The good out-ways the bad with you - JW
Come home - SH
"How was John when you left?"
"Because I love you John. I want you to be happy and I know I'm impossible to live with at times but I wanted you to know how much you mean to me"
The last few words were nothing more than a whisper. Two things were running through my head. Either he didn't like it or he had figured out my feelings towards him. Hopefully it was the former. But what if it was both? Oh no. I don't think I could take that. The silence was crashing down on me, getting to the point where I couldn't breathe. Suddenly, I felt two arms envelop me into a hug. Sherlock rested his forehead on my shoulder. I was paralysed. Sherlock was hugging me. It felt so...meaningful, as if he needed me in that moment. I relaxed into it and wrapped my arms around him. He seemed so vulnerable beneath my hands. His grip around me tightened and I knew that he need to feel protected. I would always be there for him and I hoped he knew that. My arms were starting to ache, as he was taller than me but I refused to let go. It was unspoken and I think neither of us will mention the embrace again, because it was Sherlock's one moment of weakness.
I had a crap night and you cheered me up with the Mycroft and Greg thing. I expect an update on that soon, by the way! - JW
"Who are you?"
"Honestly the last thing I remember is coming to London after being shot in Afghanistan. "
No I really don't! Have you forgiven Mycroft yet? - JW
It felt like forever before the paramedics arrived. They kept asking me questions which I answered numbly. My eyes never left John. This was all my fault. If I'd only explained instead of getting angry but I couldn't risk him being alone. I felt a tap on my arm from a paramedic asking me if I was riding with him. I nodded and followed them out.
Why of all the restaurants on all the nights would Molly be here tonight? She just ruined the moment. How am I suppose to confess everything now? I watched as John politely made conversation with Molly, though I could see he was uncomfortable. I getting more agitated as the minutes ticked by. I'd love to tell Molly to disappear but I know John wouldn't appreciate that. His eyes kept flicking back to mine, seems like he's just as annoyed as me at the interruption. I don't know whether to tell John tonight or just wait til another night? No. If I don't do it soon, I'll just blurt it out which won't be romantic in the slightest. Wait, romantic? Oh John, what have you done to me? I'll stock to my plan but if anything else happens or another interruption, I won't be responsible for my actions.
"Mr Holmes? Mr Watson is awake now. You may see him."
Wife?! But you're only - wait, how old are you? - JW
We sat there drinking our teas whilst I was trying to figure out what was bothering him. God knows what Sherlock was thinking about. I finished my drink and decided to bite the bullet. "Sherlock, what's wrong? I know there's something, so don't lie to me. You know you can tell me anything, right?" I tried to read his face as I asked him this. Something flickered through his eyes but it was replaced with his mask moments later. "Oh well done John. You noticed something's wrong. We must inform Scotland yard of this new genius!" He snapped. I recoiled. Why did he have to shout? I know that he's a sociopath but recently his moods have been getting better and I thought...oh. I guess I had hoped that I had been the cause of the change. These thoughts are getting worse. First his eyes, now this. Yes, I'll admit that his eyes are extraordinary, and that he is an attractive man with his cheekbones and his bouncy brown curls...no. Oh no. I think that I might be attracted to Sherlock. What am I saying? Even if I do fancy Sherlock, there's no way he'd ever like me back. it would unrequited love and that's a dangerous path to go down.
I knew it! - JW
"John." I muttered. He's after me. Well he's after John, if he's taunting the police he is confident he'll succeed. It was Lestrade's turn to look confused.
Yeah I was. Well, I still am but Sherlock's on the case. Hopefully he'll solve whatever's going on soon - JW
I sat for hours trying to box up my emotions and out them in the darkest corners of my mind palace. It proved to be an impossible task. John kept appearing and following me around, talking to me. In the end I decided to give up and find a different way to deal with my problem. I thought about getting high but John would notice and that would lead to awkward questions. Plus he hated it when I was on the drugs and after my last episode, I told myself I would never hurt John in that way again. This only left one option. At least it would numb the pain for a while.
Well you always reply. I just thought you skipped them or something. - JW
Are you asleep? - JW
"Urm...well it depends. Usually just dinner if  it's the first date, or the movies. Since it's you though, I'd say dinner. You do know you have to talk to the other person the whole time, right?"
"Okay, I follow so far. Can I ask you some questions?" He nodded at me.
Hahah! I'm going to sleep now. Goodnight Sherlock - JW
I don't know Sherlock. I'm still angry...why do you think it would be okay that you burnt my stuff? - JW
A.N: Hey guys! I finally finished it! I hope you enjoyed reading it :) I've got plans for a second book if any of you are interested in that! I dunnoh, let me know :) It would slow updates like all my others, but I will try! Anyways, hope you liked this and I will see you later!
If all goes to plan, then tomorrow. I can't really take anymore of it here. I need to get back one way or another. - JW
"Why won't let me? Get your hands off me Sherlock. You can't boss me around." I shrugged out of his grip and headed for the stairs. I heard Sherlock calling after me but I ignored him. I took one step down the stairs when Sherlock grabbed me causing me to lose my balance and fall forwards.
_Incoming Call_
I'd never let them go. But Sherlock let me go. - JW
I shall prey for you! - JW
Oh shush! You truly are a genius - JW
Hey Molly, I need your help. I need to know how to sew - JW
Telling him the truth now would be foolish. "I'm fine John. Just wondering when you could be released. I doubt you want to be here. I'll go speak a doctor." I rose from my chair and started to leave when John spoke.
"There's nothing going on! My laptop was where I left it!"
Sherlock,
I flopped down on the couch, pondering what Mrs. Hudson had said. Had John met someone? With all his previous girlfriends he disappeared, but he always told me. What if he didn't want me to know? That's stupid. "What would stop him telling me" I mumbled to myself. Unless he knows I'll get jealous. Am I jealous though? The idea of John laughing and being happy with someone else, made my chest feel as if there was a huge weight pressing down on it. Yes. I am jealous. I wanted to have John here and hide him away from the world so he would be mine. Only mine. I turned over so my face was in the cushions of the couch. I let out and exasperated sigh. Emotions were definitely not an advantage.
Okay then...about what? - JW
Sorry! Why? What do people normally say? - JW
Yes John. Do keep up - SH
You don't have to call him, a text will do. I know he misses you even if he's too stubborn to say so. I know you miss him - GL
"Sherlock, what the hell is going on?" I shouted, looking around the bombshell of a flat.
I didn't know what to say. I solve crimes with an intelligent, social recluse. That's not what I expecting at all. my mind was reeling from all this information. The one part I couldn't get over was the I was Sherlock's only true friend. The poor man. I couldn't imagine having a gift like that and then have the world shun me for it. No wonder he was so upset when I said I didn't know him, he lost his only friend. I was so deep in thought I didn't notice Sherlock come back in. I only realised when I heard whispered voices. Greg and Sherlock were in the corner muttering to each other.  I coughed to let them know that I was still there.
"And John is your heart." Lestrade finished.
"I can't say for sure but I have never seen him look at anyone else, the way he looks at you. It's as if you're the only thing he can see."
Went okay? Are you serious? - JW
"Good! I'll remind you every other day then."
"John? Why are you wet?"
Why didn't you tell me? - SH
How do we get them back together? - GL
Okay. Fine. - JW
I don't know. I can't decide what's best yet. - JW
"Sherlock, what's going on? What happened to John?" Lestrade questioned. How would I even begin to explain?
It's nearly Christmas! :) - JW
Well, you know how his family are trying to set him up with someone? I think he might actually like them! - JW
How could you not notice?! - JW
Um...hello? Who is this? - JW
He doesn't have friends? - JW
Thank you - SH
I walked into the flat, wondering where John was. Panic started to pulse through me when I realised how long I'd been gone. Where was he? Something can't of happened already, could it? My fears were calmed when I heard John and Mrs Hudson's laughter from the flat below. Thank God. This meant that I could continue to work on a plan to keep John safe. I had been to see Lestrade and Mycroft hoping they could help. Mycroft already had surveillance on John which I asked him to increase. Most of our meeting was spent with him dropping snide comments about John and how 'caring isn't an advantage brother dear'. With a few choice words including 'Lestrade' and 'goldfish' Mycroft reluctantly agreed to increase John's surveillance. After spending spending time with my wonderful brother, I hailed a taxi to Scotland Yard. Marching through the door and up to Lestrade's floor, I was greeted with many choruses of 'Freak'. Ignoring their idiotic hatred towards me I entered the detective inspectors office and shut the door. "Sherlock! Don't you know how to knock? What are you doing here? There isn't a case for you." He rambled, placing his coffee down after nearly spilling it. "Listen. It's John, he's in danger." Lestrade's face fell as I briefly gave him the details. "Moriarty is on the move, I need you to inform me if anything crops up about him, no matter how small." He sat in stunned silence for a while before saying "Yeah, I will. But Sherlock, how are you going to stop him?" Now it was my turn to be silent. I still had no idea what it truly was Moriarty wanted. I'm confident that he wants more than just hurting John to hurt me, but what? I stood up to leave. "I don't know." I answered quietly before shutting the door and leaving. After replaying the day through my head several times, I was sure that John would be safe, if I had to leave him. Moriarty. He burned in my brain, the one puzzle I could never solve. He was more dangerous and fatal than I will admit to anybody. Thankfully before I could spend my night going through theories in my mind palace, John walked through the door. "Where have you been?" He didn't sound angry gratefully. "Lestrade and Mycroft. I had business with them both." Why was it so difficult to speak all of a sudden? "Ah fair enough. Are you planning to eat today? I'm starving." His head appeared from inside the fridge. "Why don't we go out? For dinner I mean." I could feel my face heating up so I turned away, praying that John hadn't noticed.
I don't miss him. - JW
Nodding along to whatever Molly was saying, I kept looking over at Sherlock. He looked really annoyed. I just hope he hasn't given up on what he was planning on saying. This could be it, everything I've been wanting for months. It could also be the opposite, he could of deduced my feelings for him. Oh God, is Sherlock going to kick me out of 221b? No, think positive. I really wish Molly would just go away. "Molly, I'm sorry but me and Sherlock aren't here socially. We have some serious business to discuss." I said staring her down. "Oh I'm so sorry! I'll leave you guys to it then. Bye." She walked off to a table where a guy was sat who looked strangely like Sherlock. Finally, it was just us two again. I stared at Sherlock, he looked scared. There was something else though and I couldn't put my finger on it. "So you were saying?" I asked hopefully, gazing at his beautifully sculpted face, praying it wasn't the last time I'd see it.
"So what?"
Sorry! I meant to tell you but Sherlock is very distracting - JW
"Night, Sherlock."
Fine. I won't forget though :) - JW
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
"I had a fall?" I questioned. I had no recollection.
Me and John discussed cases and my antics for another hour before Lestrade returned.
No...I'm next door. You still haven't answered my question - SH
(Unsent message) Please come home John - SH
Do we need anything? I'm doing the groceries - SH
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I slowly opened my eyes, blinking many times to allow my eyes time to adjust to the bright light, which streamed through the windows. It took a few moments to remember that I was at Greg's, not at the flat. Last night was a bit of a blur. I remember something about a cake and spending too much time discussing Sherlock. As I sat up, my head started throbbing violently. Guess I drunk a little too much. Stumbling slightly as I entered the kitchen, I grabbed a glass of water and downed it in one. I refilled the glass and rummaged around for some ibuprofen.
Ah, of course. Sensitive nature? So it involved one of his beloved royal family. How dull. I listened to the information. Ordinary people are so boring. Someone has taken suggestive pictures and is now using them as blackmail. No, not blackmail. It's a power play, with the most powerful family in Britain. Clever. Might actually be worth my time. Why would anyone call themselves 'The Woman'? Hmm, the case sounds simple enough. Just get the phone with the photos on. Mycroft could do this if he ever got off his arse and did some 'legwork'. He definitely needs it, judging on how many cakes he's devoured this week.
Now I need to start wrapping them...this isn't going to end well - JW
"I'll explain when Mycroft gets here. I'm not going through it twice." I said in a monotone voice.
"And back to my consulting detective"
If you are...please don't - SH
"He was fine. He looked a bit tired though, poor thing. Didn't really listen to what I was saying. Ooh, do you think he's finally found someone? The signs are there he-"
"Yes Mr Watson. Tell me what is the last thing you remember?"
I didn't realise I had actually been giggling. 'Oh, no reason.' I replied. he was studying me; his eyes were glistening. They were one of his best features. Wait...'one of his best features?' Why am I thinking about this? I am not gay! I tore my eyes away from his, a blush creeping up my face.
Sherlock I'm on a date! Stop texting me - JW
The bathroom door opened and John stepped out in just a towel. I knew I wasn't being subtle but I couldn't help but look at him. There were still little beads of water clinging to his toned stomach. His hair was dripping water down his neck, trickling down his shoulders. My eyes drunk in every ounce of this image, he looked flawless. There were no other words for him. I brought my eyes up to his and, quite understandably, he looked uncomfortable. He dashed past me and went upstairs. I made sure that that scene would be forever etched in my mind palace.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
"Hahah! Bless him, of course he did. Sherlock, as much as I like talking to you, it's nearly three in the morning."
Oh great. I got arsey with him for nothing! Well not nothing, he was being a complete arse - JW
"Is everything okay Sherlock?" He seemed to care, though to him, he barely knows me.
Hahahah! It is! I'm sure newspapers would pay lots for this story! Maybe I'll have to be interviewed on TV? - JW
I heard about his 'rough times' I guess I'll just wait until he wants to meet. How do you know him? - JW
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
See? I come up with all the best ideas! - JW
I'll speak to him - GL
"John."
What's your plan then? - JW
"Yeah."
Go screw yourself Greg! - JW
I called Sherlock. Apperently I  kept saying he had a pretty voice - JW
"You live at 221b Baker Street, with Sherlock. You're flatmates."
"Obviously. Excuse me, I have to get ready for a date."
"Hahah! Best behaviour? Since when have you cared about your behaviour?"
I hope so! No not really, there's another guy involved. Jim. They take me to a warehouse and talk about Sherlock and how Irene is going to make him hers - JW
Yep. Definitely worried. - JW
Okay Mr. Know-it-all. You experiment with body parts? It sounds creepy - JW
It's okay. Glad you like it! I did it because you said how crappy Christmas was for you so I thought I'd make you something that might make you smile, even if it was only for a moment - JW
Shut up John - SH
Lovely. Bye! :) - JW
Not sure he knows how to react! He said 'I don't know what to say to that' - JW
"Sherlock?"
Oh dear. No good. It means that no matter how mean you are to her, she's not gunna give up. She's decided she wants you, so she's definitely going to try everything to get you - JW
You never fail to make me smile - JW
So...how are you today? - JW
Sibling rivalry, now we're getting somewhere! - JW
A compliment and smiley face?! Is it my birthday? Ooh, have fun! Good luck! - JW
How are you? - JW
Leave it to me - MH
Sherlock? - JW
Sherlock I've just had the weirdest conversation with your brother! - JW
"Hi. Nice to meet you." I forced a smile. An awkward silence settled upon us. What now? I was thankful when Irene excused herself, not before kissing Sherlock's cheek. We were alone. I had to go. Clear my head. I walked over to my coat, shrugging it on.
__Incoming call___
"Then he walked out and Irene is still upstairs and I have no idea what to do." I finished. Mrs. Hudson just smiled at me before saying
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
"It's half 12. It would be idiotic going out now."
Yes you do. I've seen you moping about these past weeks. You need each other. Just one text? - GL
You deduced her, didn't you? You aren't always nice - JW
You? Doing the shopping? - JW
Yeah but you love me anyway! - JW
We'll have to get Sherlock in on it too but I was thinking what if you and me switched places? - JW
Fair enough. Sorry for ignoring you the past couple of days - JW
It's Lestrade's name - JW
Now I just feel awful! I'm an awful friend! I should have known something was up - JW
_Incoming Call_
"It's okay Sherlock, honestly. They haven't hurt me. Not that they're not capable. Anyway, listen. There's lots I need to tell you and I don;t know how long I have. After the voicemail, I did as it said, the next day nothing happened. The day after however, I received another. Asking me to cut down my hours at the cafe due to 'family business' so I did. Then we met. Irene brought me to an abandoned warehouse somewhere nearby. She questioned me for hours about you, wanting every piece of information I could give her. I told her that despite how much we talk, I don't know you half as well as she believes I do. She didn't take kindly to that. A guy came out of the shadows and told Irene that I was speaking the truth. He was Irish and I think he called himself Jim. The take me to the warehouse everyday and Irene brags about all the things you two have done together. I'll be going there again tonight."
I still can't believe they want you to marry someone even though you're sixteen! That's unreal! - JW
"Nothing, obviously. It's Sherlock. I have no chance, actually scratch that, I have less than 0% chance with him."
I need you to give him something - JW
Well that shift was awful! So many awkward customers! - JW
_Disconnected_
Please speak to me. It's been a week now... - SH
"Mr Watson is still unconscious but stable. We've an x-ray and a MRI scan and we're waiting on the results. You should be able to see him soon. If there are any developments we'll let you know Mr Holmes." He turned and left the private waiting room. I couldn't feel anything anymore. What if John never woke up? It would all be my fault. If something happens to John I wouldn't be able to take it.
"John, what do people do on a date?"
"I'm an idiot, remember?"
"Myc? Really?"
John and Mrs Hudson sat for hours talking about complete nonsense such as the weather and the neighbours. I was unbelievably bored by the tedious conversation, so I went to seek solace in the silence of my room. Staring up at the ceiling, old voices starting whirring around my head. 'Caring is not an advantage' 'Freak!' 'Just go and kill yourself, Sherlock!' The sounds of my school days and Mycroft were taunting me. 'Just lock them away' I muttered to myself. They were shouting at me now. 'John? really brother dear?' 'The freak's in love, guys!' 'You know that John will never love you. Look at you! No-one will love you.' I sat bolt upright. Were they right?John is the only one willing to accept me. That implies he cares for me. He's straight though. He's just your friend and friend's care for each other. Stupid, stupid, stupid Sherlock! Had I actually mistaken John's caring attitude for something more? Obviously. Pathetic. Get a grip. I need to lock down these feelings and things will be the same as before.
Hey Sherlock - JW
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Hi Sherlock. It's John from last night. Greg gave me your number - JW
"And how do you say I do that?" I quizzed.
Oh okay. Are you two together now? - JW
"I'm protecting him." It came out in a whisper.
"Where do I live?"
To you maybe. Have you ever been on a date? - JW
Not this again! No I haven't. Before you ask, no, I'm not texting him - JW
No good points? Have these people met you? You are amazing, incredible and perfect. Don't listen to them, Sherlock - JW
Heeeyy! - JW
Yeah, I do actually. We text a lot, why? - JW
Yeah, why? - JW
I don't know. He spent a couple of nights on my sofa but then said he'd found somewhere to stay. He wouldn't tell me where - GL
So back to you being a Scrooge - JW
"You should go and change out of those clothes. You'll get sick. I'll make us a cup of tea."
~~~~~~~~~~~~
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
"People are dying?" I quizzed.
"Sherlock! Our flat has been trashed! You can't tell me nothing is going on!" I yelled back. His door creaked open. He stood there expressionless.
"Hmm."
No reason - SH
I don't believe you - JW
Plan? What plan? - JW
I'll pass thanks :) I prefer Sherlock anyway - JW
"See you in 5"
_Disconnected_
Hey Greg, will you be seeing Sherlock before Christmas day? - JW
As a matter of fact, yes. But nothing like that happened! - JW
Sorry I didn't text you last night. Was dead after work! You met the girl yet? - JW
Am great thanks! - JW
Then why on earth are they on about wives? Its insane! - JW
You jealous that I'm gunna be rich soon? - JW
So it's just for a case. I felt a massive weight lift off my chest and a wave of elation rolled over me. They're not together! And he finds her annoying! Things couldn't be more perfect right now. Well, they could. I could actually be with Sherlock but the fact that he's still unattached is good enough for me. Sherlock is also talking to me again as well. I guess we're both going to pretend that the month long silence didn't happen, which I'm not complaining about. I'm just happy to have my friend back.
"What is it Sherlock, dear?"
Thank you for tonight - JW
Hey Greg! How's you? - JW
Thank you :) - JW
Oh Sherlock! You don't need to give me anything. You being my friend is enough - JW
Why is he killing random people?" I was confused. Moriarty would cause havoc but there was usually a pattern to it. He didn't kill people just for the fun of it.
"Right hand cupboard."
Hey. You heard from him yet? - GL
Okay. So what's next? - JW
Obviously - JW
Typical. - SH
"Are you coming back then? To Baker Street?"
Don't worry, I love you anyways Sherlock! - JW
"Don't. Just don't. I don't need nor want a lecture from you right now." I sighed. "I wasn't going to Sherlock. What I was going to say is John needs you. You have to keep him safe. You need to restore his memory, make him remember Sherlock." Mycroft was staring out of window, purposefully avoiding my gaze.
Oh dear, she was still here. "Yes?"
"Why are you laughing?"
"Wait, wait. I shot the cabbie and saved your life after only knowing you a day?" He looked utterly in shock.
Cocky too! Be sure to trip Irene up for me! Gotta go grab my bus now! Probably text you after college. Byes! - JW
"Brother dear, Inspector Lestrade. What's the situation?" Mycroft spoke, sounding as if he'd rather be anywhere but here.
So is John. How do I get him back, Mycroft? - SH
I was thinking that we should meet up - JW
How about 'lock? - JW
Nope. I was just waiting for you to start the conversation for once - JW
Sherlock retreated to his room, leaving me stunned in the Kitchen. Sherlock? A date? With who? Questions were running through my mind. I couldn't, wouldn't believe he was going on a date. 'This confirms he doesn't like you.' Shut up. 'Sherlock's off with someone else. He's replaced you.' Replaced me? Even my thoughts were against me. What if it goes well and they end up together? NO! I can't lose Sherlock, but who am I tell him otherwise? If he wants to date someone, he can. Nothing I can do. He'll probably take them on cases. They'll run around London chasing criminals without me. 'You'll be left behind.' Story of my life. Everyone's fine with me til someone better comes along. I thought Sherlock was different though, I guess not.
To you, they probably are. We can't all be amazing genius', can we? Anyways, I'll text you later otherwise I'll be late. Bye! - JW
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Because that's what people do. I really like this girl. Her name is Mary - JW
I was going to replace it - SH
And that's all I said? Oh thank God! I was expecting something terrible. I can live with that! Besides, it's true - JW
I'm trying but he won't talk to me - SH
"Hahahah! Fine, fine! How do you fell about ice skating?"
John looked astonished for a brief moment then continued reading. I guess it must be strange to read about your life when you don't recall any of it yourself.
I blanched. He didn't remember me.
I continued upstairs smiling to myself. I couldn't figure out what he meant but it made me happy so I decided not to dwell on it. I was relieved to finally get into some dry clothes. I made it back to the living room and saw Sherlock had kept his word and made me a cuppa. Sinking into my chair, I took a sip and was grateful for the hot liquid which was now warming me from the inside. I tried to avoid looking at Sherlock but I couldn't help it. His eyes were like magnets, drawing me in. I got lost in my own world and the events from the day. Then I remembered...the book! How could I forget? That was the reason I went out in the first place. I paused, thinking about my earlier revelation. Would Sherlock take the book, thinking it meant more? Did it mean more, now I knew how I felt about him? Not really. It is still a gift to cheer up my friend. My feelings for Sherlock don't need to come into it. I think that he'll be happy with it, no matter what the reason. I got up, making Sherlock start.
No shit Sherlock - JW
Lestrade arrived just as the doctor was explaining what tests they were doing.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Why is that interesting? They're just friends - JW
Why what? - JW
I don't sulk. - SH
Didn't you like it? - JW
John returned to the living room, dry and in a change of clothes. He was wearing the black and white jumper; I always liked him in that one. I had made him a cup of tea and placed it by his chair. I sat in my chair with my coffee still trying to figure out John. I used to be able to deduce him easily, but I'm at a loss now. We were both trapped in a silent staring contest. Both in our own worlds.
I moved from room to room around the apartment. I was bored. I collapsed on the couch, staring at the mess around me. Case files, notebooks and the remnants of past experiments litter all the surfaces. I knew John would be annoyed when he got back from work. He hates it when he has to clean up after me. A sudden sinking feeling gripped me. Why was I feeling this? Guilt. I felt guilty. Why? I quickly pushed it out of my mind.
"Sherlock! What the hell are yo-"
No. Come home - SH
Oh dear! Not too happy about this... - JW
We need milk. And biscuits - JW
"And that's how I ended up here." I finished. Greg had sat silently throughtout, allowing me to spill everything to him. We sat quietly as I watched him trying to process all the information.
Are you coming home tonight? - SH
Why don't you just ask him? - JW
Yeah! Just be your obnoxious self and you'll be fine! - JW
Picking up my violin, I decided to distract myself by getting lost in the music. I started playing, pouring my emotions into the melody. I feared that if anyone heard it, then they would know who it's for. I stopped playing at that thought. The one person who I would let listen to it, was out with a woman who could make him happy in a way I couldn't. John would never be happy with me. He's usually angry with me because I've done something or stepped over some imaginary line. That isn't happiness. Why does he put up with me? We're friends. My only friend and I'll probably push him away because I'll undoubtedly do something to tip him over the edge. I was stood motionless staring at the carpet. The darkness had crept in to the flat, noticed by me. I switched on a lamp and my attention was caught by the note John had left. A surge of unwanted feelings bubbled up inside me. I crumpled it up and curled up in my chair.
"Mr Watson, I'm afraid you were shot 3 years ago. You have amnesia. I'll do a few checks but I'm sure it is temporary. There are some people waiting to see you. Let me know when you are ready to see them." He disappeared after that. Amnesia? Great. I've lost the last 3 years of my life. What did I do? Do I have a girlfriend or a family? No, probably not. Although a lot can happen in that amount of time. Maybe the people people who are waiting for me can give me some answers. I hope so.
"Whoa! Okay. No need to beg. I won't give up on him. It's just difficult when he's linking up with a perfect brunette."
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If he hadn't of said my name, I would of presumed he was speaking to himself. Sherlock turned to look at me and I was caught off guard by his eyes. Dammit! Answer him. I mentally shook myself and replied.
Should I be worried? - JW
The doctor flicked through his notes and looked puzzled.
I had a date with Irene Adler. It wasn't difficult. I knew she 'had a thing for me' as John would say. John. I don't know what's going on anymore. Are we to spend forever walking on eggshells, avoiding conversation? I hope not. I miss him. Stopping him from coming on cases was one of the worse ideas I've had. I keep hearing him making comments as I wondered around crime scenes. There was no-one to listen to my deductions and the skull was starting to attract attention.
John. John? So now you're ignoring me? - SH
Wow. I mean...wow. How the hell did you know all that? I only met you last night! -JW
He looked disappointed with me. Like he expected me to know exactly what he was on about. Like he'd completely forgotten he hasn't taken me on any cases in  over a month. I saw the realisation hit his face, he quickly adjusted it back and explained.
Hahah! Really? That's brilliant! How did you find out? - JW
Oh yeah. Any closer to finding out the secret? - JW
Urgh. My head - JW
Sherlock just stopped as soon as we reached the top of the stairs. Someone had torn the flat apart looking for something. Who knows what, unless Sherlock had some government secrets hidden here? No, he wouldn't hide them if he did. Sherlock's laptop was in the middle of the table, switched on. Before I could ask anything he snatched up the computer and walked into his room, shutting the door behind him. What the hell was going on? What was on his laptop? Did Irene do this? That seem likely but there's no reason. Sherlock said there was no pictures or a case, so why?
As I relived the past 4 weeks Sherlock came in, grabbed his coat and waltzed out again. 'The same as usual' I thought bitterly. Sherlock had stopped taking me on cases for whatever reason. Wish he would say one word to me. Just one word. Does he even remember I exist or has he deleted me?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I didn't mean it like...dammit! - JW
What about Sherly? - JW
Why does it matter to you? From what I've heard you two hate each other - JW
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
"Yeah sure. Sherlock?"
You didn't come back last night. - SH
Oh, urm...okay I guess. - JW
No - JW
_Disconnected_
"Sherlock and Irene. God, they do look perfect together."
Nothing. I just wondered how you'd react - JW
"No. I won't go to bed. i want answers. If we weren't robbed then what was the point of tearing everything apart? Also what was on your laptop? Was this Irene?" We were practically shouting in each other faces now.
I sat in the chair besides John's bed. I knew Lestrade had left so me and John could talk but what are we supposed to talk about? Lestrade told me I should act natural around John but what if he hates me? What if he decides that he doesn't like the sort of person I am and doesn't want to know me anymore? I had to stop all of these 'what if's' running through my mind, so I turned my attention to the man lying in front of me. He was bruised and obviously in pain but hiding it well. It's clear he has no idea why he's here except for the fact he had a fall. I just prey John gets his memory before anything terrible happens. John spoke, breaking me out of my train of thought.
"I need to get away from you."
"I don't want to spoil the surprise but all I can say is I wish I could see it!"
You definitely should! Imagine them together! - JW
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I don't know! Why don't you text him? - GL
Really? That's good I guess! - JW
"It all started about 2 months ago..."
Okay. I get it. I'll text him - JW
"Fine! Once a week?"
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Oh...does this mean that you're not planning to come back to the flat? - SH
I'm not having this argument with you Sherlock - JW
"It's about John, isn't it? I heard him go out last night. You two have a domestic?"
Hey Sherl - JW
I walked up the stairs, a trail of water behind me. The living room was lit by one lamp in the corner. It gave the room an eerie glow and cast elongated shadows on the walls. Sherlock was sat in his chair, knees tucked under his chin. He looked like a lost child. I forgot about how cold I was and that I was soaked because I needed to help Sherlock. He looked so...helpless. Something in my chest tightened. I hated seeing him like this. He hadn't moved when I entered the flat but I didn't want to alarm him so I moved slowly towards him. I sat in my chair across from him, his eyes were cast downwards. The note I had written earlier was crumpled on the floor. What had happened while I was out?
Oh that sucks! Can't you escape anywhere? - JW
"John...?"
Good question. I thought for a few moments then answered.
Doesn't matter. Got to go, am getting ready for a date - JW
Does he know this? - GL
How do you know where I....Mycroft's still spying on me? - JW
"He put it in his note to me. He knows we'll have to investigate every murder so he wants the police all over, using our resources elsewhere so he can 'claim his prize'."
And I have just been informed that your new laptop has arrived - SH
"Yes, the first might. I mean your first night. You moved in earlier that day."
Lovely! - JW
Brother mine, how are you? - MH
Sherlock - JW
I had barely reached the door of 221B when 3 gunshots were fired. I ran up the stairs, taking then two at a time. Various scenarios ran through my head as I reached the living room. Sherlock was stood on the coffee table shooting at the now bullet filled smiley face.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I awoke to sunlight streaming through the window and the sounds of a violin coming from below. I laid for a while listening to Sherlock play. The song seemed to be dripping with emotion. It was sad, mournful and slow, then it changed and became hopeful. After Sherlock stopped playing I decided to get up. I made my way downstairs to find Sherlock was sat on the floor, violin laying beside him. "Sherlock? You okay?" He jumped up at the sound of voice making his dressing gown fly off in odd angles. "Morning John! You want a cup of tea? What am I saying, of course you do!" Sherlock scurried off into the Kitchen and busied about with cups. I knew something was wrong, he is never this bright and cheerful in the morning. And since when did Sherlock make tea? I decided to wait and see if he would talk to me first. He returned with our drinks and took his seat opposite me. I kept trying to steal glances at him without alerting him but his eyes never seemed to leave me.
Obviously. - JW
He just asked how you were. I told him you were fine. He said he'd be in touch though - JW
Okay. See you there - JW
Oh that's mean, I like it! - JW
I was getting restless. This is stupid! Why won't Sherlock acknowledge me? What if he's finally bored of me? I'd have to leave Baker Street. This is my home. I don't want to leave but we can't continue like this. I spent hours deliberating over ways to make Sherlock speak to me until I drifted off.
"Nope! Hahah! You've missed me annoying you, haven't you?"
It's okay. It just sucks, you know? - JW
Oh, right. Yeah, well he's fine. - JW
Do you have to say something? - JW
I can't talk to him Greg! He doesn't care about me. Why should I call him? - JW
"Hey Sherlock. It went okay. They were pretty quiet tonight. Normally, they're very loud and always laughing. They did a little at the start when Irene was recapping her day with you but then they were whispering a lot. From what I gathered, whatever they're planning, it's gunna happen within a week."
John. I didn't mean to grab him like that but I couldn't let him leave. It's too dangerous. I stood in horror as he fell down both flights of stairs and crumple in a heap at the bottom. He's not moving. Oh God. Rushing to him, I made sure he was breathing and phoned an ambulance. Please let him be okay. If he's not, I don't even want to think about it.
Yes, yes. How do I get him back? It doesn't feel right without him here - SH
John? - SH
Ooh, coffee dates and private study sessions? Sounds serious to me! ;) - JW
"Nope! I really wanna see your face! Maybe I'll sneak over there and film it!"
Out. I told you. - JW
Yes. Yes you are - JW
Oh - JW
"Can you have your argument later? John is still in danger, Moriarty is more dangerous than ever and time is of the essence now!" That shut them up. Lestrade started saying that Moriarty had the police running in circles when another doctor walked in.
"You're not a detective yet, you know!"
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Fine - SH
Why am I in my chair? I was hugging John and now I'm here. I must have drifted into my mind palace again. From the Kitchen I could hear the kettle boiling and some other noise. I strained my ears to figure out the source. Laughter? Why was John laughing? Creeping over to the Kitchen, as not to alert John, I saw him bent over the counter in a fit of giggles. I have always liked John's laugh. It's so cheerful, care free and contiguous. I have found myself before laughing along with him, even when I don't know what started him off in the first place. The corners of my mouth began to twitch upwards. No! Stop it. I thought I was suppose to be distancing myself, not bothering with all this sentimental stuff. I calmed myself down and asked John as to why he was laughing. Apparently, he'd been thinking about how absurd it is that we chase criminals across London. We have both discussed this many times, mainly because I find it fascinating how John is so accepting of it all. Sure, he was in the army but that is nothing like what we do now. Some of the skills are transferable which is why I let him move in in the first place. An ex-army doctor is much more likely to accept my way of life than a shop assistant. When I first laid eyes on John, I knew all about his life and past but I could of never deduced what sort of he'd be. John will do anyhting for anyone at anytime.
Yup. But I'm your idiot and you can't get rid of me! - JW
Hi Sherlock. Yeah I have. - JW
Has Sherlock spoke to you yet? - MH
I dunnoh! They're planning something and I'm pretty sure it involves Sherlock. By threatening me, I think they wanted to isolate him. Make him think he had no-one and then Irene would swoop in and save him - JW
Even though I knew he just needed someone I couldn't help my heart rate increasing as I breathed in scent. There was no way to describe it. It was just Sherlock. It was comforting to me. I knew that my feelings were growing out of control this whole time and I wanted nothing more than to show him I'm the only one he'll ever need. Pulling him into a kiss would prove that, but right now he needed a friend. My chest constricted painfully at the thought of us being nothing more than friends. But if that's what he needs; that's what I'll be.
Okay then. Just be careful! - JW
"John." Sherlock breathed. The way he stared at me, was innocent enough but there was a deep sadness in his eyes.
Opening my door as quietly as I could, I snuck into the bathroom clicking the lock behind me. I didn't want John walking in. I rummaged in the cabinet and my fingers touched the cold metal of the blade. I sat perched on the edge of the bath, my sleeves rolled up. My eyes danced over my old scars from before. I had stopped when I met John because he was my new release. If he ever found out, he would leave Baker Street. He would leave anyway if he found out about my feelings for him. This way, I could hide my scars and keep my John. I hesitated for a moment before dragging the razor across my wrist. I watched as the blood rose to the surface and started dripping down. I repeated the process again and again, trying to purge myself of these feelings.
"And you're here, why?"
Yeah that's true! Has Mycroft met her? - JW
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Help? How on earth can you help? Can you fix my mothers broken nose? Can you help cover up all the bruises that I'm coming back with? Can you get my sister to come back home? No. You can't do any of that. No-one can. Look Sherlock, these are my problems and I have to deal with them. So please, just let me deal with them. - JW
No I don't - SH
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When you said that you were coming home to pack up and leave, I thought of every possibility to try and make you stay. I wanted to explain and say how I'd done it for you...even if it didn't seem like it to you. I really do care John. It really hurt me when you said that I don't. I've always done things to make you happy but I don't think they worked because you didn't notice. All I want is for you to smile and be happy. If that is away from me then so be it but just remember .....I love you. I love you John Watson - SH
"I knew it! I've missed your 'I-know-everything-about-anything' attitude."
Is that a bad thing? - JW
"I'm not letting you leave." I drew myself up to my full height.
Oh, don't try and deny it! You're jealous of my superior intellect - JW
So Lestrade isn't your goldfish? - SH
_ Disconnected_
I'll be working at the coffee shop just opposite college. I doubt I can text and serve drinks - JW
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
They both began bickering at each other. They were having a domestic in the middle of the waiting room. I had to intervene otherwise they would go on for hours.
Fair enough. Just make sure you don't get too caught up in trying to find out the secret - JW
I know what you mean. It's so difficult! My dad is the worst. No matter I get it will be wrong. Hopefully we get a Christmas this year - JW
"Fine! Fine! Yes. Sherlock 'suspects' that Mycroft may have a slightly huge obsession with you"
Don't be idiotic - MH
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
WHAT?!? - JW
"What are you doing, John?"
That's true! Never been so nervous over giving someone a gift! I can already feel the judgement! - JW
Okay. I'm going to go. Have fun thinking. - JW
"Why not just tell John how you feel?" So much for the words of wisdom I came for.
Hey Sherlock - JW
I glanced in the mirror just before I left the flat, I noticed I looked awful. I felt awful too. Why should I though? I'm going on a date, John does it all the time. So why do I feel bad? I need to stop thinking that I have a chance with John. That was the a problem. I was hoping for a chance with him, which was causing me to doubt myself. No! I finally have an interesting case, I can't have any distractions. I needed to block out John so I could focus on winning Miss Adler's affection. This was going to be a long night.
You know it! ;) - JW
Agreed. I refuse to leave my bed today! - JW
Exactly! Obviously we'll tell him afterwards. Want to meet for lunch and we'll get Sherlock in on it too? - JW
(Unsent Message) Please John....I need you. I'm lonely without you here - SH
We should set them up! On a blind date! Yeah! - JW
"Not sure. I only caught parts of it but I'm pretty sure at one point Jim said 'Don't worry, it'll happen within a week.' I presume they were talking about the plan, anyway."
__Disconnected__
"Oh god yes!"
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Okay....I stopped taking cases you know. It didn't feel right without my blogger - SH
"I did it. I made John fall, it's my fault." They both looked stunned. I began recounting the events of the evening to them both, never meeting either of their gazes. Once I had finished there was silence until Mycroft spoke.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
We stared at each other, silently understanding the gravity of the situation. There was cough from the room, I had almost forgotten where we were. So had Lestrade going off his wide eyes.
Yup. Mycroft gave me another phone so I can keep in touch with you guys - JW
Did you mean what you said? - JW
Morning Sherlock :) - JW
Yes. For one, you're being set up with Irene which is wrong in itself. Two, we don't know how dangerous this person could be! - JW
"Had to go to China for the tea?" I quipped back, making John snigger.
Thanks Mols! Don't where I'd be without you! - JW
Fair point. But what if it didn't? - JW
"If you say so."
Classy? Now I'm scared! - JW
"Well sit down dear and I'll pop the kettle on."
You're Sherlock! You always have something to say! So why not text first? - JW
That's different. My patients will be alive unlike yours - JW
Anything - JW
Yup! - JW
"Really?"
"John. The thing is, well I urm. Let me explain to you what you mean to me. You are my light, you pull me out of the dark places that haunt my mind. You keep me grounded so I don't go running my mouth and deduce at the wrong moments. Most of all though, you made me human. You have made me feel things, John, that I thought I would never feel in my lifetime. What I'm trying to say, what I've been trying to say for months, is I love you. I pray that those feelings are reciprocated in some capacity or at the very least, don't leave Baker Street. I need you in my life even if it is a purely platonic relationship we share." I studied him but his expression was blank. A few moments passed and he still hadn't said anything or moved in the slightest. "John?" Still nothing. "Say something, anything." Slowly his eyes, which had been previously fixated on a napkin, met mine. "You love me?" He whispered. "Unconditionally." Once again silence fell between us. I knew he was working things through in his mind but minutes felt like hours. All I wanted was an answer. Any would do now, anything to stop the tension and bring me out of this limbo.
Wow. That was insightful...and beautiful. - JW
Oh really? That doesn't surprise me to be honest. how are things with you and 'Myc'? - JW
_Incoming Call_
Ew! Stop it! - JW
"Look, I'm sorry. You obviously know who I am but I have no recollection of you. Of any of you. I seem to have lost the last three years." I finished. They all knew me, I felt kind of bad that I didn't remember them. The tallest one was completely blank, he had no emotion on his face.
"So he's home with Irene now?"
Yes. Yes you do - JW
Morning Sherlock! It's finally the last day of college! - JW
You still mad at me? - SH
Yeah that's true! Are those two together yet? - JW
No. - JW
Who? - JW
I don't know how long I had sat there, trying to get my feelings under control but after a while I realised I couldn't feel my legs. I got up shakily and wondered into the Kitchen. What should I do? Do I tell him? No. John was straight. I went to my room, closing the door behind me. I knew if I had stared at John, I would have given in to my emotions and kissed him, and if he'd of woken up...I knew it was for the best just to lock down these feelings and continue as normal.
"I got your texts you know. I really wanted to reply but I didn't want to risk it. Hope you didn't think I was ignoring you because I wouldn't do that."
Stupid. Stupid. Stupid. True to my word, I had pushed John out and I hated myself for it. I could see what it was doing to him. Yet I still continued to do so. He wasn't supposed to act this way! John was supposed to get angry and scream and shout, not sit in his chair looking sorrowful! Was he doing this on purpose? I doubt it. I know he blames himself, which is stupid obviously. Oh John. I'm sorry. If only you knew.
Perfect? Oh God. What are you leaving out? And don't say you're not because I know you are! - JW
"I've ordered some men to keep a 24 hour surveillance on the hospital and Greg is getting some men to guard Dr Watson's room because, in case you've forgotten Sherlock, Moriarty is still after him."
Do you hate me? - SH
John? Are you leaving forever? - SH
Yep. Now tell me about yourself - JW
We had been in the same position for at least 5 minutes now and I had completely lost all feeling in my arms now. I loosened them from around Sherlock's neck and he made no movement. I gently nudged him, nothing. Sherlock is the only person who could hug someone and disappear into his mind palace. He can stay in there for hours and not realise. I'm not going to take that risk. I unravelled our limbs and sat him down in his chair, there was no sign of life so I decided to leave him to it. Placing the kettle on to boil, my mind drifted away to reminisce about our little adventures around London. A smile forced it's way through and not before long, I was in hysterics about the whole thing. I hadn't noticed how loud I was being until I heard his familiar voice.
You're just proving me right! - JW
"You'd know all about not caring, wouldn't you Mycroft?" He said bitterly.
Don't get all sulky on me - JW
"I guess I would have but we'll never know now, will we?" I smiled at John. This could work. Maybe he wouldn't hate me after all.
He wasn't that bad. Sherlock's alright once you get past the whole 'I know everything about anyone and anything' After that he nice :) - JW
"No it bloody wasn't! Stop lying to me Sherlock!" Tonight was going so well, why is this happening? Sherlock just stood there glaring silently at me.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
"But ice skating is so good!You get all bundled up in hats and scarves and it's just so fun!"
"I suppose...what is it with the Holmes'?"
"Nothing." Really? That's the response I get?
"...what?"
Hey Sherlock. How are you? - JW
Me, you and Lestrade at Speedy's at half 11. - JW
"No actually. Had to speak to Mycroft." He looked annoyed, although my brother had that affect on everyone. There is definitely something going on between them but neither would admit to anything. Especially not Mycroft with his 'caring is not an advantage' garbage. If our current situations were switched, I have a suspicion Mycroft wouldn't leave Lestrade's side.  Although he could as easily walk away and pretend there was nothing going on between them. Either way, at least Lestrade remembered John's tea.
"Stop it!"
Well, someone kept me up til the early hours of the morning, so I'm extremely tired - JW
"Yes, I found out last week. Mycroft put me on a case involving a woman named Irene. Except she was working with Moriarty. He apparently wants me heart." I shouldn't be saying any of this but he I guess needs must. There was no point in trying to hide the truth anymore, especially if Lestrade had also received a message from Moriarty too.
I shot up and practically ran to the door. John is okay! He's actually okay. I'll make it up him once he's safe. Lestrade and Mycroft were following me down the corridor, still quietly bickering at each other. The doctor showed me the room and I saw John. He looked awful. Bruising had started to form all over his arms, neck and face.
What had changed? Not 10 minutes ago he was hugging me and now he's being...well Sherlock. But worse.
He completely took me by surprise.
I wondered around my mind palace for a while but it didn't relieve the boredom. I scanned the room again and saw it glinting in the weak afternoon sun. The gun. That would be fun.
Whilst these thoughts were running through my mind, I had started to smile at John. He truly was an infectious man. Looking at him now, and watching the way the florescent lights of the Kitchen made his eyes look like to giant orbs gazing up at me, made me want to forget everything and just laugh along with him. The voice in my head made itself known again. 'You could just reach over and grab him. Just lean over and embrace him. Make him yours, once and for all.' Could I? What would happen? I'm sure John wouldn't appreciate me diving on top of him and enveloping him in my arms...wait. I have to stop this. I need to stop this. I need John to hate me so I don't have to love him anymore. I replied to John in my most deadpan voice. His face dropped instantly. I hated myself for doing this to him, but in the long run this will be for the best. If not, I know my feelings for my blogger will escalate even more to a point where I act on them. I do that and John will leave. Which is not preferable. I know there is a part of me which hopes John feels the same and I would give anything for that but in reality, John believes we're just friends and that's how it will stay in order to keep him.

"Okay, another one. You said me and Sherlock help on cases. What do we do?"
"Yes. I mean, I don't know"
You really have an answer to everything, don't you? - JW
"Afraid not, Sherlock! Your gunna have so much fun!"
You realise that makes you sound like some sort if Frankenstein? - JW
The words seemed innocent enough so why had Sherlock looked away? Did he mean something by 'we should go out?'. After a few moments, I grabbed my coat and said yes. Sherlock beamed at me then jumped up and started wrapping his scarf around his neck. I had no idea where we were going but I didn't care. I was happy just to spend some time with Sherlock, just me and him outside of the flat. After the whole Irene thing, I've felt me and Sherlock have kind of drifted slightly. He seems distant like he does when he's on a case but I know for a fact that he's not working on one. Not from Lestrade anyway. Unless Mycroft gave him one? Is that the business they had together? Sherlock would never go willing and visit his brother, unless Sherlock was in danger or needed government help. Oh please tell me Sherlock isn't meddling in things above himself again. Wrapped up in my thoughts once again, I hadn't paid attention where we were walking. I was quite surprised when we stopped in front of Angelo's. We haven't been here since the day I moved in. The memory came flooding back. I'm sure that's when my feelings for Sherlock started and it's all because of this place. I wonder if Sherlock regards the restaurant the same way I do? I doubt it. A high functioning sociopath with sentiment? It's unheard of. I'm certain he's chosen this place just for the food, not for the memories. Sherlock left me at the door as he went to go fond Angelo, I watched him as he whispered to Angelo who looked extremely happy and kept glancing in my direction. I just smiled awkwardly back at him and kept my head down. They both returned and Angelo showed us a table which was the same one we had the first time. Sherlock sat himself down and smiled sheepishly at me. Does this mean something? Are we on a date? I would love for that to be true but it's impossible. Though the smiles Angelo was giving me, the hushed whispers between the two of them, this table...it can't all be a coincidence. Does Sherlock like me? "Sherlock, what's all this about?" I maintained eye contact with him which was difficult. "Well John. I was going to bring this up later but since you mentioned it, there is something I want to discuss with you. I want to tell you that I-" Sherlock's words were drowned out by Molly Hooper shouting us both and coming over. Sherlock just shut up and stared at the table. Oh God. Was this it? What was he gunna say? I hope he tells me later, I know Sherlock has the tendency to clam up after he's worked up the courage to do something and it doesn't go to plan. Damn you Molly!
Gone out for some air.
I nodded to her and she went to my room. I wasn't going to sleep anyway, with John gone. Why was he waiting up for me? It didn't make sense. None of it did. I kept running countless questions through my mind, never getting any closer to an answer. I text John a few times and rung him, no reply. He was either injured or really pissed off at me. Hopefully the latter. As the night dragged on, my thoughts became increasingly more insane. Images of John laying in a ditch; being stabbed and John's dead body flooded my mind. I felt sick. I needed to know if he was safe. I text Molly and Lestrade in case he'd gone to theirs. Molly hadn't seen him but thankfully he was at Lestrade's. Least he was off the streets. It feels as if I'm slowly losing him. I fear one I'll look around and he'll of slipped through my fingers.
I've missed this - JW
Hahahahah! That's brilliant! You won't tell anyone though? About me? - JW
Why? - JW
Why don't you tell him all of this? - GL
I heard the front door open, I breathed a sigh of relief. Finally! Then I heard it. A female voice. My heart sunk to the floor. He'd brought her home. Would I have to listen to them all night? Oh God. I need to leave. Can I get to my room before they come upstairs? I started to rise from out of my chair as they walked in. I was frozen in place. Their arms were linked and she was...the only way I could describe her is perfect. She belonged next to Sherlock. Her brown hair was tied back in an immaculate bun; her lips were painted shocking red and pulled up in a proud smile; she wore a short black dress which left nothing to the imagination and was that Sherlock's coat? I needed out. Now.
Seriously? You do weird Frankenstein experiments and you read people like they're books and there's nothing to tell? - JW
My family have finally left! Yays! - JW
Are you there? - JW
That poor girl. Please tell me you were nice to her? - JW
"Oh God yes."
Eff off! I am NOT gay! - JW
Kinda. Keeps telling me about his experiments. - JW
Glad to know I'm not bothering him! - JW
You bloody smart arse! I always run out of time on my exams! Anyway, you up for playing a prank on Mycroft? - JW
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Oh yeah, I forgot you don't like it. I'm trying to think of presents for people - JW
"Don't do anything stupid because of me, okay?"
I turned around to see Sherlock looking extremely puzzled.
"Okay then. I'll read through it. Urm, could one of you guys do me a favour and grab me a cuppa?" I really needed to drink something and Greg jumped at the chance to leave. Presumably, he wanted  me and Sherlock alone for a while. I took a quick glance at Sherlock, who looked very uncomfortable and began reading my life.
Merry Christmas Sherlock! :D - JW
__Disconnected__
"Great. Feel bad for ignoring him too."
Want anything or not? - SH
I tried to tell him but he got angry. I kept trying to explain but he shouted ''That I didn't care about him' and 'He was stupid to think that I could have friends' . I really didn't want him to leave. I want him back. - SH
This is awkward - JW
"Thanks Sherlock. I hoped that you'd figure it out. I hated the fact you might think that I stopped talking to you, just because we met up."
"Is it alright if I stay here tonight?"
Genius :) - JW
Obviously! If you annoy her enough, she will despise you and won't want to be with you! :) - JW
_Disconnected_
"Sorry, I'm ill tomorrow! *Cough, cough* See? Ill."
Nevermind. Go do your exam! Love you :) - JW
Sarcastic Sherlock strikes again! - JW
He was blushing. That was unusual. We sat in silence, a little while later John started cleaning up my mess from the day. The sinking feeling had returned. Should I help him? I watched him busying about. He seemed to bringing out emotions in me and I don't know what to do with them. John has told people many times that he's not gay, so why should I be any different? I've never questioned my sexuality, no-one has ever evoked my interest...until John. Oh John, what are you doing to me?
Yeah that's true! :) You in college today? - JW
"What-what if you jumped out of a cake?" Greg giggled.
For what? - JW
And possibly burnt one of your jumpers - SH
Oh good. Flatmates. Maybe that's why Sherlock seems so upset, if we live together we must be close friends.
"Good. I'll speak to you tonight then. Bye Sherlock."
"I told you before Sherlock, caring is not an advantage. Look at the mess you're in. If you'd never let your heart rule your head, none of this would of happened." I glared at him. How dare he? He didn't know anything! I opened my mouth to protest but Lestrade beat me to it.
John. Moriarty won't touch him. I'll have to protect him without letting him know. This will be difficult but it's for John. This means I'll have to stop pushing him out and keep him close. No wonder he's confused, I keep going hot and cold on him.
Crap. He wants me to continue. Should I lie? No. Come on Sherlock. What if he rejects me and walks out? I have to take that risk. "Yes. As I was previously said there is something important I have to say. I just have one request; just let me speak. Please don't interrupt me, say or do anything until I have finished. Okay?" John just nodded. I suddenly became aware of how dry my mouth was.
When I awoke, I was in semi-darkness. A faint orange glow from the streetlights outlined the furniture in the Living room. Stretching as I got up, I flicked on the lights and made my way to the Kitchen. I froze as I saw Sherlock sat at the table, motionless. How long had he been sat there? After the moment of shock passed, I continued to the kettle and started to make tea.
"Sorry I took so long." He said apologetically.
Oh yeah, they do suck. Lucky for you, you can just talk to me instead! We can keep each other company during the awkward/dreadful family meet ups - JW
I arrived at Mycroft's house. I hated when he summoned me here. What was so bloody important he couldn't tell me over the phone? I picked the lock and strode inside. I found Mycroft in his study, scanning over papers, many files surrounding him. Throwing myself into a chair in front of his desk, I sighed loudly. Mycroft started rambling on about manners and other nonsense. Did he honestly think I cared?
Sorry for snapping at you. I didn't realise. Thank you Sherlock. You really think you can help me cover them up? - JW
I noticed the room suddenly flooded with light as John stepped into the Kitchen. I must of been pondering things longer than I thought. I tried to catch John's eyes silently begging him to say something. For him to say anything. He didn't get the message as the kettle started to boil. Damn! I have to get ready for the date. I didn't want to do this. What do people do on dates? Breaking the month long silence, I asked John. Oh, it was good to hear his voice. He suggested dinner. Wish I were going out with him instead. John would definitely be better company. Leaving John in the Kitchen, I went to get changed.
"That was the most girly-ish scream I have ever heard!"
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
No. I've had it. I'm coming home, packing my backs and leaving. I'm tired of cleaning up after all your mess and being treated like your personal slave. I do everything for you and you don't notice or appreciate it. I bet you only keep me around to inflate that giant ego of yours - JW
The police? I'm not a criminal am I? Was my fall intentional? He must of seen the look on my face and corrected himself.
_Incoming Call_
Just because I've met you once, doesn't make those things less true - JW
And if I don't? We won't be at the same university then. - JW
I'm bored - SH
Stupid? You're the one sulking because I didn't come home - JW
No. I text you at this time because you're the only one who will be awake. Plus I wanted to be the first one to wish you Merry Christmas! - JW
I woke up in complete darkness, curled up in my chair. There was a blanket covering me. I don't remember getting a cover, unless Sherlock put it here? No, the idea of him doing something normal is laughable. I must have reached for it through the night. I stretched and stood up. Sleeping on a chair isn't the most comfortable place. I finally noticed that Sherlock was no where in the room, his bedroom door was shut. I hoped that he was getting some sleep, he desperately needed it. I crept upstairs and crawled under my own covers of my own bed.
You know everything about me. Well almost everything. You were wrong about one thing. Besides it's only fair - JW
Sherlock is an arsehole! - JW
"Well from what I just read, I had to. You would have taken the pill wouldn't you?" John was smirking now.
You don't like Christmas?! - JW
What?! God, I feel kinda happy about my family now! They may moan and bitch but they never try and force me into marriage - JW
He took a deep breath.
Getting away from you. "Going out."
Hahah! I'm sure you'll survive. He seems weird. So glad I don't have to talk to my family - JW
"That does sound awful but it doesn't surprise me. I'll trust you on this but if anything happens between them I'm allowed to walk away, okay?"
"Not really, apart from I know what Irene has planned for you tomorrow!"
Yes. So can I join you? - SH
"What are you doing?"
"Mr Watson, glad you're awake. Quite a nasty fall you had."
I feel the same. Well, only my dad. Oh, I'm about to start my first shift! Ah, I'm nervous! - JW
Why do I always text you first? Why do you never text first? - JW
Fine. I get it. Whatever. Bye Sherlock. I'll see you around...or not. - JW
I just want to forget it happened. Can we talk about something else? - JW
I wondered round London for a little while, trying to rid my head of all the thoughts of Sherlock and...her. I know that I over-reacted a bit, but who wouldn't? The person you love comes home with another. I was bound to be annoyed. Granted, Sherlock has no idea of my feelings for him so him bringing someone back to the flat is perfectly reasonable.
"What? No!"
I wanted to tell him how much this meant to me but I don;t think my words would express it. I placed the book on my chair as I got up. John was fascinated by the floor so I took my chance and wrapped my arms around him. The heat radiating from him comforted my immensely. I could feel every worry and thought leave me as John' arms curled around me. In that moment, I felt protected by John. My mask was crumbling down and so I buried my head in his shoulder. His arms instinctively tightened around me ad I almost lost it. I wanted to tell him everything right then, not caring what the consequences were, but I knew I couldn't. I was supposed to be the uncaring, sociopath who didn't have emotions. How did I let myself fall so far? There was no option. I would have to push John away. Make sure I am isolated. Alone protects me. It's all I have. 'You have John.' No. The voice in my head kept replaying it over and over. Forcing me to acknowledge the man who's arms were wrapped around me. Could I push John away? He's the only one who has stuck with me, despite my glaring flaws that have made many turn in another direction. The voice returned to torment me. 'Are you really going to push away the only friend you have? The only one who has stayed? The only one you've loved?' Shut up! Yes. I have to. I can't be attached to anyone or anything. It will be used against me. What would happen if John was danger because someone wants to get to me? I can't, won't let that happen. This needs to stop now.
