You won’t know what you’re doing, true. But John will, and it will feel so good you won’t be able to overthink it much. Not everything requires a lot of thought, you realize. For example, it will be instinctive when your hand slides up his thigh. And it was instinct that put you on your knees. You like it there, and so there you’ll be. It’s quite simple, see?
Funny how your life can change that easily, isn’t it? So seamlessly? Without so much as a conversation? Do you really want to wait that long, though? I didn’t think so.
“Yeah, listen Sherlock,” he’ll begin. He’ll look up at you, and a muscle in his jaw will twitch. His mouth will twist a bit. And you’ll know: you’re doing this now.
It will almost be as if nothing was said at all. As if it didn’t happen. Almost. The only difference that afternoon will be that you will grant yourself permission to watch him. Of course you often watch him, but not like you will this time. Not with this direct, unashamed, anticipating, devoted stare. He’ll notice. He loves to be watched. You know that already.
“Sherlock.” That small, murderous smile. He might actually hit you. Maybe you should stop. A wiser man might, but you’ve always been a babbler too.
Well: to be fair, there’s more than one option. We’re here to tell you the most likely ones, and the ones we like best, the ones we think you’ll most want to hear about. Which one it turns out to be in the end depends on you, your circumstances, and which family members, cases, major political events, murders, crime lords, and adverse weather events get in your way between now and then. And it depends on him, of course. He’s got a say as well, obviously. He might be your biggest obstacle, in the end. Or your understanding of him will be. But I’m getting ahead of myself.
He’d only ever accept a sharing arrangement in the first place for your sake. Honestly. Does that make you feel better?
You'll tell yourself, for example, that the happy ending is that John lived. He escaped his entanglement with you long enough to blog about it. If he still wants to blog about you, that is: sitting there in the hospital, bundled in your coat and listening to the drone of the vending machine, you won’t be sure. But still: John lived. If that's not a miracle, nothing is. Wanting anything more is just selfishness.
You’ll clear your throat first, and he’ll ignore you. Strop, remember. It will be well on its way by then. You’ll take a gulp of your tea, now cold. You’ll fold the paper in half, then in half again, and put it on the table in front of you.
It will only choke him for a moment, mind you. It’s a dangerous question, and he won’t be able to help marching right into it. Nothing ever stops him, in the end. That’s just how he’s always been: he does what needs to be done. His gaze, though wet, will remain defiant. He’ll keep going, heedless of how small and teary his voice will become. And though the anguish in his voice will be as sharp as a lance, he’ll get the question out:
Stop worrying about the shaking, by the way. You’ll imagine you can get a handle on it, but you really won’t. You’ll feel self-conscious for all of a moment before you realize how much John likes it. You trust him, after all, and he’ll know what he’s doing. And he’ll shake a bit too, so you’ll know it’s okay.
You’ll wait a minute or two and catch your breath. You won’t look over at him, but you’ll feel his fidgeting stop. If you look over, you know he’ll see right through you, so you won’t. You’ll inhale, then get up and put the kettle on. Your heart will be racing. It will be breaking, but you know how to stuff that feeling down as far as it will go and not tremble, run, or throw plates at the wall. You’ll be fine. You’re a grown up.
You won’t compose anything, though. What will actually happen is you’ll stand there just a moment too long, and John will speak.
“Sherlock, I… don’t care about the grocery shopping, or body parts in the crisper, or whatever.” John will swallow, but he’ll keep smiling. “You know that, right?”
This man is yours even though you act as if you don’t want him to be, even though he says he belongs to no one; you married someone else, but you still dream of him. Some part of you knows what we know, that the two of you ending up together somehow is inevitable. So when he says no to you, it hurts you more than you might expect. A lifetime of potentialities will vanish from your heart and leave it limping and sore. You’ll feel the loss of him behind your eyes all day. Your hands will be cold without the hope of his warm skin under them. Until he says no, you won’t entirely understand how much you’ve been depending on him saying yes instead.
Oh no, definitely not, I won’t tell you what she told Dr. Watson. That’s between the two of them. He’s free to tell you, if he wants to. But we all know he won’t. That’s not his style, is it. I have a different story for you, if you want to hear it.
John won’t flinch, or press his back into the chair, or anything like that. He won’t pull away from you. He never has, when you get in his space. It took you years to figure out why, and it will bode well that it hasn’t changed. But you won’t be home free yet. He’ll look down at you, laugh humorlessly, and say, “Oh, not this.”
“Right,” you’ll say. There it is. Your heart will fill back up again. Yes. There it is: done. Potentialities once dumped down the drain will come rising back up again, back to their natural home. They’ll all be within touching distance after that. You will almost be able to smell them. Of course they’ll smell like rash cigarettes and unwashed hair, but you won’t mind. “Okay.”
Slowly, so he won’t wander off-course: “Moriarty wanted to destroy me, John. You know how he went about it. What did he do, in order to destroy me?” John won’t answer, so you’ll continue, as gently as you know how. “He didn’t kill me. He never wanted to kill me. In the end, what did he want? What did he want me to see?”
You’ll taste the beer on his tongue. He will be warm and malleable, and will take your direction well. He won’t know what he’s doing, which you’ll sense, but he won’t want you to stop, so you won’t. Sounds nice, doesn’t it? It will be. It will be very nice indeed.
His gaze will flick to your mouth, and you’ll tell yourself it didn’t. You’ll have hurt him so badly, you won’t dare presume.
You can, of course, think about it later. When you have more data. There’s something to be said for that, don’t get me wrong. But let’s not get ahead of ourselves. That’s later. You’ll have just confessed your feelings; John won’t want something cerebral and forced. He hasn’t spent years wondering about that side of you. That’s all you’ve ever shown him, and you will have just said that you were done lying. No, it will be good, that first time, that you can hardly process it all. John won’t care about all that. He’s only ever wanted to help you
It’s not that it won’t remind you of John – since you met John, you've composed only for him. It’s just that John tends to leave you alone when you’re composing. And it’s what you’ve always done, when you can’t talk about something. Just then, it will feel like the closest you can get to talking to John without imposing upon him. He won’t know what it means, but he’ll listen. That’s something.
When John recovers, he’ll return to Baker Street. You’ll worry that he won’t, but he does. It won’t even be a question. But it will be different, away from the bright white stasis of the hospital. John’s health won’t be in peril, and that will regrettably free you up to consider the future full time. A future you won’t yet know how to detach from all your planning. And 221b won’t be the right place to let go of those plans, because it’s where you made those plans.
You’ll talk about the case you’ve just put to bed. He’ll tell you the things he didn’t tell Lestrade, the tiny things he catalogued but didn’t bother to mention. The littlest details that didn’t make it into the formal story. He’ll tell you his mistakes, too. His doubts. The things he did wrong, but caught just in time. You’ll love that: you love the vulnerability of the confession, for one. And the fact that even his errors zing with brilliance. It thrills you. He’ll be practically whispering into your ear before long. You’ll marvel at him, which he’ll love, as always. He never tires of impressing you, just as you never tire of being impressed by him.
Luckily you’re well-practiced at accomplishing the impossible for John. It seems bad now, but you’ll pull it off. In your usual spectacular manner, even. You didn’t think it would take days, did you? No, of course not. It’ll only take minutes. As I said: he’ll want to believe you. And you two have been dancing around each other for years.
This will be one of those moments. He’ll be feeling the gap, prodding at it like a loose tooth. It will bother him, that little unsolved and seemingly unsolvable mystery.
John will lick his lips, then open his mouth. You’ll wait. You’ll hold his gaze; you won’t know if you can fix things, but facing him is the least you can do. You’ll take responsibility for your mess.
So, no, it won't be an outcome you’ve pictured before, when you tell John. All of it, really: so unexpected. You won't expect John to die, John won't expect you to tearfully tell him you love him, and you certainly won't expect that John
But it will be awkward, yes. Coping strategies won’t do much for that. Even Lestrade will pick up on it. Lestrade, of all people! He didn’t see the kiss, you know, having taken off after Mary. So when Lestrade looks between you and John during an uncomfortable silence and makes that shifty face, it will feel unfair. I’d assure you that you won’t be that obvious, that word just gets around, but the truth is, it will be both.
You won’t bring yourself to regret it, though. Trying, I mean. Risking it. You won’t entirely regret it. You decided that a long time ago, when you jumped off of Bart’s, when you finally knew you didn’t want to die anymore. Staying with the people you care about meant accepting certain emotional consequences, so you made yourself a deal: if they could cope with you, you could be better for them. You could handle a broken heart, if it came to that. In that context, with all the sacrifices they had made for you, it just seemed like nothing.
What he’ll finally say is this: “Is it done?” A tight almost-whisper. You’ll want to answer, but you won’t understand the question. He’ll impatiently plow ahead, finding it easier to speak now that he’s started: “The… game. Or whatever. Moriarty’s plot, your plot. Is it all finished, can you talk about it?” You’ll have expected anger, but not about this. And it will build so quickly. John will sweep his eyes across the flat. “Are there, what, cameras still?”
“Ah, right, so you did,” you’ll say, and smile. Maybe you shouldn’t smile, maybe it will be too early for that, but you won’t be able to help it, looking at him. You’ll feel so relieved. “Sorry about that, too.”
You think you need them, the coat and scarf, don’t you? John thinks you look cool in them, yes, we know. But once they’re gone, you won’t miss the extra weight. Not at all. The jacket won’t feel like such a big step compared to that. And when John unbuttons your shirt, well. I can’t say you’ll be calm, but it’s hard to describe how it feels when a decades-long background hum of anxiety recedes and a different kind of excitement drowns out everything else. The outward signs are similar, after all: your heart will pound, you’ll hardly be able to breathe. You’ll be properly terrified, that goes without saying. You’ll feel a bit like you’re going to die, Sherlock, if I’m honest. But you’ll feel truly
You won’t be able to look at his armchair either, because that’s where the offer was made. Or rather, what you later convinced yourself had been an offer. But it couldn’t have been. You’ll test your new interpretation: you didn’t pick up on it at the time because there was no offer. You’ll repeat it to yourself a few times. It won’t feel right, no. You’ll be inclined to keep thinking about it, to make sense of it. You’ve pored over that memory so much you’ll still be able to feel his palm against your knee, if you want to.
This is the point where you’ll regret not having written something down. It’s always easier to write these things down first, isn’t it. Then you can look at it, memorise it, reconsider it, write it again, frown at it, throw up your hands, and then have a go at saying it out loud. Even then it’s a challenge for you, isn’t it.
"Is this why you- ah, wear bloody gloves all the time?" He asked, struggling ever so slightly against Sherlock's hold.
Sherlock looked at John for a moment. He could see what John was doing. He could also see that John probably wasn't even aware of it himself. "I'm not interested, John. It's not something I am willing to put someone through." He fixed a firm gaze on John.
John felt like an insect, pinned down for study by something far greater than himself. But he also knew that he didn't mind it. Which was probably not normal.
"I suppose so, yes." He said, licking his lips. He felt that they should talk about it, but if Sherlock did not want to, then he would respect Sherlock's wishes.  John should have known, really.
He then finally dragged his hand downward, skilled fingers landing on John's belt. Sherlock made quick work of all the fastenings on John's trousers so he could then start the main component of the experiment.
"How will you know," he asked lowly, "if you don't try? And you are ever so fond of experiments." He reminded. Sherlock locked eyes with John, and that finally convinced the blond that he should leave it be.
"Come here, John." Sherlock said, nodding to the other end of the couch. John looked at Sherlock for a moment before obligingly moving to sit on the other end of the couch.
No matter how curious he was, Sherlock's eyes had held something so raw that it nearly unnerved John. It was a vulnerability that he was sure no more than five people could ever have seen in Sherlock's lifetime. Then Sherlock blinked, and it was gone. His walls of defense were put up, right back into place like they'd never fallen.
John took a breath to calm himself before meeting Sherlock's eyes. He felt slightly foolish, but he wanted to see if it would work.
When he finally found the best mix of both, Sherlock pushed John's trousers and pants down properly.
Like nothing else called for his attention at that moment in time. John looked at Sherlock for a pause before nodding.
Sherlock's lips parted and his tongue flicked out to circle the tip of John's thumb. The latex tasted a bit odd, but it was worth it for the look on John's face.
John leaned closer to Sherlock as he resumed mapping out Sherlock's torso. "What are you sorry for?" He asked gently.
"I know how it sounds. I've tried very hard to figure it out, John. But it just... Is." John nodded slowly, trying to comprehend it.
John glanced at Sherlock's hand before closing his eyes again. He wondered how rude it might be to ask Sherlock what exactly he was doing.
Sherlock met John's gaze easily and smiled. "You really don't have to focus like that." He remarked, clearly amused.
"No, no. I was just... Wondering if you were going to do something. With me." John said after a sip of his coffee. Sherlock smiled.
You’ll feel his breath against your neck, because that’s how close he is to you. You’ll feel the cold pint in your hand, and let go of it to rest your damp fingers against his jaw.
You’ll both be a bit drunk. It will be amiably noisy in the pub, so much so that you’ll have to stand closer to each other than usual in order to converse comfortably, which will feel entirely fine. It will set off no alarm bells. Neither of you will mind in the slightest, or even notice.
“Because it’s the truth.” It will sound too quiet, too weak an explanation. And he’ll shut his eyes  and incline his head as if stricken, just for a moment. It will be the wrong thing to say.
So you won’t sit in your chair. And you won’t look at his chair. And you can’t look at him. You’ll need privacy, just a moment to get yourself together. But you’ll make it all of one step in the direction of your bedroom before you stop and think,
We’re just interested observers, waiting for the inevitable. We’re waiting for you to fall out of the sky. Or leap into it, depending on your preferred metaphor. You see?
“I…” You’ll start. An auspicious beginning. “You know, I wouldn’t be opposed to... well, if you wanted, I would–”
It’s perfectly friendly in the moment, of course. You’re just mates. It will all make sense in context. And he won’t mind. Not at all. All his attention will be focused on you. He won’t care any more about boundaries than he does now. He’ll watch your face, the way you’ll lick your lips, the way your shoulders will angle towards him: it’s all flattery to him, you see. He’ll be at least as drunk on you and your intoxicating reactions to him as he is on anything else that night.
But you won’t. You’ll just turn your head and watch the watery morning light inch up along the odd planes of his face. His neck will be so sore after this. He won’t be able to turn his head to the left without wincing for the next three days. But in that moment you’ll look at his sleeping face and you’ll think:
Halting and breathy, he’ll continue listing your crimes: “You told me you love me. You... held me, and you cried. Hm?”
Someone will struggle to get past him at one point, so you’ll reach out and grab him to shift him out of the way. That’s how you’ll end up with a hand on his waist, resting on the small of his back, hidden under his coat. His skin will feel invitingly warm. That will be the first time it will occur to you that something else might be going on between you and him.
“Sherlock,” he’ll say, labored, “if you’re lying, if you’re lying to me about this, I will not forgive you.” He’ll swallow. “Alright? Not for– I won’t. I mean it.”
There was something so noble about John at your gravestone. You’ve never forgotten that. The way John can care about people, and lose them, and keep going. That stuck with you: John, always so brave, and you, ready to stop being a coward. You’ll think you did okay on that score. We think so too, not that you care. It won’t make you feel much better.
“Go on,” you’ll say softly. There’s no predicting what he’s going to say – well, none you can do anyway – but you’ll be certain you deserve it. You’ll start pulling together pieces of apologies you’ve drafted in your mind. None of them will feel adequate, but you’ll owe it to him to try.
“Yes! I said yes!” He’ll be annoyed already. He doesn’t like things that move this slowly, you know that.
His eyes won’t leave your face. You won’t have a response – how could you? – so he’ll cut straight to the point.
It will be hard to think of much else, with all the tears streaming down his face. That’s probably why you’ll do it: you’ll reach up and touch his cheek, just briefly. It will feel natural, and he won’t protest it. You’ll think he’s still in shock, is all. Just a bit.
When he wakes up he’ll kick himself for falling asleep. It’s hardly a surprise, though. He won’t have slept at all in the previous two days. But he won’t wake up just then; you’ll have a few more minutes with his slumped, awkward sleeping body beside you. It will feel good. You’ll feel oddly at ease with his body heat and the sound of his even breathing so close to you. And it’s just then you’ll realize that he fell asleep in that awkward position because he curled himself around you in the night. He’d been watching you sleep, just the way you’ll be watching him. You’ll take that knowledge and hold on to it for the rest of the day, like an ember you’re keeping safe.
"I want a future with you, and someone would have to have to kill me to make me ever let you go again. Do you understand?" John said firmly.
Sherlock rolled his eyes. "Oh, please. Name one of your girlfriends that you didn't have sex with." He asked, eyes narrowed. John frowned deeply.
"No, John." Sherlock said softly, and his face held more of an anguished look than John could ever recall seeing on the man before.
It made John wonder just how much of what Sherlock had ever said about not wanting a relationship was true. He had just been hurting, hadn't he? All this time. Well, fuck. "So you've never tried having a relationship?" He asked slowly.
"Ah, so you like me for my massive intelligence, do you?" John teased, tentatively reaching to run his fingers through Sherlock's hair.
All Sherlock's life, he'd been different. He'd learned faster, questioned more, understood others less, and so on. But what made him the most different was what happened when he touched people.
Sherlock watched as John's fingers traced the hair down to the hem of his pants. He gave a full body shiver and looked at John. "I've never been touched this much by someone else." He admitted, reaching to touch John's arm.
Sherlock didn't emerge from his room for quite some time, though John was fairly sure he hadn't slept the entire time. He noted that Sherlock was, however, already completely dressed, even down to his gloves.
He stood up quickly and absolutely tackled John to the floor just as a shot rang out and shards of glass went flying.
John shook his head. "No, Sherlock. I'm not going to just leave. Of course not. We're mates, remember? No matter how much of a pain in the arse you are." Sherlock managed a small smile, but it also looked a little too sad.
"You're not relaxed. You're thinking." Sherlock chastised as his stroked John's hair gently. John rolled his eyes before closing them and leaning into the hand.
Sherlock shifted closer to John on the couch and soon their thighs were touching through the fabric of their trousers.
"John. I am not going to let you sacrifice yourself because you think you owe me something that I never got to experience. I assure you that if you haven't had something before, you can't miss it." Sherlock said firmly.
Sherlock watched him, brows furrowed. What on Earth could the doctor be up to? He watched John open a few drawers, looking for whatever it was. He must have moved it after doing one of his experiments, but that didn't narrow down much.
"I killed you." Sherlock said, and he said it with a false calm that sort of terrified John more than anything else would have.
Sherlock smirked when he felt the slight firmness there. It was always good to know he was right. John's breath hitched and he tried very hard not to move.
Sherlock was quick to adapt and stroked John in time with his thrusts. He was completely aching for some sort of attention, but he had to focus on John's needs first.
Sherlock gave a little chuckle of pure feeling before he composed himself. "We should hurry home, yes? Best to clean ourselves up as soon as possible." He said it like it was the most logical thing in the world.
Sherlock then turned John's face to the left, then after a beat he turned it to the right. John remained silent and pliable to Sherlock, watching the detective with a curious expression.
"Don't be sorry. Now you know. Don't ever touch me. I'm sure that it works both ways, it has to. So don't be stupid." Sherlock said with a sigh. He gave off a loneliest-man-on-earth sort of air.
"You...What? Come on, Sherlock." He said, and he smiled a little, because really, this was ridiculous. It must be one of Sherlock's experiments, right? It had to be. Yet, John couldn't help but think about what he'd felt.
Sherlock froze before pulling away, wide-eyed. "You kissed me." He said, looking as close to dumbfounded as John had ever see him. John looked at the cellophane in his hand and then to Sherlock.
"You are quite beautiful." Sherlock said after a time. "I know beauty is merely a social construct, but it matters to you, yes?"
"No one comes through here, darling." And the way he said it made John think that Sherlock had actually noticed something or other that served as evidence to support that, but he couldn't be arsed to care quite then.
They managed to catch a cab after a bit of walking and soon they were finally home. After a wipe down and a change, John found his way to the kitchen to make tea. He then sat down to think over what had happened.
"How could I, John? I cannot kiss, or hold hands, or consecrate said marriage. Who would want a marriage without affection?" Sherlock stood up, making to grab his violin.
"I killed you, because that's what happens when I touch people." He growled. John blinked, pulling back just a little.
"I understand, John, but think of the logistics." Sherlock pointed out. John looked at Sherlock for a moment, trying to think of a way to prove to him that he was being a complete and utter idiot. He was also trying to think of the logistics.
"Oh." John said quietly. He thought for a moment before he spoke again. He had always thought Sherlock was either asexual, immensely private, or had had a bad experience, perhaps in Uni. "Isn't that... Lonely?" He asked softly.
"If you're ready, then yes. Or I can give you some time if you're not." John said, folding his arms over his chest.
"Next time I was thinking latex gloves. Perhaps you could wear a pair as well?" Sherlock suggested, rubbing John's arm lightly through the fabric of the blanket.
In no time at all Sherlock was coming over his glove with a half-bitten back moan. He took a moment to get his breath back before he pulled off his glove gingerly and looked over John.
"I understand." John said with a soft chuckle. "I'm not completely daft." He said, pulling on a pair of latex gloves.
"Now what?" John asked after a pause, looking at Sherlock. He wasn't sure where this was going, but he knew for a fact that Sherlock had some kind of scheme he was setting into motion.
"Yeah, of course I will, Sherlock." John assured gently. "I trust you, but I know my limits." He wasn't sure what Sherlock thought he wouldn't like, but he knew that Sherlock had good intentions.
Sherlock slid his hand up John's thigh and continued up his chest until he could take John's jaw into his hand. He simply held him there for a moment, looking over John's expression, studying his face.
"It was..." John was rather entranced, watching Sherlock taste him in such a way, so it took a measure for him to think of a proper reply.
John knew it was going to be quick and dirty, but he wasn't actually ready for how much it reminded him of his teenage years. He thought back to those desperate rub offs in risky places, where neither party was quite brave enough to do anything without clothes on. This definitely felt a lot like that.
John pulled his thumb away after being shocked into silence for a pause. He then carefully began to undress Sherlock, methodically working through every button on his shirt as well as the one on his trousers.
Sherlock nodded, studying John. "Yes. Alright. Another time, then." He gave a little smile and reached to caress John's cheek.
"It doesn't matter, John. Can you really picture a life with someone you cannot touch?" Sherlock bit out. John took a little step forward and carefully took a hold of Sherlock's forearms, the smooth sleeve of his shirt serving as an effective barrier.
Perhaps, though, with Sherlock... He wouldn't ever need to have the right words, because Sherlock could so easily read him. He blinked himself out of his thoughts. "So do you ever plan to...Marry, or anything?" He asked delicately.
That's why today John walked up to Sherlock and dropped in the detective's lap an entire box of latex gloves.
But he knew that Sherlock was more feeling than he would ever let on. "I was joking, of course. I'm just a little... Off." He said with a little frown. "So um... What happened, exactly?" He asked slowly, brows drawing together.
That always worried John. He never knew what to expect from Sherlock during those times, but he wanted to prevent whatever he could of Sherlock's riskier antics.
It was a long bloody time before they did anything again. It had been a hell of a time for crime solving, and Greg had kept bringing them one case after another.
"Is that what you think of me, then? That I only date for the sex?" He asked testily, shifting on his feet. Sherlock stood up and moved into John's space.
It seemed that assassin had been satisfied with the death of John, no matter that it wasn't by bullet, or that it had been temporary.
Sherlock quickly began to make himself tea, seeing as he knew John wouldn't make it for him unless he was making himself some, which he wouldn't be doing very soon. "Got any plans for today?" John asked, watching Sherlock carefully.
"I shall live to solve crimes and hope to be remembered. That's all I can do." He said, and he began to play a melody he usually only let himself play when John was out.
"I do, yes. I am uncertain on how well they would play out, but I do have some more ideas. I merely want to be able to satisfy you as a good partner ought." Sherlock explained. John nodded and took a long sip of his tea. He didn't know just what to say. After a few moments of silence, he finally spoke.
"No, you bloody idiot. Come here." John said, nodding his head once to Sherlock. He carefully ripped off a semi-straight piece of saran wrap and looked at Sherlock.
Once they resettled, Sherlock was absolutely relentless. He stroked John without pause, sometimes meeting his eyes and smirking.
"I have a few ideas, yes." Sherlock replied casual as could be. "Why?" He looked to John. "Did you have something in mind?"
John took Sherlock's hand with his clean one and pressed a few kisses to his knuckles while the man came down. He pulled of the soiled glove and set it on the bedside table, quickly replacing it with a clean one.
"I don't want to experiment with anyone's life. Especially not yours." Sherlock said quietly. John nodded slowly.
Then, John's face lit up, which Sherlock knew meant John had an idea. He looked at Sherlock a moment longer before scurrying off to the kitchen.
God, how John wanted to kiss the skin there. He focused instead on Sherlock's cock, stroking a bit faster.
Well, the unexpected hit when Sherlock was least expecting it. It was also the place he'd least expect it: their home.
Sherlock shook his head quickly. Of course he didn't want John to stop. He never wanted John to stop. "No. No, just... Keep doing what you were doing. I'm sorry."
John watched Sherlock and felt illogically guilty. Had he hurt Sherlock's feelings? He really hoped he wasn't the cause of such a look as the one Sherlock had been too slow to hide. He wanted to say that he couldn't have caused the look, because Sherlock wasn't like that.
"Be... be careful, yeah?" John said, trying to even out his breathing. Sherlock pressed himself against John, taking his wrists and pinning them against the brick.
After quite a bit more studying, Sherlock finally began to fullfil the ultimate purpose of this little interaction with John.
"Angels are ridiculous, but not killing people with a touch? Do you know how that sounds?" He asked. Sherlock sighed.
Sherlock wandered into the sitting room a tad later looking as well put together as ever, and he looked over John. "You're upset." He noted, moving to sit down in the armchair across from John's.
Sherlock's grip on his wrists suddenly became vise-like and the detective shuddered against him with a gasped out distortion of his name.
Sherlock trailed his fingers up and down John's chest, rubbing at each of his nipples experimentally. He noted John's reactions to different kinds of touches, and to being touched in different places.
"I was thinking that we might try something." Sherlock said, the leather fabric of his leather gloved-fingers an odd sensation against John's jean-clad thigh. He tried hard to repress a shiver.
"What the bloody hell just happened?" He asked, and he looked up to the window. There was definitely a bullet hole, so where was his? He had definitely felt something.
Sherlock took John into his hand and began to stroke at nearly the perfect speed. He had committed to memory how John liked it best the last time they'd had their little sexual encounter, and he needed now adjusted the pressure and speed according to John's reaction.
"So are we...?" Sherlock didn't know what sort of label to put on them. Perhaps there wasn't an appropriate one.
Sherlock shook his head a little and brought his hand down John's neck. He then followed the path of John's arm until his hand finally landed on John's hip.
Sherlock closed his eyes. "For being different, I suppose." He murmured. "Makes things more difficult, does it not?" He asked, opening his eyes.
John frowned and slid his hand up Sherlock's torso in order to cup his cheek. "I wouldn't have it any other way, you understand me?" He said firmly.
"Don't think I didn't notice how excited you are." He purred close to John's ear, a gloved hand coming up to cup John through his trousers.
Sherlock looked over John with a little smirk, reaching to cup him through his trousers. He rubbed him like that for a moment before he undid John's trousers slowly.
"Sherlock." He meant to protest, but the way he said it was coloured with nothing but want. Sherlock smirked as he rubbed John slowly through his clothes.
“I am in love with you,” you’ll try again, voice shaking but somehow oddly formal, “and I have been, always–”
Before you can say another word, he’ll bound over the coffee table, charge through the kitchen, and vanish into his bedroom. You’ll think for a moment he means you to follow him (so direct! So sudden!), but you’ll hear the shower switch on a moment later.
Oh, I see. You’re worried you’re going to screw it up, are you? Don’t be. It’s true, you’ll have your ups and downs. Every couple does, but your downs won’t merit much mention. They don’t fundamentally change things. For example, we could tell you that in a moment of impulsivity, you’ll propose to John using the same engagement ring you used for Janine. We could remind you that John has every reason to hate that ring, and that it is, in fact, a woman’s ring. We could warn you that you should not attempt to justify your decision on the grounds that it fits him, and that men with small hands do not like to have attention drawn to said fact.
“Yes, you do,” you’ll say softly. “He wanted you married once I returned. We still saw each other. We were still friends. John. Why would he think that would hurt me?”
“Well. I would be happy to–” There’ll be a pause here, mostly because you’ll be feeling overexposed and awkward. This is a revealing statement, after all. Your tongue will start to feel too thick. “I would be more than willing to–”
John will look achingly handsome for someone who just got home from the hospital, I’m sorry to say. It will throw you a bit off-kilter. You won’t want to stare, but won’t you seem nervous if you look away? There’s probably some optimal balance of eye contact. Someone should figure that out. You won’t, though, and it will feel like another thing you didn’t solve in time.
It won't go quite like you expect, telling John you love him, but you've always found it difficult to think about John dying. You know it's a real danger, of course, but contemplating it shuts you down; you prefer to imagine happier scenarios. John will be thrilled, you hope. That could go all sorts of nice places. Sometimes going to those nice places in your mind will be the only way to be patient, to keep lying and keep John safe. Or in your darkest moments, you imagine John will be angry at you for not saying something sooner. For letting him stay with Mary, when you know what you know. You think you could handle that. You're pretty sure it's what you deserve, at any rate. And John has never stayed angry at you for long.
He’ll return after about twenty minutes fully-clothed with wet hair and a well-scrubbed face. He’ll close all the laptops but one, then go into the kitchen and set up some sort of chemistry experiment. He’ll put his safety goggles on and won’t speak again until supper time.
Thanks so much for the tea! Though, to be honest, it was a little cool. And rather...strong. Not complaining! Just mentioning!
It’s such a big moment between you, it really is. I know. What will you be thinking? Will you be seeing all the consequences of this running through your head, ticking through a massive spreadsheet of risk assessment pros and cons? No. Nothing so sophisticated. You aren’t him, after all. Time won’t change that. This is what you’ll be thinking as you make your decision:
John will sit with his laptop resting on his knees, but you won’t hear him typing. You’ll wonder what he’s not typing about.
You won’t be certain exactly how it happens. One moment you’ll be babbling, sensing him slipping away from you, and the next you’ll be on your knees. It will feel right, is all. Like the thing to do. Instinct serves you well often enough, and whatever the reason, whatever primal part of your brain issued that directive, once you’re on the floor something about it will ground you. Maybe remaining upright was too distracting, and on your knees, looking up into his face and grasping his hands, you can focus properly. Or maybe the contact with him just calms you, even when he’s angry. You’ll sit back on your heels, and take a breath.
“Blogging?” you’ll ask instead. You’ll sound casual enough, to your credit. But you’ll just stand there, all the same.
Let’s be clear from the outset: it will happen. There’s no fighting that. It’s like gravity; you can imagine flying, you can dream about pushing off the pavement and soaring into the sky, but in truth, if you found yourself up in the air like that, you would most certainly fall to the ground at a known rate of speed. It’s like that. Predictable, like gravity. You are falling, John Watson. You will land one way or another. It’s only a matter of when, where, and how.
You’ll hold his hand on the way home, and you’ll both continue your conversations as if you aren’t clinging to one another. You’ll have parallel conversations: the one with your bodies, and the one with your words. You’ll act as if it’s any ordinary day, even though it isn’t. That’s the day your relationship changes, and it will hardly feel like any kind of change at all.
You’ll ignore that, soften your tone; you’ll have a path cleared for him, and you’ll just have to guide him along it.
We could do all of that, sure, but it won’t matter, because John will say yes anyway. As a stickler for semantics, surely you understand the word
You’ll want to stay by John’s side in the hospital, but you won’t be sure you’re welcome. His face will be difficult to read. You’ll leave the room a lot, and you won’t know how John feels about that. It won’t have felt awkward,
John was already an utter mess and easily became putty in Sherlock's hands. When the glove came into contact with his cock, John couldn't help but moan.
But the next thing he knew, even though he had no idea what it was that he had noticed, he knew there was some kind of danger imminent.
Sherlock smirked. "I know that, John. I wouldn't be here with you otherwise." He assured, pulling on his own pair of gloves.
John shivered as the cold leather ran over his skin. The touch was soft, but the sensation was a tad odd. It wasn't necessarily bad, it was merely... Different.
Sherlock broke the kiss and let his hands fall to his sides, the plastic still gripped between his fingers. "Good?" He asked softly after a beat. John laughed softly. "Very good." He assured.
He’ll make a small sound, not quite a sob. His foot will jiggle anxiously and he’ll try to pull himself more upright in that military way he does. He won’t quite manage it. You’ll move your fingertips against his wrist, steeling yourself for what you’re about to say, and he’ll tremble, just slightly.
But you’ll grit your teeth and move on. He’s your best mate, and that won’t have changed. You’ll go out. You’ll walk in the rain, pick up milk and some ready meals from the M&S. You will feel a bit numb, and the rain will remind you that this isn’t some tragic nightmare or a daydream. You’ll tamp down every feeling you have with each step. You’ll tamp them down as far as you can, and try to take yourself back to where you were before you opened your mouth, but you’ll find it impossible.
You’ll spend the day feeling stupid and a bit raw. And disappointed, frankly. Terribly disappointed. I know you won’t admit to it now, but some part of you has always believed that it was only circumstances, an absence of emotional maturity, and a comedy of misunderstandings that’s been keeping you apart. You have always believed that the two of you would grow into each other, eventually, like old trees, and that you would be impossible to untangle ever after. You like that potentiality, don’t you. It’s exquisite, this bizarre love, sitting there just out of your reach, moving towards you with each passing day.
He’ll be frustrated because he’s been caught out again. Some little detail in a case that shines an uncomfortable light on a gap in his core knowledge. You know already what that gap is. It’s sex. Romantic affection. It’s all the rush of hormones that comes along with being physically intimate with someone you love. He understands it all theoretically, but in practical terms it remains a nagging and persistent mystery. He wants to understand everything, even the things he’s not sure he’ll ever physically know. He doesn’t believe that there’s any truth to the contention that you need to experience this particular activity in order to fully understand it, but once in a while a case crops up that shows him that he’s wrong. That he’s got a bit missing, that he doesn’t entirely understand. You’ve already seen that, haven’t you. He goes a little hollow at moments like that. You can see the gap in him then, can’t you.
“No.” You’ll sound more offended than you’d like to. It’ll feel like you’re a second behind the rest of the world. When his expression doesn’t falter, you won’t be sure what else to say. “John, I– Moriarty is dead.” You’ll look around the flat like John did, then back at him. Nothing. He’ll know Moriarty’s dead; that’s not what it’s about, Sherlock. You will, however, manage to deduce one thing from his stare: “You’re waiting for me to say the code,” you’ll say, almost an accusation. “I’m not going to say the code because
“I’m only trying to say,” you’ll go on, trying to keep your voice as smooth as you can, “that if you wanted to, you know. If you needed some experience in–”
But John dying will become a music box in your mind palace. You'll compose only a few bars before you have to shut it away in there, knowing where those thoughts are headed – where you're headed – and then you'll rarely open it. You'll never wind it either, but that's no obstacle for an imaginary music box: in your moments of despair it will play anyway. You'll tear the key out and still it will play. So you'll tell yourself, in a voice quite like Mycroft's, that you can't afford moments of despair. You've had a whole table for your plot to kill Moriarty, and the box will come to rest on the corner. You'll make sure nothing can touch it. You'll give the rest of the table your attention, and you'll shift knick-knacks around a taxidermied fox until you can almost forget what lies just outside your peripheral vision.
You could just tell him what you want from him, you know. In graphic detail. But you don’t tend to confess things like that, do you. Not to your best mate, anyway.  And you’re married to someone else.
It’s the least likely way of all, of course. Given your situation. You’re married, I can see that. Still wearing that ring! And about to have a baby, aren’t you? How lovely! So you’re happily married, isn’t that right? Ha! We know the truth of it, don’t bother lying to us about
It will begin just after breakfast, which he’ll only pick at. He won’t be in a strop, exactly, but you’ll feel one brewing. He’ll want a cigarette, he’ll want a needle in his vein, and he’ll be anxious. Crawling out of his skin. Familiar, isn’t it? You’re used to this sort of thing. You know how it goes. This won’t be any different.
John won’t be done talking to you, either, by the way. That’s hardly fair, is it? It will already be so much to take in at once, and he won’t even stop kissing you. If you want my advice, just do your best to keep up. Even you won’t be able to think fast enough. Moments like this, there is no such thing.
I really am sorry about that. I shouldn’t have mentioned it. Though I suppose it’s terribly relevant, isn’t it. I was hoping to just gloss over it.
You’ll really look at him after that. Really look. He’ll still be in his pajamas. His dressing gown will have fallen open. There’ll be a crease from the sofa on his face. He’ll look a little wild; you’ll wonder if he’s high. You’ll know about the cigarette. Naturally, you’ll wonder what other urges he gave into that afternoon.
It will just burst out of you: “I love you.” You’ll sound hopeless. You won’t even care how your voice wavers; desperation tends to hit like a flash flood, doesn’t it? And that’ll be the first tear. You’ll feel badly about that, you know, like you don’t deserve to cry, but, well. You’ve always been a crier. And if there were ever something worth crying over, surely it would be this turn of events. You kissed him, and he didn’t believe you. What could possibly convince him? What good is the word of a liar?
John is in your head and under your skin and has direct control over your pulse. And what’s worse is you’ll have grown so used to liking it that way you won’t want to let that go. It’s like mourning, in a way, you know. Hopes can get so strong that they feel real. Alive. They become a part of you.
John will keep talking to Mycroft, and then Lestrade when he comes back, but you'll have hardly moved. You'll be thinking,
At first you’ll try to maintain eye contact with him, but your eyes will keep drifting down to his mouth. He’ll notice that, of course. He’ll chalk it up to tipsiness and think nothing of it. Like I said: this is the slow route.
for thinking about it. You’d really believed it was possible, is all. You won’t want to open that door and let in this new, harsher light, Sherlock. You won’t want to feel like an idiot. No one does.
“Isn’t it more likely,” you’ll prod, “that I would try to convince him he was wrong?” He’ll let out a shaky breath, but no words after it. No confirmation, no denial. Just nothing. Your chest will hurt, watching him like that. “There were cameras,” you’ll remind him. But even as you say it, you’ll know it’s not necessary. You’ll see it sinking in.
You’ll smile too. “Yes.” You’ll be grateful for it, John’s smile. You’ll shuffle your feet a bit. “Threw him off the roof myself.” You’ll chuckle slightly, and John will join in.
You will look at John then. Just for a second. You won’t mean to; he moved, or something. He’ll be sitting in his chair. You'll see John in front of you, and you won't know how to take those fantasies back. You've never been able to delete those sorts of things, have you. John has been the exception to so many of your rules, but not that one.
You’ll have become one of those people. You’ve already done a lot of terrible things for love, you realize. I don’t need to remind you, do I? You know that. And you’re going to do a lot more. You’re already planning some of those things right now, so you understand the necessity of rationalizing certain morally questionable decisions when John’s life is in danger. It’s not like you don’t struggle with it, of course. It makes you feel like Mycroft one day, and like Mycroft isn’t so different from everyone else the next. Dreadful, isn’t it? But Moriarty has always forced you to choose between two devastating outcomes, and you won’t have time for self-flagellation along the way. People like to think that you’re clueless, or heartless, but it’s not that. You’re focused. You’re rational. It’s because those decisions can paralyze you that you don’t let yourself despair over them.
“Yeah,” he’ll say suddenly, too nonchalantly. He’ll clear his throat. “Yeah. And Moriarty is dead this time? We’re sure of it?” He’ll smile: it’s a bit of a joke.
It will feel awful, Sherlock, there’s no way around it. You’ll realize that there’s little that doesn’t remind you of John, and as the door slams on one potential refuge after another, you’ll feel a bit hunted. Exposed. Vulnerable. You won’t be able to look down at your own body without thinking of him, because your body wasn’t something you let yourself think about before him. You’ll try to retreat to your mind palace, but John has a key to every room. Of course he does: you rebuilt the whole thing on a foundation of John after you jumped. You felt scared, then, is all. There are whole hallways you don’t have the courage to walk down unless he comes with you. And it cheered you up, having him there, talking to you all the time. John moves around in there, wherever he pleases. He just does.
But John will look back at you, albeit suspiciously. He'll say your name – has been saying your name, you'll think. And then he'll say it sharply, in that tone that makes you feel like he's taller than you, and suddenly you'll be able to hear again. The world will speed back up again. And John will say he's okay, which can't be true, but somehow it will be. You'll stare down at him, blinking. John won’t look at you, though; he’ll look at other people. You won't remember exactly what you say, what brings John's attention back to you, but he’ll only frown and say, "Yeah. I love you too, Sherlock."
You’ll think you’re going to cry, hearing him sound like that. Given your track record, you’re right.
“What?” It will have been six hours since you asked the question. It’s fair enough that you’ll have no idea what he’s saying yes to.
“Yes,” you’ll say. And once you hear yourself, it will hit you: you really are doing this. Now. With him. You’ll help him with your scarf – or try to, anyway. Your hands will be shaking a lot. And his lips against your neck won’t help matters. Well, not those matters, not the unsteadiness. Everything else – seriously,
You’ll bicker so affectionately in your seats that you’ll make everyone around you certain you’ve been together for ages. And as the lights go down, you’ll realise that you have been. And it will strike you that you know exactly why he’s come with you, even though he won’t say it.
“I can’t ask you to forgive me,” you’ll say, swallowing. “But I swear to you. John. If you’ll let me, I’ll spend the rest of my life making it up to you. Anything.” You’ll smile weakly. “Anything you want. I’ll... stop storing body parts in the crisper. I’ll do the grocery shopping sometimes. John, I’ll..."
Well, it’s not as if you could have said anything else. You will have misread nothing after all, you know. That’s what it will all mean, and it won’t be lost on you. It should give you hope, but you won’t be thinking clearly. It’s difficult, when he’s hurting. It’s always shut your brain down.
Mrs Hudson will have put out a plate of pastries, so you’ll stalk into the kitchen under the guise of eating one. You’ll realize you’re starving; you couldn’t even think about food at the hospital. John still won’t say anything. It will make you uneasy. You won’t be able to think of anything to say, either. You would offer him a pastry, just to make conversation, but it will seem like a ridiculous thing to say. John will know the pastries are there, he’d eat one if he wanted to. Wouldn’t he? Of course he would. It will feel so stupid.
But when you realize John thinks you kissed him as some sort of trick, that you were just messing with his mind, that’s when you know: You’re one of those people who hurts the people you love. It’s not all killing bad guys, after all. You won’t stay entirely above the fray, no. You’ll slide nearly all the way down that slope. You won’t know what other choice you had, but you can’t deny you’ve deceived him. The road to hell, as the saying goes. You’ll be sure that’s how John must see you: you’re someone who lies to him, and hurts him. And that is the last thing you’ve ever wanted to do.
His brain works quickly, it’s true. But you have to understand that it won’t work quickly for a question like this. Because he won’t be able to bring himself to see that you’re saying what you’ll be clearly trying to say. It’s not that you won’t be obvious about it. It’s that the words themselves will shatter his perception of you, himself, your relationship, and the universe. He doesn’t let himself imagine you would mean what your words mean. It will take him a bit of time to process it. Take what you say and put it in reverse: that’s how he’ll hear it.
You look conflicted. It’s bad news, but it’s not all bad news, is it.  Being in love with two people at once can be a bit confusing sometimes, when you’re not ready for it. When no one talks about it. And I know you’ve got that big ugly marital issue to wrestle with. Can’t be easy, not knowing who on earth you married. No one would blame you if you tried to have the marriage voided on the grounds of completely-made-up identity, I’m sure.
“With…” You’ll have the option whether or not to phrase it as a question. You’ll be a bit afraid that your voice will come out all squeaky if you do. “Me.”
You’re a proper genius and you’ll reason that you can’t stand in the kitchen forever. And you’ll want to see what John is doing on his computer. You won’t be able to help it; you’ve always wanted to know everything about John, and you'll be in no position to resist then. Whatever gets you out of the kitchen, right? We all have our crutches. So you’ll wander past and discretely catch a glimpse of an empty blog entry box. He’s thinking about it, then. Of course he will be. And there you’ll be, still with nothing to do.
It will be slow at first, not that you’ll know it from how fast your heart will be pounding. It’s not that you’ll be nervous, exactly. You will be, a little – everyone is – but it will be John, and it will be the safest you’ve ever felt. It’s just that’s how it feels, to get something you’ve always wanted. That’s never really happened to you before, has it? Well: it’s exhilarating. You’ll like it. You don’t need convincing, do you. You’ll find out.
“Good,” you’ll say, because body parts spoil faster in every other part of the refrigerator, but John will save you before you can say the wrong thing. He’ll lean forward, press his palm against your cheek, and kiss you.
There will be a long, heavy pause. But it will be the easiest silence you’ve ever endured, because John won’t have automatically deflected you. You’ll wait for him. John will glance at you, shut his eyes against tears, and open them again. He’ll meet your gaze but shake his head minutely, a refusal to speak.
"Sherlock bloody Holmes. Explain to me what's going on right now, or I swear to God-" John's words got caught in is throat when Sherlock let himself into his space, their faces a mere two inches away from each other.
For years, Sherlock had no problem with it. It was easy, given that regular people were just extremely uninteresting to him.
John reached to grip Sherlock's shoulder desperately when he felt a gloved hand wrap around his cock.
Sherlock had no shame, seeing as he'd never moved past this stage before. John had thought he'd grown out of acting upon such a primal instinct as rutting, but this made him rethink that. It was good. Really good.
"But what if they don't care what you think you want?" John asked, brows drawn together and lips tugging down at the corners.
He slipped his hand under John's jumper and shirt, running his hand over the bare skin of John's torso.
You would never know if you didn't take a chance, right? In science, you must fail to disprove a theory, and Sherlock was a scientist. He'd understand. At least, that's what John told himself.
"C-close." John breathed out, trying hard not to thrust into Sherlock's hand. It didn't quite work out.
"Christ." He looked at Sherlock, and then down at his chest. He ran a hand over his torso and frowned.
Sherlock gazed back into John's eyes, a near-smirk tugging up the corners of his mouth. "I promise."
John rolled his eyes and resumed stroking Sherlock. He ran his spare hand over Sherlock's torso, rubbing lightly over each of Sherlock's nipples in turn.
Sherlock stroked John through his orgasm, and as soon as the doctor was done he tugged his own throbbing erection out of his trousers. He stroked himself quickly, John's release making his slightly-soiled glove slide more easily over his cock.
Perhaps the fact that this was ridiculous to do at his age factored into his reasons for liking it so much.
He brought Victor back to life, who looked so looked scared and hurt. Sherlock vowed then and there, no matter if he understood it or not, he would never touch anyone again.
He wet a flannel with warm water before returning to John and gently wiping him down. Once they were both clean, Sherlock wrapped John in a blanket and then settled to wrap his arms around John.
Sherlock made note of that before he began to stroke John a tad faster. He experimented a bit, trying different pressures and speeds to see what drew out the best reaction from John.
He'd immediately thought back to Afghanistan, where he had been nearly certain that he was going to die. And while Sherlock was a good actor, John didn't think he was that good. At least, he liked to think that he understood Sherlock slightly better than that.
"Promise?" He asked, looking to meet Sherlock's eyes. It held a lot more than just a simple question. It was a lot of questions piled into one anxiously hope-filled word.
"I'd like that. If you're sure." He said, looking down into his tea as if it may hold some kind of answers.
"No, no, I've just never..." Sherlock couldn't find the words he was looking for. Couldn't quite explain what he was feeling.
"I'd be happy to try something with you, Sherlock." John replied, watching Sherlock's hand rub slowly and methodically over his thigh.
John wondered then, briefly, where this was going. Of course, he understood the endgame, but now? What on earth was Sherlock doing?
"You will tell me to stop if you feel it is uncomfortable?" Sherlock asked with such sudden intensity that John blinked.
When he woke he was even more exhausted than before. He drank three cups of coffee before it finally began to kick in.
"Of course I'm sure, John. Don't be ridiculous. I want to be intimate with you. In every way I can. It will just have to be a little bit unorthodox." Sherlock returned.  John wasn't quite sure what that entailed, but it excited him.
Sherlock laughed and shook his head. "I feel that this fits into the same category as what we are trying to do, but by all means, go on."
"John." Sherlock said with a frown. "I do not think that it needs to be discussed because I do not think it changes anything. Unless you've changed your mind about dating?" He asked, brows furrowing a little.
John slept for thirteen hours once the cases finally stopped, which was quite a significant amount more than his usual five or six- seven or eight if he was lucky.
"You can't say that you don't want to be together and then look sad when I say we're friends." He said in exasperation. "Would you please just tell me what you want?" He asked, trying not to sound desperate.
John's brows furrowed slightly. "What do you mean by that?" He asked, looking sidelong at the detective. Sherlock pushed John carefully against the wall.
John moved to sit in his armchair, listening to Sherlock play. God, it was beautiful, but so, so sad. He knew Sherlock felt more than he showed, but to hide so much pain? He was sure that wasn't something a normal person could do.
"The idea of us having a relationship together is utterly fanciful and you know it. So please stop entertaining such unrealistic thoughts, it's unbecoming of you." He said matter-of-factly, at which John deflated and took a step back.
Even though they'd been dating a while, he still wasn't quite used to being unable to touch Sherlock whenever he wanted to. "We're going to get caught." He breathed, ignoring how that sent a shiver of excitement down his spine. Sherlock shook his head and gave a more insistent movement of his hips.
It hadn't been an immediate problem, really, since he'd kept to himself for the longest time. And then, when he'd finally made an actual friend, someone he trusted, someone he felt actually cared, he'd killed him.
I can’t even describe the look you’ll see on his face. You’ll never forget it once you’ve seen it. He’ll look so surprised, at a loss, and above all, hungry. It will be the very first time you’ll see him look at you like that. You won’t entirely believe him capable of it until that moment. You know by now that you don’t have it in you to deny him anything, don’t you?
You’ve hated it from the start, after all, lying to John about Mary. For what it’s worth, you won’t have to keep that up much longer. I’ll just tell you that now, to put your mind at ease. John’s clever enough, and when it becomes clear that Moriarty is actually alive, he’ll put two and two together. Snipers aren’t exactly thick on the ground, are they. But that’s another story. The important part is this: you’ll come clean as soon as you can, and aside from keeping your feelings to yourself until Moriarty is out of the picture, you won’t lie to John again. He’ll forgive you, when you tell him about Mary, as he always does. He won’t be happy, as you can imagine, but he’ll accept you had no choice.
No, of course we’re not listening in on your conversations with your wife! No no! We’re not creeps! We’re just observers and pattern-followers, that’s all. Theme hunters. Subtext analysts, shall we say. Have you noticed that your life revolves around a set of themes? No? Well it does. That’s how we know what we know. It’s just that obvious, if you’re looking at it from the right angle. Your life is a composition, and we can feel where the notes are heading based on the ones we’ve already heard. It’s not magic, or voyeurism. We’re only following a logical progression, that’s all.
She knew you were lying as well as we do. She’s a smart lady, that one! I understand the attraction, trust me! But it’s for the best. A tryst between the three of you could have had its benefits, of course. A little imagination goes a long way! All of London would have been salivating over the blog post about that steamy evening, let me tell you. Not that it’s any of their business, of course, but...well, you know how people are.
. Things do happen, afterward, yes. Of course they do. We said we were going to tell you the important bits, and that’s what we did. You have quite a lot of sex, if that’s what you want to know.
One touch, and Victor had crumpled to the floor. It had scared the hell out of him, and he'd dropped to his knees, touching Victor's cheek.
"Don't be ridiculous, John. There are no Angels." Sherlock chastised. John let out an exasperated huff.
