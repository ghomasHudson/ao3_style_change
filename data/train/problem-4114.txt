"Yeah, Emmanuel?" He brushed his cheek with his thumb. "Don't worry, Manny. I'll let you finish." He smiled, kissing his jaw.
Cas wakes up from the magic "coma" and he talks to Cain about feeling like an object again since Cain only married him to have an heir. Cain assures Cas that he didn't just marry Cas for an heir. He wanted to save Cas from Michael and Lucifer's abuse. Cas doesn't accept Cain's explanation and starts to sink into a depression. Cain leaves him to attend to business he has with Dean. During his conversation with Dean, he reveals that his family has passed down "the mark" from father to son for generations. Despite having a spell placed on Cas, Cain feels as though his child won't be old enough to take the responsibility the mark demands. He passes the mark to Dean, leaving him as the true heir to the throne upon Cain's death. As Dean gets the mark, Cole, the guard Dean doesn't particularly care for, makes his way to Cas and tries to have his way with Cas in his weakened state, but Dean comes in just before Cole can actually do anything. He comforts Cas after dealing with Cole and agrees to teach Cas how to wield a knife in their free time.
Cas laid back on his bed when she left. How could he possibly save Dean?
Dean smirked as he brushed a thumb over Cas's cheek. "Why? Why don't you want me to go?"
Amara snapped her fingers in Dean's face, a questioning smile played on her face. "Lost in thought, darling Dean?"
Cas nodded, "I feel much better, Cain. Thank you." He watched Cain undress for bed. He didn't need to get ready for bed, he had stayed in his nightgown all day. Despite being so full and warm against Cain, Cas couldn't sleep still. He felt a pair of eyes trained on him as he tossed and turned underneath the blankets. Finally, he sat up, looking back to the opened balcony doors. A redheaded woman stood leaning against the railing, watching Cas as he moved in bed. She smiled and turned to look out to the sea. Cas grabbed Cain's dagger from its sheath and held it out in front of him as he approached the woman.
Dean made a small smile, "You had a daughter while I was away?" He grinned wider. "Can I see her?"
"Will he remember all the horrible things I said to him? All the horrible things I did to him?" Dean glanced to her as she shook her head. "What do you ask of me, Amara?"
The camp took the rest of the afternoon to pack their belongings and tents in the few wagons the rebellion had managed to steal or trade for. Just as the sun started to set in the west, Dean saddled his horse at the lead, Henry strapped firmly to his back, Emma sitting in front of him. He looked to his brother at his right, then to his lieutenant, Gabe, at his left. He nodded with a firm smile, starting out to Eastden.
Cas looked up at Cain as they stood at the top of the stairwell. "I trust your judgement, Cain." He whispered, kissing Cain softly. He smiled, looking to the room. "I like this room. I want this to be my painting room after we finally share a room." He smirked.
Cas struggled against Amara's magic for a moment before he firmly planted his feet on the floor. He grinned, flipping his knife to attack. "Have you forgotten the words you put upon me, Amara?" He pulled his shirt away from his chest, showing off a bright red glowing mark. " 'Cursed be my enemies,'" He took a step towards her, feeling the raw strength she had to keep him back. "You never thought I'd turn on you. You thought your magic was stronger than my love for Dean." He kept pushing through the magic, "You don't get to decide what I feel anymore, Amara. I make my own choices. Not you, Not Cain, Not even Dean! ME!!" He yelled as he knocked her hand away. He plunged the knife through her throat. Tears rolled down her face as she looked at Cas. "Well done, my darling." She mouthed before her body vanished in a thin vail of smoke.
Dean turned to Michael, green eyes burning with hatred and determination. "From sons of bitches like you."
Cas was in his studio painting a black and white forest scene when his door opened up. He turned with a small smile, expecting Dean to come and cradle him in his arms, but Dean staggered to the bed. His shirt was soaked through with blood and sweat; Cas rushed to his side, holding Dean’s head in his lap. “What’s wrong? What’s happened?” He pulled Dean’s shirt away, gasping at the jagged scars along his chest. “You didn’t have these before. I know it.”
She smirked as her eyes glowed bright red. Black smoke surrounded them as she spoke, “Dabo tibi hanc notam ut custodiat te, ut benedicite tua familia, et ut execratione maledicta congessit hostibus vestris.” Her shoulder glowed red as well, and the light ran down her arm, up Cas’s arm, and etched the mark onto his shoulder just like Amara’s.
"So you think I'm beautiful?" Dean smiled and sat next to Cas. "The first time is always overwhelming. You're giving someone else control of yourself. Even now, I feel anxious about this. It's not every day I have the chance to be intimate with a prince."
NOTE**********
Dean chuckled softly, brushing the infant's cheek as he still held Jess's stare. "What's her name? Congratulations on motherhood. It suits you."
Cas climbed in bed again as Cain got ready for his meetings with the advisers, clutching the pot so he could vomit when he needed to. He smiled as the physician entered his room. The doctor pressed on his stomach, listening close to the noises inside him. The doctor knowingly smiled, gathering his things back up. He gave Cas a few herbs to ease his stomach. "Congratulations."
Weeks passed and Dean heard nothing from Rowena. His patience ran thin as the dim light in Cas’s eyes faded into a pitch dark nothingness. He marched through the halls of the castle to find the sorceress. In the depths of the castle’s dungeons, Dean found Rowena buried in mountains of books, scrolls, scraps of parchment, and any other piece of lore she could get her hands on in the month of her search.
"I finally feel ready to give you everything you want." He whispered and straddled Cain in bed, grinding his hips against Cain's. The two continued to undress each other, the younger man hungrily devoured the older's lips. . . . The next morning, Castiel smiled as Cain woke under him. He looked up at Cain's brilliant blue eyes. "How did you sleep, love?"
He pulled away from her and grabbed a quill. "I never want to talk about it, Meg. It's in the past, and it's best to let sleeping dogs lie." He frowned and started to write his response to the commission.
Rowena raised an eyebrow, “That’s a surprise. He didn’t seem like he had it in him to hurt anyone.” She nudged her horse forward, heading towards the broken down castle.
"My dear boy, today is your lucky day. I've just saved you from the nasty business of death. Of course it was Cas's idea. He said you seemed too - what did you say, dear?"
Cas flushed red all over. “How do you know about Dean?”
Sorryr that this was posted so late.
Dean took Cas's hands, moving him onto the bed. He ran a hand to Cas's hair, tilting Cas's head back. "Please, darling. Let me show you how sorry I am." He whispered, putting Cas's leg on his hip.
Cole's eyes crossed as he tried pulling Dean's arm away from his throat. Dean dropped him to the ground, spitting next to him. "If I ever so much as hear you say his name, I'll personally drag your ass out into the square and rip your head off your shoulders with my bare hands." Cole coughed more, holding his throat and nose as he scurried to the door. Dean locked the door after he left, his rage slowly leaving his body as he walked over to Cas. He gently tugged Cas's pants up, pulling him into his lap on the bed. "Shh... it's okay. I'm here. I won't let him hurt you again." He whispered, holding Cas to his chest.
Rowena walked into the dilapidated castle, grabbing scraps of the vines surrounding the cracked pillars. “Where did she die? That’s where her connection to our world would be the strongest.”
Dean smiled and laughed softly, pulling Cas into a soft kiss. "Yes, Cas. It's Henry. He's been with me all this time. I told you I would take care of him." He chuckled and turned behind him. He picked up his daughter, "Cas, this is Emma."
“Are you feeling well now, Sir?” She sat a tea tray beside the bed and poured a steaming cup of tea, drizzling honey in it the way Cas enjoyed his tea. “The king brought you to your room after you fainted. He believed the news of your marriage overwhelmed you.”
His eyes glowed red, a smirk crawling across his lips. "Oh silly me, thank you dear Hannah." He opened the door again and walked out. He sauntered downstairs to the throne room, greeting his guests as they trickled inside. He made his way towards his throne, eyes falling on Michael and Lucifer circling the seat. His grin darkened, shaking Michael's hand with vigor. "Michael! It's good to see you again. I'm surprised you decided to come."
Cas sat still for a split second as he realized Dean had been playing him the entire time. From the moment Dean saved him from being trampled, everything had been a ploy to find the weaknesses of the castle and royal family. He snapped out of his thoughts before Dean left, shouting for the guards. Uriel and Raphael came racing to the cell, catching Dean before he disappeared up the stairs.
After the ceremony finished, Castiel moved his guests into the banquet hall. He entertained a few princesses, some overly affectionate with their eyes and hands. As he moved away from the women, Azazel, Lord of the Northern Isles, approached him with a smug grin on his face. "King Castiel, may your reign be prosperous and long lived." He shook Castiel's hand. "You know your brother Lucifer married my eldest daughter Lilith, but my younger one Ruby is still looking for a husband. She's quite lovely, you know. She's talking to Michael to set up a betrothal between you two."
“Why do you think I’m here?” Cas put his hands on his hips. “If you two didn’t do your job, and the filthy traitor has a weapon, Michael would rather have me die than him. Wouldn’t you rather have my death on your hands rather than the king’s?”
Cas chuckled and rested against him. Despite Cain's age, the old king had been able to satisfy him. He wasn't as energizing as Dean was, but Cas was still happy with his time with Cain. He rolled away from his husband.
Dean rested his eyes on Cas as the young prince gathered plates and cups. Even doing the simplest task, Cas radiated humble beauty. Dean saw him in a modest home the two built together, Cas swollen with child, a toddler in his lap, Emma at his feet as he read their children stories by a warm fire. They were happy with the life they made together. No kings or treaties to get in their way, no magic to pull and keep them apart.
Cain grabbed at Cas's hand, kicking his feet. "C-Cas.. I'm sorry.. I know it was a rushed.. d-decision." He coughed and gasped for air.
After nine months of planning, preparing, and adjusting to pregnant life, Castiel found himself in his studio more often then anywhere else. After he started showing, he preferred to be alone with his art. He always found peace when he painted, and as of late, Cas needed that more than anything. A gnawing thought ate away at him: what if the baby wasn’t Cain’s? His infidelity had never bothered him before, but with his child at stake, the threat of losing everything hung over Cas. He glanced to his easel and the unfinished painting on it before he decided to lay down. He held a hand on his swollen stomach.
Jess gave Castiel a hug instead of a handshake, grinning as usual. "It's plain to see where Henry gets his beauty." She winked at Dean, "Where is he? I've grown somewhat attached to him in the recent months."
Dean smiled for a brief moment, glancing down to Henry’s room. “That’s all I ask.” He moved past her as she scurried back down to her chamber to start to work. He stood outside of Henry’s room for a moment, contorted his face into a glass jovial smile, and pressed inside to save face with their children. Henry and Emma didn’t need to know what happened to their mother, not until Noctis was gone.
Cas shook his head and wiped sweat from his brow. "I don't need your help. I can protect myself, Dean." He walked over to the vanity and looked over Amara's things. He held her crown for a moment. "I didn't ean to sound so coarse, but I need to have some control again."
Dean nipped his bottom lip, "Well I don't
After Cas had settled Henry into his nursery, and his calm demeanor returned to him, the castle had started to rebuild itself. The stones filled out again, the vines withered and crumbled to dust. Dean put Emma to bed in one of the spare rooms, smiling at Cas when they met up again. "My following came with me, Cas. We needed to leave Havenshire." He held Cas's hand as they walked down to the garden.
Dean tightened his fists and took a deep breath. “I think something has Cas trapped. Ever since yesterday, he hasn’t felt like Cas. I know that’s his body, but Castiel is not in there, at least he’s not in control. This morning I saw a reflection of him screaming and banging on the mirror, but his physical body was calm and collected.”
Cas felt his cheeks grow feverish again as he stuttered, "W-well, n-no... I just. You're so." He closed his mouth as Dean laughed again. "It's a simple yes or no, Dean."
"What are you going to do if you become pregnant?" Dean reached out to touch Cas, just wanting to be near the young prince.
She hid behind the maiden, tugging on her dress. "You're Henry's mama?" She asked quietly, still hiding partially behind the maid.
Cas waited for Dean to leave his room before he vanished from the isolated tower. The entire week had been a pain. Everywhere he went in the castle, a soft whispering beckoned him to Cain's study. He knew he had to find the crown again, he wanted the power that came with it. Dean wouldn't understand that; Dean had never been helpless. Cas concentrated in the shadows to find the crown.
She chuckled softly, “Why thank you. I just wanted to make sure you had a wonderful breakfast after that good night of rest. I have to look after my innocent children.” She sipped her tea.
Cas walked over to his easel, looking over the empty canvas. He glanced to Dean for a moment, "When will you let me paint you, love?"
Dean put an arm around him and brushed his hair gently, kissing his forehead. "I'll help you, Cas. I'll never let you do some you regret, Castiel." He whispered. "From now on, it's us against the world, against anyone or anything, we'll face it together, Cas." He promised, hugging him closer. He meant it; nothing would ever separate him from his family again.
Cas grinned too, "Come to the Southern Tower in two days time. I'll give you my answer then." He started back to the castle then turned back to Dean. "By the way, I prefer to be called Cas." He continued to grin and trotted off to the castle, mind racing with his chance of escape.
Cain arched an eyebrow, a smirk playing on his lips. "I'll have a doctor come see you. Stay in bed until he clears you."

His reflection watched him hesitantly reach for the circlet, rolling its eyes annoyed.
this is the chapter that makes me tag the story as non-con. If you don't feel comfortable reading this chapter, skip to the end. I will summarize the main points of the chapter there.
Emma shrugged her shoulders as she watched Henry fall asleep. "It's okay, Daddy. You're back." She looked up at him, a smile on her face. "You won't go away again though?"
She smiled as she saw Cas and touched the back of the chair. “Beautifully crafted, hm? I’ve made it out crowns I’ve taken.” She opened her arms for a welcoming hug. “My, my. How you have grown.”
"Well it's not something the bounty posters advertise." Dean smiled softly as he thought of his daughter. "Emma. She looks just like her mother."
Cas shook his head, holding back tears suddenly. "I was.. I was so angry at Cain, I was so tired of feeling weak. I went into the vault and transferred Noctis to my circlet. He encourages me to take revenge on those who have wronged me." He curled into Dean's chest, hiding his face away from him. "That's why Cole went missing for a month after I came back, that's why Cain is dead. What if he thinks you've wronged me in some way? When he takes over me, I don't listen to reason. I can't think straight Dean. I can't hurt you."
Cas smiled slightly. Dean was nervous too; he was still uneasy, but Cas pushed through those feelings and pushed Dean onto his back. "Pull them down, Dean." he whispered against Dean's ear and brushed through Dean's hair.
“That old broad? I know she was a powerful witch, old too. Cas knew her better though. Why? What’s this say?” He snatched the page from the table. “ ‘In the year 420, Lady Amara of Elladonton ascended to the throne.’ How authentic is this document?” He looked to Rowena.
Dean clutched the mass of blankets, looking at the infant. He couldn't help but smile after Cain left, despite his orders. He wouldn't follow them; he couldn't. He walked over to Cas, placing the infant back in his arms. "Let him calm down, I'm sure you can charm him or something, Cas." He wrapped his arms around Cas, kissing his forehead. "You did so well."
"Cain would just send his armies here to steal you away from me again." Dean pulled away from Cas and started back to his room. "We'll head for Eastden after I ready my things."
Cas felt his chest tighten at Dean's skin against his own. His hands cradled either side of Dean's face, pulling him even closer. He jumped slightly when Dean slid his hand from his back to his ass, pulling away slightly to find reassurance in Dean's shining green eyes.
"Because I couldn't leave you in Havenshire to suffer at the hands of your brothers. After what you told me," Cain held Cas's face between his weathered hands, "I just couldn't let this beautiful blushing rose be trampled any longer."
Noctis smirked at the mirror, winking at Cas. He stood from the vanity, tossed a canvas cover over the mirror, and turned away to prepare himself for the day ahead. The door creaked as it closed in a rush, and Noctis ran over to it. He opened it again, eyes narrowing as his brother dashed down the stairs of the tower. He shrugged, deciding to lay in wait for Lucifer's return. He dressed for the wedding alone, avoiding all mirrors to keep Castiel at bay. Around noon, Noctis walked down to the chapel alone still, greeting passersby warmly to put on his act. As he entered the church, he found Dean holding a curious Henry. He smiled at Dean, avoiding Henry's cooes and calls for his mother. "Hello, Dean."
"What on earth were you doing, Cas?" Cain whispered, pulling away slightly from Cas. He wiped Cas's cheeks, but he was crying too hard to speak. The room went silent aside from Cas's broken, crushing sobs.
As Dean packed his clothes and his blade, the bedroom door slammed shut. ‘Castiel’ walked over to him and wrapped his cold arms around Dean’s waist. “It looks like you’re packing for a trip,” He smiled, kissing Dean’s neck.
"Soon darling." Dean whispered with a smirk. "We can meet at the pub. Tomorrow evening at dusk. I'll let Ellen know to clear a room for us." Dean pressed his lips to Cas's once more then opened the balcony and started his descent. Cas went onto the balcony and watch Dean rush through the servant gate, his head swimming from Dean's kiss. "Tomorrow at dusk." He whispered.
"King Castiel requests all monarchs to attend his coronation. He spares no expense."
She laughed loudly, smoothing the strap back over her mark. “I gave it to his forefather, Adam, as a curse.”
Dean ran his horse ragged over the course of three days. The usual week long travel to Elladonton was cut short as Dean cut through forests and stayed away from the small villages along the trade routes. When he arrived in the capital city, confusion encompassed Dean. The streets, the pubs, the markets, everywhere was empty as if no one lived in the old city. Dean tied his horse in the castle's courtyard and slid off the back of the exhausted animal. He drew a knife from his belt as he went inside the weathered stone castle, walking silently through the deserted halls. He entered the throne, canvasing the room as he looked for any sign of life, any sign of Cas.
it's ya girl, ah, magnumcolt. Back at it again with them [super super super] late updates. i transitioned from a part time (12 hrs/wk) to full time (40 hrs/wk) position and just have not had time to work on this or any writing projects. But I am back for now!

You've helped me rejuvenate my love of writing fan fic and my love of Supernatural as a whole. For that I'm ever grateful for you wonderful amazing people.

I'm forever in debt to you guys, so please know you have left such a big imprint on me and my confidence as a writer. Love you guys! Thanks!! ~TMC67
Lucifer chuckled dryly, almost appalled that Cas hadn't pieced together why he was the black sheep of the family. "You're the reason OUR mother died. You should've been the one to die, not her. Father was blinded by grief and rage when the physician told him of Mother's passing. Then you were placed in his arms, and he wanted to smother you right there, but Mother's eyes stared back at him. After that, he wouldn't purposefully allow your death."
Cas frowned still, holding Henry closer. The door opened again, and Cain stood with Alastair and Cole at his sides. “Cole, take the newborn and dispose of it. Alastair take the traitor to your special room. I’ll be down there after I deal with my husband.”
"Yes, yes. The busy capital Omundington. I'm more eager for you to see the sea. You've been surrounded by trees your entire life." He smiled, "What you need is the ocean. You're going to paint it so often; I just know it, darling."
"I'm sure any happiness I don't find with Cain, I'll find with a secret lover. Perhaps one of the guards." He grinned and kissed under Dean's jaw. "a strong, loyal, intelligent man." He chuckled, walking back into the room. "I'll be taking a bath shortly. I don't want anyone else in here once Hannah returns. That includes my brothers." He pursed his lips. "Especially them."
Dean sighed, sitting up in bed then cupped Cas's cheek. "You want to, but..?"
Cas rubbed his wrists as he buried his hurt feelings. “He said he was hungry, so I unchained him. That’s when he shackled me.” He looked down at his feet, lips puckered as he forced himself not to cry. “He won’t talk about the other rebels or their whereabouts. Let him rot until his execution.”
Cas quickly moved away from Dean. "You treated me like a stepping stone on your path to victory. You can't just waltz your way into my room and expect forgiveness because you feel bad."
Cas moved away slowly from Cole, still underneath the blankets. "Castiel. You don't get to call me Cas." The man sent Cas into a panic, but he kept his face calm. "What do you want? I'm not holding audiences with peasants." He gritted through his teeth. His eyes darted to the door. His legs still had a dull ache in them, but he'd crawl to the door if he had to.
Dean smiled and hugged his brother tightly before he started into the city with Emma following not too far behind. The peasants met Dean with worried looks, fear in their eyes as the man walked towards the castle. Dean found it odd as he marched on, picking Emma up to carry as they approached the castle. He stopped dead in his tracks as he came to the castle gates. Dark thorny vines covered the walls of the castle, the stones themselves had started to crumble. He knew he hadn't been gone long enough for the castle to be in shambles. He tightened his hold on Emma and walked inside. No guards met him as he came inside, no servants scurried through the halls. He walked towards the throne room, opening the door quietly. He sat Emma down and took her hand as they came inside the room.
"Not to speak out of place, but it sounds like you should've took a wife instead of a husband then." Dean chuckled once, looking down at his hands. "Cas can't give you a son to pass that thing on to."
"Oh, you mean Castiel?" She pouted slightly, "The pretty ones always prefer the company of men." Her playful grin grew slier, "Castiel isn't here anymore. Didn't put up much a fight either. I made it quick." She laughed mockingly as Dean pursed his lips sourly. "It almost seemed like he'd been broken before."
Dean tensed as the woman scraped his face, "Where is he then? That's all I want to know. We don't want to waste another beautiful woman, do we?" He forced a smile as she hovered too close to his body for his comfort.
Cas held his legs apart and watched Dean curiously. He jolted when Dean pressed a cold, slick finger against his hole; he felt himself clench. Dean chuckled and kissed his neck, "You need to relax, baby. It's going to be uncomfortable if you fight it."
"Dean, I hate that you came all this way to die on the floor of Amara's castle, but I can't just let you take Cas away from Lady Amara."
Dean screamed in agony, arching against the restraints. He growled and started tugging on the restraints again. "Fight me like a man, Cain!" His face contorted in pain as Cain peeled his skin back.
Cain took his hand and pressed a kiss to it. "I promise I have no plans against you. I simply want to make you happy."
Dean's laughs faded quickly. "If that's the case, then I need you to get plans of the castle. We plan on taking the castle the first opening we get."
The small group stayed silent for most of the day. Cas didn't want to overspeak with Dean, and Hannah was occupied with her sewing. The day dragged on slowly as the carriage crawled to the capital city. The evergreen forests turned into a sea of oranges, reds, browns, and yellows, but even those colors faded away as the sun set. Cas looked to Cain, sighing when he found him asleep. Cas pressed his head against the window and tried to sleep himself. Just as his eyes started to close, he caught a glimpse of flickering lights in the distance. He grabbed on the doorhandle of the carriage, too excited to be home finally to care. "Cain! We're here! We're finally here!" He pressed down on the handle as he reached back to Cain to wake him. The door swung open and Cas yelped as he tumbled out of the carriage.
Dean undid his own pants, kissing Cas's jaw. "Then why are you marrying someone else?" He mumbled between kisses.
Cas knocked her hands away, "How I feel, how ANYone feels isn't of your concern. Who are you to say pain and grief and loss aren't worthy to be a part of life? Everything grows and everything changes; it's natural to feel Amara!"
She rolled her eyes, “It’s not that simple, Dean. In order to speak with a spirit that old, I’d have to dig deep into my books and histories. It’ll take me some time to locate a spirit old enough to remember her.”
Sam looked over his brother, confusion still spreading across his face. "What are you doing here? We thought you'd never be able to come home." Sam took the horse off the path, leading Dean through the trees to their hidden camp. He handed the horse's reigns to a young man as they entered the camp. He brought his brother to the center of their camp, giving him soup and ale. "What happened?"
Dean snatched his wrist away, his expression souring. "He thinks Henry is dead. I thought Henry was dead, so I know he must think so too." He put his hands on his hips as he paced in front of his younger brother. "He has a right to know about his son."
Cas laughed, withdrawing his hand from Azazel's grip. "Michael doesn't speak for me anymore. I've had many offers, but I've had to turn them down." He grabbed a chalice of wine, moving to the head of the table. He smiled at Dean and Sam along the edges of the room. "Friends, visitors, and family. While we gather to celebrate the start of my reign, I have to announce another new beginning before more proposals come to me. I am happy to announce my engagement to Dean of Winchester." He waved Dean over, putting his arm around his waist. "We wish you all to stay for the wedding, but we understand if you must leave."
Rowena put together several component bags, “‘Course I know how to summon a spirit. What kind of court witch would I be if I couldn’t summon a spirit Nerve of some people.” She pulled robes out of a chest, “Get your gear together, we leave at dusk.”
Cas sped his hand up, placing a kiss to the underside of Dean's cock, grinning at the gentle sigh Dean made. As Dean grew harder, Cas cleared his throat before he wrapped his soft pink lips around the head of his cock. He swirled his tongue around the sensitive head, smirking to himself when Dean tangled a hand in Cas's hair. Cas slid down Dean's length, stroking what wasn’t in his mouth with his hands. Dean’s face relaxed as Cas started, brushing his fingers through Cas’s hair. Cas bobbed his head slowly, batting his long eyelashes at Dean with faux innocence. Dean moaned as he watched, holding Cas’s head down. Cas arched against Dean’s hand, pulling off of him. He stroked his Dean’s cock to cover it with saliva. He grinned as Dean gripped the sheets; his cock began to leak precum and Cas leaned down and licked at his slit, grinning wider at the soft growl Dean made.
Dean's entire body filled with a consuming, overwhelming rage. His vision blurred with an unquenched bloodlust as he slammed Amara into the stone floor. His pupils widened until a blackness overtook his crystal green irises, and he grabbed his knife Abaddon had knocked away from him. He pressed the tip of the blade to Amara's exposed sternum. She only laughed more, "You never cease to surprise me, Dean. You're the only bearer to unlock this... power of the mark."
As Dean closed the door of the room, Cain folded his hands together on his desk. "Have you noticed anything that would cause Castiel to withdraw like he has?"
Cain stood from his desk and gazed out the window behind his seat. "Perhaps you're right, Dean. I've been so busy with the kingdom's affairs, I haven't been able to give him the attention he deserves." He clapped Dean on the back as he went to fetch Cas. Dean followed him down to their bedroom, right on Cain's heels. He ran into Cain when he abruptly stopped just inside the bedroom door. He started to grumble until he looked where Cain was looking. The balcony doors were open; Cas was facing the two, eyes empty and hollow. He stood on the stone railing, glanced over his shoulder as he stretched his arms out.
Meg caught the apple and rolled out of bed. She wrapped the sheets around her bare body and walked over to him, a grin on her face. "hmm, I don't know. I'll have to get back to you on that when he discovers my inspiring ways." She laughed and kissed his temple. "You provide quite the comfortable life, Clarence." She dug through the bags to see all he bought as she ate the apple. "I can't believe you just turned up in the square offering cheap portraits and now we live in the noble's district."
Dean followed behind her and stopped outside the front door. “Everyone thinks him soft,” He slid off his horse and tied it up. “He can be quite venomous when he needs to be.”
Dean chuckled and looked down at his hands. "There's a boring story. Nothing remarkable, though my daughter is turning six in a few weeks. Hopefully, my brother will take care of her."
Cas bit his lip at Cain's admission. They hadn't done anything in the month they had been married. He moved into Cas's lap, straddling the king. "Does that upset you, my king?"
"Cas? Are you friends with him?" Cole laughed, "You know his schedule. When would the best time to make a move on him?"
He adjusted his circlet to show his status to the guards and walked over to them. “Open the cell.” He ordered, trying his best to mimic Michael’s authoritative tone.
"Your father wasn't a cruel ruler. He always seemed quite jovial." Cain waited for Cas to sit down before he took his own seat.
Michael elbowed his brother's side. "Cas, can I speak with you privately for a moment before the ceremony? It won't take long." He grabbed Cas's arm firmly, moving them into a small room outside the throne room. "Break off the engagement before you announce it. Now."
Dean just grinned shifting to a grimace when he moved slightly. “Alastair has an interesting way of teaching me how to run things around here.” He coughed once, reaching up to hold Cas’s face. “I’ll be fine. Just sore from being cut into. How are you? Have you had any trouble?”
"Cas? As in Castiel Novak of Havenshire?" Sam grinned, "Good. We don't need more royals getting in our way, Dean."
“All in due time, young Castiel. First, we must make you well. You haven’t been cared for properly since the day you were born.” She kept an arm on Cas’s shoulder. “You’ve been surrounded by men your entire life, and they surely don’t know what a growing child needs. Only a mother knows.” She led the young prince away from the throne and into an equally large bedroom with a wide canopy bed against the back wall. Amara sat on the bed and patted the space next to her. “Sit with me, Cas darling.”

I check daily, so if you do leave a question or comment, I will read ASAP. Thanks again!
Cain pursed his lips, deciding not to press Dean further. Cas leaned against the carriage; he didn't know what to think about Dean having a daughter. It didn't bother him; Dean just didn't seem like the father type.
Cas straightened up and tugged his shirt into place. "Of course. I've been waiting for this moment since the day he walked into my room."
The city guards drew their swords. "By order of the royal crown, Dean Winchester, you're under arrest." Cas covered his face, trying to hide from the guards. Dean looked down at Cas, groaning. "You betrayed me?"
"I don't want to be with him," Cas sat up from the bed and stretched his arms. "He's a weak pathetic ruler now that he bares no mark."
Cas relaxed against Dean's chest and whined pitifully. "He rolled over last night. I couldn't sleep at all." He turned to Dean's face. "I have something to ask of you. When he's born, I want you to take our son back to your family in Havenshire and stay there with him."
Cain pressed the tip of the knife to Dean's throat. "So many empty threats." He laughed once, "You're caught, Dean. I should've let Michael hang you that day. I should've known Cas wanted you for a reason."
This is the start of the last arc of this story. There's probably 2-4 more chapters plus an epilogue left. It just depends on how much editing I do mentally before writing. Again! Love ya guys so much. TMC67
The guards pulled Dean away from the bed, and Cas still hid his face from the guards. Cas pushed the circlet out of sight, covering himself. The guards forced Dean to dress; he didn't believe that Cas hadn't betrayed him. Who else would know where he would be? He shot Cas a murderous glare before Jo, Ellen's daughter, stepped around the corner of the door. "I'm sorry Dean. They threatened our place." She looked down, arms crossed under her chest.
"Can we just stay here?  Raise a family, move your rebellion here. The kingdom's nearly empty. We could live here in peace."
Dean's eyes narrowed as the two kissed; he was cold, devoid, desolate - everything Castiel wasn't, even on his worst days. He held Henry away from the man, forcing a smile on his face. "I believe it will, Castiel. Now, we're supposed to start soon. I'm going to give Henry to Jess before we go. Wait for me?" Cas nodded, idly waiting at the door for Dean to return. Dean walked inside the chapel, finding Jessica sitting with Sam and Madison. He handed Henry to his brother, looking anxiously at the entryway. "something's wrong with Castiel. that's his body, but that is not Cas."
Michael was surprised to see Dean standing outside of Cas's room. "Well, isn't this wonderful? Cain entrusted you to guard my brother?" He laughed softly, "I'm surprised to know my baby brother is still alive with you around him all the time."
Cain tried to pull Cas back into the carriage then shouted at the coachman to stop the carriage. Dean jolted from his own slumber when he heard Cas's yelp, pulling him back into the carriage by his shirt. "You just attract danger, don't you?"
"I saved him from pigs like you, like Cain. You all only wanted him for what he could give you. Every single one of you greedy men used him like a common whore!" She shouted back, "He has be reborn through MY light."
Cas shook his head quickly. He whispered, "I promise I didn't..."
Cain laughed softly and kissed his forehead. "One of the better nights. Enough exercise to make me sleep soundly."
Dean opened the window and threw the bottle outside. It crashed against the ground. "With all due respect," he closed the window and ordered a maid to bring him some tea. "Which, as of late, is none, but you haven't been my king. Castiel has suffered for four arduous months because you have sat here and drank away every opportunity we've had to save him. I'm sorry, but I refuse to sit here any longer." He made Cain drink the tea the maid brought back, then headed to the door. "I'll be back in three weeks time either with Cas or his body. I expect you to be sober for his return."
She smiled. "My birth name was Josie, but in HER new life, I'm Abaddon." She pulled the  collar of her shirt away to show a tattooed 'A' on her neck. "How I got up here isn't important, but you, Castiel, you are very important to HER."
"We could leave now."  He grinned and pulled Cas's leg onto his hip. "Go in the night and never look back."
After Cain had left, and Cas had settled in his room, the door creaked open. Cas turned from the balcony, smiling softly at Dean as the rugged man stood at the door.
"Well, I don't need an audience, Cas." He reached out and stroked Cas's cheek. "You're the only one I need to see right now."
The doctor nodded and left the two alone. He told the king and the guard what Cas wanted, walking away from the room. Cain waited for a brief moment then entered, too excited to see his child. Cas looked at the intruder, holding Henry tighter. "I wanted some privacy, Cain."
Cas studied Dean’s face for a long minute. He didn’t want to bluntly say he loved the man, but he needed Dean to understand how he felt. “Because I think your cause is worth the risk. I think YOU are worth all the risk that comes with helping you.” He presses his palm against Dean’s speckled cheek. “Because I want you... I want to be able to dream about a life with you...” his cheeks grew hot as he spoke.
Rowena simply nodded and put a hand on his shoulder. “I’ll try everything I know how to do to make this work for you. That’s all I can promise for now.”
Cas cracked his neck as he walked brazingly through the streets. He kicked the castle door opened, laughing all the way. As a few guards came over to him, he waved his hand to pin them against the wall. He watched them for a moment and left them on the ground as he walked through the halls. The throne room's door burst open in a strong gust wind. Cain looked up in surprise, trying to find the person to scold for the abrupt interruption. Cas smiled and bounced on his feet as he came in the room. He met Cain's startled eyes. "Well, well, well Cain. You just can't seem to get rid of me."
She grinned as Cas grew angrier and as he spoke. She pulled his wedding ring out of thin air. "I know I told him I'd let you go without protest, but I won't allow you to go back to a mundane life." She crushed the ring in her hand effortlessly. "You're my son. You belong here where you're safe."

"A little bit, yeah. You singlehandedly took out an entire squadron during the Great War of the Kingdoms. No one knew how you did it though. Some said it was pure luck, and others say it was solely your skill in battle."
Dean left Cain in the torture chamber, rushing upstairs to find Cas. He burst through the bedroom's door. Near the entrance, there was a large, rust colored stain on the floor. Dean reached down, touching the stain. He looked at the dried flakes of blood on his fingertips, eyes cooling to green again. A single tear fell from his eyes, but he quickly wiped his face clean. He rushed back to the barracks, grabbed Cole out of his bed, and slung him onto the ground.
Sam had guessed their move would take a week, and he was right. The Havenshire rebellion was outside Eastden's capital walls seven days after they had departed. As they approached the walls, Dean slowed to a stop, holding his hand to signal to the others. He climbed down from the horse, and then got Emma down. He walked over to Sam with her tailing his heels. He looked up at Sam still on his horse. "let them make camp here tonight, I have to talk to Castiel alone. Can you manage without me for a few hours?"
Michael glanced to their hands. "I came to offer my condolences about Cain. I knew your marriage would be short, but I didn't expect it so soon after the wedding." He looked back to the red stain on the wall behind the throne. "how did he pass again?"
Michael pulled his coat to straighten it. "You've made a mistake, Dean." He looked to the room again and turned away. "Your rebellion is crumbling without you, and once we find the whore you were caught with, he'll tell us all about the rebellion's location."
Cas took his seat and started to eat. "Of course, my love. After breakfast, we shall be on our way. I'm so eager to see the capital."
“No, no... That’s why you’re here now, my darling.” She laid in bed with Cas resting against her. “So I can protect you until you can protect yourself.” Cas nodded with her. His mind was too clouded to think. As Amara held him, he slipped into the first night of peaceful rest in a long time.
(See the end of the chapter for
Cas shook her hand with a smile. "Thank you. My name is Ca-" he stopped himself, "James, but friends call me Jimmy." He took a sip of the ale.
Dean shrugged his shoulders. "Not much. My dad used to tell us stories about Eastden's legendary warrior kings."
Rowena held her chin in thought, a devilish smirk playing on her lips now. “Seems like King Castiel has bitten off much more than he can chew. Course the only being that can help him now has been lost for centuries.”
Cas turned over as Cain went to the door. He didn't want anyone to be around him right now, not even Dean's presence was welcomed. After a few moments of silence, the door creaked opened. Cas stayed under the blankets, facing away. "Hannah, can you just sit the tea down, please." He rolled his eyes as the footsteps moved around the bed. "Hannah, I don't want company, right now!" He snapped and turned over to scold her disobedience. He froze as he found a man at the foot of his bed. His eyes looked hungrily at Cas and forced a chill down Cas's spine. "Who are you? Cain and Dean are busy. I'm sure they can help you more than I can."
Cas frowned as sunlight abruptly interrupted his sleep. He looked over to Hannah opening the curtains. He yawned and pulled the covers back over his head.
Cas pouted as he leaned up to Dean's lips, repeatedly kissing him. "I told you not to call me Manny. I prefer Emmanuel." He laughed before he pulled away from Dean entirely. He swung his hips teasingly as he sauntered over to his bed, climbing on it. He motioned Dean to follow.
Cas pulled his legs up to his chest when the covers were yanked away. He whined and sat up finally, stretching his arms out. "I suppose I'll eat while you fetch water for a bath." He walked over the small table where Hannah had placed his food. As Hannah left to get water, Dean took his post outside, a smirk on his face. Cas took notice of the smirk, finishing his breakfast quickly. He walked over to Dean, rubbing his chest. "Good morning, Dean."
Cas sucked in a breath, whining in pain. "Never." He whispered, closing his eyes for a moment. When his eyes opened again, they were glowing bright red. "You will do well to let me go." He kicked his brother's legs out from under him, turning to watch Michael. "See, what you didn't know. Before I killed Amara, she taught me a few tricks." He twirled his fingers; little sparks of magic flew from his fingertips. "Cain learned a very difficult lesson, and you're on your way to learning the same one." He squatted down with a grin. He patted Michael's cheek. "If you're wise, you'll hold your tongue."
Cas touched his neck. “You only give that brand to betrayed women who pledged their lives to you. Or so I’ve heard.”
Dean grinned from ear to ear, pulling Cas into a warm embrace. "Only if I'm there to see the look on Michael's face when you do tell him." He kissed Cas's temple one last time before he finally climbed out of bed. He grabbed his shirt from the floor and tugged it over his head then looked back to Cas. "Now that you've agreed to marry me, I have to go move my people into the city. I'll be sure to introduce you to Sam and Jess. They helped take care of Henry until I got back home."
"If I were here to hurt you, well, I would've done it already." She turned back to Cas and crossed her arms. "That particular dagger won't work for you anyway." She glanced over the blade, "Not yet at least."
Dean bit his lip in hesitation. He had to stay away from Cas to protect him, even if that meant breaking his heart again. He straightened his shoulders and pulled away from Cas’s touch. “You don’t know anything about me, Cas. You happened to meet me in a pub, and we fucked. That’s it. That’s all it’s ever been.” He stood from the bed. “I shouldn’t have let this go on as long as it did.” He started to the door.
Cas tensed at her words, pulling away from the woman. "Noctis hasn't spoke to me in months. I don't even care anymore. Cain has taken everything from me, and he thinks I'm dead. It's my one chance to be free, free from the rules of royal etiquette, free from hiding and prying eyes." He sighed softly and walked to the door. "If you mention my life, I will come back here seeking your head." Cas opened the door quietly and vanished in a cloud of smoke. He passed through walls and rooms, finding his way into Cain's vault. He grabbed a few bags of gold and vanished again, this time leaving the castle walls for good.
Dean rested his chin on top of Cas's head. "Tomorrow is your special day, isn't it?" He felt Cas nod quietly, "You're not the blushing bridegroom you hoped to be."
Cas stepped around Dean and into the room. He frowned as Cain drank the alcohol. "Dean, please leave us." Dean nodded and left the room quickly. Cas closed the door behind him, then walked to the bookshelves. He traced his fingers along the spines of the books. "You didn't come for me, Cain."
"But you're not that. I know you're brooding." Dean rubbed his hand down Cas's back.
Cain heard the crash of the vial, and he stirred awake in time to see the smoke fade around Cas and Abaddon. He grabbed for his blade but frowned when he saw it in Cas's hands. He tried to get up to get Cas, but he was gone with the smoke. He snatched the parchment from Cas's pillow, tears falling on the page smudging the symbols on it. "not again..." He whispered, covering his face as he cried softly.
Dean slammed him against the bunk's frame. "You killed a defenseless baby because an old man told you to?!" He fought tears as he slammed Cole harder against the frame, "He's killed Cas; he's killed Henry." He met Cole's eyes, onyx stones piercing through the guard's soul. Dean smirked, "No, you killed Henry. You're responsible." He moved his hands to Cole's throat. "How does it feel to be helpless, Cole?" He grinned wider. Cole scratched at his hands, trying to pull Dean off of him. Dean watched the light escape Cole's eyes. When Cole started to pass out, Dean loosened his grip, so Cole would think he's done. As Cole relaxed as Dean weakened his grip, Dean grinned and snapped his neck to the left. Dean dropped the lifeless corpse on the floor and calmly walked out of the barracks. He went to the stables and saddled a horse. As the sun rose, Dean directed the animal to the north. He was finally going home.
Dean felt his chest swell, "I didn't know Cole's intentions with Cas. I thought I would be there for him. If Cain hadn't pulled me away." He wiped his mouth free of Amara's saliva.
Hannah pursed her lips, avoiding Cas’s eyes as she spoke. “I heard he was found with a man. Someone with dark hair.” She glanced to Cas’s hair, “and some are even saying the man looked like he belonged to nobility.”
Meg smirked and rubbed his chest. "I would love to visit Havenshire on that gold. Elladonton, the Northern Isles, everywhere as long as I'm with you, Clarence." She smiled and touched his stomach again. "Are you ever going to tell me the story of this?"
"It's too late now. The Castiel you love is gone. No one protected him from the biggest threat he would ever face: you." She glanced to his knife hanging loosely at his side. "Until now that is."
“You know how to summon a spirit?” He folded the page and stuffed it in his pocket, “Or do you need another month to find a ritual guide?” He rolled his eyes and started upstairs to prepare for the journey.
Cas looked up to the king, his frown growing still. He had to admit, the older king wasn’t hard on his eyes like he imagined him to be. He cleared his thoughts of Cain; he couldn’t let the handsome man in front of him distract him or sway his loyalty to Dean. “Bad memories with him is all. Power goes to his head. He’ll be rid of me soon though.”
“Again? He never told me he had been married before.”
" In a quick rage, Cas slashed the knife through the spongy flesh. He stabbed the knife into his hip and left him screaming and crying in pain. Cas vanished from the room, appearing outside of his and Cain's bedroom. He calmed himself down, then went inside the room. He greeted Cain with a kiss and a smile, undressing himself as he continued to kiss his husband.
Cas smiled slightly and kissed Cain's palm. Despite Cain's desire for an heir, he wanted to see Cas healthier and happier. Cas slid back onto his side on the bed. "Alright, my king."
Cas cozied up to Cain's side as they entered the square. He glanced to the gallows, putting a hand to his throat. Cain chuckled as he noticed Cas's movement. "What drives a man to betray his king, I wonder."
"He gave me his family's mark of power and nobility. He wants me to take over until his heir is old enough to wear it, if he ever has one." Dean chuckled lightly, "but I don't see how he's going to have an heir with you as his spouse."
The door creaked as it came open; Dean spun around, eyebrows pulled together in confusion when he saw Cas standing in the door. "Come on in. I'm too sore to fight anymore."
I'm so very sorry this chapter took three weeks to post! With the holidays and making (and keeping) resolutions, writing has been pushed aside! However! I am back and the weekly chapters will return until I finish the story! (which is soon sadly. There'll be one more major arc before it's over!)
Sorry this chapter is relatively short. I felt like this was a good place to end it though.
Jess's smile turned to a smirk as she handed the baby to him and fixed her shirt. "Hannah said his name was Henry."
Castiel looked up from the letter and to the circlet. He darted away from it, from Meg. He knew if he acknowledged the circlet, anything of his past life, he wouldn't be able to let him go again. She placed the circlet on his head, holding his face in her hands. "I can't go back. I just can't, Meg. Please." He whispered, sad eyes flickering with a glowing red.
Cain laughed soft;y, "Exactly why I want you here. Now, sleep well, young prince. We have much to do." Cain kissed his forehead and descended downstairs to his chambers.
"Emma, Henry is your baby brother. His mama wanted him to be safe, just like Miss Hannah said. Cas won't be coming here for a long, long time, so I'm going to need your help teaching him the ropes." Dean pulled his daughter into his lap and placed Henry in her arms. "I'm sorry I had to go away for so long." He whispered.
Cas snatched his arm away from his brother. "You can't tell me what to do anymore. I'm being crowned king in mere minutes." He turned to face Michael. "King of Eastden and Elladonton. I brought Amara to her knees alone. What have you done?"
Cas frowned when Dean moved away and put a hand on his shoulder. “Dean, I know you. You would never hurt me.”
Dean trotted down to the barracks and grabbed a few knives and his sword along with his change of clothes. He saddled a horse from the stables and left the castle grounds. He didn't bother asking anyone to accompany him; without Cas's company, Alastair had devoted more of Dean's time to training. Dean didn't need anyone else to slow him down. He refused to leave Elladonton without his Cas.
"How did you get Henry here? Cole told me he took care of Henry." Dean crossed his arms, sitting, eyes never leaving Hannah's.
"Am I taking you away from someone you love?" Cain asked as they walked to the public square. "People don't cry as much as you look like you have unless they've experienced recent heartbreak."
Cas gave her a hug, a surprising warm radiated from her. He breathed in the faint scent of evergreen pine and quickly pulled away. “Lady Amara, your messenger says you wish to speak to me. May I ask why?”
"As do men." Alastair smirked, "Yes, yes. The whispers of your capture have even reached Eastden. Buried inside of a young nobleman." He pushed the full bowl of porridge aside and leaned close to Dean. "The quieter voices speak ill of the king's new bridegroom."
"I'll give you two hundred right now for him." Cain patted Cas's hand gently when he squeezed his own. "He's talented, and wasting his strengths on an execution seems so barbaric."
Dean didn't answered as he took in the room. The knives, the pillars, the saws. Every tool in the chamber looked covered in blood or rust or both. He looked over the center table: the old wood splintered near the hand restraints, a fingernail lodged in the wood; blood soaked into the center of the table, so much so that there was a circular red stain underneath the table. He finally found his words, "No, not really." He answered, for a moment forgetting his troubles with Cole.
Sam scrunched his eyebrows together, glancing back to the door. "Then who is it? Are you sure it's just not wedding jitters? Marriage is a big commitment, and he'd be nervous with everything that's happened to him during his first marriage."
Dean stood her on the bed, gathering their things into satchels. "His mama is becoming king, baby. He's really important to Eastden, and he can't leave the kingdom." He kissed her temple, packing a few of her dresses. "Don't worry baby. You'll be coming with me."
"There. After his wedding, you'll tell him you're staying with him to advise him, to help him run a kingdom smoothly." He handed the sealed letter to Lucifer and stood from his chair. "We'll have to feign support for his wedding to that rebel."
Dean smiled now, at least there was some way he could get Cas back. “Alright, well you get on that, then. I’ll play it cool around that thing inside of Cas, and we’ll fix him up once we talk to Luxa.”
Cas heard the door close behind Cole, henry’s cries echoing down the hall. His fingers and toes went cold as he laid in his own blood. He glanced up at Cain, a weak smile on his face, “I swear to Noctis, if my child is harmed by your men, I’ll bury a blade in your back.” His vision darkened.
Cas stole a glance to the red mark on her shoulder then quickly returned back to his ring. “Cain has that mark, but it’s on his forearm and it’s much more of a scar.” He took a sip of tea. “Did he give it to you as well?”
Dean's ears went scarlet as he heard the man call Cas sweet. "What do you want?" He gritted through his teeth, trying to hide his anger.
Cain furrowed his brow as Cas told him, "Why didn't Dean tell me? The man must be punished as the filth he is." He turned to leave, but Cas grabbed his hand urgently.
Cas shrugged and crossed his arms over his chest. "My answer is yes. I want to join your rebellion as long as I can. I feel as though Michael is arranging a marriage for me though."
Dean smirked at the light touch. Perhaps he could use Cas's attraction to his advantage. "How will I get your answer, Prince Castiel?" He stood then bowed to the ground.
The following morning Dean woke in a slight daze, his body aching from his long journey and the fights he picked. He stretched his protesting muscles before he got out of the bed. Amara gave him a private room in the castle, but Dean didn't fully unpack his bags. Dean walked over to the water pump in the corner of the room. He smiled in pleasant surprise when warm water met his skin. He pulled his shirt over his head and splashed his chest and neck with water.
"Yeah, I did lose a lot of blood, thanks to you. Luckily I have the most powerful cosmic deity supplying all the power and magic I could ever want." He grinned, twirling his fingers around, shooting off little sparks of magic. "And I had adjusted to peasant life, but you," he shook his finger at Cain, "you had to send a message to get my portrait made by Clarence." He grinned again as he walked over to Cain. "My poor little baby, he was screaming for me, and you took him from me. From Dean." Cas grabbed Cain's throat and lifted him in the air. "Henry wouldn't have had to take the throne. You could've overlooked his lineage. For me, Cain. You said all you wanted was to make me happy. Do I seem happy to you?"
In the following days, Castiel's physician ordered him to stay in bed and made daily visits to him. Cain decided to stick by Cas's side instead of holding audiences. He wanted to support Cas more than ever as his due date approached. Cas wanted Cain to leave him alone, but he couldn't outright tell Cain to go. He didn't care to be bedridden, but he had to listen to his doctor. Early one morning, ten days after the doctor had put his to bed, Castiel woke in a crippling pain. His back burned as his stomach cramped violently. He cried out and gripped Cain's arm tightly. "CAIN...." He groaned, wincing in pain as he shook the king awake.
"He didn't die!" He snapped, standing up from the table in a flash. His sadness turned into a rage, "Cain killed him! He thinks he got away with murdering a helpless newborn. He thinks I perished as I bled out on his floor!" His eyes glowed angrier, ink crawling through his veins to his eyes. "I should've stormed his castle the moment I woke up." He grinned, looking back to the letter. "But here! Here he invites me back home without hesitation to remember me! HA!" He laughed, grabbing the paper.
Cas watched Henry fall asleep again, sighing to himself. "You have to go. Take him with you, please. I can't lose you both."
Cas and Dean talked quietly as they made their way through the castle hallways, then through the courtyard to the cathedral. Cas had actually heard all of the conversation between Michael and Dean; Dean wanted to protect him, and that made his stomach flutter even more than his nerves did. As they entered the cathedral, all eyes turned to be on Cas. He had to walk down the center aisle by himself. If he stumbled, everyone would see him as a klutz. His cheeks went scarlet until he focused on Cain, a smile coming over his face. Once he was with Cain, Michael could never hurt him again. Even Dean wouldn't be able to hurt him if it ever came to that. He cleared his mind as he stood by Cain and listened to the priest recite the vows. Cas repeated them back when he needed to, following the ritual perfectly to show Cain how serious he was.
Cas took the tea with a soft smile. “Thank you, Hannah.” He sipped at the soothing brew. He relaxed as the tea warmed his body, looking up to Hannah. “Have you heard about the rebel leader? He was caught today in bed with a ‘working woman’.”
"The one you've used on Dean?" Cas grinned back. He knew that knife would never kill Cole. He could keep Cole secluded for as long as he wanted and punish him as Cas saw fit. He nodded and followed Alastair to his hidden torture chamber. Alastair put Cole on his table, held out the blade for Cas, then left the prince alone. Cas walked around the table. "Have you been here before? On his carving table? Awaiting a fate worse than death?" Cole mumbled a no, shaking his head. Cas cut his pants away and left the guard exposed. He dragged the jagged knife up Cole's thigh, mere inches from his cock. "I'm going to make sure you never hurt another man or woman again." He pressed the serrated side of the knife to the base of Cole's penis.
Rowena stopped her horse next to Dean’s, “Amara’s powers kept the city alive, but you took that away when you killed her.”
“I’m not a child. I’m twenty.” He frowned. “Besides Cain had a fertility spell on me. His bloodline won’t end with him.” Cas pressed a hand to his stomach. He hadn’t given much thought of being a parent before.
"Of course. He was reborn through Lady Amara's grace." She inhaled deeply, holding the blade with both hands now. She raised the knife above her head, "I offer this man's blood to Amara in her mission to stay youthful and pow - " She stopped and looked at Dean with confusion. They both glanced to the small dagger embedded in Abaddon's stomach. Dean ground the knife deeper into the woman as his rage boiled, the mark glowing an angry scarlet. He shoved her off of him and grabbed her knife from her. He stabbed her dying body over and over, that rage turning into blood-lust. All of the fury with Cain's lack of action to get Cas back and all the guilt and shame from hurting Cas swelled inside his mind, and he expelled every single piece of emotion onto Abaddon's body.
As they approached the gates, the once proud city stood in ruins. Dean stopped his horse in awe, looking to Rowena. “Just a few months ago, this place was thriving. We were just here. There were people, very few people, but they were still here.”
"Because you're a man of action. Cain was going to let me fall out while he called for them to slow down. You just pulled me back into the carriage."
"All the more reason to stay. Anything to make him upset." Cas yearned for more, anything Dean would offer him, he would gladly take. His body ached for Dean's touch.
Cole's color drained from his face as the walls moved on their own. He scratched at the stone for a moment before he turned to face Castiel. "Where have you been, Cas? I thought we'd never get to talk again. Dean threatened me for weeks after you disappeared. But I never wanted to hurt you." He pressed against the wall behind him.
Lucifer crossed his arms and leaned against the wall. "As much as I agree, we can't do much without inciting a war between kingdoms. He's too powerful with too many soldiers to attack outright." He shrugged, a teasing grin on his face. "I think you're afraid of him, now Michael."
Dean pushed past his brother and headed inside Jess's tent to fetch Henry and a cradleboard from Jess. She handed the wriggling infant to Dean, smiling as he pulled the cradleboard from under the bed. "Where are you going with Henry?"
Dean held him as Cas slept, whispering, "of course, cas. I promise. I'll always protect you and Henry..." He kissed his head again. "Always."
"If he goes back with you, he cannot be yours, not entirely." Amara walked back to her throne and sat. "Stay here with us, and if he starts to enjoy your company, I'll think about letting him return with you."
Dean kept his eyes on the piece of stale bread he had picked up. Cas was willing to risk everything for him, and all Dean wanted to do was use him as long as he could. Was he no better than Michael? “Why do you want to do that, Cas? You’ve got your whole life ahead of you, and you’re risking your neck to help me? I just don’t understand.”
~TMC67
Rowena pushed aside the hanging vines as she went inside the bedroom and set her component bags on the bed. “But he ended her reign. Her thousand year reign.” She drew a circle on the floor as she watched Dean at the edge of the room.
"When I brought you here, you were ready to take your life, Castiel. All that pain from Dean breaking off your relationship, Cain betraying your trust about his purpose for you, and Cole... I saved you." She held his face between his hands, an icy glare meeting Castiel's eyes. She extinguished the blue glow as her eyes turned red, "You should show your mother some respect."
Cas brushed his cheek, smiling up at Dean. "I killed him. Right behind my throne. After everything that's happened, I wasn't going to let him get away with it." He rocked Henry gently, "i'm free to be with anyone, Dean." He smiled wider, "I have a coronation celebration tomorrow, what better way to announce an engagement?" He started out of the throne room, heading up to the abandoned nursery. Dean followed Castiel, frowning at everything Cas had told him. He knew Castiel was at risk of following in Amara's footsteps, but he wouldn't let Cas do that as long as he was alive.
Dean punched him again, a satisfying crunch as blood poured from Cole's nose. "Some fun, huh? Maybe I should have some fun with you and my knife. How'd you like that?"
She shook her head, smoothing her long grey green dress out, “Anyone can take control of themselves if they have the strength. Why?”
Dean gulped quietly and took his seat across from Cain. The past week had pained him greatly. In the early mornings, he had Alastair carve his body to pieces, and in the afternoons, he watched Cas wither away because of what he said. He shook his head silently. "No, he hasn't mentioned or said anything to me. He just sits outside on the balcony."
Noctis laughed, throwing his head back. His whole body shook as he stumbled backward in laughter. He gripped both knees as he doubled over. “You insignificant maggot.” He stole the knife from Lucifer, plunging the blade into his side. When he drew it out, the knife was coated in thick, black ink. The wound closed quickly. “You never stood a chance.” He shoved the dagger into Lucifer’s stomach.
“You can’t rush these things, Dean.” She climbed the stairs to the upper level. “You’re sure you can do this? Her spirit quite possibly will be vengeful. I just want you to be prepared for the worst scenario.”
Dean felt himself grow closer to release, and he buried his face back into Cas's neck. "Cas.. Cas.. I'm so close, please can I come inside you..? Please..?" He whined in submission himself, realizing how easily Cas controlled him.
Dean grinned and turned a soft shade of pink, kissing Cas's cheek. "You have to make a show of this, hm?" He laughed softly and started to pull away from Cas to return to the shadows. So many royals in one room made him uneasy. Cas chuckled and watched him slink back to Sam. The feast commenced after Cas finished his announcement. He avoided his brothers' angered glare, a playful smirk across his face. They were playing a delicate game of chess with each other, and Castiel refused to lose.
She spun around to face him and held her hand out to push Cas back and pinned him to the wall. "I love you, and I want you to stay here with me, but I do not tolerate insubordination. I'll give you one more chance, Castiel. Stay with me, with Dean, here for as long as you live."
Hannah's face saddened. "I suppose so. I figured he'd want me to get Henry to safety before helping him. He wanted that more than anything. I'm glad you're here for them. Sam's a good leader, but there's something missing here. I believe you're that something."
Cas shook his head, kissing Dean with a burning urgency. “Just do it. I’m a trooper.” He whispered. He buried his face in Dean’s shoulder to hide the grimace he made when Dean pushed inside him, biting his shoulder to quiet himself. Dean knew why Cas bit him, but he didn’t realize how much he liked the sensation. He gripped Cas’s hip, pressing Cas back into the bed. Dean pressed his head into the groove of Cas’s neck and shoulder, thrusting his hips forward into Cas. Cas groaned happily, a smile coming over his face. “Yes, Dean!” He moaned, arching into Dean’s chest. He gripped Dean’s thick shoulders as Dean moved in and out of him, slowly becoming a tangled mess of moans and whimpers. Dean looked up from his shoulder, staring into the wide pools of blue underneath him. He pushed their lips together between a moan, slowing his movements to a stop. He just wanted to be in this moment with Cas. “Please come back with me,” he whispered.
Cas laid on his back when Dean stopped. “What if he’s noticeably yours?” He whispered, putting Dean’s hand on top of his stomach. “He’s been excited all morning. Kicking and squirming.” Cas smiled, laughing softly.
Hannah and a few other maids brought buckets of steaming water up to the room, right by Dean. Hannah watched the guard carefully and closed the door behind her helpers. Cas stripped behind a screen and sat in the wooden tub after the women had filled it. Dean continued his stoic facade, his ears turning red as he heard Cas in his room. He turned to the stairwell as someone approached. He frowned as Michael approached.
Rowena frowned and pushed her eyebrows together, “What do you mean? Of course there are. Demons and devils can take over you despite your willingness.”
Noctis smirked at the mirror, "You should check on Henry, Dean. I have some business to take care of today."
Meg crossed her arms and sat near his desk. "I found a bag with a fancy circlet in it. Care to explain why you have one,
Cas grinned to himself, pulling on Dean's hair. "Yes, please. Dean. Please, finish... I want you.." He whispered, pulling Dean into a kiss. As the two explored each other's mouth, Dean groaned loudly, burying his cock fully in Cas as he came hot inside of his partner. Cas gasped then inhaled sharply, looking into Dean's fucked out green eyes. His eyes stung as he fought tears, cupping Dean's face. "Dean..?" He asked in a surprised whisper.
Abaddon chuckled softly, "It's an honor to find favor with Lady Amara. She usually takes interest in betrayed women, but after today, she wants to extend her helping hand to you."
Cas shook his head. "My handmaiden usually stays in her quarters, so yes. It's only me in here. Don't you have your own room?" Cas came over and closed the door behind Dean.
"I was with someone for a little while, but he's gone now." His playfulness faded away as he looked sorrowfully over Cas. "He's probably gone for good." Dean glanced over Cas's face, down his slender neck, over his thin shoulders. He sighed resigned, "You remind me of him. Almost identical it seems as if you're the same person."
Cain came over, trying to peek at the infant. "Darling, why? Is he alright? Ten fingers, ten toes?" He smiled, sitting on his side of the bed. He reached for the infant, but Cas pulled him away. "Cas, please. I won't hurt him." He laughed softly.
She peeked over the tome she was reading as Dean entered her room. “Your highness.” She continued to flip through the pages of the book.
Dean put his hands on his hips and paced back and forth next to the pew. "I suppose you're right. Keep this between us for now. I don't need Michael and Lucifer to find out about Cas's strange behavior." Dean walked back to the entryway and took Cas's hand with a defeated smile. "Henry's been calling for you all morning." He looked ahead as the doors opened to start the ceremony.
