“I’m proud of you, Dean,” Sam says with disgusting sincerity. Dean’s eyes burn, and he pulls Sam in for a rough hug.
“Yeah, maybe. And with the right mumbo-jumbo we could try to summon him, bring him right to us.”
. You already do.” Hey, this confessing to a Castiel he can’t see and who can’t say anything back is actually pretty nice. Dean’s aware that that probably makes him an asshole, but Cas lo—likes—
“Little abrupt…” Dick remarks calmly, “but okay.” Dean sheathes his machete while the Leviathan fixes his eyes on Cas. “Castiel. Good to see you again. Thanks for the ride into paradise.” Dick's eyes flick to where Dean is extracting the sharpened and bloodstained bone from his jacket. “And good on you! Pulling that together? A-plus.”
Dean smiles nervously. “Surprise?”
Rufus says something else. Bobby’s face flickers with an expression of interest, reflected in his voice when he asks, “Did he now?” He continues writing the information Rufus is relaying, then asks, “They fish out his bones?” Deanna sighs. Sounds like there’s some grave-robbing in her future.
“I can't care about that, Deanna! I don't have the luxury,” Castiel snaps, before pushing his hand into Aaron’s chest. The boy screams, and Deanna bites her lip, balling her hands up into fists, watching as Aaron screams, his body lighting up from within. He stops screaming and grows still when Castiel withdraws his hand.
Castiel frowns. “Eyes do not offer any insight into a human’s soul, Deanna.”
“I do better with peace and quiet.”
“Relax, Cas,” Deanna says, bristling at his concern but not shrugging off his hands. “He didn’t give me demon juice; it’s in my soul.”
Bobby doesn’t even look up from the King James. “Keep looking, girl. There’s gotta be something, even if it’s only a sentence—hell, even if it’s only a word.”
, Dean catching Cas up on what Sam and Eileen have been up to, carefully avoiding talking about his version of coping. Finally, Dean can’t take it anymore; he knows Cas is with him—in every sense of the phrase—but he feels like he’s suffocating, like Cas planted seeds in his stomach with his goodbye that have been growing ever since, and now Dean is choking on all of the flowers growing in his throat.
if you follow the rules.”
shut behind him. He looks at her for a moment, then, just as quietly, says, “Are you… ‘okay’?”
she chastises herself.
“Yes.”
for this man for whom the burden of saving the world has fallen upon once again.
Bobby's composure breaks, and he pulls Dean into a tight hug which is returned with double the strength, the weight of the past few months—years, really—and all of the countless losses and hurts and betrayals uncoiling slightly from his spine. The two separate, and Bobby shakily says, “It's—it's good to see you, boy.”
“Well, what is it? His face?” she asks. She faces forward again, but reaches into her back pocket for her phone. “Is it something cool? I hope it’s—” she cuts off, feeling Castiel’s fingertips gently skimming the area the ink should be. It’s Deanna’s turn to inhale, sharply, at the brush of his skin against hers.
Cas’ right hand is clasped firmly in Dean’s left, but Dean refuses to think of the gesture as anything but a necessity, even though Cas’ speech before the Empty took him flits around the edges of Dean’s mind on a loop.
“Well,” Jack begins, and Dean is
The archangel waves a hand and Deanna’s surroundings shift and she’s in Bobby’s sitting room.
“A kilt,” the demon retorts, “I had very athletic calves. What's the game?”
Ah. He forgot about the holy water. Dean turns to spit it out, and he dryly says, “I'm not a demon, either, you know.”
“After you got taken, I—um. Well, me and Sam and Jack met up in Hastings. Chuck had erased everyone by that point, except for us. So we figured we had to regroup. Sammy and me noticed Jack doin’ something weird to the plants as he walked by them, and it turns out ever since he became that bomb that was supposed to explode Chuck and Amara? He’s been absorbing energy from things big and small. That’s when our plan started to formulate.
The angel advances upon the hunter. “You think you can knife-fight an angel?” he mocks.
The cemetery is eerily silent, everybody utterly still. Deanna presses one hand against the wound in her stomach, before kicking Raphael over into the circle of holy fire, extinguishing it.
Because if Dean fails? He’ll never get a chance to explain.
Dean tries to muster up the same incredulous tone as last time as he says, “You're kidding, you just let him go off by himself?” He has a feeling he doesn't quite manage it.
Castiel shakes his head. “I detect no hexwork anywhere.”
—Salman Rushdie,
“You don't know what he’ll do to me,” the crossroads demon says desperately. Deanna distantly feels bad for whoever the bitch is possessing; the burn marks linger, glowing orange-red.
, and I think you want that, too.
“Thanks,” Deanna mutters, and gives him a once over. Aside from a bit of blood and a few rips and tears in his trench coat and shirt, the angel seems to be fine. Balthazar is slightly worse off, sporting an oozing cut on his chest and a scowl.
She turns to face him, stowing a gun in her waistband and a dagger in her boot before looking at him.
They're at Room 207 by the time Dean comes back to himself, to 2008, and the door swings open to reveal—
Dean nods, shoulders relaxing slightly from the tense posture he’d held ever since Castiel first walked in. Castiel is gladdened he could at least do that much for his friend. “Yeah, Cas,” Dean confirms, a slight smile illuminating his face. “Together.”
The drive back to Sioux Falls is just under six hours, and the quiet of the car makes her teeth ache.
Dean continues walking as the voice—is that Meg?
“Well, it's something,” Dean says. “Right?”
The song ends, and Deanna shuts off the radio. “Yeah, hopefully soon. Wanna get this over with.”
Deanna eyes the angel. “What did you do that for?”
Finally, the roof begins to rattle, the panels flapping up and down. The two hunters grab a shotgun each, and retreat to the back of the warehouse.
before she drops into dreamland, but they’re probably gonna die tomorrow; might as well go into the fight with her patchwork heart resting in Cas’ hands. She can’t think of a safer place for it to be.
“As a heart attack. It's high noon, baby.”
“Just wondering if the two of you were planning on standing here grinning at each other like idiots all day, or if we might attempt to defeat Raphael at some point in the next century.” With that, he disappears, and Cas tilts his head as if he’s listening.
“No.”
Cas out of the cosmic afterlife going to be easy, because when were things ever easy for the two of them?
One day, long after Chuck groveled in the dirt, long after Jack tripped a little light fantastic and walked away, long after a quiet drive filled with too long and too full silences, Dean realizes he can’t go on.
Dean wanted to just crawl right over and lick and suck Cas’ nipples for him, but he refrained, his breath catching in his throat as he watched them harden. “Mm...is this how you like to touch yourself usually, or is this just a performance for me?”
he had never had a partner that made him want to come back for more before. But there Dean was, collapsed on the bed, hand full of cum, and the last thing he wanted to do was run out the door.
“Thanks.” Dean closed the door behind her and walked back over to his bed, climbing in. “But, listen. It’s not gonna help me sleep at all if you just stand there and stare at me. So would you mind sitting with me?”
“Night,” Dean replied, stretching himself out across Cas as he slowly fell asleep. It’d been a weird day, both good and bad, and he was relieved it was over. And draped over Cas like this, it was the best sleep he’d had in months.
“Mm.” Dean swallowed his release eagerly, then slowly pulled off, looking into his eyes. They were both sticky messes at that point, but he didn’t care; he crawled up on top of Cas and pressed a kiss to his cheek. “You know, I was thinking about doing that to you the whole concert,” he murmured.
Dean nodded, patting his pocket for his phone and looking around in a panic when he couldn’t find it. He dove into the couch, feeling around until he’d grasped it. It had fallen behind the cushion and he sighed a little, quickly calling for a car.
"I would have taken the job regardless." He answered bluntly, drawing himself to his feet. He was in no position to turn down a job."Yes."
Dean reared his head beneath Cas’ chin, taking a deep breath to breathe him in, his body engulfed in warmth and lightness. His heart was racing and he clung to Cas, committing this perfect moment to memory so he could look back on it whenever he wasn’t with him.
"Yeah, a little," he replied, but he really hadn't. He surely wasn't as good as Dean thought, and he felt like he was really just a weight on Dean. He was just caught up in the lust-filled fantasy for now. But surely Dean would get bored. Eventually.
“What, huh?” Dean groaned, rubbing his eyes sleepily and pouting at the lack of contact as Cas climbed off of him.
Cas shook his head. "No, what are they about?" He asked curiously, tipping his head back and finishing off his beer.
as life becomes hectic again, we will not be able to update this fic as regularly as before, but we promise, this fic will NOT be abandoned, and will be completed, no matter how long it takes. Thanks for hanging in there and for your continued support and feedback. It means a lot!
“Uh...in this suit? I can try...but I may not go very fast.” Dean slid his phone back into his pocket and did another sweep of the room with his eyes to make sure he hadn’t left anything behind.
Dean smirked, licking the mousse off his tip before swallowing him down as far as he could without choking. “Mm...” he hummed around his shaft. Cas always tasted good to him, but this was even better.
Dean couldn’t help but laugh. “Chill out, chill! It was an accident. I’m just going through every channel! Goddamn.” He switched it off to a sports channel instead, not that he wanted to watch it.
Dean smiled a little as he walked in, setting what he’d brought down on the table and making his way over to Cas.
"I'm not jealous. Not of that hippie looking fuck up with a drug problem." She screeched, getting out of the bed and pulling her clothes on. He had her in a checkmate and she clenched her teeth;
Brad sighed. He really didn’t want to leave a trail. But he supposed he could set up a throwaway account. “Fine. God, you rich people are so high-maintenance.”
“Consider it a hidden talent.” He pulled out a few miniature bottles of whiskey and set them on the table. “I think I’ve found the solution to being trapped in here with you.” He smirked.
"I apologize. I got caught up in the moment." He murmured, his eyes on Dean as he blinked sleepily. "Yeah, alright. I'm too tired to go back to my room, anyway." Which was half a lie. He also hated sleeping alone, even if all he would have was a warm body within arms reach.
As they were let into the next booth that came along, despite the frustration of the people they cut in front of, the door was locked securely behind them. It was larger than Cas expected. Spacious, with a small couch in the center of the pod. Cas immediately moved to the railing, glancing around the room.
Dean stopped after about three shots’ worth. It was enough to give him a pleasant buzz, but not so much that Cas would get upset with him. “See? Isn’t this better already?” He chuckled.
“Thanks.” Dean smiled, scooting the cart over to him and starting on the waffles. “Mm!” He exclaimed with his mouth full. “These are awesome.”
“And whose fault is it that it got caught on tape, Jo? Can you tell me that? Because there’s no way some random fan would be able to just sneak into my room and install cameras.”
Dean went through the motions of his party, trying to make it as pleasant an experience as possible for his fans, but he wasn’t fully present. He played a few songs, took some selfies, danced, then said goodnight. A few complained, saying that the party wasn’t at all like what they were expecting, but he simply told them the rumors about how his parties went weren’t true. He hoped he could soon shake that part of his reputation.
"Good boy." He easily switched to Dom mode, a fluid motion as he grabbed Dean's thighs and pulled him down, making a show of handcuffing Dean’s arms to the bed and making sure he could pull them off. He grinned, settling between Dean’s legs. "Do you know how lonely it is to come while someone watches? The torture of the build up with no release?" He smirked, slapping the inside of Dean’s thighs.
"Yes." Cas pressed a kiss to Dean's forehead and ushered him under the water, rinsing his body down with soap to keep Dean distracted. Surely he would stop thinking about spiders if Cas was washing his thighs.
, was all Dean could think as Cas grabbed him. It was enough to knock the breath out of him completely, but he didn’t hesitate in kissing back, his hands gripping at the fabric of the back of Cas’ shirt, bunching it up in his fists.
drunk. I still remember everything that happened.” He smirked, climbing out of the tub and grabbing a towel off the rack to wrap around him. “I normally get room service up here for breakfast, but it hasn’t come yet. Did you see them?”
"For fuck’s sake, only you would find the damn porn channel." He scoffed, taking a seat back on his side of the bed. “Sports, huh? Didn't pick you for a fan."
"I'm glad you found it fun." He smiled a touch, leaning in to press a soft peck to Deans head. "Are you heading back, or staying here tonight?" He asked softly.
"Great. If I'm stuck in here with you for half an hour, I’m going to kill you and then myself." He was being dramatic. It wasn't such a bad thing, he just...wasn't the biggest fan of enclosed spaces.
“I’m not. Just...trying to get away from the porn.” Dean chuckled again. Cas’ reaction was better than he’d expected. He continued to flip through, finding the movies. “Movie? Or is that too long?”
"What? Drinking?" Cas asked, bending down to pick up one of the small bottles. It was good, better than the cheap stuff he usually drank.
"Considering you are throwing around money without care, I'm sure if you slip the security guard a decent amount, we might get one of the VIP capsules and be bumped to the front.”
Cas rolled his eyes. "You are going to keep bothering me this whole ride huh?" He glowered, moving closer and pushing Dean back. "Sit on the chair.” He couldn't help it. He could act like he didn't want it, but he wanted to hear Dean moan again, wanted to feel his fingers tug and pull at his long hair desperately.
Cas shot Dean a message although he wasn't sure if he would get it before going onstage.
Dean couldn’t help but smile a little, glancing down at their hands. This was extremely weird for him, but not in a bad way. His free hand gently traced lines and shapes into Cas’ chest and he let out a soft sigh.
Dean laughed, leaning over to kiss his temple. “I fucked Jo. You wanna pretend today never happened?” It wasn’t easy navigating back to the hotel. One of them was extremely hungover and the other was wearing sunglasses in pitch black, but somehow they managed.
"You are the one who is dressed like they are at a fashion show in Milan. This is how average people dress." He gave Dean a disdained look.
"How is it you manage to find alcohol any place you go?" Cas asked, but honestly, he could use a drink. "Do they have any whiskey? Or beer?" Cas moved forward to stand next to Dean, peering over his shoulder.
"The London Eye is an option. You can get a private capsule and be away from the public?" He suggested, his eyes moving to look at Dean properly.
Dean's pleas had Cas hard and preleaking. He growled again, reluctantly pulling back and reaching for the mousse. He slipped Deans boxers down so he was completely naked and took it upon himself to coat Deans cock in the cool chocolate. He hummed happily at his work, leaning down and kissing the tip, then slowly lapping up the mousse.
Dean slipped him out of his mouth, looking up into his eyes to watch the ecstatic expression on his face. “Come for me,” he urged, then sank back down, bobbing his head quickly.
Cas narrowed his eyes. Of course it would be, but he wasn't telling Dean that. "You are an idiot." He scoffed, drawing himself to his feet.
“Okay, but he got fired for having sex with me, right? And you just had sex with me. So how is that fair to him?”
Their little room reached the ground and the doors opened, Dean putting his boots, hat, and sunglasses back on, then stepping out.
"Why does my appearance matter?" He asked with a huff of annoyance. "I’m wearing all black. It's not like I am wearing a fruit headdress.”
“Ah, dammit. Where’s my phone?” Dean grumbled as she left. He felt like he needed a shower. Nearly stepping on it on his way to pick up his clothes, his eyes widened when he saw he had a message from Cas. He’d forgotten he’d left one for him in the first place. He pressed play.
Cas slipped his hands down, suddenly feeling a well of nerves building.
“I think the two of us can have a much more fun party if you’re up for it.”
Cas sucked on Dean's nipple, giving it all his attention as his fingers lifted Dean's waist, giving him room to move as he needed to strip out of his clothes. He moved over to Dean's other nipple, licking and nipping at the bud slowly.
Breathless, he arrived in front of Cas’ motel and grabbed the hidden key, unlocking it and stepping inside.
"Do you have proof of this?" Crowley asked, knowing full well that neither of them did. "And your concert is in a few hours, Mr Winchester. While I implore you to explore security options, I assure you that you will not find ones with this short notice."
Cas eyes fell on Dean once again, wondering what he had to be huffy about. He could hook up with whoever, and now Cas would have to stand there and watch. And he hated it. He looked down at his hand, the ghost of a phone number still on it. Maybe it was worth giving the guy a call. Switch out with another guard under the vise of not feeling well. He needed some time, away from Dean.
“Oh my god. Crowley, are you fucking kidding me? You can’t fire everyone, but keep Meg. She took advantage of Castiel, you know. She’s horrible. I’ll just find a new security company if Meg is gonna be the one in charge.”
Cas dropped to his knees in front of Dean, his eyes lifting to meet his for a brief second. This was something he could do well. He caught Dean's zipper between his lips and tugged it down, his fingers flicking open the button. He brushed his tongue over Deans clothed cock, taking the fabric between his teeth and growling a little as he pulled at them.
Then, always needing to have the last word, Raphael signaled to his followers and so the fighting began.
“It wasn’t you, obviously. It was Lucifer, pretending to be you.” Two squeezes. Dean laughs. “Yep, your old man woke him up from this fucking place to help out. But gimme a minute, I’ll get to that. See, he lies and says it was the Entity that booted him and that it wants him to have Chuck’s book to use. Lucifer brought a reaper with him, and kills her so that she becomes the new Death. She was the first reaper to die since Billie, so…” Dean trails off, well aware that Castiel has firsthand knowledge of what killing a reaper means. “She heads off to read the book, and when she comes back she says she knows how Chuck ends.
“Daddy?” a voice says from behind him.
“Yes. It's—it's been sawed off.”
The dead hunters—whose name Deanna discovers are Wayne, Jake, Taylor, and Beth—burn as those left look on in silence. The group disperses soon after the flames turn to embers, heading back to their corners of the country. Garth manages to grab Deanna into another tight hug; his left arm is broken and he’s missing a tooth, but he waves off Cas’ offer to heal him, saying, “Nah, man, I’m good. I’ll patch up au naturale. Thanks anyhow, dude!” The hunter drives away from Singer Salvage Yard with a
Sam nods again. “Sure thing.”
“No,” Jack says. “It will be—difficult. I can open a doorway, but it’s going to be a trial. For both of you.”
“Yeah?”
...Hang on.
“Why?”
“Well. That’s good.” She pauses. “Wait. You can see my soul?” She doesn’t know whether to feel creeped out or embarrassed—or both.
Later, much later, Deanna drives them back to Bobby’s, Cas sitting shotgun with his hand warm on her thigh. They tiptoe up the stairs to the guest room, falling into bed in a tangle of satiated limbs. Deanna sighs, and presses close to Cas under the blankets.
Dean and Bobby exchange glances. “Must be the wrong room,” the latter concludes, before Sam steps into their line of view, saying, “Hey, is…” and then stopping dead when he sees just who's at the door.
Dean can feel Bobby's eyes on him, probably wondering how he knew before, but the older hunter just says, “Well, don't get me wrong: I'm sure gladdened that Sam's soul remains intact, but it does raise a sticky question.”
and some clattering, followed by the unmistakable sound of flesh hitting flesh, then thumping, growing closer with each subsequent noise.
“Chuck beats us up pretty badly: he decided not to snap us out of existence because he wanted to hurt us around one more time, I guess, which releases
The bones burn.
Deanna flicks her lighter on and off. “You hear that, Crowley?” On and off. “That's me flicking my Bic for you.” On and off, on and off. She can hear Bobby say, “Going once,”
The angel swivels his head to look at her head-on, eyes silver-pale and liquid in the weak moonlight. “Why
“Seriously? The three of us spent, like, a week straight doing nothing but reading your crap,” she gestures at said pile of crap, “and you find something in the couple of days you
“Yeah. Yeah, I did,” Deanna replies.
Castiel looks down at the floor briefly, and Deanna takes that as her chance to jump in. “I’m guessing Cas already tried the whole ‘appeal-to-your-morals’ righteous crap, right?”
The unfamiliar voice chuckles. “Same thing happened to Lot's wife. Iodize the poor sucker, and your kitchen is stocked for life,” he laughs.
“Okay, but,” Deanna clears her throat, which had, at some point during that little speech, been filled with a lump. “Why does that stop you from flying off to get more of your friends to help us out against Raphael? The more guys we get on our side, the better the chance we have of preventing Apocalypse two-point-oh, and making sure Sammy didn’t die for nothin’.”
“You sure I'm even me, Dean?”
“So, it’s a matter of control,” Castiel says mildly. She scowls.
Deanna pauses. Truthfully, she hadn’t given it a thought until Castiel had mentioned it just now. She’d been so wrapped up in worry and guilt over the angel borrowing her bed, and she wracks her brain trying to remember until—
Lightning striking and setting the dry grass alight, way too close for comfort, fending off an angel and driving her blade into his heart before diving behind a grave for cover.
It’s also the times when they were so low on food, Dean resorted to giving Sam the full sandwich and eating the scraps—the crust—and the times he carefully picked mold off of the loaves to make a passable meal.
“—But you can’t kill an archangel, yeah, I remember,” she finishes.
“Anyway, Michael says he’ll help us out. We didn’t take him at his word, Cas,” Dean rushes to add before Cas can stop the blood flow to his hand. “But we figured we may as well keep him close, see if he could be useful. Thank fuck we did. He was honestly pathetic, just seemed to want Daddy to love him. When we got back to the bunker, we asked Michael to open Chuck’s death book, but he didn’t have the juice. Oh, well. Didn’t end up mattering.”
Bobby sits down, and Dean knows that's his cue to ask about Sam. “So, uh… Sam. He okay? I couldn't reach him before.”
“He has no face.”
“Dean.” Jack looks frustrated, looks like he might start crying, and Dean realizes he’s gotta tone down the asshole. The kid lost Cas, too: one of his fathers. Dean decides to be kinder to this God than he was to the last. Or try, at least. He’s not got a great track record when it comes to dealing with figures of authority, okay?
“It’s the best lead we’ve got, Deanna,” Bobby rebuffs her. “We oughtta chase it, see where it takes us.”
“Well, why not us?” Sam posits. “We beat Chuck at his own game, what’s to say we can’t do the same for the Empty?”
Sam clears his throat. “So! What’s the plan?”
—Richard Siken,
Castiel grabs her by the shoulders and spins her around so they’re toe to toe. “Ramiel was able to pull the lance from this area. It resided in his energy—his
“This is pointless,” Deanna groans, seven hours and five cups of coffee later, head thumping down onto the copy of
“I know, I should look like a Thriller video reject.”
Deanna squints at him in bemusement. “You think your Heaven would be the guestroom of Bobby’s house?”
graveyard. This could be the basket of a big balloon. Leave the lights
“That's what I thought. Let's go, Sam,” Dean says, and they stand, leaving the demon sitting there, fuming. Dean pulls out some cash and drops a ten dollar bill. He holds it up and drops it on the table like an insult. “For the pie.”
Bobby puts the flame thrower over the metal tub and the demon screams in pain. After a few moments, Bobby lowers the flame thrower. Burns have appeared on the demon’s vessel, starkly red against her skin.
Regardless, the Lance of Michael forms in her hand, a flash of lightning causing the Enochian etched silver to glow, before she drives it straight through Raphael’s heart.
A bit of myrrh and one sliced up palm later, Castiel is able to locate Balthazar. “Got him. Let's go.”
“Look at you, all in a rush,” the demon mocks. “Foreplay…” she pauses, uncrossing and recrossing her legs, “…gets you more play.” Deanna rolls her eyes.
“Don't worry about it!” Ed slams the door shut.
The kid points the staff at her, fingers tightening around it. Castiel teleports next to him and takes away the staff.
Garth emerges from the steps leading downstairs and opens his mouth to say something, but Bobby grumbles, “Not yet, Garth,” and the hunter closes his mouth and takes a seat on the sofa.
Dean’s sure he’s gaping at Jack like the big, dumb human he is, but any hope he might’ve had for Jack to swoop in all
Not that he was trying all too hard, really; Sam has been splitting his time between the bunker and Eileen’s place, and Dean’s happy for them, honest. It’s just… They’re happy, or content, or something close to that, and Dean tries to smile for Sam when he’s around, show him he’s coping with—things, but sometimes he’s afraid that the longer he wears this mask, the more cracks it accumulates, the harder it will be when it inevitably falls off.
“So, what, I’m using, like... soul magic?” Deanna questions, apprehensive.
The archangel’s blade falls to the ground and he looks up at her, eyes wide with genuine emotions: shock, anger, fear. Deanna, her hand still on the wooden shaft of the lance, leans forward.
“Okay, but... what is Chuck Heston's disco stick doing down here, anyway? I mean, don't you guys put away your toys?”
The demon, gasping from the pain, breathlessly says, “I can't.”
Dean ignores the jibe, instead questioning, “But I’m holding his damn hand! ‘Course I’m gonna know Cas is with me.”
Bobby looks at her, furious exhaustion in his eyes. “I gave it my best effort.”
Dick explodes, Dean barely getting an arm up to shield his face,
“No. He just said I could have justice, but I was gonna have to take it myself. He... he gave me the stick.”
“Huh,” she says, “That’s not a bad idea.”
“Deanna?”
“They were trained to be generals,” Castiel picks up the thread of information. “To lead demonic armies in the war against Heaven.”
“Is that a hidden safe?”
“O-kay. Meaning what?”
“Hey, what do you say we stop for lunch? I could go for some food.”
“I do better with peace and quiet.”
“It's never happened before,” he responds. “An angel is buying souls. That could explain why he cut the staff into pieces.”
as Lucifer snapped his neck and hearing the roar as the ground yawned open before Sam jumped in, dragging Adam-as-Michael (or is it Michael-as-Adam?) with him, and the explosion of gore as Cas—
“Look,” Deanna cuts him off. “We know the truth, all right? Chris didn't have a gun on him when those cops shot him. They set him up.”
The King of Hell disappears between one blink and the next.
He can still recall with startling clarity the way Cas busted—literally—into his life the first time around. The way the angel saw through him in an instant, the head tilt that preceded the question that rattled Dean to the core:
“Looks like you paid attention at Bible camp.”
The first week at Singer Salvage Yard holds that same silence, the hushed grief she was only beginning to experience on her way back from Stull Cemetery making itself known everytime she weaves through the scrapyard, or stumbles downstairs to make her and Bobby coffee and unthinkingly sets out a third mug, or manifests in the way she’s unable to look Bobby in the eye without hearing a sickening
“Dunno. We wait for Bobby to call back, I guess.” She picks grass off her jeans.
“Please don't kill my dad,” the kid begs. “It was me. I did it.”
“Yes, I remember,” Castiel responds, then he furrows his brow. “Why? Are you going to make me go to another den of iniquity?”
Well, that’s not quite right. He can see just fine; it’s just that as far as the eye can see, there’s only abyssal blackness.
“Yes, I'm afraid so. But we’ve stumbled onto one of them. We must find the weapon that did this.”
or whatever and save his sorry ass from the current hellish existence he’s living is gone, and it feels like his heart is being crushed, same as the last time he saw Billie.
Not disbelief. Too final, certain, closed. Itself a kind of belief.
The dark road ahead of her is blurry; she swipes angrily at her eyes, one-handed.
—Zelda Fitzgerald,
“That’s what I just said, girl,” Bobby grumbles, then flips to another page in the book marked by a yellow sticky note. This page has another painting, presumably also of Michael, this time in flight, wings in shades of brilliant blues and tawny browns and faded charcoal. He’s once again about to deal the killing blow to a figure that Deanna realizes must be—
“Yeah, so? If we get a hold of the lance, that’s gotta kill him, right?”
She hears a rustle—fabric?—then a deep voice says, “They don't listen, Castiel, because their hearts are mine.” She grimaces.
“What did you do to him?” the kid asks.
Castiel steps back, the back of his knees hitting the bed. He gives her a once-over, eyes going unfocused. “I see,” he murmurs after a while, gaze sharpening again.
Dean glances at him, askance. “What?”
“Well, Cas doesn’t wanna be ‘the new sheriff in town,’” the archangels informs her. Deanna turns to Cas in surprise; he’s looking at Gabriel with hope shading the blue of his eyes. The Trickster continues, “So I’m gonna strap on my gun and badge and,” he heaves an exaggerated sigh, “run Heaven. Ugh.”
Raphael tilts his head back, and brilliant white light flares from his eyes and mouth and Deanna has to look away. When she’s able to see again, it’s the sight of Raphael slumped forward, the Lance of Michael sticking out of his back. Dead.
Castiel nods, waiting for Dean to continue. When no further words pass through his lips, Castiel prods, “And Sam? What of him?”
Dean knows he’s been watching their exchange like a semi-interesting tennis match thus far, but hearing that. Well. “Sounds like hell.”
Deanna forces her hands to relax. “Well? Did you at least get a name? What is it?”
Dean hesitates, before replying, “I don't know. Woke up in a pine bo—”
“We'll talk to him. Or if he's not in the talking mood, we'll... work him over.”
Deanna eyes first the symbols critically, committing them to memory in case she needs to block out the ever present ears of the God Squad again because she’s in hiding (or, like, masturbating), then turns her shrewd gaze to Castiel, green eyes taking in his form once again. Now that they’re inside, he seems even more off, blue irises standing out from the dark shadows underscoring his eyes and posture slumped in a way she’d call exhaustion in any another person. She exchanges a look with Bobby, but he just nods his head at her as if to say,
“I thought you wanted nothing to do with Heaven,” Deanna accuses. “What’s the catch?”
Cas moves to sit in the chair opposite Dean, fingers dragging along Dean’s spine as he goes. The icy trickle that follows his touch brings the spasms in Dean’s back to a more manageable level, the Grace giving a welcome reprieve to the pain.
“I thought he died in the war,” the angel replies, distantly.
“Haven't talked to him for months, though.”
“Deanna. If I get the name, I can work a ritual to track the angel down.”
“Dean,” Sam tries. “If you know the myth, then you know why it has to be you. Come on, man.”
“No time for questions, Deanna. Just do it!” the hunter demands.
“There’s no way of knowing that.”
“'Cause of Christopher Birch.” Ed knocks over a bottle of booze. He watches it spill for some time. “Oh, damn it.”
It’s brutal, and bloody, and Deanna quickly loses count of the number of angels she drops, their Grace exploding white from their eyes and mouth, Cas at her back doing the same.
He nods to himself, then informs her, “Balthazar has brought Bobby, Rufus, and Garth to Stull Cemetery. Are you ready?”
He breathes in, the air stale and warm, before realizing it's not the darkness that feels so confining, but instead the space itself. His eyes dart around uselessly, before—
He looks at her, face slightly twisted in a moue of displeasure.
—Joy Harjo,
“C’mon, man,” he’s saying to the others at the table, mouth full of food. Sam wrinkles his nose and Dean laughs. “We kicked some spooky ass today, let’s at least call this a win.”
“Does the name Ramiel mean anything to you?” Crowley asks.
, and continues, “It sounds like a name to me, Dean.”
“I thought about asking, you know?” Dean says, wishing for the alcoholic fuzz he’s so used to now, but he has to go it alone—what a surprise. “Asking you, that is. If you’d bring him back. Hell, Chuck brought Lucifer back from there, and you’re more powerful than he was, I’d guess.” Jack is silent, so Dean continues. “I realized, though, that maybe—maybe he doesn’t
“Don’t be sorry,” he tells her, and runs his fingers through her hair. She would never admit to it in the cold light of day, but in the coziness of the room with just the two of them, she nuzzles into the touch and sighs, content.
Deanna huffs. “Yeah, ‘cause angels are known to do the morally right thing. He took some kid’s freaking soul, Cas, I don’t really have much faith in the idea this guy will help us out just ‘cause we ask. He may have been your friend once, but that was before he faked his own death,” Deanna stops walking, and snakes a hand out to grab Castiel’s arm so he does the same. “We need a backup plan.”
Castiel, who’d been staring at the stars overhead, turns to face her as well. “I’m well, thank you,” he responds stiffly.
“Hands off, isn’t that what you said?” Dean starts at his brother’s voice, not having noticed Sam entering the room due to his total focus on what Jack was saying.
Bobby looks at the flame.
“Then, Jack said he sensed some kind of presence. Couldn’t tell what it was, but we figured we’d check it out. If it was friendly, great. If not, well… we didn’t have anything to lose at that point. Eventually, we wind up at a church. The kid says the presence is coming from inside, so we head in. Turns out it was Michael.” Cas grips his hand twice, with urgency. “Yeah. It was just him, too; when Chuck wiped out humanity, Adam got sent to Heaven.” Dean thinks it over. “Looking back, I’m glad the poor bastard wasn’t sharing that meatsuit.
“Mind your tone with me, boy. I'll drag you back to Hell myself.”
“Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on.”
“Sure,” Deanna says agreeably. “We'll have to do that when I get back.”
“Bobby, they’re just paintings. Besides, we know how much the Bible got wrong, so even if the artists
“So, are you two, like… together?” Ruby interjects. Sam turns to her in surprise, like he'd forgotten she was there.
Well, that’s not a strictly true statement, is it? Cas literally can’t talk, according to the Entity’s rule, so Dean soldiers ahead without saying a word, determined to get them the hell out of this graveyard before anything goes wrong.
Dean sighs. “Easier, this time. Knew what we had to do so we got it done pretty quick. I only wish—” He cuts off.
Castiel can't do anything but nod in response, ready to follow the Righteous Man—no. Ready to follow
Dean bites back both the
his fingers, and Dean is instantly entirely sober.
“Deanna.”
Empty.
“What happened?” Castiel asks. Deanna shrugs.
“Hey,” she softly says, “it’ll turn out fine. Just you wait. Balthazar is gonna bust in here any day now with the lance, and then we’ll kick that teenage mutant ninja angel in the ass.”
Dean must be allergic to this room; his eyes continue to burn and his surroundings swim in front of him. Dean tries to center himself, picturing the tableau that is his for the taking if he succeeds: him, Sam, Jack, and Cas, sitting in the bunker’s kitchen with some beers. The image shifts, becoming broader: Eileen is laughing at Charlie’s attempts at copying a complicated sign, Jody, Donna, and the girls all sitting in the library with them, complaining about sheriff duties and that werewolf Claire killed in Lubbock all by herself despite Kaia’s protests that she helped, too!
“Why?”
The hunter snorts, before clarifying: “With Heaven and all. You led a revolution, boy, ain’t you gonna have the run of the place?”
So Dean pretends to be coping when his brother’s around, drinks too much when Sam’s gone, and doesn’t hunt.
Cas and Bobby both nod, having set everything up as the five of them, plus Rufus and Garth, had discussed earlier.
She smiles. “Hey, Cas. Wanna join me?” She pats the space next to her in invitation. Castiel nods, carefully climbing onto the hood and mimicking her recline against the windshield, eyes on the stars.
Hey everyone,
They had been out all night. Cas toppled off Dean, scrambling to pull his clothes on  “Dean-" Cas hissed.
Dean smirked, watching the expression on Cas’ face turn before he pulled back, his nose gently nudging at his cock. “Mm. You liked that? You want more?”
“Hey. So uh...interesting night for both of us, huh?”
"Hey Dean, I’m kinda tired," He lied, needing some time to think without what could only be the sexiest man alive spread out on top of him.
Dean stayed back at the bar and made a few phone calls, drumming his fingernails impatiently on the table. Luckily, it was only 1PM back in LA, so he got ahold of his bank quickly to explain the situation so his card wouldn’t get frozen. That was the last thing he needed.
"It's a talent, actually. I must say, getting you worked up in the shower is very exciting for me." He flashed Dean a  cocky smile, brushing his fingers up through his dark hair and flexing a little, eyes on Dean.
"I’m okay with that." Cas pressed his chocolate-covered fingers against Dean's lips, pushing them inside his mouth slowly. He took his time, his fingers caressing his tongue and rubbing against the inside of his cheek. He growled, pulling them out slowly and wiping the rest off on the cheap sheets. He then dipped his down, starting off slowly as he licked and sucked the melting chocolate mousse from Dean's smooth chest.
Dean shook his head.
“No, you don’t wanna know. But why don’t you want it back, Cas? What happened?” Dean retreated his hand, letting it settle awkwardly back in his lap.
Dean groaned, keeping closer to Cas. He should’ve brought a hat or something. He wasn’t thinking. So he was stuck posing for seemingly a hundred selfies.
“Okay, Uh. It’ll be here in ten minutes.”
Dean sighed, letting her hold onto him and he wrapped his arms around her waist. “Can I ask you for a favor?” He murmured, glancing down at her.
Cas rolled his eyes. "No wonder she gave you a disapproving look; you eat like a monster.” He chuckled, grabbing his own fries and burger and sitting beside Dean again.
There was a pause before Cas answered. "If you’d like," Cas replied in his monotonous ‘professional’ voice, making his way to the phone to cancel Dean's request. He was tired and just a little bit too sober. The whole mood had dropped and now he just wanted to go. Leave and wallow in his own self-pity. "If you would prefer for me to officially call you Dean on duty, I can." He stated.  "Would there be anything else you require of me tonight?"
Cas was surprised that Dean didn't ask him to move his cart for him but he would take it as Dean’s manners from his childhood kicking in a little. Cas drew himself to his feet. "Do you have any siblings?"
“I’m wearing a t-shirt and jeans, Castiel, even if they are designer. You’re...I don’t even know. But if you’re trying not to stand out, it’s not really working.”
“Mm.” Dean closed his eyes, enjoying Cas’ touch. He moved his hands up to grip his shoulders and smiled a little. “Feels good,” he murmured.

“You didn’t put me in danger, Cas. And I wasn’t...using you for pleasure. I...” Dean gritted his teeth. “This is all Jo’s fault. She set us up. She hired someone to install cameras in my room. She wanted you gone because she’s jealous. Don’t let her win.”
“What? Where? Holy shit!”
"Better than meh." He rolled his eyes, nudging Dean gently. He was going to say something sarcastic, but the look on Dean's face meant he was serious. He reached down and laced his fingers gently with Dean’s, squeezing it just a touch. Weirdly, it felt more intimate than the sex they’d just had. "You are welcome," he murmured.
When Cas finally scraped himself off the cool cement, he brushed himself off and headed downtown. It took a while and when he finally reached a comfortable motel, he paid the overly expensive room fee with the little money he had left and took the key, making his way in. He showered, cleaning the previous night from his mind. He wanted to see Dean’s concert but he had no ticket and hell, security wasn't going to let him in. So he did some searching around on his phone and found a fan site where he could pay a fee and watch a life feed of the concert.
“Okay.” Dean took her off his lap and got up. “Lay down, I’ll be right back.” He walked over to his suitcase and opened the small pocket on the side, taking out a condom.
"What do you want to talk about, Dean? The fact that I would lose my job? My credibility? I would look like some cock sucking whore? I mean, come on. Your life wouldn't change. If anything, the lgbtq+ community would probably praise you, but me? Come on, Dean. It wouldn't end well for me. I'm getting paid to protect you. Not, service you."
“Oomf!” Dean groaned as he was shoved back, the wind knocked out of him by Cas’ intense kiss. He hadn’t been expecting that. He was simply going to lean over and suck him off, but this was...better? A surge of heat shot through him and though he’d just spent the last several hours entangled with strangers, it turned him on again.
"Dean. One cycle around this goddamn Ferris wheel is 30 minutes. I thought you said it was only a few minutes!" He groaned in annoyance, eyes glowering as he rounded on the rock star.
"Okay, come on. We need to make sure we can sneak you back in," Cas murmured, reluctantly pulling back. He scooted to the door of the limo, then immediately froze, seeing the last person on earth that he wanted to see at that moment.
"Mm." Cas gave a small nod. It looked like what a typical day in London was, well, what he had heard anyway. The dreary clouds, cool weather and herds of people. Unfortunately with Dean not wearing any kind of disguise, they would be stopped quite a lot.
“I don’t require anything. But if you want to stay here and maybe...not act like you’re at work for a bit, I wouldn’t mind.”
"I didn't think you would even want to mention last night," Cas said honestly. Mostly when these moments happened out of passion or a drunk error of judgement, they were ignored. "I don't think it would be professional to do it again," He said slowly, but that didn't mean that he didn't want to. The tip of his tongue was still reminiscent of the taste of Dean’s skin no matter how many times he brushed his teeth and Dean’s moans stirred something in him he couldn't smother.
“If I told you, you’d probably lose immediately.” Dean chuckled. “You sure you wanna risk that?” He bit his lip, leaning forward a little, almost challengingly.
“Mmmf.” Dean began to rock his hips forward into Cas’ mouth, reaching down to lightly tug at his hair. This was far better than any drunken party blowjob he’d received.
“Damn straight. Bottoms up.” Dean laughed, taking off the top of the small bottle and tipping back it like a shot. He went for another one, already feeling better.
He grabbed Dean's collar and pulled him closer, "Dean. I’m going to have to ask you to shut up and kiss me," he breathed out, losing any kind of self control in that moment.
“Yeah...honestly, I’ve fucked a lot of girls like her, but not nearly that bad. “You know the worst part? Her name was Kandii. Spelled with a K and two Is at the end. Isn’t that awful?”
Once they were gone, Dean changed into his normal clothes and went to the sink, filling a glass with water and placing the flowers he’d picked up onstage in it. He grabbed his sunglasses and jacket and looked around, knowing Meg was right outside and it would be more difficult to escape than the last time. So he’d have to go out a different way. He quietly opened the balcony door and stepped onto it, making his way down the fire escape. This might’ve been the scariest thing he’d ever done as he was on the top floor and terrified of heights, but he eventually made it to the bottom, the small glass with flowers having spilled in his jacket and the glass dropped and shattered, but the flowers were still intact and that was all he cared about.
Cas felt himself melt.  His fear had drained away, relief washing over him and finally, his tired body relaxed enough until he felt like he could just fall asleep in the diner. “We should go back to the hotel," he murmured.
Cas bit his lip, chewing on it as he lifted his hips just a touch. He reached down and skimmed his fingers through Dean's hair. "Feels good.”
“Let’s get out of the shower and maybe I’ll do just that.” Dean grinned.
"Look, Jo was right. I would just rather go home. I'm sure they will find you a good replacement," he answered, avoiding Dean’s gaze.
He watched him walk away, his heart thundering in his ears as his gaze turned to the ceiling. There were so many thoughts running through his head at that moment. And maybe it was because he mostly only had sex while drunk or high, but that was the best he could remember having.
Cas gingerly wrapped an arm around Dean, his fingers finding a way to trace down the back of Dean’s spine. He let his fingertips linger over him, tracing mindless patterns over his skin. It was just sex? So why did he still not want to slip out the door and run?
"No touching yourself." Cas’ fingers grazed over the top of Dean’s  towel slowly. "And if you win, you can pick anything you want. I will do anything you ask," he purred out softly, leaning in to peck Dean's lips.
Sighing, he fished the €250 out of his pocket and slid it over to him. “Look, this is all I can get at the moment. It’s 10 o’clock at night and nothing’s open. I can get to a bank tomorrow, but this is what you’re gonna get for now. So start talking.”
Cas didn't know what to say. That he would feel like a burden? A fanboy? He also couldn't bear the thought of running into Meg. He sighed softly, responding reluctantly with just the address of the motel he was staying at along with the room number and where he’d hidden the key outside.
Cas managed a smile,  his heart skipping when Dean called him ‘baby.’ He hugged him back, having missed their intimacy already. The warmth of his body, his comforting smell. He leaned into it before reluctantly breaking away. "How was the party?" He asked softly.
“I fucking hate spiders, okay?” Dean shook his head, wrapping his arms around Cas’ waist. “Yes, but I’m your idiot, aren’t I?”
“Well geez. She might be the only person I’ve met with a stick farther up her ass than yours.” Dean laughed, uncovering the dishes and setting his burger on a tray on his lap. He set his beer on the nightstand and took a bite of the burger.
Cas panicked a little, wondering who had packed it. He climbed to his feet and hurried over, crouching by the bag and his heart sank. His  journal had been torn to shreds and the extra cash he had hidden was gone.
Cas growled as Dean ground his cock up against his, his length hard and pre-leaking, a pearl of cum slipping down his dick. "Lube. Condom?" Cas asked, wondering if they were as easy to access as just being on the side table. He couldn't wait to have Dean screaming under him. That would be a sound he would never forget.
"Kiss me," he said softly, turning to look at Dean properly, his eyes wide with affection and care.
She felt her hands get a little clammy, her stomach clench in guilt as she feigned innocence. "Fans are crafty, Dean, I don't know."
"Fuck, fuck-" Cas wasn’t going to last much longer if Dean kept this up, so he would need a distraction. He reluctantly pulled off Dean, standing up to grab condoms and lube. "On your stomach. Ass up," He instructed as he rolled the condom on, lubing up one of his fingers. It was a process for Cas. A rhythm. Although slightly more exciting, he hadn't ever known any other way. This was what happened when you were 23, no past boyfriends to speak of and only drunk Grindr dates between work since coming out at 21.
He licked the excess cum from his thumb and stood up, obedient to Dean without hesitation. "What?" He asked, voice breathy.
"Ugh, don't flatter yourself,” He muttered, finishing off his food a little while after Dean, before settling on the bed next to him.
“Good.” Dean picked himself off the couch and decided to look around at all the amenities. “Oh, shit. This place has a mini bar! Come on. This is awesome.”
Cas sat up, fumbling a little as he slipped his shirt off and tossed it aside. He immediately grabbed Dean's shirt, pulling it off and meeting his lips again.
“They’re like, parodies of classic horror movies. Really dumb, and fucking hilarious. And they’re not actually scary if you’re not into horror. In my opinion, it’s better to watch them high, but I didn’t bring anything this trip.”
Cas landed on the couch with a soft
Cas dropped them in the trash can as he walked past. Well, at least he used protection. "Tell me." Cas had a slight smirk on his face. Hell, he was getting a slight kick out of this.
"Of course Dean, anything," she replied with a soft smile, letting out a pleased sigh of contentment.
When Dean finished his little spiel, it took a second for the gears turning over in Cas' head to click and he suddenly felt his blood run cold. Was Dean suggesting...? Surely not. "So, do you want to go to a bar, or....?" Cas took another sip of his beer, eyes on the TV. He swallowed, feeling his heart race a little. This was stupid. Dean was just another guy.
Everything I’ve ever let go of has claw marks on it.
Deanna tromps up the stairs, changing into clothes fit for sleep before flopping back onto the bed. As soon as her head hits the pillow, she’s reminded of the fact that Castiel had been the mattress’ last occupant. She sighs, then flips over onto her stomach.
before heading up to bed.
“Cas wouldn’t
She jolts, right hand automatically going to the knife in her boot before she realizes just who has appeared next to her on Bobby’s back porch. She sighs, something she feels she’s done more in this one seven day stretch than her entire life before, and says, “Cas. Remembered us ‘mud monkeys’, finally?”
“Who?” Castiel asks plainly.
Reaching the two angels, Deanna says, “No time like the present,” and flicks open the lighter she’d been gripping in nerveless fingers, sparking it, before dropping it into the circle of holy oil Castiel had laid down earlier. A ring of flames encircles Balthazar, who turns to face the hunter with narrowed eyes flashing.
Deanna wracks her brain, and the first thing that comes to mind is—
“What you said… about how you would take the pain and the guilt over Paradise. At the time, I disobeyed my orders because I could see, within your very soul, that you believed that.” He pauses, hesitating, before continuing, “I didn’t fully understand, then, human emotions. But the more I got to know you, know Sam… the more I realized why you’d fought so viciously against Heaven’s plan, the more I understood. We fought against Heaven, and destiny, because of the love you had for your brother.”
Then, a voice from behind them: “Leave my dad alone!”
“You good, Deanna?” She looks up.
Dean cuts off that train of thought real quick.
and tried not to think of what kind of twisted metaphor they were living, not until they
Castiel shakes his head. “I didn't remember until I took Jimmy as my vessel.”
“Cas.”
All others from his garrison seem unlikely: even Rachel, his former lieutenant, was far too trusting in the plan Heaven laid out for them until seeing the alternative. Castiel stares hopelessly down at the Fairy Meadows, his ability to see the grassland aided by his celestial sight, before he’s struck with an idea.
Cas self-consciously wiped his mouth with his thumb to make sure there was nothing left, grazing his fingers through his hair. He put on his professional stature once again and followed Dean from the Ferris wheel. He glanced around, doing his usual checks for security threats.
Dean cleared his throat. “I can’t sleep. Dunno what’s going on, but I’m feeling kinda paranoid here. Would you mind staying at least until I fall asleep?”
“I didn’t mean to call you,” Dean said quickly before Cas could change his mind and hang up on him.  “My phone dropped on the floor while she was here and it must’ve dialed the number I called last. I’m not that much of an asshole.” He sighed. “And for the record, she works at the hotel, and is only like two years younger than me. Doesn’t matter. Can you just...come back here? I’m pretty sure I pissed her off and she’s a little whacko, so I don’t feel super safe in here alone.”
Cas stayed close to the window as Dean fell out of it. He helped dust Dean off. "After this, you are going to wish you were. Fifth is only about two blocks away. We can either split up or go together, whatever seems less conspicuous."
Cas hummed a little, brushing one hand through his hair as he watched Dean traipse back to the bar for some more alcohol. "I'm not carrying you back to the hotel."
Castiel gingerly moved from his post, carefully taking a seat on the edge of Dean's bed. "You can just call me Cas."
Cas leaned into Dean, not caring about the fact they smelled of sex, sweat and booze. He didn't care that they had morning breath or were exhausted. He pulled him closer, arms around his neck as he kissed him lazily.
“Funny. That’s kinda how I feel about you,” Dean replied without thinking, taking another bite of his burger. “Don’t know what you’re talking about, though. I’m just eating...” he saw Cas put fries in his burger and immediately copied him. It was a smart idea.
Cas pulled back and made his way to the bed, settling against the headboard and among the pillows. He sat with one leg hanging casually off the bed, the other propped up as he eyed Dean. He started off slowly, his right hand pushing through his wet hair as his left dropped to caress and massage one of his nipples slowly.
Cas slid his hands around to squeeze Dean’s ass. "All done.” he moved forward to nudge Dean’s chin with his nose. "Can you do me?” He asked softly.
"Alright,” he finally complied.
Cas smirked, taking his time as he leaned back against the tiles and let out a pleased sigh. His favourite pastime was most definitely giving Dean a shower show.
“Cas...” The soft moan fell from his lips and he couldn’t stop himself. He tilted his head back, wrapping his legs around Cas’ waist and pulling him closer. “Fuck,” he breathed, all the tension from the evening culminating into this moment.
“Fine, Cas. So, are we gonna talk about last night or what?” Dean sighed. “I’m guessing that was a one off thing? You don’t wanna do it again?”
She shook a little in excitement, her fingers grazing down his chest as she shamelessly pushed her hips down to grind against him.
“Sometimes I question whether you’re actually a person, or you’re some kinda robot with programmed responses that get switched on when you’re pissed. Come here. Sit. Talk to me like a normal human being. I promise the wall isn’t gonna attack me.”
“Mm.” Dean scooted closer to him, unzipping his black pants and tugging them down. “Look how hard you are,” he teased, brushing against him again with his palm through his underwear. “That for me?”
"Mm, but I am an asshole, Dean." He caught the pillow, the smile still evident on his lips. "You don't look old. She just- she's an idiot," He murmured, ignoring the Lisa comment. It hurt, even though it shouldn't. He shouldn't care who Dean fucked, but he did care. Just a little bit. He would have to get some headphones for the flight.
Cas was appreciative, moving closer as the elevator closed. He knew no one would be around anyway; it was just dragging up to 4am. He leaned closer and pressed a soft kiss to Dean’s lips.
"It's fine." He glanced up at Dean. "I thought I would give you the heads up; my days off are Wednesdays. So you will have another guard that day." He informed, leaning back on his palms.
“Yeah, nothing screams ‘family friendly’ like a murder suicide.” Dean shook his head. “But it’d make quite the headline.”
“Uh huh.” Dean let out a yawn. “You’re still gonna be here when I wake up, right?” He asked, that fear still present in his mind as he curled closer to Cas, comfortable despite the quality of the end.
“Yeah. Is it safe to use the shower here, though?” Dean asked as he sat up, half-joking. He yawned, running his fingers through his hair as he reluctantly climbed out of bed and offered Cas his hand.
"Oh! Uh, sure." She nodded, shifting a little as she wandered over and gingerly took a seat on the edge of his bed. "Uh, here?" She asked.
“Uh...nope. You can just...Uh...throw those away...” Dean winced.
He headed upstairs, dressed in his usual all black attire and signature I-don't-give-a-fuck hair. He entered the suite, peering around. "Dean?" He called out, making his way through the rooms until he found Dean in the tub. "Hm. I was expecting to see you passed out in a pool of your own vomit," he commented with ease to hide his relief that that wasn't the case.
“Time for my favorite part.” He crawled down between his legs, holding the container beneath Cas’ cock and dipping it directly into the mousse with a small smirk. He set it aside after Cas was completely submerged and ran his tongue along the underside before it dripped onto the sheets.
"Mm...." Cas hollowed his cheeks, running his tongue along the underside of Dean's thick cock as he worked him slowly. He loved Dean saying his name like that; it was gorgeous.
It was unexpected and Cas choked a little, but was inevitably pleased with himself, pulling off as Dean’s cock softened between his lips. "Mm, seemingly so. Didn't realise how sensitive your nipples are." He smirked a little like a kid with a new toy.
Cas wasn't expecting Dean to say it back; he just needed to voice his feelings. He leaned into the kiss, slow and warm. He smiled a little as Dean pulled back, nudging his chin with his nose as he snuggled down into him. He pressed a soft kiss to his neck, their bodies squishing together.
“Mm...” It wasn’t a long ride back to the hotel, but Dean wanted to make every second count since he wasn’t sure how much time he’d get with Cas once they returned.
He couldn't help but chuckle at her name. "Honestly? For god’s sake, I have to try and get a look at this girl before we leave." Cas made his way over to the minibar. "Do you mind if I have a beer?" He asked, pulling out two.  "Do you want one, or are you still fucked up from before?"
“Uh...okay. I thought we were gonna go a little slower than that. But...yeah. Sure.” He cleared his throat, thrown a little off his game by that sudden request, but determined to keep up his suave appearance. He leaned back into her, pressing his lips to her neck and trailing kisses as he slid his hands up her shirt and pulled it off.
---Meg?
“Okay. Well, I guess I don’t care where you stay as long as I can keep seeing you. But we’re leaving tomorrow night. Have you given any more thought about songwriting?” Dean brushed his fingers through his hair. “But until then, you can just be my boyfriend.” He smiled a little after he said that, liking the way it sounded.
"Well then winner, lose that towel and lift your arms for me.”  He grinned, turning to face Dean properly as he caught the cuffs and swung them between his fingers.
“I think Hell is worse,” Jack says mildly. “Unless Rowena has significantly changed the day-to-day there, being flayed doesn’t sound pleasant.”
“St. Michael Vanquishing Satan. Classic glamor shot of big bro,” says a voice from behind her. Deanna whips around and—
“When I was in search of my Father, I spent much of my time contemplating your words from the ‘Green Room.’” Another non sequitur.
“Hey, Cas.”
“Fuck, Cas, I’ve wanted this for so long, I just didn’t know—”
“Yes. Most of his body turned to blood.”
“No?”
doesn't have time to consider now—as he mindlessly grabs some snacks and energy bars and water, shoving them haphazardly them into a plastic bag. Dean doesn't bother stealing cash from the register like he did last time, but instead braces himself.
Bobby blows out the pilot of the flame thrower, and the two hunters head upstairs.
Deanna frowns. After the ruckus Castiel had caused regarding Chastity, they’d stumbled out onto the street, laughing, but she’d never made good on that promise. They hadn’t died, after all, and she’d forgotten about that night after everything that had happened; trapping an archangel in holy fire, then getting sent to a bleak future would make anyone’s memory lapse. Deanna eyes the angel next to her without turning her head; he’s looking up at the sky, face peaceful. She bites her lip.
By then, the Entity has finished reading whatever Jack thought could convince a cosmic being to spit Cas back out to Earth and is looking between Dean and Castiel with a thoughtful expression. “The kid wants me to let you go, Castiel. Says he’s God now, and he requests I let you and Dean here walk out of here alive.” The Entity pauses, before a dark smile tugs the corner of its lips up. “What he doesn’t say, though, is I have to let you go without a fight. Says I can make a deal, in fact, to make up for the small matter of you reneging on our terms, Clarence.
“It wasn’t any trouble, Dean,” Castiel replies smoothly, folding his hands on the worn wooden table. The sight of the motion draws Dean’s attention to the glass of milk sitting off-center, a straw floating inside.
energy for Jack. Kid really got his serving of Wheaties.” Cas squeezes Dean’s hand. “So, Jack has finally had enough, and goes in for the final piece of the puzzle: absorbing Chuck’s energy. He does it, thankfully. We would’ve been in deep shit if he hadn’t, huh?” Cas squeezes extra hard that time, if Dean’s not mistaken.
Bobby must hear her sharp intake of breath, for he turns and cranes his neck to look up at her. “What is it?”
