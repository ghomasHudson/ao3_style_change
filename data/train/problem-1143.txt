The GPS chip behind his shoulder blade was the biggest issue. John had spent many an hour going round in his head, how to get it out. He couldn’t reach it himself, and getting help from anyone else, be it doctor, veterinarian, or well, he couldn’t imagine anyone else with the skill, but—Sherlock would find out who had helped him, and murder that person in cold blood. John had no doubt of that. He’d seen it happen before, in their earlier days.
Suddenly, John felt the hard, bony knuckles push past the tight gate and enter him, and the sensation was terrifying and satisfying and euphoric and degrading all at the same time. His legs spasmed beyond his control, and his hips turned and twisted, unsure if they wanted to escape this horrifying invasion, or impale themselves on it in a final surrender. Sherlock took the choice from him, pushing further in, and John’s throat was as wide open as his bottom, emitting a roar of confused pleasure and pain, and not a little shock.
To his amusement, about a dozen of the workers seemed to be gathered at the open bay door of the warehouse, looking in and up at something that had caught their attention. Something far above the storage bins stacked high with recently imported goods. Something up in the lofty beams beneath the ceiling a good 60 meters above the hard cement floor.
Then he was across the room and into his coat, texting his henchmen. Time to bring his lover back home.
Now he cursed himself for putting the jacket in the same damn bin as his shirt. What if Sherlock investigated further? The shirt was meant to be discovered. The jacket was not. But John had been in such a hurry, unsure of how long Sherlock would wait to descend upon him. Not knowing how much time he had, John planted the evidence, hid the jacket, and clambered up the tree (which, incidentally, was much more difficult than he’d anticipated. Took him several tries.) Then he found himself shivering and waiting for nearly half an hour.
John continued to pretend to be oblivious. But a spot between his shoulder blades had begun to heat up. Sherlock was clearly contemplating some new “activity” for the evening’s entertainment. Something that would horrify John on the emotional level, something that would play on his nerves, batter his self-control, wrack his brain as it desperately tried to hold on to… what it was he was trying to hold on to, John never could say. It was just instinct to hold on to… something.
He stared at the mobile again, and morosely regarded the pulsing signal from the chip, now at Baker Street. Where John should be. After a moment, Sherlock disabled the signal and put the phone down again. Who had helped John remove the chip?
Sherlock paused and tightened the chains further. John’s legs were stretched wider than was comfortable, but the taunting, slick, pleasuring hands between them resumed their ministrations, and John let out a throaty groan and arched his back. He was spread too tight to squirm now, and could only thrash his head about as Sherlock’s fingers grew more aggressive and sensuously cruel—
John looked around frantically for a moment and then noticed an open semi-truck with several large drop cloths piled in it. The truck was otherwise empty. In a moment of wild desperation, John glanced around, and jumped into the container. He hopped over the cloths, lay down and tugged one over him. For once in his life, John was grateful to be on the small side.
John gaped at him from his chair. Sherlock rose, eyebrows lifted challengingly. “Best get dressed, John. The clock is already running.” With that, he swept by John to enter the loo.
Sherlock’s lips twitched in a rather nervous little smile. “You do know how to make a statement, John,” he breathed, although now, of course, John could not hear him. Sherlock pocketed his now useless mobile and looked up at John appraisingly. John let go of the joist and stood balanced on the beam, holding on to nothing.
John turned a page, his stomach heavy with incoming dread. After a moment, Sherlock lowered his phone and laid it delicately on the arm of his chair. He raised his hands to put his fingers deliberately together, and rest them under his chin. His pale eyes remained on John.
For a moment, a wave of actual dizziness swept through him. Sherlock drew his breath in and straightened, turning to scan furious, icy eyes in all directions. How much of a head start had John gotten?? And who… who had helped him? Because anyone who helped him must be wrung until every drop of information had been extracted, and then dispatched in the most ruthless way possible. Sherlock dropped the shirt into the bin and turned to march in rage to the car… but then he stopped.
It took John a moment to understand he was being given one last chance to jerk the pole left or right, throwing Sherlock off balance, and then simply letting physics take their course. He ground his teeth together, hating Sherlock Holmes with all of his heart. He was rubbing it in, that John couldn’t bring himself to make one simple move to guarantee his own safety and freedom.
“Come now, John. Suicide to escape a relationship?” Sherlock said, with an attempt at lightheartedness. But his eyes were moving around John, and the beams and girders, clearly calculating. If he let go of the joist nearest him and began walking toward John, he’d need to take ten steps with no support whatsoever to reach the next joist. And then another ten steps to the next. And then ten final ones to John, who had nowhere to go but backward, which would place him more safely over the storage bins only short distance below him. He could still be injured in a fall, depending on how he fell and what he landed on, but it wasn’t the plunge to the death that awaited anyone who fell in the center that stretched out between the two sections.
John sat for a moment longer, waiting for Sherlock to make a move or issue a directive, but the man simply sat in his chair, dressed in black, his white shirt unbuttoned at the throat.
“I’m hungry,” Sherlock suddenly stated, his voice louder and stronger than it had been all day. John grimaced that the spell was broken, but grateful that Sherlock was seeming like himself again.
He still felt weak, shaky, but John’s strong arms pulled him upright. Although he towered over John, he felt very steady leaning on him. Had he always been this strong?
If John could duplicate what Sherlock was trying to find out, he could find his kidnapper. First, he texted Lestrade.
Sherlock was confident that they were on the right track to John, but the car was not moving fast enough. On this winding country road, with nobody around, Sherlock felt no urgency from Lestrade. “Relax, Sherlock.” He had said. “John’s a smart man, he’ll be just fine, he knows how to fend for himself.” It made Sherlock’s blood boil, it was as if the Yard didn’t understand how dangerous Moriarty is.
John picked up the papers on the floor, and found that most of them were related to this case. Sherlock had been documenting various gemstone samples that had been found at the scene, and studying their chemical composition. He noticed one red stone still underneath the microscope lens. Next, he went over to the laptop and tapped on the mousepad until the screen came to life. An article about the origins of rubies was on the screen.
In a flash, Sherlock punched the nearest guard and was immediately slammed against the wall next to John, exactly where he wanted to be. It took only a second for Sherlock to pick the lock around John’s right wrist, and grab his gun from his pocket. He ignored the fearful glint in John’s eye that appeared whenever Sherlock was armed.
“I know. I was just calculating our usual angles for our preferred positions, and given the width and depth of this space, it’s physically not possible. We’ll have to save that for when we’re back home.” He said, a sultry glint in his eye.
. Sherlock, zero inhibitions, zero regard for normalcy, was blushing at the thought of kissing and touching each other in the shower? John’s expression was incredulous.
John had said I love you. Nobody had ever said that to him, not since his parents said it when he was a child. He knew he was off-putting at times, rude, and a bit of a know-it-all. He had accepted many years ago that he was destined for a life of solitude. He was fine with that, really. He wasn’t going to let anybody else into his chaotic world. He had never met anyone even remotely interesting. Frankly, the idea of spending your entire life with someone was borderline revolting. And then John came along. John broke through his walls and learned to understand him. He was a friend. Sherlock had never had one of those before. Although, after spending a lot of time with John, a thought began to creep into his Mind Palace. The idea of wanting something more than friendship with John started as a little spark, and it gradually became stronger and stronger. He had desperately tried to put out that flame. How dare he ruin the friendship he had. Friendship was fine, great really. More than he ever expected, and he accepted that. And now it turned out, all this time, John had been fighting the same feelings.
In any other circumstance, John would have laughed. Instead, he focused on the article Sherlock had been reading. It described the chemical composition of various gemstones, and how that could be used to track where they were mined from. He reviewed the chemical formulas quickly, and then turned to the first ruby under the microscope. Once he identified the chain of molecules, he turned back to the screen, and matched it up.
He stomped on one wood panel. Hollow. He jumped to the next one. Not hollow. There was a small notch on the side of the panel, just wide enough for him to fit his fingers, and it slid to the side. The opening below was small, and dark, but there was unmistakably someone there, unconscious. He shifted, and squinted into the darkness. Sherlock’s eyes focused on the unmistakable blond-gray hair and hideous jumper of John Watson.
The room spun and threatened to flip over. John’s mind flashed back to when he was kidnapped by Moriarty, only a few months ago. And now this. John’s legs shook as he tried to investigate the lab around him.
Sherlock smirked. “Not a chance, doctor. I believe you were going to buy me a slice of pizza, and I’m going to hold you to that. Come on then. I’m hungry.”
Moriarty frequently poisoned his victims, which would explain why John had made no effort to contact him. He had a flair for the dramatic, which means John was still alive, but only for so long. How much longer did he have? The car started to whine, but he paid it no mind. He ran though common poison antidotes in his head. He charted out locations to the nearest hospital as the Moriarty mansion neared. There was no one in sight, clearly he had expected Sherlock to take the bait at the jewelry heist, and leave John for dead.
“Oh no, brother.” Her wide eyes stared at him emotionlessly through the screen. “It’s an elimination round. You still have that gun with the single bullet?”
“Turn right! Here! Turn RIGHT!” John pointed at the next intersection. They were in the far left lane, and the car skidded wildly as the driver cut across several lanes of busy traffic and ran through a red light. Horns blared and pedestrians lept out of the way.
“Stop the car,” Sherlock demanded, opening the door and putting his feet on the ground before the brakes fully engaged.
“We kill Eurus. Even if we make it out of here today, she will continue to manipulate us, pose as average people in our lives, pit us against each other, destroy me from the inside until she is dead. That much is clear.”
The next day, John was blogging about their Sherrinford adventure, glancing at Sherlock more often than he usually did. It wasn’t completely unusual, as Sherlock was the main character of John’s stories, so he didn’t mind. He got to a certain point, looked up at Sherlock and turned pink. He averted his eyes, but Sherlock noticed too quickly. He immediately stood up in front of where John was working, trying to get a sneak peek of the work in progress. John slammed the laptop shut.
There was now no doubt in John’s mind this kidnapping was connected to the case. Clearly, Sherlock was approaching a breakthrough, and whoever was behind this, believed Sherlock knew too much.
Several hours later, John’s alarm clock buzzed. 8:00am. He felt moderately well rested, surprisingly. For a moment, he relished in the calm morning before he had to get ready for the long day ahead of them.
“I… I love you, Sherlock. And I only wish I had told you sooner. I don’t blame you for Mary’s death, or anything else that has happened since. I know you don’t have those kinds of feelings for other people, but it only seemed right that you know.”
Sherlock’s life. The life he had just promised to John. John! Where was John? He vaguely registered fingers intertwining with his, but he could not see them. He only saw flashes of his childhood with a young Mycroft, and those images morphed into John, swirling around each other. This was a dark corner of his Mind Palace that he was unaccustomed to. He looked up, and he could see the faint light of reality far above, as if he was at the bottom of the deepest well, with no way out.
The red warning lights began to turn on and off, the faint sound of a siren steadily growing louder.
“Oy, Graham! Get a poison control squad over to that jewelry heist. At least five victims, possibly more. They likely don’t have more than an hour or so. And get an ambulance out here asap.”
John stood up and made his way over to Sherlock. “It doesn’t need to be logical for it to be right.” He explained. John was standing much too close, his face only inches from his own. John licked his lips. “Does this feel right, Sherlock?” He asked softly.
His thoughts finally clicked into place. “Every single test that you’ve put us through so far has been a lie. You said that you’d only drown the brother who was guilty of murder, yet you dropped all three of them into the ocean. You claimed that Molly’s flat was rigged with explosives, and yet it wasn’t.” He paused, slowly turning away from John to face the screen again. “What happens if I refuse.” He spoke with a pause between each word, over enunciating every syllable.
They sat in the water holding each other until their fingers pruned. John was fairly certain Sherlock had fallen asleep, but he didn’t mind. He was floating in a world where time and space didn’t matter as long as they had each other. He let the feeling of peace wash over him.
John was restless, frequently waking to the sound of whatever Sherlock was up to below. Lab equipment was whirring, Sherlock cursed loudly whenever he got unexpected results from whatever he was testing. Once, John thought he heard breaking glass. He buried his face under the pillow and tried to block out the noise.
The van had been a newer model, black, new tires. Ideal for offroading. John was likely being taken outside of the main city. The van was dirty, the reddish brown dirt was reminiscent of a type of clay. Frequently used on certain dirt roads. He made a left turn in his Palace, towards the room filled with maps. He sorted them by type of road. The van was heading east, at a high rate of speed. Not likely to make any sharp turns any time soon. He narrowed the list of roads further.
The lab was destroyed. Equipment was shattered, a window was broken, the usually neatly stacked papers were scattered on the floor. Clearly there had been a struggle. Sherlock was nowhere to be seen.
He relayed what he had found so far to Lestrade. He responded with a list of abandoned warehouses that could be used to hide stolen goods, and asked John to cross reference them against the suspect’s name. John did so, but initially found nothing. He then turned to airport security footage, and was able to locate him disembarking the plane. He pulled security footage from various cameras as he tracked his path through the airport all the way to the car rental agency.
Sherlock felt around in his jacket pocket for it, hands shaking slightly. He locked eyes with John, trying to quickly formulate a plan and communicate it telepathically to him.
And now Moriarty knew the truth between them. He could mess with Sherlock’s mind and play games with him all he wanted, and Sherlock would always come out on top, but this had crossed a line. He reached into his pocket for a pack of cigarettes. He had gotten so much better about quitting smoking. John hated it, and he would do anything to make John happy. When things were going well, he rarely felt the cravings anymore, but when things were bad, his Mind Palace didn’t function properly without it. And now, things were very very bad. His phone buzzed.
”Can’t you ... hnngh ... can’t you deduce it?” John opened his mouth and sucked Sherlock’s fingers into that warm dampness. Sherlock’s eyes grew wide and his cheeks flushed impossibly darker. He quickly averted his eyes, but he let his fingers stay in John’s mouth, where the blogger happily nipped and sucked at them.
John’s mood swings were dizzying. Where he had looked so sad and frustrated only a minute ago, he now beamed at Sherlock with the brightness of a thousand light bulbs.
Having made his decision, Sherlock took his final step forward and turned around to face John properly. What he saw there stopped him dead in his tracks. John’s appearance hadn’t very much changed, he hadn’t grown one bit, his posture still screamed military, he did groom himself better now, but his eyes still held the same navy blue beauty in them and his tan had only paled a little bit. What had changed rather noticeably was John’s mouth. Well not his mouth per se, but what was around his mouth or rather above. Sitting on that soft upper lip was now a crown of coarse blonde hair. John had a mustache. What the hell?
John couldn‘t leave now! If he left like this he might never come back! Sherlock couldn‘t let that happen!
The man twitched a bit at that, but his cheeks were now rather taking on the colour of a ripe peach.
«Right, well. I think it might be best for us all if I just moved out. Of course I will still help you whenever you need me on a case and we’ll always be friends! It’s just not ... not ...»
“Okay I reckon this must be a bit much to take in right now and you are probably confused. I will explain everything once we’re back at Baker Street and can have a proper chat, but for now the most important thing is“ Sherlock glanced at the floor, then took a deep breath. He fixed his eyes on John’s once again and continued:
He also knew Sherlock wouldn’t bother answering that question, since it was so obvious, even John was able to deduce from the state of his clothes and the slight tremor in his hands, that Sherlock hadn‘t slept.
and that seemed to do it. John deepened the kiss and Sherlock all but lost himself in it. When their tongues met they both moaned. Sherlock would have been embarrassed with the noises he made, but he was way to absorbed in the feeling of John. John's lips that were nibbling and biting on Sherlock's lips, John's hands that were drawing Sherlock impossibly closer and John's body pressing unyieldingly into Sherlock.
Mycroft had tried calling him that very day and a couple of times after that, but Sherlock had just turned off his phone. He didn‘t want to deal with his Brother and the "I told you so's" that would undoubtedly make an appearance in their conversation. Sherlock wasn‘t ready for that. He also wasn‘t ready for the pity that Mrs Hudson or Lestrade would try to hide, but nevertheless regard him with. They would probably go out their way to be overly careful with him, so if not to remind him of his broken heart and the person responsible for it.
"Yeah, Yes of course!“, John grinned. He stepped closer and drew him into his arms again. At the first contact
That was okay though, because John could tell himself that Sherlock just didn’t feel things, the way normal people did. He wasn’t able to feel love. Or maybe he was, but he chose not to.
“Oh, your instincts to hide and protect are still quite dominant. You need to trust me for this to work, John! Ignore your instincts. Close your eyes and let me guide you!“
"I said, could-you-just-keep-holding-me-please!“ He sounded annoyed and a bit irritated, as if John was being deliberately obtuse.
a blabbermouth. That was simply a fact, nothing personal and therefore insulting about it. So there shouldn't have been a problem, right? Wrong! Because John seemed so angry now, that the tremor in his right hand had appeared and he was clenching and unclenching it repeatedly while trying to even out is breath.
John drew slow, circular motions on Sherlock’s back, making comforting noises and waiting for Sherlock’s breaths to come even.
Sherlock drew in a harsh breath, before fully laying down on John, using his whole weight to bodily pin him to the bed. John gave out an embarrassing whine at the restraint.
In four long strides he crossed the distance between the entrance and John’s table and was just about to call out what would have probably been quite a terrible line to inform his friend he was not dead, when he noticed that John, in fact, was not alone. Sherlock knew that of course, since he wasn’t stupid enough to assume John would come to such a fancy place alone. Also Sherlock’s assumption had been confirmed by the Maitre d’s comment about a Reservation for two.
Sherlock turned away from the window and took one last look around the room. He didn’t have any belongings he needed to pack before he left. Only the three piece suit he was already wearing and his Belstaff. Ahh it felt good to finally put it back on. He felt more like himself whenever he wore it. That coat had become a part of him somehow and he was acutely aware of its absence, whenever he could not wear it. It was kind of like his own battle uniform, it seemed to boost his confidence kind of. And well, it worked extraordinarily for dramatic effect.
“I already have“ came the reply. Sherlock’s voice was all but a whisper now and he didn’t dare look into the older man‘s eyes. He was too afraid of what he might find in them.
John had dreamed about this, - not the tying up and being totally caught of guard bit, mind - but he did have fantasies where Sherlock had studied every bit of his body so intensely that John might have just burst under the pressure.
So Sherlock had to make a decision here. He could still leave, John would never know he was actually alive and he would have a shot at a normal, domestic life with this mystery woman he clearly liked a lot. Or Sherlock could take the last step, finally reunite with John and they will continue their life at Baker Street as if nothing had happened. It wasn’t a tough decision to make. Sure, Sherlock would do everything to make John happy, even if it meant leaving him forever, but Sherlock just knew that he was the only one who could not only make John happy, but also make him feel every emotion there was. Let him experience a full life and give him everything he needed. After all, Sherlock was the one who knew John the best. Again, the limp proved that.
At the 8 second mark, John heaved a sigh, closed the book, put it aside, and tipped his head in the opposite direction to return Sherlock’s gaze.
John put his elbows on the table. “I don’t see why some of your henchmen couldn’t do it,” he said grumpily. “It’s not that hard to pick out the right jam, and there’s nothing else we need.”
Sherlock breathed deep. His eyes fastened on the pulsing signal, and warmth flooded through him as he contemplated its progress. His muscles relaxed, and only then did he realize how stiff they had been. Truly, he was a mess without his defiant little soldier. “John,” he murmured to the screen of his mobile, “When I get you back, I will weave such a web for you, you’ll never leave my side again.”
John never wanted to give Sherlock the satisfaction of knowing that the message had been received, and the dread had begun to build. Not John. There was still enough of the soldier left in him that he’d direct his eyes back down with a sudden dogged concentration to stare at the book in his hands. Sherlock would watch in silent delight as John gritted his teeth and tried to focus on the pages of his novel.
And why keep the razor? Or, why keep it till it was time to dispose of the chip? And why dispose of the shirt? Why not wash the blood out of it in the sink… John had only 3 shirts with him, why sacrifice one?
His appearance did not seem to startle the henchmen, as he called him, who routinely loitered in a parked car near the door of 221B in case Sherlock was ever in need of assistance in subduing, say, a recalcitrant lover. They looked as if they’d expected to see him come dashing out in a panic and head toward the Tesco. John didn’t look back to see if they were watching him round the corner, and he didn’t bother to see if they saw him suddenly change direction and head for the nearest Tube station.
“Is tonight the night, then?” He asked unconcernedly, though his entire body was growing as tense as his neck. “I don’t have to worry about retirement anymore?”
When he returned to the emptiness of Baker Street, Sherlock’s chest was burning with rejection and chagrin, and his eyes were hot with the promise of retribution.
Sherlock snapped out of his memory to see that they had pulled up to a warehouse near the docks. Of course. It’s always a warehouse. Twitching the coat over his groin to hide the evidence of his wandering thoughts, Sherlock exited the vehicle and strode toward the warehouse doors, checking his mobile as he came. Then he looked up.
Pleasure tingled down John’s legs as Sherlock worked in his third finger, and gradually built up again to this hard, demanding entrance, followed by the gentle withdrawal. In hard… out slowly. In hard, a firm, thrusting shove that sent chills up his spine… and out gradually. In again, full and stretching, hard and unyielding… John was panting with debased rapture, and Sherlock kept up the slow pace for another minute. Now his moans escaped him without much effort, as Sherlock’s fingers fucked him hard from behind. He didn’t need to see the pale eyes, their riveted gaze, the parted lips… John knew what Sherlock looked like when he was utterly dominating him.
“Sherlock!“, John rasped. He suddenly felt quite exposed and hoped the dark lighting would hide his embarrassement.
Sherlock smiled to himself and closed the door to the room that had functioned as his hiding place for the last few weeks, when he still had to recover from his so called "excursion" to the east.
"May I?", John motioned towards the sitting room. Sherlock hadn't realized that the both of them had still been standing in the entryway to
Of course John would never be satisfied with this so-called substitute, but he started to think Sherlock was really there. Somewhere in this stone, hidden to eyes that see, but do not observe.
The stranger gave no indication of having heard him, so John carefully put his hand on the man’s arm and tugged softly. That seemed to do the trick because the man suddenly surged forward, throwing himself into John and clinging onto him tightly. He was still trembling a lot, but John couldn’t help thinking that he was a bit grateful for the stranger’s fear. He allowed himself to hug back and whisper little "shhh“'s and "it’s okay, I’ve got you!“’s into his ear.
Sherlock was waiting now. With every second John felt himself feeling stranger and frankly more irritated by the whole situation! Why had Sherlock bound him to his bed, to then strip him of his shirt and pants and wait for him to wake up? What was he hoping to accomplish? Certainly not the fury John currently felt at being strapped and watched in his most vulnerable state. It couldn’t be that Sherlock was actually attracted to him, could it? But all the signs were there. Sherlock watched John with every fiber of his being, taking all of it in. His pupils were visibly dialated and his breathing was slightly ragged.
With the lights back on he was finally able to see the other's face, and what he saw astonished him.
He was not sad for one bit that he would now leave this place where he had spent his whole childhood. The place he had once called home. When he still naively thought home was a place. He knew better now. Home was where his heart was. And his heart belonged to John. He would see John again. And he would finally go home.
”John!” Sherlock was right above him now, his face inches from John’s. John arched his back before Sherlock could move away, and
is watching him and that same someone is probably responsible for having tied him to his bed. Naked none the less.
He made his way slowly over to the side once, careful as to not tread too heavily for fear of making the elevator drop.
“I did meet with her John, but it was different than you think. She had started texting me after you got married. At first I ignored her, as I had always done. But I was so lonely John. Every one around me seemed to have some one and I, well I used to have you, but ...“
So yes, Sherlock had expected someone to occupy the seat opposite John. Probably some dull girlfriend who John would bed a couple of times and then grow bored of. But no, the woman sitting opposite John was clearly someone else. Because, as much as he hated to admit, John’s date was decidedly not dull. John had met her at the clinic, she was one of the nurses working there, this much was obvious. So she was used to receiving orders from John. Her body language showed though, that she wore the pants in their relationship. Quite telling about John actually, he had always been the submissive to Sherlock in their friendship as well.
Their kiss turned into something feverishly hot and they were both panting desperately into each other’s mouths by the end of it.
Sherlock stepped further away from John and then turned his back. He spoke slow and surprisingly even when he said: «I understand that this is not what you want. I was never going to tell you! I hoped we could simply remain friends, but I understand if you do not feel comfortable to be near me anymore. You can go. I won’t try to stop you!»
John took a deep breath and cleared his throat. He opened his mouth, closed it again, opened it. “Come on Watson, you‘re a soldier. You invaded Afghanistan. You can do this! How hard can it be? He won‘t hear you anyway.“
Squinting into the sunlight, they could see Mycroft aboard the boat that they had arrived on. He had been waiting for them the entire time.
“John,” Sherlock breathed, hardly able to trust his own ears. “You don’t know how long I’ve been waiting...” He trailed off.
“Yes, you idiot. A little help? I’m trying to get you out of here.” John pretended to be angry, but in reality his heart soared. Sherlock was okay. All of his fears were unfounded. He could definitely use a shower and a good night’s sleep, but by tomorrow everything would be back to normal.
John was speechless. “Anyway,” Mycroft continued. “I cleared you of the murder charges. Here’s the modified police report. You’re welcome.”
John got into the tub first, and Sherlock leaned back against his chest so that John could shampoo his unruly curls. Sherlock hummed softly in affirmation.
The door banged open, and there he stood, curls bouncing every which way, and coattails flailing behind him. He had forgone the scarf for once, as it was unseasonably warm.
Greg tried to usher her out of the room. “Trust me, you’re better off not finishing that question. Give us a moment, would you?”
A section of the ceiling pulled to the side, revealing a hidden compartment with a large bomb above them. “If you refuse, all three of you die. Make your choice, and it will only be one.”
“Wrong again, John. Security only thinks they took your gun.” He reached into the inner pocket of his Belstaff coat where he had stashed it away.
“Because you don’t want to mess with me. I strongly suggest you let him go.” John spoke in what Sherlock liked to call his Captain Voice. It was a dark, delicious tone that Sherlock could never say no to. Unfortunately, it did not seem to have the same effect on his captor. Time to take on another approach.
With John still putting most of his weight around Sherlock’s shoulders, he disconnected his heart rate monitor and other devices, and pulled him towards the bathroom.
That likely meant that John didn’t have much longer unless he located him fast. Fast acting poisons and the heist were likely more connected than he realized. He couldn’t save everyone. That was always the point, but he had made his choice.
“Erm, I suppose that would be Sherlock Holmes. He should be here soon, I’m sorry he’s not here already, he’s a bit of a nutter.” He tried to explain.
“I had deduced for years that you had feelings for me. Over the past few months, those deductions became stronger, as if you were less careful about trying to hide your feelings from me.” He put his hands together as he often did when he was deep in thought.
“Right, right,” Sherlock agreed, without really meaning it. At that moment, John’s hand slipped out of his, when a nearby food vendor caught his attention. Sherlock smiled at him, a slice of pizza did sound good after all. He turned away from John to lean against the railing beside the river. The peacefulness of the water was one of the few things that helped him shut the door to his Mind Palace when he needed to. In the bustle of London, it was often difficult for him to find that calm feeling.
Behind him, he heard a soft, “Jesus, Sherlock.” John could pretend to be irritated all he wanted. Sherlock had deduced long ago that John secretly loved his antics. And if it’s antics that John wanted, Sherlock would gladly deliver.
He was back in the basement of Moriarty’s mansion, alone and disoriented. He could hear Sherlock calling out for him, but he was too weak to respond. “Help.” He tried to cry out, but it was barely a whisper. He wanted nothing more than to be in Sherlock’s arms, and for him to tell him everything would be alright. His soothing baritone washed over him, muttering words of affection that only John would ever hear. Hell would freeze over before Sherlock would let anyone else see his tender side.
Sherlock stirred for the first time, unlacing his fingers and turning to face John. “See something you like, doctor?” He stared at him intensely, then cocked his head slightly. “Why are you awake, it’s the middle of the night?”
Sherlock barked a laugh. “Hah! Not even for a second. I would have let all three of us go up before I would ever even consider that. Don’t be ridiculous.” He feigned indifference, but their earlier confessions still hung heavy in the air.
“Sherlock! Wake up, wake up,” John’s voice floated into his ears. “I know you’re alive, please wake up.”
Greg cracked a smile. “Yeah, the two of them are something else, that’s for sure. He should be here any minute, but before he arrives, let me just warn you about Sherlock. Don’t take anything he says too seriously. He means no harm, but he’s been through a lot today, and he can be… eccentric.”
The computer pinged loudly, breaking John out of his reverie. He was shaking from the memory, and the sudden absence of Sherlock’s touch. He tried to steady himself as the words swam across the screen. Maybe Sherlock had already gotten himself out of whatever situation he was in. He could be on his way back to Baker Street right now. He would be fine, John tried to reassure himself.
There was a sound barreling down the hallway, someone sprinting down the corridor, dodging stretchers and doctors and patients without a second thought. “That’ll be him.”
[JW]: Whoever is behind those murders just kidnapped Sherlock. No idea where he is, but I have to look through his lab for clues. Please start a manhunt.
“Oh no. We really shouldn’t.” John protested. Sherlock closed the bathroom door behind him and untied John’s hospital gown, letting it fall to the floor. Lovely. He turned the shower on, and gently shoved John under the hot water, while he rushed to undress himself.
He paused his monologue for seven seconds to text Mycroft what footage to pull, offering no context for the demand. He let Lestrade drive in silence for a few moments until they reached an intersection covered with tire treads.
John felt confident that he had everything he could glean from the scene at the lab, so he hurried out the door to hail a cab to the first warehouse on his list. He shouted the address at the cabbie, and threw a wad of cash through the partition. “Hurry!”
He pressed a kiss to Sherlock’s temple. “Mine,” he whispered. John held onto him tightly as the detective’s feet dragged behind them. He vowed to never let go.
“Hmm. Can do, I suppose.” With that, Sherlock took off his coat with a flourish, and toed off his shoes. He eyed the bed, it was a bit small, but no matter. He leaned down and shoved John to one side, and wriggled into the bed beside him.
Now that there was no doubt in Sherlock’s mind about what was going on here, he just had to force all of the pieces together. Cigarette between his lips, he flicked the lighter. On queue, Lestrade’s police car pulled up beside Sherlock and he jumped in without a second thought.
John’s heart pounded in time with Sherlock’s name ringing in his mind. He would make whoever took Sherlock from him pay. His military training kicked in. He was light on his feet, flitting behind storage units and boxes, making his way through a labyrinth of shipping containers looking for any sign of movement. The warehouse was bigger than he anticipated.
“My dear doctor, I’m very glad you did.” Sherlock stared into the depths of John’s eyes, taking in every detail of John’s reaction.
John nodded approvingly. “Don’t slow down now.” The driver seemed to be enjoying this now, weaving in and out of lanes, with a wild look of glee on his face. The race was going well for a few short moments, until sirens blared behind them. He began to panic and instinctively started to slow down and pull over.
Sherlock seemed to ponder this for a moment, probably lost in his Mind Palace. John seemed genuinely frightened for the first time.
Some time later, the water began to run cold. John reluctantly untangled himself from Sherlock’s arms and shut off the water. Once they were cleaned and dressed, Sherlock grabbed his coat and began to head towards the door.
“Locked away in her cell. Luckily, with her little stunt, I think some of the guards snapped out of their reverie. She’s not going anywhere for a long time.”
Lestrade stifled a laugh in an attempt to remain professional. “I know that, but I meant what happened regarding the case? Your kidnapper? You had information regarding the smuggling? What else happened in there?” he pressed further.
He remembered that he had been holding the key in the lock to the Mind Palace, so he quickly let the key fall, and forced the doors wide open. He needed every resource at his disposal. First, he reminded himself not to play the hero. Of course, he could solve this on his own, but he took no chances when he came to John. He pulled out his phone.
Greg knew better to question Sherlock, or bother to correct his name in a time like this, and he did as he was told. Sherlock sprinted up the mansion.
Sherlock whipped around to see John in handcuffs, pressed up against the wall by the officer reading his rights.
Sherlock, grinning ear to ear, silently pulled John into an empty room, and shut the door. Once he was sure they were alone, he spoke.
“Get in the tub, you nutter,” he said good naturedly. “There will be time for that later once you’re cleaned up and sober.”
The driver looked hesitant, and John quickly handed him a few more large bills. “Go. Now.” He ordered in a tone that offered no room for argument.
Guards out in the hallway immediately started running and shouting. “SECURITY BREACH! Code red, code red, priority inmate!”
He never came to bed last night. He was going to be insufferable at the crime scene today. John considered making a pot of coffee and then going to find Sherlock, but then he debated if caffeinated Sherlock was worse than tired Sherlock. It was a draw.
“And then what? They took my gun at security when we arrived, you used the only bullet in Eurus’ gun. We’re going to need weapons.”
“Nonsense, you’re fine. They’re just keeping you overnight for observation.” After all this time together, Sherlock still struggled with the romantic stuff with John. He never knew how to express his feelings for John with words, even though often enough it was evident in his actions.
“Would you relax, please, love?” John muttered. “We just wrapped a case yesterday, it’ll likely be a little while until we hear from Lestrade again. Try to see the good in the world around you.”
The lab beneath him was quiet. Too quiet. It was very unlike Sherlock to fall asleep down there. Had he left already? John dashed to the entryway, to find Sherlock’s coat still hanging by the door. John’s heart thudded, something was off. He turned toward the lab door to run down the stairs to find -
Sherlock steepled his fingers together to hypothesize Mycroft’s next move. They were going to need to be on the same page if they had any chance of making it out alive. The cement block walls of the institution blocked out any cell signal, so they were on their own until they could be reunited.
“It just happened to be the closest room to where we were standing, I assumed.” John walked around the small room, ran his hands along the plain cement brick walls. No hidden doorways, no secret cameras, no panels in the ceiling. He finished his lap around the room, when his foot hit a section of the floor that made a more hollow sound, as if there were an opening beneath. He stepped again, confirming his hypothesis.
But right now, his Sherlock was in trouble. John fought to clear his mind and analyze the scene the way Sherlock would.
“Sherlock, what I said the other day, it just spilled out. I thought I was about to die. I wouldn’t have otherwise-”
This man was so different from the stoic, unfeeling detective that most of the world knew. This Sherlock was for John, and John alone. He could revel in that fact forever.
They followed her directions through the maze of Sherrinford. As they approached their destination, there was suddenly a scuffle just outside the door.
After a few minutes of sneaking around, he began to hear a muffled voice. He held his breath as he moved closer.
“Good,” Eurus continued. “You have the choice to kill either Mycroft or John. Your choice!” She said cheerily. “Once one of them is dead, you can move on.”
“Stop the car,” Sherlock said. His voice was quiet, but deadly. When the car rolled to a stop on the shoulder, Sherlock all but pulled Greg out of the drivers’ seat, and threw him in the back. He floored the gas pedal before Lestrade had shut the back door. He watched the odometer and tachometer needles soar to the right. He knew where he was going, although he had never been there before. He put his Mind Palace in the drivers’ seat so he could concentrate on the work.
John would have really appreciated Sherlock’s help now. John knew he had no trouble getting himself out of handcuffs and other bindings when he was sober, but he had no clue what state of mind Sherlock was in. He’d have to handle this adversary on his own.
“That I can do.” And he started staring at John with such an intensity as he slowly came to. He barely registered Greg disappearing from the small room. He held John’s hand and whispered sweet nothings in his ear for as long as it took.
“Sherloooock,” Eurus’ voice cried out mockingly. “Only a few seconds left!” Sherlock turned away from John and tried to clear his head.
The ride back to Baker Street was uneventful. John let Sherlock lay across his lap in the back seat while the driver yammered on about the events of the day. John tried to be understanding that things like this rarely happen to ordinary people, but he was in no mood to relive it. He gave terse one word responses to the driver’s comments, focusing most of his attention on carding his fingers through Sherlock’s hair soothingly.
Sherlock sighed dramatically. What he had figured out only seconds ago should have been obvious to John by now. Did he really have to spell out everything for him? “Mycroft mentioned to me a few months back that he had a close call on one of his jobs, and had since taken to frequently wearing a bullet proof vest whenever he thought the situation called for it. I, foolishly, did not expect that to be the case today, to visit our own sister. However, he must have known of the game she had set up for us today. How else would he have known to stage all of the fake blood? Clearly, had I chosen to shoot you, that would have been catastrophic.”
John winced, reluctant to show Sherlock the bloody aftermath of his own actions, but it would have been wrong to say no.
“Stephanie, is it?” She nodded, surprised. “Your husband is going to figure out that you’re cheating on him soon. It would be better if you come clean to him before he finds out. It’s honestly impressive you’ve hidden it for this long.”
As the car rolled to a stop, John flung the door open to face the police cars that had been chasing them. “I’m with the Yard!” He shouted. He pointed towards Lestrade’s team. “One of you, handle this.” He demanded. “Get out of my way.”
He pressed his forehead against John’s, and squeezed his eyes shut, dreading the moment that comes next while his heart simultaneously burst with joy at the prospect of his future with John.
The wail of the sirens and the demands from the cop car to stop the vehicle were difficult to ignore, but the pull of Sherlock in that warehouse was stronger.
“JOHN!” He looked around frantically. He heard a scuffle to his left. Two men were dragging John into an oversized van. He appeared to be unconscious, with one of the men holding a cloth over his mouth. Sherlock ran toward the van, but he knew he wouldn’t make it before they slammed the door shut.
“Sherlock, Mycroft is right, but before you kill me, may I say one thing?” John spoke softly, as if accepting his fate.
When the guards started to approach Sherlock, in an attempt to peacefully disarm him, he outwitted them again. He ducked when they tried to tackle him, and easily dodged when weapons were raised. John was fighting his own battle, handcuffs swinging from his left wrist. Sherlock waited for the perfect break in the action to grab John’s arm and attached the other to his own wrist. He held John against his chest, taking only a short second to relish how good it felt to hold him close. With the gun pressed to John’s temple, he issued his ultimatum.
Sherlock gave one small nod while John kicked the door aside and fell through. He focused on John’s instructions. Do not watch. Easy enough. He pulled the trap door shut.
John feigned to his left to catch him with the right hook, causing him to stumble only for a moment, but it gave John a chance to get the upper hand. He knocked the man to the ground where they wrestled for several minutes until John managed to get both of his hands pinned behind his back.
Gunshots rang out below, forcing Sherlock out of his reverie. It would be foolish to mourn for Eurus. They had only met today, and she tried to ruin his life. These idiotic emotions were going to ruin him.
Sherlock interjected, grabbing the folder from him. “John is most appreciative, I assure you, but really, we are busy. In the future, you ought to call before coming over unannounced.” His voice slick with innuendo, making no effort to conceal his intentions. John’s heart pounded wildly at his words.
“When I saved you from Moriarty-” he began, barely holding back the giggles. This was so unlike Sherlock. What had Minato given him? “We showered in that tiny hospital shower. And then we-” Sherlock was
“John was taken at 1:16pm from the east side of the pier, near the food vendors. The van is a 2012 black Ford Transit with all-season tires. They are heading west towards the countryside. They’ll be going to one of the villages with the clay dirt roads. Moriarty is behind this. He thinks he can destroy me by taking John away, I’ll show him I’m perfectly capable on my own. The kidnappers were tall, caucasian, light hair, athletic build. Possibly brothers.” He pulled a long drag. “Made no effort to conceal themselves in broad daylight. Obviously are confident that they’ll get away with it, or that Moriarty will protect them. Can we pull surveillance footage from the area? Never mind, I’ll get Mycroft to do it, he’s faster than you lot.”
“You and Sherlock, of course! Can’t tell you how long I’ve waited for this, it’s ridiculous. Years, really. What have you been doing all this time?” Mycroft rolled his eyes.
“My God, Sherlock, really? You’re going to let this idiot sway your decision?” Mycroft egged him on. Sherlock knew that Mycroft understood that he had already made his choice, and he was just trying to make it a little easier.
John formulated a plan while Sherlock seemed frozen, knowing what was about to happen, that he was going to lose a sibling today, this time for real. And by John’s hands. What has this world done to him?
“Good afternoon, dear brother. Miss me already?” Sherlock made no effort to conceal his anger at being interrupted.
He quickly stopped himself. Sherlock hated when he said things like that. Sherlock wouldn’t be his Sherlock without his brilliant mind, obsessive tendencies, attention to detail, and no thought for what might be considered societal norms. Those are the things that John loved about Sherlock, and he would never ask him to change.
“Because!” Sherlock exploded, pacing more erratically, his voice growing steadily louder. “My deductions are always based in reason. In science! And yet, the facts I could see in your face clear as day had become muddled in my own feelings!” He put such a scorn on the last word that it sounded like a curse. “John, I am a man of logic. Whatever is between us is not logical! I don’t know what you’ve done to me, but it’s the first thing in my life that I don’t understand. It’s infuriating!” He leaned against the wall as if out of breath.
Sherlock did not respond, and Mycroft continued. “Who is the only one here clever enough to get you out of this mess. I will! I’ve always been pulling strings for you, over and over again! Who is the only one who can save your ass this time?” By the end of his statement, he was shouting at Sherlock.
Sherlock looked out the Window of his room at the Holmes mansion and heaved a sigh. It was going to rain today. Fitting, he thought. The day he was finally going to go back to London and it was about to rain.
He hoped though, that the stranger was simply shy and not outright ignoring him because he found John repulsive.
After a few minutes he had finally calmed down enough to see that his eyes had somehow adapted to the darkness and he was able to make out the stranger’s form, which was pressed up on the wall at the other side of the elevator. Wait, was he trembling?
John must have felt the changing of the mood in the room, for he had calmed somewhat and was regarding Sherlock with a strange expression. Almost as if to ...
That’s what Sherlock had thought anyway. Before he met John. Because now he could understand. He could understand it very well even. All those women John wasted the time with dating. If Sherlock was an insensitive arse to everyone else, he took great joy in being an insufferable git to them even more. He just couldn’t stand them. They were all so offensive with their boring personalities. It was like they competed for the price of the dullest girlfriend. And John didn’t even seem to mind. He actually
John squirmed a bit on the mattress. He knew this would make his erection seem even more prominent, but he couldn’t care less. Or rather he could, but he didn’t want to. He
“For fuck‘s sake Sherlock, stop being so mysterious. If it‘s not Irene, then who is it? Because I can’t take it anymore. I can’t just delete my feelings for you and act like it’s all fine. It’s not, not for me. I can’t stand the thought of you being with some one else. I’m sorry Sherlock, but I ...“
“I‘m so sorry Sherlock! All I‘ve said that upset you. Everything I did that annoyed you. I wish I could take it all back. Calling you a machine, yelling at you for ruining my jumpers. I didn‘t mean any of it.“
Of course if John would equal Sherlock in intelligence and perceptiveness, the Reservation could have been made by John for John and himself. But Sherlock knew that John was clueless about Sherlock’s state. Thus the limp.
your death! Two years Sherlock! And then you come bouncing back as if nothing had happened. You don't give me an explanation or a reason, just tell me you're not dead and then you fucking leave me again! FOR FUCK'S SAKE SHERLOCK!"
It happened right after John had stepped out of the shower, dried himself off and put on his bathrobe.
John was definitely done for. He desperately felt the need to kiss this beautiful creature, that conveniently lay on top of him, and so he did just that.
Which is why he currently pouted on his couch, with his back turned to Mycroft and pointedly ignored everything his Brother had said for the last half hour. After a few last attempts at having a grown-up conversation with his baby brother, Mycroft let out a deep sigh and heft himself up from John's chair. When Mycroft had first come in and occupied John's chair, with the audacity of totally disregarding the fact that Sherlock never let
“I know my appearance here is a little unexpected John, but you really don’t need to hold your breath!“, Sherlock said with a smile, that he hoped looked rather teasing than nervous.
John could not touch it today. Feeling that coldness of the marble against his skin would remind him of how cold Sherlock’s lifeless body had felt after the fall.
If John thought he couldn’t have gotten any angrier, well he could. And he did. With two long steps he strode over to Sherlock and stopped mere inches from where he was still seated in his chair. He grabbed Sherlock by the collar, which earned him a high pitched gasp and dragged him over to the nearest wall. He pinned Sherlock‘s hands with his left hand over the younger man’s head and fixated him with his body. Now the fear was very visible in the detective‘s clear green eyes, but John didn’t care. He was so angry.
a dark voice in Sherlock's head had retorted. No, John definitely had left. His chair was still there, opposite Sherlock's, but his favorite mug was gone. Same thing with his favorite jumpers. He had left most of his Shirts, but his socks and underwear were gone. There was also only one coat hanging on the hanger now. No Jacket and no brown shoes. There weren't any cheap crime novels by the fireplace and the James Bond DVD collection wasn't sitting on top of the DVD player as it used to. And there was most definitely not the SIG-Sauer P226R in John's desk drawer. John might have left a lot behind, but the things he took were the things of importance to him. The things he wanted,
"Right, uhm, I should really go now! There’s probably security coming to check what’s causing the disruption soon.“
Sherlock slowly turned around. John could see fear in his eyes for the blink of an eye, until Sherlock caught himself again and schooled his expression to ambivalence.
Before John could think anything else though, Sherlock’s hand had landed on John’s neck and used just a little bit of pressure, to signal for John to lean his head onto his shoulder. They both slowly drew closer to one another, until they were fully embraced in each other’s arms.
“I‘ve met some one, Sherlock. Her name is Mary and I am gonna ask her to marry me. I know you don‘t think much of marriage and love in general. Sentiment is not an advantage, isn‘t that what you used to say? I know that now to be true, but I can’t survive alone. She could never replace you, I know that. But she can make me forget, at least for most of the time and if it hadn‘t been for her, I wouldn’t be here anymore. I wanted to follow you, you know. I would follow you anywhere. Even in death.“
”Yes John, give it to the air good and hard! You’re so desperate for release and all just because I’m watching!”
The young man looked up at that and for a second their eyes met, but then he looked away again and hid himself further behind the woman. Said woman smiled sweetly at John and pressed the button with the number four on it. John tried not to show his disappointment at the briefness of the eye contact. It was always like that. The man only ever looked at John for about three seconds before he found a way to politely ignore him. Whether it was by tapping rapidly on his phone or now by hiding behind the nice woman and studying his own shoes.
John used his hand, that lay on the stone to push himself up and leaned onto his cane for support. He let his eyes roam over the grave one last time and imagined it was Sherlock he was looking at. Then, without another word, he turned around and slowly made his way back to the gate, where a beautiful woman with a warm smile waited for him.
After some time looking around, Sherlock’s eyes finally set on the back of a rather short, but sturdy man with grey hair. His posture was exceptionally straight and there was a cane, resting next to his chair on the floor.
John had one hand fisted on Sherlock’s collar, the other roaming through his dark mop of curls. Christ were they soft. What kind of conditioner did Sherlock use?
At that Sherlock couldn’t help but smile. All of a sudden he couldn’t wait to finally see John again. What was he doing, standing in front of a Hotel and nearly having a panic attack. No, he would be fine. John might be angry at first, for Sherlock having fooled him and leaving him behind. John reminded Sherlock of a german Shepherd in so many ways. They were always extremely hurt when they were left behind as well. But that was not the point. The most important trait John had to offer was that he would always forgive Sherlock in the end. He was extremely loyal - again, just like a german Shepherd - and Sherlock knew John would do anything for him. Just like Sherlock would, and had done in fact, for John. They needed each other like they needed air. Sherlock had been made painfully aware of that during his time away from his Doctor. With renewed confidence, Sherlock strode into the Hotel and walked through the foyer in the direction of the Restaurant.
