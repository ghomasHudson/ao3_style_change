"You can. And you will. Because I said so." His lips quirked. "But if you'd like to try to convince me to let you out..."
Steve gave an agonized cry as the all encompassing orgasm he had struggled so hard to reach was ripped away, the pleasure evaporating, leaving him overwhelmed and sensitive, but still burning with need. Tony unfastened the restraints, gathering him into his arms and sliding them both to the floor, holding Steve tightly as he sobbed in anguish. James scooted over to join them, sliding his arms around Steve’s shaking body and tucking himself against Tony’s side. Tony continued to make soothing noises, pressing kisses over his brow until Steve had finally gone quiet and still. “There you are. Oh honey. You’ve been so good for us tonight. Just the best boy. And James.” Tony turned to press a gentle kiss to his lips. “You were so good for me, too. Both of you are just the best boys. How did I ever get so lucky?”
The scouting party did find a deer, and once they decided it was normal-looking - or at least, didn't have two faces, three eyes and eight legs - Barton and the red-haired girl had both thrown their knives and taken it down with impressive accuracy. They'd then lugged it back to camp and everyone had cheered once they realized they didn't have to eat stale bread and tough jerkin for dinner.
Flushed, Steve stepped away.
Thor was looking up, into the foliage, his eyes narrowed. 'Hey, buddy, what're you looking at?' Clint called. He shrugged. 'I have glanced upon what my forefathers called a squirrel.' Everyone scrambled over to the tree. If what Thor was saying was true, then the squirrel was the first sign of animal life they'd seen so far.
After they'd given Steve the antidote, they'd turned their full attention to fixing the radio so they could contact the Helicarrier. Since Valkyrie was in the medical bay, Tony was the only one working on it. Occasionally Valkyrie would be allowed to go out and supervise the treatment of her radio, but she needed to take rest or her concussion would worsen.
Clint followed her, ignoring the pain in his abdomen, and he heard the others coming up after him. Natasha had been right. The place was deserted and as silent as a cemetery. The lack of noise gave him the chills and he stood beside her, taking in his desolate surroundings.
'Intruder!' Mantis called out again, and Natasha hesitated, her attention still on Bucky. 'Go,' he croaked out, 'I'll be fine.'
'Oh, so that's why he's acting like a mother duck with her ducklings.'
'By the Grounders?' Steve asked, raising an eyebrow.
Tony didn't let himself stop to think.
'Yes. Your staring at my ass is incredibly beneficial to me,' Steve deadpanned.
'Well...' Clint said awkwardly, into the silence, 'should we just... continue, then?' He gestured at the general direction they were heading in. Everybody nodded and Steve took the lead, carefully maneuvering up the gentle slope of the hill. No one had anything to say after that and they all quietly admired their surroundings. Bruce looked especially affected by the squirrel.
'Alright, alright, I'll talk to Tony, calm down, jeez,' Steve huffed, and Bucky grinned triumphantly.
i'm not abandoning this, though. i've spent way too much time and effort writing this.
'Rogers, my old friend,' he said mockingly, raising the firearm and pointing it at Steve's forehead.
‘I’ll go,’ Rhodey said determinedly, pushing past Steve and heading for the drop ship.
There had been a change in the air ever since the delinquents got the rifles. They were no longer scared shitless, waiting to be picked off one by one like fish in a barrel. They were ready for whatever the hell HYDRA might throw at them.
He turned around to look for Tony, scanning the camp. He knew for a fact that all the delinquents had returned - he'd specifically ordered it.
'You're supposed to!'
Thor found himself doubting his life choices every moment he spent around the other juvenile delinquents.
At that exact moment, there was a muted gasp from Natasha and a yell of shock from Bucky.
He was waiting there, his blue irises focused on the ground. When she closed the hatch with a thud he looked up.
'How are you so sure I'm not one myself?'
Tony narrowed his eyes at a small twelve year old boy with a soft face and messy brown hair, who stared back at him with defiant brown eyes until he looked away and directly at an absolutely stunning boy. With silky soft blond hair, baby blue eyes and the stature of a Greek god, he was definitely the most beautiful person Tony had ever seen in his entire life.
There was a short moment of silence when Bucky yawned again, stretched and punched Steve lightly in the shoulder. 'I'm gonna look for food. You coming with?' Steve shook his head and Bucky shrugged. 'Your loss.' He sauntered away and towards the drop ship.
He took a deep breath and exhaled heavily, placing his hands on his hips.
‘Buck, I gotta do this, please,’ he told his oldest friend, and Bucky must have seen the anguish and desperation in his voice because he fell back reluctantly, jaw set.
She arched an eyebrow. 'Just how much whiskey did you drink?'
'Other than making you blush.'
He looked around at their motley group. After the whole thing with Rumlow, Stark suggested that a couple of people should head out from the makeshift camp and look for where they were supposed to be. The blond, who'd introduced himself as Steve Rogers, was first to volunteer, and Bucky Barnes was close to follow.
'Hey, birdbrain, found the bows to your arrows,' Loki called mockingly.
'Us?' he asked hesitantly.
'Oh, yeah? Didn't know that. Would've, if we'd talked more, but...' Steve trailed off, keeping his eyes on Tony, trying to gauge the young billionaire's reaction.
'Don't question Pierce unless you want to end up dead. I'm sure he had his reasons.' The second voice was higher and smoother but most definitely male.
As soon as the drop ship had exploded, Steve had contacted the Helicarrier in a frenzy, Barnes right beside him, both of them shaking with silent tears and rage. Carol had immediately connected, her face pale and her blue eyes watery.
'You're one to speak, you could've
Howard and Maria Stark weren't on the Exodus ship, and when Tony heard, several conflicting emotions passed across his face. Thor detected relief, a sort of weary resignation, anger and indignation. Bruce heard that his father had been on the ship, but his mother was fine. He took the news surprisingly well and went about his normal duties, but he was quieter than usual and his gaze was watery when Thor went to check on him.
The dark-haired boy next to Rogers with the metal arm furiously stepped forward but Rogers held him back. 'I'm not trying to lord it over you. I'm trying to tell you if we don't do something about our situation we're all going to be dead in a matter of days,' he snapped, clearly trying to keep his cool but failing.
'We don't know who did it,' Steve told her gently.
'Clint, people don't die from tripping over a - whatever that thing is.'
'Some taken,' she told him, but she wasn't hurt. She'd already known that and thought a lot worse about herself. 'My name's Natasha,' she added, and his face lit up. 'Natasha...' he prompted, and she groaned. 'Natasha Romanoff,' she snapped, and he grinned wider. 'Now we're making progress. Not bad, Natasha.'
He shrugged. 'Nothing. Just... yeah, nothing.'
Steve's seventeenth birthday had just passed.
Rumlow’s laughter continued. ‘You’re wasting my time. I have no need for Stark’s little friends.’
'Then why are you even here?' he asked her, oblivious of the fact that he'd just given himself away.
She hung out at the back of the group, unwilling to talk to any of her friends. James shot her a concerned look but she didn't say anything to him either. She couldn't let him get closer to her than he already had. She wouldn't. She even stopped speaking to Clint. If she let them break down any more of her walls it would be her downfall.
'We've been trying to intimidate him by talking for almost half an hour,' snarled Tony, who was standing by the fried controls. 'If we're gonna keep babying him then Steve's gonna die.'
'Guys, are you all
It was a sad sight - the smoking drop ship on the forest floor, blood still on the seat, and the radio -
He grabbed Steve's hand and they sprinted back to the safety of camp, collapsing into hysterical, wheezing laughter when they reached, covered in dirt and blood but still alive.
Steve started. Tony was glancing at him from the corner of those chocolate-brown eyes, a small smile tugging at his lips. So he did notice Steve's ogling, apparently. Steve didn't say anything back. He didn't trust himself to.
'No, no shovel, but we did find large pieces of metal, no idea what they used it for,' she said, frowning slightly.
Bucky and Natasha burst in through the front door, both of them disheveled and dirty with uncharacteristically panicked faces. Natasha leaned against the wall and Bucky dropped to the floor, both of them trying to catch their breath. Bucky's jacket pocket and Natasha's pants' back pocket were both bulging.
Tony stood up and hit Pepper head-on. 'Sorry, sorry, Pep,' he said quickly, and she steadied him, scanning his face. 'Don't beat yourself up, Tony, they made a choice,' she said quietly, pulling him into a hug. 'Yeah,' he said, not convinced, and she sighed and grabbed his hand.
Steve looked at Tony, who shrugged. 'After you.'
Rumlow didn’t look anything like the boy who had punched him in the face a year and a half ago. HYDRA’s torture had brutally scarred his face and body, and he didn’t even look human anymore. He looked like the man with the red skull Steve had seen on the bridge.
Steve turned to him, opened his mouth, hesitated for a second - and then kissed him.
Steve ventured further into the room. He realized that his first assumption was wrong - not everything was cleared out. There were several untouched boxes. He presumed that they hadn't gotten time to take everything with them - they'd only taken what they could carry.
He poked around the ruins. There really wasn't much to it. It was wrecked. Steve crouched by what looked like the remains of someone's trophy. The gold-colored plastic was blackened and burned. He ran his fingers over the faded letters on it. Someone had earned this and was proud of it over a century ago. What had happened to them?
Steve was quiet for a few moments, and then he said, 'I suppose you're right.'
They spent around half an hour wandering about the river, diving occasionally when the water got to deep and surfacing with no results.
'Everyone get away from the drop ship,' Natasha ordered, but her eyes widened and she touched her throat just as dark red blood dripped from her eyelashes, sliding down her cheeks. She turned to Clint but he was already on his hands and knees, violently gagging.
I did not.'
Steve really couldn't hold back after that.
She looked at him.
'Is it an apology you want? Even if it isn't, I want to tell you I'm sorry. I'm really sorry for letting that happen to you, and I want you to know I didn't sleep peacefully for days ever since I told you to get out.'
'We're on Earth, Tones! Can you believe it?' she said excitedly, as Rhodey joined them. 'Oh, my god, is that
Loki gave him such a scornful look that he held up both hands in surrender.
'Um -' Steve almost squeaked, '- thanks? You're - you're gorgeous too,' he admitted, his face a shade of red so dark he could be mistaken for a fucking beetroot.
'I won't, I know what I'm doing!' Tony screamed.
'I say Steve as well,' said Bucky immediately, and Sam, Scott and Wanda voiced their agreement.
'Yeah, that's my real name. You didn't think I was born Bucky Barnes, did you?'
He longingly thought of his home, Asgard, the little space station unregistered with the other twelve but instead floating around on its own, surviving by itself yet somehow managing to look far more beautiful than the steel-grey and blinding-white of the other space stations he'd seen.
'Well, then, I thought we could take it apart. See what's in there and go look for whatever it is because it helped Clint, didn't it? Whoever - or whatever - made it knew what they were doing.'
'But didn't Fury say something about a mountain?' Natasha said, furrowing her eyebrows, realizing that her throwaway sentence was actually a huge problem. 'He said there was a mountain with a hidden bunker inside, stocked with supplies from the war, but the people never got around to using it. He said we were going to land on it. Mount Weather, right?'
Steve stood up.
'I could possibly recreate it,' Bruce finished.
It was only when Bucky saw a few drops of blood that they realized they were going in the right direction.
'Just - just shut up for a moment, Rumlow, okay? I'm sorry. I didn't mean for that to happen and I'm sorry but we really need to deal with this situation,' Steve finally got out, his voice tense, and Bruce could see the remorse in his eyes.
Guards.
'They really did stay up all night, didn't they?' Clint asked, looking at where Bruce had just left.
well, i'm done here, hope you enjoyed, stay safe, see you tomorrow and lots of love,
'Do you think we can find Clint in time?'
'Loki, what do you think you're doing?' he demanded, crouching beside the fourteen-year-old black-haired boy who was striking a match against a pile of kindling. 'I'm lighting a fire, you oaf,' he snapped back, and Thor arched an eyebrow. 'Oh, no, I'm blind, I couldn't see that -
Steve heard a muffled
The next moment he was dangling upside-down and being carried at ridiculous speeds, definitely bleeding out, barely able to form coherent thoughts. At one point he'd hit his head and then blacked out. He hadn't seen his attackers' faces once, but he knew they were human. No animal could move like that, act with such grace and purpose.
He was interrupted when Tony leaned forward and kissed him on the lips.
'We're here,' Loki announced, when they reached the area where the outpost was supposed to be.
(See the end of the chapter for
(See the end of the chapter for
'You're going to go anyway and you're going to carry at least three guns while you're at it. Don't worry, I won't tell,' she stated matter-of-factly, and he smirked.
close their mouths.
understand. Steve knew of his relationship with Natasha, and Bucky hadn't gotten over her, not by a long shot. He wanted to hear his oldest friend's familiar laugh, which he hadn't heard properly for more than two years. He wanted to explain to Tony how much he meant to Steve, how much Steve would sacrifice for him, how much he was loved.
'The bridge won't survive me, baby,' Tony said firmly, a glint in his eye, and walked backwards from them, giving them a mock salute.
Loki nodded. 'I'm sorry, brother,' he said softly, and Thor smiled a sad smile.
'Is Steve -?'
Before Clint could reply, Natasha smacked him and he was cut off with a 'shit, Tasha, not
'The movies make this look cooler. Hell, even Romanoff makes this look cooler.'
Tony crouched in front of the worn metal and got to work on it. Two weeks of it being underground, exposed to dirt and insects and meddling creatures had not been beneficial in any way to the metal.
The three of them trooped to the front of the spacecraft, pushing through the crowd. In front of the doors was the hot blond boy and his metal-armed companion, trying to open the doors. Tony rolled his eyes and shoved past them. 'Move aside, dinosaurs, it's not even hard to do,' he muttered, ignoring their glares.
'James?'
'Still,' Tony butted in, narrowing his eyes at Loki. 'It wouldn't be fair if he got off without any punishment at all. You know what I say? I think he should go back to HYDRA. As a double agent. Feed 'em false information, get all the good stuff for us. You know?'
Heightened senses come in handy in a lot of ways.
But, when the time comes, they all gather there at that house by the lake to say their final goodbyes.
Steve had learned that truth the hard way, all the way back towards the beginning of his relationship with Tony, back before he took what they’d been building and snapped it down the middle with his own two hands.
He starts to smile.  Starts to talk and engage and just
the longing, in his eyes before Bucky wipes it away.
“Right then,” Steve murmurs as he steps off of the plane, a perfected photostatic veil firmly in place.  “Time to get to work.”
“Okay,” Steve agrees, tears hot and thick in his throat.  “
He sets his mirror image upright on the couch and then collapses back down onto the cushion beside him.
They find the scepter with the Mind Stone still intact.
.  Even if he hated me it would’ve been better.”
“It’s all good, Cap,” Tony waves him off in that way Steve knows he only does when he can’t deal with some sort of deep emotion right away.  “Water under the bridge, I was a dick too.  So come on in and let’s see what we can do about finding out what SHIELD and everyone’s favorite pirate is up to.”
“He would have liked you,” Steve finally murmurs.  “If, if things had been different, if he’d had …
“Alright,” Tony says.  “I’ll bite.  When do you plan on stopping by or do you want me to meet you somewhere?”
"Steve?" Tony looks stricken, looks
Steve can hardly blame him.  This is, after all, the first time Steve’s reached out to him since they parted after the invasion.
Steve never really leaves after that day.
After that all it takes is a quick rinse, some bleach, a little elbow work, and then everything’s ...
“I should kill you,” Rhodes had told him one night in Wakanda after half the universe had turned to ash around them.  “I should kill you where you stand, for what you did to him, for how you hurt him.”
“I love you and I love Buck,” Steve tells Tony easily.  “He’s my brother, my version of Rhodes.  I want him to have good things, to be happy.  And you’re the best thing Tony, the best thing in the entire universe.  You make everything better and you’ve got so much love to give.  I wouldn’t mind if you gave some of it to him.  If you’d let the both of us try and keep you happy like you keep us.”
And Tony, obviously curious, obviously confused but still more than a bit delighted and unable to not soak in his easy affections, lets him.
“I was doing some thinking about the things you said on the helicarrier,” Steve starts carefully.  He needs to get this right.  “About Fury and his secrets.  That kind of thing.”
“Sorry about this,” Steve can’t help but say as he stares down at Wanda.  “If there was another way I’d take it.”
but … but it would have been better than
Together they bring him
They die just as easily for Steve as they had for Zemo.
Slides right into pulling Tony closer with an arm around his waist, fingers running through his hair and kisses, light and sweet against his temples.
This time Tony is the one who says, “Let’s bring your boy home, Cap.  And burn the fuckers who did this to him, the ones who killed my mother, to the ground once and for all.”
“Sorry you lost that,” Bucky says softly against his temple.  “Sorry the whole universe lost that.”
Only this time Tony won’t be rising from the ashes.
Steve’s got a bag full of diamonds to fund his way if necessary and a duffel full of Tony’s tech and a few other bits and bobs to help out the rest of the time.
In that moment Steve knows, knows in his bones and his
“What if he doesn’t come back?” Steve had bitten the words out.  “What if he …”
With Tony’s help they find Bucky before he’s ever defrosted and deployed.
Wants to hold him one last time.  Wants to feel Tony’s weight in his arms again like they’ve ached to since the last time Steve held him all those years ago.  Wants one more chance to breathe in the scent of molten steel and oil and oranges that always seemed to hover over Tony no matter what.
That’s a lesson that he’d learned a bit too late the first time around.  Tony didn’t need his protection from everything and everybody, didn’t need him trying to step into every single fight Tony might find himself in.  He never had.  Tony could take care of himself in more ways than most of them had ever given him credit for.
Finally he settles into a bed he can’t wait to no longer call his own.
That surprise gives Steve more than enough time to bring the gun up and fire.
But he doesn’t.
“Do tell,” Tony prompts, brows arched high.
The look on his face when he sees Steve,
It’s a bitter and cruel sort of thought to have but Steve can’t help but think that Tony would have hated the gesture.
Another veil, some top-tier scrambling gear, and he’s inside his old apartment.
Wants to go right to Tony, to sweep him up into his arms and never let him go.
Tony out of all of the same issues played in a slightly different way.
All of Thor's poor decision-making, however, couldn't make him regret moving to the Helicarrier, even if it was plain, boring and designed to meet the bare minimum of its inhabitants' needs. It made up for its utter blandness by the people it held. Thor found them fascinating. He loved people. All sorts of people - from different cultures, different races, different backgrounds - they were all so absolutely gorgeous in their own way.
Bruce gasped. 'Biological warfare. They... they gave him a sickness... it's contagious.'
No, he was not. If his prostate body on the ground was any indication.
'No.'
Steve took a deep breath. 'Loki - and Rumlow, Sitwell and Rollins - leave the camp. Leave right now and if you come back, I swear I'll let them finish what they started.'
'Uh... I don't know. A lot?' he offered, still smiling like an idiot.
Delinquents were lined up, talking to their families, talking to their friends. One person was let in at a time. Sam Wilson had taken it upon himself to notify the next of kin of the deceased delinquents, and after that was done, he was made in charge of the system, setting up meetings for the other delinquents.
He fell to his knees and crawled over to where he'd carelessly thrown his backpack onto the ground. Water, his hazy mind told him, and he pulled out his water bottle and chugged it down, spilling water all over his shirt.
Tony looked up in panic. He wasn't done, he needed more time or else the bomb wouldn't work.
It was quite easy to remove a small section of the metal without making much noise, and anyway Rumlow thought they were still shoving objects between the drop ship doors to somehow lever them open.
'Did you find any magazines?' she asked, weighing the gun in her hand. It was a good one. She loved using the Glock series because they were handguns, more her style than massive sniper rifles.
There was a long pause.
Rhodey had been smarter and paced in front of the drop ship like a caged tiger until Tony came out, cleared by Bruce as mildly ill, recovering and ready to go out and blow shit up.
Fucking Barton, too.
'I don't have another explanation,' Steve said, shrugging again.
'Tony, are you okay?'
'I do many things that you are not aware of, my friend,' a third, very familiar voice said. It was silky, drawling and most definitely Loki.
'Who's gonna make the shot? To set off the bomb? It's roughly two hundred meters, we checked and came back,' Clint said, having caught the tail end of their conversation, leaning on Natasha. Both of them were disheveled and dirty from their scouting.
'Uh, yeah, that was Darcy for you,' Jane got out, her cheeks still pink, and before Thor could say anything else she told him, 'See you later, then!' and hurried after Darcy. Thor shrugged and continued on his way. Females did mystifying things sometimes, and Thor didn't fret or get himself worked up for not understanding them. He liked to remain blissfully ignorant. It was soothing.
Steve paused, and then met Tony's pleading puppy dog eyes, and he sighed.
When no one made any move towards Loki, he laughed. A maniacal, bitter laugh that chilled Bruce to the bone.
'Brunnhilde, but you can call me Valkyrie,' the girl replied, her distrustful gaze sweeping the half-awake delinquents who were staggering out of their tents and the drop ship.
Bruce finally stood up. His legs were hurting but he knew he had to do something before he could get rest. He followed Loki, staying at a good distance so the boy wouldn't notice him, all the way back to camp. He was let in by the guards and Bruce jogged to catch up before they closed the gate.
'You did last time.'
Everything was going to be alright.
Clint craned his neck. He had excellent eyesight, a feature of his that had once saved Fury's life, but his hearing was rather poor. His brother had joked that when God made Clint, he accidentally made his eyes overpowered and decided to reduce his hearing to compensate.
It was a challenge to stay out of both sight and earshot of the three. Thankfully, both Clint and Bucky knew how to walk silently, unlike Steve and Thor, who knew nothing of the word 'subtle'. He was sure Nat had heard them. She didn't miss anything. However, Bucky assured him that she already knew about backup, so he shouldn't be worried.
'Let's go, then.'
Clint Barton.
'Hey,' Bruce greeted. 'We think we've figured out what's in this poultice. A poultice, essentially, is the direct application of the crude, fresh herb to the skin, usually to reduce the chance inflammatory or septic wounds. They've used all the regular herbs - chamomile, for antiseptic properties, crushed poppy heads, flaxseed, honey - we can get all that. There's some in this very bunker.'
'What are you waiting for?' Loki asked, raising an eyebrow.
'They were expecting you guys. I'm sure there's an infiltrator in your Council. I've never seen their leader, he must be in space. They want to get rid of you. They were scaring you off at first, but then you got too meddlesome, and now they're planning an attack on you.'
'Of course you do.'
She scowled.
She was the exact opposite - sitting stiff and straight, her legs folded under her, Indian-style, both hands in her lap.
The two of them watched the drop ship's path across the sky. At the last moment, its lander activated and the drop ship floated down to the ground not too far away.
'Beating him up is going to achieve nothing, and neither is electrocuting him, so stay away from those wires, Stark -'
There was a silence amongst the delinquents as she wiped the girl's blood off the mercy-killer.
'What the
Tony ignored the millions of questions he had in his head and spat out the gag. He needed to get out of there, and fast. He rolled over to the wall, where he could see sharp edges of rocks poking out, and scrubbed the rope around his wrists against the rocks, hoping to at least weaken it.
Pity.
dating. Boyfriend-girlfriend kind of dating.'
'B. R. ... what do they stand for?' Steve asked, clearly struggling to connect the dots.
Yeah. Keep telling yourself that and you'll eventually become so much of a clown that you won't be able to go anywhere without your fucking red nose, Rogers.
'Somebody stole it! Fuck me, I'm so stupid, I should've immediately contacted the Helicarrier -'
Thor sighed. 'Do you want water?'
and he's holding Tony hostage in there and he won't let any of us through.'
'Okay, you have. Now what?'
'Hey, hey, calm down, okay? What's going on?' Steve said authoritatively, pushing through the crowd.
'What - no!' Steve looked up, blushing, at her incredulous expression.
Silence... silence...
Bucky Barnes was definitely another human being.
Red laughed. 'What resources?'
'I'm coming,' Tony said determinedly. Steve arched an eyebrow at him, but didn't say anything.
'Guess what, bitches?' he announced to the room at large, and whoever was in the bunker - Bruce, Steve, Clint and Natasha - all looked at him.
'Wait,' Bucky said suddenly. He pointed to the ground. 'Footprints. Any chance they could belong to our mystery thief?'
He shrugged. 'Yeah. I'm a professional fortune-teller.' He grinned at her and she turned away so he wouldn't see the light coloring of her cheeks.
'Yeah. Anyways, I didn't come here and risk my life to bitch about the system. I wanted to tell you that they're lying. Project Exodus... the first ship it isn't ready to come down in three to four days, first of all. Secondly, it only has space for seven hundred people, and there are two thousand on the Helicarrier. That bullshit he was saying about your parents coming down? It's not even finalized yet. They might be coming down next year, they might not come down at all.'

'I'm fine. Totally fine. What makes you ask that, honey bear?' Tony questioned.
'He's coming,' Natasha confirmed, materializing behind Tony, her trusty gun on her hip as usual. Steve chanced a quick glance at Bucky, who was openly staring at her, and smirked.
'Already did,' she mumbled.
'Fuck Steve,' Bucky whispered angrily, and Clint nodded along. Fuck Steve, indeed.
He wished he had his shield. He had recovered a shiny metal shield in the shape of a circle from Mount Weather. Clint had been derisive of his choice and, on the way back, tried to demonstrate how useless the object was by firing his assault rifle at it. The bullet didn't even leave a dent. Steve had been impressed, although Clint continued to mock him.
'They deserve it!'
His younger brother was still tied up, his dark hair unkempt, blood and dirt still on his cheeks and hands, deliberately ignoring Thor. Thor had tried to clean his wounds for him - they were just scratches and a bruise on his jaw where Bucky had hit him, but Thor was still worried. However, Loki adamantly refused to let Thor come anywhere near him.
Natasha was about to say something in return when Loki crouched, ran his hands over the ground, closed his fist around something and pulled. A section of the forest floor swung open like a trapdoor and Loki turned to them with a flourish, smirking.
Bruce volunteered first. He felt like he wasn't doing much at all to help the camp. Sure, he'd helped Clint recover, but that was only because Betty came up with the idea of taking apart the poultice. Thor volunteered, as did Sam and Bucky.
That was why every single time he was out in the wilderness, he kept an eye out to see if he could find his brother. Especially now that they knew there was a gang of human beings out there who wanted to chase them off the planet. He tried not to think about the possibility that Loki had already been kidnapped by them. He was morose enough as it was.
Natasha paused, stymied.
He was nearly unconscious from the pain that followed his action but he was kissing her.
Rhodey rolled his eyes. 'I'm being serious, Tones,' he said, in that voice Tony was so used to hearing, a mix of fondness and exasperation.
'Let's go, then,' he said, and they both got up. 'You take the downstairs. There's a hatch, I'm going to go up there and see what the hell that is.' Bruce nodded in agreement and got to work, beginning with the far end of the drop ship as Tony pulled down the ladder to the hatch and climbed up.
There was a murderer in the camp.
He's like my brother. If he - if anything happened to him, I don't know what I'd do. Back in the drop ship, I really thought it was the end for him, and I couldn't bear it, I really couldn't -'
He was shoved to the ground by none other than Steve, whose blue eyes were panicked.
'Hey,' he told them. 'Heard you were going to investigate the Exodus ship. I'm coming, too.'
There were four casualties that day, and it was just around twelve in the afternoon.
'Who's going first, then?' he asked into the silence. Steve, obviously, began to climb down. As if he hadn't been any more noble and self-sacrificing already. 'If you die I got dibs on that spear, Rogers!' Barton yelled after him, to which Steve replied with a classic 'fuck off', much to Tony's delight,
'I'm saying it's of no use to me.'
anyways, much love, see you all next time <3
Steve's hands raked up Tony's shirt and his nails lightly scratched his boyfriend's abs. The other boy softly moaned into his mouth and tugged on Steve's short blond hair. Steve blushed and Tony grinned, pulling him closer, grinding his body into Steve's.
Loki rolled his eyes. 'The purpose of our mission is to simply confer with you. The Supreme HYDRA will not be attending but his subordinate is. He will meet you on the bridge tomorrow at twelve on the dot. Do not be late and do not miss it. This may be your last chance to speak to us.'
'It's alright. I forgive you.'
He'd almost racked up the courage, but then he'd had that accident while testing the effects of gamma radiation - which Betty had been helping him with - and he really didn't know what happened, but later on they'd told him he'd injected way too much gamma radiation for the dosage of the myostatic primer.
He'd been worrying over the mess that was his life - his father lying to him and then beating him up for being gay, his mother either ignoring him for most of his life or trying to reconcile with him after she came to the realization that he was, in fact, her son, Jarvis passing away, Steve - heck, he thought a lot about Steve, way too much than even he'd admit.
No one had, much to Tony's disappointment, except for the boy sitting next to Steve, with ice-blue eyes, choppy brown hair that came till halfway down his neck and a gorgeous metal arm which Tony ached to get his hands on. He was pretty sure his father had made a metal arm once, and he wondered if it was the one the boy had.
Wow. What a shocker.
'Tones, you okay?' Rhodey asked him quietly.
'Well, for starters, they are not ready for you at all. If you attacked tomorrow they'll all be dead in a few hours. Most of the delinquents are still recovering from the sickness and there are fifteen dead, so that would make the total amount of delinquents eighty-five,' Loki said.
Her face was one of shock for roughly two seconds before she realized he was joking and she smacked him again.
He'd raised the alarm and she fled, as everyone was shouting and panicking, all their focus on their wounded Chancellor. Clint and a few other members of the guard chased her down. She knew for a fact that Clint hadn't seen anything of her except for her eyes and the glint of her sniper rifle, since he wasn't the one who caught her and threw her in jail, but she knew she had to be careful around him.
'Hello. I'm Steve Rogers, and I'm the leader of the delinquent camp.'
new chapter! :) first off, i want to start by saying i have close to zero knowledge about treating wounds and all that medical stuff. if i get something horribly wrong then please tell me and definitely do not try this shit in real life, kids, because you'll most likely die.
Steve held them back and glared at the drop ship doors. ‘Is it justice you want, Rumlow?’ he yelled, and there was a pause.
he got out, after Natasha thumped him on the back.
'Great!' she said, smiling. She stood up and walked away.
i don't have anything else to say, hope you enjoyed babes, see you tomorrow and lots of love~
'Yeah, no shit, Rogers.'
No one said anything. Even Tony, who usually had a snarky comment on the tip of his tongue, was quiet.
It was hard work and Natasha blinked at the mess in her tent. Ever since Clint moved to the bunker she had to find another roommate. Or tent mate. Whatever. James - even though he was technically her boyfriend - came over a lot, but he was sharing a tent with Steve.
Tony walked a bit further away from them, his mind alternating between screaming about how Clint was gone and probably dead and then berating him for avoiding Steve after that night in the bunker. They hadn't had sex, much to Tony's disappointment. Steve slept on the couch and gave Tony the bed. It had been very quiet after they kissed.
, sitting on his couch is actually kind of funny.
“Wish we’d gotten the chance,” Bucky sighs quietly.  “Wish it had all worked out differently for all of us.  All the stories you told me about him?  He seemed …
Steve puts his gun away, stands, and then moves over to pick his younger self up off of the floor.
Tony and Bruce lock it away, dampen its energy outputs as best they can and pass ideas back and forth about world wide protections.
Tony’s breath leaves him in a shuddering sigh.
, but he doesn’t get the chance.
“Maybe?” Steve hedges.  “I just … there are some things I’d like to talk to you about and I … I thought maybe we could get to know each other?”
This time

“What can I do you for, Captain my Captain?” Tony’s familiar banter brings Steve sharply back into focus.
“Sounds like it would’ve been a good life,” Bucky muses.
His eyes are, of course, immediately drawn towards the Tower.
Either way Steve doesn’t actually plan to stay long.
And then, as if nothing of real import had actually happened, Rhodes had just ...

Surprise and a shy sort of delight spread their way across Tony’s face in return.
Steve thinks the fact that Tony’s cremated is almost poetic.

“Rhodes,” Steve whispers his name, half plea, half request, half something he can’t really name.

“Don’t,” Rhodes, because Steve lost the right to call him Jim years ago and Rhodes was never willing to let him earn it back, stops him before he takes more than a handful of steps.  “

It’s simple enough to strip off his now useless gear, to tuck it away in his duffel and pull on a cap and a pair of shades before he steps out onto the busy city street.
'Are you so sure about that as well? Loki, I'm an assassin. I was trained in poisons. I saw that blade. I know exactly what's in it. If I wanted I could just kill you, walk out there, get the ingredients and make the antidote myself.'
He was so distracted he ran right into someone.
Tony must've been more distracted than he thought.
Before Thor could say anything, she turned and walked away.
'Tony, you stay right there,' Steve warned, but Tony was already running towards him.
'You have to!'
'What a tragedy.'
'Last time!'
The mission to assassinate Chancellor Nicholas Joseph Fury.
There was a mumbling exchange of goodbyes and Bruce saw two pairs of boots walk away, towards the river in the opposite direction of camp. Loki hesitated, standing there for a few moments, before spinning around and heading to the camp.
Tony had been coming down when he caught Rumlow suffocating the guard with a plastic bag. He went for the dead delinquent's gun but Rumlow got there first and held it to his head, telling all the delinquents watching that he would shoot Tony if they tried to make a move for him. He then shut the drop ship doors and proceeded to declare that Tony was his hostage.
Bruce looked around. The door of the drop ship was open, and he could see delinquents chipping away at the seats - the water from recent rains had already frozen and hardened into ice. Peter Quill and Drax were hanging around the food tent, where they cured meats and stored their food, and were tossing nuts into each other's mouths.
Could you tell she had not the least clue about starting a relationship?
She wasn't afraid of failure and punishment, or her ever-growing list of enemies, or that she was going to die - or anything reasonable, really.
'I'm trying not to trip,' Steve offered weakly, and Rumlow grunted.
'Okay, then. I'll see you later, Laufeyson.' With that, Steve whirled around and headed towards the communications tent. Bruce ran after him.
'...no.'
Part of the reason he wished he was small again was because of Bucky. Their families weren't wealthy or affluent, so both the boys took on jobs when they were young to try and earn some money. Bucky somehow got himself a spot on guard duty, a highly coveted job, at fourteen, and when Steve gained both height and muscle a year later, Bucky managed to get him in as well.
Another dead end.
Nat suppress the urge to roundhouse kick him. 'You injured one of our own and tied him up to warn him off. You killed five of us and you also raided us several times. You took one of us hostage and you stabbed and poisoned me. I think that these are all acts of war as well.'
'Yes. They knew I was in the camp. They killed Sitwell and Rollins, I don't know what happened to Odinson's brother. They kept me hostage, tortured me for information,' he said hoarsely, still not meeting anyone's eyes.
Steve huffs, clears his throat, reaches over to pat the other him on the head.
Once. Twice.
This time Tony and JARVIS are the ones to find the HYDRA files.
For a long moment Tony just stares at him, gaze tracking over him and mind obviously working at lightning speed.  And then, finally, Tony seems to just melt, seems to soften even further than before.
Bucky gets better, bit by bit.

Steve’s surprisingly content to let all of that play out again just like it had in his original timeline.  Even if a part of him itches to head it off at the pass, to step up and step in and protect Tony.
Tony’s still with Pepper right now.  He hasn’t had the chance to face Killian or to finally realize just how deep the stress fractures in his and Pepper’s relationship have spread.  It's coming soon though, real soon.
Mainly because it’s not actively on fire or being lifted into the air.
But he doesn't say anything.
Steve thinks they should have put the reactor on a mountain instead, should have enshrined it on some rocky cliff top somewhere as close to the sky as possible.
Instead he slides seamlessly back into the rhythm he’d once had with Tony.
“Nah,” Bucky quirks a small smile and shakes his head.  “Not this time.”
that's all from me, stay safe, see you all next time and lots of love,
'There was a barrel of gunpowder up there. He must've used it to make the hole. He's long gone now.' Tony's voice sounded distant and flat to his own ears.
'The poultice is still in place, isn't it?' Betty questioned, and Bruce nodded.
'This,' he said, and surprising her, himself and the rest of the world he propped himself up on his elbows and kissed her.
Tony had seen a lot of strange things in his life.
'Hey, Tones,' Steve replied, smiling despite himself and accepting the hug, burying his face in Tony's shoulder, breathing in his scent until it surrounded him and overwhelmed him.
He looked around. He was strapped into his seat, the massive metal brace over his chest holding him in place firmly and uncomfortably. The Quinjet was nothing remarkable - just a escape ship attached to the Helicarrier, designed to withstand the force of entering Earth's atmosphere, with around a hundred seats or so just like his own, each holding a person.
She finally got up and Vision took her place. Thor watched her wearily as she made her way to him. 'Hey. Can you help dig a grave for Pietro? Wanda wanted her brother to have a proper burial,' she told him, stopping in front of the tree he was sitting against.
Tony shrugged. 'Wanna go back and talk to Fury about it?' His voice was closed-off and biting.
'Yeah. They didn't ask for you specifically but I thought I should tell you. Wanna check it out?'
James opened his mouth to argue, and then caught sight of Steve's pleading eyes and reluctantly gave in.
Steve was standing behind him, holding a gun, his face determined and his jaw set. When Tony looked back at the trees he'd been facing before, an injured Grounder was glaring at him viciously. Tony scrambled backwards, managed to get on his feet and ran.
They were walking silently. There was no need for talking and they all knew that. The air was growing colder by the day, and Natasha was freezing but she refused to let it show. They had warm clothes and blankets from the aid depot but not enough to go around. She would bet money that a few more delinquents would freeze to death in the days to come.
Voices that did not sound like children's voices at all.
'I might not know anything but I do know you're holding back a ton of emotions and that's going to fuck you up later on.'
'Okay, I did. Now what're you gonna do about it?'
Thor nodded. 'Lead the way,' he told her, and she set off towards the direction where the drop ship had landed.
'Promise you'll talk to Stark after.'
Bruce watched in horror as they pushed Rumlow's buddies onto the ground as well. They tried to shelter themselves by holding up their arms over their head but the crowd was absolutely brutal and didn't give them a chance.
Thor followed his friends, ill at ease.
'You think some of this stuff still works?' Steve asked, and Clint turned to see him holding up the very same gauntlets he'd been eyeing.
anyways, hope y'all enjoyed today's bit of fanfic, stay safe, see you tomorrow and lots of love,
Thankfully the Grounder turned and went back into the forest, his gait uneven. Tony could see blood. A lot of blood. Steve had shot at the Grounder, therefore potentially saving Tony's life for the second damn time.

Valkyrie looked on the verge of collapse. She was trying to hide it but he could clearly see it. 'Hey, I think she has a concussion,' he interrupted, and everyone turned to look at him. 'Maybe I should treat her first and then when she feels better she can explain why she was in the drop ship.'
Natasha turned her face to hide her laughter and Clint scowled, but he was trying not to laugh as well.
'Bucky,' Steve sighed, 'I'm not going to argue with you about this. I don't want to risk anything, okay? Please.'
He looked on the verge of a breakdown and she turned to fully face him, concerned.
It wasn't crammed in the drop ship and everyone mostly stayed away from each other. Rumlow's group manned the first floor, which was fine by Clint since he liked high places anyway, so he clambered up onto the second floor with Thor, Bruce, a nice dude named T'Challa and some other kids who he could tolerate more than the others.
'Well, I was thinking. About... about our conversation earlier.'
The steps led down into a room which Steve could only describe as depressing. It was filthy, dark and wet. The room had several entrances to hallways and other rooms which all looked equally as unpleasant as the first one.
The only reason she was alive and not floated was because Fury had survived the assassination attempt due to Clint knocking him sideways, but the bullet had hit him and he was gravely injured. Even that could have lead to a death penalty, for she wasn't from the Helicarrier, but Fury had been compassionate. The way he'd studied her made her think he knew about the Red Room.
Tony decided that was not the way he wanted to go.
'So. Any idea what the fuck we're going to do in here?' Tony asked Steve, who shrugged. 'I guess I'll keep going through this, see if I can find anything useful. Maybe you could check the other rooms? Like, we could use the plates and the glasses, and the extra sheets on the bed.'
eye-candy.'
Tony didn't wait to see his reaction. He turned and sprinted, and he wasn't ashamed in the least for running away.
Then he'd come out and seen the damage done by the acid and he'd thanked whatever spirit had given him the strength to run as fast as he did when he was in the jungle, because that very easily could've been him. They'd discovered the bodies of the other two delinquents who'd been trapped outside the drop ship during the storm as well.
'C'mon, babe, what are you doing?' Wade protested.
'Not the first place I'd chose for a vacation,' Tony agreed from behind him.
'Steve!' he tried to call, but his voice came out slurred and hysterical, distorting the word until it sounded like 'Shteeeeeee'.
Okay. Alternative escape plan.
They were near a large body of water and ruins of what was once a house, or several houses. Steve approached a broken-down pile of bricks that looked like they were once part of a wall. He touched it and it instantly crumbled. Wincing, Steve stepped away, wiping his fingers on his pants.
And she loved James, loved him with all of her heart, which was the scariest love of them all.
Some part of their energy had been devoted to talking to Loki, trying to get information from him. This job was mainly Thor and Natasha's. Thor because Loki was his brother, and Natasha because she was the best interrogator in the camp.
'Yeah - I mean, I'm sorry, I really am, but I just can't do relationships.'
They followed him as he led them down a winding staircase, up another corridor and then stopped at a rusted metal door. 'HYDRA built these tunnels many years ago, when they first came down to Earth. They don't use them anymore because they have full access to Mount Weather, and they don't put any guards here. All the better for us,' Loki told them.
Steve shrugged. 'Anything to keep me distracted, yeah.'
He flipped her off. 'Traitor!'
'I said shut up.'
He was standing there, his eyes defiant. 'I fucking did it. I killed him. Pietro.
People hadn't set foot in this place for almost a century.
This was why he loved humans so much.
'I want to know who did it,' Wanda said firmly. Her eyes were dry. Thor was impressed. She was just fifteen yet she was handling the death of her brother remarkably well.
They'd familiarized themselves with the forest around them in the past few days. Steve had made several trips to the hill nearby and then back. No one was willing to venture into the thick jungle towards Mount Weather, but they had to do it at some point, because they would either run out of supplies or freeze in the cold, as winter was fast approaching.
He didn't even mean to talk to Tony. He was in the Quinjet, claiming a corner of the ruined drop ship for himself because he didn't really like the outdoors, when Stark swaggered in, his ridiculous sunglasses still perched on his nose, and had immediately zeroed in on Bruce.
They relaxed by the fire for a bit, just watching the others in the camp. He'd gone around previously, introduced himself, learnt everyone's names. Peter Quill, his girlfriend Gamora, Drax and Mantis were hanging out near the trees, with... a raccoon? Peter Parker was in the corner, tossing bits of deer into Wade Wilson's mouth. Steve Rogers and Bucky Barnes were talking to a kid named Sam Wilson who'd seemed really enthusiastic about birds - far too enthusiastic for Thor to continue having a normal conversation with him.
The words came unbidden. There was a pause and Tony realized what he'd said in his blind panic. He winced, wishing he could take it back, but the damage was done. He waited for what Steve would say.
Steve snuggled down into the warmth of the blanket and breathed out a sigh. “No. It was perfect. Mean as hell, though.”
"Thank you, Tony..."
“Good. Nice to hear from you Tony. Social call or did you need something?”
“Alright sweetheart. We’ll get you there. See what you think after, alright?”
Steve closed his eyes, buried his face against the sheets. “Not really, but I’m guessing you’re going to tell me anyway.”
"Good boy."
"The sass on you." Tony shook his head slowly. "Better watch out, good boys might get rewards, but bad boys..."
I do have to make a note here so that *my* Dom doesn't kill me. Of course in the real world consent should be well established before anything takes place, and kink negotiation should be a serious conversation. That having been said, I hope you enjoyed.
“You. Inside. Need you…”
Steve’s breathing began to come in harsh pants, his hands shaking as he tried to curl up even tighter. He was spiraling again, only this time it was worse. His eyes squeezed shut as he tried to calm his spinning thoughts, but it didn’t work. Steve was going to crash, and there was nothing he could do about it.
“No, Sir.”
Steve felt a slight shifting inside of him, and then a thick viscous liquid began to flow, rapidly beginning to fill his womb. He could feel the delicate tissue stretch beneath the onslaught of heavy liquid, see the outline begin to show beneath his flat stomach. He begged and pleaded behind the gag. Tony’s only response was to drive the vibrations against his sweet spot higher. Steve screamed as he released, body clenching painfully, shifting the plug spearing him open. His omega gland was swollen, throbbing as it was crushed against the unyielding speculum.
“Yes alpha…” Steve writhed as much as he could in the restraints, enjoying the fact that he couldn’t go anywhere. The firm pressure of leather and metal against his skin. He was held in place, exactly where Tony wanted him.
Tony slowly blinked his eyes open, gaze immediately drawn to the man sleeping peacefully in his arms. Steve was curled tightly into his body, and when he was looking for it, Tony could see the signs of stress on the beautiful omega’s face. He let out a quiet breath, tightening his grip just slightly. He’d been so worried about not being enough, that he’d almost destroyed everything. That would end right now. Today. And if Steve rejected him later, after he knew everything, well it was no more than what Tony deserved.
But he did indulge himself a little as the meal went on. Bites of food from the fork were replaced with feeding him by hand. Steve made a soft happy sound, tongue lapping at his fingers, curling around them in the most sinful way. He nuzzled into Tony’s hand, allowed himself to be petted and spoiled. After their food was finished, Tony stayed in the chair, wanting to hold onto this moment with Steve for a little longer. He continued to stroke over his hair for a while, before becoming bolder. He let his fingertips trail down the side of Steve’s neck, and was rewarded with a soft mewling sound. As he continued to trace random patterns over the sensitive skin, he became aware of Steve shifting slightly on his knees, the touch making him struggle to remain still. Tony noticed a spot just below Steve’s ear that seemed slightly swollen to the touch. When he rubbed gently at the area Steve whimpered, shuddering and clenching his hands into fists on his thighs. An interesting reaction. Definitely something to be explored in the future.
“Yes! Yes, please, Tony! I-I need it. Need more.”
"Yes, Tony. Anything you want."
“You’re very welcome.” Tony turned back to Steve, lips curving up into a wicked smile. “Looks like it’s your turn, sweetheart.” His smile grew as Steve responded with a series of low whines. “What’s the matter, Steve? Don’t you want me to touch you?”
Steve blinked his eyes open to stare up at Tony. He took comfort in that floating sensation that came when Tony ordered him and he obeyed. "Yes Tony."
“What the fuck are you doing here?!”
"Just you. Only you."
Steve might be starting to hate Tony Stark.
Tony seated himself near Bruce and Loki, eyes never leaving his submissive. It was a game they had played many times, Tony teasing him until he was close to the edge and desperate, before backing down only to work him up all over again. It was a different experience to have an audience for their play, but before long Steve couldn't focus on anything beyond the unrelenting pleasure and denial.
"Yeah... Thank you, Tony."
True to his word, Tony didn’t want to break him. He enjoyed Steve having interests and a personality. Wanted him to be happy and have friends. And being able to spend time with Bucky again made his new life almost perfect.
“Are… Are you almost done?”
Tony finally surfaced from the back of a cabinet, crowing triumphantly. He walked over to Steve, displaying a smooth metal collar. “Designed it myself. It’s constructed out of nanobots. The entire structure is the locking mechanism. It’s controlled by remote and keyed to the dominant’s fingerprint. Which means once it’s on, there’s no way for you to take it off, and I can adjust it no matter where we are. What do you think?”
“It’s good… Thank you.”
Eventually whimpers and moans turned to sobs, tears soaking the blindfold. Even though he wasn't in the room with him, Steve felt surrounded by Tony's presence. Knew that if he said the word, everything would stop. He gave into the sensations, riding the pleasure until he couldn't take it anymore, before leaning into the pain to draw him away from the edge. Back and forth, over and over again, each sensation rolling over him like a wave, dragging him under.
He was so innocent and trusting. He still didn’t know how completely Tony owned him now. Could control him. Steve’s first instinct seemed to be blaming himself. Using the nanobots he’d injected to keep his cock soft during their game earlier instead of explaining what he’d done to him was a stroke of genius. Tony idly wondered if Steve would ever figure it out. If he did, it still wouldn’t matter. There was no way to reverse the procedures he’d already performed. And with the modifications to Extremis 3.0 Tony had finished the day before, there would be nothing to stop him. He could keep Steve so docile and mindless with lust, that he’d never think to question him.
“Then that’s how I’ll take care of you, precious boy. I will always give you exactly what you need.”
“Thank you, Steve. I knew I could count on you.” Tony stood up, rested a hand on Steve’s shoulder. Could probably feel it trembling beneath his palm. “We’re gonna be okay. You’ll see.”
Steve nodded. “Yes Tony.”
“That’s what I thought you’d say. So I’ll give you a choice. Do you want to rest for the night, or would you rather work off more of the punishments you owe me.”
“Good. Then let’s finish breakfast, and then I’ll take care of you.”
"Okay. Don't worry. I'll take care of you. You get your punishment and then all is forgiven. Alright."
The text was from the only number saved in the phone, identified only as Sir. There was no way of knowing who this was, where it came from, or what they wanted. He shouldn’t. If Bucky was alive he’d kill him for even considering it. “Jarvis?”
"I-I- Umm... Sometimes..."
"I love you, Steve."
Tony’s come no longer burned as it had at first, instead there was a tingling warmth that left him aroused and made him crave more. The plug was pressed back into him after Tony’s cock slipped free, the constant pressure only teasing him more. Every time he shifted on the thick padding of the chair as they ate breakfast, it only made him more aware of the constant need simmering just below the surface.
Steve felt the familiar clench of his muscles, the tension in his body drawing tight. For just a moment he thought that Tony would have mercy on him, let him come from the feel of his mouth on his sensitive hole.
Steve grinned. "Not on your life. But it would be nice to talk to someone who really understands."
Steve groaned long and loud as Tony's cock finally pressed into him, gliding deeper until their bodies were pressed flush against one another. One arm wrapped possessively across Steve's chest, gripping his shoulder, holding him firmly against him, preventing the possibility of movement. He tried anyway, desperate for friction, and was denied. Tony was forcing him to stay still, cock buried deep inside his body, until he allowed otherwise.
Steve woke up the next morning, ankles still restrained, covered in dried come and lube. He stretched with a groan, knocking the vibrator onto the floor. It must have loosened from the wall and slipped out during the night. After rubbing his face briskly in an attempt to wake up, he retrieved the keys from his nightstand and released his ankles before gathering everything together to clean, dry, and put away for next time.
"I always wondered just how far down that blush of yours went. I think I have my answer." He smirked. "Come on gorgeous. I wanna play in my bedroom this time. All sorts of fun toys that I can't wait to try on you in there."
It finally broke, pleasure ripping through his body, tearing screams from his throat. He convulsed in the chains, thrusting back against the bed like he was riding Tony’s cock. Unlike before the serum, when he could still come, it wasn’t a burst of pleasure that immediately ebbed. It went on and on, the vibrator stimulating him to release over and over again, until he was a sobbing wreck on the bed, twitching with overstimulation.
"Of course not. I love torturing my sweet boy, but I still want to take you out, show you off, spoil you with pretty gifts."
"Not a problem. For someone who never remembers to eat, Tony loves food. At this point I probably know all of the best places in New York."
"Made just for you sweetheart. Same with that cage locking your pretty little cock up tight. I might have been hoping for an opportunity like this. A man can dream. And now here you are, all chained up and at my mercy. How does that make you feel?"
"Yes! Please, no more..."
“Then remember, you asked for it.”
“C-could have…?”
"Good boy. Stop now. Pull out the toy, you'll like this. Slick it up for me, and show me how much you need it. Keep the remote nearby, but don't turn it on until I tell you to."
“No sweetheart. You have several slick glands and they’re all in bad shape. But I promise, you can have a break after each one. And then we’re done for the day. We can relax. Maybe watch a movie. Alright?” Steve nodded, his lower lip trembling. It made Tony’s heart clench in his chest. “And if you’re good, I won’t put you back on the board, alright? I have a harness, it’s a lot more comfortable, and I’ll be able to hold you. You keep being a good boy, and you’ll get that instead.”
He took a long hot shower to make himself presentable and wash away the smell of sex, before dressing in casual clothing and going down to the common floor of the tower. Clint and Thor were crushed together on the couch with Natasha perched on the back adding snarky comments to Clint’s explanations of how Mario Kart and video games in general worked. Steve laughed before turning away to head towards the kitchen where the scents of strawberries, bacon, and coffee were calling him.
He throbbed and ached inside the cage, the base wrapped around him too tight to allow for release. Tony knew exactly what he was doing. He drove him mindless with pleasure that never peaked, just kept building, higher and higher until it was unbearable. Steve couldn’t tell if it was pleasure or pain anymore. He just wanted more.
“Just you.”
He cried behind the gag, felt a gentle stroke through his hair. “Go on, sweetheart. You can do it. Work for it.” Steve remained caught, aching and confused. Everything but Tony felt unreal. A sharp smack landed on his exposed ass, pain exploded through him, causing his body to tighten, squeezing around the plug still sitting snugly inside of him. Another strong slap of the paddle, another contraction, and this time he moaned.
Steve shuddered, grinding back against his fingers. "Then that's what you'll get."
(See the end of the chapter for
“Fuck that’s pretty. I could keep you like this all the time, sweetheart. Desperate for me, and oh so sweet.”
Steve followed him obediently back to the bedroom and then indulged himself by carefully untying Tony's bowtie, slipping the jacket from his shoulders, and kneeling at his feet to remove his shoes and socks. Tony watched him with a soft smile, ran a hand through his hair. "What do you want tonight, sweet boy?"
"Yes?"
“You really want that? Wanna go back to the way we used to live? After everything you’ve seen. Everything that I’ve told you. That’s what you’d choose?”
Steve shook his head, confused. “I… Don’t understand that reference.”
(See the end of the chapter for
"Yes, please, Sir, stop. Please..."
“Not yet.” A sharp smack landed over the base of the plug, stealing his breath. “I have some questions to ask you, and I think I’ll get better answers if you’re too distracted to be shy. Isn’t that right, honey?”
Steve cried out, arching off the bed, brought to release by only Tony’s words. He clung to him, sensitive and trembling, as the last aftershocks rippled through his body. Tony gathered him close, pressing soft kisses to his hair. “That’s right, sweetheart. I’ve got you. I’m here. I’m not going anywhere.”
Bruce chimed in over the comms. "Not to mention the pictures from the gala that were plastered all over the news."
"Loki!" Thor took a step towards him, stopping only when more weaponry turned towards him. "Brother, are you well?"
With that Tony gracefully stepped past her and led Steve into the museum. He greeted several people politely as they passed and snagged two glasses of champagne off the tray of a passing waiter. Handing one to Steve, Tony proceeded to escort him through the art on display. Tony was a fascinating companion telling him stories about why he had chosen specific artists for his collection, Pepper's trials tracking down certain pieces, the lengths they had to go to over a particular painting that had gotten stuck in customs.
And that’s the end! I hope everyone enjoyed it. Thanks once again for the fabulous art by VeroCaroline, I love it! And if you haven’t seen it yet, please go check it out! I shall see you in the next story.
“You delivered the first box to the common floor on purpose. And running into me in the elevator. That wasn’t a coincidence either, was it?”
"Yes, thank you Jarvis. How about something from that Korean place Pepper likes so much?"
Steve swallowed again. "Yes Tony. I will."
His thrusts gained speed and strength, pounding into Bucky’s body. When Bucky came, he screamed the only word that mattered before collapsing down onto the bed, feeling Tony’s come flood into him as the man rode him down to the mattress, teeth sinking into the side of his neck. Claiming him. Owning him. Bucky felt like he was floating, eyes too heavy to open. He could hear Tony moving around him, the sound of the vibrations stopping and Steve’s gentle sigh of relief.
“Good omega.”
A moment later Bucky was stepping in close, wrapping him in a tight hug. Steve buried his face against a wide shoulder, the familiar presence enough to bring tears to his eyes. “Hey now. It’s okay, Stevie. You’re okay.”
"Alright babydoll. Anything you want." Tony slid an arm under his legs, the other wrapped around his back, and stood with Steve in his arms, carrying him to the bedroom. "Such a sweet little thing I found myself tonight. And you're going to be so good for me, aren't you? Let me do whatever I want to you. Not that a tiny thing like you could stop me, isn't that right?"
it’s so good to hear him outside of Steve’s dreams again.
crazy the other half.  He always had so much love to give too.  And he was big on second chances.  He’d have pulled you right in and took over your entire life in the process just like he did mine.”
This time Steve gets to watch as the anger eventually fades, as Tony reads Bucky’s files and sees the suffering he went through.
The look he turns in Bucky’s direction is soft and sweet.
And all Steve can do is watch him go.
mean it.
“I’ll find you,” Steve promises like he already has a million times before.  “I’ll get you out, bring you home.  I’ll do it right this time.”
into Tony’s ears he knows, without a shadow of a doubt, that he means it.
“I love you,” Steve tells him. “You’re my best friend, my brother.”
“Don’t worry,” Steve soothes her softly as he reaches up to pat her hair in one part sympathy and one part comfort.  “You’ll see him soon.”
But, for now, Steve has a plan, a
All of that, and more, is what Steve intends to give to him when the time is right.
Two tranquilizer darts hit the younger him directly in the chest.
Steve loves him, loves him soul deep and in every bone and bit of himself, but he’s never been
whenever he thinks no one is looking.
This time Steve gets it
Steve and Tony and Bucky as one unit, Rhodes and the team at their backs, the people united behind their heroes.
“I miss him.”  The words aren’t enough, don’t come even close to describing what Steve’s feeling at the moment, the way he’s been bleeding out inside since the second Tony stood his ground and saved the entire universe.  “I lost him a long time ago and that was my fault but I just … even if he wasn’t mine anymore at least he was still …”
It takes every inch of control Steve can scrape together not to kiss Tony as soon as he sees him face to face again, to not reach out and pull him close and never let him go again.
“Now good?  Since I’m actually already outside the Tower,” Steve admits.  “But only if that’s okay.”
Instead there’s Steve and Tony at the helm together, there’s Bucky watching their sixes and the rest of the team closing ranks.
But, just like Steve had told Bucky in the future that Steve will make sure never happens, it’s obvious that Tony and Bucky like each other.
She’s even younger looking than he remembers somehow.
Every single bit of him wants to head in that direction immediately.  Wants to go there, to the one place that had felt like home to him after waking up from the ice.
A handful of hours later he finds himself staring up at the Tower, heart pounding, as he calls Tony.
But, just as Steve had known his younger self would, he still steps forward into the apartment, still walks straight towards what can only be some kind of threat.
?” Tony asks, more than a bit incredulous.
“Yeah, punk, I’m sure.” Bucky shrugs just a bit, something soft and melancholy in his face.  “I’m tired Steve.  I don’t … I don’t think I’ve got the kind of fight left in me that you’re gonna need where you’re going.  I think I’d like to rest a while.”
Bucky had been more than happy to help him pack, to help him pick and choose what he’d need, what would make stealth and infiltration and anything else he might not be able to punch his way through work.
Slides right into making coffee in the mornings and sketching in the labs in the afternoons and watching movies on the penthouse couch in the evenings.
.  “Might wanna watch out though.  Guy like Stark, all fierce and bright like you said he is?  Might try to steal your fella if you give me a half a chance.  Soldier always did like pretty, deadly things.”
The stars should whisper about Tony.  All the worlds should know.
A heartbeat.
“I know you will,” Bucky agrees before he grins, bright and cocky in a way Steve hasn’t seen in
Pepper puts the arc reactor on a wreath of flowers and pushes them out into the water.
“Hey,” Steve says again, an honest smile stretching wide across his face.  “It’s really good to see you again Tony.”
And he knows
, to follow.  Has a list of things he can and will actually do to protect Tony and, ultimately, everyone else.
He’d learned it when Rhodes had herded him up against one of the walls in the Tower, the muzzle of his pistol pressing against Steve’s temple and the inscription on it shining bright and silver on the side in what Steve had recognized as Tony’s surprisingly elegant scrawl.
Steve never wants to see that look on his face again.
Steve likes that, thinks it's fitting.
Steve’s thought about killing himself before but, well, he does have to admit that doing it this way is more than a bit weird even after everything else he’s seen and done.
“Speak and possibly be heard,” Tony answers.
This time when Tony finds out the truth about Howard and Maria's deaths Steve is there with him, is there to apologize for the tragedy of it all, to wrap his arms around Tony and hold him close in comfort.
This time they talk and discuss and make decisions together.
“Is there some kind of issue I need to know about Cap-Attack?” Tony asks, surprise and a light sort of suspicion obvious in his tone.
Doesn’t get to touch him one last time.
This time they stop him.
There’s something dark and terrible in Rhodes’ eyes then.  Something aching and yawning and filled with teeth.
Tony tells Steve about his nightmares after the Invasion, about the anxiety it took so long to begin to get under control.
This time he gets to sit there on that couch and watch Bucky make Tony shake and sigh and
