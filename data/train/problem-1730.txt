Molly snorts, “I’m sure you would,” she answers just as she notices Sherlock walking back onto the dancefloor with his hand raised in the air, carrying some kind of cocktail while his other hand tugs John Watson into the throng of people surrounding them.
John frowned, “I wanted to tell you...” He shook his head and started over, “Just... you were right about me, about all of it. I just didn't want to hear it, especially not from you...” He stopped and scratched at the back of his head as he looked to the ceiling, “and... Ah... uhm...” He coughed, “God this is harder than I thought it would be...”
“Are these...?”
“Irene Adler. Best man.” She winked.
“Hey!” Came Harry's voice, “Still up?”
Once he’s gone, Sherlock and John fall back into a slightly awkward silence. Finally, Sherlock clears his throat softly and says, “You shouldn’t encourage him,”
John continues to kiss Sherlock over and over, he presses his lips to his mouth, his cheek, his neck and back to his mouth again. “Sherlock!” He whispers, “Sherlock, I’m so sorry. Sherlock, I’m such an idiot. Oh fuck Sherlock,” he cries as the kiss just grows more and more heated. John feels Sherlock’s tongue against his lips and sucks it into his mouth with a groan. Sherlock responds with a pleased moan of his own and John decides to better position himself over Sherlock. He lifts a leg around Sherlock’s waist until he’s sitting over him and grinds down. Sherlock grabs hold of his back with a growl and arches against him while they continue to suck and lick into each other’s mouths. John suddenly finds himself thrusting a still clothed erection slowly against Sherlock’s now also evident tented pyjamas while they kiss and he moans again.
Mary still didn't take her eyes off his sister. “You want to go get a drink?” She asked her.
John raises a brow, “I - Well, yeah I’m
Eurus had beamed like an innocent child, more than happy to play some music with her older brother. They’d played for hours that day, until suddenly tears had begun to stream from her eyes. Eurus had cried and cried and cried, finally telling Sherlock that she was tired and needed to rest. Sherlock had raised a hand to the glass in front of them, beckoning her to come close for their goodbye ritual. She had pressed her hand to the glass as usual and her forehead as well waiting for Sherlock to kiss the glass between them in a goodbye. He did so, with a slight sadness filling him in sympathy for his confused little sister.
“Oh, yes you can, a good writer can.” Sherlock said motioning for the bartender to pour them another shot.
YOU!” He turned his face back to the road, with Sherlock's face almost touching the steering wheel while John held his shirt tight in his grip as they made a sharp turn.
John blinks at him. Does Sherlock really want them to stay? He definitely looks genuinely distraught. “Um... not if you don’t want us to...?”
“Oh come on, John. You know you're curious. Besides... Could be fun.” Sherlock gave him a backwards glance as they approached the bike.
Sherlock’s sad smile is back, confirming John's thoughts, “Not much.” He admits. “But it’s not like I can openly admit my feelings.”
“...yeah...er...” Mary flicked an apologetic look in Archie's direction, “Look, John, Harry and I were going to go watch Archie's talent show, if you'd like to join us.”
to h–”
, and that is all they will ever
Sherlock leans back in his seat again with an eye-roll, “How many times?” He mutters, then coming forward again hisses, “I told you the texts between her and I have never meant anything- at least not in the way you think.” He rubs a hand tiredly over his face and continues, “She’s a lesbian, John, and I’m pretty sure you know that since she
“We can’t both be drunk,” Sherlock speaks loudly, leaning towards John so that he can hear him.
“Any chance we could maybe use your mobile?” John asked the bartender politely from where he had moved to stand beside Sherlock.
“John, I would let go of me now!” Sherlock shouted, panicking more obviously now as the car made a loud screeching noise.
John nods, “Yes, and I’d better get back to Sherlock.” Both men return to the restaurant, John holding the door open for Josh as he allows the man to walk back in. They share a last polite exchange and John returns to the table, where he finds Sherlock spoon feeding Rosie some soft fruits and cereal and a plate of a freshly laid out full English breakfast in both his and John’s place.
Whoa... some kind of plot is peeking through. Who knew?
“Couldn't be happier.” John answered quickly, “She's my kid sister. I taught her how to tell time, how to ride a bike, how to catch fish on an early sunday morning... I practically raised her.” John said, before catching himself as he watched Sherlock walk into the living room “Oh, shit! No, don't print that it would... it would kill our mother.”
Sherlock tosses his head back in laughter - “It’s in the playlist, but I’m prepared to skip it if it comes on. I don’t think Rosie should hear it just yet.”
John rolled his eyes and stared at Mary while she stood at the bar taking a swig of beer.
Sherlock lies back on his couch, still in a suit, his coat hanging by the door.
“Tough break this week, Mr. Holmes,” One of the other celebrities backstage comments. His name is Dorian. He’s a pretty young aristocrat famous for his sweet tragic romance songs, usually composed with a piano accompaniment, which he plays himself. He doesn’t look a day over twenty-three, with his smooth skin, bright blue eyes, curled blonde hair, and rose-petal lips. He’s a gorgeous innocent looking youth that Irene would, under other circumstances, love to defile, if she wasn’t so sure the boy is smitten with Sherlock. And if he weren’t almost half her age, obviously. Sherlock, unlike Irene, doesn't seem to have noticed Dorian's little crush, or if he has, he is clearly not interested.
had he called if he wasn't going to help?!
John barged his way into the flat impatiently. He did not have the time nor the patience for Harry's lies today.
Now for you author note:
Sherlock can almost see John’s facial expression as he reads John’s response,
“Greg!” Sally insists, pressing the phone firmly back at him just as he attempts to return it “trust me, you
“I don't think so, Greg.” Anthea answered him.
Sherlock scowls at her, his blush beginning to recede, “Rude,” he comments then, his voice treacherously unsure he continues, “I suppose I should just say... goodnight?”
“Alright Redbeard, enough slobbering on my doctors.” Mary stuck her head in the office and smiled at both Irene and John.
John struggles to see through the moving crowd and flickering colourful streams of light. Finally, John spots him. He’s almost directly in what John would estimate to be the middle of the dancefloor, moving to the thrumming rhythm of the song that’s been mixed to suit the pulsing energy of the party. All at once John realizes that the image of Sherlock dancing in real life (
John replies cheekily.
Sherlock hums distractedly as he taps his finger on the screen to have a look at the video John has sent him. “I suppose I should be grateful you didn’t text him back,” he mumbles.
“I don't know...” John mock-mused, “I must have suppressed the memory of
Sherlock laughed loudly, “That we are,” He said his eyes crinkling with a genuine smile.
), answered as Mary's mobile rang.
“John is two feet tall,” Lestrade argues, interrupting Sherlock.
That day John had woken up and put on his twenty-eight tux, and he went to a wedding where no one asked him to calm down the groom, or fold a place card, or to hold their jacket while they vomited into a toilet. Everything was perfect, but John wouldn't have cared if it hadn't been. The only thing that mattered to him was that in that moment, Sherlock was looking at him the way he'd always hoped.
“John can join you,” Sherlock interrupts Algernon.
“Mary, let me just explain,” He began as he walked into her office, “I had no idea what he was writing,”
John looked down at the floor as Harry hugged him tight and for the first time in a while he willingly thought of him, of Sherlock.
Sherlock tsk’s, “Shut up and get the condoms,” he says, and adds “And the lube while you’re at it.”
Dimock stared at them, “I don't.”
Mrs. Laurinston smiled at Sherlock and John and began to tell them all that she knew, explaining that she had been asleep when her neighbour had woken her by banging on the door screaming. When she'd looked outside there was the body, lying face-down in her rose bushes. She told them she had sent the neighbour to get help because the phones weren't working.
“Yep,” John states, around a mouthful of tomato, “Irene is definitely a crazy person.”
“Parts?” John asked, still in slight shock.
this came out a little later than I wanted it too. Why? Because it ended up being the equivalent of me writing three chapters into one epilogue. Apparently I had a lot more to write on this story than I thought. Forgive me for the late post, enjoy the final ending.
Harry giggled again, knowing full well what Len had wanted to say. That's when John saw her little white hat, pinned to her hair with clips, one beautiful pink flower on the side. Pink like the roses decorating the entire church and like the dresses of the bridesmaids he and his mother had seen clamouring around the limousine where the bride waited to make her entrance. Pink like Len's pocket square! Standing there, looking at Harry's flower and his cousin in distress, John got a rather brilliant idea.
But only for a little while. I'm still in school and the program I decided to take is very content-heavy so I haven't had much time to write. Also depression. YAY! Anywayyy on that light happy note:
Suddenly, a dog barked out in the hallway and pushed his way in through the door. “Redbeard! Hi there, fellow, how are you today?” John asked the young service dog in training. John fussed over him and scratched just behind his ears.
For now, I ask you to enjoy the updates, again, while you can. Hopefully I can finish this before school starts.
Sherlock groans something incoherent.
“What things?” John asked, “What few things pan out, exactly?” He felt his teeth grinding and tried his best not to seem upset in front of his mother. Harry was saved from answering him, though as her phone began to ring. She stood quickly and rushed to tear it out of her bag, a huge grin on her face as she saw the called ID. “Mary!” She mouthed and ran into the other room to answer.
” Sherlock giggled and started over, “My partner
John smiled in fond memory, “Night club wedding.” He remembered attempting to close the jacket over the sheer black top which left absolutely nothing to he imagination and using anything he could to cover his crotch while the photos were taken. Sherlock almost chocked as he hid his flush of lust when John came out wearing it by pretending to laugh hysterically just so he wouldn't have to look for too long. He made sure he had a good photo first.
Also, that last bit, originally Jane says "sexy" but I couldn't picture Sherlock saying 'sexy' so many times so I wrote "attractive"... I dunno. I still think it's funny.
She walked over to the hall bathroom and picked up a pair of earrings, putting each on as she spoke, “Thank you for coming down on such short notice... I had intended to attend this new benefit with... but... well, yes. I guess I do need you to help me find a date to these things sometimes, don't I?”
John’s girlfriend stands irritably as she notices the slight pause, “You see? He’s not even here and you’re paying more attention to him!”
, should we really be–” John asked, standing now and looking at Sherlock. He was extremely confused. What the hell?
“Sherrrrrlock.” He corrects, knowing she won’t say it right for another few months yet, but encouraging her to try anyway. She simply giggles and grabs his face, requesting an Eskimo kiss, and Sherlock - unable to resist, complies.
John chuckles at his friend’s frankly ridiculous response, “Never let her hear you say any of that.”
Irene speaks next as the video cuts to them sitting in 221b, “Yes, I was dangerously close to dragging you to a girl’s spa day yesterday,”
Anyway I’m going to go now because if I keep talking to myself people are going to think I’m crazy. I hope you enjoyed the story. :)
, not since –
“It’s alright, Sherlock,” John says, suddenly feeling guilty that it’s Sherlock who is feeding his baby and not him, “I’ll do that, you should get to yours before it gets cold.”
“You two are like Batman and Robin, you are. Heard you caught the killer. Shame about him, Mrs. Carter's brother.” The girl added.
“How do you feel about it?” John clarifies.
John watched as the man waited for Sherlock to enter the car in the driver's side, then got in after him, the torchlight barely visible now as they were inside the car. Nothing seemed to be happening. John walked around carefully and approached the car slowly and as quietly as he could from behind the rock. He crouched low so he wouldn't be seen through the windows. He got as close to the passenger's side where he'd seen the captor as he possibly could and tried to listen.
Suddenly the door slammed open and lightning flashed through the window of the bar. A woman came in from the rain, screaming, “She's dead! She's dead! She's out there and she's dead!” The pub went silent. For a second only the music was heard in the background along with the rain. The woman fell to her knees at the door and broke down into tears.
John makes his way to 221 Baker Street in the late afternoon to pick up Rosie from Mrs. Hudson’s. He worries his lip in thought as he sits on the tube on his way there. He wonders if Sherlock would be alright with him coming up to see him once he’s gotten Rosie. He’s worried about him. Seeing Eurus always makes him sulk and besides that, John still hasn’t spoken to Sherlock about his crankiness during the case. Although -now that he thinks about it- perhaps Sherlock had been cranky because he’d wanted to spend time with his boyfriend, and John had just invited himself along on the case. Perhaps Sherlock had meant to invite the other man instead.
“You know, the thing that I like about Harriet is that there's no –and pardon the word –bullshit. She's not afraid to be herself, and I love that in a woman.”
Harry gestured subtly for John to decline.
It works. Irene frowns, “Excuse me? Wait - are you telling me that all this time —?”
“Hi,” The deep and melodious voice that could belong to none other than the annoyingly handsome William greeted, “How are you?” He asked, “Was that note a bit much?”
“Yeah, no... I'm... good... How do I look?” She asked.
“We'll just have to go have a talk with her, I suppose.” Dimock said, “And we should check Jenny's room. See if she left anything.”
“Yes.” Irene deadpans.
“You ready, Sherlock?” Molly asked him, smiling sweetly as Sherlock fixed his hair in the mirror again.
Irene put on her sunglasses and smirked, “If you say so. Hold on tight Johnny this is not going to be a slow ride!” She backed out of her parking spot in under a second and quickly merged them into traffic, swerving this way and that as she floored it.
“–John!” Sherlock finally found his voice, “No! John stay on him. I'm fine, I'm completely fine. The bullet missed. I-it hit the mirror!”
More mutual pining
Molly smiles nervously feeling her stomach do a funny little flip, “Um, hi,” she says, pulling a strand of hair out of her face and looking in Sherlock’s direction awkwardly in a plea for help.
At first, Sherlock ignores it and they continue to move against each other, the heat of the moment over powering them. The phone doesn’t stop ringing, however, and eventually Sherlock pats his partner’s thigh in irritation as he reaches towards his phone, “Hang on.” He growls. Sherlock picks up the obnoxious little machine and focuses on the name displayed on the screen. He flops forward on the desk and sighs in defeat as he answers the call while his partner behind him rolls his eyes in annoyance.
That doesn’t reassure John, but he decides not to comment anyway, walking up closer to the bouncer just as Greg appears behind the man and taps his shoulder to hand him a card and gesture about John. The bouncer nods in agreement as John approaches and waves him in after removing the rope belt from his path. As John meets with Greg and gives him a hug in greeting, he takes in the detective’s own appearance. Apparently he’d chosen a slightly more youthful look than John. He wore a black leather jacket, a light grey t-shirt, a simple silver necklace, and light blue jeans. Despite his age, the outfit suited him. Greg was pretty good at hiding his years even with the salt-and-pepper hair.
The man’s lips tilt in a bemused look, “You’ve checked your phone at least five times since this couple started their jive,” he comments, “and you keep looking about nervously… conclusion, you’re waiting on someone.”
John had been excited, as usual, (and he’d thought Sherlock had been too) to go off on a long case together. He’d hoped that it would feel like the good old days - them dashing about with the blood pumping through their veins with the rush of adventure - and it had, for a moment felt like that. Sherlock had certainly seemed excited when he’d talked to John about the case in the beginning as well, but as the case had gone on, Sherlock had grown more and more... well, irritable was the only word for it. Anything John did had seemed to set him off. John had grown a bit annoyed by the end of the trip and when the case was finally over they had both been a bit distant from each other. Sherlock had twitched and flinched away from him when John had tried to talk to him on the way back, attempting to place a hand on his friend’s shoulder.
Sherlock begs, horrified, then adds,
know all of
“Let's call it a new version of my brother's and my favourite game, 'deductions'. Usually, Mycroft and I pick an item belonging to someone and we deduce what we find about the person. But, because it's just you and I here, we'll play it differently. You are going to give me an item of yours and I'm going to use it to guess why you killed Ms. Jennifer Wilson based on what I learn from you using this item.”
The waiter scribbles it down and looks to Sherlock who adds, “And I’ll have the lemon chicken piccata with the braised vegetables—”
Irene just kept talking “I can't believe it. I cannot believe it, there is no one out there that won't fall for her little charms, even a goody-two-shoes like Mary, she's become hypnotized by her voodoo and has lost her mind. You can't plan your sister's wedding to the woman you love, it's sick!”
“Yeah, brov, you look pretty great.” Gary concurred.
“We're actually about to go. Heading down to an antique store pick out some linens,” John added.
John frowned as he listened to the sounds coming from the inside of the flat. Someone seemed to be doing the hoovering. Just then he heard the familiar voice of a little boy humming what sounded like Tchaikovsky. John tried to look around Harry's head, his expression now very suspicious. Harry moved to cover his eyesight, nervous grin still plastered on her face. “Harry, what is that? Who's in there?” John asked his sister, “Mary's in Cardiff, Harry, who's in here?”
John wondered why Sherlock was trying to scare everyone, but said nothing.
Harry and Mary [lololol it Rhymes!] start seeing each other. Angst happens.
It was a few moments before John realized, as he walked over to the bar to grab another beer, that he couldn't spot Sherlock anywhere. As he approached the bar he noticed one of the stools, the one which previously had Sherlock's Belstaff wrapped around it, was tipped over, the coat and scarf gone. He found the keys to the motorcycle on the ground next to them. John grabbed them, and in a panic did another scan of the room. Nope, no Sherlock.
“I figured,” John replies, taking a sip of his… cola (probably??) “So, how are we going to find him in this lot, genius?” He asks.
The four eyes that look at Molly imploringly are almost too much to handle.
Sherlock sighs quietly, “Yesli vy nastaivayete,” he mutters.
Seeing her lose her patience like this makes Sherlock finally relent. An upset Eurus is never a good thing. “It’s not the quantity that matters, and the quality is... fine. I am beginning to hypothesize, however, that there would be a significant increase in quality of an encounter dependent on my feelings about the subject.”
fucking stop.” Sherlock commanded.
“Oh please, this is so typical of you Harry!” John finally stormed, “You're not taking any responsibility for the shit that you've done! Harry you lied to Mary, not me! You manipulated–” but Harry glared at John as he advanced on her and picked up a bottle of air freshener, preparing to spray it at John's face, “Put down the bottle! Harriet, put down the bottle!” He struggled with it trying to hide his face as he grabbed her, not wanting to use too much force until he was able to pry it out of her hands. She screeched and bit him to make him let go of her wrist, “God-dammit Harry!” and she squirmed out of his reach, dashing as she reached for another item to throw at him, John stopped her and turned her round, grabbing both her wrists and holding her as she yanked back, trying, but failing miserably to escape his grip, “Did you even love her?” He asked, “Or was it just convenient?”
“If you lose, you take the pill I choose.”
“It’s fine John,” She sighs as she goes and calls to him when she gets to the front door, “I’ll be home late tonight, by the way. Girls and I are doing our book club tonight because Jenny’s daughter has a school play on our usual night.”
Ribbons of semen suddenly splash out onto John's belly and coat his hand with the slick white liquid. Sherlock has arched his back completely, scratching at John's back with blunt yet sharp fingernails. He's crying out in a loud exhale as his body shivers and spasms with his release. John shudders at the site of Sherlock's face - those gorgeous eyes open wide in an expression of surprise and his mouth open in an "Oh!"
Again, not particularly in that order. ;)
“Right, right, table five then.”
“Oh!” Harry turned to an extremely handsome man behind her who was smiling and dragging a huge suitcase that suspiciously enough matched perfectly with Harry's bag. “I always meet the
John lets himself in to 221 Baker Street with an air of determination. He has a short chat with Mrs. Hudson about her day with Rosie and after a few minutes decides to head upstairs. ‘Enough stalling, Watson,’ He thinks.
“Sounds good, sure.” The driver agreed almost instantly as they drove off.
where that again without the situation being terribly offensive?” Sherlock asked, snapping one more photo.
Sherlock continued his smirking and called out, “Any more weddings on the horizon, then Doctor Watson?”
The other catches them easily but answers in disbelief, “What, like right now? And just what am I supposed to do with
,” Sherlock reiterates, then indignant,  “And I seem to recall you asking
Sherlock nodded even though John was no longer looking at him and was instead engrossed in the task of picking up a few ties.
They arrive back at 221B safe and sound. Since Sherlock had opted to leave his wine glass mostly untouched and had opted for water, he had driven them back home as well. The two men had chatted amiably the whole way and Rosie had interjected with her own observations from time to time.
sloppy work! The only things you should be saying to me right now are your apologies. Now get out of my office and get back to work before I have you removed. I am
John gave him an a soft smile and explained, “Look, I don't care if someone wants me to wear a funny outfit. Its their special day, not mine.”
the John Watson I'm looking for. Now, come dance.”
“Dadah!” Rosie whispers, holding onto the wall near the loo for leverage, “come!” She beckons (although it sounds more like “Tum!”) in the most adorably annoyed tone.
“It's true.” Jim's voice sounded over the intercom. John had to stop the little wretch from hacking the intercom and listening in on his conversations. In the meantime he settled for giving Irene an accusing look. Irene just shrugged.
“So what'd you find?” Carter asked sounding considerably more sober, when the men sat at the table with him.
“You're famous.” The girl smiled in explanation.
“That’s the beauty of a
my boyfriend!” Sherlock calls after him, which only makes Greg laugh and wave at them without turning around.
There's also a version of sexy dancing after the bowie song. But I was like, “no boys, we're in the middle of a case so... no!” and they were all “But B! We want to be sexy with each other!” and i was all, “No, boys, focus dammit!" so... no sexy dancing. it was getting too disruptive. no. I can add it later if you guys want though. I dunno. ask me. I might. I didn't like it. It wasn't really funny. And I like the funny shenanigans more. Anyways thanks for sticking with me through this horrid thing.
Rosie grins innocently and answers, “Elfant?” Referring to her stuffed pink and very inanimate friend.
Sherlock pulls away at last to laugh, “Well it was a bad one! You should have stopped me sooner!”  He shouts, eyes crinkling in mirth.
,” Sherlock thinks.
“John, you know what this is, you've read the papers.” Sherlock told him.
John peruses through a few articles, reading up on the competition and seeing a list of celebrity names - some of which he vaguely recognizes, and others which mean nothing to him. He learns a bit about how the show is judged and how it’s structured, going down a slight rabbit hole into a world of bedazzled sparkly dance fanatics until Sherlock’s name appears in his trip again and he remembers why he was looking up articles about Strictly Come Dancing in the first place. John goes back to his original search and looks over the various links provided under Sherlock’s name in combination with the show title. Many of the links seem to lead to forums on fan blogs talking about Sherlock being on the show. John doesn’t bother with them and finally elects to click on the first video link he finds on youtube, which has a title that reads, “Dancing Detective Decimates the competition with the Cha-Cha” with the descriptor: “Sherlock Holmes on Strictly Come Dancing”. The link opens up a new tab where the video buffers for a few seconds before a blonde woman, presumably the presenter of the show introduces,
John doesn’t answer him.
John felt it then, the warmth in his chest as his balls tightened just as Sherlock pulled him forward and kissed into his mouth painfully and messily, “John I'm close, I'm so
“You ready?” Molly asks Sherlock backstage as another of the competition’s couples dances on the stage, performing a rather sloppy yet passionate cha-cha.
“I don’t know if I like it with this dress.”
know it.”
John is almost amused at Sherlock’s stuttering. The man is so rarely speechless. The only other time he’d been like that had been when John had asked him to be his best man, except now, of course, Sherlock has a sort of combined pleased-confused-scared expression on his face that John can’t quite figure out.
Mary finally pulled away looking at him with a confused expression, one he was sure he was returning.
“Well, not really,” the old woman began, “I don't usually go that far into town because of my ailing hip and back. My son, he brings me my shopping and all that. Sometimes Mrs. Carter does as well, with her older brother, whenever he's in town. She's a nice girl, that Mrs. Carter... and I think Mr. Carter is right. She wouldn't do a thing like that. I've never seen her hurt so much as a fly. My son did tell me, though that he'd heard a rumour at the pub that the real reason Miss Wilson was here was because she'd had a domestic with her boyfriend. We suspect she was really just looking for a place to stay while she forgot about him, but I can't really say for sure.”
John stood in the tailor's shop inspecting himself in the grand three-way mirror as the tailor, Harry (strange coincidence, that) Hart and his assistant, Gary considered the fit. John was leaning heavily on his cane, but despite that, he found that he appreciated the reflection of the elegant man in front of him. His tux was made up of finely tailored classic black suit jacket with rounded silk lapels, a crisp white white shirt, a black bow tie and a pair of simple, yet nicely fitting black slacks. The ensemble fit him rather nicely, so well, in fact, John hardly paid any attention to his ailment. He felt a bit like James Bond, actually.
“This is Iris,” She answers in her false accent, “Ah the crew is here? Yes, of course, we’ll just come down to get you. Do you mind turning the cameras off for a moment while we come down? Our dear friend is here with a child and the parent has not consented to have them on the show. Yes, we’re sorry we forgot that we had invited her. No. No, the child must remain out of video along with our friend. Yes. Thank you.” Irene hangs up the phone, “They’ve agreed to shut the cameras down, but I think we should sneak the little darling out along with Molly through Mrs. Hudson’s back door.”
“What were you saying?” He asked instead, daring William to say something rude.
John ducked his head, blushing. Irene still had her mouth open like a gaping fish.
Dorian’s face lights up in excitement and he asks flirtatiously, “Are you going to deduce me, Mr. Holmes?” He grins mischievously and sits up to face Sherlock at a better angle, “Go ahead, I’m an open book,” he gestures with his arms to emphasize his point. “Though I can’t think what you can deduce about me that you probably haven’t already figured out,” he adds.
Mycroft raised his head to stare at John,
“What? I wasn't going to come to work in my groomsman suit!”
“Well hello, gorgeous.” The man greets Sherlock when he arrives. He’s slightly shorter than Sherlock and Sherlock can see that the man’s photos certainly didn’t do that body any justice. He is even better-looking in person. Mid-forties by the look of him, but still quite the specimen. Or maybe Sherlock is just really desperate for it. Without further thought Sherlock grabs him by the collar, pulls him inside and
“...Why?” John asked, suspicious.
She’s all settled in and about to pop a buttery kernel into her mouth when she notices something on telly that has
“That's the word.”
John dashed out of the reception and into the warm clear night carrying his large suit bag. He really didn't want to be late and he hoped to whatever god was out there that he would get a ride out of here soon.
Billy.” Sherlock pauses, “I love them as my
“Yes, John I think she'll take one look at our new advertisements and realize she's madly in love with you, take you into her office and have you for hours and hours until you beg for mercy twice.”
him.” He made an angry strangling gesture with his hands.
John, I know it's why you did everything you did. It's why you became a doctor and why you joined the army and that's noble and all that but look... look what it's done to you... I know that I might seem selfish and entitled and, and, and...
Sherlock looks about to argue, but John interrupts him. Knowing that they’ll just end up eating for free anyway, or that Angelo will find a way to make up for the payment by plying them with other free and expensive items off-menu, he says, placing a hand casually on Sherlock’s to silence him, “It’s fine, Angelo, thank you very much,”
“Archie, this is John's sister.” Mary introuced them.
Sherlock grins, “What? She’s helping. Besides, I’m not going to deny a baby food.”
“Oh!” The Mousy girl interrupted, “You're John! From his article!”
John gives Sherlock a re-assuring grin, “Yeah, Sherlock. We’re good.”
OH! The benny and the jets. that's the 27 dresses easter egg! It made a cameo just now at the end. LOL. I had to! *~ B-b-b-benny and the jets. BENNY!
Sherlock doesn’t say anything. In reply he wraps an arm around the man and strokes his hair softly. Soon they are both fast asleep, snoring softly into the couch. Sherlock’s sure his back will hurt if the man decides to stay till morning - they’ll both be in pain for sure, seeing as the couch is not a particularly great place for either of them to fall asleep, let alone both, but he doesn’t have the heart to tell him to go away quite yet, and if he’s being honest, he kind of wants him to stay, just for tonight, just so he can feel this and enjoy the sweet embrace of a lover, even if he might never feel it again with another (or with the one he really wants).
“Oi!” John laughs, taking a hold of it, “What are you doing?”
“I said '
“Really?” Anthea did not look convinced. “As great as your last great idea? An exposé on two hundred and forty types of tobacco ash and how to use the knowledge to find out if people's partners who smoke are either planning to murder them or are having an affair?”
John smiles at him and shouts, as Jack makes his way over (mostly to annoy Dorian), “Kick his arse, Jack!”
’ Sherlock texts, choosing to ignore the week-old congratulatory text and consequent one which said
John looked at the screen as the picture shifter to one of Mary and two young students in a lab, and then to one of harriet screaming at cousin Malcolm, her hand raised in a fist as John and his mother held her back. These were followed by a photograph of Harry looking displeased as she held a crying baby, and one of Harry pushing Redbeard back as he attempted to lick her.
Rosie looks up at John curiously at that and seems to open her mouth to say something but Sherlock speaks quickly, interrupting her, “Oh, right, yes. That makes sense. Yes, Watson, I would love to dance with you again, but later if that’s okay,” he says to the child and winks at her with a slightly funny looking grin on his face.
John frowns at the boy and Sherlock can see in the stiffness of his posture that he’s doing his best not to glare at him. His attempt at a grin seems to fail him, looking feral rather than friendly as he replies, “Sherlock can be very persuasive when he wants to be.”
Two photos of very cheerful female babies followed his words. One subtitled with Harry's name and the next with Mary's. The room giggled and “awww”'ed again.
Sherlock entered the mostly empty dining area and caught a glimpse of Mary and John sitting at a table together. He was relieved they were still here and immediately started making his way toward them. As he approached he caught the tail end of a conversation,
” This could. Sherlock is making an absolute fool of himself hoping, after years of evidence, that John would change his mind about being with Sherlock. The truth is, Sherlock knows exactly where he stands with John. He just keeps kidding himself into thinking that John will ever decide to… but he won’t. He never has done in the past. Why would he change now? John has a woman. He lives with her. He shares his life with her and is intimate with her in a way that he will never allow himself to share with Sherlock despite every opportunity that Sherlock has served him up on a silver platter to take. And now, this closeness together – this dance that should be sensual and seductive. God, it feels like a farce. It feels empty and Sherlock’s heart squeezes in his chest achingly. Piece by piece it’s broken while John moves against him instead of with him.
is this Josh guy? And why is he so familiar.
Sherlock stares at her. “Upset? I’m not upset.”
His mother was behind the register sorting out some small knick-knacks. “Oh hullo, love, how are you today?” She responded and left the things in order to come round to give John a hug. Behind him the bell of the shop rang again and in walked Harry. Their mother's eyes lit up in surprise. “Oh! Harriet!” She let go of John and rushed to hug her. John smiled at them both. “Surprise!” He laughed.
Sherlock rolled his eyes, “You told me he seemed to spend more time with her than anyone. Just because it's
“To you it's just another casserole dish, to Harry it's the pot she's going to cook mum's christmas roast in.” John explained.
William gave him a knowing look. John looked from side to side. “...Never, not once,” he conceded.
“I see, thank you Mrs. Laurinston,” DI Carter had slurred after the old woman finished her story, “Look, Dimock, I'm not sure I'm in the right head for this. I'm going to sit back with Mrs. L, if that's okay with you, besides, you've got Scotland Yard here to help.”
“Oh dears, what a lovely surprise,” the old woman gushed, “Harriet, just look at you! You look absolutely beautiful.”
She nods, standing to take his arm, “Ready when you are.”
Did you like the bit with Irene? Hahaha! That harpy. I love her.
And I finally picked the tango song.
John finally stops on the stairs and half turns to Sherlock. He’s about to apologize again, but he finds looking at Sherlock’s distraught face, that no words will leave his mouth.
Sherlock turns, slicking now shampoo smothered hair back out of his face and tilts his head at John, “Oh, but Captain, you so do enjoy the sound of my voice.” He says in that low sex-oozing baritone of his.
John lost it and pulled Sherlock by the shirt with his left hand and, taking his eyes off the road for a second to glare at Sherlock, he warned, “You forget, Sherlock Holmes, that I was a soldier! I

Warning: this chapter literally starts with smut. There will be smut a couple of the following chapters as well (not as many as I'd though originally but still). I hope this is obvious from the rating and the tags, but in case it wasn’t, ya been warned ma frands, ya been warned.
John blinks, “You... you don’t need to,” he says, carefully, “it’s... it’s like I said, when I met you. It’s all fine, you know? It’s all fine, Sherlock.”
“Happy juice?” Sherlock inquires.
Sherlock fumed, “Tell
John looked at Irene sadly. She tried to hide her worried look by giving him an encouraging smile as she opened the door for him. John caught it anyway and squeezed her hand on his way out.
“Please, Algy is choppy and looks like he’s about to stomp on her - and Gladys really needs to learn what to do with her arms. She looks like she’s drowning,” Jack grins.
John carefully picks himself up, along with Sherlock’s help, though his knees are still aching. “Alright, I’m coming, I’m coming.”
Sherlock gives Irene a look which the others miss. Irene simply shrugs and says, in Russian, so she won’t be understood, “U nas net podskazok poetomu my mogli by takzhe poveselit'sya”
with your classics, I’m just saying it’s
Rosie hugs Sherlock around the neck and gives him a big sloppy kiss on the cheek, “Happy!” She replies.
Dorian’s cheeks seem to glow with his blush at the last comment, but Sherlock pretends not to notice while he eyes him from the side. It’s probably better if he plays dumb. Instead, he raises a disbelieving brow and says, “Me? A mystery?”
Of course Sherlock, being Sherlock had the nerve to roll his eyes, sighing, “A gun? Really? How drôle...”
him to. Sherlock's legs begin to tremble and a flush of red begins to bloom on his chest, creeping its way up to Sherlock's neck and face. He looks bloody marvelous. Sherlock is sweating and panting, his mouth is open in a silent scream of pleasure as sultry little sobs escape through his lips in a frantic rhythm. Finally Sherlock pleads, "John, please,
“Good.”
Sherlock smirks, “Probably because they sense you’re a witch.”
say that.” Sherlock growls.
"Hi," Sherlock responds, shifting himself a little uncomfortably to be able to nip and John's lips.
When Sherlock returns they settle onto the carpet to entertain Rosie. She coos and laughs happily at the attention being showered on her. They spend the entire afternoon entertaining her, and as the evening wears on Sherlock's dark mood seems to wane. After a few hours, when she gets visibly sleepy, and John appears to have grown tired, Sherlock orders John a take-away and moves to the sofa to read Rosie a bed-time story until she falls asleep. John's heart feels full at the sight of them, as it always done. Sherlock is so perfect with her. After John eats he removes the sleeping baby from Sherlock’s arms and places her upstairs in her crib. He comes back down after setting up the baby monitor and finds that Sherlock has turned down the lights and put on the telly. He’s curled up by the arm rest with a blanket watching an old black-and-white film.
John’s comment makes Sherlock chuckle, bringing forth a purely contented sound from low in his throat as he agrees, “Yes, ridiculously so.”
thought John.
Sherlock scoffs, “As if I’ll ever tell you any of their names.”
“He sent me his records before he -“ and then Sherlock stops because he’s just realized something, “-Wait. John... are you..?”
“Bart's Hospital!” He said, “And hurry!”
! John has arrived early! Molly panics flailing and dropping the tv remote so that it skids across the floor, while the judges begin to talk to Sherlock and Iris, giving them their scores. The remote clangs against a table and lands under the winged-back chair on her left. The knock on her door gets a little louder and Molly gives up turning off the telly, instead rushing to get the door before John gets worried, saying, “Sorry! Coming!” She pauses to catch her breath and opens the door, expecting to greet the couple waiting to pick up John’s baby with a slight flush on her face. When she opens the door, however, she finds that John stands there alone tonight, with a cab idling by. He doesn’t look upset, but Molly chooses not to mention it anyway.
John frowned, “Some of them are not that bad!”
Greg finds out about Sherlock dancing.
“A dance to the death?” Dorian asks.
XD I know this chapter is super short, it’s because I split it with the next chapter (s) I’m not sure if I’ll be splitting the next one as well most likely I will. You’ll see why. :D in the meantime. Enjoy.
“Yeah, yeah, let's do it. Call them, back for me, will you? But I'll probably have to dig up a date for that, won't I?”
The video ends and the stage is set. At the back of the stage there’s a sort of set placed in as a backdrop obscuring the band. John gasps as he immediately recognizes the space that the set is emulating. It looks like the living room of 221b – the black and white damask wallpaper, the smiley face, the skull poster, a coffee table and a couch, complete with a brooding lying detective, lying on it in one of his posh suits, his hands steepled under his chin.
, John?” He asks rolling his eyes, “But in answer to your question – no. I’m not sure what more I can learn from Gray considering he doesn’t seem to want to talk about Basil or Francis. Plus, like I said: he’s annoying. I think we should find a few of his and ‘Harry’s’ mutual acquaintances. I was thinking we start with Jack. He’s in love with Henry’s sister. There was a scandal last year about Dorian and Gwen, and while he and Jack seem to be friendly, Jack can’t possibly appreciate what Gray did to Gwen’s reputation. Gwen herself is friendly enough with Dorian right now because of
It had taken him weeks to do it. Irene was just as wily as always. She had taken to sleeping in Sherlock’s bed with him, and she never seemed to have the phone when they were asleep, but always magically had it when they were awake. Sherlock had tried searching for it when she was sleeping many times, but whenever he returned to bed empty-handed she would be mysteriously awake with a smug look on her face. She never said a word, and neither did he, but they both knew he had been looking.
Okay I love you byeee. <3 <3
is what I want to do.”
John leans back to join him, his hand slipping back away from Sherlock again, “Sorry.” He looks at Sherlock with a grin, “I suppose I was just curious about who it is. I mean there’s only so many straight blokes that I can think of and out of all of them Greg is the only one that makes any sense.”
“Oh most certainly not,” Sherlock agrees as he spins away from John and comes back.
Rosie whines in complaint but crawls over to John and allows him to pick her up.
John spluttered, “Really? Oh wow, well that's awkward. No, no closet. I just... I don't talk about it. It's my business, no one else's.”
“Wro- hang on, what? He - you thought he was my
John!”), flippers (“Underwater,” John explained.), and last his three most recent, the Murray 'classic black', the Stamford Achkan and the Moriarty-Moran Punk-Rock Circus of death suit.
“Of the body, you're a medical man,” Sherlock said, taking the umbrella with one hand and handing him the torch with the other. He gestured for John to investigate, handing back the keys for John to put them back. He also gave John another pair of latex gloves.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Sherlock... he's fine though isn't he?” John asked his eyes widening.
Jack smacks Sherlock as he takes another sip of his pink monstrosity, “Oh just say yes. He’ll be relentless otherwise and don’t worry, I’ll protect you. Besides, Henry will be here soon. He’ll keep the little monster under control.”
“I-I know, but I-” John tried, but he found, even after all this time he didn't know what to say.
And Irene almost grabs the phone and throws it just as Sherlock asks her, “What the hell is he on about? Why’s he so obsessed with Gray?”
“John,” Sherlock supplies mercifully, “Doctor John Watson.”
“Very funny, Mycroft.” Sherlock got up from his chair and crossed his arms, glaring at his brother as he stood at the door leaning on his umbrella.
John gave a weak smile from where he was sat on a chair, enjoying his mother's happiness all the while feeling his heart breaking.
Sherlock laughs at her sudden outburst and cleans her face where she’s somehow managed to get spaghetti sauce on it, “I did promise you that didn’t I?”
– Afghan– Afghanista-- haaann,
John frowned at that, thinking '
“What? The man said up! It's up!” Irene complained as she opened the door to her car and John did the same on the other side.
a case), John’s girlfriend might question why he’s not already in bed. For some reason it feels odd to explain to her that he’d been up watching videos of his old flat mate dancing in a tight glittery outfit. He sighs and closes the laptop with a soft snap and puts it away. He isn’t sleepy yet, but he decides, with a sense of finality, that he should get to bed. Maybe he’ll text Sherlock in the morning, or go ‘round to Baker Street. John yawns and steps into the bathroom to get ready for bed, clicking the door shut behind him. Tomorrow. Tomorrow he will ask.
“Cheers,” John says, then adds, “Dorian… was it?” Again, his mouth takes over for him while his brain plays catch-up.
Berwick nodded and went back to playing pool with his friends.
bother you?” John says playfully, “Okay then, here I come...!” He puckers his lips comically and wrestles Sherlock, attempting to kiss his mouth. As they giggle and struggle, he manages to get at Sherlock’s eye, the corner of his mouth, the side of his cheekbone and his chin until Sherlock finally loses and John captures his mouth, slipping his tongue in for good measure.
Molly sits in the VIP section next to a few friends of the other competitors. It’s currently intermission and she’s waiting on Sherlock or Irene to text her from backstage. The two of them have been frustrated at their lack of clues and, according to Sherlock, they had had a major argument about Irene hiding some things about the investigation. Molly still finds it hard to believe Sherlock trusts her, after how things ended the first time the two of them worked together. Then again, Molly felt that she was stupid enough to freaking date Jim Moriarty before she knew he was an obsessed psychopath, so she probably shouldn’t be judging Irene for wanting to use him to get to the Holmes brothers. At least Irene hadn’t fallen for him. Not that Molly had been in LOVE with Jim, but…. She’d hoped since at the time she had been so hung up on Sherlock, that he could have been an opportunity for a relationship. She sighs as she checks her phone for the fifth time since the current dancers began their performance.
Unfortunately for John’s brain, Sherlock’s voice follows him down as well. “JOHN, STOP! JOHN, WAIT!” Sherlock shouts, having clambered after him and wrapped himself up in his discarded dressing gown in his pursuit of his friend out into the hall.
John though. He didn't answer his mother though, instead looking at Harry anxiously through the crack in the door.
John lets out a light breath, “Well, em, congratulations? I guess? Sorry again, for er -“ he gestures towards the door “I really should have kept knocking, or called to let you know I was coming. Over that is. That I was coming over.”
“You're the worst.” John stated and walked away from her making his way towards Mary and his Sister. They seemed deeply engrossed in conversation when John approached them. “It's late. You must be exhausted, let's... you want to, er...” John gestured at Harry that they should leave.
“What good is it being appreciated if no one is naked?” Irene asked.
Sherlock scowls at John and opens his mouth to argue about the boyfriend bit, but Greg interrupts, hoping to avoid a crisis from either of them – “We’re not sure exactly, but if Irene’s blackmailer is looking for Basil, maybe one of his friends can identify him? Or maybe it’s one of his friends that is looking for him? Either way if we can find someone that cares about the missing painter, then maybe we can find who the blackmailer is.”
Once they were off, John yelled at Sherlock over the sound of the rain and motor, “
“You don't have to come. You could just–”
She turned towards Mary suddenly, “Let's go dancing!” She exclaimed, excitedly.
“Oh, yes, thank you Mr. Holmes – sorry, Sherlock – it’s another award of some sort or other, as you might have guessed – I’m not really sure what for, to be honest. I hardly pay these things any mind – they’re all so very droll, but I do so love an excuse to see my friends and celebrate.” He turns towards Molly with a grin, taking both of her hands in his and says, “So glad you could make it, my dear, I was very much looking forward to your presence,” then, turning to Sherlock, he continues, “You, as well, of course, Mr. Holmes. You know, Dorian has been driving me absolutely
Mycroft sat outside in the waiting area waiting for news on Sherlock's well-being. He'd had a serious over-dose for the first time in a long time again. When he'd arrived at Sherlock's flat in 221b he'd found him shaking on the couch, crouched into a ball and mumbling incoherently. The list was no-where to be seen. It was then that Mycroft had called an ambulance and when it arrived had rushed in the compartment to ride with his little brother to Hospital.
Sherlock looks thrilled at the idea, “Angelo’s?” He asks.
Irene thought.
Love,
“Oh that's so great!” John panicked and his voice sounded a tad hysterical.
His movements are as fluid as water and the way he pushes down his suspenders as he dances makes John swallow hard as he watches the video on the tiny screen. The song replays the chorus and John’s eyes widen while Sherlock unbuttons his shirt bit by bit, one hand slipping into his hair while his hips gyrate to the rhythm of the song. He ends up with his top undone most of the way down and he does not seem at all shy about the way he’s writhing on the dance floor, bringing the hand from his hair slowly and seductively to trail down his chest to his stomach. The woman in front of him leans in closely and they grind without touching each other. Somehow the movements seem filthier with the space between them, their faces just inches away, each one looking like they’re practically panting into the other’s mouth. Someone in the background wolf whistles and another person yells, “Isn’t that your wife Henry?” Just as Sherlock’s shirt starts to slip down one of his shoulders, the video cuts off. The next video is of everyone in the ‘Strictly dance crew,’ as John has decided to mentally dubb it, laughing and drinking together while someone shouts, “goodnight London!” John closes the app just as the video begins to switch into one of Dorian talking and addressing the camera about being excited for next week’s dance or something. John doesn’t really care or pay it any attention. Quite frankly his brain is too fried from the flagrantly sensual display that Sherlock had just put on with a virtual stranger. This was now permanently on the internet…
, it is. Of
“Okay, yeah that’s weird. Wait – why was Francis at Dorian’s home if he’s Henry’s butler? Also do we know why Basil was looking for Dorian at that hour? I mean, if it’s so important, why wouldn’t he just phone him?” John asks.
"Can I ask you something?" John continues.
“Really?” John comments, smirking, “She’s converted you into a Rihanna fan, then?”
for the Foxtrot- Habits: by Tove Lo, but the postmodern jukebox 1930’s cover ft. Haley Reinhart on vocals
Sherlock whines as John begins to interchange his swirling tongue with a finger, opening him wider. Sherlock feels his legs trembling as John works him open. He brings his free hand up over his eyes and pants, thinking to himself, ‘
“Ah, I'll get to him later, I suppose.” DI Dimock had smiled.
“I’d love that.” John smiles, “Get Rosie’s things while I shower, will you?”
it's your sister.” Seeing the frown on John's face deepen, William decided to start over, “Okay, fine, let's run a little experiment shall we? I'm going to help you practice saying no.” John gave William a weak smile that clearly read '
“Who are you?” The man asked.
And my aren’t those words the greatest thing John’s ever heard. “You sure?” John whispers playfully around their kiss and nipping at Sherlock’s lower lip.
Sherlock turns to his closet, then checks the time on his phone again, “Fine,” he huffs, throwing hands up in the air in surrender, “Fine! Do as you like.”
“Oh that's right, you were off eating coconut cake and dancing with pretty girls, such a burden!” She said in a rare event of quiet sarcasm, “So, how was it?”
“I have.” Greg admitted.
But also angst. A little. Smol angst. Baby angst.
Sherlock nods, “Hmm, Cesaria Evora, she was very talented,” he informs John in a whisper so soft that John feels himself leaning forward to listen.
“And?”
The cabby looked back at him with a questioning brow  as he heard him giggle and caught a glance of John changing. John noticed him looking back “Oi, that's two-sixty now, you really want to keep this going?”
Sherlock huffs a small laugh, “Ha. I suppose not.”
Mary made a b-line over to John and Irene, looking nervously at the gift station. She'd forgotten to get something... She looked at John, her eyes wide in a sudden panic.
“God she sounds amazing...” Harry sighed.
But Molly cuts him off with a hand gesture for silence as she finishes tapping on her phone’s screen. She brings up a video, which she presents to John and...
“Every time he has an over-dose Mycroft has him write a list of what he's taken and brings him to the hospital.” Anthea explained, “He nearly died last time...”
“You got too close, Mr. Holmes. I've a code, you know, and you don't fit into it, but today, you knew me for who I was... and now I have to get rid of you.” The car stopped by the side of the road then. The cabby turned, gun to Sherlock's head again, “Now, Sherlock Holmes, out of the car, if you please.”
“I dunno.” John says, “When did you start?”
John couldn't help but push up into the warm depths of Sherlock's mouth as he grasped at John's shaft and lathed upwards, swirling his tongue around the frenulum and groaning deep in his throat. He sucked lightly and then plunged himself back down over and over. John lifted his hips and slid his hands onto Sherlock's head, tugging on his hair lightly as Sherlock continued one of the most amazing blow jobs John had ever had. John felt himself getting close now, and found he really didn't want it to be over this way, despite what his body wanted. He pulled Sherlock back by the hair a little harshly, bringing Sherlock's head up as he pulled himself off of John with a slow suck and a kiss at the end of his prick.
After that he came out dancing and twirling a red cape in a traditional matador's outfit. “Olé!” John said through the rose between his teeth. Sherlock fell on the floor holding onto his stomach while attempting to snap several photos. For a second he was worried he'd never be able to breathe again.
“Amazing! Isn't it like the eighth time you've gone over to South America?”
“Not much. Rain washed away a lot of evidence.” Dimock answered.
John frowned and pulled back, “See if I ever try to comfort
Sherlock grinned, stopping his wriggling and grabbing the bottle. “Got condoms too,” He said, his voice barely a ragged whisper. He squirted some lube on his hand and reached behind him again, groaning.
“Mr... Holmes?” John Watson asked, staring at Mycroft.
John is speechless. He stares, wide-eyed and his lips half-parted at the scene before him. He feels a heat rise up to his face and feels himself shake his head as he turns self-consciously away. “Sorry. Sorry!” He hears himself mutter rather raggedly as he rushes back out the door and towards the stairs, “I’ll leave you to it!” He panics. Thoughts of: Oh dear god, and: what the hell? And: Why couldn’t I have just called Sherlock? Rush through his head as he runs, barely registering that Sherlock is calling after him, and simply repeating: “Sorry! Sorry about that, should have kept knocking!” He feels nauseated and upset. A flurry of emotions rush after him as he follows his brain’s tirade of ‘gotta get out of here, gotta get out of here.’
John stared at his glass of wine.
Rosie gives John what can only be described as a Sherlockian glare of disapproval, “Down!” She hisses (hisses!) in return.
John is pretty sure that the three of them temporarily die from cuteness overload.
“Hmmm, your cousin Marie-Georgette... top table, d'you think?” John asked him, passing Sherlock an envelope.
For Sherlock, he sends a message with a screen shot of Sherlock dipping his dance partner followed by a bunch of crying-laughing emoticons and question marks, along with the clapping hands.
John dashed out of the cab (now changed into a very dapper and simple white Achkan with gold trim) into the indian theme decorated wedding venue. Knowing Mike, he'd be freaking out about the wedding and John had to be there to talk him round. He only hoped he wasn't too late.
The lyrics I used here can be translated to mean:
confessions and commitments. Also it's the end.
Also, they were out of character in the first couple of chapters because the whole thing is basically the same lines as in the movie minus the “sherlock-esque” speech patterns, but now about 90% the lines in this chapter are completely mine so they might seem a little out of character of their characteristics so far...? LOL, I dunno. I tried to keep them consistently Jane and Kevin-esque as they have been so far... soooo hopefully I succeeded? I'm being too self-conscious, I think XD I'll stop now.
“I need to talk to your mother about what you've been watching on tely, young man.” Mary said, though she was smiling even as the words came out of her mouth, “Now, off you pop.”
You have
It’s Sherlock’s turn to hesitate, “He’s... it isn’t - He’s not -“
----------
“He disappeared?” Molly asks, “What happened to him?”
let alone The Sherlock Holmes (as John was so fond of saying jokingly) else could misinterpret anything Dorian is saying. “Well then,” Sherlock responds, “I suppose turnabout is fair play. I’ll have to get to know you too.”
Sherlock nods, “Yes, and I’m starting to think they’re right – no one has seen or heard from the man going on two years now. Even Mycroft is stumped.”
Sherlock...!”
“You actually did that?” Sherlock interrupted. The concept sounded tedious.
“Have you gotten anything on the case? The one you begged me to take away from Anderson and give to you?”
to remember her right now but fuck if she didn’t have the right idea. Sherlock was an absolute treasure like this: hot, sweaty, needy and begging for release. John can barely restrain himself. He pulls away with one last swipe of his tongue and reaches for the condoms and lube. Sherlock watches John from his position on the bed looking utterly debauched. His lips are swollen red, some hickeys are starting to appear in areas of his skin that John has nipped and bitten at, his nipples are taught and pert and his legs are splayed open, waiting for John to settle between them again.
The girl smiled at them, “Well, ya done brilliantly, you two. And hey, thanks for the drinks, mate.” She said, tapping Sherlock's end of the table and leaving as Sherlock said, “Yup no problem.”
“If I didn't know you so well, brother dear,” Came Mycroft's voice from behind him, “I'd say we should be expecting a happy announcement by the end of the week.”
Sherlock’s smile has fully returned to his face now and his eyes twinkle with mirth as he answers sweetly, “I love you too, silly idiot.”
“Alright you mad bastard I’ve -“ John stops dead in his tracks. The vision of Sherlock bloody Holmes fucking himself on the bed is... something else. John’s mouth waters at the sight of him. Dear god. Is this Sherlock’s way of saying... of asking...?
“Desk, first drawer to your right.” Sherlock tells him, an arm over his face.
John picks up his sister Harry from the airport and then attends Jim's engagement party.
Sally’s grin when she sees Greg grows even bigger. “Greg!” Sally exclaims happily, “You have
“Wow, controversial,”
John stared around the shop and said nothing while he waited for Harry to start yelling. He knew by now it was best to let her get out all her anger first and then try to reason with her. If he spoke first, there was no way she would listen, and anyway Harry owed him as much of an apology as he owed her.
“Nonsense John, it was my fault you had to do it. Besides, you saved the day. I think you've done enough. Dimock, please, allow me.” Sherlock interrupted.
John, who was sorting through his mail suddenly looked down at her, his face flushing pink.
“Mycroft doesn't do emotions.” Anthea explained.
“Order up” The man at the cash said. Mary reached for the water bottles and crisps.
“Oh... well thanks...” Mary answered awkwardly.
Dorian grins and comes closer, encouraged by Sherlock’s attention. “Well if I had to put money on anyone that isn’t me, it’d be on you and Iris. I thought you two were amazing, as usual. Plus you’re the judge favorites AND the fan favorites despite me and Cecily existing, so I’m sure you’ll recover.”
Tess wipes a tear from her face with no restraints, “You caught me. I’m quite emotional over it,” Her laugh is a little watery as she turns to the judges, all of which are also smiling, and some of which are doing so while dabbing at their eyes as well. “And it looks like some of our judges are teary eyed as well, isn’t that right Darcey
“D-... -imock... -ell... -your location pl—se”
John takes the phone in one hand to try and read it better and huffs in amusement when he sees the words that are marked on the screen under The Woman's moniker. The message says, simply,
, I'd really like you to ask your friend, you know, that really rude one?”
“Well they’re here for you, aren’t they? You could say it’s a logical question to ask you,” Molly responds mildly.
“Oh no, I understand perfectly, JOHN WATSON
“BISCUITS AND JAMMY DODGERS! JINX!” Harry yelled as John spoke the same words, both burning towards each other and pointing a finger in a long remembered game.
“Is that weird for you?” Harry asked, a look of mild concern crossing her face.
“It's fine John, she doesn't have to wear it.”
Next week: Bouquet and balloons, Watson, Harriet. (“Unf! John isn't she perfect?” John slammed the door in the delivery guy's face.)
, as the detective had once so eloquently put it.
“What the...?”
“Okay, stop it. This is real life. This is not one of your silly little fantasies,” Irene said, “John, you've got to go over there lead her into the washroom and show her how you feel. It's now or never John, so, Now.”
“Hello again, Doctor Watson,” Dorian shouts, “Changed your mind about the dancing then?”
She’s surprised however, when Sherlock stands in front of her, not allowing Molly to go and flicks Iris’ shoulder, saying, “Behave, wench,” then, turning to Molly he says, “Stay, please. I think it might be better if you do. We need all the help we can get.”
Sherlock chuckled at John's visible annoyance.
“Oh.” Dimock said, looking at Sherlock with a pitying expression.
do is I can be their friend, and I can give them all the love and respect and gratitude that they deserve for ever daring to care about a person like me. Again, I can only do this
“Are you ready, John Darling?” John's mother said as she hooked her arm around his.
Irene wonders.
“Dorian,” He mumbles in greeting before the boy can greet him.
, and I don’t think I understood it enough to hate it back then.”
“Give me that!” She snarls and claws the phone out of Sherlock’s grasp.
Sherlock walked into the small building following the directions Harriet had given him. He sauntered confidently down the hall as he found the door he was looking for and knocked twice.
. Well damn, if that wasn’t a surprise…
Josh laughs nervously, “Thank you, er –“ and he hesitates, John didn’t give his name, and out of spite he chooses not to answer now.
“Whoo-hoo!” A knock at the door wakes Sherlock from his thoughts and Sherlock realizes that he’d been thinking much too hard as he hadn’t noticed the shower begin to run.
’ She types, taking pity on Watson but mostly so that  Sherlock won’t kill her when she passes him the phone back. It also serves to double down on the implication - because what else could she possibly mean? —
“Gross Harriet.”
The way she says it startles a laugh out of him. It is simultaneously scandalous, blunt, and innocent. It also instantly reminds him of the line from John’s Blog that had once angered him - ‘Sherlock sees through everyone and everything in seconds. What’s incredible though is how spectacularly ignorant he is about some things.’ He thinks he understands what he meant now. Eurus is a genius, but when it comes to emotions, though she feels them quite strongly, she is as ignorant as himself and Mycroft, possibly more so.
shame. Still, even with his lack of shame it is clear that Jack is more practiced. His body is almost liquid in the smooth way it flows from one movement to another. He also throws in some very smooth spins and fancy arm movements along with impressive footwork that Dorian could never hope to imitate so evenly.
The boy grins, “There is no such thing,” he says, tossing his head back in laughter as he finally untangles himself from the older man’s side. It’s only then that Sherlock notices the pretty woman standing behind the older man. She appears, at first glance to be younger than him, though Sherlock can tell, even in the dim light, that this might be due to some small forms of surgery. Her hair looks a bit tousled and she holds a glass which is smeared with her lipstick and is filled with what appears to be wine. Dorian moves to kiss her free hand in greeting then turns to introduce them, “Sherlock these are my dearest friends, Henry, who as Jack said, is also my manager, and this lovely lady is his wife, Victoria,” he gestures at Sherlock, “Harry, Vicky, this is Mr. Sherlock Holmes - he’s the detective from the blog I told you about a few years ago.”
Sherlock smiles up at him, taking a menu and passing it to John then taking his own, “I think you’ve paid me back in full, old friend,” he replies.
John sat at a bar stool, smiled weakly at them and waved good bye to his sister.
“Actually... I'm having drinks with some friends from Miami...” Harry looked at John apologetically.
She shrugs. “Well, perhaps you simply need to be more adventurous,” she observes.
And the way Sherlock says that… god, John’s heart simultaneously breaks and melts somehow. He’d had no idea that Sherlock actually missed Rosie. Sure, he seemed to like her enough, and yes he was kind and encouraging, but John had thought… well, he’d worried that Sherlock might find her a slight bit of a nuisance. The man lived an odd and exciting solitary life. It felt strange for John to think that Sherlock might actually
John laughs, releasing his hand, “Wanker,” he replies.
“So as we’re on the subject of the… Er… women in our lives… where’s…” and Sherlock seems to fumble a bit before he casually flaps a hand in the air, indicating he’s forgotten something, “um... your lady … person.”
John is about to open his mouth to reply in anger when Sherlock interrupts him once more. “This isn’t for a case, idiot.” And before John can interrupt him with an irritated “then what is it then?”, he continues, “What I’m trying to explain is that this is the first time I’ve ever been with this man.”
A short Chapter about John.
“I don't believe you.”
John's ears perked up.
John feels a pencil snap in his grip as he continues to stall on buzzing the intercom for his next patient.
If it makes you feel better I almost cried as I wrote this whole section.
interesting.”
John hands Rosie over to Sherlock as he lays her baby bag down next to him in the booth seat. Rosie babbles at Sherlock about being excited about food and dancing. John watches with a barely hidden expression of affection as Sherlock responds to her, in the tone he always uses to speak with her as if she were a very important adult.
He looked round the room and took in all the flowers in vases, Harriet's from Mary, and all the wedding plans strewn across the table.
Sherlock takes his hand and asks, “Sorry, which is it Harry or Henry?” he clarifies.
“He knows your name –” John starts, exasperated, though he’s sure that his girlfriend is probably right, but in Sherlock’s defense it took him literal years to learn Greg’s name.
“Oh my god!” The waitress exclaimed then, “You're him!” She said, pointing at John.
He turns to her until she feels his gaze on her face.
Edit: I edited chapters 1 & 2. They're not perfect but they might be a little better. Sherlock was way too happy at the end of Chapter 2. Like, whoa man calm down.
Irene giggles saying, “Sorry sorry,” as Sherlock grumpily crawls back towards the bed.
Sherlock shuffles, bouncing Rosie a little and letting go of John’s hand for a second to switch arms. John picks up his other hand instantly and they continue dancing, “I wouldn’t say I’m a big fan. I do prefer classical music, as you know, but I find that I don’t mind some songs in terms of using them to dance. I can’t very well go up and do a street dance to Beethoven, can I?”
They all turned to him then.
John, you're
“Oh,” The handsome man said, looking up, “Erm yes, unfortunate-”
John takes a breath as his stop comes up. He makes up his mind while he exits the vehicle to go up and try to talk to Sherlock. He just hopes that Sherlock no longer has company. Of course if he does have company, (and he doesn’t catch them in a compromising position again) John can at least introduce himself and perhaps even scope this guy out. Not in a jealous way or anything - just... to make sure he won’t be hurting Sherlock. After all, Sherlock did have an odd taste in romantic partners (ie. Irene Adler), and it was only reasonable to want to protect his best friend, right?
Sherlock felt like he was sinking into an ocean. His eyelids felt heavy and he found that he simply couldn't find the strength to speak, even though he desperately wanted to.
John gave Harry a look.
“Committing it to memory, are you?” John asks, with a knowing smile.
Rosie watches with interest as John attempts to pick up the tray one handed. He struggles for a full minute when finally she begins to wiggle in annoyance.
They giggled like school girls as they ran into room they were given at the inn.
“Either way we need to see what we can glean out of these people. Irene is working on flirting information out of every woman she can get her claws into. We’re looking at three that would have likely known Basil or Dorian’s Servant or at least how he died – Lady Brandon’s daughter – Camille, Henry’s wife – Victoria, and Henry’s sister – Gwendolyn, who have all been close enough to the three of them that they might know something.
“Of course.” Mycroft smirked.
He starts off fine, but as the day progresses he grows more and more irritated with himself. His mind is driving him mad - the image of Sherlock lying naked and peacefully asleep with another man coiled around him is simply burned into his memory. It plays on and on in his mind like a video feed on constant loop, torturing him into a state of scorching rage bubbling just beneath the surface of his skin. And, ugh! John just doesn’t understand why he can’t just fucking stop thinking about it.
“Hi Sherrock,” Rosie interrupts, claiming the attention for herself before John can say anything in return.
The boy has apparently not given up though, “Nope!” He shouts as he takes Irene’s bag from Sherlock and hands (read: tosses) it to Henry. He pulls Sherlock with him to the dance floor in the direction Irene and the others are now gathered in. “No such thing as too much! Come, indulge me,” and it’s not like Sherlock has much of a choice. He allows himself to be dragged into the mass of writhing bodies and joins them. Before he realizes it, he’s grinning from ear to ear as he and Irene allow the stresses of the competition and their mystery to wash away.
“Pleasure to meet you Mary.” William (
ohn texts back.
John was still looking when Sherlock turned around, staring at the ground, “Ah... I forgot.” He pulled a small smart-phone out of his pocket. “I got this for you. It's...” Sherlock licked his lips, “It's a gift, so you don't have to carry around that insane journal from nineteen-eighty-seven with you anymore. It'll take care of... all of your appointments and the other things you might need to do...” John rolled his eyes, in annoyance as Sherlock finally looked up at him, saying, “It's... perfect for starting your life over again.” He held the phone out towards John, smiling weakly.
“What was the theme, humiliation?”
, thought John. “Really, a lisp that adds f's and turns your 'e's into 'u's,” John stated.
John raises a brow but says nothing. Weirdly enough, neither does Rosie. She seems to be staring at Irene suspiciously. Like father, like daughter.
Sherlock tries to get out of it by asking, “Haven’t we been doing enough dancing this evening?” He laughs to make his words sting a little less and hopefully the discouragement won’t annoy the young man too much.
They stared silently at each other for a while, then Sherlock spoke, “Just give me week?” He asked.
“Aww,” Tess says, “And are you as happy as them to be here with us?”
Sherlock laughed and bowed again. He then pretended to struggle as sat down on the bar, swinging his feet like a child. “Next round is on me!” He shouted and laughed again, tipping slightly and steading himself on John. Everyone around the room cheered and went back to their peaceful drinking, the concerns over Jennifer Wilson seemingly forgotten.
“He wants to know someone’s location - but Sherlock… the person that he’s looking for - I’ve searched everywhere and as far as I know, they don’t exist. This competition was the only lead I had - the only indicator that this person might exist linked some money going into the competition through a company that works with the network that produces the show. And that same company also pays for part of the show’s production…” Irene had sat down in front of Sherlock and sighed as she looked down into her drink for comfort.
As usual, no beta, no Brit-pick, and not edited because I’m lazy but also editing on mobile sucks and I’m too lazy to type it up on the laptop / desktop. Anyway enjoy~~

“Hmm. Interesting.” Sherlock said, “Thank you Mrs. Laurinston you've been a great help.” He stated, giving her a charming smile and finally standing. John got up too.
, he thought.
“... to the caterer's and I won't be able to make it, so I'm sending John with her instead, but please, join them.” She'd said.
And then he assumes Sherlock is in a relationship and he’s like: oh. Haha oops sorry. Good for you.
Sherlock nods, a flash of sadness at John's announcement quickly concealed as he turns towards Rosie, saying, “Yes, of course,” and moves to pick her up. Before he reaches her, however, Rosie does something remarkable. She stands up! Sherlock immediately freezes, looking at John with an expression of shock which quickly morphs into joy. John is frozen too, and both men watch her cautiously while she stares down at her little feet, a little frown of concentration on her features. Rosie takes a deep breath and then, glancing at John’s arm in calculation she unsteadily waddles her way over, reaching out until she can finally take hold of his hand to steady herself. “DADAH!” She says, clearly showing off her new skill.
“Ugh... fine.” And so John took Sherlock's hand as another song (Elton John's Benny and the Jets) came on, joined him on the dance floor and sang along with the rest of the pub. Sherlock was stolen by one of the young ladies from earlier almost immediately after returning to it and Sherlock laughed as John watched her drag him away. John continued dancing as per Sherlock's instructions and soon found partners of his own as they all danced song after song. It had gotten quite lively in here.
“With pleasure.” Irene walked out of his office to go do some much-needed paper work.
“Give me just a second, I want to get you something, Harry, don't go anywhere!” Their mother flittered out of the living room and went in the direction of her own bedroom.
“I love weddings, I always have.” John stated flatly.
“Thank you.” Sherlock said in his most civil voice when John opened the door. Sherlock waited. John stared at him expectantly. “May I come in?” Sherlock asked.
Mycroft laughed, “I've a vague idea where he'll be next.”
a lawyer but I'm sure as
“Excuse me.” He saw her say as she pushed away from her friends, her face looking completely entranced.
John was
“Not a problem.” John answered politely. Irene just gave Jim a look and kept walking.
(See the end of the chapter for
“–I know you aren't–”
“And?” Mary asked, searching his eyes.
people! I could snap you in two, you
“So could you.”
Sherlock stood hidden behind a plant by the window near the exit. He watched quietly as John's family, his sister and his friend silently reprimanded him for his behaviour. Sherlock however, was proud of him. He looked beautiful tonight even as he stood with his head held high in firm control, doing his best not to allow his regret to show. When John finally walked out of the door, Sherlock followed him.
“No, honey,” John says and lets go of the tray, attempting to regain control of his kamikaze toddler.
“Yummy!!” Rosie exclaims and immediately plunges a hand into her plate to grab at a meatball.
“Thank you Jim,” John started but Jim closed the door before John finished the sentence.
“Yeah...” Mary answered, “Usually... whatever I need he takes care of. That is... and as if I didn't take enough advantage of him already... I sent my dry-cleaning slip to him this morning.”
Sherlock presents his new story idea to his higher ups and John's dream girl returns from vacation.
“Youth and beauty should never be confined,” Henry replies, then looking to his charge, “Are we misbehaving tonight, Dorian?”
’ Dorian steps into her space and begins his own sensual grinding in her direction, though he never quite touches her. The video stutters but continues, the shorter-haired brunette pushes her friend aside and steps in to dance in Dorian’s face. The boy laughs and backs down while Sherlock steps forward to challenge the woman.
this,” she implored. John gave a glance at the sheet as Harry continued talking, “Because we don't want to be embarrassed again.” Harry smiled a little unpleasantly.
He isn’t.
Sherlock smirked and the engine of the thing roared to life. Carter and Dimock came out of the pub then. “We'll lead the way!” Dimock yelled as they got into their police car. Sherlock nodded.
“You are!” She accuses angrily, “tell me the truth!”
“-Tell me or I’m telling mummy that you aren’t being any fun, Sherlock. I’ll tell Mycroft you were crying again and he will be very cross. Do you want to upset them Sherlock?!” Eurus taps her foot impatiently.
making a scene, John? It’s
Sherlock grins cheekily and shrugs, choosing to feed Rosie instead of continuing the conversation. John shakes his head and his eyes shift to Rosie’s drawing.
John tapped his foot impatiently as he sat.
explicit? Should I um... change the rating? It was sort of... an accident. At first I was worried I wouldn't be able to write it, and tbh I saw worse in my journey of smutty fic research in terms of explicitness but uh... it just sort of just came to me as I wrote it. I mean I had notes that I wrote while reading the other fics but they were mainly things like “note: the use of the words moaning and groaning in literally all the smut, stroking, shuddering, quivering, various deep voiced noises, etc" (They're actually really funny notes lmao lots of question marks.
Also, Rosie is a big surprise for me and I dunno what I'm doing when I'm writing her because I don't have children and I've not spent time with an actual real-live two-year-old since my youngest brother was a smol thing back in '98. Yeah, I'm old.
Continuing to pet John's hair Sherlock asks, "Hmm?"
Sherlock frowns at that. “You’re wrong, John,” be replies softly, “I love Molly Hooper.”
“Yup.”
"Yes, well, I did just fuck
“Someone is trying to set this up as one of London's serial suicides.” Sherlock answered, “but we all know that's unlikely to be the case. The more likely scenario is that someone who knows about the investigation is trying to make it look like one in order to cover their tracks, or, more likely still, to implicate you.”
You have never had a care in the world! You're beautiful and fun and charming... your life is
“One meatball?” She asks, turning her gaze on each of them.
“Thanks for coming!” Jim answered, looking decidedly drunk hanging from his fiancée Sebastian's neck.
“What?” John asked, not looking up from his reading.
John's lips made an 'O'.
Sherlock groans and flops back against his pillows, “Must we...?” He asks. Rosie flops on top of him and sighs dramatically to emphasize his point.
John's eyes widened in panic at those last words and he dashed from the room.
“Calm? I am calm. I'm extremely calm!” Sherlock said it all too quickly.
“Never pegged you for an Usher fan,” he comments as one of the songs with an electronic beat singing something about a DJ sounds optimistically through the flat.
Greg and Irene share a look before bursting into laughter just as the four of them reach the tall bearded scary-looking bouncer at the door. Sherlock presents their invitation cards. The man takes them wordlessly, checking something off on a list. He then pulls back the rope that is barring the entrance to allow Sherlock and his friends to enter the building into a hall where guests can check in and leave their coats, if they wish to do so.
They settled at their mother's kitchen table as she served them some dainty sandwiches and tea. “Tuck in dears, tuck in,” she encouraged sitting down and taking two cubes of sugar for tea. “So, Harriet, how long are you back in London for love?” She asked.
John sighed once he was outside and took in a huge gulp of air, doing his best to calm down. He felt rather than heard as someone followed him out and looked at him. John swung round slowly to look at them.
The intercom buzzed then, and Mary's voice came through, “John! John, could you come here please?” She asked.
Harry gets a present from mum, John gets a lecture on saying 'no', Harry does more mean things, secrets are revealed and Sherlock gets to do some fun research for an article. Also cock jokes.
“Yes! Yes! John I'm fine, stay there, hold him. I think I have some cuffs in my car.”
honest as Mary believed her to be. She was a liar. She was his sister, but she was also hurting Mary, a woman who loved her and was about to marry her, and that was not on.
“Right... Thank you, John... for... for today.” He said softly, and left.
different tailors where he helped me cling to my sanity as my wife made me try on suit after suit...”
the tower of edible gifts for the Berwick outdoor charity. You can do anything, and we both know it, so you're going to do the cake, and you're going to do it in three weeks and I would like a discount, please.” John commanded in his best Captain's voice. Hadn't done that in a while. It felt even better when the chef smiled warmly at John, answering him with a look of admiration,
“I’m fine, John, just tired.” He’d answered in a huff and hadn’t said a word to him the whole way back.
Sherlock takes his dance partner’s hand – and squeezes it for support. Molly smiles at them both as they breathe. Just two more couples and they’ll be on next. Here goes nothing.
Sherlock picks her up as he stands and cuddles his face into her curls, “I know how you feel. I’ve missed you, darling,” he mumbles. He turns to Molly, smiling and he’s sure his eyes probably look a little wet from unshed tears, “Thank you, Molly, though I thought you said you wouldn't be coming.”
Sherlock was stunned for a second, and looked at the road ahead. Realizing he had no idea where they were he asked John as calmly as he could manage, “... Could you perhaps just slow down a tic so I can read that sign coming up?”
Lestrade raises a brow at Molly who smiles at him and gestures that he should watch the interaction. Lestrade turns his head to look back to Sherlock and Irene.
They dissolved into another fit of giggles as they leaned against the wall. Eventually Sherlock turned to John, an serious expression on his face as he said, “John...”
“That's hardly fair.”
John elbowed Sherlock, smiling at the reference to their earlier squabble, “Bit of advice, then, don't make people giggle at a crime scene. Gives away the fact you're secretly a robot.”
Enjoy!
John’s jaw stiffens, “Several.” He states, looking at the ceiling.
!” He said.
Just as she feels herself begin to vibrate on the tip of her seat Sherlock’s smiling face appears on the screen. It’s an odd smile, one that doesn’t quite reach his eyes, but for anyone that didn’t know him, you might say that he looked genuinely kind and happy to be on the show.
That night as he brushed his teeth a little thought nibbled at his mind.
“Yes, I attended her wedding in London. Mutual friend.” The lie seemed to slip easily from Sherlock's mouth as he continued his examination of the body. John frowned at that but said nothing.
Right now, though, it’s Molly’s turn to raise an eyebrow at him, crossing her arms over her chest in an obvious show of disapproval. She sighs, pinching the bridge of her nose, her nerves still bothering her inside but the shakiness of her voice under much more control. She’d almost forgotten what Sherlock was really like after watching him act completely differently on television. Finally, she asks, “Is there a reason you’re here at this hour Sherlock?”
“Irene” He greeted, looking her up and down. Her hair was a mess and she wore a dress that seemed a little too small and too colourful for her usual tastes.
“Fine,” Sherlock breathed, with no small amount of insolence in his tone, “Let's get a move on, then.” And he entered the cab's back seat as the cabby got into the driver's side, driving them out into the country side, back where Sherlock and John had come from.
,” followed by, “
Greg hears a semi-familiar theme song with trumpets that he vaguely recognizes as one of those pop celebrity reality TV shows his ex-wife seemed to enjoy so much emanating from the device. He rolls his eyes and pushes the phone away from himself.
“Yeah.”
Yeah so... John is an idiot. I love him, but he’s so dumb?? Like? Bruh?? Really??? You’re so dumb??
better.” He smiled at her unpleasantly as her face morphed into offended shock.
“Don't you all feel stylish, lads? Best part is, you can just keep the suits and wear them to all your bloody fancy parties. No more worrying about you've got to wear. A blessing, that is. Did you all a bloody favour picking the classic black look. Not to mention, the birds flock to a man in a good suit, or the woman in one! HA!” Bill laughed and clapped John on the back as John muttered, smiling nervously and indulgently, “Yes, Bill very true,” while Irene rolled her eyes at his stupid joke. John stepped on her foot to grab her attention before the photographer snapped a shot of the Groom and all his groomsmen. Irene glared but complied and gave a quick fake and toothy smile.
John just grabs hold of him tightly again. He squeezes Sherlock to his chest and kisses the top of his head, messing up his soft curls in his frantic embrace. Sherlock finally stops him, wiping tears away from John’s face and laches onto his mouth with his own. He doesn’t want John to be upset about this too. It’s in the past. John had already mourned for Sherlock’s death and the guilt of that had tortured Sherlock more than any physical pain he had endured during those two years. Sherlock doesn’t want John to mourn for him any more.  He wants John to be happy. He wants to enjoy this moment with him.
This one is going to be posted sooner than I thought. Just a warning - erm don’t expect this all the time? I’m terrible with keeping a schedule for posting but I’ll do my best. As usual, no beta or Brit-picker.
