<3 <3 <3
: Of course it is.
Anyway!! I'll see y'all Sunday!! Have a great week until then!!
Hopefully it'll be worth the wait! :)
: The course is going well. It's actually pretty interesting.
Hope you enjoy :D
"Hey, it's okay," Cas muttered, and it's only then that Dean realized that he'd been making wounded animal noises. "You are going to have to tell me, but not yet. You can tell me later, okay? For now you just need to-" he cut himself off suddenly, his eyes hardening in what Dean knew was definitely anger. He didn't know what he had done, but he had done something wrong.
Eileen laughed, uncurling herself and reaching out to pull Dean into some kind of half hug. “Yeah,” she agreed, “at least we have pie.”
Reading your comments always makes my day!! So yeah, thanks guys. You're all amazing!
"Impala, Sir."
I was originally planning to wait until the weekend to update this, but y'all's comments just made me want to update earlier, and I have zero self-control, so here we are!
"Good boy," Castiel smiled, "when was the last time you drank something?"
"Why do you need to know how to make a pie, anyway?" Dean asked as they started slowly rolling out the pastry, making sure to face Eileen so she could read his lips when he didn't know the sign for something. "homemade can never be beaten, but even I will admit that a store bought one is good enough, and a lot easier. Though don't tell anyone I said that."

Seriously guys... I love you all. The only reason I didn't post this earlier was because I needed to edit it.
I just realized that I never specified, so for people who haven't read my stories before, updates are every Sunday and Wednesday.
It's The Final Chapter!! (of this work)
Awww, aren't they all the best. Dean is so lucky to have such a great family helping him.
I just want to let you know, y'all are the best. Thank you for reading and commenting and making writing all of this so worth it. I hope you enjoy!!
"You're my friend. I needed to check."
“Alright,” Dean announced, having to clear his throat a couple of times to get rid of the emotion that was in his voice. He carefully transferred his rolled out pastry into the pie tin he’d greased earlier, and poured some baking beans inside. “Blind baking time!” He watched as Eileen slowly copied him, rolling the pastry onto her rolling pin before putting it in the tin, and then trimming the sides and patching any holes. Her pastry case wasn’t quite as flawless as Dean’s was, but she also didn’t bake pies every other week, and he was pretty impressed. “You’re a natural,” he told her, putting the cases into the oven and setting the timer.
Seriously guys!! Y'all really tested my self control! I really wanted to post it early for you all, but luckily (for me, less lucky for you) my self control won. But!! Luckily for y'all it is Wednesday!! So the wait is over!! It is scene time!!
Also!! Happy Easter if you celebrate it, if you don't, then Happy Holidays! And if you don't celebrate any holidays this time of year, then happy!!
"A couple of days ago?" Dean could feel himself shrinking down, curling his bare shoulders forwards to try and make himself less of a target. Cas was disappointed in him.
If you are reading this and sighing because you want to read D/s without smut, I'm writing non-smutty stuff too. Everything in balance and all that. Equal opportunity D/s fics.
Which… probably wasn't a bad thing seeing as he was married to the guy and wore his collar with pride. But still.
I'll see you then!!
Dean had to congratulate Eileen for managing to not look horrified, but then again… she'd been there when John turned up to talk to Sam, she could probably guess the kind of ship that man ran.
"Definitely," Cas agreed, finally pulling back. Dean could see Sam and Eileen having their own reunion, and he waited for them to finish before he went over to give Sam a hug as well.
(See the end of the chapter for
Eileen's words were blunt, but they got the job done better than any long flowery paragraphs would have. What he and Cas had was forever, and the past couldn't change that.
He chewed quickly and swallowed, getting a pleased hum and a gentle pull on his hair in reward.
Ahhhhh. I am so glad it's posting day again.
I've written a few things into my end notes, which I would appreciate if you could read and react to, but that's a thing for later!! For now!! Enjoy the chapter!!
"Alright then sweet boy." The name sent a shiver through Dean, feeling more balanced already and they hadn't even done anything. "What's your safeword?" Not everyone used safewords, claiming that biology outweighed any need for them. Cas did not hold that belief, and that was one of the reasons Dean knew he was safe here.
“I’m not interrupting anything, am I?”
"I was hoping you'd teach me how to make some," Eileen told him, signing slowly so that it was easier for Dean to pick up.
(See the end of the chapter for
There were many things in Dean's life that he hated. He hated how his dad had raised him to be a soldier first, and a person second. He hated how much John had despised him, even when all he did was try to be good. He hated how Sam couldn't see it, even though he hadn't wanted him to - sometimes he wished that he hadn't been so successful, that Sam had realized what had happened. He hated that he was here at all, in this house, in this room.
"Yes Sir," Dean sighed, just those two words starting to ease the itch which was dancing under his skin.
I really enjoyed writing this chapter and the next one... take from that what you will...
He heard the clattering of a key in the lock, the creaking of the door opening, the quiet sounds echoing through the house and sounding like gunshots in the otherwise silent room, even from where he was, all the way upstairs.
"Well, he seems like an amazing Dom. Every time I see you together… I can see that he's good. So I guess, what I'm asking is… is he really that good?"
Next chapter: a bit of aftermath, and Sam reappears.
Dean hurried to fill up the glasses, making sure to not spill a single drop as he gently placed them both next to the plate.
"I'm back Sir," Dean said, lifting his head so that he was back to kneeling instead of leaning against Cas' knee and shaking the last of the fuzziness away and focusing completely on his Dom, on his body language and his words.
Gentle pressure on the back of his head pressed him down to rest his head on Cas' knee, allowing his body to go even more boneless than before and causing him to float even higher. In most situations feeling like this made him uncomfortable, he hated the feeling of not being able to protect himself, but he trusted Cas and knew that he would protect him while he was indisposed.
But he needed-
"Is Cas as good a Dom as he seems?" Eileen asked later on, seemingly out of nowhere. They were still in the living room, waiting for the pie timer to beep, and until a moment ago they'd both been focusing on their own stuff on their phones.
"Agreed," Dean hummed, taking another large bite, "so good."
They managed to get the fillings ready fairly quickly, by which time the pastry had finished pre-baking and they’d fished them out to cool. Dean was surprised when he glanced at the clock to see what time it was. He’d expected today to drag on without Cas, but with the help of Eileen and pie, time was moving at a reasonable pace.
Have an awesome week!! And I'll see you on Wednesday with some more soft bois.
Yeah, no.
"What's in it for me?" He already knew he was going to do it, regardless of what Eileen said.
I'll see y'all on Sunday!
I'll see you Sunday! :)
For no reason other than… to be his friend? He was a sub after all, and Sam was a grown man; he had no control over his brother. Dean had already made it clear he liked Eileen, and yet she'd still gone out of her way to buy the ingredients for Dean's favorite food, and come over so they could bake it together. He didn't think anyone had ever done anything like this before, unless they were already completely family, or Cas. Ever since he'd presented as a sub, he'd been the one doing this kind of thing for other people, and to be on the receiving end of things...
: It's pie Cas.
"Bye," Cas smiled, squeezing his hand and lightly tracing along the edge of Dean's collar before he finally left, softly closing the door behind him and heading for the taxi he had called. Dean didn't want to watch him go—couldn't really, unless he was asking the universe to make him drop—so he forced himself to climb back up the stairs and curl up in bed, buried under the still warm covers. He was glad Cas was getting these opportunities, knew it probably meant his job was getting ready to give him another promotion, but he couldn't help how much he hated it when Cas was gone.
Dean opened his mouth to ask Eileen what happened next, when the sound of the door opening and conversation drifted in from the front of the house. Dean froze, while Eileen frowned, trying to figure out what Dean had heard.
“We need to find her.” He grabs at Dean’s arm to help him sit up.
It’s Cas’s turn apparently. “Nobody is saying you—“
“I’m not going to lie to her.”)
“That’s some bullshit,” Dean says. “You can’t just hold seats like that when it’s this crowded.”
“Still,” Dean says with a huff. “My fist, your face. Those are the facts.”
“I mean, are you worried about how he’ll react to the information?”
“Well, that can be part of it, but there’s a lot more to it than that.” Dean says, pushing up to sit next to him. “Honestly, it’s not a far stretch from some of what we do now. You like to take control as it is and—“
“This is no longer amusing,” Cas says, focusing his attention on Dean’s earlobe.  Dean takes in a ragged breath and rolls them over, Cas sighing happily until he realizes that Dean has pulled away and is looming above him, on his hands and knees.
Straight-faced, Cas says. “I meant Charlie, of course.”
Cas blinks a few times. “Curry. I’ve never tried their Pad Thai.”
“Not today, anyhow.” Cas conveniently doesn’t mention that the reason he’s late has everything to do with his upstairs neighbor. Just as he was ready to go, he heard Dean leaving his apartment and he waited another ten minutes to make sure he wouldn’t run into him anywhere.
what’s up?
Dean types in the password and then gets up so that Cas can navigate to the proper file.
Dean: Heya Cas, just FYI there was a typo in the latest memo unless you actually meant social fistancing and lemme tell you that’s gonna take some true interoffice cooperation.
“You want me to get Benny to pull the flatbed in?”
“What do you consider real college?”
His mother doesn’t say anything but her eyes are warm with concern.
“Something told me you wouldn’t mind.”
Their server returns just then to clear the dishes and Cas never does get an answer.
“I think maybe it was just a tummy ache.” Cas almost winces, knowing his choice of words makes her sound like an actual baby, but Dean doesn’t seem to notice.
The red ones.
After teasing him with the tip a few more times, Cas lets him have the head and Dean licks and sucks at it urgently, waiting for it to be taken away again.  When Cas inevitably pulls back, Dean makes a needy sound he isn’t proud of, but then Cas repositions himself, scooting a little closer so that he can push all the way into Dean’s mouth.  Now Cas goes back to using both hands to pin him down and Dean moans as he works the shaft with his tongue, taking it in as deeply as he can, the denim of Cas’s jeans brushing against his face.   He can tell that Cas is holding back, resisting the urge to thrust deeply and that makes Dean even more eager to please.
“So, time with family literally drove you to drink, huh?”
The next day he mans up and heads to his original location. The only sign of what he did there are the skid marks cutting across the parking lot from when he pulled in and stomped on the brakes. He imagines his team sweeping up the broken glass and shattered plastic as they worked to put the parking lot right before the garage opened for business the next morning. He’s beyond grateful for the way they’ve cleaned up the mess he’d made, but there’s no avoiding those angry black marks, solid proof of the out of control rage that coursed through his body that night. Heart pounding, Dean sits behind the wheel of the loaner and realizes again how close he came to dying. Had Jody not been there…  he has no reason to think Crowley would have hesitated otherwise. As one of Alastair’s cronies, he’s probably still pissed he had to reholster his unfired weapon. Before he lets himself get carried away with that line of thinking, he practices his breathing and does his grounding exercise, touching a bunch of different surfaces in the sedan. He hates this car, hates all the ways it’s not the Impala, but he did that to himself and it turns out that noting the marked differences in the things he touches serves to ground him pretty effectively. Finally ready, he makes his way around to the back door of the building to let himself in. He walks through the garage bays, greeting people quickly as he goes. Benny catches his eye and gives him a cocked eyebrow in a look that asks
“Remind me never to introduce the two of you.”
Dean had never been a baby person—they were too fragile, too needy, but he’d gazed at Henry nestled in Eileen’s arms, swaddled tightly in a blanket and wearing a tiny hat, and something inside of him cracked open.
There should be some reason this isn’t a good idea, but Cas can’t think of any, not when Dean is looking at him with those clear green eyes. “Sure, I can do that.”
“Seasonal depression?”
“No way,” Cas says.
He leaves the door open, but she stays there sleeping while he cleans up from breakfast and goes to brush his teeth. When he comes back out of the bedroom with his boots on, he finds her still in the middle of the rug.
It isn’t until his mother takes his arm that the spell is broken. “All right, Castiel. Shall we?”
“I’m glad you’re home, honey.” His mother at last begins to get out of the car.
“It’s...personal.”
Dean whips his head up. “Was it that obvious?”
“Funny how your feminism wanes when there’s heavy lifting to be done,” Cas says, raising one eyebrow.
He barely gets a break before his body is on fire again, needing, wanting,
When he and Dean had last spoken, that morning they’d come back from being at the emergency vet all night, he’d been so exhausted that he could barely see straight, much less think. That next day had been awful, but he’d managed to put the brakes on his spiraling thinking, getting himself up and out of bed and regaining some control. They were all small things...getting a shower, drinking some water, talking to his brother...tiny acts of self-care that put him back on the right track.
“Okay,” Cas said.
With his keys in his hand, Dean moves toward his car, ready to shut himself inside, drive home, and lick his wounds. He should be used to this by now, to the way he always manages to become his own worst enemy, sabotaging relationships of all sorts. At least Dean will be the one leaving this time, that’ll make for a pleasant change. He thinks back to his first days in Linden, and the annoyance he’d felt at everyone knowing his name and his business even before he’d stepped foot in the city limits. He should’ve kept to those initial instincts, keeping to himself so that he could finish his job and get the hell out of here. Instead, he’s made a drunken spectacle of himself. After he’s gone, the people here will probably be telling that story for years to come.
“Nothing steady. She was sick a lot.” Charlie picked up her empty cup, then set it down again.  “Dean took a job at a factory in Wichita.”
instead so he decides not to push his luck. He sits up and lets his head hang, trying to look repentant.
“No,” Dean says honestly. “I keep getting flashes of like, light or something though.”
“Food,” Henry announces as he approaches them.
There’s a moment that seems to stretch forever while Dean only stares at him. “All this time?” Dean lets the sign lower. “All this time it was you?”
, Dean tries to break the tension.
“You don’t think it helps me out, too?” He pats his stomach. “First off, I don’t need to be eating all these leftovers. Second of all, it classes the joint up to have a writer hanging around.”
“I can’t even imagine. I’m so sorry, Dean. So sorry that happened to you.”
With one last thought of gratitude, Cas neatly folds the t-shirt. “Other than that, it doesn’t spark joy. So it’s got to go. ”
“Morning, sunshine.”
“I understand,” Cas repeated, fully aware that Benny’s words were more promise—maybe even bordering on a threat—than pure information.
“Any friend of Dean’s is a friend of ours. You’re the writer fella, right?”
” She shakes her head. “He did the textbook guilty thing.”
“An apparating cat would be awesome,” Jack says, while Rowena gets right to the point.
“First of all, this isn’t a blizzard.”
“No?” Dean tucked a pillow behind his back. “I thought you liked Daphne?”
Dean blinks at his screen.
Me, writing this fic: I am so sorry, Dean.
“Both.”
His father asks Cas how work is going, but before Cas can answer, his mother goes off on a tangent about the daughter of a family friend who has used her English degree to go to law school and has Cas ever considered that? Cas twists his napkin in his lap and repeats yet again that he’s happy with his choices. At least they’ve stopped trying to fix him up with women. He takes a long swallow of his champagne when they swing their attention on to Gabe instead, asking why he hasn’t brought Kali with him to dinner.
“You know how cats are. The more you try with them, the more they scoff at you.”
“Oh.” He lets his hands fall to his sides. “Oh, ok.” Cas reaches out a hand and Dean grabs onto it. His palm is warm and strong and Dean lets him pull him up to his feet. “Thanks,” he says belatedly, still holding onto Cas as he gets himself steadied. When he lets go, Cas puts an easy hand on his shoulder and helps steer him to the passenger seat. Once he’s buckled in, Dean can’t help but look into the back, remembering the lonely hopelessness he’d felt the last time he was picked up after a bar fight. So much frustration and pain had exploded out of him, greased by too much shitty whiskey and his own stupid mouth.
Cas kisses him.  “I promise.”
and he may be drunk but not enough to think those words will do anything other than make things worse. He retrieves her coat and accompanies her downstairs, waiting in awkward silence with her until the driver pulls up.
Dean laughed. “Now you’re talking.”
Cas’s eyes go wide and Dean watches the bob of his throat as he swallows. “Tempting, but it would require changing the camera set up and I’m not willing to wait that long. You may, however, take out your cock.”
. She turned away and walked back down to her seat, where some of the other moms were pretending not to watch.
“Our hope is that your thought processes begin to make new connections so that you can think about things that happened in the past without the emotions so closely attached to it. That will get easier to do as you continue to process your trauma, but sometimes it’ll get harder again.”
He’s mesmerized by the destruction unfolding at his own hand, so completely focused on his task even as he sees the red and blue flashing lights of a police car pulling up. Dean doesn’t care. He keeps swinging at the car. He’s not so far gone that he can’t appreciate the symmetry of moment. Those recurring dreams he used to have, of clawing through the twisted wreckage of a car, before being pinned down by a police officer. Maybe it wasn’t a metaphor after all.
He sits at the table in front of his plate of cooling eggs. “I didn’t know,” he says plaintively to no one. “But it makes sense you need a tongue like that for grooming your fur.”
“Uncle Dean,” he whines, as Dean nearly drags him along the sidewalk. “Uncle Dean, we’re going the wrong way.”
Dean had forgotten about that. He had done pretty well in school up to that point, despite starting at new ones all the time and having to look out for his brother. “You couldn’t have known.”
“I’m pretty sure what Cas’s mom saw today was a successful businessman who her son has been spending a lot of time with. Someone who talks about you enough that she was willing to drive all the way across town to meet you in person.”
A moment later he sees movement. Castiel slides the door open just enough to let himself through, his head turned to look back into the apartment before he closes it behind him.
Cas has seen Dean with plenty of customers before. He has an effortless charm even with the difficult ones, like the frustrated woman the other day. Today, though, he seems off, like he’s reading from a training manual. Cas doesn’t know what’s going on--maybe mothers make him nervous--but he knows he needs to step in.
The visit to the coffee shop was awful. While Rowena was as kind and friendly as ever, Dean could barely look at him. Everything he said was terse and dismissive, like he couldn’t wait for Cas to get out of his sight. It told Cas everything he needed to know, and, while he was proud of himself for working up the nerve to go inside, it reinforced the idea that it would be the last time.
“I know I’ve gotten better at it but sometimes I still feel bad when I need more from Cas. Like if I have a nightmare and need to wake him up to help me settle back down.”
“Absolutely not.” He presses his lips together. “I mean I’ve considered going but the wonderful time is, of course, out of the question.”
Dean hesitates, but he’s cold and stiff and bleary. His bed feels better than it ever has in his entire life, and the fact that there’s six feet of hot cop stretched out next to him is definitely part of the reason. Cas tugs the covers up over both of them. “Better?”
Dean’s soft smile turns into something hungrier. “I’m not done yet.” He threads their fingers together and leads him to the bedroom. Once there, he strokes two fingertips at the open collar of Cas’s shirt. “I couldn’t keep my eyes off you tonight. To see you standing there, to hear you reading your own words, your voice so strong and confident.” He unbuttons one button, then another. “I couldn’t wait to get you home and all to myself again.”

"Dean? Are you with me sweet boy?" Cas started pulling at his hair slightly harder than before, the tiny pinpricks of pain grounding Dean and pulling him back down.
The stairs. They were creaking. They weren't staying downstairs to work, they were coming up. To their room, to where Dean was. They would see him. It would be okay. He could get what he needed.
Ughhhh They're too cute.
"You went on holiday," Dean started slowly, wringing his hands together nervously.
And that's a wrap!!
"Just… my past," Dean shrugged, his hands so shaky that his signs must have been barely readable. "I would be dead by now, if Cas hadn't found me."
“There’s nothing wrong with a little bit of sweet talking,” Dean replied, adding in a flirty wink just for the fun of it.
"Good boy," Cas whispered, and Dean felt something inside of him swell. He was good. He managed it. He made Cas proud.
"Set the table please sweet boy," Cas said, his voice slightly calmer now that they were in the kitchen, but he was clearly not happy about how Dean had been treating himself, he'd just decided there were more pressing matters to attend to first. Dean knew how his Dom worked, that was why he always came to Cas instead of looking for an anonymous hook up. He could trust Cas to look after him, and to prioritise sorting it all out over getting angry.
(See the end of the chapter for
By the time he put the cushion down and settled himself into the kneeling pose Cas preferred for at the table, Cas had finished plating up his food and was walking over to the table. Dean quickly tucked his chin down to his chest so couldn't see how full the plate was, but he hoped there was enough because now that his mind was starting to settle, he was becoming more and more aware of how hungry he was.
and Dean wished he could find it within himself to get excited about that. Cas needed to go, and if the kiss lingered for longer than it normally did, then that was just because Dean liked kissing his Dom. He wasn't feeling anxious, even if Cas was going to be gone for the entire day, and Dean was going to be home alone.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Better to ask than to bring a bad one,” Dean agreed, before he actually thought his answer over. “There isn’t a bad flavor of pie, of course, but if there was.” Eileen nodded, managing to pretend that he’d made sense for a whole ten seconds before her face slipped into a smile.
(See the end of the chapter for
Charlie had turned up on the second day. She didn't know what was happening, Dean hadn't told her and she wasn't one to assume, so she just forced him to drink some water, and tried to get him to eat as well. She didn't manage to get any food in him, but the water helped.
Anyway!! Sorry about my babbling. I can't believe this is over (for now) but it's been lovely going on this journey with you! Thank you so much for reading! 💚💙💚💙
Hello again! Is it raining in here... I think it must be...
I hope you enjoyed! If you did, please comment to let me know!
He took off his flannel and his top, along with his socks, but left his jeans on, not wanting to give the wrong impression. He was here because of his biological need, not because of anything else.
If you feel the need to throw things, please stick to cushions and plushies, and I'll see y'all Wednesday!!
With his clean hand, Cas strokes a thumb across Dean’s cheekbone and then over his lower lip. “Ready?”
arguing with me.”
“I--It’s not like that,” Cas says. “We’re friends. Mom, stop looking at me like that.”
to be able to take care of the people in his life so who’s to say that’s not exactly what he’s doing?
Finally he shifts around on the bed to meet Dean’s eyes.
“I...yeah.” He pulled away to look at Cas. “Not like this though.”
Whatever.
“Mom, what?” Dean caught his eye, doing his best not to laugh. Cas was seventeen and Dean would be in a month, but it felt like they were twelve again, straddling bikes, anxious to go buy candy while his mother gave them last minute instructions on what time they should be home.
Dean laughs. “I bet.” He gives her one more scritch between her ears. “But she’s okay?”
Without thinking, Dean reaches out to smack him on the shoulder. It’s exceedingly firm, but he tries not to fixate on that. “Awesome. So, we’re having a sign-making party tomorrow at the coffee shop. Charlie said they could provide the posterboard and we can all bring markers or whatever.”
“Well, first I tried not to laugh, but then I decided to play it up. I argued back and accused them of not trusting me. And when that didn’t work, I accused them of not trusting
While his sign is nothing out of the ordinary, his grin is effervescent. “Heya, Cas.”
He’s dressed nicely, in a deep blue sweater that makes his eyes seem even more blue than usual. He looks unhappy, though, which is why Dean ventures a guess. Nodding at his outfit he asks, “You have to see your parents again?”
“Not a thing, I swear.” Dean’s somehow offended that Cas would think he bought the cat’s affection by bribing her with food. Nonetheless, his mind whirs wondering what sort of treats cats like. “Look,” he says, huffing out a sigh like he’s never in his life been so inconvenienced. “If it’ll make her happy to come say hi in the mornings, I
“Yes, but he never does, right?”
, and Cas reached over to smack his leg.
Standing in front of the mirror, he looks fine.
It’s comfortable and domestic and more than Dean could have dreamed of.
otherwise occupied,” he finishes.  “I’ll take care of it.”
As he comes down, Dean realizes he’s smiling. No doubt it’s a dopey, blissed out look, but he did it. He might’ve brush burned his dick, but that orgasm feels like it started at the tips of his toes and flowed through his entire body.
"Ohhhh," Dean hummed, clicking his fingers as though he'd just figured some great mystery out. "So that's why you were at the lockers this morning! Normally I don't see you, so I thought it was odd you were there today."
Dean didn't notice when the plate was cleared, nor did he notice when Cas offered him the water. He drank it, but his consciousness wasn't aware of it. He didn't notice the passage of time, while Cas sat there and waited, still running his fingers though Dean's hair.
(See the end of the chapter for
Hope you enjoy!! It's time for some aftermath!
Cas had promised he'd be back by the early evening, so it wasn't even like Dean was going to have to sleep alone, and this definitely wasn't the longest time they'd ever been apart, but that knowledge wasn't settling him in the slightest. His Dom was gone, Cas had left him, and that was all his brain was bothering latching onto.
If any of you are reading this and wondering if you're about to get smut, I'm sorry to say the answer is no, not in this story. I have no idea why not. I've written some smutty one shots that will be posted at some point, I do write smut, it just never felt right for this story/universe.
First date next chapter!! I look forward to seeing you for that!!
He heard a quiet gasp come from behind him, shock and something else - something positive? - portrayed in just that one noise. He wanted to turn around, look at Cas and see the look on his face, but he hadn't been told he was allowed to look around, so he wasn't going to.
: Of course.
Next chapter: Things get even weirder.
I hope you enjoy!!!
"See you then," Dean agreed, and the way Cas peered at him told him he hadn't fully managed to hide his regretful sigh. There was promise in Cas' eyes, a promise of
"Sorry Sir," Dean breathed out, forcing himself to emerge completely and shake himself back into awareness. He sat up straight, shifting into the perfect kneeling position.
This week has gone... incredibly quickly so far. I swear I last updated this story yesterday, but apparently not because here we are!
He sighed quietly, turning to the door to walk downstairs. He hadn't been told he was allowed to stand around thinking before going downstairs, and he wasn't going to go against an order this quickly.
"Grab your cushion please, place it to the right of my chair, and then kneel and wait for me to bring our food over."
Anyway!! That's all I have to say!! If you read all of that, congrats I'm proud. Thanks for being here!! And I'll see you at the next update!!
Hope that was worth the wait!! See you on Sunday!!
I forgot how much I loved you guys, and this story.
He shifted his position, making sure he was perfect. Straightening his back which had started slouching some time in the last hour, centering his balance, placing his hands, palm up, on his thighs, lifting his head, lowering his gaze. It wasn't perfect, it was barely good enough - Dean was barely good enough - but the door was starting to open and it would have to do.
Cas shrugged. He hadn't even been aware that Dean knew of his existence, and now he was apparently noticing whether he went to his locker while Dean was there or not?
It probably didn't need saying, but I just thought I'd say it anyway. <3
"Dean, I need you back here properly so I can talk to you." Dean hummed against the leg under his face, slowly returning to reality. He knew he had no chance of coming back fully, but it would be better than before, and hopefully he would still be back enough to listen to whatever Cas wanted to say. It sounded serious, and Dean was instantly worried about what was about to happen.
Somehow, none of that happened.
Dean nodded, settling against Cas' side in a way which was a bit closer to domestic than submissive. Neither of them argued though, and Dean could still the fuzziness on the edge of his mind, softening the edges of everything.
Eileen put a finger to her chin, miming being deep in thought. “Aren’t we supposed to be making pies? We should probably continue with that.”
See you guys on Sunday!
When he got downstairs Cas was sitting on the couch, a cushion between his legs. It was clear where he wanted Dean, and he happily sunk back into his kneeling position, laying his head on Cas' knee and allowing himself to relax.
They're too adorable for their own good sometimes, I swear.
Thanks for reading!!
I hope you liked this chapter as much as I did (they're just so soft. I know I wrote this, but I adore them)
"Alright then sweet boy," Cas said, running a gentle hand down Dean's chest, "I'm going to put all of this is the kitchen, please go to the sitting room and put on the bee documentary I have recorded."
"Nughhhhh," Dean complained, "I don't wanna." He knew from the fact he could talk that he was already out enough that there was no going back, but that wasn't going to stop him from complaining.
Cas sighs.  “Maybe you shouldn’t.”
He and Cas share pleased looks as he leaves the room. “Maybe all the frisbee throwing helped.”
Dean grins; this is old, familiar territory. “So, that was the only reason you wanted to kiss me?”
He calls Rufus, who tells him in no uncertain terms to get rid of whatever he doesn’t want. Walking from room to room, Dean thinks maybe he should see if the people in town want some of the things. Ella might want the dishes. He’s got half a bag of grain he could donate to one of the other people who looks after Georgina. Maybe Matthew or somebody would like his duplicate tools.
The next morning he opens his door as usual but Cas's door remains closed. Dean goes about his morning, making his breakfast and taking the bit of chicken out of the fridge. No point in keeping it. He stops short of pitching it though, leaving the bowl on the counter to deal with after breakfast. He's a few bites into his own meal when she appears.
“All right, first off, how about you put that down before someone gets hurt.”
. If you sent the same flower but in yellow, it meant
got your sign ready?
“That’s not the point.” That may, in fact, be a lot of the point. “I just feel like they think they know me, but if they really knew me, they’d know that this isn’t me.”
Cas stands close beside him on the porch, lets Dean lean on him when his balance wavers as he tries to get his keys out of his pocket. He drops them onto the porch floor. “I can do it,” he insists, as Cas starts to bend down for them. It takes him a couple of tries and he has to close one eye before he can line things up properly, but he eventually gets the door unlocked. “Ta-da!” he says, mostly to himself.

Comments and kudos mean a lot to me!!
I hope it's worth the wait!!

For some reason—he was going to blame this one on stress—he had just imagined leaving the pie in Dean's locker for him to find.
Comments and kudos are my lifeblood.

“You’d really do that to me? You’d really turn on another Sub like that?”
Dean had been worried it would be awkward. This was the first time they’d been together without either Sam or Cas around, Dean wasn’t great at signing—or remembering to always look at Eileen when he spoke—and Cas being so far away was throwing him off enough that he probably wouldn’t be great company around anyone, even someone he’d known most of his life. There were so many reasons why this would go wrong, and Dean would end up making Eileen hate him, and things would be awkward forever.
Thanks to everyone that commented! I probably said this at the weekend, but yeah, it really does mean a lot to me!!
Occasionally Cas offered Dean a bite of pie, which he happily accepted, but mostly he just rested his head on Cas' knee and let himself drift, settled in the knowledge that his Dom was back, and he wasn't going anywhere for the rest of the weekend.
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
"Thank you sweet boy," Cas said, smiling over at him, a sadness in his words contrasting to the smile. "Now can you please tell me what happened? How did it get this bad without you doing anything about it?"
"What do you mean?"
"I'm sorry," Dean whispered, "I'm sorry for getting it so wrong. I'm sorry for-"
"I d-didn't want to be a burden." Dean could feel tears start to well up in his eyes, and he knew he had to say it now before he was unable to say anything more. "You went away and while you were there I realized how much of a burden I was on you, so I tried to set you free, but no one else knows what I am, and it just kept on getting worse." He couldn't say anything more, having to put all his effort into breathing and blinking back tears. He'd hidden the fact he was a Sub from pretty much everyone he knew. Not even Sam knew, and Cas only knew because this wasn't the first time he had dragged him off the edge. Cas kept on encouraging Dean to tell someone, but he didn't push. He knew it was a difficult subject for Dean, and that he hid it for a reason.
Cas happily obliges and the sound of his palm against Dean’s bare skin echoes nicely, thanks in part to the gleaming wood floors of their bedroom. Dean kisses along Cas’s stomach, palming his fully hard cock through his boxers as he dips his tongue beneath the waistband. He shakes his head in mock disappointment. “Why are you still wearing clothes?”
“Tell you what. How about I introduce you to the best grilled cheese you’ve ever eaten. You’ll even get to sit in a real chair at a real table while you eat it. Seriously, Cas, how do you not have a place to sit and eat?”
“But what do I
“Like, the way I always felt safe with you. Like I could be myself.” Cas could hear Dean moving around his kitchen as he fixed himself a snack before he had to leave for work. “I thought it was because we were such good friends, but when I discovered I was bi, I realized I’d had feelings for you that I hadn’t understood at the time.”
They take that in for a long silent moment before Cas says, “Is that the better news?”
Nodding, Dean passes the papers over to Cas. “She gave me some exercises to try if it happens again. Actually, she said I should practice these when I’m feeling fine.”
The first time Cas shows up with his messenger bag slung over his shoulder and his hands full of takeout coffee, Dean’s helping a customer, but he watches as Cas stands outside the door trying to figure out how to pull it open. As Cas cradles one cup to his chest--a hot one, not the iced--in order to free a hand, Dean’s instinct is to rush over there and help him. All he needs is a workplace accident on his premises. Before he can, though, a customer is leaving at the exact right moment and holds the door open.
Dean stops his pacing. “June?”
They lie in silence for a long time, long enough that he thinks maybe Cas has fallen back asleep. Then he softly says, “Have you changed your mind?”
He feels the flutter of Cas’s eyelashes against his skin. “I don’t think that’s how it works.”
“No,” he tells her in a hoarse voice. “You know you’re not allowed up here. And these are sharp.” Gently, he sets her back down on the floor, getting such a head rush when he straightens up that he has to grab on to the edge of the counter when his vision tunnels. “I’m going back to bed. You behave or I’ll have Dean take your food right back to the store.” As if she can understand him, she follows him back to the bedroom and assumes her spot by his shoulder. “Thank you for the tail hug,” he murmurs into his pillow when she tucks it under his chin.
Cas feels himself squint. “Is that a thing?”
Reluctantly, Dean lets Cas go into his own apartment by himself, promising to be back as soon as he can. He drives the short distance to the market and hurries in, his head down against the whirling snow. There are plenty of cars in the lot, townspeople stocking up on things before the full brunt of the storm hits.
“Ohhhh, I see. So, you hoisted him up?”
“If you crash my car I swear to God I’ll have divorce papers drawn up immediately.” There’s no heat there, other than the one pooling low in his belly.
“Dean won’t care either way, I’m sure,” he said. “Here, how about this?”  He picked up her purse from where it sat by her feet and attached the pin to the strap.
“Can you call her up here so I can meet her?”
“Anything else?”
He’d been trying to recapture something that had never existed, something he’d built up in his mind. If he thought he could safely drive away this minute he would. He considered gathering up his things and sleeping in his car, but even the thought exhausted him. He splashed some cold water on his face. Maybe he could straighten things out in the morning. Maybe once they were both sober, they could talk this out like the adults they now were. This entire trip was about wrapping up the loose ends of their last parting. Cas wasn’t about to add to them.
“Dean, you know perfectly well we haven’t had those in years.”
Dean stis for a long time in silence and Cas forces himself to be still, to simply be present with him. He’s not sure if he’s giving Dean time to gather his thoughts or just letting him know he isn’t alone, but he knows the comfort it brings when his therapist does it. She’s referred to it as “mortal support”--when all you need from another person is that they be there with you.
“I know you, Cas, and you wouldn’t be here, asking me to have dinner with you instead of hiding out in your own apartment if you didn’t think there was something to it.” She wrinkles up her nose in consideration. “You know what’s interesting…”
Dean knows exactly what he’s asking; he wonders if Chrysler does, too. There seems to be a longer than usual pause before the next reply. Or maybe he’s imagining that.
Officer Novak kneels down to be at her level. He studies her seriously for a moment, then lays one big hand on top of her helmet, shifting it back and forth. Once he’s done that, she tips her head back so that he can examine the way it’s buckled under her chin. “Perfect, Allison. Now let me see what I have.” He straightens up to pull more things out of his pocket as she hops up and down. “Kittens or frogs today?”
At that, Cas gives him a level look. “No. Just a plain coffee, please. To go.”
The room is abuzz with people and Dean has never been so thankful to have Cas at his side. Despite the effort he’s made in breaking away from his parents, it’s clear that he was brought up to handle situations like these, and he navigates the setting with ease and charm. Unlike Dean, he never ends up shoving a puff pastry into his mouth so that he has a free hand to shake. Although he’s got complete control over Dean in some ways, Cas never speaks for Dean, letting him introduce himself and share his accomplishment as they make their way through the crowd.
Jesus, where did that come from?
Dean settles into the chair next to him and they wait. Cas dozes, stirring when his phone chimes with a new text. Dean grabs it from the bedside table and silences it, but it continues to buzz on and off with texts and calls. He doesn’t read them, but a quick glance shows that half the town is sending their good wishes to him. Dean watches him sleep, staring at his profile and marking the reassuring rise and fall of his chest. He watches him until the doctor comes back to announce that there are no broken ribs, just substantial bruising.
Cas flaps the towel under the smoke detector in an attempt to disperse the smoke. “I don’t own any chairs.”
“You’re preaching to the choir. Dean had too much dumped on him. He decided it was up to him to save everyone.”
“Not a problem. Be back tomorrow?”
“You talked about not liking to be alone. It may seem silly, but these visitors to my yard… they keep me company. They have routines and habits and definite personalities. And the feeders and birdbath need to be cleaned and kept filled. It’s something small but it gives me some purpose on days when I might not otherwise feel like I have one.”
Anna responds with a mild retching sound which breaks the tension, especially when Cas’s laugh comes out as an ungainly snort. “I’ll check in with you later,” she promises.
“Oh my god,” Dean says. “We are not having this conversation. I was there. I know what happened. I just don’t want Sam to get hurt.”
“No.” He glances over her shoulder to see that Dean is just now ordering. “It’s Lady Marmalade.”
He double checks that her water and food are still in good shape and then retrieves the groceries, coming back inside as quietly as he can. In the kitchen, he starts to relax for the first time in hours. Here, closed up in the house against the now-howling wind, with Cas safely in his care, Dean thinks he might actually be able to focus, and he sets to making soup.
Cas wanted to say a lot of things at that moment. Things like
He forces himself to drink a big glass of water before he even picks up his phone. There’s nothing. No missed calls, no texts. He picks up the paperwork from the vet to find their number and, heart in his throat, calls them. He fumbles over his words as he tries to explain who he is and why he’s calling, and his brain threatens to add it to the list, but he pushes through and is connected to a tech who tells him that she’s recovering comfortably and that he can come pick her up in the morning. Gratefully, he thanks her, promising to be there tomorrow.
“Look, Cas. I would never try to change you. But what I would do is support and encourage you in your attempts to get what you want.”
“Jesus. I know people have multiples all the time, but I can’t even imagine.” Cas eyes Dean’s mug, then gets up to refill both their cups.
That he would release one more person from the role in his life they didn't want to play.
Next chapter is the final one! I look forward to seeing you there!
I hope you enjoy the chapter!!
OOOH! I am so excited about posting this chapter! This one (or maybe the next one) is my favorite chapter from this fic, and I've been looking forward to sharing them with you!
Sometimes literally.
Dean made a silent promise to himself to talk to Sam as soon as he could, to find Eileen's favorite thing, so he could get the information required to give Eileen the same thing she'd given him.
"Hey," he signed slowly, "at least we have pie."
Dean leaned forwards, pulling the food and the fingers into his mouth. He could do so many things with Cas’ dingers in his mouth, but this wasn't anything sexual, so instead he just took his food, and leaned back to eat it.
"It's okay," Eillen interrupted his thoughts, her hands not signing along as instead she used them to grip Dean's shoulders and help ground him. It was only then that Dean noticed he was shaking, and he desperately wished Cas was there with him. He ducked his head to press his collar into his neck, reminding himself that it was there, that he was safe, that he was Cas'. "What were you thinking about?"
Hopefully I'll see you then!!
: Are you being good while I'm away?
Hey y'all! I hope you've all been doing okay!!
(See the end of the chapter for
On that note! See you on Wednesday! :D
"Follow me," Cas said shortly, his entire body taunt as he stood up and started walking out the room. Dean quickly followed him, ignoring how his head spun and his vision went a bit fuzzy. His Dom was angry at him. He had to obey as well as he physically could to make Cas happy again.
I hope you enjoy the chapter! It's time for the boys to get a break I think.
"Come on, come back to me sweet boy," Cas was muttering. His gentle words made Dean feel slightly better, but it was nothing compared with the gentle float when he was in Subspace.
"And why didn't you use a cushion?"
Dean did understand, he really did. His mind knew that Cas was his Dom, which meant his body and instincts were more than happy to complain when he was too far away. He was glad to see Eileen having similar problems—which made him feel kinda mean, seeing as this really wasn't fun—because it meant it was just a normal sub thing. This wasn't Dean being weak, or useless, or needy. It was just how his biology wired him.
Hello again!! Just wanted to let y'all know, you guys are the literal best. <3 <3
Thanks for reading!!! I hope you enjoyed this little bonus whatever this is!!
I'm tired, so if you see any mistakes, please point them out so I can fix them!!
Biology sucked sometimes.
Cas sighed, sounding tired. "Dean, that wasn't handling it. You used to pick up a random hook-up to deal with the need for touch, and pick up the bottle for all the other symptoms." Dean knew that what he was saying was true, but he still hated it. He still hated that he was this weak little bitch who needed someone else to look after him to stop him from falling into the abyss of biology.
Thanks to you all for the love you've shown me in the comments. Y'all make writing a pleasure!
Yes that did just happen.
“You're just trying to sweet talk me,” Eileen laughed, gathering all the pastry ends together into a ball.
The second he was allowed to, Dean looked up. Cas looked exactly how he always did, business suit still on from his day job, even though he had abandoned his blazer. His shirt sleeves were rolled up, flaunting the solid muscles and the small vertical line on his left wrist, the same size as Dean's, but representing the polar opposite. Castiel looked tired, a relaxed smile which didn't quite look real on his face. When Dean looked up even more, he saw concern in Cas' eyes.
That was okay.
OOooooooooh!! Hey y'all! It is here! (some of) The aftermath of last chapter!
I hope this ending is what it deserves, and I'll see you again in the end notes.
Hello guys!!!
"Hey, Cas," Dean grinned, climbing out the car and walking over to stand just next to Cas. "Fancy seeing you here! This is your car, I take it?"
Hello!! It is me again, I have returned! Now, writing this chapter was... a bitch. It was one of those chapters that wanted nothing to do with what I was doing. HOWEVER. Once I got all the words typed out, I think this became one of my favorite chapters.
"Though actually, if you're going to worry about me, I should probably do the same for you. Is Sam being good?"
Yeah... I'm with Dean on this one... I don't think that's what Cas is leaning towards...
So yeah... thank you! It means a lot to me!!
He could wait.
"Sorry, did I break you?" Eileen laughed, her eyes soft with what felt like understanding. Dean's instinct was to assume it wasn't, there was no way she could understand, but the thing was… that instinct was wrong. Eileen was also a Sub, and Dean didn't know what her home life was before she met Sam. She very easily
It was still early in the morning, seven am—way too early for Dean to be awake when he didn't have work—but Cas and Sam were both taking the train west for some kind of conference that their works had signed them both up for—as far as Dean knew it was a complete coincidence that they were both going, and they hadn't known until Sam had brought it up a couple of weeks before—and that meant they had to leave early. The original plan that Cas' job had suggested had included leaving late last night, and getting back early tomorrow, but Cas had refused, saying that he wasn't going to leave his Sub for that long. Dean appreciated it, he hated being a burden, but he really didn't like being alone for that long. He knew Cas would never leave him, but after all the time he had spent with John… he couldn't help how his sub brain reacted to being left.
"Yes Sir," Dean managed to say just before Cas left the room, leaving him alone with his thoughts. He could no longer think that this was a mistake, not when he was feeling more settled than he had in weeks, his instincts starting to calm now that he had his - no, he needed to set him free. After this. One last time. Then he would free him. - Now that he had a dom with him.
Castiel started gently running his fingers through Dean's hair. He didn't say anything, just let Dean sit in silence, his presence enough to calm Dean's troubled thoughts and allow him to just float.
Here it is, the chapter you've all been waiting about three days for.
I just love a good bit of BAMF Cas.
“Yeah, sure,” Dean nodded, awkwardly signing along. He’d gotten a lot better, but he still struggled a lot more than Sam and Cas. He stepped backwards to let her through, waving her into the sitting room as he relocked the front door, before sitting on the armchair. Eileen folded herself onto the couch, managing to look right at home, even though Dean knew he would have been feeling horribly awkward had their situations been reversed.
See y'all Sunday! :D
"But… Cas is your friend too? Do you not trust him?" Dean was incredibly confused. None of this was making sense. Eileen and Cas got on so well! And now she was questioning how well he was treating Dean?
That's my excuse for not updating this earlier today.
Hey guys!!!
Thanks so much for reading!!! I hope you're enjoying so far!!
I'll see you Wednesday for the final chapter!
"Dean!" Cas sounded stern, the harsh single word enough to jolt Dean out of his thoughts. "I didn't tell you to stand around, I told you to put your cushion next to my chair."
"Yes," Cas replied, "it's the reason I had to take this bus this morning."
He was going to pick the lock.
"Oh, yes," Eileen sighed after taking her first bite, "this is delicious."
: Pie is always good.
Hello again y'all! It's been a long couple of days since last chapter, so I'm excited to be able to share the next chapter! I hope you like it. :)
Gabe has returned and has a fair few questions about what has happened while he was gone. Dean can't answer a single one truthfully, not if he wants his family to still care about him once this whole thing is over.
If you're here for this 'verse and this 'verse alone, well, as you can see it's technically over. But let's be honest here, it's not over. I love this universe so much, I'm going to need to write timestamps - stuff from after this, stuff from between the stories, who knows! I don't have any ideas yet, and I don't know when I will, but if you have anything you want to see, just leave me a prompt in a comment, and I'm sure this 'verse will bring me some inspiration before I know it.
Kudos and comments make me smile, and I hope to see y'all again soon!!!!
"Nice," Dean hummed as he slid them both into the oven, setting the timer to make sure they didn't forget to check on them.
Hmmm... I wonder how that's going to go...
Dean gripped his wrists tightly behind his back, fighting the fatigue in all of his muscles in order to stay in the correct pose. He was alone in the house, he had let himself in with the spare key from under the plant pot, and he knew no one else would know if he let his position slip, but he would know. He would know he'd been bad. He would know he had failed.
"I drank something… yesterday?" Dean said, not certain. It was hard to pay attention to the passage of time when his entire being was just focused on being good, even when there was no one there to be good for. "Maybe the day before that…"
"Sure. Though, if you ever want to come round and make another pie…" he didn't finish his sentence, but he knew Eileen understood what he was saying. He'd gotten much better with Cas, but he still struggled sometimes to say what he really wanted. When things were so perfect, he worried that asking for any more would make it all crumble around them.
With Sam gone, things just get weirder and weirder for Dean.
He supposed he could just stand around and wait for Dean to turn up, give it to him directly and-
Cas pulled Dean into a tight hug straight away, pressing a kiss against his lips as tension slipped out of both of them now they were together again.
Yeah honestly I have no idea what I'm doing rn... oh well! I hope you enjoy this chapter! (I promise it's a nice one)
"Ye'ir," Dean mumbled, rolling his head so that his face was hidden against Cas' knee, his naked chest accidently rubbing against Cas' jeans while he shifted.
And there we have it!
Thanks for reading! I hope you liked it!
"I'm glad."
Apparently Dean wasn't going to be eating on his own today. That was probably just as well, he wasn't sure he would be able to if given the choice.
That clearly wasn't going to work.
He still wasn't glad that Cas had left—and the sub part of his brain was yelling at him to keep Cas in his sight, to make sure his Dom wasn't going to abandon him permanently, to the point where he had to wrap his arms around Cas' leg to shut that part of his brain up—but at the same time he was glad to have had the chance to really get to know Eileen. It was great to have her part of his family, especially when she could properly appreciate a good pie.
“I’d be a lot more concerned if this didn’t affect you.”
Henry hops up and down. “Yes! Get a dog, Uncle Dean!
“You know it.” He’s pleased to find there’s a card reader and he takes out his credit card to slide it through. “Thought maybe I’d have to swap you some chickens or something.”
“Lumber is that way.” Cas points to the far back corner of the store but Dean stops him.
“Oh,” he says, going back to his game.
As promised, Billie is able to see him on Monday. Even though he’s feeling a bit better, Dean doesn’t argue when Cas says he’ll drive him, and Dean finds himself approaching her office with a combination of anticipation and dread. When Billie opens her office door right at the top of the hour as usual, Dean turns to Cas before he gets to his feet.
“How about your vows at least?” She smirks at them. “Gonna promise to obey?”
“And how its goal is to protect you from what’s happening in the moment.”
“Yeah.” Dean rubs a hand along the back of his neck. “Kinda. Why do you always have to make things weird?”
Charlie and Dean both laughed at that.
Dean does as he’s told, taking two handfuls of the comforter as he gets into position.  A few long moments stretch into long minutes of nothingness.  No sound from Cas, no touch, no footsteps and he’s tempted to look over his shoulder, worried that maybe Cas left the room, just left him here exposed and alone.  His heart starts to pound at the thought but he calms himself because even if Cas went away, he’ll always come back.  And even if he left, it’s because he has a reason.  And maybe the reason is for Dean to remember that.  For Dean to remind himself how much he trusts Cas.  Even when he’s naked, in nothing but a collar.
doesn’t quite seem like the right word, but it’s the closest he can get. It’s an uncomfortable truth, the fact that he’s used to saying whatever he wants and things still tend to go his way. He doesn’t want to be that guy, the one who thinks he can get by based on his good looks, but it’s something he’s got going for him. He thinks about Sam’s friends who no doubt think he’s dumb because he never went to college, but when those nerds stand around in a clump too scared even to make eye contact with a woman, Dean’s more than happy to show off his very own area of expertise.
“I dunno,” Dean says, considering. “It’s basically the same as those long white gowns you see in paintings and shit.”
Why did he ever think it was a good idea to introduce Cas and Charlie?
“If it doesn’t take you too far out of your way.”
He sits in his car, trying to work up the energy to begin the long drive back across town, knowing that the traffic that caught him off guard and left him hustling late into his meeting is only going to be worse now. He tugs at the back of his shirt which has become uncomfortably damp with sweat and considers driving off in the opposite direction, losing himself in a new part of the country where nobody knows his name and he can start fresh. He can be a plumber or a cook or literally anything that doesn’t involve writing. He hears a train in the distance and wonders if it’s really that romantic to ride the rails. Just leave it all behind, hop on a freight car, and take off for parts unknown. But like, where do you plug in your phone?
Dean knows what he’s asking and he moves a bit closer to Bobby. This, Henry doesn’t need to know. He can be sheltered from the fact that there’s an actual goddamn monster living in their town. “Things are coming along, at least according to Jody. There’s a lot she can’t tell me and I get that. If Alastair were to get wind of the fact that people are looking into him, it could ruin everything. But we do have some next steps. Some stuff I need to do.”
Filled with the comfort of Cas’s love, Dean realizes what else he needs. Taking his husband’s hand, he leads him toward the kitchen where Jody’s dinner awaits. “I’m starving. But also I have questions. Does your offer only stand for this particular situation? Like, what about if I get cut off in traffic? What if the cashier won’t accept my coupons at the grocery store? Are you going to smite every last one of them?”
“Are you sure you’re up to this?”
Cas grabs the photo away. “Let me guess, you’ve never worn anything other than jeans and plaid your entire life.” He has a momentary mental image of Dean as a newborn baby, swaddled in a plaid blanket.
Dean will deny that shriek until his dying day. He’ll deny that he scooted along the counter until he could safely put his feet back on the floor out of reach of the cat. He’s not scared of it, he tells himself, he was just taken by surprise. He and Sam had never had pets as kids. His mother had scraped by trying to keep them fed, and there had been no question of another mouth to feed, no matter how Sam had begged for a dog. Just another deprivation to blame on John Winchester, Dean thinks with smug satisfaction. When he’d walked out, leaving the three of them on their own, he’d taught Dean many lessons, one of which had been not to waste money and affection on an animal.
Cas draws in a deep breath. “I’m sorry if I somehow offended you earlier. I don’t mean to take up Charlie’s time--or yours--when you’re working. The last thing I want is to get in the way.”
“Can we talk?” Cas asks, softly like Dean might snap at him again.
“Dean, look at me. Can you try, please?”
“You guess?”
Cas doesn’t even spare him a glance, levelling Dean with one eyebrow raised, voice bitter.  “Yes, Dean. Is there a problem?”
Dean washes the toys one by one then lays them on the bedside table. In the interest of easy clean up, he takes the old bedding from the box as well and spreads it over their bed.
Cas hugs him, letting Dean bury his face against his chest while he reaches down to unlock the cuffs. He helps Dean off the floor, instructing him to sit on the edge of the bed while he gets him some water. Dean leans against him when he returns, and lets Cas help hold the cup as he dutifully drinks it. When Cas is satisfied, he lets Dean flop down onto the bed. Stripping off his clothes at last, Cas lies beside him, rubbing his shoulders and lifting Dean’s wrists to his lips one at a time to cover them with kisses. Dean snuggles up against all that warm, bare skin and, with Cas holding him tightly, he falls asleep.
I'm doing my part to make these difficult days a little bit easier, so if you would like to send me a Porndemic Prompt, you can DM me
He adds the winking emoji before closing out the chat.
There’s something so soft in Cas’s face when he says it that Dean can’t find it in him to dismiss it. He wonders what it must feel like to believe in something with such unjaded hope. Still, he can’t resist a joke. “True self, though? That sounds terrible.”
“Oh.” Cas visibly relaxes before his eyes. “Okay, that makes sense.”
“It’s so good to see you. How long are you here? Where are you staying?”
“Don’t you mind me,” she says, settling into a chair of her own.
He’s both excited and ever so slightly intimidated about spending the evening with Balthazar, but he channels his mixed feelings into his story and writes a lengthy scene of his protagonist going through her closet, trying on enough different outfits to merit a montage before finally settling on one for her first date. Then he sits glumly on his bed staring at his open closet, realizing he has nothing to wear himself.
At that, Cas pushes him forward. Dean stumbles and, without his hands to steady himself, he lands face down on the bed. Any laughter dies in his throat when Cas pulls his jeans and underwear down to his knees then kicks his feet further apart. “I have a dangerous job, Dean. You of all people know that. I need to be clear-headed at all times.”
Cas begins as he does each time. “What’s your safeword?”
did you mean a bus riding loser?
“I already am all of those things, though. Now, I mean.”
Cas kisses him a few more times. “All right if I go get stuff to clean you up?”
Not really. I mean, it just never seemed like it was ever in the cards for me so it’s not like I felt like I was missing out. I don’t know if that makes sense.
“My mom did everything she could. Had my dad stuck around and acted like a man, that would’ve made all the difference.”
“It’s never too hot for lasagna.”
Cas jumped in his seat, startled by a sudden, loud thump on the roof of his car. A large bear of a man stood in the parking lot, wearing an apron matching Dean’s. He bent down to look into the partially open car window.
She gives him a sharp look. “Can you tell me what you mean by that?”
Garth stands there with his arms wide. “Wanna hug it out?”
It feels like a very big deal.
“Okay, forgive me for being overprotective. Look, I’m guessing mom and dad will never say it, but I’m proud of you. You’ve come a long way and done really well for yourself.”
“Look, we’re the only garage I know that has a writer-in-residence. I may have mentioned it.”
Dean blushes again, dropping his gaze and muttering.
“Yeah.” Cas smiles. “I guess that’s the issue. I’m still changing but he can’t anymore.”
“All right, dear.” She turns her back on him and he knows he’s been dismissed.
Castiel squinted for a minute, his gaze feeling like a physical touch. "We will come back to this later," he eventually said, nodding to himself like he just made a decision. "Please take off as many clothes as you are comfortable with, and then meet me downstairs."
No, it wasn't in the plan. I 100% blame Cas and Dean - well, mainly Cas - for this.
"Sir?" he asked quietly. He hated the suspense. He hated knowing that something was wrong, but not knowing what.
Just the Epilogue left guys! See you Wednesday!!
Comments and Kudos are love!!!
With an annoyed sigh, he dragged himself out of bed and down the stairs. He didn’t bother to tidy himself up, even though he probably looked a mess from curling up under the covers. He felt a mess, and he’d probably just tell whoever was at his door that he wasn't buying anything, then head right back to bed. He grabbed the front door keys from the key-bowl, and yanked the door open, his words dying on his tongue when he found himself face to face with Eileen.
"Yeah, I understand," Dean hummed. He hated to think about it, but now Eileen mentioned it, John was probably the exact kind of Dom Eileen was talking about. He'd been good enough at pretending to be good that even Sam had thought John was an okay Dom, even though he thought he was a horrible man. Obviously, Sam's opinion would probably have been different if he'd known Dean was a sub, but he still hadn't seen the problems that were there. "You don't have to worry though, Cas really is great."
