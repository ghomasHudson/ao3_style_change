“Yeah, I, erm, guess I could be there,” he says. “Sounds like fun.”
“Let’s take a look,” Dr Watson said. “Hm. Lovely. Rather prominent canines.” The hands that hovered close to his face, tool in hand, were quite hairy, Holmes noticed.
“Don’t be crude, Sherlock,” Mrs Holmes said. “Your speech has become shockingly vulgar. Perhaps you should serve a higher class of clients.”
He lowers the needle and glares at Watson. “I’m not.”
Holmes cocks his head and smiles at him. “And you invaded Afghanistan.”
If he falls back to sleep, he might be able to lie in for a bit and wake up feeling almost human. For this reason, he’s scheduled all his appointments in the afternoons. Only on Fridays, when he has no physio, no sit-down with Ella, does he have an open expanse of hours to fill. That’s when he wanders through the shops, picks up milk and whatever else he needs.
. Anything to do with Alex Tribble must come from the creators. They absolutely own the trademark, copyright, everything. And merchandising. Even the action figures they sold were approved. And the game, the pillow shams, the rucksacks…” He was babbling now, planning to get off at the next stop, just to avoid the awkwardness. The train was slowing down. What station was this?
We drink in silence for a few minutes.
Watson coaxes Holmes into lunch before they board the train. His feelings about the events of the last two days are muddled. He wants to talk to Holmes, ask him what’s behind his grim conviction that people are horrible. All he can do, though, is push sandwiches on him, urge more tea, and notice how exhausted he looks. His skin has a greyish pallor and his usually sharp eyes are dim, focused inward.
Tears sting her eyes, remembering. “He couldn’t stay there, don’t you see? Everything reminded him of you; he couldn’t find a way out of his grief. Someone at Barts, probably Mike, got him the job. You could see it on his face; he was struggling, in pain. People said that he’d started drinking on the job, that he was sent home a couple times for being intoxicated. Whenever I passed him in a corridor, he looked like he was in a trance, pushing a heavy object uphill, knowing that it was just going to run him over when he thought he’d reached the top. Then I heard he’d been fired.”
“When I’ve got it down to a few, we’ll screen-test them with you. I will certainly consider your feelings about it.”
The sound it made caused every head in the room to turn, and not with happy surprise. My note was a caterwaul, a rusty screech. Horrified, I lowered the bow and made to hand the instrument back to him.
It’s still a new thing, but he has decided he likes it. Yes, definitely. John sleeps a lot more than he does, which gives Sherlock time to lie in bed and watch him sleep.
After the ladies had gone up, the gentlemen retired to a chamber off the dining room, where Mr Chadwick offered us port and cigars. Watson was unusually quiet, I observed. Unfortunately, Mr Chadwick filled the void, talking about the new machine he was contemplating for his factory.
“Tequila!” Pleased with himself, the barista grabbed the bottle and a clean glass. “Straight?”
The word
“You needed money,” I said.
When he looks up, Sherlock is studying him again. John cuts into his fish and tastes it.
The remaining one percent were the ones I studied. These were mostly women, few of them young, of various backgrounds. They could see ghosts, as I did.
I nod. “Yes. It’s been hard, though. It’s not like something I can forget.”
“No, not a real one. I’m not allowed to have pets. Not even fish. Because I haven't shown
Holmes hauls him to his feet and they do the final verse together. It’s insanity.
“You never thought about being a father?”
And he would watch his own back.
“Why not?” Molly frowned. “Other series sub in a new actor when one of the original stars—“
He’s scraping the last bit of icing from the plate. “Mycroft said you figured out. That it was a trick.”
“Journalist.”
“I couldn’t find anything on that.”
“Pent-up libido,” I replied, settling my head on his chest.
“No, John— wait!”
I smiled. “I think we’ll have to.”
She stopped attacking my hair with the comb and looked into my face. “You must not talk so. And do not mention ghosts. Not unless you want to be sent away.”
As always, Sherlock materialised just as the first pieces of toast were ready. He smiled and gave John a quick kiss, then sat down.
. In this case, however, her delusion will be quickly forgotten. Now, then. The plan. We will burgle Milverton’s house tonight. According to Edith—
But I haven’t told her about Sherlock. I’m not sure whether I’m supposed to keep it secret. When it becomes public, it will be a big event, a media circus, even. I’ll have to wait and see what he wants to do about that.
I don't want any adventures, thank you.
He laughed. “A querulous wife?”
His written accounts of our cases always tended towards the romantic and sensational.
“Both.”
and saw the source of the deadly shot.
Having nowhere to go, no one to see, he walks. Ordinarily he doesn’t sleep much, but now he feels exhausted. For the past week he’s been fretting about this thing with John, and stupid sentiment has gotten in the way of doing what he should have done sooner. He feels like an idiot for letting his heart run away with him.
“Dr Watson will receive a fair trial. I don’t have anything to do with that. We merely investigate the crime, find the evidence, and turn the suspect over for justice. You might start by explaining why you were there. You have to admit that it looks suspicious.”
“Hardly a disaster, Inspector. You may close your file on Milverton, since his little kingdom of blackmail has fallen. You interviewed Watson and me independently, and we agree on what happened. That ought to clear him of the murder charge. Pursuing us on the charge of breaking and entering is likely to create more problems than it solves.“
“The font is spelled differently,” I said. “And I remember Ariel because I played the part in the Tempest— it was a boy fairy, by the way— and my classmates kept saying,
The battlefield is out there. Welcome back, Captain Watson.
“Hello, Ariel,” I said. “Who’s your friend?”
He sat up in bed, his heart pounding. For a moment he couldn’t figure out where he was or what had happened. As his eyes gradually adapted to the darkness, he saw that he was in his bedroom. His legs were twisted in the sheets, thrashed free from the mattress as he was dreaming. The glowing dial of the ancient alarm clock read
“Yeah, Mary got pregnant and it seemed like the right thing to do.”
Holmes nods. “Parents always blame themselves for their children’s failures.”
When he arrives home that evening, the flat is empty. Sherlock is gone, and hasn’t left a note or any indication of where he went or what caused him to leave.
He snorted. “No new-fangled inventions for the men of the Diogenes,” he said. “We will never change. We live as we have for the last hundred years, and will for the next hundred.” He took another drink of water and sighed. “You are wondering what the purpose of my call is. Just this: I promised I would let you know the moment I heard from him.” He took the letter from his pocket. “This arrived in the morning post.”
Smiling, he squeezes her hand.
I nodded. “The Greeks understood this passion,” he said. “A young man, hungry for wisdom, needs an older man, mentoring him.”
Matt’s embarrassment fades; he laughs. “Sure. And we’ve got all these pastries that I’ll need to toss in the bin when we close in an hour, so have what you like.”
They return to the house. John turns on the telly and Rosie retreats to her room. At least they’ve talked, he thinks. He can’t expect her to sit beside him and demand a story or just let him cuddle her. Even if he’d stayed, if he hadn’t left for three years, she would still have changed and wouldn’t want those things now. He’ll just have to see what kind of relationship they can have. As long as they talk, he won’t lose her.
“You’re a writer, Watson— a
When I’d removed my mask, Milverton laughed.
“Before… stranger? Who was it?”
“Would that be so terrible? Look, the first movie I was in was awful. No, it wasn’t
Sherlock, on the other hand, was in a good place when they met. His career was taking off, and that was all that really mattered to him. He’d put relationships behind him, having decided that they were unnecessary. He hadn’t wanted the blind date, caving in only because he couldn’t think of a reason not to do it.
“Yeah, he’s got to keep himself busy,” Greg agrees. “When he’s bored, he’s a right pain in the arse.”
“It’s all right, Sherlock.” John brought his face up to his and kissed him. “Whatever you want. We have time. What do you want?”
Addressing no one in particular, Sherlock said, “You all knew?”
“So,” he begins. “Are you seeing someone?”
“You didn’t. And I’m not embarrassed that everyone knew I was in love with you. Love isn’t as terrible as you seem to think, Sherlock. Caring about another person is never pathetic. It’s noble. That love I had for you didn’t go to waste. Why do you think I agreed to help you with your scheme?”
He had, and he did. And now he would continue to mourn, even though the boy he’d loved was alive, living a cab drive away from Baker Street, holed up in a shabby flat pretending to be someone else. He would mourn because John Watson, though not dead, was gone. Only Jason Bradford remained, his face forever smiling at Alex Tribble.
“I’m sorry about this.” She smiled tightly at us, then turned her glare on her daughter. “If I’d had any idea what Rosamund was up to —”
“Everybody’s done Shakespeare. And most of those Hamlets and Macbeths end up selling products on the telly or acting in regional theatre. Either they get a break at some point, or they learn to be content with that. If you’re not happy with what you’ve got, get off your high horse and go get some auditions.”
I’d been foolish to say what I thought out loud, but I had expected, if not warmth, at least some kind of welcome. I was six years old and no one had ever grabbed my ear or locked me in a room.
Watson wonders if he should step in. It’s quite possible that Holmes will say something they’ll all regret. But Watson has no better ideas. He can feel the larger boy’s quiet rage, understands that he’s let himself be pushed to this limit by boys like the one whose throat he’s prepared to slit. If there was ever a point where it might become too much to simply watch people bully others, this is clearly that point. Charles is broken, out of his mind with anger and grief. Watson knows that feeling, has been there himself, but he has no idea how to talk someone out of that madness.
What he actually feared was that Sherlock would back down, call it off, tell everyone that it was a joke. But everything leading up to the big day went smoothly. Harry was miffed that she hadn’t been asked to be best man for John, but was happy for them. Mycroft insisted on following every stupid tradition and superstition either of them had ever heard of, but it was always easier to humour Mycroft about petty things than to fight him.
Maybe not. He has to think about job interviews now.
, he said, pointing at me. He was sure that I was a liar and should not be believed. I would break all of his toys and leave a mess.
“Do I… appeal to men?”
“You were committing a crime,” Lestrade said “You were burgling his safe.”
When Sherlock solves the case of the winery, the owner, as promised, sends them a case of very nice wine. Naturally, they have to open a bottle and try it. And another to compare. And a third to consolidate their findings.
“Well?” the girl says.
“Marriage isn’t payment of a debt. You don’t owe her that.”
“Call me when you get home,” Lestrade says.
“She knew,” I growled, heading towards the hiding place. “She saw through my ruse, but played along. What gave it away?”
“Mr Holmes was my pupil when I taught at Cambridge,” said Bellamy. ”I’m mostly retired now, though I teach a course or two at the University of London when they need me.” He eyed me with pleasure. “A brilliant mind. I’m so glad you have found a use for your talents, my dear man.”
Mycroft knew about our father’s death, but all the time that he was gone had believed that I was being brought up by my aunt and uncle. In fact, he’d sent letters to me there, and was disappointed that I hadn’t written back. On his return he went to see them, hoping to find that I’d been sent to a good school and was preparing for university. His anger when he found I’d been abandoned at a charity school was justified, and he came at once to take me away.
Once inside his flat, he put on his pyjamas and dressing gown, lit a cigarette, and pushed the DVD for
John is so much more than a boyfriend. It’s scary how much Sherlock adores him.
She chuckled. “Well, do you want to know or not?”
“Upstairs.” DI Lestrade seems curious about John, too, giving him more than a cursory glance. “So, you’re John Watson.”
In the cab, their hands find one another again. Nothing is said on the drive home, but Sherlock knows that he can’t ignore John’s behaviour any longer. He will have to say something. John has no idea he’s behaving strangely, and will not like what Sherlock says. It’s a conversation Sherlock dreads.
“Anderson.”
“I’m only trying to spare you both. And I would not be so concerned if you were merely dating him. You have complicated matters, though, by inviting him to be your flatmate. It’s a bad idea. You have no clear path of retreat if it doesn’t work.”
“That’s not what I meant. You have real emotions about this, and if you act like a sociopath it will hurt you— not just your career, but you personally. It won’t help you deal with it.”
“Would you like to try?” he asked one evening.
Irene and Molly had argued about what the MacGuffin should be called, and finally gave up, referring to it simply as the Device. Said with a certain intonation, it seemed ominous enough.
“We’re alumni,” Watson says. “Isn’t that pretext enough to visit?”
For a long moment John just stared at him, his mobile face betraying the inner struggle. Then a sigh. “I just couldn’t do it anymore. Maybe it wasn’t the best way, but I had to do something— or I would have killed myself for real.”
Lenore Ashton-Farbridge was twenty-six, a pretty blonde with enough intelligence to converse sensibly. I found her tolerable, but uninteresting. Her advanced age made her parents anxious to see her married. She’d had a love affair which had ended badly, I deduced, which increased her parents’ pressure to find a suitable husband. Still, she could have been much worse. She was not a silly girl. During dinner, she smiled at my stories and subtly flattered me. Well-schooled in music, art, and literature, she could converse on all those subjects without sounding ignorant. While not a true beauty, her prettiness might age gracefully.
He walked back to Baker Street. At some point along the way it started to rain, which only reinforced the feeling that he was trapped in some idiotic rom-com. Trudging on, he assessed what he had just learned.
“How shall we tell your mother that her efforts have failed?”
“That’s not what I meant,” he said.
As I open the door, I sense that something is different. It’s cold, for one thing. Someone’s been in here. Maybe Mrs Hudson was checking while I was at work, opening the window to air it out, and just forgot to close it. If that were the case, though, the lights from the alley would be flooding into the room. Instead, it’s dark and frigid. I can smell onions, cabbage, and damp. Someone is here; I can hear them breathing.
“You’re going out?”
He sleeps poorly, occasionally waking and listening. He could simply get out of bed, go into the sitting room and ask him what’s on his mind. It’s exhausting, really, just thinking about this, not knowing.
Angelo sets a plate of lasagna down in front of John. He takes a bite and suddenly feels ravenously hungry. For a while he eats in silence. Sherlock is not eating or drinking, but watches the street intently.
John is seeing a counsellor. A
him? Or trying to beat a confession out of him?”
Surrendering a bit under the scrutiny of that pale gaze, he slides into the cab.
At work I treat coughs and colds and minor injuries. After the last patient of the day, I come home and watch the telly.
She puts down her chopsticks. “Mum wants to sell the house.”
Holmes: Fine. I'll go first. I confess, I hate the way you write.
“I will,” you say. “I will come back.”
“No apology necessary. I did ask you to strike me, and you delivered. Feel free to refuse, however, if I ever make such a request again.”
He was wearing glasses, another typical element of disguise. The Clark Kent ploy. It was amazing that trick even worked, it was so obvious.
“Come on, Watson, just one more flight.”
“Your master is correct, Doctor Watson. I am here to warn him.” Scowling, he turned that dark gaze on me. “Leave off, Mr Holmes. You’ve inconvenienced me repeatedly, and there can be just one outcome. It has been stimulating, matching myself against an intelligent opponent, but we both know that when forced to take extreme measures, I will do what I must. Do not smile, Holmes. I am quite serious. Stand clear, or be trodden under foot.”
“And how do I write this up?” Lestrade said.
“What did Donovan say to you?”
“She didn’t break it off.”
I kissed him, letting my tongue rove gently over and between the lips of that panting mouth. My hand caressed the front of the boy’s trousers, feeling the hardening prick. And I stalled, listening for the footsteps that I knew were coming. I slipped my hand into Philip’s trousers and wrapped my fingers around his cock.
“When I was twenty, I thought I knew everything,” I said.
By the time his return is announced, we’ve established ourselves as a couple, sleeping together, snogging when we feel like it, and learning how to make love to one another. It isn’t difficult; we’ve lived together before, and I guess our bodies have been anticipating what would happen if we were reunited. We were ready for that.
Watson opened his mouth; I raised a hand to silence him. “Why are you here, Professor?”
As he turns the pages he finds a brain that looks like it’s about to explode. “Is it radioactive?”
They meet on the roof of Barts.
He gives Watson a stupid grin. “Well, it worked last time. Apparently this ward has different rules.”
Gazing up at him, John held him close. “There were times when you didn’t seem at all human, but let me tell you this: you are the most human of any being I’ve known.”
“I’m sorry I couldn’t go with you,” he said. “I’ve missed you. For so long.”
, part of my brain was reminding me.
“It’s not his book!” I cried.
She offered her gloved hand. I took it, kissed it, and said good night.
“I should have quit. My manager thought it would be a huge boost for my career, working on a serious movie.
“I’ve run away,” Ariel said. “I’m going to live with you now.” She turned to me. “Are you his boyfriend?”
Saying nothing, he sets the cup of tea down next to John, letting his hand linger there for a moment so John will notice.
John’s eyes opened. He looked a bit surprised, Sherlock thought. And then he smiled. “I think it’s pretty obvious that we’re going to be
“Just a short segmen
“Oh, for god’s sake! What do you think?”
“I’d like to see you some time. Can you ask your mum to call me about that?”
“I know, my boy. Believe me, the last thing I want is another fiancée.”
Brook giggled again. “And you’re a junkie. Let’s see whose career takes off now.”
Eight o’clock found me prepared to meet my secretive visitor, wrapped in my tattiest dressing gown, smoking and cultivating a superior attitude. I do not mind dealing with the highest levels of society; they generally pay well. I have no obligation, however, to be obsequious.
“I don’t know. It never seemed like… like something you’d want.”
(and how odd that sounds, to be dating a man!), and that Sherlock introduces him as his—
The detectives refused to meet my eyes.
She sipped her wine. “Actors carry around the ghosts of the people they’ve loved. It’s what they draw on when they play a character. Like writers, they have to understand character. I just want to be sure that you can do this, Sherlock.”
“Well, that puts a different spin on things,” I said. “Perhaps I am not repulsive to females. Not that their repulsion would in any way affect me.”
John looked down at his feet. “I wish I’d known. I understand why you didn’t want me to know, but I wish things could have been different. We always had fun on set, but you never seemed to want to hang out or be my friend. Sometimes I didn’t even think you liked me.”
I place my hands on his head, gently feeling the shape of his skull, reminding myself that he didn’t die the way I imagined so many times. “You had an impossible choice. You did what you had to. And you came back to me.”
He doesn’t know how to respond to this. Molly has serious self-esteem issues, which have doomed practically every relationship she has attempted. She has an eye for men who are arrogant, demeaning, and superior, generally ignoring the solid, steady men who look at her with admiration. He knows he was cruel to her, and her interest in seeing him with someone, even if it can’t be her, is more than he deserves.
“I’m not—“
“I have a loaded pistol in my hand,” Milverton said calmly. “You may as well reveal yourself, with your hands raised and in plain view. We can chat until the police arrive.”
“Sometimes it helps to say things aloud,” she repeats.
“It means… we belong together. I think we always did.”
The knights in the stories he read didn’t get married and nag their children to do their lessons. A knight rode around and had adventures, and if he met a woman who deserved it, he gave her his loyalty, his protection, and his adoration. Her job was to be beautiful and to admire his bravery. This was an ideal love, he decided.
“But it will not be for nothing.” Milverton gave me an oily smile. “I have several other
“When you made the acquaintance of John Watson, I saw your interest in him, and assumed it was only prurient. I recognised him as a man with great unrealised potential, but a shaky foundation. I feared that he might indulge your weakest traits and the two of you would pull each other down into the gutter.
“We are invited to dinner,” Mycroft told me. “Mother says that you are to bring your protégé as well.” He nodded at Watson. “She reads your stories in the Strand and has requested to meet you.”
“Yeah,” he says. “Good idea.”
“Very good, Watson. You are coming along splendidly, though you might pick up the tempo a bit.
His face was sincere, but it would be foolish for me to hope he would keep that promise.
,” Charles said. “Still, she meant for Emma and me to read it. It’s not for you.”
John’s RAMC mug is in the sink; he puts it in a box. The sitting room is full of his books, medical journals, his mail. In the loo he finds shampoo, soap, toothbrush, razor. Everything goes into the box. He folds the corners in and sets it out on the landing with the suitcase.
think that I was merely using her?
“Holmes—
“So,” Lestrade said, reaching for the chips. “You didn’t get the part.”
“Sentimental?” Sherlock smiles. “I know. Foolish.”
Thank you for reading! Our heroes live to find more adventures…
“And I’m not getting pregnant,” added Lestrade. “You, Sherlock?”
Sherlock picked a venue; John found the right florist and had invitations made up; Sherlock set up a cake-tasting and signed them up for dance lessons; John asked Lestrade to be his best man. Unfortunately, Sherlock had already asked him. John countered by asking Mycroft to stand up with him; he agreed, happy as always to be dealt into the game. Sherlock picked out tuxedos and found a photographer. John planned the honeymoon.
“The big deal is that she still has a crush on me. If she writes a romance between us into the story, it opens up possibilities I’d rather not consider. A spin-off with Alex and Holly married, their half-alien twins in school with all the same plots recycled. I’ll be in thrall to this disaster for years.”
“You mean you and one of those women,” he replied. “The experiment is flawed, as I have not the correct proportions.”
“Wait.” Sherlock pressed his fingers against his temples. “I’m getting flashes of something.” His eyes opened wide. “I’m a brilliant detective, and you’re my loyal but slightly dim sidekick!”
“Neither am I.” This is a huge admission, but it’s time he owned it. “I’ve never done… that.”
“I suppose I’ll take the sofa,” John said, eyeing the very pink, ornate and uncomfortable-looking loveseat.
“But it is,” John says. “He was wrong.”
“Gang stuff, in Dublin. He gave evidence against some pretty big players, and they let him out early. A model prisoner, by all accounts, but definitely psycho. He’s spent the last ten years in and out of psychiatric institutions for stalking various people, including a member of the royal family.”
“An heir?” Watson set down his cup with a clatter. “She expects you to marry?”
Sherlock presses his lips into John’s hair and sighs. “We rarely see the significance of the things that happen to us. We expect the universe to give us meaning, when actually it’s up to us to find what it means. What happened that day at Barts, the two of us meeting after so many years, was a synchronicity we both could have walked away from.”
His performance in
“Why? Are they going to make an
When he finally took acting lessons, he learned that actors were encouraged to identify a character’s inner motivations, to live those emotions through the character. It was all rubbish. He made people believe his characters without involving his own feelings because he was good. He knew what expressions to put on, what movements his character should make because he paid attention. He observed. He’d done it since he was a small child, trying to figure out other children, who seemed more like aliens to him (ironic, now that he thought about it). People might have called him a mimic, but it didn’t matter, did it, if they believed what he showed them?
He blushed down to his roots. “You’re right,” he said. “But people oft-times make mistakes when they can see no other choice. And going after a blackmailer will deter other blackmailers, which may profit future victims.”
Could they have been friends?
He dresses and cautiously comes down the stairs, listening. A male voice, very calm, is responding to Holmes’s angry tirade.
“He’ll be fine,” Mycroft replies. “Your concern should be for yourself. At this point there is nothing you can do about John Watson.”
They cross the street and head towards Molly’s building.
It was a few weeks later that we received another wedding invitation. This one was from Miss Sutherland. A small note fluttered to the floor when Watson opened the envelope.
. Such a terrible thing.
No, I couldn’t say it, not to her, not to anyone. That was between me and you. Only I never told you. Maybe that’s what keeps me awake at night.
she would say,
Sherlock didn’t even blink. “It’s our anniversary.”
“Thank you, ma’am,” he said, turning a bit pink.
“I’d like to make a confession,” the old man said. “Not because I’m religious, but because in everyone there is something that wants unburdening. There are things I have kept to myself which I would like you to know. As you are one of the youngest men Scotland Yard has promoted to Inspector, I think you might benefit from my experience. And I would ask you not to reveal what I say to anyone else.”
“You rogue.”
Gregson smirked. “And how would you know this?”
“Why would he be angry?”
“It was you.”
She sighs and rolls her eyes a bit. “Refuses. Another thing to be dramatic about. I was thinking that maybe you and I should see someone, together.”
One of my nieces had settled nearby. As my joints became too stiff to do my own cooking and cleaning, she used to come over and take care of me. She drove a motor car and brought me a wireless set to entertain me. I found that I didn’t care for it. I still had my violin, and though my fingers could not manage the music I had learned in my youth, I still played.
That’s what he can’t answer, and perhaps what’s making him uneasy.
John does, stroking the opening gently. He begins sliding his finger into Sherlock. They’re pressed up against each other now, a most intimate embrace. He moans, and pulls John closer. As he does, he realises that John has lost his erection.
They sit at a table near the counter, in case a customer comes in.
“Erm. His wife just had a baby, so that’s all we talked about.”
“Absolutely not.”
Perhaps it was a sign of my age that I felt nostalgia at times now. Ten years ago, I was always impatient, eager to get on to the next case, the next problem. The cases themselves meant little; they were just mental stimulation. I had never valued friendships, and had few friends as a result. My ties to my family were dutiful, but fortunately not onerous. I generally found society dull, and was rarely invited out. There was little in my life to be sentimental about.
“I heard about that. You know, I worried about you, seeing what you were going through. That was actually part of what made me keep going. I know that sounds stupid, but I used to imagine that we were together, weathering it all.”
There’s nothing he can say to that. Maybe it was a selfish choice, but it was one he’d made early, before he met Mary, and he’d been honest about. He always wanted to serve in the army, had planned on doing it once he had his medical license. It wasn’t something he could put off until the time was right. Waiting would mean giving it up, and he knew that could kill something inside him. He was not made for a quiet life. He craved that adventure. Having a baby and getting married had complicated things, but he had held fast; it was something he had to do. Three years, then he would come back, start a practice, and they would be happy.
As he dipped the crusty bread in the batter, he wondered how Sherlock would react to his present. At Christmas he’d been pleased, in an understated way. Since it was just the two of them, exchanging gifts at home, they’d kissed. On his birthday, others were present at the small party John had organised and Sherlock had balked at. He’d never had a birthday party before, he said, and wasn’t about to start now. Still, he’d enjoyed having their few friends gather for cake and punch, and had been gracious to everyone.
Apparently he’s on the ground. It’s wet, and that’s mostly why it’s cold, he thinks.
“I don’t know,” he says, feeling just as miserable as she sounds. “Look, there are people at the Met I know. I’ll give them a call and see what they say. I know it’s not easy, but someone needs to stay there in case she comes home. Let me know if you hear anything, okay?”
“I’ve got a few guest spots lined up. Cop shows, mainly.” He grinned. “Don’t look at me like that. I don’t mind being typecast if it means having a job. Crime dramas always do well, at least for a few years.”
Sherlock looks annoyed for a second, but then begins a medley.
“Fine, but it’s not necessary. I’m doing this purely out of gratitude that your brother didn’t wreck my life.”
“This is Doctor John Watson, my partner. You may trust him as you trust me.”
“Ella said that you’re good at… problems… like mine.” He smiles ruefully. “I guess I’m sort of a late bloomer. I mean, I’ve had relationships, just not… I never really thought I was… gay. But I’m in a relationship now, and there are… um, problems.”
He wondered. Now that the idea had been planted, he couldn’t stop thinking about it. It could be a very bad thing for Baz to have a love interest. Or a very good one. It would depend on him, he realised, and how he played it.
they agree to meet with the others and come up with a plan.
Everything about the event was wrong. His scarf and Belstaff were covered with John’s blood (
He doesn’t sleep. While he knows it’s the right decision, it doesn’t feel good. He loves John. By the time he realised that it was a mistake, it was too late. What made him think that he could have John? He should have seen what was happening. He can blame that on his lack of experience. And now, he will just have to get over it. If he doesn’t, it will destroy him.
In the darkness, John wonders what Sherlock’s face is doing. He reaches up a hand and touches his cheek, imagines that it’s turning that beautiful shade of pink it often does when he’s shy of saying something.
With Sherlock, it’s always one extreme or the other, it seems. He’s a silent shape on the sofa, or he’s a frenetic force of nature that tears around the flat, making incomprehensible utterances and eventually running downstairs and out the front door without giving a clue as to his destination. Apparently, after days of the former, the latter has occurred.
Playing Baz Culpeper on the small screen wasn’t so hard. The detective’s character was much like his own— acerbic, solitary, analytical. The character had been written with a much milder personality. An
“Which is exactly why a romantic relationship will be more interesting to explore through him.”
And John is giggling. Giggling, a thing he only ever does for Sherlock.
He nods, just to end the conversation.
, and could easily stop breaking things if I weren’t so inconsiderate.
There are just two things of note that happened to me while I was there.
He smiled. “Tchaikovsky? What are they playing of his?”
As you have probably suspected, bullying amongst students (with tragic results) is revealed in this chapter. Avoid if that makes you uncomfortable.
Though Watson was frequently the object of feminine glances, women rarely flirted with me. I supposed that they could sense my disinterest. Indeed, there are few things that bore me more than feminine conversation. Females were put off by my brusqueness and incivility, as most people were, which saved me a lot of time and trouble. Women always take a great deal of the former and bring a great deal of the latter.
“She might have had it before she ever came here,” I argued. “It has her name on the flyleaf.”
“Hi, kids!” she said. “Just Irene, no titles. And I know you all from my fangirl days, so no introductions necessary. I’m just listening in today, and making notes.”
The humiliation of that moment has never left John. It wasn’t the end, either, not by a long shot. More deductions, many of them spot-on. It was as if Holmes could see into his brain, unearthing his most embarrassing thoughts and revealing them to their classmates. Every day, a new humiliation.
Obviously he doesn’t need an extra brain to solve anything, especially an inferior brain like Watson’s. He takes every opportunity to explain to John why he’s an idiot. The fact that they’re on a train together, planning to solve a mystery, is madness. It’s a terrible idea.
Did John want an acting career? He had missed London, he said, and was tired of being dead. While Sherlock would be happy to keep him in his flat, pottering around and making tea, John would probably want to work. What shape that would take remained to be seen. And Sherlock would adjust to whatever reality John wanted.
“He expected us to arrived tonight,” Holmes says. “We made him aware of our purpose in coming, and I assume he has no objections. If you can just show us where we’re staying, we’ll stow our bags. We’re anxious to get to our task, so perhaps we can interview a few people— staff, students— before they retire.”
Sherlock isn’t sure if this is the correct answer. He’d better ask another question.
Sherlock opens his wallet, pulls a folded piece of paper from it and hands it to him. “I know you don’t like people knowing your middle name, but
“No worries. I’d rather have it than not.”
“Yeah, she was too. Said she hadn’t been looking, blah, blah. I guess it taught me something. Don’t trust anyone. People never mean what they say. So what about you? Have you given up women?”
Irene didn’t alarm him; he’d already deduced that she was a lesbian and had no interest in him sexually. She interested him, though non-romantically; she wasn’t merely intelligent, but knew how to use that intelligence. Like him, she observed people, read them and saw through appearances. Her memory was like his, retaining and leveraging information. She was competitive, but could easily walk away from a contest that didn’t interest her. Everything she did was calculated, strategised to help her win whatever game she’d decided to play. Any flirtation that occurred would be manipulative. He hated being the object of such a strategy, but he had to admire her. It wasn’t sentiment that had convinced her to work with Molly’s script. He wasn’t sure what had, and that was the puzzle he had set out to solve.
The day I set foot in Greenwood Hall, my aunt frowned at me and the pitiful trunk that contained all the possessions I’d been allowed to keep.
“I’m not sure the showrunners would be open to a gay relationship between them,” Sherlock added.
Sherlock greets him. “Ah, Lestrade. So where are we?”
“What have you given me?”
“Why are you looking for John Watson?” I asked.
“Ridiculous,” I repeated. “It was an impulsive act on your part. I believe you would follow your instincts even if they led straight into the Black Hole of Calcutta. We’re lucky that Lestrade and Gregson are imbeciles.”
“And the ashes? Can I have them?”
“I only want to assess the damage.”
The kettle clicked off, giving Sherlock a few moments to assess the offer while he made the tea. He returned to the sitting room with two mugs, setting one on the table next to Anderson.
“Tonight,” I said, unwilling to cling to him longer, lest he change his mind. My eyes followed him as he walked away.
There wasn’t a day that passed when he didn’t think of John, when he didn’t wish he’d said something to him.
“Stop that!” I said this without much energy. “I can deny you nothing when you do that, John. You have me. I will never marry— you know that.”
It’s into the wee hours and neighbours are starting to complain. John’s eyes are on Sherlock, who is talking with Stefan and Andy now. Matt is giggling at something Sam is telling him, and Christopher is pulling off his wig, running a hand over his head.
Eventually Molly is a friend, not just an accomplice. With her, he doesn’t have to pretend he’s anything but what he is. It’s nice, having someone to talk to.
Milverton laughed. “Don’t be a fool, boy. Do you really think I would bring the letters here with me? And what would you do— steal them from me? Then I would have to shoot you, and the law would be on my side.”
“We’re going to need surveillance,” he mutters. “Or we can sleep in shifts.”
wardrobe people had argued that he should dress more like a geek, but he had refused. Baz would not conform to expectations; his suit was a kind of armour, a way to let people know he was not to be dismissed as an eccentric.
At Greenwood Hall, seven children and four adults died. Six of these were servants, including the children’s nurse, the housemaid, and the cook. Many more were too ill to work. In surrounding houses, it was much the same. Children were highly susceptible, but adults were taken as well. Because so many died so quickly, they used the Red Room, the largest of the bedrooms, as a makeshift morgue. The master’s children were among the first to die; I’d seen the small cemetery where they were laid. After those deaths, more fell ill as the disease was shared among the servants. Bodies were laid on the beds, and then on the floor when there was no room on the beds. Eventually, those who died were buried somewhere on the land, Bessie had said.
“Look,” Sherlock says.
“I’m not afraid of any room,” I told them. “Why should I be afraid of one that’s red?”
“Husband?”
Holmes shook his head. “He’s clearly picking people who are out of their element, socially. People who won’t dance, won’t move around, talking to different groups. People who sit in a corner, their eyes on the door, lonely in the middle of a crowd. He’s hunting in that crowd. He’s smart, knows how to spot them, and how to put them at ease, get them to leave with him.”
Mrs Hudson brings up soup and tea and toast when he tells her Watson is ill. She offers her own advice about poultices and herbal teas to drive away infection. It’s not the infection, though. It’s the blood loss, the shock to the body. Watson must rebuild himself. Holmes does not call a doctor; it would only raise questions he cannot answer.
“Well, a boy. I was twelve. I suppose it wasn’t love so much as infatuation and hormones. His name was Victor. I never told him until I met him again at uni.” He gives John one of those looks that makes him feel like he is being x-rayed. “Have you ever kissed a man?”
“Not ill, no.”
,” he said, looking right at Sherlock.
is a real question, he gathers— from the look on Sherlock’s face, which is serious and a bit sad.
“I was distracted. It didn’t occur to me until later that he was someone… that I knew.”
“Magnussen.”
Sherlock looks at him and smiles. “You’re not.”
That could mean anything. Some herbs are harmless. Others can kill you. All of it natural. I don’t think Mike is trying to kill me, though.
After that, I began to visit the hall most nights, and the ghost children of Milford accepted my presence. What does a ghost have to fear from the living? I certainly feared nothing from them.
Again, I awoke. I felt cooler now and able to swallow, in spite of the pain in my throat. The nurse told me I’d been ranting in my sleep, calling out for someone named John. She assumed he was a brother; I did not explain.
“How long ago was this?” I asked, frowning at Watson, who took up his pen once more.
“I mean, don’t say everything you’re thinking out loud. Internal monologue, Sherlock, keep it inside your head. You’re trying to put this guy at ease, not make him feel like he’s under a microscope.”
“Don’t they?”
“It couldn’t have happened then,” Sherlock said. “The culture wasn’t ready for us to come out, either in our real lives, or as our alter egos. I only wish we’d remained friends over the years that followed.”
“No,” I said before the words were out of his mouth. “I won’t give it up. You will not take away all of my vices.”
People worry about me because I never do anything but sit at home, thinking about Sherlock. They keep urging me to go back to work. Christ, it’s been months. It still hurts.
. Something like that.
No words will suffice now, only actions.
He holds the urn in his hands. It’s not a fancy urn, just the basic one provided by the mortuary. He’s opened it many times and looked at the ashes. Watson’s atoms are there. Nothing is ever wasted in nature; everything turns into something new. How that happens is the miracle, and Death is just part of that cycle.
John turns and runs out the door, almost slamming it in his haste. Sherlock hears his feet hurrying down the stairs, the front door open and slam.
They pay for my services just the same as my humblest client, and will receive the same level of attention.
“Your friend was really upset,” Matt says, his eyes wide. “I mean, he looked like he was going to rip the place apart.”
“I’ve already told you,” Sherlock snaps. “I’m not doing it!” He’s stopped clanging things, but now slouches into a chair with his tea.
John will be the fool every time, but he’s starting not to mind so much. “Thank you for this. Walking home. And the guitar solo,” he says. “Any progress on the… thing?”
He doesn’t hesitate. Running to him, he grabs him in an embrace and doesn’t let go. His clothes absorb all the water from Watson’s body and he doesn’t care. He’s wet and cold and his heart is beating as it hasn’t for years. It’s wonderful.
“I want you to think about what we’ve talked about today, maybe write about it. I can see that you’re not enjoying the blog, so maybe you could just find a notebook and write down your thoughts. Nobody needs to see them.”
“He had committed the perfect murder, he said, and knew it was perfect because he’d never been caught. His cancer was a slow form that would give him another few years. He did not reveal any details of his crime, but said that no one had even realised that the death was a murder. He chose a person he had never met, and had no reason for killing them other than to see if anyone would notice. The victim was too young to have died of natural causes. Nevertheless, a natural cause was assumed. The family accepted this unsatisfactory reasoning and let it go.
I realise, but far better than any I can remember. I dreamed like this once before, when I imagined finding Sherlock in the airport, on his way to Bucharest. And now, he’s in a depressing hotel in Eastern Europe, ill and homesick.
His smile was fond. “Maybe it’s my ambition to take care of you in your dotage.”
“The man I was meeting.”
“Yes,” his husband agreed. “We are.”
John was always the neat one, the one who cared if things were clean. Sometimes he’s obsessive about his space, edgy when things are out of place. Ella would probably tell him that tidying up was his way of dealing with the chaos around him while he was growing up.
I’ve received many insults, some of them cutting, others ridiculous, but up until this point in my life, no one had ever used the word
“It isn’t fair,” said Watson.
“Science,” he repeats. “My dear doctor,
You would have hated it.
But she’s cleaned herself up. Recent haircut, dark roots touched up. Her skin looks better, too, no shadows under her eyes. A bit of makeup, tasteful.
“I almost died,” John says. “That’s happened before. The first time, I remember thinking,
“If you’re thinking of a screenplay, I wouldn’t bother,” he said. “People prefer a happy ending.”
He would just have to call Molly, he decided, and warn her not to be too trusting. Taking his phone out, he keyed in Molly’s number. As he listened to it ringing, he realised that she might be with Brook, and he’d better suss that out before he said anything.
“Oh? Which one?”
He tells his story, about a time he and Lestrade were investigating a murder in the Docklands, and John is laughing because only he can understand how a body concealed in a shipment of smoked herring is both gross and hilarious. Maybe not a tale best told over dinner, but that’s who they are.
to be ready, to give Sherlock what he wanted.
I took this all in with as much composure as I could muster. “Perhaps you’d better begin at the beginning. Mycroft said you’d invested in a diamond mine. What happened to that?”
Another text.
Once I’d sent my manuscript off to a publisher, I had no occupation other than the bees. Often, I just sat thinking, remembering the house where I was born, my parents sitting by the fire in the evenings, the tiny, elegant skeletons I would collect in the woods. I remembered my brother coming home, standing over me so tall, stooping down to look into my face. I thought of my parents’ funerals, my night in the Red Room, the ghostly children of Milford, and meeting John in that in-between space where I was not quite dead and he was not quite alive.
“The threats, then. What if I don’t do this?”
And here’s the answer. “I was drugged?”
“I am a realistic, dear boy.”
“This is why you became a doctor. You must help this lady. I will go on ahead and meet you tonight at Rosenlaui.”
“Holmes?” Watson turned over and gave me a sleepy frown. “What is it?”
Or maybe there was another way to fix this. In other words: two could play this game.
“It’s just that—“ He paused, looking a bit apologetic. “There’s a lot of luck involved. So many things might have gone wrong, sending you down another path. What if John hadn’t died? What if you hadn’t become a junkie—“
“Obviously. It’s part of the ruse. She will not hesitate to admit a harmless clergyman who’s been assaulted. Now, strike me!”
Holmes (
Thus the months passed, spring into summer.
“I have my own flat,” he objects. “My own bed where I can sleep this off.”
But John is his best friend, and he will always remember that, even if it’s eventually something that only used to be true. John following him into an alley, his gun tucked in his waistband. John sitting beside him, laughing at crap telly. John crying when he was lying on the pavement in a pool of someone else’s blood. John saying,
He finds himself smiling as he thinks about this. He has always felt
Later, Mike will call and say,
. Watson goes shopping for a new mattress. Holmes makes deductions. Of course they won’t be needing two beds.
As I recall, you have often reminded me that details—“
“You look fine,” Irene said, opening one more button on his shirt. “And a bit sexy. Live with it.” She frowned up at him. “I can count on you right? You can keep your head in the right place for an hour?”
Sherlock leans over and whispers to John. “Coincidence? I think not.”
“I know. I’m not blaming you. Or him, I guess… I know he had his reasons. I just wasn’t prepared…” He scrubs at his eyes and she can see tears starting to spill over. “I thought he was dead, and there he was, just when I was getting ready to—“ He reaches into his pocket, sets a small box on the table. A ring box. “I was going to propose to Mary. I felt like I’d finally gotten over everything— over him— and was ready to…” He gives a short laugh. “And there he was. Large as bloody life, mocking me. What was I supposed to do?”
“There is a small horde of photographers on your doorstep, brother. I advise you to remain inside.”
The woman staring at him gave him a flirtatious smile. Women did that, now that he had fully grown into his odd looks, no longer appearing alien. Men did it too. The women he dismissed, having no interest in that. The men… well, at Cambridge he’d indulged himself a few times, enjoying a degree of anonymity, or at least disregard. It was always disappointing, though, when they seemed more impressed with the fact that they’d just shagged Alex Tribble than with anything about
. He hadn’t really expected Sherlock to agree that they’d go to Yorkshire; all he’d hoped for in that moment was to get under his skin a bit, maybe even make him lose his temper.
“Yes, well… of course,” Crawford says. “I’ll call him down.”
Sherlock looks at his brother, who shrugs but makes no move to leave.
“Death is the other side of Life,” said the monk. “Energy does not die; it only passes into another form.”
John’s mouth may have been open for a bit. It’s an odd question. Everybody knows they’re straight until something happens and they know they’re not. Isn’t that the way it works? “I just knew. When did you know you were gay?”
Neither of them says anything about doing it again.
“I saw that she was in love with you. No, that is putting it too romantically. She lost the fortune she hoped for, and with it any chance of a well-born husband. She looked at you and saw a handsome face, an amiable nature, and a doctor’s salary. She had designs on you, Watson. She is every bit as shrewd and calculating as Mr James Windibank, and you are quite as romantic as the delusional Miss Sutherland. And I thought you might be just foolish enough to feel pity for her and get caught in that design. It doesn’t matter,” I said. “You will leave me one day. Maybe this woman was not the one, but some day… It doesn’t matter. I have known it since the moment we met.”
“Not very. Only one documented case. Idiot.”
A sharp reply is on his tongue, ready to fly out of his mouth.
I realise that this may not be the protocol you are used to, your Majesty, but you are in my home, not your own. You came to me, and I would not be much of a detective if I could not keep a confidence.”
It’s Angelo, with his cane. “Sherlock texted me. Said you forgot this.”
It was obvious that you had real talent, even though you were stuck in a silly story about an alien. You made Alex real, showed his vulnerability. You made people love your character.”
. And Ella’s right. The change has to come from him. He’s been doling his happiness out in small portions, afraid to say what he wants, afraid he’s lost the chance to have it and never deserved it in the first place.
“No one,” he admits. “You didn’t get much out of that deal, though, did you?”
“I sent a letter to the last address I had several months ago, in Johannesburg. He has not responded.”
But tonight Sherlock needs all my attention. “I’ll bring him by, Mrs H. You’re going to love him.”
Sitting up, he looks around. He can hear Molly in the office, talking on the phone with someone, maybe Lestrade. It will be interesting to see what Scotland Yard makes of their deaths, his and Moriarty’s. A crime has been committed, but is it murder? Suicide? A revenge killing?
Still no sounds from the sitting room. He peeks in, sees his flatmate curled up on the sofa, eyes closed, breathing deeply. There is something oddly vulnerable about Sherlock when he’s asleep. Awake, he practically thrums with mental energy, those pale eyes taking in every detail, slotting it into his internal filing system. It’s intimidating what those eyes notice. Asleep, he looks younger, softer.
Sherlock sighs, still looking unhappy. “I’ll accept that.” He sets his cup on top of a stack of newspapers and stands up. “Look, Watson, you need to understand.” He’s unbuttoning his shirt. Taking it off, dropping it onto the floor. He stands in front of John, his arms out.
Instead of seeing Sherlock’s bed strewn with discarded clothing, I see an airport. I don’t stop to think how weird this is; I just step over the threshold.
“Leave it, Sherlock. Nothing good can come from digging around in the past.” He took the seat opposite his brother and signalled to the functionary hovering like a ghost that he’d like tea.
It’s a very nice restaurant, the kind where people
“Yeah, okay. You know I’m a doctor, right? Don’t usually take herbal concoctions.”
When did you reach this conclusion?”
“Where is he?”
The night I returned from Greenwood I was exhausted and fell into my bed like a dead man. I did not dream.
John doesn’t object, but he seems distant, distracted. Dinner was meant to be an olive branch, a gesture to show that Sherlock isn’t holding a grudge over the gym incident. And he is happy that he solved it. John said he was
“Yes, I think they slipped,” I lied. “It will be convenient for us if they continue to make mistakes, but we must remain cautious.”
“I had no idea.” Sherlock can understand his reaction now, but it is most likely an over-reaction. “That must have been horrible, seeing it like that, seeing her… Tell me about your daughter.”
gun— the one upstairs, in the drawer next to your bed— than the one that is now about to blow your brains out.
. Poor kid.
He grins. “Do you ask all potential flatmates out on blind dates?”
The following scene was the one Sherlock had been dreading. In the original episodes Molly’s character, Holly, didn’t find out that Alex was an alien until the final episode, and spent every one of the previous episodes pining after him, trying to get him to notice her. Since Alex had no clue about love or relationships, he always missed the meaning of her hints and suggestions. He was kind to her, but uninterested and sometimes puzzled by things she said. This was meant to be humorous, but always felt cruel to Sherlock.
I remember the pills Mike gave me. Digging through the drawers in the loo, I find the bottle. The herbal thing. It seemed to help before. There were no side-effects that I remember, other than the weird dream. That could have been coincidence, my grieving mind wanting some confirmation that Sherlock was alive.
Her eyes glistened. “He came home with such hope— after so many years, our separation was to end.” She touched a handkerchief to her eye. “Poor Father.”
“If anything, that fuelled it. There was a fan theory at the time that John wasn’t really dead, that he’d just gone into hiding.”
“Very few people notice things that are so close.”
“I didn’t mean to,” John said. “I wanted to kill myself. But I didn’t.”
“My advice to you is this: give up the writing. It will bring you neither prestige nor prosperity. Writing is a vulgar profession filled with pandering scribblers. My elder son tells me that you are studying medicine, a tolerably respectable career for a man of your background. You must set yourself up in practice as soon as you are able. Marry a woman of good reputation and moderate fortune. With that face, you will have no shortage of candidates. But do not be deceived. A woman’s loveliness is a distraction, as it will inevitably fade. If she spends her time eating pastries and reading novels, she will soon lose both her figure and her complexion. Wit can be a distractor as well; a sharp tongue will quickly become a source of vexation. Choose wisely. The wife of a doctor must be clever enough to make ends meet on an income that will certainly be inadequate, once she begins to produce children. Do not marry a woman who will spend your salary on hats and dresses and gloves. She must be hard-working, not flirtatious, and resourceful, not vain. A woman who thinks herself finer than she is will become a shrew. I recommend that you have no more than three children, two boys and a girl. More than three will tax your resources. The boys may follow you into medicine, or law, perhaps. The girl, if she is as pretty as her father, may marry above her class.”
He cracks a couple eggs into the pan he’s set on the burner. Breakfast for supper, as most days. He often skips the morning meal, just a cup of tea to tide him over until lunch. Most days that’s a tin of soup, though occasionally he splurges on coffee and a sandwich at the shop down the road. He could probably eat more, but he finds that he’s not hungry most days. Weeks of battling a gut infection left his bowels a mess, and he doesn’t like to load himself down with heavy food.
Sitting beside Holmes, he watches himself lying there for a moment. Then he sees the door of the bar open, Holmes running out, kneeling and checking him. In less than a minute Lestrade arrives. He stands and gives instructions to two cops, who head down the alley. Holmes doesn’t move from Watson’s side. He appears to be talking to Watson, maybe yelling at him, trying to rouse him.
Taking my silence as agreement, she continued. “I have in mind several women who would be suitable. You are a passably good-looking man, though no one would call you handsome. And you are my son. If you are bringing in upper class clients, there are families who would find you a suitable son-in-law. Do not call yourself a
I would go home and wait for Lestrade.
“You don’t have an acting reputation to defend,” Sherlock pointed out. “What demands is Martha making?”
“You’re a great actor. Better than ninety percent of the actors out there.”
He used his key to let himself in the front door. He heard quiet music, a Mozart piano sonata, coming from the ground floor flat. This meant that his downstairs neighbour, a literary agent, was home, but she was a quiet person who lived a boring life, no flatmate. An ideal neighbour.
he thought. “Good.”
Instead, I imagine that I didn’t leave, that I stayed with you. I’d have been there when the building across the street blew up. Gas leak, they said. But it wasn’t. I can imagine the shock of waking up to a bomb going off, the two of us out of our beds, running into the sitting room, checking to see if we’re all right. Even you must have been panicked when that happened. Maybe we would have grabbed each other—
Weeping into his pillow, Sherlock remembers their first night together in this bed. Kissing John had felt urgent, inevitable. It nearly erased the awful memory of the night he kissed Victor, when Victor had drawn away, his face twisted with disgust, and the things he had said. John’s response, so different, had made him think that he could have the thing he’d denied himself for so long. He deserved to be loved.
“What can I make for you and your lovely date tonight, Mr Holmes?”
“You would leave me?”
“I am aware of that,” I said, lounging back in my seat. “If
“I don’t intend to use it,” I replied. “We’re dealing with a dangerous man, Watson, one who threatens people daily. I’d like to have a threat of my own. I am not a man to lose my head. Not as hot-headed as some people I
He’d always accepted that loving your parents (and even your brother) was necessary, if only because you had to share a house with them, and saying you didn’t love them would have been awkward, and might have meant fewer biscuits and less cake, things he liked very much.
Gregson and Lestrade exchanged looks. “They both mention the veiled woman,” Lestrade said. “And he was dressed as if he expected to meet someone. Nothing on his calendar, though.”
“Actually, no. I specifically forbade her and Lestrade from telling me anything about you. I prefer to use my own eyes and ears.”
“Have you eaten here before?” John asks. He wonders if he should have said
“Let’s head back,” Holmes says. His exhaustion is beginning to show.
He’s allowed to close his eyes. Pressure on his arm. Voices.
my flatmate.”
“John, you were in shock. You probably—“
“Thank you,” John says. She returns his smile.
“I need to talk to him. I think he knows someone, a person I need to contact. Perhaps you could just give me his address so I can send him a note?”
Watson takes the chair. “I thought you might have done it this time,” he says.
On the other hand, it seems like exhibitionism to sit alone in a pub, getting pissed, on display for everyone to see how fucked up his life is. Well, at least he has a life.
Sherlock frowned. “As an alien?”
“You have a great boyfriend,” Moana said. Or it might have been Megara. I wondered if I should add photos to my list, just to avoid confusion.
This was Alex’s line; he was supposed to have said it to Holly just before he told her he loved her. Instead, John was saying it to him.
He frowned, certain that he was revealing more about himself that he realised. “What about John?”
“I’ll get it for you,” the guy sitting in Sam’s seat says. They were introduced, he remembers. Michael is his name, or maybe Mark. Dark, artfully messy hair, pale skin and eyes that might be green. Slim black jeans, fitted shirt. Laying a hand on John’s arm, he says, “Be right back.” And he winks.
“Gay? Yes, I am.”
if I could stop seeing you on the pavement— then you would be out of this limbo, laid in your grave. Then I would have to face that I will never see you coming through the door of our flat again, never hear you pacing the floor at night, or find you asleep on the sofa in the morning. I’ll never hear you make brilliant deductions or play the violin at two a.m.— and if I can face all that, accept it as true and real and irrevocable, you will cease to exist.
“There have been a series of suicides…” He glances at the open drawer beside the bed, sees dark metal there.
“It’s nobody else’s business,” John says. “I’m sorry you were offended, but frankly, I didn’t want to talk to her at all, let alone inform her that I’m sleeping with my flatmate.”
who may one day get bored solving crimes and decide to murder someone for fun, John has already made up his mind. He has never seen an intellect like Sherlock’s in action, never felt so alive himself, and he completely understands why Scotland Yard treats him with disdain. Of course he seems like a freak to them; all they know is procedure; they don’t know what
“Well, you have a month to figure it out.”
Well, most actors. Having acted in a couple of films and two successful television series (
The next time he opens his eyes, things are much less agonisingly bright. There are no sirens screaming, no people shouting at him. His brain still feels slow, like someone adjusted his dial, turning him down to low. Not exactly a hung-over feeling (of which he has altogether too much experience). He smells antiseptic and coffee, hears rubber shoes squeaking on the floor, someone being paged.
“It seems that Mr Hosmer Angel intends to pay us a call today,” I told Watson.
This made him laugh again. “Oh, I suppose I am responsible for corrupting you, hm? Well, I will not cease to do so. It is not a vice, but healthy for us both, much better than tobacco and other things. So, you will not quit smoking? Then you must take me on a holiday if I win the wager. Somewhere exotic and romantic, for at least a week. And the entire time you must do nothing but eat, sleep, and let me corrupt you.”
We returned to Baker Street. Mrs Hudson was shocked, then tearful, then angry at us both. “Do you see this grey hair?” she said. “That’s my reward for looking after the two of you.”
“Yes, well. You’ll be receiving some more boxes in a bit. I’ve taken the liberty of having some of John’s things packed up so he’ll have something to wear, if that should be necessary.”
Sherlock’s eyes soften. “And here I am.”
He tells her about Watson, how badly misses him. More accurately, he grieves him. The story of how they met, oh so long ago now, makes her smile. It’s good to talk about it, but it doesn’t ease the pain of his heart. She understands that kind of pain. It’s what Life is made of, love and loss.
It amazes him that John could think himself so unworthy. “John, you are not a
“Yeah, about that… You might want to tone down the deducing. Give the bloke a chance.”
He turned without a word and walked through the door.
He took it readily, savoured it for a while, his tongue darting out to catch the honey on his lips. “I’ve never tasted anything so… enigmatic.” He sat back, and I put his teacup into his hands.
is home. It’s John.
At first I drank a lot. I went through all the liquor in the flat in one week, thinking I could forget if I soaked my brain with enough alcohol. It didn’t work, but that didn’t stop me. I wasn’t reasoning well in those first days. But eventually I quit, mostly because I couldn’t get myself off the sofa to go buy more bottles.
“Good. That’s good.”
He sits on the bed, regarding me uncertainly. “Aren’t you going to take off your clothes, too?”
Sherlock gestured. “Go on. Open it.”
“Friends. Back in school. You said you wondered. I used to wonder the same thing sometimes. I would have liked having you for a friend.”
Spending the evening with a woman was tedious. I tried to follow her chatter, but found that she seemed content if I merely gazed at her with admiration. An hour was all I could take. I dropped her off at her door, stood for a moment twisting my cap nervously like a schoolboy, hoping she would not expect a kiss.
“But you’re selling the house—
The weather was frosty, the kind of cold that is not slushy, but brittle. We went briskly, our breath crystallising in front of our faces as we walked. The afternoon was already growing into twilight. Watson kept quiet, sensible that I was thinking.
Brook entered last, chatting with Mrs Hudson.
“Come on,” Michael says. “Get up. Before you get too loopy, we need to go.”
“Yes, canines are essential,” Dr Watson said, grinning wolfishly.
before you let them know where you are.”
“I’m not suggesting anything,” Sherlock replies. “I’m giving you time to
Monday after work, John goes to meet with the group for the first time. He’s worried about Sherlock, who hasn’t spoken to him since their abruptly-ended call. The few texts John has sent have gone unanswered. Clearly, there are a lot of things to work out. He hopes the group will help.

“You died in this room.” It seemed clear to me that he had no concept of the time that had passed between his death and the present moment. Ghosts did not count time.
Molly Hooper opens her locker and reaches for her coat. The morning had been cold, so she’d worn her scarf and hat to work as well. A long day, ending much later than she’d planned, but she’s finally completed one of the two autopsies that Greg has been asking about, as well as all the paperwork Sanjit left for her to deal with when his wife went into labour ahead of schedule. He’ll be off for a month, without anyone to replace him.
“Because when people have concerns they go to you rather than speaking up during rehearsal, where I am the designated arsehole. Nobody wants to be me, so they keep quiet and complain to you.”
“Hush, now. I’ll take care of you,” he said.
They should give parents a manual when kids suddenly become different people, he thinks. He knows invading a teen’s privacy is not good, but he’s a parent and sometimes that means setting limits. “Rosie,” he calls. “It’s Daddy. Dad.”
It’s early days, still. Too soon to worry. Instead of calling Doctor Gurung several times a day, he surfs the internet, continually checking what’s within the parameters of
“A lung?” He’d been expecting something quite different.
Sherlock shrugs. “An informed hypothesis.”
would have ended. Being closeted hadn’t bothered him much. As a rule, he didn’t care if people accepted him for who he was.
“For those foolish and indiscreet enough to get caught,” Watson added, aiming a significant look at me.
“I didn’t know you were so fond of poetry,” Watson said, reclaiming his body parts from my curious fingers.
“I’m really sorry,” he says. “I shouldn’t have… God, Molly. I’ll just go.”
I’ve confiscated my laptop to type up something for the blog, and you’re reading or maybe writing notes. Or just thinking. Tidying up the Mind Palace or something. Some nights we would watch a movie or some crap telly. You would make fun of it— the stupid plot, the idiot people— but you always stayed and watched with me, the two of us on the sofa together. Your brain would calm at times like that. I always wondered how you, who need to fill every moment with brain work, could just sit there with me, watching a show about renovating old houses or baking cakes. Were you filing information away in your Mind Palace? Maybe you just wanted to feel normal, to get a glimpse inside the funny little brains around you.
“What are you doing now?” he asks the urn.
. Sighing, he raised it to his ear. “What do you want, Mycroft?”
“I promise; I will.”
“You’re not staying?” His voice startles me, coming out of the dark.
“I feel… amazing.” He laughs out loud. “Like I could live forever.”
— wouldn’t I use an alias? Something
He still pays the rent, a fact which now makes sense. I was too messed up to think it through when I realised he was doing it. Now, I understand. We’re both waiting.
At Milford School, though, I felt more alone than ever. I could not even claim a family tie here, only the sullen companionship of boys similarly bereft, without any prospects in the world. I did not even have John to keep me company. This was indeed sad place to have arrived in life, where a ghost would have been better company than flesh and blood.
Sherlock has no friends; just one. John is Sherlock’s only friend, his only love, the object of all his devotion. It must always be a chaste love, an unspoken, hidden love. To keep John, to protect him, Sherlock must never speak his love out loud.
Nothing else to see there, so he listened outside the bedroom door, just in case. It was half open, a hard clue to decipher. Though he lived alone, Sherlock always closed his own door at night. Having a nosy older brother meant that he had an overdeveloped need for privacy. Some people left their doors open for air circulation. No telling which kind of sleeper John was; they had never shared a room except on set.
“Where?”
“Only you.” Watson moaned, already close to crisis.
Holmes is crazy, he thinks, even more so than the guy who tried to kill him. Murderers have an agenda. It’s a crazy agenda, but at least you can understand what they’re about. He’s not sure what brand of crazy Holmes might be or what his agenda is.
That was the problem.
My hand hovers over the doorknob.
“I know.” Sherlock is still looking at him. “What I mean to say is this: I am who I am, Watson. You’ve seen enough of me to have no doubt that I’m rude, arrogant, insensitive, and abrasive. I’ll deduce what you want to hide, announce it in the worst possible situations. I’ll trample your feelings, and I won’t apologise. I forget to talk sometimes, for days, even. I don’t live by the clock. I stay up and play violin at all hours, fall asleep when you’re talking to me, forget to eat, and leave a mess wherever I go because I’m always thinking about something else. You won’t change me, Watson. People have tried. God knows, my parents tried, my brother tried. Even Lestrade tries sometimes. So if you’re thinking you can fix me, the way you always want to fix every fucking thing that’s wrong in the world, as if you’re responsible for making everything right, you can forget it. Moving in here with me is definitely a symptom of incipient insanity, but I think I might just drive you round the twist.”
If you are going to accuse him of murder, at least you can call him a
When he joined the army, he was prepared to listen and take orders. Giving orders wasn’t so hard in that setting, either. He’d never seen himself as a leader, but found that he could put on a persona when he had to. Captain Watson wasn’t a talker, but he wasn’t shy, either.
He stares at the key for a while, trying to remember what he’s supposed to do with it. A keyhole, that’s right. He needs a keyhole.
John lays his hand on her shoulder. “No, Mrs Hudson. Your hip—“
“Having a reunion at all is a bad idea,” said Sherlock. “Remember, you heard it from me first. I refused, said no, and let myself be talked into it against my better judgment. But there’s no going back now. Molly says that they’re revising the script. Maybe it’ll be good.” He grinned.
“Yes, way better than killing someone. But still.”
“Oh. Oh! I… I’m sorry. Truly sorry. I imagine that I am partly responsible… I mean, ruining your proposal. She must have—“
For Sherlock, it was a final moment to be remembered in a lifetime of moments, the last memory he would have of John. The day he met John, reading lines together for the first time. The hurried lunches on set, the script sessions, rehearsals, publicity tours. The final episode, the goodbyes. The day Sherlock, sitting in rehab and watching a flickering telly, heard that the boy he loved had killed himself.
“You’re thinking,” says Holmes. He’s collapsed into his chair and is now pressing fingers to his forehead, like he might have a headache. “Speak. I’m not psychic.”
He smiled. “You would not have taken such a risk for our client, whom you called foolish. It’s because of the note he sent you that you looked. He was threatening me.”
Two days later another case arrived in the post. By that time Watson was regaining his ability to sit without wincing, but seemed to prefer standing. A bit more
she’d said.
“Your secret is safe with me, John. I didn’t come here to expose you. I just had to know if you were alive. If you don’t want to tell me, that’s fine. I’ll go.”
“Your father’s brother?”
John stood in the doorway, wearing a t-shirt and a pair of Sherlock’s pyjamas (rolled up at the ankles). He smelled like Sherlock’s shampoo, his skin glowing, his hair poking up like a hedgehog. Sherlock couldn’t help himself. He needed to touch that compact body, feel his warm, damp skin, and remind himself that John wasn’t dead.
“Professor Bellamy!” Watson called, hurrying across the lobby towards an older man in evening dress. He had a beard that was neatly trimmed, laced with grey.
with him!
“Like a disguise.”
He shook his head. “I disagree. Nothing good can come out of it. The danger is that we might be discovered, and shooting someone can in no way make that better.”
“Your hand. It still shows the indentation from your wedding ring. She had an affair while you were gone. You wore the ring for a few weeks, thinking you might reconcile, but now you’ve clearly put it behind you, or you wouldn’t be here tonight, on a date.”
. Quite an upstanding citizen, as most believe, but with a rather risky habit of visiting male brothels. His written description of their encounters— yes, it was more than once— might sell well. I’m sure I could find a few buyers if they don’t interest you.” He laughed again. “ Are you truly surprised? Perhaps you don’t know your doctor as well as you think. At any rate, in exchange for writing up his adventures with your boy, I will allow this person to pursue his political career without fear of exposure. You can purchase these documents for the price I have stated and pursue your own career, such as it is, keeping your own secrets safe. It is always satisfying to kill two birds with one stone.”
“Two things. First, an address and phone number for a cab driver calling himself Jason Bradford. I have his cab number if that helps.”
There’s something about coming face to face with a person who is vaguely familiar and clearly recognises you that makes one feel obligated to stay and chat. Mike Stamford, the bloke he sat next to in Anatomy, looks delighted to run into him, and he can’t very well say,
The priest is asking him, “Will you take this man to be your husband? Will you love him, comfort him, honour and protect him, and, forsaking all others, be faithful to him as long as you both shall live?”
I looked at his sleeping form, now young and handsome, just as he was on the day we met. Two young men, hungry for danger and adventure and mystery.
He looks at the floor. “I’m not getting married.”
“No, she’s not.” He sits back, arms folded, frowning thoughtfully. “She’s no idiot. But I don’t believe she’s who she pretends to be, now that I think about it. Lots of tells, not the usual ones. She didn’t seem at all nervous or worried, which would have been expected while her boyfriend was having a meltdown. She looked me straight in the eye after he walked off, smiled and said,
John is a social interpreter, a human handler of sorts.
“Yeah, but you’re going to have to give me a day or so. I’ve got something I need to finish by tonight— for a
But he smiled at me as I prodded him, and I slowed my pace to accommodate his limp. When we reached Hyde Park, I managed to hail us a cab.
“If he’s going to help us, he needs to know how serious this killer is,” Holmes snaps. “Now, describe what you saw on the footage. Better yet, show it to me. Send it now, so that I can open it on my laptop.”
I developed a reputation for my interactions with ghosts, and this was how I began to earn a living from my unusual talent. People whose homes were haunted wrote to me, asking if I would come and see their ghost, find out what might make it go away. Others had questions for their dear departed, sometimes mundane (where is the will?) and more often personal (are you happy?) My ability to answer these questions gained me new clients. In time, I was able to pay my rent without my brother’s assistance.
“Well, I am.” She gestured at the candle, the wine, the entire ambience of the restaurant. “And look at us both. It doesn’t matter what John was. You felt something for him. How you still feel about him is colouring this little production.”
“No. Well, yes. I am seeing someone.” Before he gets into that, he needs to ask her something. “Harry, do men ever flirt with you?”
He might have said the same thing about himself. John was the first person he had dared to love, the one who made him realise that he was capable of loving.
John sees that the tiny spleen is smiling and saying,
“You’re looking for a flatmate,” he says.
“I can sing. And I actually love dancing. My mother made sure I had lessons growing up.”
You’d take it, wouldn’t you? Of course you would. You were ready to take the poison pill the cabbie gave you. You’d risk your life to prove you’re clever.
They stand outside the station, waiting for a cab. Holmes hasn’t spoken since he said he needed to think, and Watson hasn’t interrupted whatever process he’s going through.
“Oh, John,” I groaned. “Don’t go.” I sat up and glared down at him. “I refuse to accept your resignation.”
Once that was taken care of, I handed the phone back to Ariel/Rosamund.
“And the boyfriends? It’s fine, by the way.”
. He snorts and sits down on the landing. Looking up, he sees Holmes, remembers the key and the door.
Sherlock gives him a small, rueful smile. “You assume that some event precipitated my fall into drugs. No, nothing made me.
“A cuppa would be fine. And one of those chocolate things,” he said, pointing at the case.
I’ve always had passions— science, music, crime-solving— and I thought they were enough. You are the essential element I never knew I was missing. I want all those things—
“Talk to him, John. He’s there, waiting. And he has things to say to you as well.”
In reply, he pulled John to him and kissed him. “I’m hungry, too,” he purred.
“Oh, didn’t Ella…? I mean, I thought you shared notes and things.”
He was nervous. After being alone for so long, avoiding relationships, he wasn’t sure how this would work. Sex was obviously going to be part of whatever they were now, but his prior experiences had always been unromantic, transactional. He’d abstained for several years now, since his last rehab, both drugs and sex, unwilling to risk attachment, which would lead to poor judgement, and ultimately disappointment. That was what Mycroft had drummed into him, and he had to admit that it had made life simpler. Fewer decisions, fewer distractions, fewer opportunities to fall. He’d stumbled into drugs, but found his feet again, and his career had grown as a result of his focus. As an actor, he had a future.
“Well, I don’t hate you now. I just love you. I’m glad you stalked me until I realised it.”
His father never told him he should be something; he only said he should fight back. Other boys bragged about what they were going to do with their lives, but they all knew it was really bravado, whistling in the dark so they didn’t have to face the awful truth, that they would be no more than their fathers. Watson remembered getting the acceptance letter from the Priory School, his father warning him that he wouldn’t fit in, that it was a waste of time. But his dream was coming true, and he didn’t listen. He
There is a silence, in which John imagines her refilling her glass. “So, what’s bothering you, little brother?”
He smiles grimly. The John Watson Smile of Danger. “Deduce it, Sherlock. Only two people involved. She didn’t break it off. I did.”
During the night he lies next to Watson, wrapping himself around the cold body, listening for the heartbeat that comes every few minutes. Every now and then the still form takes a visible breath, but otherwise he does not move.
I muffled my sobs in the pillow.
“Of course you are,” she says. “You say mean things because you’re defensive. Words slip out because subconsciously you want to drive people away. You never let anyone close enough to see the real you.”
“Very good, Watson. I’m proud of you, and glad to know that you have discarded your romantic rose-coloured lenses.”
A dense forest, silent as a tomb. Dark, though he could just spy the sun behind the trunks of tall trees that surrounded him, a disk nearly as pale as the moon.
“Forget all that,” he tells Lestrade. “I’m in shock. See? Blanket.”
“Everybody knows about your past, Sherlock. While those things may be categorised as
We lay tangled in the sheets. Wanting to see his face, I let him take my prick from above. As I felt myself swallowed up inside of of him, I experienced such ecstasy that I could barely contain myself. He slowed at my signal, allowing my excitement to build slowly, filling my belly with an anxious warmth that finally was released when he whispered in my ear,
Even if I had the money, or could borrow it from my brother, paying blackmail would only give him power over me, and let him ruin more people without any interference. I would be under his thumb for the rest of my career.
, would you? You need a subject pronoun, not an object pronoun.”
He watched the cab pull away, automatically noting the plate number.
The image of himself lying in an alley with his entrails spilling out gives him a hard shudder. He’s seen plenty of disturbing things in his time in Afghanistan, but that was a war zone. Last night was just an evening out with the mates, harmless fun, loud music and too much alcohol.
He reviews the gym’s security footage, finds the blip where something has been deleted. Lestrade obtains video from the parking lot which clearly shows the victim getting out of his car and walking towards the door just as the gym is closing up. He is let inside by Chisled Abs, aka Steven Vincent.
I remind myself.
. Mary hasn’t mentioned moving, but it doesn’t actually surprise him. Her book is doing well, and she’s probably got a deal to write the next one. She can finally move up, leave all the trappings of this tawdry old life behind.
John rolled his eyes. “Oh, that’s rich. You break into my flat, go through my things, and now you’re threatening me. I could call the police right now, tell them you were robbing me, deny that I’m who you say I am. See what that kind of publicity might do for you.”
“My dear, of course I agree,” I said all in a rush. “I promise I won’t lie to you again.” Tears welled up in my eyes. “Please. Don’t go away, John. I’ll keep you in my confidence. You have my word. Only — don’t leave me.”
He’s working so hard on how to begin this, that he doesn’t notice John rising from his chair and standing in front of him, leaning over him.
“Well, then. I’ll tell you. I do have a secret, but it’s not the one you want. Here it is:
Why one of them always leaves is harder to explain.
John Watson is putting on his best suit and regretting that he agreed to this. The suit hangs loose on him, and he’s not used to wearing a tie.
Watson talked with Miss Chadwick, carefully mindful of my warning not to flirt. While we were dressing for dinner I had advised him to frown more. “Whether you intend it or not, every woman thinks you are trying to seduce her. Do not lead her on.”
He heaves a sigh. “Sherlock, I know that Mike and Molly set me up with you because they feel sorry for me. You’re not obligated to another date.”
The place begins to fill up; the music is louder. Christopher and Matt get up to dance. More people have joined their group, and he’s not sure who all of them are. Daniel is dancing with someone, and Sam— he doesn’t see Sam. But he’s relaxed, having a good time. He can leave when he feels ready to go. Not yet, though. Watching the crowd, observing interactions, he finishes off his drink and thinks about another.
He picked a different pub this time, because he didn’t want Sherlock Holmes to make another unannounced entrance and deduce his misery, arriving in another swirl of coat— and how does he do that? Watson’s never been able to make a coat swirl. Probably something about leg length and the ratio of knees to something. Yet another thing that Watson will never be able to do properly because Fate assigned him short genes. Swirling a coat dramatically. Getting things off the top shelf. Looking good in a tuxedo. Stupid genetics. A short, drunk father. A short, drunk sister. Short people don’t get to swirl. They drink to cover the shame of it.
John is silent for a moment, gazing idly at the neighbourhood they’re passing through. They’re on their way to a crime scene, one difficult enough that Scotland Yard is calling in an amateur to help them. But the Yard doesn’t consult amateurs, which means that Sherlock must be able to do to a crime scene what he just did to John, deducing his entire life from a phone.
The evening is like every other night in London between November and May, chilly and damp, no sign of stars. They walk in silence for a while. He’s getting re-acclimated to the city, she imagines, cataloguing the things that have changed. She remembers returning home after her first term at university, marvelling at how all the familiar things seemed both less and more than what she had remembered. To a man with an eidetic memory, this London must be bewildering, what with all the small changes she hardly notices from day to day. He looks unsettled, she thinks, even a bit daunted. Still getting used to it all.
“Dr Eccles isn’t a marriage counsellor.”
It occurs to Watson that Wilkes might have delegated someone to walk them to their room, but would rather make sure Holmes doesn’t talk to anyone. He doesn’t usually leap to conclusions about things like this, but Wilkes is making him uneasy. He notes the way Holmes is looking at him, too. He’s trying to cover something up; and he’ll try to get rid of them as soon as he’s managed whatever situation is occupying Dr Huxtable.
“Every man wants an heir, does he not?” I replied. “It would please my mother to see the family name carried on. I confess that I had not thought about marriage before meeting you, but now, having considered it more thoroughly, I admit that it is a sensible move for a bachelor such as myself. As a woman, you have many natural talents that I lack. You will be the angel who smooths over chaos of my existence, providing an orderly environment for the important work I do. We will, of course, have people to do the laundry and the cooking. My mother will insist. And the children must have a tutor, I suppose. Hm. How many children would you be willing to have? I would not like us to extend ourselves, but if you wish—“
Her gloved hand touched his arm. She smiled, lowering her lashes. “Thank you. Your service to me is of inestimable worth.”
Or maybe
would you?”
Watson had always stuck by me before, I told myself. There was the time when he discovered my morphine in the hollowed-out book. He forgave me that, but demanded my continued sobriety. He had not fallen for any of the women who threw themselves at him— Miss Wickham, Miss Morstan, Miss Chadwick— or any of the other silly females that sought his attention. And he had not found a wife after I died. Instead, he bought into the diamond mine venture. His heart might still be mine, I hoped.
He watches as Sherlock taps at his phone, apparently sending a text to someone. He hands it back to John.
Molly returned her smile, but said nothing.
Watson (
His wallet is empty and his bank account doesn’t have enough to cover what looks like will be a very expensive meal. As a man, he has always picked up the tab on dates, but there was no discussion about who would pay when tonight was arranged. He assumes they will split the bill since neither of them did the asking. Even so, he won’t have enough to cover his own meal. That will be embarrassing.
She slides onto the floor next to him, puts her arms around him.
I began to read aloud. “
(221B). Vampire Sherlock; werewolf John.
He smiles. “Mrs Hudson was getting suspicious. I’ve had to consume oceans of soup so she would think you were eating.”
Dead. John Watson, dead at 20. John Watson, dead by his own hand… John Watson.
“Four,” he says. “You killed three people. I’m the fourth.”
“How did they let you in?” Sherlock asks, exasperated. “They interrogated me.”
He needs to go somewhere, get out of the flat until John has picked up his possessions and gone somewhere else. Sherlock doesn’t want to know where he goes, just as long as he doesn’t come back. If he sees John again, he might change his mind, and he’ll be right back in this same hell.
By the time they’d made it through the final scene, Sherlock felt as if he’d spent six hours being quacked at and pecked by ducks. Everyone wanted to make suggestions; Irene had patiently taken notes and promised that when they had their next rehearsal it would be much smoother. Sherlock just wanted it over, done, sorted.
Philip Hughes nodded. “This is brilliant.” He smiled at me. “This will revolutionise the science of criminal investigation.”
John laughs. “Walking away was what I was trying to do, but you kept finding me.”
He returns to London only when the name Sherlock Holmes has been forgotten.
“But you did?”
“This is the boy I told you about, Mr Grimshaw,” my aunt said. “I think he might benefit from your school.”
“I may have.”
He flung the book at me, striking my head. For a moment I was dazed, but then, even angrier, I began to punch him, going for the areas where it would hurt the most. “I’ll stab your eyes out, you thief! I’ll kill you!”
“What a woman!” he said, shaking his head. “Had she had been on my level, I might have married her. A pity, is it not?”
“I’m not a child, John. I don’t need a mother.”
I’m looking for you. I know you’re here.
She pushed her salad plate to the side. “Yes.”
Suddenly he realises that he has no money to pay for this meal.
“Today we’re going to work on a couple of scenes. But let me start by giving you an overview of the changes.”
“When he heard John had committed suicide three years later, it disturbed him. He felt guilty for keeping quiet, so we had a drink and he told me. As far as I know, he never told anyone else.”
He slumps over again, passively exposing his back to the whip.
At the same time, I was beginning to realise a certain unfathomable dread at the prospect of facing a person who had traveled to the beyond, to a world the living are not meant to know. Every hair on my body rose in fear of what I understood on a gut level ought to be terrifying.
“Oh, god,” Matt says, running his hand through his hair. This motion completely undoes the little man-bun and he has to re-gather the hair to keep it off his face. There’s no one else in the cafe now, long after the lunch rush.
“Hm.” Sherlock lapsed into silence once more. Lestrade didn’t press him.
This answer is the rhetorical equivalent of
“Divorced,” Sherlock says. “Or separated. Since your return.”
She’s apparently already scouted out the first floor and knows where the stairs are. They hear her feet going up, the floor above them creaking a bit.
“Child pornography,” I said. “Extremely profitable business. Didn’t your mother ever warn you about strangers?”
I’m not sure what a remarkable funeral would look like, but it ought to be something that better represents you, who were remarkable in so many ways. Something grand, amazing, and a bit obnoxious. It should reflect who you were.
Sherlock, though clearly not a cat person, allows Lu to rub against him, leaving hair on his trousers. Tiger follows Molly into the kitchen, sits watching as she puts the kettle on and drops teabags in two mugs. She shakes out more dry food for the cats, takes a packet of biscuits from the cupboard. Sherlock stands in the doorway, watching her.
Watson gave me a stony look. “Of course,
“I love cake,” he sobbed. “And I hate
The DI shrugs. “Well, happy to see it’s working out. Come on up and have a look.”
“Money isn’t what I want, Mister Holmes.”
Listen, John H Watson. You’re going to die tonight. In one second or one hour, you decide. So lie to me. Tell me the first thing off the top of your head. Make something up. I don't give a shit. I have a gun.
A paradox, perhaps. I like to think that while you were hating me all those years, a part of you felt such passionate hatred only because you also loved me. If you’d been indifferent, you wouldn’t have even remembered me.”
“Th’ grape,” John says. “It’s a grape.”
He sighed, but did not argue the point any further.
There are too many choices here; Rosie could be anywhere in the city. She could have hopped on a train and be on her way to somewhere, anywhere. John has no idea what she would do, where she would go. He can’t solve this puzzle.
Ella has asked him a question. Frowning, he looks up and tries to remember what it was. Since he isn’t really listening, all he can recall is the sound of her voice. The look on her face is calm and kind, as always, the sort of vigilant patience all therapists learn. He knows her intent is to help him open up, but it’s almost predatory the way she looks for the cracks in his veneer. She’s already got two possible questions planned, depending on his answer. Even though it’s obvious that he’s not paying attention.
believe I’ve not had a day off in all the time I’ve been your partner, Holmes.”
“I don’t know your mum,” John said. “Have you run away from home as well?”
That was where he stood now, on the edge of something he hadn’t seen coming and didn’t understand. It scared the hell out of him.
If he’d thought that having a romantic/sexual relationship with a man would be easier than it was with women, he was clearly wrong. He’d liked the fact that they don’t need a long conversation every time they have a disagreement. With Mary it was always like hammering out a major treaty between two world powers. He never argued much, so maybe it was more like the loser conceding to the terms dictated by the winner.
He hasn’t heard of the place, but suspects it’s a gay bar. What signals is he giving off?
John thinks about how his day was going before Sherlock knocked on his door. It wasn’t going well, he recalls. He felt pitiful, old, useless. He’d taken a risk and it had failed, leaving him more depressed that before. He isn’t sure where his day would have ended, but the contrast to what has happened since Sherlock knocked on his door is almost incomprehensible. He’s seen a glimpse of a life that’s within his reach. He doesn’t know what Sherlock has in mind, but he is open to it, whatever it may be. Anything is better than slowly rotting away in a dreary flat, limping to therapy appointments and having no purpose. This excites him, reminds him why he went into emergency medicine, why he joined the army. Not just to be useful, but in pursuit of the rush that comes with risk. He needs this, desperately, if he is to stay alive.
“I have no objection to that. Really, it’s not that bad.”
Hearing his name, he would stop and turn, his eyes widening in shock.
“Everywhere.”
, he tells himself.
She could not have chosen a worse button to push. Sherlock only hoped his face was not betraying him.
“They have. Which is how I know it’s not just a rumour. But it’s very secret right now. You can’t even tell Greg. I can trust you, right?”
“I’m assuming some sort of statement will be made,” Mrs Hudson said. “Unless we acknowledge John’s absence, our performance may seem in poor taste.”
“Give me!” Once the missive was in my hands, I paused, almost afraid to know what it said. A single sheet, folded. I opened it and read:
John is grinning up at him. The lines around his eyes are deeper, his hair is more silver than gold now, but he’s even more handsome than the day he limped into Barts. He’s happy.
was of documents relating to our client, to protect her from blackmail. Perhaps that is a crime, technically, but Milverton’s many crimes have gone unpunished for years. Is it any surprise that one of his victims struck back, taking the revenge that the law denied her?”
ended and he began his film career, someone who might have noticed a change in his behaviour. A person planning to commit suicide might distance themselves from people they knew, but would they go to the trouble of hiring a new manager?
“Nothing,” he replies. “Have you got that liver you were saving for me?”
The writers have decided she needs a baby.”
I made an impatient gesture. “It’s only money. Take whatever you like. I can live on tea and toast, as long as I have an occasional cigar.”
Thank you for your comments and kudos, dear readers!
The chances of finding such a person seem slim.
He smirked a bit. “Shall I tell you now? I suppose I am as certain as I ever will be. Very well. I have known you all your life, Sherlock. As your older brother, I spent more time with you than anyone else while you were growing up. You have always been dear to me, and a source of worry as I observed your character develop. It was around the time that our father died that I realised that in spite of your brilliance, you were not a very moral person.”
John shakes his head and does not sit. He stands silent, clenching and unclenching his hands, looking at Rosie. His voice is quiet when he speaks; he always sounds calm when he’s really angry. She knows.
While he listened to the water running and tried not to imagine John naked in his shower, Sherlock made tea. It was really too late for tea, but he couldn’t think of what else to do with himself.
Now I did not dare look at Watson.
“I’m… fine.” He frowns. “I’m sorry, I don’t remember. Did we meet last night?”
A dramatic choice. No better way to make known your intent to kill yourself than to say,
That’s simply who Sherlock is. The unpredictability of life with him is stimulating, but it has a darker side. Right now, for instance, John isn’t sure whether Sherlock has decided to do something about the milk situation, in which case he’ll be back in a bit with carton of half-skim and several packets of biscuits. Or maybe he’s gone over to Barts to get something from Molly which he will put in the refrigerator when he gets home and hope that John doesn’t notice. Or he may have rushed off after a suspect and is now lying in an alley bleeding to death.
Watson: I'm aware that you think I romanticise your cases, but honestly--
“Or you might leave the gas on, burn down the entire block. A million people die in home accidents each year, in the UK alone. Don’t quote me. A million ways it’s unsafe to leave you home alone. I’m a detective, I know what people get up to at home, and how many of them end up as corpses. No, you can’t be trusted on your own yet. You need looking after.” He frowns at Watson as if this is all one great, sodding inconvenience.
“What makes you think it was him?” Stamford asked. They were meeting at a coffee shop. Sherlock was holding a cup of latte and bouncing his leg impatiently as he watched Mike slowly bite into a raspberry danish.
“Oh, yes. I’m very interested to hear what Mr Carmichael, charismatic leader of young bullies, has to say.”
The young man leaned forwards. “Mr Holmes, I have to say something to you. You will think me foolishly romantic, but I feel that in meeting you, I have had my mind opened to many ideas. I see that I have been wallowing in the esoteric, while you have found application for your intellect. Miss Chadwick is right. Poetry, literature, pure mathematics— these things are important only as we can apply them to real life.” He blushed. “You must think me naive. I am in love with knowledge and have little experience with life.”
"John! No— you--"
“Splendid. Mind, you must not interfere in any way. Once I go inside, you will wait at the window for my signal.”
“Police procedurals are gold. Two more years and you’ll be able to create your own series, pick your co-stars.”
on the side, an ordinary container like the ones found at picnics and sporting events. It occurred to him that accepting anything from Brook might be risky. He was quite thirsty, though. Surely Brook wouldn’t try anything tonight. Irene had said he wouldn’t, that he needed this boost to his career.
The trustees of the school had made inquiries after the deaths and found the school wanting, the building cold and the children malnourished. Mr Grimshaw remained, but now, inexplicably, there was money for better food, warmer blankets, and new teachers. The entire building was scrubbed and repainted from top to bottom, and even the teachers seemed less miserable. For us boys, it felt almost like heaven.
“Will you?” Sherlock’s face wore a curious expression. He wasn’t smirking or waiting to see if John could outdo him. He looked as if he really wanted to see if John would go with this. “Will you marry me, John?”
be a woman, and that is all that matters), he’ll realise. His apology to Sherlock will be sincere, and he’ll probably even shed a few tears. But being with this woman will feel more right than being with Sherlock ever did.
at least a dozen times a day. And he’ll get to see that rare smile, when the puzzle is solved, and maybe Watson deserves a small portion of the credit.
It set Sherlock’s teeth on edge.

“What are you doing here? Where is this place?”

He gave a short laugh. “One would think that a man who blackmails people would have a formidable strongbox. We were lucky in that.” He took another piece of toast and a rasher of bacon.
There was one search he could easily set in motion. He hated calling in favours, but Victor did owe him, and could do the job with much more efficiency than he could do it himself.
“I’m sure Irene can come up with something that might pass for a plot. The writing though.” Sherlock gave a shudder. “Well, the writing was never the show’s strong point. I’m not sure why I expected the concept to grow up, just because we all did. But it’s going to be idiotic if we all read lines sounding like they were written by a fifteen year old.”
This cold crept on me like that. Tendrils of vapour swirled around my legs, reaching around me like a vine, the hairs on my body rising up as it encircled me. I had not had time to notice the details of the room before the door was shut, but remembered a fireplace and a bed. I might have gone to the window and pulled aside the curtains to let some light in, but with the cold came a kind of paralysis. My heart pounded and my blood ran cold; I stood in the dark, hearing my ragged breaths, feeling the unknown
The young man readily agreed. I poured us each a glass of port and offered him a cigar.
His peace already ruined, he gives in. Life and death mean something, though less to him than to most people. He sinks into his chair, dressing gown wrapped around, girding himself for whatever tale of woe will follow. “Send him up.”
Recording his own reflection had been harder for Sherlock than he expected. He had been asked to talk about the friendship of Alex and Jason.
“You see? That’s what potential flatmates are asking themselves.
“No. I ran into Mike Stamford completely by accident that day. Russell Square wasn’t a place I even expected to be, so it wasn’t as if he’d laid a trap for me. Even if Sherlock had singled me out with the specific purpose of impressing me into being his flatmate— why? He didn’t know me, and Mike wasn’t aware I’d been in Afghanistan, or that I was in town. It was just by chance that we met; Sherlock certainly wasn’t thinking that two years later he would be throwing himself off the roof of Barts, confessing a huge hoax to me.”
“Holmes,” he said. “Do you understand why the kingdom of God will be closed to you?”
He groaned.
“In part. But the things that can be gleaned with the eye aren’t the most important things.”
man,” I said, exploring the possible innuendos. “
The affair, which (as he discovered) hadn’t ended, was what sent John out the door. Anything was better than accepting her infidelity. He’d been faithful to her while he was overseas, even in the face of temptation. He returned to a wife who resented him and a daughter who had grown into an adolescent without him.
He tries to make his mouth work. “Guess so.”
“Indeed. It is curious.”
Nor has he said
John nodded at the tall figure, who was hurrying down the path. “Good morning!”
He’s thinking about his pub night, Murray blathering endlessly about his amazing baby who could eat and sleep and poop. It’s an unkind thought. Of course he’s happy for him. He should send a baby gift. It will have to be something gender-neutral, though, since he still doesn’t know whether Marley is a boy or a girl. He’s leaning towards it being a girl, but it probably isn’t a good idea to go out and buy pink baby suits or hats or whatever it is that babies wear. Maybe green.
His brother sniffs. “There are exceptions to every rule, brother. Right now, however, I’m thinking not of parties, but of lunch.” He graces Lestrade with a rare, genuine smile. “Perhaps, if you have time, Mr Lestrade, you’d join me?”
“Of course I don’t. They’re just regular kids. My mum is tripping.”
“You know how they never leave notes? This one did. Will you come?”
“Well, I’m glad you’re all right. Does he think this guy is targeting gay men?”
“Sherlock—“
. Trapped in a lift. Time for confessions, because that’s what people do.
“But you might want someone else to warm your bed. A younger man, one who can recite poetry to you and discuss music and math and philosophy and—”
I leaned forward, rubbing my hands together. “State your case.”
As we climbed into the hansom, I asked, “Did you see her, Watson?”
“I’m fine.” His face does feel hot. “It’s too warm in here.” He fiddles with the focus knob.
Greg grinned. “Great to see you again, Mary.”
Instead of taking a seat, she walks around the sitting room, examining everything while he fills the kettle and takes mugs down from the cupboard. He watches as she picks up the skull and smiles at it. “Who’s this?”
“He talked to you, though.”
“A cup of…” The handsome barista frowned, his cupid’s bow mouth creating a charming moue. “Starts with T… let me see.” He looked up at the menu board.
“Good morning.” John is standing at the kitchen door, scratching his belly and ruffling a hand through his hair. He looks sleep-tousled, sated, beautiful. He leans down, kisses Sherlock lightly on the lips, and flicks on the kettle. “Anything on today?”
And he found another
“I think it’s time to call your mother,” I said, scrolling through the contacts. “Ah, here’s someone called
“So I’m right, he’s just trying it out.”
“Well,” said John. “Shower?”
— his little girl, whom he barely knows anymore.
Watson made himself scarce, promising to work his way around the house to the window where he must wait. I staggered into the street, feigning injury— not a difficult pretence at that point— reminding myself never to provoke Watson’s temper.
“Obviously.”
is playing low, and the piña colada pitcher is empty.
“Sure. We also have nosy mothers who tell us what to do. And Ariel said that you and John are the GOAT.”
“Nevertheless. You’re a reckless man, John Watson. A man who lives on the edge. You only pretend to be shy and retiring, but now I’ve seen the inner guitar hero lurking beneath that innocuous facade.”
One quick glance behind me to see that Watson was on my heels, and I pulled out all the stops, ran hell for leather towards the boundary fence.
“Zion? Who is that?”
By now he has realised that few people are worthy of the love he’s been saving for a hypothetical person. It doesn’t matter. He is married to his Work— solving crimes, removing dangerous people from society, making the world a safer, more just place.
Vampire Sherlock; werewolf John
As they said their vows, both of them tearing up, John realised that his own tears were real. He was so happy to be marrying Sherlock. And then he was sad because it wasn’t real; Sherlock would no doubt have divorce papers waiting for them to sign when they returned from the sex holiday. This made him cry so hard that he could barely say the vows he had written. Sherlock’s vows were beautiful, of course; he’d written them in the form of a sonnet.
“We don’t have a murderer.” Gregson sighed wearily. “A man shot dead right in his own home— we have to arrest someone!”
Holmes sits down next to the body as the blood begins to coagulate. He listens for sirens, running footsteps; no one is coming to see what’s happened.
“You must hit me.” I gestured at my chin. “Strike me where it will make a mark.”
“Yes, I do like your father. Very much. He is a singular person, though.”
And then, as my eyes strained to see him, he was there, dressed in an old jacket and a slouch hat. He’d grown a beard, and his hair was longer than I’d ever seen it. Over one shoulder he carried a traveling bag. A cane in his other hand, he walked with a limp, worse than when we first met. Thin as a lath and brown as a nut, his hair sun-bleached. After so many years of imagining him, here he was, wounded but alive.
, the writers had told him, in contrast with Lestrade’s character, a classic extrovert. They assumed that introverts could not also be arseholes. When he gave his role that edge, as well as a kind of genuine bewilderment that everyone didn’t see things as he did, his audience was enthralled. With Sherlock’s snarky but clueless Baz playing off Lestrade’s genial but grouchy Hawke, the show went to the top of the charts right away.
Watson was sitting at the little desk, pretending to look at his notes. “Holmes.”
When he returns to the flat that evening, Sherlock has made dinner for him. It’s a huge relief, a confirmation that he was right not to press him to talk. Without a word, they embrace. Holding on, they sway, rocking to comfort each other.
But I was not a normal person. As long as I had his bones, John would stay with me. I told myself it was for research purposes, having a ghost to observe close at hand, but it was really because I had missed him. He represented the happiest moments of my childhood. Placing a heavy lock on the box, I slid it under my bed, warning my landlady not to touch it. Had she known what was inside, she would have thrown me into the street.
“You’re bringing me home?”
“You’ll need to come dressed for the theme,” says Matt. “You’ve got two weeks to grow a moustache, find a costume. Christopher and I are going to be Sonny and Cher.” He rolls his eyes. “Obviously, he’s Cher. I argued, but he’s taller.”
“For Alex to predict Mr Smith’s surprise… well, it sort of takes the air out of the scene.” He glanced at Lestrade. “Just a bit. I think I should just walk in and wait until Mr Smith notices me. His reaction will say it all.”
“That our client cannot afford what he is asking.”
This realisation sank like a stone in my gut. Yes, I was the idiot.
he loves Sherlock, but maybe he is still in love with… what’s her name? John hasn’t even said her name once.
I smiled. “My dear hero, always ready to rush into danger. Let me catch my breath and think a bit.”
“Do you want it to be?”
“Sit, Watson. We have two hours before he will disturb our peace. I intend to enjoy my breakfast in quiet.”
“Holmes!” Watson hissed. “Let’s go!” He tossed the last packets in the fire, grabbed my revolver and tucked it in my coat pocket.
“I don’t mind disaster,” said Lestrade. “Occasionally it provides a career boost. Just don’t go off the script, mate, no matter how idiotic it is. I’m pretty sure if you do, nobody will follow you. Right now, this is all about sticking together as a team. We’ve all got some stake in this going well.”
“My real name is Rosamund,” Elsa said. “I hate it.”
He sat up and turned on the light.
He laughed. “What have I done now?”
“You expect people to love you,” he replied. “I never do, and am therefore rarely disappointed.”
And before John can ask about the hair, Sherlock is off, running down the stairs, calling, “Pink!” as he goes.
? We’ve been given a great gift, this endless life. Why must you spend it pursuing Death?”
“Why are you stalking me?”
“Sorry. Where was I?”
“And why are you telling me this?” He suspected it was because she liked the feeling of knowing something he didn’t know and holding it over him.
It was the last thing he needed to be thinking about right now. When he was twelve, it was a big break for him, an awkward, odd-looking, skinny boy with frizzy hair and alien cheekbones. His brother Mycroft had insisted that he go to auditions.
“Worth it for you, perhaps. The point is, why should
“I hope you don’t mind,” he said. “I got hungry, and assumed you’d be up soon.”
“I have not the talent. My parents tried, but when it became clear that it was a waste of time and money, they gave it up.” She gave him a conspiratorial grin. “I’m sure my brothers all rejoiced when they no longer had to hear me scraping the violin. It made everyone think of cats being tortured.” She nodded at me. “You play divinely, Mr Holmes. If only Mr Watson had learned, you might play duets.”
I won’t call Stamford. There’s one pill left in the bottle, and I will hold on to it. I might need to see Sherlock one more time, imagine him alive. What that means is something I can’t think about. I won’t think about it. I’ll keep the pill, but I won’t take it. If I did, he would really be gone, the dreams over. I can’t think about that.
“But where is he?” I asked, looking around the flat.
“Do you really think you were the only one without friends?” Holmes is looking at him now, not sardonically, not judgmentally. He’s giving Watson an opening, if he can ask the right question, say the right thing.
Sherlock Holmes
I don’t correct her. “I’m sorry, Molly.” I select a carton of milk and put it in my basket. “I’m sorry.” I turn and walk away.
“Mrs Hudson, please understand. I was
He considered the man before him. John truly hadn’t grown an inch since Sherlock last saw him, but he’d filled out a bit. The face had lost its youthful roundness, the jaw squarer now. The eyes were the same, though, a dark blue that almost looked brown from a few steps away. Those eyes were looking at him with anger, confusion, and something else.
“So, you don’t want Philip.”
When he’d told her what he needed, she’d said,
“You’ve done me!” Milverton cried and began to cough violently.
“Six, I think.” Sherlock had watched that movie more times than he could count. It was a remake of Chaplin’s 1921
“Ten years,” she said. “Four years later, I read an advertisement in the Times, asking for my address, and on the advice of Mrs Forrester, I responded. That same day I received a large pearl; a similar pearl has been sent to me each year since then.” She opened a small box, revealing six fine, lustrous pearls of great size. “Today I received a letter asking me to meet the sender at the Lyceum Theatre tonight.”
“Never. I think it’s fairly obvious that I’m not straight, or at least not trying to appeal to men.”
people don’t forget. You’d better be living like a monk if you want people to think you’ve changed.”
“What is it this time? Thumbs? Kidneys?”
She has seen his broken body, observed his regeneration. As a scientist, she must admit this evidence. “There are people who would like to study you.”
Watson sighed. “As diverting as that game was, I’m not sure I can take more of it yet. Give me a few days.”
Maybe John misses having sex with women.
“Why would they do that?” She took another pastry, this time a cheese danish. “It’s as if they can’t imagine a successful woman being fulfilled without a child.”
“And you’ve deduced… what? That he’s going to counselling with his wife?”
“I’ve quit. Mostly. How do you feel about the violin?”
Sherlock lies on the bed, looking up at the ceiling, waiting for John’s footsteps, his key in the lock. All of his things are here. Of course he’ll be back.
He looks around at the crowd. A mixed group of people. One table looks like an office gathering, men and women in business attire. A few are regulars, he can tell.
It isn’t any trouble, really. A moment of exasperation that his lover, who has no doubt spent the day stretched out on the sofa doing nothing observably productive, couldn’t be arsed to walk over two streets himself, is soon replaced by a sense of contentment that he can do something useful for Sherlock.
I gave her my best smile, the one I always use when convincing a woman to share information with me. She was no Irene Adler, but she would do. She was intelligent enough not to challenge my proclivities, once she figured them out, and, after producing the desired heir, would no doubt leave me to my cases, my experiments, and my Watson.
Elsa didn’t look up from her phone. “Can you tell my mum to stop calling me Rosamund? She said I could be Rose, but I don’t like that name either.”
His sister might have been involved as well. If John did fake his death, it’s most likely that he would have confided in someone. His sister Harriet, with no ties in the world of acting, might be that person. Arguing against this was the fact that they had never gotten along. But blood often turned out to be thicker than imagined. If John needed her, she might have helped him, especially since, as his only living relative, she was likely the beneficiary of his insurance and the legatee of his will. That would be another thing to check, whether he had made a will. If he had, it would be public record now.
“Watson!” Someone is shaking him, roughly. “Open your eyes.”
I didn’t last long.
His eyes twinkled. “Perhaps I’ll write it up one day.”
“Well, I mean. Yeah, she’s a woman. I always dated women. Before. At uni.”
With a start, I sit up. I’m in Sherlock’s room and have just taken a nap on the bed. I have no recollection of lying down.
, I thought, but I didn’t want to miss the conversation.
He held it back. “Before you ask, I have already made my decision.”
“You were rather enthusiastic tonight, my love,” he said. “I like it when you want me like that.”
“Mr Holmes, even family are being asked to leave now. The ward closes to visitors—
There is something he needed to know. Something about… something. “Why?”
John took to following me, even when I left the flat for an investigation. I could always feel his cold presence at my shoulder. Rather than being unpleasant, he had become so familiar to me that I would miss him if he did not hover nearby. I talked to him when I was alone, going over details of the cases I solved. Lestrade might have heard me talking to myself once or twice, but my words were always meant for John.
The audience was holding its collective breath.
“He ruined John’s career! He may as well have killed him.”
He sighed, settling into his pillow. “John, I must be honest with you. I recently learned something that disturbs me greatly, and though I don’t wish to upset you, I think you should know.”
instead comes out, “I’m marrying her.”
“This is Doctor Watson.” He chivvies Watson towards the door. “My landlady, Mrs Hudson.”
Edwin stepped forward, glaring at me. “He was reading a book.” He said this as if he were accusing me of a crime.
Mycroft sends over some food. He tells me not to worry about the rent. He must be sad, losing his brother like that after spending so much effort trying to keep him alive and out of trouble. They didn’t get along well, but he must have loved Sherlock. I wonder why he didn’t cry at the funeral. But I don’t suppose Mycroft ever cries.
He didn’t know any normal people. They were his friends, and that meant something.
As soon as Angelo was gone, Irene levelled her ice-blue eyes at him. “Tell me about John.”
It’s too much to take in. “You’re—“
His form hovered near me.
(See the end of the chapter for
Once out of bed, he knew he would not sleep again. Sweaty from his panic, he took a shower and put on a clean dressing gown. Too antsy to read, he took up his violin and played. When he saw light coming in from under the shades, he dressed for rehearsal.
“But she will expect it. When, Watson? When will you ask her?”
“Yeah. Rosamund. He hates it.” He smiles. “I call her Rosebug. She hates that, too.” He wipes his eyes with the side of his hand. “I’ve been a shite father, really. Never there for her—“
“Jesus,” she repeats.
John laughed. “Nope. Too many paps lurking. In your refrigerator I found mustard packets, the hot kind that Chinese restaurants give you, soy sauce, a pack of cigarettes, and a very cloudy jar of olives. I disposed of the cigarettes because I think it’s unpleasant kissing a smoker and I intend to kiss you— a lot. Fortunately, some bloke came to the door. Didn’t even ring the bell downstairs so I guess he had a key. Handed me a box of food,
Maybe it’s better, a part of him suggests. If they’d carried on pretending, eventually Sherlock would have lost interest. He’d forget John. Better to leave now, with some of his dignity still intact.
And yet, a part of me didn’t believe it. When I took a napkin and wiped my penciled moustache off, I wanted to lean over and wipe his upper lip too, just to make him look like my John again.
“Well, more or less. We might have studied chemistry. And we might have… done some other things. Hormones are just chemicals, you know.”

The foot traffic flows around us, parting to leave us in an island of stillness.
“He might have some problems with short-term memory,” she says. “Usually people with a moderate injury like this won’t remember the accident or what led up to it. That’s normal. Watch for behavioural changes—“
As she begins to close her locker, the mirror inside catches the reflection of a figure standing at the door. A quick intake of breath, and then she starts to smile. “Welcome back.”
Other people saw what I saw. I remember there were people crowding around, trying to pull me away. Maybe not all of them were so traumatised by the sight.
Now she’s surprised. “Moving out? Did he say why?”
The boy looks at him impassively.
“Can’t afford London on an army pension,” he says.
As he explained how he found the hidden compartment where the missing document was concealed, John’s irritation disappeared; he was amazed.
There’s something he should say, something any other adult would know to say to a fourteen year old who hates her life. Something about parents and responsibility and giving things time.
John let out a breath. “Yeah.”
He shakes his head. “It’s one thing when adults kill, but children? Maybe they didn’t push him physically, but it was their taunts that drove him to fall. It’s their fault he’s dead. If we simply accept it as boys being boys, or people being horrible— well, that’s not acceptable. The law will step in now and they’ll be punished, I suppose, but there must be a way to fix such people. Or at least encourage them to be better.”
“I have much to confess to you, as well.” Tearfully, he laughed. “We are a couple of rogues, aren’t we?”
But he won’t see John again. He saw the look on his face. No love there; John hates him. He’ll wait until Sherlock is out of the flat, come in and empty all his drawers, take his books from the bookcase, clear out his desk. He’ll leave his key on the kitchen table, close the door, walk down seventeen steps, and leave, never to return.
profit me,” I replied. “If I negotiate with Milverton, it will only teach other blackmailers to ask an unreasonably high price, and victims that they only need run to me for help. I will become the broker of all such transactions and waste my talent saving the reputations of foolish people.”
Maybe that pang of regret was just a natural reaction to change.
“Can’t say.”

“He could have stayed at Baker Street. Mycroft was paying the rent and—“
We awoke late the next day, having partaken of cheap champagne the couple could not afford and too many choruses of “My Heart’s Desire.” I could hear Mrs Hudson stirring downstairs.
“You think he’ll lie?”
“I suppose John would have gone along with Molly’s plan. That’s why I agreed, even though it’s fucking mad having someone play his part, especially a wanker like Brook. John would have wanted to do it, though. That’s what I keep thinking, that he would have enjoyed it. It might have been fun.”
No one noticed that he was crying.
, not because he was afraid of the fallout if he refused, but because Molly and Mike and Greg, and even Phil and Sally, were the closest thing to friends that he’d ever had. They understood his life without asking, without him needing to say a word.
John put his arm around Sherlock. “Remember how you cried when I left?”
“Harriet.”
“Declined?”
He stops himself, a realisation dawning on him. He’s always thought of Harry as the difficult one, the one with all the problems, the one who throws strops and complains about everything. But she’s not— it’s him. He’s the difficult one.
Mycroft had given him no choice:
Sherlock nodded. “The same for me.”
“I know where he is,” Charles was saying. “There, in the window-seat is where he hides, the coward.”
“Oh, that part was true,” Holmes returned. “I went to seminary before I studied chemistry at Cambridge.”
Surprisingly, Sherlock makes tea, which must mean that this is an occasion, in spite of the lack of biscuits. John has never seen him voluntarily boil water. They sit in the two chairs, Sherlock in his large, angular chair, and John in the squashy red one—
“Well… I’ll be back in a bit,” he says. “Text me if you need anything.”
“Molly is the least observant person I know.” Remembering what she revealed on her recent visit, he might reconsider this assessment. Perhaps Brook was just another sad charity case she’d adopted. “She dates psychopaths on a regular basis.”
“I love you,” I gasp. “I love you, John.”
didn’t seem right.
“Because you like him. And I’m pretty sure he likes you, too. Just ask him. Meet him for lunch. Everybody eats, right?”
“But will you come?” she asked Watson with a small worried pout. “Would you be so kind?”
Greg huffs an exasperated sigh. “Since he’s never been with a man before, he’s unsure of how to be with you. He’s
Before he can answer, Moriarty puts the gun in his mouth and pulls the trigger. The force of the shot drops him to the roof. Blood begins to pool underneath his head.
“Maybe we can play the entire thing as ironic,” suggested Sherlock.
“Talk later,” John mouthed.
“Why?”
Constable Brown came to the door, panting. “Footprints,” he gasped. “By the fence.”
“Sherlock, I’m not fragile, and I’m not a child. I’ve come to terms with it. That’s partly why I came back, because I’m not willing to let that bastard dictate the rest of my life. Back then, he told me he owned me. Well, he doesn’t anymore.”
“I don’t doubt it. But, as you say, without pictures—“
Twice now, these vivid dreams. Ella would have some thoughts about that, though I’m sure she wouldn’t tell me what she really thinks. She’d say that I dream because I’m not ready to let him go, because there’s something I need to say to him. That’s something she’s said before. I left therapy because I thought it must be disappointing for her to have a patient like me, who doesn’t talk.
“That’s… brilliant,” he says, smiling to himself.
mind,” he says softly. “That night you went out to meet Lestrade? He said there was no case. Why did you lie to me?”
“What? Seriously?”
The monk was opposed to the idea of killing; he told Holmes that he must continue on, never stop seeking enlightenment.
Sherlock loves John. Maybe John cares about Sherlock (as a friend;
“No, it’s not. You may think you don’t need to ask questions because you’re good at deducing people. But John isn’t a witness or a suspect. If you respect him, stop making assumptions and talk to him. Ask him what it means, tell him what you’re worried about. He loves you, Sherlock, but he can’t read your mind.”
She watches through the window as he heads down the street, looking for a cab.
Sherlock asks for a moment, and the waiter promises to return and answer any questions they have. John doesn’t usually dine in restaurants where the menu would prompt questions or discussions of appropriate wines. He knows red wine or white wine, sweet or dry, and that’s the extent of it. He decides that if there’s a special on the menu tonight, he’ll have that, whatever it is, and take whatever wine the waiter suggests.
“Yes. I changed the sheets yesterday and made it up. She won’t let me tidy the room, but I always put clean sheets on the bed. They were still tucked. She hadn’t pulled the bedding open.”
John takes a cab; usually he doesn’t like paying for one, but he’s suddenly very anxious to see Sherlock.
“I’m delirious. I think my husband just said we’re not actually married. Since I know that we are, since I saw the marriage license with my own eyes, I must be delirious. Now kiss me again.”
she’d told him.
The entire story reeked of confabulation, a false trail leading to a fake story. Could John have pulled this off by himself?
, he said.
“I wanted it for him. He expects it. He must think I’m not really gay if I can’t—“
“That was a war,” he says. “This was just a bar.”
Mike and Molly were just being kind. It wasn’t Sherlock who needed a date. They could see how pathetic John is, and were trying to fix him up. Sherlock was only doing it as a favour to them. He could clearly have any man he wanted. Why would he choose a pathetic, boring, damaged army doctor?
Watson would see something in her.
“I mean, if you’ve still got it.”
“My heart?” He glances at Watson. “I’ve been reliably informed that I don’t have one.”
At six o’clock, Mrs Hudson brought up a letter for me. I’d spent the afternoon watching Watson organising my files, which was about as stimulating as watching paint dry. Actually less stimulating, as drying paint yields some data worth retaining. Watson in the throes of organisation was frustrating to watch, as he kept humming to himself and backtracking, removing and reordering the same files. Every now and then he would raise his head and ask a question, the answer to which was inevitably obvious, at least to me.
“Something like that.” Holmes smiles sheepishly. “You hating me sort of puts a damper on things. Though I did say I was sorry. I’ve been reliably informed that’s what you’re supposed to do.”
? I’m not even wearing my coat. Or collar. What
I sneered. “You have a theory about that, no doubt.”
Lestrade opens his phone, touches the screen a couple times, and nods at Sherlock.
In the morning I wake up in Sherlock’s room, in his bed. Alone.
the Sea of Trees, best known as the site of many suicides. He’d read about it when he was in his early teens. A very dense forest, grown out of igneous rock, it was said to be haunted. The eerie silence, due to the closeness of the trees and the sound-absorbing qualities of the hardened lava, was reportedly unnerving, and no doubt the origin of the folk-belief that ghosts lived there.
It was indeed a picture of John Watson, looking doctor-sexy in his scrubs. It was from the website of the surgery where he did locum work.
There was no answer to any of that— no answers that he wanted to hear, anyway. Nothing I said was right. I had many reasons for what I did, and at the time those were enough for me. At the time, I didn’t know he would grieve so, didn’t realise that when he begged me
“Gavin’s attracted to women that aren’t very good for him,” Lestrade said. “I think from the beginning it was the plan that he would have a lot of failed relationships. He’s too focused on his work to be a good husband and father, too jaded by so much of what he’s seen. I would say he’s finally realised that about himself, when his last relationship ended. But he won’t say no to the next one.”
“All of it. Some scenes were filmed with the set closed. Maybe everyone was filmed in costume, but in the rotoscoped version, they’re not. It’s obviously animation, but the most amazing blend I’ve ever seen. Ethereal, surreal one moment, teasing the viewer with a glimpse of reality, but then morphing into pure fantasy. Might have gotten an Oscar for cinematography or something if it hadn’t been so very explicit.”
Lestrade gives him a kind smile. “You’re an idiot. I’m only telling you because of John. I slipped and mentioned that you hadn’t had a case from me, and that upset him because you’d told him that you were out with me, working. Why would you say that?”
“Your lot will not be much better now that you’re back,” I said. “I’ve been working cases, but not much is coming into our account. I’m not worried, though; we’ve been penniless before. I have no doubt that our luck will improve, now that you’re back.”
He closes his eyes for a moment, gathering his thoughts, discarding unproductive worries. He’s Captain Watson now, his nerves steady. But there’s no focus for all this energy, and it’s his
“This is not you, Watson, however tidy it may be. It's joyless. It looks like one of those dystopian films where everyone lives in cells and gets their meals through a little slot in the wall, like letters. Cameras everywhere. Sirens go off and everyone takes shelter, waiting for Big Brother to address them.”
Sam gives him a hug as well. “Are you all right?”
Lestrade drained his beer in one draught, signalled the waitress for another. “I take offence at that, on behalf of fifteen year olds everywhere. My daughter is fourteen, and she could have written a better script.” He gave Sherlock a guilty look. “Don’t tell Molly I said that.”
Harry has taped them shut so he could simply take them away without having to see what’s in them. He doesn’t even remember what he packed up or why he chose to save what he did. School stuff, he supposes. What else was there?
“Mr Holmes, until we determine whether you are a suspect—“
It’s not like all the times before. He’s always waited for Watson, he realises, because Watson always comes back. The longest he ever waited was hundred and twenty-three years.
Anderson nodded. “One of the runners. I can’t tell you his name because he’s got a job he doesn’t want to lose, but we went to school together. I believe him. He said that Magnussen has a thing for young boys, and he was always meeting with John in his office, alone, door closed,
“I think you’re one of the Doobie Brothers,” Sam says.
“What?” Mr Windibank’s smugness vanished. “Where is he?”
the two of them falling in step— the cases, the chases, the evenings together, the nights of passion, the silences, the violin.
I nodded. “And a satellite of Uranus.”
“No. It doesn’t begin with T, it
John’s laugh at the gym, responding to flirtation. The questions he wouldn’t answer, the obvious lies.
“I’ll put a plaster on it first.”
“There’s a syringe over there somewhere, full of cocaine,” he pants. “Evidence. And he had a bag with, erm, duct tape. A knife, I think.”
He makes himself a cup of tea in Harry’s kitchen. It’s very neat, no dishes in the sink, no rotting food in the fridge. The small table is wiped clean, no clutter of unpaid bills or unwashed dishes.
“Last night we were sitting in a expensive restaurant attempting awkward conversation. I didn’t think I’d ever see you again.”
“Where is Watson?”
“The only reason they’re even offering money is because we haven’t had a raise in two years. The third season did much better than expected, they have no promising replacement series waiting in the wings— and both Greg and I are actively looking for other roles. They know we could both do much better in films. But
I raised my head. “No, it’s about
He’ll be home soon, and I wonder how that first meeting will go. Will he still have dyed hair and clothing I don’t recognise? Maybe he’ll try to surprise me, wearing a disguise I haven’t seen. Maybe he’ll be too hurt, still in a hospital bed, and I’ll come to his side. Whatever happens, I will be waiting for him.
He splashes his face with water, uses a paper towel to wipe away the shine. It’s not much of an improvement. Closing his eyes, he imagines for a moment that he and Sherlock hit if off, and there’s another date, that they begin
to use another term— in fact, what we generally call coincidences lack any causal connection.”
He reached over and pulled me by my ear, raising me to my feet. “What do you mean, you wicked boy?”
, he thought.
How had it gone so wrong, so quickly? John’s face at the restaurant, introducing him as
She blows on her tea, looking at him curiously now. “Why?”
Watson rotated his weak shoulder to loosen it up. “Perhaps next time you should steal the key. You’ve spent days sweet-talking the housemaid. I’m sure you could have lifted the key while she was plying you with cake.”
“How is that my fault?”
“Emergency Medicine.” He smiles. “My father thinks I ought to become an orthopaedic surgeon. He says in another twenty years everyone will have a knee or hip replacement. Solid income, no shortage of patients.”
Sherlock understood about overly-protective siblings. “Clara arranged your disappearance
This gave me an opening to leave the room. Watson rose and said he might like to see the house where I’d grown up, but my mother gave him a stern look and asked what sort of music he enjoyed. Fortunately I’d schooled him in the classical composers and as I left the room, he was telling her how much he loved Tchaikovsky. She would tell him that Russians were tediously sentimental, and that he should listen only to German composers if he wished to train his ear.
The second box is much like the first, but the contents are older. Books, notebooks, all from the Priory School. Vaguely, he remembers this box following him to uni and then med school, taped shut the whole time. The box itself is sound, but Harry has reinforced the old tape, by now losing its hold on the box. He slits it open.
“I need to know what to do,” he says.
He’s not used to this. He’s never had a John Watson before, a person who seems to fill in all the empty spaces in his life. He wants very much for John to stay, but he’s never had to think about somebody else’s needs and desires. As such, he’s trying to be better, to notice what John is feeling. The man is not a talker. Most of the time, that’s okay because his face gives him away.
“A month?” I looked up at him.
It was in London that I began to spend time among these spiritualists. Science had not solved the problem of death, and spiritualism had filled that space. Though it was not a science, that did not mean that answers were not there; it only meant that I needed to sift through the evidence to find them.
I also understand why Molly avoids me. Sherlock would have needed someone at Barts to help him, to make sure his deception wasn’t discovered. When I saw her that day at Tesco, she was too flustered to talk, and I didn’t realise. She was embarrassed. She didn’t know how it would affect me, and she felt guilty that I was so grief-stricken, that she knew and I didn’t. I could ask her what the plan was— the body, the blood, the people standing around gawking— but I don’t really care how they did it. And I already know why.
