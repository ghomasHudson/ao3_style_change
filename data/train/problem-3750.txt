This day just wasn’t getting any better.  April let a few tears run down her cheeks as she stripped and got up to hang the tunic next to her bag.  She knew her ass was a fiery, blazing red, and now everyone who saw it would know just how much trouble she was in at home.  She added embarrassment to the list of emotions trying to pull her under this morning, and she sniffled miserably.  There was a grimness to the Mating-bond too.  April could tell that Castiel was reading her well enough to know she’d just been spanked and that she was in a defiant mood.
“We thank all of you for coming,” Castiel said.  “Over the last few weeks, Dean or I or both of us have spoken to each of you in person about what we’re doing here today.  I believe everyone understands, but I would like to assure you, if any of you find the events disturbing, please feel free to slip out.  The exits are marked clearly.  For those of you who choose to stay, please be assured that the events that follow are entirely consensual.  Dean?”  Cas turned to his husband.
“There now. That made more sense.” Dean looked around and barely had time to focus on Castiel’s face before he had to scramble for balance at the press of Cas’ kiss.
“The foursome isn’t on hold, I don’t think.  In fact, I wouldn’t put it past Castiel to work that into our exercises in one way or another.”
“Can I bring Michael to the next fitting?” he asked, stepping down and collecting his clothes from April.
Dean looked at Michael.  The Omega raised his palms and his brows and backed away, stepping into the bathroom.
“That’s a big leap, beta. Let’s not get ahead of ourselves. He told you he can touch the zeta waves?” Cas asked, peering into the room. Michael’s face was millimeters from the Ozzie’s. Her eyes were closed. She bore a blissful expression. Her chest heaved, and her nipples were erect. Michael whispered rapidly, his lips almost brushing the curve of her ear.
“I don’t see why it would matter as long as he doesn’t go get himself bonded to any of them before the test.  Let’s see, it’s a standard, full-spread panel.  I’ve got Adam doing the Lead-off leg, Jody’s the Bridge, and um, Rafael is going to be his Anchor.”
“Just because he promises there won’t have to be any sex doesn’t mean there won’t have to be any sex,” Billie snapped, staring at Uriel’s name.
“Very good.  You’re forgiven.  I’m aware that we had a degree of blurriness about the starting point of this scene, but Dean,
“Nnnghh!” was Dean’s response, followed by a roll of his hips and a nip to Cas’ throat that woke his wolf.  Woke them both.
The whole room was useable surface, but Dean’s alpha didn’t give a shit if it was easy or hard to clean.  The Omega was going to be taken, appropriate time and place or not.  He wasn’t aware of Sam and Castiel spreading out near enough to help if Gabriel was distressed but distanced enough to be out of the way.  He wasn’t aware of Michael watching from a much greater distance with his own hand on his cock, stroking slowly.  Dean’s alpha fixated on one thing: there was an open, leaking, presented Omega channel before him, and the alpha meant to own it.
“Five,” Dean muttered to himself with certainty. He kissed the top of April’s head and eased himself out from beneath her, standing to his full stature and making use of his powerful stance. Cain sighed.
Her Heat rising once more, Kate found the harmonic she needed, and she forgot anyone else was in the room. She slobbered and smacked, swallowed around his girth, licked along his length, and all the while, he dredged slick from between her cheeks and pummeled her hole with his long, bulky fingers.
“I’m not going to school. I’ll be training and working from home. I can be there for Michael’s pup, and I’ll be preparing for little ones of my own too.” She stepped a bit further away as she spoke as if she expected an explosive reaction and needed distance. Dean frowned.
“Alpha. I know you can hear me. I trust you, Sir. I…I love you. Please, Sir, I need you now. I need your touch. I think I’m done. Would you unbind me?”
“Well, it looks to me like Benjamin’s wolf is getting a pretty thorough stroking right there,” Dean responded lustily his eyes on the screen which was playing the video in a loop.  “And I’d like to point out that Benjamin is not the one pressing charges.  His Omega status makes him a juvenile in the eyes of the law, giving the state the right to act on his behalf.  The same state that expects him to behave like an adult, classifies him as a child so they can step in where they aren’t needed.”  Dean switched effortlessly into activist mode, his disgust at the way the system’s double standard hit Omegas from two directions driving him to lean in and drive the point home.
What followed was fairly routine, despite the grandiose opening. The contractors operated under the Behavioral Department – Benny’s domain, so Benny handled most of the proceedings. Benny played video excerpts from Max’s final exam scenes, discussing strengths and weaknesses, pointing out where bad habits lingered and where a fine instinct led him well. Benny noted with a wry tone how Max’s striking green eyes kept track of the camera as it moved and seduced the lens as fervently as he did his scene partner. The panel chuckled in light amusement. The kid was cocky, flirtatious, and impertinent as he worked, but he had a commitment to his scenes that worked well, despite his cheek.
Nick talked the plan through with Castiel and the entire team. The single would be ready for release in time for Tony Award nominations, paired with a B-side that could stand as an anthem of its own. Releasing the show’s anthem as a single would serve as publicity for the stage performance, drawing in crowds from far and wide. The fact that it was the composer’s voice on the single highlighted her in a way that her name on the playbill wouldn’t do alone. Nick was positive that by this time next year, she would be a household name, and Cain agreed.
Dean's being punished, sort of.  This is a punishment?  More like an endurance test.  It's all about the headgames though, more than the physical stuff.  Also, April's being punished, and this one isn't vague at all.  And in the morning, what's Sarah been up to, and will she be next in line for the strap?
Cas grimaced for a second but reined himself swiftly in.  “That man,” he added.  “Sometimes I don’t know whether to clap him on the back or wring his neck.  Don’t trust him for a second, Darius.  Everything you know of brats, multiply that by twenty where Nicholas is concerned.”
Also, the brave and wonderful Melodina (I don't know how to link to her name) has built us a Keller chart to reference.  Link here:  http://pre14.deviantart.net/47ae/th/pre/f/2017/170/a/4/keller_score_graph_by_melodinaa-dbd96rl.jpg
“Jesus, man, you’re a bigger mess than I am!  What happened to all your moral integrity?  What happened to the Alpha I know?  Have you really changed that much?”
There was a pause.  Then, “Sam.  Yes, I’ll wait.  I’ve got hold of the wolf now.  I need some water.  Please.  Sam, please be careful.  Don’t hurt her.  I…I can wait.  I can weather this.  I’ve waited this long to find my mate, I… can hold him for a while longer.  Just, please Sam.  Don’t hurt her…”  Cas’ voice faded away with a whoomph that sounded like his legs had given way.  Sam could picture him sitting against the wall below the intercom.  A rush of sympathy filled him.  The melodrama was quite unlike the great Alpha.  He had to be significantly outside of himself to sound like a teenaged drama queen.
Dean shrugged.  “’Bout some things, yeah.  When and where and how we fuck, not so much.  You’re actually way more predictable than you think you are.”
Cas took several moments to pause and watch the commuters fill the Beltway with congestion that bespoke public civil productivity.  “How bad is it?” he asked Dean.
Castiel thanked the audience for trusting their Ozzies to The Facility and promised them their trust was well placed. A few more words, a swell of piped music, a last round of applause, and the beaming row of Omega-Submissives filed off the stage.
Behind them, Tony came in through the staff entrance with fabric shopping bags hanging from both arms. April rose to help him with his bundles and pour him a cup of coffee. Alex thunked his cup down onto the table and squirmed out of his daddy’s lap. He followed April hoping to be allowed to help unpack the bags and stock the kitchen with the day’s goodies. Michael used the opportunity to arrange himself further into Dean’s space, snuggling closer with his back to Dean’s chest and forcing his mate to put an arm around him. Dean cinched him in.
“Aaaaagh!”  Dean shoved in hard and bottomed out all in one harsh push.  Castiel screamed, and clutched at him.  “Open up for me!  Alpha, open up!  Let me in!”  Dean panted hard into Castiel’s collarbone.  He was too close to the wolf’s jaw, to its teeth.  The wolf went wild on his leash, snarling and thrashing.  It’s muscles bunched and spasmed against the leash holding it back.  Dean felt it through Castiel’s body, and he lifted his head slowly to look straight into the beast’s bottomless eyes.
“Stop fidgeting, Michael!”  Dean slapped his hand down gently, and Michael snapped at him – literally snapped his teeth in an attempt to bite his mate.  Dean’s eyes hardened fast.  “That’s one, man.  If we get to three, you’re kissin’ tile.  Keep your temper.”
April headed quickly down the length of the hall, rounding a corner and glancing at postings and directional signs. Coming upon another stairway, she spotted a sign pointing downward that read,
Cas smiled a downright evil smile at his mate, and her pout disappeared.  She strutted just a little as she approached him.  He quirked a brow in her direction.  A dare.
Bobby refused to let Gabe bathe, wanting the hormones he was smearing all over the Omega’s skin a chance to really settle in. He let Cas wipe him down with a damp cloth, but that was all, and Gabriel reeked.
Cas nodded, and they went into their own thoughts once more. Castiel saved his work and closed out of his computer. It felt like a good time to bring up all their business. Dean sat open and amenable. “Dean, I want you and Michael to resolve your issues. I’ve been patient, but it needs to end.” Cas as pained lover desperate for a family had little in common with Cas, the Alpha Director of Pack Winchester.
“Hey, Sammy. It’s good to hear your voice. Uh, yeah. Sorry I didn’t call on Friday, and uh, happy belated birthday, man. Things got kinda busy here.”
“They will be!” Jenn assured him, hollering over the noise. She squinted through the haze at the seat of a chair that looked to have been pulled out of a landfill. “Have a seat. They’ll come to us.”
“We’re his Pack,” the woman broke in. “The boy has no parents. Our Pack took him in. He was found walking the streets a couple of years ago, completely on his own. He’s always been jumpy, on-edge. Hell of a temper. But then he started acting really strange.”
“I just want him to like me, Dean. That’s all. I swear. Two Omegas living in the same house. It’ll be miserable if he doesn’t thaw out about how much he hates me.”
“Okay, thanks. I appreciate the offer. I need to get some, um, processing time on this. Damn, you two don’t do half measures, do you? Go big or go home, right, Dean?”
Dean flowed upward to his feet, and he turned the alarm off.  He took a deep breath at the door, turned his office light out, and slipped naked into the hallway.
“YES, SIR!  I touched myself in the kitchen before breakfast the day after you said not to!  That’s the only time!  I SWEAR!”  (Jesus, stop THINKING!  You’re gonna get us both punished!), his wolf shot at him.  (Let me handle it, you moron.)
“You really didn’t know she had a hand on the rudder?  Come on, bro!  I thought you were just letting her test her little fledgling wings.  Dude, she wasn’t even all that clever about hiding it!  Cas, come on!”
“Yeah.  I owe you that.  Weird feeling here, Michael.  It feels like all this time we were all working around each other under a heavy drape, and now it’s been pulled off, and we’re caught red-handed.  It’s time to come clean, man.  And I’m not innocent.  I just hope it helps to know that everything I pushed for was to end with all of us happy.  That’s all I want.  I want everybody happy.”
“And I’m supposed to be having a traumatic heart-to-heart, but I’m too weak. He’s just so…pretty.” Cas thought for a moment that he’d drooled down his shirt, but a quick check showed he was mistaken.
“If you don’t mind, I’ll skip out on this one, Dean.”  Cas reached for the platter of fruit and began to put April’s breakfast plate together.  “I have a huge backlog at the office already.  I could use a quiet evening at my desk to catch up.  Would you mind keeping April with you?  Watch over her, please.”
Michael growled and bit down on Dean’s shoulder, making Dean scream out in a high pitched squeal.  “I DIDN’T,
“You really think your Alpha can handle another man fucking your mate?” Dean tried one last time, going for blunt.  “Your wolf?”
He stroked one finger slowly down the crack of Castiel’s ass, letting it glide seamlessly over the dark, puckered skin of his hole, moving down his perineum to his scrotum, bringing all of his fingers up to massage his balls.  Slowly, he gripped them, pulling them tight.  Cas’ legs tensed up, but he didn’t break position or protest.  He was fighting hard to trust.  Dean wouldn’t harm him.  Dean would see him through this and hold him safe to the end.
April could smell his arousal, and she stretched out within her bond, beseeching him to slake himself in her, beating against the wall between them. He needed her, but he was so far away. And she couldn’t reach him.
Charlie turned to him and set her fists on her hips. “Michael, I love you, but you’re a moron sometimes. That’s all I’m going to say. Ta, bitches!” She unclipped the brake on the stroller and began the arduous trek back up the incline toward the house. Michael took one step to follow her and then stopped, watching her approach Portia’s run and fumble her way through the gate to both Portia’s and Alex’s delight.
“You have a meeting, and I have class,” Michael reminded him. “Eat your snack, and think about why you’re in chastity, Dean. I love you. I’ll see you this afternoon. Swing by and pick me up.”
“I didn’t want to go there, Pete,” he admitted. “But in the moment, I didn’t even give it a second thought. I was thirsty for Cas, and his frikken’ Alpha/wolf hybrid persona, and I jumped right into it without giving it two seconds. Two fucking seconds…” Michael glanced up to make sure his pups hadn’t heard the swear word. “…is all it would have taken for me to think it through and call for a revamp. It didn’t need to go that way. I used you like a cheap fleshlight. You have to know I’m sorry about that. Pete, I’m so sorry. I didn’t want to be that guy.” He frowned and rested his cheek on his arms, watching as the pups accepted Beatrice’s guidance to build the bridge braced against the wall to provide better support for the height they needed. She fetched them cups from the cupboard to provide blocks when they ran out of risers. All four of them were riveted to the task. “It was only a matter of time, though.”
Michael grinned again.  “That asshole isn’t taking April,” he told his mate confidently.  “She got him all turned around with her darting in and out from everywhere.  And I buried my huge fuckin’ teeth in his shoulder and put him in his place.”  Michael giggled.  “Dean, man, I Dominated my own wolf.  Claimed him like an Alpha would.  Shoved his face into the dirt and fucked him stupid.”  He began to laugh harder.  “God, I wish I could have filmed it.  I wish I could show you.  He is
“You and Jess okay?” Dean asked his little brother with concern.  Jess had never tempered her volume when she was angry.  Dean had, of course, heard the shouting.  He and Sam were lugging cases of beer from Garth’s trunk to the back porch where they’d placed an ice-filled cooler.
She went through all the standard questions. Neither Dean nor Michael faltered when Michael confirmed that, yes, he was current on all his prescribed medications. She checked the box off on her list and moved on. When she asked him if he was due for a Release, Dean answered for him.
“I know how it works, alpha.  You don’t hear me whining, do you?  Can you answer the questions?  I was honest with you.”
She rolled her eyes.  “It’s not a long flight, Cas, and you’ll be focused on keeping Dean’s breakfast in his stomach the whole time.  Don’t lie to me.”  She said it warmly, and he took it as intended, kissing her head in apology.
have to do is be yourself. Let them work themselves into whatever they’re going to do, and you ignore it. Be you, Michael.”
“Why the rock-solid loyalty, if I may ask,” ventured Sarah. “What is it about Dr. Nova… um, Winchester that sparks such fierce devotion?”
Jess took up responsibility to keep the conversation light, addressing Jo who was digging idly through the pictures in the box. “Castiel says April wrote him a song for his birthday, said she sang it for him.”
Cas burst out laughing.  “He’s perfect for you, Darius,” he said after achieving the top landing.  “Those boys go hard.  Next time, please don’t play this close to a journey.  I’ve stitched members of that club up in the middle of the night more times than I can recall.  And since you're wearing someone else’s blood home, I expect our clinic night staff is busy patching up whoever you clocked.”
“All right, then.  Set the countdown clock.  We’ll get Cas to the Green room in about 30 minutes.  I don’t imagine he’ll need any fluffing.”  Ellen chuckled and thought, ‘yeah, probably not’.
Dean began to talk in nonsense phrases, speaking whatever passed through his head. Most of it was about what he perceived and what his body’s sensations felt like. The air moved in wisps around him. Clearly the fans weren’t pointed straight at him. They were there for the sound, not the wind. The vibrator lost a power notch, and Dean breathed a relieved sigh. He hadn’t realized how much the damn thing turned him on until it leveled back down. He talked about that, too.
They took a minute to catch their breath and check on one another.  The Omegas seemed fine; and more than fine.  Both of them appeared to have found the entire experience to be great fun.  April giggled to herself and patted her dress back in place.  Cas stopped her from trying to straighten her hair.  It was fine, and the less it was touched, the longer the upsweep would last.  Michael’s upper cheeks were still red with enthusiasm.  He had crow’s feet crinkling his eyes, and he couldn’t resist sweeping Dean into a deeply bent dizzy-inducing kiss.
Dean gaped at him; he swallowed. Cas sighed in response. “I know, Dean. I’m struggling. But it has to be this way. Traditional Pack vengeance would be just as damaging to our mission as sequestering Michael in the house.”
Castiel’s fist relaxed and smoothed out until he was stroking Dean’s hair. “Are you good, my love? Are
“April, I didn’t have to beg people to collaborate with you while you’re here. I had to beat them off with a stick. We got the picking rights. You’ve got it all backward in your head. This isn’t you, a shy, sweet kid on the playground begging to be allowed to play in the cool kids’ sandbox. This is a line of cool kids that goes all the way around the block falling over each other to be noticed by you.”
“Love you, too, baby bro!”  Gabe toasted him and disappeared into the crowd – probably not to seek hydration.
Meg slammed the door on him and turned to rest her back against it.  “He saw you,” she pointed out.  “Why are we hiding again?”
“What do you do when you have a client who reacts to you with sexual arousal?” Dean asked, veering the subject down a different line.
Dean snorted. “Look, man, feel free to trade me for Sammy, but I doubt Jess will go for it since it would mean a sexless life.” He popped another of Castiel’s fries in his mouth.
“Dean Michael,” Michael propped himself up on an elbow.  “Tell me the truth.  Can you share me with another wolf?  Can you see yourself being okay…really okay…with something real and lasting happening between me and April?”
“And money for shoes,” put in Bobby.  “Those sparkly straps holding his feet to the pointy soles that are torqueing his feet all out of alignment probably cost 500 bucks, easy.”
Rule one was about obeying the Alpha.  Cas hadn’t ever told him not to elicit sex from his mate on a plane.  Dean had shared that information after Michael asked, and Michael had called a halt.  Cas’ clear displeasure had been one of the deciding factors, so Michael felt he hadn’t broken that one, exactly.  He had been instructed to watch over Dean when he was vulnerable and to keep him safe, but Michael didn’t quite feel the situation pulled against rule one.  Rule two would only have applied if their activities mussed them up or harmed one of them.  Even drugged, Michael didn’t think a quickie with his mate would injure Dean, physically, psychologically, or otherwise, as long as no one saw them, and Michael felt certain they could have pulled it off in secret.  That one shouldn’t apply either.
“You’ve waited on me far longer than this before,” Cas reminded his husband. “You can stand in a corner all day if I want you to. Talk to me, Pet.”
Gordon looked up at him with distaste and scowled.  “On your knees, Omega.”  The command came from a place that knew its own power and expected to be obeyed.  Gabriel dropped where he stood, spreading his knees wide and leaning his head to one side to bare his throat.  His gaze dropped to the floor.  “You were not in class today.  Explain yourself, Maurice.”
“Uh, yeah, like that.  But, man, that rule makes sense for you and me.  My role there is way more than the hands-on stuff anyway.  I needed to pull back and take a higher-level view.”
He felt sick.  His coffee smelled vile.  His breakfast churned.  Michael sat up abruptly and clutched the back of the couch, but he had nowhere to go, and he was alone.  The Grandfather clock in the hall ticked.  He couldn’t hear anything from the conservatory.  Michael sat for some time with his head bowed over his knees, resting on his elbows, praying the nausea would abate before it forced him to vomit again.  His mouth filled with saliva that felt rancid to swallow.
Dean stared at Cas and chewed his lower lip.  “Does April know that?  Would she go for it?  You can’t ‘Alpha-Dom’ her into a decision like that, you know.  She’s gotta make up her mind for herself.”
“Mm-mm,” Michael disagreed, following and digging him back out.  “That’s not what your wolf is telling me.”
Dean reluctantly worked his way to sitting.  He glared at Michael.  “Why is it that everyone’s always trying to get me to sleep more, and then when I do, you’re all about waking me up?”
The door opened with a whisper swish, and Dean lowered his eyes, bowing his head in deference.  He could see Michael’s polished black leather shoes.  Fully dressed, then.  Nice touch.
Dean looked up at him.  He put an index finger up and leaned in.  “I’ll do it once.  Once.  Never again.”
“You want something from me?” he teased. A thumb traced the outline of his hand along her cheek and jaw. “Want my Claim in here?” He touched her sternum. “Or in here?” he knelt and wiggled his index finger into her navel. “Or in here?” he asked, sinking a thick finger up her cunt.
“Go on, Saleem,” Jo encouraged.  More students were taking their places and trying to catch up on the discussion.  “What do you think an Ozzie should do about a rule they don’t agree with?”
“Michael told me this morning that you still haven’t explicitly committed to learning the skill I set you to practice.  Is that true?”
Dean leaned over and responded quietly, still clapping for Sam.  “Subs don’t pledge to discipline other pack members. Even if they are expected to do it, the door’s always open to have that part removed from their responsibilities.  It’s just never part of their oath.”
“Surprised shock at this point,” Cas replied. His eyes skipped across the screen of his phone. “The most common question I see is about whether she and I have parted ways.”
Sam laughed at his brother’s pitiful attempt to soothe him, but it broke the tension. Dean always had a way of breaking right through when Sam’s uptight became unbearably uptight. He shook his head and stilled his bouncing heel. “Do you know what you’re going to say to him?” Sam asked, changing the subject. He wasn’t looking at his brother anymore.
Fred shuffled toward the back of the house to the staff door behind the garage with a hand on his stomach.  Dean worried.  “Should we send a doctor to his house anyway?  It could be Covid, C.J.”
“Calm yourself, Sarah, please,” he soothed, collecting her drink and handing it back to her.  “These are not issues that should be your concern.  Fred is happy to help, as is Jessica.  We have time before we eat for you to talk with Fred.  I regret that he has duties after dinner that will keep him busy, but Jess is free afterward, if you wish to stay.”
Dean saw Cas’ eyes flick down to his groin where his dick was starting to thicken and twitch.  “You like the way that feels.  That’s good to know.  I’m going to enjoy playing with your nipples, Dean.  They tested as extremely sensitive, and I intend to exploit that.  Keep going.  Pinch them harder and keep rolling them.  I want them over-sensitized and sore before we get the clamps out.”
“It’s only been 24 hours, Bobby.  She’s doing this on purpose.  I know it’s only to test me, but seriously?  She said the Pack and the staff took such good care of the pups that she slept most of yesterday and all night last night.  It’s not sleep deprivation.  She’s a competent professional adult.  Surely she can get through a few days without turning into a basket case.”
Dean met him in the center of the room, square atop the softened surface that could be raised as a platform but for now was flush to the floor.  A new signal from Alpha’s hand put Dean to work, laving his feet with his lips and his tongue.  Dean’s hands took hold of Castiel’s legs while he worshiped the man’s feet with his tongue.  He could do this for hours.  It wasn’t his favorite, but he was good at it.  Each foot received its share of adoration.
Castiel put an arm around Dean’s shoulders.  “What’s he doing to you, sweet boy?” He played into Dean’s complaint.  “You want me to go out there and whip his butt for you?”
“He barged into my Facility and made impudent demands of my staff. You’re telling me he has more power in this negotiation than we do? They’re the desperate ones.” Cas snarled as his hips found space and rhythm, knocking his mate forward to clutch the table.
Fred stopped them in the foyer with a pained expression.  “Ah, Alpha.  Good.  I do regret needing to abandon the household on short notice, but I’ve become unwell rather suddenly, and I need to go home.  I will keep you abreast of my condition as it becomes more certain.  If you will excuse me, please.”
“Can it, Winchester.  They’re nauseating.  Everyone’s thinking it,” Jo retorted, and April laughed again.
Gabe snatched the microphone, grumbling, “It was bad enough having ONE little brother.  Now I’ve got two!”
“At breakfast, or dinner, whenever. I want to Sub for you outside of our scene nights. I want you to feed me. I want to be good for you.” Dean’s face reddened with embarrassment, and he avoided Cas’ eye.
I should say. We need clarity on how they work, on what they do, on how they function in concert with each other. We’re in uncharted water with you, young man.”
“As often as you want or need to.  What’s your Release schedule?”  She spoke calmly and assertively, but the air of kindness stayed a solid vein through her tone.  Jeremy found himself relaxing a little bit.
Castiel didn’t answer right away. His two hands massaged Dean’s left hand, rubbing every now and then over the ring on his finger.
Castiel started with his hand, as usual, and Dean winced, knowing the belt was coming.  What that man could do with his bare hand caused sweat to break from his pores everywhere at once and bead at his hairline after only one strike.  Dean focused on breathing, on feeling, on the heat and the pain and the immediacy and the present moment.  He didn’t track the time, only the power and the intensity.
Sam scratched his head and looked both ways.  “Look, we can hash this out every single day after lunch if you want, but if we’re going to do that, we need to eat earlier.  I’ve been holding it for the last fifteen minutes, and I’ve really gotta go.  You can come with me, or I can hand you off to Charlie.  Which do you prefer?”
Castiel frowned. He’d listened with one ear while he scoured the packet’s every word. “How did he make it through, Benny? Why is Michael sitting here with us when by all accounts he should have self-destructed?”
“What if it doesn’t stop at waiting just a year or two?  What if you never feel like the time is right?  How long are you gonna make us wait?”
cave to a brat tantrum! It isn’t your decision!” Castiel took a menacing step forward, and Dean backed up, throwing a warning hand up.
Dean stole silently after Michael, avoiding open spaces where the moonlight would highlight his movements and dimming his bonds enough to make him harder to see.  For Dean’s part, he didn’t need the bonds to track his mate.  Michael’s arousal gave his trail away like a phosphorescent trace in deep water, and Dean let his alpha do the hunting.  Michael had broken from the path, but there were only so many navigable ways through the dense brush.
“Tony has a little sous chef,” she announced. “Oh, and he said he brought bacon for your breakfast.” She nudged Dean with her toe.
Dean smirked and held her eye, raising his brows.  “Benny’s off chasing Charlie down as we speak.  He knows everything…except that you’ve got a handprint on your cheek.”
“Little brother,” he mumbled, digging his nails into her calf until she squealed and kicked up, laughing.
Dean wanted to show his husband that he could balance on his Submissive side as he’d learned to do on his alpha.  He wanted to prove he had the control necessary to flip from one to the other intentionally as the situation demanded.  He wanted Cas to be proud of him.  He wanted to earn that wink and the confident nod that went with it.
In the car, Dean shifted across to the center and leaned his head on Castiel’s shoulder.  Cas kissed the top of his head and reminded him there was a center seatbelt.  Dean began an undercurrent of grousing about having to sit on his sore ass and having to have retrofit his car with modern safety equipment.  Cas smirked as he put the car in gear.  He let Dean grumble.
“Sometimes. What kind of urges, besides random stamping, do you feel like acting on, Dean?” Pam began patiently to put her cards together again.
Cas stood up and stuck a finger in Dean’s face. “We don’t have an emergency staff on shift twenty-four seven here, Dean! Being a doctor doesn’t make me omniscient! It could have been your heart, an embolism; it could have been a stroke. It could have been anaphylactic shock! I didn’t fucking know! I’m
Cas snapped his eyes to Gabriel and then focused on his mate. “You have thirty minutes,” he told her shortly. “And then I expect you in the parlor. I will add three marks to your board for defiance.”
Dean fought for his breath. A healthy bruise swelled at his cheekbone, but he dared not touch it. He glanced up again. His conditioning kicked in under the mayhem in his head, and he sought his Dominant’s eyes.
He could get away with it too.  Cas had seen him slip in with Michael, and Michael would think he’d convinced Castiel.  Dean stripped down and lowered himself onto the padded bed in the middle of the room face down.  He grunted and stood right back up again, collecting a bottle of slick from the drawer next to the bathroom.  In no time, he had the vibrator in place and cranked all the way up.  He reddened his cheeks with a couple of awkward slaps, reaching clumsily around himself, and he started thrusting slowly.  It felt good, but there was a pall over him that he couldn’t shake.  This was all Castiel’s fault.  If anyone got punished in the morning, it should be the Alpha who had left Dean hanging.
And then the first stroke struck, and Dean grunted and closed his eyes. Michael had chosen to use the sole of his own shoe, and on top of Sam’s palm, it hurt like a motherfucker. Michael hit again, shifting lower.
Castiel put his hand on Michael’s back and guided him over.  He placed his foot in the crotch of Michael’s pants and forced them all the way from his knees to his ankles.  Michael whimpered in distress.  He clutched desperately for the far edge of the desk.
Cas was so turned on, he felt built of steel and muscle. He couldn’t hold it in any longer. He took the stairs three at a time and stormed into the Master suite, more animal than human. She knelt on the floor with her head down, looking weary.
“I never wanted to leave you, Dean.”  Cas glanced across the seat, uncertain for some reason that Dean couldn’t fathom.  The peace and joy of this place didn’t seem to affect Cas the way it did Dean.  Maybe it was the difference in their constitutions.  Maybe the angel/human schism played out differently here than it did on Earth.  This was Castiel’s home, after all.  “Especially not like that.”  The look in Cas’ eye.  It was worry.  Castiel was worried.
“I notice Sam’s not here with you. Does he know you’re here?” A glint of judgment sparked in Rufus’ dark eyes.
“Thank you,” he said, accepting the switch.  Dean stood awkwardly while Michael inspected it, unsure of where and how he should be.  The inspection didn’t take long, and Dean moved quickly when Michael used the switch to point him to the mattress.  Slipping out of his flimsy shoes, Dean arranged himself over the end.  It wasn’t really a bed, per se.  It was a lined, cushioned surface that could be adjusted to whatever height.
Cas side-eyed him. It was the Alpha’s call. “What do you want to do?” he asked. Michael’s chuckle was as filthy as he could make it.
The door jerked open suddenly, and Dean found himself looking at Nicholas Maraby instead of Fred.  Nick took in the cop and the two pale faces, and his eyes widened comically.  Or, it would’ve been comic if any part of this was even a little funny.
“Benny!  Finally!  Come in.  Do you have the ring?”  Cas advanced on him, and Benny slipped in laughing.  He looked refined in his tuxedo, fully dressed and relaxed.
Michael adjusted his angle, rolling back so that Dean lay mostly beneath him.  There was no indication that they had a mountain of unfinished business between them.  That would wait.  It would still be there.  Michael tangled his hands in Dean’s hair and came across Dean’s fingers with a whoof of his breath, trying to keep quiet.  He let his alpha offer his sticky hand to him to lick clean, and they shared it like a late-night snack.  Dean could feel Michael’s sense of relief cover every part of their bonds.  He could also feel a wave of sorrow, remorse, guilt, and trepidation follow it.
Kate took a deep breath, bracing herself. “She’s a Dominant,” she told Mildred as if that would explain her discomfort. Seeing that it didn’t, Kate shrugged. “Maybe it’s nothing. But I can’t bring myself to trust a Dominant. Not yet.”
“Go on, Kitten. Turn on the hormone sensors. They’re beside the light switch. If he asks you to bind him, you may do so, but do not leave him alone while he’s bound. Call me if you need anything.” He embraced her briefly and kissed her temple, then sent her off with a tap to her lower back. “Goodnight, Kitten. I’ll see you in the morning.” Castiel fell onto a barstool and eyed his jacket, wadded sadly on the floor. April and Gabriel disappeared down the hall with their heads close together.
“Michael…” Dean whimpered, overwhelmed at the praise, and finding it painful to process while he was feeling such pleasure physically. Michael’s channel was hot, tight, and wet. It clenched around his length, embracing and massaging, so welcoming, so warm. Dean’s sweats bunched below his knees. He lifted his knees and set his feet flat against the leather, pulling his hips down to begin a rhythmic thrusting. Michael groaned, leaning forward and transferring his hands to Dean’s chest and shoulders, holding on. Dean began to pummel his mate’s ass with powerful, meaningful thrusts. His head was still torqued back on the arm of the couch, out of sync with the forcefulness of his thrusting, a contradiction in presentations that Michael found irresistible.
“And we’re going to keep it that way,” Michael told him, nudging his hip to the side to give Michael room to swing.
Kali and Garth snickered.  “It’s a private party,” Dean reminded her.  “You’re the only round ear in the joint besides the restaurant staff and our household folks who are used to Gabe already.  We keep track of who’s around.”
Matt looked around the table.  Jo and Charlie hadn’t spoken for some time, but they both nodded in confirmation.  “You ALL knew?”  Nick laughed outright.  “Even my mother doesn’t know.”  Matt was astounded.
Dean blinked slowly as he followed the line of reasoning. “You need an un-Mated Omega as a test subject,” he surmised. “Someone you can use as a guinea pig to test the temperature of the water for challenging a Mating-Claim.”
“Yes, Alpha.  I’m sorry.  It was just a surprise.  I won’t let you down.”  Sam was still anxious, and he knew Dean could sense it, but they weren’t asking him to be in complete control, only to appear to be in complete control.  He could do that.  Castiel nodded gamely at him, squeezed his shoulder, and left to speak to someone else.
Bare-assed and sweaty with his legs trapped by crumpled clothing tangled at his knees, Dean went back to work, leaning deep into the cavern of the engine and stretching out flat-backed without ever looking at his audience.
“Hand him to Gabriel, Dean,” Michael told his mate sleepily.  “I want him to be in his uncle’s arms when he hears his name.  We need Bobby, if he’s here.”
“Well, yeah.  I wanted to make real clear, while we’re on the subject of getting rules and roles settled, that I didn’t join the pack to be y’all’s official pack E.O.  I do that enough at work.  I mean, I’ll take whatever action that I need to as third-ranking wolf, but I want to make it clear that I don’t expect everyone to just send their problems through me.”
“Yes, Sir.”  Dean was coming back to himself slowly.  Cas found a box of tissues on Dean’s bedside table and cleaned his face.
Cas picked up the pace once he was sure Michael’s channel wasn’t overtaxed by his girth. Omega channels were built to stretch. He pressed in deeply then pulled out only to push right back in again, thrumming. Every stroke moved Michael’s cock in the tunnel of Dean’s sore ass cheeks. Michael went lax between them, becoming the conduit he never would have permitted himself to be with anyone other than these two who sandwiched him here over cool steel.
Dean began a slow recitation of an ancient calming prayer in his head.  He felt his heartrate slow.  He felt warmth in his belly, and he pushed it out to the tips of his fingers and his toes.  He concentrated on every body part one at a time, cataloguing the sensations from each area, sending in oxygen, heat, relaxation, gratitude, and peace.  Dean felt himself morph into a conduit of sorts.  He felt the sheer, inexplicable pleasure of releasing his will for the satisfaction of someone else, someone he loved, someone he trusted.  Dean let his thoughts float.  He rounded into each thought as if entering a room, looking around, getting the full picture, examining its depth and context, and then leaving it behind without commentary.
Castiel’s gut unclenched immediately, the pain disappearing as if it had never been. He released a breath. He nodded against the side of her head. “All right, my Omega. As you wish.”
“Party’s outside,” Jack commented. He lingered in the door to the gameroom where Michael was racking billiard balls for a solo game. Michael glanced up, lifted the triangle, leaving the balls set, and wordlessly collected a cue stick from the wall. He handed it to Jack. He nocked his head toward the table, granting Jack the break.
son.  Alex was his as surely as he was Michael’s, and it hadn’t taken any mental gymnastics to bring him to that conclusion.  It just was.  Looking down into his son’s face and seeing Dean’s eyes was dizzying.
“Good morning, Alpha,” greeted Michael, lifting up to Cas’ prying fingers so the Alpha could get a look at the damage to his ass. It wasn’t bad. It would be back to normal in a couple of days. Cas patted his ass to let him know he could lower back down onto his mate’s cock.
You’re either doing this on your own or you’re going to concede your position as second in command.”
Benny growled fiercely at him and stepped right up into his space. “Watch your tone with me, boy! I’m not about to put up with it. Sam may let you off-leash a bit, but rest assured, I’m gonna choke right up on that fucker until you get the picture.”  Benny was seething, and Cole barely resisted stepping backward out of the direct line of Benny’s brutal eyes. “You don’t like that analogy, fine. Let me lay it out for you in plain English. I’ve seen you brutalize and intimidate your charges for the last time. You are here to
“Very good,” he told her blandly. “Again.” And he licked her all the way up once more, reaching up to tweak a nipple hard.
“On the plus side, Claire ran a rescue run early this morning based on Gabriel’s info and pulled three more Omegas out.  They were part of the original fifteen that Gordon had, and they are all in relatively good shape, so it’s a solid win.  No one was hurt.  Claire, Ash, Krissy, and Alex split up to get them to safety.  That leaves nine more, and Gabe’s homing in on two others.  It looks like Gordon ordered them pulled off into small groups.  Gabe thinks none of them are being kept in groups larger than three.  That’s going to make them harder to find but maybe easier to rescue.  He just wants to get to them before they get sold.  Everyone seems to have gone to ground though, so that’s on our side too.  If they’re too scared to make a sale or transfer, that means they stay traceable longer.”
Michael raised an eyebrow.  Just one.  “You better not be selling sexual favors for donations, Dean.”
His dick was hard and leaking, pulsing occasionally. He felt tense and horny. He needed to put Dean on his knees once he got this damned ball gag out of his mouth. The bondage scenes made him shiver, and he wondered if they had any way to distinguish that it was the idea of being bound that was anathema, and not the idea of binding a Sub, especially while he was indeed bound to the chair.
“You’re not weak, Michael!  Stop that right now!  You witnessed something horrifying, and it’s hit close to home, but that wasn’t you, and it’s never going to BE you!”
Castiel’s jaw couldn’t get any tighter.  Chuck just stood to the side, still awkwardly holding the check in one hand.
“Fuck my hand, baby boy. Fuck your daddy’s hand and come for me. Such a good boy!” Adam cried out as his cock spurted ropes of come onto the mattress liner and his own belly. His ass clenched around Garth’s cock, and Garth tumbled right behind him, shooting his load high up into the Omega, and going still as he pulsed, veins standing out in his neck, fingers flinching to resist taking him by his hips. Michael kissed his shoulder when Garth finished and then pulled out of the beta. He eased Garth to the side, letting him fall onto his back on the edge of the bed, and Michael took his place.
Benny laughed.  “That’s what I love best about you, Sam.  You think like a survivor.  It’s survivors who are gonna win this for us.”
Billie’s presence was a definite shift in tone over the previous three.  Where Jo had been youthful passion and enthusiasm, Ellen had been steadfast expertise, Sam had painted them all a picture of his vision and convinced everyone he knew how to get there, Billie was cold judgment.  Her eyes were unyielding, and she made it clear that it was the Boards that were under examination here, not she, and that if she found them lacking, they would find themselves ruing that they’d had the gall to present themselves this morning at all.  And she hadn’t said a word yet.  And she was beta.  And she had no reputation to speak of, or, well, no reputation that any of them could talk about publicly.  They all knew her, and most of them owed her a favor or two, but no one wanted to admit just
“I’m not mad, Dean. Watching without being able to contribute was unexpectedly erotic. You were amazing. How are you feeling about it now? You don’t feel a drop coming, do you?”
“Apologies, Dean.  That was all the punishment I meant to deliver, so from that perspective, we’re through.  Come here and lay down with me for a few minutes.  I owe you some cuddle time.”
“Oh, please,” Gabe scoffed, but he put his jeans back on and helped Kate dress six little squirmy bodies.
“Ohhhhh,” said Michael.  “Yeah, that’s…okay, I get it.  And that’s what Pete’s been doing all this time?  Watching us with the front brain underneath the surface and making her Omega say things that she didn’t know why she was saying?  Well, that doesn’t sound so complicated.  Why is Castiel so upset about it?  Doesn’t he read those books too?”
He wasn’t really even present, was he? Was he here at all? He was floating freely, kept aloft by tongues and hands, paddles and cocks. He began to feel himself separate from his body, to view the scene from a place above his shoulder, in all its absurdity. There were two distinct parties underway at once, and Dean’s body served as the lowest subjugation of the baser of the two.
Thank you all (in Texas we say y'all), for the well-wishes.  This cycle's headache was both shorter and less severe than usual, so I'm good.  I only got one chapter done, but it's longer than usual, so total word-count is probably about the same.
“What if we’ve both got a True-mate out there somewhere?” she asked wistfully, gazing past the far bleachers where the sun was disappearing.
hedonistic nonsense. I bought him a traditional scene. See if you people can knock his head back on right.”
He had nothing more to say to his mate.  He could feel her panic through the bond, and she could feel his resolve.  Sam slipped a tiny single-use packet of lube from his pocket and held it in his teeth.  All of his self-doubt was gone.  The wolf knew what it was doing and what it was going to communicate to the bitch he loved.  He quickly worked his belt and pants open and pushed everything down to his knees.  He ripped the packet open with his teeth and smeared the contents on his cock.  He was hard and ready.  He didn’t know exactly when that had happened.
bottom. Like, I can’t even picture how that would work. So, if you’re not sleeping around, and you’re not topping your scene partner, who exactly do you top? Contract scenes don’t count.”
“I resent the hell out of being forced to get help fixing something I can fix on my own.  I don’t need this
“Anything but that.  C’mon alpha.  Is that all you think about?  Give me an order.  You want me to stick my tongue in your ass?  You like a good, solid rimming?”  Michael walked Dean to the bed and pushed him gently onto his back, pulling his legs up and pressing his knees toward his belly to reveal his hole.
“Sir, I’m sorry.  I didn’t realize you were waiting on me.  It won’t happen again.  I swear.”  Dean took a shaky breath when Castiel didn’t relax or respond.  They were still new at this, at least as a couple, as partners, but Dean was learning.  Castiel wanted him to be capable of reading by body language, by scent and tone, just what kind of response the Dom wanted from his Sub, and Dean was suddenly aware that the room was full of nonverbal signals he’d missed upon entering.
Cas stared in bewilderment. April’s emotions were awash with excitement and enthusiasm. And anxiety. He backed up without looking away from her frenetic mess and sat with a plunk on the couch under the window. April glanced up and met his eye but then went back to work. Her pencil flew over the page. Every now and then she played a snippet on the keyboard in front of her on the table. Gabriel hovered for a minute to make sure Cas wasn’t going to interrupt again. Then he joined Cas on the couch.
“No worries there either,” Michael breathed out. We’ll just switch places. If you’re spent, and you can’t get it up anymore, you roll your ass right over and take it from behind. I can play both sides of the plate. Deal?”
“Couldn’t get away,” Charlie explained. “Somebody’s got to put the hours in. First, Dean takes off, then Jo and me snuck out. Place is going to be deserted by mid-afternoon if it keeps going like this.”
The week flew by all in that vein, never getting quite enough accomplished to scratch an item completely off the ‘To Do’ list, but doggedly pressing forward.  Media interviews were conducted on the hoof by cell phone, covering everything from Castiel’s epic new power rating, to the status of the merger, to the stalling of the FBI’s investigation in Oklahoma, to the rise of an angry wave of dissension over the ACRI’s stance on Omega rights, to the upcoming nuptials.  Everyone was buzzing.  Everything was at stake.
“And tattle on whoever leaves toothpaste globs in the sink,” Kaia muttered. “Is that all? Can I go?”
“Oh,” she said with surprise. “Congratulations. I’d heard you and Dr. Winchester were engaged, but I assumed you would be keeping your name. I thought wolves followed the lines of hierarchy on that, unlike Primates, who mostly follow the paternal line.”
“I don’t care what ya’ are, just as long as you follow my rules. So listen up! I hate going through this shit twice.”  He left her hand hanging there awkwardly and turned to the security desk.
“All right.  It sounds like you’ve done your homework, both of you.  Please keep me informed about your progress and let me know if you need anything from me.”
“No good.  That leaves your mother, perish the thought, or Gabriel and Sammy up for grabs. You wanna share your mate with either of those numbskulls?”  Dean changed lanes to pass a heavily loaded eighteen-wheeler and accelerated to move on ahead of the building traffic.  It felt good to let his Baby open up and run.
Michael stretched out forward on his belly and propped his chin up beside her leg.  “And to fuck, which is creepy.  You play that role very well.”
“And April?  You’re going to get a Grammy for that song if we market it right.  It’s phenomenal.  If I haven’t told you how proud I am of you, then let me say it now.  I am in awe of your talent and your work ethic, and I’m going to be fighting Michael every step of the way to be your biggest fan.”
The Winchester family kitchen table, even with the extra leaf installed, was barely big enough for eight wolves, but they made it work. In truth, sharing space as tightly packed as they were helped both Dean and Sam. Cas would be gone all day tomorrow, and there was still much to do before Wednesday’s service. Sam, Dean, Jess, and Jo were all taking Tuesday and Wednesday off work, but Michael would be with his tutors, and Castiel would be out of town entirely. Dean refused to consider the idea that he might not come back on time. The FBI had nothing on him. They would never have anything on Castiel. It was all locked down tighter than Fort Knox. This interview was all part of Bobby’s design. Worrying about it was only going to make Dean crazy, so he forced it out of his mind. Cas could handle this. He’d sat before Congress and made them all look like idiots. He could handle the FBI.
Cas laughed and took a swig from his bottle.  At the bar, Dean had stepped away from his stool and was mimicking a punch drunk alpha buffoon, laughing hard as he ducked an imaginary punch and falling on his ass as the man picketing outside their construction site had done.  Charlie followed Castiel’s eyes, laughing along with most of the bar.  It really had been funny when it happened, funnier still in the way it was presented on the evening news.
Cas gave him a reproving look, and Dean shrugged.  Castiel took the towel and dried himself efficiently.  He didn’t miss the catch in Dean’s gait as he collected bathrobes.
“No! You know what? You got a week left of this blackout? Fine, I’m putting in for a week’s vacation starting right now. You let me know when his ass is black and blue again, and I’ll be back.” Billie stood up to retrieve her bag and her keys. Cas moved faster. He flattened her against the dining room wall and breathed heavily in her ear.
Dean closed his mouth, clamping the switch between his teeth. It pulled the sides of his mouth as it stuck out a good distance on both sides.
“I’m going to keep things simple today, Dean.  I will be following the plan we drew up together with no alterations.  Consider this a full scene, but also a bit of a test run.  I expect complete compliance from you.  I expect your full submission, and I expect you to work hard for me.  Don’t get lazy and think I’m going to do all of your work.  It doesn’t work that way.  Do you understand?”
“How can you be sure?”  She stood and followed him slowly to the door as he opened it for her.  All sounds from down the hall had ceased.
At length, Sam’s frown deepened, and he drew in a breath to speak, looking bravely back up at the Alpha.
“You didn’t drop, Michael.  You hunkered down.  Your body took you into ultimate survival mode, but your mind was ready to reboot once the chemicals cleared out.  That’s not a drop.  You did everything right.  You shifted some of the weight to us, and you let yourself rest.  I’m warning you not to get comfortable and expect to gain strength back slowly over the next few days.  This isn’t the flu.  If your symptoms have faded, it’s time to move on.”
“I’ll get it,” April’s voice sounded from behind him on the bed.  Dean turned his head to find Michael beside him, watching him closely, poised to touch his cheek and gift him a simple smile.  He was back in the Master bed.
“We’re not gonna keep having this discussion again and again.  You get your head straight right now.  Pick a side, Castiel.  Play it dirty or play it clean, but don’t waffle back and forth and then blame me for pulling your keister outta the flames you get yourself into.  Which is it gonna be?  Choose.”
The pediatrician carried Kathleen to her mother, carefully wrapped, her eyes already glistening with antibiotic, and her face already scrubbed clean.  April kissed her tiny brow, but as another contraction slammed into her, Michael whisked the pup away and handed her to Sarah without looking.  Sarah was smitten from first sight, taken aback at the sudden appearance of a jet-haired infant in her arms.  The pup was alert and focused, taking in her packmate’s face, working out how to demand an explanation.  A bubble of mirth escaped Sarah as she cradled the tiny pup.  She’d forgotten how small they started now that Alex was in his sixth month.  Her brain had recalibrated to a larger infant.  This one was tiny, but her fierce determined expression belied her size.  This had to have been what Castiel had been like as a newborn.  Sarah could see him in miniature in everything about the serious little face.
“Let’s move to Scotland,” she suggested. “Just you and me. No pack. No Alphas. No family. We’ll raise sheep. Get one of those sheep-herding dogs.”
“Thanks, Dean. I mean it.” She was still sitting alone at the table near the back in the big room that had almost emptied of people.
“That’s what I was doing, alpha.  I knew what the rules were, and I knew I was pulling a fast one.  Shocked me to get away with it for, like, three days.  I thought you’d catch on for sure.”
Castiel pulled himself up then hoisted Dean to his feet as well. “Let’s get showered and dressed. Come on, Dean. We’ll help you.”
“SUBMISSIVE” – Dean wrote in big block letters on the chalkboard at the front of the room.  He underlined it and turned around to face the students, still holding the chalk in his hand as he wandered a few steps forward.  “Welcome to your first day of Sub class.  We’re gonna have a good time together.  Going to learn a lot, grow in confidence and power, gonna braid each other’s hair, and build a campfire where we all hold hands and share our darkest fears…  Nah.  I’m kidding, of course.”  Dean’s class laughed nervously.  They would soon begin to shed their tension borne from the unknown – just a bit.  Obviously, if their instructor could make jokes right off the bat, he couldn’t be all bad, right?  He’s either pretty fucking cool or a complete psycho.  They were optimistically hopeful for the former.
The intercom crackled on.  Bobby’s voice was too loud, and it disturbed the peace of the Processing room.  “All right, folks.  We’ve got your Honeymoon suite all set up.  Whenever you’re ready, just head out the door through the Green room, and we’ll get you safely back home.”  Castiel shook his head in light amusement.  Honeymoon suite?
“Water’s fine!” Michael called back.  He picked up the folder and opened it.  There was a headshot of Dean at 19 stapled to the top corner of the first page.  Michael smiled at the boy in the picture, covered in soft freckles, and obviously scared out of his wits.  He read the preliminary notes and the admittance assessment.  It looked to Michael like the prelim team were all smitten with Dean before he ever disrobed.  A ping of prideful ownership hit Michael’s solar plexus again, and he blushed even though no one was around to see him.
going to harm him, damnit! Only, hadn’t he just overstepped boldly enough to prove that declaration ridiculous? It was a mantrum repeated in Dean’s head so often, it barely held any meaning anymore. Dean fiddled with the cuticle of his thumbnail. Cas’ chin on his shoulder was warm, not heavy. There was a hand on Dean’s right hip and another tucked around his left inner thigh, pressed between Dean’s weight and Cas’ leg. Dean swallowed again.
“Don’t let them forget about Alex,” April said through clenched teeth.  If this was early labor, the thought of the hours ahead made her head swim in dread.
“Or,” Cas said, grunting a little as he stood up. “You can keep dancing around each other and setting sparks off in all directions. Dean and I will keep cleaning up the spills until we weary of it and find a way to resolve the tension that neither of you will enjoy.”
“Trust?” Sam stalled at the door. “You’re up to something. I can smell it. And you want me to trust you?”
“It was six weeks, man, and I still had my right hand and my trusty purple ribbed stiffy. Plus, they were giving me pops every other day for something or other. My backside was as purple as my vibrator. I never had to go two weeks of nothing at all. I’m telling you, it’s gonna kill me. At least swat my ass a few times. Come on, Michael.” Dean had his head canted over the back of the chair, exposing his entire throat and grinding his hips into nothing. Michael wasn’t sitting close enough for any contact there.
“Would it be all right with you if we do that after our month in solitary?  I kind of want to stay quarantined with you as much as possible.”
Billie lifted her head and found her mate’s eye. Both women stared motionless, shocked and overcome. It had happened so fast. Forty-five seconds at the most, and all of Billie’s years of denial were for naught.
“So, you’re going to wrap me up in bubble-wrap?”  Dean pulled his face back far enough to look Cas in the eyes.  “You can’t keep me safe like that, Alpha.”
Castiel flew to his feet with a furious roar, and he backhanded Gabriel hard enough to whirl him around and fling him to the floor, catching on his hands and elbows.
“All my childhood exploits, out in plain view for Dr. Meyer to pick through?” asked Cas, handing off a basket of bread rolls to April.
Oh shit, he was doing the eyebrow thing. “No, Alpha! No, I’m so sorry. It won’t happen again, I swear.”
No one had yet explained why an Omega fled his own mate once a chase was triggered.  They all did it.  They all ran with terrified determination.  Instinct made them run, but what sense did an instinct to run away from the security of one’s own mate make in perspective of the survival of the species?  It was a baffling but ubiquitous behavior.
“April’s hiding things from me.  I don’t know how she’s doing it.  And she let a crack show in her façade yesterday that I haven’t seen before.  You told me there’s something we need to discuss about Michael that will affect the four of us, but then you sat on it like you’re hoping I’ll forget.  I want to know everything you know, Dean.  I don’t want you to have to break your confidences, but I’m beginning to feel like we don’t have a choice.  They’re Omega.  They shouldn’t have secrets from their mates.  It’s dangerous.”  Cas was on a roll at this point, and Dean let him run through the lot of it.
“Right in here, ladies.  Don’t be nervous.  This is the fun part.”  Charlie led them into the small room, lined with more chairs than were strictly needed, and a small fridge full of water bottles.  Meg followed Jo in, and they stood awkwardly in the middle of the room, looking to each other for courage.
“Walk, please, Submissive,” he called patiently forward and was a little shocked when Dean slowed to a quick walk.
He found the segment that listed in exhaustive detail everything Dean had agreed Cas could do to him without a scene discussion. It wasn’t short. Dean shifted his weight forward, wrapping his lower legs outside of Cas’ shins and tucking his feet behind Cas’ ankles as an anchor. He took the mouse from Cas and skimmed as he scrolled through the list, pausing at relevant items.
“Can I ask why?”  She broke the silence.  “Why not try a route that doesn’t rely on mother nature’s good will?  It was good enough for Jess and Sam.  Your brother can pull strings and have …”
“Okay, so now it’s a two-step process from here. Security and Medical are looking for an ID match and to check that all your chemical, birth control, & medication levels are normal, and that you’re not sick. So you…and it don’t matter which one you do first…you spit into one of these tubes, up to this mark,” he filled the tube to the mark with his saliva. It wasn’t much as it was a small tube. “Snap it all the way closed. It makes a God-awful mess if you don’t get it closed, so listen for it to snap.”  He demonstrated clearly. Seemed simple enough to Jody. “Then you shove it in this slot and close the lid. You see the screen says, ‘Received?’”
“Touch of morning sickness,” he explained.  “Give me a couple of hours and a good nap.  It’ll pass.”
“You’ve given us a great deal to think about, Max.” Cas was back to his usual Alpha self, down a couple of energy levels from the one that stoked Max’s embers. “I congratulate you on your certification, and I welcome you to the ACRI staff.”
Cas cocked his head. “Interesting. I wonder if I allow you to keep digging just how deep you will go.”  Cas’ eyes dropped to Dean’s dick as it twitched and stiffened a little.
Michael didn’t rise to the bait. Castiel’s hard hand had its uses, and Michael held onto his patience and kept his eye on the target. “Of course I care, Dean, but you don’t owe me that. You are my Mate, not my spouse. Let’s not get the two confused. You know, you two could have married each other years ago. You just needed to mate a couple of bland, compliant
That was a harder question.  His knees were fine.  His ass hugged the plug like a pacifier, and that was fine.  His nipples ached though, and they had begun to throb.  “Mostly, sir.” he managed.
“Yes, Michael?  Do you not wish to accompany April to her first Grammy award ceremony?  I won’t force you.  I assumed you would enjoy it.”
“She hasn’t been much of a mother in a very long time,” Cas wasn’t giving Gabriel the emotional response he wanted, so Gabe tried another tack.
“Then why did she hide her car around the bend?  Surely, Ketch would approve of you dispensing medical care to a sick Packmate.  In fact, I imagine he’d insist on it if he knew.  Don’t lie to me.”
“No. I have a date tonight. Gotta get home and tidy up a little first, trim the shrubbery, make sure everything smells nice. You know the drill. I wanna encourage her to get dirty later, so I need to spend some time sprucing up the landing. She has this thing she does with the very tip of her tongue.” Charlie didn’t so much as blush as she buckled Alex into the high seat in the back. She addressed April. “You know the thing, right? The tongue thing?”
Stop right here and go back one chapter to catch the link that I forgot to post in the pre-chapter notes.  It's a preview of April's 'Witch' song.  I stole it, but whatever.
“Yeah, spare me, please,” Sam returned without heat.  The lightness in his body spoke volumes.  It looked good on Dean’s gargantuan brother.
Cas laughed and shook his head. “One thing I know about Dean,” he said. “If he wants something kept private, then I’d better keep it private if I know what’s good for me. Excuse me, Gabe. You might want to steer clear of the basement for the next few hours.”
“If he learns what’s bubbling around down in there and what it has to do with me, I need to be here to confront him.  We can’t let her take all that alone.”
Cas and Michael both laughed. Sam rolled his eyes. “So, this thing you did last night. Whatever it was. It worked? My black eye is the only collateral damage? He’s off the hook for a few months?”
“Let’s get you three settled in the guest house.  Breakfast is here in the house at six-thirty if you’d like to join us, but you don’t have to.”  Cas spoke to Jerry with a hand moving over Dean’s back.  “You’ll get Michael all to yourself tomorrow, Alpha.  The rest of us need to put in another hard day’s work, unfortunately, before the weekend, but we’ll be home early to prepare for my mother’s arrival for dinner.  Michael’s duties as Pack Manager are flexible.  I believe he has nothing much pressing to accomplish tomorrow, so he’s yours for the day.  If any of you would like to visit our Facility for a tour, just have Michael text ahead, and I’ll arrange an escort.”
“So good for me,” Michael whispered as he kissed the side of Dean’s face. “But we’re supposed to be cleaning me.”
“Why the hell would I be using contractors?! No! It’s private, Missouri. And I’m fine. We’re done.” He redressed quickly, and he put Michael’s table between himself and the doctor, a glare fixed hard on his face.
“Fine. Whatever. Go screw your brains out. I don’t care.” Dean gave up trying to settle on his back and rolled over, cinching his pillow in and wrapping both arms beneath it.
Billie sighed.  “I issued your statement to the press.  This morning’s paper is full coverage of the explosion, and they’re already drawing correlations between yesterday’s bombing and back to Timothy McVeigh.  Most every significant leader in the Lupin community has a quote in there somewhere, denouncing the violence and loss of life.”
Castiel announced to them that Andrea and Benny were expecting at last after too many failed attempts to count, and that Benny was over the moon.  April raised a glass to the happy couple which Michael seconded and they all toasted the Lafitte’s good fortune.
“Jerry, may I have your permission to call on you and your mate for advice about Michael?  You know him better than anyone.  I want what’s best for him, and I appreciate that you do too.  Will you help us?”  Castiel had no intention of acting upon any advice from Jerry, but he needed the Alpha to feel involved, at least a little.
Jody cocked her head jauntily. “Only if staying on as my student isn’t something you value. I’ll cut you loose right now if you want me to.” She winked, damn her.
“Well, I guess it has to do with the fact that Sam’s just watching over you like a brother should.  I’m a brother myself.  I know what it’s like to watch people who can hurt your sibling get in there and…maybe mess it all up.  Plus, Sam isn’t sleeping with you the way Alpha is.”
It didn’t take long. The vendor insisted on taking a selfie with Cas in his UNLV regalia. JT snuggled down in the hollow of Cas’ carry-on, wrapped up in his swaddling blanket. Cas smiled ironically at the camera and thanked the man—Gus—sincerely. The soft clothes were much more comfortable than his standard travel clothes, but as Billie always reminded him, appearances matter. This trip was personal though. He could afford comfort this once. Cas checked all the pockets of the clothes he was leaving behind just to be sure, stuffed them into a bin outside the shop, collected the sleeping pup and his bag, nodded to Gus, and hurried to catch up with Sam and Jess at the gate.
Dean’s orgasm forced his hips into a staccato pulse, freezing into motionlessness at the end, as he lost all of the control of his own body.  Cas rutted in tight and hard, chasing his own, and spilled into Dean as Dean’s sobs broke back out into the big space with the high ceiling.  They echoed back at the couple as Dean turned his head into Cas’ chin and kissed the side of Cas’ face again and again, crying shamelessly.  “Love you so much, Cas.  Please don’t ever leave me.  I can’t…I love you.  God, baby, I need you so bad…”  Dean fell apart beneath the Alpha.  Cas wrapped both arms around his love and let their tired bodies collapse onto the mattress.  He released Dean’s shoulder and kissed him over the bite again and again, still pressing his hips into Dean’s ass, keeping the pressure steady and tight so his knot wouldn’t pull.  It wouldn’t hurt for long after Cas had prepped Dean with his entire hand.  He might even be able to work the knot loose if he tried, but neither of them wanted to let go that quickly.
Dean declined the sedatives on the flight home, and that made him even more anxious.  Castiel refused outright to allow the wayward couple to sit together.  He wasn’t stupid.  Michael didn’t care about rules unless they were his own, and Dean’s brat would benefit double from misbehaving during the flight, getting a chance to enjoy himself on the flight, followed by a delicious reprimand for his misbehavior later.  Castiel sat beside Michael and put Dean in the aisle seat next to April just across the way.  Cas could still touch and talk to Dean.  He found that having an Ozzie to watch over helped keep Dean calmer than expected.  All in all, it was a good solution, although no one seemed to want to chat much.  Castiel reviewed emails and sipped his water.  No one ever said being a responsible Pack Alpha was always going to be fun.
“No, Sir, but I knew you were upset and needed an outlet.  I am here and willing if you choose to use me to balance yourself.”
Michael petted his hair again and ran the back of his hand over Dean’s cheek.  “Very well put, my love.  That’s it just exactly.”  He circled around Dean again and then squatted in front of his Sub.  Dean was able to see that he was still fully dressed, and the knowledge drove his cock further toward fully erect.  Dean’s Sub loved to be naked when the Dom wasn’t.  It felt…debasing somehow, in the best way.  He didn’t raise his eyes from the floor, but he shivered in anticipation.  Something was coming.  A shoe was about to drop.  He could feel it, and it felt like he should already have figured it out, but he hadn’t.
“What kind of message is that to send to my Secondary, Winchester?” Michael teased.  “Letting me skip class and clinicals, shrugging off … what did you call it …pathologically stupid behavior that just so happened to flatten the Styne’s cult in one afternoon.  Maybe instead of punishing me, you should bake me cookies.  Plus, I hadn’t even told you yet, I got a stellar review from Lawrence Memorial and a note of gratitude for my work last week.  Jody said I can almost skip the rest of the semester and I’ll still pass in the top half of the class.”
He moved like lightning and was leaning over her, intimidating in his presence.  “Tell me one more time that you cannot fulfill my instructions simply because you’ve ‘never done it before’, and I’ll excuse you from this body and replace you with someone who has the welfare of the pack in mind.  Test me, alpha.”
They were triumphant and exhausted and ready to go home. From here, the production company had custody of the show. April’s job was done. It was time to turn to something else. Something new.
He looked down into the preternaturally wise face and tilted his head. “We’ve got this, don’t we Hank? What do you think? Should we let Uncle Crowley stew a bit more before we try to eat him? That’s right,” he confirmed to the infant. “Stew is always best if it simmers for a good long time.”
“Shit! Michael!” Dean tried to go to him, but his legs wouldn’t hold him, and he toppled gracelessly to the bed. Cas sprang up, fixed Dean in place with a look, and then picked Michael up off the floor, feeling his head for swelling or bruises. He seemed fine, and he began to come around before Cas even had him laid out next to Dean. Dean showered his face with relieved kisses.
Sam cuddled his son, commiserating with him and kissing his elbows in sympathy.  Cas strolled by, casually handing Sam the wooden dowel he’d confiscated only moments before.  Sam held it away from J.T.’s reach.  “Do we hit people with our toys, John Thomas?” he prompted.
They didn’t say anything else for some time.  Michael sulked in the hallway.  Dean guessed April was probably with him, probably trying to talk him down, and the image caused another bubble of laughter to break through the kiss.  Castiel’s dry lips were softer than they looked, and now they were swollen, red, and spit-slick.  Dean took control of his giggles and dove back in for another kiss, but Castiel dodged him.
“It’s a perfect opportunity, Alpha.  You have to see that.”  Dean followed his husband a couple of steps toward the kitchen door and then stopped.  “Cas, please.  I need…”
Dean shook his head.  “It’s not a crisis.  We got kicked out of our space.  So, fine.  We go find another space.  There are literally thousands.”
“Right, I forgot.”  Cas leaned back to let Zeke set down three beers and a single glass of unchilled water that he placed with a
“Doubt it.  It’s complicated.  I’ll check in with him when we get there, after I drop you off with Pamela.”  Dean rolled onto his side, facing away from Michael and pressed back into him.  Michael wrapped him up in his arms.
“What? It’s true! Everyone’s thinking it. The poor kid hasn’t even Presented yet, but he’s got some kind of mutant Tertiary tearing him apart from the inside!”
“Thank you for looking after April last night, Dean.  She’s shaken this morning, but she’s much better than she would have been without you.”  His words weren’t clipped, but there was a telltale stiffness to their delivery that put Dean’s wolf on notice.  Dean signaled the wolf to lie back down and relax.  It obeyed with a huff of impatience.  The wolf knew that tone from Cas.  They needed each other.  Waiting wasn’t going to help matters.  It never did.  Dean ignored its petulance.
A bubble of laughter escaped April’s lips, and she bit down on the lower one, oddly ashamed of having laughed. Cain zipped her up. She looked up at him as he circled back to her front, looking her over, nodding. Her eyes seemed locked in a wide, terrified stare. He took her hands in his and rubbed circles on the backs with his thumbs.
“Well, possibly the easiest way to fuck it up is for one of us to deliberately sabotage it,” Castiel said with an arched brow.  “How about we try working together to make a successful marriage?  Do you think you might be able to give that a try?”
“You wouldn’t have done without running it by me first,” he reminded her.  “Not if you plan to maintain your position.”
“We need to pull the sex workers out of the back allies, train them responsibly, and put them in clean, safe rooms - provide a place where people can manage their Ruts and Heats with professional care.  We need legislation to protect us from the fear and ignorance of the larger population.  We need sanctuaries where any Lupin can seek respite, get a scene, have a good hard spanking, whatever they need.  Can you imagine a world where Omega Submissives can have successful professional careers?  What if we find a way to keep them balanced all the time?  Wouldn’t they be as capable of leading fulfilling adult lives as the rest of us?
“Rule Eight is a bitch, sir,” he murmured. “You get to do anything, and none of the rest of us can say shit about it. Michael’s going to blow a gasket.”
Charlie had been regaling him with a story of her latest conquest, a beta from the History department of KU, and throwing her usual impertinent tone across the affair as only Charlie could.  Castiel laughed in all the appropriate places.
Michael rolled onto his hip and reached for her, burying his face in her belly.  “I almost lost you today, Pete,” he whined.
April clenched her eyes and her channel, and he hissed at her in disapproval, fucking harder to increase the challenge.
“True, but it’s not about the verdict for Michael.  It’s about witnessing that it’s more than just Omegas taking this shit seriously.  I want him to see the full courtroom and all the people lined up behind the Omega to see those assholes prosecuted to the full extent of the law.  I want him to see that it’s not only Lupins fighting.  It’s all of us together.  And I want him to get the chance to put human faces to the nightmare figures in his head.  Seeing those guys for real is gonna suck, but it’ll also demystify them in his dreams.  They aren’t monsters for real, Cas.  They’re just people.  Shitty people, but…just people.  There’s a limit to their reach, and he needs to see that.”
I will make you sorry you ever tied yourself to me. If you ever put someone’s safety at risk that way again, you can kiss your musical career goodbye. You won’t be leaving this room.”
“I don’t know what she’s told you, but you need to know what’s in the report.  I suggest you talk to your mate and read the report both.  I have a copy here that you may borrow.  I’m sure I don’t need to remind you that it’s confidential.  You can share its contents with your mate and talk it over with her.  Please return it to me when you’ve finished and don’t make any copies.”  Cas dug a folder out of one of his files and handed it to Sam.  Sam stared at the folder like it was a snake about to strike.
“But there was a little boy in there, and a crazy, glowing masochist, and they wanted such different things.  Don’t tell me I didn’t see that, Sir.”
April sighed heavily.  She looked out the window.  Her mate was angry in a way that he would use to foster a strengthening of their bond.  She could feel him gathering himself to throw down fiercely.  She could feel him even from without, merely from the tension in the car.  April found the tension erotic.  She felt her wolf respond and take her body with it.  But April was mad, too.  How dare he call her down for keeping a part of her prior life private?  He owned who she was now, but he didn’t own her past.
Kate sat on one of the stools at the island, near the pups, mute and awkward. The Pack left her her space.
“Good boy.  Let’s see if you can do it.  Stay in place, don’t flatten.  You can’t rut against the bed.  Michael’s orders.”
“Mark sent you these instructions.”  Matt passed the pages across the table, and April stifled her nerves as she took what looked to be a mountain of tightly-spaced hand-written pages.  Flipping the top page, she found they were covered on both sides.
“Dean, stop making me pull teeth and tell me straight out what you want from me.” Cas was on edge and losing his patience.
“I’m almost ready,” he grunted back, slipping the dildo out and using his thighs to press up out of his squat.  “Just wanna oil up a little more.”
“And way in the back of the anterior uterus, kinda squashed by its siblings at the moment, is number three.  We’re looking at its heart through its spine.  You see the orientation?  It’s butt up, back toward the camera, upside-down and backward.”  The tech drew a third circle and snapped another still shot.
“You know what I mean. I just…” she got much quieter, “I wish I could have that with someone. Even if I Mated, it wouldn’t be like that. I’m nearly as Sub as you are. No one’s going to want me for their fucking life partner. I’ll always just be a Sub, an ‘also ran,’ and I’m fucking jealous as hell of you and your
Dean lost himself in the kissing, and as his intentions and inhibitions fell away, his emotions came crashing over him.  He grew frantic in his need, plunging his tongue into Castiel’s mouth as if it was the last time he’d ever be allowed to taste.  Dean wasn’t in his wolf.  He wasn’t in his alpha.  Dean was still himself.  He felt his eyes fill with tears that overflowed almost as soon as he knew they were there.  His breath grew ragged as he ground his ass down on Castiel’s cock, trapping it, probably painfully, against the Alpha’s own belly.  Dean began to snuffle and whine, a cry of pent-up frustration, fear, want, need, and despair passing from his mouth into Castiel’s.
Dean blinked at the far wall, searching inside himself to catalogue all of the sensations that lingered. His body was clean and naked beneath the warm layers that Michael insisted upon using, even in summer. He felt like melted butter congealing on the countertop. He felt like he might collapse if he tried to walk himself to the bathroom. He felt amazing.
“Because what I want is equity and hope for all of us. I can’t fight fairly. I’ll lose if I do. Feel free to step out of the limelight whenever you like, Dean. I didn’t coerce you to join. You begged me to bring you in. I don’t use people who don’t want in. I don’t
“I made dinner,” Michael announced with only his head poking through the doorway.  “It probably sucks, but it won’t kill you.  It’s a chef’s salad kinda thing.  You wanna eat out here?” He hung awkwardly off the doorframe, clearly trying to avoid presenting his whole self.  “I can’t find Dean.”  Everything about Michael screamed tension and confrontation.  He was stress in physical form, but he had it contained.
Cas let the silence lengthen while Sarah chewed on it. She bit her lip. He cleared his throat and touched his own lower lip with a significant look. She released her tortured lip and straightened her shoulders.
Some time later, after an unfortunate line of crushed stalks had taken killing blows, papers had scattered to rest here and there against stalks that remained staunchly defiant, and both men nursed wounds they hadn’t started with, they lay side-by-side in the dirt, panting, covered with grime and sticky fluids of various origins.  Michael touched the broken skin on his shoulder carefully.  Now that it was opened again, even a simple touch made his groin tingle.
Cas leaned forward. “Alternatively, talk to me more often, and I’ll make accommodations for your plans. We were working together seamlessly before April pulled her latest stunt and threw all of us into scrambling. Let’s attempt to upright the hull and find our center again. Are you with me?”
“Fuck you, Winchester,” Michael muttered. “I’m so glad you’re in chastity right now. I want you to fucking suffer.”
“You’re not a bitch, Pete.  I don’t want to hear that again.  And the scheming… Tell me what else you scheme about.  Is it hurtful?  Is it mean-spirited?”  Their faces were very close together.  Her eyes blinked miserably not four inches from his.
And the truth was, as Dean stood transfixed by the weight of blue eyes tinged with crimson, he didn’t.  He most decidedly didn’t have anywhere on Earth better to be than right here.  The simplicity of the connection between their eyes affected an instant supplication from Dean, whose instincts kicked in, flushed his body with pleasure at the thought of groveling naked on his back on the marble floor and hoisting his knees high in the air to present himself to his master.  His face flushed.  His fingertips tingled.
“Get in the shower, Dean.  If you don’t want an ice pack, I’m afraid you need to wait it out the hard way.”
“Shut up.”  He closed her out of his mind.  He knew it was the truth.  He couldn’t give Dean that, but he didn’t want to hear it from this weak, subservient child.  He pulled himself up, told her not to move, and went digging in the kitchen for tools to clean up the broken ceramic and food so her bare feet wouldn’t be at risk of getting cut.  He carried her to the kitchen table, served her a new plate of food, and petted her head before he could stop himself.
Dean stepped up, taking Michael’s focus again.  “They want to ask you questions about what it feels like when you do all the weird shit you do,” he admitted.  “They think it would help to understand how much thought you put into it versus you doing it all on instinct.”
He was beautiful like his father. He was a spitting image in energy and carriage, in charisma, if not in appearance. He looked more like that wretched tramp John Mated. But Dean had the same light in his eyes as John, the same fervor in his speech. He was irreverent and kind to a fault, and she hated him with her very being. He had attached himself like a leech to her son, and he wouldn’t shake free. What Naomi had been denied for reasons of breeding and expectation, Castiel won without even lifting a finger, and then he’d invited her into her own house, the house that had been hers, that had been Zachariah’s, to flaunt in her face everything she’d lost.
He did many times.  Soon she was mewling like a feline, and he was desperate to sink into her.  Where had that damned condom wandered off to?  Michael pulled up onto his knees and searched the bed frantically.  April sat up too and applied her lips and teeth to his left nipple.
.  It’s weird, but I’m actually feeling kinda good about it all right now.  This morning at your knee really helped, Cas.  I still feel like shit, and I can’t stop heaving my guts up, but there’s a calmness I don’t remember feeling before.  I’m watching the tide roll in, and there’s this massive fucking wave sweeping in to drown me, and I’m just, like, laying out on the beach watching it curl up and over me.  It’s fucking epic.”
“…And he just happens to be ‘The Chosen One’ of prophecy who can wield the great sword and save us all from Perdition, and dragons, and whatever,” Dean mumbled again testily.
“Ah,” Dean added.  He’d noticed the same worrisome behavior.  He had vowed to give Michael some time to get it out of his system, but eventually, he knew, someone would have to steer Michael onto a different track.  His savior complex was not going to be good for Kate.  It didn’t help that April had chosen to deliver the message in a patronizing lecture.
He moaned in relaxed pleasure in the hot water, holding his sister close to his chest for comfort while Cas massaged firm fingers into the muscles around his entrance.  The cramping was intense, but he’d experienced worse.  There had been no tearing, despite the absurd stretch.  He was so loose, even Cas’ knot didn’t really lock.
“That actually makes some sense.  Michael’s hot-headed, although I’ve never seen anything like that outta him before.  But…a Dominant?  He’s Omega.  There’s no such thing.  Is there?”
“It’s your own fault, Sharice. You’re the one who said no when every molecule in your body wanted to say yes.”
“Nice party, Alpha,” Monica told him quietly, leaning in on his right.  Cas smiled, his eyes misting and never leaving his brother.
Jo turned her by her shoulders and glowered down. “No, April. It’s not like that here. Step back a minute and look around you. It’s not like that.” Jo spoke slowly and deliberately. She was steadfast, bordering on angry. “You’ve met my mother. You think she didn’t hear her share of ‘no’? You think she let any alpha stop her? She had shithead alphas try to block her every step of the way, including her own mate a time or two, but she’s not playing games. Never was. It was
Dean complied, and he looked back over his own shoulder as well.  Cas held onto his wrist and turned him back and forth a little, to check both hips.
Sam hit the top limit for the level he was assigned to deliver, hit it with regret.  He felt like a few more wouldn’t hurt.  Maybe an exclamation point to the essay he wrote across her ass might make all the difference.  But that wasn’t his call either, and this one had Castiel’s name on the form.  Cas wasn’t one to go easy on a repeat offender.  If he’d assigned less than Sam would have, there was a reason.  Sam was in no position to challenge the Alpha’s directive.
Helene opened her mouth to reply and then snapped it closed again. But she tried again. “It’s a scary world out there, Billie.”
Bela watched him pace down the length of the room, all energy and nerves, ready to pounce on any unsuspecting waif stupid enough to poke its head up. Bela wasn’t stupid, so she watched him without comment. They’d been here for some time already, and Crowley’s tension wasn’t improving. Bela couldn’t help comparing his style with Victor’s. Where Victor was warm smooth honey, Crowley was a spikey cactus. Only Bela’s eyes moved as she tracked his pacing.
With his legs freed, Cain kicked out, landing a couple of vicious kicks.  He couldn’t see through the press of bodies, but he heard the screams.  Someone was down.  The bench cleared, and it was a melee.
“I’m so glad we did it. I never would’ve thought of it. I guess if I knew what was coming, it wouldn’t have had the punch it did. I thought you were gone. Thought you’d slipped out, but… then, I mean, it all flowed over me like a waterfall, how much you’ve done for me, how much you’ve proven you love me, everything you’ve sacrificed for me. Suddenly, the idea that you would abandon me right in the middle of a scene… It was laughable, and I just knew. I could even picture you there. Just sitting on the floor listening to me work it out.” Dean huffed a laugh at his own frailty. “You’ve never left me in your life. Why would that start now?”
“Yet, you still named your mother as a member of the new Pack, is that correct?  …Even though she’s turned some amazingly vicious turns of phrase your way in the last few weeks?”
“Not really. I mean, we planned to do it eventually, or try at least, but we never meant to have it happen like that; spur of the moment. I wasn’t in trouble for doing it, just for doing it when I did. I was already in chastity.”
your entire life. Get on the goddamn phone to Frank Devereaux and find Baby a new trunk bonnet. And stop feeling sorry for yourself before I have to wail it out of you.”
Dean scoffed.  “Of course I’ll be all right.  You go on and do the big Alpha thing.  Enjoy yourselves.  Don’t worry about me.  I’ll probably spend the whole weekend laying around in bed, recuperating.”
The girl’s first orgasm brought with it a powerful Release from her Omega gland, the concussion visible to everyone watching and spiking the instruments under Ellen’s care.  The second flooded her neocortex and her adrenal glands as the Claim landed.  Wave after wave of hormone release reached out into the room and grabbed onto Sam’s as her conscious mind let go of all intent.  The bond struck between them, and they both gasped, shocked at the recoil.  Sam redoubled his efforts, rushing to completion.
Dean snorted. “He’s gotten one word out so far, Papa. Give him a minute before you register him for Debate Club.”
Michael screamed and pushed back harder into Dean’s grip. The skin broke. Blood leaked down to join the flow of slick. “FUCK ME! GOD, PLEASE!” Michael humped himself backward, all control abandoned. How the fuck was Dean still holding out when Michael, not yet fully lost in Heat, was losing it this badly? Michael’s back was drenched with sweat. Dean lifted onto his knees again and ran a strong hand across the wet muscles of Michael’s back.
“Fine, then.  You think I’m stalling.  All right.  Go ahead.  Lay it on me.”  The Alpha’s posture communicated immovability.  His face was flat and set.  He’d already made up his mind.  Well, so had Dean.
Dean rolled his eyes and turned again to walk beside his husband. He pulled in close with an arm around Cas’ neck so he could whisper in the man’s ear. “Just think, C.J. All those
“Christ, what next?” wondered Michael, sinking back into the short loveseat. He’d lost track and couldn’t recall anything else being on the schedule for today.
Michael pulled up onto an elbow and took in Dean’s supple form. He was in amazing shape for a guy who admittedly avoided exercise and drank a substantial amount of beer.
“It’s fine, Charlie. This is not my first rodeo. I did contract scening for the county for years. I can handle dick. It’s just not my thing in private.” Charlie nodded.
Cas smiled into Alex’s baby-scented hair. He loved Dean when he was furious at the world. He loved even more taking Dean by the bridle and letting him rage against the hold, kicking up dust and sweat in a desperate attempt to break free, only to flay him until the whites of his eyes rolled, and he fell still, heaving and panting, head low and withers trembling, to stand shaking in submission before his Alpha.
Castiel smirked as he read the title.  Finding a way to motivate Dean had never been difficult.  Cas mentally added, ‘Need to choreograph a foursome’ to his To Do list and began to review the report.
Dean nodded with wide eyes, still pretending he had a gag in. Fuck, a gag would be helpful. He wanted to sass the shit outta this guy. He wanted to know what he could push him into.
Sarah picked the baggie up and flushed.  “Yes, they are.  But they aren’t illicit, Dean.  I have a prescription.”
The sounds from the enlarging audience were getting louder, and the pheromone wash began to do its thing. So many excited people in one place built up in the air until it took them all into a new place. In battle, the phenomenon made wolves slavering brutes who slaughtered everything that wasn’t Pack. In celebrations, it led to a frenzy of giddiness and bliss. This environment, this sensation, would always be one of Dean’s favorites. Inhibitions fell away, but it wasn’t a passionate—well, not a sexual—feeling. It felt like the safest, most accepting version of pack-life. Everyone was family, and when they chorused together, they were ancient wolves howling their
He shushed her firmly, and pressed into her body with deliberate callous indifference to the sore heat his body reawakened.  She panted and struggled for a hold against the smooth wood, but he denied her any kind of grasp.  The Alpha pulled her arms behind her to catch both wrists with a single hand, and he clutched her hip with his other hand.  She was too short for the piano, and her feet lifted free of the ground with the force of his thrusts, leaving her nothing to brace against and no means to catch her rocking motion as he forced her again and again into the hard mahogany edge.  But as ever, April’s wolf reveled in the abuse, and she found the ground beneath her feet metaphorically in the sense that she was precisely where and how she ought to be, and she was safe in his hands, impaled on his body.
Gabriel sat next to her on the bench and she scooted to make room, wincing at what it did to the flesh on her butt.  Gabriel noticed.  “What’d you do to earn that one?”
“Ya know, for a guy who was dead set against this whole baby plan, you sure have that look like Christmas came early,” Dean mused.
Guys!  Finally!  After twenty-something chapters, we finally have a Pack!  I'm shouting aren't I?  Sorry.  Bit excited.
“Yeah,” agreed Dean solemnly.  There was no getting around that one.  Castiel was going to be furious.
Sarah was finished with all of her pre-employment screenings. She hadn’t even flinched at letting a Lupin doctor run as thorough a physical on her as would be done for a sexually-permitted Keller tester. She hadn’t flinched once. Billie admitted she was impressed. The girl had grit. Cas had drawn the line at sexual contact. Sarah wasn’t a wolf and touching her was assault. Billie understood, but that hadn’t stopped her from playing devil’s advocate. How better to let Ms. Blake experience what it was like to work here as a wolf than to let her really experience it? Cas reminded Billie that that wasn’t within the scope of her dissertation. She was here to observe, not to participate. Billie’s smirk showed him she was merely testing the boundaries. She wasn’t going to do anything to Sarah outside the limits, but she wanted those limits very clear before they started.
“That’s a holdover from when this room was a den, of sorts.  I don’t really use the bar, but I can’t keep Fred from stocking it.  I guess he figures, where there’s a bar, there should be booze.”  Cas moved deeper into the room and kept talking.  “It might be fun to hold parties in here at some point.  If you ever wanted to play exhibitionist games with me, we could invite guests to watch us demonstrate your skills at control.  They would be free to make use of the bar since no one but me will be touching you under our scening contract.”
Cain continued to stare at the Alpha until Cas sighed. “Yes, of course she knows. I explained everything. This challenge changes nothing for her except the guarantee that she will receive your best efforts. That is, unless any of you intend to throw the challenge.”
“He’s just a pup, and you’re shouting loud enough to frighten him.  Please lower your voice and just talk to me.  What did I do that was so wrong?”
Gabriel frowned and growled.  Fury mingled with grief in his eyes, and he grabbed her shoulder.  “I’m not
Dean sat up, leaned far forward and plucked a grassy weed that he began to slowly strip into separate strands.  “I tell myself that I’ve got a Dom who is so good at what he does, that I’m safe to put it all in his hands.  I don’t ever even consider the idea.”
Sam, Jess, and Cas arrived at the house just a little later than expected. They were tired but glowing as Sam and Jess each carried a car seat through the garage entrance and into the kitchen. Cas followed, burdened beneath the luggage, and looking rumpled in his UNLV sweats. If he hadn’t been wearing that ridiculous get-up with a blazing white pair of brand-new sneakers, they wouldn’t have noticed him at all for their fixation on the pups. As it was, each of them stifled their comments better than they did their smirks. Michael got to the babies first. He completely forgot to greet J.T.’s parents as he swooped in and stole the carrier from Sam with a grin. Michael had the wide-eyed pup out of his fastenings before the seat even stopped rocking on the countertop and was talking happily to him, ignoring everyone else.
Michael knew Dean hadn’t managed to sleep at all when the alpha woke him with a demanding nudge from a persistent hard-on along the cleft of his ass.  They were alone in their own room, Dean spooned up close behind Michael in the wee hours of the morning.  Dean would need to be up and away in an hour or so.  There was time for the mates to knot before that.  Michael hummed and pressed his ass backward in agreement.  One more knotting before his mate flew out for the week sounded like just the thing to Michael.
April and Dean scrambled, standing side by side.  Michael sauntered, frowning.  He couldn’t figure out what he was doing, but he couldn’t stop doing it now that he’d started.  It had been weeks since Michael felt a need to poke at the Alpha’s authority.  He wasn’t interested in fucking April.  She was a mosquito buzzing around his head, always looking for a stroke from him, a gentle touch, needing him to fetch her something or take care of something.  His wolf had taken her in at sight.  She was Pack, and that meant she was his to care for, but Michael hadn’t even considered pursuing her.  It wasn’t because she was Castiel’s, he told himself.  It was because she wasn’t his type at all.  She was submissive enough, but so milk toast compliant that she made him vaguely nauseated.  Michael faced the wall beside Dean, avoiding the probing nudges from his mate through the bonds.  He hadn’t even told Dean about Topping Raphael yet.
to know. I have a responsibility to protect you, and we’re all going to have to answer questions soon. They’re coming, Dean, and now your plausible deniability is fucked. Besides…” he tossed the last of his crust onto the lawn where the ducks would eventually find it. “I didn’t know how to tell you anyway.”
Castiel pulled out before his knot caught and stroked himself quickly to orgasm.  His come shot across Victor’s ruined ass, up his back and all over the back of his torn shirt.  “Do not change your shirt until you return home tonight.  What you’ve allowed to occur here is a
“You said it’s private, but you were never private about your friendship with him.  You’ve been best friends for years.  You never tried to keep your relationship as scening partners private. According to our records, neither of you ever slept with anyone but each other outside of work.  So, what’s private about it Castiel?”
a terrific father, and Dean was feeling decidedly peaceful toward Sam even as his backside still throbbed. He felt Michael exploring that emotion in his head and shrugged at his mate. Michael chuckled at Dean’s expense and kissed him chastely before calling pups to their seats at the table.
“I told you, Alpha,” Dean said with his eyes glistening with fervor, and his hands pulled high to stroke the soft dark strands of Castiel’s freshly washed hair. “I love you exactly as you are. I love that you try like hell to make a space for everyone that honors their humanity. I love that you are unapologetically powerful, that you found a way to marry a nurturer with a Viking, and you look at every day as a new chance to make something new and great in the world that’s never been there before, that you drag the rest of us along into that new vista with you. I love that you’re a
“Dean, I don’t want to play like that.  I’m not as good at this as he is.  I can’t keep doing this without knowing you’re watching out too.  I can’t.”
“Alex left!” he tattled.  “He was sposed to stay, but he left!  Kat said he was gonna get a spankin when you and Daddy came home.”
“You’re not a broken alpha, Dean Michael. You’re the best possible mix of all of us. You’re strong and vulnerable at the same time. You’re powerful and charming and you know how to drop all the walls in your head and let it all flow into someone else’s hands for a while. You’re smart and you’re instinctive all at once. That sense you have going on in there, the one that compels you to show no weakness, it’s losing its grip because we’re proving it wrong every day. And now it’s getting desperate the same way a cornered dog does, and it’s throwing everything it has at you just the way it’s hitting the fan outside our doors. You gotta weather the last throes of a dying instinct. We’re going to fight this war out there and in here all at once, but no one does it alone. Stand firm just a little while longer. Do something radical right in its face, and silence it for good. Put me on stage. Stand beside me and be there to watch over me, but let me do this, alpha. Please. For both of us. For
“Maybe she could wear a bell,” Kali suggested, leading an unsteady April from the room.  “That way we could hear her coming and scuttle Dean out of the room.”
Castiel’s blue eyes held Dean’s green ones.  He let no softness through.  He stripped slowly, never breaking their gaze.  He could nearly
“Baby, it’s not what I meant at all. It slipped out. I’m not ever going to walk away from you. Please. I need you to understand…”
“All right, Alpha,” she told him, speaking only to him.  “A manager.”  But she was quick to follow up, and her confidence grew as she pulled from that deep reserve.  “I still need the lessons though, and I’m NOT ready to try to perform except for small things…Pack things…like the Conventions.  That was fun.”
“Oh, well.  I’m just a boring ol’ O-Neutral, not some exotic outlier like you people.  I’ll be surprised if you don’t burn the frikken’ house down within a year between the four of you.”
“Are you certain about this, Dean?” Castiel asked, entering the parlor and mirroring Sam’s question.  He had obviously overheard enough of the conversation to know what they were discussing.  Dean suppressed the desire to roll his eyes.
Michael mumbled something that got lost on its way out. His fist closed around his dick, moistened by his own slick, and he stroked slowly, already revved.
“Thank you,” said Cas, pushing off the wall and striding purposefully toward the street without a backward glance.  The young Omega sat hunched over on the curb with a concerned medic wrapping a blanket over her shoulders.  When Castiel and Benny emerged from the alley, she launched herself at the Alpha.  He caught her gently and allowed her to nestle beneath his chin.  His arms wrapped around her.  He stopped walking and went still and solid.
The Alpha stared at Castiel as if he’d grown a third head.  “Married?!  How the FUCK am I going to explain this to Michael while he’s lost in his wolf and jacking off all over a Texas State Trooper’s back seat?!”  He looked at Castiel for another moment or two, but Cas had no advice for him.  Eventually the Alpha blew out a breath, swore vehemently under his breath and spun on his heel to return to his own car.  He twirled his finger in the air over his head in a
“He doesn’t trust me, Michael. I don’t know what to do about that.” Cas still wasn’t turning to face the Omega.
“Cchh!” Dean protested, giving Michael the stink eye.  “Not my first rodeo!  You’re looking at a professional here, baby!”  Michael smirked at him, lying on his side with his torso propped up on an elbow.
“Manipulating people is unkind at the very least,” he told her.  “I want you to be straight with her.  You did well today.  You needed help, and that’s fine, but you spoke to her out front, not through manipulative tactics.  Keep doing that.  Consistency is the key, April.  Matt and Mark will back you up.  Maybe call a business meeting where the three of you all work to explain it to her together.  She may be pushy, but you’re more stubborn, and you don’t owe her your submission.  Don’t give in to her.  It’s not her career.  It’s yours.  In your relationship with her, you are not an Omega.  You are not a Submissive.  You are the boss.  You are
“I know not all stories have a happy ending, but when you’re Omega, and you worry every moment of every day that something like that can happen to you no matter how much protection you seem to have at any given time…I just wasn’t expecting to have it thrown in my face like that during a night on the town.  That’s all.”  She couldn’t help her tone of resentment.
until April took a crack at it. I’ve got three other pieces I want her to look at. Fuck it all, Cas, she’s the only one who’ll tell me the truth!”
Cas tilted Dean’s head with a hand at his chin and kissed him sweetly. “Well, he can at least put it use right now while April is shaken. She wants nothing to do with me at the moment. How’s that for convenient?” Cas scowled at his own whiny stream of consciousness. “Dean, I know you’re scared. I know you’re angry. I would not have chosen this timing or this outcome. But what’s happened, as disturbing as it is, is a gift, and we cannot ignore it. I need you to stop running through endless ‘what if’s’ and focus on the magnificence that is your mate. Look what he did! With no firearms, no serious injuries, no D.F’s, and no hesitation whatsoever, he halted a riot and rescued two people from certain torture, two people he loves with his very soul. He turned the tide of a movement that had been gaining steam for five years, leaving it broken and rudderless. He stood toe-to-toe with a sea of Alpha-Dominants and proved that he holds more presence in his bearing than any of them, even cumulatively. And this was not a laboratory setting. None of those people were obligated to comply for evaluative purposes. They knelt to Michael because he
April stood in the middle the lavish hotel room stark naked and staring out the window, eyes vacant.
“This is where you can show you trust me, Castiel.”  Dean rubbed his hands up and down his fiancé’s thighs.
“She’s a perfect match for him, Sir,” the beta said darkly as they entered the cool shade of his garage.  “Better than his mate.”
assistant instead of hearing it early enough to stop it at its roots from you. That will be all. Thank you for adjusting the agenda and tomorrow’s appointments. In future, Billie is correct. I do not require a confirmation in person that you’ve completed assigned tasks. I don’t require confirmation at all, for that matter. Please just do as I ask.”
“Shoes off.  Socks off.  Shirts off.  Pants off.   I want all of you in nothing but your underwear.”  April and Dean both blushed and dropped their pants to reveal neither was wearing any underwear.  Cas shook his head at the two peas-in-a-pod.  Michael noticed too, and he rolled his eyes.
Castiel stood for a long time without answering. He looked out at the tree line and watched the sun sinking low toward the horizon. When he spoke, his voice was carefully tempered to hide his internal struggle. “It’s not who I want to be, Dean. I let him take over for just the few minutes it took for me to say yes, but that’s all he needed, and now I have to live with it.”
“Yeah.  I know.  It hurts.  I keep going over it in my mind, wondering if… No.  No, you’re right.  Thanks, Dean.”
A tear tracked slowly down the side of Michael’s face to stop in his hair.  He reached up and wiped his nose with his hand.  “Fuck!  FUCK!  Why does it still hurt so bad?  I thought I was over this crap.”
“At the loss of his father, Zachariah turned even more deeply inward.  He was never overtly unkind, that I saw, but he was cold.  His business sense and his need for order commanded most of his attention.  And his mother was still Alpha, of course, but Zachariah took over most of the Pack business, day to day.  He promoted me to Head Butler, and he assumed control of the various business initiatives.  He left Naomi to her own devices, which mostly meant making social connections and planning parties that neither Gertrude nor Zachariah attended more than they had to.”
“I wasn’t here when she was dumped by her own staff on the Gatehouse steps. Gabriel took her in, Dean. He’s sitting in there watching over her despite everything she’s ever done to him.”
Castiel stood behind them and took them both in.  No bruises marred either of their bodies except where their Mating had gotten rough.  Both had managed to go days without a punishment, and Cas wondered if maybe that was the reason they’d made the attempt they did.  Travel was stressful for them both.  He probably should have eased that strain before leaving for the airport.
“Jesus, Michael, you already know. You read me like a fucking roadmap. Why do you need me to say it?”
Dean let his disbelief that the Alpha wanted to talk strategy while still sweaty and tied show on his face.  But he humored the man.  “Two more years before you transition to the Foundational board, Cas.  You’re not abandoning us.  We can do a lot in two years.  And I’m telling you, it’s all in motion.  You don’t see the difference yet, but everything is picking up steam.  When shit starts clicking, it’s going to go fast.  You’ll see.  Trust me.  We’re right where we’re supposed to be.”  Dean stole another kiss.  Cas’ hand was warm on his back.  He crooked a half smile down at his Alpha, earning a half-smile back.
“Well, we’re changing his assignments.  He’s not responsible for his schedule anymore.  Jody will be setting his hours for him and escorting him until we’re sure what he can handle.  Sam’s agreed to tutor him an hour in the morning three times a week.  It’s a little cave to his crush, but Sam says it’s something he can handle.  The kid needs a break, you know?  Where are we going?”  Dean finally looked around and noticed they weren’t on their way home.
Also, with the new restriction listed in his file formally, Dean would be reclassified through the medical guidelines as a non-participant in sexual activities, changing his turnstile entrance matrix from Class A to Class C.  The kiosk sensors wouldn’t need to even scan his urine for birth control at all anymore.  It was a brilliant plan to keep their subterfuge under wraps.  They didn’t know the cat was already out of the bag.  Cas was even impressed that they’d thought to try to move Michael’s Keller up to take advantage of the lingering hormonal birth control before it flushed out of the Omega’s body entirely.  It hadn’t worked.  Ellen didn’t know the reason for the request, so she hadn’t tried very hard to reschedule.
Charlie finished positioning her – belly down, resting on her shoulders, ass up, face pressed into the bedding, feet spread wide.  She was a perfectly presented gift, and her mate should zero in on her ass as soon as he entered the room.  The Omega writhed and moaned, turning her head to one side.  “Hurts, Charlie,” she complained.  “Everything’s on fire…please. I need…”
sees it differently. You gotta rein this shit in, Alpha, or we’re going to lose everything.” Dean finally made eye contact again.
“NO, Gabriel!  You don’t deserve it!”  She pulled her fingers back out of his channel and left 10 or 15 hot handprints on his ass before sinking them back in again and picking up the pace on his prick.  He whined and moaned, bucking into her hand and very nearly weeping in both frustration and supreme, sublime satisfaction.
“I spoke to his wolf last night, beta. It addressed me directly and challenged me. I got a read on it.” Cas pulled up a chair and sat before the man. “We’re really not supposed to discuss adolescent Tertiaries prior to confirmation testing because science hasn’t locked down a testing method for pups yet. But this child is probably at least a seventeen. He came at me full throttle with no expectation of confronting someone higher ranked than he. That kind of cockiness is typical above fifteen. What’s more, I have a rare ability to feel the strength of a Tertiary directly. Against Michael here, he rates slightly lower. Against yours, he’s significantly higher.”
“He doesn’t react well to challenges, that’s all,” Michael replied vaguely.  He turned one tile over to start the game.  Naomi peered over her choices and flipped another.  Michael won first turn.
Dean couldn’t see.  His eyes were squeezed shut as his body took the pounding of his life, but he could sense the massive beast that had taken the reins above him.  It was untamed like nothing Dean had seen or heard of before.  He lived only in this moment, and the moment was instinct.  If he could’ve seen it, he would have seen a great canine beast, with the body of a quadruped mongrel dog, not a bipedal man working him over.  There was nothing left in that moment of anything resembling a human in either of them.  Dean, a lean grey, strong, supple, beautifully submissive wolf relinquishing control utterly to the powerfully massive and Dominant Mastiff above him.  There was nothing domesticated or domesticable about Castiel.  He was eternity. He was every canid who had ever lived, every individual Caniforme’s power added up
April froze in the act of handing Hank to Gabe and stood upright without delivering the pup. Gabe sighed and rolled his eyes. “Be right back,” he told Kali. “Don’t worry. Only Michael bites. You can take him. You’ll be fine.”  Gabe patted her leg, then stood and delivered a simple kiss to her lips. He followed his brother out the door. Dean groaned and exchanged a look with April, but he followed as well.
“Come on. Exam time. You got a medical kink, Michael? This could be fun.” Dean cut the water off and pulled Michael after him.
Stepping close enough to loom, even with his lesser height, Castiel ripped Dean’s shirt down the front and left it hanging ragged from his arms. Dean’s breath caught in his throat, but he stood his ground.
“You’re not letting him stand on his own feet, Dean! If it had been anyone else, you would have ripped into me for calling you down there for something I should be expected to handle on my own. Michael’s not the first Dominant trainee to figure out that it feels good to masturbate himself on a patient’s reaction. Most Doms do it a couple of times until they get smacked down hard and the message sinks in that it’s not harmless. He’s just the most stubborn. Damnit, alpha, he’s uncoachable. If you can’t see how that’s a problem, then we’re stuck.”
“Jack Kline,” Ketch said with feeling, and Jack’s baffled face pivoted. “You knowingly broke Rule Number Three within twenty minutes of agreeing to it. On your feet.”
Missouri capped the vial containing his cervical swab then patted the outside of his thigh. “We’re all done, sweetie. You can sit up now.”
“Fine,” Dean accepted. “But I’m coming with. Michael’s not certified yet, and he’ll need a mentor onsite.”
Cas glanced up at him in surprise. “I have no authority to hold them here,” he admitted. “But I intend to build a Pack that is difficult to walk away from, and I mean to welcome anyone who Mates an Omega  member of my Pack into the fold, even if they are a Top.”
Dean grinned.  “Oh, I do, man.  I get arguing.  I’ve just never seen the two of you go at it, that’s all.  Damn, it’s about fucking time.  I’d about given up on you guys.  I wonder if Charlie has a betting pool going?  I should’ve thought to get in on that action.”
“Excuse me,” said Dean with a quick squeeze to Kali’s shoulder.  He’d spotted Michael talking earnestly with the bar manager and tapping a paper between them on the bar with his finger.
“Naomi, is that what sent you spiraling? Grief is a powerful emotion. Grief combined with regret, for a Lupin, especially for a lone wolf, can be deadly. Answer me.” There was Alpha authority in his voice.
“He needs help,” Cas told him with all the alpha authority he could muster. “Call Doctor Singer. Tell him it’s an emergency and tell him to get here as fast as he can. I’ll be with Gabriel. Don’t tell mother. She’s inebriated and not in full capacity at the moment. I’m assuming command as Pack Alpha from this moment. Do it.” Cas’ eyes burned with fervor. “NOW!”
That's 3 long chapters in a week, close to my old pace.  Go, me!  But, alas, I'll be going dark for several weeks again.  I guess this is a cliff hanger.  I didn't mean to do that.  I just ran out of time.  Stupid clock.
“Yeah, I smell that.”  Dale was close enough to Dean to scent his recent release and to judge just how recent it had been.  “You know there’s laws against gettin’ busy on state highways.  We’ve had this discussion before, son.”
Michael sat at the head of the bed, silent after Dean snapped viciously at him over nothing for the fourth time. He wasn’t really even supposed to be here but spending the day in training while Dean mourned without him was a stretch too far, and he’d refused to go. His eyes tracked Dean from a motionless head as Jess’ did Sam. Jess sat beside Michael on the bed, their legs stretched out in front of them, crossed identically at the ankles, watching over their mates but not interfering. Jess lasted a little longer than Michael did, but of course Sam wasn’t hitting a hormonal peak that marked the onset of Rut. Still, after Sam responded to her fifth attempt to encourage him to sit and have a snack by lifting his wide flat palm before his face and inspecting it with great interest followed by a significant look into her eyes, she subsided into tacit compliance and sank down beside Michael. The brothers never snapped at each other though. They seemed to be communicating on a different plane, and wherever they were, they were there together.
“Dean, I’m sorry,” said Michael sincerely.  He reached out and touched Dean’s fingers.  Dean looked down at him and took hold of the Omega’s hand with a squeeze.
Alpha produced a spreader bar with soft cuffs at each end. He knelt and fastened a cuff to Dean’s left ankle, and then he prodded the right one far enough outward to bind it as well. Dean teetered, using his grip on the bar above his head to balance as the spread of his feet forced him onto his toes. Dean was naked and spreadeagled, powerless to protect his body. His penis hardened, standing out starkly in anticipation, at the thrill of the threat. He huffed a few deep breaths under his Dom’s judgmental eye. Alpha waited impatiently for Dean to get himself under control.
“Would you shut the fuck up?” he said, frustrated. The wolf huffed a bitter laugh. “Oh, you think that’s funny?” he turned back to her. Apparently, trying to help gets you nowhere with this bitch.
She rolled her eyes, but he couldn’t see it. “You didn’t fuck up everything, you dunce. Don’t be dramatic. I’m pissed at you though. That pillow was mine. That space is mine. You had no right to take it. If you need to be Sub at the breakfast table,
Dean hung up, released his grip on Michael and clambered toward the door to release the bolt. H/R doors locked from both sides, but the door hadn’t been locked from the outside this time. Dean stood naked in front of the door.
Also, Chapter 88 is written too.  I'll post in a few hours once I'm sure I've got myself turned round right.  I wrote them other-way-round, and now I need to go check continuity.
She sighed sadly.  “I miss you, you big dork.  It felt like I’d lost you for good.  I tried to be patient, but you were gone, man.”
Cas nodded.  “It usually only lasts a couple of days or so.  I ran a Peliomometer reading on him after he slept a little this morning, and he looks to be about back to normal.  His hormones are still a bit higher than what’s usual for him, but they’re most likely nearly leveled out by now.”
They regarded each other for moments stretching into uncomfortable tension.  “Dean,” said Michael firmly, going way out on a limb for an Omega no matter what type of pack he might be joining, “I forbid you from touching anyone but Castiel or me in any sexual manner whatsoever except for scheduled vetted Keller tests as part of a three-person panel.  Is that completely clear to you?”
“Because she’s Pack, despite everything, and she needs to meet our new mates.  Besides, it’s been a very long time since we’ve seen each other privately, and I’d like a chance to speak with her.”
“You’re telling me. Remember the time we got caught sneaking Jell-O into the bathtub in the prep room because we wanted to see what a Jell-O bath felt like, and Benny lined us up side-by-side to beat both our asses? Fuck, you can take a hit. That was awesome.”
know?  What’s he going to do when he figures it out?  Do I get to keep that side of me, or is he going to tell me it’s too dangerous for an Ozzie to wield that much control?  What if it
The building went up in a flash that sent a shockwave across the Oklahoma landscape where residents of the nearby suburbs felt it shake them in their beds.  They thought it was an earthquake at first.
“Is this scene exclusionary?” asked Michael, using a term someone had told him once meant that the Bottoms weren’t allowed any action that wasn’t instructed. He had no illusions that he was Bottoming to Cas’ Top, but he didn’t want to misunderstand. Castiel ignoring his strokes indicated he had a lot of freedom, but, well, misinterpretations were always more painful for the Bottom than the Top.
Omega, but I’ve always resisted doing that.  It seemed counterproductive.  But your song grabbed hold of me and put me square into it no matter what I wanted, and it really opened my eyes.  Thank you for that.”
“You don’t ever have to see her again. I’ve been thinking about it, and you’re right. I’m through trying to make her family. I’m done, and she’s out. I’ll strike her name from the Pack roster. She doesn’t need it, and she’s certainly not earned it. Will that help? You’re so much more important to me than my mother ever was. I can walk away from her and never look back, and never even miss it.”
Dean put the car in park, but they both sat still and silent. The morning sun had broken over the horizon behind them. Neither of them seemed willing to break the silence. It had been too short a weekend, and so much drama made both of them feel squeezed through a wring-dryer. Finally, Dean took a deep breath and looked at his mate across the bench. “Still sticking with
first. Nothing’s going to make any sense between us until we stop everything and deal with what’s burning a hole through your gut. It’s going to poison us if we don’t. I’m ripe, and I’m ready, and I want to give you a family. The Universe didn’t give me to you young by mistake, Alpha. This comes first. It has too.”
Michael’s eyes widened, and he blushed. “Oh! Shit! I’m sorry, Alpha. It just came out. I should have asked. I can call him back.”
Still, Dean’s voice was silty and raspy with exhaustion.  Given a few more minutes, he would likely be snoring.  And that made it that much more concerning to hear him initiate a new conversation now, when he was so close to dropping off.
Dean leaned in as close as he could to Michael’s ear. “You can tell me anything, Michael. Don’t hide yourself from me.”
Michael stopped walking and looked at him.  “I don’t know yet.  I need to think.  If I’m right, then maybe I’ve already got a third of him on my side.  If I’m wrong, then I can’t make heads or tails of it.”
“It’s a burner,” she told him, matching his volume, noting that the hubbub was dying down. People were scattering with their first-hand news. “I’ll dump it. I’m sure he’s going to start pointing fingers, but none of us have done anything wrong other than not pledging him our undying loyalty.” She opened her eyes and smirked at him where he stood draped over the cubicle wall, leaning on his arms, staring at her.
She stared at him for a moment, a glare hard enough to make Michael wonder if she might be an Omega-Dom herself. “All right. So. This poor girl is in bad shape. She’s sedated for the moment, but the drugs are going to wear off in a few minutes. You see her shoulder? She’s been bitten. Mated against her will. If I caught the story right, it was her own Pack Alpha who did it, and the patient wants no part of a Mating with a woman forty years her senior and way past her prime. She was screaming bloody murder to be taken somewhere that woman couldn’t touch her, and had to be sedated for her own safety. None of that’s going to help when she wakes up still in the middle of her first mature Heat. You going to be able to handle all that, Michael? We’re not going to have to scrape you off the floor, are we?”
“Yeah, cause it scared the shit outta me, Michael!  I felt like a fuckin’ moron, sitting there thinking how much it sucked that I had to suffer through being so far away that you were just a blip in my head.  I felt like a fool, and I was pissed off that you did it on purpose.  But then I took a breath and looked around, counted all the variables, assessed the fuckin’ situation, and I realized I was more to blame than you.  I
“No.  He said I could text him all I wanted, and that he and Michael would be around.  It didn’t sound like he was taking them to ground, exactly.”
“Uh,” Cole said shrewdly.  He balked for just a moment, then produced the paddle and laid it, handle first, in Benny’s outstretched hand.  Benny’s smirk deepened to smugness.  He silently congratulated himself on killing two birds with one stone.
