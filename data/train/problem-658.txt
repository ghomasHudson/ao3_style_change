Sherlock and Jo showed up in Mycroft’s office at the Diogenes Club, unannounced, a few days later. Mycroft had obviously been expecting them, if the tea service and tray of biscuits sitting on his desk were any indication.
‘Finished in your mind palace?’ John asked, not daring to raise his voice more to break the quiet peace the flat had fallen into.
Sherlock pulled back only enough to look him in the eye. ‘You did. You took care of me like you always do.’ His eyes were sparkling in the lights above. John felt tears well up in his throat.
Sherlock’s baritone broke through the cloud of unwelcome thoughts and brought him back to the present. His friend was watching him carefully, a slight lift in his left eyebrow told John how worried he actually was, even though the rest of his face remained passive.
There was a smattering of chuckles before the entire squad burst into chaos. Some cheered, but most turned to another officer to demand money (including Greg).
Oh. Well, then. John nodded and turned to get them both tea, hiding the biggest smile on his face. That was the closest Sherlock had come to the ‘l’ word, with anyone. Everyone knew he prided himself on his brain more than anything else and knowing the simple act of kissing John would give Sherlock that electric shock needed to think clearer again, John would wear that badge with pride.
John watched him talk with a smile. It was always fun to watch that brilliant mind at work, and, now that Sherlock had put effort into educating rather than condescension, the others were beginning to appreciate it more.
‘You were right to think this was linked to the recent kidnappings.’ Sherlock started, his eyes still darting over the body. ‘But I don’t think it is the same person.’
Donovon was standing by the crime scene tape, fanning herself with her hand. She had mellowed a lot since Sherlock’s return, refraining from insulting digs most of the time. Of course, she liked to keep up the facade when Sherlock was around. John had an inkling they both enjoyed it too much to stop.
John smiled, turning away to try and hide it. He had noticed, throughout his time with Sherlock, his part in his mind palace growing. Sherlock didn’t mention it unless it was brought up and didn’t see anything wrong or worth mentioning, but to John it was a lot. He had started with a room, which had then upgraded to quarters, then an entire wing. Now, knowing that half of Sherlock’s mind was taken up with him and Rosie made a part of his heart flutter. Sherlock was a softie, regardless of how much he denied it.
‘Wait, the night you went for Chinese was the night you got together?’ Greg asked incredulously. ‘And you didn’t bother letting me know this has been going on for a month?’
Apart from the increase in touching and light kisses, nothing else really changed in the first week. Sherlock continued to work on his case and look after Rosie when John was too tired. He would make John a cup of tea every morning, and have it waiting for him when he came downstairs, often already having fed Rosie and had lulled her back to sleep with the use of his violin.
John gave her a wave, checked once more on his sleeping daughter, and followed his friend from the flat.
Sherlock gave him the look he usually reserved for when people were being stupid. It was only with good grace that he didn’t roll his eyes.
A twinge of pink appeared on Sherlock’s cheeks and he looked away, picking up his glass and swirling the wine in it. ‘Maybe.’
‘Donovon, if you carry on making obvious deductions like that, you’ll make detective by next year.’ Sherlock said as casually as he could, taking a sip of his beer.
John reached over and took one of Sherlock’s hands, giving it a squeeze. The detective looked up and John seized an opportunity and leaned forward, pressing his lips firmly against his. Sherlock’s breath hitched and he pressed forward, sliding a hand up onto John’s jaw.
‘You’re my partner now, I need to be more considerate.’ Sherlock’s head hung low, his hands in his lap.
‘Ooh.’ Sherlock appeared behind his left shoulder, gloved hands stretched out of the way as he read the text. ‘Seems worth a look. Ask him to send me the address.’
‘Precisely. The hands were bound in the same way, but with a different type of rope. All of the other kidnapping and murders we’ve found have been with the same rope. Ligature marks around the neck are sloppy, unlike the others which are clean and confident. There’s also a distinct smell of cigarette smoke on the victim’s clothing, suggesting that the killer smokes, but the smell was not present at the other crime scenes.’
‘It baffles me that people think their idols will praise them for becoming a carbon copy of them. Who would want to be mirrored like that?’ Sherlock huffed and glugged some wine. ‘For example, you admire me-’
Twenty minutes later, John and Sherlock were seated around a large beer garden, string lights overhead illuminating everyone’s eyes as they drank like they were in University.
‘What?’ John picked a large forkful of food and enthusiastically shoved it into his mouth, savouring the taste. Sherlock had yet to acknowledge his food.
Greg quickly stepped aside as John went to elbow him. ‘Besides,’ he continued, ‘if you both get your arses in gear and admit you’re in a relationship by Sherlock’s birthday, I win £50.’
John looked up to answer, but his voice caught in his throat. Something akin to vulnerability shone in Sherlock’s eyes, and it took a moment for John to realise this was probably a huge step to the detective. He took a leap of faith and reached across the table to cover Sherlock’s hand with his. Sherlock looked down at their hands, before turning his so his palm was facing John’s.
‘You’re on the bridge of a minor breakdown following your thoughts about Mary, I thought I should soften the blow slightly.’ Sherlock’s eyes never left Rosie’s crib as he spoke. John let himself admire the man in front of him briefly before the Detective’s eyes moved back to him.
After a quick glance at each other, John reluctantly nodded. It wasn’t that he didn’t like drinking with Greg. Before Rosie was born, he quite regularly joined him in their local pub. Now, however, he was older and a lot more tired. Even with an almost perfectly behaved baby, she was still tiring to look after. John had seen more wrinkles on his face than ever before.
The London heatwave, it seemed, was affecting everybody as they arrived at the crime scene. It was on the corner of Hyde Park, closed off from the public. Police officers and detectives alike were standing around in varying undress.
The answer shocked both him and Greg when it was announced, and the brilliant bastard continued his work on the crime scene like it was nothing.
John loved it, apart from the time he had been woken up at 3 am by an enthusiastic Sherlock kissing him, only for the tall bastard to run back downstairs again.
Taking his hand back to begin eating again, he was amused to see the look of shock Sherlock gave him. Decidedly ignoring it, John began to eat in earnest as his hunger grew. After a few seconds, Sherlock began to eat again.
‘Okay…’ Sherlock’s mouth opened and closed a few times, reminding John of a goldfish. ‘Are you sure?’
John smiled to himself as he leaned down and gently brushed the cheek of his child. It was hard to ignore the similarities between Rosie and Sherlock. Those bright blue eyes, verging on grey as they caught the sunlight, and the brilliant dark head of hair the both of them sported made it increasingly difficult to deny they were a couple.
Their pasta dishes were set down quickly, and the waiter didn’t stick around long either. John hummed, his stomach growling at the smell and picked up his fork.
They ended up in Angelo’s. The man had since upgraded and moved restaurants, and now had the option for outdoor seating with a gorgeous view of the Thames.
‘I told you, I’m not expecting you to change. If that means you sometimes forget about me to rush off when your mind is solely on the case, then so be it. You’ve been doing it since the day I met you.’
The fact that John could read Sherlock almost as easily as the detective could read everyone around him was kept close to John’s heart. No one knew the brilliant man in front of him more, no one knew when he was about to have an outburst, or drop from lack of eating (Now that John was living back at 221B the latter of the two was kept to a minimum). He knew when Sherlock needed to break his smoking habit, or when he was internally panicking because of an external factor. He knew when he needed to be left alone, or distracted. For John, Sherlock’s emotions were plain as day on his face, where to others, he would have the same expression.
‘And two, the dynamic between a crazy fan who idolises someone is entirely different from a friendship. I want to spend time with you, not be you.’
‘Yeah.’ John skimmed the text, then wrinkled his nose, ‘pretty disgusting murder, apparently. Greg said it could be linked to those kidnappings.’
He had talked about Sherlock’s death with her, but not to a full extent. She knew the basic details, enough to make her understand why John was still mourning. John often felt like he should tell her more, but it seemed like she already knew, in a way, knew something deeper than a roommate relationship was between them.
Molly was looking after Rosie, knowing just how important the case was, for the night, leaving John and Sherlock free to be coerced into celebrating with Lestrade and the others.
‘Hm?’ Sherlock finally turned towards the table, giving John his full attention. Grey eyes bored into his own, but John refused to break eye contact. ‘Why am I being stupid to think that you abhor the idea of a relationship with me?’
For once, Sherlock didn’t dive into a condescending rant when asked to elaborate. He simply set his mug down and leant forward on his knees, regarding the doctor with an intense stare.
While Sherlock busied himself with savouring his cigarette and the rest of his wine, John finished his meal, thanking Angelo as he took the two empty plates away and returned with another bottle of wine and an ashtray.
Sherlock’s eyes rolled upwards. ‘Do you want to advance our relationship to include a romantic element?’
An image flashed in his mind of the two of them raising Rosie together, much the same way they were doing currently, but with John’s arm wrapped around Sherlock’s waist as he held their daughter in his arms. John heard himself answer without thinking.
They lulled back into a comfortable silence as John watched the small breeze ripple the surface of the river. It struck him that nothing felt out of the ordinary. Normally, when you confess your feelings, or want a relationship with someone, you would get a buzz of happy feelings, excited for the days ahead. John didn’t feel that way, however. No, he felt at perfect peace, possibly for the first time since he joined the army.
“I’ll wash your hair for you,” Jo wheedled. “Please? I just want to be close to you, and take care of you. Just for a little while. We’re both exhausted. Let me do this for you, and then take you to bed and hold you until everything hurts a little less.”
After a few minutes, Jo took a deep breath. “Sherlock, I… I don’t think I can do that again. I’m nearly forty, the chances of miscarrying will only get higher and I just --” she cut herself off, suppressing a sob. “I couldn’t handle going through that again. It just hurts too much.”
“I'm not due until tomorrow. I suppose you're right.” Sherlock still sounded more than a little heartbroken, and Jo pulled her close, offering comfort.
Sherlock glanced uneasily back toward Jo’s room, The nurse clearly wanted to settle in for a proper heart-to-heart, but Sherlock was unwilling to leave Jo alone for any longer than strictly necessary.
Sherlock nearly sagged with relief. “Thank you. I love you too.” She paused, then said, “And I’m glad we’re not shutting each other out anymore. I didn’t like that.”
Jo didn’t come back downstairs for the rest of the day. In fact, the only time Sherlock saw her for the next
Sherlock kissed her quiet. “Just humour me for a minute, please? You've had nausea, vomiting, cramping, sensitivity to smells, and now dizziness. Your period was slightly late -”
Mrs Hudson nodded. “Sherlock said you two had a bit of a spat. Did you want to talk about it? Might make you feel better.”
Time passed strangely, each day seeming endless; and yet it seemed like Jo had barely blinked and two weeks had passed. The bleeding from the miscarriage had stopped, and then it was almost like she hadn’t been pregnant.
Sherlock declared the case - murder-suicide, or perhaps double murder, Sally hadn't been entirely certain - an eight, and dragged Jo out of her sweatpants and into a cab. Jo curled up next to her and tried to ignore the way the motion of the cab made her stomach churn uncomfortably.
It didn't take long for Hamish to calm down once he'd curled up with his father, and he was asleep again in minutes. Sherlock smiled fondly and pressed a kiss to the boy's curls. He'd stay there for a little while - just until John got home. Or at least, that's what he told himself before falling asleep with Hamish tucked securely against his chest.
Jo grinned at her, enchanted. “You don't fool me, Sherlock Holmes. You're a sentimental sod under all that.”
wanted Sherlock to be awake, to pull her close and comfort her before they fell asleep together. Scowling, Jo curled up away from Sherlock and tried hard not to think of anything until she fell asleep.
when she thought she wasn't taking care of herself well enough; that was what her ballet instructor called her and Sherlock always, always listened to Madame Deschamps. (Jo always listened to her, too, for that matter. The woman was intimidating.) It was a more lighthearted way to get Sherlock's attention, to say, "you're worrying me, please take better care of yourself," without actually having to say it.
Jo moved her hand from where it had been resting on Sherlock’s stomach, tugging gently on her shoulder. Sherlock rolled over to face her, still pressed close.
- and Sherlock’s head was spinning, imagining worst case scenarios. What had happened? Was she sick? Injured?
“Well,” Jo started hesitantly. “Sherlock and I have been thinking, well, talking really, and…” she paused, took a deep breath. “We want to start a family. We want to have a baby.”
Sherlock swallowed hard and scrubbed her hands over her eyes. “I… yes,” she stammered, unable to think of anything else to say.
Sherlock pressed her lips to her forehead, checking for a fever as much as offering comfort. “It’s not your fault. And like you said, there's always next month, right?”
Neither woman spoke for several more minutes. Mrs Hudson nudged Jo gently off of her shoulder and towards  the abandoned bowl of soup, which Jo picked at listlessly.
“Well, it’s starting to burn.” Jo unplugged the toaster, making the toast pop. She'd been right - the toast was just barely light enough for Sherlock, who flatly refused to eat it if it was even the slightest bit burnt.
Sherlock was doing any of these things, but Sherlock occasionally caught her watching, with a look that seemed to say
“I didn’t either, love. No more, alright? We can handle just about anything, but only if we do it together.”
“That explains the soup,” Jo said. “I know it wasn’t my fault. Logically, I know that. There’s nothing I could have done, and I tell patients the same thing. But I just… god, I can’t stop thinking of all the things I could have done differently. I stopped taking the prenatal vitamins the midwife recommended, did you know? They made me ill.” Jo paused. She set the barely-touched bowl of soup down and buried her face in her hands.
"Really, Johanna, does that surprise you? It's all over your hands now, too, I would imagine." Sherlock's voice was haughty and superior, but Jo could tell that she was more than a little embarrassed and trying to cover it.
Greg pulled back from where he’d been leaning against Mycroft’s shoulder. “Don’t let her catch you talking like that,” he said, his voice full of laughter. “She’s got a reputation to uphold after all.”
“I’m alright with it if you are,” Jo replied, kissing her head. “You’re sure it’s not too soon, sweetheart? It’s okay if you want to wait a bit longer.”
"Will come and kiss you goodnight as soon as he gets home. Sleep now." Sherlock gently carded his hand through Hamish's hair and dropped another kiss on his forehead. Shifting so that they were laying down, he cradled the small boy with his body. Hamish hummed sleepily and snuggled into his father's chest. He was asleep almost instantly.
The subject of trying again didn’t come up until well after the would-be due date. Sherlock propped herself against the kitchen counter where Jo was making breakfast, looking shy and fiddling with her hair anxiously.
“I’m not sure I want to put it behind me, exactly.” Jo replied hesitantly. “I… Sherlock and I talked, about the baby. I don’t want to forget our baby, the baby we would have had. Not really.”
“I’m not much company at the moment, Mrs Hudson, sorry,” came Jo’s voice from the other side of the door. “I don’t really feel like talking.”
Eventually Jo shifted in her seat and opened her mouth, but she closed it again without saying anything, looking uncomfortable.
“Your midterm isn’t for another week and you already know all the material. There’ll be plenty of time after you wake up.”
Sherlock nodded slightly. “Please.” The precise control she usually maintained over mind and body meant that she didn’t burst into tears the moment Mrs Hudson was kind to her, but it was a close thing. She wrapped her arms around her belly, her shoulders hunched, and tried to blink the sudden burn of tears out of her eyes.
The rest of the dinner passed amicably, with the difficult bits out of the way. The two couples chatted easily – as easily as the Holmes siblings ever chat, anyway – about logistics and timelines over pudding and more wine. By the time they had everything more or less worked out, Greg and Jo were both pleasantly pissed and Sherlock and Mycroft were sick of socialising, but amused by their respective intoxicated loves.
Jo reappeared quickly with a tall glass of water and a box of tissue. “Here, sweetheart,” she said gently. She wrapped her back around Sherlock and tucked her close to her side, settling the box of tissue on their laps and offering the water to Sherlock.
“Excellent, thank you.” Dr Singh accepted the file from the nurse and closed the door, flipping through the papers. “Your hCG is a bit low, which isn’t a great sign. Everything else looks good, though.”
It suddenly occurred to Sherlock that it wasn’t just Jo who could be in danger - what if something had happened to the baby? Jo was barely eight weeks pregnant… any number of things could have happened to either or both of them. Sherlock’s stomach dropped as another flood possibilities rushed through her mind.
This chapter contains mention of both abortion and a bit of recreational drug use, so if that's not your cup of tea, this might not be the fic for you!
“Alright, then. I suppose, if you really want to…” Sherlock teased, allowing Jo to manhandle her to her feet.
“Best to give her some time to cool off first, I think,” replied Mrs Hudson, bustling into the kitchen. “Since we’re both up, I may as well make us some breakfast.”
“I suppose you’re right,” Jo conceded, but she didn’t sound confident. “I just… I dunno, I thought it might be nice to have someone we know. It’s a bit less… impersonal, is all.”
"Sherlock, you had a single piece of toast this morning and it's nearly noon. You were shaking like a leaf just now and could barely hold yourself
“Thank you, Mycroft,” Jo said earnestly. “You have no idea how much this means to us. Having a known donor - especially one so closely related - is a relief. And, if we’re really lucky, the baby will look like Sherlock.” She smiled, soft and fond, at Sherlock, who turned pink and ducked her head.
Sherlock blushed prettily and blinked at her, looking surprised and pleased. She was silent for a moment, then smiled softly. "Thank you. I... it's nice, to be taken care of like this. I, um, appreciate it."
“Are you really fine, or are you just saying that so I'll go back to kissing you?” Jo asked, trying to lighten Sherlock’s mood.
“I’m sorry, love. I should have talked to you then. But my point is, the nightmare I had… it was this little girl, not old enough to be --” she broke off and shuddered “-- you know. But I knew, in the dream, that that’s what she was. And she was holding a baby… she asked me why I didn’t want them. Why I didn’t love them.”
“I'll be right back, okay?” Jo said quietly a few minutes later. “I'm just going to get you some tissue.”
“Goodnight, then,” Sherlock said, still slightly uncertain that she ought to be leaving Jo alone at all.
Sherlock frowned, but pulled Jo closer. “You know what I’m going to say, I hope,” she said, kissing her head.
“I think it’s an excellent idea,” Jo smiled. “Just because we didn’t get to meet her, doesn’t mean we don’t get to remember her.”
“That’s right,” Dr Singh agreed. “Ideally we’d do both, but I know you’re probably eager to get home to bed.”
Sherlock nodded and swallowed a sob, burying her face in Jo’s shoulder. “I love you,” she whispered.
The nurse who had called Sherlock was waiting at the desk for her. She took one look at Sherlock’s tear-stained face and pulled her into a warm, maternal hug. Under any other circumstances Sherlock would have resisted so much close contact from a stranger, but the nurse reminded her of her grandmother. She let herself be held for a moment, the knot of anxiety in her chest loosening.
Jo's heart broke just a little. “Oh, sweetheart, I'm sorry. I know you were hoping that the AI would work the first time. But… I don't know, love. I think it’s just PMS. We'll wait a few more days, okay? I'll pick up a test if I don't get my period within a few days of yours.”
"Thank you." Jo leaned down again and kissed the back of the other knee. "Besides, I've missed you, it'll be nice to have an afternoon to just laze around the flat."
The question - and the tone -  reminded Jo forcibly of her grandmother, and she almost laughed, but didn’t answer. Her silence somehow managed to be both sulky and embarrassed at the same time.
Jo smiled. “I know you meant to, love. But I’d much rather take care of you -- you’ve been doing so much for me, the last little while. I’ve felt… useless, since we lost the baby. Taking care of you makes me feel better.”
grief, both of ours. I should have been there for you. I’m sorry I wasn’t.” She ran soothing fingers through Sherlock’s curls, untangling them. “But I’m here now, alright? You don’t have to be alone anymore.”
“Of course you do, dear. Come on, I'll take you back. She’s got herself a private room, lucky girl.”
“And,” said Jo, walking over to Sherlock and taking her hands, “I think if you’re really serious about wanting to start a family, then… I think it’s a great idea.”
“Thank you, Mrs. Hudson,” Jo said gratefully, taking the pot from her and setting it on the counter. "Did you want to stay and eat with us?"
“Thank you for tonight, bee. I’m glad we’re doing this,” Jo murmured as they were crawling into bed later that night.
“Thanks, Mrs H,” Jo said gratefully. “I know you’re right, I just… god, I feel like I’ve failed her, you know? I can’t imagine going through this over and over again. How did you bear it?”
Sherlock hesitated, having figured out exactly where Jo was going with this line of questioning and not liking it -- mostly because she knew she was right. "...Yes, obviously."
Sherlock thought that Jo must have been mulling it over throughout the whole case. So had she, actually – it was very distracting. “Couldn’t we just use an anonymous donor and have done with?” she asked, her voice muffled by the oversized t-shirt she was pulling over her head.
The professor cleared his throat loudly and cut off the threatening argument, resuming his lecture as though nothing had happened. Hardly any of the students were listening at that point – most of them were talking quietly, or texting, or staring at Sherlock like they didn’t quite know what to think of her. The professor pointedly ignored them and raised his voice just slightly over the noise.
Sherlock nodded, her cheeks flushed pink, and padded naked out of the bathroom. Jo rolled her eyes -- did she
sleep.” Jo pushed herself into a more upright position, leaning on Sherlock as the room swam just slightly around her.
Sherlock nodded and untangled herself from Jo. She sat up and pulled her dressing gown close around herself, curling her knees up under her chin.
Sherlock glanced over at Jo. She was curled on her side, facing away from her - she looked like she was sleeping. Looking back up at the nurse, Sherlock nodded silently, deciding not to disturb her for the moment.
The soup was, of course, delicious, and Sherlock managed to eat most of a bowl before complaining that she wasn't hungry. Jo decided to take what she could get and tidied away the dishes and leftovers while Sherlock stretched out on the sofa.
“Approximately forty-two hours, then. It would have been longer, but there was a beginner’s class last night and I couldn’t use the studio.”
Jo smiled weakly. “I don’t think I can face her just yet. I feel bad, I should have been taking care of her and instead I snapped at her and told her off for trying to help. I just - I can’t, yet. Is that awful?”
It took less than two full days for Jo to get frustrated with Sherlock’s anxious hovering. She meant well, Jo knew, and she appreciated the concern. It was just - too much, at times. Sherlock, aside from the evident anxiety about Jo’s wellbeing, seemed unmoved by the loss of their baby. The coddling made Jo feel like an invalid, and like she was overreacting to what was, essentially, a particularly nasty period. Jo had been curled up on the couch with a hot water bottle and crap telly when she’d finally had enough.
After a few long minutes, Sherlock took a deep, shuddering breath, clearly trying to calm herself down, and sagged against Jo. “Thank you,” she whispered.
and the medal hanging around her neck was the silvery-white colour of imitation platinum, so somehow she must have pulled it off.
Greg and Mycroft had sequestered themselves in a corner and were busy whispering together when Jo went back in to announce that dinner was ready. “What are they being all secretive about?” she asked Sherlock, curious.
“Jo?” Sherlock asked hesitantly, walking around to sit gingerly on the bed near Jo’s knees. “I’ve gotten your discharge papers sorted, and someone’s brought your things. Do you want to go home?”
“Oi!” Greg complained, “enough of that. Not that it’s any of your business, but yes, it did take a while.”
Scoffing again, Mycroft shook is head. “I’ve never imagined myself as a parent – and I’ve never allowed myself to become close enough with anyone for it to be more than a remote possibility.”
When Sherlock came back, Mary adapted better than he did, welcoming Sherlock into their life like he was always there to begin with. These were the memories that surfaced at the beginning.
At first, when her death was still fresh and the wound was still wide open, he found himself wishing for her return, much like he did Sherlock’s. His memories were filled with good times and kept away the reality of their relationship, which was a strained one.
Knowing it was one of those times to leave Sherlock be for a moment, John heaved himself from his chair, internally cursing his new pain in his joints thanks to ageing, and went to check on Rosie.
It was, for a lack of a better term, bliss. John thought of the three of them as a family, and he was pretty sure Sherlock thought the same. All they needed was each other, the only thing left to address was the nature of their relationship, but John was too scared to lose what they had.
John took a deep breath. Wasn’t this what he was secretly hoping for? A name to whatever had been going on between them since he moved back in? He sat back in his chair, making himself imagine what it would be like to call Sherlock his boyfriend.
Sherlock’s eyes flicked over to Rosie again. ‘At least you have one real thing that benefited from it.’
Sherlock started off slow, occasionally brushing his hands through John’s hair when he was sitting at the kitchen table, or tentatively giving John’s temple a kiss when he dropped off his tea. John loved every minute detail of it, making an effort to store the little moments away so he would never forget them. While Sherlock’s mind was a palace, John’s was more of a run-down shack. He tried his hardest to file things away as his partner did, but more often than not he would forget them the moment a distraction appeared. It frustrated him, but Sherlock never seemed to mind.
“Mhmm.” Jo nudged at Sherlock until she rolled over to kiss her properly. “Promise,” she murmured against Sherlock’s mouth, then pulled away. “Come on, get dressed. Greg said they’d be here around seven-thirty, and it’s already quarter after.”
Sherlock hesitated. “I’m… alright. About as well as can be expected, I suppose. I’ve been worried about you, and trying to keep busy. It’s -- easier. If I don’t think about it. If I don’t think about
"Johanna had asked me to, ah, assist them, yes," Mycroft replied. "But Sherlock hadn't informed me that the first attempt at artificial insemination had been successful. I was alerted when she was admitted to hospital, and naturally I contacted Sherlock the following morning. I do not believe they would have told me, otherwise. As far as I know, no one save myself and Mrs. Hudson is aware."
to have such an important conversation via text message, but also (well, mainly) because she couldn’t imagine Mycroft and Greg in any sort of intimate relationship and wanted to see it for herself.
“Oh, Jo,” Sherlock’s voice was soft and sad. “I’m so sorry, I forgot it was still in your email. I’m so sorry, love.”
"I know, love, and I know how important this competition is to you, but you've got to take better care of yourself. You'll burn yourself out."
“Oh, sweetheart, I’m so sorry. I should have been taking better care of you. I’ve been selfish, caught up in my own head. I’m sorry I didn’t see.”
The four sat down around the kitchen table – Jo had bribed Sherlock into clearing it off properly so they could eat there instead of on the sofa, for once – and Jo poured wine while the food was passed around. Dinner was painfully awkward from the start. Sherlock and Mycroft spent the first ten minutes trading glares and silent insults back and forth.
In all honesty, John didn’t have to think too much about it. He didn’t think Sherlock was the type to change his ways once he was in a relationship. Their day to day life would remain virtually the same, apart from an added intimacy element. After months of being touch starved, John’s heart picked up its pace at the thought. What if it ended badly? Well, they’d already been through so much, was it worth the risk? What if Sherlock didn’t want to add anything sexual to their relationship?
John rolled his eyes, not quite believing he had to explain. ‘Well, for starters, you aren’t a crazy serial kidnapper and murderer.’
He heard movement behind him and looked to see Sherlock getting up and joining him at the crib side.
It was all Sherlock. John was a medical man, and didn’t believe in superstitions like soulmates, but, if he did, he would have to agree that he and Sherlock were the closest to it he had seen.
The man across from him kept his expression the same, but he began blinking faster, an indicator that Sherlock was internally panicking. ‘So, do you?’
John almost spit out the wine he had sipped. ‘Is that your insane way of asking me to be your boyfriend?’ He asked, a smile playing on his lips.
There was a wave of cheers, mostly calling Sherlock’s name. The man in question froze with his glass halfway in the air, confused.
Sherlock hummed. ‘Had to engrave those words into the door to yours and Rosie’s side of the palace.’
He felt Sherlock shrug next to him. ‘Boring. There’s only so much you can find out about pigs ears.’
The more time went on, the more his memories began to show the reality of their relationship. John now understood why she had been so patient with him, always waiting for the right chance to use the information she had gained against him.
John smiled up at him. ‘Yeah, just been to a crime scene, though, so I doubt I can get Sherlock to order anything.’
Because John was so well versed in Sherlock’s ways, he had long ago activated the ‘find my friends’ app on his phone without him knowing, and caught up with the detective just in time to help him bring the copycat down. Sherlock’s face, when he saw John rush onto the scene, told the doctor everything he needed to know. He knew Sherlock was feeling guilty for rushing off and leaving John like he always did, and mentioned it that night when they were on their way home in the cab.
Sherlock stared at John for a few moments as if he should already know the answer. ‘Kissing you restarts my brain.’ He said simply.
‘Thank you, Mrs Hudson, we may do that. I bet John is dying to dine out.’ Sherlock contemplated his coat that was hanging by the door but decided against it, pocketing his wallet and phone before kissing Mrs Hudson on the check as a goodbye.
Had Sherlock really just admitted to being in love with him for almost 8 years? 8 Years? And now he was raising his daughter alongside him, offering no complaints to the fact John had married someone else, treating Rosie with the patience of a true parent. Come to think of it, it had always been Sherlock for John.
‘Sorry. So, we were never officially married?’ John chewed on his lip as Sherlock shook his head. ‘Makes sense. Everything about her was fake, why would our marriage be any different?’
John shrugged. ‘If we are to ‘advance our relationship’ as you like to put it, I’m not expecting much to change, you know. You’re still you. I’m not expecting you to magically turn into Romeo.’ He regarded his surroundings; the lights from the city illuminating the water in front of them, a warm night, the two of them sitting in the glow of the candles on the table. ‘Besides, this is pretty damn romantic, when you look at it.’
‘It’s a huge deal!’ Greg was on his third rum and coke, and it sloshed out of his glass as he gesticulated. ‘Do you know just how long we’ve known Sherlock was hopelessly in love with you? Huh?’
The second week, however, brought some excitement. Sherlock had managed to track down the copycat killer, who had killed again once he realised the Police were covering up his first murder and had run off before John had a chance to follow him.
‘Sherlock.’ John spoke up after a minute or two. His friend was beginning to worry him slightly. ‘What’s going on?’
Once Mrs Hudson was happily settled in Sherlock’s armchair with a cup of tea, a pile of biscuits and the tv on a crappy soap, Sherlock appeared from his bedroom dressed. Even though it was the evening, it was still insanely hot, and the detective had ditched his usual suit jacket for his dark purple shirt, rolled up to his elbows.
John sat back in his chair. The truth of the matter was, Sherlock had been right. It was a quiet Sunday afternoon. Sherlock had been busy experimenting with something on the kitchen table, Rosie was asleep and John had all the time to fall into his memories.
After the first kiss, it seemed Sherlock had made kissing John part of his daily routine. If he got stuck while working on the case, he would march over to where John was sitting and plant a firm kiss on his lips, going immediately back to thinking.
Rosie was such a fantastic child. Much like all 4-month-olds, she would sometimes have hissy fits, screaming blue murder, but usually, she was quiet and happy. Her eyes were as sharp as Sherlock’s when she watched you, as she usually did from her crib. She had no interest in any toy apart from the one Sherlock gave her; a fluffy elephant with a blanket attached to his head for its body. John knew she only liked it because it smelled like him, as he often caught Sherlock carrying the thing around.
A movement and Sherlock’s keen eyes whipped round to the sound, checking on Rosie as she slept soundly in her crib by the sofa.
‘So.’ John said, opening the other bottle of wine and breaking the silence. ‘Are we considering this our first date? Crime scene and a lovely dinner?’
After their first ‘date’, Sherlock and John decided to walk back to Baker Street. The night was calm, and Sherlock chatted about his predictions for the case while a-lot-more-than-tipsy John stole the packet of cigarettes out of his pocket. When he went to put them back, he found Sherlock’s hand there, waiting. Wordlessly, they slipped their hands together, entwining their fingers as they walked home.
‘This person is hoping that this murder will earn him his 15 minutes of fame, enough so the original killer will notice him. I would suggest not to release this story until the case is solved. Don’t give him what he wants most, which is attention. Simply release to the press that the killer is still at large and to proceed about your daily life with caution.’
Not that he knew, but he was fairly sure that Mary was only with him in the first place because he had been so close to Sherlock. Sherlock and Mary’s relationship in the months before her death were evident of that. She pushed John aside to gain Sherlock’s trust and pushed her way into their dynamic like a tumour latching onto a vital organ.
‘Because Mary stole another’s identity to become ‘Mary Morstan’, she married you under a fake name.’
‘Wrong.’ Sherlock piped up, a hardness to his voice that the others hadn’t heard in a while. ‘...It was the day after.’
‘Okay. Thanks, Sherlock.’ Greg walked to Donovon to order closer examination of the cigarettes found in the area, in case there were more with DNA on them. Sherlock watched them for a moment, before turning to John.
John huffed. ‘Don’t be stupid, Sherlock.’ He said in defence. ‘Let’s go and get some food before Mrs Hudson calls us to say her Corrie binge has ended.’
Sherlock graced him with a warm smile that reached his eyes. ‘Two real things,’ he repeated, nodding in thought. John watched his fingers steeple at his chin and his eyes glaze over, signalling Sherlock had also begun to go through his thoughts.
John picked a table outside, determined to enjoy the heat while it lasted, and soon two glasses of John’s favourite wine were placed on the table by an enthusiastic waitress. Sherlock was silent for the cab ride and stared ahead as he picked up one of the glasses to take a distracted sip.
Greg was the first to raise his glass. ‘So.’ He called everyone quiet. ‘Here’s to another successful case! Great work, everyone! And great work, Sherlock!’
‘I promised not to bring human body parts into the flat.’ Sherlock corrected, and when John turned he saw a smirk playing on his lips.
John watched in shock as the excitement died away, and the crowd went back to their conversations. A few people turned to him and Sherlock to ask more. Before he could answer, Sherlock piped up, relaxing into his seat as he told the story of how he and John finally got their asses in gear.
‘This person is clearly unhinged. The practice was messy and unplanned, most likely getting the necessary information from what the Police had released. My best guess is we are looking for someone who idolises the original killer enough to try and earn their recognition and praise.’
They finished their meal in silence. London’s nightlife surrounded them in a peaceful lull of noise. Sherlock, to John’s surprise, dug into his meal like he was a starving man and finished before John did, gracefully wiping his mouth with his napkin. One look at his, should he say boyfriend? John shook himself. One look at his partner told John everything he needed to know.
Ever since John had moved back in, something unsaid had fallen into place between him and Sherlock. John had given updating long ago, since taking care of Rosie and, more often than not, Sherlock was a full-time job in itself. Sherlock kept the three of them afloat with money, something he insisted on doing so John could enjoy the first few years of his daughter's life without a job getting in the way. He showered Rosie with gifts, to the point where John put his foot down and told Sherlock ‘there is such a thing as too many dinosaur toys’, and never made a fuss when John presented him with a full meal.
Sherlock smirked, bending down to duck under the tape as Donovon held it aloft for them. ‘I could say the same about your hair. Your forehead is missing it.’
His friend hummed, chewing on his lip before turning back to the Thames. ‘In these cases, the copycat is often the most violent. We have to be careful.’
It became routine after a while, asking Mrs Hudson to take care of Rosie for a few hours, which she was more than willing to do, to help them both get to a crime scene. At first, John protested and left Sherlock to solve his cases by himself. But, when Sherlock ended up in Hospital after an altercation John could have easily stopped, the army doctor had made the decision to help out as much as possible.
John, himself, was only sporting a long-sleeved t-shirt, one that Sherlock had given him for his birthday after he glanced at it in a shop window but decided it was too expensive.
‘Because you did a good job, now smile and drink your beer.’ Sherlock did as he was asked, before turning and whispering something into John’s ear that made his hair curl.
‘Sorry, Sherlock, you’re going to have to spell this one out for me.’ John admitted, taking a tentative sip of his tea. It wasn’t often that Sherlock would make him tea or coffee, and more often than not he had an ulterior motive.
While Sherlock busied himself with discarding his experiment, now in record time, John texted Greg back and jogged down the stairs to knock on Mrs Hudson’s door.
The question stunned John before he quickly chose his words. It was obvious that this was the thing on Sherlock’s mind, instead of the case. ‘For many reasons. You think so little of yourself that you don’t realise how much of a caring person you are, someone who would thrive in a romantic relationship like that. You’re also being stupid because, for god's sake, we live together, you’re helping me raise my daughter, we spend every conceivable moment together, you really think that advancing upon that would make me uncomfortable?’
John had kept a smile on his face until Baker Street came into view. Then began to wonder if they had made a mistake. It was all well and good to confess feelings or whatever in a romantic setting like the one they were in, but what would actually happen when they returned to reality. They still had a baby to look after, and crimes to solve. Would they really be able to do it?
Who was it that he was so desperate to flaunt his new girlfriends over, only to watch as Sherlock ripped them a new one, causing them to leave? Who was it that he trailed after night after night, instead of sleeping, like any normal man in his thirties would be doing? Who devastated him to the core to see dead, who he had mourned for two years, and who he’d come running back to a month after his supposed ‘love of his life’ died?
A few days passed and John’s curiosity had run its course. When Sherlock was sitting on the sofa attempting to coax Rosie into taking her bottle, John saw the perfect opportunity. He stopped directly in front of his partner, making him crane his neck upwards (for once) to look him in the eyes.
They hadn’t officially announced anything to their friends yet, because, in all honesty, there wasn’t much to announce. Sherlock had been busy with the kidnapping/killings case enough that his focus wasn’t on his and John’s relationship.
‘I’m sure you’ll find something else to do.’ Both men jumped as Sherlock materialised next to them, pulling off his latex gloves.
‘The level of smell shows that the person was a very heavy smoker. The victim did not have any signs of yellowing around his fingers, a trademark to someone who would smoke that much, neither any form of tobacco or cigarette lighter in his pocket. Also, more often than not, a heavy smoker’s clothing will have evidence of burn holes where they have dropped their cigarette, but the victim’s clothes are free from them. There’s also the case of this.’ Sherlock lifted an evidence bag in his hand. John peered closer to see a squashed cigarette butt. ‘I doubt you would stuff one in your own mouth when you were being murdered.’
It was because of this realisation, then, that John cornered Sherlock in the back of the cab on the way home that night, pushing himself into his space and muttering in his ear.
“No, you're not.” Sherlock slipped her hands under Jo's shirt, running them lightly over her hips and belly.
Sherlock’s chin lifted slightly and she turned in her seat. “No, I didn’t think so, either,” she replied casually, as if there wasn’t an entire lecture hall between them. The little boost it seemed to give her didn’t last, though, and she sank down in her seat to hide again.
Sherlock sniggered and cuddled closer to Jo. “Are you really not going to react to the fact that Lestrade is sleeping with a man? It’s not as if he’s openly bisexual.”
Sherlock stood up and whirled around, her face red and twisted in anger, her shoulders tight and her hands clenched into fists at her sides. “And what’s it to you if I am?” she demanded.
“There’s no need to be political, Holmes. I’m sure all of that is irrelevant to our discussion today…” the prof – who, Jo noted, was one of the oldest in the department and staunchly heterosexual (not to mention more than a little homophobic) – trailed off awkwardly. “Now, as I was saying –”
Jo forced herself to take a deep breath and try again at a more normal speed. “I said, I’d spent the whole semester wrongly assuming you were straight, but now that I know better… will you go out with me? Just for coffee or something?”
"I know dancing is important to you, and I'm so proud of you for working so hard while balancing school and everything else, but I'm worried about you, sweetheart. I know I've said it a million times, but you're working yourself too hard."
The nurse knocked on the open door to Jo's room and poked her head in. “Someone here to see you, hon.”
"All right, then." Jo turned off the shower and stepped out, wrapping a towel around herself before turning back to her girlfriend. Jo draped one towel around Sherlock's shoulders, then used another to pat some of the water from her nearly-waist-length-hair. Once it stopped dripping, Jo used a third towel to gently dry the rest of her, pressing chaste little kisses to whichever bits of skin were close enough.
The thick iron scent of blood hit Jo before Donovan had even opened the door and she swallowed hard, resisting the urge to cover her mouth and nose with one hand. She must have made some sort of noise, because both Sherlock and Donovan turned to look at her, looking concerned.
Sherlock hesitated, flushing. “I… we had an argument, two days ago. She hasn’t spoken to me since, and I don’t think she’s been eating… She’s been upstairs in her old bedroom, and she won’t let me in.”
“Go on, then, what is it?” Greg asked. He shot Mycroft a look. “And don’t you deduce it, it’s clearly important to them.”
"Yes, I know you can. But I like taking care of you. And besides," Jo stopped to kiss Sherlock's sharp hipbone, "you deserve to be spoiled every once in awhile."
Jo sat up and accepted the water. “Thanks,” she mumbled, her throat raw. “Sorry about that. I haven’t thrown up looking at a corpse since…”
“Jo?” Sherlock repeated. “Is that -- are you listening to the heartbeat recording the midwife gave us?”
“Sweetheart,” Jo started hesitantly, “do you remember the midwife saying that we should wait until I’m twelve weeks to announce the pregnancy? Because the risk of miscarriage drops?”
Jo waited a moment, but Sherlock didn’t seem inclined to finish the sentence. Worried now as well as curious, she moved closer and ducked her head to try and catch Sherlock’s eye. “What’s on your mind, bee? Is something wrong?”
Jo took a deep breath through her mouth, trying to ignore the smell, then held her breath and looked more closely. She immediately regretted it, gagged, and rushed out of the bathroom.
“No, it’s just… When you were -- when I was -- I didn’t know how to help, how to make you feel better. So I did some research. And it said… it said that sometimes, after losing a child, couples can fall apart. The grief and resentment and… everything, it’s too much, and they separate.”
She was trying to figure out, exactly, how long the young person sitting in the second row had known they were pregnant when Molly suddenly started yelling her name and shaking her. "You won! Sherlock! You got platinum!"
Sherlock stepped back, frowning thunderously. “Jo. I barely touched you. If you're not interested, you could have just -”
The two sat in comfortable silence until Jo finished the braid. She pressed her lips to the crown of Sherlock's head as she looped a hair elastic around the end. "There. Gorgeous."
The phone rang in the middle of the night, startling Sherlock, who hadn't realized she'd fallen asleep. Sherlock grabbed for her phone and checked the caller ID -
A few minutes later -- after Sherlock had hobbled to the bathroom on sore feet and achy legs, leaning heavily on Jo -- the girls were surrounded by thick steam, pressed close together in the not-quite-big enough stall, talking quietly while Jo washed Sherlock's hair. Sherlock had her eyes closed and her head tilted forward towards Jo, trusting and pliant.
"Shh, Hamish, it's alright. I'm here," he soothed, going to sit on the edge of the bed and pulling Hamish into his lap. The boy sobbed ("Papa...") and wound his arms and legs around his father's torso, clinging to his shirt. "Shh, you're alright..."
“I know, I know you said you didn’t want to. But I thought… maybe this time, it could be me.” Another pause, heavy and anxious. “I could be the one to carry this time. If… if you still want to start a family, that is. We don’t have to. I just thought – I want to, so I could do it. I wouldn’t mind. If. Um. If you want.”
After a long moment, Jo opened the door to let Mrs Hudson in. “Thank you,” she said sincerely. “I haven’t felt much like cooking or eating these last few days.”
“You’re less idiotic and more tolerable than most, and you’re practically family. Naturally you’re the best choice among available options.”
Sherlock glared half-heartedly at her but took the thermos and sandwich Jo offered her. "Thank you."
“Well, why not? We can pick someone who looks vaguely like you, any decent sperm bank tests for safety and quality… it makes sense. If it’s the cost that concerns you, I already told you it’s a nonissue.”
Mrs Hudson was smiling when she opened the door, but it faded quickly when she saw Sherlock (which was, Sherlock thought, mildly offensive. She didn’t look
“Sherlock, then. I’m sorry, but Johanna's been admitted. Doctor Singh is going to check on her soon, but she asked me to call you first.”
Sherlock stuck the earbud in her ear and pulled Jo close. “It wasn’t your fault, you know,” she said over the tiny, rushing heartbeat in their ears. “I don’t blame you for what happened.”
Jo smiled a weak, watery smile and held out one of the earbuds. “Do you think it would have been a boy or a girl? If I hadn’t….”
And so Sherlock tried. She finished the renovations in 221C, making a lab out of the reach of toddlers and away from the now-sanitary kitchen; the fridge was filled with groceries rather than biological specimens. Sherlock tidied up around the flat, rented movies she knew Jo loved, bought a new coffee maker and programmed it to be ready for Jo’s early shifts. Jo never commented on
Sherlock kissed the laughter out of Jo’s mouth. It was messy and uncoordinated, both of them smiling too much to properly kiss. But with all ten positive tests on the kitchen table behind them and Sherlock’s hands covering Jo’s on her still-flat stomach, it was absolutely perfect.
“About asking Lestrade to act as donor for us. For me, specifically, I mean. Well. For you too, but I think it would make more sense for Mycroft to be the donor if you’re the one carrying because then the child would have genes from both of us, which is, ideally, what you want. But Lestrade is practically family by now anyway, and Mrs. H adores him so she would approve. Not that we need anyone’s permission, I just mean –” Sherlock tripped over her words in her hurry to get them all out, and eventually cut herself off, her cheeks glowing pink in the dim light.
Jo was quiet for a moment. Sherlock glanced uneasily at her, unsure how she would react. Jo seemed fine, since they’d talked and cried and slept, and Sherlock hoped Mrs Hudson’s prying wouldn’t change that.
“I'm fine, just. The eggs smell especially like sulphur and dirty feet today. It's turning my stomach, actually.”
Jo smiled slightly and snuggled closer in response. There was another long silence, but this time it was comfortable, relaxed and warm and full of love.
“Personal isn’t exactly the word I would have chosen,” Sherlock chimed in. “Tedious and embarrassing would be more accurate.”
After several long moments of uncomfortable silence, Sherlock cleared her throat. “Is… did she - um. Is she - Is the…?”
By the time they had showered, brushed their teeth, and curled up in bed, Sherlock was no longer warm and pliant and relaxed. Instead, there was tension lingering in her face, in the way she held herself just slightly too carefully away from Jo.
It was obvious looking at his daughter that Mary was lying about being a natural blonde, too. While John’s hair had been permanently bleached by Afghanistan’s sun, he had still been born blond. Mary had always put up the pretence of being a natural blonde. John didn’t know how she managed it, but she did.
And, to John, that was exactly what he wanted. He knew what kind of a man Sherlock was when he was trying too hard to please the people around him. The way his partner reacted before John’s wedding came to mind as an example. It was good that he wasn’t thinking too much of it, as it meant John could do most of the observation.
A few days after the Egg Incident, as Sherlock had taken to calling it in her head, Detective Inspector Sally Donovan rang to request Sherlock’s help at a crime scene. Sherlock's working relationship with Donovan had drastically improved since she'd been forced to go over all of Sherlock's cases with a fine-toothed comb after her Fall, and since Sherlock had given up on treating her like an idiot. The confidence boost the promotion had given her didn't hurt, either.
"Of course, love." Jo cupped her hand around the back of Sherlock's neck and kissed her warmly, nipping at her bottom lip before pulling away. "Go on, then. I'll see you after."
“She’s right, you know,” Jo spoke up, impulsively. “None of that applies to lesbians – or at least, not to me.” A lecture hall full of homophobic freshman was a less-than-ideal place to come out, but she couldn’t help wanting to take some of the attention off of Sherlock.
are sleeping together?” she asked, incredulous. “You only have the one brother, right? We are talking about
“Is that… are you saying yes?” Sherlock asked hesitantly. She looked like she wanted to smile, like she wanted to laugh with joy, but she wasn’t allowing herself to. Not until she was sure.
It was obvious to Sherlock that Jo wasn’t sold on the idea of an anonymous donor: she didn’t like the risk involved, and thought it too impersonal. She knew that Jo wouldn’t push Sherlock to choose someone they knew if she thought she wouldn’t want to, but Sherlock wasn’t set enough on the idea to cause a fight about it. She shook her head, curls whispering against Jo’s t-shirt. “No. If you’re not comfortable using an unknown donor, we can ask someone we know. Of course we can.”
"You can, and you will, Sherlock," Jo responded, her tone leaving no room for argument. "How many hours have you danced this week, hm?"
Jo smiled and rocked up on her toes to kiss her softly. "You're welcome, love. Do you want me to braid your hair for you before we go to bed?"
"Sure, love. The last thing you need is another blood blister under your nail." She bent her head to press a kiss to the bit of Sherlock's foot she was currently digging her thumb into, but pulled back quickly. "Ugh. I didn't notice earlier, but your feel smell
Johanna.” her voice softened. “You’re hyperventilating. You need to try and slow your breathing down.”
"No, you're not." Jo sat next to Sherlock's hip on the sofa and tucked a stray curl behind her ear. "You're overworking yourself, sweetheart."
Within seconds he was upstairs, peering into his son's room. Hamish was huddled against his headboard, crying and calling for John. The knot of panic in Sherlock's chest loosened, concern taking its place. It had just been a nightmare.
“You stop that right now, Jo Watson. Losing your little one was a terrible thing, but it was absolutely
“Yes.” Jo kissed her cheek. “I already feel better, but I don't think going back in there is a good idea.”
body anymore – you’d have to share it with the baby for nine months. You’d have to start taking proper care of yourself, too, eating and sleeping regularly.”
“Come on, love, bedtime,” Jo said. She kissed the top of Sherlock’s head and jostled her gently, waking her enough to stand up off her lap.
to coddle you and do everything for you. It doesn’t make you useless. Miscarriage --” Sherlock broke off again and sniffled, holding back fresh tears. “Losing a baby is -- I can’t even imagine how that feels, Jo. She would have been mine too, yes, but it’s not my body. And all I can do is try to make it easier for you. But we’ve hardly spoken for the past
“Coming, sorry!” Slightly frustrated with her sudden squeamishness, Jo steeled herself and approached the body. The smell intensified the further into the bathroom she went, and bile rose in the back of her throat. “What is it?” she asked, trying not to gag.
Mrs Hudson frowned, looking like she might protest. Sherlock quickly cut her off. “We don’t have to,” she said, a suggestion she had found online suddenly occurring to her. “We can remember her, of course we can. We’ll save the recording, and --” Sherlock cut herself off, suddenly unsure.
“There, enough of that now,” the nurse said soothingly. “Your Johanna is going to be fine, but she needs you to be strong for her now. Can you do that?”
, not about anything important, and I just didn’t know what to do or say. I just -- I need you to tell me how to help. Please?
Today, though, was the last straw. Sherlock had been in the studio nearly constantly for the past week and a half without a single day off, and when Jo had seen her that morning she'd looked thinner than usual, with dark circles under her eyes and shaking hands. That had been at five that morning when Sherlock had been banging around the flat getting her things together and Jo had shuffled out of bed to make her a slice of toast with peanut butter and honey - the only thing Sherlock would consent to eat an hour or less before dancing, no matter what time of day it was.
“I know that. And I know you’re only denying it because you think I’ll be upset if you’re not pregnant. But
“Fine, sorry,” Jo said, trying to subtly breathe through her mouth. “The smell surprised me, is all. I guess we know what the booties are for, then?” she joked weakly.
be the child’s father, Mycroft?” Sherlock asked once the blush had faded out of her cheeks. “You won’t be able to influence or manipulate their schooling or what have you, unless we ask you for advice. And you don’t have a claim to custody.”
Dr Singh finally turned away from the sink, but didn’t answer. Her forehead was creased and she wrung her hands together, clearly reluctant to speak.
,” someone stage-whispered, sounding scandalized. “Although I did always think it was rather obvious.”
“They're not foul, they’re perfectly fresh,” Sherlock protested. “Mrs Hudson brought them up yesterday.”
I hope this chapter is a little more uplifting than the last one! It came out a little sadder and heavier than I'd expected, but I'm pleased with it.
The two hours between her performance and the adjudication were horrible. Sherlock sulked around the dressing room, in the cafeteria, and in the audience with Jo, critiquing the other dancers under her breath and stretching and flexing her feet restlessly.
“Whatever you prefer,” Dr Singh said agreeably. She scrubbed her hands in the sink in the corner of the room and snapped on a pair of rubber gloves. “Shall we get started, then?”
Jo woke up slowly, swimming towards consciousness as though through heavy fog. There was a warm weight next to her hip, a gentle hand in her hair.
“Sherlock,” Jo said, her voice taking on the deadly calm tone it had when she was at the end of her patience. “If I need or want something, I will ask you. But my answer hasn’t changed in the ten minutes since you last asked.”
“I… not always, no. When I was younger, I did. But I never thought, after university and -” Sherlock cut herself off and sighed. “I just never thought I could. Between the drugs and being gay, I just… I never thought it was something I could have.”
They fell silent and Jo continued to work the knots out of the muscles in Sherlock's calves. Her thighs would be stiff and sore too, she knew, but that type of massage very rarely stayed fit for public places and besides, Jo wanted to get her home and tucked in bed sooner rather than later.
Jo kissed the side of her head and hugged her tighter. "Well, then, you keep practicing and training, and keep studying Chemistry -- I know you love it, and you're nearly halfway through your degree now -- and then you audition again next year."
Sherlock nodded silently, blinking back tears and looking more than a little overwhelmed, but smiling. Beaming, in fact.
“Oh, love. I didn’t know you and Sherlock had been trying for so long! I’m sorry. It doesn’t get any easier, does it?”
“No, that doesn’t surprise me, actually. He gets a bit leery – harmlessly leery, but leery – when he’s pissed, and he’s not overly fussy about the gender of the people he’s leering at. But your
“They went to dinner six months ago, give or take, and have been dating ever since,” Sherlock announced before Greg could finish chewing his mouthful of pasta. “It took a while for Mycroft to convince Lestrade that he wasn’t being set up, or used as a political pawn inside the Met.”
Mrs Hudson nodded. “Would you like me to bring something up to her, dear? She really should be eating, she’ll need to keep up her strength.”
Sherlock hesitated. Mrs Hudson had been the only person they’d told about the pregnancy, and she clearly didn’t know yet that Jo had miscarried - was it Sherlock’s place to tell her?
“No, I do. But - and please don’t get mad - you’re older than I am, so it makes sense. If we have another, I’ll carry then, maybe.”
Sherlock and Donovan caught up to her moments later. Donovan hung back, giving them the illusion of privacy but obviously worried. Sherlock crouched next to Jo, avoiding the small puddle of sick. She put one warm hand on Jo’s back, offering tissues and a bottle of water to rinse her mouth out with.
