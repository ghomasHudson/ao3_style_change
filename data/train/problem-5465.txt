“Bring him home,” he said simply. The last thing Dean saw was a light glow emanating from Jack’s fingers.
“Yeah, Stevie got her on the phone. She’s coming tomorrow to talk to me, or later today I guess,” Dean said as he glanced at the window where the sun’s rays were filtering in more evidently.
“I mean, I don’t know. I don’t think so,” Dean palmed the lower half of his face.
“I love you, Castiel.”
How long did those last anyway?
“Things got bad again,” Castiel said softly, lifting his shoulder in a half-shrug.
No. He hadn’t.
– back to his room when he heard Cas’ soft laugh drifting from his room.
“Do you want to stop? Or slow down?” Dean asked, no judgement or disappointment in his voice, just his hands running a continual soothing path along his back.
(See the end of the chapter for
Cas moved to stand next to Dean, and Dean instinctively turned his face into the soft cotton of Cas’ t-shirt. They stayed like that for a while in the comfortable silence that sometimes enveloped them, Dean holding onto his life raft, when suddenly Cas’ breathing hitched.
Dean took a deep breath and, following the same instinct that had had him cupping Cas’ cheek earlier, got up from the bed and dropped to his knees in front of Cas, planting his arms on either side of Cas’ lap. Dean looked up at him, “And I should have said it years ago, I know that … I know that now, but I didn’t know how to say it, or when to say it. Even after everything… after everything we’d been through, I couldn’t find the courage… I could hardly admit it to myself. I could not admit that I needed you, that I wanted you around, wanted to love you and be loved by you. But, I can now. I understand now.  Castiel, I love you. Of course, I love you man. You mean everything to me Cas, everything. And I would die for you and I would live for you. And I’m sorry that I never said it before. I’m sorry that you died three times without having heard it. But I’m saying it now. I’m so stupidly, irrationally and probably co-dependently in love with everything you are.”
“If you don’t need calming down when working on a Saturday, I think it makes more sense for you to be a patient here, rather than a nurse,” Dean admitted. He had worked almost every Saturday for years now, and it never failed to be a horrific experience.
So, that is how he found himself staring at the wall silently as the hospital porter walked in with the wheelchair early Saturday morning.
Dean looked directly at Cas.
I really wanted to thank you all for reading this story and interacting with it. Both the voiced and silent support is so appreciated!  So from the bottom of my heart, thank you.
“I am hoping that the profanity means you enjoyed yourself,”
Dean’s voice was barely above a whisper by the end, but it seemed to echo in the otherwise deathly silent room. Cas waited for exactly two heartbeats after Dean finished speaking before sliding off the couch to join Dean on the floor, but still bracketed by Dean’s arms. The new position had Dean’s hands on either side of Cas’s head, but still gripping on to the couch. Cas gingerly lifted his own hands, placing them on Dean’s waist. Dean inhaled at the touch, even if they were separated by layers of flannel.
Castiel rubbed at his forehead, “They didn’t even come to the hospital.
Stay safe and have a great week!
Dean looked at him, really looked at him, trying to make sense of his words. Cas must have noticed his expression because his face lit up with a soft smile.
Cas coughed twice, inhaled in that broken, wheezy way before saying: “Asthma attack. I can’t –“ another spluttering cough, “I can’t find my inhaler.”
Cas turned. Dean was in his doorway, his eyes wide and his breathing shallow.
But, Meg consistently came back, week after week, and with each visit from her, the visits with the monster in his head lessened in both frequency and severity. And he was pleasantly surprised to find that, although he felt a little hollow after they were gone, the warm glow of their company remained and that he looked forward to their visit next week instead of wallowing in their absence.
“One month,” Dean said as he hugged Jack again. Eileen, Sam and Cas followed suit and all gave the young god farewell-for-now hugs.
There was another silence.
“So, he’s alive. That’s good, isn’t it?” Castiel asked.
By the time the four of them were back in the bunker, Dean felt as if he had just run a marathon. Which, he may as well have. His arm, where Cas was, was burning hot.  Sam was back next to Eileen, their arms around each other.
Cas followed him, never rushing, just going with the pace Dean set.
Dean eyed Castiel blearily. The former angel was standing with his arms crossed over his chest and was leaning against the door frame, effectively blocking Dean from entering their shared motel room.
the answers Cas had.
Castiel knew this, and his heart broke because of it. He couldn’t begin to fathom what Dean was going through. And he knew no matter how much work Dean had done, how much he had improved himself, his
“What?” He snapped but was unable to stop his pacing.
“Ah, yes,” Cas smiled, “As you can see, it is not quite teeming with members.”
He has told Missouri about these events though. She gave him some techniques to calm himself and the painful thud of his overworking heart when he awoke in these states.
“So,” Dean started, but then got stuck. How on Earth was he supposed to start this, voice these thoughts? He had spent the better part of the past four decades avoiding any situation that would require this of him, literally only ever tapping into this side of him when the world was fucking
Dean trembled as Castiel held him.
Dean caught one of his hands and placed a kiss to the center of his palm.
Dean’s throat suddenly turned to gravel, but he still managed to choke out, “Check the last page.”
“Okay, Sam do you remember telling me about the demon that was harvesting souls?”
“I’m not a doctor, but the first medication they had me on gave me such bad vertigo, I tripped over my own feet for a week. Sometimes, the drugs have very strange side effects. Did you tell Missouri about it in your session?”
Dean nodded twice and then spun on his heel, but instead of heading to the doors leading out of the room he headed towards the doors leading to the kitchen. He didn’t look back, his heart racing as he walked through the doorway and stopped in front of the counters that had everything he requested from Charlie, and right in the center was the most important thing: fresh honey.
“I don’t care,” Dean breathed as he reached for the zipper on Cas’ hoodie.
The ASL books that Dean found in Sam’s room suddenly made sense.
So instead, Dean kissed him. He pulled Cas in and grasped his jaw in both hands as he crushed their mouths together. And he hoped - no, he prayed -  he
“But, we can still sleep together. Like, actually sleep… if you want?”
“To be honest, I am far sleepier than I anticipated I would be,” Castiel admitted as he ran a hand through his hair.
Dean remembered how Cas liked to mark him up, leaving a smattering of purple bruises in the wake of his beautifully sinful mouth. He remembered how tight Cas had held onto him the first time they slept together, how there was a distinctive hand-shaped bruise on his right shoulder for
Doubt and anguish.
Castiel cleared his throat and nodded weakly.
“Cas, I need you.” Dean started, and suddenly the barrier that had been silencing him for so long crumbled as he looked at the angel who had died for him. And, all of a sudden, Dean found that he could not stop talking.
Cas twisted slightly to kiss his forehead before resting his head on Dean’s.
printed in matte gold, the font very elegant.
Have a lovely week everyone! Stay safe out there.
If they even got that, because that was the total time awarded to visitors. And, when Dean remembered, he would want to see and speak to Sam, Bobby and Ellen as well. But, Castiel would make the most of it, call and visit as often as Dean would let him.
“If you’re open to it,” Dean shrugged, fully committed to the shit show that was his nonchalance act, “I’ve already cleared it with Charlie.”
“Sure it does,” Dean countered with a smile.
“No, you will stay here for another forty-eight hours so we can just monitor your lungs, burns and those pesky cracked ribs.”
“Oh my god,” Claire groaned as she bit into the pie, “oh my god, this is amazing.”
“Uh, we got into a big argument the other night and after, well I, uh – “
“Dean,” Castiel said gently, sitting himself up so that he could take both of Dean’s hands in his, “I’m so sorry you went through that. And, whenever you want to talk, just know, I will listen.
Dean tried to nod, to speak, but he was frozen. He had been avoiding thinking about it all morning. He didn’t have the energy to have this conversation. He was barely keeping himself together as is, and he was meeting with Amara after breakfast. He didn’t have time to pick up the pieces that he would surely shatter into if he had to relive that night again before that meeting.
Bobby explained that when Sam was originally hospitalized, and for the seven weeks thereafter, he was in a vegetative, unresponsive state. However, in the last two weeks, his level of consciousness began to increase slightly, and had officially moved into what the doctor classified
This chapter officially signifies my longest fic to date, which I'm super excited about.
“I didn’t know you knew sign language,” Dean said when Cas’ hands stopped moving.
“Tape recorder,” she said casually. “A study published by Northwestern University has shown there might be a link between coma patients hearing familiar stories repeated by family members via recordings played over headphones and increased recovery rates. The theory behind it is that hearing voices that are deeply rooted in long term memory exercises the circuits in the brain responsible for long-term memories, and that stimulation can potentially help trigger the first glimmer of awareness.”
“Dean, stop!” Sam cried behind him. But he could not, he would not. It felt so good, the agony in his shoulder and the agony in his fist as it continually connected with the rough bark were focal points, pulling him out of the tidal wave of emotions flooding through him. Dean did not know how to deal with the emotions eating at him, but he knew how to handle the physical sensations. He hit the tree another time, and he felt the bones splinter, the sound seeming to echo in the quiet night. But before he could hit it again, Sam grabbed him and pulled him back roughly.
“You are mine Dean. In every sense of the word. And I am yours. You belong to me and I have always, always belonged to you.” Cas said between kisses and sinful licks down his chest and occasionally using his teeth.
I hope that you all had a fantastic week and that everyone is staying safe :)
“Come,” Cas said eventually, pulling Dean towards the bed.
“I feel different, something feels wrong. There’s this sadness inside me, this dark feeling. And I don’t know when it’s gonna rear its head. I don’t feel like me. I don’t want Sam to see me like that.” The truth cost him something; he felt a wave of exhaustion threaten to crash over him.
“I don’t recommend that,” she had responded.
But rolling his eyes meant he remembered,  that he cared about Cas’ annoying coffee order. Which he just didn’t.
And for the first time, when Dean now considered his future, he didn’t feel terrified. He didn’t feel trapped.
The transition between the two thoughts took much longer than it should have. And he got stuck on the second one. He knew he was gaping, but he seemed unable to get the command for his mouth to close from his brain to his face, the neural message getting stuck in the sludgy disbelief currently coating the inside of his head.
He felt Dean nod against him and then he started reading: “
Dean nodded, “Okay.”
Dean wanted to bang his brains out against the wall when, for the umpteenth time, he was treated to a highlights reel of his and Cas’ relationship. He thought of how Cas, in nothing but his boxer briefs, used to sit on the kitchen counter while Dean cooked, how he always tackled Dean into bear hugs when Dean passed his exams, how he almost burnt down his off-campus apartment in their junior year trying to make chicken soup for Dean when he got the flu.
posted on social media. Not that Dean knew from frequent checking or anything. So, of course, when he did post, Dean would be curious. It was human nature: a very natural, very rational reaction.
“What am I supposed to do?” Dean breathed out, and Sam tightened his hand on his shoulder.
“You can take a swing if it will make you feel better, if you want to hurt me,” Cas said as neutrally as he could, but he heard the way his words shook.
“Look, everything, at this moment, is
“You think… he.. with like me or whatever?” Dean asked cringing slightly. Cas’ confession was one thing. But having further proof of Cas' feelings, of his inability to notice….
He felt the dip in the mattress as Dean sat down next to him. “How are you feeling?”
“I don’t think going door to door in an isolation facility is allowed,” Cas tried to reason with Dean.
“Dean, those first few days after the car accident, you were in and out of consciousness a lot. You said a lot of things about what happened with your father; what happened in the car; your decision to end both of your lives…”
But he tried.
“But there’s no point trying to set a broken bone if the leg is still bleeding. Some things need to be dealt with
“Jack’s gone?” Cas asked.
“Kitchen,” Sam ordered and luckily Dean did not put up a fight. When they arrived, Sam pulled a beer out of the fridge and grabbed the first aid kit. He plunked the beer down in front of his brother who opened it absent mindedly.
“I need him too,” he finally admitted.
“I mean, there is nothing more attractive than a man on the brink of collapse.”
“Come,” Cas said, reaching under the bed to grab Dean’s discarded boxers and throwing it at Dean.
“That sounds very difficult. It sounds like you’re under a lot of pressure.”
Sam and Eileen both let out humorless chuckles. “Yeah. Understatement of the century, I’d say,” Sam responded as he cleared the mugs from the table and started filling the sink with water.
“Better yet, we have a plan,” Eileen smiled and tapped the pages.
“Used to?” Cas questioned, resting his hand on Dean’s thigh. They were quiet for a moment, and Cas gently started tracing patterns on Dean’s leg with his fingertips.
“Who was he then?” Castiel asked, lifting his head up to look at Dean.
“Well, I’m beat.” Eileen said. “I’m going to shower and head to bed.”
Dean pulled back reluctantly and dropped his arms. He looked to Cas. He wanted to say something. He wanted to say everything. He wanted his words to be an avalanche that drowned Cas to make up for those crucial minutes in which he was silent. But instead, “How the fuck could you do that to me Cas?” erupted from him.
“Can I come in?” Gabriel asked. Castiel gestured him in with his hand loosely and dropped his arm back to the mattress.
“John came home unexpectedly,” Dean explained, “He’d been in my apartment for a couple of days. He got violent, as he usually did, and Sam saw.”
“Just a minute, just changing,” Castiel called as he hurriedly threw on some clothes.
So that's the end of the story ladies and gentleman.
“Castiel,” Gabriel started. Castiel jumped a bit; he so seldomly used his full name. “I really don’t think that you should see them.”
Dean rolled his eyes playfully, and then nodded.
“Sammy, as you pointed out, it’s been five years. I’ve had two serious relationships since then. I’ve moved on. Literally, he doesn’t affect me.”
due to the delays from his first flight. He hadn’t even had time to buy a proper coffee, as he could barely stomach the dishwater that passed for coffee on flights, before the final call for his flight was announced. This six-hour journey did not have a screaming baby, but it did have a super-chatty seatmate named Becky. Becky was not able to pick up on Castiel’s aggressive indifference to her stories and his utter lack of interest in her love life, which she spoke about with very little filter or restraint. And in detail. Graphic detail. Cas didn’t want to be rude, but the fact that he had been awake for over twenty four hours was wearing on his already limited social skills.
“Yeah okay, tell me,” Dean conceded, happy that he did not have to speak anymore.
Dean couldn’t focus on that. Not right now. Not when he couldn’t get answers.
“Dean,” the woman interrupted, “It was a car accident, and as I mentioned earlier, your brother wasn’t in the car. It was you and your father in the car.”
The title of this chapter comes from the song
“Dean, I –“Cas tried, but Dean interrupted him.
TW for this chapter: internalized homophobia and discussion of suicidal thoughts.
“What happened?” Sam asked after he took another swallow.
“Yeah, she explained what happened yesterday. So, we’ve scheduled an extra session with Pamela on Monday.”
Castiel sat up and crossed his legs underneath him as he thought about his answer. Dean noticed that he tugged at the dark strands of his hair and chewed his lower lip as he pondered. Dean raised out of his crouched position and moved onto the bed, so that he was seated in such a way that he was face-to-face with Castiel.
Castiel knew that they should probably rejoin the others in the main hall, that Dean should be getting back to the fishbowl, that he needed to get to his room and finish the assignment. He knew, but didn’t care.
It started as a soft scrambling noise on the other side of the wall that divided his and Cas’ rooms. But then, the scrambling turned insistent, louder. It sounded like Cas was throwing things around his room. Dean locked his phone again and hesitantly stood up.
There was a beat before, “I’m in the Empty.”
“That’s barbaric,” Dean huffed, “fucking humans, man.”
“What?” Cas asked, alarmed.
“I missed you too,” Dean whispered and leaned in again.
even when it was difficult.
Dean let out an explosive breath and then nodded.
Castiel’s eyes darted to the door, the last place he had seen Dean.
“Afraid so,” Castiel responded, “The name Dean Winchester has been the talk of the town. Or mental ward, if you will.”
“Monday.”
Dean was seconds away from deepening the kiss when he heard someone clearing their throat. Dean’s eyes snapped open, and he took a step back sheepishly.
“What I mean is,” Sam leaned back, clearly choosing his words carefully, “Nothing about how you guys ended sat right with me, Dean. The more I thought about it, the less it made sense. The reasons he gave you just – I don’t know. The thing is, you were so obviously everything to him. The way you guys were together, the way he looked at you –" Sam shrugged. “It just didn’t make any sense.”
And then it hits him again.
“Save it, Castiel. Thank you for dinner,” Dean pushed away from the table.
“Dean?” Castiel whispered, his heart beating painfully in his throat, old lies trying to break into his mind, trying to break him away from this moment. But how could Castiel focus on anything else, worry about
Dean was anxious to get back to Cas.
“No, everyone’s always ready for bacon,” Dean said smiling, “except Sammy, of course, stupid kid. I mean, are you ready for your life story thing today?”
“I understand,” Eileen said kindly, “If it were me…” she trailed off, eyes darting to Sam, “I can’t imagine what you must be going through”.
He sat up and eyed his brother who smiled softly. “Fair enough.”
In a way that was far more urgent than sexy, Castiel gripped the bottom of Dean’s shirt and ripped it over his head before pushing him flat onto his back. He fell forward, ungracefully, and attached himself to Dean’s neck, licking a long stipe before gently grazing his teeth over it. Not enough to leave a mark, but enough to threaten one. As Castiel continued kissing the column of his throat, all that was flashing in his mind was one word, an echo in his brain:
Castiel nodded. He, himself, had been admitted on a Monday, and Hannah, being the longest remaining patient here, would know these kinds of trends. By now, the van had pulled up to the reception building, and the vehicle had parked in such a way that it blocked the occupants completely from their view.
Okay, so the previous night had happened. Castiel bit down on the inside of his cheek to stop the humiliated groan that was building in the back of his throat. He shifted slightly, trying to find a way to extricate himself from Dean without waking him. But suddenly, Dean was sitting up, eyes wide but a little hazy, and Castiel almost tumbled off of the bed. Dean instinctively reached out and grabbed him before he fell.
“Well, I do. I speak to Charlie after every visit,” she admits vaguely.
“If you don’t get yourself caffeinated in the next five minutes, I’m requesting a new roommate,” Castiel warned as he tied his shoes.
But these urges came and went, coming in and drawing back like tides. And, all that aside, he mostly just felt okay. Relieved. He even liked getting to know the other patients, particularly the red-headed woman from Scotland, Rowena. She was a practicing wiccan, and she spent quite a lot of time explaining different symbols and star alignments to Dean. Dean understood exactly zero of what she was saying, but she was interesting, and Dean always liked people who were like her – people who were unapologetically themselves.
He had heard Sam’s laugh of pure disbelief when Eileen has crashed through the front door on the first day. Dean had stayed in hermit mode. He had heard Sam talking louder than normal, in the way he usually did when he was excited. Ddean was happy that they had managed to find their way back to each other after everything, truly he was, and, although, he felt like a dick for not answering the door when Eileen had knocked that first night, he was not ready to be faced with such unadulterated happiness when it felt like he would never be able to drag himself out of the darkness that had settled within the four walls of his room. Therefore, for two days, he stared at the ceiling and the walls. When he was in a particular mood to punish himself, he would roll over to the bedside table on the other side of the bed, where he kept a very small collection of photos. When he had originally moved into the bunker, the photos were of his parents and Sam, but in the years since he had added photos of his found family too. There were photos of Bobby, Charlie, Kevin, Jack and … and Cas.
thoughts that were screaming at him, took a deep breath and scooted closer to Dean. Dean gave him a questioning look, but Castiel did not stop. He pushed himself onto his knees and then swung one leg over Dean’s lap, so that he was straddling his thighs. Dean’s eyes blew wide, and the verdant of them glinted in a way that shot electricity straight through Castiel. Dean settled his hands in the cradles of Castiel’s hips, his fingers flexing as he pulled Castiel closer. Castiel’s heart was trying to beat out of his chest, his entire body was
“Does the outside world scare him?”
“What were you dreaming about?” Cas asked, lazily drawing pictures with his thumb on Dean’s neck. But Dean could see the worry there: the slight furrow of Cas’ brows, the searching look in his eyes.
Dean sighed, running his hands over his eyes.
“That makes sense, Dean. It is, however, often the things we are most frightened to unpack that are the most important for us to talk about.”
“Legally, Dean Winchester is dead. And legally, I am Jimmy Novak.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Dean smiled, “It’s been you and me through this whole amazing, beautiful life.”
And some days, reality looked like a distant memory, whether it was talking about fantasy stories or the heists that were being run in the hospital. He kept whispering conspiratorially about the nurses. For three days, he was convinced the nurses were cutting his hair in his sleep and selling it on the black market. He also thought they were stealing his blood to drink at their parties. He was more concerned about the hair, though. Obviously.
The words had barely settled between them before Dean surged forward again, kissing him deep and hungry and perfect.
As always, a wonderful thank you to my beta reader, Hellbreaker42 for his feedback and assistance. I appreciate you!
The album all the photos came from was labelled
Chapter tags/content warnings: mentions of homophobic parents (not Dean's or Cas'), masturbation, Dean lashing out at Cas, insomnia.
“What?”  He asked, perplexed.
“There is a lot we need to address there. Firstly, Dean, we are fine. You and I are completely okay. Secondly, Sam is alive. You have spent your whole life protecting him. You kept him fed and educated and safe. You didn’t let him down. John did. John failed him. Okay?”
Dean stood up and shoved his hands into his pockets, rolling his eyes and gritting his teeth as the pain laddered up his sides. He tried to keep the smile in place as he followed her into the room. Missouri sat down on one couch, and indicated that Dean should do the same on the other couch in the room, which was only a slightly less aggressive shade of yellow than the one outside.
“Let’s make some coffee,” Sam said running a hand through Jack’s hair, the kid smiling fondly “and then we will tell you everything.”
But most importantly, he was with Castiel.
Castiel nodded and Dean reached over to switch off the light. The two moved, slotting together like puzzle pieces, Castiel’s chest warm against Dean’s back, his arm thrown possessively around Dean’s midsection. Cas held him so close, no air could flow between them.
“What do you want, Dean?” Cas demanded, louder.
It was a difficult afternoon, but a healing one too.
“What’s happening?” Cas asked, his voice caused Dean to break out into goosebumps.
Cas and Dean both stripped down to their boxers before Cas climbed into the bed and gently pulled Dean in after him. The last thing he felt was Cas pulling Dean into him, fitting his chest to Dean’s back.
“If there is a secret club, it is highly unpopular. It is just me, watching the sunrise,” Castiel said as he picked up one of Dean’s shirts from a stack on the floor, he now knew which of Dean's piles were
“I – uh, I have a call with Sam soon. So, I should, you know shower and stuff,” Dean spluttered out eventually, when the tension in the room became so thick Dean felt like he would choke on it.
Secondly, the country where I live is having a really bad wave of COVID-19 at the moment, so I've been in isolation for over a week now due to exposure (but thankfully, it seems that I did not catch it). This did, however, leave me with a lot of time to write. So today, as it is about halfway through the story, I am going to do a duel update. I'm posting Chapter 7 now and will be posting chapter 8 later today.
Nope.
The title of this chapter comes from the song
“Nothing, really, I’m fine,” Castiel smiled through his tears, “I promise. I just had an overwhelming rush of love for you.” Whatever Meg had been expecting it was not that. Her eyebrows furrowed as she squinted at him.
“Dude, you’ve been so out of it ever since you came back from your visitation thing.”
“One month,” Jack said and with a loud flap of wings he was gone.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I don’t know anything about you except your name,” Castiel said as they were walking, “but to ensure we are on even ground, my name is Castiel Novak.”
Cas smiled at Sam and turned to look at Eileen, who was rubbing Jack’s shoulder as he huddled against her. Castiel did not know her well, but he smiled warmly at her and she returned it.
The words weren’t accusatory, but even Dean could hear how the betrayal he felt leaked into the syllables.
“Dean,” Sam said softly, “pull over man.”
Cas cursed loudly as the boiling water sloshed over the rim of the pot and burned the skin on the back of his hand. He switched off the heat on the stove and moved the pot to a cool plate before running his hand under cold water in the basin.
Dean turned away from where his face was pressed into Cas’ chest to look at him and Cas’ eyes were wide. “Dean…”
“She’s worse than the most annoying alarm clock sound I’ve ever heard,” Dean groaned as he rolled his neck.
“Exasperation?” Dean asked, mock-hurt. His heart was beating loudly, Cas’ words doing something to him - his fucking skin felt alive.
“No, she understands,” Jack replied, “She is disappointed in him. But she would protect the legacy he created before he forgot himself.”
. It held too much weight. It would open up a door that Dean wouldn’t know how to close.
“Dean, you didn’t,” Castiel said earnestly. He debated with himself for a few seconds before moving out of the crouch and sitting next to Dean on the bed. Dean shifted slightly, some of the tension bleeding out of him.
“Yeah,” Castiel felt shaky, “Do they want to come here?”
“Right,” Sam said, as he clapped his hands together and closed his eyes: “Jack, we really need to talk to you buddy. I know you were just here, but it would be great if you could come by. We won’t keep you long.”
“You didn’t have to come,” Castiel said as Meg reached for the bag that was resting next to the chair she had been seated in.
“Dean, do you know why Amara suggested you come here?”
of Castiel?
. He should still see them, right?
Stevie nodded twice and then immediately reached for the phone. Castiel bit back the urge to groan in frustration. Why wasn’t she going
back in, he seemed incapable of masking any of it. He did not have practice in masking how he felt, neutralizing his facial features. This resulted in him being extremely expressive, his heart on his sleeve and his thoughts splayed out in his face. Dean hadn’t told him any of this, enjoying the play of emotions on his features too much to make Castiel self-conscious about it. So even though it was evident that he was trying to seem impartial, his entire demeanor screamed distrust and frustration.
“Please, do come in.”
“No, you were in a car accident that caused
“What?” was the only thing he could say, staring at his younger brother who held his gaze evenly.
“I’m good with languages,” Cas shrugged.
He turned to face the bathroom when the water stopped running. Dean appeared in the doorway and leaned against it. He palmed the lower half of his face.
“What do you remember?”
Sam swallowed. “Sorta?”
“I was today. And I am, now.” Cas sounded surprised.
“You make me happy Cas. And you make me feel unburdened.”
“I was so angry, Cas, I just wanted him to suffer. I wanted him to feel the pain I was feeling. The pain he had caused. So I…”
Dean walked into their en-suite to change out of his sweats and into jeans. He also decided to wash his face while he was there.
“Hello Dean”
“Dean…” Cas tried again, but Dean kissed him once more, swallowing the sounds. He gripped Cas shoulder’s tightly as he brought his head down to suck on Cas’ neck and graze his teeth along the column of his throat. Dean inhaled as he nosed the hollow behind Cas' ear.
“You’re drunk.”
I hope you enjoy this chapter.
“What?” Dean asked, his voice rough.
Dean remained silent; the word felt
I know I published this on a Saturday, but from next week, the weekly chapters will be uploaded on a Sunday. The story will be eight chapters long and have an epilogue.
“Well, that is why I’m here,” Dean heard Amara’s voice. He twisted in his seat. There she was, standing in the doorway. Her dark hair loose around her shoulders. A white-hot anger pulsed through Dean the second he made eye contact with her. Resentment and betrayal burned in the back of his throat as she strode towards them. By the time she was seated on the chair directly opposite to his, he was shaking.
Castiel had asked Meg not to worry him, but she had given him her patented “shut the fuck up, you idiot” look, and he had done just that. He owed Meg so much; he would not argue with her unnecessarily. According to Meg, as soon as she had told him what had happened, Gabriel had immediately booked his flight back to the US. But, there was only one day a week when visitors were allowed, so he hasn’t seen him yet. Meg had, during his allocated phone time, told him that Gabriel was in Kansas and would be coming with her to see him on Saturday. Castiel tried to tell her that she didn’t have to come every week, that he didn’t want her to feel obligated to drive to the middle of nowhere every Saturday for the remaining six weeks of his program, as she had done for the first six weeks. He had felt her “shut the fuck up look” through the phone. He had finally sighed after a lengthy silence and said that he would shut up. She had responded with “good, see you Saturday.”
“Jesus, Cas,” Dean breathed out shakily. He had come to understand that Cas was very open with how he felt, never trying to filter or dilute it. One night, after they had kissed long and deep and slow, while their limbs were still intertwined but before they slipped into their separate beds (which they did most nights, in case someone came in to their room during the night), Cas had whispered something to Dean that had him glowing scarlet from the mere rawness of it, the intensity of the blatant adoration. Cas had definitely noticed his reaction, and when Dean had tried to spit out a coherent response (which he wasn’t able to), Cas had traced his thumb along Dean’s bottom lip, which almost made Dean short-circuit and definitely did not help with him trying to come up with a reply. He had looked Dean dead in the eye and told him that he spent so many years running away from and denying what he felt, still fought voices that told him what he felt was wrong, and the only way he could make up for it was to say them plainly now whenever he felt them.
His last night, a warm and comforting Sunday evening, was spent reliving his highlights of the stay with all the residents. Dinner was a cacophony of people trying to talk over each other to share their favorite Castiel moment.
“There’s a lot in there,” Dean said, slightly self-consciously.
So instead, he decided to focus on Dean, who was curled up next to him on an overstuffed sofa, as they all watched
“Usually, people put their sheets and comforters on before they go to bed,” Gabriel scolded playfully.
And as the minutes bled into hours, Castiel’s anxiety had ricocheted in his chest, making it impossible for him to stay seated. At around midnight, he had given up trying to remain calm and just bolted for the nurse’s station. Stevie was there, and she seemed calm and collected as she typed something into her computer. Castiel felt slightly better and breathed slightly easier when he saw her serenely going about her work. It was likely just professionalism, but still. He needed calm then.
“I came back,” he whispered. “I can’t explain yet, but I will when I can. I promise. I need you to trust that I’m doing the best I can. I need you to trust that I’m trying. That I will keep trying to get you back with me. Back
Cas. I fucked up… I’m sorry. So goddamn sorry…  I know I ruined… but Cas… please don’t… you can’t… Cas, please don’t leave me. I’ll make it up to you, I will…”
“I don’t think there is one,” Cas said as he started kissing and biting Dean’s neck again. Dean groaned at the sensation.
“She is,” Castiel agreed, “but I’d rather have that than not have tacos.” Dean hummed his agreement, and the two of them climbed out of bed and straightened their clothes. Castiel, following a new instinct, grabbed Dean’s hand in his before they walked out.
“Yes, Dean. They said they would weeks ago,” Cas straightened Dean’s collar.
Cas was silent for a moment,
“Probably, but he could potentially hear me. We don’t know for sure.”
Which is what made this so much worse. This moment of inaction was not something he had anticipated. He assumed that when this moment came, he would be barreling through the door.
“Hell yeah we can wait a month if that means getting you back for good, ” Sam said smiling.
“Cas – “Dean tried, but he was interrupted.
Dean was less than enthusiastic about the fact that for the first two days, he would have to stay in a completely transparent box-type room. And, he had vocalized his disdain for this arrangement quite insistently as Amara handed him forms to sign.
“Okay,” Sam said, breaking the silence, “ready to strategize?”
“Trying to stay busy,” he responded, his tone not inviting any questions.
. He decided to go. People don’t leave those that are home to them.
“What do you mean?” Cas asked. Dean stilled next to him.
“Uh, your parents?” Her response came out as more of a question.
(See the end of the chapter for
“What did you do?”
?” Dean asked as he eyed the pile.
Dean spent most of the morning deflecting Cas’ questions about his plans for their open session. He wanted it to be a surprise, so he avoided answering these interrogations through his stealthy skills of deflection and redirection. Cas was getting entertainingly frustrated and continually made huffed sounds of exasperation which Dean pointedly ignored. He secretly loved it though.
by Kodaline.
What was it about the blanket of night that seemed to lower Dean’s defenses?
“Claire,” Castiel said in warning, when he noticed Dean stiffened beside him “be kind.”
“He’s a good person,” is all Castiel said as the three of them walked towards the visitor’s area.
He drew in a shaky breath when he felt more in control. “Nothing is more important to me. Sammy, there is nothing, past or present, that I would put in front of you. I need you to come back, okay? If not for you, then for me.”
“Is that so?”
Dean’s stomach recoiled. Bobby had been so excited about that event. Had mentioned it for months.
instead of a person. But now, it’s almost like you’re teaching me how to be human.”
He knew their story was over. Just because he held the memory of Cas as delicately as spun glass didn’t mean the memory would materialize into anything tangible.
“Do you have any other questions for me?” Amara asked as she leaned towards him.
“Well, it seems that every demon captive they took with fell asleep, like their life force fell asleep immediately upon entering the Empty. And even when they came back the demon never woke up. Nor the person they were possessing. They were alive, they just were not waking up. When they couldn’t find a way to wake up the innocent people being possessed after a few tries, they stopped the experiments. There was no real conclusion but a couple of the people working on it had a theory that once their consciousness was touched by the Empty, they got stuck with the side effects of being there. The Empty is a very old, very powerful cosmic entity, and it seems that once it touched a demon their consciousness was almost enslaved by it. And no one wakes up without the Empty relenting its grip.”
“Jesus Christ. You did what?” Dean’s airways constricted and the blood drained from his face. His reaction seemed to knock Cas out of whatever stupor he had been in. He resumed the gentle movements on Dean’s back, taking a deep exaggerated breath to remind Dean to do the same.
Castiel hated it.
The fact that Castiel was there, understanding him and feeling what he felt… Dean didn’t have the words to describe what that meant.
“Hello!” A cheery voice pulled Dean back into the present. And standing there, as if he had been doing that the whole goddam time, was Jack with his hand lifted in greeting.
, how he always stood a little too close and never asked for personal space anymore. He never mentioned how, when Cas disappeared for weeks on end, Dean would be moody at best and intolerable at worst, how during those times of absence, Sam would hear Dean in the
Lastly, thank you so much to you guys! To every single person who read, subscribed, left comments or kudos. I so appreciate it and your voiced and silent engagements have meant more to me than words can describe.
“What is it?”
Please see end notes for trigger and content warnings.
“Gabe?” Castiel asked.
Which, with Cas being so close and so obtuse, was completely fair. If Cas was going to say stupid and hurtful shit, then Dean was absolutely justified in his anger and throwing tantrums that put toddlers to shame. A better man would probably try to mend fences, try to see things from Cas’ perspective, but Dean has never claimed to be a better man.
At least for him.
“Yes, this happened. But it’s not currently happening. You’re asleep.” Dean replied, voice rough as he held on tighter to Cas’ shoulders.
Dean wiped his hand over his face, catching some stray tears before they managed to slip out of his burning eyes. He pushed himself up until he was seated against the headboard. He needed a distraction before he started crying in earnest. He wasn’t sure he would be able to live through the humiliation of Cas seeing him like that.
I just want to make it clear that my understanding of the US military is very limited to what is portrayed on screen, what is readily available on the internet and two conversations I had with an American friend. I do apologize if I got any of the nuances wrong!
Castiel just stared at her dumbly.
Cas was relieved when Dean told him that a plumber would be there soon. He did feel a little guilty about interacting with anyone before their isolation was over so, while they waited, he washed his cloth mask and took sanitizer to every surface in the room.
He hadn’t slept.
The chapter title is taken from the Mayday Parade song "Miserable at Best".
Sam rolled his eyes. “Dean, you swear like a trucker.”
Dean listened as the door closed with a subtle click. He wasted no time and walked towards the bathroom, stumbling a lot more than he thought he would. Once inside, he filled the basin with cold water. He splashed his face a couple of times, but eventually, he gave in and just submerged his face. The haziness lifted almost instantaneously. Dean towel dried his face as he heard the room door open and close, signaling Castiel’s return.
“Yes, you are. I have seen you stand so still I have literally confused you for a statue, but you have not stopped moving since you got in here,”
Dean glanced at him quickly and then looked back at the ceiling. “No, of course not. You could read out loud, you know, if you wanted to.”
“Yeah, we’re sorry about that, but we needed to talk to you urgently.” Sam said.
An oldie, but a goldie. So, that’s what he would do.
This is the last full chapter before the epilogue. I cannot believe it is over. I've been working on this for over five months and it seems  very strange to be saying goodbye to this world.
“Well, you were right,” Cas said.
Dean glared at him. Actually glared. And Cas felt the first sliver of irritation pierce through the bubble of shock. Did Dean think he was alone in this very complicated and stressful situation?  He wanted out too. Of course, he did. Sharing a space with Dean, being forced into close proximity with the now almost-stranger he was still in love with, was a very specific kind of torture, the type of torture he wasn’t sure he’d be able to survive.
“You don’t have to be good with words, Dean. You don’t get extra credit for phrasing things well. All you need to be is honest.”
“You know what, never mind,” Dean could feel his pulse hammering in the back of his throat. He wanted to lash out. He wanted to punch something. He wanted to kiss Cas with the same burning urgency as the previous night. But this time, he wanted to do it
Dean shot upright, sitting back against the headboard, “Cas. Hey.’”
“Not really,” he had admitted.
“May I ask how you ended up here?” Dean asked hesitantly.
Nothing excited him.
The laugh and the voice belonged to a petite red-headed woman who had just walked through the front door.
“Sam,” Dean said brokenly.
"Like Jody and Castiel were talking about yoga and art and whatever the fuck else."
“Fuck, angel, you’re going to destroy me, aren’t you?”
Dean Winchester did not leave his room for two days.
Of course, he didn’t.
“Yeah, I was anxious, but if he’s okay, then I’m alright,” Castiel shrugged as he got up.
“You’re not doing nothing,” Eileen says softly, “you’re getting yourself battle ready.”
“Yeah,” Dean replied, confused.
“Shut up,” Dean responded eloquently. Castiel laughed again, shutting the door gently.
He needed to act rationally.
Fuck, he’d missed that sound. It sent a rush of blanket-warm memories of the two of them, wrapped around each other sharing stories and jokes, through his entire being, freezing him in place.
“I need to chat to Charlie before we leave, and I think she needs to meet Gabriel, as well. And, you are going to keep us company on the walk to the nurse’s station.”
“We should talk,” Cas insisted, and to his surprise, Dean nodded.
Castiel exhaled for eight seconds. He repeated this for a while. And after every cycle, his breathing came easier, the constriction in his chest loosened.
“What? No, Dean…” Sam immediately countered.
. Castiel didn’t want any of what happened with their physical relationship to be tainted with the distress they were working through in their own lives, not when it was so new.
“You gonna tell me then, Shakespeare?” Dean asked as they deposited their dirty dishes in the sink.
“Already?” Dean asked, slightly incredulous, “What’s the refractory period for an angel?”
There had only been one new patient admitted, Ava Wilson, although there was talk (mostly fueled by Claire’s snooping) about another three that would be joining within the next two months. Castiel was next in line to be released. One week from tomorrow he would be getting into a car with Meg and driving away from these buildings that had housed him for three months.
It would just be
Thank you all so much for all the comments, kudos and hits! You have no idea how much it means to me. I love getting your feedback and any interaction literally makes my day.
“I’ll always come when you call,” Jack said simply, and Dean’s heart swelled up. The words so like the ones Cas had said to him so long ago. Everything was reminding him of Cas. He needed to get a fucking grip and he needed to do it quickly.
But avoidance was difficult when Cas’ trench coat was staring at him from the coat rack that was just a few feet away.
Cas shrugged. “I wanted to help.”
Not sure how to do trigger warnings exactly, but Sam does confront Dean on his suicidally reckless behavior in this chapter.
Another milestone in Dean’s life that Cas was to watch and not experience.
They walked to dinner together. And once they were there, they were immediately pulled into a heated debate about which tv shows were genre-defining. Castiel could contribute very little as his exposure to pop culture was limited, but he did enjoy watching Dean become increasingly animated and get actively involved in the conversation, yelling over Rowena and divulging into a heated debate about the nature of Spock and Kirk’s relationship, which Dean said was in ‘no fucking way platonic’, with Adam. Castiel held Dean’s hand under the table, and Dean hooked their ankles together.
Well wasn’t that just fan-fucking-tastic. He really doesn’t need to have the memory of this when he is forced to interact with Cas later.
“So, Saturday. Any visitors coming to see you?” Hannah asked.
After Dean had fled out of the room, Stevie had rushed after him. Castiel wanted to follow, but he was scared that his presence would exacerbate whatever demons Dean was busy facing. So, he had stayed in the room, hoping Dean would return when he was feeling more like himself.
Dean inhaled deeply through his nose. He moved away from Cas slightly and reached back into the basket and pulled out a deep blue notebook, with a golden bee on the cover.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Charlie,” Amara greeted her with a warm smile. Charlie replied with a smile in kind, the gesture lit up her entire face. Dean’s mouth twitched, despite himself. He got the feeling that Charlie was the type of person it was impossible not to like.
As the night started blurring into the early hours of the morning, he realized what the worst part was. The absolute worst part was watching himself, repeatedly, saying nothing. His silence was what hurt the most. He didn’t say it back. Dean jerked up, his mind trying to work through the smog of sleep deprivation. Had he ever said it? Had he ever told Cas he loved him? Even in a platonic, brotherly way? The answer burned its way into his consciousness – the fog around his brain dissipating instantly.
Dean was quiet for a while as he filtered through as many memories of Cas that he could grip onto and tried to see them through the filter of what he had just learned. Something inside him was shifting and he suddenly felt off kilter.
“Before we go,” Cas said, stopping in the doorway, “I think I need to heal those.”
Cas left him, broke his heart, and vanished out of his life
Dean was so lost in thought, and fucking
And the worst part was that he
“No, of course not. If Dean’s important to you, he’s important to me,” Gabriel grabbed his phone. “I’m going to text her now and set up a meeting for later this week.”
Cas sighed, long and defeated, “I hurt you.”
Thank you so much to everyone who has interacted in any way with this fic! I appreciate you taking time from your days to read this!
The three hunters and the angel jumped up and there was a flurry of hugs and hair ruffles. Jack beamed at them.
However, there will be a short epilogue posted soon.
“I need to stop the bleeding,” Dean whispered, remembering Castiel’s words.
– know how to give up his home.
Dean still had three weeks, so when Castiel was released, he would have to remain for another two, and although Castiel knew he was exactly where he needed to be, the idea of Dean being alone if…
So as we say goodbye to this story I have a couple of things I wanted to say:
“It’s quite a lot of work and needs some cosmic restructuring. And I would like to help Amara finish this. But when it’s done. I’ll come back and release Amara and the light.”
“Okay,” Amara said, as she handed Charlie all the signed forms, “I have to go now, but I will be back in a week to check on you.”
Dean looked dubious, but at Castiel’s incessant stare, he bowed his head in acceptance. Castiel knew Dean didn’t believe him, but he also knew that, for now, this was the best he could hope for.
“Wait, you’re staying in Kansas?”
Dean inhaled sharply at the sight.
“Well, to be fair, I’d be the one behind you.”
“Just for now, I don’t want this to go further before I can be completely honest with you. Before I’m able to finally have you in my bed, waking up next to me, my face being the first thing you see every morning, and with no threat of separation looming over us.”
Castiel felt sleep tugging him under. Even when he went with it, however, he slept fitfully and couldn’t seem to make the final plunge into restful sleep.
“Has there been any developments with Sam?” Dean asked eventually.
Hey there everyone!
Maybe he had struggled to sleep last night too.
was a bucket of ice water. His reality dawned on him. It threatened to drown him. This was ridiculous. He wasn’t making money, he wasn’t paying bills, in fact, he was probably racking up mountains of debt with his stay at a place like this. Fuck, he hadn’t even thought about the hospital bills from after the accident, apparently, for both him and John.
Because he doesn’t have to hide or be something he’s not.”
Dean nodded and stared into the eyes he never really stopped seeing. And then, Dean found himself leaning forward, his lips a breath away from Castiel’s.
And as Dean pulled away slightly, but not far enough away as to break the contact between their foreheads, he slipped the ring onto Cas’ finger.
And so, within a month of Cas bringing it up for the first time, the Winchester brothers moved in. Dean moved into Cas’ room with him, and Sam took the spare room.
Cas stared at him for a minute, “What’s so funny?”
But Dean didn’t want
“I have only known you for a week, that’s true,” Castiel whispered, “but we have spent more time together than I have with almost anyone else in my life.” He moved the fingers of one hand into Dean’s hair, carding it through the dark gold strands. “And from what I can tell, you are one of the most selfless people I have ever met, one of the most compassionate and kind human beings,” he moved the hand not currently knotted in Dean’s hair to caress his cheek.
“How are you doing there?” Sam asked, immediately cutting through the small talk.
Meg was the Atlas holding up his cracked and run-down world already. He would not add to that, because he knew she would try to be everything he needed her to be. He knew this because if the situation were reversed, he would do the same for her. He would contort himself into any shape, any form, that kept her alive.
TW: Hints at Castiel's past suicide attempt.
“I am,” Dean replied, and because his luck apparently sucks, he stumbled over his own feet a record-breaking three times before landing heavily on his bed. This time, he plopped down onto the foot of the bed.
“I need to find Amara,” Dean repeated. No inflection, nothing but neutral. Castiel would have been concerned about the extreme change in emotion if it weren’t for the look in Dean’s eyes. His entire voice screamed indifference, but there was something brewing in his eyes, something behind the vacant look that had settled on his face.
Dean nodded tightly. “But he’s still in a coma.”
“Good Morning, Dean,” Amara greeted him, as Marve brought the chair to a stop by the hospital front doors, “Ready to go?”
“What makes you think I need calming down?” Charlie challenged; one eyebrow raised comically high.
He knew all of this.
So, all in all, most parts of his days were spent in the company of a lot of other people, which meant that Cas and Dean only ever spent the last hours of the nights alone together. And in those moments, they spoke about everything. They spoke of things as delightfully dull as the weather, and then, they spoke of the things that Dean never thought he would be able to voice – the blanket of night seemed to infuse their room with a warm sense of safety.
Who he was with Cas, the life he had just started glimpsing with him, it was what Dean had always wanted.  He felt like moving past it would be like removing the importance of that time. As if by trying to forget the small details he was bleaching not only his memories, but the significance of their lives together. And he just couldn’t do that.
Cas leaned forward and placed a soft kiss in his hairline before resting their foreheads together. “We’ll get through this, okay? Whatever you need from me, I’ll do.”
“May I ask you something, Dean?”
with his excitement for Castiel.
They would have a cat that he named Catstiel. Dean would wear a ring Cas had bought for him. They would have two kids. Dean would cook, and Cas would clean. They would fuck almost every night. Sometimes it would be fast and dirty, the kind of sex that ended with Dean biting into his shoulder, marking Cas as
He continued working Dean as Dean fumbled Cas out of his slacks. The second Dean touched him, his vision abruptly went hazy.
“Dean, he’s not – “
“I did, but as mentioned before, I cannot vouch for it in terms of taste.”
Castiel grabbed the book and walked over to Dean’s bed.
“Dean Winchester, right?” She offered in greeting, “The man with the memory gap.”
“May I ask you something that’s unrelated?” Castiel asked, hugging his knees to his chest.
Cas stroked Dean a couple of times, as he cupped Dean’s neck with his free hand, running the pad of his thumb over his Adam’s apple.
and yet he still didn’t have him back. He was still on his knees next to the bed. Dean dropped his eyes back to the sleeping angel and he had to fight a very new and confusing urge to fit himself in next to Cas, to tuck his face into the crevice of the angel’s neck and relish in the feel of Cas’ skin against his cheek. Dean felt himself flush and then quickly shook his head, as if the action itself could clear the very perplexing thoughts currently short circuiting the wiring in his brain. The idea never left his head but seeing as it would be highly uncomfortable to climb into bed with his best friend while his son, his brother and his brother’s girlfriend are all within a two feet radius, he settled for placing his hand directly next to Cas’ on the comforter, their pinky fingers almost touching.
“What are you doing here?” Dean asked.
“It seems like you have all had a very eventful couple of weeks,” Cas said into the lingering silence.
His voice dropped at the end.
The only other person who was as removed from all of the righteous indignation that games night brought out in most of the residents, was Jody. She, like Castiel, was just watching the scene unfold before her with a fond smile tugging at her lips. Castiel often found her watching Claire closely in particular. Castiel knew that Jody really worried for her, that she saw her daughter, Alex, in this damaged but fierce young woman.
Given that Castiel has been at
“You’re not. Not ever. For a long time, I did not believe there would be anyone who I would want to spend this time with. But I do with you. Everything with you just seems better, brighter, more colorful.”
“I’m sorry that you went through that, Dean,” Castiel said softly. His baritone voice washed over Dean.
“I need to find Amara,” Dean’s voice sounded shredded, broken.
Cas grabbed Dean’s shoulders, spun him slightly and shoved him backwards until Dean’s back hit the wall. Dean’s hands automatically wove through Cas’ hair and tugged him closer. Cas’ lips met his at the same moment as his hands gripped his hips. Cas kissed Dean breathless, as he so often did.
Cas took the book gingerly.
They had never spoken about it, but Sam had known for a while that the way Dean felt about Cas was more than what he actively led on, it was more profound. Sam never told Dean that he noticed when Dean’s eyes followed Cas around the room like he was Dean’s
“Cas, are you okay?”
“Cas. That’s it. I’ve needed you for so long, longer than I even admitted to myself. And at first I thought it was in the same way I needed Sam, because that’s the only way I’ve ever needed anyone. But I started realizing that it was more than that. I started realizing this slowly, and mostly when I’d been drinking. And just when I was starting to understand what I felt for you… Lucifer killed you. And you were just
that he thought he would burst out of his skin.
“Well, angry sex is hot. I get it,” Eileen said calmly.
That night, as Dean was getting settled into the bed that was
“What?” Cas asked, slightly too defensively. His voice sounded strained to his own ears.
“Oh and Cas?” He called, “We never had this conversation okay?”
“Yeah, of course, Cassie. Shoot,” Gabriel leaned forward.
“Yeah?”
“Running right towards you,” Dean whispered.
Thank you, as always, to the absolutely wonderful Hellbreaker42 for beta-ing this work. I appreciate you so much :)<3
He blinked heavily a couple of times, his eyes unfocused.
Castiel frowned; it was highly unusual for the owner of this place to actually come by. She mostly left the day-to-day running of the facility to Charlie. Castiel had, in fact, only spoken to her once, the day he was moved here from the hospital. She had knocked on his hospital door while he had been packing up. He hadn’t seen her since.
Dean nodded at her again, she smiled softly and then was gone.
“You do?”
I really wanted to address the way Dean had acted towards Jack in the final season. It was very out of character, in my opinion, and I do believe that Dean would want to make up for the way he treated our favorite Nephilim.
“Dean… I can’t… This… this is one of the most thoughtful things anyone has ever done for me,” Cas' voice seemed to waver a bit. Dean finally turned to look at him. Cas’ eyes shone, his hands were fluttering at his sides, and he swallowed heavily.
night, he’d looked at Cas in shock, in pain, in heartbreak. But not like this. Never like this.
Cas sighed, looking a little defeated. “Of course.”
. You fucking left me broken and without looking back. It destroyed me, Cas, totally obliterated me. So no, I’m not going to sit and fucking have dinner with you like that never happened. I don’t want to do that. I won’t do that. I – I can’t do that.”
“Good morning to you, Dean,” Castiel greeted, smiling affectionately at the man sprawled out on his own bed as if his limbs were trying to find the ways in which to touch most of the surface area of the blanket.
She nodded again and smiled thankfully at him as he took his seat next to Dean.
“That’s why you asked what the last thing I remembered was,” Dean said softly.
Thank you so much to Hellbreaker42 for all his help with this fic. You've been amazing!
“Dean?”
Dean felt an overwhelming wave of gratitude for Bobby in that moment, nearly drowning with the weight of the emotion.
Castiel walked slowly through the halls that he has become so accustomed to, and before he reached the reception area, he tugged his hoodie sleeves lower, grasping the edges tightly with his fingers. He spotted Meg immediately after he entered through the doors leading into the reception area, where all visitors had to wait after signing in. Her hair was loose, and there were dark, purple shadows under her eyes. Castiel noticed she was biting at the nail of her thumb anxiously as she stared at her phone. Castiel darted his eyes around the room, not admitting to himself that he was looking for Gabriel. And, when he couldn’t see him, he continued with the internal denial and didn’t think about how much pain that disappointment caused him.
Cas had only seen Sam awake a handful of times, and mostly during those times, Sam tried to convince Dean to pray to him as he was, “obviously, an
He focused all his energy on the contact, focused on the feel of each individual fingerprint as it rested against his cheekbone.
He shut the door quickly, the thud of it echoing through the apartment.
and …” Cas trailed off. He darted his eyes to Dean.
Castiel turned to look at him. Dean was staring at the ceiling, his cheeks dusted with a light blush that was barely visible in the dark room. He was using that voice he used when he really wanted something but wanted to seem like he didn’t.
His frown deepened. “You actually cooked? You?”
Dean pouted for a second and then exhaled dramatically, “Fine, but I have no idea how I’m gonna keep my hands off you now that I’ve had a taste.”
“Yeah, Cas. We do, but I can’t now. Just not right now. I need time –“
“Dean,” an urgent voice murmured in his ear. “Dean, wake up,” the voice seemed more urgent, and this time it was accompanied by a shaking that jolted Dean awake. His eyes flew open as he jerked up, the sheets of his bed pooling around his waist. His heart thumped wildly and painfully in his chest.
This was not what he was expecting. He felt the familiar guilt creep into his brain and throb at the base of his skull. He could not spend his time with things like that. He needed to get better, needed to
“There was so much blood, Cas.”
Cas, eyes still shimmering with the unshed tears from the earlier interaction, looked directly into Dean’s eyes.
Hi Hellers!
It was a lovely evening, and Castiel was sure that Dean was almost completely back to his normal self.
Cas inhaled sharply at Dean’s words. Dean shook his hands at his side and then brought them down and held onto his own thighs, fingers digging in sharply through the denim. Dean looked at Cas, and Cas looked confused, but there was a very clear sheen of hope coating his gaze.
There was a stretch of comfortable silence--Castiel fidgeting with his hands and Dean happily watching Castiel fidget with his hands.
It made him feel safe enough that he could even talk to Cas, if somewhat cryptically and with great effort from Cas’ side, to decipher the words that just didn’t seem to want to leave the safety of Dean’s mind. He was the only person Dean could talk to about Sam, about how much he missed him, about how much he hated the fact that although he could write letters to him, Amara wouldn’t let Dean receive anything from the outside. Dean had nearly pitched a fit when Amara clarified this during their first “visitation”. He fucking despised that he couldn’t talk to Sam. He missed the damn miscreant so much, it felt like he was suffocating. And when the anxiety about this separation felt like it would drown him, Cas just held his hand or put his arms around Dean, and it was an anchor. It kept Dean tethered when it felt like he was being dragged under. Cas did that even when Dean couldn’t vocalize why he was suffering. When the hole in his chest and the black shutter in his brain became overwhelming, became painful - Cas was always there, and Dean always felt safe.
(See the end of the chapter for
Dean’s face tensed before he nodded, “Yeah, all the time. I remember back when I was very young, John had this friend, Frank Devereux. He was the only man who still tolerated him and his drinking. Mostly, it was because he was… unwell. He had lost his wife in a horrific way, too, and they seemed to understand each other. But most nights, after John had long since passed out, Frank would decide it was time to share his wisdom. And there was this one night, a couple of days after John had had a really bad violent episode, or whatever, one of his firsts, and I was feeling so drained, so hurt and angry. He sensed it, didn’t guess at the reason, though, and he looked me dead in the eye and said, ‘Deano, my boy, whatever’s got you down, don’t let it. Decide to be fine til the end of the week. Make yourself smile because... you're alive, and that's your job. And do it again the next week.’ I was thirteen, and he was the first adult that had really addressed that sort of thing. It was one of the first pieces of advice I had gotten about life, and dealing with bad things. So, I listened, I smiled, and I pushed it down. There wasn’t really another option, you know?”
“What is happening?” Came Jack’s soft voice from the side of the room.
Cas jumped up and stalked towards the door. The way his fists collided with the door was far more of a bang than a knock. He didn’t care.
“Cas…”
Dean shifted slightly and made a soft, contented sound. Castiel kissed his hair, and Dean’s arms tightened around his midsection.
Dean startled and pulled himself up into a seated position. Cas, who had apparently been re-organizing his dresser, if the pile of clothes he had just neatly laid in one of the drawers was any indication, walked over to him.
manipulated the ingredients and tools. But, more than anything, he absolutely adored the smile that had brightened Cas’ entire face as the ingredients blended together and the sweet smell had started to fill the kitchen.
“The demon Sam had been involved with,” Jack offers for clarification, as if anyone there was not very aware of the situation. Sam was honest to god blushing and pulling at the collar of his shirt.
Dean looked at him, tenderness evident in his gaze, but there was something else there, something that made Castiel feel like he was burning from the inside.
“Is that good or bad?” Dean asked, trying to swallow past the lump growing in his throat as the image of Sam tied up to all those machines flashed behind his lids.
Dean’s jaw tightened, and he was exceedingly annoyed to find he could not fault her logic.
Dean smiled at him as he walked towards Bobby, who pulled him in for a quick hug and a familial pat on the back.
At exactly ten to three, Castiel put down his book and grabbed his maroon hoodie from where it hung on the back of his chair. He straightened out his bedding and slipped on his shoes before heading out the door. Castiel was currently the only resident that did not have a roommate, and he enjoyed the privacy this allowed, even if the room did not lock and the nurses entered without knocking.
“Haunted?”
But it was enough. That fleeting look snapped the tightness inside Cas, and before he could think about it, he surged forward. He crashed his lips onto Dean’s forcefully, his hands on either side of his face. Dean’s mouth dropped open. Cas didn’t mistake the gesture for anything but confusion and shock, but Cas still pulled Dean in closer, breathing into his mouth. And Dean stayed motionless for another second before aggressively pulling himself away, completely out of Cas’ reach.
But he was given an opportunity here. It was difficult and uncomfortable, but it was likely the only one he’ll ever get.
“Of all the things I thought you would ask, that was not it,” Dean laughed. Cas grinned and pointed to Dean’s bed.
Dean checked the time as he put his phone on the white, nondescript bathroom sink. Okay, so six twenty-five was a pretty shitty time to make this much noise in an apartment with paper thin walls. But firstly,  he didn’t actually care if he annoyed Cas, because fuck him, and secondly, he would be unable to start his day until he dealt with the problem Cas, although not actively (but whatever), created.
Dean had known that this was a possibility, but it was still disconcerting to find himself sitting exactly where he had nodded off. If it weren’t for the fact that he was completely alone in his room, he would have been convinced that the dream root hadn’t worked. But he was. He was completely alone. His eyes twitched nervously to his now empty bed and felt his heartbeat pick up with the very evident absence of Cas.
“Desperately so, buddy,” Dean grinned again, but that same strained tone was still evident in his voice. Castiel wondered why he sounded like that. Was he
“That is really good to hear Castiel. There’s still an hour or so before breakfast,” Charlie said on her way out, “Try to get some shut eye.”
Castiel nodded, gently placing his hand on Dean's shoulder, "Dean, I'll be fine. I needed to talk to Jody anyway."
Sam’s eyes were slowly opening.
Cas looked straight back at him.
Dean felt his face tighten as he looked back at the computer screen. Dean glared, full on glowered, at a perfect stranger.
(See the end of the chapter for
But even when speaking in actions, he tried to avoid Cas hearing what his mind was screaming the loudest:
Sam nodded, eyes drawn, “I was, but that means that I couldn’t think about it at first. Not logically. But in the years that passed, after I processed what happened to Jess, and I got out of the selfish –“
“Fair enough,” Dean conceded, “So, what vibe are we going for? Full debrief and discussion or do you want me to play ‘
He walked over to the head of the bed and gently swiped some of Sam’s hair off his forehead with the hand that was not holding onto Cas like he was a lifeline.
Sam started crying too.
“Dean Winchester. I need you and I love you. With all that I am. Whatever is left of me is yours. For as long as you’ll have me,” Cas said staring at him. There was a beat.
“I really don’t want to ruin your good mood,” Meg said softly, very pointedly not looking at Castiel.
It wasn’t his fault.
“Oh,”
“Yes,” Jack said simply and nodded once, “I forgive you Dean.”
Dean could not believe what he was hearing.
“Heya, Cas,” she greeted him with a warm smile.
“Why isn’t he waking up?”
“Okay, I can do that.” Jack agrees.
Cas started fidgeting then, “I, uh – I haven’t actually dated anyone since, you know – “
Me too. All this time.
universe. Buddy, I’m literally seconds away from calling Stevie in here to check on you.”
“Yeah, man. I don’t know sorry. I just panicked when you weren’t here. I was scared that…” the admission didn’t come easy, and Dean found that he could not complete it. But Cas understood, he moved back into Dean’s space and placed a reassuring hand on Dean’s arm.
In their visit yesterday, they had discussed it at length. Gabriel, who had been living with Meg all this time, suggested the three of them look for an apartment together, a place that they could make their own. Castiel was surprised when Meg had agreed wholeheartedly. And when he questioned as to why she would be okay with living with Gabriel in the long term, she said that she had gotten used to the “overgrown toddler” and that living with him meant that the snack cupboard was always very well-stocked.  Castiel was decidedly excited about this new phase of life that he was headed into, and he felt stronger and more equipped to deal with this whole “actually
Cas was amazing and kind, the best friend Dean has ever had, beautiful and scarred, but stronger than anyone Dean has ever known. He loved him. And Cas deserved to hear it. He deserved to bask in it.
“And, uh, while we’re on the topic of unpleasant situations,” Gabriel continued, his voice so unfamiliar when laced with anxiety, “could you tell me what happened? Meg told me some of it, but I want to know. I mean, if you’re ready and, like, absolutely no pressure or anything.” Castiel swallowed heavily before agreeing. And so, he spent the rest of his afternoon relaying to his brother one of the darkest times he’d ever been in. He listened to Gabriel apologize for leaving, for not being there. And Castiel apologized for not reaching out when he felt himself spiraling.
“We might finally have it,” Eileen calls from somewhere behind Sam. Sam and Dean both turn to look at her. Eileen smiled softly as she walked into the room and sat down next to Cas’ vessel on Dean’s bed.
He just wanted to know
“Fine, yes. Whatever. And so last night he came over to my room and like demanded that we talk, and he kept asking what I want and yeah, there was yelling and then – uh – other things.”
Cas felt floored, this conversation was not what he had been expecting at all.
. I'd love to hear from you there or in the comments. But no pressure either way, you do you.
He reached into the left pocket of the coat and –

Dean huffed out half a laugh.
They worked non-stop for that week, sleeping in shifts but mostly staying awake from a seemingly endless supply of caffeine. And, although the work was difficult and slow, by the end of the week they had an actual plan. They knew a potion that could get one of them into the Empty and a symbol that could be used on a life force within the Empty that would enable passage back outside. The only thing they were struggling with, the last piece of the puzzle, was how they would actually find Cas once someone was within the inner boundaries of the Empty. Last time Cas had been in, when he went to find Ruby, the Empty had specifically woken Ruby up. Considering that they did not want to wake the Empty up again or let it know what they were doing, this was not an option this time around. Dean was happy with only two thirds of a plan, and Sam was sure that if he hadn’t stopped his older brother he would have barreled in already.
“Yeah, so,” Cas nodded, swallowing audibly.
“You what, Jack?” Dean asked.
The plan was this: Jack would take Dean and Sam to the outskirts of the Empty after Dean downed the potion that would grant him entry. Sam would open a fissure that led into the Empty using a spell from the archives. Dean would then go in and use the amulet as a compass to find Cas. Once he found Cas, he would do a variation of the spell he had used in Purgatory when Bennie had hitched a ride back topside, and then head back towards the outskirts where Sam would be flashing a light Jack had made, one that could pierce through the Empty’s nothingness, as a guide back. Jack would then return the four of them back to the Bunker. As soon as they were back, Jack would be able to transfer Cas’ energy back into his body.
It was not enough.
Dean whipped his head to see the very evident confusion in the kid’s face. He even detected a hint of fear.
When Castiel finished pulling on his pajama pants and one of Dean’s old T-shirts that he sneakily packed the previous night, he grabbed the last bag sitting at the foot of his newly made bed. It was a small paper bag containing a small, lined notebook. He had been looking for things to spruce up his room, when the A5 book caught his attention.
“And I love you so much Dean Winchester,”
An hour before, he had watched Castiel talking to Jack and his husband Connor, a nice man who had worked at the corner store close to the bunker in Kansas. His twin daughters had been brushing his hair and tucking him in warmly, as he was always cold these days. He kissed both of their hands as they joined their brother and father. Sam, who had refused to leave his side since this prognosis, was bouncing his great-nephew on his knee weakly. And looking at him, Dean could see through the lined face and the grey hair to the kid he had raised and the strong man he had become. He had patted his brother’s hand gently and had whispered “I’ll see you soon, baby brother”. He doubted Sam could hear him, his hearing long since having deteriorated. He mostly communicated through sign language these days.
Thirdly, I have started working on a new fic! It's called

He walked over to the couch and dropped into the worn leather cushions. He took another couple of sips before grabbing his phone from his back pocket.

Cas nodded.
The external force, in this case, was Sam.
Castiel’s entire face flamed as a heated sensation pulsed in his stomach.
“And I know I apologized the first time I saw you, but I only apologized for not knowing then, for not realizing. But I am sorry for a whole lot more than that. I am sorry that I left in the first place, back in high school. I’m sorry that I left the second time. I’m sorry that when I left, I completely disappeared…. I’m sorry that I let you down so many times. I’m sorry I wasn’t there when you needed someone to catch you.”
“Jack,” Sam said as a means of explanation.
“Nothing,” he rubbed his chin in frustration.
Dean absolutely bawled his eyes out at Sam’s graduation ceremony. This is a fact. It is, however, a fact that he will dispute for years to come.
“Yeah Dean,” Sam smiled gently, but it didn’t reach his eyes, “the two of you?”
as he listened to Dean’s voice as it traveled through the hallways. He hadn’t really been reading it anyway.
“Jack siphoned his life force, so that he could get in.”
“Dean, this is not up for negotiation. Not really. It’s either there or it is in the psychiatric wing of this hospital. This is the best option for you right now. But, given that you are this anxious about…”
The questions and thoughts that haunted him all these years, at those rare moments he let himself think about Cas, were now burning to be freed, ready to demand answers. But Dean wasn’t sure if he would get them, even if he asked. And Dean really wasn’t sure if he was ready to
That he was sorry? That he missed him? That his life had seemed a lot less worth living without him near?
Dean knew what he meant to him.
“Weird how?”
He really did. And he was always there when Dean asked.  And even when he didn’t.
Dean rubbed his forehead as he felt his throat tightening. Cas, with the hand that was holding Dean’s, slowly swiped across the pulse point in his wrist.
The title of this chapter comes from the song
So, Dean did; he closed his eyes and inhaled as deeply as he could, focusing on the feeling of his diaphragm filling with air.
Hi Hellers!
want to think about it. He isn’t even sure he wants to remember. And since Amara assured him that Sam was okay, he doesn’t feel guilty about not wanting to know.
The chapter title comes from the song
“He should be able to,” Cas replied.
“Cas,” Dean choked, “You didn’t have to do this.”
Dean slipped his arms from around Cas’ back and ran them up the angel’s sides slowly, maintaining the heated eye contact as his hands cradled Cas’ face and pulled him down so that their lips were mere millimeters apart,
“What?”
“Sorry,” Castiel breathed, after he was able to stop the tears. He tried to pull away from Dean, who held onto him tighter, stopping his retreat.
“So, what do you think?” Sam asked as he finished reporting their discussion from earlier to Jack.
Gabriel’s head dropped, “Already?”
He quickly added creamer and two sugars to the mug he was holding and hurriedly shuffled to the coat rack.
“Let me be the judge of that. Out with it, babe.” Dean said, trying for a no-nonsense tone, but he knew instantly that he had failed miserably.
“I just knew once you got out, it would take a while before you had time to put your focus there. But I didn’t like the idea of him being able to get to you or to Sam during his recovery time. And if you are amenable, Billie can start with the application for a

Dean was standing with his eyes glazed over, his face tight, a muscle in his jaw twitching erratically.
Dean’s smile faded a little before a different, falser smile was suddenly plastered on his face, “It’s gotta be better than
They stared at each other for a long time. And then Dean’s stare morphed into a glare, a muscle in his jaw twitched as he visibly grit his teeth. Cas sighed. “Is there something you want to say to me, Dean?”
Dean looked at him.
Trigger and content warnings: Mentions of offscreen death (Jessica), using alcohol as a coping mechanism (not alcoholism, though), mentions of a car accident with one fatality (John).
He had bought it without a second thought.
And then, miraculously, Sam’s earthy eyes focused, if somewhat hazily, on him. And recognition, clear as day, washed over his pale features.
Due to Dean’s sudden relocation out of Kansas right after graduation and the gradual distancing of friends that happened in the two years he was away, their shared social circle basically evaporated. They don’t work in the same field, don’t have the same routines. The odds of Dean ever accidentally running into Cas is borderline zero, let alone the opportunity to rekindle the love story of two people they no longer were.
“It stopped the bleeding, but I know some shit’s still broken,” Dean shrugged. “I’ve been talking to Missouri about potentially continuing as an outpatient with her after things settle a bit with Sam.”
Dean starts to process the loss of Cas and his own feelings towards the angel in the trench coat.
“Is that so?” Dean asked, looking slightly alarmed.
The title of this chapter comes from the song
But he really looked at her now. Really saw her. Because Castiel realized that Meg had been experiencing nights, like the one he’d had last night, for
“I…” Gabriel started.
“For what it’s worth,” Dean said, “I am sorry that you didn’t get the love you deserved. I’m sorry that you were hurt by the people who were supposed to keep you safe. You didn’t deserve that.”
After they had reached the hospital, the three agreed that Dean would go see Sam first, and Cas and Bobby would wait for him in reception. After Dean was finished seeing Sam, and he was assured by both men that he could take all the time he wanted, they would drop Dean’s bags off at Bobby’s house, he would shower and then pack a new bag with fresh clothes and books.
Cas could do this. He could give Dean the outlet for his emotions, could help purge the hurt and anger and betrayal that were clouding his features. It was his fault they were there after all. It was his fault that Dean was feeling this way.
And then Dean pulled his son into his arms, hugging the child as tight as he could.
It was far from perfect, though. Dean was on the opposite side of the table, not next to him. They never touched, not even allowing enough proximity for accidental brushes of hands or legs. And Cas
“How did they get your number?” Castiel asked softly, taking Meg’s hand in his own.
“He knew you loved him?” Dean asked lowly.
“No,” Dean dragged a hand down his face and rubbed his chin, “I’m just rethinking this. You may not enjoy it as much as I thought, and I don’t want you to feel pressured to do it or anything. Like, if you decide you want to go write, like, I promise I won’t be upset or anything.”
Or, more accurately, he was having
“What schedule?” Dean felt lost.
. Sam knew that Cas meant something to Dean that ran far deeper than what meets the eye. Sam thought back on the excruciating pain he had felt when he had found Eileen’s phone with her nowhere in sight. The realization that she was
“Of course, you’re our son. However, you came to us, no matter what you did or we did. That won’t ever change.”
“Yeah… you. Now come, I don’t want cold coffee,” Dean tilted his head in the vicinity of the cafeteria. Castiel’s face broke out into a smile.
Dean watched as Cas settled onto the chair he had previously vacated, and he sat on Sam’s bed.
“I know how terrifying this is, but you are strong enough to do it. And, honestly, I found it quite cathartic when I was in your position.”
“Such as?” Dean prompted.
“What,” Dean repeated, dumbly, “English, please.”
“Eileen it is so good to see you. I’m sorry that I haven’t you know…” Dean gestured lamely. Eileen smiled, walked up to Dean and hugged him really tightly. Dean’s throat tightened at the gesture as he hugged her back and planted a friendly kiss to her head.
He isn’t sure he wants to.
“What are you talking about?” Dean scoffed, “It literally doubled in size just this morning.”
Well, that or sex.
And he waited.
fine.
“I thought you would have gone to sleep. I was going to explain everything to you in the morning,” Stevie said, getting up. She walked over to a small sofa and gestured for Castiel to take a seat.
“Thank you,” Castiel said, not knowing how else to reply.
Dean signed the final paper that Amara put under his hand. She had given him copies of all the forms and regulations over the past couple of days, so he knew what he was signing without having to spend too much time reading through them now.
Castiel had come to the realization that Dean was not a morning person. Castiel had, however, also come to the realization that Dean started hating mornings more and more as the days progressed – as if he was getting comfortable enough in where he was to feel comfortable enough to complain. Castiel hadn’t mentioned anything, aside from calling him an
“I don’t like the idea of you being fully clothed in this room,” Dean grumbled as he dug through his closet for jeans and a flannel. He heard Cas chuckle softly behind him, and Dean grinned at the sound.
“Thank you for today, Dean,” Cas said softly, “Really. It was amazing and so thoughtful.”
“Dude, seriously. It’s not a big deal. And I don’t want to talk about it anymore,” Dean tried to end the discussion.
“Yeah Dean, I’ve been watching you two do this dance for a decade…” Sam started but Dean interrupted: “us two?”
“I don’t like that he had to take on that responsibility,” Cas said lowly. Cas felt Dean squeeze his leg in agreement.
Castiel lowered his head so that their foreheads were touching. As he closed his eyes, Dean started experimentally running his fingers along Castiel’s spine, and the contact made Castiel feel so unequivocally
Cas was just never something Dean thought he’d have to move past. Never something he thought he’d have to learn to live without.
His words landed like well-aimed punches, striking Cas until he felt like he might double over from the pain, but Dean’s eyes were still simmering, the fire blazing there making it look like his green eyes were downright glowing. Dean wasn’t done. Cas watched Dean’s jaw as it tightened, as his shoulders jerked in shallow breaths.
Please see endnotes for trigger and content warnings.
“Look, this doesn’t have to be a long conversation,” Gabriel started and then cleared his throat. “But I just wanted to apologize.”
Castiel was not sure if following Dean was the right thing. He really did not know what the right thing to do was. But, what he did know was that he did not want Dean to be alone right now, not while he was like this.
Oh, God…What if the social worker showed up and Dean wasn’t there? Dean tasted bile, his throat constricted as nausea rolled in his stomach.
. There one second and gone the next. Dean, therefore, was forced to stay awake and stare at the wall of his room. He kept his eyes open, replaying the angel’s last words over and over again, his fists clenching and unclenching. He was livid, absolutely furious at the situation. An all-too-familiar rage was burning under his skin. Not this, not Cas, not like this. The anger pulsated, the ache beating along with his heart. But this time he could feel something equally vicious pulling for his attention. A new type of white-hot agony rivaling the anger in its ferocity And God did it
Which meant that, after dinner, as Castiel and Dean excused themselves to go and finish Castiel’s packing, a mere twelve hours before Castiel’s release, Dean was reprimanding him almost every thirty minutes.
He just wanted answers.
Hey all :)!
By the time they stumbled back into their room, Castiel was tired. He, however, did not quite want to go to sleep yet. He dropped onto his bed but grabbed Dean’s arm so that he collapsed next to Castiel. Castiel drew him close, and Dean let out a happy sound against Castiel’s collar bone.
He was trying not to think about it.
Dean sighed. He hesitated for far too short a time before clicking on
. Dean’s every thought was twisted around the memory of Cas’ sacrifice. Each repeat of the scene digging deeper and deeper into a cut in his heart, a wound so deep now he did not see how it would ever scab over. A part of him that would bleed in this life and in the next.
“So, you don’t think I should see them?” Cas asked, voice wavering.
It would appear that Cas was his pink elephant.
The title of this chapter is taken from the Anson Seabra song "I Can't Carry This Anymore".
Dean would endure years of Sam spewing all kinds of absurd garbage if it meant he was
Meg had promised to take him shopping for his own things for his room as soon as he was allowed out. Castiel looked forward to the whole process of turning a place he lived into a home. When Dean was, more or less, back to being himself, Castiel informed him of this. Dean was almost
There was a notification in his chat with Sam:
He’d just returned from field work in South Africa.
Dean was hardly breathing at this point.
“I want to see my brother,” Dean had said.
“What the fuck?”
“And then, we were driving home, John and I, and I was telling him that he was done. That he was never to come near us again and then… he didn’t care. Of course, he didn’t. But he cared if I was going to report him to the police. Sam was unconscious, his blood still staining the back of the car we were driving in, and all he cared about was whether or not he was going to get fucking arrested.”
me. I just, I need you to trust me, Cas.” Dean hated the begging tone that seemed to leak into his request, but he knew that he would happily drop onto his knees if it meant he could get Castiel to understand. If he could get Castiel to stop looking at him in that guarded manner,  Dean would kneel, plead, pray and beg just to bring back the look of adoration Cas used to have when he looked at Dean (don’t think about it).
(See the end of the chapter for
“You’re obviously not staying,” Dean continued with that distant tone when it became evident Cas was not going to respond.
“She did?” Castiel asked, pulling the comforter around him.
What was Cas
They helped.
Dean scoffed and rolled his eyes, “That’s not what I’m doing.”
“No Dean,” Sam looked at his brother whose eyes were now glowing with rage.
And, now, here he was, watching the sun infiltrate his room without a wink of sleep in his energy reserves.
Castiel pulled away slightly, to look at Dean directly, “All of your cages are mental.”
“You turn the most interesting shades of red, Mr Novak,” Dean grinned devilishly before pressing a quick, closed mouth kiss to Castiel’s lips and then jumping off of the bed, “Guess we gotta get dressed then.”
“Dean. I will never leave you again. This, us. I will fight for this and fight to be right next to you for as long as you need me. For as long as you want me. You are the righteous man. The man I Fell from Heaven for, the man I rebelled for, the man I have loved long before I was able to put a name to the sensation. And if you want me to stay then I will.” Cas’s eyes were almost glowing. He looked holy. He looked ethereal. And Dean was falling apart below those eyes, the eyes of the man that he had loved and had lost. The man who had crawled home to him and who he would have moved heaven and hell to hold in the way he was now.
so Amara would let him go. Let him get back to

Dean banged his head on the shower wall a few times hoping it would shake loose the very unhelpful image his brain had conjured up. It seemed glued to the inside of his eyelids.
He liked being in Dean’s company. Really liked it.
He just wished Dean was there too.
“Or do you want me to call Stevie?”
“Yeah, I did. It was great to see a lot of what I’d studied in theory in person, you know? And the African wildlife is just so vastly different from anything we have here. And the people were great, the Game Rangers were so accommodating, and the locals were so friendly. And oh my god, the
“Sam –“ Dean started, but he couldn’t find the words.
Dean felt a very new shade of joy warming him up from the inside, “I am very happy that I can do that."
Dean grinned down at his phone, but before he could reply, Sam was calling him.
. He didn’t want
“That’s what you meant by syphoning,” Sam said, and Dean could see the puzzle pieces falling into place. Dean’s heart went into overdrive. This could actually work.
Castiel walked over the small lounge area and sat on the sofa, holding out Gabriel’s mug as he dropped down next to him.
“Come again?” Dean huffed.
Dean’s eyes jumped to Cas’ face before quickly darting away, but he couldn’t help but notice the drawn look, the shadows that bled out from under his eyes.
to him. Whether Dean was angry at the fucker or not, Cas had an effect on Dean that no one else ever has.
Cas lay down on his side next to him, eyes never leaving Dean’s, “I see everything you do.”
Dean Winchester was having an ex problem.

“Well,” Dean swallowed, “To be honest, no, I don’t believe in the biblical heaven or hell or anything like that. I believe that there's no higher power, there's no God. There's just chaos and violence and random, unpredictable evil that comes out of nowhere. It rips you to shreds.”
“Why do you say it like that?” Dean asked.
Cas sat up and reached out his hand before she dropped two pills into his waiting palm. She offered him some water, which he accepted. Dean watched his neck as he swallowed, tracing the movement with his eyes and wanting nothing more than to run his fingers down the column of his throat.
“I’m going to go check on Jack,” Sam said eventually, downing the last of his beer, “maybe watch the last bit of Moana with him.”
Thirdly, as always, my deepest appreciation goes out to Hellbreaker42 for all your wonderful beta-ing. Your comments on my drafts always fill me with so much joy.
He still didn’t have an answer by the time he waved Gabriel and Meg goodbye.
“Uhh, what do you want to know?” Cas replied, unsure.
“Thank you for being honest,” Castiel told him. He kneeled on the floor and placed his hands on Dean’s thighs. He ran them up and down his legs in a soothing motion, “Talk to me. Do you need me to call a nurse? Missouri?”
“What?” Castiel asked, alarmed.
Please note that chapter tags and content warnings can be found in the end notes.
Thank you so much to everyone who has interacted with this fic, particularly comments, it really means so much and is so motivating. I have just finished writing Chapter 11 and as soon as this fic is done, I will be updating more regularly.
He detangled himself from the sheets, his heart beating loudly and staggered into the hallway.
“And now it's on to the next life,” Cas had whispered as he had kissed each of Dean’s eyelids.
Castiel just rocked him and ran his hands through his hair, down his arms, down his back. He placed soft, lingering kisses on his temple, his hair, his cheeks, his fingers, everywhere he could reach. If his words were not enough to convince him, then he would prove it through his actions.
“Will he be?” Dean asked Castiel as he walked over and sat on his own bed. He couldn’t remember the last time he had seen someone look so haunted.
“Fine,” Dean exhaled before taking a deep, steadying breath in.
He uncapped the pen, bent his knees as he placed his feet flat on the bed, laid the book on his thighs and started writing.
“Jerk,” came Sam’s amused response.
But the sight of the person framed by the doorway froze the blood in Dean’s veins, stopped the air from leaving his lungs, and caused the wiring in his brain to short circuit.
“I have since gotten an undergraduate degree and have done a vast amount of electives on various topics, including the humanities and topics such as sexuality” Castiel said and then shrugged, “And I have Meg as a best friend.”
“Yeah?” Dean asked, a smile already growing.
That thought was quickly doused, however, after looking at Castiel’s face for a few minutes. The expression Castiel gave made him realize that maybe he wasn’t as good at explanations as he thought.
“Dude, that’s great! You’re getting to start a happier chapter in your life, man; you so deserve this.” Dean grinned and cupped Castiel’s face in his hands and pressed a light kiss to his lips. Castiel leaned into it. His hands gripped the flannel that hung open over Dean’s
“It wasn’t on my GED exam, so no.” Dean eyed her wearily.
He had gone over every interaction, and it made sense now why Sam never wrote back, why he hadn’t helped with packing Dean’s bags. Why she didn’t want him having contact with anyone from the outside, even Bobby, who he hadn’t seen in the week that had evaporated from his brain. It was all so fucking
“Mmm?” Dean asked, as he brushed through some more of Sam’s hair.
Next week we will see Dean's reaction to Cas' story as well as Dean's first therapy session.
However, he couldn’t let Dean see the way he was affecting him, how close he was to crumbling into dust right in front of him. That would scare him and make him uncomfortable. Well,
“Dean,” Castiel whispered uncertainly, “Let me…”
Dean has always prided himself on his ability to get along with almost anyone, and since he had charisma to spare and a very strained bank account, he opted for this option.
Castiel’s body was thrumming with electricity when he asked, “Do you hear me?”
“Dean, I really think – “
“Yeah, a lot of fucked up shit happened that I haven’t dealt with. So now, as a reflex, I deal with things in the wrong way. And I have this unpredictable anger that lives right underneath the surface… I’m not where I need to be yet. It wouldn’t be possible after only two months.”
“I generally try to be truthful,” Cas murmured, “So, you’re going to have to be specific.”
“I needed to fix myself. And that started there.”
“That makes sense,” Cas said, and Dean could hear the smile in his voice. And that just made all of this so much worse. His entire body was thrumming with an unfamiliar intensity. Dean was shoving the door open with no recollection of giving his brain the command to do so. But he found himself, breathing heavily, staring at a wide-eyed Cas whose mouth was hanging open.
Dean clenched his jaw.
“Married?”
“Cas I meant what I said, I could never regret you.”
by La Dispute.
Castiel hadn’t even bothered to attempt to go to sleep. He knew it would evade him, would hide away out of his reach.
and not
and letting himself fall down the online stalker rabbit hole. It was the inevitable outcome. Dean had known this from the second his eyes first glimpsed the image.
Okay, he was
Dean could barely hear him through the ringing in his ears and Cas’ voice as it echoed somewhere deep within him.  Before now, he hadn’t had time to think about those last moments: about Castiel’s tear stained face, the relief and joy painting the angel’s features as he spoke the words, he had never felt that he would be able to say. Until now, Dean had been in survival mode, adrenaline coursing through his veins non-stop. But now that the imminent physical threat was gone, the emotional threat burst forward, clawing at Dean, demanding to be seen. The ringing in Dean’s ears turned deafening. His breath caught in his throat and his vision started to blur, an unnatural darkness mixing with the streetlamp lit night. He suddenly felt claustrophobic, the space in the car was too small, his skin was too tight.
Cas nodded, his eyes already looked clearer.
It was almost worse when the shouting stopped. The silence was oppressive.
“Cassie!” Gabriel’s voice boomed as he grabbed Castiel around the shoulders the second he was in reaching distance. Castiel hugged his brother back, smiling a little dumbly into his shoulder. And when they pulled apart, Castiel immediately seized Meg and hugged her tightly. He felt her tense for a split second before embracing him back.
They were both quiet for a while, and Dean, silently and subconsciously, started trailing his finger higher until he was tracing the veins in Castiel’s forearm from the wrist to the soft skin of the inside of his elbow. Dean tried not to notice the goosebumps erupting on Castiel’s skin at his touch. Tried not to notice how something in his stomach tightened when he heard Castiel’s breath catch.
Some of the panic that had gripped Castiel earlier, made itself known again.
“Dean stop”, Sam pleaded with his brother as he pulled him away. He nearly had Dean back to the car - a difficult feat as Dean was tearing forward, arms flailing, looking for something to swing at - when there was a shift. Dean stopped struggling and just slumped down, falling onto his knees in the dirt. Dean looked up at the endless sky, the midnight blue freckled with stars.
“Amara said he was okay, though,” Castiel interrupted to remind him.
Fifty-one years later, on a Thursday, Dean Winchester took his last mortal breath. He died as he had lived… he died loved. Sam was on his right and Castiel was on his left and the room was teeming with his family, with his children and his grandchildren, nieces and nephews. Tears slipping down faces that had known and loved Dean for the entirety of his very long and very full life.
“Ah, this place is uhm… very gossipy. Think Buzzfeed levels of chatter. Everyone has been waiting for your arrival for days now.”
“Pleasure to make your acquaintance,” Castiel smiled.
As he headed towards his room, hoping Castiel was still there so they could walk to the cafeteria together (due to his little episode, he had missed lunch and he as fucking
Cas gestured to Dean’s neck and chest. When Dean looked down, he could see that his skin was littered with small blue and red marks.
“Dean, please, you have to – “
“We’re not together,” Cas said quickly but firmly. Dean dropped his hands and met Cas’ eyes for the first time since he walked into the room.
“What can I do for you?’” Jack asks, smiling shyly at Eileen as he took his seat.
Dean swallowed, and Castiel put his arms around Dean, drawing him near.
“No, stop that, don’t apologize,” Dean said seriously. “You have nothing to apologize for.” Castiel nodded weakly and turned his face back into Dean’s shoulder, breathing deeply.
As always, a great big thank you to my beta reader, Hellbreaker42! You keep me motivated and save me from embarrassing myself on the daily.
“Hey, Dean! Just checking that the place isn’t too skeevy,” his brother’s voice traveled through the tinny speaker of his cellphone.
He would probably have slept until the next day if he hadn’t heard voices increasing in volume coming towards him. He had always been a light sleeper.
Cas got up from Dean’s bed, and Dean almost, honest-to-God,
Dean couldn’t remember the week leading up to him waking up in a blind panic with a tube down his throat and a number of needles in his veins. If he was being honest, he couldn’t remember much of those first couple of days, either. It was all a mess of pain and confusion and desperation. But, about two days ago, coherency had settled on him as the confusion lifted. The first thing he had seen was an unfamiliar and very beautiful slightly older woman, with dark hair and a black dress underneath a white lab coat, staring at a clipboard.
“I feel like a kid.” Dean murmured.
Hi hellers!
“And what did Charlie say, that made you mention it now?”
“I am very happy to hear that. Although, twenty-four seems quite young to be getting married, if he’s happy, then it must be the right choice for him.”
“I can just leave this here if you two want some time,” Cas was already putting the bag on the side table.
The thoughts tried to break through to grab his attention, but Dean’s face seemed to shield him from the old words that still cut at him. Castiel tried to ignore the buzzing growing in his ears when Dean’s smile brightened at his admission.
Dean loved him for it.
“I will be available at any time, Dean. These next three weeks will be uncomfortable, but I really do believe it’s the best thing in the long run.”
It all just seemed worth it.
Sam left the room briefly to combine the ingredients with the dream root. When he came back with a glass full of the concoction, Dean’s stomach recoiled at the memory of the taste. But he reached out and downed the whole thing in one swallow.
“So why didn’t you sleep then?” Sam asked. “Did you guys stay up late talking?”
There was a long silence, neither of the two uncomfortable, both just happy to be this close to the other. Dean eventually stilled Cas’ fingers and twined his own with the angel’s and gave Cas’ hand a gentle and affectionate squeeze. He turned his head and could just barely make out the angel’s profile in the near blinding darkness. Dean did not like not being able to see Cas’ eyes then. The deep blue shade of them having become one of the touchstones of his own sanity. He reached past Cas, shivered as his arm grazed across Cas’ chest and turned on the bedside lamp. The sudden flash of light burned Dean’s eyes a bit, and he blinked them a couple of times as he adjusted. The light was not glaringly bright, and when Dean’s vision came back into focus, his room and his angel were both bathed in a warm, intimate glow.
Dean tried to close his eyes again,
Missouri shook her head in an affectionate way, “It doesn’t Dean. And you need to deal with what happened before you will be able to deal with what’s to come.”
what Cas hid underneath his loose clothing.
. Or, more accurately, his outright fucking enjoyment of this place. He liked how each touch seemed to vibrate with possibility, how each glance held a new promise. He liked how, whenever they got a moment alone, they would inevitably end up tangled up together, as if they were undeniably locked in each other’s gravity, whether this was against a tucked away wall or one of their beds. Dean liked the stolen kisses, the lingering looks, the incessant need they both seemed to have to always be
After Cas hurriedly dressed in jeans and a light blue button up, his only clean clothes, he collapsed back onto the bed.
“What about Sam?” Cas asked while shifting out of the blankets.
“What did you do? After?” Sam asked, his voice was soft.
night.
The shudders that had been wracking his body before returned with vehemence and grew into uncontrollable sobs. Dean tried to curl into himself, but Castiel’s arms were there, stopping him, pulling Dean into him. Dean turned his face into Castiel’s chest, crying desperately.
“You two know each other?” Charlie asked.
“Right, okay. Straight to the hard stuff then,” Dean mumbled. Cas half shrugged, lifting one shoulder weakly.
A part of Sam knew that if he still believed in prayer like he had in his twenties, he would be thanking every celestial being out there that his brother was here with him, that they had both survived this. That they did not become the
“Amara is always with me, she’s a part of me now. I feel what she feels, she sees what I see. It’s symbiosis – not like possession.”
“Are Meg and Gabriel still coming?” Dean asked as he finished with the last button on his shirt.
He tried, and failed, to ignore the throbbing and heavy feeling between his legs as he turned on the water with a more aggressive tug on the tap than the situation warranted. As the steam started filling the room, spilling through the open shower door, Dean realized that there was only one way this problem was going away. He groaned in frustration as he rubbed the heel of his palm over his boxer-clad dick. He jerked his hand away when he heard the sound echoing loudly in the tiled room.
Dean grabbed the pillow from underneath his head and shoved it over his face, under the blanket, and groaned into it. He’d left Cas to deal with the mess he made after he stalked off (or more accurately,
Dean shrugged. “Yeah, well, my safe space changed.”
“I told you not to say that in his presence,” Dean mock scolded.
Dean hadn’t gone far. He was on his knees at the end of the passage, his elbows planted on his thighs, his fists digging into his eyes while he rocked forwards and backwards erratically.
So, it looks like they were going to talk about it.
“Well, then I’ll ask again. What do you want, Dean?” Cas’ breathing was labored. So was Dean’s. The apartment was silent except for the strained sounds of the air leaving and entering their respective lungs. The tension was palpable. It was bleeding into the room, bleaching the oxygen from the air.
He could, however, place his finger on it when, suddenly, he was faced with the person he’d just been daydreaming about.
He deepened the kiss, biting Cas’ lower lip and pulling back, letting it slip slowly from between his teeth.
of Cas wearing that thing (because of course his brain would supply those super helpful images) that he didn’t hear the soft creak of Cas’ bedroom door as it opened. He was completely unprepared for seeing Cas, let alone him in nothing save for a towel slung low on his hips. As in, completely unprepared.
“I generally find that I can’t offer my opinions if I don’t know the subject matter.”
“It’s an old idiom, meaning ´
Dean laughed brokenly, “What? We fucked once and shared some heart to hearts, and now suddenly, you think you know what’s best for me? That you can fix this? That there is anything you can do? I don’t need you. I need to find Amara.”
“Castiel Novak,” Dean repeated to himself, the tone of his voice making it sound like it was something special, something worth committing to memory, and the sound of him saying his name affected Castiel in a way he didn’t quite know how to put into words.
“You know, if I still had my Grace, I would be able to just touch you to ensure your immediate sobriety and hopefully, a logical explanation for whatever you are trying to communicate with me,” Castiel said, and Dean thought he could detect very real and very clear annoyance in his tone.
“Yes. But she asked that Dean stay in the
Cas turned to look at him. He didn’t know what to say. The vertigo hadn’t quite left and the ringing in his ears hadn’t quite dulled to silence.
Dean had obviously waited until Cas was in the bathroom.
They were both quiet.
“I don’t know. I mean, I feel like I know a lot about you, ‘cause of the life story thing, but you don’t know all that much about me. And I know if it were me, I’d be a little, I don’t know … wary? About the unbalanced-ness of it all,” Dean was aware that he was not speaking cohesively, but it seemed like he was unable to stop the torrent of words falling out of his mouth.
“They didn’t specify; they don’t really know the rules or where you are. Just that you’re somewhere.”
Dean ignored him, pinning his gaze on Cas whose arms were still slightly away from his body, reaching into the suddenly empty space in front of him, as if waiting for Dean to return to them. The moment had changed so quickly, slipped away from them. Dean had had so much he wanted to say, so many apologies to make, so much to confess. But with Cas safe, all he could think of was the anger. The hurt. The pain. Cas had pulled the rug right out from under him, and then just
if I didn’t say the right thing or…”
“It’s one of the first things Pamela told me when I arrived here,” Castiel explained.
Dean smiled and laced the fingers of both hands with Cas’.
(See the end of the chapter for
“No,” Cas reassured him gently, “nothing like that. I am completely fine and I’m home now. We just want the same for you,”
Dean cut himself off , swallowing audibly and then lifted his hands to rip at his hair. Castiel caught his wrists after he violently tugged once. “Stop that.”
“About me… and you know… this” Dean whispered; discomfort making his arms flail weirdly.
Castiel looked at him for a short while before deciding on: “You’ll find out tomorrow.”
Next week: A flashback to how Dean and Cas met and both boys struggling with the memories and feelings being around the other elicits.
Castiel looked down and, sure enough, his hands were littered with little black lines.
No, no, no, no…. This could not be happening.
“I’m going to miss you, though,” Castiel admitted when he pulled away and placed his hand flat on Dean’s chest. Dean lifted Castiel's other hand and pressed a tender kiss in the center of his palm. Castiel’s fingers closed instinctively, as if he could physically hold on to it.
“Dean,” Cas said as he placed a hand on his heart, “you made a mistake. It was the end of the world. You can do better. The fact that you are so torn up by this is proof of that.”
By the time Linda and Castiel got to the room, Dean and Stevie were nowhere to be found.

Cas smiled openly at this and rested his head on Dean’s shoulder. Dean kissed the side of his face and trailed his lips lower slowly eventually attaching his lips to the juncture of Cas’ shoulder and neck.
the other.
Dean’s arms came up and circled Castiel’s neck as he rose up from the bed slightly, so he could attach his mouth to the skin right underneath Castiel’s ear.
Hey everyone!
“You missed him?” He spat the words at Cas while maintaining the hate-soaked gaze he was throwing towards the blonde guy.
“And that doesn’t mean it will always be easy because life is just shit like that. But it’s going to be easier, and you know better now,” Dean dropped his arm so that he could take both of Castiel’s hands into both of his own.
Thank you so much to everyone who has read, left kudos or commented on this story.  This is the first fic I have ever written and I would not have been able to do it without all the interaction from you guys.
“Right, as long as he agrees to it,” Dean said, an unreadable look on his face.
” Dean shrugged, holding Sam’s gaze.
This, too, was familiar. Cas had watched him use it before. He saw it directed at others. He’s never seen it directed at him. Even
He’s spent more than one-thousand, eight-hundred and fifty-two days trying to forget everything that was assaulting his senses now. The way Dean sounded, the way he looked, the way he smelled (because of course the scent of that familiar aftershave already permeated the room). It was too much, too painful to relive. He wasn’t ready. He wasn’t prepared for how visceral his reaction would be.
, and the mere thought of burying his brother, the brother he is supposed to protect, made Dean’s body shake uncontrollably as his vision darkened and his lungs seized.
“Cas, you look so
Dean had died shortly after that.
“Don’t say that,” Castiel said, smiling softly lifting his arm from Dean’s grip to run his hand through his own hair, the dark strands disheveled. Dean decided he had to introduce the new human to a comb before he left. A sharp bolt of pain blazed through his chest at the thought of leaving Castiel
“You are being rather dramatic,” Castiel said defensively.
Castiel, however, was wrong.
“I ain’t your Uber driver, ya idjit.”
“Dean. Dean Winchester.”
, and when he settled his hands on either side of Dean’s neck, felt Dean’s skin slide against his fingers, he felt dizzy. Dean was breathing heavily, his eyes never leaving Castiel’s, and Castiel felt a fire light inside his chest at the thought that Dean was reacting this way to
“It was about a year after the adoption papers were officially signed that Alex’s past came back into our lives,” Jody was saying, her voice strained and heavy with emotion, “This was about three months ago. We had finally settled into a comfortable routine, you know? We were a family. She even called me her ‘mom’ once to her friends when she thought I couldn’t hear her,” Jody chuckled.
“No, but seriously, it was okay? I know it was, like, your first time,” Castiel heard Dean swallow.
“Oi! No funny business in my backseat,” Bobby broke them up, but when Dean caught his eye in the rearview mirror, Bobby was smiling.
“Hey, Dean. Isn’t it like seven in the morning there? Why are you awake?” Sam asked.
Fourthly, earlier in this fic it is mentioned that Cas went through conversion therapy. There is an amazing documentary on Netflix (and I don't really watch documentaries) called
“When?”
What had he done to deserve this kind of torture?
Dean scoffed, “Whatever. I’m a joy to be around.”
Castiel nodded eagerly and then hurried off. While he was washing his hands, he decided he might as well brush his teeth.
TW: mild sexual content; mentions of canon deaths of minor characters; gunshot wound (non fatal); depression
Hello there, Hellers!
“Like what you see, Cas?” Dean teased as he quickly got up and walked to his dresser. He pulled on a black t-shirt and a flannel. By the time he turned back to the man, a light pink trace of a blush was just fading from his cheeks.
“Oh, you noticed that, huh?” Dean asked, scratching his chest absently.
“Bobby can’t clear shit for me, I’m twenty-one. An adult.”
Cas paled as he watched Dean.
“No,” Castiel said plainly, “let me say this.”
So day one did not go very well. Will the boys survive the remaining nine?
This was as good a first step as any.
“Much better, thank you,” Castiel replied honestly, “I’m sorry…”
Dean had already given Amara the first letter to Sam. He had written out in detail what he could remember and what was happening. He had written that he loved him and that he would be home soon. And, then, he made sure to add some quips about his hair and that if he gave Bobby any trouble, he would kick his ass six ways to Sunday.
Dean’s face inexplicably tightened at Cas’ words. Cas had no idea what he said that could have caused this reaction.
The gravel of his voice, so rich with emotion, turned Dean inside out and then when the content of his words fully processed, he was turned right side in again.
Cas’ turned to her and he could feel Dean’s head shooting up next to him.
“The medication seems to be working, the doctors are happy with the combination I’m on now,” Castiel said.
“How long was I out?” Dean asked sheepishly,
Cas’ smell, his warmth, just
Castiel noticed this often happened when people shared their story. This moment, the moment that it tipped too far, the straw that broke the proverbial camel’s back, it was difficult to vocalize. It was difficult to think about, let alone talk about. He watched her, watched the tears and wished he could comfort his friend. But he knew she needed to do this on her own. Dean seemed to sense his unease and he squeezed his hand.
Dean said nothing, just continued unsteadily rocking. Castiel dropped in front of him, gently trying to pry his hands away from where they were burrowing into his face. Dean resisted, shaking his head, tears were streaming down his face, glistening in the low light of the single lightbulb that was illuminating the deserted passageway. Castiel eventually gave up and just held onto Dean’s shoulders.
Cas felt his orgasm building faster than he would have liked. But it had been so long, and Dean was there and he was so gorgeous, even with the angry set of his shoulders and the evident tension in his face, and oh, Cas loves him so much and…
Cas felt a lump in the back of his throat, turned away from the photo and sat down on the couch that smelled very much like Dean.
There was a silence for about a minute. Eileen raised an eyebrow, and Sam’s eyebrows furrowed as he studied Dean.
