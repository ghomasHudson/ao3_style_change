He does a short lap around the first floor of the house, peeking out the windows to see people arriving and being ushered to the main greenhouse for the ceremony. It’s not an enormous amount of people, but there’s still a significant number of guests in attendance. Steve checks his watch, just a few minutes left until the ball has to get rolling. He makes his way back towards the hallway where the Groomsmen were split off from the rest of the wedding party when he hears creaking steps from behind him.
Peter is staring at him openly, mouth hanging open ever so slightly as he looks at Tony like he personally provides the air he breathes. Tony raises his eyebrows slightly as the silence stretches on, looking between Steve and the seemingly catatonic kid. “Hey, you must be Peter,” he greets, looking the kid up and down. He has a similar build to Tony when he first started playing ball, slim and a bit gangly beneath his faded Nintendo t-shirt and flannel tied around his waist.
The entire team is going out for celebratory drinks after. Steve is so wrapped up in making sure all his players get their well-earned praise and critiques for their performance that he almost misses Tony slipping out of the locker room after his shower.
"Nope," Tony says, already striding down the hall towards the elevator. Steve has no choice but to follow.
“There’s my little firecracker!” He grins at her, kissing both of her cheeks much to her delight as he props her up on his hip, feigning a struggle to hold her up. “Jesus, you’re getting so big! What the hell are your moms feeding you?”
There are huge framed posters on the walls of all the greats, each lit up from a backlight, just like posters at the movie theater. Ruth, Robinson, Cobbs, Mays, “Stan the Man” Musial, Bonds… Lesser known names, too: Heilmann, Cochrane, Hubbell, and even—
He shakes his head. “I missed enough of the exhibition games, I don’t want to miss actual league play.” The kitchen doors swing open, Miss Sun and an additional waiter bringing out their plates of fried rice, crab rangoons, dumplings, and sweet and sour chicken. It’s all laid out in front of them, Miss Sun giving Tony a gentle, fond pinch on the cheek before wishing them a good meal. “Besides,” he continues. “This is the season we’re going to go all the way to the Championship to crush the Irons.” He stabs his chopsticks straight through a wanton to emphasize his point, rattling the porcelain dishes on the table. He pops it into his mouth, grinning around his cheekful of cream cheese and fried dough. “And the Avengers are gonna need their star pitcher to do it.”
nose, broke his contract, and made some secret deal with your owner, Fury, the old bastard,” he scoffs, shaking his head.
in the pitching department. Sure, he’s only been playing for two seasons, and stats are certainly set to waver over time, but the results Steve finds indicate that this boy is some kind of perfect baseball robot or android or
Everyone dutifully files out of the room, not even bothering to bid Tony and Steve a goodnight lest they incur their manager’s wrath. “And you two get some rest as well. I’m going to try and pull both of you out of tomorrow’s press conference, but be prepared anyway.” Janet fixes one last glare on Tony that clearly says ‘
Suspicion crosses Tony face but he unfolds himself from the chair and sits down next to Steve, posture oddly rigid. Without hesitation, Steve cups his face and draws him in close for a kiss.
The celebration continues back at their hotel, a huge feast laid out for both teams and family and friends alike to take part in. There’s an open bar in the massive ballroom which Tony is more than pleased about, every person he comes across demanding he have a drink of this or take a shot of that. Even his tolerance is no match for a group of drunk, burly jocks basking in the glory of their hard-earned victory. As the drink continues to flow, the lines of rivalry between the teams are completely erased, players from both leagues sharing in the celebration of an incredible match.
Tony’s full on glaring down at his plate now, mashing a lemon wedge into a pulp with one of the many fancy forks provided. Maybe trying to shine a positive light on the kid’s behavioral issues wasn’t the best method. Steve really has no idea how to handle Tony, on or off the field.
Tony shifts uncomfortably in his seat. “I have. A lot, actually, just not at the right times I guess. I didn’t when I first got the news... Took me a while to process it I think. Didn’t really hit until I was on the plane to Vienna to—” he swallows. “Identify the bodies.”
Knowing she’s right, he grabs his clipboard and holds the door to his office open for her. “After you, then.”
The button mashing and flashing electronic lights eventually lose their luster for most of the group, everyone ending up on the bowling alley end of the building with pizza and beer consumed to varying levels. They’re down to the “semi-finals” of the little tournament put together, the top four consisting of Tony, Rhodey, Natasha, and Scott. Anyone left playing matches a few lanes down just for fun have given up on that to come see the final showdowns, everyone taking sides and cheering on their favorites to win and heckling those they don’t like. Quill beans Tony in the back of the head with a well-aimed French fry after he gets yet another strike against Scott, the two immediately locked in a high-speed chase around the building before they’re scolded by staff.
Tony feels an uncomfortable chill go down his spine. Shame and anger twist inside of him, hating the look on Pierce’s face like Tony is some abomination that should be cowering in front of him. “I’m familiar, sir,” he answers coldly, refusing to let the hateful rhetoric leave his tongue.
If the game continues like this, Tony is going to be stuck here with Rogers for the rest of the inning. He shakes his head and scans the field again, eyes jumping from player to player, settling the longest on the pitcher. He spreads his legs a bit further apart and begins to scoot his way closer to the second base, reluctantly letting his eyes move back to Rogers in his periphery. He notices Steve punch the palm of his glove three times. Now, this wouldn’t normally strike him as odd if he hadn’t done it so
Mid-month, they both fly out to meet with real estate agents for the top contenders. While Tony likes the area of a penthouse apartment right in downtown, the space isn’t great and Steve worries it will remind him too much of a pale imitation of his apartment back home. Tony hates the small-town feeling of the houses Steve drags him to in the urban areas, the nearby neighbors already way too informal with their greetings and curious small talk. It’s
Steve sits frozen as a beat of silence falls over them, save for the sound of Tony digging around in the body of the crustacean on his plate to get the best meat out. Steve watches as he takes another sip from his wine glass, staring straight ahead like this is just a regular family dinner for him. Steve then realizes that it probably is.
“You can’t blame yourself for that,” Bucky scolds, slinging an arm over the back of their booth. “Some people don’t wanna be helped, y’know?”
“Oh man, I love you,” Tony gushes before he realizes what he’s said. He freezes up instinctively, but neither Steve nor Peggy seem phased by the confession.
“Aunt Peggy?” He attempts, but the words come out as jumbled garbage. There’s still that annoying mask over his face, and he reaches up to attempt to tear that away as well.
“Coffee?” He offers in amusement, walking into the kitchen to get a pot going. He hears what sounds like a muffled “yes please” come from the living room and gets out Tony’s usual mug alongside his own.
Tony falls silent as they continue to dance, putting his concentration back into his footwork. Steve expects the conversation to end along with the slow ballad, but even as the music transitions back into something more upbeat and the couples morph into groups of people dancing all together, Tony pulls him close, placing his lips at his ear.
,” Tony scoffed. “You’re starting to sound like Nick. Speaking of which, shouldn’t he be here to discuss losing one of his team’s MVPs?” He doesn’t care if he comes across as a pompous douche to these Major League asshats. Maybe he’ll make them think twice about wanting to buy him. “And don’t you give a shit about what I want?”
Feeling sobered up by his own nerves but still bolder than usual thanks to the liquid courage, Steve returns to the main ballroom, looking around for Tony. All he has to do is get to him before he heads up to his hotel room... the biggest problem is that Steve doesn't see him
Tony glares at him before finally unbuckling his seatbelt. “Fine, but you have to come with me you manipulative dickhead.” He angrily gets out of the car, slamming the door behind him.
Steve isn’t naive enough to believe this is the end all be all. Even though it’s the longest Tony’s abstained from alcohol, it’s not like it was something that just went away. Tony would always be an alcoholic until the day he died, even if he didn’t let a drop of booze touch his tongue until then. It was something that was going to stay with him forever, but he didn’t have to let it control him.
He polishes off the last of his breakfast, lamenting that he can’t wash it down with his spiked orange juice before he slips on his sneakers and heads for the door with Ty. “So we riding or running today?”
Steve shakes his head. Of course. He had promised Steve he’d come straight home from the airport, but had clearly decided a pit stop necessary first. He knew Tony was probably just trying to manage his anxiety, but it hurt deep in his chest that he felt he couldn’t even face Steve sober after months of not seeing each other.
Some of the older players are rushing off to get to the nearest telephone to call home to their families and let them know. The emotions displayed from the Avengers’ older vets makes Steve a little misty-eyed himself. He knows for at least a couple of their players, namely Duquesne and Whitman, it’s going to be their last season before retiring. He feels a pang of sadness that Sam is no longer on the team to share in their accomplishments, but Steve knows he’s doing just fine for himself ever since making the jump back to the Major Leagues after last season.
someone so high profile just screams PR danger. My job has always been to keep Tony in line. Some people might think I’m not so good at that considering all the scandals he gets wrapped up in, but if only they knew the stuff they
They don’t get another run after Steve’s grand slam, but that hardly matters. Tony’s not going to let a single run past him until the end, meaning they only need three runs on the next inning, and then they win. What may have seemed impossible mere moments ago is now in reach. Any kind of passive nature either team had in regards to who walked away as a winner or loser for this game is gone. With such an exciting upset, both teams are hungry for victory, and the time is running out.
Tony glances up at him. He looks sincere when he says it, Maria a sympathetic partner beside him, nodding her sentiment. “Aren’t you curious?” He asks, both of them exchanging confused glances. Tony looks down again. “Neither of you have asked me if it’s true or not.”
feels about playing for the Avengers and if he’s transferring after the season… Of course I haven’t forgotten about the Hammer ordeal from a couple months ago, that’s the first thing I plan on wringing out of him… Yes, but those are just rumors, I’m pretty sure I can tell from the way he’s been ogling my chest all night that he’s definitely not some closet homo... They call it investigative journalism for a reason, I'm
Sir. Tony almost laughs. “Of course not, no one is.” Steve coughs from the corner. “But I’ve watched your games. You’re a little ace, aren't you?”
"Thanks, Nat," Steve says, already hurrying back into the building. He isn't sure Tony will even talk to him, but it's worth a shot.
Isaiah’s next pitch goes straight to the batter who hits a ground ball toward third base. Now’s their chance. Bucky scoops up the ball, Hemmings already safely on third. There isn’t a single moment of hesitation before Bucky fires the ball back towards first, Steve keeping a foot on his base as he easily receives the throw.
Tony’s hands are cupped around his mouth as he joins the audience’s chorus of “Thunder! Thunder! Thunder!” He has to imagine how intimidating it is for Herrin against this deafening wall of sound.
Tony’s mood improves significantly once they step into the Avengers’ private box, familiar, less hostile faces greeting him. Only about a third of the team have come out, most of the others utilizing their couple days of break to spend time with their families or just have a relaxing weekend to themselves. Rhodes immediately surges out of the group to capture him in a warm hug.
“Where are we going?” Steve asks, pulling awkwardly at the crotch of his pants as he attempts to walk around the growing problem between his legs.
The redhead glares, her jaw clenched tightly. "Everyone back to running drills. Suicides until I call time," she snaps. The team, now including Tony, marches over to the foul lines to begin their suicide runs.
All it takes to push Steve over the edge is hearing his name fall from Tony’s lips accompanied by a slew of curses. The sound triggers something so visceral inside of him that he’s worried he might get a hard-on in the middle of practice when Tony’s sailor’s mouth decides to make its usual frustrated appearance. He comes all across Tony’s back, the evidence of it quickly washed away beneath the spray of water. He continues to stroke Tony as he comes down from his orgasm, stopping only when he feels the man go slack in his arms, having to hold up his weight so they don’t both go slipping to the shower floor.
He starts with a screwball just to get a good eye on the trajectory of his swing, then pitches a circle changeup just for research purposes. Two strikes, and what would be an easy out, which is what Tony’s counting on Hammer also thinking. He doesn’t expect the ball to go anywhere.
He almost expects the offer to get turned down. He’s never seen Steve enjoy more than the occasional two-dollar beer whenever he ends up going out. “I’ll have an Old Fashioned, please.”
When security shows up minutes later to escort him out of the building, Steve is still beating uselessly at the unresponsive door with both hands, his forehead pressed against it as he calls out Tony’s name. Steve doesn’t fight it as they apologize and tell him he’ll have to leave the premises, letting them escort him back to the elevator.
There are alcoves spaced between the posters along the walls, each one containing various memorabilia on each shelf. Tony had exaggerated with the whole shrine comment, but… Only slightly. The recess holds not only his own merchandise, but relics from the other ball players on the walls as well. It is a bit trippy to see his original rookies jersey hanging up next to a Yankees cap signed by Joe DiMaggio and a bobblehead of Hank Aaron.
Steve ends up with multiple half-finished sketches of Tony’s sleeping face that fill up his entire page, going back in and taking the time to clean a few specific ones up, marking down a harsher, more definite line here or there, adding some cross-hatching to mark where the light and shadow falls across the planes of his face. He even finds himself including the four, almost invisible, hair-thin white lines that stretch across his exposed cheek— where Hammer’s nails had marred his face many months ago.
Thankfully, no one finds it odd that Steve will be dropping Tony off last thanks to the fact that their apartments are the closest together. Driving for a bit with the windows down and forcing plenty of water down Tony’s gullet has helped him back off the precipice of total belligerence to a much more manageable half-past tipsy.
“Right, this is your first season back since leaving the Avengers four years ago to attend MIT, Tony’s alma mater. Were you nervous coming back after so many years out of practice?”
For the top of the first inning, they clearly aren’t holding back. They’re directing their balls strategically, biding their time with a single and a double, trying to load the bases for their best chances at getting a run. Steve gets an out on their fourth batter, and Jaques is quick to follow by catching a ball that was headed for the back corner of the stadium. The Mockingbirds only get one run in before their next player gets tagged and it’s time to switch places.
“Well, Pepper offered me to come spend it with her family but I just didn’t really feel like being around all of them right now. And the snow’s coming down too hard to bother with trying to go to any parties so… Yeah, I guess I am. Unless you consider my buddy Jack Daniels company.”
"Happy's got wheels up in fifteen!" Pepper calls over her shoulder as she exits Tony's lab. The vast room is cleaner than usual, Tony only recently having done a huge overhaul to place a bunch of his prototypes in storage. Right now he's in the middle of revamping old projects he had abandoned during his years at MIT, namely his original designs for the first ever collapsible, full-power hydroengine.
,” Steve sighs under his breath, watching as one of Rochester’s batters advances to first, looking just as confused as the rest of the stadium was. He strides towards their coach. “Did Tony just give a
A long stretch of silence passes between them after that. Steve closes his eyes and lets his head hit the snow again, wondering if he shouldn’t have said anything at all. His spiral into uncertainty is quickly interrupted by a cold and wet force smacking directly into his face. He immediately bolts into a sitting position, wiping the slush from his eyes to look up and see Tony grinning at him, innocently brushing some snow dust off of his gloved palms.
Tony doesn’t beat around the bush, piercing Steve with his unwavering eye contact. “I came back to play one last season with you.”
The cold weather makes Steve’s knee ache as he steps out of his building, hurriedly jogging to his car. Spring training may not start up for another few weeks, but a Captain’s job is never done. He has to fight against yawn after yawn tearing its way from his mouth, a restless night’s sleep catching up to him. He’d gotten too used to the quiet of upstate, spending his early months off with Bucky. The city welcomed him back with open arms and honking horns all night. There’s always a slight adjustment period, his spare bedroom at Bucky’s place always feeling a bit too quiet at first. He’s never been able to take sudden change very well.
“Alright, Mr. Stark,” Dr. Hallstatt is smiling as she comes in, flipping through the last of her paperwork. “Looks like you are finally cleared to go. It’s been a pleasure having you, and honestly, even I’m surprised that I mean that.” She sets a bag in his lap, full of all the lovely pain medications he’ll be taking for the next month. “Read the labels carefully and call me if you have any questions about refilling the prescription. And
The melody is unfamiliar at first, but Steve soon recognizes it as the same song he had heard drifting out of the Starks’ mansion parlour from a couple of years ago. Tony plays more confidently now, as if he’s not quite as unfamiliar with the instrument as he was to times prior. As the music swells, Steve finds himself on his feet and gravitating closer.
“I didn’t think you were able to say those words is all,” Steve shrugs. “You’re always surprising me.”
It’s been about five months since Tony moved in, and the place still doesn’t feel fully lived in. Tony is accustomed to travel, jumping from place to place. He had been born in New York City, raised in Malibu, was sent to boarding schools in London, Paris, and Barcelona, made a home for himself during University in Cambridge, and frequented their villa in Florence during his time off. He learned to call all these places home, it never being a singular concept to him.
Tony lifts his head, looking up at Steve with an unreadable expression that can’t settle between confusion, wariness, or rejection. Tony doesn’t falter in their dance steps, but the pace does lag behind the rhythm of the music. Neither of them correct it, their conversation taking precedence over coordination.
He hangs around their room for a while longer, flips through channels on the TV, people-watches from the balcony, has a brief but fulfilling phone call with Pepper who didn’t accompany Obadiah on the trip, but would be arriving before the game tomorrow. A group of the Avengers are arriving in the morning as well, regular league play taking a break for the couple of days surrounding the All-Star match.
She glances back at the papers, her brow knit. “He just got out of surgery. He’s still coming around from the anesthesia, but he’ll still be in the recovery wing under close supervision while he heals. It’s hospital policy that…” she bites her lip, eyes flickering with uncertainty between them. “That only spouses and relatives are allowed to visit at this time. Ms. Carter, you’re listed here as Tony’s legal godmother so we can allow you through to him, but Mr. Rogers will unfortunately have to wait until he’s transferred to—”
As always, comments and kudos appreciated!! Hopefully I'll get chapter 3 up in the next week or two. ❤️ Thanks for reading!
The show of vulnerability reels Steve in a bit. He cups Tony’s face, smoothing his thumb over the small frown his lips were set in. “Retire. Don’t retire. It won’t make any difference to me. I just want to see you happy. And if I’m being honest, I’ve never seen you happier than I have these past couple years while you’ve been playing again.”
There’s not much room for conversation as they set off on their trek, Carol taking him on a winding path through the town, down to the beaches, back up into the hills and through the woods before doubling back. It’s nothing like the leisurely jog he and Steve had gone on, Carol constantly snapping at him to pick up the pace and tighten up his form.
Tony’s pupils are blown wide, his eyes almost looking completely black in the lighting, the occasional shine of golden brown flickering into view from the firelight. There’s a desire in his eyes that Steve has never seen anyone fixate on him in a
Steve doesn’t have a response for that as Tony knocks back another glass. His eyes are watering and his face grows hot thanks to the burn of the alcohol and the mounting frustration.
Tony picks up a decorative paperweight from his coffee table and hurls it at the wall, Coulson and Hill both ducking away from the impact. It shatters against the TV screen, effectively cutting out the sound, splintering the glass front as the pixels flicker to a brilliant rainbow of blocky color and static before going black.
“Don’t tease me like that if you can’t deliver, Helen,” Tony grunts as he sits up straight, stretching his back and rotating his shoulder. “Do I have the stamp of approval to pass off to Nat?”
“Are you sure this is okay?” Steve asks him quietly, clearly not over the trauma of the last time this happened. They’re not dressed for espionage today, and though the town isn’t populated, there are still people to pass to pass in view of by storefronts and houses.
They both make it back to the mansion in one piece, and the house is silent. "There's a billion guest rooms for you to choose from," he offers, waving a hand around as he shuffles over to the stairs.
“Yup,” Sam shoves a fistful of chips into his mouth. “Another two at least. Just signed my soul over last week. How about you guys? I’m sure everyone’s knocking down your door after that big win.”
“Steve, stop,” Tony sighs, reaching out before thinking better of it. Steve drops his hand away from the door handle, turning to face Tony with arms defensively crossed over his chest. “I’m not signed; Janet wouldn’t do that to you. I wanted to ask you first.”
The lights in the Mom-n-Pop convenience store are turned off, Tony rolling to a stop by one of the three gas pumps. He shuts the car off and lets his head hit the steering wheel. Fabulous. He’s stranded in the middle of some podunk town upstate and didn’t even bother to grab his cell before leaving Steve’s apartment.
“I know,” Tony fishes something out of his pocket. Steve hears the uncapping of the bottle. “Turn around.”
The media had, predictably, ruptured into a frenzy. As impulsive as the decision felt, Steve knew it was just a matter of time until he refused to hide any longer. If he had any fears of what the public was going to sling at them, he wouldn’t have done it in the first place. His only worries were that Tony would be livid with him for the action, but those were quickly quelled by Tony’s immediate joking of, “
Steve follows him without protest. Going with Tony wasn’t part of the plan, but he has a fair point. Leaves crunch under their feet as they trudge up the path, winding their way through the stretches of gravestones as they make their way to the top of the hill.
Tony flashes him a confused look, but there’s still a small smile on his face. “Steve, I’m pretty sure things got
“He’s doing really well, so far,” Steve hedges hesitantly, noticing the slight twitch in Howard’s left eye. “I mean, we’re not that far into the friendlies, but it’s already clear he’s really going to help the Avengers for the upcoming season.”
Natasha stands In front of the exit door to the locker room, finding a chair to stand on to make sure she’s heard. “Alright everyone, gather round. You guys made plenty of mistakes out there today, but now’s not the time to get on your case about it.”
It’s so bright outside that Steve hadn’t even bothered to really look out and see what the city is looking like. He has to squint again as he approaches, hand coming up to shield his eyes from the light just so he can squint out into the blinding whiteness. There’s not much for his eyes to adjust to, because the city does just look plain
A shiver travels down Tony’s spine and he has to bite down on his lip to keep himself from smiling too much. “Don’t worry,” he responds vaguely. “I have a plan.”
After his next pitch, he immediately understands Killian’s decision. Once Hammer has gotten the chance to advance to second, he begins to heckle Tony from behind.
Steve runs a hand through his hair self-consciously as Tony holds the camera up to his eye, aiming it at him. He feels too awkward to flash a full-toothed smile, but hopefully his expression settles on something that doesn’t look quite like a grimace as the flash goes off.
As the team comes off the pitch, hooting and hollering in their victory, Steve manages to catch Bucky rubbing the inside of his elbow, his smile looking pained as he celebrates with the rest of the team. Steve makes his way over to him, catching him by the shoulder. "Is your elbow okay?"
convinces Steve to stick around for the morning sex, but as usual, Steve is the adult for both of them and makes the right decision. Tony is already going to be worn out before the match today, and really should try and nab a couple more hours of rest with no further strenuous activities, and Steve has to get back to Toledo before anyone notices he’s gone. They dress quickly and Tony insists on seeing him out, selfishly wanting to draw out every last second of them being together.
Bruce looks at Steve imploringly. "Are you okay? Is Tony?" The others in the elevator are still arguing about who's the biggest lightweight and aren't listening to their conversation. Steve is quiet, unsure of how to answer. "I saw you running around looking for him. You looked— You
Tony scowls, forgetting that Fury is so buddy-buddy with his coach and seemingly everyone else in Tony’s life. “Thank you. The Knights had an incredible season as well,” Steve says graciously. “I’ve noticed Tony make some huge improvements which is all thanks to you, I’m sure.”
He sinks down into his armchair and turns the TV on, flicking through the news channels for any kind of coverage. Maria and Howard’s faces appear on his screen, with the occasional photo of Tony making its way into the mix. They don’t have anymore information beyond what Natasha had told them currently, but Steve leaves it on for the rest of the night in hope of hearing some kind of update.
He sighs, picking at the frayed sleeve edges of Steve’s oversized sweater he’s taken to sleeping in on particularly lonely nights— which is steadily becoming most of them. “Nothing in particular, I guess. It’s just the same as every other day. Practice is no fun, no one talks to me during the breaks, all the other pitchers hate me, and I miss all of you guys.”
“Well, sometimes, that’s what makes a ball player great,” Steve chimes in, sensing Tony’s eyes slide over to him almost suspiciously. Someone at this table needs to offer some positivity, and Steve isn't under the impression that it is going to be anyone with the last name Stark. “A lot of the times, following the rules can actually hinder more than help. There’s nothing wrong with a little rebellion from time to time.”
“Speaking of worse things in life,” Tony sighs, turning to see people making space for Hammer as he stumbles into their circle. “Hey, Justin. That whole half inning of game time wear you out or what?”
Another reporter stands up, looking at Steve. "Even though you've only played for the Stars for a couple seasons now, your popularity is enormous amongst fans. What do you think it is about you that makes you such a fan favorite?"
“No, it’s Freddie Mercury,” Tony’s voice responds dryly. “I’m back from the dead to answer Tony Stark’s phone. What do you want, Steve?”
Steve sighs. "I'm sorry. That's all." He's sure Natasha is checking her watch right now so he makes haste in getting to the parking lot. She doesn't say anything as he gets onto the bus, sitting in a row by himself.
“I apologize, Mr. Rogers, but we were instructed not to let visitors up to Mr. Stark’s penthouse,” she practically mumbles.
Tony stares sourly at the scoreboard, kicking the dirt a bit around the base. “No point in wasting time and energy when you already know the outcome.”
They walk through the left wing of the house, ascending up the stairs. It almost feels like Steve is walking through a museum, not someone’s home. Other than the front parlor, there are no pictures of Tony anywhere else in the mansion. The walls are mostly adorned with fine art, but Steve even manages to catch the occasional photo of Maria and Howard peppered in.
Tony knows he put the right fielder in a tough position, the man needing to make the snap decision as to whether or not this was going to be a double or a triple, and if he could get Tony out at second or third base. Tony bounds past the second base, waving for Steve to run like hell for home. As fast as he is, Tony knows he can’t make it to third before the ball does. Right in front of the shortstop ready to receive, he quickly skids to a stop, hand touching down in the dirt as he changes direction on a dime and bolts back to second base. It’s a race against him and the SS’s reaction time, the man realizing too late that Tony isn’t making a break for third after all. He fires the ball to his second baseman, but Tony makes contact with both feet before he gets crushed under the baseman in his attempt to get there first. The ref by second signals Tony is safe almost simultaneously with the one at home plate raising a hand to announce Steve’s scored run.
At least the exhibition games are finally starting, meaning Steve will have a lot more to focus on than whatever Tony Stark gets up to after he leaves the Polo Grounds. It’s the eve before their first friendly against the Patriots from New Jersey, a team that almost bought Steve out from under the Avengers when he dropped out of the Majors. He almost expects Natasha to ease up this practice, but she’s just as hard on their drills as she always is. The woman doesn’t believe in levity.
Tony’s attentions immediately gravitate to her, dropping his arm away from Steve so he can accept her hand, kissing the back of it. “I always have time for Vanity Fair, and please, call me Tony…”
“Easier said than done,” Tony grumbles. It is nice at least that he has to be a little less careful with his left hand now that it’s perma-sealed into the hideous lime green prison. He’s pretty sure Doctor Hallstatt picked that color for the outer wrapping specifically just to torture his subordinance. “Thanks for the coffee,” he sighs, taking it with his right hand that’s now fitted in a brace that allows him at least to
Steve pulls up his own stats card just to compare them side-by-side. The only section Steve has Tony fairly well beat in is fielding, namely: assists, double and triple plays, range factor, and total chances. Tony’s ultimate zone rating is ahead of Steve’s, just barely, but that’s incredibly impressive for someone who is almost always pitching and rarely a defensive player. Steve is proud of his UZR, which is the overall ability of a fielder to defend their “zone”, so the fact that Tony’s even ahead by a fraction of a percentage is… impressive, to say the least.
, Tony thinks as he lies on top of his covers next to Steve, both of them on their backs and covered in sweat. Their labored panting fills the room as they come down from what must’ve been the third round of marathon sex. Tony is sore and aching in all the right places, knowing it’s going to affect his pitching tomorrow but not even caring. Really, this has just been a little extra stamina conditioning in before the game. Carol should
It doesn’t take long for Tony to realize he has more freedom in this position, quickly hiking up his other leg until they’re both wrapped around Steve’s middle, the captain’s hands coming up to hold his ass, helping lift Tony up and almost all the way off his cock before slamming his hips back down. The sensation has light bursting behind Steve’s eyelids, thighs flexing as he both supports Tony’s weight and continues to thrust into him.
Tony’s eyebrow climbs higher. He experimentally squeezes the bulge between Steve’s legs, beginning to rub his hand over the denim of his jeans. Steve squeezes his wrist tighter, but this time in coaxing him on as he tilts his head back, hips pressing closer. “And when’s the last time you slept with a woman?”
Their last conversation was more or less an argument. Carol was giving Tony a few days to unwind and adjust after leaving the rehab center, and even though he’d bought his plane ticket a few days prior, Tony called Steve in a panic trying to bow out.
Tony’s eyes narrow ever so slightly. “We’ve known each other since we were kids, Tibs. I can read you like a book. Why are you really here?”
“Innovative,” Steve snorts before lowers himself to the ground, grunting as he gets in a sitting position. No chairs either. “Come on. Eat.”
Tony plops down in a seat next to him with his own pair a few minutes later, eyes narrowed at him. “Why this place?” He asks curiously.
Steve can hardly believe they’re only beginning their fourth season with him on the team. It feels like he’s been a staple member of their squad for far longer than that, the conversation they had about Tony not planning on sticking around longer than one season feeling like it had happened devades ago. Same as it had the past three years, December signings came and went, Tony mysteriously disappeared from New York during the break, and sure enough, he was back at the Polo Grounds come the first practice in February.
“We were waiting for you, Your Grace,” Steve responds, sounding annoyed but the two of them share a smile as Tony comes to a stop next to him. “Twelve years you’ve been showing up to this stadium late.
Holy crap. I'm not crying, you're crying. The story isn't even technically over, but I am STUPIDLY EMOTIONAL about the last official chapter. While I think this is a perfectly good end to Steve and Tony's story, I'm too much for a sucker for a flashforward epilogue to not add one on to this story.
Tony rolls his eyes at the parental tone. “I’m just going to grab drinks with some buddies.” He chews on the inside of his cheek, wondering if he’s obligated to invite Steve along as his roommate for the weekend. It feels a little rude bringing it up and not inviting him, but since when did Tony care about not being rude to his Captain? “I won’t be out too late. And I’ll… limit myself,” he grudgingly reassures. Really, he should be allowed to drink as much as he wants. He doesn’t even have to worry about running drills, which would easily be the culprit of causing him to lose his lunch all over the field.
“He is. The Irons are well represented this year…” Both of their gazes trail back to where Hammer & Co. just exited. “Well… with one exception.”
She holds up a hand. “Save the excuses. As long as it doesn’t interfere with your performance, I don’t care. I get it, being homesick. I would run back to Boston in a heartbeat if I had the time. I’ll look the other way for now, but as soon as it makes you miss a game or practice, or if your numbers start to slip, you’re cut off, got it?” She cuffs the back of his head and sends him in to get changed.
“Holy hell, I need a couch like that,” Tony grunts around a particularly good stretch, craning his head sideways to pop his neck. “Mine’s not anywhere near that comfy, it’s just shitty and leather and square.”
The kiss is uncoordinated, messy, and completely exhilarating. At first, Steve thinks his first instinct is to pull away, tell Tony “
He’s been dry for almost three years now. The backslides were always the worst part, the longer the period of sobriety, the harder the fall when Tony dipped back into drink. There was a period in the months leading up to his current streak of sobriety where Tony seemed to stop caring about his journey at all, and was accepting that alcohol was just a part of who he was. It was ingrained into his DNA. But then, suddenly, he found the strength to cut himself off. Steve is still haunted by the way Tony described that breaking point.
“Piggyback, actually,” Steve corrects. “That would’ve been sometime after you had Lana shower you in an entire bottle of champagne, but before you threw up in a potted plant in the lobby,” he’s barely fighting a smirk.
They end up sitting around just chatting for another hour as Sam sobers up enough to walk back to the subway. He’s visiting family in Harlem over the holidays before returning to D.C. The three of them had sort of become their own trio of musketeers during their time together in the minor league, Steve and Nat both feeling that same energy rekindle whenever the occasion arose where Sam had time to visit. They wish him well on his way out the door, promising to try and catch him one more time before he flies back.
Steve does all he can to try and catch a private moment with Tony before the game and it doesn't come. He doesn't see him at lunch, doesn't find him at the gym or in the pool, and when the time comes to load the bus and head to the stadium, Tony is still nowhere to be found.
They haven’t really talked since the deal went through. The last time Tony met with Janet and Fury to finalize the contracts, Natasha hadn’t come to the meeting. Tonight is the first time he’s even seen her for longer than a passing moment at the Stadium since their last game.
Steve sinks down into a chair next to him, reaching out to just place a hand on Tony’s knee, rubbing it gently with his thumb. “Have you been out here all night?” His eyes are still bogged down with sleep, blonde hair messy and sticking up in the back.
Everything is finalized by the first of December. There’s some negotiation, because if Tony’s giving up playing alongside the people who had become his family, and the man he loves, he’s going to milk as much money out of those suits to help them as much as possible. He signs on for a three year contract for the Knights, the first year considered probationary. They agree on both sides to keep things quiet until the Knights can make a formal announcement in January, but rumors are already buzzing within the media.
The Ninth feels like it stretches on forever. Maybe that’s just how Tony feels since he’s not in the batting lineup. It’s agonizing as calls are contested, plays get reviewed and then re-reviewed again, last-minute substitutes are running on and off the field, Obie and Rezzo both critical of each other’s lineup cards, arguing with the Umpires. It goes back and forth. The IL scores a run, but the next player hits a pop fly that’s easily caught by the PCL’s defense. One of their players gets tagged out while running home, a blow that’s quickly soothed by their second run scored, brining the game to a tie.
They walk out onto the field together to where the thirty-eight members of the Avengers stand, an even mix of seasoned veterans and new additions to the league. The group immediately ceases casual conversation and straightens their posture as the duo walks out of the tunnel, standing at their full attention. Steve and Carol come to a stop in front of them, Carol just quirking an eyebrow at him, gesturing with her hand that the floor is his.
Strange definitely pitches less aggressively than Tony had been, but they still manage to pull a win for the first game. Natasha already informed him that he’d only be playing in the first game and that Williams is going to sub into his position for the second, so he hits the showers during that 30 minute break period. He wanders around the locker room after changing into sweatpants and a Manhattan Avengers sweatshirt, but there’s still no sign of Tony. He opens the pitcher’s locker curiously, peeking inside to see that nothing had been touched.
The alarm clock blares incessantly at him, lazy arm snaking its way out from the sheets to palm at it until he manages to hit the snooze button. The skylight on his slanted ceiling casts a long rectangle of light onto the far wall, fuzzy and faded yellow that slowly saturates around the edges as dawn creeps closer and Tony’s alarm continues to go off every five minutes. He eventually peels himself out of bed to shut it off fully, looking back at the empty space next to him.
“That’s so far away! And school is bogue anyway,” Bucky huffs out a sigh. “I can try out for the rookies in two years, and that gives me three more to make a name for myself before I’m old enough to enlist.”
Tony can’t ignore him anymore. He whirls around in anger, throwing an arm up as he looks to the referee standing only a few feet away from second base. “Hey, ref, you wanna do something about this harassment?” He calls out in annoyance. “There’s supposed to be rules about that kinda shit.”
"What was your big dream purchase when you realized you were making a career out of baseball?" Tony asks, clearly shifting the subject into something more personal to Steve rather than himself.
"Ignore him," Bruce sighs, shoving Clint against the wall so he has something to lean against. "He's completely wasted."
“Come on, Steve,” Tony mutters into his hands, fingers locked tightly over his mouth. “You got this. You got this.”
“Damn kid is going to be the death of me,” she huffs, shaking her head. “You know what, it’s not my job to deal with this. Van Dyne, this one’s all you,” she points at Janet before stomping onto the bus. “I’ll kick his ass come practice time!” she shouts out an open window.
. The assumptions always die back down after Tony returns to the field and continues to excel in whichever position he’s placed in, but Steve can’t imagine how exhausting it must be to feel the need to constantly outdo your best just to prove yourself to others.
Steve’s worst-case scenarios make another appearance in his mind and he’s instantly reminded of Tony’s bad feelings and nerves to come to New York.
He eventually strays out of the room to roam through the rest of the hotel, occasionally passing by some other players both from the International and Pacific Coast Leagues. He meets a few fans as he ambles about, signing autographs and answering a couple of questions before he finds an excuse to leave and spend some time at one of the many bars on the lower levels. He doesn’t link up with Steve again until it’s time to go back to Cashman.
“Tony,” Steve calls out for him, grabbing him by the sleeve. He doesn’t have the kind of stamina to last the whole game so Natasha plans on subbing him in as short stop when they need his defensive skills most.
The room is dimly lit with two levels to the vast room, huge bookshelves lining the walls. Steve has never seen anything quite like it, plenty of tables and large, comfortable looking armchairs to sit in. Steve notices Maria curled in one of the bay windows towards the back of the room, now wearing a silk nightgown with what looks like a photo album in her lap. She's staring out the window and hasn't noticed Steve has walked in.
“Some things never change,” Tony replies good-naturedly. When Steve raises his head once more, Tony is smiling at him, a hint of warmth sparking in his eyes.
“Tony…” Steve sighs. “I’m completely supportive of your decision to hide your sexuality if you think it’s best. Knowing what I know about the sports world since I’ve started, I’d sadly have to agree that it’s what’s best. But I don’t want you to think you have to hide it from the people who care about you—”
Tony watches the exchange in interest, narrowing his eyes slightly at Steve, unsure of exactly what he’s trying to accomplish here. If it’s a pissing contest, he sure as hell isn’t getting in the way. Obadiah levels a gaze at him and nods. “Perhaps. Have a good practice, gentleman.” He winks conspiratorially at Tony before walking away.
Tony’s jovial expression flickers for a moment, letting the weight of Steve’s question settle in on him. He sits up, white powder still clinging to his jacket. “I don’t know,” he answers honestly. “I don’t really do the
. Blankets of snow cover the entire city below, Tony having an incredible view from his penthouse. The roads are completely covered, snow still falling from the sky in small, condensed flakes.
As much as Steve pokes fun at Tony likening machines to people, he might just be onto something there.
They walk out onto the field, their starting lineup announced each by name and number before their opponents come out. The Irons, as always, look like a well-oiled machine, a united front as they come to stand in front of the home team, player facing player. Tony resists the urge to visibly gag when it’s Justin Hammer who comes to a stop just a foot in front of him. He determinedly keeps his gaze forward but focused somewhere beyond the fucker’s smarmy mug, refusing to make eye contact.
want me to lose it,” Tony says around a mouthful of dumpling. “So I’ve got some questions about a handful of the new recruits…”
“Yeah we did,” Tony grins, winking over at Steve who’s rolling his eyes. “So I heard you’re a damn good pitcher.”
. They’re getting desperate, even after lording it over the entire International League for the past year how they massacred their best team in the ‘91 Championship.
He’s transported to a green room somewhere, staring blankly at his uneaten breakfast Pepper has dropped off for him.
With a surprising lack of sexual comments, Tony simply nods and gets to his feet, pulling the shirt off over his head before his hands drop to his pants. Steve’s eyes gravitate towards the dark line of hair from the bottom of his navel that disappears under the waistband of black underwear, quickly darting away once Tony gets the top button undone. He has the decency to turn around, stripping out of his own sopping clothes before he turns back to Tony, holding an arm out while keeping his gaze purposefully high. Tony wordlessly hands his own clothes over, turning his back to Steve as he steps back underneath the shower’s spray to warm himself up.
Steve stares at the blank TV with a furrowed brow then looks back to Bucky. "I talked to Howard Stark a few years ago about his kid. Last I knew, he wasn't a ball player, he was some scientist or doctor or something studying at MIT."
He takes the elevator up to where Janet and Nat’s offices are, peeking into Natasha’s first just to see if she’s around and could maybe give him some insight on whatever it is the manager wants with him today. Her door to the office is open, but the room is devoid of any fiery redheads. Everything is organized including the stacks of files laying out on her desk. He can see some headshots paperclipped to the outside of the folders
Steve raises his eyebrows, taking Tony by the elbow and pulling him aside slightly as the bewildered players follow instruction. “You’re sure you want to go straight into a practice game? I know we didn’t really discuss your exact regiment, but—”
Whitaker shakes his head in anger, looking out to the field to make sure they’re all set for the next inning to start before he storms over in front of Tony, getting into his personal space. He jabs a finger into Tony’s chest. “You better watch your fucking tone, kid. You’re not the first hot shot dickhead I’ve had to kick off my team. Now this attitude might fly back in Malibu, but not here. You wanna know the reason you’re done playing for today? It’s because of that big head of yours thinking you’re the
Steve nods shakily, letting his captain lead him back over to the sidelines, switching his mitt out for batting gloves. He can’t get the image out of his head of Bucky falling to the ground—the sound of that sickening
"Sick," Natasha answers, not glancing up from her clipboard. "He performed well enough yesterday, and considering we’re already going to the final, I'm going to let it go just this once."
The All-Star Game is allowed to have an overtime inning, but it never goes longer than ten innings total. They have one inning, one shot to win this, or else they are going to walk away with a tie, which might just cause riots in the street at this point.
“Yeah, but that was then. Half a year ago. And we’ve both felt something for each other for longer than that, so what are you so afraid of?”
“Let’s go play outside,” Tony says simply on the morning of New Year’s Eve. They’re laying in bed next to each other. His head is pillowed on Steve’s bare chest, hand drawing absent minded circles across his stomach.
“Sure. Do you know if your parents are around? I’d like to say goodbye and thank them again for dinner.”
Steve curses under his breath when he isn’t quite fast enough to stop Reyes from sliding in a second before he gets the ball back to the catcher. Pittsburgh is now only one behind and has two outs with a player on second. Steve begins to feel the pressure, running the last play in his head over and over trying to figure out if there was any way he could’ve gotten Reyes or Hemming out. It isn’t time for regrets as another Serpent steps up to the plate.
“Of course you do,” Janet insists, grabbing hold of his hands. “Before you say no, hear me out. You know that team better than anyone. No matter which players come and go, you know the
When California is mentioned, almost everyone (with varying degrees of subtlety) glances Tony’s way. Would they be up against the Irons? Steve doesn't know the exact details yet, and it's entirely possible that they’d have to go against Tony’s home team. Steve is standing behind Tony, so he can’t see his expression, but the man looks unnaturally still.
He’s practically begging by the time Tony begins to stretch him with three digits, doing his best to keep his voice low as something tells him these walls aren’t exactly thin. He can feel the slight vibrations in the floor from the music coming from down below. The metal rack Steve is holding onto rattles as he grips it tighter, unable to stop the moan that slips free once Tony
“Because he up and died, that’s why,” Tony flinches slightly as Steve starts to bandage his more sensitive fingers, earning a muttered apology from the makeshift nurse before he continues. “People want me to go back for some kind of, I don’t know, narrative justice? Contracts be damned, whatever sells tickets and gets asses in seats right?” Tony scoffs, shaking his head in disgust.
Fury smiles. “This game is very different, actually. I recommend you treat it as such if you want to see a win this year. Your old team is fighting to uphold the legacy of your father’s memory. What is it that you’re fighting for today?”
“You’ll thank me later!” Ty laughs, shaking out the last droplets and tossing it in the recycling bin. “You can get trashed all you want afterwards, but you know you’re not allowed to drink before practice and games.”
Tony’s riling him up on purpose. It’s something Steve is used to by now, especially with the new developments in their relationship. There’s been countless times where they’ll end a practice or a game bickering and sniping at each other, then take their own cars back to either of their apartments where they immediately fall back into the relationship no one sees. Whatever trivial thing they had been fighting over is completely forgotten behind closed doors. For some reason, today has been exceptionally more button-pushing, old habits apparently dying hard.
Steve leaves the stadium feeling exhausted and defeated. Tony Stark really is going to be the death of him. All he wants is to go home and wish he didn't have to see the kid's smug face tomorrow while he takes his preferred position. He has his head down as he trudges out towards his motorcycle, almost bumping into someone had he not raised his head a fraction of a second before collision.
There’s no immediate matter that Steve needs to attend to back at the apartment, he just wants some time to wind down. Pre-game interviews and meeting with fans always takes a lot out of him, and if he’s expected to be a sociable person tonight, he needs a second to regroup.
He neglects Steve’s offering of his hand and gets up himself to walk the two feet to the car door. He isn’t totally helpless, even if he does still ache all over and in certain positions it’s a little difficult to breathe. He lets Steve close the door from him, staring straight ahead while the man shakes Dr. Hallstatt’s hand and loads the wheelchair in the back.
He isn’t sure how much time passes, he feels like his body is getting jostled around, he goes from laying on something hard to something soft. There’s something cold and metal and plastic pressed against his ear.
He clears his throat and addresses the team, pulling his hat a little lower to keep the bright morning sun out of his eyes. “Good morning, everyone. I know I’ve already met with all of you individually, but for everyone who hasn’t had the pleasure yet, this is Carol Danvers, owner of the team.”
Steve is playing darts with Bucky, Falsworth, and Dernier when they hear the stereo stop and turn to see Peggy standing atop one of the tables with a beer in her hand, shouting for everyone to quiet down.
Bucky flicks him behind the ear, pointing a finger at him. “Don’t you dare compare me to that chucklefuck. Besides, I get away with it because I’m your best friend, and also not a
“I’m here for Tony Stark,” he says immediately, already fumbling his ID out of his pocket. “My name’s Steve Rogers, I’m his emergency contact. Is he okay?”
“So, you thinking about dropping that very successful and lucrative career in the Majors to come play with us again?” She asks optimistically from the sink.
Steve does just that, almost bumping into Tony when he stops right in front of a set of double doors.
Steve looks down at the two pictures in his lap, eyes lingering on the shot of Tony looking so comfortable and natural, this crude, attractive, integral little part of Steve’s life that he couldn’t imagine not having at this point.
The team is broken into either pairs or small groups to make their way down the line of reporters waiting outside of the stadium. It’s a little more chaotic than a normal press conference would be, but still an efficient method. Tony does interviews with Bender, sure to heed Janet’s advice and make sure he doesn’t completely talk over the Virginia-born player. There are a few reporters who definitely prioritize him when it comes to the questions, namely asking about how it feels to be back after the scandal from two-years prior, and what it’s like to now be on the International’s side. He calmly guides the questions back towards the present-day game, thinking that Pepper and Janet would both be very impressed with his professionalism.
Clint’s eyes dart from Tony to Steve suspiciously as he follows the troops. “Hey, isn’t it bad luck for you guys to see each other before the wedding or something?”
“Christmas back in ‘92?” She reminds him. Steve immediately feels a warm rush of fondness at the memory of him and Tony finally figuring it all out after years of misunderstandings and ill-aimed animus. “You and Bucky were both supposed to come to Christmas at the Bartons, but
The doctor confirms most of the injuries he was able to assess himself. Apparently as of now they’re out of the red zone, his most detrimental wounds should’ve having re-opened by now if they were going to at all. At this point all his body has to do is heal, and soon he’ll be moved out of the ER and into the general wing for recovery for the next week or two. She runs a few questions by him, checking on any lasting effects from his concussion. Once he begins to recite the basic components of creating neurokinetic, morphologic nanoparticles off to her, she deems that his brain has recovered.
It’s a long flight back to New York, the wheels finally touching down at LaGuardia around one a.m. There’s a shuttle to get the players who live in Manhattan closer to the city, but some of them find their own means of transportation home, a lot of them not living in the city. Steve shoulders his duffel bag and sees Tony waving goodbye as Rhodes hops in a cab. He’s pretty sure he lives right here in Queens, so he doesn’t have a long way to go at all.
“Doesn’t mean I don’t like hearing it all the same,” Tony answers smoothly, glancing to Steve in amusement. His boyfriend just shrugs helplessly and leans against the wall, still casually blocking the door with his frame. Subtle. “How old are you, kid?”
Janet sighs and digs a folded piece of paper out of her jacket pocket. She scans it for a moment before putting it away. "Room 2071," she sighs.
They clean themselves up in a bit of a daze, both of them needing some recovery time after such an intense session. They fumble their way through the darkness to leave no trace of their little romp, Tony helping Steve redress and make sure nothing is on inside out. Tony does up both their ties himself no problem, pressing a quick kiss to Steve’s lips before he cracks the door open and pokes his head out to make sure the coast is clear for them to sneak back to the reception.
turns to him and gives him the nonverbal command, making eye contact and jerking his bearded chin towards the field. Tony passively accepts the pats from his teammates as she shoves past to exit the dugout, ignoring the favors of “Good luck, Stark”s that pour from their compliant mouths.
It’s strictly professional anyway. Not that Steve isn’t attracted to Peggy romantically; No one in their right mind wouldn’t have fallen for the woman after spending enough time with her. She’s everything a man can hope for. Not only was she beautiful on the outside, but the woman emanated strength. She’s the most capable and caring woman Steve has known in his adult life, reminding him of his own mother in a way: hard when she needed to be (which was often), yet does everything with her entire heart. Maybe in another world there could be something more between them, but any torch Steve might’ve held for the woman was distinguished rather quickly upon realizing they were both far too busy for a relationship.
On top of being in the wedding party, Janet also meticulously planned the event down to the very beat. They all line up in their respective standing order, Steve able to see Tony and the rest of the men and women dressed in red across the greenhouse. As the piano music starts from inside, the doors open, and the two sides of the party meet slowly, one by one, pairing up and walking up the aisle together before lining up at the front of the room before all the guests. He watches as Tony walks towards him, throwing him a quick wink before turning away, striding up the aisle next to Morita.
“Nah, that sounds stupid, it’ll never take off,” Tony snorts, tilting his head to look sideways at Steve. “Is this offer a team kind of outing or a Just-You-and-Me thing?”
. Steve steps up with bases loaded and gets a two-run sweep, the next batters assisting further and driving another two home with some sacrifice flies to end the inning.
Tony hardly pays attention during the meeting, most of it just to acknowledge all the players who were called up for the game and to get to know which position everyone is in and who substitutes are. There’s only one other pitcher than Tony, the third selection calling out last minute due to an injury. This happens sometimes when it comes to the All-Star Game, but between himself and Norfolk’s Alston Bender they'll manage just fine. Bender will be the starting pitcher with Tony coming in as relief, information he already knows which is another reason this get-together is pointless.
"Hi, I'm just making sure everyone got checked out of their rooms okay but we're missing one of our players. Tony Stark? He was in room 2071." Steve wrings his hands nervously as the receptionist taps away at the keyboard.
Rhodey leaves Steve’s side to continue to watch from the dugout. Rochester gets two more runs in before Tony strikes out their third player and they swap positions. Natasha lets Tony struggle through three more innings before pulling him off the field and sending Strange in to take his place. Steve doesn’t get the chance to re-evaluate his pep talk, Natasha sending him in as well.
The Irons playing so aggressively isn’t unfamiliar to Tony, but all the risky plays are… surprising. Mostly because the results have been in the Avengers’ favor. Obadiah would never allow so many attempts to steal bases, bunts, or excessive lead-offs. Tony can’t even count on two hands how many outs or almost outs he’s gotten on this game alone from having quick enough reaction time to spin around and hurl the ball to one of his basemen when the visiting baserunner got a little too cocky about straying from his base. The decisions the players are making become more and more unintelligent as the game goes on, and Tony realizes it’s because they’re
"What don't you understand, Steve? Surely it's something you can express without raising your voice at me," Peggy adds coldly.
He’s close to getting off like this, feeling the heat of Tony’s body against his with their hard members sliding against one another’s, but Tony did say he wanted to be
“Why?” Tony interrupts, still glaring away from him. “What we have is a good thing, I don’t see why we need to ruin it.”
Steve makes his way over to the elevators, jamming the button for the penthouse suite. Security is too busy trying to tame the media outside that no one is around to stop him from boarding.
“What tickles your fancy here?” Tony asks as they start walking through the casino areas, weaving their way around the bright, attractive gambling machines, hostesses with trays held up above the crowd, and swaths of people crowded around different tables. “I’m a bit of a Craps man myself, but I don’t know what you’re into.”
The face-off between Tony and Rhodey ends with Rhodey as the champion, just as Pepper predicted. The birthday boy takes the loss as graciously as he can, sufficiently tipsy enough to shake hands with Rhodey and walk away with his defeat. Steve sobers up enough during the last couple hours of the winding down party to offer rides to anyone who can fit in his car. Tony, of course, takes him up on the offer, and they scoop up Natasha, Pietro, and Thor as well. They say their goodbyes to Pepper who’s headed back to her hotel, promising to grab breakfast with Tony before her flight in the morning if he’s not too hungover.
The Irons answer the call when it’s time for the eighth inning. They continue to stay close on the Avengers’ heels, three runs in the bag before their final out is made. 14-15, New York maintains the lead.
“What do you say, big man?” Tony bumps his shoulder into Thor’s as they head for the elevators, a number of other players already crowding into the small space. Tony’s bags alone take up room for at least two and he ignores the dirty looks shot his way because of it. “Wanna come hit some tables with me tonight?”
“Cool. You can tell me all about your schedule after you fuck me, Steve,” Tony climbs off of him long enough to shove his pants off the rest of the way and kick them to the other end of the room, yanking Steve’s down his legs as well.
“No we don’t!” Tony bursts, finally looking up at Steve. The man’s staring at him with shock and sadness written across his face, hands helplessly reaching out to attempt to coax Tony back to him. “I’m the last thing you need, and you’re the last thing I need,” he spits angrily. “I don’t want to do this anymore. I can’t be in a relationship like this that makes me so fucking scared about every aspect of my well-being and my partner’s. We tried okay? We tried for a long time and we did pretty good. Hell, it was even fun at first! Sneaking around, lying to the world, but that’s over now. Neither of us needs this. I should’ve never come out.”
Anger flares up inside of him and it takes all of his self control to bite back his retort that he wasn’t the reason the game was getting held up. Furious, he turns back around, trying to shake off the comments from behind him. He winds up and pitches the next ball, immediately feeling that it left his hand all wrong from how he intended it.
," Natasha interrupts fiercely, stepping towards Tony with crossed arms. Steve notices everyone take a step back from the exchange.
“Not a problem at all, I bet many people are happy to see you two back together,” The interviewer says. “You two used to play on the Avengers together, although Peter was first recruited when you had already moved onto playing for the Knights. A lot us remember the almost father-son relationship that developed between the two of you even though you only played together for one season. People have even noticed Peter’s pitching style is similar to yours in a way. What was it that made Tony stand out to you as such an influence, Peter?”
International runs next inning by playing by the rules, none of that wild-card shit, and I’ll let you stay in another inning so you’ll have a chance at bat again. Then, you’re going to get me two more runs however you can. Get on-base players home, get a run yourself, I don’t care. You do that, and you can stay in for the rest of the game if it pleases you. Deal?”
A whistle comes from the mound as Steve, bewildered, steps down and joins the rest of his team. He stares down at his cleats in confusion, not needing to watch the last pitch to know that Tony isn’t spending a single second longer on the field than he had intended when waltzing in late today.
The question is shocking, to say the least. For as long as Steve has known Tony, the man has sworn off marriage as a ridiculous and archaic construct that was nothing more than a piece of paper. That outlook wasn’t exclusive to his status as a bachelor, his opinion unwavering even as he entered a long-term relationship with Steve and casually affirmed he’d like to grow old with him and no one else.
Steve’s bare feet slap against the wet tile floor as he stalks across the room towards him. He doesn’t hesitate to back Tony up against the wall, hands on his shoulders as he steps under the shower’s warm spray. “Any reason in particular you were so defiant today?”
For now, their season is over, and Steve has a few months before he has to worry about the contract signings come December, maybe even January if the Stars aren’t sure about keeping him. Even though Steve has been counted as a “newcomer of note” by the media, a new player can come breezing in during the exhibition games and Steve will be forgotten, or worse, moved to another team. He’d rather be benched.
Steve isn’t expecting the question to be turned on him, and he certainly isn’t expecting the old hostility Tony once had against him to rear its head. “Just because you think he saw me like that doesn’t mean I felt the same about him, Tony,” he reminds. “...Besides, I didn’t go because I had nothing nice to say about the man.”
Tony’s head snaps back over to Steve, still standing a good few feet away in anticipation for one of his batters to actually follow through with a play. “You know who I am?” He asks, immediately feeling foolish.
He and Steve go for a walk around the neighborhood, dressed unassumingly, both wearing hats and sunglasses to best keep their identities hidden. No one seems to recognize them, though there are plenty of people bustling around. It’s near a university, their realtor telling them it’s mostly grad students in the area, meaning they’re more or less Tony’s age. The area is lush with restaurants and bars, museums and theaters, and it’s not too far from the stadium. On paper, it’s about as close to perfect as it can possibly be.
“You’re thinking too much,” Tony whispers against his mouth, nipping lightly at his bottom lip. He squeezes Steve’s erection again before clambering out of his lap, grabbing Steve’s arm to haul him to his feet.
Nine o’clock passes by and there’s still no sign of Tony. By the time ten o’clock rolls around, Steve figures his flight got delayed. At ten thirty, he thinks that maybe the traffic is bad leaving the airport. When there’s still no call from him by eleven, Steve calls the airport. After an infuriatingly long time on hold, he’s told that the flight from D.C. had landed right on schedule. He tries Tony’s cell multiple times but there’s no answer. He even calls the house phone in D.C. on the off chance that maybe Tony didn’t come at all, but he only leave voicemails. At half past eleven, he starts to make calls elsewhere. Tony had promised he was going to come straight to Steve’s from the airport, but it wouldn’t be too unlike him to get sidetracked. He checks with Bruce, Rhodey, and Natasha, but no one’s seen or heard from Tony. He even calls Pepper to see if she has any ideas, but she says she hasn’t spoken with him in days.
They kiss in the grass, unencumbered by their reputation and their lives back in their respective cities as the sun creeps over the horizon, the fog retreating as it raises higher in the sky.
"That or recovering from a drug trip," Natasha shrugs. "It's not my business as long as those drugs aren't the enhancing kind and he hasn't OD'd on the bathroom floor."
"It's amazing. I'm so used to looking out windows and seeing nothing but city," Steve replies honestly, tearing his gaze away from the setting sun on the horizon as a man enters the room with a cart carrying a pitcher of water, a couple of bottles of wine, and a bottle of brandy.
Steve places a hand on his shoulder and starts guiding him to the locker room. “What was that about?” Tony grouses.
With the clock ticking closer towards Last Call, and his tumultuous thoughts sobering him up, Steve decides it’s definitely time to go home. He needs to find Bucky first, knowing that he will probably want to hop on the back of Steve's motorcycle to get home. Pretty much as soon as he steps back into the bar, his friend is bumping into him. "Hey, I'm going home with Jessica. Didn't want to leave before I saw ya again," he slings an arm around Steve's shoulder. “I'll see ya tomorrow, yeah?"
Tony reaches out and grabs the key cards before they can be placed in Steve’s palm, but the older man doesn’t look too bothered by it, a thoughtful look on his face. “Wait, he used to be on the Panthers. I played against him in the World Series.”
Pepper hums. “Yeah, Tony’s got physics on his side, but he lacks the technique. Just because he knows the angle and speed to throw the ball at, and can predict the spin, the way those pins fall are a bit of a wild card for him.” She glances sideways at him with a small smile. “Although I guess I don’t have to ask who you’re backing. Gotta support your man, right?”
Steve sighs in relief, the rest of the hospital sounds and other voices coming back in tune as well. Another nurse comes in with an additional IV bag, hands him water and a small Dixie cup with pills to down. She offers to place them in his mouth for him but Tony just holds out his “good” hand. “I’m not completely helpless, I can take some damn pills by myself.”
The more Steve realizes how people see Tony, the more he’s able to sympathize with the kid. Steve has dealt with his fair share of being held to unrealistic expectations, but it isn’t nearly to the extent that Tony is forced into. Steve is constantly trying to rise up to fill the image of a proper leader, an All-American, wholesome athlete that young children look up to and adult spectators can respect. No matter what Tony does, it seems like he’s shown in a negative light, to the point where even the people who are supposed to stand by him shun him as soon as he exhibits the behaviors that have already been assumed. Tony’s headstrong and pushes back at the first sight of opposition because he’s so used to being written-off before he’s even given the chance to show people what he’s capable of.
Tony’s looking at him from under the towel, big brown eyes peeking out from beneath the rough white cloth. Steve’s hands run over his scalp until he decides Tony’s hair is sufficiently dried. The towel is pulled out from his grasp, Tony tugging on the end until it slips off his shoulders and lands on the floor with a wet-sounding thud. Steve’s hands hover awkwardly for a moment, in a position of almost cradling Tony’s face. He drops them to rest on the shorter man’s shoulders, not realizing how close their bodies were, chests almost touching. Tony’s whiskey-warm gaze is honed in on Steve’s face, something challenging there. His heart beat inexplicably speeds up as Tony sways forward, firmly locked in intentional eye contact. Steve feels his arms reflexively stiffen, stopping Tony in his tracks before he can do anything too rash. Before his dry mouth can try and form a stuttered apology, Tony moves away from him, seemingly unbothered by the rebuff. He has a small, exhausted smile on his face, almost like he had expected it.
Steve looks briefly surprised by the confession, but he schools his expression back into parental diplomacy. Tony hates it. He feels like he’s getting a lecture from boarding school headmaster #3 about his behavior and what needs to change. “I know that this started as just some ploy to get back at your father and prove yourself to the rest of the world, but how you started shouldn’t matter anymore. Look at where you’ve ended up! You first got into engineering and design because of him, right? But you made it entirely your own and something you
They need one more out before it's back to the top of Brooklyn’s batting lineup, and Steve knows they’ll be able to get at least a couple of runs in if he can just get up to the plate. The next batter steps up, his stance locked and determined. Steve watches as Jack contemplates what kind of pitch to throw him, silently communicating with the catcher before pitching him a changeup.
Tony smiles proudly at Peter, squeezing his arm. “I’ve been saying it for years, but Pete has always been the kid everyone needs to look out for. You see a lot of guys out on the field working hard, showing their talent, but not all of them have that
The room takes a moment to stop spinning as he twists around to view his friendly assailant, his face immediately lighting up. “Pep!” He cries out, drunkenly grabbing her by the face and laying kisses across both cheeks at least a dozen times. “Oh my god, you made it. I’m so happy to see you,” he gushes.
Steve presses his lips together. What he wouldn't give to ruin a dinner with his mom at least one more time. Mentioning this aloud isn’t going to help Tony not hate him any less. "She'd probably still appreciate the apology," he says quietly.
As soon as the PCL’s lineup was released to the public, Tony had done his homework, arguably, one of his strongest skills. He’s already placed in a position of advantage, most of the players he’s competed against before. He knows their patterns, their style. His hyper-eidetic muscle memory keeps a neat little catalogue of every single player he’s ever thrown a pitch to. For all the newcomers to the league he hadn’t had the opportunity to play against during his time on the Irons, he recorded as many games as he could and watched the tapes back countless times to try and decipher trends from the grainy footage. Even if there are a few players he doesn’t know the exact behaviors of, Tony can always forgo the personalized fate-sealers and just throw an old fashioned, faultless pitch that’s sure to trip up any player.
The shower still smells like Tony’s citrus-y shampoo as Steve makes quick work of his morning routine, grabbing his tried-and-true body wash amongst all of Tony’s scrubs and cleansers. Afterwards he stands around in a towel and stares at his reflection in the large mirror, contemplating shaving his beard. He picks up the trimmer and sets it down before picking it up once again and cleaning up a few stray edges just to keep it looking neat. He even dips into a bit of the beard oil Tony not-so-subtly bought and left on his side of their double sink and combs it through the short hairs.
anything,” Steve insists, seeing the joking attitude quickly fade from Tony’s expression. He wonders how many times Tony’s felt like he needed to hear those exact words from someone and never got them. “You didn’t promise your dad you would play for his team again, but you did make a promise to yourself, to me, and to the rest of the team that you were going to beat the Irons in a Championship game. It didn’t happen last year, and it’ll be pretty hard for that to happen this year if you’re playing
This chapter contains slightly graphic description of injury and violence. I've notated these brief sections with ***, if reading it would make you uncomfortable and you would rather skip over it.
Steve steps forward when it’s time for him to take his own walk up the aisle next to Clint. The two best men are the last to go, one for the groom, and one for the bride.
He pulls a blanket off the back of the sofa and lays it over Tony despite the apartment being perfectly heated. Steve wonders how long these little naps of Tony’s usually take, but he supposes he can estimate it given the time he normally rolls into the Polo Grounds.
“Tony,” Steve calls out to him, voice raising in panic as he takes a few apprehensive steps closer. “Please, stop. Just sit back down and we can talk about this. I didn’t mean that
Tony notices the slight change in his batter’s stance right as the pitch is thrown, and he internally curses. He takes off again, no time to think or look back as his batter hits a ground ball towards the shortstop. They both have to act quickly as baserunners right now, because if either of them are out, then that’s it. The ball bounces almost too perfectly, right in front of where the shortstop had run forward to. It bounced high in the air, going right over his head and practically out of reach. He fumbles with it in the air and rather than fire it towards first, turns and tries to get it home.
“What can I get you?” An older looking woman with chunky highlights dyed in her hair and too much silver eyeshadow asks, looking at Tony curiously.
but somehow looks so much bigger with every passing time he sees him. “Hey, Grant,” he greets the almost-one-year-old with a smile, letting the baby grab hold of his index finger. “You behaving for mom and dad?”
She stands behind him and takes the handles of the wheelchair, wheeling him down through the hallways out to the front of the hospital. He can see Steve’s ugly Pinto waiting for him.
?” Steve asks, still a little incredulous the topic has been breached at all. Maybe it’s the atmosphere getting to Tony and making him feel a little sentimental.
His first season playing for the Avengers hadn’t been one for the books. They finished around the top-middle of the league, not even getting close to getting to the post-season championship game that would’ve pitted them against the Irons, who have been at the top of the PCL for the past seven years. Aside from that, plenty of buzz had been generated around the Manhattan-based team for the first time in a while. This season is going much better for them so far, Tony updating the Pythagorean expectation in his head after every game to know exactly where everyone in their league stood, and in turn, be able to predict who would be in the running to face off against the Irons this season.
Steve’s smile fades with uncertainty, searching Tony’s eyes to figure out if he means that or not. “You… want me to go?”
They were hounded by reporters from the moment they broke apart to weeks following. They laughed, holed up together in Steve’s apartment, watching all the news while they stayed hidden away. From the praise, to the slander, to the connecting of the dots, to the denial. It was hilarious in a way, but maybe Steve was just riding on the delirium of doing something so reckless and so impactful. He started to appreciate Tony’s penance for shock-value after he got his own dangerous taste.
"I'm okay," Steve finally answers, meeting Bruce's eyes. He knows that Bruce and Tony have been close since they started playing together, and Bruce was a good man in Steve's book. "Tony's fine too. It's a long story but I... overreacted."
His head bobs fiercely. “Yes, Mr. Stark! I won’t let you down!” He almost drops his glove as he fumbles it out of his locker and quickly runs out to the tunnel, Natasha’s voice already echoing down towards the locker room.
That initial act is a precursor for the rest of dinner, Tony clearly drawing a line in the sand from the beginning. He dominates most of the conversation, interrupts Steve’s sentences, and pretty much tunes out as soon as Peggy addresses Steve directly. He has to admit that the kid is an ace with social nuance, knowing exactly how to carefully lay out one quip after the other, the comments appearing as harmless teasing to Peggy while purposefully dealing blows to Steve’s esteem and patience.
Several minutes later, the sliding door opens up and Tony turns to see Steve come out not with a tray of fresh breakfast foods for him, but a tall glass filled with a red liquid, only missing the celery garnish. “I did the best I could,” Steve admits, reading Tony’s thoughts as he hands him the Bloody Mary. “Figured you might want this.”
He blinks his eyes against the blinding light piercing into his vision. It eventually fades to something more tolerable but still altogether too bright, shapes and color starting to manifest as well. He’s staring at speckled squares above him, eyes slowly lolling about in his head to take in the rest of the pale room. There’s a rectangle of light on the far wall his eyes haven’t adjusted to just yet, some other blurry shapes at the corners of his vision.
feel that little phantom tug of longing. The echoing sounds of the stadium, the smell of the fresh chalk on grass and hot dogs and popcorn, the feeling of an old leather gloves or sawdust left on his palms from a new wooden bat— it would always feel nostalgic to him, even if that chapter of his book had ended.
, which is just a shame considering the physique hiding away under the boring clothing. Tony spares a glance at the ties he had brought with him to try and add some color in, but quickly nixes the idea. Not with those
Tony slams the door shut, leaving Steve alone in the hallway. The blonde chuckles and retires to his own ridiculously comfortable bed. The night had taken one too many turns than he was equipped to deal with, but Steve didn't have any hope that anything will have changed between them. Once the sun comes up tomorrow, Tony will go back to normal— berating and disrespecting Steve at every opportunity.
needed to end things before they could get any worse. Nothing ever changed for me,” He interrupts bitterly. “I loved you. I was willing to fight for us and you were the one who made that decision. I didn’t want that.”
“Alright, circle up!” Natasha calls out after blowing her whistle. The team all trudges over to where she’s standing in front of the dugout, sharing the mutual desire for a shower. Steve himself can’t wait to let the cold water wash away all the sweat and dirt he had gathered up during the practice, pretty sure he can still taste grass in the back of his molars from diving drills. “First announcement is that this season the MiLB is trying out something new. We’re going to have international friendlies for the first time this year. We’ll still be participating within the International League as normal, but about a third of our exhibition games are going to be against teams from the PCL.”
Steve instinctively wants to ask him how he’s feeling, if he’s been doing okay, but he knows that Tony’s probably heard enough of that lately. Tony hadn’t gone home after the game, he had left the stadium and plonked himself right onto the hood of Steve’s car to patiently wait for him, just like he had so many times in the past after a game.
Steve doesn’t move off the field, staring at his coach while the crowd dissipates. Natasha walks over to talk to the groundskeepers who are already starting their work to make the field presentable for tomorrow’s home game, Steve quickly chasing after her. “You pulled me from shortstop?” He asks in bewilderment.
Tony slides when he knows he’s closed the distance he needed. He comes to a stop right on the base almost at the exact same time he feels the catcher’s mitt come into contact with his thigh. Both their heads whip upwards to look at the referee. His arms come together in front of him before being thrust outwards in a horizontal line, deeming that Tony had made it in another close call. His elbow that had been propping him up went lip, collapsing onto his back in relief as the uproar of cheers washed over him. He blinked up at the blue, blue sky, still breathing hard even as a referee urged him to get up before he’d have to eject him for holding up the game.
Tony finally feels traitorous tears spilling over and he throws his arms around Steve’s neck, unsure if he even has the strength to stand anymore or if Steve is bearing all of his weight at this point. “Yours too,” Tony whispers, doubtful Steve could even hear his reply over all the uproar, voice muffled with his face pressed tightly into his own shoulder. “Sarah’d be so proud, Steve.”
“Go on, impress him,” Dr. Erskine said, nodding in Steve’s direction. “You’re already doing an extra set of every exercise since the last time Rogers was here. Just take your time and show him how much you’ve improved.”
“Oh, so now you got a problem with the way I pitch?” Tony asks, raising his voice. Steve tries to calm him again, but his hand is shrugged off.
He sees Tony's back as he sits on a lounge chair on the balcony, a cigarette in one hand. Steve slides the door open, Tony glancing lazily over his shoulder. As soon as he sees it's Steve, he sits up to yell back into the suite. "Hey, no one is supposed to—"
He starts taking the thing apart piece by piece now, ripping each plastic propeller blade out and tossing them into a nearby garbage can. The genius picks up right where he left off, "Problem is, with the added weight I've got to recalibrate the entire frame. Honestly, I might just toss it and start from scratch," He keeps gutting the thing and Steve doesn't know the difference in value between what Tony keeps on the table and what he throws away. "The material has to be dense enough to withstand the force it takes to lift the device including the receiver and the camera, but light enough to where flight is even possible. I had a polyurethane carbon before, but I'm probably going to have to ramp it up and use an aluminum alloy composite for the propellers... the frame might actually be okay the way it is." He taps on the hard plastic of the drone.
Seeing Tony jump a good five feet straight up into the air is priceless, staring at all their teammates and friends with wide-eyes as little pieces of shiny, multi-colored paper settle in his hair and on his clothes, balloons on strings floating up to the ceiling once released. He turns his shocked look onto Steve, blinking at him. “You knew it was my birthday?”
Much like his own personal relationship with Tony, the prodigy’s connection with the rest of their teammates has apparently developed right under all their noses, unobtrusive in its gradual progression. Their fellow players are aiming excited grins at one of their youngest rising stars, clapping him on the back and ruffling up his hair. Tony is pretty good-natured about it, Steve only catching a flash of real irritation in his brown eyes once Clint shakes him by the shoulders for a few seconds too long.
