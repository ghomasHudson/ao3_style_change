“Sam, which area of law are you thinking about joining? The other three brothers are lawyers,” Cas asks, turning his piercing gaze on Sam.
and in his head he probably wanted Cas happy and settled with someone or other, he just wanted to know fuck all about it. If he was going to pin it down he’d have guessed there would have been someone around, but… Dean’s
“ - I can handle it,” Dean cuts across, “We don’t need some asshat coming here and overcharging us for a blown fuse.”
“Sam,” Dean manages, his throat tight, painful. “I get that you’re trying to help, but you - you can’t. You can’t fix a car. Rufus wouldn’t… it’s not possible.”
“I get it,” Dean says, because he’s felt pretty much the same every time he’s in a room with these types of people. He
That evening, he learns that Timothy engages in something called ‘LARP’ once a month, that he has two older brothers and wanted to be an astronaut until he was twenty. After some consideration, he sends Dean a picture of his pork and roast potatoes with the words
“No,” Dean says with a shaky laugh, smothering some of his emotions in the curve of Cas’ neck, “I hate Christmas.”
the independence thing. I’ve been thinking about it since we last talked and I’m beginning to get it. It's way more than just doing whatever the hell you like. It's about weighing everything up and acknowledging that you got your own principles and wants and dreams that are gonna make you happy. It's not about failing your duty to your family. If they needed you - them, not their business - then you'd go. You're that kind of person, Cas. Righteous. Good. This really been weighing on you?”
.“If you’re going to flee the building, I would appreciate you doing it now, before I’ve had the chance to fall back to sleep.”
of emotional bullshit to wade through. So --- chances are, at some point, we’re gonna get in a fight and we’re both gonna say some shit we regret. And … yeah, Sam, that’s… I don’t handle it well and --- for the formal record, neither do you, if those voicemails and Jess having to interfere is anything to go by --  but it’s not
great, obviously, because he gets to settle with a hand on Dean’s cheek, thighs pressed together, close.
It’s just not that fucking easy to undo years of layering up the denial and the repression and the staunch belief that he’s not allowed to acknowledge any of this shit, out loud, to anyone. The rest of it just
“Damnit,” Cas mutters, headed back into his bedroom. Dean’s palm closes over Cas’ key, thumb running over the rough edge. Sure as hell didn’t take them long to get back to the key-swapping point. It’s dumb as hell how light that makes him feel.
becuase he’s old and maybe that means he’s allowed, and he takes Emma’s hand in both of his, threads their fingers together and rests his other on top.
"Why are you doing this, Dean, really?"  Sam asks, launching into his next tirade before Dean can give him an answer. Dean takes another swig of his beer and rolls his eyes at the ceiling. "Because I find it difficult to believe that you haven't heard from the guy for years and you suddenly decide -"
“He was so pissed at me and so —- so sure that I was this, this straight, insensitive, girl chasing douchebag, that I figured — that was my answer. That he really did think I was this shallow, cheap white trash just like I was always scared he thought and that — that I could never be anything else, and that … that he was friends with me ‘cause it was convenient, but that when something better came along he’d….   Don’t, Sammy. You know I didn't wind up thinking Alastair was a good idea because I had stellar self esteem. I get that I was— wrong, and an idiot, about a lot of things, but, uh. Guess I’m tryin’ to square stuff up with reality, rather than my internal bullshit.”
“Mostly, I’ve seen your sense of obligation to look after your brother make you tense and insecure.”
, Dean,” Cas says, mouth pulled into a frown, “We have three bedrooms. This could be where we raise a family and I… I knew you
“Hmm,” Cas says, pulling back to offer him a pillow and a little re-negotiation of limbs and space, till he’s settled almost-horizontal with the warm, familiar line of Cas’ body wedged somewhere between Dean and the back of the sofa.  “Better?”
“Yeah you did,” Dean says, “I --- know it wasn’t as dramatic as that, but. You could’ve called me. You could've kept in contact. You could’ve come home for Christmas, and you didn’t. And none of that had to involve Dad. And …. It’s okay, Sam. I’m not mad about it. You needed some space to figure out what the hell you wanted to do with your life, with our whole crazy-ass childhood, and that included me. I was
as he said it, like he was expecting Dean to throw a fucking party). He knows they haven’t actually seen each other, but he’s got no clue how many texts or messages or freaking letters they’ve exchanged, but it must be something, because Dean would never have jumped to Cas actually wanting out of his job.
“The point is, you do look the closet to unappealing I’ve ever seen you in this photograph, but I like the comfortwear,” Castiel says, setting the phone back down. “You finished your degree,”
“Sorry,” Dean says, mouth pulling up into a smile, “It’s good to have you home. You wanna get in on your

“Good fucking riddance,” Dean says, shutting the lid of the grill and taking a seat. The sausages are gonna take some time to cook, anyway, and… Cas quitting his job is kind of a massive goddamn deal. “They
It didn’t seem like a very likely fear to Castiel at the time. While Chuck had been absent for years, he never left them
“Dean,” Cas answers, voice all wrinkled with confusion, and somehow all the better transmitted down a phone line. He’s always liked Cas’ phone voice, which is probably going to be handy right about now.
“Yeah,” Dean says, “‘Cause I bought a lot of that crap about being into dick being some inane character flaw, or it being intrinsically tied to all this other stuff about me.
“I have faith in you.” Cas says, not moving any closer, not pulling away either; pressed up against his side, expecting nothing. “You’re a very good man.”
“Coffee?” Gabriel says, prodding the brand new coffee machine. Castiel’s eyes settle on it and he doesn’t look all that happy about it, which Dean definitely doesn’t relate to. He could really go for coffee right about now.
A week and a half later, he emailed Sam and asked him vaguely about his family and Sam told him that John Winchester was dead. He didn’t mention Dean at all.
“That’s one word for it,” Dean says, “You don’t have to listen to this crap, Cas. I should… I should go.”
“Hell fucking yes,” Dean says, “Just… gotta text Ruby first, check she’s not in some ditch somewhere, but
about this,” Dean says, slow, warmth beginning to radiate from his words, “This isn’t just, I dunno, some elaborate punked sketch. Or. you saying whatever the hell you can think of to get your rocks off -”
“Okay, fine, I didn't tell him,” Dean says, which he's actually pretty sure he doesn't regret. Sam applying to Yale early admissions smacks of Dean asking him to do it, which he didn't (and he's pretty sure that if he did ask, Sam wouldn't have done it), and it reads like a proposal of commitment that Dean's not sure he has in him. Cas would read into it either way, and Dean's not sure what that book would say but he's pretty convinced that Dean doesn't come off well in any interpretation. There’s stuff they
“So you think that’s just —- fine. That it’s a-okay that the whole freaking lot of them — Michael and Lucifer — are fucking billionaires just cause.”
Anna is the driving force behind the revamp, from what he can work out, and she’s tried to reason with Cas that if they let it be the place will decay and rot, and that Chuck wouldn’t want the house to be a crumbling shine to his memory. She’s got a good eye for it. She got copies of all the Milton-painted crockery reprinted and the originals on display in a worn old cabinet that Dean knows has always been that, but couldn’t for the life of him say what it used to contain. The new sofa looks good and the kitchen table looks like it was made for the room.
“We sit down and we talk about money,” Castiel says, holding up a notepad that he took from the house, filled with his brief notes about what they can actually
on the other end except silence and the barest hint of someone breathing. “Is this some kind of butt dial?”
“Okay,” Castiel says, as Dean tips the onions into the pan. He’s sure that they will talk about it in more detail at some point, but he’s beginning to feel slightly saturated with emotion. Talking to Gabriel was good and productive but now he’s empty of any more words to talk about his feelings. There’s been far too much of it in the last couple of days. “Long.”
“Awh, I think that’s a little hypocritical,” Benny smiles, all wide and smooth. “Keep your enemies close.”
“And don’t worry about Dad,” Sam says, “We’ve all got bigger problems than worrying about what he thinks about anything.”
“No complaints here if he does,” Dean says, pulling his gaze away and trying to scan the crowd for Cas again. “Jimmy seems ...nice.”
His heart is thudding loud enough to give him a headache as he steps through the arrivals gate. Then it sinks through the floor because  it’s just
“You got up, plugged your phone in, then got back into my bed and shut your eyes, Dean. Were you expecting a different outcome than unconsciousness?” Cas asks, pulling on a pair of mother-fucking-jeans
runs from his chest to his toes and…. he knows he let go of this before. This fresh wave is  just so fucking painful. “What kind of person just —?”
“It was a funeral,” Dean says, collapsing onto Sam’s sofa and grimacing. “You know, black shoes, handshakes, alcohol.”
“No, I mean, I didn't -- didn't really talk to anyone about anything, and... At school, my top priority was getting through the goddamn day. I
then we’ve dated, Cas, you met half my damn family and I came out to the rest of them. What else do you want me to do, take an add out in the fucking paper?”
that the latter won’t be perceived as a compliment, or maybe even acceptable, and the first bit doesn’t exactly make anyone any happier. Hell, if he’s honest about it he needs a drink
He tastes of salt and his hair is still damp from the sea, and he steps forward into the space between Dean’s legs and to close the rest of the gap, and kisses him like none of the last seven years ever happened. It’s uncomplicated and fucking awesome, and —- that’s
“You mean, am I sober enough to?” Dean asks, voice hardening a little. Sam gestures an apologetic yes that grate over his nerves. That's how it's gonna be, then. “Yeah, Sam, I’m a fucking mormon.”
“Because, Sammy,” Dean says, “He owns goddamn suits that are worth more than my whole wardrobe, goes to expensive ass bars and — and I don’t need someone to pay for shit.”
That just about figures. Cas had done a pretty good job of turning into a recluse right before their relationship. Dean forgets that, sometimes. He’s not the only one dragging around baggage.
like I’m your partner most of the time, and, you know, I’m seriously cheaper than Marv and  - I think I’d rock at it.”
(He didn’t take the after care instructions very seriously the last time he did this, but this is complicated enough already and Dean’s a lot more sensible than he was however many years ago. He read Jess’ instructions six times over and set regular cleaning time alarms on his phone).
“It’s cold,” Cas says, drawing himself back in and standing up. He’s got a point; the seeped through his jeans and a numbness has crept into his bones, but Dean’s pretty sure Cas is just trying to end the conversation. “We should go back.”
“This side of the morning, maybe,” Dean says, rubbing the back of his neck for a moment before he reaches for his jacket. He pauses to kiss Castiel before he double checks he has his car keys, which at least means that he hasn’t sunk so far into his head that Castiel should be concerned.
okay, really, but uh —- there was definitely a time when I wasn’t scared for my life. But —- that’s not what you meant when you asked me to be honest.”
“It was very cold, and Michael had beaten us, but you laughed for the first time in weeks, and it occurred to me that I was in love with you.”
“Yeah, I know,” Dean says, “But you kept trying to keep me out and it was making me antsy, but.  I’m —- I gotta say, Cas. I’m a little relieved. You were acting like you didn’t have anyone, but… you’ve got people in your corner.”
of what was up, actually. Worked it out, I guess,” Dean says, shifting to look at him a little more, “One year cooking for Rufus. Man, I pissed him off trying to class up the joint, but I got profits way up and people started actually coming to eat and then… then I had a freaking reference. A good reference.”
When he was driving, they’d been averaging a half hour phone call every night and a dozen or so dumb text messages from Dean’s food or gas breaks, mostly full of them picking up threads of conversation and them dropping them again, almost-jokes and updates of their days.
“I don’t think there’s a show about excessively decorated pie.”  Castiel deadpans, settling with his head on Dean’s chest.
Dean throws himself on his shitty bunk in his shared box room and reaches for his cell, which is displaying the zero messages he’s had since about Christmas. Dean grunts and reaches instead for the half bottle of vodka stuffed in his suitcase and pours himself a glass, straight. Mixer involves one of the bars, which are nearly all closed and full of first-night-guests, who always hit the drink way too hard so, fuck that. Dean stares at Sam’s cell phone number until his finished tipping the vodka down his throat and it’s then that he realises he still cares. He hasn’t cared about anything for a long, long time
kissed once since they started ‘going on dates’, and that was a simple brief thing that did nothing to quench his desire to
what it’s like to not know where you’re going to sleep at night, or how you’re going to feed yourself. Once you start thinking like that, it’s a difficult thing to break.”
Castiel frowns again, but it’s less unhappy and more conflicted this time. Dean got that frown a lot when they were sixteen and it’s
“No,” Castiel says, “He lives in Palo Alto. Sam is attending Stanford. And, before you ask, the woman was pregnant which, Gabriel, for all your observations — how did you not notice that she was impregnated?”
“Do you trust me?” Dean asks, which was definitely supposed land as more light hearted than it does. He just means about
“Cas,” Dean says, drawing in his gaze and attention, so he can reach out and run a thumb over his cheek. “Hey.”
“Uhuh. Good thing we live over a thousand miles away from each other then,” Dean says, twisting round so that he can face him, “What do you wanna do?”
“I — okay,” Dean says, his heart pounding triple time as Cas tries to give him a reassuring smile that Dean can fucking tell John has clocked. “Okay, but —- I’ve only got forty minutes before I’ve gotta get back to work.”
“I know,” Castiel begins, “It’s just Dean is ----- calling me, apparently,” Castiel says, staring at his phone feeling a strange sense of dread that doesn’t normally accompany seeing Dean’s name on his phone. Normally, it’s that finally-seeing-your-food-coming-at-a-restaurant-joy but he

“I’ll get the caffeine,” Cas says, turning on the spot to disappear and head towards the coffee. The rest of them are suspended in complete quiet until the kitchen door swings shut, and then -
He's not there yet, he's just also not at a point where he doesn't feel a dumb wave of happiness every time Cas’ name comes up on his phone, either.
sickeningly happy in this exact moment, even though he has boxes of childhood books in the back of his car and no plan and no job, and Dean has scars and flashbacks and neither of them really know what they’re doing. He’s spent half the afternoon having a staring competition with his father’s grave, but
talking to Cas when the creeping sense that what they’re doing is dumb and guaranteed to gut him, at some point, until it passes.

and he’d had an honest-to-god panic attack in their downstairs bathroom.  A week later, he was sleeping over at Emma’s because something broke — his heating, or a pipe, or something — and for whatever reason Mia, who was told old for it really, climbed into his bed on top of the sheets and tucked herself against his side with a hushed whisper about a nightmare. He’d lay there with her cuddled up next to him and thought about tiny baby-Mia sleeping on his chest and the way she used to grab fistfuls of Castiel’s hair, and it had rolled over him, slowly, in a wave that it was going to be okay. He could survive it. He’d be okay.
But, then Dean’s face breaks out into a gorgeous, uncensored smile that’s better than any sauce or anything Castiel’s mother ever cooked.
Dean tries not to play that what-if game too much, because it’s complicated and painful and regret only ever left a bad taste at the back of his throat, but --- but it’s
“ - Dean,” Cas says, voice tilted in concern, hand on his arm. Cas has been talking. Dean’s got no idea what he’s been saying, but he’s been
“-don't even start in front of Cas, dude.” Dean says, “You can check it if you promise me you won't mention fucking Trump in our house. Every damn time he gets upset about the American people, like it's a personal betrayal -”
“I suppose we’re going to discount this as one of our official dates,” Castiel says, looking down at his untouched pie and trying to regulate his thoughts.
“I mean,” Dean says, “The guy, like. He said his buy-in was something like three hundred thousand dollars. I don’t even know what the fuck that means, but I know that’s more money than I’m gonna earn in my life, and — I don’t really know what to do with that.”
. Rice takes effort. Actual cooking. Maybe they could go more creative and have chilli and… Ramen. Toast. Something quicker. “Big plans?”

because it’s the one with John Winchester, Kate and Adam, rather than the one with Bobby and Ellen, or the one with all of his siblings and he could’ve lived without anyone bringing that

“You don’t actually know where all the crap is,” Dean says,  “Didn’t exactly get to the tour last night.”
“That was the plan,” Castiel says, “But, I am very behind on my thesis, and the holidays have a distinct advantage of
And… Castiel is very happy. He is warm and full and their conversation was easy and uncomplicated. Dean makes him laugh and relishes in Castiel’s humour and bluntness. He looks at him like he is enthralling, with those green eyes and that exceptional jawline. He lives fifteen minutes down the road and he has been going to therapy. He is successful and accessible and right
“I,” Dean says, taken aback, “Okay,” he continues, setting down his wine and heading towards the office that they now share, emerging with his laptop, folder and notebook in hand.

with his… not-boyfriend. Ongoing sexual partner, with whom he has occasional sexless sleepovers. And dates. And spooning. Text messages. The occasional romantic dinner dates. Nights like last night where they watched a movie on Dean's sofa while Cas complaint about how crap his sofa is.
“It’s my father’s birthday today.” There’s not a lot that Dean can say about that. “He’s supposed to be sixty eight.”
They go for coffee the next morning before Dean has to go to work, and Dean suggests with wide, hopefully eyes that they should reschedule their first date.
“I — I don’t think…” Dean silences him with a look and Castiel’s resolve crumples. “You know that Sam pressed for the DA to look into his finances after what you told him….”
“Do you want to go get breakfast?” Castiel asks, reappearing all pink and ruffled from the shower,  as Dean’s chewing over whether to send his gut reaction of
“Um, I’m not really supposed to be in guests rooms,” Dean says, hand going to the back of his neck. This was a worse idea than calling Sam in the first place. Damn.

Cas has updated his blog twice since the Third Chances blog, which in Cas terms is the equivalent of disappearing off the face of the freaking planet. Both posts are… Not that great. Not as funny and snarky as normal, and none of the usual politics thrumming underneath his words, because Cas understands shit like that. Understands that Avocados are a political symbol; that sourdough says more than douchebag; that food doesn't exist in a vacuum. The last two pieces are just… Reviews of how some things he’s have eaten tastes. They're Cas's food reviews with the Cas taken out, and… If Dean had a damn thing to do with it, then it's gonna take a long fucking time for him to forgive himself.
“Good.” Cas says, reaching over his head and pulling out a mug out of the cupboard. “You look better.”
He does not miss how their relationship was before-Lisa. He does not miss constantly feeling like Sam is trying to slip through his grasp and disappear into the wind, or his accidental-callousness with Dean’s feelings.
“I have always had this voice,” Cas agrees, sitting on his bed, twisting round to look at him. “There was the chance I’d had some kind of haircut.”
“No, just. Some of it. I could —- I could do it, with my savings but I’d just be —- it’d be so damn tempting to cut back less. Not having a buffer, just —”
“And we could use impressing the guy!” Charlie says, six kinds of enthusiasm packed into her voice, all of them irritating this early in the morning. The guy’s website is actually pretty non-douchebagy, as it goes. Castiel. The name sparks some memory somewhere in the back of his head, but he draws up a blank. Dean clicks through onto the latest post about his restaurant, and finds himself face to face with a bunch of photos of his food. “His words have power. Plus, he’s super cool.”
,” Dean exhales, “Obviously — teething issues. Can’t believe Garth has thrown me over to become a goddamn dentist. Could really use him.”
“I’ve just cleaned vomit out of your favourite saucepan,” Cas says, “And it turns out we do own a bucket.”
“You know,” Castiel says, as he picks around the room retrieving the laundry they shed all over their bedroom at various points in the past two days, pausing at the panties that ended up half under the bed. Dean is propped up against the pillows on their bed reading through Castiel's latest article for the food magazine before he sends it off to them, because Dean is an excellent boyfriend. “There are twelve months in the year.”
Sam deflates slightly and breaks his gaze for the first time since they’ve begun their conversation, looking down at his black coffee with an expression that’s much too complicated and weary for an eighteen year old.
He writes that Dean ‘understands the practical necessities that underpin food’ while ‘coaxing joy’ from cheap tinned tomatoes. He writes about the spark of smugness that came when he realised Dean had bothered to shower but not eat before coming over. He writes that he feels disturbingly pleased to see Dean poking around his kitchen, given that at this point they have known each other for three days. Dean can see the goddamn metaphor now Charlie has pointed it out to him, in the line about Cas projecting his own doubts about the potential for a meal because of years of him trying to cook himself crap pasta. He talks about tinny tasting tomato sauce that he tried to mask with salt and drown out with basil. He talks about the frustration of understanding the mechanics of how good food

“I have some wiring problems when it comes to you too, Dean,” Cas says, “And I find it incredibly endearing.”
Castiel gets through the door of his apartment eight minutes later, his gaze automatically checking for any sign that Meg has been in the property since he left this morning. Instead, there is just his half-abandoned coffee in the kitchen and the stack of his notes that he knocked over on his way out of the door.
“You turned it off?” Cas says, finally detangling himself to engage in a serious head-tilt soul searching stare. Two more messages from Sam that Dean’s definitely not going to read with Cas looking over shoulder. He can deal with that - with
that was pressed into his forehead. Anna already had to leave and Gabriel’s classes were about to start, too, but --

“Bought you a program of this semester's evening classes, too,” Bobby says, “Sam's picked you some out.”
“Okay,” Dean says, taps his fingers against the edge of the sofa and straightens up. There’s not a lot he can say about that. It’s not like it’s not deserved, but it still doesn’t feel great to find a leak in Cas’ reservoir of patience.
“I don’t know,” Castiel says. He’s unsure if this is the time for such painful honesty, but he isn’t going to
“No problem,” Dean says, through the hollow in his throat. Everything is very quiet inside his head as Castiel stands up. He inadvertently kicks the seat as he stands. His hands self-consciously straighten out his chef jacket. He’s

. It mentions their fight. Sam's publicly apologising and appealing for him to come home and it's been shared over and over and Dean was too locked up in his own thoughts to check.
“Later tonight,” Dean corrects, grip tightening on his phone. Sam is gonna have his ass so damn hard, and Dean's got nothing sensible to tell him, but it's… Its gonna be worth it. Or he’ll break himself all over again. One of the two.
“Dean, I didn’t mean to worry you,” Castiel says. He’d like to  cross the kitchen and coax the rest of the tension out of Dean’s shoulders with his thumbs, but he’s not entirely sure that it would be welcome and… this is not standard-Dean behavior. He has always found Castiel’s habit of not looking at his phone annoying, but not genuinely worrisome. “She cornered me with tea and sympathy.”
“Sorry sweetheart, we’re not living in a Disney movie,” Dean says, and Castiel makes a point to nudge their knees together under the table, because Dean is too busy with cutlery to hold his hand and too far away to kiss and he wants to feel closer.  “Still think you’re brave as hell.”
kind of kiss that still has him reeling, but allows his thought to regulate a little bit, which is good. Thinking. “The whole point of not being a tax accountant anymore was for my work not to hurt anyone.”
Castiel orders more expensive wine and Dean overhears him telling the other attending guests that he’s bisexual.

“Just don’t feel like I’m bringing a lot to the table, right now.” Dean says, small and directed at the floor, which is, of course,
A guy named Aaron is hitting him at the dumb LGBT meet and greet thing scheduled for the first night of the cruise. They’re down for week long cruises for the almost-end of the season which at least means that Dean only has to deal with this guy for the next seven nights before he’s off, because…. Because suddenly he feels super uncomfortable about it.
“You don’t,” Dean begins, then cuts himself off. Castiel looks at him. “Can help with the cooking crap. It’s literally my job.”

“Ooh-kaay,” Dean says, taking the scrap of paper from Castiel’s hands and frowning at it, “You… I owe you the consumption of four salads,” Dean reads, forehead creasing into a frown. He raises an eyebrow as he scans Castiel’s face for some recognition, expression blank. “I don’t get it.”
“Absolutely,” Castiel says, smile wide, “Although my understanding is that the prerequisite for breaking up is - ”
when he said that, because otherwise Dean would have done something, changed something, said something else.

“Hmm,” Cas says, casually scrolling through his phone to find the number of the Thai place, “I had alternative plans for you, before we were needed here.”
“Hmm,” Cas says, sitting up and stretching. Dean winds up watching the curve of his spine give way to shoulders, arms - good, solid arms that are more than capable of pinning him to the goddamn bed - then his broad hands. Damnit. “I suppose if

like a rejection, though, and Dean’s the worst at rejection. They claw away inside his head and consume him.
“You’re doing well,” Cas says, after he’s loaded up the machine with his crap on the shortest spin cycle, then turned back to face him. There’s maybe a twelve inch distance between them thanks to the way the machines are spaced out in Cas’ buildings, which feels in equal parts unsurmountable and

“I don’t want to talk about this right now,” Castiel says, grip shaking on his phone. He is hopeless when he is emotional; he is
“Those shirts do not do him justice,” Castiel says which, okay, is kind of reasonable. He gets that Sam is in good shape (a helluva lot better shape than Dean, but who’s counting?) and that his lumpy flannel and jeans usually mask that fact, and maybe he could objectively say that Sam is not terrible-looking, but -- Cas is checking out his brother. That is a violation of a lot of the laws of the universe that Dean holds dear.
“Hey,” Dean says, stepping back to let him into the room with an attempt at a smile. He’s been feeling pretty awful today. It’s all been gnawing away and his insides and he’s exhausted and hasn’t been sleeping since he got here, because he’s too restless and there’s too many thoughts in his head. He left Sam that stupid voicemail and then he wanted to take it all back and shove the words back into his throat, into that deep place in his chest, and then he wanted a drink, so then he called Cas. It’s not a great trajectory but… On Tuesday night, Cas kept his word about them not talking about any of it when they came over. It seemed like he’d taken on board all the rest of the things Dean said, because he didn’t greet him with the usual kiss at the door, somehow twisting it so it didn’t feel like a rejection. It wasn’t exactly a

“And I’ve got plans for you, tough guy.” Dean says, piling up their dishes to try and do some damage control with their kitchen. Two people shouldn’t be able to generate so much freaking
“I cooked you a freakin’ omelette,” Dean says, the words catching in his throat, “But, uh, I guess I know that. That I can cook. It just, feels like my whole freaking life is in a bit of a rut right now, and it… Don’t enjoy it, right now.”

“We’re somewhere between Athens and Rhodes floating thousands of miles away from your family, who didn’t know your current cell number. You’re… alone enough to come to a relative stranger for help. I’ve known you for just over two weeks and I’ve seen you seclude yourself and self-destruct and I want to know why.”
“Hello, Dean.” Castiel says, very seriously. Dean almost smiles at that but the expression dies before it gets to his face, leaving him just looking at him in the front seat.
“I'll take the damn scenic route if it'll make you happy,” Dean interjects, more tension that he realised he was still carrying in his shoulders slipping into his voice. Right now, he just feels resigned to all of it. He feels
“And pie,” Dean adds, which apparently is motivation enough for Cas to lean forward and kiss him again, briefly. It's the first physical contact Dean's gotten in hours and it's ridiculous how much his body curves into it, like he's been touched starved for months rather than since lunch. Fucking

“Probably for the best,” Castiel says, beginning to sort their laundry into lights and darks. “About the ‘freaky’ amount of women's underwear I purchased you…”
“I have a day off tomorrow,” Dean says, delivering Cas’ drinks even though he’s not actually on shift. He’s been wondering around looking for his opportunity (Cas’ routine is pretty predictable) and then he just… found himself grabbing Cas’ coffee. Castiel looks up at him, eyes widening slightly. “You ever been to Malaga?”
“I assure you, it’s more for my own benefit,” Castiel says, leaning forward to brush his nose against Dean’s cheek and pulling the covers round them a little more. “But —- we do need to make some decisions.”
“Yeah,” Dean says, “I’m —- look, I know you deserve a lot fucking better, but I’m really not ready to talk about that yet.”

believe that Cas thinks that. In fact, Cas has been patient and sort of unassuming and shockingly understanding about the whole fucking thing. He’s careful with his language but not necessarily that careful with Dean -- at least, Dean doesn’t feel like he’s being treated like a fucking victim (most of the time), even if Cas is steering well clear of any his boundaries and making a point to verbalize that --  and he normally manages to strike up a conversation about it in such a way that Dean doesn’t actually want to throw himself out the fucking window, but acknowleding

into his arms at his dad’s funeral and the one who said he loved him at the Beach House and he’s perfect and Dean really goddamn wishes that was enough to eclipse everything else.
“You shouldn't be,” Dean says, grip tightening on his coffee as heads back to his bedroom. He’s been a shitty enough human this week that he’s not actually sure which shift Sam is working or whether he’s at his internship today or tomorrow, but he doesn’t want to face his brother’s wrath right now.
“And you promise me that if you need to speak to someone about this, you will call Hannah or Kelly or Gabriel to discuss it?”
. Sam used to like them, though. He’d always swipe some whenever they were here, cracking them open in the middle of the night in empty-motel rooms to wrap narratives around him. Dean always thought it was about the stories themselves, but now Dean’s beginning to think that maybe it was something about having a piece of home on-the-road; this reminder that there was a place where someone tried to encourage them to do their homework and made sure they had lunch to take to school.

Castiel hasn’t spoken to another human being (bar the cashier at the shop) face to face since he said goodbye to Dean at the Beach House. His standard for ‘good company’ at this point is very low, but pointing that out doesn’t feel appropriate given it’s clear Dean’s already made up his mind.
“I love you too,” Charlie says, fists bumping his arm, “Obviously, we’ll have to create a new album for the non-European adventures and I’m kind of bummed out too… but we have two weeks and this sounds a

, but he’d picked a patch of sand that never fully gets overtaken by the sea, so it had been okay. He’d sat and sobered up a little, safe in the knowledge that he still had vodka left in the bottle when the clarity got too sharp and real again.
“Tomorrow,” Dean says, shutting his eyes, head slumping back onto Castiel’s shoulder and… and Castiel can’t really bring it upon himself to argue, because he keeps thinking about Dean half-hunched over in the bathroom
“Okay,” Castiel frowns, forehead creased. Their conversation has been quiet enough that he doubts Sam heard all of it, but Dean has never been very good at hiding irritation. The fact that he is

“Roger that,” Dean says. He closes the palm around the impala keys and smiles. Leans back against the body of his car. “Call you when I get to Sioux Falls.”
“On the show?” Dean asks, “Yeah. She’s haunting Doctor Sexy’s ex-wife. It’s, uh, yeah one of the weaker plotlines running.”
“May I …?” Cas half asks, eyes wide and blue, and Dean suddenly has a vivid memory of Cas teasing the crick out of his neck at the Beach House with his thumb, right before Sam interrupted them.
It’s possible that it’s a bullshit request so Cas can keep an eye on him and make sure that he doesn’t do anything else
his own space, but Cas’ childhood felt almost like his own by proxy. He was pretty unhappy, back then, but… bumming around in Cas’ room, watching dumb TV and hanging out were the good parts of it all. Yeah, things got… complicated and difficult, but Cas was still his solace from
“All right,” Dean says, raising his bet by one and setting his cards down as Cas comes over to kiss him, briefly on the rough of Dean’s cheek. “You call that a goodnight?”
, it just sucks that Dean's happiness is so tied up in Sam's well-being and looking after him that it all gets too complicated for him to take a breather and smell the roses.
Dean has his own key to the Beach House, these days, but he pauses to take a picture of the place framed by the dwindling-blue sky and send it to Sam, first.
“It’s a date,” Dean says, slapping his hands on Cas’ table before disappearing to overthink for the three hours he has before his poolside singing shift.
shit. Dean wasn’t building a damn thing up in his head and Cas… Castiel is awesome. He’s one of the most incredible people Dean’s ever met and the guy cares, a lot, and he can get Dean to enjoy frigging museums and can pick out restaurants he’ll love and totally fail at pick up lines like some nerdy virgin, even if he’s far from it. Cas is

Sam stares at him. Dean’s chest does a pathetic little jolt, that might just be his sanity’s death throes.
“Yep,” Dean says, leaning on the counter and waiting for his coffee, which Charlie is taking her sweet time making for him. He’s epicly hungover, which is a shitty start to the beginning of the rest of his life, but it took a while for the voicemail from Sam to turn up (except it didn’t really; Cas must have stopped in on Sam and given him the frigging keys the morning after his flight, jet lag be damned) and he was antsy and freaking out and actually solidly convinced that Cas was going to deliver, which meant he was lonely and miserable too. Then he got the message from Sam, which made him feel both crappier and relieved, which was at least sixteen emotions more than he could deal with. His good intentions hadn’t translated to flushing his vodka, either, so.

“Cas is calling you,” Sam says, brandishing Dean’s phone in his direction, which is currently blaring out what he vaguely recognises as his ringtone. That means it’s morning, then. After ten AM most likely. He must slept more than he thought before he woke up, or that he's slept some propped up on his elbows against the toilet seat.
He hadn’t thought about it until he tried to constrict all those feelings and hurts into words Sam could understand, but now he thinks about it every time he looks out at the sea. He did it with the mediterranean, looking out across the english channel, the cold, lonely waters around Russia and the last time he wound up at a Palo Alto beach trying to regulate every damn thing that’s spinning through his head.
It’s a violation of Castiel’s view of the world for Dean to sustain serious and significant hurts, over and over, and Castiel being powerless to stop it. It doesn’t matter that it happened years ago, he

On Thursday, it’s still raining and they play scrabble. Dean agrees on the condition that Cas only uses ‘real words’, specifically crap he’s heard Dean say out loud. Somehow that translates to Cas trying to spell out as many dirty words as possible, and that turns into a pretty heated debate about whether Dean’s ever said the word fellatio, that turns pretty heated. At some point, the board gets knocked off the table and Dean winds up trying to dig out the scrabble letters from under the fridge with half the buttons of his shirt undone.

“But it’s not —- accepted a long damn time ago that this stuff was probably going to affect me, in one way or another, for the rest of my life,” Dean says, peeling the words out from under his skin.

“Gabriel you haven’t spoken to him in years, you don’t know his drinking habits,” Castiel says, “Although, yes, that was… unexpected.”
“I’ll give you memorable,” Lisa says, “And if you pass through here on your way back from New Haven, I wouldn’t ignore your call.”
“Okay,” Castiel agrees, and there’s something about the rough gravel in his voice that fills him with a reckless sort of energy, and they’ve been sitting so close for the last few minutes, and Dean feels warm and something a bit like comfortable, with this nervousness prickling under his skin and Dean thinks

Dean snorts into his beer and reaches for the TV remote, switching the damn thing off and leaning into Cas’ space. Friday nights not at work are still a goddamn novelty, even if his work-life boundaries are about six hundred times better than when he met Cas (as in, he actually has a life
“I have,” Castiel says, taking his second slice of toast and eyeing it seriously, “No particular feelings about aliens.”

“It’s done,” Cas says, retreating into himself, “I’ve taken the job. I don’t know what you expect me to do now. I’m not going to undo it.”

. It’s a little like how Cas hugged him at the funeral, only now Dean’s got less to explain it away with.
“I’m —- I’m sorry,” Castiel says, fixing him with one of those intense, serious looks. They’re sitting very close to each other again. “I didn’t know I was doing that.”
“Your dating your food critic,” Sam says, shutting his book on the bar with a muffled thud, that fucking hoodie on again, sat in Dean's front room like he belongs there. He did, once, before he moved out to start his whole life with Jess a few blocks away.  “And he doesn't know about it.”
“Right up until the last couple of hours,” Dean smiles, one of those slightly bitter ones that makes Castiel want to spring into action and fix things, that sours and curdles in his stomach when it’s his fault for putting it there. “Yeah, me too. Goodnight, Cas.”
. It'll make it sound like Dean's just making some call on a whim because he had a crappy week and he never wants to not have access to speak to Cas again, but he just ---  he just doesn't want to not be able to call Cas, ever. He wants. He wants and he wants and he's freaking wanted for years, and the rest of the bullcrap just feels so much smaller right now.
