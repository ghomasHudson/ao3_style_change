Castiel felt a shiver run through him. Of course, he knew what kind of man John had been when his mother had found him. He never understood her attraction to the elder Winchester, though since their union he has seemed to improve.
“Like what?” Cas said, though he knew what Dean was getting at.
“It’s his right thumb, so don’t even think about taking him out now.”
“You’re not the boss of me,” Dean grumbled, but dutifully put the car in gear.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Because Claire is eighteen, she can make her own decisions.”
Dean followed him out, cursing at the Croats who were beginning to circle.
Cas thought the conversation would end there, but he felt a sharp sting to his shoulder blades. He turned around and saw Dean wielding his mop like a sword.
“My old man got home yesterday, and he’s out again tonight. I don’t know what’s gonna happen to me when he’s finally gone for good,” Meg said, eyes ahead.
Dean poked around aimlessly for a while, listening for Cas’s footfalls.
Dean lasted all of two minutes, furiously pumping Cas’s length at the same rhythm, and Cas was gone, spilling over himself as he felt Dean finish inside him.
“Cas, I’m,” and before he could warn him he was letting go, splashing down Cas’s throat.
Castiel fell quiet, and soon the boys had Indiana Jones playing on the ceiling, lying side by side.
“Yeah, well, it was fucking worth it to see the look on her face. And to get this back,” Dean said, quickly putting the dish under his bed, before dressing himself.
“If I tell you I’ll pray for him, will you roll your eyes?” Cas asked.
Silence fell upon the car, before Castiel spoke again.
Cas followed Dean out of the cabin, giving wordless farewells to Claire and Charlie.
Cas awoke to a yellow grin. The man before him was tall, pale, and dirty. His grin was crooked. Cas could smell his breath from where he lay prostrate on the ground. The woman with the cruel mouth who liked his eyes was nowhere to be seen. He sensed he would have been better off with her, as miniscule as the improvement would have been.
Cas flinched as Dean's laugh echoed through the truck, the only sound save for the soft crunch of rubber on dirt.
“I can go to a different school, if you want me to,” Cas whispered that night. He wasn’t sure if Dean heard him.
"Yes."
The first Christmas at the Novak-Winchester’s began with blood. For the week leading up, Naomi invented more and more obscure places that Dean and Cas could clean and organize, until even the molding under the second floor landing got the toothbrush treatment. At night, the room was so cold that Dean was forced into Cas’s bed each night. John finally intervened when he noticed the beds of Castiel’s fingernails at Christmas Eve dinner, raw and bleeding all over his mashed potatoes.
Dean held down his hip, and began driving his fingers hard against the spot.
With the sunset bathing them in its warm glow, Cas believed him.
Dean carefully tapped the final nail on the final board into place. He walked backwards and grinned, admiring his own handiwork. He turned to the new occupants of the cabin, and even Claire’s professional sulk couldn’t dim Castiel’s bubbling enthusiasm.
Cas tiptoed down the stairs, waiting for Naomi to appear and drag him to hell. Cas made it out the door, the thunder covering up the front door’s slam, rain seeping into his pajamas, making his skin clammy and cold. It must be after midnight, but the heavy rain sounded like gunshots in the empty streets.
Dean dismissed the group with a simple wave, and turned on his heel, heading away from the discontent assembly. Cas sat uncomfortably in the dirt for a few moments more, until Dean looked over his shoulder, and cocked his head to the side. Cas scrambled to his feet, appearing at Dean’s side in an instant.
“I like it here, Dean,” Cas said softly, breaking their silence as they neared his tent.
“I’ve seen you sitting with him,” Dean mumbled, his heartbeat slowing down the further he got away from the crowd.
After he came again, Cas jumped up, wild, and started sketching, Dean outstretched in the hay.
Cas didn’t dare fly low enough to try and communicate, but three long blasts from the truck told him that his friends knew they made it out alive. Somehow, Cas managed to land them in another corn field without killing them both. And Cas refrained from making fun of Dean vomiting over the side of the plane when they got out. The two sprinted to the truck, forced to squish in the back of the cab for the rest of the ride home, and though the journey became much more comfortable after Dean pulled him into his lap. And if Dean pressed a gentle kiss to the back of his neck, well, no one said anything.
It was sometime after two, and Dean didn’t expect Cas to actually be awake still.
“Don’t worry, I’ll take care of you,” Dean whispered into Cas’s stomach, causing the man to giggle.
“Lay off, Meg,” Dean said, hoping he sounded menacing.
Cas trailed behind his leader, feeling the stress radiate off of Dean. They approached one of the older cabins, which Castiel recognized as the one belonging to Benny. Dean rapped sharply on the doorframe, then stepped back carefully, in time for a tired Andrea to open up the door, glaring warily up at Dean.
Winded, his voice sore from breathing in too much winter air, Cas merely held up the dish in response, before bounding up the stairs. Dean was in their room, though all the lights were off.
In Arizona they found Charlie, a former professional gamer who had set herself up in an old arcade, using the lights and sounds to disorient Croats before she took them out from a hiding place in the rafters. Turns out she was as good at shooting in real life as she was virtually.
“No sweat,” Meg said, but Casteil could hear a strain in her voice, “Wanna come over?”
“I am not ‘cool,’ Charlie.”
Cas woke up on Saturday refreshed. It’d been less than a week since Dean’s midnight apology, but ever since then, something has shifted between them. Dean smiled at him when he came down for breakfast on Tuesday, and then in the car to school he started asking about his friend Charlie, and kept talking to him even as they were walking into school. Dean’s eyes still went a little wide when they ran into Gordon and other soccer players by the gym, but he just waved and kept talking to Cas about baseball of all things. While he certainly didn’t expect such a change, he couldn’t help but feel warm. Maybe the step brothers could be friends after all.
After they returned home, Castiel snuck into the backyard and dialed Meg’s number.
Before Dean could speak, Cas piped up, “I know what you’re going to say, I’m a failure.”
Dean had volunteered. Of course he had, and Cas volunteered himself in retaliation, and before they could finish arguing, Jo had run into the room. There was a scuffle and a shot and then the woman came out sporting a big bite on her arm. Ellen cried as she locked Jo back in the room with jugs of water and piles of food, fit for a last meal. And Cas hated the relief he felt that it wasn’t Dean in there.
“Ha! I knew you didn’t trust her,” Charlie stuck a triumphant finger in Dean’s face.
“Is it the virgin thing? I can go find Amelia and rectify that situation,” Cas offered.
Charlie didn’t invite them back over during break, though she did respond to Dean’s snapchats about plot holes that were “totally resolved in the extended edition”, so he figured all wasn’t lost. On New Years Eve, John went out and bought them all party hats, Naomi broke out the sparkling apple cider, and they clustered around the TV for the countdown. Sammy didn’t make it to midnight, but he slept it off in Naomi’s lap. At midnight, Lisa texted him a bunch of kissy emojis. Dean sent a bunch back, his stomach flopping.
Castiel made it out to the edge of camp where his cabin lay, and was struck by the quiet. Not silence, the insects still chorused in their hidden world. Occasionally the wind brought a drunken guffaw to his ears. But the cars were gone. The planes were gone. The urban world he had grown in had disappeared.
Cas felt that the tube in his pocket was impossibly heavy. He took some of Dean’s advice, and asked Nora to pay him weekly, while also picking up secret shifts, so he could put half his new savings into Dean’s account, so he could draw cash whenever he wanted. He didn’t spend much, but this week, he bought a corndog, rolling papers, and a bottle of lube with his employee discount (all while Nora was doing inventory in the back, he couldn’t stomach buying these things in front of her).
“Cas?” An achingly familiar voice called out.
Huh. He hadn’t thought of that. Now that he has the Impala, he could take Lisa for long drives every day, at least until sports started up again.
“We, that being Bobby, Jo, Ash, and I, chartered a plane to the Arctic, stayed with an old buddy of Bobby’s.”
He said Alan’s name like it was a curse. Was Dean jealous?
“We’re going on a little hunting expedition,” Charlie explained, before handing Cas a rifle, “It’s deer season, so we should at least be able to take down a couple bucks.”
After four days, they made it down to Texas, and Dean had some explaining to do. They had to ditch the Impala somewhere in Nevada. As much as it pained Dean to say goodbye to Baby, big American cars were gas guzzlers, and every pit stop could mean the end of their family. They traded it in for a Honda minivan and kept moving. Good thing they traded up when they did.
“I dunno,” Dean said, flopping on his back, “I never really thought college was gonna be an option. But my grades aren’t that bad, anymore at least. Cas’s tutoring helps.”
“Did she hurt you?” Dean asked, suddenly crossing the room, lightly inspecting him.
“Let’s hit the DMV before school, get you street legal,” John winked.
“Castiel, have a seat,” John said.
They set out before dawn, straight north, to the headquarters of an old subsidiary of Roman Enterprises, Sucrocorp in the middle of Oklahoma.
One day in August, Meg showed up at the front door, muttered something about moving to New York, and shoved an acrid smelling bag in Dean’s hands.
Dean could practically feel the eyes start to gather on their little scene, and his mouth went dry. He didn’t have a plan, he didn’t know what to say, everyone was going to think he was such a fucking loser he’d have to drop out-
“I’m gonna need you to trust me, and not ask any more until I think you can know, can you do that?”
“I don’t approve of secrets, they are Satan's tools,” Naomi said.
Dean studied his little brother’s face, his face highlighted with parallel lines of light, filtering down from the floorboards they hid beneath. His brother hadn’t questioned Dean’s bruised jaw and put two and two together. Small miracles.
“That worked up already baby?” Dean noticed how Cas squirmed every time the word rolled off his tongue.
“Never call me buddy while you’re inside of me,” Cas sighed.
“It’s ok.”
“Let’s smoke before he gets back,” Dean said, Cas eagerly agreeing.
Dean started to worry about how he would handle the winter, but then he fell in with Gordon, this senior on the soccer team, who started giving Dean a ride home after practice. And if they snuck a beer in a parking lot before Dean got home, who would be the wiser?
“Thank you Dean,” Cas said, but even in the dark Dean could tell his face was red, and that he was fighting back tears.
“You know who I’m thinking about,” Cas said, closing his eyes, because if he looked at Dean it would be over, and who knew when he would have this again?
“Oh.”
“I like Lisa,” Cas said idly on their drive home.
Both had enough scars from their separation, from their losses, to last a lifetime, and suddenly Cas felt rather than saw Dean watching them. The older man turned away, but Cas ran after him, wrapping his arms around Dean’s middle.
“Where the hell were you?” John roared as the boys stepped in the door, arms crossed in front of the door.
Castiel let himself relax, the tightness he’d felt since their movie marathon slowly releasing. Charlie had been nothing but good to him, and he was worried he’d permanently damaged their friendship. After the ghost goons (Ed, Harry, and Garth) filed out, Castiel offered to walk Charlie home.
Cas took a step back, putting his bike in between Dean and himself.
“Do you actually believe in all this God shit?” Dean asked.
When they got home, Dean silently started taking out the cleaning supplies, not so much as looking in his direction. That suited Castiel fine, and he began to take a sponge to the fridge, wiping off the accumulated grime from a week’s worth of meals. Naomi kept a very clean house, and normally maintained a maid to clean it, but she had suspended the service for the duration of the boys’ punishment.
“Nope,” Dean said, immediately ejecting the game.
“Yeah, I’m sure.”
John silenced Sammy’s whine, though Cas saw a flicker of doubt on the older man’s face. From Castiel’s understanding of their life before their families merged, John’s word was law, even if those words were often slurred. It must be odd for the Winchester brothers to see their father yield like this.
“Yeah. It is nice,” Dean murmured, wrapping an arm around Lisa’s shoulder.
The last words John Winchester said to Dean were incoherent and unmemorable. Dean’s last word to John was “Sorry,” mingled among broken sobs. His words were probably just as incoherent, as he groveled through the blood welling inside his mouth.
Dean didn’t know what came over him, but he found himself standing up, Jane sliding off with an angry grunt. He looked down, and had the decency to help her up, and look sheepish, but he made his excuses quickly, and took off after Cas.
“Is Sam back?” she asked, her voice edged with worry.
He drifted to the dinner table, dreading turning up to Gordon’s empty handed. Maybe he could take a dive in some bushes and pretend he got mugged? That could work, but he’d need proof, and he didn’t feel like splitting his own lip. Maybe he could just not go, say he had other stuff to take care of. That option was seeming better and better, until he got a text. He tried to check it subtly under the table.
“Oh shit, like the flu?” Dean asked, “Think you’re coming down with something?”
“What the hell is that?” Dean asked as Cas lugged a large object underneath a sheet across the parking lot..
“The audio-visual club. I worry that a media based club won’t appeal to her, considering her feelings on most media, but I will frame it as a skill building endeavor,” Cas said.
After dinner, Dean decided to check the crawl space above his room. It was a long shot, but if he knew John, he knew that the sober act could only last so long. While Castiel was downstairs, Dean took a screwdriver to the hatch above his bed, and pushed back. No six pack, but a big bottle of vodka winked back at him. Dean felt a rush of excitement, but felt himself deflate after. Part of him hoped that he wouldn’t find anything.
“Meg, you may appreciate my accessories from an appropriate distance,” Cas said, voice steady even as his eyes widened.
“I’ll keep my dumb mouth shut for once, so you’ll have a fighting chance,” Dean winked, slipping downstairs.
“I cannot tell if you’re kidding or not. Let’s at least invite the AV club over, maybe set up the projector against the house. It’ll be fun.”
“I’m not an underclassman,” Dean snapped.
Dean rounded on her, “You want to get rid of every scrap of my mom. She was the love of his life, you’re nothing.”
feelings towards the teen. And this morning, when Dean had taught him how to shave, that was something brothers do for each other, and no amount of imagination on Castiel’s part would be able to change the nature of that relationship.
“No!” Sam and Castiel said at once.
Cas leaned up carefully. He stared down, propping himself up on his elbow, and he tried to gauge if Dean was really asleep, or just faking.
The music was quieter downstairs, but it took Dean a few tries to get the older boy’s attention, awkwardly hovering in his periphery. Gordon’s eyes lit up at the proffered bottle, and he ran upstairs with the promise of getting shot glasses.
Dean sighed again, and pushed himself up, pacing, his heavy boots causing the boards to creak with every step. Chuck would have him fretting over this until the boy went crazy in isolation. If he wasn’t crazy already. Who knows what kind of psychological damage had he suffered? Unfortunately, his other two advisors, Sam and Charlie, were out looking for a bigger food source, far out of Croat-Ville. They weren’t due back for another three days. Dean couldn’t wait that long. He needed answers.
things about him. He could notice the splash of freckles across his face, his slightly bow legged gait, the way his biceps swelled when he crossed his arms, the almost pedantic pout that usually accompanies the gesture, his raunchy sense of humor and the shit eating grin he wears after telling a joke…
“Yeah, he’s a good dude. I’m Charlie,” she said with a smile.
“Now how about you tell me how you made it out here?” Dean sat down in the one stool occupying the corner of the dank cabin.
After the founding of their little haven  two years ago, not once, not even on the fruitless rescue missions they launched during the first month of the last wave of infection, had Dean ever found someone untouched by the Croatoan virus outside of the safe camp walls. All the men they lost in that first month, just trying to rescue their loved ones back. They all soon learned to forget the ones they left behind.
“Well I need a chance to redeem myself!”
Dean pressed his lips to Cas’s collarbone, and they wouldn’t call it a kiss, but Cas felt Dean’s mark on his torn soul.
Charlie jogged lightly out of her cabin, making her way around the revelers to arouse the least suspicion. Cas followed her, even though Dean hadn’t asked him to come back. Cas slipped in his cabin, right behind Charlie, and made himself small in the corner as he normally did during council meetings. In the interim, Dean had managed to tie the woman to a chair, with apparently a little more struggle, judging by the fresh claw marks that Cas could barely make out on his face, even in the darkness of the room.
Cas went back to painting, as if he didn’t turn Dean’s world upside down.
“Get on down there,” Bobby grunted.
Dean jumped after him, the mattress springing beneath him, Castiel’s knees making awkward contact with Dean’s chest, forcing a pained exhale.
Sammy looked back, and dove across the bench. Dean hopped in shortly after, and peeled out of the parking lot.
“Thank you,” Cas mumbled.
“Benny’s not working today. He’s hurt,” she said, before Dean could utter a word.
“You boys got prom dates?” John grunted, tearing into his breakfast.
Cas slid into the front seat, carefully watching the door. Ten minutes went by, and then twenty. Cas almost walked back in, when Dean burst out, his face twisted with rage.
“It’s water?” Dean tried, but Cas just glared at him harder.
“Wait, a cure?” Cas leaned forward, all his attention zeroed upon Ash. He couldn’t help but think of the siblings he was forced to leave behind. His old friends, his neighbors. His parents.
“Oh, uh, fuck,” Cas said.
Soon after, Dean’s second in command, Sam, showed the two of them to some vinyl tents, pitched outside some of the ramshackle cabins in the survivor community.
Just then he noticed they were back on their street, and that the living room lights were on.
“One must always be dressed appropriately Castiel,” Naomi said, sitting primly next to John in the stands.
“I’m sorry I caused you pain Dean,” Cas said.
Dean pulled up next to a surprisingly solid door at the side of the factory. Cas hopped out, hefting his weapon. They didn’t actually have a blueprint of the factory, but if it was similar to the one where Ellen had worked, the layout indicated that if there was a cache of the liquid poison, it would be in the processing hub, where they used to refine the corn syrup. According to Ellen, that’s how Roman first distributed the virus, in a tainted batch of corn syrup, that got processed into soda, cereal, frozen yogurt, canned fruit, bread.
“Texas. He’s meeting us in Texas.”
“Meg getting clingy? Chicks tend to be like that,” Dean said, though he winced as soon as the words left his mouth when he met Cas’s glare.
“Claire!” Cas shouted, the tension seeping from his shoulders, he let his gun fall.
“Well we need to take your mind off of shit you can’t control, like God’s holy wrath,” Dean flopped on the bed.
Dean begged Bobby for a summer job, ostensibly to start saving for college, but really he just needed fucking out of the house. Dean rode with John to Bobby’s shop on his first day.
Dean breathed out, the tense atmosphere of the room failing to dissipate, even after Jess’s departure.
Quiet breaths turned into sighs and grew into moans as Dean worked two more fingers in. working them in tandem, straining against Cas’s tight interior, while Cas held back his discomfort, though he felt his face ache with the strain of keeping his face calm.
“Dean, lower your voice, we are in public,” Naomi hissed.
“Don’t you have, like, responsibilities back home?” Dean tried.
“We’ll rescue Dean,” Claire said to Cas, her words empty.
“I’m sorry,” Cas whispered to his sister, who still had her weapon to the back of Dean’s skull.
“Are you going to kill me?” Castiel asked, jutting his chin out, his eyes more weary than scared.
Dean saw guilt etched on Gabe’s face, but the older boy just lurched forward and turned up the radio, letting Zeppelin drown out the feeling. Dean wrapped an arm around Cas as they drove into the night-- someone had to be there for him.
“Why are you ashamed of me, Dean?”
“Where’s Dean,” Castiel demanded, staring as hard as he could at the backs of the heads in front of him.
After Naomi started chemo, she switched from wanting Cas stitched to her side, to banishing him from her sight. If she found him in her line of vision, she would send him to rake the lawn, or wash the car, or go for a run down to the church to see if the pastor needed any help. Dean took Cas to the barn more and more, idling the evenings away with Meg’s old stash, which they’d have to re-up soon.
Cas regretted telling Dean about his apparent sexuality crisis. He had been so caught off guard by Meg’s advances, but he should have called Charlie. Though admittedly Meg had made it plain she was interested in Castiel carnally, he still hadn’t expected her to kiss him. While it hadn’t been repulsive, Castiel didn’t imagine that he should feel thoroughly indifferent to his first kiss.
“We sold the house in Lawrence, and were on the road ever since. Well, until Sam split at 17 for California. The outbreak hit when he was a freshman at Stanford.”
“Two weeks, and we’re out of here,” Dean sighed, unaware of the coming storm.
“A one bedroom would be too suspicious, but we could turn the second room into a studio or something,” Dean said, clicking through residences.
“This is all very sudden,” she said finally.
“Didn’t you hear me?” Dean asked, jumping on Castiel’s bed, jolting him.
He couldn’t even twist his body, to give Dean one last glance, the blackness was coming over his vision once more.
Castiel began to walk to his first class, Charlie keeping easy pace with him.
Dean panicked through dinner, even though he still savored the meatloaf. Naomi may be a frigid monster, but fuck could she cook. And she insisted on cooking every night. Though part of Dean missed greasy takeout, he was starting to get used to homecooking, and even vegetables.
“I know,” Cas said, and then pulled the lube out of his pocket.
Cas expected Dean to go back to his bed, but instead, he got up and spread the blankets over Cas, before slipping under the covers with him.
“Well those air quotes certainly aren’t cool. But like, you don’t seem to really care what anyone thinks of you, and you’re super smart. That’s cool, and Dean should be proud to know you.”
“Oh.”
party,” Andrea huffed out, her Greek accent never fading after all her years in the states.
“Shit, Cas, sorry,” Dean said, gathering the blankets back off the floor and draping them around Cas.
Dean tried to look for Lisa after school by the gym before she had swim practice. If he hurried, John wouldn’t realize he was late and somehow make his punishment worse. Dean turned the corner of the gym, only to run straight into Cas and Meg again, this time bent over Meg’s phone.
“Ever fire a gun before?” Dean asked, and felt his stomach turn as the teen nodded solemnly. He tried to find solace in the fact that at least the kid wouldn’t be too much of a liability.
“Close your eyes,” Dean said, trying to keep the excitement out of his voice.
Cas’s head snapped up.
Cas whipped his head down, suddenly sheepish, before saying, “She’s just scared. Her family left her.”
“Some things you can’t help falling for,” Cas replied, and went back to his work.
“I’ll wait here in case she tries to jump your bones again,” Dean winked.
“I brought some soup from my pantry,” Castiel murmured, moving to the stove to heat up some cream of mushroom.
“It’s too dangerous, regardless.”
“Dean, what are you talking about?”
“You can trust me,” Cas said quietly, and Dean stopped in his tracks, almost causing Cas to bump into him.
“Dean,” Cas said breathlessly, “Please don’t stop.”
After taking the first hit, instead of passing it, Dean drew Cas close. The other boy caught on, opening his mouth to accept the smoke from Dean’s lips.
Naomi had a double mastectomy scheduled for that Monday in Chicago, so she and John were going to be out of town for the next three days.
“Open the trunk,” Cas grunted.
Dean’s eyes snapped back down.
“I’m going to Victor’s party tonight, and you can’t show up empty handed. Everyone knows that, Cas.”
“Oh no you don’t mister,” The tiny woman pushed Benny back into bed, “You’re not going to leave me alone because you get taken by Croats after you can’t fire your stupid gun because you broke your stupid hand.”
Ellen, Jo, Ash, and Bobby in an empty 18 wheeler, and Cas and Dean holding up the rear in a jeep. If all went according to plan, that jeep would be filled with whatever fucked up toxins Dick Roman used to engineer the Croatoan virus. That combined with what Ash had whipped up in the bunker might just provide some immunity. They just had to get the shit from the source.
Charlie let out a long breath, and launched into a long explanation, while Cas sunk lower into the couch cushions, absently eating the burger in his lap. As soon as the movie ended, Castiel shot up from his seat, gathering their plates to bring to the kitchen. Charlie sat still on the couch, so Dean awkwardly excused himself and wandered upstairs, only to see Cas scrubbing vigorously away at their plates.
Castiel let out a bone-weary sigh.
It was at this clinic where he first spotted Dean almost a year ago to the day. Castiel had accompanied Naomi to the hospital outpatient clinic, where John had been making a stab at sobriety. What Naomi had seen in the broken man before them, Castiel would never know. But Dean, clutching Sammy’s hand tightly, had been a bright spot in the dingy room. Before they knew each other, before Dean let his defensive venom build back up, he was just a scared teenager asking Naomi tough questions about her methods.
“I’m fine, Dean. But it looks like she seriously scratched you,” Cas said, reaching up to touch the angry red streaks across Dean’s face.
Cas didn’t look. He couldn’t look. Instead he let Alan draw him into a debate about how accurate the ghostbusters franchise really was, and could tolerate the casual brushes against his arm so long as it meant he wouldn’t have to look.
The idea that a kid, who must be, what, twelve? Thirteen? Dean had no idea how old the boy was, and the idea that any kid could survive out of these walls, alone, was sheer lunacy. Which accounts for the slight overreaction at his arrival.
“Alright alright. Sure, I’ll cover for you. But when I sneak out to see Lisa, I expect the same courtesy,” Dean said, stretching himself out in bed.
“Where’s here?” He muttered, as Dean hopped out of the car.
“You don’t know shit about my dad,” Dean said.
Dean nodded, without making eye contact. He got up quickly, and before Cas could follow him, he returned, this time with a bottle of clear liquid.
The boy jumped off of the bare mattress which used to belong to Sam, and trotted over to the desk which held the many books salvaged from what used to be an elementary school. It’s not like Cas liked living alone, but it seemed like every time someone moved into his bunk, they paired off with someone in camp and left to be with them. Overtime the camp grew and grew, and housing was no longer scarce. So Cas stayed alone, and used the other mattress for extra seating.
Dean grinned, and gave one last suck before backing away to strip. Cas watched hungrily as Dean peeled away his layers. Cas tried to look sexy too, but he was too eager kicking off his boots, and his jeans awkwardly flopped down his legs. Dean didn’t seem to mind as he stalked back to the bed, lowering himself onto Cas.
Soon Dean drew back, to feel around for the lube, and Cas felt the first thread of foreboding curl in his gut. The other things, the kissing, the rubbing, those felt almost incidental. But this, this was sodomy, undeniable, irrevocable.
“Yes Castiel?” Naomi smiled at him.
“You got a crush or something Cas?” Dean said.
“She’s all I have left.”
“Want me to tell Naomi? Sabotage your little set up,” Dean asked, putting himself between John and Cas.
“I’m sorry mother, it will not happen again,” Cas said, head bent.
“Just, quit it. Or I won’t be able to say the whole thing.”
“Why would you ever come back?” Cas finally looked up.
“C’mon kid,” Dean called Cas away from his animated conversation with Chuck, to walk him back to his tent. Cas immediately jumped up, muttering a quiet goodbye over his shoulder.
“I am not an idiot,” Cas snapped.
Dean struck out the next two batters, and hit a double in the next inning. Castiel expected to be bored, but he was entranced by the movements of the players, an almost graceful waltz, and Dean was the prima ballerina. Cas felt himself grow red, he knew that Dean would resent such a feminine title, but he was a vision, his elegance on the field undeniable. Even Naomi seemed taken with the sport, though she excused herself after the fourth inning, claiming fatigue.
One day, Cas wasn’t alone. Some redheaded girl joined him, reading a comic book.
The morning of the church sale, John packed up the minivan with so many boxes that there was no space for Dean and Cas in the back.
Cas nodded, and hopped in the front seat and looked at the thankfully simple-looking controls.
“That must be Dean’s girl,” John grunted.
“What could this possibly be?” Dean asked.
Dean let out a wry laugh, “Maybe he’ll be too drunk to remember what he saw,” Dean said,
Castiel thought his heart was about to explode. Nausea welled up inside him.
Castiel didn’t do much fighting anymore. Charlie liked to tell him that in another life, he would have been the perfect soldier if it wasn’t for his leg, but only when she was drunk. He didn’t begrudge her for it. As is, Castiel managed fine with his hip, to the point where he forgot about it often, except for mornings like this.
Cas tipped his head, “Happy to have you join us,” and was that a blush on Cas’s face?
Dean took his time, massaging Cas’s tight calves, before pressing a small kiss to the inner corner of his knee, before making his way to Cas’ inner thigh. Dean then skipped up to lick at Cas’s nipple, forcing the man to stifle a gasp, before working his way back down again.
“Has she always been like this?” Den asked as Cas tried to warm himself up.
“I’m not leaving you behind,” Dean said.
“What are we doing here, Dean?”
Cas looked up from his reading, and smiled softly from the rocking chair that Dean had made him for his birthday.
Dean felt like they were waiting forever, but Gordon hadn’t come back downstairs yet, Dean didn’t know the music, and he couldn’t figure out where the beers were. Cas was ominously quiet next to him, and Dean couldn’t stand the weight of his judgement. Just as Dean was ready to give up the little experiment, Lisa materialized in front of them, two full solo cups in hand.
“Can’t, his wife’s a cop. Sammy’ll end up in foster care,” Dean grunted.
“Quit staring at me,” Dean snapped on the way to school.
“C’mon Junior, we’re going to look at animal pictures.”
“I told you, I didn’t get bitten,” Claire spit out.
That river used to run parallel to their border fence. In the intervening years, they had expanded their territory a few miles beyond it.
Dean made the decision for him, springing back and off the bed. Cas turned and saw Dean blinking up at him like he had no idea where he was.
Cas nodded along, “I just wanna help.”
Cas had started to get nightmares, and would wake up screaming, before quieting himself.
Dean entered, and his blood ran cold. Cas stood up stiffly, a knife to his neck, wielded by an angry blonde woman with wild eyes.
Humanity was fighting a losing battle, because every lost man became another Croat. The infestation took about a year, and according to Chuck, as of yesterday there were Croats on every fucking continent, save Antarctica.
Cas hummed to himself. Maybe his punishment wouldn’t be so bad afterall.
“He’s seeing Lisa,” Castiel said slowly, afraid of bringing Naomi’s wrath on Dean.
Dean groaned while Cas set about mopping the kitchen.
Dean found the spot that made Cas’s toes curl, and Cas wondered if Dean could make him cum just from this. If Cas tried hard enough Dean’s voice alone could probably send him over the edge. God knows that’s all Cas had for years was just the memory of Dean’s voice to get him through.
“You can’t stay here,” John growled, before slamming the door.
“Well Winchesters are known to beat the odds,” Dean replied, though there was no humor in his eyes.
“I need you, I need you,” Cas whispered, and Dean freed himself from his boxers, before grinding their lengths together, loosely jacking his hands around the slippery mess, too urgent to take off their underwear properly.
Find me on tumblr ! @writerposer
“Fuck,” Dean said again, and Cas nodded gravely along.
They hadn’t even had a television until John. He’d only been allowed a handful of fiction, and half of it Gabriel smuggled in with different covers. Now they even had a game system, though he and Dean didn’t have enough money between them to afford a game besides the homosexual dating simulation Gabriel had bought as a prank. Perhaps if Castiel could make the case that he could evangelize the school, she would be more amenable.
“You’re talking to me like you did when we were lost,” Cas remarked quietly, and took a step away from the cabin.
His ears registered the sound before the dead weight fell on him. Fresh blood seeped onto his shirt from the wound on the dirty man’s head. He was too numb to scream.
The hope in his voice weighed on his soul. After all these years, Sammy still trusted him. And Dean was going to get them killed.
Dean tried to make eye contact with John, looking for some recognition for how crazy Naomi was, but he was only met with a stony glare.
“Did you hunt before all this?” Cas asked, and saw Dean stiffen.
Shit was this weird? Dean closed his eyes, and imagined Lisa instead. He thought about her pressed up against him at Victor’s party, the smell of her hair, her lips on his. That was better, Dean slipped his hand into his pajamas, doing his best to keep his step brother out of his thoughts. Dean focused on last week, when during another drive in movie (the farmer who ran it only had about one tape per month that was always at least ten years old, and during a quiet stretch, Lisa had slipped a delicate hand into Dean’s jeans. The technique was a little haphazard, but Dean went off like a shot anyway.
“I’ll take care of you,” Dean said, as Cas reached for the joint.
“I will, but I’m sure it won’t hurt,” Meg said, settling into the pillows and closing her eyes.
He watched carefully ahead, as Dean kicked down the door, gun drawn, waiting for Croat activity in the lobby. Cas didn’t even flinch as Dean shot one, a long haired man, from behind immediately. It was as if someone else carefully climbed the steps behind Dean, someone who knew what they were doing, someone who didn’t stand to lose everything based on the outcome of the next few minutes.
“Actually uh, I don’t think Claire will be coming back tonight.”
“Don’t you think the boys have suffered enough?” John said with his mouth full.
Whatever it did paid pretty well. On Castiel’s 17th birthday, a shiny new Nintendo Switch appeared on the front porch. Naomi promptly confiscated it, (and Castiel didn’t so much as glance at it as she carried the box aways, to Dean’s cries), but Dean knew those shits were not cheap, so the guy must be doing well enough for himself.
That's it ! I might post some time stamps in the future.
Dean sighed, as if he had been expecting that answer.
Yet he couldn’t tell if he was faking or not.
“Dean. Look at me,” Cas grasped Dean’s chin in his hand, forcing the man to look up at him.
“This is a time honored tradition to hone combat skills in the case of sudden snow warfare,” Dean said, popping up from his snow shelter in time for Sammy to dump a toy shovel full of snow down his hoodie.
The camp still didn’t have much in the way of grooming, but Cas took an extra long time in the river after dinner, ignoring the cold bite of the water against his thighs to clean himself thoroughly. Now Cas sat gingerly on the bed, trying to figure out how to arrange himself. He was chilly, but if Dean came in and he was under the covers already, he’d think he was getting ready for bed. Should he get naked? What if Dean brought Sam over? Or Claire came to swing by. No he shouldn’t get naked, or maybe he should take his shirt off? Yes, that makes sense, he’d take his shirt off, and if Dean brought anyone with him Cas could just say he was in the middle of changing, to save embarrassment. Yes. This would work. As Cas was taking off his shirt, hands above his head, Dean came in.
“Hello, Boys.”
“Come on Cas, I’ll race you,” Dean shouted over his shoulder, already speeding down the block.
“There you are!” she said, tossing her hair over her shoulder effortlessly.
“You must be a shitty stepbrother to piss off Cas like that,” the red-headed girl attached to the hand said.
That night, Cas leaned over his shoulder as he set up the system. Taped underneath, Dean realized Gabe had snuck in a carefully etched out cartridge in a veggie-tales video game case.
“This ain’t over yet, kid,” Dean said, his gun still trained on Claire.
“Fuck,” Dean said, trying to step away from the carnage.
"I managed to stay back every time we came upon a camp. Going hungry for the night was worth my soul, I think."
“Claire, I found a community. We’ll be safe there,” Cas said, and Claire nodded back to him, keeping her gun raised as she stepped out of the room.
“Fuck,” Dean giggled, throwing the other boy down into the hay to return the favor.
“Cas, I. I knew you as a kid. I just,” Dean brushed his hand on his face.
Dean rolled his eyes and got off his bed, trying to put as much distance between him and Cas as possible.
“I don’t think I’m doing this right,” Dean said, looking at the floor.
“Do you, uh, want me to stay here? Just for tonight?” Dean asked quickly, “In case she was lying, and more Roamers show up?”
Cas thought back, to the woman’s tremors, the anxiety in her voice, how her sharp ribs were when they had pressed against him. From what he understood, Roamers were generally well fed. Roamers always hunted in twos, yet no one had been on lookout, letting Cas just walk in on her.
“Dean, I need a favor.”
“Do you think he’ll tell my mother?” Cas asked, his voice trembling. Naomi would never look at him again.
Naomi silently fumed on the way home, refusing to make eye contact with Cas. John took the van after church, saying something about helping Bobby with a special order. Sam made himself scarce too.
“I’m up, I’m up,” Cas puffed out, crawling out of bed.
Sam had teased Dean about Castiel’s supposed crush on him almost as soon as he returned to camp all those months ago. Dean dismissed him at the time, but his mind couldn’t help return to his brother’s words when the kid just kept
“Deannn-”
“Shit Cas, will you ever give the Jesus thing a rest?” Dean said, rolling his eyes, just as Lisa laughed off Cas’s comment.
Maybe in the deepest, darkest, most pathetic part of his heart, Dean felt bad for ignoring Cas every day. Walking past him at lunch took a lot out of Dean, which is why he tended to stick to his side, and let Cas sit off on his own. It didn’t help that the kid read his freaking Bible at lunch. At least he wasn’t getting beat up-- no way John would let Dean get away with not defending the kid, no matter how much he was asking for it.
“I fail to see how Charlie’s assumptions about your moral character based upon your own public actions have anything to do with me,” Cas huffed.
Dean sighed, and crawled next to him.
“You got the tickets, I’ll get the snacks,” Lisa said with a wink.
They were sprawled out in Lisa’s cozy living room, pointedly ignoring the heated conversation between her parents upstairs.
The camp rose slowly, ambling lazily to the center, half hungover, the other half still drunk. There were so few opportunities for joy, between the sunrise to sunset work of holding their small society together, any break tended to be embraced with over-indulgence.
“What’s going to happen?” Cas asked, watching the sun creep into the room.
Somehow, Castiel grew paler.
They snuck off to a dark corner of the kitchen, and suddenly Dean was kissing Lisa. When he got over the initial shock Dean tried to lean into the experience and enjoy himself, but really it just felt like they were moving their mouths against each other. Lisa broke away with a small smile, but before Dean could go back in, he heard Cas’s voice float over to him.
“So there it is,” Dean grinned, before working at the spot while Cas struggled to keep his hips still.
“Dean, you’ve made it more than clear that I am nothing to you. Let’s leave my religion out of your contempt,” Cas replied, cooly.
By the time Dean crashed back into camp, back into his life, the trees were slowly maturing within their fledgling orchard. All but one were producing olives, and Andrewa convinced them to process them the old fashioned way. They made mill stones out of old tires dipped in concrete, and ground the olives into a fine paste, before using hemp mats to press the fruit pulp slowly, squeezing the oil out into buckets. Water naturally separated off from the top, and they were left with fresh olive oil.
Castiel knew Naomi’s punishment was primarily for Dean. He’d never been allowed to partake in after school activities before. Well, Naomi had never said that he wasn’t allowed to, but he’d never been in school before at all, and so the early return home was no issue. No, Castiel’s punishment would be having to spend the next three months alone in the house with Dean. Dean who swore and took the Lord’s name in vain. Dean who insisted on endangering himself, hanging out with mean boys like Gordon. Dean, who was ashamed to know him.
“You called out for me,” Dean said, and offered nothing else.
“Meg is hardly the kind of woman my mother would be pleased to see me attached to.”
For once, Naomi let Castiel and Dean skip coffee hour, sending them home early while Sam and John trailed her as she made curt apologies. Without their bikes, Dean and Cas walked carefully on the shoulder of the road, past a semi frozen lake.
Not that Cas ever thought he could act on the near constant stream of impulses that always followed the mere thought of Dean and his frustratingly handsome face, which had plagued Castiel ever since recovering Claire.
Dean popped off, “Is this too much?”
Time stamp #1 ! This takes place a week after the main story.
“What’s your name?” Sam asked, as he led her towards the door.
“You’re probably an asshole, but I like to judge people for myself,” Charlie said, before unhitching her bike from the rack.
That did it. Dean fucking growled, pushing Cas back onto the mattress, capturing his mouth, while his fingers worked to undo Cas’s jeans. Cas hadn’t even had time to take his shoes off, so his jeans awkwardly pooled by his ankles as Dean mouthed over the outline of his cock hardening in his briefs.
Now he’s handed the keys to his own destruction to Dean. And he’s hurt Meg in her time of need, if her curses as he fled the apartment were any indication of her feelings. Dean didn’t speak for the rest of the night, the two boys getting ready for bed in silence.
Dean watched out his window as the sparse grass and dirt gave way to rolling hills. The hollow shells which used to be family homes dotted the landscape, some virtually intact, while others lay completely stripped.
“Good,” Gordon said with a nod, “And underclassmen have to bring a beer offering, just so you know.”
They didn’t talk about the kiss. They couldn’t talk about the kiss. Cas had spent all of June and July arguing with Charlie, trying to prove over and over that he couldn’t be gay, and that he didn’t have a crush on Dean, wasting hours he could have spent by mother’s side, only for Charlie to throw up her hands. She told him he wasn’t necessarily gay, and he wasn’t necessarily after Dean, but he spent a lot of time being worried about both. Cas broke down again, but by the end of the summer, was ready to set up shop in the closet. Maybe he was lost. Maybe Dean had led him astray. But when Dean held him close, and brought their lips within a breath of each other, he felt intoxicated on more than the weed. He felt free, and he told Dean as much. Being near him was enough. It was almost enough.
“What?” Dean snapped out of his thoughts.
Cas tried not to gawk. High ornate ceilings, stacks of books, and honest-to-God air conditioning.
“Was that a contraction? Maybe the Winchesters are rubbing off on you,” Dean leaned up with a grin.
Ash continued, but the bravado had quietly dissipated, “This would prevent anyone else from getting infected. And maybe, maybe, it could prevent someone who had just been bitten from turning full Croat, but that isn’t something we’re willing to test.”
Dean saw Cas hesitate, before answering, “I thought that without your antagonization, life would become more simple, but it seems as if Naomi’s severity is only tempered by illness.”
DREAM DADDY DATING SIMULATOR
“Because amidst the cover ups, half-finished manifestos, and Frankenstein Jr. experiments,” Ash spoke again, “We found the antidote.”
“Because Claire would kill me if something happened to you.”
“Do you think you’d ever want one?” Cas asked.
“You got a full ride Dean, and my mom may be severe, but she will help with other expenses,” Cas said.
Now Charlie’s glare shifted to Castiel. A terrible tension seeped into the room like noxious gas.
Dean thought about how good Cas had been at talking to residents, and how well he’d taken notes during the meeting. No, the kid definitely wasn’t a burden.
“Oh, yes that is Lisa,” Cas said, “She is quite sweet.”
“Don’t wait for me,” Dean grumbled, appreciating the irony for a moment before following Cas in.
By the time Cas snuck back in, Dean was showered and too tired to tease him about his midnight rendezvous. Even if Cas was getting some, it shouldn’t distract Dean from his goal of getting with Lisa, even if it was embarrassing to think his weird step brother had more game than him.
“I can hear you thinking from over here. Tell me what you’re thinking, or get out,” Dean grumbled, startling his advisor.
Cas knew Dean was hiding in the kitchen, listening in the wings.
At the end of the summer, Naomi finished her steroid treatment. Dean and Cas started their senior year and Sammy joined them as a freshman. Gabe showed up in September, ostensibly to celebrate Cas’s 18th birthday, but he slept on the couch for two weeks, just taking over the cooking while Naomi was on bed rest. Apparently Gabe was working as a line cook in a restaurant in Chicago, and was saving up for culinary school.
“Do you wanna help prep for tonight? A man only turns twenty three once!” Dean asked, not looking at the teen as he started to clean up the shaving kits.
And John Winchester, in his infinite wisdom, saw that first interaction, and made the boys share a room on the third floor of their new house, letting thirteen-year-old Sammy take the one on the second floor closer to the room he shared with Naomi. Dean was expecting bunk beds, but the third floor room was huge, with a giant window facing the back of the house, and it’s own little bathroom to the side. Apparently Naomi’s corporate law gig paid well-- though Dean supposed a lot of jobs paid better than being a part-time mechanic/part-time drunk. Dean crashed on the neatly made bed with glee, the new mattress springing easily. Dean breathed in the non-motel sheets and sighed. At least he’d be the only person sleeping in this bed.
“I’m worried that I have misled her. I left in a rush, and she was quite upset. I’m not used to such complicated social situations,” Cas buried his head in his hands.
Dean laughed along with the rest of the team, but he felt a twinge. It was an easy guess that Cas and his nerd patrol were virgins, but Gordon was always talking about sex. It was only a matter of time before he figured out Dean was a virgin too.
Dean felt a twinge of regret--  the poor kid must be fucking terrified. Standard protocol stated that all unexpected visitors are greeted by half the available guns at camp, but this is the only time a ‘guest’ had actually still been human. It didn’t help that the kid seemed to be covered in literal shit, and smelled like death itself. Thank god the kid cried out when he did-- Croats didn’t speak any English, and his terror saved his life. They stuffed the kid in the lockdown cabin that normally stored returning scouts for twelve hours to make sure they were still clean.
“I never said you were gay, Dean, just that you kissed me.”
“I need the money,” Dean said, his hand absently circling Cas’s bare shoulder. It was February and they were facing each other in their bed and they weren’t talking about it.
That night, the heat came back on.
“No can do, camp meeting.”
“I know what alcohol is, Dean. I want to know what you’re doing with it.”
Dean held up 3 fingers, and saw Sammy nod out of the corner of his eye. 3 seconds. 2 seconds. 1 second.
They won the game handily, Dean being carried off the field by crowing teammates, on top of the world. Castiel had never seen him so happy. So, beautiful. Cas would never miss a game. Lisa started inviting Cas to sit next to her and her friends. He liked her, she had always been kind to him, and helped Dean become kinder too, though he always looked away when they kissed after the game. He knew the feeling could be called jealousy.
“Lying is a sin, Dean. And besides, she would want to become involved. She’s already tried to petition the school to create such a club, but they claim they are unable to endorse religious clubs.”
“I was gonna go out for the basketball team,” Dean grumbled.
“I’m sure you two will look wonderful,” Cas said, carefully adding a glint to Dean’s eyes.
There were two ways to kill a Croat, bullet straight to the brain, or fire. The infection had a sort of ripening effect upon the body. A day old Croat still looked like a person, a week old Croat looked like a rotten corpse. Good thing about it, as soon as the head, the control center for the monster, was compromised, the entire body loses any animation. A dead Croat looked more like a pile of rags than a corpse, which made mowing down a group that much easier.
Cas nodded, more to himself than the room.
“They shouldn’t,” Dean said, laying an awkward hand on Cas’s back.
“Whatever you think is fair.”
Dean steeled himself for more jokes, but they never came. Same thing happened on Tuesday, which made Dean feel a little ridiculous when he sprinted away from the car that morning. Apparently, no one cared what happened at the party. Huh. Except now that creepy girl Meg sometimes hovered around Cas’s table at lunch. Dean wanted to say something, but it’s not like he was the kid’s bodyguard.
Dean rose, wiping Cas clean with loose toilet paper, but bits got stuck, already drying onto his taut skin..
"Why?"
Castiel woke as the weak morning light pierced through the cloudy sky. He rolled over, and vainly tried to reclaim sleep.
cabin
“Pick up your feet, boy,” he heard Ellen call, as she jogged past him. Cas reluctantly picked up the pace, ignoring the pain in his hip from being cramped for so long. He rounded the hill just in time to see Ellen disappear into the rusted out silo.
They found Benny defending his restaurant, and after the best meal Dean had ever had, they brought him along to.
The last weeks of winter stumbled into a cold spring. Dean made the baseball team, to nobody’s surprise. What was shocking was Naomi’s insistence on joining the family for the opening game. She was even wearing a baseball cap, though where she acquired it was a mystery.
“So,” Cas began, grateful that no one commented on the crack in his voice, “It’s like an anti-virus?”
“Hey. Fuck is it cold,” Dean shivered, drawing the blankets on the floor around him.
“Yeah, she’s one of a kind,” Dean sighed.
Castiel settled himself, before heading downstairs, seating himself in his usual spot besides Dean. Naomi was drinking coffee at the kitchen island, coffee in hand, devotional in the other. Castiel knew he had a short window, and slowly chewed toast until she put the book aside.
They had both fallen asleep in their clothes, and Cas wriggled in Dean’s lap to draw attention to the injustice. Dean broke the kiss then, mouthing at Cas’s neck, before working his way down to Cas’s jeans. Cas cants his hips upwards to give Dean’s quick fingers better access, hesitant to part for even the necessary seconds to actually undress.
“Sorry, it’ll warm soon,” Dean said, kissing under Cas’s jaw.
“You boys are family now. There’s no reason that you can’t get along,” John explained gruffly as he dropped them off at Pontiac High, though he was glaring at Dean as he said it.
He felt a little guilty about shaming Dean in public. Partly, he was fearful of giving away too much about his conversation with Meg. Granted, the first few times she cornered him with lewd remarks, Castiel felt repulsed, and was grateful for Lisa’s intervention. This last time, she passed a note to him during their science class. Castiel reluctantly met her by the lockers, but before she could explain what she needed, just putting her number in his phone, Dean interrupted them. Despite being so forward before, Meg avoided him at school for the week, disappearing around corners. Now school was out and he’d lost his chance. Castiel was too nervous to call her, what could she possibly want from him?
“What is it, baby,” Dean asked, now pulling lazily on his cock.
He continued, albeit in a much softer voice, "And now, the last of your family, is hiding-where did you say?"
Dean heard a small sigh to his left, and saw Castiel staring wistfully at the cabin.
He warily cast his eye around the cabin, avoiding Ellen’s hawkish gaze, taking in the makeshift armory which seemed to take up the entire opposite wall. Bobby was nowhere to be seen, and while Cas attempted to study the veritable science lab in the back of the relatively crummy vehicle, he was drawn back by Ellen’s voice.
“I’m sorry that your father was not good to you, but that has little to do with my mother,” Castiel said.
The two stood in silence for a moment, though Dean wasn’t sure what had made the room feel tense.
Cas gave thanks to the God he had forsaken that they were dressed. Dean ducked another swing, before running noticing the open hatch above where his bed used to be.
She propelled him further, and he slowly made his way into the cabin.
“Well, I’d be nothing without you,” Dean said, looking down at Cas’s hands, which have made their way to his own, covering them and intertwining their fingers.
“I told you, there are no others.”
“You, think you’re a homosexual?” Castiel asked cautiously.
That’s all he could do in Croat-Ville, survive.
It started with an olive tree.
“So you don’t hate me?” Dean asked, hating how his voice wavered.
“Sorry, sorry,” Alan muttered, picking his way across the yard, and flopping himself down besides Cas.
The late afternoon heat seeped rose up into the room, trapped by the rafters, and sweat eased the glide of their writhing bodies, and Cas smelt the garage and the cheap aftershave Dean bought with Cas’s employee discount and the sheets that already smelled like the two of them.
“Where will we go?” Cas asked, gathering himself.
After a few moments of companionable silence, Cas brought the soup off the stove, pouring a portion into a chipped bowl for Meg.
“So you waited for me, huh Cas?” Dean teased the tip, blowing lightly and watched Cas’s stomach spasm.
“Alright, just stop looking at me like that,” Dean warned, looking down.
Dean and Cas awkwardly tried to step out of their shoes without touching the vomit covered laces. By the time they got inside, Naomi and John were seated in the matching armchairs, forcing Cas and Dean to squeeze onto the loveseat. Dean prayed they couldn’t smell the alcohol on his breath.
“There’s also the possibility of adoption. Say anything unfortunate happens to one of the pregnant in our community, or we find any orphaned children outside of our walls, we could take them in, as others have. Though I’m a little wary of making such on the spot decisions,” Cas said, rubbing Dean’s shoulders.
Cas waited for her to complete her sentence, but she just looked down instead, placing her gun into the strap on her back.
He came to as his head continued to bump against the frame of the jeep. The sun was low in the sky.
Dean worked one finger in slowly, and Cas breathed through the discomfort, trying to get lost in the feel of Dean’s mouth on his chest. Dean worked in a second finger and Cas hissed through his teeth.
“Do you think you’re mom’s gonna make you go to a Christian school?” Lisa asked, in between rounds of SAT drills.
“Fuck,” Dean sighed into Cas’s neck, biting just below his jaw.
“Yes, and so time is of the essence. I promise to be through within the hour,” Cas said, mixing in more yellow to better match Charlie’s hair.
“Doesn’t matter, she’s still a woman,” Dean hissed, slipping back into the room.
After a few moments, “You should consider bringing Lisa Braeden here. I know you’ve been wanting alone time with her,” Cas said thoughtfully.
Cas lowered himself down again as softly as he could manage. He felt a sudden pang in his chest. He didn’t know why it bothered him so much- that he couldn’t tell if Dean was faking or not.
The creaking subsided, and Sam leaned forward again.
Cas rolled his eyes, but didn’t tell Dean to fuck off, so at 8 in the morning they walked in amicable silence to Charlie’s place. The girl flung open her bright front door, dressed like some sort of Elf princess with the ears to boot. Her eyes flicked to Dean for a moment, but instead of kicking him out, she let them both in with a big wave. Inside, Dean’s eyes landed on the hospital bed in the middle of the living room. Castiel also stopped to stare at the woman lying prone in it.
“Get back here,” Cas grabbed for Dean’s head, bringing their lips together.
"I'll need this to continue."
The fall season went by in a blur between sports and school. For the first time, Dean was actually doing kind of ok. He was too new to have a reputation, and he was surprised that teachers actually called on him instead of rolling their eyes. And he did his homework! It was basically the only thing Naomi let him do after practice anyway, but it turns out teachers like it when you turn in your shit on time. Who knew?
“Should we kill her?” Charlie wondered, eyeing the marks on Dean’s face. “She could do more damage in here, than out there.”
“Was that a kiss?” Cas asked, his chest pinning Dean down.
“I’m not at liberty to say. I mean, we’re friends. Or I thought we were friends. Do friends try to kiss each other?” Cas asked.
“We could smoke closer to the house? Then you wouldn’t have to worry about staying sober enough to drive us home,” Cas said, “Though as I say that, I feel the need to go repent.”
Dean knew what Cas was asking, and he figured it was only a matter of time before they tried to have this conversation. The man was only 26, but he loved children, which was why he was put in charge of schooling in the first place. At 33, Dean should be more ready for that question. Hell, Sammy had three kids already, and he wasn’t even 30 yet. Things moved faster these days, since the fucking zombie apocalpyse.
“Dean, Dean, stop, stop,,” Cas panted.
“Yes Dean?”
"I couldn't help but look, you know. I swear I saw a red-headed corpse, but then again, I still see her, sometimes when I'm asleep, coming after me for running."
“Castiel,” The boy's voice was surprisingly rough, no doubt from lack of water in the midst of puberty.
“Sorry, I know you don’t like to talk about before, I shouldn’t have asked, I’m sorry,” Cas backtracked.
Cas tried to tamp down his anxiety when Dean pulled his keys out of the ignition, and followed him out of the car.
“I’m gonna take care of you, but the walls have ears. We’re going to have to keep it down,” Dean said, Cas nodding vigorously in reply.
“Fine. I trust that you can share this information with him, and then Sam when the time is right. I will not mince words,” Naomi said, swallowing audibly, “I have breast cancer.”
Cas kept up the onslaught, tracking Dean across the room, but he had to dodge as Dean began throwing their cleaning sponges back at him. At some point he realized Dean was laughing and that the tightness in his own face meant that he was smiling back.
“Dean, fucking, come on,” Cas whined, too worked up for coherency.
“My old man would take me and Sammy out,” Dean said carefully.
Dean watched as Cas arched up, shoving his fist in his mouth in a pathetic attempt to conceal his moans. It only took Dean one, two, three bobs before Cas was spending himself down his throat.
“I’ll go get Sammy, you get in the car.”
Cas glared at his brother in the mirror, “That’s not funny. Nothing about this is funny.”
Dean’s stomach was in knots the whole day. He probably screwed things up with Lisa. She was perfect, down to her big heart, which probably went crazy for Cas’s whole victim thing. Maybe he was playing it up, to get to Lisa himself! No, that didn’t make sense. Cas couldn’t have known. And if he just wanted to get laid, Dean knew at least one creepy girl who’d go for him. And Cas would probably never even think about sex before marriage, good boy that he is. Dean wondered if Cas had ever even touched himself. And then he quickly stopped thinking about Cas touching himself, because, gross. Freak probably didn’t even know how to.
“I’ll watch over you, to make sure nothing bad happens while you partake in the festivities,” Cas said, nodding with more determination.
Dean let out a shaky breath, rubbing his hands on his jeans to get the feeling the February chill start to settle into the car. Lisa hopped back in the car, hurriedly putting the popcorn on the dash before sitting on her hands to warm up.
“Knowing Gabe, some sort of virus that would render the console useless. Or perhaps recorded satanic ritual,” Cas sighed.
It occurred to Dean that he could ditch the angel on his shoulder in all the confusion. All Dean had to do was find Gordon, give his offering, and then he’d be free to find Lisa, chaperone be damned. It turned out the first part of his plan wasn’t hard at all, Gordon was holding court in the basement.
“He always seemed so nice,” Charlie said, “Shame he can’t see how cool you are.”
“I’m not seeking intercourse, she needs my help,” Castiel snapped.
“I don’t think smoking in a barn fool of rotted wood and dry hay during a heat wave is particularly wise,” Cas sighed, but took the joint awkwardly, screwing up his face and aggressively sucking in. Cas held the smoke in for a moment, before doubling over, coughing viciously.
“Poor bastard,” Dean shook his head after they were out of earshot, “Now what the fuck am I gonna do. Sam’s busy with Jess, and honestly, I don’t there’s anyone else I trust with this.”
“How does your mom expect us to finish this in a day? There’s like, years of stuff crammed down here,” Dean grumbled, calling over to Cas, who ignored him.
Cas walked back into the house as surreptitiously as possible, finding Dean in their room.
Lisa moved at the end of June. They didn’t pretend that they would try to make it work long distance.
Dean mutely nodded, and Cas’s mouth crashed back on to his, uncoordinated as fuck. Dean’s hands found their way to Cas’s jaw, and he pulled the other boy’s enthusiastic lips away, if only to get him to slow down, their hesitant tongues finding each other. Dean heard a moan, and realized it was him, lost in the wet slide, feeling Cas’s nascent stubble rub against his own. Cas lifted up to breathe, but Dean rolled them over, pressing little kisses into the warm skin underneath the ridge of his jaw. He didn’t know how long he’d be allowed this, how long until his brain would remember he was straight and remember that he certainly shouldn’t be dry humping his step brother in the backyard, and remember that Sammy-
“Not just, deer. You gotta know something Cas, there are other things out there besides just the Croats.”
It was a Saturday, when it happened. Naomi had a round of chemo, John was at the shop until she was finished, and Sammy was at basketball.
“Cas, I-”
Claire breathed out, and if it weren’t for the relief etched on her face, Cas would have followed through on his plan to just sneak around the back of the hot box. Just as Cas was turning to leave, Jess ran up to where they were standing.
Cas let Dean pull him in, drawing him tightly against his chest. Cas let a small part of himself hope they would talk about what they just did, but Dean just sighed, and soon his breath evened out.
“Alright why am I the only one-” Cas started.
“Please leave your soiled shoes outside. You will be hand cleaning them in the morning.”
Dean sighed. He knew he was being a dick. Cas knew it too. But part of him wanted to rile the other boy up. At least when he was yelling at Dean he wasn’t playing the perfect son act. And maybe if Cas said more mean shit to him, he would feel less bad about all the shit he said. They cleaned in silence for hours, Dean letting Cas pick out what would be good for the church sale. Apparently they did a good job, because not only did Naomi let them eat dinner that night, she also let Cas pray over the meal, which she only did like once a month. Cas beamed, and Dean realized that he never really saw Cas smile.
“Grow up man, it’s just a party,” Dean tried to bluster, as if he’d ever been to a party himself, “It’s what normal fucking people do.”
“I heard you. Lisa is moving,” Castiel said dully.
“We aren’t going to kill her. She’ll stay in camp, on a trial basis, under constant guard. She’ll be my responsibility.”
Chuck got up, and scurried away, silently shutting the wood cabin door behind him. Dean sighed, rubbing his calloused hands over his face, noting in the back of his mind that he needed a shave. His eyes darted over to the window that allowed a partially-obscured view of the cabin, the ‘hot box’, which housed the newest mystery to pop out of Croat-Ville.
“We’re just covering our bases. Be ready.” Dean raised himself to full height, but was rebuffed by a chuckle from Charlie.
The look on Cas’s face could only be described as delighted, and almost reverential. The teen launched himself at Dean, and despite his scrawny form, managed to put some serious force into the hug. Dean had no choice but to hug him back, barely making out the ‘Thank you Dean,’ that was muttered into his chest.
“You’re not gonna say goodbye to him?” Dean called out.
The next few weeks passed like winter wind. Lisa kept sitting with him at lunch, but besides a few kisses before class, their relationship was stalling out. Dean didn’t have any money and so he couldn’t take her out like she deserved, and it wasn’t like he was going to let Lisa anywhere near his house.
That didn’t lessen the pain in his chest, and it certainly didn’t stop his tears from partially blinding him, as he staggered like the drunken revelers back at Dean’s party. Cas just hoped Dean didn’t see him run away, he didn’t want to make the man worry about him on his own birthday.
“Dude, are you practicing?” Dean asked, stepping out of the shower.
