Tony took the package to Captain's quarters in the residential floor and opened the door. He entered to the room, quite smelling like a new book, clean and tidy, sketches drawn by him hanging in the walls.
Then he stood up and walked to the desk to get the small phone. He looked into it, thinking about everything he can not say right now, with tears streaking down his cheeks. Then he put that phone into his pocket, thinking "I will definitely call you, sweetheart. No war is going to stay between us getting together. Ever."
"I was afraid that this will let me down, you know 'I am Iron Man' something."
"Natasha always tells me to get a life, but I never listened. But seeing you, trusting you on a mission, fighting alongside you, that all made me realize I am always meant to be with you. To share a life with you."
The following day, Bruce, Clint and Natasha peeked into the room to see Steve Rogers and Tony Stark snuggled up, with the most peaceful smiles written all over their faces.
“Sometimes I get busy,” Tony said. “I’m rebuilding the rest of the Tower, sorry if it offended you.”
"Sir," Jarvis spoke up. "There is a potentially fatal buildup of ice occurring." Jarvis threw up the warnings, letting him know.
Tony rubbed his eyes, and set the soldering gun back in its holder. The workshop was still in black out mode, and the last time Jarvis had informed him of the time he had already spent thirty-six hours down there. Tony wasn't actually sure how long ago that was.
Of course, thinking about a family, even if that's just Peter, (because even Tony could admit that Peter was absolutely perfect), had Tony thinking about The Neighbor, and that just had to stop. Things hadn't exactly gone well with George, his attempt at dating again, went down in near flames a month after it had started. Turns out that George was not as good an actor as he thought, and Tony was able to see that Tony Stark was just another name for money, and sex. Tony was glad that he hadn't mentioned Peter to the man.
Tony hummed as he wrapped himself around Steve in bed. “She’s asleep?”
"That's the coolest thing I've ever seen," Rhodey breathed, and Tony felt a little satisfaction from it. Tony felt he strength of the suit helping him as he recovered a little, and used the repulsor to move the car from the hole still in his ceiling. "You need me to do anything else?"
"Yeah, I can do that," Steve said with a smile. "Do you want anything to drink while I'm up?"
Thanks to this new schedule, I'm actually ahead in chapters, so that means I get to shape what happens better, and Bucky is really starting to pester me, so expect to start seeing him coming up.
Tony's feet tapped as he rode up the elevator, getting antsy, wanting to see Peter. Everything was simultaneously falling apart, and then back into place. He was on an uphill trend at the moment.
"She's an absolute handful," Tony said as he hung up. "Bit of a smartass, too, I can sense it lingering under the surface."
Mary lounged on the couch, a couple of pillows behind her, and underneath her, watching Steve and Tony outside with Peter. The little boy was sitting on a full length lounger, at the end, listening to Steve with an intensity she had only seen applied to talks about science with Tony. Tony was laying on his own lounger next to Steve, sunglasses on, arm behind his head, and ankles crossed. Steve was sitting in the middle of his, hands and arms moving as he told his story. Phil sat down next to her and kissed her cheek.
"I'm sorry, I think I misheard you." He made a little show out of rubbing his ears. "I thought you said that you wanted me to become Wade's Guardian, instead of Mary. Mary Parker, married to Phil Coulson, the better parental figure."
"Nothing bad then?" Steve leaned in to plant a kiss on the back of Tony's neck.
My mom is a single mother, and I'm her only child, so I was suddenly put in the position of making the decisions that would save her life. The doctors were telling me that there was still a good chance that she wouldn't make it, she was a surgical emergency and a medical emergency. She made it through the night, and made it through the surgery, and she had to have a leg amputated above the knee. So in between making sure she's doing well in rehab, I have to clean the house out, get a storage unit, sell the house, and find a place for me to live. (Mom luckily has case workers that will help her get that ball rolling for when she gets out.)
"Well, surprisingly it is." Tony held up his mug, clinking it together with Steve's orange juice. "I got more than four hours of sleep last night."
Tony licked his lips, realizing that his lips were dry, and he needed a little effort to make his mouth not so dry, before he could answer her. “Yeah.” Although his voice was still just a little raspy. “Yeah, I’m okay, baby.” He lifted his arm, with a little more effort than he thought he’d need, and messed with her hair a little. “I’d say that you probably needed a haircut, if I didn’t think that your Papa would break every pair of scissors in the state at the suggestion.” He tugged very gently on some hair and she giggled. “Joke’s on him though; he’s going to have to learn how to do your hair.”
Perhaps the past few months, all the avoiding that Steve had done to Tony, was trying to tell him something. Maybe it was like when little kids had a crush, and they would pull hair, and kick toys, instead of being nice. Maybe Tony was his schoolyard crush, and his mind, and body, was trying to tell him now that maybe it was something else.
“A big family breakfast?” Steve asked as he got up from his seat. Tony took a couple extra seconds before getting up as well, holding onto his mug.
Steve had been in the process of getting up to sit back on the couch and frowned at Wade's words. He turned and saw Bucky and Meg standing by the arm of the couch. Steve jumped again, putting a hand to his chest. "Stop scaring me!"
“I’d hope not, because I just gave you an old fashioned date.” Steve smiled at him, letting his tongue peek out around the spoon.
"Me," Tony growled before lowering his shoulder and charging into Loki, slamming his weight into Loki's middle. It was enough to catch the man by surprise, making his drop his grip on Peter. "Run!" Tony said to his son before Loki grabbed his arm and flung him across the room. Tony grunted as he slammed into the couch, hearing the wood crack, and rolling over it.
“Can you pick me out some clothes?” He asked as he started the shower. “I’m too lazy to come back out!” He heard an exaggerated huff and smiled when Steve threw some clothes at him. “You and Peter can even order dinner together, you know what I’ll eat.”
“Our outfits for the day,” Tony said happily, going for his own. White shirt, teal vest, tan pants, and brown boots, along with a few belts. He was going to be the best looking Flynn Rider out there. Maybe better looking than the paid actor at the Park.
“Get out of my way!” Bucky barked, trying to swat the Enhanced away to get to the bed. Steve looked at the bed to see both Loki and Tony arch their backs, gasping, and then shouting in pain.
“Uhhhnnn,” Tony moaned, mouth open wide. He then sighed and nodded. “I know, and I should, and I know that he’ll pull it out of me. And he knows that’s okay, once I get used to it.”
"I'm hoping just a month," she said. Coulson hummed a little, but nodded. "Could be longer if they're intent on hiding this location."
"You have a son," she nearly whispered.
"We'll talk about making a morning walk later," Meg had grumbled when she opened the door to a ridiculously happy looking super couple. Tony had happily walked in with Steve behind him as she went into the bathroom to finish getting ready.
“No, that’s called conditioning.” She picked up her tablet from the coffee table. “Training even, like you do with a new pet.”
“Hey Tony I know you haven’t been following your diet” Steve says as he walks into Tony’s private floor.
It’s also designed to make Tony hungry more often excited Steve. He hasn’t changed yet but that would begin eventually. Soon his stomach would start rumbling for food and Tony would stuff himself till he was full.
“That's okay baby, from now on we’ll help you eat even if you feel like you can’t eat anymore.” Steve says, smiling at Tony.
“This is a punishment Tony” he whispers in his ear before grabbing the empty plates and starting to leave.
Warning this chapter contains food avoidance that could be potentially trigger someone. This fan fiction is in no way meant to encourage eating disorders.
Steve puts a hand on Bruce’s shoulder “You know he’s right Bruce. This is for Tony.”
“No your not, your going to eat what’s on your meal plan. Though since I don’t know exactly how much you ate your going to have to eat the entire plate. After I of course punish you for making a mess and not eating your food.” Steve says grinning before he grabs Tony and puts him over his lap.
“Okay Tony your new rules, one you have to stick to the diet plan. You can eat what’s not restricted as much as you want but you can’t eat less then it says you have to or something restricted. And you can’t eat less one day because you ate a lot the day before okay?” Steve says making sure Tony is paying attention.
“Jarvis can you please play the security footage of Tony eating for the past two weeks.” Steve asks, staring at his tablet.
After going over all the footage, Steve told Jarvis to compile the clips showing Tony disposing of his food before asking the team to meet on his floor. Once they had all come up Steve asks Jarvis to play the video.
But his plate was cleared albeit incredibly slowly, and though Bruce said it made sense as Tony wasn’t used to the portion sizes, Steve was beginning to get suspicious. Because even though Tony was apparently following the diet plan he hadn’t gained any weight so far. Bruce had told Steve to wait because sometimes it takes awhile for the body to gain, Steve was getting the feeling something wasn't right.
“ I know, it’s why I bought you in. Made you do the test, you show all the signs of an underweight omega. Your pheromones upset people even before you walk into a room and you have an unpleasant attitude and erratic emotions.” Fury says softly.
“I agree with Natasha, currently Tony’s emotions are erratic and the calmer we keep him the better. ” Bruce says cleaning his glasses.
“Okay Baby, you think you can eat a little bit more maybe a dessert?” Steve asks Watching Tony nod his head frantically before going to the kitchen and getting Tony a huge slice of chocolate brownie. After giving him the plate he knelt back down.
“But you can’t do that the others wouldn’t let you. You can’t, right?” Tony said starting to look doubtful.
“So how should we go about punishing him? he’s been breaking the rules we set. He knows he is supposed to stick to his diet plan” Steve asks one the video finished.
Instead he started bringing a glass of “milk” to drink with his food. But Steve noticed that Tony didn’t fill his cup all the way he only put a little bit in, the avengers hadn’t noticed because the glass was opaque.
“Ah ah ah no touching this is a punishment” Steve says getting up and getting more food from the fridge and placing it in front of Tony. “Eat.” Steve says watching Tony pick up a fork and start eating without protest. Shifting on his sore ass trying to get comfortable.
“Actually Stark you’re wrong you’re an omega” he says handing Tony the test results.
“Oops, sorry”. Tony says unrepentant. Steve looks at the plate, and the mess on the floor, grateful it was not broken and sighs. Tony smirking triumphantly says “I’m going to go to my lab” and starts getting up to leave.
Running hands over his new flesh with a frown. Bruce was also going to up the size of the meals by quite a bit to help stretch Tony’s stomach. So Tony will have to eat till he’s stuffed unlike with the current meals which are while larger than normal ones don’t put a huge amount of strain on Tony to eat.
“Actually I’ve spoken to the other avengers and they agree. If you have been classified wrong, then you could be detrimental to the team.” Fury says heading towards the door. “I’ll give you some time to decide” he says before closing the door. The team who had been watching through the surveillance system turned to fury.
Again Tony nods still not speaking. “Good now the last one is that you're not allowed in your lab without supervision. And that’s one of us, not Jarvis.”
A lil bit of feeding.
The lab visits had a schedule now as a punishment for lying to them about his diet. Each of them going down twice a week for 2 hours. More if they felt Tony deserved to stay down there longer and they had free time. Natasha was the only one so far to go down for extra time. Feeling guilty she didn’t notice Tony was an omega and that he wasn’t following his diet.
Tony had been very docile and quiet about eating so far. The team had been informed by the doctors that Tony would most likely resist the changes in his diet and that they would have to coerce Tony to eat the food.
Tony had been sticking to Bruce’s meal plan for 2 weeks now, Steve and the team being thorough in checking to see if he had actually consumed the food, and his body had already started to change.
A few days into the diet, after the first weight in, Tony changed his method of hiding his food. Probably worrying that someone would notice what he was doing and notice he wasn’t eating as much as he should be and therefore not gaining any weight.
“Certainly Captain rogers.” As Steve watches the footage of the first few days on the diet, he notices that after awhile of watching Tony eat they stop paying close attention to what Tony's doing.
“Fine” Tony agrees quietly, eyes staring at his fidgeting hands. All anger suddenly gone. “I’m sorry, I won’t lie again” Tony mumbles still not looking up.
“Okay I will speak to Tony about him breaking the rules. But what am I supposed to do? How do I bring it up without upsetting him?.” Steve asks.
“You promise?” He asks getting closer to Tony.
“Fine" Tony says quietly. Eventually Tony falls asleep on Steve. Looking down at Tony all he can think is that he can’t wait until he starts gaining weight. He’s going to look so cute.
For a while he just sits there there dozing off with Steve rubbing his full belly, eventually though Steve lifts Tony up before walking him over to the couch so Tony could sit more comfortably while Steve massaged his cute little tummy.
Steve admiring the way his ass jiggled slightly with each slap. His soft tummy pressing against his lap Tony’s hardening length against his thigh and his soft moans  interrupted by smacks.
Eventually Tony agrees to take the test. “So, Fury what’s the results huh? I’m a beta aren’t I” Tony says smugly. “I’m going to go now” holding out his hand Fury stops Tony.
Ok so it's been a bit. I am doing my best to get this story going again. I'm never going to be like good at updating the story. But I also don't wanna just abandon this fic. So I decided to just post what I have managed to write so far. I have been trying to write this on and off for like the last year. Imma do my best to finish this at some point but like it's unlikely that point will be soon.
“Yes just please I need-”
Tony nods into Steve’s shoulder. “Okay sweetheart so the second rule is that if you don’t feel you can finish your food by yourself then come to one of us and we will make you eat it. If you don’t eat it, we will know, and we will have to force you to okay?” Steve says running his hand through Tony’s hair.
“Fuck off Steve, I’m not giving up Iron man “ Tony spits face twisted in anger.
His dick was as hard and heavy as his belly. “Amazing Tony. You are such a good boy” Steve says moving in front of Tony and licking his way into Tony’s mouth. Eventually pulling back to kiss his way down lingering again, on the neck leaving a few bite marks before sinking to his knees between Tony’s open legs.
“No you haven’t Tony, I've gone through the security footage.” Steve says turning the TV off “We agreed that you would follow the rules. Since you have broken the first two rules me and the team decided that we should make up some punishments for you.” Steve says.
“The team and I think it’s for the best. We don’t know how you’ll react in the field. You have no control over your emotions, getting angry for no apparent reason and you broke our trust by lying to us. We only want what’s best for you Tony, and we tried to be nice and let you do it on your own bit instead you tricked us, hiding your food in your hand or spitting it out. We were so happy that you were finally being healthy.” Steve says softly trying to make Tony feel bad about lying like Natasha had advised.
Steve knew the day Bruce made Tony’s meals bigger was going to be the day Tony had to be reminded of the rules. While Steve didn’t want to hurt Tony or make him upset he was also excited to discipline Tony.
“Steve no I’m full.” Tony whines.
“So what are you gonna do spank me?” Tony asks sarcastically while rolling his eyes.
At this Tony raises his head looking angry “You can’t do that. It's not fair and you can’t make me.” Tony argued trying to push Steve away.
And maybe beyond full if Steve can convince him to. Maybe get him to start enjoying the tight feeling of being stuffed. Steve had started hovering around Tony asking him if he’s hungry would he like some food and leaving snacks around his lab.
Hope yall enjoyed this. Took me a bit too write cuz I have so many things I wanna write and my brains like hey go write 500 words for some new fic instead of doing any of the five you have been trying to write. As always lemme know if there's any mistakes and hope yall enjoyed this.
“Don’t worry Tony that’s why me and the team are here. That’s why we have made these rules for you. So, you have some guidelines to help you adjust. There’s only 3 of them so far but we will add more if we feel like you need it. I’m going to continue telling you the rules okay hun?” Steve says softly.
Clint complained about being bored and Bruce always tried to Convince Tony to go to his lab instead. But Steve just sat there drawing Tony. Marking the small difference in his form. Planning on making a timeline of his weight gain.
“No Tony you need to be punished. You made a mess and refused to eat what you were told to” Steve says bringing his hand down on Tony’s ass hard. Tony squirming on Steve’s lap.
Steve says holding tony against him, so he can’t run away. “Just let us help you” Steve says softly. And Tony stops struggling and leans against Steve once more.
At first Tony tried to get Jarvis to let him go down, but Steve had convinced Jarvis that this was for Tony’s health so Jarvis refused. At first Tony would get upset and try to get them to let him go down. But he stopped when they said they wouldn’t let him go at all if he kept complaining. Though Steve didn’t mind hanging out in Tony’s workshop, he just wanted Tony to behave.
Hey! sorry for the long wait. I have just started going to a new university course and so I have been sorta busy adjusting to that. I will try to write the next chapter soon.
“Don’t you think you were a bit harsh? He’s just upset because you locked him up” Bruce says softly, looking down at the floor.
“Tony I know it’s hard but your omega and always have been. Did your dad ever show you your test?” Fury asked knowingly.
“Sweetheart I need you to try your best and whatever you can’t eat I’ll help you to eat” Steve says kindly .
Hoping he would find them and eat them. So far Tony hasn’t really noticed their appearance, only picking at them once or twice .
“ Your gonna have to feed yourself, but if you finish it I will spend another two hours in the lab with you this week” Steve says running his lips over Tony’s thigh before taking Tony in again. Sucking at the sensitive head of his dick before going back to deep throating Tony dick.
“But it’s just so hard Steve i’m not used to it and I start getting a tummy ache.” Tony whined pouting at Steve from under his lashes.
“Yeah I have, you guys have been with me at all meal times.” Tony says not turning away from the TV.
“I also believe that the captain should speak to him, as he is closest to him.” Thor says loudly.
He pulls his penis out, sucks on the tip savoring the salty taste on his tongue before licking it up and down the shaft. Hearing Tony’s moans from above encouraging him he curls his fingers around the base of Tony's cock and sucks slowly pushing his head down further until he has swallowed the whole thing.
“Your wrong I’m a beta, I've always been a beta. Dad said I was a beta.” Tony says voice monotone.
“ If that’s one you want to suggest I don’t mind it. But the first punishment is that we are going to restrict your lab time. I haven’t worked out how much but I’m thinking maybe we stay down there two hours each. Maybe more if we decide you’ve been good and one of us don’t mind staying down there.” Steve says, holding up his hand when Tony opens his mouth to voice his opinion. “The next punishment is no iron man suit.” Steve finishes making a gesture that Tony could speak now.
“Tony this is to help you, and you know it is. Please let us.” Steve sighs leading him over to the couch and setting him on his lap.
“Yeah yeah now that I’m omega I’ve got to be submissive. Let you fatten me up and boss me around got it.” Tony says heatedly, crossing his arms to cover himself.
“I think you should have a conversation and explain to him that you know he’s not following the plan and that he will have to be punished. Together you can discuss possible punishments.” Natasha says calmly.
Sorry for the long wait. I have been really busy with exams and assignments for my course. Here it is a new chapter I am going to be honest and say it will probably be awhile until I can write another chapter but I will do my best.
“Because it’s Tony he won’t take that well and he’ll just push back harder. He might get defensive if the entire team confronts him so I think Steve should go by himself, that way Tony doesn’t feel like he’s being ganged up on and just shut down.” Natasha explains looking at Bruce and Thor silently asking for their opinions on what they should do.
“No wait please” Tony calls desperately. “I’ll eat however much you want whatever the meal plan says just keep going please” Steve smirks turning around and heading back to Tony.
"How old are you going to be?" Steve asked and Tony blinked a little.
It hadn't escaped Tony that he had been having nightmares of the attack. Were they nightmares? When you dreamed about something before it happened? The car pulling up, the door opening, then suddenly pain. When Peter had come back from his vacation, Tony felt that little piece of anxiety, that fear that something was going to happen, but wrote it off when nothing happened. He had been nervous to tell his son about Jamie, right? So why didn't it occur to him when Meg was coming back that something could happen? And what exactly did it mean? Would it happen again? Tony was not ready to handle everything this entitled mentally. Should he blame himself for not changing things up? Taking more precautions? But, then wouldn't that mean that he have to acknowledge that it was a premonition, or something? He'd have to know beforehand.
Go check on my new story 'The Iron King' and tell me what you think!
It was nearly half an hour later when Steve finishes talking with the doctor and going to the receptionist to book another appointment before he was back. He didn't know what Peter and Tony talked about, but it made him smile when he saw Tony carrying Peter, while talking to the smiling boy, the sparkle in Peter's eyes was worth it as he waved a watch and looked at it from every angle he can, which made Steve raise his brow at that, but Peter seemed to be amused and happy so he didn't scold the pup.
Sext — at midday
Grumbling to himself, Anton continued his walk to the lake, his mind wandering in a different direction, trying to think of many different solutions to the problems that the Stone clan are going to cause no doubt if they were left as they are. The best course of action at the moment, is leaving the Stone family alone while trying to avoid the two serpents, but saying this is easier than doing it, considering those two try to follow him everywhere he went; the only place they didn't try to follow Anton to was the outhouse, and even then Tyber is usually near when Anton finish his business.
"Nothing. Nothing important."
Clint wanted to wake them up for breakfast, but Natasha shushed him and closed the door, mouthing "Let them be."
"- From the Capsicle to the Big man in the suit of armor."
"Tony, I know I am making a mistake by not agreeing with you, but what could I do? He is more than a friend to me, I promised to stay with him 'till the end of the line. Bucky was the only one cared about me in my darkest days, so I made my final decision to care about him at his darkest days, even though that makes me sacrifice my position, my reputation, you and the avengers."
"That traitor," Tony thought, "he didn't say anything about that in all these years, using my own resources, staying at my place, I thought he was the safest, most honest person I ever know, and yet he turned out to be a two faced bitch!" He couldn't resist the anger bubbling inside of him.
With that anger, he slammed the door shut in residential floor of the complex, waking Vision from his deep thoughts. Seeing Tony's troubled face, Vision thought not to ask about Wanda.
"Hello Rhodey!" Tony gave an almost cheerful greeting but Rhodey identified the sadness hidden in that greet.
"Uh, how can I put this? When you stand by my side, there is this feeling, like I can avenge the whole world, you know."
"I know you're doing what you believe in, and that's all any of us can do. That's all any of us should... So no matter what, I promise you, if you need us - if you need me - I'll be there."
"Welcome to my safe house." answered Clint, opening the door and going in. "Fury set this one up, years ago. Kept this off SHIELD's files." And called, "Honey, where are you? I am home!". A pregnant woman came in front of them, smiling shyly and Clint introduced her to Steve, Tony, Thor, Bruce as "Gentlemen, this is Laura." Tony waved at her and she responded as "Hello guys, nice to finally meet you, I know all your names." Clint laughed and hugged her. She is a nice woman, Steve thought while Tony and Thor instantly remembered Pepper and Jane.
Tony couldn't hide his cry now, so he fell onto Steve's bed nearby and cried to his heart content. He thought that he only has feelings for Captain, but to find out that Captain felt the same about him; Tony never felt this feeling of defeat.
"I showed the ring to Natasha, and she said that it was beautiful. You should see it for yourself. Tony, I am the man out of time. Maybe in another lifetime, we can be soulmates, but not now. I will always love you, till my last breath was out."
It said, "Tony, I'm glad you're back at the compound. I don't like the idea of you rattling around a mansion by yourself. We all need family. The Avengers are yours, maybe more so than mine."
"Hey Tony, look I am learning to walk! Like a toddler." Rhodey laughed saying that and so did Tony.
After doing a number of household chores and getting a dinner done by Laura and Natasha, all of the group was feeling sleepy. Thor left early telling that he needs to elaborate the vision that Maximoff girl showed him. Steve tried to talk him out of it, but it was no use. On top of that Nick Fury came in to advice them. Laura and children were fast asleep and the remaining five of them were very exhausted.
"I got this ring in case this settles down, to propose you. But it seems that is never going to happen and we are exactly heading for a war. I am helpless, Tony. I don't want to lose you, as well as Bucky. But you know, I am Captain America, and I should make a choice. So this is the choice I am making. Bucky needs my help, Tony. He was my trustworthy friend back then, like you are now."
"Where did this happened, may I ask?"
Steve was awaken by a muffled scream and a vigorous shake of bed. He woke up and switched on the bedside lamp to see what is happening. Sheets covering Tony were gone, and his fingers were clinging into the pillow, and his face was converted into a horrified state. He was constantly muttering, "Please don't leave me, please Cap, I need you. Please stay with me." Steve was terrified. He tried to wake up Tony, but it was no use. He was crying now, tears streaking down on his cheeks as he begged for the Captain to stay with him, not to leave him alone. One final agonizing scream saying "No!" and Tony woke up crying, sweating, heavily breathing into Steve's arms which are strongly wrapped around him.
This letter said,
"Yes, Tony?"
Still holding Tony onto him tightly, Steve wiped his tears with back of the hand, asking, "Nightmares, Tony?"
When he came back from the bathroom, Tony was already sleeping. Steve stared at his peaceful face, reminding himself that he is still a human behind all his iron armor. He got into the bed, spreading the sheet from down to up, and sleep hit him as soon as his head touched the pillow.
"No Mr. Stark, I'm fine. I just don't feel like doing something."
With eyes full of tears and shaking hands, Tony picked up the little box and opened it. There was an actual silver ring with an infinity symbol embedded onto it, its wings blue and red colour, a white colour letter A at the center where the wings met.
Tony was amazed to see such creativity from a soldier like him. But this is not the exact time to admire those. Carefully he opened the package to see a letter addressed to him by the Captain.
"Tony you will never be a let down. I mean you are always saving us, remember you flew a nuke to a Chitauri mothership? I can't do stuff like that even though I am a super soldier, but you can. Because you have this bravery inside you."
As usual tell me if I have made any mistakes. Hope you enjoy :)
“Well you should try your hardest to approach the conversation calmly.
Natasha and Steve have a bake off. Tony is of course the judge and has to try all of their baking.
Staring at Steve dubiously Tony starts to eat. After eating his usual meal size Tony stops. “I’m full” he says pushing the plate away. “Tony you have to eat all of it and you know it. And I know your not that full” Steve sighs  pushing the plate back in front of Tony.
After another 10 smacks Steve places Tony on his own chair. Tony immediately reaching for his erection only for Steve to slap his hand away.
Eventually when they would get up to do other things and tony would move the food into his pocket, get up and proceed to the kitchen where the bin was kept and empty the food into the bin. Then he would go back to his plate and make a big deal of him eating the last few bites.
“Sometimes an underweight omegas body will hold off on heat until they get up to a healthy weight” he says putting a hand on Tony’s shoulder.
“Yes I can Tony. These rules aren’t permanent but for now you need them. Your erratic and it’s dangerous for you to be in the lab alone. And you have too much control over Jarvis for us to believe he can always stop you. We just want to keep you safe this is the only way we could think of.”
Not by much but there was a slight curve to his belly now where there used to be none. His face had also rounded out and his ass was filling his jeans a bit more than before.
“We gave Tony the chance to come in and just do the test, but he refused. If I’m right and he’s an omega he needs help. You know how unhealthy it is for omega to be underweight.” Fury says.
“Are you enjoying this baby? What a naughty boy this is supposed to be a punishment” Steve growls in Tony’s ear giving it a quick nip, hard enough to make Tony yelp before going back to the punishment.
Bruce and Tony’s doctors had finished making a meal plan that would help tony to gain weight. He had been on it for two weeks and Steve was starting to get suspicious.
(See the end of the chapter for
“ I know but I’m just scared, I’m not sure what I’m supposed to be doing.” Tony says quietly wrapping his arms around Steve now instead of himself.
“Why should Steve explain it to him he knows the rules, I think you should not let him in the workshop at all that will make him think twice about disobeying” Clint says shrugging.
"My, my, look who finally decided to show up! And with a cutie pie too!" The Omega cooed as she said that, which made the pup shiver and hide behind Tony's legs which made the Omega mouth 'Sorry' for his friend, causing her to give him a small smile of concern. "So what do I own this pleasurable visit?" Darcy said as she saw a huge Alpha lowering himself down and pull the shivering pup in his embrace whispering in his ear, making the pup hide his face in the Alpha's neck.
/Warning/: This chapter contains, cursing, maybe a little fluff, angst (Maybe?), violence, panic attack, and poor Stevie! And who knows what! All reviews are appreciated.
(See the end of the chapter for
And on the ninth of October (My birthday) I will post my story!
"Mommy, you're back!" The pup squealed and Bucky had to hold his gasp taking in the boy that refused to let go of the Omega, the boy was a little on the pale side and was a small one too, but he sure as hell has Stevie's nose and face shape, the only thing different was his eye color, and the cap hides his face that he couldn't see his hair.
It was five minutes before Steve was back and he gave Tony something that looks like a gelatin mask, which made the Omega blink at that and looks at the Alpha. "What is this?" Tony finally said while still looking at the mask holding it with two fingers and shiver at the cold and smooth texture he was feeling.
"I have to say Peter spends yesterday talking about Mr. Jarvis, it's a neat work Mr. Stark." The Alpha said as he looked down at the pup who flushed a little and hide his face in his father's neck, grumbling something, which caused Tony to laugh and followed Steve and Peter to their car, a family car that Tony smiled at. "The little one refused to stay in the car, going on about how he needed to say good morning to Mr. Jarvis before leaving." That got a squeak from the pup and a whine, which got a small laugh from Tony as he felt his heart fluttering happily at that.
Tony Stark was nothing if not prepared, that's why when a fucking meteor out of nowhere fill on him from the sky after Wanda did something spooky with her hands and disappearing in a swirl of red clouds, he was sure as hell going to scream bloody murder to his heart content. Because not a minute after they won and Hydra ran away, something (A Meteor if you can believe, that came out of nowhere, and not even his Ai was able to detect it!) slammed into Tony and just when he thought that he was going to be slammed face-first into the ground, he was dragged with the meteor by a force-field, making Tony scream like a five years old girl who found a spider in her hair.
"It was an accident, besides, who would want to peep on you," Anton stated hotly, hoping that the cold will manage to cool him down, hoping the Omega would contribute his flushed look to the cold instead of being caught red-handed peeping on Omegas like a boy who got his first knot not a few days ago.
The king rumbled, causing Steven to pull James closer against him almost automatically, but the protective gesture didn't keep the Viking from proceeding.
The silence was suffocating for the next few minutes as both Tony and Rhodey seemed like they were trying to find the next few words that will be appropriate for this crazy situation. "Well… at least he is hot…" Rhodey said, scratching the back of his head with a sheepish look on his face, Tony though, he could only whimper and hide his head under the fuzzy blanket…
The two of them went to the kitchen, Tony shakily following the floating ghost who was humming and singing under her breath, giving creepy giggles here and there as she went after the small dolls that infested Tony's mansion, like cockroaches. Tony kept his mouth shut the entire time, trying not to put his foot in his mouth more than he already did; Tony had this… feeling… feeling that Serpentine is far more dangerous than anyone Tony had the misfortune to meet, even more, dangerous than Steve, and Steve was another bag of terror by itself.
"Stark, my name is Tony Stark, and I am here to look for my son," Tony said as he gave the files he collected on his son in the past year.
So after digging deep and being thankful that Fury nor Phil weren't a Hydra agents (The former for Steven's peace of mind considering that he doesn't want to go against his friend, and the latter because of Clint's whining) Peggy and Steven made sure to inform the two of them about their plan of taking Hydra down, so now Steven and Peggy had four spies gathering information on Hydra, and one of them is Pierce's own friend.
By ten p.m. everyone waved both Steve and Tony goodbye and head to their homes promising that they will come tomorrow morning something about a trip to the park to celebrate their engagement some more; that left Steve and Tony alone, poor Peter, he spent all day playing with the rest of the children that he fell asleep not an hour ago followed by the rest of the kids.
"I'm sorry…?" Tony murmured, getting a huff from Steve who then turned out and ignored him when the movie started. The marathon started with Snow White, throughout the movie everyone kept glancing at Steve, watching how wide his eyes were, how slacked his jaw was, even once or twice, Tony caught Steve humming the songs with Peter.
Anton traced the branches and roots of the Yggdrasil tree, inspecting the pendant for any fault in it; from the silver, he used to the blue gemstone, to the shape of the branches and the roots. But as always, there was nothing wrong with the pendant, it was perfect, as perfect as it can be when the one who made it was an eleven springs old Alpha with the hope of attracting the attention of the Omega he fancies; it had to be perfect back then, for it was a promise he gave to the love of his life, a promise that should the Omega finally return home, the two of them shall be wed on the same day; a promise that the love of his life accepted with a shy smile and sealed with an innocent kiss on the cheek.
Everyone glanced at one another with calculating looks before nodding their head. Not a few moments afterward the screen in front of them start showing the feeds. Everyone's eyes widen when they saw Steven shackled to the wall with nothing but his slacks, a few moments later he woke up and searched around the place, minutes passed before Zola and a naked man came in the room, everyone's eyes widen at Zola's explanation. As for Rogers he let out a strangled noise when he saw the mask fall and the man behind it was nothing but James Barnes, it made Peggy wonder for a second what will Rogers do that he realizes that Bucky was now alive, alive for seventy years, helping Hydra. They all understood what transpired when Zola left the room, struggling to ignore Rogers' angry snarl when Bucky get on top of Steven, a few seconds though Bucky tense and became lifeless on top of Steven, they saw how the shackles were crushed with a flick of Steven's wrists, how he rose up carrying Bucky toward the bunk in the distant corner of the room. What frozen everyone though, was when Steven opened his eyes later, they were crimson red, and for a second Peggy thought that he was a feral werewolf. The ruthless grin on his face that followed was even worse.
So what do you think?
Steve, on the other hand, didn't pay it too much attention, beaming happily like a puppy who was told he was good; which was a mental image that Tony never wanted Steve to be associated with, especially when the man is a scary motherfucker who won't hesitate to kill. "I'm happy that you liked them; I spent days thinking about what you will love; Ms. Potts was so helpful when she told me that flower and chocolate is the way to go!" Steve said happily, which made Tony pale at the realization that Steve dared to ask Pepper about dating 101; oh shit! Pepper was probably waiting for Steve to come and pick her up, only to realize that he was never coming and that he will take Tony on the date that she was no doubt excited about.
All the while Steve was trying hard to regain a footing in the jumping mess that was his mind, his fiancé was a Stark… why didn't he tell him? A lot of questions swirled in Steve's mind, but he knew one thing, Anthony was going to have a hell of explanation to give when he gets back, Steve will kick his ass. "Mr. Stark…" Steve said in a surprisingly strong voice, stronger than he felt at the moment. "I don't know what you were thinking of coming into my home and demand me to leave, but I love your son, and I am sure that by the end of the month, he will be back and he will explain what took place in here." Steve said as he throws the ID card back to Mr. Car-Stark, it made the Alpha pause and his amusement look to disappear.
"I see…" The Ancient One said looking at Steven for a while tilting her head a little, and everyone was impressed at how pale she became when some emotion seemed to paint her eyes, her eyes scanned the room fast, but not too fast that Peggy didn't notice how her eyes darken when they fell on Steve, who was standing with Natasha looking at his counterpart with disbelieved look. "Son of Sarah…" The woman said after she turned to Steven once again her eyes never leaving the man that turned to her. "It seems that you were the fates way of righting what's wrong… please use this chance wisely, for now, you are our only defense against that dark future…" The Ancient One said walking to Steven and out he had on his shoulder and give it a small squeeze before turning around and walking through the portal that appeared out of nowhere…She left everyone stunned when the realization crossed their mind and everyone turned to Steven who was looking at the portal the woman crossed…
It's finally here; the X-Day, his funeral, the day he will leave the world, the day he will finally meet God and try to ask for forgiveness for all of his wrongdoings, the day has come… the day he has his date with Steve… now Tony, like many other people who were forced into a situation they don't like, tried to forget about this day desperately; how? Like any sane person, he tried to push it so far off his mind, that it will go to the darkest, deepest, unused unit of his mind; a unit that Tony made specifically for trying to forget things he doesn't like and want to forget for the rest of all eternity… as much as Tony hate to admit it, it seems that Steve did grow on him, that's why he managed to land in the 4829th place, right beside seafood; a good start considering that Steve managed to land the first place ten months in a row ever since he came to live in the mansion.
When Tony arrived downstairs to the dining room he was greeted with a round of 'Good morning' from everyone, making the Omega smile at them and sit in his chair beside Steve with his baby on his lap, which his baby took a chance to pester the Alpha about wanting to go to the zoo again today, which made the Alpha chuckle at that and promise the pup that they will go soon, Tony hummed and smiled happily when everyone was sending him happy and excited looks, which made the Omega excited, and then a plate was put in front of him which made the Omega contain his choked gasp, eyes become teary when they fell on the blueberry pancakes.
"I… I brought you something…" Howard said after passing Morgan to Sarah who tried to show Harley and Peter how to hold the baby. "I… I don't even know how to say it because it was so bizarre that I couldn't believe it myself…" Howard said, taking an envelope from his suit jacket and giving it to Tony, who held the envelope and turned it around a few times. "It's about Harley…" Howard continued in a whisper, so the boy in question wouldn't hear them.
"Is this notebook filled with all of their names?" Steve asked in a calm voice, causing Bruce to gulp and nod his head, offering the notebook toward Steve, who took it and start looking through the pages, taking the names of the people and what they did to hurt Tony, and their whereabouts. Bruce had made sure to include as much detail as he can, after all this was his ticket to safety. "I have to say, Dr. Banner, you are a smart man, the smartest out of these idiotic Avengers exclude Bucky and Tony of course. You gained your safety Bruce; you can sleep without fear tonight." Steve said with a murderous grin, walking back to the wall and disappearing with the shadows, leaving Bruce a shivering wreck…
"Steve… honey… there is someone here to see you…" Natasha's calm and soft voice caused Steve to blink his eyes tiredly and turns to look at the woman, his mind was still miles and miles away, that's why Steve needed a few minutes to understand what his friends said to him. Natasha's words made Steve furrow his brows, wondering who came all the way to see him when Steve made sure to reject any call he got.
(See the end of the chapter for
Just as Anton expect, the queen made his move when Thor, Loki, and Jamti were out of sight; he didn't move to kill Anton, didn't move to scream at him, it was worse. As fast as the queen can he whirl around to Anton and slapped him hard, hard enough for Anton to taste the blood on his tongue. Turning to the queen, the anger Anton felt was like no other, how can the queen be stupid enough to attack him when Anton wanted to do nothing but protect him? Was the queen really this foolish?
Tony sigh tiredly when his girl whine and start moving her arms in an angry fashion; his girl wasn't hungry, she doesn't need a change, she wasn't tired and need sleep, Tony met all of her needs an hour ago when she woke up from her bed with a mighty cry. If his baby doesn't need any of the above, that what does she want? It wasn't like Tony wasn't trying to understand her; he was a minute away from calling Jane or Bruce, wondering if his baby was sick.
"Well, that didn't stop you from abandoning us for the past two weeks, did it?" Steve spit out, whirling around until he was facing Tony, ignoring the wide eyes and shocked look the Alpha was giving him not that Steve cared about what Tony was thinking. "You can't seem to get it inside of your goddammit head, so allow me to enlighten you, Mr. Stark." Steve let go of his baby's hand, already missing the reassuring weight of his baby's small hand, but he had to make Tony understand, that he can't do what he did in the past few weeks without there being some dire consequences. "We; that means you and me, don't have that much time left with Peter, because news flash, he is sick! Do you even understand what that means? Don't you understand that any day now, the sickness will be able to defeat Peter, and my son will die; I told you from the start Tony if you can't handle this life then leave!" Steve was tried so hard to stop himself from shouting out loud, mainly because he didn't want to disturb his baby.
The journey to the hospital was rough, Steve didn't know what to do half of the time, he was worried, he was afraid, and he wouldn't stop thinking about the child and its mother… Steve was shaken. He called Natasha who was still in Stane's mansion, he told her to question everyone there is, leaving no stone unturned, he even told her to question the neighbors and ask if something strange happened in the past few days. Natasha was all ears and she even told him that Fury took Stane to Shield's HQ to question him, Steve paused at that, he told Natasha to tell Fury that Stane is to be locked in the cells under Shield's basement, that Steve will be the one who questioned him when he had time, that made the line become silent, and then Natasha bedding him goodbye as she went to call Fury.
"Hey, sweetie why don't you go and play?" Pepper said after she and Tony sat on the bench that looked over the playground, which made Megan squeal and run toward the swings. Tony and Pepper ends up spending the afternoon of their day off talking about the company, about everything that crossed their mind. "When are you going to seek happiness, Tony?" Pepper asked gently making Tony pause at that.
"What can you tell me about him, that wouldn't endanger you and end up killing you?" Steven said which made Loki look at him with a start of a smile playing on his lips.
4-As you read, Norse's laws about prostitution and rape are as accurate; those who were convicted of these crimes were labeled as outlawed (fredløs), kicked out of the village, and are forbidden of getting any help, they could be killed without their killer being punished because it wasn't a crime to kill outlawed. The first person who passed the law that forbade prostitution and rape, is Harald Fairhair followed by The Oseberg Queen.
"Why are you here?" Steve asked, his voice nearly vanishing when he asked that question, he wanted so much to scream at the Alpha in front of him; he wanted to scream, and hit him, and throw things at him, just so he will realize how much Steve was hurting inside.
, it seemed like these lovely ladies don't even know what the word 'No' means," Steve stated in a bored voice, causing the women to flush in embarrassment and anger at how blunt Steve was; Tony couldn't help but laugh at that hiding his face in Steve's shoulder. Of course, Steve wouldn't care about social etiquette; of course, he wouldn't mind embarrassing everyone in this party as much as he doesn't mind turning them into flea-eating frogs… Tony doesn't know why but talking to Steve after being forced to be in Ty's presentation was refreshing.
It was two years since Howard's death, two years since Tony and his daughter were finally free from the demon who threatened to destroy their life, all thanks to Steven who saved his daughter and managed to destroy the nightmare that was his father.
Was Tony happy about acquiring a baby on a hunt? Nope, he isn't. Is the baby being a vampire mutant or something a plus that caught his attention? Maybe. Is it a midlife crisis causing Tony to take the child home? Probably. But what can Tony say? He is excited to see what's going to take a place in the mansion after he brings the kid in. Besides, Serpentine had been going on and on about how she wanted grandkids for a year now, and what better way to shut her than bringing her what she asked for? Five years of marriage gives Tony the right to bring babies home, don't they?
"Tony…" Harley called out as soon as he crossed the street; his heart was pounding tightly in his chest as he reached Tony and the strange woman, trying not to flinch when the woman send Harley a glare, looking like she wanted to slap him for his interruption. "Come on, we need to go…" Harley nearly choked on his breath when he took hold of Mr. Tony's hand, trying to pull him toward Mr. Clint's house without shaking in his place at the annoyed and angry look the woman was sending his way.
/Warning/: This chapter contains cursing, darkness (The last part of the chapter is pretty dark so…), horror elements, creepiness, torture (Mentioned); fluff, Steve is so in love! And who knows what! All reviews are appreciated...
"You don't have to do that, Captain Rogers." Jarvis said limping toward Steve to take the mess away from him, but Steve only smiles gently at the old man and directs him to sit on the chair beside the dining table.
A knock on the door made Tony blink and stand up walking toward the door, hoping against hope that the person behind the door wasn't spider-Natasha or God forbid, doll-Bucky who made it their mission to kill him. Opening the door, Tony 'huh'-ed in cion when he saw Steve waiting for him outside the door; Steve was wearing his own matching funeral suit while holding in one hand what looked like a chocolate box in the shape of a heart (But it's wrapping was black and the ribbon was made of spider webs which made Tony's eyes widen in fear of them being poison or something) and in his other hand, he was holding a fresh bouquet of roses… the only reason for them to be fresh was that they were black… Tony can already guess the kind of night he was going to have.
"I am sorry Man of Iron, but I don't think it will be wise to explore Asgard in these dire times, but I assure you when we are done, I Thor Odinson will personally escort you to the explore Asgard like a true warrior!" Thor called out in a cheerful voice which made Steven sigh at that and grumbles.
Made both Steve and Tony raise their heads, only to groan when Peter throw himself at Steve's arms. "Did you hit a growth spurt?" Steve asked in confusion as he took in Peter, probably wondering why Peter was bigger than he remembered him being, which made Tony laugh shakily.
Tony being a partly sane, partly mad genius, and many parts terrified, kept his mouth shut, wondering if all the people in the forties were insane for choosing Addams as a lab rat… a masochist lab rat. "I see… a piece of advice for future events. Never EVER mention this story to anyone, it's enough that you ruined my childhood, I don't need you to ruin the childhood of millions of kids." Maybe Tony shouldn't have said that, because Steve looked like he just won the lottery. "If you ever do that (ruining kids' dreams) I will leave you and the Avengers forever." Tony threat, which caused Steve's face to fall… if condemning his life to hell so that he will save millions of innocent kids? Tony will do it, even if it meant he will hate himself forever.
"This is it, boy, open your eyes…" Steve muttered as he finished replacing the last circuit, Steve lean back and waited for a little bit, five seconds later Steve saw a small jerk in the claw, making Steve grin like a maniac, a minute later and Dum-E wheeled himself a little and start making a strange peeping sounds and advance on Steve with his claw raised, making Steve furrows his brows at that. "JARVIS, a little bit of help please…" Steve said backing toward the computer.
On a lighter note, Pepper and Rhodey are going to show up in the next chapter! :3
"Does it really matter?" Steven asked, a faraway look in his eyes before he let out a tired sigh, leaning on the tree behind him and shrugging his shoulder. "I think you already know, or suspect, either way, I ended up there, a slave for my enemy." Steven saw the twitch of anger the Alpha tried to suppress, and Steven could only look away from the man. "My mother is dead…" A harsh intake of breath, causing Steven to clench his hands into tight fists before crossing his arms over his chest; Steven wondered what the Alpha was thinking of when he heard this painful truth, especially when his mother was considered as a sister.
The screams of pain that greeted Tony when he reached Steve's room; made terror and fear take hold of him and the Alpha could only run to the room, slamming through the door. So many fearful thoughts took hold of Tony's mind; from his mate being attacked by Hydra once more, to him finally losing to the poison and have his body burn from the inside out, which was so scary that Tony nearly chock on his breath.
“Tony, did you see my… oh…” Steve’s voice nearly made Tony jump from his place, shifting to Steve, Tony almost felt guilty at the panic look he caused on the Alpha’s face, as much as Tony wanted to say something to ease the mood, his words got stuck inside of his mouth, and he attempted to say something, struggling to overlook how both he and Steve shifted in their places.
"'s OK…" The small boy whisper, causing Tony's eyes to widen, for this was the first time Harley spoke to Tony directly. "Peter told me that you are a good Omega… not a bad one." At that, Harley glances up before pursing his lips and looking down once more. "He said that you and Mr. Steve are gonna get married soon, and you will become his Mama from now on... that's nice… congratulation?" Harley sounded so confused as he said those words, causing a smile to twitch on Tony's lips; the boy was so precious! He now knew why Steve was attached to the small boy, he sounded just like Peter when Tony first met him.
"I am not a girl!" Tony ended up squeaking in the end, trying to glare at Serpentine, who was looking at him with amusement coloring her eyes, like all the protesting that Tony was doing was just a silly tantrum a three years old was throwing. It was so not fair, Tony's life was so not fair! Why does he have to suffer like this? Why can't Steve notice that Tony doesn't even like him like that? What's wrong with Bucky for not catching Steve's attention sooner than Tony did? Tony didn't want to die!
Edith said which made Steven pause and touch his glasses before putting them on his face gently. "Do as you see fit…" Steven said gently which made the AI chirp and seconds later the suit materialized on Steven's body which made the older man look at his body with an eyebrow-raising. "That's a handy trick." Steven ends up saying as he looked at his body in the mirror, he looked just like he did when he fought in 'The End' it is funny how he didn't change a bit.
All in all, everyone was enjoying themselves, Tony too, for he had met so many amazing people, and was finally able to spend time with all of his friends who he missed dearly and didn't have that much time to spend with them out of their weekly meeting, the only thing that dampened his mood was his father not showing up, which he tried to hide from his fiancé.
The sound of the heartbeat in the room, made Tony freeze, and as fast as he can he turn to the screen looking at the black and white image. "Look here Mr. Carbonell this is your baby." The doctor said happily as she draws a circle around something, Tony narrowed his eyes trying to see, he felt his throat close up as he saw a peanut shape, he swallowed, feeling his eyes becoming glassy…
"Oh, Steve… it is you…" The woman whispered her voice cracked as she close the distance between them, tears clinging into her lashes as she stood in front of him. "You are really awake… I couldn't believe my ears when Bucky told me that you were awake. I am so sorry it took me a long time before coming, Stevie, so sorry." The woman sniffled, her action causing Steve to blink his eyes, wondering who was the woman and why was she talking to him like she knew him.
For as long as he can remember, Tony Stark had everything he ever wanted in his life… everything but his parents' love… Tony tried to adjust after all his parents didn't matter… that's what he tried to convince himself half of the time… but it doesn't matter! He had Aunt Peggy and her mate, Jarvis, and Dummy! (His greatest creation) and he may also have a small (Huge) crush on Captain America… well, the idea of him anyway for the man had long since died sacrificing himself most heroically. Still, half of the teens in America have a crush on Captain America, so Tony still thinks his crush was justified and will go in the end… still, that didn't stop him from running down the stairs like the hounds of hell after him if he knew aunt Peggy was coming over, after all, she was the only person who will take the time out of her busy schedule to amuse him with the Captain's stories. Howard's face always goes blank at the mention of the Captain and he leaves the room most of the time… Anyway, Tony's life may not have been perfect, but for him it was good… as long as he stays away from his father and is left alone in his lab… well his father's, but that was another story.
Natasha and Clint were waiting for them at the door the two of them were arguing about something, when the two noticed them they smiled, their argument is forgotten; they duck out into the street toward Natasha's car. The rain isn't showing any sign of letting up, but Natasha still insists on dragging Tony and his friends to the department store down the street to buy what they need, and it seems she made the right call; for Pepper and Rhodey went and bought what they wanted, Pepper picked out a couple of cable-knit sweaters, a bath towel, and some fitted sheets, throwing them at Rhodey, who folds them over his arm as he follows her around the store, all the while Pepper was complaining about how forgetful Rhodey was, and how amazing the store is. Pepper lingers over the selection of quilts and blankets, settling on a woolen blanket in dark green and a quilt made of squares of muted, earth-toned fabric before shoving Rhodey towards the cashier's desk, and insisting on him paying, glaring at the man until he did, and it caused Tony to laugh silently, for he had missed the couple dearly even when they fight.
"If you have come to look for Steve, then don't, he is dead; now, I want you out of my house or else…" Tony hissed, already ordering Jarvis mentally to deploy one of the suits, if that Loki character wasn't leave his house in the next few seconds, Tony was going to throw him from the top of his tower and watch him become a splat on the sidewalk.
"You are moving fast, don't you think, sweetheart?" Tony teased, gasping when one of Steve's hands sneaked under his shirt going straight to his chest without leaving him a chance to breathe. Steve on the other hand just hummed as he went to town on Tony's neck, gaining gasps and moans, and sighs of pleasures. "If the flight attendance saw -Ah- u-us… you -Mm- are g-going to pay for their therapy…" Tony's breathing hitched, purring deep in his chest when his mate hummed and start kissing him in earnest…
"So this is your workshop…" A voice hummed behind Tony, which made him give a shriek (That he will deny for the rest of his life) and turn to the intruder, wilding his hammer like a weapon ready to throw it at the person who dares to come into his safe haven without his permission, Tony though, stopped in his place when he saw Steven looking at him with a raised eyebrow, Peter was sleeping in his arms clutching Steven's shirt and refusing to let go.
Shrugging, Steve threw his messenger bag in the back seat before turning to the envelope and picking it up. Steve ran his hand gently through the red envelope, gazing at the red star in the middle with a thoughtful look. Turning the envelope in his hands a few times; Steve sighed and decided to open the envelope.
Tony wondered for the past three months why didn't he say anything, he wondered and hated himself when he realized that he had already accepted his daughter's death the day Stane had shot him; Tony's mind had accepted his baby's death, but his heart couldn't, wouldn't, that's why he latched desperately into the child everyone offered him, not caring from where she came, only caring that she was his Morgan and that she was going to stay with him. Maybe, just maybe that made him even worse than this godforsaken town and the people in it.
After that 'Pleasant' day in the police station, Tony decided to say fuck it and return to his work in SI, thankfully his coworkers didn't say anything about his month-long vacation, but Tony was sure that the only reason they kept their mouths shut was because his father was their boss, and him being their future boss meant he could fire them anytime he wants… it was a tempting idea, especially when they decided to be idiots and blow his lab when he was away.
Steve dragged Bucky with him who was still looking at the door with fear, and he sighs at that nodding his head to Loki which made the Alpha pause a little like he couldn't believe that Steve was really back from England, but the dark-haired Alpha just nods his head back and prepare two beers for Bucky and Steve. "Yo, Wilson what got you down like this?" Bucky asked as he sat on Sam's right side while Steve took his left.
Yeah, I hated myself after this chapter…
Ever since Tony snapped out of his feral state after making sure that Steve and Peter were OK; the Alpha was distant, he was dazed and unfocused most of the time, and he was never there anymore. Peter was noticing Tony’s absence, he was noticing and was probably blaming himself because of Tony’s recent behavior, that behavior which was gritting on Steve’s nerves, because where was his Alpha?
That was Steve's thought as he moans in pain as he tried to stand up trying to put his weight on his uninjured leg, he then starts limping toward the open portal that the machine opened, his broken leg hurt so much, and his broken ribs were about a hairbreadth from piercing his lungs, his bruised and broken body hurt him so much that he stays standing any longer and ends up tripping on his way to the machine.
Tony smirked at her a bit and walked in when she stepped back from the door. "Pepper will be putting out a statement in another hour about that," he told her. "Steve told me that there was a cell phone video of the attack on the internet."
“Tony’s thinking about pulling Peter from school until next week,” Steve whispered to Julie as they all walked back inside, Todd making sure the door was shut and secure. “Honestly, I think he’s ready to Home School them until Middle School.”
"Tony doesn't like to admit that he sometimes needs help," Mary said softly. "He's," and she hesitated. Steve could kind of understand, it wasn't her story to tell. "Tony is complicated, to say the least." Steve just hummed softly, nodding. He still wanted to meet the man, he felt like he needed to now. What was this Tony really like? To Peter he was Daddy, near about a superhero to him; to Mary he was a co-parent, and friend. But to Steve, he was someone who was trying to do right, but could probably be doing more. Peter and Mary deserved the best, and if Steve had to knock some sense into this Tony, to accept help, and to reach his full potential, then he would.
“What if that is what I’m aiming for?” Tony asked, watching the numbers of the floors steadily flash by.
“Capt- -stems seem to be- -come back to- -reboot needed. Sir-“ Jarvis was stuttering on the other end, static creeping up. Izzie was saying something else and Bucky looked ready to run into the school.
Peter's hand went out to Tony's arc reactor, and laid his head against Tony's shoulder. "Phil is sad," Peter said quietly. Tony's son was too observant. "He loves Mama, too."
Tony didn't move, he watched her drop to her knees in front of him, and bring her hands up to his head. He was defiant in his gaze, watching her eyes light up with red again, throwing them both into his head of horrors. Neither of them were expecting what happened though.
, he thought.
"I love you, t-"
"Enough to see me enjoying a song," she chuckled, hooking the keys of her car to one of her belt loops. "I'm not going to pretend that what I was doing was dancing, and it's not the first time I've gotten odd looks, I just really like music."
"I hope you aren't thinking that this is a new development," Steve said with a raised eyebrow. "I've been told that I've always been like this."
"Shut it down, Dr Selvig," Tony said, maintaining a hover.
"You liiiiiike him," she sing-songed. Steve's eyes widened a little, and Meg started to cackle quietly. "You really like him! And that's why he's messing with your music." She reached into her pocket pulling out her own phone. "Alright, I'm gonna need details, let's do this. I can be an awesome wingman."
“Heart condition, seriously people!” Tony put a hand on his chest. “I’m going to put a proximity bell on you.”
Rhodey glanced over and nodded. "It's kind of a classic, easy, snack. Surprised you actually know what it is."
“No, I’m sorry, love,” Peggy murmured. “He’s not with us anymore.” The small pokemon seemed to deflate a little, and turned around to slowly walk back over to Tony.
"I don't wanna hear anything!" Sam called out to them as he walked past the kitchen. Tony couldn't control which finger he sent in reply.
"The active cells are triggering the dormant ones," Tony said, pulling up another screen to the side of the results, in formulaic form this time. "Add a few more corn kernals to the hot oil, and just wait for the heat to distribute. It's like, steroids for a Super Soldier. I wouldn't have been able to calculate for that." Bruce looked at Tony then, catching his eyes, knowing where his thoughts were headed.
Tony put the briefcase down, furthest away from Loki, and he and Steve followed Natasha off to the side. Thor was looking over quizzically as well. "You took the whole hospital bed?" Steve looked at the red-head as Tony went about checking Coulson's chart. Tucked into the corner and strapped down was Phil Coulson, asleep and unconscious in the hospital bed, with minimal equipment surrounding him. The sounds of the engines had drown out the sound of beeping machines.
He felt the jet start, and eventually take off, but Tony didn't move. Peter started to drift off in his arms, and for just a moment, Tony could forget everything else that was happening. Inside the jet, inside that room, on that couch, in that moment, Tony was just like any other father. He was holding onto his son, his child, that he would do anything for. His fingers started to card through Peter's hair, idly thinking that it was getting long, a bit shaggy. He could see the waves from the natural curls that he had inherited from Tony. Tony liked to keep his hair short so he didn't have deal with those curls anymore.
"You bite your tongue!" Her words only caused Tony to laugh.
"Wake up Mary," Tony demanded. He was done messing around. "You got what you wanted, now give me what I want. Now." Loki simply held up his cuffed hands, and Tony put his hand out behind him, palm up. "Key."
“Think of the number, and whichever one you were going to give me. Then give me the other number.”
"We got the reports, Cap," Natasha threw in.
Tony moved his head a little when he saw Mary walk in the room, sitting in one of the seats across from the couch. Mary looked at Peter, watching him as a mother does sometimes, eyes soft, a little smile on her lips. Tony wondered if she wanted more kids. He knows that she surely hadn't planned on having Peter, still lost in the grief of losing her husband. Perhaps they had talked about it, maybe they didn't, but Tony knows that she had not been planning on this, least of all with someone like Tony Stark.
“Necessary risk.” Tony rubbed his temples a little, and glanced over at the other side of the bed. Jamie was asleep between a sleeping Wade and Peter. The two boys didn’t want to leave Tony alone until they knew that he was going to be alright, specially after Steve had gotten him back in the car completely not conscious.
Unbeta'd as usual, and Marvel owns more than I do.
I do have part of a new chapter written, but I've just had a lot of big, and emotional, decisions. There are plans, but it's trying to get the plans rolling that's really weighing heavy on my shoulders. It's hard to do all the big things that need to be done, in less than a month, when all the money is being funneled into my mom's recovery.
"Because it's something that would happen to me," Tony shrugged a little. "Alright, if I can talk to you, which has happened too many time, it's time for you to talk to me." His fingers played with a long lock of hair. "Have you thought about getting a haircut? Peter and I are going to get haircuts sometime soon, you should come with us." Steve gave him a confused smile, like he was unsure how Tony could be serious, then throw in something mundane. Tony found the expression absolutely adorable.
“You’re not entirely sold on the whole idea of talking to someone else, a stranger really, about your problems.” Tony nodded to her, folding his glasses in his hands. “You wouldn’t be the first the think that, and you won’t be the last. Even with a celebrity status such as yours, that feeling can be amplified, along with other negative thoughts about it.” Tony slipped his glasses back on, not looking at the Doctor. “I actually wish that I saw more that are constantly in a spotlight sought out our services. It could really help coping mechanisms, a way to deal with the immense amounts of stress that come with life.”
"Less than an hour, Sir," Jarvis supplied helpfully.
“Greasy food? Over-indulgent sweets?”
“We’ll started with just buttered noodles,” Tony countered. “I don’t feel like coating the new kitchen in plastic tarps when she starts actually spaghetti sauce.”
He heard the piano playing as he came up the stairs, and knew that Obie had been there for a little while. Tony almost froze when he saw one of Peter's stuffed animals underneath the couch, but it was hidden, mostly; nothing was peeking out.
"Oh, there is mercy. Pause and put him on!" Tony flopped back on the arm of the couch. "Steve!"
"I'm testing it with Jamie's as well," Bruce said with a nod. "I'll send those results over when they're done."
"Repulsors offline. Missiles offline," Jarvis reported mournfully. Stane squeezed again, the HUD display starting to crack, and more red than anything was flashing in his face.
"You have an incredible talent," William said to Steve as he looked at the drawing. "No wonder Peter is so good at art if you're the one teaching him." Tony turned a little to grin at Steve, seeing his cheeks turn a bit pink at the praise. He reached his arm out, grabbing Steve's arm and pulling him over to him and Peter.
"Is it just me or does he seem-"
"Sounds like a plan. Now, go do Agent-y things, with Agent, and get SHIELD off my back. Bye." He made a motion and Jarvis cut the call. Bruce was smiling at him, the fact that SHIELD probably knew where he was now mostly forgotten.
Steve was glad that he decided to not wear his uniform into the school, looking at the number of parents and staff still around, but he knew he was getting more than a few looks when he hopped on his motorcycle, the shield secured on the front. He didn’t have time to worry about it, not when he needed to find Wade, get him away from his father.
It didn't take long for Tony to lose himself, his brain only able to focus on touch, feel, and sound. The way he and Steve was constantly touching, in contact, moving against each other, he wasn't sure when one began and the other ended. The sounds coming from both of them were just obscene; moans and whimpers, pleas and names, Tony felt it all, every sound and every word, almost as much as he felt their bodies against each other, almost as much as he felt Steve moving inside of him.
Steve blinked, expression fairly deadpan, and he looked down at the now sleeping Jamie. “Please, please don’t take after your Uncle Bucky.”
"How is she?" Tony asked after a second.
Steve leaned against the wall of the hospital room, curtains drawn, door closed, thankful that the night staff was quiet. Not that they'd see him in the room unless they were looking for him. Natasha was waiting outside the hospital for him, keeping an eye out, hidden as well. After she had released all of Hydra's secrets on the internet, everyone knew who she was, and now who Steve was. Jarvis was working, along with Bruce, to grab and hide other details, but that was something that Steve couldn't help with. He had learned how to use the tech of the Twenty-First century, but that didn't mean he knew the first thing about hacking.
"I informed them they should give birth in the hospital, but no! They chose to do a home birth, and now my household will turn into a crime scene." Howard grumbled, unknowingly answering Maria's question, causing the woman delivered a silent pray that Steve will get through this day, she really liked the Alpha, he was a good one for her Tony, besides she doesn't wish for her granddaughter and grandson growing up without a father.
"I noticed that you didn't have many pictures of the baby." Steve whispered, and that made Tony shake in his place, and for his eyes to turn glossy with tears that refused to fall, he opened the album while holding his breath, only to let out a shaky sigh when the first picture his eyes fell on was of his baby in the hospital closed, being held by a man and a woman. "Those are Ben and May…" Steve explained, but Tony didn't pay it much attention as his hands traced the baby that the two of them were holding, his eyes never left the sleeping form, even when they clouded up with tears.
"I don't wear heels! Tony hissed as he tried to keep his voice down, face turning red from embarrassment. Steven couldn't help but let out a genuine laugh at Tonys expression; it was the same look that his husband always sent him every time he brought up the subject of the man's high heels collections.
!" Tony blinked even more at that, OK, what's going on, what does the words
"I'm sorry…" Maria ended apologizing, but she didn't know for what she apologized, for what Howard had done? Or for her for not noticing anything and going on with her life as nothing else mattered, she didn't know, and the Omega seemed to know that too because he just nodded his head and guide her to the living room, giving her an out even when she didn't deserve it. "My name is…" She couldn't even say her name, she didn't know what the Omega will do hearing it, but the Omega just looked at her with a smile.
Even when his father tried to calm him with tears in his eyes, Tony just cried, screaming at his father to give him his baby back…
12-Para Mark. -Mating Mark.
"What… what do I own you?" Tony finally whispered after fifteen minutes of silence, as he took the map and looked at the man, his mind warring between running away from this place and this man and believing him, but the thing is, Tony doesn't know how long he has before his father catches up with him, he is already running out of time if Stane is already this close to him… but if there is a chance that what the man was saying to him was true… then there is a chance of Tony saving his baby and raising them in peace, in a place, not even his father knows about!
Walking, Tony froze in front of the entrance to the living room, his breath hitching in his chest when he caught from the corner of his eyes someone sitting on the armchair. Turning around slowly, the breath rushed out of Tony's lungs, his eyes widen in terror when he notices who was sitting on the armchair making himself comfortable as he gazed around the room in boredom.
"You and me, buddy." Steve offered to Peter as he starts walking toward the car, leading Tony with him by the waist, though not before kissing his cheek once again, giving the bear a mocking glare, causing Peter to puff his chest in pride and for Tony to chuckle at his Alpha's actions.
/Warning/: This Chapter contains, cursing, sadness, fluff, horror elements, poor Tony, and finally, the baby is here! All reviews are appreciated.
Frigga turned to him, her gaze searching and full of curiosity, it felt like hours, but the truth it was only a few moments long. Frigga smiled then, her eyes sparkling and wonder was shining in them, it seemed like whatever she was looking for she found at this moment. "I know you will, after all, the Ancient One, gave you his blessings." Frigga said these words with pride and love shining brightly.
"Ah, yes, can you please direct me to…" Tony took the paper from his pocket to look at it checking the name once more, not like he haven't memorized it from how much he repeated that name. "Sam Wilson." Tony raised his head to see the man studying him a little.
