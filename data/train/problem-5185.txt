'He is the perfect excuse,' she admits with a fond glance at the boy. 'I do have a meeting of my own today though, so I'll have to leave you boys to it.'
'It's also why he recognised me, you see?' Tony continues. 'They had someone who looked like me, or was wearing one of those masks to be me, and they had him exist in the way Howard did for me back then.'
Steve watches him leave and then tidies up the remains of their lunch. After that he starts picking up Pete's toys which are pretty literally covering the entire penthouse floor.
'Dull,' he can hear Tony's dismissal. 'Pepper only makes me come to remind the Board how much better they have it when I don't come. One moment...' Tony starts speaking rapidly in a language Steve doesn't understand. Steve can hear the responses of whoever Tony's speaking to and keeps quiet as they finish their conversation.
'You close, pet?' Tony rakes his fingers across Steve's shoulders. Steve is making soft whimpering noises against his neck as he grinds them together. He kisses the taller man's face and coaxes him into loosening his arms.
'You were telling me something before,' Steve remembers. 'Something that you didn't want Tony to know you were telling me?'
‘If Jarvis is wrong and his memory doesn’t come back he won’t learn trust us again if we just let him go.’
'He's a damn virgin, Pepper!' Tony interrupts. 'He's been waiting for the perfect girl to come along and they'd get married and then have sex and then have All American babies and a dog or whatever. He wants that, Pepper. I can't take that from him.'
Tony slumps against him and rests his head under his chin so Steve wraps both arms around him and Pete.
The hologram shows the latest stock levels, that he has twenty new emails (Jarvis filters out everything except what he might read), the data for the most recent escape pod prototype and, tucked away in the bottom right, the heartbeat readout from Jim's incubator.
The next morning Tony regains consciousness to the increasingly familiar sensation of having a small boy using him as a climbing frame,
'Scrambled,' Tony replies as he abandons his drill beside the box of sensors. The Iron Man boots drop off as Tony walks over to him. 'I like the new look, Cap; half naked with bed head is a look you really pull off well.'
'The generator sir made was for Doctor Richards and he has been known to experiment with alternate realities,' Jarvis points out calmly. 'Perhaps you have received information from these realities through extremis from the device.'
‘Definitely,’ Tony waves a hand dismissively. ‘Don’t know what I’d do if I didn’t find you randomly camped out in my lab every afternoon.’
‘No, Tony’s still angry with me. Can you… summarise this for him? Let him know I would love to be invited down?’
'Look, doll,' he drawls, 'you and Bruce? Sure. I can get on board with that. But Clint? No. And something tells me Natasha would rather try her hand at running SI for me than looking after a baby.'
Tony looks up from his work as Steve is granted access and looks faintly baffled. He’s still wearing the clothes from when Steve last saw him so he assumes either Tony hasn’t slept or he slept down here with his bots.
'Not forever!' Tony tries reassuring her. 'Cap's still a little... unsettled in this century. If I tell him the kid is his then he'll have this responsibility that he can't walk away from. He isn't ready for this bullshit, Pep.'
'Why didn't I think of building blocks?' Tony asks as Pete examines his new toy with all the seriousness a three and a half year old can muster.
Steve hadn’t noticed Tony tensing in his sleep but he jolts upright with a wordless yell. His eyes are wide as his heels scrabble for purchase against the sofa and he pushes himself against the arm,
'Thanks a lot,' Clint pulls a face and then pokes him in the stomach. He giggles so Clint does it again, 'oh my god, you're ticklish. Is your dad ticklish? How quickly will Jarvis kill me if I try to find out?'
'No harm done,' he interrupts, gesturing to Pete, before Steve can continue. 'And the first photos they have of him are with him clearly being happy to see me; should cut off many of the complaints, and having you there will have helped.'
The picture he has of Jim is already soft at the corners where he keeps pulling it out of his wallet.
'No, thank you, Mr Stark,' she beams at Tony as he grabs Steve's hand and tugs until he follows him to the lift.
He presses himself firmly against Steve as the soldier shivers. The soldier turns to hug him close and presses his face into Tony's neck. He's slowly regaining control of his breathing.
He opens the box to find a small white baby grow. On the front are written the words 'My Daddy is a Captain!' over an image of his shield.
Steve gazes up as the genius gives him one last lick before shifting onto his knees and taking himself in hand. Their eyes lock through Steve's afterglow as Tony jerks himself off over Steve's chest before slumping forwards and curling against the soldier's side.
But Tony had himself injected with an untested serum just because he didn't think he could spare the time to heal.
All he needs to do is work things out with Tony. This would be fine except he doesn’t think he can look Tony in the eye right now.
‘Sir is stable enough now for us to work on the spare arc reactor,’ Jarvis tells him and Steve is not imagining the relief in his tone. ‘Dummy don’t… that was unnecessary, Dummy.’
'Ok...' he pulls the sheet aside to find a beautiful oil painting. He finds himself studying the brush work before he can stop himself, 'it's lovely. The artist must have been a fan of Da Vinci; it's in the same style.'
'Right,' Tony nods, looking more uncertain than Steve has ever seen him. 'He never told me, you know? Howard never told me if he...'
'Alright,' he files the information away in his head; two at the Stark Mansion, three at Stark Tower and one away.
Steve realises, while he's out shopping, that he's been staring intently through a shop window at an unsuspecting used car for a good five minutes while he tries to decide if what they did means he's lost his virginity.
'Ok,' Steve makes the effort to smile at the boy who's tracing the star on his chest with a finger, 'we're good aren't we? And Tony'll be back before you know it.'
'So he'll have the relationship with the boy but not any of the responsibility,' Bruce shakes his head with a smile. 'Tony, that's an interesting line your morals are letting you walk.'
'Tony, your conference call is at eleven,' Pepper gestures with her tablet. 'We should have the numbers in from California this afternoon and you know the Gala is a week tomorrow?'
But then there was the startled look on Tony's face when he called them a family; a look that became a mild freak out. That was a little heartbreaking.
Admittedly he also hasn't done anything useful either, such as question Tony on what this all actually means.
Nobody actually ever told Steve that Tony doesn’t like to be handed things until Tony himself had to.
'Just running the numbers on an idea I had for the Quinjets,' Tony tips the screen towards him as if any of it will mean anything to him.
'Of course I have time,' she scoffs at him. 'Tony, you know you're going to have to be careful how you release this to the media.'
Long story short Bruce is electrocuted and Hulk emerges in the communal area. Steve, Clint and Natasha are all there at the time and back away slowly. Steve scans the room for the best way to get out and possibly get to his shield. He guesses the other two are thinking along the same lines.
'I am wherever sir is, Captain,' Jarvis replies. 'My ability to track and respond to him is not at the level we enjoy within his homes or within the suits, but it is sufficient.'
'You named him,' Steve approves as he sits down across from Tony. A quick glance at the screen that is the coffee table shows a large number of pictures of brightly coloured children's toys.
Steve follows obediently. Upstairs he lets Tony strip him of the rest of his uniform and push him into the shower. He half expects to be joined, but Tony waits for him to finish before taking his turn.
Tony enters his bedroom and gazes for a minute at where his son is asleep on his bespoke bed, still clutching his suit jacket. He smiles and gets changed before climbing into the opposite side of the bed.
'Did they hurt you?' Steve tries to get a better view of the boy but he flinches and scoots further behind the machine. 'I'm sorry,' Steve leans back again, 'I won't hurt you. I promise you're safe now.'
‘Butterfingers, get him a blanket,’ Tony waves a hand at the robot who dutifully rolls away towards the back of the workshop.
He gives up, for now, once his son is awake. Instead he takes Pete down to the workshop and shows him a car engine.
'Looks to be mostly positive,' Pepper ignores his interruption. 'Some people are asking why they haven't seen him before but most seem happy that you haven't been shoving him into the limelight as a baby.'
'Hey,' Tony yells up to Hulk when he gets to his side, the giant swings his head down and snorts. 'I'm not going to let you live down trying to defend a master assassin from a street bum, by the way.'
The door opens further to reveal Pete wearing a Captain America costume, with a shield, as he runs to his father,
'This doesn't make any sense, Jay,' Tony shoves his chair back from his desk and spins in a circle. 'Either I'm completely misunderstanding what Reed has written or he's, what? Written it wrong in case it gets into the wrong hands? He's not that responsible.'
‘Anyway!’ Tony claps his hands together. ‘I have a lot to do tomorrow so I’m going to go and pass out somewhere.’
Two days after Clint and Natasha arrive, Pepper leaves to join Tony where he apparently got waylaid in Paris.
'Of course you can stay, but I have to keep working,' he drills another hole to match a mark indicated by Jarvis.
'Of course sir,' Jarvis walks to the counter and produces another of Tony's black credit cards from somewhere within the armour. When he returns to his creator with the phone Tony takes it from him with no hesitation and gives it to Pete.
'Don't say it like that, it makes you sound like a creep. Also, I used your credit card, I hope you don't mind.'
‘He’s in lockdown,’ Pepper scowls. ‘Unless you can convince Jarvis to let you in you’ll have to wait for Tony to come out.’
‘I’m fine,’ Tony agrees and then winces and puts a hand to the glow in his chest. ‘Actually this hurts like hell, but I’m not in danger any longer. Jarvis, I still have some pain killers down here somewhere?’
'I'm sorry I didn't tell you, Steve, but I can't break the trust of a man who gives it so rarely and for some reason has given it to me.'
'Of course, and Cap actually. Pete is quite convinced that Cap making me coffee in the morning is essential for my health,' he aims for charming with his grin.
'It's an incredible watch,' Clint gestures through the glass. 'I borrow that card from Pete and Stark will never even know...'
Blanking his mind to think just of the next punch; just the next thump against the reinforced weave of the bag, works for a little while, but then other thoughts fight their way into his mind.
'Tony?!' he reaches immediately to grasp at the suit. The gauntlets are still framing his face and the faceplate is flipped back to reveal the very worried, very alive, Anthony Stark.
'You have questions,' Tony waves a hand. 'Jarvis had to threaten to shoot you to keep me from going completely off the rails, you deserve some answers. So, one time offer, shoot.'
‘I’m not talking to myself,’ Tony scowls through his obvious confusion at finding Steve in the room. ‘I’m talking to Jarvis.’
'I did,' Steve flips Bruce's pancakes one at a time. 'He's playing with Pete and waiting for Colonel Rhodes to arrive.'
Natasha scowls and fixes her gaze on Fury while Clint just goes still and stares at nothing in particular. Bruce and Thor look confused.
'Well, I haven't got anything down,' he washes the last of the toast down with coffee and finally looks around the lab. 'Oh, right, that thing for Reed. When did he want it?'
'Who are you calling?' Clint grimaces as he hands it over. 'Thor will be terrible in this situation, Tasha is away, Bruce would be even worse than Thor...'
‘Doctor Banner?’ Tony suddenly seems to recognise him and sticks out a hand. ‘I know we’ve already met but hello.’
'It shouldn't work that way,' Tony throws up his hands. 'None of what you just said should be possible.'
He assumes there's more in Steve's life than the Avengers and working out but other than sketching he doesn't really know what he man does with his time.
'Steve, you are a national icon and you have no idea how much it turns me on that I've dragged you down to my level.'
'Gimme,' Tony pries one of the soldier’s hands from his hip and moans as he adds it to his own around their cocks. 'There...' he gulps a breath, 'that's... that's good.'
‘I’m not sure I trust myself to be around him and not touch,’ he tells Bruce honestly as he looks over at Tony’s sleeping face.
'You can't just experiment on yourself like this!' Steve argues then gives into the temptation to pull Tony into his arms.
'That's adorable and I love that you haven't realised that Jarvis is smart enough to know better and is messing with you.'
'Good job,' Tony tells him as he reloads. Pete beams and then runs to duck behind a box of paints as Tony takes aim. 'That's cheating Pete; Starks don't cheat.'
‘Sir is currently asleep in the penthouse, Captain,’ Jarvis tells him. ‘Shall I take a message for you?’
The car shoots forwards and crashes into the wall before rebounding, righting itself, and zooming off to run straight into Steve's side table. The table gracefully topples to the floor as the car speeds on.
'Open your mouth,' Tony's eyes are practically black with arousal as he rubs his tip against Steve's tongue. 'Just.. licking is good.' Steve's eyes slip shut as he closes his lips around Tony and starts rubbing against him with his tongue.
He sheds his clothes as he crosses the room and slips into the bed. Steve is curled on his side with an arm half reached towards Tony's side of the bed. Tony presses his back against Steve's chest and tugs Steve's arm around his waist.
'Ah, he has your likeness,' Thor beams and places his hammer just inside the door. 'Greetings, little one, I am Thor Odinson of Asgard.'
‘I can,’ Jarvis’ voice floats over them. ‘Sir’s summary of my creation is not inaccurate and I take no offence.’
After giving Bruce directions, and hanging up, Steve orders them a couple of drinks. He gazes at the picture until the chair across from him is pulled out and Bruce sits down.
'Pete,' Tony starts gesturing to his team mates, 'you remember Bruce? And that's Clint and Natasha. Where's Cap?'
'Why?' Bruce asks innocently and then looks surprised at himself. 'Sorry, Steve, of course you don't have to do anything you don't feel comfortable with.'
'Eliminating the nature verses nurture variable,' Fury mutters to himself; a statement that Steve resigns himself not to understand.
'Unless it's somehow messing with the data you're collecting,' he shakes his head, 'and possibly with my brain.'
'Now you get to meet all of Dada's team mates,' Tony tells him as they ride up. 'We'll put these back in the penthouse and then we'll go down to the communal floor for food.'
'If I agree to let you up,' Tony speaks between nips to Steve's throat, 'and we take this to the penthouse, will you stop stopping yourself making a sound?'
‘Stark?’ the agent sounds confused, ‘he isn’t here. He said he had work to do? The Director was furious when he got that message.’
‘Certainly, Captain,’ Jarvis sounds increasingly desperate but he’s still unfailing polite. ‘The second node on the left of the third circular port,’ Steve squints, ‘must be Dummy no!’
They get ice creams and walk along window shopping. Clint and Pete seem equally attracted to shiny things.
It’s a week later when Steve walks into the kitchen to find Tony sitting on the island fixing the microwave and muttering about ‘god-damned demigods’. He can’t help but stride across the room and scoop Tony into a hug; Tony yelps in surprise but relaxes again then laughs,
‘You can still make the shot from that far?’ Steve asks and receives only a dirty look as a response. ‘Alright! Ok, that’s great. Then we can…’
'Good afternoon, sir,' Jarvis greets him. 'To when are you referring? You passed out on your desk a little over seven hours ago and Captain Rogers was not here.'
'If it is indeed affecting the network as you suggest,' Jarvis sounds worried, 'then it could conceivably use extremis to reach you.'
Steve doesn't let him say anything else before they're kissing again and the soldier's hands have migrated to his arse.
'Did he know about her?' Steve's casual tone is completely at odds with how every muscle in his back is tensed.
'Hey Cap,' Pete beams at him before climbing onto his chest. Steve huffs a breath as two smalls knees dig into his gut. 'Do you need coffee to help your brain?'
'Jarvis, Tony doesn't trust me,' he states, somehow without his voice wavering. 'But he'll still let me near his sons...'
'Maybe I looked at them in my sleep with extremis and just don't remember?' he asks into the network.
'Galas for the charities supported by the Maria Stark Foundation are always held at the Stark Mansion,' he shrugs.
It happens when he manages to confuse himself while using his Stark Phone. He tries for a while to figure it out himself, but as he’s really nervous to touch the thing in case he makes it worse that is clearly not happening.
'What have we got here then?' he stares at the boy who clutches at Steve's arm but stares right back.
'So you want the Iron Man plushie?' he can't help the amusement he feels watching Tony's boy choosing between the range of Avengers plushies.
He’s fiddling with a tablet that he’s most likely stolen from Pepper and rubbing absently at his arc reactor.
'Let's get out of here,' Steve decides. 'We don't need to wait for SHIELD and the quicker we get back to the helicarrier, the quicker we can get home.'
'Quite the opposite, Captain,' Jarvis disagrees. 'Sir believes your presence will be beneficial in whatever form.'
'Good afternoon, Captain,' Jarvis interrupts Clint. 'Sir is busy at this time. May I take a message?'
'Oh, like they didn't know where this was headed,' the last of Tony's words is drowned out by a roar from behind them and the sounds of a scuffle.
Steve isn’t in the best form during the debriefing. He barely listens to run down of the fight, he doesn’t add anything to the discussion on tactics and he honestly doesn’t even notice when they start talking about who the group might have been allied with.
‘Get Dummy to box up a reactor and get someone to put it on the jet. I’ll meet it in Hawaii or Malibu.’
The meeting then spirals into an argument between Fury, Natasha and Clint. Steve isn't feeling sufficiently generous to assist the Director  beyond standing beside Clint ready to restrain him if necessary. Everyone is on their feet now, except Bruce, and it takes Steve a moment to realise that Tony's gone.
‘You know,’ Tony looks up into the Hulk’s face, ‘I was honestly expecting this to happen a lot more quickly.’
'I told you before I have a documented weakness for being talked into bad decisions by Starks,' Steve looks apologetic.
'Of course they are,' Tony mutters to himself. 'We knew they'd be good. I just want to know what's affecting the data set.'
'I meant you and me!' Steve stands up suddenly and waves a hand. 'Jarvis, aren't we friends? Why didn't you tell me?'
‘I don’t have that much time,’ Tony mutters as he glances at Pepper who’s still sleeping on the bed. He looks at Steve, ‘I need to overload the reactor while it’s still in my chest. It will destroy the virus before burning out but then I’ll need a whole new chest piece.’
‘Talking to yourself is a sign of madness,’ Steve points out, making Tony jolt in surprise, ‘Clint told me.’
Steve comes apart beneath him with a cry of 'Tony!'. Steve's erratic movements, and the sight of him, are enough to push Tony over the edge to join him.
'I just don't understand why,' Steve accepts the photo back. 'He knows I... He must know I like him? And he knows I like kids. Pete likes me. Does he just not think I'll... bring anything extra?'
'Ok...' there's a small pause. 'Not all of us can storm a beach, or drive a tank, but there's still a way all of us can fight.'
'It's going to be fine,' Tony repeats softly and starts pressing kisses to his neck. 'Come on, let me distract you...'
‘This is Stark we’re talking about,’ Clint smirks but it’s a frayed expression, ‘you think he trusted us before?’
He hears a gasp to his right and turns his head in time to see his son dash across the stage to join him behind his podium. Pete wraps his arms around his leg and clings. Across the stage Steve is standing two strides out of cover with one hand uselessly outstretched.
A quarter of an hour later the three of them reach the Quinjet. Steve beelines for the monitor so he can check on Tony while Clint and Natasha stand on the ramp watching for anyone who may have followed them. Steve pulls up what should be the video feed from Tony's helmet but all he can see is a rock and the feed is sideways.
'Made some spending money in a casino, bought a new yacht, finalised the details for my surgery...' Tony adds as he finishes off two mugs of coffee. 'Steve! I have to show you something. Is there anything else, Ms Potts?'
'I'm his favourite billionaire and he's my favourite super soldier,' he grins. 'Does that make it fair?'
'I do not know if the artist was a fan of himself,' Jarvis responds blandly, 'but he certainly has a recognisable style.'
‘Jarvis!’ Tony calls, but of course the AI doesn’t respond here. He flinches away violently from Steve’s outstretched hand and manages to remove the IV from his arm as well as the monitors for his blood pressure and his heart rate.
Steve responds to the kiss automatically as a ridiculous part of his mind wonders if he’ll ever be kissed and not be surprised by it.
'Alright,' Tony turns back to the press, 'I have a second announcement for you today, you lucky people,' he leans down and scoops his son into his arms. 'This is Peter Jarvis Stark and he's my son.'
'There's a third guest room,' Tony tells him. 'Jim can have that. After that I'd have to convert the workshop downstairs into living quarters so I guess that'll be it for the Stark line.'
'Right,' Tony rubs his hands together and gets up. 'I should probably go to bed now then. You may not have heard, but I have a hot date with two gorgeous young men tomorrow morning.' Steve laughs. 'Goodnight, Captain.'
'If you might take a suggestion, Captain, I suggest telling sir that your uniform is tight and you hope he may be able to help you with that,' Jarvis sounds far too amused about this.
‘Out!’ Tony points at the door as Steve clutches his sketchbook up and heads to the door quickly. ‘I’d kick you out of the damn tower except I’d probably crash my stocks and I’ve done that enough recently! Just… keep away from me.’
Tony sits at the little table in Steve's kitchen and watches him vaguely as he moves around getting things from cupboards. It occurs to him that in the last three days it never occured to him to ask Steve what he'd been doing while Tony was upstairs in his workshop.
'We are so dead,' Clint moans dramatically. 'If Tony doesn't kill us then you can bet that Steve will.'
'It's... like déjà vu,' Tony speaks against Steve's chest. 'Like I've lived this before. I have... I remember living this day twice before.'
Tony plays with Pete until Jarvis announces Rhodey's arrival a couple of hours later. He gets up from the floor to greet the lift,
'Ok, you know he has a little boy and another on the way?' she waits for him to nod. 'The first, Peter, is a clone of Tony himself but the second, who he's going to call Jim, is biologically Tony and Steve's.'
'Ah, well, borrow mine then,' Tony tells him as he comes back over and sits beside him. 'There are going to be times when I can't have them with me. I'm the only one around here actually holding down a job after all.'
. Moving out really would be giving up though and he really doesn’t want to loose Tony completely from his life. Part of him also worries what his departure might do to Tony, who’s had far too many people let him down before.
‘On average you are now down to one a week, sir,’ Jarvis adjusts the lighting as Tony moves across the room. ‘Though this week you have had three. I suspect an outside source has caused you to become unsettled.’
‘It’s alright, Tony,’ Steve tells him and squeezes his hand tighter when Tony just stares up at him.
'Come on,' Steve props him up into a seating position. 'I need to make sure you don't brain yourself on the way to bed.'
That Steve’s stomach does flips at the sight of that smile is just something he’s going to have to learn to live with.
'Yeah, but that's totally for me because I feel neglected that you won't let me play with the real one.'
When Tony does call he's enthusiastic and loud and clearly thinking a million different things at once. Their conversation is disappointingly short but at least Tony's on his way home.
Tony takes one step backwards and then sits down heavily onto the workshop floor. Dummy beeps and whirs at him in concern and he feels the other two bots turn their attention to him in his mind.
'I don't know,' Tony hesitates before stepping closer to Steve. 'I spent all of my yesterday afternoon thinking about this, assuming that actually happened, and I don't know what to think anymore.'
'Bruce,' Steve smiles, 'I'm so glad you're here. Sit, have a coffee,' he pushes a mug into his hands, 'I'm making pancakes.'
'You're panting too hard for kissing now so I bite at your lips and press kisses over your face. When you tip your head back I bite your neck and add a twist of the wrist to my hand action.
'You realise the potential fallout?' he laughs. 'We're running a team together, he lives in my current main residence and we're about to have a kid together; I can't let our relationship collapse. Also I'm pretty sure Pep made me promise never to fuck virgins.'
'Surrogate,' Tony lounges while Pepper perches with a tablet on her knee. 'The same surrogate for both boys, though we aren't admitting Jim yet. We won't release her name for privacy reasons.'
He puts three plates at Tony's side and pours their coffees. Pete has wiggled his way into one of bar stools by the time Steve turns around, which makes him feel terrible.
Right, like he'd ever let this stand that long. He knows he'll be fighting for a resolution long before four days.
'stand by you,' he stutters, 'but I will. For as long as you'll let me, I'll be here for you and the boys. I just need to know what you'll let me do; I need to know how not to overstep.'
Pepper turns to smile at him as Tony stands beside her and strips off his top. Steve's eyes widen as Tony promptly strips off his boxers as well and takes the coffee from Pepper as he steps around her to get fresh underwear.
For the second night in a row Steve jolts awake as the door to his suite opens. This time he knows what to listen for so he recognises the padding of small feet coming closer.
This, Steve thinks, is either going to be an amazing experience or an utter disaster leading to bloodshed. But right now, surrounded by his team, he finds he’s happy.
'You want to sleep with him,' Rhodey looks like he's contemplating walking out and coming back later.
'Your mind with Steve's serum?' Bruce suggests with a shrug. 'Maybe just a simple straight up bargaining chip against you both.'
Just as he's expecting things to heat up he feels Tony shake his head and push himself up a little. He turns his head to look up at him. Tony's expression is nervous determination for a split second before morphing into a cocky smile.
'And if the child bares an uncanny resemblance to Steve?' Bruce asks, but he's smiling so Tony's pretty sure he's happy with this plan.
'Ms Potts, I apologise for the interruption but I suspect sir is thinking of the film entitled Groundhog Day.'
Watching his friend casually overdose on caffeine as he forces himself to work through his exhaustion isn't his idea of fun.
Steve glances at Tony, preparing to take his leave, and sees Tony's expression; he looks so purely happy that Steve pauses.
'Right,' he agrees, confused, as he stands as well and is shown to the door. He falters and turns back to Pepper when he reaches the hallway, 'I'm in love with him, Pepper.'
'Sir is on his jet having a video conference with his Board of Directors. Would you like me to bring up the feed?'
‘Tony,’ Steve smiles even as he looks carefully at the jagged wound on his temple, ‘you’re late home.’
‘How long will it take before you can put it in?’ Steve asks as Tony sits in the co-pilot seat with the new reactor and some fine-detail tools.
He steps off onto his own floor intending to go straight to the shower but stops when he sees what looks like a large picture frame covered with a dust sheet.
'You were busy,' Steve is apparently drinking in the sight of him. 'You've only been down there three days and you're here now.'
'I just thought he'd cope better if he wasn't overwhelmed with all this so early,' Tony replies quietly.
Tony sits up further and then throws his leg over Steve so he's straddling his hips. Steve's hands automatically find their way to Tony's waist. He looks up at the genius in confusion.
The next hour is one of the most stressful of Steve’s life and when the battle is finally over he immediately contacts SHIELD to check on Tony.
'Yes. And Tony hasn't told him because he doesn't want Steve to feel like he's trapped into looking after a child with Tony that neither of them planned for.'
Well, he follows Steve’s orders. Or, possibly, he’s doing his own thing and it is pure coincidence that it coincides with what Steve wants. Steve worries about that far more than he probably should.
'My presence in the Mansion is limited, sir,' Jarvis replies. 'You have never been on site long enough to require full integration.'
‘Sure, Tony,’ Steve agrees reluctantly and steps into the corridor to speak to one of the agents posted as guards.
'I'm glad you're up,' Tony tells him as he fusses with the box. 'Come on, there are another eight boxes in the foyer.'
Steve cradles his face in both hands to catch him in a kiss. They drop to Tony's hips when they both need to gulp in more air.
'Rogers, you're making me self-conscious,' Tony pushes his half-eaten food away. 'Which is a very strange feeling for me.'
'Stay,' Tony grins at him and pulls free to reach the edge of the bed, 'this, my Captain, is lube and it is our friend.'
'Tony,' she interrupts, 'you work yourself to exhaustion at the best of times; if you're reliving a day then nobody will even notice how long you've been working.'
'Hey,' Steve looks suitably charmed when Pete runs over to give him a hug. 'Did you get your work done?'
'I don't know what you...' Steve cuts himself off with a heavy swallow as Tony presses his dampened finger behind his balls. A soft 'Oh' is all he offers.
'Yeah, well, you're biased; I'm one of the few people who knows about you,' Tony stands up and heads to his room.
Steve looks at the boy in his lap, brown hair and eyes, skin that's slightly darker than his own, a gaze that seems to be obtaining knowledge through pure force of will...
'You need a pick up?' Steve winces at each of her gasps, knowing she's digging metal from her own flesh.
'We have been working on a way for Jarvis to track me, and the other guy, in the event of my capture,' Bruce replies calmly, as if this is a common concern. 'Also the other guy tends to head off into the wilderness if he's upset and I wake up completely lost. If Jarvis and Tony can track me then they can come and find me.'
Thor was around, for once, but has since disappeared. Clint, Natasha and Bruce all came too after Tony promised they didn't have to dance or bring partners if they didn't want to. Steve seems to have slipped under the radar of the press and was pretty obviously Tony's plus one.
Tony bites a little harder than before and feels the bigger man tense against him before shuddering with his release. His grip around Tony tightens and the genius lets his head drop back against the shower wall as he eyes roll back; fuck, he's so close.
'He'll sleep in my room until my second guest room is converted,' Tony misses the point. 'That should be finished in a couple of days.'
'Jay, proof read and then release,' Tony stands up and sheds his jacket and tie. 'If there's nothing else, Ms Potts, I'm heading back to the workshop.'
'I'm not a pet,' Steve rolls his eyes at the screen even though he knows Tony can't see him. He sends a smiley face quickly afterwards incase Tony thinks he's upset.
'They're a little dramatically unsubtle for a couple of spies and a man who's been on the run for so many years,' Tony tells him with a grin.
‘Jarvis, full scan if you please,’ Tony backs up and clicks his fingers absentmindedly as blue lines start moving over Steve’s body.
'Shall we take your cars or your zoo animals with us?' Tony asks, noting the Steve seems to have managed to split those two into separate boxes.
He glances around the old style kitchen. Tony either had no say in the design of this room or has never been here in order to object to it.
‘Welcome, sir,’ Jarvis greets him. ‘There is ice at the bar or would you like me to activate the coffee machine?’
‘No,’ Steve retorts, ‘he’s completely against the idea. Steve Rogers thinks you deserve it today though.
‘Electric shock,’ Natasha is handling this surprisingly well considering what happened the last time this happened unexpectedly. ‘From the toaster.’
Pete grabs his blanket and holds up his arms to be picked up. Steve obliges him and has stepped out of his suite before he remembers he isn't wearing a shirt.
He tries to remember if he's actually seen Tony's son cry since he's been with them; he can only ever remember Tony's presence being enough to make Pete happy.
'Tony, thank God,' Steve sighs and then realises the implications of the video feed. 'Tony why have you taken off your helmet?'
Tony hums a vague agreement but grinds down again, making Steve tip his head back as he stifles a cry.
Can there be a more glorious sight than Captain America sprawled naked, and aroused, on your bed and gazing up at you?
Tony is massively dependant on his bots though, Steve reasons with himself. Socially, if nothing else, they are his main constants.
Tony eats a little before becoming distracted by something on his tablet. Pete doesn't seem to mind his father's distraction; he's chattering happily about his new toys.
'Your miniature car collection has been brought down to this floor,' Thor tells him. 'May I request that you show it to me?'
'I'm just thinking about what happens when the second baby is born,' Tony admits. 'If he actually looks like Steve I guess I just hope no one jumps to the right conclusion.'
The blonde nods again and this time his hands skitter back up Tony's spin. He watches the soldier take a gulping breath.
'I like it here,' Steve tells him as they watch Pete bump the car randomly into everything Steve owns. 'I've made friends now.'
'Thanks, Jay,' he steps out from the spray and stares at himself in the mirror. 'I may need a pep talk when Pete goes down for his nap.'
'Dada, I can't find my elephant,' Pete has obediently put a selection of toys into a brightly coloured box.
'We have a deal!' Tony sticks out a hand to shake on it. 'Jarvis make sure you let Cap in to cook for us tomorrow.'
'They have his surname,' Jarvis points out. 'Besides, I suspect sir intended to honour those whose names he gave to his children. And he is not a fan of the name Anthony.'
'Tony, please?' Steve steps up to the counter beside Tony as Jarvis returns the armour to its previous motionless state.
''Done' implies complete perfection and no future upgrades,' he tells him as he pours a beer. 'My work is never done.'
'Jarvis,' Pepper considers her words so she doesn't offend the AI, 'you're keeping an eye on Peter?'
'I swear this will never happen again,' Steve has one hell of a moping face. 'I'll never let go of his hand, I'll wear one of those bizarre headsets that you have or Jarvis can just come with us and...'
Down the corridor, turn left and the staircase is up ahead. He counts the doors and the raps on the sixth as he pushes it open,
He brushes some of Steve's hair off of his forehead and smiles, despite himself, as the man snuggles closer.
'That was Chinese,' Tony tells him. 'I think I butchered it a little, my pronunciation isn't the best.'
‘I am afraid not, sir,’ comes the disembodied voice. ‘If, in the future, you could avoid setting off explosions…’
'I don't like to be handed things,' Tony grits out to Clint who promptly drops the keys onto the counter.
'Thanks,' he smiles. Pete makes a sound that might mean the same, but he's taken a large bite of his apple. 'Don't talk with your mouth full,' he laughs as Alfred leaves them alone.
'No, this has nothing to do with me!' Tony argues. 'This is about me doing everything I can for my sons. If Steve ends up hating me that's fine, just as long as...'
I say 'may' because I haven't written it completely yet but I have a good idea how this -verse can fit the movie.
'Sir, the large batch of coffee that I took the liberty of preparing is ready,' Jarvis is a lifesaver.
'Tony, I'm so sorry. We only looked away for a moment...' he shakes his head. 'It's my fault. I'm sorry. Is he ok?'
‘Technology has come a long way,’ Tony doesn’t meet his eyes, ‘and it’s really my main vulnerability.’
'He already loves Pete!' Rhodey interrupts. 'The only one the room today keeping a closer eye on that child was Jarvis!'
He arrives at the entrance to the workshop only to find the massive metal shutter in place across the windows.
'Can't move it,' Tony replies. 'Half an hour on the clock. I'll disarm it but you guys need to get to a safe distance, this thing packs a punch.'
'We'd be a terrible match,' he points out as Rhodey enters the room. 'I told him so; we're from completely different times, we have completely different interests and if we break up, and break up badly, then we mess up the Avengers and... my kids.'
'He was dead for a while,' Tony adds quietly, 'and he was critical for longer, but he was stable before I returned to Malibu.'
'Project removing the arc reactor from my chest,' Tony tells him and then huffs a breath at the same time Steve heards a muffled thud; he guesses Tony's dropped onto his bed.
'It's fine,' he gives in and goes with his instincts, 'I understand why you don't. Let's just... Let's go from here.'
'Daaaaadaaaaaa...' Pete pats his back before crawling around a little. The small hands and fuzz covered knees aren't exactly comfortable against his bare back so it's something of a relief when Pete collapses across his shoulder blades so their heads are together. 'Dada?'
He can tell when Tony falls asleep; a previously unnoticed tension bleeds away first and then, as Tony shifts to press his nose against the sofa’s back, his legs straighten out and bump into Steve’s thigh.
‘Can’t that wait?’ Steve asks as another spray of sparks fly across the workshop from one of the automated workstations.
'Jarvis,' Steve closes the door to his suite behind him and leans against it, 'could you maybe just shoot me before I say anything like that to Tony?'
'I live every day hoping you don't come to your senses,' Tony says as he pulls an eager, naked, Captain America into the shower with him.
'He does,' he tells her, 'doesn't mean he wants one with me, though. And I will tell him. Definitely. Before Jim's sixth birthday or Jarvis'll do it for me and the fall out from that would be much worse.'
'I wasn't even sure you were awake,' Steve replies and glances away as Tony stretches his arms over his head.
'If he sticks around,' Tony continues after a moment, 'then they'll both know it was because he wanted to.'
'Oh, it's no problem, ma'a... Pepper,' he gets out the ingredients. 'Tony's great and Peter's amazing. I'm a little jealous really.'
Pepper seems to be constantly doing something. Mostly that something involves at least two computer tablets and probably a conversation through her headset. It can anything from a list groceries for JARVIS to a full blown six way video conference with Tony’s board of directors.
'I'm reading Reed's most recent thesis,' Tony rolls his shoulders. 'I need to get up to speed on this shit.'
'And he's going to move in with us?' Bruce asks carefully; Tony had admitted his suspicions of AIM having some of his DNA but they didn't discuss what would happen if they found a live child.
'Dummy and I searched,' Jarvis clarifies. 'You and Butterfingers concentrated on maintaining house security and monitoring any use of sir's finances.'
Tony’s noticeably forcing himself to stop touching the arc reactor where it’s bothering him. He’s broken into a sweat as a he starts to run a fever, which is worrying but not as worrying as when Steve notices that he’s bleeding.
Tony wraps one arm around Steve's shoulders as his other hand tangles into the soldier's hair. Steve kisses back enthusiastically and puts both his hands to Tony's lower back; he tugs him further up his lap.
'Sure,' Tony blags it and grabs his phone knowing Jarvis will bring up the answer without being asked, 'signed Avengers posters, one of my cars, a month's loan of my yacht and a prototype for the next StarkPhone with personal tech support for a year.'
I am English and in the UK; I have no idea if the place I have picked off of Google Maps for this chapter is actually appropriate. Feel free to correct me :-)
By tucking his head under Steve's chin he can access extremis unnoticed. Dummy greets him as he looks at his messages himself. Jarvis is right; even in his deleted messages there are none that match the two in question.
'Is that... an image of the arc reactor on the blanket?' Steve tries to get a better look without pulling it away from Pete.
Tony catches him with his left arm and pulls him back against the suit as the right gauntlet steadies them.
It’s then that Tony wanders in and beelines for the coffee machine; his path takes him right past the Hulk.
Steve knows there are tears running down his face and some very ridiculous part of his mind is reminding him that Tony doesn't do well with tears so he tugs the suit against him so he can sob into the armour's shoulder.
'Right,' Clint agrees as his hand hovers an inch from the bodywork. 'So, you're telling me that Stark is trusting us with two things he loves at once and that doesn't seem strange to you?'
'Alright,' Tony waves a hand, 'I keep the master room in the penthouse, Pepper has the guest suit, my third kid gets the second guest room, your kid gets the third, and Pete and Jim get your floor.'
Steve has come to realise that the relationship he has with Tony is so very close to being unhealthy.
'Yes, Captain Cautious,' Tony ignores the bullets that ping against his armour and continues to stare the data he's lifting from the AIM servers. 'Hulk, be a dear?'
'It's human nature, Cap,' he sees Tony's gaze slide to the bar for a moment before flicking to his son. 'They prod at what they think is the story. All the time I'm the poor spoilt rich boy, whose hero of a father just didn't have time for him, they don't think to ask about my mother.'
After Tony has eaten his fill, and Steve has eaten everything else, they move upstairs. Tony sits against the headboard and gets his reading back out even as he watches Steve getting ready for bed. Steve settles down beside him; his fingers just brushing Tony's leg.
'Steve, come on, it was an honest accident,' Clint puts a hand on his back. 'Kids get lost all the time.'
'You just told me the guy has a crush on you, that doesn't sound like someone whose first thought will be to take your son away from you,' Rhodey points out.
'Dada?' he blinks open his eyes to see Pete playing with light from the arc reactor between his fingers.
What would he have done? If he found a child that was his and Tony's; would he have told Tony immediately? He thinks he would have.
'No to both of those!' he can only imagine how badly those conversations would go. 'What do I say to him? Hey, you're more than good enough for me but don't take that as encouragement because I can't let anything happen between us.'
'Extremis,' Pepper snaps and away while fishing out her phone, 'Jarvis, explain,' she demands and slams her way through some double doors.
Steve buries his face in Tony's neck and wraps his arms around his waist. Tony arches up into him and their bodies are flush together. Steve clutches him a little tighter.
‘No! Absolutely not!’ Steve tells him. ‘It’s bad enough that you wouldn’t wait to have a medical professional set your shoulder but you’re not fighting again today. You shouldn’t fly either; you need to rest your arm.’
‘No, Captain. I do have enough feelers within SHIELD systems as to be able to summon them is necessary, however.’
‘Tony…’ Steve catches his elbow as the suit is reforming around him. ‘Please be safe. Please, Tony.’
'Which languages?' Steve asks, his Cap head is on now as he mentally adds this information to the list of the team's abilities.
'Additional strain to outer plating that would become disastrous at high altitudes,' Jarvis deadpans.
'I'm a billionaire with a support structure, such as it is, outside of the team,' Tony grins self-depreciatingly. 'Cap only has the team and still occasionally freaks out over the price of takeout.'
'Howard owned the rights to you and he passed them to me,' Tony wrinkles his nose. 'I can sign them over?'
Later, after they've eaten, Tony returns to his workshop with Rhodey and his son. He puts Pete down to nap and walks back over to where his friend is waiting.
His feels himself slump to the side as oxygen deprivation finally catches up with him. He doesn't fall far; Steve supports him even as he makes a wounded noise in his throat.
'Isn't worth the possibility of a happy, lasting, romantic relationship with the father of your son?'
Well, he wants more than to be best friends, but he's shoving that small rebellious thought into the back of his mind.
'He was at the AIM compound,' Steve reports with a slight scowl towards the Director. 'He's in my custody right now.'
'We found that AIM manipulated some of your cells to act as...' Tony falters as Steve flinches and crosses his arms across his chest, 'to act as eggs. They injected my DNA.'
'I bet!' her smile becomes more teasing. 'The press conference was something of a surprise, by the way.'
'Don't,' Tony dismisses. 'This is all my fault. I assumed things about... It's my fault and nothing you did.'
'Well?' Tony knows patience isn't his strongest suit. He stretches as he stands up from the couch where he's put his son down to sleep using his tailored suit jacket as a blanket. In a practiced move he dodges around Dummy to get to where Bruce is studying the data from the AIM servers.
Tony scowls as he eats his toast and thinks about what he read on theoretical time travel the day before,
'Hello, Peter,' Jarvis greets him and the lights turn up. 'You are in the guest room on the communal floor. Prince Thor and Agent Barton are just outside, shall I notify them?'
'Or a clone of someone else,' Tony shrugs. 'We don't know for sure that they don't have anyone one else's DNA. That's where you come in.'
'It's not exactly perfect for either of us,' he tries, 'but I thought we were friends, Tony. If we're nothing else we're teammates; we're Avengers,' he pauses as he gages Tony's response, 'I just want you to believe that I want to be involved.'
‘Jarvis,’ Tony’s voice from the doorway makes Steve jolt violently to his feet, ‘did the good Captain just graduate from Mr. Rogers to Captain to sir all in one conversation?’
'Alright,' Steve smiles and pours three pancakes onto the frying pan. 'They're nearly ready; take your milk to the table.'
'Try not to thrust too hard,' Tony pulls down his briefs and presses another kiss to his cock, 'you're a lot stronger than me.'
'It's a little tight at the moment,' he types obediently, 'I wish you were here to help me with it.'
He finally makes his way back up the drive in the dark. There are a few rooms lit up downstairs but the rest of the house is dark. Lights turn on on the steps up to the front door as he approaches and he can hear Tony's music from somewhere deeper into the Mansion.
'I think I've been spending too much time with Tony,' he settles for something that is probably true.
'Alright,' he laughs and presses the buttons he's memorised to mean a simple white coffee with one sugar.
Steve takes the scoldings with an ‘aww shucks’ (Tony’s description) expression on his face but standing straight and tall. Tony smirks, deflects and dodges before escaping back to his bots.
It should be noted that Tony is pretty much the only person except Betty Ross that doesn’t react negatively, at all, to the presence of Hulk.
Steve tries not to sigh audibly and then freezes when he sees the blank look is back on Tony's face,
'Exactly,' Tony agrees. 'Pete, wipe that down so Jarvis can get an accurate scan. I'm going to get Rhodey a drink.'
If he's going to think this thing with Tony through logically then he can't let himself be distracted by his gifts.
Steve cries out as he arches up; that was a little too close to pain so Tony dials it back for a minute. When Steve's relaxed into the sensation he probes deeper and hits pay dirt.
The next thing he knows he's sitting up, with Tony in his lap, kissing passionately. Tony's arms are around his neck and Steve's fingers are digging into the genius' back.
‘Because I don’t trust hospitals,’ he presses a kiss to Steve’s lips, ‘but I realised that I trust the four of you to keep me safe.’
'Great, thanks Jay,' Tony claps his hands together and moves to the table. 'Come on, squirt,' he helps Pete into his chair as Steve fetches the pizza boxes.
‘Oh, thank you,’ Steve scrubs a hand across his face and glances at the clock. ‘Four in the morning? Darn it, Tony…’
'Of course,' Pepper looks back to her tablet. 'That'll make the table the four of us, Bruce and Jan.'
'It's not my fault that I don't trust you,' he replies quietly and walks the remaining distance to the lift.
'I do not know, sir. Captain Rogers wants a family and he is attracted to you. You have a son together. It is not difficult to see how this might end perfectly.'
Clint and Natasha have settled into the pilot's and co-pilot's seats respectively and closed the door between them and the back compartment. Tony has removed the rest of the suit and coaxed Steve into taking off his cowl and gloves. Steve lies down on one of the bench seats, Tony somehow wedges himself in beside him and wraps an arm around his waist. Steve hugs him close and concentrates on listening to him breathing in and out.
'You are staying with me,' Tony tells him. 'Look, Pepper got us a Pete sized chair! When did this arrive?'
It takes Tony hours to make his way through Richards' paper and is left knowing he's going to have to read it again to make sure he actually understood it. He groans aloud and stretches as he looks around the room.
'This is Stark tech,' Tony just smirks, 'and Jarvis can keep them private; how do you think they work in the field?'
'I suspected Captain Rogers would not mind if Peter used some of his paper,' Jarvis says by way of explanation.
Tony just smiles and pets Steve's hair when the blonde pulls back from the kiss looking a little flushed.
‘No,’ he shakes his head. ‘I can’t expect you to stay. I was just going to say I’ll miss you.’ Steve hates that that is the best he could come up with.
'He's my son,' Tony declares as he strides into the room looking like he just stepped out of a high rollers' casino.
‘Yes,’ Steve isn’t going to pretend to himself that Tony’s bots haven’t been the only true constants in his life and probably the most reliable as well. ‘But you have other friends now too, Tony.’
‘Fuck me, Stark has some balls,’ Clint sums up the proceedings as Hulk vanishes up Tony’s private stairs.
While they eat they talk about what they did during the day. Steve, perfect specimen that he is, sits with rapt attention as Pete tells him all about using a real screwdriver to screw real screws into a scrap of wood in the workshop.
‘Not a lot,’ Tony dismisses but looks a little pleased with Steve’s concern. ‘If I can neutralise it I’ll need a new reactor casing already, as well as the reactor itself. If it takes me too long then it will start to corrode the reactor itself and then I’m dead.’
He sighs and glances to where Pete is now asleep in the crook of his left arm and to where Tony is pressed against his right.
‘Stark’s a billionaire,’ Clint just shrugs. ‘I’m surprised he hasn’t swanned off more often to be honest.’
'Yes,' Pepper points at him, 'he lost everyone he knew and now you're going to keep his son from him.'
He ushers him onto the lift after grabbing his blanket and then leads the way into the communal lounge.
They chat until another young lady comes to claim a dance from the great Tony Stark and steals his drink, which she gives to Steve, as she loops her arm through Tony’s. Steve watches Tony show off for a few songs before he passes the lady on and returns to Steve’s side.
'That's great!' Tony's still grinning. 'Cap, Pete, you can finally meet my other best friend and the guy that should definitely be your favourite uncle.'
Jarvis directs him back to the ballroom and he steps into the room to see Tony's already dropping down to meet him.
He parks the bike right by the main double doors and gets off to untie his bag. The doors open as he starts up the steps and a man in a suit looks down at him.
'I built things,' Tony shrugs. 'Basic machines, small weapons powered with elastic bands... I don't know.'
'Alright,' Tony shrugs, 'but I'll give you fair warning; Pete hogs the sheets and wakes up at a horrifyingly early time in the morning.'
'Sir, Ms Potts is suggesting you prepare yourself for your meeting,' Jarvis announces as Steve re-enters his living room with their drinks.
'Rhodey only chose me three names and I might need four,' Tony tells him simply as he puts his son onto the seat beside him next to the window. He holds onto the boy's arm as the jet lauches off the side of the helicarrier and then lets him scramble away to look out the window.
'I'll remember you said that the next time I fancy company on my morning jog,' Steve shoots back as he leads the way back down the hall.
'Doesn't count,' Tony tells him again. 'You can't loose your virginity over the phone, Steve. We couldn't even
'Iron Man told him to come,' Steve admits as he watches Hulk wander around the large room as if he's patrolling.
By hooking one leg around the chair Tony finds enough leverage to grind down and is rewarded by Steve groaning and bucking up against him.
Dummy has rolled over slowly and peers over Tony's shoulder where he's kneeling down. Pete gazes at the bot and then offers him the plastic elephant.
He crashes his lips to Steve's and wraps his arms tight around his neck. Steve responds to the kiss beautifully but he feels his hands flail for a moment before settling on his back.
Clint and Bruce have both said good night and left so Steve has turned off the television and asked Jarvis to play some music. He doesn’t need to ask the AI to play it quietly; Jarvis is perfectly aware of the desire not to wake Tony.
'Yes,' she replies simply. 'I also had all of the clothes you bought stored in the third guest room for now and adjusted your schedule to skip the meeting in DC tomorrow.'
'I know how long this will take,' Tony keeps working. 'And to finish off I will have to use some of that last minute.'
As soon as they’ve once again bored Loki enough that he retreats back to wherever the hell it is that he is when he isn’t bothering them, they turn to check on Tony. Jarvis has, of course, already told them that physically Tony seems fine.
Steve freezes at the sight of Tony’s chest. He’s seen his teammate shirtless before, hell, it’s Tony, he’s seen him fully naked before, but he’s never looked like this. There’s bloody oozing from around the hole where the arc should be and the casing wall looks pitted and corroded.
'Yeah, that's nothing,' he tells the sofa cushion. 'Ask Pepper; I've made it to fifty before and still been lucid.'
Steve takes the blanket only after Tony pokes it into his chest insistently. Tony backs away several paces and watches him carefully. Steve stares at his own hands as he clenches the blanket tightly.
'Ladies and gentlemen of the press,' Tony quirks an eyebrow, 'I give you Captain America,' there are flashes from their cameras. 'Super strong, tactical genius, all round good guy and,' he makes sure he's grinning at Steve, 'apparently not a great babysitter.'
An hour later Steve is watching in mixture of amusement and faint horror as the two Starks pull apart one of the brand new, very expensive looking, six-wheeled remote controlled cars and gaze at the inner circuitry. That this is happening on his living room rug makes it all the more surreal.
‘Alright, no medical,’ Steve agrees reluctantly with the closest thing to a medic they have on the team; he’s mostly just glad Tony hasn’t taken off.
'I can't tell if you haven't quite noticed that we aren't in bed or if that is actually turning you on.'
They play with the cars for a while; Pete makes up an elaborate scenario where Clint's car is trapped upside down under the couch and it's up to the rest of them to save him. Pete is, naturally, the only one allowed to have more than one car, but Steve is given the privilege of using his second favourite.
Steve tries not to let his gazes drop first on the strip of skin revealed when Tony's top rides up and then to his arse. He isn't very successful.
'Hey kid,' Clint comes to stand beside Natasha. 'How's being the first born son of an over generous billionaire treating you?'
'Yeah yeah...' Tony tows Steve into his private residence and pushes him over into a sofa before straddling his thighs.
SHIELD has tracked some bomb makers to a remote canyon, which is great but they've since found it must have been leaked information. They've walked into an ambush and the leaders of the group, who have since fled, have sent them a message saying there is a bomb ticking down nearby.
'Tony is never going to trust me with his sons ever again,' he isn't really listening. He finds a bench against the wall and sits down with his face in his hands.
Steve closes his eyes briefly as what feels like a roll of energy washes over him. His hips jerk as he moans,
'You still hungry, squirt?' he asks the boy as he traces a finger over the glowing outline of the arc reactor through his shirt.
He watches as the little boy curls up beside him before suddenly looking up at him with Tony's eyes,
He was going to ignore it and leave it where it was, but then he realised he was just being spiteful and, if nothing else, he needs to treat such a valuable piece of art history better than that.
'A pretty exclusive event! I hear our readers can get involved in the fun at home by bidding on an online auction of items donated by various guests; did you donate anything?'
‘Work work work, that’s me. Then play, normally,’ he smirks suddenly, though the expression isn’t up his normal standards, ‘all work and no play makes Tony a dull boy.’
‘I didn’t really have anywhere else to go,’ he states bluntly, refusing to back away from meeting Tony’s gaze as he admits it.
'Nature verses nurture,' Tony's expression ignites with his anger before collapsing back with a sigh. 'They couldn't be sure what made me into me so they kept everything as close to the same as they could.'
'Oh,' Pete looks confused before lying down on Tony's chest so that his cheek presses against the glass of the arc reactor.
Tony was always willing to trust him with the children, but not with the knowledge that Jim was his, so actually...
'Where will he stay?' Steve doesn't really want to have to point out to Tony that his penthouse isn't exactly child proof.
‘I said get out,’ Tony repeats with a snarl. ‘You can’t just… It’s disrespectful, alright? That’s a thing they had in the 40s right?’
'He's Bruce's butler,' Tony nods. 'Jarvis is jealous that his job has been stolen and that my kid's affections are being appropriated.'
'Coffee is important for brain function in grown ups,' Clint tells him. 'Especially in the mornings.'
‘I don’t like being handed things,’ Tony informs him casually. His hands are pressed to his thighs as he peers closer at the phone.
'I bet I could make a lead that you couldn't break,' Tony's got the expression on his face that means he's thought up something very clever. 'I'm asking Jarvis to take a photo of you right now because I know you're blushing.'
The expression that crosses Tony’s face then isn’t one he recognises but looks a little calculating.
'I have no idea,' Steve agrees. 'But nothing's been blown up so...' he shrugs even though they can't see it.
When Tony wakes up he makes his way automatically to the nearest coffee machine. He doesn't really notice that he's in his workshop until he's most of his way through a third mug of coffee. He looks around blearily.
Tony’s repairing his armour when Steve gets back from debriefing. There is a large ice pack on his shoulder as well as a brace, which makes Steve feel better.
Tony is increasingly out of it but still flinches from each of the people that prod at him. Steve convinces him, or possibly Jarvis, to remove the suit so the medics can do their work and stays by his side. Tony catches at his hand again as soon as the gauntlet has retracted; Steve laces their fingers together and holds tightly.
'Of course,' Steve tells him. 'Whenever you want just call and I'll bring it down to your workshop. '
'You got him dressed alright?' Tony asks as he swallows down some more coffee. He nods vaguely to where his son is clearly not dressed in the pyjamas Tony put him to bed in.
‘Jarvis, who do you report to?’ he asks one afternoon when not talking to anyone for a couple of days has heightened his paranoia.
He really needs to move these damn muffins or even with his incredible metabolism he's going to get fat.
'Two and a half months if we're going to believe this convenient countdown,' Bruce gestures to the screen. 'I'll read the rest of their notes to be sure.'
‘Tell him, I’m sorry, ok? Tell him whatever it was I said that upset him; I’m sorry. Tell him that he needs to come out and eat something, please? And tell me what he says, please.’
There's no response initially; Tony is operating on autopilot as he continues to work on something on his tablet. He drinks some of his coffee and finally looks up and around.
Steve knows he always finds it incredibly awkward when he finds that someone he isn’t interested in is attracted to him and he’s sure Tony has plenty of experience of the same.
'Wait,' Tony pulls back a little further, 'did you say 'more crazy than we already knew'? That's... that's... Cap, you're supposed to be on my side!'
'Hey,' Tony offers a smile as Steve abandons whatever he was reading and crosses the room in three quick strides to wrap him in a hug.
‘You know I’m out of the weapons business, right?’ Tony abandons watching the TV with the others and carries the gun to the bar.
