“I was never in any real danger, John,” Sherlock said.  He turned his attention to the small plates of dim sum scattered between them.  Egg roll or

hadn’t needed to know about her attending physician’s scritching and fur pile fetish – nearly found them both tossed out, but Jo managed to talk down both the consulting detective and security, so Sherlock was allowed to stay; strop in full force.
The scotch is smooth, but it just makes things worse.  I think I understand why you turned to cocaine.  Stimulant versus depressant.  Makes sense.
of you had done, there would have been a lot less pain all ‘round these last several days, and I wouldn’t be in the position to try to fix this bloody awful mess.  I don’t expect Sherlock to understand the situation; he’s ignorant of the conversations we’ve had in the past, but
Given the frustration Sherlock had exhibited since leaving the tramway tunnel, John was not prepared for the gentle manner in which he unbuttoned first the long row of buttons down the center of John’s chest and then the ones at the cuffs, carefully avoiding the abrasions that marred John’s wrists from the rough ropes that had been used to bind him.
This chapter takes place immediately after the events of "The Great Game" (or the first five minutes of "A Scandal in Belgravia"; however you choose to think of it). Enjoy!!
“She’s your best friend, for Christ’s sake! Your flat mate! You can’t just not show up,” Lestrade bellowed.  Sherlock ignored the double negative.  “The least you could do is wish her a sodding Happy Birthday.”
Upon further reflection, shooting at the wall while thoroughly pissed on scotch – or any hard liquor, for that matter – is

John said little once the incident was over, choosing to instead soothe both Mary and Sherlock with cups of whiskey-fortified tea and polite conversation.  However, once Sherlock was sacked out on the lilo in the study, and Mary was curled up in their bed reading, John excused himself for a walk though it was late.  “Just a quick stroll to clear my head, love,” he told her with a kiss to her temple, and he left.
“Are you going to take off that shirt or not?” Sherlock demanded as he pulled up a chair and sat in front of John.
conversation shouldn’t be held at a crime scene of all places, but there seemed to be nothing for it.
Joanna Watson hadn’t changed at all in two years and yet nothing about her was the same.  Her deep blue eyes, still welcoming, no longer sparkled as they had done. The curve of her lips – Sherlock pushed back the memory of their gentle softness – didn’t smile as broadly as he remembered.  Her hair was longer, well past her shoulders now, rather becoming save that the wheat blonde locks were streaked heavily with silver.  The wrinkles at the corners of her eyes had grown deeper, no longer shaped from the mirth of a playfully sarcastic yet brutally honest heart but with the heavy burdens of a warrior for whom the battle had never ended. She was beautiful but exhaustion rested on her every feature.
This chapter came together a little bit faster than I anticipated, so I hope you all think it's up to snuff.
“Don’t even bother, Sherlock,” Joanna had said, gesturing at his concealed hand.  “You know my opinions.  Do what you want tonight.”
Haven’t had Chinese since you and I found that new little dim sum place down in Chelsea last month.  Didn’t think we could find an egg roll to top the ones here in Baker Street, but we did.  That was a good night.  On a case for three days.   Exhausted, but you ate. I was always so grateful to see you eat. You told me about Victor. Thank you for that. It wasn’t easy for you – sentiment, after all – but I don’t think I’ve ever felt as connected to you as I did at that moment.
Their case had been the murder of Miss Eve Calhoon, executive assistant to the Vice President of Aerospace Development at Exosphere Solutions, who had been found naked and bludgeoned to death on the company testing grounds outside Caversham.  Her killer – the company’s chief of security who had been quickly apprehended – had been paid a handsome sum by the CEO to silence the woman before she could give evidence to Scotland Yard about acts of industrial espionage and corporate embezzlement that had had been orchestrated by the CEO, Nicholas Helton, to remove rivals bidding on several lucrative military contracts.   The case was a four at best; even Joanna had found it a bit predictable.  Of course Helton ran, and of course Sherlock and Joanna had given chase. They managed to corner him in the aerodynamics lab, but just as they were about to catch him, he ducked into the wind tunnel in a pointless attempt to elude them, activating the system in the process.
Oh, don’t give me that!  Yes, I know that the universe is rarely so lazy – you’ve said that before – but
Joanna snorted her derision and smiled, but it was not a smile of appreciation or good humour.  It was tight, strained, and didn’t reach her eyes which were now cold and emotionless.  It was the smile she wore while trying to decide whether to punch or shoot her enemy first.
Though he detested theorizing until all the data was available to him, Sherlock knew that Joanna would always be a source of endless data.  Therefore, Sherlock was left with the following conclusions:
“Looks like you’ve been busy,” Joanna said as she reached the door to their flat.  She gestured at the mess of papers that lay scattered on every available surface in the sitting room, dropped her rucksack on the floor by the sofa, and hooked her coat on its peg.  “Caught a new case, then? Hot or cold?”
As Sherlock worked, the open collar of his silk shirt shifted and John noticed the dark bruises and swelling coming up around Sherlock’s neck where Soo Lin’s brother had nearly strangled him with the silk sash.  “You’ll want to put some ice those soon,” John said, indicating the welts.  “And take some paracetamol.”
Sherlock shifted in his chair, sipped his wine, and looked everywhere but at the strangely neutral expression on Joanna’s face. The mould experiment on top of the casement of the kitchen window seemed to be progressing.  He wondered if the ones he had stashed down in 221C were faring as well.
An ancient yet familiar rumbling from within the wall pulled Sherlock’s attention back to the present.  The boiler had decided to surrender its treasure.  Pushing thoughts of “what could have happened” to the back of his mind – utterly pointless they were, really – Sherlock took up the ceramic bowl he had brought in from the kitchen.  He had his blogger to patch up.
The others are sitting on the larger sofa, leaving the smaller armchair open for Sherlock to fling himself into. Anton is using a credit card to portion out little lines of cocaine on the table while his wife snorts it using a plastic straw. Mihael is absently playing with the hem of his girlfriend’s dress. She looks distinctly uncomfortable, perched on the arm of the sofa with one of his big, meaty arms flung around her waist. The strap of her dress hangs off one skinny shoulder.
John has moved away from the window and come to stand behind the brothers. His hands are in his pockets, broad shoulders hunched forward in a posture of casual strength. He’s got that crooked little smile on his face. So heartbreakingly familiar even after all this time.
He clutches the mobile hard enough to dig deep grooves into the palm of his hand before he systematically dismantles it and throws it in the garbage. He turns the television down but not off before he leaves, and wishes fervently for a collared coat to cover his shoulders as waits for Mycroft’s men to pick him up and take him to the rendezvous in Kostinbrod.
“I will give you this because I am generous,” Mihael is saying. Sherlock looks up just in time to see Yana, towering on skinny legs and six-inch heels like a newborn foal. Mihael shoves her in the back and she stumbles forward, barely missing the table and landing with a hard thump in Sherlock’s lap. His arms come up reflexively, to shove her away or hold her he isn’t immediately sure. Her head is close enough that he must crane his neck down to look at her. Her eyes are squeezed shut.
“Good. Once you do so, she will ask you some questions. Tell her everything. Tell her what you’ve done, tell her where you are, and tell her that a man who speaks good but not perfect Bulgarian gave you this number and said that she would help you.” He pauses. “She
Sherlock is more shocked by this than he ought to be, seeing as its his hallucination that’s asked him the question. He scoffs.
"You're very handsome," the boy says. He hasn't touched John once since they came into the room. Smart thing, waiting to see what John's intentions are before he commits himself to anything. He stamps out his cigarette and throws it on the grimy hotel carpet. It's a testament to how filthy the room is that you can't even tell. "Usually I don't get so lucky." Of that, John has no doubt. "My mates are going to be jealous."
“Excellent,” Mycroft says, his tone like a cat who is waking from a languid nap in the sun. “I’ll alert the local extraction team. Where can they pick you up?”
John jerks, pushes his hand down, watching the pale back descend with every press, the knobs of the boy's spine standing out in sharp relief. Everything sounds wet. He pushes harder, lifts his hips higher, teeth clamping and feet straining. He's being pulled apart from the inside out, a soldier reduced to a quivering, pathetic, desperate mess only the way pale pretty boys with incomprehensible eyes are able.
“You’re not here,” he says. He closes his eyes tightly because it hurts to admit something so fundamentally true.
“Do you think she can do this?” John asks. He’s been silent this whole time, a static figure in the corner of the room.
Bulgaria in the summer. 23 degrees; pine trees case their shadows on sun dappled, sprawling lawns in Yuzhen park. Birds sing their songs, melodies eclipsed by the always present undercurrent of far off traffic.
He will not tell her that he understands why she wants to do this. Such a statement would be exceedingly pedestrian and unnecessarily sentimental. The kind of thing John might do, like he wants to sit with people who come to their flat, to pat the hands and offer tea to those who tell their sad stories whilst Sherlock sits there gnashing his teeth and resisting the urge to bite his nails and urging them like thunder to get to the bloody
John seems to find this quite funny for some reason. He snickers. “Well done, you. The great master of disguise caught out by a teenager.”
Of course, as is always the case where John is concerned, merely considering the possibility of interpreting the data in a different way leads to a surprising result. Thoughts begin to surface like gossamer threads appearing out of thin air, drawing conclusions faster than he can voice them aloud.
Though he never asked, Sherlock always suspected that John is intimately familiar with this particular brand of helpless rage. The kind that suffuses one’s whole being with a strength that might allow them to float high above their enemies and smite them. But then, of course, the cruel reminders of reality sets in.
Like any good application of science and logic, it was about the cause and effect of materials in certain doses. Medicine. Just the right amount and it makes all the difference.
“I think you might be bitter,” Anton’s wife says matter-of-factly in a nasally sort of voice. Her eyes are so red their natural brown is barely visible. “No money? No girlfriend? Not even a
“As I said, John, she’s frightened.” Thin arms wrapped around her chest, head bowed, legs crossed tight. When he turned his head towards her, she flinched slightly. Her breathing has gone shallow.
He is all at once so exhausted he can hardly keep his eyes open and terrified of closing them, afraid that if he does he may never wake up. This is the matter, one of many, that his brother and all the rest could never get through limited little minds: not all substances are created equal. Hypocrites, the lot of them. So eager to sit and sip their Glenlivt out of crystal glasses whilst presuming to lecture Sherlock on the merits of sobriety
“Christ, he’ll kill her,” John says. He rubs a hand wearily over his face. “He outweighs her by a good three stone at least. She’ll never be able to take him head-on and get away with it.”
“As a child your hands would be small enough to hold a spanner in hard to reach places. Your wrists bear the faint but distinct marking of chemical burns. You see there is a distinct difference to the effect that battery acid will have on skin, I once wrote an entire…”
Sherlock fishes his current throw-away mobile from his pocket and dials another number from memory. There is a few seconds of ringing – he rolls his eyes – before it’s answered.
that if John had somehow, for some reason left London that he would know it. This is just a trick. An error in software brought about by the truly terrible quality of cocaine. The synapses firing in his brain, increases in dopamine have activated his rewards center
The television is still blaring in the sitting room. The first thing he sees is Mihael’s back and upper shoulders, head slumped in a posture of rest. At first glance he looks asleep. Standing in front of him though, Sherlock sees that his entire front is drenched in blood. His head hangs heavily against this chest. There’s a trail of blood that’s made its way down his arm and is dripping onto the floor.
The man standing on the pavement takes a deep drag of his cigarette. His dark hair hangs in long, limp curls around his face; his beard is rough and unkempt, and his thin, lean body has the look of a rangy wild panther. He is underfed and under-slept, riding the last vestiges of a cocaine high of quite poor quality. He has until today’s sun goes down to somehow acquire the memory stick - kept currently on the person of the youngest brother - leave it in a dead-drop location all the way in Kostinbrod, pick up a new file, a new lead, and begin the process all over again.
“In an hour or so when Anton is finished…finished, with his wife, he and Mihael will get into an argument about football and Anton will leave. Mihael is high and in a foul temper so he will stay here. He’ll be wanting to take it out on someone and will consider getting up and coming in here to find you, but will at that point succumb to the exhaustion and massive amount of cocaine and alcohol in his system. It takes the average man hours to come down from a cocaine high. Mihael is larger than average and has a high tolerance, but he is pre-diabetic and hasn’t eaten anything of substance at all today. He’ll turn on the television and fall asleep.”
Mihael makes no response. His mood changes itself in his eyes, the way they become full of hatred and anger.
“You are good friend to us, Stefan, these many months. You are loyal. You are quiet. You do not cause trouble.”
Sherlock runs is fingers through his hair – greasy, needs a wash – his knees jittering up and down, up and down, as he tries to
“She’s clearly terrified.” And who could blame her? Trapped in a room with a stranger, put there by a man who abuses her.
“Be serious, John. I realize that you yourself cannot pass up the opportunity to sleep with every woman who presents herself, but some of us are beyond such primitive urges.”
it’s the weather, lends itself to short sleeves, his Belstaff would look ridiculous here, everyone wears polo shirts
He is reminded suddenly of a tiny dog; a small, trembling creature who is constantly shivering, afraid of everything larger than its own shadow.
Privately, though probably not as much as humility should allow, Sherlock savors her shocked expression. John is wearing that simultaneously pained-and-impressed look he never tires of. He feels buoyed by it and takes pity on her.
Sherlock considers. The cocaine is still swimming in his blood, but it feels less like a bad fog than before. Not quite the bloody footprints-on-the-floor level of clarity he was hoping for, but at least he has a plan of action now. Something approaching it at any rate.
They wait for what feels like forever, Yana and Sherlock sitting side by side on the gaudy quilt while the sun sinks ever lower on the horizon. Sherlock is a tall man but not a large one, especially after almost a year on the run, and the drug haze has almost receded entirely by the time they hear raised voices from the sitting room, followed not long thereafter by the sound of the door slamming. Something heavy crashes into the wall – a thrown beer bottle, most likely – and then the television clicks on at an alarmingly loud volume.
Sherlock looks up reflexively. He primed himself early to respond to his alias, trained himself like a dog at the dinner bell to avoid arousing suspicion.
John grunts, twitches, tries to warn. It's almost uncomfortable, the way his hips dig into the edge of the bed. His eyes are half-lidded in pleasure, shoulders hunching forward while his hand presses down, faster and faster, wetter and wetter, the little nose puffing short breaths against his belly, and god, he hadn't even noticed the freckles -
Tears start to gather in the corner of his eyes because he can’t feel it. John’s hand is on his arm, and he can’t feel it.
There’s no way for him to read into that, so Sherlock won’t. He won’t. He’ll lie here and wait for the plan to come to fruition because it will. He knows that for a fact, and yet there is not the usual sense of satisfaction that comes along with it. He was never any good without an audience, and if he is being honest with himself, he’s never been at his best than when he was playing for an audience of one.
One of these brothers is also in possession of a memory stick containing the only available CCTV footage showing the broad-daylight assassination of an anti-corruption politician. The killer is a gun-for-hire, one of many flies tangled in the web of a particularly nasty spider, dancing to a tune plucked nearly two-thousand miles away. Unless the killer is identified, he is set to assassinate another politician within 48 hours. Such an event would serve to set back years of progress in cleaning up the corrupt Bulgarian government, paving the way for further regional destabilization.
He lies on his back and stares at the ceiling for another fifteen minutes or so. Then he hears a small sound from beyond the door and knows its time to go. He forcefully rubs his forehead and lets out a long, slow breath.
Sherlock says nothing. He flings himself dramatically onto the bed. Yana startles but does not otherwise move. It’s another minute before he realizes that she is shaking.
is settled on his leg. His fingers are tapping a relentless beat. Tension, anxiety, the drugs, too many possibilities. But his gaze. It is boring into Sherlock. Mihael’s girlfriend (her name, what was her name? Sherlock doesn’t remember though he’s sure he was told, judged it irrelevant at the time) is looking off into the distance with a vacant expression. There are big, dark bruises on the insides of her thighs.
He complies. He watches the scene unfold in a detached sort of way. His arm, pale and skinny, sores pronounced more now than they have been in quite a while
safehouse and stay with them while they wait for a trusted SIC contact to come and retrieve the footage. The waiting has been like the long, slow diminuendo of a symphony; his hands practically ache from tuning the strings, and anticipation has curled itself a ball in his belly and set his nerves aflame. His fingers itch, tensing as they near the crescendo: the final violent, climactic, loud finale.
Mihael is staring at him. He mirrors Sherlock’s languid sprawl, knees spread wide, one hand balanced on his knee. The hand that isn’t wrapped around his girlfriend’s waist - wrapped, wrapped, more like trapped, the fabric in bunched, his grip is hard to keep her there
The boy massages John through his trousers. "Do you want to know my name?" he asks. It fills John with fear, suddenly, and he almost lashes out, almost grabs this pretty little thing between his legs and shakes it. But he gets himself under control, gets himself back to the hazy in-between where this is both what it is and what it isn't.
Inside the bedroom is just as nondescript and modern-cliché bland as the sitting room. The lack of furnishings puts all the attention on the bed, which is made up with a garish red quilt. It has the vibe of an action sequence about to unfold, blood sacrifice on an altar.
Ah, John. My John. Even in my mind and a thousand miles away you insist on appealing to my emotional intellect.
Snaps. Fists his hand around the top of that head (and that's why the hair is so short, so no one can really grab onto it), and thrusts up. The boy chokes, and immediately John makes to pull away, an apology on his tongue, but the eyes hold him fast, watery and red. The eyes say yes while the mouth is stretched wide, shiny with spit and...and..and it's a good thing this is all okay because John isn't sure he could stop, otherwise.
She won’t. Sherlock can tell that much by how she is reacting. Another man might feel quite differently in the face of a young woman in such a terrible position, but Sherlock has always thought that pity is possibly the most useless of emotions. He always rather favored action.
have all coalesced to show him John standing behind the large sofa and peering out the window. He is wearing jeans and that terrible cream jumper that washes out his complexion, that reduces the deep blue ocean depths of his eyes to shallow pools. Surface John, carboard cutout John, so one-dimensional.
He swallows tightly and turns his head to the side. Yana, obviously. The only other person who is in this room for real.
One of Mycroft’s minions, undercover, a set-up of a bad job of dealing counterfeit RPK-74M’s, meant to establish his cover. Fake bullet, fake blood pack, fake drugs, fake fake fake fake –
And god bless him, the boy actually looks disappointed. He checks the money in his pocket and grabs his smokes. At the door he looks back and John is struck dumb for a moment at the sight, an image like a black and white photograph from a past that never existed, a context that never fit. "Well, if you change your mind, you know where to find me."
This is technically Mihael’s apartment, one of many he has stashed all over Sofia, and like the man himself it is all about taste with little care for substance. There are large modern art prints hanging on the walls of the sitting room, incomprehensible swirls of colour; two leather sofas; laminate countertops and dark panelled wooden cabinets that give the place a very catalogue feel. Only a few of rooms see any action on the regular: the kitchen sees the leas, the sitting room the most. A little round table is the central fixture – flattened treads from a habitual walking path, the cleaning lady doesn’t even move it when she vacuums, you can tell by the indents under the feet, they’re worn into the carpet. The leather sofas are expensive and collapsible, meant to be easy to add and remove for company, however the extra seat is rarely used, is usually stored in one of the two bedrooms unless there’s company present, which there never is. Only one of largest of the bedrooms has an actual bed, though it’s rarely used for sleeping.
“I don’t ask for reward,” Sherlock says. The Bulgarian feels unwieldy on his tongue, all harsh consonants, like trying to chew pointy-edged crisps with a dry mouth and no water. “I only ask for opportunity to prove myself.”
ordinary. Sherlock found everything about the animal so endearingly odd: his round eyes circled by concentric white and black rims, his very short legs, his low and widely set ears and his unusually short claws. Just priceless, he thought. If he'd believed in God, he would have thought that God had created the manul to boost every other animal's self-esteem. Or maybe so people like Sherlock, so practical and who never bothered with plushy toys, would finally understand their appeal. For some unfathomable reason he loved the flattened face and shorter jaw, which had fewer teeth than any other cat's – it was all so
Sherlock had been befuddled at first, then somewhat touched. Then he had remembered the previous Christmas they'd shared and wondered if Molly would ever give up. She'd had a boyfriend or two this year, but it had never become serious. In any case, Sherlock was to spend the evening and the night with John, so he had to decline. He realized now his tone must have been
Once John had emptied his stomach – which didn't take long, even though to Sherlock it never seemed to end – the doctor stood, rinsed his mouth many times, washed his face, and finally began to breathe evenly again. Sherlock just knelt there, knocked out by the realization that obviously, it was his touch that had made John feel sick.
He has a flashback of Mycroft's tall and proud figure standing in the doorway and leaving quietly. For once, he wishes his sister was more like Holmes the elder, and knew when to give up. Now she is looking at him with pleading eyes.
, he mused. Yet Sherlock's charming brow seemed so fragile right now... But John knew it contained hidden such depths of intelligence that the whole image of Sherlock lying here naked in bed, exposed and unaware, was strangely paradoxical. How could such a brilliant, superior mind be so juvenile and endearing? It would never cease to amaze John: this simultaneous impression of an admirable genius and of some difficult, capricious child.
Mycroft always blended more easily because he knew how to talk to people and flatter their ego. He knew what people wanted to hear, what they liked, didn't like, and what they feared. He would gladly step back to control everything around him, and never felt
John blinked upon realizing what he had just thought. He massaged his temples, trying hard not to start laughing like a madman in his office.
get to this? Their relationship was never good. A 6 year difference isn't negligible when you're a kid, and especially once you've become a teenager. When Harry was 6, John was already in secondary school, and by the time she was 13, he'd already left home. When their parents had died, they'd both been adults, and he didn't have to take care of her. He did though. He tried. Just like she'd tried after Sherlock's death. But both of them were broken back then, and didn't know each other well enough to be each other's support. While John was playing rugby at the Blackheath rugby team, Harry was writing poetry and painting and thought she could be an artist. When he entered the British Army, she was studying in uni management and accounting. They never had much to talk about, but she still cared, and she knew he did, too. She'd been so happy when he had come to spend a few days with her over Christmas the year he was still living with Sherlock Holmes.
at all for the blazing torrents of sparkling pleasure to submerge him, and arched his back delightedly before falling back on the mattress with transport. John did not let go of him until he went flaccid in his hand, feeling groggy and utterly relaxed.
This time you are the one who looks away. "How my body might react to it." You swallow. "John, I'm sorry, I think I might just stay cold."
What had he been thinking? It was all nice and sweet to profess your love so dramatically, but what now? John had never considered getting into a relationship with Sherlock, it was absurd. The other man had made it quite clear from day one that he was not interested in romance. Romance. The word made John's head spin, and not in a good way. This was crazy. He was crazy.
So he turns his laptop on, and decides to send an email. It's good today isn't Christmas, because they never spent Christmas together, nor wrote, since they were adults – they only spent a few days together sometimes afterwards. Rarely. Last time was special, and it was all because of Sherlock: John needed a break. He also believed at the time Harry really had stopped drinking, and had hated Sherlock for pointing out he was wrong – again. For being right, too.
Sherlock wondered about the change of preposition as his gaze met John's. His eyes widened slightly as he understood something. Stupid. Hadn't he said so himself? He hadn't been the only one to be tortured in the Basement. John had been tortured as well. And wasn't that what the guilt was all about? John was afraid everything he had done since then had been for himself and not for Sherlock. Now he was even having nightmares about it – like Sherlock. Like he used to have nightmares about the war, and still did, sometimes.
Sherlock can tell she'll cry again. Perhaps she already is as she walks down the staircase. He turns to John.
"Sherlock, how is that relevant to anything?!" John protested, even though he was quite evidently aroused.
Sherlock's eyes turned to slits as he stared at his friend. "Do you want to keep this secret?" he asked cautiously. John blinked.
. There was no doubt where his allegiance lay. It was understandable that Sherlock would want him far from John as often as possible; but the only way to make sure of this was to have him by his own side. And who knew what damage Moran could do, living in the same room as Sherlock?
She blinks and turns to you with bewilderment before bursting out laughing. Every time she sits there smoking at night, you find her dazzling. Always you fear she might fall.
He slipped his left hand under Sherlock's fist, which slackened at the contact and held the hand tentatively – not from fear, but from shyness, John noted gleefully. He held the pale hand back, and pushed his elbow into the flesh at a slow but firm pace, working the knot. Sherlock hissed and thrashed, grabbing John's hand with desperation and squeezing it so tightly it was painful. But John barely noticed, for it didn't matter: all that mattered was that Sherlock relaxed enough to gain energy.
Your voice was drawling and you didn't care. He was dull, and silence suited him better anyway. You saw his reflected expression on the pane darken slightly, but he seemed to get the message.
And with those words she was gone, hurrying down the aisle. John sighed. He was heading to the vending machine when his phone vibrated in his pocket.
"Oh that's such a pity," she comments in a somewhat disapproving tone, and John smiles at her motherly consideration.
have such a good night vision, because he was starting to become all flustered, picturing Sherlock stroking his hair when he was in fact just stroking his fur between the ears, picturing Sherlock stroking
Sherlock uses the word "asexual" to refer to himself in a dialogue with Maggie, where he is trying to portray himself as unthreatening as possible to her relationship with John, using a supposedly clear and definite label that she would understand. The reason John uses the word to refer to Sherlock is only because Sherlock himself used it before, so John is taking it at face value. Asexuality itself is an umbrella term. Sexuality and relationships are always complex to define, and can evolve - it's all a spectrum. That being said, regardless of where this fic will go, never assume that asexuality is something that must be overcome to develop a good relationship, or, conversely, that asexuality is something set in stone that defines a person intrinsically. People's sexuality or lack thereof sometimes changes, and sometimes doesn't, and it's all good. To learn more about the asexuality spectrum and various other terms, and if you need any support, I recommend the
"Yes, back to normal, see? Everything is perfectly fine, nothing is wrong with me. I can tell just from a look at you that you were supposed to have a date tonight, had planned to phone Clara because it's her birthday but haven't had the leisure to do so, are feeling frustrated and tired and angry, but also guilty and you've been worrying all day long so that now you've turned into a convoluted mix of soldier gone berserk and mother hen – a very interesting mix, might I add. Also you forgot to call the clinic about that red-haired patient of yours you've been concerned about and whom you were expecting to see this afternoon – maybe a beginning of anorexia but she doesn't seem to be willing to talk about it to anyone but you. You've been looking all morning – well, before we were kidnapped anyway – for the shopping list you made yesterday and which included the ingredients you'll need to cook whatever funny scone recipe Mrs. Hudson gave you on Tuesday – the list's under the fridge, by the way."
Sherlock had just opened his mouth to answer when John's phone rang. The consulting detective gave him a rather miffed look, and John grumbled an apology as he picked up.
But there was one thing, one thing Lestrade was absolutely certain of: Sherlock wanted John to live. And so all Greg could do was make sure John would, indeed, live; to the fullest, and with the people dearest to him. Lestrade would ensure it: John had to live.
months, he realizes. Unless that note he left in the flat after his... well, could be called 'news'.
He nuzzled into his friend's neck and wriggled his hips so their abdomens would be touching, only separated by his hand still lying on Sherlock's stomach. His right hand crept back up, still playing the concerto, until it reached his nape, tickling soothingly. Unsettling yet liberating: John's touch was entrancingly paradoxical, thought Sherlock in a daze.
Sherlock closed his eyes and curled up in the chair. He would need some sleep before the night. Too much to do at night. No time to sleep.
Sherlock glowered at the bathtub as if it were responsible for his not finding what he was looking for, and walked back to the main room. "Why is that odd?"
But now that he thought about it, John had been quite upset after the train ride. It was true that being kissed by a tiger
"I'm fine," he heard his own voice answer. She seemed even more worried and gave him a pained look. Pain. That was more like it. Greg could relate to that.
"Do you think you were the only one thinking all night? I've been thinking, trying to understand your reasons."
Never had a cab ride seemed so long to her. She felt stupid for not having texted John earlier, and having wasted so much time brooding when it was supposed to be the time of the year for celebration. She paid the cabbie and jumped off the car before ringing the bell to the landlady's flat. She didn't have to wait long before the good Mrs. Hudson came to the door and opened it for her, a friendly smile on her lips and a question in her eyes.
When John woke up in the morning, Sherlock was already waiting in the kitchen, pretending to examine something with his microscope. He himself had only managed to fall asleep a little before dawn, and still had woken up hours ago... in human form. With John still hugging him as if he were a giant pillow. Sherlock couldn't remember having ever felt so awkward – nor having ever blushed so hard.
"Because I need to know if you like it or not; how much you like it, or how much you hate it... Words are always deceitful in some way if you formulate them in your mind first, as is usually the case."
"Bravo," she whispered. "You haven't changed a bit. You're still so... sharp." There was an edge of bitterness, perhaps even pain, in her tone, under the ostentatious playfulness. She smiled. "This calls for some celebration, don't you think?" She took the phone and composed a number. "This is room 212. Please bring us a bottle of Champagne and two glasses. Thank you." She hung up.
Fear and an indefinable anguish flickered in the clear pupils, which blurred – but Sherlock did not avert his gaze. He forced himself to look in the depths of John's irises, to really look, even though their intensity was blinding, their determination dazzling.
Then there had come John and Sherlock had wondered if that couldn't possibly have been considered, perhaps, a chance at happiness: even when there was no case, when he was with John on a non-case day and his friend was in manul form, or he in tiger form, and he was being taken care of, or they were just cuddling and snuggling, it was somehow okay. There was no thrill, and no excitation whatsoever: Sherlock certainly did not feel fulfilled, but he did not crave the Work either, nor anything else more radical, like the terrible white powder... He felt... content, perhaps. Good, for sure. A little bit more than all right. Warm, and warmth was good, for some unfathomable reason – the kind of warmth that made you smile unwittingly. Sherlock found he enjoyed it greatly.
In any case, the bedroom was still the best bet. Sherlock looked in the corridor where room 212 was, but saw no trace of John. Just in case he could have somehow managed to enter the bedroom, Sherlock took out his card and opened the door. All was quiet inside, but that didn't mean much. He went into the bedroom, then the bathroom, but saw no trace of John. Dread settled in the pit of his stomach. What if the culprit hadn't left and was still in the rooms when they'd entered? They hadn't even checked. He swallowed, cursing his carelessness. John would be proud, of course. He'd thought of saving the life of the victim first, but the truth was, Victor could have managed alone. Sherlock had only done a cursory search of the premise. He hadn't looked in the wardrobe or the cupboards.
was your cure after the war. I think only you can be mine now. It doesn't have to involve anything you don't want it to involve, just... You. I trust you, John. Only you," he added, probably to pre-empt any remark such as
You're not really white," she remarks out loud. "I kind of like you." Leaning against the wall, she lets out a sigh. "Do you think John kept you because he liked you or because you were Sherlock's?" The skull remains silent. "Right.
"Because the blows, though verbal, had been all too real. I felt that I did not deserve his forgiveness. I could not ask him to trust me again. I knew he never would. And... I could settle for nothing less. I would rather keep the memory of him as he was when I met him, of the closeness we had shared, than to resume with him a friendship as shallow as I'd had with everyone else till then, and have had ever since. I knew I would always feel the distance I had put between us. And I couldn't bear it."
"I don't know how you can trust me. I don't know how you ended up trusting me, of all people, with this. You're very weird, John."
Something like pain flashed in the translucent eyes and John regretted his words instantly. He hadn't meant the reference to the wall or Sherlock's bad habit to shoot at it when he was bored. Sherlock must be feeling so very lost and out of place. John resumed his petting and sent him an apologetic look.
Sherlock swiftly tripped John and brought him back down into his arms, pinning him to the ground before he could put any clothes on.
"Sorry, I already examined the body, and I'm not especially inclined to keep groping or staring at a cor..."
himself to please the doctor. Not all the time, of course – he still acted like a prick and ruined all his dates and considered he should be his number one priority. But wasn't that all too telling?
Mary's voice snaps you out of your reminiscence and hits you like a bucket of cold water. How horrible can you be? Her tone is sad, gentle. You lack the strength to lie to her. Maybe you respect her too much for that.
She froze, then blinked, and only then did she cry out. John groaned, burying his face in his hands and rubbing his temples.
He would have taken a cab back to the hotel, but it was four in the morning and not London, and walking might do him some good anyway. So he walked. Victor was fine. That took care of many of his tangents, but not the most pressing one. John. Maybe he was fine too. And maybe he was not at all fine. Maybe John was a dead manul by now, broken down into marketable parts. Maybe John was a man again, but in a cage meant for a manul, and hurt and naked and helpless. Maybe—
"I know what I said," John retorted impatiently. "Look, I'm sorry Hil... Mr. Cubitt, but can we just go back now?"
? You mean to you!" He observes you suspiciously for a few seconds, then adds with a frown: "Don't tell me you've seriously fallen for her..."
John hasn't been to Sherlock's grave since the night he tried to dig him out. He certainly wouldn't try now, and the thought makes him retch. He never liked cemeteries, because there are so many people there it never feels intimate enough to have a decent conversation with the dead. Not that the dead would care, obviously.
John did not seem to understand what he was apologizing for, but the serious tone of his friend made him forget his own condition. Tilting his head to the side, he waited for Sherlock to develop his thought.
anyone pointing a weapon at John. Especially if the situation clearly put them at the mercy of their enemy – which quite frankly rather seemed to be the case presently.
The curtains were drawn and the bed had been slept in, but there was no trace of his flatmate. Sherlock was getting more concerned – and more curious – by the second. He hadn't heard John go out at all, even though he'd been up most of the night. John could have walked down the stairs while he was taking a nap, but it was highly improbable that the unsleeping detective would have missed the telltale creaking of the steps... Sherlock observed the crumpled sheets for a minute before leaving thoughtfully. He was half-way down the stairs when he stopped dead in his tracks. Hadn't John cut his hair recently?
So you are in London alone?" Why hadn't he noticed her? Well, to be fair, he hadn't been looking for her. At all.
"Definitely not," John concurred  bitterly. Grabbing the piece of paper, he left the flat without a word,  and didn't notice Sherlock's lingering gaze on his back as he marched  out.
For a second, he thought he saw a flash of pride in the consulting criminal's eyes, and he felt his hand linger more gently on his scalp.
He sighs dramatically and aims your gun at you. Your own gun. You look at it, then at Seb, then at the gun again.
She sighed. Harry hated lunch breaks, because she always thought of her brother. How did it get to this? How did
Except that John wasn't gay. Harry hadn't known him to be a Casanova, and she'd found out from Bill. But she had seen him with girlfriends and with male friends, and no one could be straighter than her brother. He was completely tolerant, of course, and he hadn't said anything when she had come out in high school. To be quite honnest, he probably didn't care. He was already in med school, and as open-minded as he was upright. She'd always admired him, and it had been a relief when he didn't shun her because of her sexuality. It would have been a blow.
He promptly put his phone away and displayed himself rather theatrically so Sherlock could observe him at leisure.
And see it, you did. You probably never chuckled so much during sex, repressing your laughter so as not to wake the whole neighborhood. Mary is tender, teasing, eccentric and funny even in bed, and it is so much like her that you enjoy it greatly. That is, until she finds a piece of clothe under your pillow while riding you, and brings it out in surprise.
"Sherlock, John, this is Mr. Leverton, a customer who has been staying with us for quite some time and whose wife had the misfortune to find a body in their wardrobe."
His face broke into a full grin when he saw that the shape under the sheets wasn't that of a man. He probably should've felt guilty about making John feel abandoned enough that he transformed into a manul, but all he felt as he lay down next to him and gathered him into his arms was glee. He couldn't help himself.
His voice saves John. It gives him back the use of his vocal chords, as a pair of full lips presses against the side of his neck and kisses its way down his collarbone. John arches his back with a sigh, exposing his torso, revelling in the warmth of the hands roaming over his skin. He wishes they'd merge into his abdomen, wishes he could swallow them all, hands, fleshy lips and dark curls, so there would be only one flesh, only one man; only one soul.
"I'm not good at massages," Sherlock blurted. "I can't give you one like you did for me yesterday. But because of this case I know the basics of shiatsu and reflexology. Quite frankly, I'm not convinced, and I've never even practised except on corpses, but I've been thinking about it and I do believe that I can use this to relax your body in depth," he said somewhat hurriedly.
"Excuse me..." the stranger began. She stopped in front of the bench on which they were sitting and looked from John's face to Sherlock's. She was in her twenties. Her complexion was quite pale, and her eyes were red as if she had been crying. "Are you John Watson and Sherlock Holmes?"
He joined the tiger in the living-room, surprised to see that he had indeed cleaned up both the spilt water and the four buckets. Sherlock was now plugging something into John's laptop and trying to open it by nuzzling between the keyboard and the screen. The manul gaped at the unusual scene and chuckled. Sherlock could truly be adorable in tiger form.
But Sherlock had frozen on the spot and was no longer listening to him. Frowning, John walked up to him and looked over his shoulder. The detective's eyes were fixed on the strange series of smileys that Cubitt had printed for him to see. The man had finally left to get on the last train to Norfolk, but John had to bear his presence all afternoon and listen to him being dotty about his wife for
Moran gives him a smile, and Sherlock is surprised to see it is genuine. Maybe all his smiles had been genuine. As if he could hear his thoughts, Sebastian turns to him a little and winks. Sherlock blinks, not sure he has seen correctly.
“And just where will I be?”  John’s voice had taken on a decidedly withered tone.  He had a sinking feeling that he knew
“Christ, Sherlock … what was that?” she breathed heavily, collapsing against the cushions behind her.  She gripped his fingers where Sherlock’s hand lay on her inner thigh.
Buoyed by the DI’s – incorrect – assumption that he was not wholly at fault for once, Sherlock told him. He recited, verbatim, the details of his and Joanna’s row for the Detective Inspector as he continued searching the corpse for the container that had been secreted away somewhere amidst the detritus of flesh.
This was an occasion.  Sherlock largely remained taciturn whenever emotions came into play, so that he would willingly engage in such a discussion let alone initiate it surprised Joanna.  However, Sherlock never did anything he didn’t want to, so she wasn’t about to argue the point.
“She looks … ancient.” Sherlock’s conscience – which had long since taken on the soft contralto of Joanna’s voice – chastised his choice of words, but he persisted lest his brother suss out the truth of his feelings. Mycroft’s actions in Serbia had proven to Sherlock that in Mycroft’s world, caring was
“I wouldn’t have, you know, but not because it’s a irreplaceable instrument that’s been in your family for generations.”
The Tree – Jenkins – acknowledged Reese’s advice with a wave, and dropped his head to the mat with a groan for a moment before slowly getting up to bump Joanna’s wrapped fist with his in appreciation for a good workout.
into his mouth before reaching for the small plate of spare ribs.  It was late, and though the place was open until two a.m., there were only a handful of other patrons scattered thinly through the Chinese restaurant.
“What do you want, love?” John asked.  He cupped the side of her face in his large hand and rubbed his thumb affectionately across the bottom of her lip.
Eight days later, Joanna knelt beside the eviscerated body that was splayed out on the wooden floor of the back room of a small clothing shop in Portobello Road.  The room was dim – the light fixtures and electrical wiring were about as old as the vintage clothing that hung on the racks and walls – so Joanna had a small torch clamped between her teeth as she poked delicately through the viscera for the clue that she knew should be there. This was the third victim that she had examined in as many days.  Victim number five, by head count, of the Portobello Road Killer.  The Yarders had shortened it, incorrectly, to the “PBR Killer.” It was a nickname that drove Sherlock spare.
about it.” Mary dropped her head to John’s knees for a moment, breathing heavily, trying to collect herself.  When she looked back up at him, he saw that unshed tears had filled her blue eyes, but her voice was steady and strong.  “I knew what had happened the moment you slid in next to me, and I was so happy for you, John.  For
Joanna didn’t blush at the not-so-subtle reminder of what landed her in hospital to begin with.  Might as well own the mistake.  “No, it wouldn’t.”
privately, Sherlock admitted that he was astoundingly thick when it came to interpersonal issues, but he felt that he had made some progress since Joanna Watson had come into his life. A year ago, this conversation would have been nearly impossible, and Sherlock’s capitulation a pipe dream for the Detective Inspector.
“The wink was actually a nice touch. Very human of you,” Joanna said. She pocketed the phone, looked up at him.  When had she gotten so close? Sherlock wondered.  “It’s the same one you gave me that day at Bart’s.  Very cheeky, but then that’s part and parcel of the whole Sherlock Holmes package, isn’t it?  Play poorly at being human so they don’t have to see how human you really are.”
“Open your eyes, John,” Sherlock said, tugging on his chin.  “Not time to sleep yet.  Concussion, remember?”
extended attention was something altogether different.  As Joanna’s fingers picked and separated each tangle on his head, Sherlock found his mind decelerating. Lost in the sensations of her fingertips and of the bits of Joanna he had been storing in his mind palace for months, Sherlock felt a mantle of contentment settle upon him that he had not experienced in decades.
“We will.”  Sherlock answered for them both, John at a loss for words.  That the doctor had reached another major turning point in his life was clear on his face, and Mary ached to reassure him, but she couldn’t.  John and Sherlock had to make this choice on their own, without any additional influence from her.
John took Sherlock’s silence as acquiescence and his raised eyebrow as the unspoken request.  “It was my grandmother, actually.  She raised us after our mother died.”  The eyebrow crept higher.  “Da had run off a few years prior,” John explained, his tone indicating that Sherlock would get no further information on
“You, my love, crawled back into our bed at dawn, lips swollen, tender, bruised from snogging; face and neck raw from beard stubble; finger-sized bruises pressed into your hips and arse.”
“Sherlock, have you ever talked with Jo about her childhood?  About what happened when her grandfather died, and she was sent back to live with her father?”
I should be stronger.  I used to be made of sturdier stuff, but I’ve come to understand that the soldier in me – the one you relied upon so much – died in Afghanistan. She never made it back to England. What returned to London was a hollow wraith of a thing.  The bravery and fearlessness of that woman died when the enemy put a bullet in her shoulder.
Sherlock and Joanna have an epic row, a serial killer is loose in Notting Hill, our heroes eat something other than Chinese, Thai, or curry for lunch, and Lestrade learns a lot of Mycroft.
Sherlock fidgeted with the bag in his hand, embarrassed and uncertain as he always was when forced to face that with which his genius provided no succour, and he was pretty sure that this
rarely, felt the need to apologize.  He said what he knew to be true, back up his claims with factual – or at the very least, anecdotal – evidence, and if people weren’t able to handle the truth, more’s the pity. It wasn’t his problem.
“Umm … everything alright, ladies?” Greg asked, sarcasm dripping from his voice.  He knew better than to get in the middle of two women fighting without a complete tactical team for backup, but this was his crime scene, after all.
Joanna started as though he had physically struck her with his sarcasm.  She sat up on the bed, already reaching for the bastard, but Greg’s firm grasp and a sudden surge of pain in her abdomen stayed her.
Keys had been exchanged for convenience sake, but Sherlock had quickly learned that coming unannounced into their flat late at night and barging into John and Mary’s bedroom without knocking was more than a bit not good.
polite, sometimes even mannerly, to me – at least in your own way.  Yet you couldn’t meet my eyes.  Kept your distance.  Couldn’t even spare me a ‘Good afternoon, Mary.’
“Says the doctor with a concussion who refused medical treatment at a crime scene despite the fact that he was knocked unconscious for 30 minutes,” Sherlock said, voice dripping with sarcasm.  He reached out one long arm to grab John by the collar of his jacket as the doctor’s balance gave out, yet again, and hauled him carefully yet none too gracefully down the hall and up the 17 steps to their flat.
“The day we met …” Joanna had stopped to figure out how best to phrase what she wanted to tell him.  Sherlock saw how the shame had deepened in her eyes. Clearly whatever she wanted to say made her feel weak.  Odds were that she was about to share with him something few people, if any, knew.  “I had already put most of my affairs in order, yeah?  There wasn’t much, to do, actually.  It’s not like I had a lot of possessions or people in my life that would have noticed. At least that’s what I thought at the time.  Updated my will to leave my effects and pension to Bill.”  Joanna’s voice had become monotonous, lost all emphasis. “Letter for Harry, not that he really deserved one, but figured he’d tell our Da … Was on my way back to that awful bedsit when I decided to take a detour through the park, and I ran into Mike.”
I have given Joanna the most extreme case of this illness, and compounded it with a bleeding ulcer and depression just to really make things difficult for her.  Whumping on a character is fun in a twisted kind of way, after all.  The premise that I am working from (in her private blog in chapter one) is that initially she was physically ill due to grief, but as her depression became worse, she failed to recognise the symptoms of morning sickness for what they were.  The stress of the situation also exacerbated her ulcer, leading to the bleeding that finally gets her the care she needs -- as well as the shock of her life.  I ask that you don't think too poorly of Joanna that she was drinking -- and in one case over drinking -- 21-year old scotch while pregnant.  She would never knowingly act so recklessly if she knew she was with child.  I just made sure that she didn't know.
Sherlock turned his attention away from a skilful sequence of swing punches to the man standing next to him. “Have we met?” Sherlock asked as he observed the dark-skinned man: forty-two year old former Royal Marine (three tours), gunshot wounds to the upper left thigh and left abdomen; not invalided out, retired; 20 per cent hearing loss right ear (didn’t always wear protective earplugs when on or around helicopters); mixed martial arts expert specializing in
John’s excitement had been tangible, his shaking had nothing to do with the naked woman he held in his arms, but he was unsure of the protocol – for lack of a better word – in this situation.  So Mary educated him by, quite literally, pushing her lover from their bed with her feet, his “Oi!  Bit more warning next time.  The floor’s bloody freezing, you know!” making her laugh aloud.
“Get some rest, John,” Sherlock said finally, looking over his shoulder at the man on his bed.  His voice was at once so quiet and so deep that John thought he felt the words rather than heard them.  “I’ll wake you in two hours.”
The old man snorted derisively.  “Ahh, lass.  Ye cut me to the quick.  Ye know yer Jamie better than that, me thinks.”  Not even trying to hide his interest, the he leaned a bit further across the bar to get a better view of the men.  “So ... that’s Himself, then?  Returned from the dead.  If that’s not a turn up …” Jamie harrumphed in consideration before turning his attention back to the dirty glasses he had been cleaning.  “Bit more of o’ a posh air ‘bout him than I expected from a private detective.“
"Not bad. How are you? Greg told me Sherlock solved the case with the goose. That was quite a story!"
"Hello. I have a man here who took a bullet in the arm just now – I haven't checked if the injury is penetrative or not. We are at Ridling Thorpe Manor..."
Lestrade, just think for once! John knew someone was after him, he came all the way to London to ask for
cook or prepare food outside of your experiments. I'd rather have something edible this morning. Why don't you go first?"
And as he said that he pulled forcefully on the fabric, making Sherlock gasp and arch, his chest fully exposed as the shirt was still holding his arms back. The detective froze, and realized how strongly he was shaking.
John comes burning alive, wrung out and gasping. As it dies, he spares half a thought for the boy, though surely unexpected orgasms are par for the course in his line of work. To John's relief, he doesn't seem fazed, just swallows it all down greedily, taking everything John has to offer until he's too tender and draws the boy off, his softening cock slipping out with a pop. John slumps back onto his elbows on the bed, buzzing with aftershocks.
Sherlock has no answer, none that will sound reasonable at any rate. Not to a man whose female companions are as easily acquired as a new toothbrush. The dossier on the Tsvetkovs did not mention their involvement in anything like human trafficking, but the broader SIC certainly dabbles.
John takes a deep breath, reaches behind himself to fish his wallet out of his pocket. He’s suddenly overcome with a rush of adrenaline, a fire banked before it explodes. He doesn't want to scare the boy, though his mind can't help but conjure up an image of this one writhing on the bed, wrists wrapped in the iron grip of his fists. Instead, he withdraws a folded note and holds it up between two fingers for inspection.
They arrived there earlier that morning. Sherlock has been working for months to integrate himself into the Tsvetkov brothers’ good graces, to be allowed to accompany them to the
“When you leave the room be sure to take off your shoes. Walk to the kitchen and grab a knife from the wooden block on the counter. Don’t grab a big one, you’re too small to wield it properly. Grab the paring knife. Walk up behind him and take him by the fringe, like this.”
He checks all the right boxes. Pale skinned and thin; dark, purple-tinged shadows under his eyes; high cheekbones like gorges on a sun-bleached sidewalk. Tall. Not quite as tall but tall
Sherlock would normally have hung up by now but something – the same something that prods at sores and picks at itchy scabs – hesitates. Mycroft takes this as his unspoken assent.
, John reminds himself, because there is no way this creature is as older than eighteen, nineteen possibly, though like his...friend, he too wears a face of one who will always be mistaken for younger than he is. It’s the eyes, John thinks. One never gets past the first impression, and a reasonable (sane) man would hesitate to go back for seconds in case they started looking – really
Spitting mad, muscles coiled like a viper ready to strike. Less a small dog and more a feral cat, backed into the corner of a cage.
John had though he'd lost the capacity to feel shame about anything. He is not relieved to realize he was wrong.
Mihael takes a deep, startling breath in. He does not even glance at the couple practically in mid-coitus next to him. “You should try it. I think you will like it. I think you will be
He stubs out his cigarette, crushes it beneath the heel of a large dirty black boot, and goes inside the flat.
“It’s the only way,” Sherlock whispers. He says this and it means everything: ‘it’ is this mission, ‘it’ is Moriarty and the Fall and doing whatever it takes to protect the people who mean the very most to him in this world.
“See, Sherlock, this is what you could never get through your thick skull,” John says. He sounds angry and frustrated and so, so familiar. “The drugs. You tell yourself they make you brilliant – no shut up,
He cants his hips up so those deft fingers can pull his pants further down, John's hands clenching in the covers. There are little noises now, tiny sighs and hums of curiosity or pleasure that are too good, too
"Can I know yours?" He's fished out John's cock, is working it to full hardness with slow, measured strokes.
His thighs tense and the boy hums. One of his hands has traveled up to John's stomach, pressing inside his shirt to feel where his stomach muscles are tight with the effort of holding steady. A finger ghosts over some battle scar, some relic, and the fingers are not these fingers, this place is not what it will never be. And John -
It’s moments like this when Sherlock misses him like a limb; misses him like he misses his violin and shortbread biscuits and Ms Hudson’s cup of tea. He would hesitate to call it
and how cruel that the mind remembers these things, memories wrapped in sensations wrapped in desires.
“No, I’m not,” John agrees. “Because if I were, you wouldn’t be here either. You wouldn’t be high as a kite. You wouldn’t be skin and bones and track marks, and you wouldn’t have just provided a teenage girl with a tutorial on how to murder a man with a stolen knife. There’s no way I would let you do any of this, not while I was there to stop it.”
Sherlock knows suddenly, like he knows chemistry and London’s seedy underbelly, that Mihael is erect under his trousers.
? There are too many variables, and this is not the real John. That smile will not mean anything more than Sherlocks’ subconscious trying to tell him something. Trying to drive him towards some conclusion. The clock is ticking.
“The Yard has a successfully executed a raid on a nightclub where a patron was suspected of supplying the visitors with methylenedioxymethamphetamine. He was quite an entrepreneur, but as they say, flew a bit too close to the sun and sold to a young woman who had an undiagnosed heart condition. Lestrade managed to solve the case all by himself and identified the nightclub owner as the one who was supplying the drugs, in a rather surprising turn of events. He’s been the feature on nighttime telly this entire week.
The boy takes a moment before he snatches the money from John's fingers. And then it's like a switch has been thrown, and he is suddenly crawling into John's lap, scratching across John's chest, pressing his mouth to the spot behind John's ear and breathing out, hot and heavy, "Then tell me what you want, darling."
"Hmmm." The boy takes the zipper and pulls it down. He reaches inside and grasps John's pants, starts tugging them down. "Do you want to give me one?"
What are the odds, he wonders, of finding one such as this? He half expects it to be a fugue state, to wake up any second now chasing the left over remnants from the bottom of a bottle. But though his capacity for creativity is masterful there are some things even his imagination cannot capture. Little nuances unique to these illicit encounters that would never have entered on Doctor John Watson’s radar before, well….before. The way the boy steps between John's thighs where he sits on the bed to bracket him in, how he takes a drag and blows the smoke through his nose away from John's face, the movement of his hands drifting across his bare chest to tease at the dip just above his trousers, tight and black...it's all designed to mislead, to entice the buyer into forgetting that this is all really quite dangerous. Illegal. Shameful.
Inside the flat are two sons of an SIC éminence grise, one’s wife, and the other’s girlfriend. Both men are accomplished killers with several murders to their name, foul tempered and prone to unpredictable fits of violence.
Time passes slowly and in an instant. When he comes back to himself – minutes later? hours? – Anton and his wife have begun to kiss, slowly at first, but soon they fall into a languid rhythm, their bodies twisting together in an amorous sprawl that eats up two-thirds of the sofa. Anton begins to part the folds of his wife’s low-cut dress. He reaches inside with one big hand to fondle her breast and she squirms. Less than a foot away, Mihael seems oblivious. His girlfriend shifts uncomfortably – embarrassed, aroused, hard to tell, he was never good at telling the difference anyway
It occurs to Sherlock then that there is something else about Yana that does not quite fit with the frightened-child theory he’d been harboring, uncanny ability to parse accents aside. The way she watches him, her gaze never faltering. She’s calmed slightly now that she doesn’t perceive him as an immediate risk, but she hasn’t let her guard down entirely. She is smart, and there is simply too much awareness in that one eye of hers. The placidity beneath the storm, a calculation, the gleam that comes from the fervent dedication of one who is committed to –
His accent his rougher, less posh, but his voice is deep, throat ruined enough by a habitual cigarette habit and other activities that the mental stretch isn't much effort, and it goes to John's head.
Her head whips around fast. One of her eyes is swollen almost to the point of being fully shut and the other is a shade of pale blue that looks almost translucent in the sunlight. She won’t answer him because she doesn’t yet trust that this isn’t a trick, isn’t some game meant to torment her further.
Mycroft is slightly out of breath, obviously having been caught in the midst of jogging on that ridiculous treadmill, must have his eye on one of the newest Brioni numbers and has delusions of maintaining the same waist size when his tailor comes to call.
The two weeks immediately following Sherlock’s return to London had been tension-filled and strained as the consulting detective and his blogger learned to re-establish their relationship after years of separation and aching sentiment.  Mary’s presence in John’s life was an added complication to the closeness that had existed before, but she had quickly come to genuinely like Sherlock Holmes.  Fourteen months of listening to John’s stories about his dead friend had left her more than prepared for the younger man’s mood swings, insults, and intensity.  Additional prodding from Mrs. Hudson, Molly, and even Greg Lestrade ensured that the pair spent more and more time together, but what it ultimately took was the buzz of a text message summoning John to his first crime scene in two years.
Should probably see a doctor – other than myself – but I can’t really be arsed to care.  Maybe I’ll hook myself up to some IV fluids.  I think I still have the equipment around.
“We have not. Her mother died when she was a child, and I gathered that her subsequent experiences were largely unpleasant, but what would be gained by such an intrusion into her life?”
“And we’re all the worse for trying.” A sudden breeze blew through the park, and without thinking, Joanna popped up the collar of her coat – Sherlock’s coat – around her neck to keep warm. “It hurts so much more now.”
The sixth victim was currently slumped over the cash drawer in the main showroom of the shop where Sherlock was doing the same as she. They had been pulled in by the Yard when the fourth victim – Jaina Corben – was found after hours in her fruit and veg stand; Corben had been asphyxiated when a deadly fruit salad of blueberries, blackberries, kiwi fruit, and green grapes had been shoved down her oesophagus. Joanna had avoided the produce section at Tesco’s ever since.  It wasn’t as much of a challenge as it otherwise might have been because she had been ignoring Sherlock’s demands for strawberries in much the same way that she had been ignoring Sherlock altogether.
Sherlock saw John’s jaw clench tightly and a flash of panic spark in his eyes before he spun away.  The doctor grabbed at the edge of the desk for balance, though whether that need for stability was physical or psychological was open for debate. John gripped the top so tightly that Sherlock heard the wooden joints creak in protest, but for that, the only sound in the flat was that of the ragged, shallow breathing of a man who refused to capitulate to fear. Again in control of himself, John walked to the window, pushed aside one of the loose boards with a finger, and peered out into the quiet, cold night
really narrows it all down to just one,” she said, waving the paper in the air like a clue at a crime scene before passing it to Lestrade.
something to you?” For several moments the only sound in the flat was that of her ragged breathing as she struggled to hold herself together. She would
Lestrade rubbed his face and was surprised at moisture he found in the corners of his own eyes; he missed Sherlock more than he ever thought possible.  Somewhere through countless cases, endless take away meals, and unending hours spent slogging through old files, Greg had grown to love the genius who had aggravated the DI as much as he had amazed him.  Greg knew that he would never see the like of Sherlock Holmes again, and he dwelled in his own private hell when he considered his own contributions to the man’s untimely death.
The next ten minutes featured a very spirited discussion regarding personal grooming, invasion of privacy – ‘You can have your privacy when you start respecting mine, you berk!’ – and aesthetics that finally ended with Joanna’s passionate plea, “Sod it all, Sherlock! You know you don’t want to shave it off any more than I do.  I don’t buy the ‘transport’ argument this time.  You love your hair. I mean, have you
After a few quick cuts with the surgical scissors, Sherlock was able to pull the tatters of cotton away from John’s torso and was greeted with his first glimpse of the bullet wound that had ended John’s military career.  The site was indeed a mess.  A mass of pink scar tissue – some caused by the initial wound, some from the surgeries – wrapped its way across the top of John’s shoulder as well as under his arm, but it was the subtle depression below John’s left clavicle that caused Sherlock’s heart to lurch for the second time that night.  The doctor had once vaguely described his injury and indicated that he had contracted a staph infection that nearly claimed his life.  Clearly, medical treatment had included surgically removing a noticeable portion of the infected tissue.
He shrugs and sinks into the bath, water up to his chin. He really looks like a child. You want to sit by his side but do not want to leave the room to get a chair, so you end up sitting on the floor next to the bathtub, leaning against it. You cannot see Sherlock, but you can still feel him. His scent. His presence in your back. You close your eyes.
was the true sociopath, and he knew and understood Sherlock so intimately that he had known exactly what should be done to break him beyond repair.
that he missed the feral glint that lit in his lover's pupils. Sherlock felt like he was burning from the inside and John was refusing to give him water. He growled threateningly.
a rival, and not Mycroft – as if telling him he was not worth being considered a rival, since Sherlock cared so little for him.
The whisper and the warmth of the tickling breath on his ear almost made him freeze, but he didn't want this to stop – ever, if he had to be honest – and so he remained focused on the music. The one they were playing, together.
if you'd let them kill him and his stupid girlfriend, and kept tracking them in the dark, until you unravelled the whole organization completely? They would've been absolutely bamboozled! What, it wasn't Sherlock Holmes that they'd killed? What a ridiculously amateur error, really. So silly. You could've done something great with such a mistake on their part. But nooo, you didn't think, did you? On second thought, perhaps you did. Which is even worse... You disappointed me, Sherlock, you disappointed me. Well, that Shan woman disappointed me too, because had you been smarter than that and left the doctor to take your place, you could've easily got to me. But she wasn't a problem – I could get rid of her. You, on the other hand... I couldn't believe you'd missed such an opportunity.
Sherlock lets out a relieved sigh, and you can't repress a smile. Yes. He definitely doesn't want to see. And that's just fine.
Greg had nothing to say to that. In less than a minute, John had managed to bring him back to the state he was in months ago. He felt hollow. This was the harsh reality.
"I see." Well, he didn't, not really. But from the look on John's face, he knew, and so Sherlock did not expand on the matter. He'd admitted to enough of his shortcomings for one day. Or one week.
Sherlock retched and came again, blown away by a chalky tornado of undesired hands and tongues and voices. His body was ripped and bleached in an immaculate swirl of light. A gunshot. His ejaculation stained the sheet with inky black. Sherlock fought and struggled despairingly, trying to find something to hang on to as he was swallowed by a blistering chiaroscuro.
"I never asked about that. Your husband is a fool for believing you without even hiring a private detective."
"This is too showy for you," she let out eventually. "I understand you wanted to advertise yourself with the simultaneous break-ins but–"
Too late, though. Molly had caught the eye of a brown-haired stranger, good-looking but surprisingly inconspicuous. His jacket was of a nondescript colour. All in all, he was rather ordinary – but there was a spark Molly found quite puzzling. She turned back to Meena.
The dog was now lying next to John peacefully, its head resting on its front paws. John couldn't fathom why it liked to be squeezed under a bed when he could have gone just anywhere in the house, but clearly it did. John had waited for a while before trying to leave, and then it had been too late: the children were back in their room, and the manul realized that Gus's company was in fact much better than theirs. So far, so good.
You can see the news dawn on her almost literally. Her eyes widen, her face falls, and she slowly looks up at you.
Even though John couldn't speak, Sherlock knew exactly what he would want to say: he knew he'd say "cup" because he'd never think of himself as a manul, and was too proud to act like one. Wittingly, anyway. Sherlock grinned. This was the most fun he could've hoped for today, and he was glad John had picked a time when he didn't have a case. Well, not that John actually did pick it, he supposed.
You turn away from the window because even the rain is too bright, and your gaze falls on a piece of parchment paper laying over the libretto of Rossini's
Ueno Park is so big a park one can easily spend an entire day strolling through it. Of course, the man presently sitting on a bench, gazing at the Shinobazu Pond, did not have an entire day to spend on anything as trivial as a stroll. At first glance, he could have been taken for one of the homeless men scattered here and there throughout the park. But on second glance, it was very unlikely, for most of those in that situation were Japanese, and the man was clearly not.
"If you're waiting for me to beg you to let me give you a shower, I'm not going to do it," he murmured teasingly against his cheek. Sherlock allowed a small, crooked smile to light up his face. With his uninjured arm, he reached to stroke the nape of John's neck possessively.
Their table sat in a corner of the pub that more like a smaller version of the breakfast nook at her flat than a pub booth.  Courtesy of the thick curtains, it was the largest space with a modicum of privacy available at The Drunken Labrador, and Jamie had been more than happy to provide Mary with both the room and the time she needed to work through the current mess.
