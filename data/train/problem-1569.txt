His vision was blurred due to the excess moisture in his eyes. As he made out the fuzzy shape of Lestrade, the tears spilled over. He wiped them off his cheeks with his fist, body too tense to uncurl his fingers, turning away from Lestrade as he did so. One look at the shock and pity on the DI's face had been enough for Sherlock to guess just how broken he must look.
“John.”
“Are you sure? Sherlock this is a big step and after what you just told me-”
He was now faced with three choices. One – he stays at 221B and prolongs this torture until it sorts itself out. Two – He and John sit down again and have a real conversation about the possible solutions to the problem. This was likely to be an awkward conversation as Sherlock knew that the majority of the blame rested on him. Three – He leave Baker Street, leave John, leave London. He releases John from the stresses of their life together and allows him to move on with his life. Sherlock considered all three options carefully. He had just settled on one as the cab pulled up. He got out and moved into the park. He waited there for John, deciding on how he was going to approach this. It would be painful, messy. But it would be better for John in the long-term. Sherlock closed his eyes and began to imagine how the conversation would take shape.
All he'd need was his gun, a chance meeting, and a bulls-eye shot to Moriarty's head.
"Well, you can tell Alvarez that I'm not interested. If he wants to talk, he can bring himself to me." If John was able to, he would have been stood up, hands curled into fists at his side, but the chains prevented him from doing so, he was just relying on his voice to try to intimidate these men.
A strong arm gripped him under his shoulder, another encircled his waist and held him upright. John could smell the gunpowder, tea and mint. It could have only been Sherlock. Sure enough, the tall, dark haired detective was helping the doctor to a nearby bench. He sat John down and knelt on the floor in front of him. He took John’s face between his hands and looked at him straight in the eyes.
“But-”
He walked away from his life. From his family. From his work. And most importantly, from Sherlock.
It was three weeks before John saw Sherlock again. It wasn’t for the normal, predictable reasons of John leaving something at the flat or just accidentally bumping into each other on a day out. No. This meeting was quite out of the ordinary.
“Stop the cab!” The vehicle stopped abruptly, causing Sherlock to lurch forward in his seat. He hastily opened the door and burst out onto the pavement. A few pedestrians gave him weary looks as his tried to remember the process of pushing much needed oxygen in and out of his body. His hand hadn’t left the door of the cab. He turned to demand the cabbie to explain to him what the hell had just happened, and was met with the same manic and crazed smile that had just been taunting him from the small, interior screen.
He moved slowly through 221B, feeling oddly disconnected, going through the motions until he ended up in his chair. Sherlock pulled his legs up towards his body, wrapping his arms around them like a child and resting his forehead on his knees. He refused to cry. He had cried enough over John Watson and his broken heart.
time of night?”
Shit.
He was stood on a rooftop, presumably Bart’s Hospital from the look of the street below. The wind was swirling around him and he could feel a trail of tears running down his face. His arms were stretched out to the side, like angel’s wings and he took a step forward, off of the edge of the building.
“He slipped and fell and dropped almost everything. I ran over to help him pick everything up. He told me that I must have been his knight in woollen armour. He had the most appalling sense of humour, but he made me laugh. The first thing he said and it made me laugh.”
to get us through this."
“… well I certainly learnt from the best when it comes to…”
Sherlock began to clear away the remnants of their tea drinking. John followed him with his eyes. Contrary to popular belief when Sherlock was not in his mind palace or playing his violin or suffering from memory loss, he was a very considerate flatmate. John believed that he was constantly trying to prove to John that it was worth staying. Sherlock had always seemed afraid that John would move out if he wasn't considerate enough to him. This fear was illogical. Yes, John had moved out, but that was to live with the woman he loved, who had put him back together after he ha fallen apart when Sherlock jumped. He had not moved out because Sherlock was no good to live with.
Sherlock sprawls on the couch and adjusts himself through his swim trunks, letting out a soft moan at the pressure against his aching cock. He palms himself more firmly, as images of warm, wet skin invade his mind. He wonders, if he were to press his lips to John’s, would he taste like the sea itself? Would Sherlock be able to pull the sunlight through his flesh, taste it on his tongue? He’d like to start with that one drop. That irritating invader, suck it out of John’s navel, press himself closer and devour him, bit by bit, drop by drop.
The flat was bursting with music, laughter, and noise. Fairy lights draped artfully over the mantle and wrapped loosely around the enormous pine tree nestled in the corner of the sitting room. The scent of mulled wine mixed with Mrs. Hudson’s mince pies filled the air, overlaid with the lower notes of smoky warmth emanating from the fireplace. John called it ‘festive’.
John sniffs. “Something I said?”
“No, it’s fine. I’ve never seen this before. Just never took you for a bloke that was into ballet,” John laughed, elbowing Sherlock lightly.
The first press was tentative, a tender slide of lips, and Sherlock thrilled to learn that John’s mouth was as soft as it looked. John reached up and threaded his fingers into Sherlock’s hair and deepened the kiss, touching his tongue to the seam of Sherlock’s lips. Sherlock opened to John, and John immediately took advantage, licking into Sherlock’s mouth and sucking his bottom lip between his teeth. Sherlock moaned, and wrapped both arms around John, grasping at his back, pulling him closer.
“John. I- I love you.” Sherlock leans over, resting his head on John’s, silent sobs racking through his body.
“John,” Sherlock moans, hooking his ankle over John’s and rolling his hips. The hand on John’s cock speeds up, pulling back the foreskin on the downward stroke and adding a flick of the wrist at the tip, the way John likes.
“John, please. You can’t…”
Like some poor person’s morgue fantasy
“Oh.”
When he can think again, he opens his eyes to find John watching him, small smile playing on his lips. Sherlock wants to taste it, so he does exactly that, the kiss languid and less desperate than before. He pulls away and John repositions them, wrapping his arms around Sherlock’s middle and lying back against the cushions. Sherlock tucks his head under John’s chin, content for the moment to just soak up his warmth. Neither speak for several minutes, each just enjoying the feel of naked skin and soft brushes of fingertips.
“God John. You are a marvel.” He pressed kisses to John’s inner thighs, his other hand still wrapped around his cock and stroking in time to the thrusts of his fingers in and out of John’s body. “More?” He asked.
Just as John was about to open his mouth to say either
“Sherlock, what are you doing?” John breathes, more confused than ever at the sight of Sherlock in his bed.
Sherlock rolls over and admires the view as John makes his way out of the bedroom, smiling softly at the events of the last hour or so. John’s voice startles him from his reverie as he calls from the doorway, “If I had known getting caught would inspire this though, I’d have yelled for you a long time ago.” Sherlock can hear John’s giggle follow him down the stairs. He can’t help but join in. They really are a couple of idiots.
“Do ye agree?” John asked stopping just in front of Sherlock.
I love you, Sherlock. I always will. No one can ever mean to me what you did. No one. Please wherever you are, know that.
“I’m sorry? I what?”
Sherlock could hear some cheers and clapping from Molly and Greg, and even Mrs. Hudson, and suddenly it felt all too much like a game. A setup. And he needed to get away.
“Yes, John.” Sherlock sighed, snuggling down into John’s chest. “Could you...hold me a little longer?”
Sherlock takes his time, using his hands to press John’s cheeks in and out, opening him up, all the time licking broad stripes across John’s perineum, up the crack, and down, teasing stripes, no where near enough.
“Did you-” he started, but Greg cut him off.
“Shut up, John and dance.”
“I know! I know, okay. It was a bit not good. He probably thinks- Oh god, do you think? He thinks I have another date.”
Sherlock’s brow furrowed, his smile faltering slightly.
(Yes, because of a fridge)
“That’s my favorite tradition,” he breathed, smiling at Sherlock.
Sherlock had barely acknowledged John’s presence the entire car ride back to Baker Street, directing most of his attention to the window. John, on the other hand, had been intent on him, his eyes trailing over his face, his body, watching for any sign that Sherlock was about to succumb to the drugs he had taken. He could feel Mary’s stare on him the whole time, watching hotly through the passenger visor mirror, angled into the backseat. John wanted to scream. He thought he’d have a chance to talk with Sherlock as soon as they made it back to the flat, but again, Sherlock had other ideas. Unfolding himself from the back of the car, he all but slammed the door shut in John’s face, whispered a terse, “I’ll be in touch, be safe”. Then he was gone.
A fridge, shiny new and clean,
“Hmm?” John replied, thumbing through the rest of the paper. “Or we could play a game. Not cluedo though, never again.”
“Yeah?”
Sherlock laughed, “You know, I think I might have just have developed a newfound fondness for mistletoe, myself.”
-------------------------------------------------++++++-----------------------------------------------------------
It was 3 am about one month and four days after John had moved back in that things came to  a head. Startled awake from where he had fallen asleep watching telly, John was surprised not to hear Amelia’s cries, but a familiar baritone softly rasping from his bedroom upstairs. Curious as to why Sherlock would be talking to his sleeping daughter at 3 am, he crept up the stairs to have a look. Standing in the doorway to his room, John knew the sight that greeted him is one he would not soon forget, nor would ever choose to.
Suddenly a list, of angers, peeves and wants
“Oh Sherlock, so much. Shall I show you?”
John pressed open mouthed kisses to Sherlock’s collarbone, biting gently, and Sherlock moaned, arching his neck to encourage more of John’s explorations. John moved lower, flicking his tongue to taste his neck, sucking lightly at his suprasternal notch. Sherlock groaned and grasped John more firmly, dipping his head to recapture those wandering lips. There was nothing chaste about this one, it was hot and hungry, and Sherlock felt he was being devoured, arousal beginning to pool hot and heavy in his groin.
Sherlock shifted to press a small kiss to the underside of John’s jaw. “Thank you,” he breathed.
“In that case, remind me to surprise you in the shower more often.”
John leans down slowly, putting his weight on his forearms and pressing his body impossibly closer to Sherlock’s. He stops just millimeters from Sherlock’s mouth, needing to be absolutely sure before closing this last gap.
John throws his head back and laughs. The sound of it breaks something wide open inside of Sherlock. It echoes off the walls and settles into his bones, the sound of pure anguish. He hates that it is coming out of John’s mouth.
Arms, lips, hands and teeth,
There had to be a way to fix it.
As if by summoned by the power of John’s thoughts, the man in question sauntered out of his bedroom, long legs striding across the sitting room floor in four paces. He stopped in front of John’s chair, placing his hands on his hips and staring down at John.
As he comes back down to earth, it is with the feeling of John curled up beside him, his head resting on his shoulder, absently tracing circles on his chest. Sherlock hadn’t realized he had moved. Sherlock turns his head and chases John’s mouth, licking inside and tasting himself on his tongue.
“You.”
“John, god,” he cried, his body squirming harder under John’s touch.
“He has.”
“You’re beautiful, Sherlock.”
John rubbed his hand along his nape. Ah. He’s not entirely sure what he said, but there may have been a few choice words in that litany. John looked up at Sherlock ready to apologize when Sherlock cut him off.
Socks, new and unused in the drawer,
“John, ohhh,” Sherlock cried out, pushing back forcefully, his hips stuttering in their movement, as John thrust his tongue into his body, opening him up. Sherlock reached down and took himself in hand, stroking himself in time with John’s mouth, fucking himself on John’s tongue with each rock of his hips. John could tell he was losing control, his entire body stuttering and shaking as he sobbed John’s name. John couldn’t hold back any longer, he snaked a hand down his own body, wrapping it around his cock as he continued his assault.
Keeping one hand on his cock, Sherlock shifted to press a tender kiss to John’s left thigh, directly above the bandage covering his wound. The sweet gesture nearly did John in. “John, let me? Please?”
John chuckles, his chest shaking Sherlock’s cheek. “You’re welcome. Anytime.”
“Jo-” He shoves two fingers in his mouth, sucking hard to keep from calling out the name that is on the tip of his tongue. He moans around the digits, lifting his hips to fuck into the tight circle of his fist. He is so close, his orgasm pressing closer with each thrust.
“I’m going to take a shower,” John says as they enter, “unless you want to go first?”
Sherlock’s heart was beating frantically. Could John really be saying-? He had to know for sure. He turned his head back, capturing John’s eyes with his own. “Who?” he whispered.
Another shuddering breath. “H-how wicked?”
“John—“
Sherlock starts to explain, it’s clear he wants John to leave. Typical, John thinks, the bloody sod trying to play the hero, do everything on his own. John’s had enough of his lies, his half truths, his games.
“Do you own a kilt, John?”
“Oi!”
Knowing what he did of Sherlock, seeing how he was with his daughter was eye-opening, to say the least. Sherlock didn’t actively seek her out, didn’t pick her up, change her nappy or anything of the sort, but he was softer. He moderated his voice when she was napping to keep from waking her. He started keeping all the nasty toxic experiments downstairs in 221C, which he rented specifically for that purpose. He was careful about allowing clients into the flat while she was present, preferring her to be at Mrs. Hudson’s. Little things that John noticed, each one threatening to overpower the slim hold he had on his feelings regarding his flatmate and friend. Each time Sherlock did something, well, nice, John was tempted to pull him into his arms, kiss those ridiculous lips, and tell him how bloody grateful he was to have him in his life. It was only a matter of time, really, until something bubbled over. And then where would he be?
Sherlock makes his way to the theatre, flipping down his coat collar on the way, and fluffing up his hair. He’ll try for non-threatening first, if he can help it, see if that will get him the answers he needs. Try to be a little less the arse with the ridiculous cheekbones and turned up collar. Memories of John in Dartmoor temporarily make him pause, a small smile playing at the corners  of his mouth. He shakes his head and continues on, eventually reaching the information desk.
“Sir? It’s your brother.”
“Why’s that?”
“Wait, what?” Sherlock cut in, raising his head to look at John and narrowing his eyes. “What did you say?”
John’s eyes go soft. “I’d take the real you over a dream any day.”  He leans down and presses a chaste kiss to Sherlock’s mouth. “But now I really do need a shower.”
Sherlock broke away to kiss down John’s jaw, sliding his hands down and under his T-shirt. John lifted his arms and bowed his back allowing Sherlock to pull it off. Tossing it over his shoulder, Sherlock nipped and kissed his way down John’s neck, pausing to suck a love bite on his collarbone before dipping lower. John growled, his back arching off the bed as Sherlock took his right nipple into his mouth and sucked.
John rolls over to his back, groaning when he realizes he is hard, his erection impressively tenting his pyjamas. Easy to understand, the dream been so realistic. Miles of pale skin under his lips, that long, lean body laid out like a feast below him, inky curls spread like a halo on the white pillowcase. Those pale eyes heavy lidded and narrowed in pleasure as John sucks marks into the alabaster flesh of that sinful neck. And christ the sounds. In his mind, low moans intermixed with his name falling from those perfect lips.
John decided to take pity on him, and not force him to ask outright. He unfolded his legs and opened his arms, letting out a small ‘oomph’ as his lap was suddenly filled with 183cm of consulting detective. Sherlock curled his frame into the chair, arse resting on John’s thigh and legs folded up between John’s other leg and the arm of the chair. He wrapped his arms around John’s shoulders, burying his face into his neck and breathing deeply. John lifted his arms to wrap around Sherlock’s back, one hand threading through Sherlock’s curls. He lightly scratched Sherlock’s scalp, and Sherlock sighed, melting into his embrace.
Sherlock sighed. He could never refuse John when he used that voice. He’d grant him anything.
“Because, my love, in the course of solving said case, where did we end up?”
“I ended up in the Thames,” Sherlock mumbled.
Blissfully they pulled up at the curb in front of 221b before much more could occur, which is a close thing, because honestly John was about to attack Sherlock again, cabbie or no. They climbed out, and John tossed enough money at the cabbie to make him forget what he saw. Sherlock fumbled with the door, and John couldn’t resist, pressing up against that lanky body and wrapping his arms around his waist to palm at Sherlock’s cock through his trousers. Sherlock growled, finally getting the door open and they surged inside, Sherlock immediately spinning around and claiming John’s mouth. John moaned into the kiss, and pushed Sherlock until his back hit the wall, pressing his body against his until they were connected thigh to chest. Sherlock snaked his hands around John’s hips to grab at John’s arse and pull him closer, bending his knees slightly to align their erections. He whimpered into John’s mouth when John sucked his lower lip between his teeth and bit lightly, his hips rutting against Sherlock’s of their own accord. John broke away, needing to have that neck under his mouth, his tongue.  It tasted just the way he always imagined, musky and sweet, and slightly tangy, just like the man himself. He pressed open mouthed kisses down that long column, pausing to suck a mark into pale skin. Sherlock tilted his head to the side and grabbed at John’s head, threading his fingers through his hair.
Sherlock stopped breathing. John was kissing him. John. But why? Why now? Was it just the mistletoe? Would John have kissed any person he found in this spot tonight? Or was he special? He wanted to be special.
“What you didn’t anticipate, Mycroft, is that he wasn’t going to allow her to hurt me. It was me she was aiming at. I didn’t expect his interference, either,” Sherlock adds quietly, returning his gaze to the window and finishing his cigarette.
I helped subdue Sowersby, of course, which leads to us both being wet, and filthy.”
His love. Sherlock stops pacing and slumps on the floor, wrapping his arms around himself. He feels lost, adrift in fear. He’d lost John to Mary, but at least he’d have a spot, a place in his life, fulfill a role. Be a mate, a best friend. But now, now what is left for him? If John dies, all the light in Sherlock’s life will be extinguished. His conductor of light. He doesn’t think he can survive it.
“John, listen to me,” Sherlock starts, eyeing Mary warily where she stands five feet to his right, “now is not the time, we can discuss things later. But you need to leave. Now.”
Sherlock broke away, panting, sitting up suddenly. John was about to protest, about to physically grab him and pull him back down, when he realized Sherlock was removing his clothing in quick efficient movements. John watched him disrobe, mouth going dry as each bit of pale skin was exposed.
John could feel it, the need to put all his emotions into his lips, his tongue, his mouth, to show Sherlock just how much he loved him. Needed him. Wanted him. He was desperate for more, eagerly sucking on Sherlock’s tongue, holding him in place as he plunged into his mouth again and again. Sherlock was giving back as good as he was getting, his hands trailing down John’s neck, grabbing at shoulders, hips, snaking underneath to grasp John’s arse. The sound of their moans echoed in the room, Sherlock’s needier whimper tempered with John’s desperate growl.
Sherlock threw his head back and sighed. “Husband. Jewels are a ruse. Clever use of the freezer, she was ‘cold as ice’.” He rolled his eyes, flopping on the sofa face down and letting out a long-drawn out moan. “Why are the criminal classes so boring?”
“Damn right.”
From behind the closed door he could hear the sounds of a party suddenly going dead. Vague murmurs, John’s voice, scraps of dialogue reaching him where he huddled alone on his bed. He heard Greg clearly as he left the flat, “I’m sorry, John.”
The next morning John woke feeling refreshed and content, and made his way downstairs. The flat was quiet, Sherlock’s door still closed. John took a minute just to soak up the fact that he was back here in 221B, the place he always considered home. Smoothing his fingers along the back of his chair, he realized that the flat he shared with Mary was just that. A flat. Never a home. Never he place he felt whole.
“Oh? Do tell.”
“Beautiful,” John whispered.
“Good morning, John,” Sherlock answered, warily watching John’s face for any sign of distress at their current positions.
“Come here, love.”
Parentlock!
“John, I have another confession,” he whispered.
A sound on the stairs makes him pause. He normally would rail against the invasion of privacy, but tonight, he has a sudden desire, a sudden need, to not be alone.
-----------
Even already flushed, John could see Sherlock’s blush deepen, the red blossoming from his cheekbones outward. It was incredibly endearing. He moved up Sherlock’s body, pressing soft tender kisses, meant to soothe rather than arouse, until he reached his mouth. He sucked Sherlock’s, frankly illegal, bottom lip into his mouth, lightly tracing his tongue along the edge. “Anything. You can have anything.”
I think again over what we said, and I can hear it. Can you?
True, the last case had been a doozy. A serial murderer that had led them a merry chase for nearly four weeks before he finally was captured. And in that four week period, Sherlock had barely eaten or slept, riveted and determined as he was on the puzzle in front of him, much to John’s dismay. After the case ended, he had climbed into his bed only to emerge a full 18 hours later, looking no better off. It was at that point John made the case for the holiday. Too tired and uninterested to care, Sherlock had let John do all the planning. Not to mention the packing. Which is how he found himself in his current situation, without a say in where they had ended up. John chose it based on what he liked.
John lifts his left hand to Sherlock’s lips. “Lick,” he commands.
John shifted her hands forward a bit more, her thumbs brushing lightly over Sherlock’s mound and slit, covered still by the silk of the panties. She rested her head on Sherlock’s hip, using just the pads of her fingers to tease around Sherlock’s most sensitive areas, until Sherlock was practically sobbing, begging, squirming with the need for John’s hands on her heated flesh.
+++++++++
John smiled. “Oh. Mmm.” John kissed him again, capturing Sherlock’s sigh. “I always mean what I say. Which do you want? Do you want me to fuck you? Or did you want my mouth?”
“It is now.”
Sherlock raised up on her elbows to look down at John sprawled between her thighs. She looked so gorgeous, flushed and sweaty, her hair a riotous mess from Sherlock’s fingers. “So are you, John. You’re transcendent.”
“Kiss me, John, please.”
“John,” he panted when the broke away again, shifting his body so that he was leaning back against the headboard and bringing John down with him. John threw one leg over both of Sherlock’s, straddling his hips, and leant down to suck Sherlock’s lower lip into his mouth. Sherlock arched his pelvis, gasping when he felt a hardness matching his own. He trailed his hands down John’s back, over each spinal joint, lower and lower, until they finally came to rest on John’s arse, pulling him flush against his body, connecting them from chest to pelvis. John growled low in his throat and rolled his hips, the move bringing their erections into alignment.
“Did I miss something?” Molly asked, confused. “I thought that would be a good thing.”
“Christ, Sherlock, you feel incredible,” John moans, rocking his pelvis upwards to align their erections.
John blames it on the fact that between cases with Sherlock involving late night stakeouts, and shifts at the clinic, it had been nearly 72 hours since he’d had any real sleep. Trudging home, dead on his feet, he climbed the 17 steps to the flat hoping just for some quiet. He hoped he’d make it to his bedroom, but John had slept a lot of places in his life, and at this moment, anywhere horizontal would work. The smell of smoke hit him as he paused on the top step, and for a fleeting moment, he considered walking back out of the flat. Surely Mrs. Hudson had a sofa he could crash on. But the sound of a crash and a muttered curse had him flinging the door open to find what can only be described as mass chaos.
John did just that, sealing his lips over Sherlock’s, and wasting no time running his tongue along the seam. Sherlock moaned, and John licked inside, tasting the sound and chasing more. Sherlock wrapped his arms around John’s shoulders and held on as John ravished his mouth again and again. With one final bite to that lower lip, John pulled back, observing his handiwork. Sherlock looked wrecked. And beautiful. Lips swollen, hair mused.
“Greg, is it?” Sherlock asked, removing his own shoes and pulling his leg behind him into a stretch. “Tsk, tsk, Molly.”
Sherlock looked up sharply at John’s words, his face heating with the praise lavished in his direction. He his eyes scanned John’s face, searching for any trace of a lie.
John chuckles around him, the vibration sending sparks shooting up his spine. John pulls off, stroking him firmly with one hand while he grabs the bottle of lube with the other. “I’ve dreamed of this Sherlock. So many times. I’m going to savour this.” John slicks his fingers and slides them down, past Sherlock’s balls, over his perineum, teasing at the crack. John watches Sherlock as he pauses, all the while continuing to pump his cock with the other hand. “Yeah?”
Because John is sure of two things. One: that was the best orgasm he has had in a long while. And two: he is pretty sure he screamed Sherlock’s name as he came.
“You asking me to dance, John?”
“John.”
Sherlock leaned into John’s touch, closing his eyes, and rubbing his face along his palm, almost cat-like. It was too good to be true. John wanted him. Had wanted to kiss him. Did he still? He forced his eyes open and shifted nearer to John on the bed, unfolding his legs and moving closer until their faces were nearly touching.
“Oh fuck,” Sherlock whimpered.
But it’s always the same, brown sand turning black as the man’s blood runs out of his armor, mixing his essence into the Afghan dessert. John never knows who it is, it changes every time. He only knows he needs to run, run until his lungs are burning, staying low to keep himself out of the line of fire until he can reach his fellow soldier’s side and turn him over to begin his work. This is his job, but proximity and repetition don’t make it any easier to handle. He reaches the man’s side and rolls him to find pale silver green-eyes staring up at him, mahogany curls thick and matted with blood. That isn’t right, he’s not here. Not here. Not here.
The flat was devoid of milk, making the tea a tasteless adventure.
“I had to meet with my advisor. Why?”
Sherlock smirks, eying John’s frame speculatively. “Then you’d best hope your next move isn’t too far a stretch.”
He scans the area where he was just standing, looking for the familiar figure and what he sees causes panic such as he has never known to rise in his chest. Because crumpled on the ground not three feet from where he fell is the prone figure of John Watson.
Sherlock nods, but doesn’t turn. “I’ll be right out.”
John reaches down and entwines his fingers with Sherlock’s and together they work him, the water splashing around them. John thrusts his hips faster, fucking into the tight circle of their fists, his free hand digging into the flesh of Sherlock’s thigh hard enough to leave bruises.
“I’m sure I do not know, however, he was quite adamant that you be kept in the dark of his involvement. For your protection, I believe,” Mycroft adds, as an afterthought.
“You are staying, aren’t you, Sherlock?” He’d asked, trailing his fingers down Sherlock’s shoulder and lightly squeezing his bicep before pulling away to wrap around his own goblet. Sherlock had frozen, his pulse racing. Unable to speak around the sudden lump in his throat, he had taken a sip of his wine and nodded.
A soft knock on the wood, then “Sherlock?”
John reaches back and grasps wet curls, twisting his head to press their mouths together. It’s messy and uncoordinated, all desperate tongues and too much teeth, but John doesn’t particularly care at the moment, he just needs to feel Sherlock’s mouth on his.
Sherlock changed quickly, steadying himself with the mundane tasks trying to keep his mind off the bitter disappointment at the fact that John was not there to greet him. He tried to shut down the billowing emotions, considering what his next move should be. He didn’t really want to go back to the flat tonight, he wasn’t sure he could face John,  face the fact that John didn’t want him after all. But neither did he want to be amongst others, go to the cast party that was sure to be a raging bore, pretend to be happy when he was really anything but.
“I detest rugby. But I quite like watching the captain play.”
He finished his ablutions quickly and wrapped a towel around his hips, sauntering out to the sitting room to find Sherlock sprawled on the sofa deep in thought. Mind palace then. That wouldn’t do.
“The game is never over, John but there may be some new players now. It’s okay. The East Wind takes us all in the end.”
Mary, however, moved over and sat down on the sofa, right in Sherlock’s eye line if he were to look up from his laptop. And he did, the moment she sat down and tucked her feet up on the sofa with her. John watched Sherlock regard her for a few moments, and then he began to speak.
Sherlock opened his mouth to say something, but Mycroft chose that moment to barge onto the rooftop with a team of men and Anthea behind him. He cooly regarded the scene before him, before signalling Sherlock and John forward. Mycroft's team began the clean-up process as Mycroft and Anthea escorted them down to the emergency room to be checked over for any injuries.
“Why? You’ll leave, and you’re supposed to be helping me.” The tone of Sherlock’s voice was accusing, as if he were trying to guilt John into staying. “I thought you’re supposed to be my friend.”
John was careful to stop after only two. He wanted to take the edge off, but if he was going to go back and face Sherlock after what had happened, then he'd rather his head were clear. Sherlock might have post-traumatic retrograde amnesia, but that did not stop him being Sherlock. And being Sherlock meant cutting, sarcastic remarks, insults of his intelligence, yet more deductions and just generally being a git. God, the man had lost five years but couldn't lose that bloody arrogance.
Fine. How is he? - Molly x
Furthermore: Mycroft and Molly had known.
It was less than a minute before he got a relpy.
Mycroft arrived at Bart's before John had, setting everything up for his stay. It would be at leas two weeks, if he survived. He stood outside the operating theatre, pacing backwards and forwards, anxiety flooding through him.
Lestrade had arranged everything, made sure there was a statement released about Sherlock’s return and scheduled a press conference for the next day. They knew it would make the headlines, and this time, Sherlock wanted to make sure the facts were correct, and they were addressing sensible, mildly intelligent people – as intelligent as you could get whilst working in the media, how tedious, thought Sherlock. He did not want a repetition of what had happened with that Kitty Riley woman.
Then, John did something he'd really not wanted to do. He went to Mycroft.
Then, like a gust of wind through the dancing dust in the light, their equilibrium had been thrown out of balance. John now needed to pay even more attention to try and balance their lives out again. One blow to the back of the head, that was all it took, and Sherlock had gone down like a ragdoll, unknowingly dragging their lives down with him. One blow to the back of the head.
Sherlock smiled at John’s choice of vocabulary. Sometimes he forgot just how intelligent the doctor was. “Honestly, John. When could you ever brand me as ‘stupid’?”
"No, John. It's
He nearly let himself be taken by the darkness engulfing him, but John would be in danger if he left, and nothing could be allowed to happen to John. It is with this thought, provide by his inner-Moriarty, that spurred him to get back to the surface of consciousness and live. He fought hard, and he fought for John, he needed to keep John safe.
Sherlock considered this for a moment. “There is obviously something else troubling you. Please don’t hold it back to spare my feelings.”
“Do you really think we haven’t already taken every single course of action Dr Watson? We have searched every street in the city, gone through every tape from the past week and there has been nothing. He has been taken from right under our very noses and there’s not been a single trace we have be able to find to track him. So you honestly think I would have let this pass me?  Just given it to my brother for him to play around with so he would get bored? This is the British government John and I’ll be damned if you think I am not taking every precaution and available measure to ensure we find him!” Mycroft raised his voice during his outburst. His face was flushing, but after a minute he composed himself and adopted an aloof expression – the default for Mycroft - as if John was beneath him. Sherlock almost pointed out to him, that John was a much better man than Mycroft, but held his tongue, reminded of something. Sherlock was instantly taken back to his childhood.
.” Sherlock’s voice was cutting and sharp, and John felt himself physically flinch away from the deep and dangerous tones lacing themselves through Sherlock’s words. Very much like the man John had first met during the case ‘A Study In Pink’, and the tiny flame of hope that his best friend could still be in there, tucked away in a forgotten corner of Sherlock’s mind palace, was extinguished with those two words.
“Something happened today that scared me. I was walking around and someone dropped papers from their window, and it created this huge storm cloud of white, and it just reminded me of the smoke. I started to cry right there in the streets.”
There was a harsh screeching noise as Sherlock suddenly cut off his playing. Greg fled back into the room, panicking that some,thing had happened to him. Sherlock had resumed his staring out of the window, and Greg was just about to turn and leave again when he heard it. A small, quiet voice, cracking and raspy from disuse, but could only be coming from one person.
“No! I refuse-”
Maybe everyone was right. He needed to get out of the flat.
Gradually, it seemed like the foundations of their friendship were beginning to lay themselves back down. Sherlock still wasn't fully trusting of John, nor did he remember any of their shared memories, despite the fact that he had read each and every entry on John's blog, twice. Every now and then, he'd say or do something that reminded John of a time before, but as soon as anyone pointed it out Sherlock would close up again and leave.
“Because you are my best friend, and I didn’t want anyone else to stand there with me as I got married, because if it had been anyone else, the role of ‘best man’ would have been completely meaningless. You were the only one I wanted for the job.” John’s eyes never left his hands, not even after he finished talking.
“Yes.”
“This is hard. Much harder than I thought it was going to be.” Mary did not offer advice, for there was none to give. Neither did she give John pity, for which he was grateful. He could not stand to have anyone’s pity.
. Absolutely nothing."
Mary had come again. She bought John a fresh set of clothes and kept an eye on Sherlock as John went to get changed. She’d forced John to eat something, telling him that starving himself wasn’t going to do any good to anybody. John reminded Mary of how much he loved her. Anyone else would have treated him like a child, like he was something delicate that need to be protected. Mary wasn’t like that. She knew what John needed, and made sure that he got it. What John needed now was a rock, something stable to hold onto whilst his life was whirling around him in dizzying circles.
"He was incredibly lucky, a few centimetres to the right and we would probably have lost him. Many people have it a lot worse."
Sherlock let John assume that he was apologising for the meltdown. He never told him that he was actually apologising for the hurt and agony that he knew John must have experienced when Sherlock jumped. But Sherlock left John to his assumptions. After all, there was a dangerous game to win.
Sherlock knows what love is. And it is the very person who believes he is incapable of such an emotion - admittedly because that's what he led them to believe - that caused Sherlock's heart to race, for his mind to fill with impossible images as a smile and a slight flush creeps along his features.
“How is he? How’s John?”
"Do you do that often?"
"You really should get out a bit more, Sherlock, and definitely eat  more. I can count your ribs from here."
Sherlock seemed to be the only one unaffected by this, his expression remained the cool mask of indifference that he seemed to adopt in these situations. And – unless John was very much mistaken, which he often wasn’t in regards to Sherlock – he thought he could see a hint of a smile playing around the corners of his mouth.
There was the sound of a car pulling up, and John saw the shape of a London taxi out of the window. Sherlock would have approved, London taxi’s being his preferred method of transport. Mary held open the door for him. He wrapped his arms around her again and kissed her. She made him promise to at least text her when he got there, and waved him off as the taxi began to move away. He sighed and pulled out his phone. He typed out a message and sent it.
John continued to cradle Sherlock to him, tears streaming down both of their faces, continuing to whisper reassurances to each other, to reaffirm that they were both here, both still alive, and that they’d never be leaving each other again.
Greg had kept his fury buried deep under the surface, focusing instead on the fact that John Watson was alive, and Sherlock was with him, just as they always should have been. But he promised himself that if he ever saw the smug, smarmy face of a certain government official, he wouldn’t hold himself back.
John and Mary had been watching a film, curled up together on the sofa, just enjoying each other’s company. Mary had picked out a soppy romantic-comedy, the kind that made John cringe from the sheer awfulness but Mary seemed to enjoy. For John, nothing could beat a classic Bond film, but it was not about what John wanted. If Mary wanted to watch a ridiculous rom-com full of fluffiness and flimsy plot-lines, John wasn’t going to object. There had been a knock at the door. John got up from the sofa to answer it. He had been answering the door, the phone, Mary’s phone, their emails, everything since they got back from the hospital. Sherlock had been standing there in all his glory, scarf, coat, collar, even the gloves. Both men froze.
“You are the best thing that ever happened to that man Sherlock Holmes and don’t you forget it.”
‘I may not understand sentiment, but I do recognise it. And this must be what it feels like.’ Sherlock thought. He cared for the doctor just as the doctor cared for him. Not in a sexual way, or in any way that would cause them to be a couple. No, they didn’t work like that. But they knew that they would risk their lives to save the other. Hadn’t Sherlock already proved that?
“In love? With John?”
“And Sherlock? How’s he?”
“Why haven’t you been here Mrs Watson?” The deep baritone purr resonated throughout the flat.
"I would have thought that was glaringly obvious. Do use your eyes, Sherlock."
John could do nothing but stare at Sherlock, who now looked so agitated that John feared for his safety. Danger. A quick glance at Mycroft told John that the same thought had crossed his mind
"Caring is not an advantage."
“I was scared Sherlock. You left without any warning, then out of the blue you turned up on the door-step without even giving me a clue that you were still alive.”
“We talked about getting a dog. John like bulldogs and I liked Irish setters and we couldn’t settle. We even spoke about children, but decided that we shouldn’t have children until we had settled on a dog. We should have just bought a bulldog.”
This could be it, the beginning of Sherlock’s memory returning. But he mustn’t get his hopes up yet. This was a start – a good start – the best. But baby steps.
“Now, look here,” began Lestrade, clearly about to tell the man that it was not his business and John’s private affairs were not the reason for this conference. However, John cut him off before he had the chance.
"Have you at least done any experiment's?"
John was trying harder that anyone else. His face was screwed up in concentration as he shoved at the door with all the power that years of rugby training and military service could give a person. His efforts were constant. All his attentions and focus was on the task at hand, and despite reaping no successes, he continued to fight against it with everything he had. His eyes never moved from the black wood, and he seemed like a singular force that stood out amongst the group effort.
Sherlock physically pushed John out of the door and closed it in his face. Still feeling struck dumb, John descended the stairs and left for his honeymoon.
“All the best, John Watson.”
Lestrade ran his hand through his silver hair, obviously stress was high and tensions were mounting.
Sherlock's heart broke at the pain in his friend's voice. He could not allow that to happen.
Mycroft’s face hardened as John waited for a reply.
"Me?"
John nodded. His breathing was still heavy, and the possibility of this still being a dream, a trick his subconscious was playing on him as a new form of torture, was not off the cards just yet.
“Sherlock?”
How could so much go wrong so quickly? And what had John ever done to deserve any of this? If Sherlock’s situation had been pulling at the seams, what was going on now was like someone taking the sharpest pair of scissors and tearing through the fabric of John’s life, until nothing was left except tiny, unsalvageable ribbons. Impossible to sew back together.
His priorities were conflicted between the tow people in the other room. He loved both of them very dearly, in different ways. They’d both unknowingly saved his life. It was unfortunate that in one case, he couldn’t return the favour.
John's eyes snapped up. Moriarty took the phone and saw exactly what John and Sherlock had planned. For the entire gathering on the rooftop, Sherlock had placed his phone in his coat pocket, and he had been on speakerphone to Mycroft for the whole exchange. Mycroft would no doubt have recorded the whole conversation which would be enough to convict bot Moriarty and Moran, and several high-ranking officials from the government would be on their way to arrest them at that very moment.
Sherlock, my Sherlock.
"So, replacing me with Molly, are you?"
John turned his head slightly, so he was able to see Sherlock out of the corner of his eye. Only John knew Sherlock well enough to recognise the subtle look of amusement on his face. It wasn’t obvious. There wasn’t a smile at his lips, or a huff of air meant to be a laugh. It was more like a shadow on his face, and only someone who’d spent much of his or her time with Sherlock could see it. John resisted the urge to burst into laughter as he suddenly realised that he must be the only person in the world to see it. Clearly Lestrade had not, or he would have probably granted them a few more moment of amusement before speaking.
John felt the hand on his arm give a feeble squeeze as Sherlock managed to whisper into the night.
John was speechless. Sherlock couldn't possibly have said that about him. But it was very much like Sherlock to sneak around trying to gather information about John if he wasn't sure, rather than confronting John himself.
“Oh, some undercover work in Eastern Europe.” Sherlock ignored the images of Serbia that flashed through his mind, focusing only on the man before him.
Mrs Hudson was hyper-aware of the man stood next to her, sensing that he did not want to talk. He had not wanted to talk sine the day the stone was put in place. He seemed entirely focused on the words that were now immortal. Soldier, Doctor, Friend. But he had been so much more to Sherlock. There was not a name for what had happened between them, but friend just did not seem to cover it. Sherlock's face was not schooled into an expression of indifference, as it so often was. It looked entirely full of... nothingness. That was the only word she could produce to describe it. His eyes were empty, as if he was staring straight through the gravestone. But there were small creases by his eyes, which Mrs Hudson knew was a sign that Sherlock was desperately trying to hold back tears.
“Sherlock,” John leaned up on his elbow to look down at Sherlock, brushing a thumb across one of those ridiculous cheekbones he loved so much. “I’m not going anywhere. I’m here, yeah? If a bullet couldn’t keep me down, a knife certainly isn’t going to,” he chuckled.
Sherlock lets out a whimper, grasping ahold of John’s arms and letting himself be ravished by John. John is relentless, nipping and sucking at Sherlock’s lips, his tongue. John breaks away, breathing hard.
Sherlock coaxes him through it, peppering soft kisses up his neck, and continues to stroke his softening cock until he is too sensitive. John melts back into Sherlock’s body, sated and boneless, and wonders how this man knows exactly the right way to please him.
John grasps Sherlock’s hand, intertwining their fingers, and responds with his own weary smile. The touch has provided John with a touchstone, a talisman to hold fast to. A tactile reminder of the here and now. John likens it to a lifeline, a rope tossed to a drowning man, something to pull him out of the depths and into calmer water.
Sherlock feels the body in his arms go limp. The heartbeat beneath his fingertips is slowing where he is applying pressure. His blue scarf is nearly purple, stained and wet with John’s blood. Sherlock knows that paramedics have been called, no doubt thanks to Mycroft, he can hear the sirens in the distance getting closer, can hear Mycroft’s men surrounding them. He’s grateful for his brother’s influence, for once, because he doesn’t want to let go of the man in his arms. Not ever.
“John?”
“What’s got you so distracted?”
Sherlock glanced at his phone for the tenth time in the past hour. 12:52 AM. No calls. No texts. No answer to the attempts he had made to reach out to John. And it didn’t appear as if he was coming back tonight. With a sigh, Sherlock pulled himself off the sofa and walked over to his bag pulling out the playbill for tomorrow’s show and the ticket. He laid both on the kitchen table, with a note, then retired to his room and climbed into bed.
Sherlock turned his head sharply towards John, brow scrunched as he studied him. Apparently finding what he needed, he smiled, rolling on his side to face John. He reached over, taking John’s hand, and placed it on the side of his neck, just above his pulse point. “Then I’ll never leave.”
“At the docks, but..”
John sniffs. “Something I said?”
Sherlock smiled at that, and in the streaming moonlight it made him look younger and vulnerable somehow. John felt something in his chest expand and spread throughout his body. “Come here,” he whispered, shimmying out of his own pants and tossing them aside.
“John, please,” she breathed, not even sure what she was begging for. Something, anything, to stop the intense throbbing that was growing between her legs.
John turns to look at him, his blue eyes blurry in the dim light.“Y’ok?
, he thinks, as his cock gives a twitch. He leans up and presses a tender kiss to Sherlock’s lips, once, twice, before pulling away.
“I was afraid to. I’d had a bad time with... friends once they found out what I did. In my experience, rugby players don’t like ballet dancers.”
John’s eyes are soft and slightly wet when they meet his own. He swallows, then wraps his arms tighter around Sherlock. “Sure, love. That sounds perfect.”
Right now was currently floating their way into the door, all six foot of waterlogged detective in a sodden Belstaff, curls plastered around his ears like a disgraced cocker spaniel. His eyes were cast downwards in an attempt at contrition, but John wasn’t buying the act for one moment.
John gives a tiny hum, then moves down to press kisses to Sherlock’s abdomen, swirling his tongue inside his navel, before unfastening Sherlock’s trousers and tugging them and his pants off in one go. Sherlock is spread wide, his cock jutting proudly upwards and leaking on his stomach and suddenly he feels self-conscious. John leans down and presses his lips to Sherlock’s hipbone before trailing across to the other and sucking gently.
John worked her way down the bed until she was between Sherlock’s legs. She carefully eased them apart, her hands massaging and caressing Sherlock’s inner thighs from knee to groin. Long strokes alternating with circular brushes of her thumbs as she got closer to the juncture of hip and thigh that kept Sherlock guessing as to what John was going to do next. Sherlock was trying to remember to breathe, every cell in her body alight with need, with hunger, for John. Her hips shifted restlessly on the bed, an ache building in deep inside, the need to be touched almost overwhelming.
John repeated her attentions on the other nipple, adding a bit of teeth that had Sherlock nearly whimpering. John chuckled. “You could probably come just from this, couldn’t you? We should try that next time. Experiment.”
“God help me, I do.”
“I don’t want to come like that.”
“Then why…”
Sherlock stared back, brow furrowed. “You mean that. You have wanted this.”
“Christ, Sherlock, you are so responsive. I hoped you would be, but god. Look at you.”
“John, please. You can’t…”
Come find me on my tumblr
Come find me on my tumblr
Sherlock nodded. “Yes, John,” he breathed.
“John, J-- oh god. Stop. Please.”
Then Sherlock went off and shot Magnussen. For Mary. To ensure her safety. John didn’t know what to think. On one hand he was grateful that the spectre of that man was gone. But on the other, he was terrified for what it would mean for Sherlock. And for him. A week later, he found out the price. A mission to Eastern Europe. For six months, or so he thought. John wanted to shout. Sherlock again running off and leaving him behind.
“No bloody way.”
“John,” Sherlock breathed, lifting her arms to pull John down on top of her. The feeling of John’s fully clothed form on top of her naked body felt better than it had any right to, and she moaned into John’s mouth, eagerly exploring the wet depths with her tongue. John broke away, pressing kisses to Sherlock’s neck and shoulders, moving lower, her hands stroking Sherlock’s sides, inching closer to the underside of her firm breasts.
“John, listen to me,” Sherlock starts, sliding his eyes to Mary, “now is not the time, we can discuss things later. But you need to leave. Now.”
“For how long?”
John leaned up on his elbows to watch the incredible sight laid out before him; Sherlock flat on his stomach, rutting into the sheets as he swallowed around John’s length. At that moment, Sherlock looked up at him, those grey green irises nearly black with desire, hot and hungry on his own. John rubbed his thumb along Sherlock’s jaw. “So good, so beautiful, Christ.”
“John,” Sherlock breathed. John moaned, the sound muffled by Sherlock’s skin. The two of them were still making a pretense of dancing, there was some movement, but any further and it was going to cross into public indecency.  John slid his hands off Sherlock’s cock, causing Sherlock to whimper in protest, and spun him around. Sherlock’s eyes were blown, nearly all pupil, his chest heaving. John reached up and threaded his hands through those curls he’d dreamed of touching for so long and pulled his head down, until his lips were just a breath away. “You want this?”
John moans, his hands threading through Sherlock’s curls. Sherlock smirks and moves lower, pressing his lips to first one hipbone then the other, before moving lower still. John’s cock is gorgeous, thicker and longer than he had dreamed, and gloriously wet. Sherlock aches with the need to learn John’s taste. Cautiously he swirls his tongue around the head, pressing slightly into the slit. Sherlock moans, and wraps his mouth fully around John’s cock, pressing his tongue to the underside and taking him in as far as he can.
“Oh, John, yes,” Sherlock cried out, releasing John and using his release to provide extra lubrication for his own cock. He raised his hips off the bed, fucking into his fist, John’s weight on his legs warm and wonderful. He opened his eyes to find John watching him, that softness mixed with hunger that pushed Sherlock over the edge.
Sherlock chuckles at that, a deep rolling sound that vibrates through him, mixing with John’s breathier giggle. Sherlock reaches down and pulls John up, claiming his mouth again, the giggles dying out to the sound of shared moans and gasps, as John presses his body on top of Sherlock’s on the bed. Sherlock lets out a low growl when he feels John’s cock heavy against his own. And hard. Impressive, that.
“No, Mrs Hudson, you don’t have to go.” John looked apologetically at her, before shooting murderous glances at Sherlock and Mycroft. If looks could kill, the Holmes brothers would be sharing a grave. But they couldn’t, and both men remained very much alive.
"He told me that he appreciated all that you've done for him, and that he didn't blame you at all for your argument. And he thanked me for letting you stay with him whilst he recovered." Something stirred inside John, probably guilt or remorse, although John would figure it out later, when he wasn't so focused on his wife. It really wasn't Sherlock's fault that they'd argued – John had received devastating news and reacted badly. He never meant to lash out like that. Of course he cared about Sherlock. He and Mary were the two most important people in his life. Mary didn't notice the inner monologue that was streaming through John's head, because she continued.
, nothing was going to hurt him, but that didn't stop his mind flashing back to his time spent away, to the endless violence he'd endured at the hand of a faceless crony or soldier. He had not been like this immediately after he'd returned. Sherlock blamed the accident. He was sure he'd received some sort if damage that left him emotionally compromised like this.
John would have been perfectly happy to never see another hospital again. He was developing a very strong dislike of them, but who could blame him after the amount of time he'd visited them over the past year. At least this time no-one was unconscious or hooked up to any machines.
"He's dead, Mycroft."
"He didn't know.” Lestrade shrugged. “He just told me that something was missing, completely unrelated to the investigation."
"Sure... whatever you say, Sherlock.
“Yeah you probably did.” Both men laughed lightly. “Thank you for coming. It meant a lot to both of us that you still came despite… you know.”
A rasping voice whispered his name from the bed. John watched as Sherlock screwed his face up, before rapidly blinking, trying to open his eyes, calling out once more.
“Six months, my brother estimates. He’s never wrong.”
,” Greg snarled, a dark shadow crossing his features. “You let us grieve. You knew this whole time and you didn’t tell us.”
Despite her offer, John still insisted that he made the tea. He collected three mugs from the cupboard above the kitchen worktop, ignoring the petri dishes that had also managed to find their way up there.
“We got married in September, which was our favourite month. When I say it was our favourite I mean that it was John’s favourite and therefore mine by proxy because I believe favourites to be a pointless construct.”

Sherlock ran his hands through his long curls. He really needed to get them cut, but that would risk exposing himself too soon. As they agreed, only when John was ready. Sherlock had been ready from the word ‘go’. Mrs Hudson saw the look on Sherlock’s face, and a stab of pity went through her chest. He tries so hard, she thought.
Thrown down like a challenge
Truth be told, I went in search of him just as often, seeking to quell the desire that lay between us during our waking hours, desire that for propriety and our own safety must be carefully hidden away and confined to darkened rooms in our flat. How I longed to have him beside me always, be permitted to caress those defined cheekbones, pull that lithe body close, press my kisses across those lips whenever the desire struck me. But, society dictates it not to be so, and we must confine ourselves to the roles of Detective and Doctor, friends and consultants, never more while the sun is alight.
Come visit me on
“M’glad you’re ok. Sorry.” John says, his words faint, before closing his eyes.
“Alright, git. My go.” John’s spin finds him with right hand yellow, forcing him into a crouch. Because of the position of Sherlock’s last move, his head is now level with Sherlock’s inner left thigh. He’s not directly brushing against it with his shoulder, but it’s close, and if he just moved slightly to the right -
“So beautiful. So responsive, Sherlock. You’re amazing.” John crooned, before dipping her head to trace her tongue in the valley between Sherlock’s pert breasts.
“Of course”
“John?” She asked, turning back around.
, and then laughs. Clear and cold, the sound falling like pinpricks on his skin. He wants to throttle her, shake her until she stops laughing.
“You’ve gotten better at lying, dear.”
Needing to feel his lips again, John tugged on Sherlock’s hair, relishing his moan at that, and pulled him up, slamming their mouths back together. John gave as good as he was getting, eagerly stroking Sherlock’s tongue with his own, and sucking on that frankly gorgeous bottom lip. Sherlock broke away panting and leaned back, removing his shirt and trousers. (No pants, the vain hussy.) John admired the efficient striptease, his legs spread and bent, one hand cupping himself through his pants.
Mary’s retort snaps him out of his thoughts. “It’s not at all the same,” he growls, glaring at her.
John is shocked by what the surgeon is telling him. He hadn’t realized it was that close. Mary almost killed him. Another half centimeter, and he’d be dead. He’s also impressed. She really was a good shot, the wound he carries is identical to the one she gave Sherlock.
“I’m pretty sure I have a blanket somewhere that would do,” remarked John. Both men froze and there was a moments silence, before the erupted into hysterical laughter. People walking past shot them strange, wary looks, but the men were so overcome with laughter that neither of them noticed. In that simple statement, some of the tension between then disappeared, the string became slightly looser, and they felt the more comfortable with each other than they had done since Sherlock’s return
"What for? There's nothing of interest for me out there, not without your company."
John's pulse began to race. What wasn't he ready for? His whole body tensed as he heard a hand come into contact with the doorknob. He rose from his chair, ready, waiting for his mysterious visitor.
He wouldn't have wanted it any other way.
“And what makes you think I am not decent company Mrs Watson?” He held out his hand and Mary immediately took it. She shoved him playfully with her shoulder and John kissed her temple. They continued to tease each other for the duration of their walk back to Baker Street, by which time, John was in a considerably better mood.
John had texted Mary as soon as he’d jumped out of the taxi. He’d walked up the familiar steps to the black front door with the brass lettering. He had traced his fingers over the numbers, before finally taking the spare key that he’d kept when he moved, and letting himself in. Mrs Hudson, the dear, sweet, kindly old woman had been waiting for him to arrive. They had shared a quick, tear-filled hug – mainly from Mrs Hudson, John had done his crying and now he needed to at least appear strong for the people around him.
A woman - the new Sergeant, John assumed - was stood with her back to them when they entered the room.
"Mycroft, what's happened?"
Across London in Angelo's, Molly's phone chimed in her pocket. As she read it, she dropped the glass of wine in her hand covered her mouth with the recently emptied hand. Tears sprung to her eyes at the news of John's injury, but he was home.
At the same time, John wanted to hold Mary close. He wanted to tell her that everything was going to be alright ,and he wanted so desperately to believe it himself.
There were several visitors for Sherlock the next day. Lestrade was the first to make an appearance. He looked exhausted. There were dark shadows underneath his eyes and his shoulders were more sagged than usual. He was worn. He tried to lighten the mood by cracking a joke about the amount of paperwork he’d have to fill out, but John did not want to laugh. He did not want to do anything. It was only a short visit, and Lestrade left to continue with the case.
Please don’t take my-”
“We found him, Greg. But that’s not important-”
They were sat at the dining room table, opposing each other. It was easier to talk when they were face to face. Sherlock had waited for a few days after the visit to Mary's grave to approach the subject of Moriarty. Despite popular belief, Sherlock was not tactless. John needed the time before jumping back into the game. Sherlock had talked over breakfast, explaining everything he knew or could guess about Moriarty's goals as John read his newspaper and finished his toast.
Satisfied that Mary wouldn’t be waking up any time soon, John excused himself to chick his phone. There was only one thing. He had a new voicemail. John dialed and held the phone to his ear.
He and Mycroft were sat on the uncomfortable chairs at either side of Sherlock's bed, although, since John had retreated into his morbid imagination, Mycroft had vacated his seat and was now pacing near the partially open window, speaking rapidly into his mobile phone as he did so. Sherlock himself had removed himself from under the sheets and was now sat cross-legged on the blue blankets that the hospital provided as a poor replacement for a duvet. Sherlock was fully towards John, and John subconsciously leaned forwards so Sherlock could speak to him directly. Sherlock also leaned forwards, although his actions seemed more deliberate. Their eyes locked and didn't break apart throughout the entirety of Sherlock's monologue.
John smirked and bit gently, causing Sherlock to practically buck them both off the sofa. “So sensitive. God you’re gorgeous like this. I want to kiss every last inch of you.”
“Six months, my brother estimates. He is never wrong.” I couldn’t meet your eyes on that. Did you see? I couldn’t keep the waver out of my voice, try as I might. I didn’t want to alarm you, never, but did you hear? Did you?
Although that had gone better than it could have, one thing was for certain. He was never telling John that he was a dancer.
to know what you liked. What you thought. Yes, what you desired. I find myself, even now, wondering what it is your heart desires.
John was eventually able to get his body to stop shaking so violently. Sherlock’s words, his presence, doing enough to reassure him that he was real. This was real. Sensing that John had relaxed, Sherlock moved to roll off him, but John stopped him, threading his hands through  Sherlock’s curls and holding him in place.
“Good evening, brother dear,” Mycroft says, retreating back behind the tinted glass, the icy facade in place once more.
“I believe that’s twice now today I’ve yelled your name.”
“Easy,” Sherlock says, appearing to read his thoughts. “I’m observant.”
“Sherlock, it was just a minor wound. I told you that.”
Since he was a kid he has loved listening to the patter of raindrops hitting the roof, the sound soothing away the arguments and shouts ever so prevalent in his house. In the army, rainy days were rare in the desert sands, but when they came, they helped chase away the grime and dust and oppressive heat that was an ever present companion.  And even now, rainy days are their own special reward.
The fury in his tone makes Sherlock suck in a breath. He never realized that John thought Magnussen was for her. For Mary. Never for Mary. After all this time, how can John not know that Sherlock did that for him? To protect him, to keep his family, the life he had built for himself, safe? For his child, who Sherlock truly believed existed. And maybe, if Sherlock is being honest, it had something to do with the humiliation to which John had been subjected. Anger such as he had never known seized him, watching those slimy hands touching John. Taunting John. It was too much to be borne. Magnussen was one murder Sherlock cannot say he regrets dealing out.
“John,” he sighs.
“Mycroft?”
His voice roused me from my maudlin thoughts, and sighing, I had flung myself out of my bed and dressed quickly, ready to follow the madman on our next adventure. From that moment, there was no chance to rest as Holmes traipsed us up and down the English countryside. In the end, as always, Holmes proved triumphant. There was a moment, a fleeting breadth of a second where I had longed to pull him to me, for watching him in the midst of his investigations never fails to bring about a rise in affections for this beautiful man. But instead, I only had language to explain the heated emotions coursing through me.
“Tea?” you’d ask.
“John, for god’s sake, what are you doing here?” Sherlock is hoping his voice sounds annoyed, because in truth he’s terrified. He needs John to leave this instant. He’s trying to think of the fastest way to get him to leave when he catches Mary watching him out of the corner of her eye. He schools his expression, attempting to calm his racing heartbeat, and turns away from her, focusing on John.
“Watson!”
They’d decided the bath was the best idea after the suspect they were chasing dragged Sherlock into the Thames, that ubiquitous scarf providing the leverage needed to haul him into the river. Of course, this necessitated John jumping in after him, wrestling the suspect into submission and dragging Sherlock out of the water. One soggy handcuffed criminal, a laughing Lestrade and a sodden cab ride later, they made it back to the flat, stripped out of their clothes, and climbed into the bath. A perfunctory wash to get the river smell out of their bodies and Sherlock’s curls, now they are just enjoying the chance to relax together. Truth be told, John is relieved to have Sherlock alive and well, the reassuring feel of his heartbeat a welcome presence against his back. Too close today.
The arch of his back causes Sherlock’s cock to slip between his arse cheeks, and they both groan at the sensation. “Christ, Sherlock,” John pants, rolling his hips. The feeling of Sherlock’s erection sliding between his cheeks and brushing over the sensitive entrance to his body making him shiver.
Sherlock could only nod, as he didn’t trust his voice to speak. He watched as John turned back around, slamming the door behind him.
“John,” Sherlock moans, rocking his hips back. John presses in further, swirling his tongue around Sherlock’s hole, slow movements that have Sherlock babbling and begging, cries of his name, and “please” falling from his lips. John takes his time, laving and sucking and piercing the trembling muscle, and Sherlock is crying out for more. He moves one hand off the sofa, reaching down his body to stroke himself, only for his hand to be gripped by John and placed back on the leather.
John was so lost in his fantasies of how the rest of the night was going to go that he completely missed the thumb’s up that Sherlock threw blondie as they rushed through the club door.
John groaned quietly and lifted the pint glass to his lips, eyeing Sherlock over the top. For his part, Sherlock appeared to be completely oblivious to the inner workings of John’s head, downing his own drink and tapping with his gorgeously long fingers on his mobile. He also, thankfully, was oblivious to the dozen or so other men who apparently had the same ideas as John running through their heads. John had been throwing his best
Stag night. Another wasted moment. He was almost positive John was making a move that night, the hand on his knee, fingers pressing into the flesh just above the bone. Both of them, tipsy with alcohol, pulling ever closer into one another’s orbits. How open John was that night, how lovely he was lost in drink and laughter. Sherlock sometimes wonders what would have happened if he had returned those tiny advances, would John still had gone through with the wedding? Or would they have simply tumbled into a pleasurable mistake?
"Oh, God." There was moisture in his eyes and he did nothing to prevent the tears from spilling over. His knees gave way as he dropped to the floor, hands still clasping John's desperately.
The first envelope he address to Mycroft.
The word was screaming in John’s head, whirling around, removing every other thought it was possible to possess and replacing it with that one word.
He could feel the tiny fractures spreading throughout his body, a physical and an emotional pain coursing through his veins, over his skin, throughout his entire being. He felt as if his chest was being squeezed, struggling for air. He gasped in as much air as he could, but his lungs burned with every mouthful, and each breath out became a heartbroken sob. Tears streamed down his face, burning trails of heat over his cheekbones. He stumbled forwards, trying to steady himself on the arm of the sofa, eventually giving up and just siding to the floor. His hands wove themselves into his curls, tugging painfully; trying to ground himself amidst all of this emotional pain he was experiencing.
He desperately wished that John would stay, would leave Mary and give Sherlock what his heart desperately wanted. But that was a fool’s wish.
“Sherlock,” John warned him as Sherlock went to protest again.
“221 Baker Street.”
“I’m the best chance of solving this case, Annalese and you know it.” Sherlock threw his comments over his shoulder, never taking his gaze from the evidence wall, eyes dancing over all the paper and photographs attached to the usually bare, grey wall.
"The soles of a shoe worn by a person putting up a struggle against something, presumably the man who were abducting him, digging his heels in to try and stop the attack."
It had been 2 months since he watched his best friend, Sherlock Holmes, fall, or jump – John wasn't sure which word to use in the context.
Her face was absolutely breath-taking, and oddly familiar. Sharp cheekbones that could cut diamonds, full lips, pale skin and glittering, pale blue eyes.
Serbia. He hadn’t waited for backup. He’d bee shot. Hence the hospital and the pain killers. Shot twice, John prayed he’d never reach the lucky number three. Hopefully his new wound hadn’t got infected and left such a large scar as the one on his shoulder.
"Mycroft, if you didn't want me to get into this computer you should have chosen a less obvious passcode, or at least change it at least once a month. Failing it would be advisable to change your keyboard every so often because I can clearly see the most typed characters and it's not a difficult leap to figure out which order they go in-"
After taking out yet another of Moriarty's associates, John would await his next location, not so secretly hoping that he could go home. He had been very vocal about it.
"You don't understand. Everything we were is in that flat. It's embedded into the wood of the table, it's woven into the fabric of the cushions. It's in the dust, the wallpaper, the very air. Everything is tainted with memories of
‘I’ll be alright,’ he whispered to himself, desperately wanting to believe in his own words. But the lie was just too big. He didn’t feel ‘alright’ at all, and he felt like he never would.
A hand came to rest on his shoulder. A strong, steady hand which wasn't shaking. If Sherlock looked down, he would notice that his own were shaking quite violently. He turned his head slowly to the hand on his shoulder. His eyes continued to follow the arm attached to it until he saw the face of Lestrade. Sherlock noted that Lestrade's eyes were filled with an aching sadness, there were more lines to his face now, and he looked exhausted. The last case had drained him. It had drained the entirety of Lestrade's team. It was tough, for everyone. Especially Sherlock.
“That’s very distracting,” Sherlock murmured.
A soft rustle of fabric and the sound of a chair dragged against a floor alert him to the fact that it's someone else. John turns his head to the side and opens his eyes a crack.
“It seems we’ve been a pair of idiots, then.”
Regrets of another kind also flood his brain. Why, why did he wait so long to tell John how he felt about him? Why couldn’t he have said something sooner? So many chances wasted. Teaching John to dance. Their bodies pressed in close, the scent of John in his arms making his skin flare and flush, trying desperately to control the shivers that traveled through his veins each time John’s hands brushed his back, his shoulder blades, his waist. It would have been so easy to close the distance then, give into the temptation and tell John that it has always been and always will be only him. Ask him to reconsider his choice of Mary. But Sherlock was afraid. So afraid. Of hearing John give his usual replies, denying the spark that has always existed between the two of them. So he stayed silent, played his part, nothing more. Even though it felt more and more like death, every time.
And if he’s being completely honest, the game is also an excuse to get close to Sherlock. Since he’s been back at Baker Street, there has been a tension between them. Something simmering there, just under the surface. They seem to be dancing around the elephant in the room, and John is tired of it. He knows, has known for a while to be honest, that he is in love with Sherlock. Sometimes, he thinks Sherlock might feel it too. In quiet moments there is a softness in his pale eyes, a fondness that goes deeper than pure friendship. And even though he is not one to respect personal boundaries normally, with John the boundaries are nonexistent, Sherlock oftentimes propping his legs in John’s lap while watching telly or on one notable occasion falling asleep on John’s shoulder in the back of a cab. He wants desperately to make a move, but at every turn it seems he is thwarted. Either by a case, or his own fear and stubbornness. Or for the past four days, the stroppy tantrum of the object of his affections. John has had enough. And ok, it’s juvenile, but at least it’s a game where touching is allowed. And if something more were to happen, well, John can’t say he’d be too upset about that.
John sat across from him and dug into his own dinner, and the two shared an easy silence, broken here and there with talk of the day, upcoming rugby meets, exams, but for the most part they just existed, calm in a relaxed ease that felt warm and comforting.
John finally startled awake and sat straight up in the bed, the duvet pooling around her waist. Her hair was in wild disarray, her chest heaving as she tried to calm herself from her nightmare. Her eyes searched frantically in the darkness, looking for the source of the noise that woke her. Sherlock decided to make it easier for her friend.
Sherlock wants a cuddle.
“Please, Sherlock. I need you.”
With a moan, Sherlock unfolds himself from John’s lap. He’s so close, the slightest touch will push him over the edge. Without warning, he finds himself twisted onto the sofa, sitting, his legs spread, and John swallowing him down. Sherlock cries out, his hands instinctively coming up to cradle John’s head as it bobs between his thighs. John lifts one of Sherlock’s legs over his shoulder and presses two fingers inside his loosened hole, rubbing directly at his prostate, and Sherlock is lost, his orgasm careening down on him like a tsunami, white hot and sparkling, and so hard, he thinks he loses consciousness.
“I’ll be right back, John,” He said, slight slur in his words.
“Tell me, John, how does one win this game?”
“Hi,” John said, eyes twinkling with merriment.
“I love you, you know.”
John stops his movements, pulling the towel back from his face. “Sherlock?” he asks, the concern evident in his voice. He wraps the towel around his waist and steps closer. “Are you alright, you look flushed.”
“Sherlock?” John’s voice has gone deep and gravely, and he leans toward where Sherlock is still lying prone on the couch. He is close enough that Sherlock can see the moisture clinging to his skin, and his arousal flares to life again, his need making it difficult to breathe. “God, Sherlock, can I -”
Sherlock opens the door slowly, pausing before stepping all the way in.
John is breathing hard, his chest flushed and heaving. Sherlock can see his pulse beating rapidly, and his eyes, his eyes are hot molten pools focused on Sherlock. As he watches, John’s eyes travel from his bare chest to his hand on his cock, and his tongue darts out to touch his bottom lip. Sherlock bites back a small whimper. Sherlock’s eyes rake over John’s body, and he lets out a small gasp at the obvious tenting of the towel. John’s eyes flick back to his own.
John settles down onto his side facing Sherlock and closes his eyes, trying to relax enough to fall back asleep. As soon as he does however, he sees those sharp cheekbones, bloodied and broken, blood seeping from that pale temple as he lies on the concrete. John lets out a low whine, and instinctively reaches out his hand to touch that wrist, one last time…
Sherlock stares down at his hands, John’s blood staining the pale skin a vivid red. The medics are rushing John away, frantically working to keep him breathing, bundling him into the waiting ambulance. Sherlock follows behind blindly, feet moving of their own accord, his brain completely taken offline. Images of John, and blood, and the light fading from those deep blue eyes. He reaches the back of the ambulance, and moves to climb in, but is stopped by a firm hand on his shoulder.
John brushed his knuckles over one cheekbone. “Sherlock, can I - ”
“Christ, that’s good,” he breathed.
“Fuck, Sherlock,” John grated, smearing kisses against Sherlock’s cheeks, his neck. He reached down and grabbed Sherlock’s thigh, encouraging him to wrap his leg around John’s hip.
“God - Sher -” John bites his lip to keep from moaning his name. He is pretty sure Sherlock is not in the flat, something about body parts and Barts, but John doesn’t take any chances.
“Molly,” Sherlock called, “I’m not entirely comfortable with the last part of the pas de deux, can we go over it again?”
Sherlock could only nod, her breath coming too short to allow for speech.
Sherlock turns towards John and sits up, resting his head on his hand and looking down at him. “Love?”
“I could ask you the same.” John turns and meets Sherlock’s eyes, and what Sherlock sees makes his stomach twist. John is angry. Deadly angry. And not entirely only at Mary it seems. John turns back towards Mary, fixing her with a sneer.
“John, it’s fine. I can see when I’m not needed.” She stood up and made her way out of the flat, pausing to kiss Sherlock and John on each of their cheeks and hugging them tightly before she left. “It was a wonderful meal John, thank you,” she spoke into his ear as she wraped her arms around the shorter man.
“Sherlock said you might find it hard to be here by yourself.” So, that was who he had been texting. “I think you need to come inside.”
"Sherlock."
John Watson, his best and only friend in the world, was not dead.
John had not forgotten her. No. Far from it. But with very recent developments,she had not been at the forefront of his mind. The mention of his wife bought yet more emotions to overwhelm John, especially now, as Sherlock could finally remember and appreciate her for the woman she had been.
“Oh you’d find a way.”
“No, Sherlock. It’s okay. You just have to lie still, it’s okay, you’re here next to me. You don’t need to say anything.” John pressed the button that would call for the nurse.
John had left him. John was happy with Mary, a type of happiness and passion that Sherlock would never experience from John, or that Sherlock would never himself feel. Sherlock could feel his insides tearing at him, he felt open, raw, exposed - and yet still numb.
“No, we’ve had a scan. We’re pretty sure it’s a girl.”
John hadn’t told Mary about the last time he saw Sherlock. In all honesty, he was ashamed of himself. He knew he had a temper, and that it could get quite nasty sometimes, but what he said to Sherlock was just cruel. He didn’t want Mary to think badly of him – not when their time was so limited. It made sitting in the same room as him increasingly awkward.
