She pulled out of his embrace quickly to point and glare at him as she said, “Never do that again, do you hear me?”
Dean looked like he had something else to say about that, because of course he did, but thankfully Cas cut them off before he could open his mouth again.
“What about this do I not seem okay with?” he asked breathlessly, making his point with a roll of his hips.
Cas smiled at him, a soft little thing, and Dean felt his chest fill up with warmth as he let himself be dragged the rest of the way down the stairs. It was more than he’d ever dreamed of hoping for, having a hand to hold in the face of the great unknown, but he knew for damn sure that he was never letting go.
He brought his hand up in a fist and punched the tree in front of him. The bark stung as it scraped across his knuckles, but he punched it again and again until he knew he was bleeding. He stopped then, if only because he didn’t want to have to explain to Sam what he’d done, and leaned back against the tree behind him instead and closed his eyes. Honestly, he wasn’t sure himself why he’d done it.
Dean watched as his deft hands poured the whiskey in two impossibly even lines before sitting the bottle back down on the counter. He picked up one glass, and Dean did the same before clinking their cups together.
Still, with all that newfound freedom and happiness, Dean was never made to sit still for very long. He eventually got so restless around the bunker that Sam finally snapped and practically pushed him out the door, arguing that some fresh air would be good for him and Cas. Eileen’s tongue in cheek smile betrayed his real motivations, but Dean had agreed anyway.
“And all that stuff about family and compassion and... love,” Dean said, swallowing roughly around the word as he held Cas’s gaze. “Me too, Cas.”
Dean stopped and honed in on one of Barry shaking a younger man’s hand. Then he shook his head and turned back to Sam and Cas.
Dean looked back then, and Sam watched the recognition click into place. Dean schooled his face into its normal appearance immediately and slapped a bewildered Cas on the shoulder.
It was disconcerting, seeing Dean like this. He was still himself, but a much lighter version. He looked at Cas with an almost youthful innocence that was both endearing and disarming at the same time. If Cas had felt protective over Dean before, the instinct was amplified tenfold now. And his soul… well, it had always shone more brightly than any other human’s Cas had ever seen, but it shone differently now. It made Cas ache to see the proof of the irreparable damage Dean’s upbringing had wrought.
After a moment of listening to Ramble On, Cas said, “I never really said thank you for the tape you made me.”
Dean jumped and turned around, and Cas motioned for him to join him as he popped open the Impala’s trunk. He stared at the contents of the armory for a moment. He wasn’t as familiar with where the Winchester’s kept everything as he maybe should have been at that exact moment, but he dug around until he found the bullets he recognized as capable of killing witches. He pulled out two guns and loaded them each with a handful of the charmed bullets.
Gunshots rang through the house as both of them fired, and the woman fell to her knees and then to the floor. Rowena fell, the witch’s control no longer holding her up, and Cas barely had time to check on her before he heard the sound of footsteps barrelling down the stairs.
Cas wasn’t sure how to respond at first. Involuntarily, he felt his body tense. Dean must have felt it too, because he sat up quickly, already rattling off, “I’m sorry. I’ll just, go over there.”
After all was said and done, and Rowena had lifted the curse from Dean, they found themselves back at the motel room packing up another job well done. Sam walked Rowena out, presumably to make sure she didn’t sneak away with the grimoire, which left Cas and Dean alone in the room as Dean shoved things into their bags.
Dean’s expression brightened considerably, and he nodded. Cas scooted over, making space for Dean to sit against the headboard with him, and Dean followed easily. Cas waited for him to settle down before he began.
Sam clapped him on the shoulder and squeezed once as he stood up and left the room, leaving Dean alone with his whiskey and his thoughts again.
Sam sat his beer bottle down on the map table with a heavy clunk and said, “She’s tracking a werewolf out in Nebraska.”
They still took cases sometimes because the monsters didn’t disappear when the world stopped ending. That day, it was a vamp nest with an extra side of weird. They’d stumbled across a particular nest that liked to dress up as mimes, and it was creepy as hell, but watching Sam’s wide-eyed reaction to their clown-like appearance had made the whole thing worth it.
at Cas, who was sitting next to him on the edge of the bed. It was honestly a little creepy, and Sam was sure that if it had been anyone other than Cas, they would have noticed by now. Whenever Cas did glance in Dean’s direction though, Dean would turn away quickly like he’d been caught. About the fifth time this happened, Sam stopped talking and looked directly at him.
The autopsy results only confirmed what they suspected, which was that they were dealing with a witch. The hex bag found in the victim’s stomach was the only damning evidence they needed. So, without waiting around to answer more questions from the weirded out locals, they both decided it was best to take their research back to the motel until they could turn up any new leads.
Dean, however, was just looking between the two of them with a bright, awed expression. He said, “Dude, I can’t believe I shot a gun. That’s
“Maybe,” Sam replied. “I gave her some lore to work with and told her to call us if she needs back up.”
Dean actually wasn’t sure if he was going to or not, to be honest. He knew Sam was curious, and it wasn’t exactly fair for Dean to be keeping the details to himself because Sam and Cas had been friends too. It still felt too raw to even think about though, much less talk about. He kind of thought that not saying it outloud might be the only thing keeping him from falling completely apart.
Stocks. Stocks were going well. The local football team had won something. There was a sale on oak furniture.
“This man,” Cas says with disgust, pointing back at the image, “doesn’t have any freckles. Dean does. He has a multitude of them over his shoulders.”
In front of the door at last, Cas’s heart is beating against his ribs, aching at the idea of seeing Dean again. He’s just on the other side of this door, and Cas can’t wait another second. Making quick work of the lock, he enters a dark room.
“What are you going to do about a job?” Dean asks quietly, not wanting to break the atmosphere that has settled over the two of them.
“But look!” She said, drawing out a pendant of some sort that had been hanging from the beast’s neck - it looked like a tooth with some sort of green stone in it. “Oh, so this is how you were controlling him!” She said, yanking it off the creature’s neck. “‘Dean will forever protect and heal Castiel,’” she read with a grin. “How precious,” she said, tossing the thing into the lake.
Cas can hear the exasperation in the man’s voice, but he follows the orders coming through his goggles. “Yes, sir. I’ll double-back and check every possible place he could be hiding.”
They wade through massive forests of the kelp-like plants, reaching heights of at least ten meters in most places. The plants that have saved the planet, at least their corner of it, have yet to be named as far as Cas knows. As they meander through the dense copses, Dean takes the opportunity to find the right name.
“W-was this a test?” He finally asked. “Are you going to smite me? Eat me? Take me as your… your slave?”
His options were limited here in the dressing room, and he was forced to out himself to the young ladies and beg their assistance. Of course, his story was quite different from the truth, for which he feels some remorse. He’d told them that an abusive employer brought him here, and he needs to escape. Being in a job market that often aligns itself with cruelty, they were more than happy to oblige him.
He clutched the arrow tighter. “I’ve got you Castiel. I won’t leave you. I’ll never leave you,” he prayed into his love’s now-deaf ears.
Dean immediately pull out before pumping inside Castiel slowly and deeply, each thrust ripping a whine from his love’s plush, open lips.
The Angel gasped as he opened his eyes to see what the matter was, only to feel almost immediately dizzy. Everything looked off, all the depth was wrong, it was as if everything was both closer and farther at the same time, as if he was seeing double vision, except there was still only one. The fires in the fireplace… they didn’t look
“Thank you,” he says confidently, and isn’t that a strange twist? He doesn’t recognize flirting, but he’s completely comfortable with compliments.
He rushed to save as many as he could, fueled by the rage at the thing he loved, the thing he lived for, being destroyed before his very eyes. He burned chariots, burned those invaders from the inside out, burned their weapons from their hands.
Dean glares at his brother through his many layers of embarrassment. It would figure that the one time- the one and only time that Dean breaks the stringent rules, Sam is there to catch him.
Dean smiled widely, joy filling his heart. “Do you know what we’re going to do when you’re free, my beloved?” he said, happily. “I’m going to make so much food for you. There’s so much to taste - I haven’t even given you honey, yet. You’re going to love it. And I’m going to take you so many places, Cas. You’ll pick a direction and we’ll just go, see what places we find. I’ll show you the warmth of a hot mountain spring, the joy of a field in summer, the salty breeze by the shore of the Great Sea, the cheer in a frozen lake. I’ll share it all with you,” he said, grinning mischievously. “And I’ll find out all the different ways I can please you,” he said, rutting his knot inside his beloved.
Dean’s anger boils up at the gall of this man. “You are going to do what you promised. I will not take no for an answer.”
“Castiel?” he said upon reaching the den mouth. The dark den mouth. Stale and old, littered with leaves and dirt.
The vulnerability that Dean shows makes Cas ache to hold him; kiss him until his concerns evaporate. “I regret nothing.”
But at last, he reached the foyer and shut the door behind him before finally collapsing to the ground in agony, dropping the carton, its broken contents leaking out.
“It’s all because of a plant species that evolved while we were inside the dome. It’s related to giant kelp.”
The wolf ran his hand through his hair with a sigh. “I know. I just, I wanted to protect them. Protect my brother. And I couldn’t.”
He sets his face and body language to match a perfect contestant and then coasts through the rest of the night. He claps where necessary, laughs where necessary, and gives a gracious head bob when they acknowledge him specifically.
Dean? Dean’s here? Cas darts through his own section of tables dropping off the drinks and taking orders with great haste before ducking into the bathroom to look at the disaster he has become during the night. Holy shit.
“No, it’s true.” Cas steps closer to Dean, reaching out to touch his arm, making a connection to the man he’d begun a friendship with such a short time ago.
Occasionally, Dean would flash back to his time in Heaven. He never talked about it, though, and Cas never asked. But it was going to be okay. They were going to make it. Dean was going to make it. The one he loved was back in his arms.
“You…” he breathed shakily, voice cracking, “You smell like…” At last, he felt Dean move, a hand grabbing the lapel of his suit tightly in his hand. “Not real, not real, not real,” the Omega chanted.
Screams and shrieks follow Dean from the stage. He’s sweaty after a full hour under those infernal lights. His throat is itching as it does when he puts too much power behind his voice. He clears his throat subtly and a second later, there is a tonic in his hand to help his throat heal before morning. After years of being one of the country’s sweethearts, he has found a shorthand of movements and gestures that express his needs without ever having to ask for anything. His staff is competent and attentive, so often they preemptively give him what he needs before he even realizes it.
It was the weekend - Cas’s day off. Good thing, too: he’d worked late the night before. That’s why he was sleeping in.
“It’s just,” Castiel continued, “you, Dean, you’re the only person that - that sees me for who I am instead of what I am. And I don’t want that to go away. I-” he said, voice catching in his throat. “I don’t want to lose you, Dean.”
Dean chuckled, kissing him fondly. “I’m going to show you everything, Cas. The whole world. And we’ll be together, forever,” he said, sighing softly into Castiel’s hair, unable to see how he was biting back his sobs.
This week, Dean is supposed to be working on his understanding of Buddhism because of another upcoming project. One of the highest honors a person can be given is to have the monks of the Theravada request an audience. He was granted that honor upon winning the Pageant, and would be traveling to the temple in the upcoming days.
Dean bites his bottom lip, wondering if he should follow his instincts or follow the road he’s always taken.
Dean pulled the pack from his back and set it in front of him, digging through its contents before finally espying a pouch full of freshly picked berries. “Here,” he said, pouring the berries into his hands and extending them towards the Omega.
“No, Dean, it’s real, I’m here,” Cas tried, but Dean wouldn’t stop muttering the phrase over and over, whole body quivering with fear.
In a last-ditched attempt at survival, he shoved her as hard as he could. Surprised at the move, she fell backwards off the branch.
No, no, that wouldn’t make any sense. Meg wouldn’t poison the prince’s spouse, the symbol of peace between Angels and Nagas. That would be unfathomably stupid.
After they make plans to meet again in a few days to make a trek out into the real world, Cas walks Dean to a nearby magnetic station so that he can get home.
Dean surreptitiously wiped the back of his hand across his eyes, then he turned to Cas and said, “This is probably, uh, weird, but can I just?”
It was just after Cas had given up on the pretense of watching altogether and flipped Dean over onto his back, pressing him into the mattress with kisses along the column of his neck, that Sam chose to call.
Dean nodded a little warily, and Cas could tell that the name hadn’t done any good this time. It was just like any other random set of words to the man in front of him. Dean looked at Cas quickly before darting his eyes down to the bed, hands fidgeting with the hem of the comforter.
It was about 3 AM when he wandered into the war room and stopped short because it wasn’t empty like he’d expected it to be. Claire was sitting in Dean’s usual chair in a pair of black sweatpants and a flannel covered t-shirt with her hair falling in messy blonde waves around her face, which was glaring down at the bottle of beer sitting in front of her.
Dean froze for just a moment. He couldn’t explain why, but something about the whole situation just washed over him like he’d been doused in ice cold water.
Dean took a step back after a moment and really looked at him. He looked unchanged from those final moments, as if he’d just stepped right out of Dean’s last, terrible memory of him.
It was a morning like pretty much any other in the godless universe they now lived in. Well, not fully godless, Dean supposed. Jack was somewhere out there doing his all-powerful celestial being thing, and that counted for something.
Cas opened his eyes to see Sam looking up pointedly at the ceiling, and Dean sat back on his heels and began to laugh.
Donnie squeezed his shoulder once, gently, and said, “Help yourself to whatever’s in the fridge, and stay back here as long as you need.”
The surprise addition to the household had been Claire. She and Jody got into some kind of teenage angst filled argument according to Jody’s warning text, and she’d shown up on their doorstep with little more than a backpack and a scowl on her face. They’d barely gotten two words out of her, but whatever was going on at home, apparently she thought sulking around the bunker with the Winchester’s was preferable. Dean wasn’t so sure he would agree, but that was her choice. If she wanted to be miserable and glare at her phone, she’d probably come to the right place.
They pulled into a weathered looking B&B with a flashing vacancy sign and got themselves a room before venturing out. It was the kind of place that probably had a waiting list a mile long in the middle of July, but the check-in clerk seemed grateful to see any customers at all at this time of year. It was chilly and looked like it might rain, but Dean didn’t mind. He’d started to feel a little like a kid on vacation when he’d rolled down the window of the Impala and smelled saltwater. Not that he knew what a kid felt like on a vacation from experience, but he could only imagine it felt a little like this.
“Jack,” Cas replied, a small smile pulling up one corner of his mouth. “He pulled me out and dropped me off here before returning to Heaven. He said to tell you and Sam hello.”
He looked outside then and saw Charlie there, leaning up against the hood of the Impala and staring at her phone. Instead of joining her though, he took a hard right at the front door and walked until he found himself a few feet into the dark woods next to the cabin the couple had been holed up in.
Dean stared at him for a moment, his gaze trailing over Cas’s features, before he visibly calmed. He nodded.
Before he could catch himself, Dean replied, “It’s not the same. What I’m doing, it’s not grieving, it’s….”
Her tone was like, Charlie a little to the left, and it still felt unsettling in the worst way. Dean gave her his best smile though as he slid into the booth across from her and her girlfriend, followed by Sam.
He didn’t wait for an answer before bolting out the door, keys in hand, and Dean began to laugh as soon as the door shut behind him. Cas looked at him, feeling his own amusement at the whole situation catching up to him, and Dean grinned as he turned back to him.
When Sam arrived at the diner, Dean was predictably already shoveling waffles into his mouth like it was his last meal on death row. Sam made a face as he pulled up a chair.
They hurried over to where Cas was crouched in the weeds, and when Sam shined his flashlight on the ground in front of him, he grimaced.
The drive was long, but not unbearably so, and soon enough they were parked at the diner Stevie had sent them directions to.
She stared at him critically for a moment, that world-weary look behind her eyes that his Charlie had never had. Then she gave him a small smile.
Only, when they got to the car, Dean stopped just outside the driver’s side door. He was fumbling with his keys, almost like he was nervous, but as Sam watched, he realized that wasn’t it at all. No, he was confused.
He and Cas bundled up, at Dean’s insistence because Cas seemed perfectly content to stroll out the door in jeans and a t-shirt. They were still working on the whole weather-appropriate clothing thing. Then they walked down the sidewalk until they reached the small path that led down to the public beach.
Sam held out his hand to stop them. He pointed his flashlight up at the tree a few feet ahead of them that had caught his attention. He and Cas inched forward to get a closer look, and there were bloodstains all down the bark. At the top, some sort of sigil had been drawn.
Dean was quiet for a moment, but then without looking up, he said, “That depends. Do you want me to?”
Cas’s smile widened, and he leaned back in to bury his head in the crook of Dean’s shoulder and wrap his arms around him in a tight hug as he replied, “I love you, too.”
“You were… amazing,” she admitted. Dean grinned, and Sam inhaled and exhaled slowly. He had a feeling he was about to have to intervene before this conversation went entirely off the rails.
Cas shot him a look as he scraped his chair against the concrete floor and sat down across from him. Cas was really taking the whole fragile mortality thing seriously on his second attempt at humanity, much to Sam’s genuine excitement. The two of them went on
About a million thoughts sprung to his mind at once, but none of them managed to become words as he slowly lowered his gun in dumbfounded silence.
Cas didn’t quite know what to say in the face of Dean’s sincerity, so he simply replied, “Thank you, Dean.”
Dean skidded to a stop in the doorway of what appeared to be a foyer, and Cas drew his gun as he rushed to reach his side. It was immediately evident what had caught his attention. Rowena was pinned up against the stairs, a glass shard embedded inches from her head, presumably by the blonde woman standing directly in front of them. Rowena gasped as she caught sight of them, and the woman turned to follow her stare.
“Maybe,” he admitted, “but Bobby’s got a couple hunters in the area. I’ll send them a text and see if they can look into it.”
He fell back against his pillow in a huff before turning over his phone to see the time. 4 AM. He had no reason to be awake, and he doubted even Sam was up yet. So, with a sigh, he rolled back over and fell into a fitful sleep.
Dean exhaled as a fond feeling spread through his chest and wrapped itself around his ribs. He lifted his arm and dropped it around Cas’s shoulders, pulling him into his side.
It’s not like this was a new thing. He hadn’t exactly been subtle with his attraction to the tall, dark haired bartender, and Donnie hadn’t been subtle either, but it had always kind of been like that. They drank and sometimes they flirted and at the end of the night, that was it.
“My name is Dean Winchester. Sam is my brother. Mary Winchester is my mom. And Cast..” His voice trailed off, and Cas’s heart stopped for the briefest moments. Then, with his voice a little shakier than before, Dean continued, “Cas is my best friend.”
Cas watched as Dean thought about that for a moment, and then he shrugged. He said, “Well, I think you’re pretty great.”
The desert was never Dean’s favorite scene. It had its aesthetic appeal in the wild west cowboy movie sort of way, but in reality, all that dry emptiness felt unsettling. Foreign. Like you could scream and no one would hear you for miles. Maybe it was just that he was a midwestern boy at heart who was not used to such extremes. He and Sam had hunted a chupacabra across New Mexico once though that kept them stranded in the Chihuahuan Desert overnight on what turned out to be the world’s most boring stake out. He’d never admitted to Sam just how little he slept during his turn at getting some shut-eye. It was something about the lack of trees rustling and the long shadows cast by the painted rocks that they were taking shelter between.
The plan ended up being pretty close to Dean’s idea in the end. The werewolf and the girl were hiding out in a cabin outside of town. So, Sam and Stevie were going to be the decoy, bursting in through the front door guns blazing, and then Dean and Charlie were going to come in the back once the couple was on the defense. Sam would grab the girl and get her outside while they finished the job. It was simple enough.
He was sitting at the map table nursing a warm mug full of coffee between his hands when Sam got back from his run several hours later.
The next obvious step was the burger joint, since Dean had no memory of going anywhere else. So, the three of them made their way downtown to what looked like the most promising one.
Her whole face lit up then, and she looked so much like his Charlie as she animatedly answered that Dean felt most of his anxiety leave his body on a heavy exhale. Cas leaned forward and asked questions as she explained their new life together here, and Dean reached down to take Cas’s hand. He didn’t say anything, but he didn’t have to when Cas squeezed his hand in return.
“I like to think so,” Cas agreed. Then he exhaled carefully and continued, “The man showed the angel that there was more to life than following orders. There was a right and a wrong, and there was good in the world that was worth fighting for. He taught the angel about family… and love. Because of the righteous man, the angel saw everything in the world in a new light, and he cared about it. For the first time, in his very long life, he felt.”
Cas, apparently deciding that there was no crisis afoot, started slipping his hands underneath Dean’s t-shirt and skimming them across the soft skin of his stomach. Dean gulped as he pushed the fabric out of the way and dipped down to mouth at the skin along the waistline of his jeans. His mouth was hot and wet, and his tongue traced a line along Dean’s hip bone.
“Then what was it like?” Dean demanded, his voice rising in volume. “Because the way I see it, we’re finally free of Chuck and all his mind games, but I’m still not really free, am I? How can I be when I’m living a
Her words were undermined a little by the look of pure relief on her face, but Cas still put on a serious expression as he promised her, “I will try not to.”
The others noticed, of course. Sam had mentioned his late night adventures exactly once and then never again after Dean had told him to back off. He probably shouldn’t have done that. He knew Sam was trying to be nice or whatever. He just couldn’t handle people being
He smiled to himself and turned around before she could see it. She may be a pain in the ass when she wanted to be, but she was a good kid.
His mouth felt dry as he realized once again that this wasn’t the girl he knew. He’d just started to question if he’d been stupid to ask to see her. It wasn’t like she had any reason to indulge his grief-fueled nostalgia for her alternate self. She didn’t owe Dean anything just because he’d loved a girl that looked like her. But then Cas stepped in.
Dean, to his growing suspicion, seemed to have no idea what he had done to end up with this outcome. Sam had seen Dean at about just every point on the hungover spectrum throughout their lives, but this one was setting new records.
By the time they were all contentedly full and ready to hit the road again, his trepidation about the whole affair was all but gone. He stood a little to the side as she and Cas said their goodbyes. Cas’s social skills were one of the oddest and most endearing things about his humanity. He was still clumsy and awkward more often than not, but he made up for that with his earnest desire for connection. He cared about people, plain and simple. Charlie, as odd as this situation was, seemed to be no exception.
Sam ran Cas through the events of the morning, with exactly zero help from Dean. He’d stopped interjecting to try and defend himself at least. Instead, he was doing something even weirder though. He kept
to him about Cas being gone because that would mean it had really happened, and that wasn’t fucking possible. Dean wasn’t grieving. He was lying in wait. He just wasn’t sure what the fuck he was waiting for.
Sam sucked in a breath and let it out slowly. He said, “You know what, Dean? You’re right. Everything’s perfect, just the way you wanted it.”
“Couldn’t sleep,” she said. Then she looked up at him as she added, “Sam says you’re not sleeping either.”
Something flashed in his mind, a vision of sorts. Nothing he could place or hold onto, but there was a brick wall and then darkness splitting it open. It was like the scene was playing out on the edge of Dean’s mind, just out of his reach. If he really focused though, he could start to see the details of another person there when he turned around. Another person who looked like…
Dean couldn’t find the words around the lump that had taken residence in his throat, so he took a couple of steadying breaths instead and nodded.
The werewolf made a run for it, and Dean caught him in a chokehold. He struggled wildly, but Dean tightened his arms around the wolf’s neck.
“Why not?” Dean asked, the fire fully stoked inside him now. “You’re the one who keeps asking if I’m okay, and you know what? Maybe I’m not. Lately, it’s like something’s going on in my head that even I can’t figure out.” He took in Sam’s nervous posture and flighty glance, and suddenly it clicked into place for him. “You knew that though, didn’t you?”
She nodded once as he clapped her on the shoulder and rose from the ground. He turned around to find Sam helping Stevie drag out the werewolf’s body. The girl still hadn’t looked up from where she sat on the ground, and Dean figured that was for the best.
Dean felt like he’d been slapped across the face. He watched, dumbfounded, as Sam stormed off towards the Impala.
Cas stared back at him for a few confused seconds before something like recognition clicked in his expression. He looked a little like he’d been slapped across the face, and he simply said, “Oh.”
“Oh, a gun?” she asked, smiling smugly at Dean and Cas. “It’s cute that you think that will kill me.”
While she didn’t seem any more excited to see them than she had earlier that day, she at least wasn’t throwing punches, which seemed like a good start. Sam did his best with the FBI routine, with Dean sabotaging him at every turn, until she finally stopped and spun around to face them with an exasperated look.
“We believe you, don’t worry,” Sam cut in, aiming for reassuring. “But could you tell me, does this place have security cameras?”
Dean had the werewolf cornered while Charlie held up her gun when the girl burst back in through the front door. Apparently she’d gotten the drop on Sam, which Dean would definitely be giving him shit for later, and wasn’t going down without a fight.
Sam looked like he was fighting back the sympathetic look Dean knew he wanted to give him, and he appreciated the effort at least. Gently, when it became clear that Dean wasn’t going to continue, Sam asked, “Has it always been like this for you when we’ve lost him before?”
Dean had been quiet since he’d gotten his memories back. It was the familiar kind of quiet though, and that was both reassuring and worrying in equal measure.
Dean frowned as he admitted to himself that Sam had a point. Historically, he did tend to carry these things around until the pressure burst and sent them flying out, ricocheting like shrapnel at everyone in his path. He sighed, letting himself admit defeat in the face of Sam’s pleading puppy dog eyes.
Dean wasn’t really sure how to respond to that without acknowledging the pang in his chest. Cas noticed, because of course he did, and his hand found Dean’s leg under the table with a gentle squeeze.
Tears were flowing freely down her face, and she didn’t make a move to wipe them away as she said, “Isn’t there someone you love? Someone that you’d die for?”
“Oh my God,” Sam said. He pinched the bridge of his nose between his fingers and counted to ten. “You know what? Don’t say a word to Cas about this. In fact, just stop talking altogether until we fix you. You’ll thank me later.”
Sam huffed this time before saying, “Dean, you can’t stay here forever. I mean, you’re not eating and you’re barely sleeping. I haven’t seen you drink a glass of water in
Sam started to turn around, but Dean grabbed his shoulder and asked, “What the hell is that supposed to mean?”
Dean looked over at him and felt a small smile tugging at the corner of his mouth at the awed look he saw.
Just as Dean was getting lost in the push and pull, Donnie punctuated his lips with one more kiss before trailing his mouth along Dean’s jaw to nibble at the sensitive skin there. Dean gripped his shoulders tight and tipped his head back. Then Donnie stopped cold.
Dean caught up with Sam while Cas wandered off, looking around the tree for any other signs that Dean and/or the witch had been there. Sam had been pretty focused on trying to get a good picture of the sigil on his phone to show to Rowena. That’s why, when he pocketed his phone again, it took him longer than it should have to realize that Dean had been quiet for a while.
Dean reached inside his jacket pocket and pulled out his cell phone, which, when he held it up for Sam to see, had a busted screen.
“I would never, and neither would Rafe,” she hurried to say. She seemed to be registering that she had three FBI agents in her bar for the very first time at that moment.
“I couldn’t tell you,” she shrugged. “Rafe went on break, and the two of you got to talking. I didn’t see you after that, but apparently you went running out the back door like your pants caught on fire. Rafe said you were supposed to meet up after close up, but you never showed.”
“Please,” Dean scoffed, “I’ve lived like this for years, and I’m not dead yet.” He paused. “Well, I mean, unless you count the time I went to hell. Or the many,
Dean reached out and squeezed Cas’s shoulder before sliding his hand up to rest it on the side of his neck as Cas turned back to face him.
He looked up and saw first what must have been the other witch, and then Sam running down after him. The sound of Dean’s gun cocking again behind him caught his attention though, and he looked to see Dean frantically pointing the weapon between the two men.
He leveled a glare at her, which she responded to with a raised eyebrow. He sighed and scrubbed his hand down his face. Well, he’d tried anyway.
They were about an hour out of town when she sent him an address to a local diner. He smiled to himself and pulled up the GPS on his phone to set them on the right path.
He glanced down at Dean, who was still curled into his side, and knew that they had to go. So, he gently roused Dean and got them both up and into the car. It was pretty clear that Dean wasn’t going to be able to drive, so Cas almost preemptively apologized as he took the keys out of Dean’s pocket and climbed into the driver’s seat. Despite Dean’s qualms about anyone touching his Baby, Cas was actually a decent driver, and it didn’t take him long to get them going in the right direction, following Sam’s location drop on his phone.
Sam followed his gaze, and sure enough, there was the girl who had slapped Dean earlier. If anyone was going to be able to tell them what Dean had gotten up to the night before, she seemed to be the best bet. Clearly he’d managed to piss her off somehow.
Sam raised his eyebrows at him in disbelief, but Dean only cut him a quick glance before looking back at the server.
Cas was already opening back up the book he’d dropped when Dean had called, and Sam didn’t particularly blame him. He was starting to feel like climbing the walls with all of their dead ends too.
She seemed very subdued as she led them to the back office and sat them down at a computer screen. She left them without a word this time, probably still imagining federal arrest, and the three of them sped through the footage behind the bar from the night before until they got to the moment Dean hurried out the door.
Dean knew that tone. It was a bait if he’d ever heard one. Instead of rising to it, he simply said, “Okay, have fun.”
The bed dipped beside him as Cas sat down and scooted towards the center. Dean sent off the message and sat his phone back where he’d found it. He turned to see Cas staring at him with a soft smile.
Dean was quiet for a moment, and Cas didn’t say anything either. He worried maybe he’d gotten a little too specific. Made things awkward. He wasn’t used to being able to speak with Dean so freely. Usually, Dean would deflect and change the subject, and although it was infuriating, it was familiar.
Donnie took a step forward and pressed his leg between Dean’s, and Dean whined in response to the pressure as he rutted forward. He was running on adrenaline and pure instinct. For the first time in weeks, it was like his brain was turned all the way off.
He wandered the halls instead of sleeping most nights, entering rooms at random and then leaving again, but he never actually went in that room. He wasn’t sure what he was looking for, but he was beginning to feel like a ghost haunting his own home. A restless, borderline vengeful spirit tied to the place where it all went wrong.
“You forgot how to drive!” Sam said. Then something occurred to him, which honestly he should have thought of immediately. “What if you’ve been hexed?”
“He said he was going to get better,” she said between her tears. “He was going to stop killing people, and we were going to run away together.”
He turned around and found Dean still standing behind him, thankfully, but he was staring again. He had an odd look on his face, embarrassed almost, as he watched Cas rooting around through the underbrush.
“You stupid son of a bitch,” he gritted out. A lump was quickly forming in his throat, and he tried to swallow around it as he hung his head and sniffled. He looked up again and blinked quickly against the hot tears stinging his eyes. Then, only because there was no one around to hear it but this stupid empty room, he said, “Me too, Cas.”
He pulled off the highway and put the Impala in park on the shoulder of a dusty gravel road. It was too cold to eat outside at one of the picnic tables scattered around the guard rails, but he left the heat on in the car so that they could still take in the view as they ate their sandwiches and sipped gas station fountain drinks. The only station currently coming through on FM radio was some old timey gospel power hour, so he shut it off and reached inside the console for the old Zeppelin cassette tape that had no right to still play given its old age and hours of use. It still roared to life though as he stuck it in the tape deck and hit play.
Dean shrugged, and Cas couldn’t help the smile that tugged at his mouth when Dean immediately started opening and shutting the empty motel drawers.
Before God created the heavens and the earth, there had been darkness. Sure, he’d met the actual Darkness now, but he didn’t know about her back then. The story went that God had parted the waters and turned on the lights and so on, but a younger Dean had wondered what that time before had been like. What it must have looked like for a universe to exist in total darkness; the cold and sharp waters that must have covered the surface of everything.
“Dude, aren’t you a little old for this?” he asked, gesturing at Dean’s clearly hungover state, “I mean, you had a good run, but.”
They made their first stop for the night just across the Wyoming border about sixty miles outside of Cheyenne. Cas unloaded their bags from the Impala while Dean booked them a room at a run down, mom and pop motel just off I-80. It was directly across the road from a greasy burger joint, which is where they found themselves for supper after dropping off their things in the room.
Dean took absolute joy in forcing Cas to watch all of his favorite movies and listen to the music he was raised on, of course, but there was just something super endearing about realizing that Cas really liked watching Friends and knew every word to most Lizzo songs. He and Sam honestly bonded over a lot more common interests than he did with Dean, but that was okay. The morning he’d walked in on Cas singing Truth Hurts while making breakfast would probably live in his head rent free for the rest of his life.
. It wasn’t like he was the first guy Dean had ever been attracted to, but he was the first spark of interest that Dean had let himself indulge in a very long time. Flirting with Donnie was sort of like a pressure valve in that way. Instead of keeping it all inside, he could just let a little bit of it out here and there. And yeah, Donnie had made the offhand comment once or twice that let Dean know that he would be up for more. However, Dean had never taken him up on it, and Donnie had never pushed.
Dean made eye contact with Charlie over the girl’s shoulder, and she nodded. In a quick move, he released the werewolf and lunged for the girl. She screamed as he tackled her to the floor, and he did his best to shield her vision as gunshots rang out through the air. The accompanying thud told him everything he needed to know about Charlie’s aim, and he let out a heavy exhale as the girl stopped fighting against him and started sobbing instead.
Sam’s eyes widened, and he looked over his shoulder at the mechanical bull, which was currently doing its best to throw some drunk wannabe cowboy across the room.
Charlie hadn’t called for backup, but her girlfriend Stevie had. Apparently the situation had gotten messy, and Dean had fired up the Impala without hesitation. Sure, they’d just finished up the last vamp case, but staying busy was good. Sam hadn’t argued either, but that was probably just because it was Charlie.
It wasn’t the worst conundrum he and Cas had faced though by far. To have a life and the choice how to spend it. Honestly, it was fucking
She watched him closely as he walked around the table and settled into Sam’s chair. He could practically feel some of the ice melting off of her glare before she said, “Dean, I’m sorry, I didn’t mean…”
Sam’s head whipped back around to the server, not sure if he had heard that correctly. He recognized the name though. She’d said it earlier, at the waffle place.
They were back on the road by the time the sun was getting lower on the horizon. It was setting earlier and earlier as winter approached and the days grew shorter. The mountains added to the encroaching darkness as they hid the sun from view even earlier than the plains of Kansas had. Dean knew they would need to stop again before they reached California unless they wanted to drive through the night. They could do that too, of course, but there really wasn’t a reason to rush. He knew what the long haul of an all nighter felt like, and he knew that he was getting way too old for that kind of bone-tired stiffness and inevitable muscle aches. Still, he wanted to get out of Salt Lake City and all of the price-gouging tourist trap motels before they called it a night. So they watched the miles stretch on until the mountains gave way to a rocky red desert.
He maneuvered Dean’s fingers until they were holding the gun with at least what would pass for proper form, and Dean grinned up at him and gave him a thumbs up.
No one answered, of course, and he wasn’t really sure if saying it had helped or not. Maybe it didn’t really matter.
The air around Dean grew cold in his absence, and that choking feeling from his nightmare thrust itself into the front of his mind. He reached out and grabbed Donnie’s arm, and said, “Wait, no, I’m fine.”
Dean obviously couldn’t be trusted to join the hunt for the coven and thus the grimoire, so he and Cas stayed behind at the motel. Cas wanted to help, of course, but even he knew that Dean couldn’t be left alone right now, and he was selfishly a little grateful for the opportunity to stay with him.
“Well, that’s something at least,” Sam sighed. He pulled out his own phone and said, “I guess I’ll text Mom and tell her to call me in case of emergency. And Cas, to let him know you’re okay.”
When Dean reached out to accept one of the hot drinks from him, he said, “Cas, I could kiss you right now.”
The words came out of his mouth with a surprisingly sharp edge to them, and he exhaled as he stared down at the table between them. He closed his eyes and told himself to cool the fuck down. It wasn’t Claire’s fault. She was just a kid, and he knew deep down that he’d feel worse for picking a fight with her. So, he steeled himself and avoided her gaze when he opened his eyes again.
Dean nearly faints, he moans around his own fingers and takes them deeper into his mouth. Fuck. It’s been minutes, but he’s already too close.
Okay, perhaps he will simply obey this voice, because it is kind of impossible not to. It makes him lose his nerve for sure, but he quickly puts himself together, not to look stupid. But he enters the kitchen and sits on the nearest chair anyway.
“Well, it was nice to get to know you better, Benny” Castiel continues, as he holds out a hand in his direction.
Dean is very quiet. I guess, something in my facial expression made him feel worried. He takes my hand. The ache grows.
Damn, this is too hot. Benny's underwear is most likely to be a wet mess at this point, his cock twitches in his pants, it's probably leaking with precome right fucking now.
How easy is it? To declare love. And how impossibly hard it is to finally understand, that you need an answer, still.
Benny eases himself falling into nearest chair, removes the condom, ties it neatly and smacks it agains the floor.
And damn, if he’s not excited about this. But yeah, he replies with the same mild smile, he knows how to play.
“He…” he takes another deep breath. Fuck, he’s really gonna do it. He’s really gonna tell about it like this. “He came to my office early in the morning…”
Dean opens his mouth wide and sticks out his relaxed tongue, not too much, just to cover his bottom lip, he moves in closer, until Benny’s head touches it. Dean takes a second to perceive this moment, eventually, it’s a big deal for him too - a second cock he’s about to suck in his life. He’s gonna value every second of it, feel every thrust, every twitch, the hotness of skin, the pulse. He’s gonna let it fill all of his mouth, slither down his throat, stroke his palate. Slide between his lips.
Benny wants to remove the condom and come all over Dean’s open mouth. Fuck. He won’t say anyone, but he wants Dean to come on him, too, he wants to let him release himself on his chest, on his face, whatever... anywhere he’d like to.
He changes the angle of his thrusts, crooking his fingers a bit, to make a room for his mouth, but it makes the whole Dean's body twitch.
“I did what I did,” Cas gives him a look “...because I was absolutely sure you want it and you’re ready. It wasn’t even a seduction.”
“It’s 50 bucks for him to show an eager to do so. But if you dare…” He taps a finger on own chin, like he’s considering something. “I’d rise it up to 50 more for you to be very much… into it.”
“What’s the matter?” Cas squints his eyes, tilting his head to the side. “Have you forgot, what you were about to do? This, Benny. This...”
Deans’ breath is calm, he takes his exhales slow and deep, he is relaxed, focused on sensation. The head goes in, an it’s wonderful, he bites his lip at that. It’s not only about Benny giving it to him, it’s about him taking it, also. Because he takes it so good, he takes it so fucking well. He knows, how it’s done.
“Dean,” Castiel’s voice sounds lower now, it dropped nearly an octave down. “ Put your hands on your knees and spread your legs wider, I know you can. Benny’s going to need his hands now.”
“You always have to make sure,” Castiel starts, looking at Benny with all his cogency, like it’s a very important tip for the future, “…that he is ready for your cock.” And he raises his eyebrow, insisting on the importance of the spoken.
“…okay, it was very nice, really. I’ve never tried anything like that, and I really… I should kinda… thank you guys? Yeah. Thank you. And I umm… you know I have no prejudices, of course. Right? And after…that… I have no regrets. It happened. It can happen once in a lifetime, right? Just wanted to let you know, I’m okay with everything. I mean, I’m not gay, but nothing wrong with what’s happened…”
Dean’s body is shaking lightly, his eyes are closed, but he can hear the familiar wet squishing noise. His fingers dig deeper into his jeans.
I’d pay dearly. With money, with time, that’s left. With anything. For something so loud, that could muffle my inaudible screams into nowhere.
I want to come into your room, I want to sit beside you, while you’re still sleeping. I want to smear that goddamn glue all over you, from head to toe, and put myself on top of you, as like I’m the other surface. “Assemble parts and hold together with pressure for 15 seconds or until set”, the directions say.
I counted the seconds; they aimlessly wandered around, and then, having nothing else to do, gathered into minutes. It took more courage for minutes to gather in hours, but they did anyway. Hours slowly built up the days, and every seven days made it into a week.
I don’t know if it is a prayer, I just repeat it over and over. Maybe I’m hoping these words will lose their meaning, if I’ll bounce them against every wall? Every wall of every empty room. I wander around them at night. You stood here, you smiled there, we had an argument, sitting in these chairs. And here, here you touched my shoulder.
He roughly grabs Benny by the hair and pulls his face away from Dean’s ass. And the look on Benny’s face is priceless.
Benny’s not sure he’s heard the last sentence correctly, but it’s clear, that mood is broken and he probably should laugh a little more and go home. He’s okay with that, he can just jerk off to this beautiful memory. He’s okay. Isn’t he?
Can I rest now? Can I close my eyes? Can I, please, can I stop feeling? Anything? At all? I’m exhausted. I just want it to stop. I want everything to stop.
Cas notices, and soothes him immediately. It’s a simple forehead kiss, but Dean exhales a shaky “Fuck…” in relief.
Dean knows, how it’s done, he knows, how Castiel likes to hear him saying these kind of things. It makes Dean squirm every time, but he loves this feeling.
“It’s okay. I’m okay with it.” Cas kisses him. And it’s not soft and sweet. It’s a slide of his tongue against Dean’s upper lip, it’s an instant capture. It’s sensual and demanding.
All the employees know this habit of his, and no one dares to disturb him, even if they came earlier too.
His hand is little faster, than Castiel’s thrusts, but that’s okay, he can do it in his own pace now.
“I’m terribly sorry for this, Benny. He’s absolutely unbearable sometimes” Castiel apologises, he even means it.
Sound escapes Dean’s mouth and he closes his eyes again. Castiel is very pleased with this sound, so he starts the unhurried rhythm.
“Yes?” Castiel’s eyes are back on Dean’s again. He looks attentively, as his hand starts the rhythm again. Dean wants to gasp, but he needs to go on.
His thrusts are so deep now. His breath is hurried. He sucks and licks on Dean’s neck, his fingers dig into Dean’s chest.
Miraculously, he even managed to sort all that shit before 7 pm. He writes few more letters and that’s it. Guys are probably done for today, he’s gonna close the empty workshop and drive home. He closes his laptop.
You’re taking two milkshakes out of the bag, one for you, one for me. We argue on who’s gonna cook today.
He pushes Dean one step back, and slides himself free from in between the table and Dean’s body. With his hand still in Deans pants, he gently pushes him closer to the table. Dean obeys, and rests his elbows and chest on the wooden surface. He closes his eyes and breathes in.
Today they have started this process with Benny. Castiel did not only picked him for them to have fun with. He discerned another one repressed and fucked up guy, and opens him up slowly, carefully, step by step. Dean was so distracted with his own lust, he didn’t have time to understand, that all of this has the actual point. Essential purpose. That’s how Cas does it. Gives you all you have been dreaming about, without you questioning it. And then makes you stop and think what are you doing exactly, and what does it mean to you. What’s the reason and what’s the goal. With this little task he has assigned for Benny, he, for sure, made Benny’s brain roast a little. Or a lot. We’ll see now.
Dean sucks. He moves his head back and forth, making sure his mouth is welcoming. So welcoming, Benny would gladly come inside. Fuck, he thinks of how Benny would taste like.
“Yeah. Yeah, boss. See you downstairs” Benny nods and smiles too. He closes the door when he leaves the office.
“Yeah…” Dean is hesitant. “But.. You know, you’re saying these things, and I wonder, maybe it is for him? An experiment. I mean...you’re really sure? He’s into men?”
Seriously, you didn’t want to wake me up?? So nice of you! Next time consider my near heart attack, maybe?
Benny looks at them, looks how Castiel pets Dean’s head, strokes his neck, kisses his temple. As he holds Benny’s gaze, doing it.
“See, I have a very high standards. I won’t let some random philistine fuck my husband. That man has to be skilled, he must have a strong will to make Dean feel good, to fulfil his needs properly”
I know, I know! I remember everything you’ve said. I remember how I tried to believe it, to understand, to accept, to let it all inside me and keep it there. Your simple truth, that I actually mean something. Mean so much. To you.
Position is somewhere between lying and sitting, as the headboard is very close to his back, and when he rests his back on the pillows, his head is only inches lower, than Castiel’s. His ass stays on Castiel’s lap, and now he’s so very sure about how it’s gonna be today.
“Yeah..” He hears in response, and shudders at the sensation of two hands, stroking hot skin of his lower back, moving idly down to his ass. Petting and praise. He loves it.
Benny nearly faints at his. He knows he’s good, sure. They all told him he’s good, but never at the process and straight to his face, just like that. Girls are shy, usually, they just moan and that’s all.
Castiel looks at Benny’s face, he is pleased with the reaction. The guess was so simple, actually. He’s not genious, he is just… gay. Any man appreciates his essential part to be taken with care. But with genuine eager? Yeah, simple as that.
This little word made Benny’s dick twitch. Normally he’s only half hard during this, licking is more of a foreplay, usually. But now… it’s different.
Benny probably has a very stupid expression on his face. He almost says some ridiculous shit like “What, now?”, but he just keeps on staring at Castiel, a little panic growing inside his guts.
“My pleasure” Cas nods and kisses him on the cheek. Dean grins and kisses him back, gently placing a hand on his neck.
How many times I’ve touched him to heal his wounds, to stop his bleeding, to protect. Now I can’t bring myself together to wipe his tears away. Yes, I’m good with fixing physical damage. But how do I make human heart feel better?
“It’s noon, actually, but we decided not to wake you.” He looks at me, attentively. There’s something in his gaze, I don’t understand it. Its different, I’ve never seen him looking at me like this.
He holds my face with his hands, holds it tight, nails digging into my skin. He closes his eyes and leans closer, to press his forehead against mine.
“Yeah.” Benny confirms and winces, as Castiel’s grip on his hair getting tighter and turns nearly painful.
Benny flushes a little too. It would be so amusing and funny to watch, if Dean wasn’t in the same condition. No matter the flush, although, Benny’s voice stays solid.
I put my coffee cup on a table. Dean follows. It is impossible to look at his face, same as take my hand back from his. We remain silent for a little longer. We look at our hands, clasped together.
Castiel looks and continues. His hands slide down to the small of Dean’s back, stop by for a round of stroking, and then move down to have a good grip on Dean’s cheeks.
Benny is sitting in his chair, losing his shit, losing his mind, losing the last pieces of his composure and common sense.
Benny’s hand squeezes the back of his neck, but he breaks the “kiss” and stares at Dean with a certain amount of irritation.
Castiel looks up. He puts one hand on Dean’s waist, other goes under his T-shirt. Fingers warm on his ribs, they move slowly, they tickle a little. Dean is not sure, if he’s allowed, but he has to try anyway. He rises his hand in attempt to lay it on Castiel’s shoulder, but
What comes out of Dean’s mouth is loud, and hoarse, and desperate. It’s filthy, it’s so fucking filthy, and it’s the best sound Benny has ever heard.
Someday, I’ll be able to leave your room, leave you out of my sight, and don’t feel growing panic in my chest.
We hugged each other so many times, but somehow, it fells different now. Something in him is different. I can feel his body trembling against my chest, I feel, there’s an ache in him, too.
Castiel kisses him once more and puts Dean's head on his own shoulder, running fingers through his hair. Dean’s breath is raged, warm and wet against Castiel’s neck.
“And he… yeah, you were right.” He swallows to soften his dried throat. It’s not so easy to speak, during this process, but he tries his best. His voice shakes slightly, he makes tiny pauses to breathe in between the rounds of pressure. “He, umm… he said… he said it was…interesting experience, but…”
“ We won. Chuck is defeated. Jack took his power and he handles it very well” He is smiling again, sincere now, warm and proud. “All this time, you were right about the kid. You were damn right, Cas.”
“Oh..” This makes Benny’s guts uncurl, and his heart is beating faster now. This is a big deal. He actually means something for them. He feels… good. Yeah, definitely good. Like, honoured, even.
Well, of course Dean feels insecure too. Yes, he’s been openly bi for two years, and yes, he, for god’s sake, is married to a man now. But there wasn’t any other man it his life, only Castiel.
Dean lets go off his legs and tries to step on the floor. Knees are too weak, they shake, and he grabs the headboard to help himself from falling.
Dean mouth falls open in silent gasp. He grabs Benny’s wrist in tight grip, holding his hand in place, not letting Benny’s thumb to be taken away from his hole.
Mild smiles sits on Cas’ face, when he sips his tea. But the hand, freshly rich with fifty bucks, stays. He continues looking.
This he can do. He grips Dean at the back of his knees and spreads his legs even wider. He swallows again, geez, his face and his mouth is now so close to what he wants, he soon will drool like a dog, probably.
“No, Dean. I mean it.” Castiel frowns, emphasizing the seriousness of the said words. “Stop confusing reality with porn again. We have the actual human being here and we need to show him our utter care and full support”
With this, Benny leans back to behold. His eyes move from Dean’s face to his hole not to miss anything, as his thumb easily slides inside.
We’re listening to the new mixtape you’ve made. It’s awful, by the way. 90’s? Seriously?? Oh, don’t hurt yourself rolling your eyes back. Ok…Okay! I’m shutting up!
These are my arms, my shoulders, hands. I used to know my hands as lethal, strong and fast, and I’ve always thought, that’s enough for male hands. I mean… they are, yes. But now I’d add, they are full of care, also. Even gentle. They are good for so many things, I didn't even realize they are so good.
He remembers how his own wall fell; it was a long process of back and forth, of doubts and sorrows, tears of shame and tears of joy, long way to accept himself, as he is.
Shaking slowly fades. Castiel’s hand is not on his head anymore, but he relaxes anyway. Tension leaves his shoulders, his spine, his knees. His mind. His eyes are closed, but he can hear the sound of fabric being pulled off across the skin, he hears soft metallic tapping and clicking, zipper sound and a thud of jeans and belt, being tossed on the floor. He waits.
“Man, seriously, can we please both try to make it less weird, okay?” He says, as he makes himself sit. Maybe it’s not the best idea, considering all the lube, but to lay like that is not good either.
“Oh..” Benny swallows. Although he has no idea what it could be, he is certain, Castiel can figure it out for him.
Benny does. He stands next to Dean, leaning against the table, and Castiel moves his chair away from them to have a better view from afar.
“That’s okay, Dean. There’s nothing criminal in liking other people. You can’t control your feelings. Only your deeds, right?” Cas runs his fingers through Dean’s hair, calming him down.
“He…fuck… I… said we’re fine. Of course we’re fine. And I walked to th… to the door, I was in a little… hurry” His speech pauses for a moan, Castiel’s fingers move inside him so proficiently. “Fuck… !”
They’re not going to continue with watching this series, for sure. One of Cas’ colleagues recommended it, but they have different hits on what “a show, that keeps you in tense” is, apparently. Reporters are weird, nothing to add about it.
Dean chokes, he needs a second, okay? To finally accept the fact that it’s really happening. It’s… fuck. It’s getting hard to breathe, his adrenaline is insane, probably.
This was meant to be the one shot and my first attempt and challenge to write something thiis explicit.
“Hold it. Let him relax around you, you’ll feel it.” Castiel says as he warms new portion of lube in his palm.
“I figured, this would be easier” Cas shrugs. He approaches and helps his husband with putting a robe on, holding it out like a coat.
“You wanna fuck this?” He rubs his lubed fingers on Dean’s hole, making it twitch right in front of Benny’s eyes.
Dean is not looking at me, he’s struggling to breathe as he’s shaking with his whole body. I look at his profile, tears streaming down his cheek. His hand is on my shoulder, I feel his fingers digging in a tight grip.
“Oh, fuck…” at least his moan in a low register. Dean relaxes into sensation. This is marvelous, Benny’s tongue is so delicate, and his beard is surprisingly soft, it tickles Dean a little, but that’s okay, he likes it.
Benny is ready too, and the knows exactly how to start. One more look into Dean’s eyes, and he leans.
“Yeah… and he’s okay with everything. And he… he hopes, we’re okay, too. And he says thank to us, anyway…”
“Don’t ever leave me again, don’t.” He breathes, slow and deep, calming himself down. I breathe with him, I hold him close.
“Yeah, he is” Dean nods. He stands up too, to help Cas with cleaning. “We should hang together more often”
Okay... Okay, it’s just a kiss, for fucks sake! Nothing exceptional, just a little “bye-bye, see you soon” kiss, nothing to get nervous about or lose courage over. Benny lets out a grin, and it reflects on Dean’s face. Right, not to worry. What they did together about an hour ago was way more… more, that this. They can survive an innocent kiss.
Bed quacks under new weight and mattress sways a little from movement. Castiel lays down and slides his hand over Deans ribs. He presses his chest to Dean’s back. His breath is warm and ticklish on Dean’s neck. He’s hard.
Dean wants to feel Benny’s hands on his bare skin, he wants to hear sounds Benny will make, thrusting hard into his ass. He wants to taste Benny’s cock, he wants to suck it so bad. He wants to hear Castiel tells him how good he looks while Benny fucks him. He wants, and he wants, and he wants. Fuck, these wants are so embarrassing, but it feels so good.
Benny would lower his head and start to snicker, too, but it would bring his nose right into Deans ass.
“But Benny,” Cas breaks a kiss “Benny had no time to proceed the thought of actually having it. It was more like shoking therapy for him.”
“If”s are draining me. They are the lump in my throat, big and barbed. Sometimes it grows so big, it blocks the air from getting into my lungs. And in times like these I wonder, maybe I should just stop breathing at all? Still easier, than to accept your absence.
Cas can’t read Dean’s mind, but he sure has his own. They differ slightly, although may seem the same at first. He holds Dean tight by the neck, and his other hand slowly makes it’s way down to Dean’s fly.
Castiel strokes Dean’s back, as he looks Benny in the eyes. This time the voice is calm, but tone is firm. Dean knows this tone so well.
“Very good” Castiel kisses his forehead. “Now pull your knees up to your chest and wrap them with your hands.”
Dean looks at him and he believes. This all gonna end up very well for all of them, because Castiel is in charge.
“Because it’s a cock!” Cas points at Dean’s face with half empty tube. “There’s difference, okay? It’s way more sensitive!”
I’m sitting on the floor, holding you in my arms. My fingers hurt. I must’ve clutched them into your trench coat too tight. I have no idea how long I’ve been sitting like this.
But wait, no. He’s not into sucking, right? And he’s not allowed to, that’s not what Castiel asked him to do. And there’s Dean’s hole right in front of his face, so soft and relaxed already, willing to take him in. His tongue, at least. But hey, if there’s a tongue, there’s a finger too, eventually. And then, perhaps…
Benny stands up and rubs his face, he needs to take a few deep inhales, for sure, so he does. He even shakes off his shoulders to cut the shiver.
“I su…” His toes are curled, his knuckles are white, his heart will probably break his chest now. ”I sucked him off! I sucked…. CAS! Please!”
“Cas? You awake? How, how are you?” He leans closer and touches my face, fingers gently pull away the hair from my forehead, slide down my cheek.
Benny wants to touch himself, hell, at least take his cock out of his pants, it so very uncomfortable, keeping it there, squeezed between clothes. He wants to jerk off to the filthy sounds Dean makes, and the taste of his hole on Benny’s tongue, the tremble of his thighs, and the desperation of his grip on Benny’s hair. God, he wants to fuck him so bad. Make him moan like this, come all over his ass.
Dean turns his head to the side and cracks his eye open to the sound of steps, and he sees Benny in the doorway.
I thought I will never hear these voices again. I can’t believe I do now. Same scene, we did this so many times, I’ve lost count. When I’m weak, they hold me from both side, helping me to stand on my feet. Brothers. I look at them, I want to... I want to say... hello... I want to say so much...
Hand sliding down again, but this time it reaches to the point, making Dean’s another one “Oh, fuck!” clearly loud this time.
Now Dean understands, why he’s lying on his left side. No shame or embarrassment are left in him. He can grab his cock now, he will show Castiel, how he did it.
It looks as usual, Dean notes to himself. Not the slightest hint of what awaits for him. The bed is made, as they have left it in the morning, the towel, the lube, but nothing more. Okay. He must admit, he’s a little more than just curious.
“You are so beautiful like this. My sweet boy looks so beautiful…” Voice gets under Dean’s skin, praise makes his body tremble, makes him fall apart into million pieces. Castiel kisses him. It’s a tender of lips and slow caressing of the tongue. Gentle and sensual “…so beautiful.”
“Yeah, that's it. You’re gonna work your tongue so well, aren’t you, Benny?” Castiel murmurs. He’s very pleased.
“…fucking anything” he says, probably, in a thousandth time fascinated with the view of his beautiful husband taking himself out of his pants.
Dean does. He stands up, turns around and bends over, pressing his cheek on the cold surface of the table.
“You are here, you are saved. You will never get back there. You’re back, you’re here. You’re home”, - he says it, and he says it, and he repeats it all over again. And I’m not sure now, whether he tells it to me, or to himself. As I look into his face, I can see now, I understand what he feels.
Castiel is so fast, and Dean pulls his knees closer to his chest, his toes curl, responding to pressure inside. He can’t… He…
Sam came back from the store, I stand in the kitchen, taking out groceries and stuff out of the shopping bags. Among everything, I see he bought a super glue, I have no idea, what he needs this for.
Except for… except his eyebrow slightly twitch up. And his nostrils widen as he quietly, but convulsively sucks the air into his lungs.
Benny opens his mouth, his lips tremble, but he slides out his tongue to touch Dean’s lower lip. This makes Dean’s knees wesk, oh Jesus. He opens his mouth, inviting Benny in.
Castiel shakes his head. It could turn into some kind of stupid joke, but he’s dead serious now, he does not have time for this.
He pulls back to look me in the eyes again, and this time I don’t look away. He looks tired, exhausted. And impossibly sad.
You are not cold, but you are sitting on a chair, constantly adjusting this stupid robe, wrapping yourself in it tighter. You weirdo.
Benny is silent and frozen in his chair. His facial expression is a mix of disbelief and shock of amazement and embarrassment. But he keeps on staring with eyes wide open. Castiel looks closely at Benny’s eyes. There’s curiosity, too. And yes, a spark of lust, for sure. Good. It's time for the divine move.
So, I guess I’d rec to start from the second chapter and then return to the first one to understand what has happened at the beginning? Idk, it’s your choice. Just to let you know first chapter differs in writing style slightly, and the fic itself is gonna be written more like chap 2. Mind this.
He pulls his hand out of Dean’s pants, brings it to his own face and licks a tip of his middle finger.
“I’m certain, I’ve picked the right level of difficulty for you. Because, Benny, if you think Dean looks fantastic, bending over some car, then yes, he is. If you think he looks amazing, taking it into his ass, yeah, you’re right. But what you should know is... the only thing that can compete with the beauty of Dean taking a cock in his ass, is him taking it… between his lips.”
This is definitely the limit of acceptable. It’s the line to cross. Dean's chest heaves, deep breaths is the only sound that is left in the kitchen. It’s up to him now. Everything is up to Dean.
I don’t understand why is he crying? I'm dizzy, my body is aching with every cell, but pain never stopped me from recognizing feelings on his face. Sadness, grief, anxiety, anger, despondency, disgust... anything. But what is this?
Castiel is very pleased. His lubed hand now lays on the small of Dean’s back, he places the other one on Benny’s shoulder, squeezing it lightly.
Thoughts rambling in Dean’s mind, while Cas makes himself busy, licking into his exposed neck. Maybe they’ll end up turning it in into some kind of threesome fantasy? Maybe Cas will make Dean suck a dildo, pretending it’s Benny’s cock? He can do that. Knowing his husband, Dean is not surprised with this idea. Cas can be so very creative. And Dean is up to any shit Cas comes up with, because, hell, it’s always just… awesome.
My head is spinning again. I try to perceive everything he said, but all the thoughts are too heavy for me now, it’s hard to concentrate again.
Triumph rages inside him, but on the outside there’s only a small grin on his lips. He keeps on looking at Benny, waiting for him to notice this gaze.
“M’fine” he mumbles, when his mouth has successfully returned to it’s usual size. “It’s just… this episode got me sleepy. So boring, geez”
Dean smiles and wraps his arms around him, he feels a bulge in Cas’ pants rubbing against his exposed skin.
Dean’s back is arching, hand is flying on his cock, Benny can’t see his face, but he definitely can hear his raged breath. He must feel so good, so fucking good right now. And Benny does this to him.
He takes a deep inhale and rubs his forehead. He chuckles a little, and continues way more calm and confident.
“It was.” Dean kisses his cheek. “Cruel..” kisses his neck “…well thought…” kisses his collarbone “…seduction plan.”
“Sure, it’s okay” Cas nods, now pleased. “You’re not interrupting anything. Because we’re not shy” To Dean - “Are we?”
Benny’s tongue moves in a different direction, its up and down now, then from side to side. Pressure and speed increases. This is amazing, and Dean’s hand moves to grab on his cock.
Benny presses in again, causing another moan to escape Dean’s lips. When it comes to the second knuckle, Dean says, almost breathless.
Dean does. He plans. He examines every inch with attentive patience. He's facinated with the tence of skin and the rhythm of pulsation. He wants to trace all these veins with his tongue. Unfortunately, he doesn't have time for this now. He even questions in his head, if Castiel has limited this to ten minutes for Benny of for him, because he, surely, can do this play for a ridiculous amount of time.
“Cas…” He starts, but he doesn’t know how to continue this sentence. And he certainly have no idea why the hell Cas is grinning so wide. And why the hell he laughs?
Castiel gets up too, throws away the pillows an grabs the towel to put it in the middle of the bed. He turns his eyes on Dean.
Dean bites his lip, his head goes dizzy. He likes it. Fuck, he really likes it. They used to play some scenes like this, fantasies, nothing more. But to tell about what happened for real… Christ.
And without any hesitation he slides his head between Benny’s arm and Dean’s leg, licking into his hole. Deans is not sure is it the abruptness or the sensation itself, but the moan he made came out way higher then it should. Castiel doesn’t even bother to stop at that, he continues making out with his husband’s most sensual part, and it is absolutely clear, that he’s fond of the process.
Benny starts to understand how it works. And hell, this does things to him too, he literally catches every word. And if Cas will make Dean say it out loud…
It made him a little calmer. He leans back, his gaze is glued to his favourite part. Dean is back on his elbows, he's definitely heard Benny saying it, he just wants to make sure. He just wants to hear it again.
Lids are heavy, it takes some time to actually open my eyes. Yes, this is the bunker, this is my room, my bed. This is Dean sitting next to me, his hand is on my shoulder, and he is crying. I don't fully understand yet what has happened, but my first instinct, as ever, is to protect him. I feel better now, I think I can move? I put my hand up to touch him by the elbow.
Benny silently exhales in relief, sitting in his chair. Well, that was weird, but it’s okay now. They both are probably a little drunk, that’s all. Although, he has never seen them kissing like this before. Yeah, couple of fast smooches at the office parties, but that’s all. In fact, he has never seen men making out that close in front of his eyes. This… this is nice. So he just looks. They’re too busy with each other, so why don’t observe a little? Love is beautiful, okay?
“Say it, Benny” Castiel’s voice is very calm. “If you cannot voice your wishes, they won’t become your reality”
But… is this enough? What you feel about me? What I feel about you? To deserve you? Do I deserve you, do I?
I want to soothe him. I hold him, and feel his hand pulls the back of my head to hold me even tighter. I feel his stubble on my neck. I feel his heart beating frantically in his chest.
Cas moves to Dean’s head, leans over the table on his elbows, right above Deans face, but upside down, and their noses practically rub against each other.
“Are you sure?” He feels third fingertip on his rim, ready to stretch a little more. “Cause we need to continue…” all three slide inside to the second knuckle and Dean gasps. “You gonna tell me, what happed next, Dean?”
Dean cracks his eye open to the sound of morning alarm. It’s Monday, 7:30 am. He quickly turns it off not to wake Cas, who’s lying close, with his hand thrown across Dean’s chest, snuffling quietly. Dean takes his time, absorbing these minutes of morning laziness, slowly becoming more conscious, as he pets Cas’ hair, messed up and soft under his fingers. He’d like to stay like this for much longer, but damn, he has work to do, not to mention certain amount of stress he’s probably gonna face today.
Dean’s head is thrown back, eyes shut. He’s releasing little quiet and low “Ah!”s, every time Benny thrusts in.
“Yeah, okay. Okay… So uh, Jack tried to talk, but the Shadow was just mad. It tried to calm everyone down and get them back to sleep, but  failed. Turned out, only Jack could do it. So he, um, he traded you”, Dean smiles. “He made a deal - total silence in exchange for one nerdy dude with wings”.
“Oh, geez…” he whispers. This looks so good, Dean looks so gorgeous. Benny doesn't lust about his cock much, he's not into this. Hard cock is just a confirmation of arousal for him, nothing more. But the hole, he’s hypnotised with it. Fuck, he wants to taste it again.
Castiel has lost count of points, but these two really worth each other, and that’s the main thing. He is pleased. With everything.
They break a kiss to look in each others eyes. To check and assure. Yeah.. it’s okay… It’s okay. And they merge their mouths together again.
He rises from the desk and starts to put all his stuff in his bag. He makes sure grin is not on his face anymore.
“I’m in a middle of a process here, for fuck’s sake…” he swears. “Can you shut up? Agreed… agreed…” he grouses into Dean’s skin. “Don’t you have something else to worry about? Geez!”
Meanwhile, Benny isn’t sure, what he wants to do more - to slide his tongue inside Dean’s ass, or to suck on Castiel’s fingers.
On the inside, Castiel burst out with joy, this is his best score so far, he’s so proud with himself, he could scream. On the outside, he tilts his head and bites on his lip, like he’s considering it.
Benny’s knees ache, his whole body trembles, his head is dizzy and mouth is dry. But Castiel is right, he’s so fucking right, and Benny has to admit it. Somewhere deep inside he knows, when he will say it out loud, he’s gonna feel better. But it’s a line to cross. He breathes. He swallows. He looks at Castiel, he must assure him, he means it when he says:
“Well, not much, too.” Dean pouts and makes his way to the fridge in casual need to grab himself a beer. “Got a new customer, but that’s pretty much all” He continues, as Cas watches his back. He opens the bottle and shrugs. “It’s a good money, but the order itself is nothing interesting, so…”
It’s more than “Thank you!” It’s more than enormous amount of gratitude. It’s a bliss. Dean looks like he is blessed with the given opportunity. To suck a man’s cock. Benny’s cock, in particular.
Dean grabs the door handle. He is a little bit annoyed with another one question. Sure, Benny is his buddy, but he doesn’t have time for that. Can he please go home already?
“Yeah, sure” Dean nods approvingly. Absolutely no doubts about it. If to talk about work, Benny is the most qualified, hardworking and overall smart sonovabitch he has ever worked with. And damn, he doesn’t want to lose his best guy. His right hand, to be honest.
It’s so domestic now. So comfy and easy. Like they've welcomed him into their life, like he's not just a random guy anymore.
As in confirmation, with the same fantastically beautiful expression on his face, Dean sticks out the tip of his tongue to slide it upon his bottom lip. It’s shiny wet now. He bites it.
Dean checks his mail, he goes downstairs to take a look on the working process and assign the today tasks for the guys. He nods approvingly when they show him the progress. With his side vision, he sees Benny watching him. As usual. Maybe a little more attentively. He goes upstairs with the new customer to sign the required papers. Before lunch, he has the usual Monday briefing with Benny, they prepare general order for spare parts for this week. They double check everything, and Dean approves the purchase with a casual pat on Benny’s shoulder, as he does every time when they agree on something. Benny behaves ordinary. Only two of them in the room, but absolutely no awkwardness between them. Benny looks at Dean for a little longer, maybe, when he leaves the office, but that’s all.
“Cas..” Dean mumbles. But then he understands. Of course Cas is okay with it. Benny is straight, Cas is absolutely safe in this situation. Besides, Dean knows this particular kink very well. Cas often praises him with how good he looks with a cock in his ass, he says, Dean is beautiful, when he takes it in. He says, many men would be so pleased, hell, blessed to fuck Dean. Because he takes it in so eagerly, he takes it in so good. His sweet boy takes it in so good…
Dean’s adrenaline is bursting, he tries to catch his breath and calm down. He’s not sure, if the cause is fingers deep in his hole, on the question, or the way he is positioned at the moment, or all at once, mixed together. Fuck. It makes his insides shrink into a tight ball.
You mutter something dissatisfied about peanut butter and jelly under your nose, but I won't even listen.
Benny is dizzy. He inhales shakily and exhales just the same, as if it's him, who’s about to take two fingers up his ass at once. He looks at Dean, who’s already leaned on his elbows, because he’d like to see. His pink lips are slightly parted, his breath is deep and calm. Dean meets Benny’s gaze and blinks in silent confirmation.
Meanwhile, Cas opens his eyes, he breaks a kiss and waits for Dean to look at him. Dean does. And oh, his smiles quickly fades, as he understands he’s fucked.
Light is blinding me. Heart grew so big, it filled all of my chest, not sure, if there’s a place left to breathe in.
He arches his back, leaning on his elbows, and moves towards Benny, taking a little more of his length it, it’s easy, with how skilled and relaxed he is. And he surely knows, how graceful, yet filthy he looks, doing it. He knows, how good it feels for both of them. Then he makes himself tight around Benny, he clenches good, and pulls them forward.
“Tell me.” The rhythm increases fast, and Dean lets go one hand from his knees to grip it desperately on Castiel’s shirt.
You took yourself away from me. It’s not fair, it’s so not fair. How could you do this to me? It’s not fair, can you hear me?
Cas looks up at Benny. Who's slided down in his chair a little, and is so hard in his pants, it’s nearly painful. Mind so heavy with need, his eyelids are half-shut, he surely needs a second, too, to proceed the sentence he’s just heard with his own ears. But Cas nods at the chair at Dean’s legs and says:
He’s trying to convince himself, that it’s true. It’s a mixture of relief and fear, of pain and bliss. His voice is cracking again, he’s losing his breath. His hands now clinging into my trench coat, so tight, his knuckles turned white.
Castiel frowns, as something bothers him. Indeed, rough fabric is not pliant enough, so he decides to get it out of the way. He unbuttons, unzips, then pulls Dean’s jeans down, but not too far, only to fully expose the underwear. He expresses his approval with the rise of his eyebrow.
Your presence in my life. You. All of you. So pure, so perfect. So selfless. I’d say you are full of light, but it’s not quite so. Because you are the light.
This fucking can’t be happening, it can’t be. Benny is straight guy, geez. He maybe likes to watch, or maybe he’s just curious, or… he’s gonna tell them they are fucking crazy and will quit on Monday... or whatever. But…to join? Dean’s heart is beating so fast it could break his ribs. This won’t happen. This can’t happen. What Cas is even thinking? Why is he asking? He, he WANTS Benny to join? His husband wants to see other man does things to him? Dean trembles.
Eventually, they end up sitting at the kitchen table, finishing their beer and laughing at some stupid story Benny was telling them.
It’s completely unsanitary, but Cas doesn’t fucking care, because Dean looks fucking spectacular. Absolutely naked, wet with sweat, with his eased cock and deep breath. Beautiful. Cas loves to see him like that. He wants to touch, and he run his fingers through his chest. Dean captures his hand and pulls it to his mouth. He kisses Cas’ palm, his fingers, his knuckles.
Fuck, Dean nearly forgot about him. He wants to turn his head and say something witty, but Cas holds his neck in the position. And Dean knows this particular grip very well. It’s a firm press of fingers on the back of his neck, right under the hairline. This grip means, he’s supposed to do as he’s told. Usually, it’s the thing they do when they are on their own. But… now? With Benny around? Dean isn’t sure, he understood the signal right. Maybe Cas just randomly squeezed his neck? He tries to move it again, but Cas’ grip just hardens. Dean freezes and swallows hard. What the fuck is going on? Cas smiles at Benny and says offhandedly:
And he leans closer to replace his finger with his tongue. Its a single lick but the moan that escapes Dean’s mouth works better than any persuasion.
“Aww, it’s nothing!” Benny waves off at him with his lubed fingers, and this finally makes Cas crack with laughter. He leans back to Dean's face again
It takes him a few seconds to understand. He has said it for himself, not for Castiel, not for Dean. Not for anyone. He made the voice inside his head audible, and yeah… it’s easier to breathe now.
Benny does, his hands shake a little. It’s funny, how only few minutes ago he thought how nice it would be to come into Dean’s mouth. Now he’s scared of even looking at his lips, because he knows what it actually means for him.
Okay, okay… What do people do in situation like this? Fuck’s sake, “situation like this”! What the fuck he’s supposed to do? Benny’s mind goes absolutely blank, and the only thing he comes up with is, probably, the most stupid thing he could come up with.
I can smell coffee. Among all the human foods, coffee has the best smell. Even before I open my eyes, I feel that i'm a lot better now. The smell is getting closer, and it's time to wake.
This words make Dean squirm, fill his guts with weird mix of shame, excitement and lust. He likes to show it, his exposed vulnerability, and he’s so embarrassed he likes to do it, it makes him aroused even more. He does as he's told.
Dean sucks in deeper and deeper, sensually, like he means so, his lips are tight around it, when they reach his own fingers at the base of Benny’s cock, he just removes his hand and continues his way down to the point, until all the length is inside his mouth.
“You know, Benny” he says wistfully, “I’ve fucked a lot of men, but not one of them liked to take it in the ass as much as Dean likes.”
“Fuck..!” Benny immediately throws his head up, looking at the kitchen ceiling. Oh his knees?? He has to..
Castiel strokes his knee lightly, as he watches attentively everything that is happening a little lower.
Fucking everyday morning exercises. Look and repeat, look and repeat to self all over again, “you are loved, you are loved, you are loved…” until not scared of the meaning.
“You’re not allowed to, until I say. I want you to focus on Benny’s mouth now. Do you like what he does?”
He makes sure Benny understands, that his hand moving down not to squeeze Dean’s cheeks, but deliberately to Dean’s hole. He stops his fingers right above it.
Cas stands up from his chair. He walks around to the other side of the table and leans to Deans head.
Cas wants to see Benny fucks him. Cas wants Benny to fuck Dean. Please, let it be more than a guess.
Fuck, of course he doesn’t, but his mouth is suddenly dry again, and it makes it hard to speak. So he swallows and shakes his head.
God, I’m so scared. It starts in my fingertips, they ache, like being pinned with needles. Needles get into my blood flow and make my whole body shiver.
Benny thinks exactly the same at this particular moment. He breathes deeply through his mouth, he reminds himself again, he needs to hold on. He’d gladly imagine Dean being some random girl, cause it would be way less arousing, than the fact he’s receiving his first blowjob, performed by man. By Dean. And his pink lips. Fuck, they are created to look good around the cock. Benny wants to come, watching those lips swol with insatiability.
Ask him. Come on, ask him. Once and for all. The words are very simple “Do you want me to stay?”, but they won’t come out.
Benny increases his speed, he can see Dean’s free hand bail into fist as he tries to hold his whines.
Castiel tilts his head, looking directly into Dean’s eyes, and his fingers are fully out with quiet wet noise.
Dean’s heart is feral in his chest. Say yes. Say yes, fuck, please! He wants Castiel to let them, he wants him to watch it.
It looks, like he’s hesitant, but he surely plays it well. Everything went just wonderful, as he has planned, and even better! Now it’s time for a final divine move.
How long will it take me to forget how your eyes looked like? How long will it take me to forget what you saw in me? How can I? Now, that I believe in everything you’ve said.
Everything is so blurry, like it’s covered with haze. Where am I, again? What happened? Is... is this the bunker? My room?
«Dean?» He shudders and turns his face to look at me. He quickly wipes his face with his palm, his look is all concern and caring. Voice quiet, soft, slightly hoarse.
Castiel closes the door and turns around to look at his husband, who’s biting on his knuckles, eyes grow wider and wider.
He looks at Benny, tilting his head to the side, he makes sure Benny watches his fingers are sliding out slowly.
He stares, and it makes Benny swallow hesitantly, because somehow he’s instantly nervous again. Awkward silence hits this kitchen again. Then:
These fuckers have no idea, how many times he wanted to slap Dean’s ass, every time he bend over some car, exposing his perfect shape. How many times he caught himself on a thought that Dean is prettier than any girl Benny have ever fucked. How many times Benny looked at pen between Dean’s lips and thought they'd look just perfect with a dick between them, rather than a pen. But those were just thoughts, because, well, his boss is a fucking cake.
Castiel kisses his heck and Dean breathes in, lips are soft, unhurried. He moves his hips closer, and Dean can feel the head of his cock, rubbing against his hole. He arches his back to meet. Castiel enters him slowly, with confident pressure. Hand wraps around Dean's chest, and he begins to move.
Cas waits for him in the doorway and kisses gently, when Dean is finally close enough. He walks first, and Dean hugs him from behind, following. It’s not very much comfortable to continue walking like that, but they do, clumsily waddling from foot to foot. Dean hums something, kissing the back of Cas’ neck, and Cas laughs.
My palms touch something cold, my knees hurt, I guess I fell on them. Slowly, the light is fading, and I can see my hands, I see my fingers on the familiar floor. Vision is blurry, but I can recognize the room. It is the last room I saw.
These words shouldn’t do things to Benny, but they do. He doesn’t care how he looks anymore, he’s not bothered what they will think… he closes his eyes and leans closer, as his hand moves underneath from Dean’s shoulder, running from ribs to chest, wet with sweat. To touch, to feel, to press their bodies together. His thrusts are out of rhythm now, frantic and needful. He hides his face between Dean’s shoulder blades, when he growls. He feels Dean’s hole clenching convulsively around his cock, as he comes.
“Are you sure, Benny?” With his free hand, Castiel opens a lid of a lube and squishes a generous amount on the table, then takes some with his fingers.
He doesn’t know, if he should laugh, or cry, or run away, or what. There’s no sign of Cas, and Dean is just lying on the table naked with the most peaceful expression on his face. Umm.. now what?
Yeah, okay, Dean might have had a few thoughts, but they were just thoughts, all right? He finds certain women attractive. He can find certain men attractive also, can't he? But those are just thoughts! It’s not that he likes Benny. He can’t allow himself to think that way.
“Hey!” Dean nods and sips on his second cup of coffee. He’s calm. All is well. It’s very good, that he has a cup in his hands, at least he knows, what to do with them. Because Benny clearly doesn’t know where to place his.
Castiel knew, he fucking knew it would be much easier for both of them to just fuck first. Asshole. But he was absolutely right, and his plan has worked perfectly.
“Okay, listen…” Dean takes another breath, he is still red, but he starts to snicker anyway. “It… it wasn’t that…”
He turns his look away from Dean’s underwear to grab the lube and pop the lid open. It’s been years, dammit, and Dean is not sure how the hell it became nearly (nearly, huh?) Pavlovian, but every time he hears this sound his head turns dizzy. Christ…
“Dean, you can touch your cock now” He grabs it straight away and starts to jerk off in the same rhythm Benny fucks into his ass, slowly and sensually.
He swears under his breath and grin grows wider and wider on his face, as he plans on how many adjustable wrenches he’s gonna drop and pick up from the floor today, how often he’s gonna suck on a pen between his lips, how many…
Dean may have a few ideas, what Cas is up to. Either way, he’s good with anything. He loves Cas’ ideas. They always end up very well, he trusts him on that completely. He is full with nervous excitement, he's a little embarrassed, he may be slightly aroused already, but it's okay. He loves this part. It’s tickling his guts just the right way.
Dean opens his eyes, and Benny sees, how stubborn and determined they are. He can be stubborn as well.
"Oh, should we?" Cas raises his eyebrow, as he leans his hips against the table and pulls Dean closer. He curls his arms around Dean's waist, nose rubbing scruffy cheek.
I looked at myself in the mirror again this morning, as I do every day. I look closely, I check, I perceive. Hey, you’d be proud of me, you know? Little by little, I merge my usual "I" with your vision of me.
But for Castiel, it has to be something else to that, and Benny knows exactly what it is. He understands now, how it works. And fuck, he’s into it.
“Good” Castiel barely smiles, but he looks pleased anyway. On the other hand, Dean’s smile is wide and open.
Castiel straightens up above the table, and Dean immediately resumes his position. Benny tries his best not to look at him. At his...
Castiel’s cheekbone lies on the top of Dean’s head. His fingers are getting closer, and he makes a break to add more lube. He can see, Dean has started his little fidgeting dance on his lap, so he looks at him, before to touch again. He waits, until Dean rises his head to meet the gaze.
Oh, now I understand why I’m so weak and pathetic. I feel all the strength that is left in me is not even enough to get up. “Mind is much clearer now, but my body is weak” not to mention the emotional roller-coaster kicked out the last specks of my composure.
The casual tone these words are spoken with. The audacity. Well, it’s the truth, after all. Castiel looks at Benny and smiles, like he exactly knows, what Benny wants. Course, it’s special - to have sex with a man. But to kiss one? THAT one? These lips looked so good been busy as hell now so long ago. Now he caught himself staring at them again. Can he? Kiss a man? Kiss his boss? Can he kiss Dean? Because, dear Lord, now he wants to.
Benny doesn’t say anything, he just takes a step closer, holding his cock in his hand, and rubs a head agains Dean’s hole. He’s watching attentively, he wants to remember this - Dean Winchester takes him in. He presses.
Please, let it be real. Please. Please… Not another happy dream, that turns into nightmare, when I’m waking up. Please.
“Hey, what’s up? Kev messed up with polishing again?” He throws over his shoulder, continuing packing.
Benny changes the angle, he leans and grabs Dean’s shoulder. If he likes it hard, Benny’s gonna give it ho him hard. And he does. And he hears it.
Dean stays like this for a little longer, getting comfortable with the sensation of shape and size. He lets his throat squeeze around Benny’s cock, he knows how good it feels.
Hallway light is soft, and so is Deans hand on his shoulder. Benny’s tongue feels at place in Dean’s mouth, his lips feel safe against Dean’s lips. They taste as good, as Benny has imagined. This is the most delicate and breathtaking experience he’ve ever had. Kissing a man.
He’s a little early. It’s not even 8:45, but he walks up the stairs to his office. It’s just a room on the second floor of this loft, that is his repair workshop, but it’s nice, he has furnished it by himself.
“Oh fuck you, sincerely! Would it make you dead or something? To warm it in your palm for five seconds?” Dean bursts with a grimace.
Fuck. Dean puts himself up on this elbows and meets Benny’s gaze, he’s not ashamed anymore, he just wants it to go on and on.
“Yes, I’m… I heard them, I heard everyone. There,” what’s the point on lying? I open my eyes, but look away. I don’t want to talk about it, not now.
“You’re so good, you’re so fucking good, please, don’t stop, holy fuck…” Dean’s whispers, and his head falls back in a silent gasp. Benny licks harder, he’s "so good, he’s so fucking good" and probably only a gun to his head can make him stop at this point.
Benny rolls a condom down his length, he is surprised he’s still hard, considering his emotional condition.
Benny's eyes are open, he leans in and kisses Dean again, basically, just presses his own closed lips to Dean’s, and holds just a bit longer. He doesn’t want to make his boss feel uncomfortable, after all. Except for, when he breaks a kiss, Dean reaches and kisses him back. It’s quick and fumble, but it makes Benny’s heart jump. Now they look at each other, eyes wide, breaths silenced. Fuck, the air is suddenly thick with tension. It’s unbearable. It’s either to let it happen, or to forget and never come back to it. And well, it’s only one step over fear.
Benny’s confused, this is a little awkward, isn’t it? He likes these two, but why would he watch them making out? Or they’re about to quit it, and continue with drinking? And what’s with the tone? Cas doesn’t talk that way. Usually.
And he means it. In his head he has a literal check list, and Benny got an “A” on almost everything, he’s just a perfect candidate for this little project of Castiel’s.
Dean is not hesitant anymore, not shy, he feels safe, too. He want’s to snuggle closer to Benny’s chest, and he does. He want’s to curl his arms around Benny’s waist, and he does. He wants to touch Benny’s face with all tenderness that is there in his fingers, and he does.
His boss is very impressed with his skills, but Benny wants to impress him with another one of his distinguish talents. He will try his best to hear “Benny, please!” from those lips.
“Don’t get me wrong, it was awesome. I mean…” his face winces a little, in realisation of what he had just blurted out, but he continues. “This… this was very interesting… experience. You get me?”
“Am I interrupting something?” Real life Benny clears his throat loudly, standing in the kitchen doorway, snickering.
“That’s it…” He sounds much more enthusiastic, and the explicit arousal in his voice makes Dean’s hand faster on his own cock.
“Because I love you this much” He had to rise his voice a little, for Dean to hear him from the corridor.
“…stay. Here. With me. Please. PLEASE. How many more times do I have to see you go? How many more times do I have burn your body, or watch you explode, or vanish into sticky black mud? How many? Please, please say you won’t leave me again. Please, promise not to fucking die again, Cas. You hear me? Promise. Promise me. Because I can’t take it anymore. I can’t. Can’t…” His hands limply fall down, shoulders shudder in silent cry.
I dare to kiss the top of your head, I dare to cover your knuckles with my palm, carefully, not to wake you up.
The ache in my chest is back, all of a sudden. I don’t understand why. The sound of his laughter – no one knows how desperately I missed it, and blessed I am to hear it again. Then why the ache?
Dean is not far behind, Castiel’s permission and Benny’s famished grip on his body is driving him insane. The sensation inside is immense, and his hand on his cock is at it’s best tense. Loud indiscriminate noises escape his mouth to be buried in Castiel’s neck. Castiel holds him tight, Benny holds him tight. He comes hard, so fucking hard, he probably has loaded it on his own jeans, that are still under the table, but he doesn’t care.
Dean sits on the table in silence. Fuck, that means Castiel is serious, he truly considers Benny to become a part of their sexual interactions. Castiel has chosen him; all of this, all that just happened - it was Castiel’s plan all along.
He laughed a little in surprise, and her smile widened as he took two steps forward and gathered her tiny frame into his arms. She squeezed him tightly, and he closed his eyes against her shoulder.
Dean sighed. He said, “First thing I’m doing when we get back to the bunker is installing a lock on my bedroom door.”
Dean could admit that he missed the kid. Running the universe was surely taking up a lot of his time but still, he could visit more often. But then again, what did Dean know about being God?
He’d gone to Sunday school once or twice as a kid when his dad had dropped him and Sam off with Pastor Jim for the weekend. The teacher had been a crotchety old woman who smelled like peppermints and threatened more than once to whack him over the head with her Bible. Not who Dean would have picked to nurture the minds of young children, but whatever. He’d heard her tell the Genesis creation story once though.
They spent a little more time at the lookout talking and splitting the piece of cherry pie Dean had picked up, knowing that Cas was going to go back on his stance of not wanting any of it. That’s why he’d gotten two forks after all. The look Cas gave him over it was only bitchy for a second or two before he dug in.
She looked back down at her beer, unwilling to meet his eyes after her confession, and Dean felt the thousand pound weight in his chest grow a little bit heavier.
“It’s a shame I missed it,” Dean said, and then he downed the rest of his glass and scooted it forward for Donnie to fill again.
The comment stung a little more than he was sure she’d meant for it to. He wasn’t her dad, but thinking about her dad made him think about Cas. He’d cared so damn much about his wayward pseudo-daughter, and now he was gone and it really clicked for Dean in that moment that Claire had lost another parent. Dean should probably feel the urge to step up and be there for her, because it’s what Cas would want, but looking at her now just made him feel like he’d failed yet another person.
The kiss was surprisingly gentle, considering the circumstances, and that wasn’t what Dean wanted at all. He sucked Donnie’s lower lip into his mouth and bit at it, relishing the subsequent moan and fingers tightening at his waist. He took the opportunity to slide his tongue past Donnie’s lips and deepen the kiss.
“I’ve seen my brother die before,” he said, his voice quiet, “but watching him forget himself?” Sam paused and looked back at Dean. “This might be worse.”
Radio stations faded in and out as they drove, and Dean absentmindedly tapped one hand on the steering wheel along with them. The other was stretched across the console, wrapped up in Cas’s. He’d imagined this exact scenario before, although it had always been a farfetched hope. Now that he had it, the reality was equally everything he expected and also a little overwhelming. Mostly, as the miles stretched out in front of them, Dean was thinking about what it all meant.
It was around that time that the bathroom door opened, and Sam lost Dean’s attention entirely. Cas watched warily as Dean’s eyes followed him from the entrance of the bathroom until he was standing not two feet in front of them. Dean himself was acting beyond weird, maybe the weirdest he’d been all morning, and that was saying something.
His answer didn’t objectively make a ton of sense, but Dean thought he knew what he meant anyway. Whatever Cas had experienced as angel wasn’t like being human and looking out into something bigger than you could ever dare to be. Like standing on the edge of the vast unknown, no idea what lay in its depths. He thought a little hysterically that it felt sort of like the freedom they’d recently found themselves saddled with.
He dug his hand into his jeans pocket and pulled out his phone, sliding his thumb across it and answering with a huffy, “
So, he and Cas went on a road trip. It was late November, too cold for the leaves to have much color left in them, but there was still something beautiful about the haunting, barren trees and endless browning fields that littered their drive through northwest Kansas. They’d decided to go to the beach, mostly because Cas confided that he’d never actually been to one for fun. It was enough of an excuse for Dean, so they set out, northern California bound.
He held up a finger to shush her and motioned for her to stay put as he pulled a gun out of the back of his pants and held it in front of him. He crept down the hallway with the practiced silence of a trained hunter, holding the gun up around every corner only to be met with another empty corridor. Finally, he got to the last remaining entryway to the war room and paused, preparing himself for whatever might be waiting for him. Then he rounded the corner, and… there was Cas.
“Yes, Dean, angels are real,” Cas said. “Although, this one wasn’t a very good example of one. His father had given him orders, and his instructions were clear. He was to rescue the righteous man from hell and then return to heaven to carry out his father’s plan.”
Cas could feel his eyes widen, but Dean just smiled in response to his bewilderment. Then, ever so slowly, he leaned in. Cas held his breath when Dean stopped, his lips just a breath away from touching Cas’s. Giving him a choice. Cas summoned every ounce of bravery Dean had taught him over years and leaned in the rest of the way.
It was a real hole in the wall kind of place. The decor looked like it was designed by a biker gang, with a mixture of neon lights and metal highway signs. There was a group of what appeared to be truckers playing pool in the back left corner, the kind of crowd Dean would have tried to hustle in another life. As it was though, he and Cas slid into a table by the window after placing their orders at the register.
“I wasn’t sure you were ever going to take the hint,” Donnie said, and his breath was hot against Dean’s mouth.
The three of them brought life to the bunker, each in their own way. The quiet seemed to belong solely to Dean. It clung to him like a heavy wet blanket, silencing conversations and laughter as soon as he rounded the corner. He wasn’t sure if they were worried about upsetting him or if he just really looked so pathetic that he sucked the joy out of any room he entered. Both could be true, he supposed. It wasn’t like he’d been great company since…. well, since.
Sam laughed a little helplessly and leaned against the counter. He said, “I don’t know. Maybe it won’t, but it has to be better than keeping it all inside until you eventually explode.”
Sam paused and went back, slowing down the footage. They watched as Dean walked out the door, and then a man stepped out of the shadows around the corner of the building. Sam paused.
“If you don’t find the grimoire and thus the way to reverse the spell, the curse will keep erasing his memories until eventually, he doesn’t remember how to swallow or breathe, and then, well,” she looked over her shoulder in Dean’s direction, “Dean Winchester will die.”
The next morning, Dean made breakfast while Claire sat at the table with her phone in her hands. She wasn’t usually the chatty type to begin with, but she’d been silently typing all morning every time he’d glanced in her direction.
“Don’t know that either,” Dean said. Then he paused and added, “Hey, what do you say about waffles? Meet me at Waldo’s.”
Sam looked up to see if he was joking, and apparently he wasn’t. He said, “Yeah, he’s back at the motel. Said he didn’t want breakfast.”
Cas wasn’t naive enough to think that any small victory was a guarantee in their lives, but he thought that hearing it was maybe the lifeline Sam needed to keep going. He nodded.
He pushed open the door slowly, as if something might be waiting to jump out at him, and stood stockstill as the empty room revealed itself. It looked exactly the same, which was both horrifying and less terrible than he’d expected. There was no black sludge on the floor, but his heartbeat pounded in his ears as he took one and then two steps inside. Every beat brought the flash of a memory.
It was early the next morning when Sam’s phone rang. He and Cas exchanged a quick look before he grabbed it and saw it was an unknown number. Still, considering Dean had been missing for twelve hours, he answered.
...and then he bolted upright, and the darkness disappeared. In its wake, he was sitting in his room in the bunker, twisted up in his own bedsheets, and the air entered his lungs easily as he gasped and clutched his chest.
Cas frowned at that and tilted his head a little as he stared at Dean. He said, “I assure you, if I had known it would upset you that much, I never would have…”
He could still hear Dean and Cas bickering behind him, which was one welcome sign of normalcy at least, as he paced to the other side of the room to make the call. Rowena, although more amused than she should have been by the whole thing, confirmed that it was a witchy curse called ‘obliviate’. The good news was that they should be able to cure it by killing the witch, which is what they were there to do in the first place.
Without giving it a single thought, because he was fucking tired of only thinking about it, he said, “I love you.”
“Fine,” she said. “He ordered burgers to go. It was gonna be a minute because we were slammed.” She turned to Dean. “Then you knocked back… four shots of tequila? Put some ‘sick jams’ on the juke, and then you hit the bull.”
She chewed on her lower lip for a moment as she twisted her bottle around on the table in front of her.
He grabs Dean by the hair and pulls his head back. He grabs a handful of Dean’s ass. He kisses Dean’s neck with his open mouth, greedily, all tongue and teeth, and Dean loses his composure in the exact second. Jesus, he loves to be taken like this. Abruptly, roughly, demandingly, and Cas knows it, continuing his way on Dean’s neck, up to his mouth.
“Um…” Dean swallows. Well, damn… But he didn’t even thought about it at that moment, and he had no chance to slide anything in between Benny’s flow. “No.”
“So um.. it’s the way you do it?” Benny tries to keep the conversation going, because to stay like this in silence is even more awkward.
“Breathe” Castiel’s hand mercifully slows down and slides out, giving Dean a little break. He breathes, until his shaking is less violent.
“Father?” My eyes are open, but I can’t see clearly, the light is blinding me. “It’s time to go home. I’m here to take you home...” I want to reach this light, I want to touch it, I want to feel it. But I’m too weak, my arms won’t move, my body is numb.
“Dude! First “I’m not gay”, then he’s gonna tap my ass?” Dean laughs at that. “No way he’s gonna do both!”
“If you think it’s a funny game, Benny, you are wrong and you should go right now.” His voice is quiet, smooth, barely audible, no sign of anger or annoyance, but it causes a nervous shiver to run through whole Benny’s body. “Is it a game to you, Benny?”
“I mean, he most likely will start with something like…” Cas cleans his throat to make the better resemblance of Benny’s voice “Listen, boss, I’m not gay!” It came out very close to his manner of speech, and it makes Dean snort with laughter.
Something wakes me up -  I hear a quiet knock on the door. I open my eyes to see it opens. Sam’s face shows in a doorway, he looks concerned, but then looks at the bed and smiles softly. He nods to me and closes the door. I turn my face to the other side to see at what he was smiling. Dean is lying on his side right next to me. In a dim light of night lamp, I see his cheek, pressed to my shoulder, and his arm on my chest.
Hand leaves his body alone in fast movement, and Dean sucks the air into his lungs, he nearly falls down in abruptness.
“Yes?” Cas is decisive but attentive. He is careful, he needs to make sure he doesn’t push Dean’s limits too far. He looks patiently, waiting for the answer to appear in Dean’s eyes.
Dean looks at them from the floor, as Castiel pets his hair. His husband captures his gaze, and he waits, until he sees a plea in it. And there is it, not in just in the eyes, but all over Dean’s face. Castiel knows this face, he loves this expression.
«Jack brought you back. It took him a while, that bitch was too furious. Remember, how he blow himself up in the empty?», I nod again, of course I remember. «Well, he woke up everyone. So it couldn't sleep amymore, with everyone awake there…» I close my eyes, I need to make sure I don't hear them anymore.
“I’m…fine.” I want to say more, but I don’t know what, exactly, I don’t know how. My voice came out constrained, like it’s not mine. I try to smooth it, clearing my throat.
Dean’s breath is deep and peaceful, he enjoys the light sense of anticipation, that slowly builds inside him. He waits for it to grow into need that will fills his mind completely, until he’s so desperate, he’s gonna ask for it. He loves this part.
“I can’t take it anymore. And I don’t want to. I don’t need to. We won. We did it. And the last piece missing was you. You.”
“Give him hell, sweetheart” Cas leans and whispers to his ear, it’s very quiet, barely audible, his voice is sliding down the octave, as he pronounces every next word. ”Show him how you love to hold it in your mouth. I want him to see, man can love another man’s cock”
That is not what Castiel meant. And Benny is clearly having a ridiculously good time, but he shouldn’t. It’s not a “fun” anymore, he has to take it seriously, so Castiel makes sure he does. He didn’t plan to touch Benny today, but well, it’s time to improvise a little.
“You should rest. Not sure if you’re able to sleep now, but you staying in bed until you feel better, okay?” he’s holding my hand in his, rubbing his thumb on my knuckles.
This is overwhelming - to feel Benny’s cock thrusts fiercely into his hole, and Castiel’s soft kiss on his mouth. Dean nearly loses it.
Or, there’s gotta be sewing kit here somewhere? I want to thread a needle and sew you to me. With such large and strong stitches, I darned Sam's pants like that when I was a kid, I know these stitches are reliable, believe me.
I want to touch him, to hold him, but I shouldn't. He's here, and that should be enough. It was enough, though? Through all these years. Just to stand by his side, to know he's alive and safe. To care about him, to fight for him, to kill for him.
“I’ve been thinking… Lately I often fuck him with my cock and a vibrator. And I think, he is skilled enough already, to take both of us.”
Geez. He needs some water. Or some vodka. Or both. He walks towards the sink to fill his glass with water. He drinks slowly. He can do vodka later, at home. Whatever this evening is gonna end with, he will definitely need a good drink.
Lines of my bones, enveloped within my skin, so tensed and fragile. The tremble of my hands in the morning, as I try but can’t find you next to me. My old clothes, my new clothes. Corners of my house.  My car’s seat upholstery. Soft recoil of my revolver. Food on my plate. Blood in my arteries. My “yes”s and my “no”s and cracks in my voice, as I say so.
Castiel wants to know. To hear it. Right now, fucking like this. He wants Dean to tell him, what… things they did to each other. He looks into Dean’s eyes so attentively.
If Cas puts it this way…. If he asks Dean, then he’s allowing this to happen. He WANTS this to happen. Benny needs some persuasions, he said? Well...
He licks his thumb again and starts to circle Dean’s rim with it. The skin is soft and malleable, moist with Benny’s spit, tip of his finger nearly slides inside. Castiel is right, Dean is relaxed and ready. And hell, he’s probably very skilled with taking it in his ass. Pleasure and need is written all over his beautiful face.
It’s an “a” or a “c”. Cas in his mind has placed a bet on “a” long time ago, and now it’s time for a showdown. He has a good poker face, so no one can see he’s nervous. But too many things depend on this particular moment.
Castiel moves slowly, smearing warmed lube on Dean’s cheeks. Not all over, but far enough from the hole. He wants his boy to have enough time to relax utterly, to become soft and compliant. He likes to touch his skin, he likes to touch him like that.
I can’t drive alone. I keep seeing your gaze on my right. I see it, when I look into the rear view mirror too. Like you’re still here, around, waiting to say something. Or just sitting silently, pervading the air with the appeasement of your presence. Looking at me.
Once it touches Dean’s skin again, he gasps. Trembling slowly fades, as he relaxes into the feeling. So delicate and soothing.
They really had a conversation on topic. On Benny. How does he feel after everything, what is he thinking, is he really into men...
He squeezes a little more lube on his fingers and rises his eyebrows at Dean, whose legs are now hanging off the table. He immediately pulls them up, knees close to his chest.
“Okay… okay” he thinks. He can live with this. He doesn’t let panic to rise once again in his guts. He’s calm. He’s fine. He gotta play it cool. Besides, maybe he’s not that special at all. Maybe they do it regularly with other guys.
Dean is knocked out. His eyes are wide with amazement. Cas just asked him WHAT? Okay wait… Dean, Dean doesn’t even know. He never thought about it like… that. He’s happily married man and he’s in love with his husband. That’s it. And Benny, he's cool, yeah. He likes Benny. Benny is funny, he’s a good worker, though. Benny is smart. Benny is handsome. Benny is strong. His arms are so strong, his shoulders… Dean had never thought about Benny like that. Or…
Somehow, breakups seem to be hard even when you aren’t the one whose relationship ended. At least, this is what Castiel decides
Still without looking up, Castiel responds, “Don’t worry, you won’t be subjected to it anymore. At least not until finals.”
“I don’t know,” he confesses. He finds her the easiest to speak to, for she, after all, has the least connection to the Winchesters out of anyone else in his life. Kelly was always more his friend than Sam or Dean’s, perhaps the only person for whom that was true.
Once home, Dean falls face first into his bed, burying his face into his pillows. He just lays there a moment, marinating in his own misery. He doesn't move until he hears his text tone go off. He roots around blindly for his phone before he remembers he put it in his overnight bag. He turns his head to look across the room, and sure enough, there's the bag, sitting by his bedroom door. He contemplates not moving, but then the phone goes off again. He pushes himself out of bed, shuffling across the room in his socked feet to retrieve the obnoxious thing. When he checks it, there's two messages from Anna.
She shrugs noncommittally. "Yeah, so? Just cuz I love her doesn't mean she can't be a party pooper. After all, that's why she has me around!"
Except as her face twists into an expression of grief, her eyes squeezing shut, he does understand, as much as he doesn’t want to, as much as he’s tried to deny it.
Castiel does not ask on what, at this point he surely knows, but it has somehow become harder to approach him than easier.
“Balthazar is an ass anyway,” she says, then she turns on the TV, some mindless game show playing, and the two of them settle in for the afternoon.
He pats her back placatingly, pondering, "Didn't know sass from ass... Ironic considering that now I love both."
His appetite is gone, but he sits with his friends all the same. He thinks maybe, by some miracle, that he can do this. He even finds himself forgetting, for a moment, laughing along at all the good-natured teasing and talking. It’s nice and distracting. At least until Charlie asks where Balthazar is.
Cas bites his lip, the knots growing tighter. He loves Sam like a brother and doesn't want this to negatively impact their relationship. It may all be pointless worrying; after all, Sam has never treated Charlie any differently, but this is different. Castiel isn't a woman, after all.
Dean quickly sends up a thanks to whatever spiritual whatnot lives up in the sky for small miracles.
Charlie holds her hand up in a placating manner. "No, I know that, and that was super lame of him. But... are you mad because he lied to you about being sick this weekend or..." She trails off meaningfully, and Dean just stares at her suspiciously.
"You don't say." Dorothy is giving him an assessing look, as though she's analyzing him for quality control of the gay population of Lawrence High.
Dean gives a nervous laugh, rubbing the back of his neck. “I'm fine,” he says, to which Cas only frowns harder. Of course the guy sees right through him.
“I really don’t see how it’s a problem,” Dorothy chimes, and Dean scowls at her. She shrugs at him in return. “What? I don’t. I mean, do I think it’s a little weird that neither of you told anyone and still went to homecoming together? Sure, but I also get why you did it, and at least It seems like Anna was a lot nicer about it then she probably should have been. Plus, this opens up opportunities for you to be honest with yourself.”
"'Course I can. It's my damn house," Dean grumbles in one last ditch attempt to... To what? Prove he's right, even when he knows he's wrong?
“You know I’m here for you, right?” Castiel says. He hasn’t asked about the breakup, partly because he worries Dean will deem it something like a chick-flick moment, partly because he is somehow frightened to know just what happened, but Dean is still his best friend. If Dean wants to ignore it, Castiel will (gratefully) accept that, but it feels wrong not to make sure Dean knows he can talk about it if he wants to.
It’s a moment more before Dean actively acknowledges him, long enough that Castiel begins to doubt whether or not he should have done this at all to begin with.
, he thinks, feeling particularly unforgiving. Because yes, maybe Cas has been handling this all wrong, but he’s still allowed to be mad about how his boyfriend acted today. With all that in mind, he very pointedly does not acknowledge Balthazar as he opens up his locker to swap out his books for his backpack, gathering all relevant things he needs for the night’s homework.
Sam sits back in his seat, obviously placated, but Dean looks less convinced. He says, “Oh, okay,” but he’s also giving Cas a look that says, “We’ll talk about this later.”
Anna looks up at him, eyes searching his, and for a moment, he thinks she's going to play dumb or lie, but instead, she says, “You don't love me, do you?”
Surprise! Apparently that giant let down of a finale drug me back into this fandom and this ship (we aren't going to talk about how deep I'm back in it or the fact I was kicking and screaming the whole time).
"I don't know about that. You're the ones crazy enough to sign up for AP courses, after all," Dean says with a shrug and a smirk, watching Cas out of the corner of his eye.
They reach the Impala, and he throws his bag in the backseat before turning to face his best friend. "Look, was there something you wanted? I need to go pick up Sam."
"I'm sorry, he's not usually like this. I'll go talk to him." And then Anna is up and leaving, as well.
He only spares a half a second to look at them all, lined up and mocking him, knowing that the first few have personal messages in them, back when his father still tried to pretend that he thought about him. The later ones all bare only the same mass-produced signature any other signed copy has.
"The front passenger side! Every time I try to sit there, you tell me it's Sam's spot. Yet there Cas is, up front with you."
He quickly hides the Carver Edlund book under his bed. There’s no use in giving her any hope for reconciliation there. “Of course.”
The question seemingly comes from no where, and it about knocks the wind out of him. He manages to shrug, unable and unwanting to give any answer beyond that. But he can feel this heart rate ratcheting up, feel his stomach clenching around nothing but bile.
As it turns out, Mary is right; a hot shower really does help Dean feel more human. No, it may not erase all the doubts and heartache, but it does wash away the grime of the previous night and unwind muscles he didn’t even know he was clenching. He steps out feeling like he is at least capable of facing some of the world again.
"I'm sure Grandmother won't mind, but I'll call and let her know," Cas answers, exiting the room at a much more sedate pace than Charlie.
Castiel finally sits up enough to talk to Anna, giving up on ignoring her and getting a few more moments of rest. "Anna, while this may come as a shock to you, I don't remember anything from Friday after your shitty flask of tequila."
Cas knows it’s a choice he shouldn’t make, not right now, and not for many reasons, but the idea of not going home, of getting to stay in this house with his best friend, it’s too much to turn down. He doesn’t even bother considering asking his grandmother for permission - she’s never said no to him staying with Dean, and she’ll likely be overjoyed to see him staying out of the house again.
He turns up the music and they drive the rest of the way to Sam's school without a word spoken between them.
"I'm so sorry for lying to you, Dean,"Castiel says so earnestly, Dean could never think he means the apology any less than 200%.
"No way!" Charlie is staring at him, eyes wide and mouth agape. When he doesn't immediately offer up any more information, she starts whacking him in the arm. "Well go on! Out with it! Tell me about her!"
Castiel would like to say that at some point after Dean and Anna’s breakup life went back to normal, that he picked back up his individual friendships with both people and carried on with life while maintaining his own relationship. He’d love to say that, really, but he can’t.
The two of them meander through until they find the old monkey bars, not that most of this equipment isn’t old these days. The place has definitely seen better days, and Dean can’t help wondering how many kids play here now.
Dean quickly texts her back before dropping the phone back into his bag and crawling back into his bed, getting under the covers this time.
Cas stares at him in confusion for a moment, brow pinched together and head tilted to the side. Finally, he offers a small smile and says, "Thank you, Dean. I hope so as well. And same to you and the others. Perhaps next time Balthazar and I will be able to join you all."
Balthazar shoots him a winning grin, leaning casually against the locker next to Castiel's. "So, what are your plans this weekend?"
Balthazar's family moved to Lawrence at the start of the summer, so he'll be starting his senior year at Lawrence High School. His family moved in next door to Anna's, which explains how he knows her. He isn't quite so sure how he got Anna to open up about her recreational activities though.
“No,” Cas says firmly. He won’t hear anymore of that from Jack - it’s too close to the blatant disregard Chuck had for them all, and Castiel will not see his own son fall to similar temptations.
"Wonderful." Maybe it's just wishful thinking or transference, but Cas is fairly certain he can hear the smile in Balthazar's voice from across the line.
“Yeah, I’m sure, and I don’t really appreciate you insinuating whatever it is you’re trying to get at here. I’ve been trying really hard to be supportive,” he bites back. “Do
They fall into silence, and it makes Castiel antsy. Not the bad kind of antsy, like he wishes someone would do something, but the excited kind of antsy that comes from wanting to do something himself.
“I know, Cas. Thanks,” Dean says. Castiel can hear the smile and the gratitude. That’s enough to ease his conscience and let him fall to sleep.
“You’ve been hanging out with him a lot recently,” she notes, and Cas feels his stomach drop down to his toes. “Is there a reason I haven’t gotten to meet this boy yet?”
It isn’t until he’s on his way out of the room that he spots it - the book on his desk. The Carver Edlund book on his desk. The one that he’d stuffed under his bed yesterday morning and never pulled back out. His grandmother must have been cleaning and found it, exactly like he didn’t want her to. Something twists in his stomach, a mixture like guilt and shame and abandonment issues and not wanting to disappoint anyone. He swallows and breaths and dutifully pushes the feelings back down to ignore them, as is his wont, before picking the book up and putting it back in its place on the shelf.
(“It’s not like I’m excited about it either, Dean, but I’d rather do it now instead of staying up half the night because I procrastinated.”
I didn't die and neither did this fic! Slightly longer explanation for my absence after the chapter. But hey, this isn't beta'd. All mistakes are mine, but I tried to catch them all.
“It’s fine, Dean. You were having a bad night, one that I suspect involved alcohol and poor teenage decision making. You don’t need to apologize.”
Dean zones into watching the road in front of him as his brother and best friend fall into conversation, and everything finally just feels
Balthazar’s face immediately lights up when he sees Cas. “Cassie, hey! What a pleasant surprise! You never walk me to lunch.” He swings his arm around Cas’s shoulders, and Cas takes a moment to bask in the attention. Since the two of them spent the day together on Sunday, Cas is realizing just how content he is with the other boy, how happy. He was sure all his doubts were gone.
Castiel would like to say that at some point after Dean and Anna’s breakup life went back to normal, that he picked back up his individual friendships with both people and carried on with life while maintaining his own relationship. He’d love to say that, really, but he can’t. The fact of the matter is that he fails at all of these things, though some more spectacularly than others. Anna maintains her distance, and, selfishly, he feels the timing couldn’t be worse. There are the SATs and ACTs added in with every other bit of advanced course work he has, and without his best study buddy, the panic sets in that he will eventually fall behind. That very same panic offers a great excuse for his other behaviors though. He manages to hold everyone at arm’s length while still maintaining some sort of social interactions with them, and he gets the added excuse that his behavior is all justified.
“I don’t know if I can make it through the next few days,” Dean gripes, all but sprawling himself across the lunch table.
Dean pulls back enough to look her in the eyes. "Hey, no, don't apologize. I was acting fishy, I get that. But I hope you know I would never cheat on you. I really, really like you, Anna."
“What are you waiting for?” Kelly asks him once when he is visiting her. She remains in her garden more than she ventures out of it, though she does have loved ones here, has access to them.
Finally, Cas smiles at him, and though it’s small and fragile, it stills warms something inside of Dean.
As she turns and walks out the door, Castiel isn’t quite sure what to make of what she’s just said. Surely she can’t know, right? More than that, his religious, church-going, God-fearing grandmother couldn’t be okay with it, right? It’s honestly all just too much to think about given his lack of sleep, so he shelves those concerns for another time.
Dean gets to school early the next day, hoping to catch Castiel before class starts. They may not be able to hash out their problems in that time, but maybe they can talk enough to get the ball rolling and not make lunch awkward as hell.
When they get to Castiel’s house, he expects her to just drop him off and leave. Instead, she turns the car off and comes inside with him.
Sam regards him for a moment more before breaking out into an adorable grin. "That's awesome! Congrats, man!"
Even as Dean is saying, "Maybe something is going around?" Charlie is shooting a skeptical look at Cas and Anna, but perfect Anna Milton's act is unshakeable.
“Look,” she says, “you went off to find a prince when we were four, and I think you need to admit you did.”
Dean shrugs, but Cas knows it’s a play at casual in a way Dean never seems to truly feel. “Yeah, well, what can I say, I was feeling nostalgic.”
Dean swallows past the lump in his throat, fights back the tears that threaten to make their reappearance. “Mom, I screwed up,” he manages to choke out.
"Hey, sleepy head, wake up. It's class time, not sleep time," Anna scolds as she pokes Cas in the side with the eraser of her pencil.
Castiel searches Dean’s eyes. “I don’t understand,” he says, because while he thinks maybe he does, wants to believe he does, he’s also so incredibly terrified to let himself hope.
Leaning up and bracing his arms on the backs of the front seats, Sam grins at Dean and Castiel. "Hey Cas! I haven't seen you in awhile!"
He screws up his courage and whispers into the darkness, "Charlie fell asleep. Was about to come check on you."
Mary scowls at her son. "Sam, watch your language." She then turns a kind smile on Castiel. "Congratulations, dear. Sam's right, though, he better watch his step." She winks.
She spins around and stalks towards him, jabbing a finger into his chest hard enough to bruise. "I knew you had a reputation! I knew what everyone said, but Castiel assured me you were a good guy! Joke's on me, I guess!" Angry tears fill her eyes and spill over in ugly rivulets.
She waves her arms back and forth violently in a nixing manner. "No, no, I'm not saying that. I know you aren't, but... I'm just saying... maybe you're feeling hurt because he kept that from you?"
It's a soft kiss, pleasing in ways other kisses in Castiel's life have not been, probably in large part to do with the fact that they're both sober. It stays chaste, and far sooner than Cas cares for, Baalthazar is pulling away and bidding him a good night. Like a lovesick puppy, Cas stands on the porch and watches him pull away, already knowing it's going to be another sleepless night.
Summer before senior year is a surprisingly lonely one for Castiel. He spends most of it sitting at home, rereading postcards from his wayward mother. Charlie does her best to see him as much as she can, but between her normal travels with her family and the time she dedicates (most understandably) to her girlfriend Dorothy, it isn't as much as either of them would like. Dean, however, basically falls off the face of the planet in the couple of months that they aren't in school. He'd begun dating the unequivocally perfect Anna Milton towards the end of junior year, and, as such, has been up her ass ever since. He barely so much as speaks to Cas all summer, and the couple of times they do make plans, Dean bails last minute to go see Anna, with nothing more than a shot out text of "You understand."
But staring up at the endless sky, he thinks that if not for that cruelty, he wouldn’t be here, now. He would not have met Dean Winchester. He would not have the friends he has or live the life he lives. He thinks, with a sudden, almost forgiving clarity, that had he not experienced that loneliness as a child, he would perhaps be far more lonely now.
, Charlie. I was mad that he lied," Dean responds through gritted teeth, all but spitting out the other boys name as though it leaves a foul taste in his mouth.
Anna bites her lip nervously, eyes downcast. "I just thought it might be nice to do it when we were all together, you know? We're all in relationships now, and just... I thought it might be nice."
The memory has fallen away over time, become hazy and distant, almost unwanted for the pain and circumstances around it. Now it comes back to him vividly, forcefully, and it makes him cry more.
It isn’t, of course, he’s being a terrible friend and an even worse boyfriend, proven not lease of all when he overhears Dean one afternoon reassuring Balthazar that it won’t always be like this. It’s another bit of guilt that he pushes to the side. None of this accomplishes anything in the end because once the bulk of the testing is over, once the study groups no longer need to meet, once the course work slows down in prep for the holiday week, he still has all the same problems he had before, plus the new ones he has created.
Cas looks at Dean expectantly, knowing Charlie is doing the same. He can actually see the gears in his friend's head turning, trying to come up with a logical excuse.
She rolls her eyes. "Don't play smart with me, Shurley, you know what. Tell me about this mystery person! Like now! You know, before we get to lunch and all the party poopers rain on our parade?"
He can see the subtle way Balthazar clenches his teeth. “No, it’s fine. I can take you.” They both know that “another way” means Dean, whom Balthazar has been prickly about ever since Dean and Anna’s breakup. Which on the one hand, Cas understands because he knows his own internal turmoil, but given that he’s done his best to not be alone with Dean, it also frustrates him. If he were to actually try and maintain their friendship right now, where would that put this relationship?
Dean slides into the seat across from Cas, who seems completely oblivious to the world around him. Only when Dean places a hand over the guy's papers does he startle and look up. Castiel inhales sharply, not quite a gasp, but definitely an expression of surprise.
has been put in his head either way). The only way he knows it happened for real is that she doesn't kiss him except for one small peck on the cheek, a barely there ghosting of flesh of flesh just for the benefit of fooling their friends.
She sighs the sigh of someone who knows there's nothing to be done about it, and so there's no use worrying about it. "Anyway, please don't tell him we talked about this, okay? I don't think he even realizes it yet, and I'm selfish enough to want to hold onto him while I can. Can you forgive me for that?"
But Cas doesn't answer. He's glowering at his beer bottle instead. As a matter of fact, he's been suspiciously quiet the whole night, didn't even say hey when Dean walked up. It kind of pisses Dean off, actually, because the alternative is to feel bad, and he already has enough insecurity where Cas and Anna are concerned that he doesn't want to dwell on that tonight.
He tries not to panic, mentally replaying his conversation with Balthazar. Did he say anything incriminating? Would she have been standing there long enough to hear it?
He doesn’t lay in the floor wallowing for as long as he’d honestly like to. Eventually, the girls will wake up, and he doesn’t think he can face them. Worse still, he doesn’t think he can face Charlie’s parents when they realize Dorothy stayed over and that there are more than a few beers missing from the fridge in the garage. So, he braves the sunlight and the harrowing journey of sneaking back to his own house.
“It wasn’t right,” Cas admits. Then he smiles sardonically, looking back to the ground. “I walked home the night of homecoming, after…” He glances up at Dean, and Dean knows what he’s saying without him having to say it. Thankfully, Cas seems to get that too because Dean isn’t sure he could handle having to hear Cas explicitly say “after we had sex.”
Dorothy spits out her beer and begins choking, but neither friend is paying her any attention at this point.
Which is why he about jumps out of his skin when Dean whispers, "Charlie fell asleep. Was about to come check on you."
Once the cleaning is done and the last of the guests has finally left, Dean realizes just how in a funk Cas is. He’s quiet, a far away look in his eyes, and Dean is struck by sudden inspiration. He’s not sure if it will cheer Cas up, but it’s worth trying. Besides, now that he’s thought of it, he finds it’s something he wants to do, as well.
"This is the library, Dean," Castiel whispers, and Dean is torn between wanting to punch Cas because
He does understand. He understands that Dean tends to think with his dick more than his brain, and he understands that sometimes it is very hard to be friends with someone like that. And Cas finds himself starting to resent Anna, which isn't really fair because he actually likes her. She's smart and kind and gorgeous, to boot (which often leaves Charlie and Cas pondering just what, exactly, she sees in Dean). It isn't her fault that Dean is being an awful friend, as Dean has always been the type to do whatever he wants. It is simply a fact that, up until this point, most of the time 'doing what he wants' included Castiel. But as stated, Anna Milton is perfect, so Cas can kind of see why Dean is hooked.
He smiles at his boyfriend before leaning in to give him a quick peck on the cheek. “I wanted to give you a heads up,” he says. “Dean and Anna broke up.”
, Cas finds himself thinking, a sudden wash of calm running through him. If that’s really how Balthazar feels, if that’s really what he thinks, this was never going to work, any potential romantic feelings between Dean and him or no. Dean has been his best friend since he moved here, alone and scared and sad; Dean had been his very first friend. Dean had seen value in him when even Castiel’s own parents hadn’t.
He fixes her with a deadpan stare, and she rises to the challenge of a staring match. Neither of them says a word, continuing their battle of wills until the teacher starts class. He tries to say something after class, but she bolts out almost as soon as the bell rings.
Castiel does his best to relax in his seat and try not to scowl as he thinks about how he’d like to have the option to not comment on something, too.
Cas since school ended. He glances at Dorothy who is no help at all because she just shrugs at him, giving him the
Dean wraps her up in another hug, and this time she leans into it instead of fighting it. "We good?" he asks.
Anna smiles up at him, and it almost looks sad. Dean's chest constricts painfully. “Not as much as some other things,” she says.
“The world seems endless when you’re a child,” Castiel agrees, though there’s a distinct sadness to his voice.
Add that to the list as another reason he’s avoiding being alone with either Balthazar or Dean. And yes, he knows he’s being awful and unfair to everyone. But damn it, why can’t life ever just be simple? He’d decided to accept the happiness in front of him for once, and it all had to go to shit.
Castiel swallows around the sudden lump in his throat and assures her, "I'm not even sure what there is to forgive, but of course I do. And I promise I won't talk to Dean about it."
Sam's expression turns deadly serious just as quickly as it had become ecstatic, which throws Cas for a moment, until the kid says, "He better treat you right, though, otherwise he'll have to face some Winchester wrath." A sudden laugh that's the product of too many nerves and relief rips out of him, which has Sam grinning again.
Dean can't help grinning, feeling slightly giddy in the moment, even if this kind of good natured ribbing is common for them.
He goes to answer; his voice only comes out as a rough croak; he clears his throat and tries again. “Hey, Mom.”
"Sorry, sorry, had to get the homework for Calculas," Castiel puffs, sliding into the passenger side.
Charlie and Dorothy help Dean fully realize and come to terms with the fact that he does, in fact, have big, gay feelings for Castiel.
Everyone's enjoyment of the conversation is cut short when Dean's voice cuts through the giggles and
They’ve been working uninterrupted for about forty minutes when Dean sets his pencil down and mutters, “Hey, Cas?”
"So legit, what's up with you?" Charlie asks when they're sitting in Dean's room, stuffing potato chips into her mouth.
She grasps his hand in hers, a feather light touch as she runs her thumb across his knuckles contemplatively. “I don’t like feeling jealous like this,” she says softly, watching their hands, just as he is.
Guilt finally wins the war as a look of hurt flashes across Dean's face even as he says, "Hey, it's cool, man. I understand."
So meant to post this much sooner. It's been sitting on my computer for awhile now, waiting for me to give it a final once over, but, ya know, life and insecurity and crap? But it's here. Shorter than I'd initially hope for, but this chapter was in a state of half-written from like two years ago and picking it back up was awkward. Next chapter should hopefully be longer and flow better.
He hadn’t been ready to tell Charlie or Dean about Balthazar over the weekend (still isn’t ready to tell Dean, but that’s a whole other can of worms), because though they are his very best friends, he also knows their love his so powerful, so present, and he couldn’t have handled that. He couldn’t deal with facing any of that head on.
Dean offers a shaky smile, suddenly really wishing he'd had the foresight to plan something out. Fuck, he needed damn notecards for something like this, which only made him feel worse. This was his best friend sitting across from him, and he had no clue how to even start a conversation.
The whole situation gets so bad that at one point during dinner, Charlie kicks him in the shin under the table. It hurts like a bitch and is enough to make Dean put his phone away for the remainder of the night.
“The park, Dean?” Dean doesn’t have to look at Cas to know there’s finally a smile of some kind on his face.
“Mom, I think I’m in love with Cas, but he’s with someone else, and I’m such an idiot. I got drunk on beer at Charlie’s last night and I called him and left this stupid message, and I don’t think I said anything serious before Charlie caught me and hung up the phone, but he’s going to know something’s up and I don’t know what to do.” He spits it all out in a rush, barely breathing, and once he’s done, he buries his face in his hands. He doesn’t know what kind of response she’s going to have, but he knows he can’t bear to look at her when she has it.
Cas smiles to himself in the dark, curling into the blankets and pillows. "Yeah," he answers, "I think I really do."
“I know I’m an asshole,” Cas whispers, and it moves Dean into action, wrapping his arms around Cas and holding him tight.
Dorothy shrugs a shoulder. “Then you’re straight with a Castiel-shaped exception. Does it really matter? The point is that you love the guy.”
It’s a moment longer before Charlie suddenly groans miserably. “Damn it, Cas! You know I suck at secrets!”
Anna shakes her head again, more resolutely this time, and meet's Castiel's gaze. "I know he likes me, but I feel like he only
They take their time settling in and getting their homework together. Castiel suspects Dean would take even longer if he wasn’t there to encourage good studying behaviors in his best friend.
Grace doesn’t for a minute look like she believes him, but still she says, “I’m sure you two will make up.”
Anna is great and all, but nothing beats talking to his best friends about the exciting things in life, and Balthazar definitely counts among those. Besides, Charlie is gay, so he figures maybe she can relate a little more.
Dean about jumps out of his skin, turning to find Charlie charging at him. She grabs for his phone, and he tries to fight her off, but he’s too drunk. He falls down onto his ass while Charlie quickly ends the call.
He only stops when she grabs his arm, huffing and puffing from the exertion of catching up with him.
Once they're all settled, Anna places a reassuring hand on his knee and says, "Hey, you know Balthazar is harmless, right? He's a good guy. Castiel will be okay."
"Did you have a good time?" Balthazar asks softly. The soft glow of the porch light seems to cast a halo around his head.
Dean quickly looks over the counter, sees nothing that looks like pancakes - beginnings or endings of them - and feels a surge of affection and gratitude. He nods. “Thanks, mom.”
Guilt lances through Cas at this, because the holding on thing? It’s exactly what he’d wound up doing, and it had led to so much more heartache in the end.
Despite the fact that most all of Dean’s loved ones are here and available to him, it isn’t hard to find a moment when Dean is on his own. Honestly, Cas wishes it had been harder.
That night is the first since they’ve met that Balthazar doesn’t send Cas a good night text, and Cas tries not to feel upset by it. It makes no sense to feel upset about it. He doesn’t even really want this anymore, he’s mistreated his boyfriend horribly just to avoid feeling alone or like his parents. He has no right to feel stung by this development.
There’s suddenly no guessing for Dean about what Cas means, he gets it. Cas knows how he feels, he’s sure of it, and it doesn’t bring with it the panic he might have expected. Instead, he feels sure - sure that Cas, mourning though he is, feels the same way, and sure that they’ll have plenty of time. For now, he can be this for Castiel.
Sam rolled his eyes and dragged one of the waffles onto his own plate, which Dean must have already asked for.
“It looked like he was headed for the woods, but the bullet casing should confirm which direction Dean fired,” Cas said, already standing and turning to leave the room.
Dean opened his eyes and looked down to find Donnie’s suddenly very concerned face staring back at him.
Cas nodded and watched Dean empty the bullets from the gun he’d used and lock the safety back into place.
Dean was staring at him intently now, and Cas had to look a few inches to his left to escape the critical gaze.
Cas’s words brought the swirling flood of emotions in Dean’s mind narrowing down to a single point as he felt a little bit of anger rise within him.
Sam was clearly smart enough to figure out what that meant, as he hurriedly replied, “Ew, now I’m really sorry I called. Tell Cas I said hi.”
They were silent for a moment. Only the sounds of the old walls settling around them filled the room, as Sam and Eileen had been asleep for hours like normal people. Then she sighed.
Dean stopped and brought his hands up to cover his ears, digging his fingers in his hair like he could pull the sound right out of his head. A low, guttural noise wrenched itself from his chest and out of his mouth instead, and he dropped his hands. The first thing in his line of sight was an old metal chair, so he picked it up and threw it against the wall.
to do the right thing, always, but sometimes I think maybe the world would be better off if I just stopped.”
“Yeah, sure,” Sam said. He watched Dean shovel another waffle onto his plate before saying, “You could have at least called. Last I heard, you were going out to get burgers
He and Cas were hiding from Billie in the bunker. Cas told him about a deal he’d made with the Empty to save Jack’s life, and then he’d started saying a lot of things all at once. That Dean had changed him, had made him care about the whole world. That he loved Dean.
Cas leaned in to kiss him once more, much less passionately than before but still hoping to convey every ounce of love he felt for the ridiculous man in front of him. When he pulled away, Dean was giving him a much shyer smile.
Luckily for him though, he wasn’t taking criticism from his own brain at the moment. So, he shoved the thought right back where it came and dug his fingers into Donnie’s hips hard enough to leave bruises.
“That’s what you get for never knocking,” Dean said, his voice smug and not even slightly embarrassed.
,” Cas had told him once, back when he was engaged in a heavenly civil war. Back when he was secretly working against the Winchesters in a way that would eventually lead to him walking into that pond and not walking out. Dean thought about all those years of him wanting Cas to stay but feeling like he had no right to ask that of him. All those years of Cas apparently wanting to stay but feeling like Dean didn’t want him to.
Dean felt a slightly hysterical laugh fight its way out of his chest, and the feeling only grew when Cas gave him a pleased little smile.
Donnie smelled like alcohol and the lingering scent of bar food, and Dean breathed it in as his back hit the edge of the sink.
Sam had the decency to look down at his salad instead of at Dean when he replied, “Nothing. I’m just saying that if you ever wanna talk, about anything at all, you can.”
Cas looked up at him through his eyelashes like he knew exactly what he was doing to him, and Dean was torn between flipping him off and begging him to never stop.
Dean had seen in the woods by the cabin. Like it was pulling at something right at the edge of his vision that he couldn’t quite reach. Honestly, it scared him a little. Sam had said he’d forgotten, and a cold feeling settled in his chest when he realized that’s exactly what it felt like. Like he’d lost something important, and it was just
Sam didn’t say anything in response, and Dean tapped his fingers on the table as he waited out his brother’s twitchy glare and pursed lips. Like clockwork, he finished pouring his coffee and sighed.
It was the absence of light and sound and warmth. It burrowed inside him, hollowed out his chest and left him feeling cold and empty. He couldn’t breathe, and before he knew it, he’d fallen to his knees. His lungs seized and burned as the water overtook him in rough waves, and he gasped out one final breath in case anyone was listening...
“Yeah, obviously,” Sam huffed. He finished up his text messages and looked at the time on his home screen. “The morgue opens in ten minutes, so we should probably...”
“And you’re some kind of bad guy?” Dean asked, his tone incredibly doubtful. Even in this state, Dean’s blind faith was astounding.
“You didn’t tell me we had company,” Dean hissed in Sam’s general direction, like he thought maybe Cas might not be able to hear him.
She took a sip of some kind of iced green tea concoction and said, “Yep. Turns out it’s one of the only places the other me didn’t already have a dead or missing alias.
He heard more than saw Dean whip around to face Cas out of the corner of his eye with an awestruck expression.
They settled in early after dinner. There wasn’t much to do in bumfuck Wyoming, and it was probably better for them to get some rest and get an early start to the day tomorrow anyways. So Dean was already in his pajamas and propped up against the headboard flipping through the channels on a television straight from 1998 when Cas stepped out of the shower, hair still dripping wet even as he dabbed at it with an off white hotel towel. Dean paused his idle channel surfing as a news report caught his attention.
“No, it isn’t,” Cas said flatly, looking up at the two of them. “Because if the witch is dead, then why is Dean still cursed?”
Cas was right about the bullet. When they found it, it was definitely of the witch-killing variety. So, the three of them settled in for a trek through the now very dark woods in hope of figuring out what Dean’s next move might have been.
“Ignore it,” Cas said, his voice gravelly and rough against Dean’s skin. Dean dug his hands into Cas’s hair and threw his head back, planning to do just that. Then the phone stopped ringing for a few glorious seconds before it started back up again. Cas sat up with an adorably displeased look on his face, and Dean sighed.
Dean, eager and curious, slipped past Cas as they crept through the halls of the ornately decorated house, and Cas did his best to keep an eye on him as well as trying to discern where Sam and Rowena were. It was a little like watching a toddler with a fully loaded gun, and Cas had enough time to start to question the genius of his planning. Then they both heard the sound of breaking glass, and Dean took off towards it, Cas hot on his heels.
Dean stopped on a Star Trek rerun and smiled as he let his head drop on top of Cas’s and pressed a kiss against his temple. Better things worth spending his time doing.
Cas sighed and couldn’t help but laugh a little as he took the gun and put it in Dean’s hands the correct way.
Cas’s heart dropped into his stomach, and he had to remind himself to not show just how terrified he was as he said, “That’s your name. Dean Winchester.”
Dean held it up like a sword and swung it around a few times, which raised Cas’s blood pressure by more than a few points. Then his eyes met Cas’s unamused look, and he sheepishly put it back in the bag where it came from. If only the real Dean Winchester was that easy.
Dean sat down on the mattress across from him and looked at him. He said, “Yeah, Cas. I remember everything.”
The next morning found him having whiskey for breakfast and avoiding Sam’s eyes as he entered the kitchen. Sam wisely chose to say nothing about it.
He couldn’t explain it even to himself, but there was this restless energy inside him screaming to be let out. He was angry, furious even.
It felt like both an eternity and no time at all had passed when Cas’s phone chimed with a new text. He tried not to disturb Dean too much as he fished it out of his pocket with his free hand and unlocked the screen. It was Sam, unsurprisingly. Apparently they’d run into trouble, and they needed backup.
It was just a gentle brush of lips at first, barely a peck, but he sighed as Dean leaned into it and captured his lower lip between his own. The kiss escalated then, and Dean’s other hand slipped inside his trenchcoat to grip his waist, and Cas gripped Dean’s flannel with both hands to pull him in closer. Cas gasped as he leaned back for air, and Dean chased his mouth, hands roaming over any inch of skin he could reach. Cas turned to face him fully on the bed, and Dean took that as an invitation to scoot forward until he was practically in Cas’s lap, one knee beside him on the mattress and one working it’s way between Cas’s thighs. Then, because the universe is a cruel and unjust joke, the door to the hotel opened, and Sam walked in.
“I’m just saying,” Cas said to his salad, “that if we’re only going to get one chance at this life, then I’d rather you live as long as possible.”
