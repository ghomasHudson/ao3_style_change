“I wish I’d known, I’d have taken some of things, no…I just meant…that I would have helped you move it,” she says.  Always a bit awkward, but ever sweet.  John smiles somewhat genuinely.
__________
John feels as if he has just lost something.
He breathes in.  He breathes out.  He thinks about screaming into a pillow.
John laughs at him softly.
“I’m staying, you know,” John says.  “If you’ll have me.”
John sits down at the kitchen table and folds his hands together on the surface.
He goes to John now, lets it happen easily.  He lets the pain fall away, whatever it may mean for him later.
Mycroft is here, three months late.
“Okay,” he says, composing himself. He’s simply so in love, there’s nothing else to be said about the matter.
Sherlock sat in his armchair, plucking at his violin.  John sat across from him, watching him with his hands folded in his lap.
Sherlock falls into a heap and down into his chair. His coat makes for a pile of cloth around his waist, bundled up around the armrests. He doesn’t take his eyes off of John. Sherlock audibly gulps.
“Yes.”
John chuckles a bit.
“No worries,” Sherlock said, eyebrows pulling up. “I thought you spilling hot tea all over me was the really low bit.”
“Probably some other brilliantly mad person.”
“Would you like to come up?  I can put the kettle on,” she asks.  Her eyes are searching.
“Sit down,” Sherlock says. “Please.” So John does.
John is sitting in his chair, drinking tea, reading a novel.  It is quiet like it has not been in weeks, and it’s lovely.  Sherlock is actually asleep in his bedroom.  John had peaked in around nine in the morning and had watched the even breathing of his flat mate and smiled to himself, then closed the door and put the kettle on.
Sherlock was the perfect groom. He was the perfect man in all aspects, but it hadn’t gone unnoticed to John how Sherlock had let go of all control and had let someone else plan his wedding. For a while, Sherlock had been all controlling. He had been spending his evenings yelling at caterers and scolding cake makers. In the end, he had given up, and had only rested his head on John’s shoulder during their first dance as husbands, letting all of his worries fall to the wayside.
“Knows?” John asks.  It must have been a slip of the tongue, but a strange one.
John sighs into his hands and sits down at the table.
“You got angry with me.  You broke a bottle.  Your feet are torn to shreds.”
“She wasn’t supposed to be like that,” John whispers.  He’s repeating himself, he knows.
“I don’t understand it, I never have deserved your friendship.  But it’s good to know that.”  The statement feels selfish to say but there’s no point in lying.
“That’s not really anything new though,” John says.
__________
As Sherlock came back into the venue he was talking with another man. There was just enough of a wall and John was far enough across the room that Sherlock couldn’t see that John had come into the room.
After they have settled John in, John mentions ordering curry and Sherlock can’t help himself, he places the order immediately, ordering all of John’s favorites and John huffs out a laugh.
Sherlock pulls himself up to look at John.  He closes his eyes.
_________
Sherlock feels terrified, so while John falls asleep, he grabs trousers and shirt and goes out to the small patio outside, cigarettes in hand.
“Yeah, yeah I had to leave. I didn’t want to disturb you.”
“No, it’s fine. I do think I made a total arse of myself in front of one of my friends though,” John said with a laugh.
John shrugged. “It was a joint effort.”
“Most people have, John,” Sherlock said, and it was true. He was used to people knowing his name, though he was less used to his name being followed by another. He was still adjusting to the you-plural.
John, after realising that that was somehow his job if the lack of movement from his peers was anything to go by, got up from the sofa and took the slips of paper from Lestrade. He flicked through them before giving them out; Claus – sports hall, Ollie – technical theatre, Glen – sports hall, Mike – Speedy’s, Vlad – catering, Eric – IT support, himself – san, and – Sherlock? John blinked and re-read the last piece of paper. It began:
. He hadn’t realised. That he had said that.
He was talking about a lady called Mrs Turner and something to do with her necklace, and John wasn’t paying any attention. He was more concerned with negotiating the swarms of hungry students that were creating a veritable gridlock inside the hall. He politely pushed through the crowd forming around the pasta bar, Sherlock at his heels, still rambling on.
As he approached, he could see two figures waiting for him, one tall and coat-clad; the other shorter and unfamiliar.
“John…” sang Mike. “You know how I’m your best friend in the whole world…”
“Oh,” Mike said. “That sucks. Have you eaten anything today? You might want to go to the san. Do you want me to t– ?”
Sherlock grinned. “Show me.”
John found Sherlock standing with his back to the door, gazing out of the window, when he returned to their room.
Sherlock smiled.
“Never mind. Let’s just get to biology and hope no-one else is hurt because of your little outburst.”
“Language!” Mrs Watson chided. Sherlock smirked, taking a little of the edge off John’s irritation.
“I asked him again and again what he was doing, and finally he told me that it was important that he correctly identified every single seasoning that the cooks used in the food, and every oil, and every preservative and every way it was cooked and basically everything else about what they were feeding us. I asked him why and he said it was for ‘future reference’. The testing of said stolen food was extensive and thorough, and often smelly and the food took up most, if not all, of the space in the dorm’s one mini fridge. It was annoying to say the least.
“What happened to you?”
He heard the back door banging shut just as he emerged into the utility room, but was distracted by the man from earlier, the one Sherlock had distracted, lying unconscious on the floor. After a few moments of indecision, his morals got the better of him and he bent down. He put a finger to his neck, and after finding a pulse, decided that a kidnapper was worth no more of his time and stood up. He ran down the corridor and into the garden. When he caught sight of someone running across the field behind the houses, he sprinted out of the gate but was too late to catch up with them before they disappeared into a small wood off to the right. All he could tell about them was that the fleeing person was male, young and blond.
“Sherlock,” he said, but Sherlock was in a world of his own and didn’t acknowledge him. John put a hand on his wrist and squeezed, and then Sherlock broke out of his mind palace and looked down at him. “Are you - ?”
Raz folded his arms. “Is this a fucking joke? Holmes?”
John didn’t get a chance to look at the leaflet until halfway through biology, during which he was supposed to be recording the heart rate of a flea. Luckily, Sarah was his lab partner, and she took over his duties.
“How lovely to speak to you too,” drawled the voice on the other end.
Across the field, a slim figure was walking towards him. John recognised it instantly.
“Have you never been to a swimming gala before?” Mike asked.
Sherlock shot him a look. When he saw that John wasn’t trying to make fun of him, he sighed. “When you’re down there, you can’t think of anything else. It’s all so condensed and insistent. There’s no order. It’s a wonder we haven’t gone extinct yet, really. But seeing things from higher up is…”
“Let’s go!” Lestrade shouted, and someone opened the door and the house began to stream out.
The pumpkin had a sneer and semi-circular eyes that weren’t all that friendly-looking. It had just-recognisable ears, the lobes and helices ‘pierced’ with glowing pin-heads, as was the triangular nose. The stem also glowed softly, and although it wasn’t necessarily immediately identifiable as a punk pumpkin, it would surely be evident once it had been explained, john reasoned to himself.
Sherlock focused his hearing. It helped that John’s house was small and the walls were rice-paper thin. The slight suction of the fridge being opened, then closed with a little too much force. Shuffling. Something small and metallic falling to the floor. The gulping of liquid leaving a bottle. Glass on plastic. Footsteps.
Sherlock lay on his back, plucking at his violin. John lay on his own bed opposite him, putting the final touches to his apology email to Dr Hope.
Before his mum dozed off and Frodo left the Shire, John reluctantly broached the subject of unemployment.
“And what’s that like?”
“You really needn’t have bought that second one,” Sherlock said, indicating the second bacon sandwich John had set down on the table as they sat. “I’m not hungry.”
Ollie rolled his eyes and began his tale, which had them in equal parts in stitches and in awe, and John realised that the first full sentence he had ever heard the boy say included an incredibly vivid description of a pair of boobs.
“Why are you asking this now?” John demanded.  “Six months and you haven’t breathed a word about this.  Not a word!  Not a tone, not a look.”
“Deduction.”
“I wouldn’t call you tricking the CIA and hiding crucial evidence from them
John’s room at 221B is exactly as it was, not even a layer of dust.  The refrigerator holds a serving platter of toenails, a jar of ginger preserve, and three carrots.  The microscope on the kitchen table looks to be even larger than the one that sat there before.
Rosie picked up a purple rabbit stuffie and chomped at its arm.
John cut off her slightly patronizing lecture with a smile and a raise of his glass.  “Got it covered, thanks.”  Taking a sip of his pint, John headed off toward the woman in the Alice in Wonderland dress.  She had at least four inches and a fair bit of muscle on him, which might have been a concern if he’d planned to wrestle the watch off her wrist.  But his mum had been enamoured of the fable of the North wind and the sun, and had passed the lesson of charm over force down to him at an early age.
“Yes,” Sherlock confirmed; he had been talking about— “And so with that matter set aside, we went on, as we’d been in the beginning:  the detective and his blogger, no longer flatmates but still friends.
How it happened is this:
Why would he do such a thing?
John hadn’t expected it of him.
“As for the rest of who she was, what she did…  I think I need to leave her in the past.  She’s someone who used to be my wife, not my wife who used to, um, be.  Which is what I’ve been thinking of her as.”  He held up his left hand in front of Rosie.  “See?”
“I had the weirdest dream last night,” John said to Lestrade over Skype during Rosie's afternoon nap.
“Is Sherlock to be the main minder, then?”
He blinked, but before he could even formulate his response, Molly went on, “Sorry, sorry, did that sound cross?  I didn’t mean to sound cross.  Sherlock mentioned you're home all the time, and I only was curious why, being a doctor, because you’re normally an ‘on the front lines’ sort of person…”
“Weird.”  Lestrade shook his head.  “Well, guess I should get back to work.  Thanks for the call, John; it was a good distraction.”

John held up his hands.  “Wait, there’s one more option.  Hear them all before making your choice, remember?”
“Deduction, yes.  Why did you make the deduction that John was a woman?”
“Well, sure.  I said we’d go on as we have been, remember?  I love going on cases with you.”  John twisted his hands so he could give Sherlock’s hands a squeeze.
“I had the weirdest dream last night,” John said to Molly when she picked up the phone.
A cute flush spread across Sherlock’s cheeks.  “Ah.  Yes.  I see.”
It’s two days later, and the bathroom still isn’t clean.

“Ah, you do recall,” the man replied from his spot across the lab.  “I was becoming dismayed that my initial take on you as a resourceful and moderately intelligent woman was incorrect.”
Sherlock sighed.  “You’ve misinterpreted my intent, which was to confirm that it is indeed I to whom you would entrust your daughter’s care.  A drug addict with appalling social skills and a dangerous profession.”
Sinking into the lone chair in the room, a high-backed ornately carved wooden thing, Sherlock shook his head.  “
“Oh.  Thanks.  Hold on.”  He lifted the sheet and could just about see his pants, so he crawled down to retrieve them.  Crawling back, he amused himself by nudging Sherlock from under the sheet like a cat.  When he finally had his pants on and had emerged from the covers, he was ready for whatever Sherlock wanted to talk about.  Although he hoped it wasn’t anything gruesome enough to put him off breakfast.  “Ready.”
“You’ve been dared to kiss someone in the bar by someone close to you, and given that I find myself in need of some discreet assistance, I’ll agree to satisfy your bet in exchange.”
“It was obvious.”
“All you need is the time?  I could tell you that.”
Typing away on John’s phone, the man continued, “I’ll have to get my croft on it.”
Sherlock probably would, but anyway, the case.  Remember how Sherlock’s written up the hundreds of types of ash?  He used that analysis on this case.
John opened his eyes and turned his head, and there was Sherlock. Looking so much younger in sleep (YES THAT’S A CLICHE but he

have been a little bit louder than typical when he reminded Sherlock that Sherlock has never, not even once, in all of their acquaintance, given John his half of the rent without prompting and really it’s a wonder Mrs. H hasn’t dumped them out on their arses with how often she’s paid late, but that doesn’t seem to be enough of a reason for Sherlock to have put his nose in the fucking air and stalked out the door without even so much as a by your leave and been absent from the flat now for five fucking hours.

on schedule, well fed, and happy.  You’re already co-parenting with me; this would just provide some legal protection for the relationship.  But you don’t have to if you don’t want to.  I promise I won’t think any less of you.”
“Fuck no,” John spat.  “You think I’m letting you go then?  No.”
Canon divergence:  John was already married to Mary when Sherlock came back.
“Come and be where you belong.”

“So, I thought it might be helpful for you if I came up with some options for what we do now.   They’re in order by amount of change.  Before I tell them to you, you should know that all of these options are fine with me.  Ones I do not find acceptable, such as you dying again, aren’t in this.  These are all pre-approved by me, so it will be totally up to you which one we go with.  OK?”
, but I have ample evidence that you will put your hands on me in other circumstances.”
“Ah.”  John held up his cane.  “I was in Afghanistan, myself, but ours weren’t anywhere near the W10.  Could I possibly take a closer look?”
Sherlock groaned, pulled away completely, and flopped into his chair.
“That’s right,” Sherlock replied to her.  “I never say please.”  His voice became muffled.  “I never do, do I?”
2 - So easy a monkey who has not been subject to brain trauma could solve it.  I generally save these in case John ever expresses an interest in solving a case on his own.
Sherlock’s arms encircled John too, tentatively, finally finding their place on John’s upper and lower back.
Given the quantity of fruit in the kitchen of 221B, Sherlock is apparently planning to eat his share all in one week.
This was so strange.  John hadn’t been taken as female since he was a little kid and Harry had told their new neighbours his name was Joan.  “I was just being me,” he told Mike.
uni, nor secondary, nor Afghanistan, nor the army bits that weren’t in Afghanistan, and absolutely not when he first came back from Afghanistan.
“The difference,” John said with a sigh of relief as he lowered his body onto Sherlock’s, “is that discipline includes both positive and negative consequences.”  He kissed Sherlock thoroughly.  “Clear?”
“Mikey!” cooed Rosie.
John pointed to himself.
“Ah.”  Sherlock sat back in a graceful move.  “I’m gay, by the way, and in case it was running through your head
“First time?” she asked.
“How is Rosie?”
“Go on,” she ‘whispered’ across the bar-height table they were standing around (drinking always did weird things to her volume control).  “Find a bird to snog!”  Gemma and the other girls giggled, and Harry joined in, and at least somebody was having fun at this thing.
“After the lockdown, of course.”
Seeming strangely surprised at the offer, the man replied, “Oh. Thank you,” and walked toward John.
“What?” Gobsmacked might be a good word for what John currently felt.  He looked Mike’s way, but his friend seemed just as confused.
This is how the discovery came about:
“No, it isn’t fine!” Sherlock protested.  “We should be partners in addition to boyfriends.”
Sherlock finished, “Love me?”
Sherlock’s chin tilted up a fraction.  “Ah, that explains it.  I’m not familiar with music of the twentieth century.”
“No, I didn’t.  I definitely didn’t.  And don’t try to pretend you deduced it from me somehow.”

The woman, Molly, replied, “It wasn’t working for me.”
“No,” John interrupted, shaking his head.  “In my dream, you’d only ever had one husband, and it was Dillon.  The last one.  The one who truly cared about Joe, who stuck by him even with the loss of their livelihood, who missed him when he had to go away.”
Not a problem.  John might even have been whistling as he picked up a call from Greg, expecting some question related to the paperwork for the case.
You think it’d be old hat after a while, but no, his brain always amazes.
“Shut up,” John ordered fondly.  “I mean, with men.  One drunken snog and a few mutual handjobs don’t add up to much of anything, do they?”
It transpired that Sherlock had decided to address the problem of his procrastination and general apathy toward household and personal finance by giving it to John.
“Oh, yeah, all the time.  It was a mesh of tiger park and London.  Moriarty was Carole Baskin, or she was him, whichever way you want to say it.”
“Oh,” Nixi interjected, as she sat down on his bed.
“Sorry, we’re a bit busy here.  I didn’t look to see who it was.”
“A few more.  Option four.  We go on as we have been, you adopt Rosie, and we don’t have to renovate the flat because you and I share a bedroom, due to us being in a romantic relationship.”
Those bananas from the other day?  Sherlock didn’t get them, as you might logically assume, to take care of a severe potassium deficiency.  No.  He got them because he thought John wanted chocolate cake.  Metaphorically.
It’s this.
“Ooh, lovely.  How?”
“Yes, yes, that’s enough pleasantries.”
That man.
“Sherlock as Joe Exotic?  I can see it, except the politics thing.”
It’s just, you see, that the rent is due today and once again Sherlock has managed to piss off without giving John his half, and John can’t cover it by himself -- Mrs. H is giving them a marvelous discount, but it is central London after all.
“No, none of those. I want to have sex with you.”

“Ah, yes.  I will clarify, so that you know, that I am in fact a man.”
“So it’s going well,” Molly said, mid-way between a statement and a question, “living with Sherlock again.”
Dr. John H. Watson climbed the stairs to his flat after a very long, very boring day, looking forward to sitting in his armchair and cracking open the spy novel he’d recently purchased.  Upon opening the door to his flat, he realized he would not be doing any such thing any time soon, as his lounge was inhabited by approximately one hundred and twenty-seven youths of indeterminate gender peeling bananas.
“Tiger King.  And you were the king, as you obviously know.”
A man who looked every bit as sleek and modern as the lab called out to them.  “Mike, can I borrow your phone?  There’s no signal on mine.”
“I have absolutely no idea I’m afraid,” John said, and smiled back just as wide.
“It’s alright.  I understand.  Are you okay though?”
Not a day later, he’s off to investigate a murder.  With Sherlock.  Who is indeed too tall and too full of himself—rightfully so.  Least, John thinks so.  In the cab, he lays John’s life bare.  Wounded in action, therapist, psycho-sematic limp, Harry’s drinking.  Sherlock sees right through him, it’s as though he’s transparent, and it is…
“No. I only arrived in London three hours ago. I went to see my brother. To get myself back in order. Then…here I am.” John nods, and Sherlock continues. “He was very angry with me when he realized I’d been in contact with you. Actually don’t know that he’s ever been so angry with me. Anyway…no, Mrs. Hudson doesn’t know.”
John scoots over just a fraction to his left and holds up his bed sheets for Sherlock to crawl inside.
“Don’t worry, it will,” John said, laughing as well.
“Why not?” John demands.  He is blinking back tears—he refuses to cry.  Absolutely refuses.
“Yes he is. Works with Lestrade. John Watson, this is my brother Mycroft.”
“She’s my landlady,” Sherlock replies.
“John?” It’s a timid sound.
“But you did go to prison,” Sherlock clarified.
Sherlock wonders what he’s writing but doesn’t dare to even attempt a small glance down.  It would be wrong.  It doesn’t matter anyway.  John’s said enough.
Sherlock thinks to himself.  He looks around him, at the dinner that they ordered out and the bottle of wine at the center of the table that John had picked up out of the cupboard, where it had been sitting for years.  A bottle of red that, if Sherlock recalls correctly was purchased the day Irene Adler had showed up in his bed.  He wonders why John had pulled it out after all this time.
In the end, John doesn’t have many things to bring back to Baker Street.  He had a few boxes but it all feels too simple.  Sherlock helps him carry his boxes to the upstairs bedroom.  His chest feels tight the entire time, as if he is waiting for the punch line to the joke he is the butt of.
“Yeah, I did.”
"But you told me," Sherlock says.
“Do you need anything right now?”
Sherlock rests his forehead on John’s shoulder, the bad one. John takes Sherlock’s face in his hands and swallows hard as he looks at him. John gulps for air and then feels his eyes sting.
“What have you done to me?” John asked, eyebrows furrowing together, his lips tightening.  Sherlock grew angry, pushing himself up from against the table.
“Fine, I’ll do it, but I’ll only love you more,” John says to no one in particular.  He rolls over, cradles the pillow Harry gave me.  Falls asleep once more.
He can hear his voice breaking now.  It has hurt to carry this much.  To unload it is too much of a relief, but he can’t have the relief if he isn’t believed.
“But you held my hand,” Sherlock says.  John can barely keep his eyes open, and neither can Sherlock it seems.  John smiles, shakes his head.
“Something serious?” Mary confirms.
John can think of many reasons.
(See the end of the chapter for
When John reached the front, he stopped in his tracks. Standing before him was Sherlock, wearing a purple button up and looking radiant. John thought his heart was going to stop.
“What do you mean?”
But the years of being bullied about it.  The years he spent knowing he was gay during the early nineties, when the AIDS epidemic was taking place.  It was hard not to think terrible thoughts about his own desires.  John could just as easily turn on him.
“I don’t. It was awful. If something would have happened to you. No.” Sherlock takes a long drag.
“Why are you here?”
“It was for you,” Sherlock says, flipping the bow in his hand, and then putting the violin down.
The next morning they are at the table again.  Sherlock doesn’t feel as shy about watching John this time.  He watches with purpose as John parses together his thoughts and puts them on a page, maybe to investigate later, maybe just to have.  To know that this moment took place.
“Of course. Well. In that case. I’ll show you out. But also, you’re extraordinary.” John felt his face go hot, and he shook his head, laughing at himself a little. “Sorry, it’s just that I figure this is my one chance to say it and you should hear it.”
“Fine, yeah.  Bit weird sleeping in that bed, but I did miss it.  I always liked that mattress,” John says.
But he says nothing.
It was in this moment that John lost control. He pulled the man out of his chair and punched him square in the jaw. Drunk or not, John wouldn’t stand for it. Sherlock laughed a little off to John’s right, and then the other two men were on both of them. John quickly hit the pressure points of one of them, rendering him useless, and Sherlock ducked, and then hit the other in the stomach. There were gasps and screams throughout the restaurant, and Sherlock and John were quickly thrown out with the men.
John hears Sherlock coming up the stairs before he sees him.  Sherlock takes off and hangs up his coat in a painfully slow manner.
They make their way down the tracks until they get to the train.  They go inside and it should be horrifying, but it’s thrilling: the fact that the entire thing is a bomb. Sherlock actually looks worried though.  When John finds that Sherlock cannot turn the bomb off, it gets a little muddled.
“That’s just the trouble. It’s only open to the people who live there.”
John can’t help himself when his throat constricts and he lets out a small sob.
The same night that he went to university his boy in the next room ,  Evan invited him to a party. He was eighteen years old and after the goodbye he’d said today, John Watson imagined he could have a drink, or several. John had four beers and didn’t usually drink much and suddenly he was with Evan, walking back to their halls, holding his hand. He didn’t know why. He just was. It didn’t feel like a betrayal. They had gone running around, they had broken into a dormitory that wasn’t their own, and John had been laughing so hard, and it was four a.m.
“John?” Sherlock asks.  He wonders if he should be worried.
Ellis punched him.  It hurt.  John supposed a lot of things would hurt in the coming months.  John punched him back.  They ended up kissing more than anything else and John finally let his fists fall down, and the cold feeling in his gut continued to get larger.
“Oh, for God’s sake,” he says.  She turns around and eyes him.
John thinks back to the tiny diner and to falling asleep on library desks and having to sneak out of a dorm room that wasn't his early nearly every morning, to make sure no one would know.
“John, I’m so sorry,” Sherlock says softly.  Sherlock returns to his chair, watching John carefully.  “She left that for me.  She told me to give it to you.”
“I know,” John said, and kissed him.
“And why not?” Sherlock demands, his eyes going wide.
He grabs a cab to St. Bart’s and gets there a half an hour early. He looks up at the roof and swallows hard. His hands clench at his sides. He shakes away the memory. His stomach hurts from the anxiety, and he shouldn’t feel like this. It’s just Sherlock.
“Because he gave it to me himself.”
“John, I stole the ashtray for you.”
“It was so nice to see you. Can’t believe it’s you in fact,” Sherlock said, and John laughed as he let go of Sherlock’s hand, wanting nothing more than to stay just a little longer.
“Ellis, right.”
“Mary, will you marry me?”  John opens the box.  “I suppose we got a bit interrupted last time.”
John tries to begin.  He messes up just a little.  Throwing words around.  He’s never been good at this, but Mary knows exactly what is happening and is giggling the entire time.
Sherlock crosses the room tentatively on bare feet, and climbs into bed with John.
John knows that he’s rambling.  He’s drunk.
When John wakes, his right arm is numb.  This is worse than PTSD.
“Life has never been fair, but, I do think this has been the cruelest trick the universe has played on me thus far.”  John finishes his cigarette, puts it out, is no longer sure what to do with his hands so he reaches for his wine glass.  “See, you, Harry,” John continues, “you just cocked it up.  I do wish that you would just fix it because you can and you love her, so, I think…I think you should fix it.  Since it is in the realm of possibility.  And the funniest thing is, I did try a few times.  I mean I really tried to see if he could want me.  But the timing was always so off and I didn’t want to throw all of it away so it just…became…stagnant.  I used to think I was content just watching him breathe.  When he slept, he was beautiful.  I’m sorry, I don’t know what I’m saying,” John says.
“I really did think you were going to die,” Sherlock says.
Hearing Sherlock say his name had been enough.  Sherlock asking him to come to him.  It was so ridiculous really, John knew how stupid it was, yet he couldn’t help it.
“Of course.”
Letters from his lesbian sister about her beautiful wife; funny.
His stance is all strict army doctor, one hand pointing loosely to Sherlock, a hard line in between his eyebrows.  Sherlock can’t help but laugh.  John looks handsome.
Then the phone call.
Sherlock retreats down the stairs.
“I’m very sorry about last time.”
Sherlock’s eyebrows pulled together, and he stammered, trying to find words.
__________
“Morning Mrs. H,” he said as she patted him on the shoulder.
“Oh, God, please don’t. I’d be fairly embarrassed.”
It started this way, the screaming.  It only gets louder.
Three days later he got the call.
John finished his scotch and tucked his hand under his chin.
He does feel like he’s dying, but not like the last time.
John ran a hand down his face, wishing he had the power to remedy the situation, even in some small way. Sherlock ran back up to the bedroom, cursing under his breath.
“Why?” Sherlock asks, still not looking at him.
“John,” Sherlock whispers, and it sounds so terrified.  Sherlock should never sound like that.
“You have to be here. Otherwise they’d know he was alive. Don’t be thick John.”
“Just wondering how you’re doing.” He actually doesn’t look smug for once.
It continues on a blue rug in Mexico.
Sherlock watches him intensely.  His mouth open just slightly, eyes wide.  He looks angry, hurt.  “Believing that I am what?”
“Yes,” Sherlock replies, and realizes he’s smiling into his pasta.  This is preposterous, he’s acting like a teenager.   He finds he doesn’t even mind.
“Why would he do that?”
“It’s not fine.  It’s not fine at all.”
Sherlock rolls his eyes and takes a drag.
always thought it was the booze.
“But what would you say if--” John began, but he was cut off by the mediator.
“The last time I had one of these I was with my sister,” John says.
“You’re right there, I am a catch,” Mary replies, and now they’re both laughing.
“Sadly, no.”  Sherlock nods and sips his drink.  “I thought I was fairly obvious, but alas.”
It’s a decision between the intimacy between oneself and the cab driver, or of the strained chaos of taking the tubes on a weekday morning.  He chooses the latter, feeling anxious just thinking about a driver trying to make small talk with him.
“My flat isn’t far, if you wanted to stop in,” he ended with, and felt like kicking himself immediately.
“Sherlock I obviously don’t care.  I love how mad you are.”
“So get out.”
John’s head leans against the back of the chair.  He stares at the ceiling, like he has stared at so many other blank walls for a completely different reason.
“There’s nothing on it,” John says.  He turns to Sherlock, who only stares back, nothing to offer.
__________
“Oh.”
“I had you first,” John replied.
John kisses the side of Sherlock’s mouth.
“Did I really give you any sign that I was going to run away if you kissed me?”
John doesn’t expect this but goes to the mantel.
“Why would I need you?” Sherlock grumbles from his pillows.
After Sherlock was washed and dressed, John made them tea and breakfast. He opened the kitchen window to let the breeze in and Sherlock picked at his eggs and toast. After a while Sherlock folded his hands on the table and looked John in the eye.
“Yes,”
“I’m John.”
John goes anyway, and is glad he does because although he can sense his Commander’s embarrassment, he also knows he needs a friend.
He tried to focus back on the article he had been reading, but he was distracted. By what, he didn’t know. He felt restless.
“Think, John. A necklace that was stolen and never found. Months and months ago.”
“What do you mean?” came Sherlock’s voice from below. “You spoke to him about Carl?”
“The other car had mainly hit the passenger side of ours, and I couldn’t feel any pain at all at that point – epinephrine and all that – so I tried to get dad out of his seat but it took me a while to realise that I was still strapped in. So I undid my seat belt and it was a little difficult to get my legs out of the foot space because it was crushed up, but not enough to hurt me more than a great gash down my leg. I unclipped dad and got him under the arms and tried to lift him out, but he just kept screaming and that was my - ” John's voice wavered " - my
“I know. That’s not why I asked, either.” Sherlock said. He sighed and turned to John. “Viola is trying to play matchmaker.”
“Uh,” Sherlock replied.
“You know he’s a psychopath, right?”
“But miss, I don’t have a key and all my family are out,” he lied. “Don’t worry, though, miss. I’m sure the other kids will be okay, just for a day. I mean, they’ve had to look at your bare face all these years, so they won’t even notice me.”
Sherlock hadn’t been there.
John stopped scrubbing and looked at his friend, who was tapping his fingers against his thigh. “Are you nervous about something?”
“What the hell are you on about?”
John stood in the middle of the room, then sat, then collapsed on the floor.
“Get in,” he said, and John’s stomach flipped. After that display of effortless ability, he knew he was going to look childish and risible in the water. But he knew he couldn’t stand on the side in his floral swimming shorts forever (and even they looked stupid compared with Sherlock’s tight racing shorts). So he sat on the side at the shallow end and slid in, thankful that he was tall enough at least to be able to stand in the water.
It was true – earlier that day, whilst looking for a book he thought he’d dropped down the back of his wardrobe, he’d seen the first of them: a tiny dot of a thing, stuck to the wall behind his wardrobe. The other had been behind their radiator, and he suspected there were more, but he wasn’t too bothered to search for them. Mycroft was probably paying one of the thicker year nines to spy on him anyway, and he had his suspicions about Lestrade as well, so hearing him and John talk about the weather or what lesson they had next or the dates of their exams would be nothing revolutionary.
“Copper.”
And yet he had called him friend.
“Will you stop spying on me, Mycroft? It’s highly irritating."
“I said, are you hungry?”
“You still haven’t told me why we’re here,” Sherlock pointed out as they made their way over to an escalator.
“Shh,” Sherlock said, quickly changing the subject. “Shall we go and see Muhammad?”
The singular soft clap had come from where John was sitting, but Sherlock forced himself to be critical – he could have got it wrong, could have misjudged, they could have switched places – but no. The voice that followed, joking as if it was a common thing, kissing boys, was John’s.
“John, I swear to god – ”
John regarded Mike for a moment. “You know the funny thing,” he said, “we’re not actually together.”
“What? He is,” Sally was saying defensively. “He’s a psychopath and a freak.”
“I’m in this boarding house called Doyle – all the houses are named after authors. Our guy wrote some books that I’ve never heard of about some bloke called Professor Challenger. Anyway, the guys in my house are pretty nice, and the rest of my year seem to be decent enough - I haven’t had much chance to get to know them, which is perhaps for the best.”
“For being a fucking idiot!” John exclaimed.
He blinked into the morning light. The house was silent.
“Sherlock – ”
Sherlock didn’t laugh.
John had to close his eyes and count to ten before responding. “I have not been in school since midday, Sherlock.”
“Not just yet, Mr Holmes.” said John. “Not ‘til the game ends, not til there’s a - a winner.”
His friend was sitting on the floor a couple of feet away from him, sketchpad in his lap. He seemed to be concentrating, hands slightly raised over the paper as if working out proportions and spacing in his head. He made a small sound and got up, flicking the main lights off and fiddling with something on his own desk that Sherlock couldn’t quite see from his angle.
John was a little alarmed to see that they were approaching the back of a nondescript street of semi-detached houses.
John couldn’t tell if God Staunton’s room looked as if it had been left in a rush or if it was simply untidy. The wardrobe was ajar, the chair untucked, the window open, the bed unmade. But the most alarming thing about the room was the yellow circle spray-painted on the window from the outside.
Ninety-six hours later and the case had ground to a halt. John had been counting.
“All right, listen,” John said, sensing things were getting a little off-piste. “Why don’t we wait until we start rehearsing as a house to make these kinds of decisions, yeah?”
Exhale: intercostal muscles move thoracic cavity down and in. Diaphragm relaxes. Pressure increases.
“John, oh my God. Are you okay?”
Sherlock nodded and moved past him into the small room. John leant against the door frame.
He took a breath.
“House fire. Asphyxiation. It’s the smoke that gets you,” Molly whispered.
There was some room towards the end of the table, and Sherlock and John sat opposite each other.
A clock ticked somewhere. Mike fiddled with his phone. John looked at him out of the corner of his eye.
Mike took the thin-framed glasses off his face and fiddled with them. “Yeah, I spent more time at the opticians over the half term than I’d expected… how was yours?”
And he was, John thought, with Eurasian features that seemed perfectly proportioned in clear skin – but Eric laughed.
John cocked his head. “What?”
“Jingles isn’t the only dead animal today,” John sighed, standing up.
“Who was who?” John asked.
John nodded again. “That’s…” He didn’t know what to say. He wished he could hug him and press the feeling he wanted to express into his skin, but he knew that doing so would risk expressing too much and making Sherlock uncomfortable. So he simply said, “Try and get some sleep tonight.”
“Thank you very much for having me, Jo.”
“Yeah,”
“What do you think?”
“You should have seen him, John. He was lying there on the roof as if he’d been shot. He looked like it too, minus a wound, like all the blood had been drained from his body. He was barefoot and was only wearing his school trousers and shirt. I yelled his name, but he didn’t react. That was the first time in my life that I had ever felt panic. True panic. My mind went into overdrive and shutdown all at once but my body somehow knew what to do. I put my fingers to his neck and I think I started crying when I felt a pulse. It was so faint, and so sporadic, but it was there. I think I must have called Molly and told her to get Lestrade and phone an ambulance. I don’t remember what happened after that.”
Remember kids, hugs not drugs, especially while you’re at school.
The companionable silence returned. John heard applause erupt from the direction of Lestrade’s garden. John watched Sherlock, watched the sunshine brush his hair golden at the tips. John found himself longing to remain in this easy calm forever, but knew it was time to say what he had come to find Sherlock to say.
Sherlock pulled his feet from the water and stood, padding wetly over to where he had left his clothes in a heap. He took off his swimming trunks and wrapped himself in his towel, drying off a little before putting on his pyjamas and a hoody over the top. He left his feet bare – it wasn’t too cold yet; the autumn was just settling into its skin. He rolled his trunks up inside the towel and took his exit via a window that had been thoughtfully left ajar, which led onto the roof. It had been left open by Victor Trevor, who had the last shift of the evening at the pool, and was, as they say, wrapped around Sherlock’s little finger, despite how much he liked to claim otherwise.
Sherlock sighed as if John had said something so painfully obvious it barely warranted a reply. "I know that. I've already told Lestrade about their situation, he's told the pupil welfare people, the police know, Mr Turner intends to leave his wife and take Lottie with him. I'm not stupid, John. I see things through."
“You’ve got a fairly superficial bruise on your cheek, several minor scratches, grazes and scrapes, a bleeding head - nothing too serious - a pretty deep cut by your left eye that you’re probably going to need stitches for, and I am a bit worried about the colour of where you evidently got kicked in the stomach. Jesus, Sherlock. Go to the san.”
“You and I both know that is a fucking lie.”
“What do you want this particular book for anyway?” John asked as he handed Sherlock the book for the sake of which he had nearly got locked in the library overnight. “You don’t take art.”
Mike replied with a few names, but the list was worryingly short. John cursed and sighed. “I’d better get to it, then, hadn’t I?”
“One each,” Victor replied. He laughed at Sherlock’s expression. “Oh, come on, I haven’t been high with you in ages, it’ll be fun.”
“What,
“Now, Sherlock.”
John had been staring into space. He was sitting atop his bed with unbalanced chemical equations balanced on his knee. Sherlock threw down his (stolen) safety goggles, making John jump.
“Look, John,” Sally said, her voice less accusative now. “All I’m saying is, one day, solving murders won’t be enough for him. One day, we’ll be hearing about some horrible killing on the news, and that boy will be the one responsible. So just be careful, yeah? Because psychopaths get bored.”
, it screamed at him. He ignored that and sent John a text. He paused for thought, checked his watch, then sent another two in quick succession. He wasn’t quite sure why – that age-old illusion named ‘politeness’ probably had something to do with it.
“Do I need to be here?” Sherlock interjected. John sighed.
John could feel a small smile growing as he looked at the sleeping form before him. With Sherlock there was no stopping distance; when he applied the brakes, he applied them hard, and everything simply ceased. The world went quiet. Still. Eerily silent, like the eye of a storm.
“John? John!”
“Sherlock, about earlier. I - ”
As he jogged down the pitch, his eyes drifted to the spectators gathered on the sidelines, wrapped in coats and scarves and gloves against the weather that was fast becoming winter.  He thought he caught sight of a particular coat and scarf and pair of gloves, but on a second glance, the collar was flush against the shoulders, the scarf was a tad too vivid, the gloves were fleece.
“Harry.”
“We need to talk. I’m tired of being petty about this.”
Sherlock complied, and was suddenly quite aware of his probably-too-long toenails, and the dry skin on his soles, and the sporadic strands of hair dotted about, while John positioned him so he ended up sitting atop the fridge with one foot on the windowsill to catch the last few rays of sun. John pulled a chair next to the fridge, laying his notepad on the machine, and started sketching.
But he could never say it.
,” he sang, slowing down. “
“Morning, sir,” John said. “Uh, Sherlock’s a bit ill, and he’s out cold, so I was wondering if it’d be okay if he missed lessons today.”
Mycroft turned to him slowly, as if turning out of a day dream.
Breaths, slow and even, next to him. The quiet twitters of birds outside, the muffled hum of chatter downstairs.
“Shut up.”
John began to say that he didn’t mind, but Sherlock interrupted him.
“Mum, can I have a sip of yours?” John whispered.
“You’d better be right,” John said, wandering back over to his desk.
John made a thinking sound and rubbed his neck, head cocked to once side. “I’m not sure. I was doing, uh, your neck, but I don’t like the way it’s turning out…”
“So, have you found my blazer yet?” John asked, teasing.
“And then I had to phone my mum and tell her that her childhood sweetheart was… pleading to god to let him live. She and my grandparents and my dad’s two brothers drove down and then everything was lit up blue and red and I’d always wanted to see what the inside of an ambulance looked like but all I can remember was trying to tie up my shoelaces and the paramedic telling me off.
“Were you two the only ones in here when it happened?” John said, softening his tone a little.
– and what if Sherlock could read it in his appeasing face? Because he would be able to, and even imagining that feeling made Sherlock’s chest tight.
“I was the one who broke up their marriage. He was having an affair. It was obvious. With the cleaner. He tried to cover it up, and had been quite successful in doing so for quite some time, but I knew. Obviously. When I realised the gravity of the situation, I told my brother, who took the matter into his own hands. I was glad to see him go. I was six.”
John had said he looked healthier, and he supposed that was true. Less gaunt. Fuller. He’d never thought much about how his appearance could portray his health.  He’d only thought about how it could be used to manipulate, to intimidate. He’d learnt early on that his height could be accentuated with well-fitting suits, long coats, long lines. That cheekbones like his were sought after, that his pale eyes combined with his dark hair had an intrigue to them. And he’d used this information to draw people in, to woo them into telling him what he’d needed to know. Or to impose, to let his frame threaten, his eyes unnerve.
John closed his eyes briefly, felt the sting of tears in their corners.
They stayed like that for a few moments more, more and more people turning to gawp at the source of the commotion.
Room twenty one was as he and Sherlock had left it – so tidy it was almost unrecognisable. Sherlock had evidently not arrived yet, so John toed off his shoes, put his jacket over the back of his chair, put some music on and began to unpack.
John huffed. “Right, fine, whatever,” he grumbled, stepping onto the grass and making his way over to his coach, trying to think up some excuse.
“Yes, well,” Sherlock replied. “As much fun as this has been, we’re late for biology.”
“What?” Sherlock asked. When he got no reply, he sighed and went back to packing, somewhat more purposefully than before.
“It obviously does for old Three Counties Watson over here,” Eric laughed.
John laughed and clapped his friend on his back.
The unwanted endorphins vanished from his bloodstream as he heard the footsteps of… Mike in the corridor outside, approaching their room. Sherlock dropped to his knees and pushed the stolen art supplies that had been abandoned on the floor around John’s legs and under John’s desk, ignoring John’s confused protests. He had just removed his hands from John’s ankles - using which he had maneuvered John backwards to better block the desk from the line of sight of anyone standing in the doorway - as Mike entered the room, carrying a torch.
She stood in front of him as if expecting something more.
“And as a friend, as
“No, shut up, Fitz – ” there was a rustling that indicated that Dean leant closer to Fitz. He lowered his voice and whispered, barely audible, “I think someone’s out there.”
, John thought drily, but decided to keep that sentiment to himself.
“It’s nicer, and yes,” John answered over his shoulder before opening the door.
Saw a hand to his right. And before he could stop himself, he glanced to his left.
“The reflex arc.” Sherlock replied.
“Can I have a go with the heart now?” John asked, pretending he hadn’t heard.
Victor drew his brows together. “Really? You’re actually going to pay me,” Sherlock glared at him. “You’re different these days. I’m not sure I like it.”
Exhaustion hit John when he got into bed, mercifully switching off the loop of the day’s events that had been replaying in his mind all evening. The only detail of the day’s events that he couldn’t seem to stop thinking about was Angelo’s face as God had announced loudly and obtusely that he did not match Angelo’s investment in whatever was between them. John felt his heart breaking for Angelo, just a little. If Angelo just stopped denying it, if he had just talked about it with God, perhaps the afternoon would have played out differently. If he made peace with what it meant about him, perhaps he wouldn’t have spent so much of the day lashing out like a wounded animal.
“Shut up. Idiot. Put it on loudspeaker for a sec?”
“Bit of an anticlimax, no?” Sherlock looked at him out of the corner of his eye. “What? That’s what you’re thinking, isn’t it? You wanted some big, dramatic showdown, I know what you’re like.”
“No. It doesn’t look like this at all, but it has the same sense of detachment and overall…” He hissed in frustration. ”It’s difficult to articulate.”
Sherlock poked at his pasta suspiciously when they sat down. John watched him.
The taller boy made straight for Mrs Hudson’s kitchen, but John began taking off his shoes and coat.
“The marks are there on all of the animals,” he was saying. “Small punctures just at the base of the neck. The injection was done clumsily enough to leave a mark - who-ever it was was certainly inexperienced. The dried blood around the marks means they were made before their deaths.”
The song that Sherlock plays at the end can be found
“I swear everyone hates her?” he yelled to Mike.
Sherlock wouldn’t let John clear up the mess he’d made on his own, so they worked together to strip Sherlock’s bed in silence. The bright morning light cast everything in harsh clarity: if Sherlock hadn’t been curled on his side, if John hadn’t been there or was a deeper sleeper or if Sherlock had eaten more at dinner the previous night -
John spluttered a laugh. “So you’re not missing?”
John thought for a moment.
“Ah, Watson, Holmes. So nice of you to join us,” Dr Hope said, from the front of the classroom. “I hope whatever kept you was worthwhile.”
“Yes. We have the
“No, it’s – it’s fine,” Sherlock stammered. “You were just standing on my foot.”
Sherlock wondered if John was aware of his own progress. He hoped he was. He hoped he was proud.
Just then, the door opened and Ollie entered, looking surprised at John being in his room.
“The way I see it,” Sally said as they walked back into the kitchen, Anderson carrying the Guinea pig in a plastic bag. “There are two ways of dying: naturally or murder. I think we can rule out all three of the family pets dying naturally within minutes of each other, so that leaves murder. And there are more two types of murder: intentional and unintentional. Now, it could be that the pets’ food supplies got contaminated with something without the family noticing, but that’s the only way I can see that they could have been unintentionally murdered.”
On that topic, I am in the middle of going through the rest of the fic and to add detailed content warnings (like the one at the top of this chapter) for sensitive subjects at the beginning of any chapters that contain them, such as underage drinking, drug use, attempted child sexual abuse, parental death, etc. I’d like to apologise for not having done so sooner. I wrote most of those chapters when I was a teenager myself and therefore thought of a lot of those things as normal/quotidian/harmless, but now I am older and wiser, I realise they can be things people may rather be warned that they are going to encounter. I hope those warnings help you and future readers to have an experience reading this fic that you are in control of, being able to skip parts that may be upsetting/unpleasant/just not something you want to read. You can see a catalogue of all the chapters that have content warnings at
Some minutes later, John had been relegated to holding the organ in place with a pair of tongs in one hand and a splint in the other, while Sherlock snipped away at some tissue.
The sound of their feet on the old staircase, the wood creaking beneath them. The mess of Sherlock’s hair in front of him.
It seemed that even Clara had met Dave before John had, and the two had an easy manner with each other that had John smiling. Dave complimented him on his cooking, and John replied something about his skills making him popular in a boarding house, which sparked a change in conversation which mainly involved John, so when he felt his phone vibrate, he didn’t reply instantly. Instead, he waited for a lull in the conversation, when both couples were talking to their partners.
They fell into step, something John had once thought impossible due to the fact that Sherlock’s legs were at least double the length of his.
They appeared to be leaving the village, the houses becoming more and more sparse until they were driving down a single-track lane, lined with bare hedges and the odd tree, but with no trace of human life for as far as John could see – which, granted, wasn’t very far.
There was a pause before Sherlock said, “Right, then. Best get to work.”
but then Sherlock leaned closer, and closer still, until his mouth was what felt like millimetres away from the shell of his ear. A whisper, so quiet that John had to concentrate to understand it, travelled the short distance from mouth to ear, and John’s skin was warmed by soft breath.
“On the coach, John. We have a rendezvous in two minutes, do we not?”
Surprisingly, but actually not very surprisingly at all, Sherlock Holmes strolled languidly across the doorway, making his way down the corridor as if he had no intention of ever returning whence he came. Sherlock’s eyes were focused and dark, and John’s disbelieving ones followed his roommate until he was out of sight.
Sarah curled her legs up as they talked, knees now almost resting on his thigh. Her smile was enchanting, her laughter mesmerising. Her hair framed her face perfectly, and John thought he might kiss her.
The boy standing next to the starting block of lane three was tall and pale, adjusting his goggles on his face. His breathing was shallow, and John watched the muscles of his back move under his skin when he turned to say something to a boy standing behind him.
John continued drawing until he glanced at his watch and realised that he was due at Sarah’s film night in ten minutes.
“Are you sure? Because I’m not.”
“Okay,” John said, trying to work out what to do. “Okay. Stay here, I’ll be back. All right?”
“Do you want to come down to the tuck shop or something?”
“I’m not a completely heartless bastard, you know.”
As the door swung shut behind them, John let go of Sherlock and ran a hand through his hair.
Sherlock turned his head very slightly and fixed the girls with what John knew would be a penetrating glare. The girls stood a little straighter, smiling a little wider. As soon as Sherlock turned away again, they whispered excitedly to one another.
He thought he could understand what Sherlock was silently saying, now, but if he was wrong, if he dared hope but was
His attention was diverted, however, by a year nine boy waddling into the common room, somehow wearing a Doyle house shirt not only on his top half, but also another as his trousers. Another was wrapped around his head to make a sort of veil. And he looked terribly pleased about it.
“I don’t know,” Sherlock said, and John couldn’t read his expression.
John looked up at his mother’s words, apologising and pocketing the device.
“I’ve just got to set them and then I’m done, chill out.”
“Short version: gases in the onion molecules – ” Sherlock began, stopping briefly to wipe at his own eyes, and John laughed at him blinking and scrunching his face up against the tears. “ – react with the water in your eyes to make a weak form of sulphuric acid, which irritates the tear glands,”
Mrs Watson made some excuse about it being an early start tomorrow and needing a good night’s sleep, but it was a blatant lie – the glass of undrunk wine in her hand said so. Perhaps John hadn’t noticed, or he didn’t want to.
“Go to the s-”
Sherlock was laughing at him, eyes crinkled at their corners, and John was laughing back, because his cheeks were bulging outwards like a chipmunk’s, and to see the marble man, the boy genius, the Consulting Detective, with his face stuffed with marshmallows was the most absurd thing John had ever experienced.
“Does he know we’re in here?”
He hadn’t been clean at all. Of course he hadn’t. He never had been. John had just, what, assumed? Hoped? Blindly believed? That Sherlock hadn’t been pushed that far, not far enough to go back there. But, of course he had, and John should have seen. Should have at least considered the possibility. The signs were there.
He’d forgotten the clanging of the rising bell, every morning at seven on the dot. He’d forgotten the monotony of lessons, the queues at meal times, the constant exhaustion.
“You have never, ever cared about detention in your entire life,” John countered. Sherlock fell silent. “So. You have a younger sibling.” Sherlock said nothing. “But I didn’t see any trace of another Holmes at your house.”
“Good, phone her as soon as I hang up. Apologise and arrange to meet her this weekend.”
“What makes you think that?” Sherlock said, holding John’s faze with his own.
John sighed. Not a split second later, Sherlock sent through the details of which bus and which stops to do what at, and John sent a quick affirmative text back. He got the feeling Sherlock was busy doing something or other, so he brought up his music and put his earphones in.
A few moments passed, John cursing as he scrubbed at his face with his sister’s make up remover. Sherlock sat cross-legged on John’s bed, wandering through his head space.
“Yeah, go on,” John supplemented for his friend.
“Never have I ever had sex with my parents in the next room.” Claus.
“What, that you can throw a strangely-shaped ball whilst wearing spiky shoes? Hardly essential for a doctor.”
“Yes.  What do you want to know?”
But of course she hadn’t, she had been a stand in.
The idea of Sherlock having to come get him because he’s gotten too drunk is embarrassing.  John orders another pint and doesn’t reply.
Sherlock is speaking.  John hears her name and his throat closes up.
“You alright?” The man asked.
John touches Sherlock’s knee, leaves his hand there just a moment too long, and Sherlock can’t possibly be misreading this, even with all the scotch.
“John,” Molly starts.  Or at least, she seems about to start, but then perhaps thinks better of it.  She regroups.  “John, I do hope you’re well.  I know leaving Baker Street must have been difficult.”
"I haven't avoided the question at all," Sherlock replies.
Red lips, red lips, red lips. He is only fifteen, but he knows.
“What is it, can I help?”
“I wish you were here.  I wish you were here more than anything but you aren’t so please get out of my head,” John whispers at the walls of Baker Street.
The case does not go well.  Sherlock testifies but is kicked out.  Days later, Moriarty is found not guilty, and John can’t get the image of Moriarty beaming up at him, might as well have winked and all.
“Sleep alright?” Sherlock asks, sipping his tea.  He wishes John had made the tea, it always tastes better when John makes it.
Stamford laughs.
When they had first met, Sherlock had been an ethereal type of beautiful.  He had seemed foreign and strange and completely distracting.
They end up staking out at Angelo’s.  John orders and then licks his lips.
“I love you, John.” He says it louder this time, like he isn’t afraid of the words anymore.
“You don’t have a girlfriend then?”
“What else on Earth could that possibly mean?” Sherlock asks.
“That’s excellent news,” John said, and smiled wide as Sherlock beamed down at John from the table.
“You know what I mean,” Harry whispers.  She’s staring at him across her table.  “I’m your sister.  I grew up with you, and I know that you used to talk to a boy for hours on the phone during breaks from Uni.  I hid enough relationships from Mum and Dad, and you.  I’m not stupid.”  She pulls a pack of cigarettes out of her jeans pocket and offers John one.  He takes it, unsure why.  She pours him more wine.
At five o’clock, John forced himself to eat an egg and a piece of toast.  He eats it quickly, as lingering on it would make him nauseous.  He is already drunk, swallowing scotch with the bread, and he knows this is Not Good but there isn’t much reason to care if it is rather Not Good.
“Phillip, have you seen my wallet?”
“Do ‘people’ like me?”
“She shot you and I was too slow.”  Sherlock fingers the scar on John’s belly, and then brings it back up to John’s face.  “I wouldn’t have survived if you hadn’t.”
“It didn’t seem as though you were going to call me back. Playing it cool I see,” Sherlock said, and panic seized John once again.
Phillip miraculously obeyed the command. He then stood in front of John, placed his hands on his shoulders, and whispered “This is the best thing that’s ever happened.”
“Dad, PLEASE!” Harry had shrieked. She was silenced though it was obvious no one was listening to her.
They wait thirty seconds, nothing comes up.
"That's because you're an idiot."
“Who?” John asks.  He knows who.  He just needs to confirm.  He needs to make it seem as if the answer isn’t
“Yes, it keeps doing that.”
“Of course.  He’s…alive though…” Mary trails off, as if she expects him to say something.
But even so, even if he couldn’t have come, why did Sherlock come back into his life like that?  It was nothing but a joke to him.  It was all a fucking joke.  No tactic at all.
“Stop being stupid,” John says, and he says it so softly that Sherlock lets himself slip the other hand off of his face.  “Don’t ever apologize for saying that to me.”
He’s married.  He’s having a child.  His world still falls apart anyway, despite the facts.  He wishes he wasn’t so terrible all the time.
John stands at the end of the lab counter, looking away from the man, whom he now realizes is rather tall and gangly, hair a dark mop yet sitting perfectly on his head, eyes sharp.  John tries very hard not to think about the word that pops into his head when he looks the man straight in the face and does not succeed.
Late one Sunday afternoon, when the shop was closed and there was no telly to watch, John found himself up on their building’s roof with Phillip. He did a crossword absentmindedly while Phillip looked around all of London with a pair of binoculars.
“Just tell him,” Moriarty pleads.  Over and over.  It doesn’t matter really, how much he wants to beg.
They both laugh a little.  John shakes his head as he stares down at the signature.  Sherlock is an impossible man.
“Alright, sure.  I don’t know,” John replies. “But come on, up.”
“You should, but I know why you don’t, why you haven’t.  It’s okay.  It started out my fault but things always get in the way.”
After Phillip walked away, Sherlock turned back to John. He smiled stiffly and kept his hands clasped behind his back. It was as though he hadn’t just kissed John and given him a mild heart attack.
“We tracked the source of the video to this.”
“I’m right here,” John says, and he finds himself pulling Sherlock closer.
“If you’re going to die again, you have to know that I’m in love with you,” John says in a low tone, his hands balled into fists.
“You shouldn’t be in that flat by yourself. Have you even gotten rid of any of his things?”
When Mary is gone, putting John back together is not easy, but after everything else Sherlock has done for him, it doesn’t feel like much.
“Jealous?”
“At Bart’s, yeah,” Molly replies, and it’s as if she must know because her face turns, something almost akin to pity marking it.
“I…I’m tired. Goodnight, John,” Evan said. Evan smiled at him, took his hand away from John’s cheek, and curled into his own bed.”
“Good or bad?” Sherlock asks, his voice low and deep.
Sherlock’s eyebrows furrow and he blinks rapidly.  Is John suggesting what he thinks he’s suggesting?  Sherlock can’t be sure, and if he’s wrong…Christ.
John can feel his heart breaking all over again, for the second, third, fourth, thousandth time.  John imagines so many things, all at once.

“The door has been locked, Mrs. Hudson is going to wonder if I’m okay,” John says as he flips the lock over. He’d locked it per Sherlock’s request.
“So you don’t like boys. Right, sorry. I’m a real wanker I just thought…”
He is happy here, and his wife’s eyes hold a world of possibilities.
This is how John finds himself laying down in an alley, scratched by a knife-wielding drug dealer.
“Surprised to find me here?” Moriarty asks.  “I just thought it’d be funny you know, to push his
John isn’t sure what she means at first.
“Sherlock always replies, he’s Mister Punch Line, he will outlive God trying to have the last word.”
“Shut up,” John says, and closes his eyes.
“I don’t think we can make each other happy. I think we’ve fallen out of love.”
Sherlock smiled, tight mouth, and his eyes narrowed.
“I’m in love with you,” Sherlock says quietly.  His breath shakes, and his hands have made fists, clenching and unclenching.  “I didn’t mean to, it just sort of happened. Sorry.”
“Since when?”
“He said he wanted to speak with you.”
He can’t believe himself but he is wiping at his eyes.
Sherlock stares at the telly without seeing for over an hour until his curiosity gets the better of him.  He has gone to John’s bedroom at night many times, and John has known it.  Years ago, when it was just Sherlock being Sherlock, lurking around, being ridiculous and mad as usual.  If Sherlock were to do it now, to stand outside John’s bedroom door, it would seem like an invasion.  But Sherlock can’t help it, he can’t stop thinking of John asleep in his bed, breathing softly and evenly under clean white sheets.  It isn’t an image that Sherlock has been able to see in months and not like this, not with Mary gone.  So Sherlock decides it doesn’t matter if this is an invasion, he’s crossed every border with John already.
“Hello,” John said, walking up to the men. “I sorely wish I hadn’t heard your conversation, but unfortunately I did. And I’d just like to say, don’t you think that the man you’re talking about is a real person, and probably deserves a bit more respect than what you nobodies are giving him?”
“Yes. Sorry. John I’m so sorry,” Sherlock starts, and then his eyes dart left and right, anxious. “I’m.” Sherlock shoves his hands in his pockets.
“But I want to,” she says and smiles wide.  John is actually starting to look annoyed and that just isn’t correct.
He knows Mary will be here soon.  He puts the ring back into his jacket and downs some more wine, trying to ease himself a bit.  He orders champagne from a waiter and just as he finishes doing so, he sees Mary coming down to join him.  He can’t help but smile wide at her.  She looks beautiful, her purple dress a good match for her, and she’s positively glowing.
“Come on, let’s go back to bed.”
“I think you were going to say something like this.”
John never saw Cecelia after that.
“What do I say?” she asks John.  John despises her in this moment.  He despises himself more.
“He died because I shook his hand,” Sherlock says, head swerving around in every direction.  Something else happened to him in the cab, though John doesn’t know what.
And then he does laugh.  He can’t help it.  He closes his eyes and laughs harder than he can remember until he’s crying too.  It’s a mess, all of it, but Sherlock has always been a mess.  He’s aware that John is watching him, waiting for him to become coherent again.
Mary had nearly killed them both.
John arrives back at Mary’s flat around four thirty in the morning.  She sits up in their bed, pushes her hair out of her face.  John sits on the bed, puts a hand to her cheek.
“Please, will you do this for me?” Sherlock asks.
“No, you,” Sherlock replies.
Sherlock slides into the seat next to him.
“Yes, and?”
“You picked the name!”
Only, Sherlock has been shackled for too many years to remember.
“Good.”
Sherlock takes a drink before responding.   He’s certain he is going to say something stupid.
Sherlock huffed out a laugh and nodded, clearly pleased with John’s answer. “You know I have thought about you often.”
snore!  But only when you’re extremely tired.  I love it.”
Sherlock’s hand is insistent, and it begins to pull at John’s shirt until John gets the idea.
The knife cuts down his calf, and he thinks he really may have failed this time.  But he is able to dodge to the left just in time, grabs the knife, and aims down.  It’s the first time he kills a man in ten years and he hates every second of it.  The alternative of dying in this French alley himself without seeing John again is far more terrifying.
“Sherlock,” John says.  He’s about four feet away, standing.  He places his feet six inches apart and becomes steady.  The Earth could implode and John Watson would not move from this spot.  His hands are balled up into fists, steady.
, John thinks.
“I appreciate it,” Sherlock says. “I mean it.”
It’s been a year.  A year without John.  A year patching up his own wounds.  A year talking to himself.  A year knowing he’s desperately in love with someone who will not love him back.  Maybe John had thought of it, but whatever could have been had ended when Sherlock died.
“You just shut up because you are not pushing me away.  Remember what happened the last time you did that?  Hmm?  The last time you did that, you died.  And I died with you.”
John steps away.
“She was just sitting in the chair, waiting for her appointment.  I didn’t know what could have caused it, Sarah pulled her file up before she went to lunch.”
“Is it?  Oh.”
“What do you want?”  John asked.  To this Sherlock had an answer.
They change into pajamas in the dark.
Sherlock knew he had been and yet it hurt all the same.  The desire to run his fingers down John’s cheek and the press his mouth down against his felt like blood boiling and being insanely tired.  He hadn’t been kissed in so long.  Now it’s been longer but he can’t remember what it’s like anyway.
And here is John, back at Baker Street, begging him to quit again.  As if he hadn’t caused it entirely.
“This is delicious Harry, thank you,” John says after another bite.  He feels sleepy, a truly full stomach slowing him.
The problem is, when John arrives back at 221B, Mrs. Hudson is there, all in order.  Sherlock knew she was fine.  And he’d stayed.  Stayed for what?
, as she runs a hand down his arm.
Sherlock Watson.  Thought it could work.
“No, no I’ve never said such a thing in my life,” John said, placing his hands on his hips.
He finally gets a case in Terling.  It’s barely a four but it will have to do.  Despite himself he’s solved the case before he even shows John but he pretends he hasn’t got a clue.
He lifts himself up out of his chair and makes his way towards the door, folder in hand.
“So I was just supposed to think he was dead, for how long?”
“You cock, I knew!”
“Sherlock.”
__________
John tried to leave, feeling sort of raw and defeated. He knew it wasn’t a rejection like a usual one. The schedule of a famous detective was not really something he could control, and it wasn’t as though Sherlock didn’t
“In Russia…they caught me.  I ran but it didn’t make much difference.  They wanted to get information from me, so they…so they gave me those scars.”
Sherlock has never been interested in anyone, yet he’s naked with a woman in his bathroom.  John wonders where Janine has kissed him, can’t help himself.
So John does.  He kisses Sherlock’s mouth, his jawline, his neck.
His father had been sitting on a lawn chair and had looked up from his book and glass of red wine and smiled at John as he walked towards him.
“Yes well it wasn’t supposed to be that long.”
Sherlock is standing there. There’s snow caught in his hair. He’s leaning against 221, smoking a cigarette. John blinks a few times. He inhales and exhales deeply. He’s awake.
John wakes early in the morning.  His head hurts and he’s shaking.
Sherlock’s want is the purest softest pink, like an afterglow.
John looked up to see the first customer of the day, and was surprised to find that the man who had stepped inside looked very familiar. John’s brows pulled together as he tried to place the face. The man had dark curly hair, sharp eyes, and incredible cheekbones. Besides looking familiar, the man was absolutely gorgeous. John coughed into his fist to avoid gaping openly.
This is the last thing he expected.
Once, he gets stuck waiting for the tube. It’s just so crowded, and he thinks he sees his pale, gangly limbs between a woman with blonde hair and a man talking on the phone. John moves to follow the slender figure but loses sight almost immediately. He curses, and heads back to the station and just barely misses the train. He curses again. Thinks harder. John knows it wasn’t him, couldn’t have been. He just wants it to be him so badly. What would he even do if it were really him?
Some part of him wants to roll over and go back to sleep, but he’s done with that.  There will be no more rolling over and pretending he isn’t in love and that everything is fine.  He has hope after all because sometimes Sherlock looks at him and it’s all there, not hidden anymore.
“He’s not off on some adventure. It’s not
“Maybe a little,” John replies, a smirk falling over his lips.  There’s something in his face that Sherlock can’t quite place but it looks…hungry.
John cracks a smile and shakes his head in the dark.  He falls into a deep and dreamless sleep.
“Sherlock, don’t!” John said, but it was too late. Sherlock opened the door and the cameras and the shouting began again. Sherlock was so surprised that John had to pull him away from the door.
“Greg, you remember Sherlock,” John said. Greg raised one brow and then smiled at Sherlock.
“For a man who’s a genius you’ve been incredibly unobservant this time.  How can you not know?”
“I’m never going to lie to you ever again, do you understand that?” Sherlock asks.
How then, can I trust my memory concerning that particular Sunday afternoon?...Beneath the face of anyone you ever loved for true--anyone you love, you will always love, love is not at the mercy of time and it does not recognize death, they are strangers to each other--beneath the face of the beloved, however ancient, ruined, and scarred, is the face of the baby your love once was, and will always be, for you. Love serves, then, if memory doesn't, and passion, apart from its tense relation to agony, labors beneath the shadow of death. Passion is terrifying, it can rock you, change you, bring your head under, as when a wind rises from the bottom of the sea, and you're out there in the craft of your mortality, alone.”
“Oh, I dunno, I got cheated on a whole lot until I met the love of my life, and I have had to regularly work this this utter arsehole recently so,” Greg said, gesturing to Sherlock.
“It was good to see you as well,” John said, feeling strange about the whole thing. His stomach and chest were doing funny things he was trying to ignore, and his mouth was incredibly dry. “Sherlock. With you I. I’m in moral danger. It all seems far too good to be true, you seem to be the perfect person for me. But you are who you are and I fear very much that, were I to entertain this idea of being with you, I would never recover should it end badly. I just really think I would be totally destroyed if this all went south. You would, I am sure, be perfectly fine in the end. Given your turned up coat collar and your cheekbones, and your insane intellect. You are the most wonderful person I’ve ever met. You would be fine. But um, I don’t think I’d survive it.”
“All right,” John says, and begins to wrap the bandage around Sherlock’s torso.
Greg was cooking this evening as Molly would be getting off work at the morgue late. He was making Harry's favorite: spaghetti in red sauce. Greg was a decent cook at best, and John was fearful that Sherlock, who must have been used to caviar served on golden plates at this point, would find the food inedible.
“No,” John says at first, then, “Wait.”
It isn’t easy when most of Scotland Yard takes them in holding hands together for the first time.  John knows Sherlock had been nervous.  He’d only held his hand tighter.
“Any…boyfriends? Which is fine by the way.  It’s all fine.”
John doesn’t understand what she’s on about, so he simply nods, then stands.
He wishes very much that he could be better.
Sherlock wakes up and rolls over to his left.  His arm bumps into something solid.  His head hurts just a bit and then he remembers.
“Yes, it’s, good.  A bit expensive though.”
“So I was right?”
Later, John gets in a cab with his soon to be fiancé, and Sherlock walks back towards Baker St.  He smokes three cigarettes.  He finds himself automatically going down the same streets he said he’d never go to again.  He enters the drug den easily.  He makes the purchase easily.  It’s not the same people anymore and he isn’t sure if that means anyone got out or if it just means they all became nothing.
“Of course it is.  It’s always my fault, hm?  All I knew was that I wanted you so badly, and now I have you, and I’m supposed to give that up?  I don’t think so.  It isn’t fair.  I won’t let you go away when I’ve just gotten you back.  I’ve suffered so much because I’ve wanted you.  Do not deny us this.  I don’t want to be good and hide anymore.”
The memory comes and goes easily, but it means something more now.
“All I can think of is the Ritz, it’s where he last stayed.” John sat between Harriett and Mrs. Hudson, while Greg and Molly were in the front and Phillip was pushed to the storage area of the car. Everyone argued about the route until finally Greg lost his cool.
“Is he alive?” John manages.
“Thank you,” Sherlock says quietly.  Sherlock eyes him, mouth slightly open, as if about to say something else.
As soon as John gets out of the cab, Sherlock calls him, tells him to look up.
“This is what he needs you to do.” Mycroft sets his teacup down and picks up his umbrella. “He wasn’t supposed to contact you. That was very stupid of him.”
“I can’t believe I can just do that,” John said, at the same moment that Sherlock whispered “You have to leave.”
They shake hands.  Sherlock’s ungloved hand holds John’s for four seconds, and it is completely wrong.  Sherlock takes two steps back, watching John, then looks at his feet, then turns in full.  He does not look back.
“What did I say?”
“All right?”
“Go on,” John asks, wrapping his hands around his mug to give himself something to do.
“You said you wished I had stayed dead.”
“Oh my God,” John whispers, and runs back out of the flat.
“Oh, thank you. Should I open it now?”
Sherlock has thought about it many times but has tried to avoid it.
“No, of course I’m not sad about Mary.  I felt nothing but relief when the whole ordeal was over.  When she was taken into custody I went home and slept for two days straight.  And then I called you.”
At the wedding, John had made a joke of it.
He pulls a copy of Piano Player by Kurt Vonnegut off the shelf.  It’s worn and tearing.  John opens it.  It’s a signed copy.
__________
“Do you want to come up?”
“It sure feels like it.”
“Doctor Watson, Mrs. Roberts has passed out on the floor, we need help.”
Harry has all but forced him to come over for dinner.  She knows the signs: she’s lived it.  She’s made a roast and the last time John has eaten something homemade and hot was months ago.  She’s also brought out a bottle of red wine and John doesn’t have the energy to stop her.  He certainly doesn’t have the energy to stop himself.  He accepts the food and the wine alike.  It isn’t as if he wouldn’t go home and drink all by himself anyway.  At least drinking with others was acceptable—albeit it being with one’s alcoholic sister.
“No, no, really it’s actually quite sensible,” Harry said, nodding at Phillip. Phillip was shaking his head.
“No.  I know it’s fine.”
The woman came back in, and Greg was behind her. Sherlock held out a hand and John shook it, the action feeling all wrong for what had just taken place.
“I smoked constantly.  After you moved in I tried to stop but, I know you aren’t an idiot.”
“I don’t mind,” John says.
John takes another sip of his beer and then gets up from his chair.  He walks to Sherlock.
__________
“No,” Sherlock says.  “I would do anything for you.  Anything that you could ever ask.  But I am not her.”
John was about to hang up, when he heard the laugh from the other end.
“I’m fine,” John says.  He’s afraid to move.  He’s so shocked the hand is there and is afraid that as soon as he moves a muscle it will disappear.  Sherlock’s hand is warm and calming and it doesn’t seem like it could be real.  Sherlock’s eyes stay steady but become less intense, and then he looks away.  The hand is slowly drawn back.  It feels like a slap.
Sherlock laughs.
“Sherlock was the reason I didn’t go to prison!” Angelo declared, setting a glass of wine in front of John.
“No, friends protect people.”
“They hurt, they hurt….”
“When I first met you, you know, I waited to ask you out, because I didn’t think you’d say yes,” she says, taking a sip of gin and smiling into her cup.
“Okay.”
“We both can get a bit…lost, it seems,” John says.  Harry smiles genuinely and raises her wine glass.  They toast to being broken, indulging.
He had to ask the man he was in love with, who had pretended to be dead for two years, to be his best man.  It was ridiculous yet it was the only thing that made much sense.  Sherlock still was his best friend, despite how much he had hurt him, unintentional or not.
__________
“Hello,” said a voice.  A deep, kind voice.  John looked up from his pint and saw Ellis.  He patted John twice on the back, a sort of rhythmic, easy gesture.  John knew he probably looked all sorts of wound up.  Ellis motioned for the bartender and ordered.
Sherlock continues to look confused, and doesn’t move.
“No, no, absolutely not,” John says in a rush, and takes Sherlock’s wrist in his hand.
“Okay,” John says.
“What are our options?” he asked, raising an eyebrow at Phillip.
Ellis kissed him, then pushed him away, then left.  That was the last time John saw him.
Moran gets a kick into Sherlock’s liver, and Sherlock doubles over.
As soon as he says so, Sherlock makes for John’s belt, undoing the buckle.  John stops him.
John got up out of bed and began to get ready to open shop. He showered, shaved, and made his way downstairs to the kitchen, where Phillip was waiting for him.
It’s impossibly simple.  How can it be so simple?  Sherlock feels like crying.  He feels like crawling under the table and putting his knees in the damp grass, letting the moisture soak into the cloth and laying his head down on John’s lap.  He feels like sleeping there while the sun shines down and the leaves continue to fall.  He feels he wants to say the same thing and many other things and maybe nothing at all.
