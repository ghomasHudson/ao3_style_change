“I observe everything. From what I observe, I deduce everything. When I've eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, no matter how mad it might seem, must be the truth. When the police are out of their depth, which is almost always, they contact me.” John’s eyes widened. It sounded so absurd, but he could see the seriousness in Sherlock’s eyes and the way he so easily spouted out what he did was convincing enough.
Lestrade smiled as Sherlock walked away. Taking the blanket from around his shoulders, Sherlock bundled it up as he approached John, standing at the side of a police car. He tossed the blanket through the open window of the car and ducked under the police tape.
Sherlock chanted silently to himself, tears prickling behind his clenched eyes. How many times had he been in this same position growing up? He had thought he was being clever, but the other boys never understood and beat him until he could no longer breathe. That’s why he had taken care to train himself in various forms of self-defense, but there was no way he could fight back now, not with John. He had tried to keep him from Mary’s betrayal, but how could he now, knowing that Mary’s chances of survival were slim to none at this point. Sherlock tried so hard to save John from this, but he always had to mess it up, didn’t he?
Sherlock enjoyed this part best: the sweet nothings from John. Being called “perfect” and “brilliant” made his chest warm. It made him feel pliant under John’s fingers. John caressed the delicate skin under Sherlock’s ear, feeling the other man melt deeper into his shoulder, and called Sherlock beautiful. John smiled against the side of Sherlock’s face. He was absolutely beautiful.
Papers and books were strewn across the floor. A skull rested upside down on the couch. Sherlock was nowhere to be found, but John just had to make sure. He climbed a narrow set of stairs into an empty bedroom. Mounds of folders occupied the bed. Back downstairs, he looked past the kitchen and noticed a door slightly ajar. Kitten heels
Stomps sounded outside before two men came in, emergency kits in hand. They rushed to put him on a stretcher. John blurted out his vitals to them.
He ended their visit with a prescription for amoxicillin and said he goodbyes to his patient. Sarah gently rapped on his door again.
A tingling pleasure jolted through Sherlock’s spine. He opened his mouth in a soundless gasp and clutched onto John’s arms for balance. John swiped his thumb across the slit again and enjoyed the way Sherlock’s eyes fluttered shut in ecstasy. John twisted his hand around Sherlock’s cock, changing the rhythm to a slower, more firm speed. Sweat gathered at Sherlock’s hairline and just above that lovely cupid bow-shaped mouth. John leaned in and flicked his tongue across his upper lip. Sherlock tasted salty mixed with just the slightest hint of an unscented moisturizer. Sherlock threw his head back, exposing his gorgeously pale neck for John to suck and lick as he pleased. John was an inch away from Sherlock’s throat when he noticed a fading bite mark under Sherlock’s jaw. Anger flared in John’s chest. No one would have Sherlock other than him. John made a mistake not making it clear to the world that Sherlock Holmes was his. John ground his teeth before licking a stripe up the front of Sherlock’s throat and sucking a mark onto his Adam’s apple.
“It’s obvious that his ex-fiancé ordered a hit on him. Now, she must’ve not known that the hitman she hired was an absolute amateur, because I can think of at least five hundred thirty-nine ways of killing and successfully disposing of a body, and this is not even a remotely successful method.”
They stared at each other for a few seconds longer before she relaxed and set out to make tea. The clinking of ceramic mugs brought Sherlock out of the bedroom. Mrs. Hudson went over with a mug of tea.
“I certainly hope so.” She crossed her arms over her chest. “I have known Sherlock for a long time, John,”
Sherlock whipped around so fast that John couldn’t stop himself from bumping into the taller man. “Rude? He’s the one who called me irksome!”
He took a few minutes to calm himself. He hadn’t realized that someone’s gaze could get his heart racing like that. Of course, he was caught peeping, so there was good reason behind those icy eyes. John shook his head and turned to his new bedroom. Inside, there was a reasonably good sized bed, much bigger than his old one, and a small green chair resided in the corner. He draped his robe over the chair and lay back onto the unfamiliar mattress. It was a bit too soft, but comfortable enough for his leg. After hours of staring up into the plain cream colored ceiling, he decided that his bed option for sleep was to have himself a wank. There was no better way to break in your new place.
John thought he loved her, and when he had readied himself for his proposal at The Landmark Hotel, he thought it was the best thing to do: make an honest man of himself and put the past behind him no matter how much of him he would lose.
John was gentle in his examination of Sherlock’s wounds as he patched him up. When they stepped into the hall, the blood had disappeared. Sherlock closed his eyes. John nudged his shoulder. Sherlock opened his eyes to watch a tired Redbeard limp down the hall toward him. John kissed him on the cheek. “You’re brilliant, Sherlock, just brilliant.”
“I want to look at you,” Sherlock spoke in a thick baritone. His arousal was obvious in the syrupy drawl of his words. John didn’t know what to do with himself, so he turned his palms out and stood as still as he could in front of Sherlock. The detective’s eyes didn’t dart across his flesh like other times, assessing all the things he could from various parts of John’s body, but glided slowly over him. When Sherlock’s eyes dragged back to meet John’s, the doctor kicked off his shoes and worked the button of his jeans. Sherlock’s eyes didn’t stray even at the sound of John’s zipper dragging down.
John’s body had stilled so much that Sherlock could hardly react fast enough to avoid the punch thrown into his face. John sent his fist crashing into Sherlock’s nose, causing the taller man to fall to the floor. Sherlock couldn’t scramble to his feet fast enough before John kicked him in the ribs. John straddled Sherlock’s abdomen and struck his face multiple times. Sherlock kept his eyes squeezed shut.
John rose to the balls of his feet just a bit and pressed his lips to Sherlock’s. They both held still, mouths closed and hearts beating fast.
“Well, it sounds like you have several problems that can be traced back to anxiety. I suggest that you see a therapist about that. I’m sure that everything will clear up after seeing one.” The woman frowned a bit, but finally nodded.
To not have to explain where he had been or what he had done or who he used to be was a relief. That beautiful man with the elegant violinist fingers and the calculating stare had asked John to come look at a flat with him tomorrow.
Most of Sherlock's past wounds had visible scars, but there was one that still gaped fresh and burning even into his adult years. Sherlock never once thought that it would happen. He had lived with that word all his life, but never could imagine John saying it to him. In the early stages of their friendship, he had dreaded the moment it would come out; a reminder to Sherlock that John was just like everyone else, but when it never came, he thought that it never would.
Sherlock’s eyes grew hot, but he managed to keep the tears at bay. Victor’s eyes watched him carefully. He may not have the intellect that Sherlock had, but Victor was still incredibly bright. Sherlock’s throat felt swollen and the words grated their way out.
That night at the pool when the two madmen squared off, John swore he could see the similarities. If Sherlock ever wanted to, he could be just as malicious. Sherlock didn’t believe in angels or demons or whatnot, and John wasn’t sure he did either, but John swears that there must be a higher power that created Sherlock to combat Moriarty. What else could it be? To have these two men exist together has to be more than just coincidence. The universe is rarely so lazy.
Maybe they shouldn’t have tried to pursue something more than the friendship they already had. John was pushing Sherlock into something he wasn’t entirely ready for. Maybe the best thing to do was to take a step back and reestablish their broken friendship. John let his eyes flutter closed against the bright lights of the hospital, not yet ready to take on whatever waited for him with Sherlock.
When John arrived at the surgery, Sarah greeted him like today was no different from all the other days, but John knew otherwise. Sherlock not being there in the morning was not something out of the ordinary, but the way they ended the previous day had set the mood for the following days. John entered his office and pushed aside his persona thoughts in order to treat his patients more effectively. It was going to be an incredibly long day, but he would have some time during lunch to consider how to properly apologize to Sherlock. It had been his fault anyway. He had turned the heavy darkness in his chest against Sherlock.
John was finally shirtless. Sherlock ran his hands over John’s perfectly stocky body. He loved all of it: freckles, scars, hard muscle, and the softness in his belly. Sherlock adored John in the skin he was in. Sherlock trailed his fingers over John’s warm skin as he walked over to his chair. John turned to follow him, unsure of where he was going. Sherlock sat sprawled in his chair; the bulge in his trousers was unmistakable. John stood there feeling uncomfortably aware of his hardening nipples in the coolness of the flat.
John retrieved his shirt and faced the windows. It wasn’t Sherlock’s fault that he was the way he was, and John shouldn’t be angry with him. He didn’t understand what was going on in Sherlock’s head, and he could hardly imagine what it’s like in there. John frowned at the bison skull above him. Sherlock’s skulls certainly knew more about him that John did.
When Sherlock stopped shaking enough to breathe full breaths, he sat on the bed and slid the jumper over his head. John took the duvet, wrapped it around Sherlock, and sat next to him.
“Sherlock,” John panted. All he wanted to do was kiss that perfect mouth of his. He had just reached the doorway when he noticed a certain pregnant woman.
“I’ve figured that.” Sherlock frowned a bit. “I mean, judging from how and what you have said to your brother and the landlady-”
Sherlock was still asleep half past ten in the morning. John sat in his chair and surveyed the sitting room. As much as he wanted to trust that Sherlock gave him all the narcotics in his possession, Sherlock was still an addict. John tried to spot anything that looked out of place, but Sherlock’s mess was as how it had always been. The chaos of the flat was an almost endearing trait of Sherlock’s. He had tried to tidy things in the past, but stacks of papers, files, and books still littered nearly every surface. John spent the next thirty minutes sitting there in silence, listening to the snores coming from Sherlock’s bedroom.
Sherlock barked out a cold laugh. “You’ve got your driver waiting outside. You have no intention of being here for much longer. Don’t be so dull, Mycroft. It doesn’t suit you.” Sherlock leaned in ever so slightly, back staying absolutely straight. “Just like today’s waistcoat. Try revisiting your tailor to get it resized,” he whispered threateningly.
“I,” Sherlock faltered, “I didn’t mean to. He found me this afternoon, and he threatened to tell you of our past if I didn’t try the new batch he had made.”
With Sherlock gently snoring away on the couch, John rose from his light doze and stumbled to where his jeans lay crumpled in a heap on the floor. He put on his bottoms and quietly went upstairs.
John had hardly noticed his quickening breaths and counted to ten forward and backwards until his breaths had returned to normal. He couldn’t stomach sitting there anymore, so he gathered his cane and jacket and left for a walk.
“A traditional upbringing suggests that I should, but there is not enough empirical data to make me believe in such nonsense, so no.”
“Really? I thought it was a big improvement. Your mouth’s too small now.” He returned to his spot behind the station.
John lay in bed wishing he could just lie quietly next to Sherlock, hearing the cogs in his mind whirring busily and his gentle breaths. Sherlock was always careful to not breathe too loudly while John was trying to sleep. He was oddly considerate. John was thinking of Sherlock’s skin when he suddenly awoke, catching himself just before falling into a deep sleep. John sat up slowly and regretted that he didn’t think to bring the water Lestrade left out for him upstairs. He glanced over at the clock on his nightstand; it was just after three in the morning, and nearly fainted back into bed with joy when he remembered that it was the weekend and didn’t have work in the morning.
“Don’t do that Sherlock. If this is the case, he is suffering something he might be able to get a handle on. The poor man suffers from PTSD already. Imagine if you start digging into his thoughts. He will resent you. A woman at my Tuesday bingo night has a son with depression, and it’s just terrible.”
“Really, Sherlock, I’m crushed! I just happened to be walking by when I saw that beautiful head of curls in the window.” Victor leaned in. “You know how much I hate seeing you alone.”
“Want some of mine,” John asked shyly. Sherlock hesitated before nodding. For a moment, they stared in weird silence. Sherlock half expected John to slide his plate over, but what he definitely was
“John is still a man, Sherlock, and I don’t think I have to tell you how thick we can be,” Lestrade laughed, accepting the solved case files Sherlock handed him. “I doubt he meant to hurt you.”
John tried to look innocent, but both of them knew otherwise. “Yes. Yes, must have been, through that window.”
“He doesn’t love me anymore,” John slurred. Lestrade nursed his first pint across from him. There would be no way to get properly pissed knowing that John was already halfway through his third pint and near tears.
Despite how much Sherlock detested the yeasty taste of ale, he loved that dark look in John’s face, and there was nothing he wanted more in that very moment than to satisfy that hungry stare. Sherlock downed the pint in just a few gulps. He wiped his mouth with the back of his hand and set his lips in a satisfied smirk.
Sherlock had a blanket draped over his shoulders. He frowned and tried to shrug it off when the DI came over.
“He likes it raw,” Victor growled through the pain. “He doesn’t need any prep. I like to just ram my fucking cock in his arse and let him scream through it.”
John stared at Sherlock’s blank expression. The bastard had gone and left him for his mind palace. John began to pull away when Sherlock focused and held onto his forearms.
Sherlock bit back his snarky retort and raised his fingers to bring someone over. John lunged forward and fisted Sherlock’s collar. Adrenaline surged through Sherlock’s veins at John’s suddenness, and how despite the violent movement, the table hardly rattled. The dimness of the pub didn’t allow for Sherlock to read John’s expression as well as he was used to, but John’s eyes were dark with something he couldn’t quite pinpoint despite its familiarity. Since the start of their little arrangement, Sherlock has found John to be unpredictable. He found it a bit unsettling at first: not being able to see John’s decisions before he could actually make them. But now, excitement coursed through Sherlock’s veins.
He turned on the shower and peeled off his sweaty clothes. When the water was scalding, Sherlock stepped in. He gently scrubbed the new injection point. The water was painful, but he needed to feel something different than the hollowness in his chest. He hung his head, letting his hair fall into his face. Tears flowed hot down his face and mixed with the water. He had almost lost a battle in his own head, and it had been Moriarty’s doing. He had managed to corrupt the things he loved most from the deepest parts of his mind palace.
“That’s enough to be going on with, don’t you think?” He opened the door again, halfway out. “The name’s Sherlock Holmes, and the address is two two one B Baker Street.” And just like that, with a wink and a goodbye to Mike, he was gone.
It was a different world from the alleys he normally found himself in when he was with Sherlock; he knew his way through them, and the sound of Sherlock’s shoes pounding the pavement in front of him was grounding.
“I don’t make you do anything. That’s the problem.” Sherlock held his palms out for John’s hands. The calluses on his trigger finger and heel of his palm grazed his own and sent a shudder through his shoulders. Sherlock gingerly caressed the edges of his swollen knuckles with his thumb. He brought them closer to his face so he could carefully smell how old the blood on his hands were and count the number of eight millimeter (roughly) gashes there were. Sherlock inspected the blood under his thumbnail.
Soft smoky tendrils swirled around Sherlock’s head. The slight burn in the back of his throat was comforting. He closed his eyes and held the cigarette with the corner of his lips.
Victor dropped his hand. “Hm, I suppose you’re not actually here to try the best cocaine in the area. Well, what can I do you for then, brother? Any friend of Sherlock’s,” Victor’s grin grew into a vile sneer, “is a friend of mine.”
“I am,” Sherlock growled. He wrapped his large pale hands around the sides of John’s face and mashed their lips together. Their kiss was a mess of saliva and teeth. He couldn’t catch his breath against John’s mouth, but it was so intoxicating, he didn’t give a damn. Sherlock shimmied his coat from his shoulders where it hung heavily at his elbows.
Lestrade thought. He had picked up enough of Sherlock’s deduction skills to notice little signs like that.
John had woken up entangled in his sweat soaked sheets. He covered his ear where the words buzzed. He reached for the glass of stale whiskey and drank it whole. It took him almost a year to realize that Sherlock was never coming back. John could no longer wait for a man that would make him suffer for so long.
“I am very aware that human nature is not my strength. Mary made that very clear to me. However, I don’t particularly appreciate your lack of responsibility in this issue.”
Groggily, Sherlock smiled and sat up. “Just a dream.” When John dipped back into the kitchen, Sherlock spread his fingers and frowned at the dark punctures between his fingers.
“Problem?” John could hardly believe it as he glanced at Mike, who only smiled at the other man. Was this man thick in the head? He faced him again, trying not to let his disbelief be too obvious.
Sherlock led the way out of the station and waited for John by the kerb. “What were you two discussing so intimately?” John stopped behind Sherlock’s right shoulder and tried to see his face, but he kept turning away from John’s gaze.
“Oh, goodness! You can’t possibly keep us apart. We’re so bloody perfect for one another.” Victor leaned forward. “Does that make you angry, John Watson?” John gritted his teeth. He could kill the fucking bastard. It would be so easy here in this alley. He could slam his head into the brick wall, causing a major concussion and definitely confusion. It would give him enough time to move him further into the alley where he would break every bone in his body and every tooth in his mouth.
“Well, I can tell you right now, why that would,” John said proudly. “Donovan calls you that, and you’re not very fond of her.”
“You’re going to regret the day you ever met Sherlock Holmes.” John punctuated his sentence with a hand to Victor’s throat. John gathered himself and Victor up to their feet and held him against the brick.
“You know how valuable my mind palace is,” Sherlock stated. “After we made our amends, I quickly discovered a grave problem in my mind palace. Moriarty’s web had managed to capture you, or at least, the projection of you that resides in there. The Watson of my mind patrols the halls with his gun at the ready. He keeps Moriarty in his restraints.” Sherlock breathed silently for a minute or two. He hoped that John would understand. That was the only thing he wanted, really, was for him to understand why he made the choices he had. Sherlock didn’t care if he liked it. He was always going to do what he thought was right, but if John was incapable of recognizing the “why” behind them, then he would know that their relationship would never reach his idealized version.
When John had settled into his bedsit this morning, he had no idea that he would be returning to St. Bart’s after years to see about a flatshare. Mike hadn’t given him any details about who they were going to see, but as John handed the slim stranger with the well-tailored suit and dark curls his phone, he supposed there should have been some sort of introduction before this moment.
The two men had smiled awkwardly at each other, the sympathy in Mike’s eyes obvious despite the crinkles around them. In the awkward moments between them, when Mike caught the glazed over look on his old friend’s eyes, John could see the battlefield in front of him. The laughing children and the old couples were blasted into enemy fire and blood stained sand. Orders were muffled by the ringing in his ear. The sharp pain of the bullet wound ran up his neck.
“There was someone from my younger days,” Sherlock began quietly. “We had grown up innocently together as children, but during our young adult lives, he had taken a different path from mine. Rather than let him go, I followed. We had a relationship through drugs and rough sex, but when Mycroft forced me into rehab, that ended as well. I had not seen him for years, but I always knew where exactly he dealt. When I would relapse, it was his product that I sought, and he never argued.” Sherlock lowered his face in his hands to breathe deeply. He wasn’t fully prepared to divulge this past with John, but the cocaine in his system made him loose.
John ignored Sherlock’s whining and entered through the lab door. He knew that all the labs were nearly identical, but this one was definitely special. Sherlock immediately went to his regularly used microscope like it had its own gravitational pull.
The image of his pale face covered in blood never left him. When he closed his eyes, the darkness was drenched in blood. John spent days without sleep; as soon as he’d shut his eyes, the sound of Sherlock’s skull hitting the pavement woke him up. He would spend the next few hours telling himself that he didn’t hear it. He couldn’t have known what it sounded like. The only time he would fall asleep was when he was on the tube or the bus, but even then he’d jerk awake when it felt like he was the one plummeting off St. Bart’s. The others tried to keep in touch with him, Molly and Lestrade visiting him on occasion, but John could see the pain in their eyes when they’d look at Sherlock’s chair. John had stopped spending time in the sitting room. The very flat reeked with Sherlock’s scent, and there was only so much he could take before he felt like he was suffocating in it. Mrs. Hudson would bring him biscuits and teas, but she’d return the next day to find them untouched by his chair. John had spent an entire day sobbing in the corner of his room when she had brought two cups. He could hear Sherlock in his head, calling him an idiot or telling him something was wrong in that beautiful baritone. Those were the better days where he could smile a little at the thought of Sherlock’s presence being so grand that it stuck with him even after death.
“And frankly a bloody awful cabbie.” Sherlock chuckled, and then turned to lead them away as he speaks.
“I’ve gone through this before,” Sherlock groaned, “but it never gets any easier.” John rubbed easy circles into Sherlock’s shoulder blades. He knew that with wounds like Sherlock’s, the nerves would be sensitive and easily aggravated just like his own bullet wound, even after it had healed so many years ago.
The wedding had been brutal for the both of them, John was sure. He tried his best to make it seem like he was happy to be tying the knot with Mary, but Sherlock giving his best man’s speech made it feel like they were getting married instead, and his heart ached for it. Sherlock would make for a striking husband, but as Mary held his hand, he was only reminded that he would never be the one standing at the altar with him. There Sherlock was though, making someone else’s wedding day about himself with a murder. John was grateful that he had saved James Sholto’s life.
“I suppose we’ll do the statement later, yeah,” Lestrade sighed, watching Sherlock stalk toward the entrance of the alley.
Sherlock’s eyes darted behind his eyelids. He watched every image of what was about to happen flash through his head, but there was only one image he wanted to become reality, and there was only one way of seeing this thing’s end.
“I was telling Lestrade how much I love the way your hands speak more than your mouth; how beautiful your hands look as they move.” John took Sherlock’s hand and pressed his lips to his palm just below the calluses from years of playing the violin. Sherlock glanced around anxiously. He didn’t care if his relationship with John was made public; he just didn’t want the world to see John this way. Only he was allowed to see the gentle side of his captain.
“Look, I know this must be incredibly odd: two men living together only after one suffers from cocaine overdose and the other has been invalided home from the battlefield and wanking to each other in front of their windows.” John chuckled at the ridiculousness of it all. “But I think we can do this-” He waved his around. “This whole domestic business.”
Sherlock’s heart was aching in his chest. At that moment, Sherlock wanted to take John’s Sig and pull the trigger at his temple. This was a lot harder than how it seemed on the tele. Mind palace John made it seem so easy. For fuck’s sake, his chemistry education was easier than this. Sherlock was too scared that he would choke on his words if he tried to steady his breathing, so he stood there with his lungs burning from the strain and his hands trembling at his sides. He didn’t know if he would get another chance like this. When he saw his reflection, rather than turning around the other direction, Sherlock decided to take the plunge into the deep end. He had to get used to the man he was becoming, but he had no doubt that he needed John to be by his side through it all. John was the head as he was the heart. He kept Sherlock’s emotions in check and ran into the fray, no questions asked. Sherlock would never be whole again without him.
To make up for my lack of chapter updates, here's a 2nd update for y'all, and HERE IT IS: THE SMUTTTTTTT
Boiling water was poured over the gashes across his back. He fought against the tears at the corners of his eyes. The Siberians could smell weakness a mile away, so the last thing he needed to do was show it. Sherlock understood their language, but when their sentences were dotted with English, Sherlock had to pause his internal translation. His capturers didn’t speak an ounce of English.
John didn’t realize how intensely he was staring until a cabbie honked outside. He snapped out of his trance and moved back into his living room, unaware of how far he had been leaning out his window to observe the odd stranger. He would go back to his previous residence to gather the rest of his clothing. Not much, of course, but there was still some jumpers left to retrieve, and how could his landlord say “no” to a wounded ex-army doctor?
, John thought. Of course, John wasn’t averse to doing what Sherlock wanted, but he wanted to do this for Sherlock.
“Can we finally do this properly,” he sighed. John answered by turning his head and meeting Sherlock’s soft lips. Their kisses were light and unhurried. Sherlock’s mouth was warm from the tea. John twisted his body to press his chest into the taller man, maneuvering his knee in between his legs. Sherlock opened his body to him.
He had let the frustration get the better of him and took it out on the flat all in front of Sherlock. Sherlock must’ve thought,
How surprisingly soothing John was against his skin- firm and delicate all the same. As they cautiously ascended the stairs to the flat, Mrs. Hudson discussed with John how several men had come through that morning with boxes of clothing and knickknacks.
"Sorry again, but these are the house rules, which you agreed upon when checking in," she points out.  "Have a good evening."  Her steps recede down the hallway.
"It was my idea to bring it in.  When it seemed like Miss Cushing's sister would push her to move into a care home and sell the house, Brian and I became desperate. It's been a good arrangement.  Miss Cushing needed the money.  We needed somewhere to live, so she took us in.  But we've always known it would happen eventually.  She's old enough, she could pass anytime, even if she's healthy right now.  And where would we go, then?  It's not like we have any big savings.
As well as meeting someone, Sherlock muses. That explains the flowery blouse with a frilled neckline and new shade of lipstick.  Oddly enough, the new tone suits her skin colouration.  "As I texted you earlier today, Mr James might have gotten himself sick by eating these.  Or, he didn't and died anyway."
They go through the usual. Sleeping patterns, eating habits, drinking habits. He’s got these things under control nowadays. Feels like an A+ student - done his homework, become mostly functional.
"Christ!  You can count yourself lucky you didn't have to see that."  Lestrade looks around, as if he's about to let them in on a secret.  "Now, promise to keep mum about this--Anderson has taken a few days off."
The boy didn't actually sing that well, it was genuinely more screaming than singing, which was par for the course. He exuded raw energy, and the vocals gave vibrations to his throat. He strained his neck when he lifted his chin towards the mic, tendons and bulging veins visible. And his hands - the long fingers on his left sliding along the neck of the bass, while the right worked fast and hard over the strings at crotch height -
The dining table folds out, so Sherlock and John had put on gloves to start to spread out the envelopes on top of it.  They all have printed stickers with the name and address.  Inkjet printer, probably printed in a home, at least not in an office or any official setting.  Though that could have been a deliberate choice to confuse.
Rosie is unperturbed by the attention. She promptly starts ripping wrapping paper, more interested in the delightful texture and the sound of ripping than her gifts.
But then he saves Sherlock’s life, or is it Sherlock who saves him? And again he’s been manipulated by those two: a genius junkie and a former assassin, playing games from beyond the grave.
Further west of Brighton Pier, cut off from the shore and surrounded by glittering waves, is what is left of the iconic West Pier.  Storm damage, fire and collapse have reduced the once magnificent pleasure pier to a sculptural iron frame, that cast an eerie beauty over the seafront.  The skeletal remnants of the curved roof on the former concert hall reminds John of a Victorian domed bird cage.
lousy cheating husband and father who resents his marriage. Who’s failed his one shot of having a normal life and becoming a better man, and now she’s dying without him having had a chance to be honest with her.
"I mean, the mere existence of Mycroft and his minions, operating in a very grey area, makes it very easy for me to imagine Moriarty having people on the inside in all those three locations he broke into.  He sneaked himself into Barts IT, why wouldn't he be able to get high security positions for his own people?  It doesn't seem impossible to me."
They reach an underpass, which brings them to endless stretches of car parks and then finally the jetties of the Marina Boatyard, filled with rows and rows of recreational boats.  There are outdoor seating areas in front of the restaurants along the promenade deck.  They're all abandoned in this weather, the sunshades tied down securely, tablecloths and menu boards folded away.
John gets off Sherlock and picks up his phone. Thankfully nothing serious has happened. But Eileen has had an unexpected family emergency, so John needs to leave immediately to pick up Rosie early.
Sherlock is, as always, a provocateur. He bites John’s lip. John pulls Sherlock’s hair, discreetly tilting his head to expose his throat. Sherlock lets out a low moan, eyelashes fluttering.
"He's kept his room tidy, no dishes except for this plate with crumbs and a spot of marmalade and this emptied cup of tea with some dregs of milk."  Sherlock sniffs the mug.  "Not too spoiled, considering the heat.  He's retired, so I imagine he doesn't have commitments early in the morning, except to bring Miss Cushing her paper.  It looks like something or someone must have disturbed his morning routine."
“It’s moments like those that makes parenting quite nice sometimes. It kind of balances things out. There’s so many nappies and smeared food otherwise. Life is always a bit sticky.”
Sometimes John feels very sympathetic towards Ella. When he has to guide a patient to see what’s obvious, preferably with diplomatic restraint.
"I think it's rather impressive that she's been out of the house with that frequency at her age.  I mean, the total of the whole period amounts to just about three times a week."  John gives him a lop-sidded grin.  "I'd say it's nearly triple to your frequency of just popping by Tesco for milk."
"I'm terribly sorry to disregard the Do Not Disturb sign, but the smoke is spreading to other guest rooms.  One more complaint, and you'll be fined and asked to leave."
John’s already comfortable in a plush seat in a recess, the small table in front of him filled with bottles of mineral water, hibiscus tea and small Turkish Revani cakes that look like petit fours.
Sherlock stares at it, sneering.  He then blows it out with unnecessary force.  "I know what you're doing, John.  You think I haven't noticed?"  His tone is a mix of disappointment and ire.  "The world's most observant man, and you think I'll miss the gigantic clue of you drinking yourself tipsy in the afternoon and booking a room with one bed?"
“What you value in a relationship, be it a friend, family or a partner, and how well you feel that you live up to your own expectations of maintaining that relationship.”
, shall we?"  Sherlock doesn't deign to answer, only demonstrably pulls off the vinyl glove with his teeth.
It’s time to take the first step. He doesn’t know if he can do it, but at least he needs to give it a try.
"Even though we were cheated of the sea view, because of this bloody shrubbery, the bees seem to like it enough," says John, keeping his distance.
"Okay.  Right."  John rises, looking a bit displeased with the fact that this little adventure seems to be over.
John doesn't mind a gun being present in such situations.  He admittedly doesn't like the concealment.  But, it's the reason behind Sherlock bringing it in the first place, that has him worried.
"Oh, really?"  John quickly catches on.  He's not oblivious, but he is purposeful in being disarmingly flirty.  "Is that so?"
Sherlock slides back along his length as he’s pulsing, maintaining the suction until he has caught all of John’s ejaculate.
John puts his glass on the bedside table and lies down, stretching out.  "I feel like I need another nap."
Sherlock had learnt, early on after his debut, how men with such issues could be triggered into rough behaviour. Derogatory language had sadly been a common side effect that would take him out of it in an instant. He’d used their ingrained fears to his advantage; probing and prodding until he was manhandled, held down, hurt - anything to provide the intensity and pain required to quiet his mind.
“No. No, you’re not insulting me. Of course you’ve wanted coke more than- than this- whatever it is, which is very new, very uncertain and possibly a very bad idea,” John nods to himself while speaking.
Having scant slumber the previous evening, Sherlock nearly falls asleep, but this time, he has the prescience to acknowledge the fact and takes time to arrange his coat on the grass, before laying down properly and seeking respite.  When he wakes, he's quite sure John is sitting closer than before, having taken up the space where Sherlock sat previously.  That is unusual, he recognises.
A long time ago he’d been so sure about what John had wanted from him - cases and casual sex, nothing more. But he could also clearly see the suppression. He soon determined it would have been very unwise to initiate anything sexual. It would have poisoned their relationship. John would want to hide it. And Sherlock couldn’t do that, not with John. He’d grown too attached to him, become sentimental. And they led a dangerous life. This sort of sentiment would have been a serious liability. Better to keep his distance.
This is filthier and dirtier than any same sex activities John’s been involved in, and yet those felt numbingly shameful. This is not. This is the hottest, most beautiful, most
Sherlock does not regret the sacrifices that brought them to this point. With time, Rosie might even become less of a tornado and more of a steady, thoughtful person, like her father.
the shed.  But what if he kept knotweed samples in there somewhere?  I couldn't sleep that night; I wanted the damned weed gone.  Those pickles would be evidence of Brian handling the plant.  Even if he's dead, I wouldn't want him to be remembered as the retired weed-wielding pickling vigilante.  So I figured it best to burn it all, but the officers hung around until very late.  Sergeant Donovan had left me her number, so I called her to make a complaint about your insensitive 'questioning'.  I'm not intimidated by bullies like you, but it seemed a safe course of action to pre-emptively blame my nerves on the situation with you, in case I would be questioned about the fire.
John holds him like that, watching Sherlock’s beautiful mouth open on a moan. He clenches his fists, tugging on soft curls, and Sherlock’s eyes fall closed as he lets out a trembling sound. John does it again, and this time, Sherlock shudders and draws in a sharp breath. His hands slip off of John, scrambling for a grip on the wet mosaic. John catches his wrists, firmly guides Sherlock’s hands onto the seat for support. Sherlock keens.
Sherlock can't believe how John can be so casual about this.  "What do you mean 'complicated'?  It's the most effective solution.  It's what any criminal mastermind would dream of."
John realises he’s slowly sliding his hands back and forth along Sherlock’s calves, feeling small bubbles release from the hairs and tickle his fingers as they rise to the surface. He lets go, unsure of what he’s allowed to do, even in the face of Sherlock’s unabashed flirting.
The fucking disgrace of waking up with a stiffy the middle of a sex dream involving someone not-his-wife, the heat coursing through his veins, making his skin vibrate.
Of all the houses, flats, bedsits, rooms and military quarters he’s lived in, there’s only one other place that has had the same impact on him - 221B Baker Street. It wasn’t just a flat, it really was a
“She had all that, but she also saw right through me from the start, saw how broken I was. And that was okay. She didn’t pressure me. She didn’t break up when I was moody and difficult. She was there, by my side, waiting for me to get better, moving on from-”
He threads his fingers through his hair, pulling a bit at the strands to ground himself before he explodes.
After that, they might possibly try to define what they are to each other, and what they want, or don’t want to do about it.
As John sits down at the kitchen table, Sherlock stands and goes to him. John is pleasantly surprised by the cup landing in front of him. Sherlock remains standing. He doesn’t know where to look. All he can think of is how it felt to touch John, and how he can’t do it now. There seems to be an unspoken rule of no touching, since they only distantly circled each other during the days between their snog and John leaving for Harry’s. He can’t make sense of the relation between them. The sparkling sensation from a couple of days ago, the previous tension between them - is it gone? Is it there? It’s too intangible, unquantifiable.
Well, that's fine; John's brought his coat, too. You never know where a case will take you, or how long you'll be away. It's better to be prepared for anything. He's left the gun, though; it could get awkward when strolling into a crime scene filled with coppers. But the more he thinks on it, with Moriarty on the loose again, it might have been better to bring it, except John can't really walk around central London with a gun on himself on the regular.
He admires her patience. He’s a middle-aged man who’s never really talked about his feelings and hates being confronted with his fears and failings. He knows he’s a nightmarish patient, all doctors are. How bored she must be, with their endless quiet sessions without any visible progress. He presses a tissue at his eyes. It’s a calm, very still crying, no big gulping sobs or wailing. It feels like grief over something he cannot have. Stability, love.
"I'm sure you have your reasons," Sherlock says.  "What I'd like to know is, how many lies you've told me and the officers."
"Oh."  He's right.  There was only the lawn, the odd decorative garden gnome, and the shrubbery that burned with the shed.  So Brian couldn't have picked any flowers there.
"Yeah, you say that, but I'm pretty sure you don't mean it.  Anyway, I do know what's in the jar, with reasonable accuracy.  If you need the lab to confirm it, it's all yours.  I'm done for today."  She reaches for her coat.
He glances over at Sherlock to see how he's suffering the excessive warmth and is somewhat taken aback at how unruffled his friend appears.  Though he professes to care very little about general public opinion, Sherlock's seemingly indifference to his own looks isn't quite true.  John can see that he's taken a few seconds to put some product, or maybe just water, in his hair.  The curls are back to their usual defined and shiny state.  He also has his coat, the one John thinks of as Sherlock's own form of armour, bundled up on his knees. Can't seem to go anywhere without access to that bloody flattering coat collar, even though it's too hot to wear.
"Common ancestor, John," Sherlock corrects him. "It won't do her education any good if you lie to her about how evolution works from the start." Eventually he concedes that that wasn't the point, and removes some of the makeshift hand- and footholds that enabled Rosie to get up there.
Flood lights are set up to light up the garden and the small shed, as the darkness is creeping in.  There's a screen in front of the open door, to obscure the view of the body.  Lestrade finally notices their arrival and strides up to Sherlock's side.
It was awkward, being back with Ella. During the session he’d felt bad for briefly going to another therapist, for not going back to Ella when he’d lost someone again.
Sherlock shrugs. "It's like she said--an ordinary, small cardboard box.  Apparently, she'd immediately put it to use as a container for bread-bag clips in her kitchen drawer."
“I’ve got plenty of scars,” Sherlock murmurs, voice low. “They would make for interesting stories if anyone cared to listen.”
Nevertheless, Sherlock is thankful for the hateful distancing, as it helps him in his struggle to retain his composure. But he’s aching to break their careful dance, to confront, provoke, shatter the walls they constantly put up to-
He kept himself busy at work, barely meeting her in the staffroom. It wasn't healthy for couples to spend both private and work life together, was it? Better make sure they wouldn’t wear each other out.
John kisses him, plunging his tongue deep, while caressing the inside of Sherlock’s thighs, making him tremble.
He’d seen her tattooed arms from the window, but now, when she turns towards him, he can make out the large slightly faded X’s on her forearms, mostly amalgamated with the newer ornamental tattoos covering the full length of her arms.
John's not particularly keen on Brighton, specifically.  It was just a desperate idea that popped up in his mind.  He is not
“Okay coffee, tea and cigarettes,” she admits. “I know you doctors don’t approve of the smoking, but don’t tell me you don’t drink coffee.”
When they return upstairs, Sherlock has brought out his violin, but instead of carols he puts on a song on the speakers, playing along to an old heavy metal song.
"So he grew asparagus, lilies and roses.  Was he meaning to threaten and eventually kill off Miss Cushing by, say maybe sabotaging a batch of pickles and giving them to her?  At her age food-poisoning is more risky."
John huffs. Why is Sherlock always right? It’s annoying to say the least. But Sherlock is the one to daily take Rosie to the park. She loves to see what new flowers have grown, and Sherlock loves to do it with her.
They’re sitting side by side on the garden stairs, sipping Harry’s homemade elderflower cordial with sparkling water.
"Helps me think."  He picks up a shell to show John.  It's perfectly cream-coloured with a brownish pattern.  "See?''  He turns it between his fingers, like a magician would turn a penny.  Then he lets it rest with the rounded inside turned upwards and puts his thumb to it, making small circles in the perfectly digit shaped hollow of the shell.  "Haven't had a smoke since London."
John lets his hands slide up, up from hairy, strong calves, over the lean muscled thighs, to the hairless silky vulnerable insides, all the way to Sherlock’s groin. Then all the way back, using his fingernails. Sherlock keens and his erection bobs.
"John, I know you sometimes doubted me, when Moriarty first made himself known.  Maybe you thought I had a flippant attitude to his crimes.  And you might have been right about that, to a degree.  I didn't fully understand how dangerous he was, until he took you and dressed you in explosives."
"John, I believe this warrants a toast."  They let go of each other's hands and raise their glasses.  Sherlock feels warm inside.  It's imperative he makes his position clear to John.  Now.
Then again, many years in completely different circumstances, deployed and instantly charmed by a superior. Nothing he’d dare to pursue, even if there was a hint of something there, maybe an acknowledgement, maybe even the suggestion of reciprocation.
Something is niggling at John's brain about the drug.  "They're known to potentially have severe dietary interactions, unless you keep a controlled diet."
"Doubt what?"  John is clearly disconcerted by Sherlock's behaviour.  "That she didn't hear or see anything?"
Just as John returns to the main room, contemplating luring Sherlock away from the couch, by letting him rifle through his old army duffle, salvation comes in the form of a phone call.
After bad days, John will provide him with bodily sensations, a piercing focus eliciting a rush of hormones that makes one tension fall away after another until he’s languid, like a piece of clay, held and manipulated by John.
“I think Mrs Hudson prefer us having a whole floor in-between. She wouldn’t like it if we switched rooms with Rosie.”
Ella gently pushes the ever-ready box of tissues towards his side of the small table between them. She waits, as always.
And that’s when the massage really starts. Warm oils are poured over their backs, releasing the scent of oranges and cloves.
John’s insecurities are surging through his mind now and he’s on the verge of sobbing, but Sherlock takes his hands in a tight grip.
He doesn’t consider himself sentimental, but being back in Chelmsford stirs up memories. If he’d name two people who defined his childhood and youth, it wouldn’t have been his parents.
“Don’t be. It’s just how it is. Nothing to be done about it. But I’m here now. And I’ve missed you,” she says with such warmth that he falls into sobbing again.
"I see."  Sherlock sneakily stashes a few biscuits in his pocket.  "And then there came a cardboard box, correct?"
They taste each other, licking and sucking, grappling each others arms and backs. John is straddling Sherlock’s lap, grinding down. It feels marvelous. He reaches for Sherlock’s face again, and Sherlock lets him. Closes his eyes as John caresses his jaw, lets his thumb play with that wet bottom lip.
He’d only had a shard of a life when Mary entered it. He’d desperately clung to her. He didn’t know what to do with himself when she turned out to be a stranger.
“Mary did some unforgivable things. Lied about her past. Led a double life. Deceived me. But I wasn’t good to her even before that. Wasn’t comfortable in that life. Married, living in the suburbs, doing locum work.”
Lestrade wipes the sweat from his forehead with the back of his hand.  "Yeah.  But according to his landlady, he usually uses the clogs by the back door, when he's in the garden.  And, his bath robe was hanging on the outside, thrown over that wall-mounted garden lamp beside said door."  He points to the article of clothing still draped on the lighting fixture.  "That's how she thought to look for him in the garden."
Sherlock starts in on the first pile, reading aloud.  "Milk, eggs, tomatoes and yoghurt.  Milk... eggs... tomatoes.  Seems a bit of a theme.  Toilet-paper, beans and flour.  Weetabix, grapes and orange juice.  Milk... eggs... tomatoes.  Bread.  Bread, bread, bread."
It's a need he's reluctant to admit; the need of John's physical presence to think more clearly, the need of his touch, which provides a distinct focus point and helps him not to get sidetracked by nonsensical details his brain wilfully deems necessary to process.
The topic is sensitive, and Sherlock would rather not have John shout inside Majida's restaurant, so he bides his time, watching John devour the food.  The guests are slowly dissipating, thankfully.  The sounds of contemporary Middle Eastern songs, the current one featuring the oud, plays softly in the background, muffling their voices. When the dessert's been served, and John has his mouth stuffed with baklava, Sherlock makes the jump.
Of course John would be upset seeing him climb several floors up. Not to mention he almost fell, right in front of him.
“Yeah, it was a pretty fast decision. I had intended to come to your wedding, but you could say a crisis arose. Alcohol poisoning.”
John goes very still, barely breathing, the hair on the back of his neck on end.  Then he grabs Sherlock's upper arms, stares him intently in the eyes.  "Tell me, now," he grits out.  "Do you think it's Moriarty?"
Sherlock glares at him.  "Exactly."  He's not amused.  John hands him the whiskey tumbler as a peace offering, and Sherlock hesitantly accepts it.
The sheets are wet from his sweat. He has to take several deep breaths before he can move. He sits up. His heart is still beating hard, but he has to do something to get rid of the images that linger in his mind, so he gets out of the bed. He stumbles to the nursery to check on Rosie, only to find her fast asleep. He must have dreamed her cry intermingling with his own.
John signs them in and laughs rather oddly at something the young man says.  He grabs the key and is quick down the stairs.  Sherlock comes after, feeling his sore muscles ache with every step on the way down.  Their room is located on the souterrain floor of an extension at the back of the building, facing the garden and the sea.
“I really thought that was it. What I truly wanted. And having a baby was just a- a very surprising bonus.”
Sherlock feels like a heavy weight has lifted from his chest.  He feels less like a caged lion.  This changes everything.  There are possibilities now.  Endless possibilities and dangers.
Sherlock has always immensely enjoyed John being authoritative, exuding power and not accepting any bullshit regardless of his short stature. He was thrilled by their snog, by John showing dominating tendencies in that situation. There’s clearly a potential for sexual compatibility there. But he can’t know for sure, can’t know how far John would be willing to go.
He swallows, letting his fingertips stroke the rough denim on his thigh. Ella waits for him to get his voice back.
Sherlock's face is a study in boredom, to the point of not even bothering to keep his eyes open. He sighs.  "Women are your department, John.  I'll trust your word regarding her female qualities."
"That would be a too generous interpretation, I'm afraid.  John!"  Sherlock dangles a vinyl glove.  "Just look at this!"  he muses, indicating the charred pile, while John helps him to pull the glove on.  "This is
"Are we even yet? So you can fucking let it go and not give me pathetic, wounded eyes for something that
On John's insistence, they head for the Marina, although his calves and arse must be burning at this point.  At least Sherlock's are.  Luckily, they find a paved walkway along the small scale railway dividing the beach from the road beneath the cliff.
With Mrs Hudson’s blessings and delight they had fixed big pots and raised beds in the back just outside her patio door.
“Hydrate,” says John, opening a bottle and pushing it into Sherlock’s hands. He obliges without protest.
The rest of the day isn’t any better. He’s restless and jumpy, avoids his colleagues during lunch break.
They both stare into the dancing flames, quiet, until John's stomach makes itself known again, so loud that Sherlock's gaze drifts from the fire.
John was used to correcting her, for her own protection, make her less intimidating to narrow minds. Harry didn’t care if he made excuses for her or not, that it was his problem, not hers.
John invites Harry to Baker Street for Christmas. It’s very informal. Only the usual fairy lights and some tinsel. Sherlock had actually wanted to get a tree, for once, and hadn't hidden his disappointment when John vetoed the idea as far too hazardous with a small, bright, inquisitive person apparently bent on self-destruction in the flat.
John is happy he went on the case. It’s brought them slightly closer to normalising their relationship.
He bangs his hand against the armrest in time with enumerating all the horrible things he’s done. “I never forgave Sherlock either, but I told him I did. I didn’t
The only thing he blames Sherlock for, is not seeing through Mary’s facade. Why hadn’t he seen it from the start? Why hadn’t he revealed her until after she had revealed herself? When John failed to see it, when he was duped, why couldn’t Sherlock have seen? And done something about it. Sparing them so much more sorrow.
“I’m high,” he smiles. “Pheromones, endorphin, oxytocin. It’s simple chemistry, but a great, natural cocktail.”
That's when Mary came into his life. He was indebted to her. He should be thankful that someone loved him, saw him at his worst and didn't pity him or find him repulsive.
"Uh, didn't really think about it, I was kind of more focused on getting you out of her way," says John.  "But then again, it's the same as with Brian--what would she gain from anonymously threatening her landlady, or killing her supposed friend?"
"I saw you speaking to Miss Cushing's sister just outside, when she came to pick her up," says John.
"Just leave your coat off and we'll be fine.  No-one ever recognises me anyway."  John gives him a self-deprecating smile.  "I guess I'm too bland."
Logic can't always beat a feeling, but he'll try. He will be confronting headlong one of his greatest fears: being undressed with an attractive man - sober.
, acting like it was all a bloody joke. We were thrown out. Then I jumped him in a café. He’d treated me like shit, letting a whole bunch of people know that he was alive, but kept me in the dark, as if
Holding him down, spreading him out - it has always been part of John’s sexual fantasies about Sherlock. In his dreams he’s created situations that would allow it. He’s not sure
"Tell me, Sherlock," John says, almost pleading.  "Will you keep playing along in Moriarty's games?"
“The whole game is based on the child’s inability to understand that things you can’t see still exists. It’s only surprising to them until they’ve developed object permanence.”
"There was no time to go through anything properly," Sherlock complains.  "I just snapped pictures as fast as I could."
Miss Cushing pats Sherlock's knee  "You see, that's why I went looking for him in the first place.  He didn't bring me the mail and the paper this morning. He's always home in the morning and usually only goes out in the afternoon.  He likes long walks, but always returns no later than sunset.  Some days he only pops by to bring me some garden flowers."  She sighs.  "He's a really lovely and thoughtful young man."
says Sherlock, pain written all over his face, and it wasn’t supposed to be like this. John’s words were not meant to hurt.
“Weaning is a gradual process, you can’t just full on stop without complications. It can take weeks, months, even years to complete.”
This is cheating; John touches what he observes, distracting him.  He lets his fingertips follow the flush, trailing down along Sherlock's neck, eliciting a shudder.  Then he changes the angle of his finger, making the edge of his nail slowly make an imprint on it's way downward.  All the way to Sherlock's collarbone, effectively stealing his focus.
“Yes,” Sherlock says, releasing John’s hand and sitting back again. “You go first. There’s something in my pocket I need to be released from first.”
Lestrade actually looks sheepish.  "Yeah, I wanted you to have a look first.  But, his team continues on from here."  He lays a placating hand on Sherlock's shoulder.   "You know I'm eager to hear your observations."
“You didn’t know? How could you not know? Why do you think Dad hated me coming here? In his head, it was indoctrination.”
John softly traces the shape of his mouth, from the cupid’s bow downward, letting his thumb catch on the lower lip, feeling the heat of the moist inside.
John is high on his own capability after the last years of feeling like a pawn in a game of chess, without any authority of himself. Things just
“Did you take a sample?” John chuckles. “Did you bring my spunk into our kitchen to examine under your microscope?
"Yes, fair enough," Sherlock accepts, the corners of his mouth tugging up into an unstoppable smile.
"He really wants to make sure you know he's dealing with The Case of the Missing Sea View," John tells Sherlock under his breath.
on the other hand, the bricks have been removed, but when they put them back someone used Portland cement instead. It’s cheaper, but it doesn’t bond well with the lime mortar and it’s also impermeable to water. So it can trap moisture behind the bricks causing frost cracks. Or, like in this case, the moisture can’t evaporate through the cement mortar, so it’s pressed out through the brick, bringing lime and salt with it, creating this white spotty pattern.”
Though Sherlock is laid back, eyes closed and the picture of contentment, John is anything but. He’s trying to calm his mind, to match the state of his body, but it’s not working.
John knows he can't keep avoiding this part of himself, keep dousing himself with liquor before he has the guts to come near another man in that way. He needs to break the habit, to soldier through. He needs to change his thought patterns, and with time creating new neural pathways in his brain. He wants to be able to live a life that's more than endurance.
"First responders confirmed his death, but the cause is unknown for now, though there's no obvious signs of foul play.  They only had a quick look.  It was the landlady's claims of threats preceding his death, and his odd state of undress, that warranted a forensics team."  He checks his watch and frowns.  "Which will arrive any minute now."
The pubic hair resembles dark moss covered in dew, small and tightly coiled. John can slowly rake his fingers through it and relishes when Sherlock trembles, the mix of sweat and condensation covering his body gleaming in the low light. John cups Sherlock’s balls and leans in, licking up his neck.
Their meandering finally brings them to the Royal Pavilion, residing in a Regency-style garden, providing a green haven in the city center.  The buildings give off fairytale vibes with their fantastic take on oriental inspired pointed arches, onion domes and minaret-like towers.  In the garden behind the museum, Sherlock notices a few stalks of pink hollyhocks, still blooming in the sunny patches of the flowerbeds.  He recognises the familiar flittering of orange among them;
The spa program folder is peppered with oriental names alluding to spices, sultans and hammams. It makes a promise of treating their bodies with the most luxurious soaps and oils known to man. This is a very special occasion, so John really hopes it will be worth the splurge. It should be enough, just having a relaxing day off, him and Sherlock, but he’s still nervous about the outcome.
"Yeah, it's not easy to give you praise, 'cause there's a fine line between you being chuffed or insulted."
On the tip of a horn on the bison skull? No, it’ll catch his attention and make him fret until John’s observation skills improve. Indeterminate waiting.
They smile at each other. The calmness lingers. John turns and lies on his side, facing Sherlock. He wonders if Sherlock’s cheek is as smooth as his own after the barber session. Though Sherlock embraced him just a while ago, he doesn’t dare to reach out a hand to find out.
"You were only supposed to buy us lunch."  Sherlock studies him with narrowed eyes.  "What made you pick up all this stuff?  Were you planning to offer me a shave even before I hurt my hand?"
“I’d rather taste you,” says John, reaching for Sherlock’s face, bringing them together in a deep kiss. He’s used to this now. A bit of public snogging. It’s their favourite pastime in Regent’s Park.
He manages to sneak around the corner just a few seconds before John.  He must have been slowed down while trying to identify the non-existent perpetrator in the crowd.  When John rounds the corner, Sherlock is quick to grab his arm.  "Down!" he hisses, crouching and pulling John down with him beside a bench.
Rosie is warm and tired, her weight increasing as her eyes droop. There’s no use to start up a bedtime story, she’ll fall asleep in minutes. He sits down in the comfy armchair, where he’s been sitting so often, watching her. He’s fallen asleep in that chair more times than he can remember. But contrary to his usual routine, he doesn’t put her to bed, instead he lets her slumber in his arms.
Sherlock is still. As still as he can be while his mind is actively processing. John quietly regards his poised body, still alive with fervid energy; he can almost literally see the cogs and gears turn and whirr in Sherlock’s head. Several minutes tick by in silence.
"John, there's white lilies and roses. The blooming would be over weeks ago, but I'm positive those are lily stalks."
“The sycamore tree behind Mrs Turner’s. The one with the snot green hanging flower heads. The one that spreads an annoying stickiness over everything in the back. It creates copious amounts of pollen for the bees!”
John starts chuckling, which progresses to him doubling over, laughing until he has tears in his eyes.  A bit of an overreaction, probably caused by the last days' emotional turmoil.  When he manages to gather himself, he has one very pressing question.  Sherlock might have been wrong, but he's rarely totally wrong.
John starts crying then. Sherlock gets a stubborn lump in his throat when he sees the tears in John’s eyes, his own starting to fill in sympathy.
He came up with a spreadsheet enumerating different sounds and what they meant, tied to an infant’s basic needs. John asked how he could know all this. Sherlock simply shrugged.
"Bloody hell, Sherlock!  You did it again."  John gets up off the bench and walks away a few steps to put some distance between himself and Sherlock.  He kicks some gravel, finds it ridiculous, and turns around, raking his fingers through his hair.  "Why the fuck didn't you tell me you were expecting to meet Moriarty here tonight?  What the hell were you thinking?  Thank God, you were wrong!"
Not anything like the things he’d needed to tell Sherlock, but important ones. That’s why she haunts him, like Sherlock did.
"Oh."  John rises, brushing off his knees.  "Right. Gardening tools, white lilies, homemade pickles--I'm sensing a pattern, here."
John’s heart beats so fast it feels like it’s going to jump out of his chest. This is it. This is where he has a chance to stop being a coward.
It is a fairly new parameter to Sherlock's constantly revised decision to help keep up the appearance that he and John are nothing more than mates.  That's why he will soon pretend that John wasn't sleeping with his cheek resting on Sherlock's shoulder, when he eventually wakes up.
There's a sound of footsteps on the gravelled pathway between the lots.  John stares at Sherlock, not really believing what's happening.  When the footsteps come to a stop, John's hand reflexively goes towards his lower back, where he usually keeps his gun in situations like this.  But, of course, the SIG-Sauer is at 221B.
“Please.” He tugs again, firmly, and Sherlock’s legs untangle and he slides off the desk with a huff, slightly imbalanced. John tugs again, getting Sherlock away from the desk. He’s bloody stunning, as always, and in this incredible moment, possibly slightly less unattainable.
The first drag since they stepped onto the train in East Croydon is marvellous, and just what he needs to handle this increasingly messy situation.  He closes his eyes briefly, indulging in the rush of nicotine.  He then blows out the smoke towards the ceiling, avoiding John's face, which is very close to his own.
A moan escapes him when Sherlock puts his lips to the scar. John’s mind fills with images of someone coming in, interrupting them - seeing. But this feels so right, not wrong, perverted and forbidden. There’s no hurried panic.
It's a seemingly ordinary garden shed: old and somewhat rickety, in a clear state of disrepair, on the verge of decay, with greenery growing in through cracks in the floor and along the back wall.  A workbench beneath a tiny window holds ordinary gardening tools, presenting an array of potential murder weapons.  Plenty signs of wear, though no traces of current use.  There's dust all over, undisturbed, which in itself is a story.  Dust, or lack thereof, reveals multitudes.  Marks on the floor shows that the chair has been repeatedly dragged across the floor between the door and the workbench, in search of daylight.  A closer look at the legs of the chair makes it clear that the dragging motion was done a long time ago, as the coloration of the scratch marks on the wood has darkened with age.  In a corner are yellowed, pulverised traces of ether-based polyurethane, degraded.  No inner ceiling, low roof, rusty nails on the wooden beams.  Traces of textile, brown and orange, that he suspects came from foam-filled seat pads for garden chairs which have been stored for winter, lying across the narrow beams.  It looks as if they've snagged on a nail when taken down.  No signs of such seat pads in the garden.  Probably from the 60's or 70's by the garish colour scheme.  Most likely unrelated.  Except for an older manual push mower in the corner beside the door, with dried grass-clippings beneath it, there's nothing else that shows that the shed's been utilised in months.
"Yes, you should have," says Sherlock, trying hard to keep a smile from his face.  "Ouch!"  He feels pain near the base of his thumb, as John manipulates it.
John's warm fingers drift back up to his cheek, then to this mouth.  "Swollen lips... "  A fingertip barely breaching the opening of his lips, but the association is obvious, the reaction instant.  "Increased blood flow."
Lestrade purses his lips, shifting his weight, arms across his chest.  "Uh, yeah, I'll have a word.  First responders said they hadn't disturbed anything."
She shrugs. “It was all for the better. That was my last stint. In a proper facility. Like the one you paid for, once.”
“The last time we met you talked about how you’d beat and kicked Sherlock and the resulting physical damage. Would you agree with me if I said that you sometimes have trouble controlling your anger?”
Sherlock puts his hand flat against the exit scar. He leans down to see it up close, letting his hand slide slowly downwards until only his digits touch the scar.
Every word she says with her dying breath cuts through him. He just wants her to shut up because it isn’t true.
"No, no," she shakes her head.  "I'm not suffering from dementia, as my sister would have me believe.  At least not yet. I might be a little scatterbrained, but I am still perfectly capable of distinguishing between flowers.  Brian used to bring me small garden flowers he'd picked.  Now, the funeral flowers were something else.  It was a bouquet left in a plastic bag, hanging from the front door handle, one afternoon.  White calla lilies and roses, though it was only rose stems.  The rose flowers had been cut off, like a
When John has finished the bandaging, he pinches the nail on Sherlock's thumb to check the circulation, before he secures the end of the bandage at the wrist.  "Sadly, there'll be no violins or guns for you the next four to six weeks."
John puts his phone away.  "You got that?  Moriarty couldn't have done it himself.  I know he has minions, but they couldn't have picked the lilies from Brians' lot, since they'd been past their season by then.  You said it yourself, the flowers had wilted."
"Yeah.  Apparently it's an edible weed.  She said her in-laws had served it like rhubarb pie, so she's familiar with how it looks when it's been chopped and heated."
Harry had usually been skint. John had saved up as much as he could during his junior doctor years, and somehow Harry at one point had accepted it. Since they left home, they’d always had a frail relationship, switching between hostility, estrangement and jolly friendship. It was as though the stress at home had kept them united, and when they were free from it, they didn’t know what they were to each other anymore.
Why did you think I stayed here as much as I could throughout my teenage years? Why do you think I ever dared to come out? Couldn’t have done it without her, not before I moved out for real.”
John had failed him when he was at his lowest, but at least now he can try to make up for some of it by babysitting the addict. It’s the stitches in Sherlock’s eyebrow that keep catching his attention. A glaring reminder of what he’s done, what limits he’s overstepped. He shouldn’t be around Sherlock.
John falters. He’s distracted by Sherlock’s feet still resting on his thighs, thankfully not sliding further up.
John is leaning against the doorframe. Sherlock is reminded of the shoelaces and turns to the deceased.
His eyes prickle with tears. It’s a recurring thing, these days. He breathes out shakily, swallows down the lump in his throat. Ella waits patiently. He pinches his thigh, trying to divert his attention away from the pain in his chest.
Sherlock shows John the text message.  "The garden shed at Miss Cushing's has burned during the night."
Ella seems to have an efficient radar at picking up on his unease. He manages to actually tell it like it is, that it really scared him, that following right behind Sherlock was almost not enough. That he had to pull him up, from where he was hanging onto the scaffolding, dangling three floors above the ground. That it was a close call.
behind him. He sat at the edge of the tub and counted the cracks in the tile. There was not a single thought or memory that could fill the hollowness in his chest. Every positive memory was tainted with the echo of “freak.” It reverberated in his head and grated the inside of his skull. He squeezed his head, trying his best to physically snuff the word out, but he knew better. It would never work of course. He wasn’t an idiot.
“What was your task?” John’s question startled him. He had expected John to just sit quietly and take everything Sherlock said with a grain of salt, but again, he took him by surprise.
“I am in a very big hurry, Mrs. Hudson, and I do not have time to listen to your ramblings.” Sherlock flew up the stairs without John.
“Sherlock Holmes,” she sighed, lips pulling up in an admiring smile. “He’s just brilliant.” John eyed her.
“That’s true, innit,” he smiled. Sherlock didn’t take his eyes off him. “But he wasn’t a very nice man.” Satisfied with John’s answers, Sherlock finally nodded in agreement, still watching him from the corner of his eye.
John’s cock twitched in his jeans. He swallowed hard and kept his eyes forward. “How about a shower first?”
Sherlock was sure of most things. His feelings for John were one of them, and despite the kind touches John gives him, all he can see is the soldier with Sherlock's blood on his hands. He wants to forgive him, but he cannot do it alone.
Sherlock stood over the coffee table and shoveled biscuits and mini fruit tarts into his mouth. He coughed at the dryness in the back of his throat. A ringing started in his ears and distracted him from eating.
“I was just bringing your cold case files, that I would have solved sooner had I not been so preoccupied with these tedious arguments with John. I did not come here to chat about my private life like wealthy old women.”
Sherlock yanked himself out of thought when a surge of electricity ran down his spine. He tightened his coat around himself to keep John from noticing the interest from his crotch. John was leaning against the wall by the doors, switching his weight onto his good leg.
Case after case, running after suspects, Sherlock’s coat flapping behind him, he had never felt so alive. Some days were more difficult than the others; the lows after a case outlasted the highs. While Sherlock slept after a case, John laid in bed, wrapped in his sheets, and stared at the side wall for hours on end until he went downstairs to scald his tongue on tea. That’s when his Sig’s call would gain strength. He would stare at the bedside drawer that held it from his doorway. It had a life of its own.
His eyes were already feeling heavy when he reached for a tissue on his nightstand and wiped himself clean. John’s dreamless sleep melded into one of gunshots and disturbingly bright blue eyes.
The therapists start their treatment with a rather intense full body scrub down with a traditional coarse exfoliating glove, where a mass of dead skin cells are released. John feels like his skin is burning, but it soon fades with the endorphin release.
