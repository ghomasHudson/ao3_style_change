Cas drives them out to Bobby’s old cabin in the woods, almost three hours from where they live. It’s Dean’s favorite place in the world and he knows this. He knows it isn’t a cure-all, but just the look on his face as they pull into the familiar, crumbling driveway makes the whole trip worth it. They get together their fishing gear and spend some time on the lake. They talk, really talk for the first time in weeks, as they lazily cast their lines out. Cas reassures Dean just how far he’s come since they first met, and that he doesn’t want to see him give up. Dean does his best to find the words to explain that what he’s feeling has nothing to do with the other man and everything to do with himself. It is in no way Castiel’s fault- he’s been doing everything he can for Dean and he should not feel guilty. Cas reminds him that he shouldn’t feel guilty either. He has been through what only few people in the world go through and survive.
I didn't really like the last chapter I posted, so I hope this one was better. It's a little short because my computer is broken, and long story short I'm typing this on my Dad's computer, directly on the site, so I have no idea how many words it is.
"I think I need therapy. Or something..." Dean finally spits it out, leaning against the doorframe. His family looks at him in surprise.
I know this chapter was a little bit random, and also kind of short, but I really just wanted to start writing and posting again to get back into thr swing of things. I hope you guys enjoyed it anyway ! And I hope my smut was at least halfway decent.
Get up. Shower. Eat. Talk to mom. Talk to Sam. Go on a walk. Listen to music. Text Cas. Go to the store. Eat dinner. Watch tv. Go to bed. Repeat.
“How did we meet ?”
Cas calls Sam, and they book  plane tickets together. They fly out in a couple of hours. Cas is a nervous wreck the whole flight, but he can tell Sam is trying to stay calm. They land in the late evening, and take a cab to the hospital. Sam does all the talking at the front desk, because Cas is unable to form coherent sentences at the moment. The receptionist tells them that the doctor is waiting to speak with them. Dr. Barnes pulls them into her office, and gently starts explaining things.
"We're engaged." Dean pipes up. Which is technically true. They're going to the courthouse for the papers, and then later on down the road they have decided to have an actual wedding to celebrate with their friends and family.
“I’m fine, just nervous I think.” His stomach seems to twist even as he’s speaking. The thought of eating could not be less appealing to him, but he simply can’t pass up this night. It’s too important to Dean, and to their relationship. He takes a step forward and doubles over.
“I don’t want to see some shrink.”
Dean nods, but in his head he thinks “No. It was real.”
Castiel has never made love like this. Has never ‘made love’, period. He knows this now, after years of being in an almost exclusive sexually-based relationship. Bal asked and received, while Castiel was more of just a pawn. Now, being here with Dean, the most kind, selfless, /beautiful/ man he has ever known, the sexual experience is a thousand times more magnified. He feels every thrust, every kiss, every touch fueled by his boyfriend’s love like he’s on an intense ecstasy trip. His orgasm sneaks up on him, his grip slipping on Dean’s sweaty shoulders. He switches to gripping his dirty-blonde hair instead, ripping a primal sound out of him that tips Castiel over the edge and has him spilling his release between them. Dean follows not thirty seconds after, emptying himself into the condom.
"That's good news Dean, I think it could be very beneficial for both you and your family." Cas is secretly relieved, he had been becoming increasingly worried about Dean's state of well-being. "I miss you. I'll come see you soon."
A few hours later, Cas is gathered in a room with only a small group of people- all the same people that have treated Dean since he’s arrived. There’s Henrikson of course, then a kindly nurse named Missouri, an amicable nurse named Pamela, an older resident Benny, and then Dr. Balthazar Milton, who is currently speaking. “We are moving Dean from ER to ICU, but unlike normal treatment, we are going to keep all of you on call for his care. There will be no switching shifts or rotations until he is given a clean bill of health and released. None of us can imagine what he’s been through, and we want to make it as easy as possible on him. No surprises, no more unfamiliar faces. Thank you, you may all go.”
The whole ordeal makes Dean nervous to go out in public again, something he’d thought he’d gotten past months ago. But he fears seeing something or someone that will set him off again- bring back the panic attacks and nightmares. He continues with his therapy but refuses to talk more about what actually happened, instead choosing to talk about his own thoughts and feelings.
Cas and Sam silently agree to let Mary be the first to see Dean. The two men sit outside the room in a couple of chairs while she spends some time with her first-born child. About thirty minutes later, a group of people rounds the corner and heads straight for them. Sam obviously recognizes them, because he stands immediately. Castiel stands too, assuming that they are the members of Dean’s extended family he’s heard so much about.
“Dean, don't be a jerk, it’s not like he
They both fall into an intense kiss, teeth gnashing and tongues colliding. Harsh pants fall from both of them, warming the air in between them. Cas starts to grind up against Dean as well, both of their erections straining.
Dean nods.
“Don’t…don’t apologize. I’m not sorry.” Cas says. “I could never be sorry for…that.” He reaches out to stroke Dean’s arm soothingly. “It’s okay.”
There will be one more chapter- the big wedding of course ! It will most likely be a shorter chapter but I wanted to include it to finish out the story.
“Hey, Dean ?”
She smiles kindly. "Well, from the looks of it, the house is perfect for a young child to grow up in. And the two of you seem fit to take care of one. I wish it were that simple, but there's still a long process you two-or should I say you three- will have to go through." Ms. Barnes stands up, shuffling her papers. "You already know that you must be married. There are a few other technicalities. In the state of Kansas, leaving a child without provision for their identification for a period of thirty days is considered abandonment. We've covered that. This means that the little cutie will need a name. Think about it. I'll be in touch." She shakes both of their hands and waves to the little boy.
“Adopted.” Gabriel answers Dean’s unspoken question. “We all were.” That, Dean had not known. However, he did know that Castiel had four other siblings, himself being the youngest. The two go back inside to wait with Sam, making small talk until Cas’ doctor comes out to speak with them.
Dean and Castiel talk about the semantics of it, in the event that they could actually make this happen. Dean can start working from home more often, and Castiel can hire employees to help out with his store. Sometimes he can even take the baby with him. They can convert the guest bedroom into a nursery for the boy.
Dean snorts “Excuse me ? We fight for the freedom of our country. We fight for the men next to us, we fight to last another day so that we’re that much closer to getting back to our own families. We don’t fight to kill, we fight for the right to life. For all those people that the Afghans killed in 9/11, in our country. Innocent people who didn’t deserve to die. Afghanistan waged war on us, not the other way around. America is the land of the free and the home of the brave, and I’ll be damned if it doesn’t stay that way.”
“How did you become an angel?” “I didn’t become one, Dean, I was created as such.”
“What…what was it like ? What was it like being with Alistair ?” Cas knows he shouldn’t bring it up, especially when they’re having a nice evening, but his curiosity has been killing him. He believes that the next step in their relationship is to break this iceberg once and for all. He needs to understand Dean better.
“Bernice.” Cas tells him seriously. He cracks a smile at Dean’s answering face of surprise. “Your car?”
That’s just what he’s doing now, as Cas goes down for his coffee break. He walks up beside him.
Dean doesn’t know what comes over him, but seemingly without permission he hears his own voice saying “You know what? I can fix it for you. No problem at all.” “You’re a mechanic?” The man asks, head tilting slightly to the side. “Well….no.” Dean admits. “But I grew up around a few. Learned a lot over the years.” He is already assessing what tools he will need mentally, eyes raking over the Continental. “You would do that for me?” The man sounds hopeful, and it finalizes Dean’s decision.
“That’s quite alright…just take me to Dean.” Mary leads him upstairs, to the last door on the left. He knocks on it “Dean ? It’s Dr. Novak, I came to see you.”
They pull up to Cas’ place, and he wipes his sweaty palms on his pants. “You could come in, you know. If you wanted. If Sam isn’t waiting for you…”
He knits practically day and night, scrapping four pieces before he starts to get it right. The loops are sometimes lopsided or sloppy, but he thinks it looks pretty damn good. He sews the patch on last, with careful, hidden stitches. He wraps it in silver paper and ties it with a red bow. He finishes it four days before Christmas day.
Nothing could have prepared either man for what-or who- was on the other side.
“I’m sorry.” Cas whispers. It’s all he can think to say. He gently pries Dean’s fingers from his hair, and sits right next to him. “You’re safe, right now. You’re safe with me.” Cas doesn’t care about how many boundaries he’s pushing when Dean buries his face in his neck, clinging to him like it’s all he has left.
Cas pokes Dean’s side. “Deeeeaaann. Tell me.” He resorts to tickling him when he refuses to answer.
Cas couldn’t be more grateful that his boyfriend is healthy now, but he shamefully struggles internally with something akin to PTSD. He gets nightmares about that day, watching the men torment Dean over and over again when his eyes are closed. He hides it well from his lover, the occasional bouts of anxiety when Dean leaves his sight…His shame is /so/ strong, he has no right to feel this way when the other man was the one who was actually attacked. He is wiping at his eyes one day while he washes dishes, so lost in thought that he doesn’t hear the other man approach him from behind.
Dean fights a smile, and curls up against his side.
“You look great, babe.” Dean tells him, kissing him softly.
His scream echoes through the forest.
“Uh…can I come in ?” He asks nervously, looking at Cas.
Sorry I haven't updated sooner, I meant to update yesterday but then some stuff happened. Anyway, this is really fluffy, so enjoy.
“He doesn’t know?” Sam balks. “Where does he think you are?”
“Thank you, I’ll uh, see you next week.” Dean gives an awkward wave as he exits the room.
Cas laughs a little and jogs to keep up with him. “Dean, you can slow down a little you know.” He observes Dean for a moment. “Dean ?” He’s slowing up, but he’s also swaying slightly. Cas is at his side immediately, supporting one side of him. “Wanna take the wheelchair back, bud ?” Dean’s fingers grip the sleeve of his lab coat for only a moment before they lose pressure. He slumps against Cas, his knees buckling. “Dean ?!” Cas asks in alarm, going down with him, holding him to his chest. The IV rips out in the process, and blood starts flowing from his forearm. “I need some help !” Castiel calls out desperately. He looks down at Dean, whose eyes are closed. Somehow, he passed out, even though Pam said Dr. Milton cleared him…
“Uh..hi?” It doesn’t register with Dean at first, his mind is too cluttered. Sam looks between both of them, as if waiting for them to clue him in. Dean stands up suddenly.
“Goodbye.” Cas spits out.
He watches Dean pace for a minute, before sitting down and leaning against the bed. “Make it stop.” He pleads.
He sings softly to ‘Smoke on the Water’ while wiping his hands on a rag. “Well, Cas, she’s all set for today.” He looks at him for a moment. “Dude, are you drunk?” Castiel’s eyes are slightly glossy and his cheeks are tinted red. Dean chuckles a little.
Cas can’t imagine what Dean must be feeling; all the things he must have felt throughout his capture, and all the things after. As he watches over Dean as he sleeps, he wishes that Dean could be as peaceful as he looks. What did such a gentle soul do to deserve everything he’s been put through ? Then again, Cas could probably say the same about everyone in the hospital.
“You were listed under Dean Winchester’s emergency contact list. He was injured in Afghanistan. He’s being flown back to the states.”
Henrikson enters the room and washes his hands. “Hello Dean, how are you ?” They exchange the proper greetings and Henrikson starts his physical exam. He takes Dean’s vital signs, checks his reflexes and hearing. “Everything looks good so far. Could you remove your gown please ?” Dean hates this part- the part where he has to have his scars assessed. The majority of them have faded as much as they can, but the few prominent ones are still big reminders for Dean. He squeezes his eyes shut as Victor pokes and prods his back. “They’re looking good, healing quite nicely.” He clears Dean to be physically fit and dismisses him to the waiting room.
Dean stays the night at Cas’ apartment for the first time that winter. He goes over after Cas gets home from work and they have a night in- a nice dinner by the fireplace and a movie. They start off with slow kissing, and then things get more heated. So far they haven’t done too much in the way of sexual encounters, because of Dean’s self image issues.
“No, not exactly….I don’t know what’s wrong, and he won’t go to the hospital. Could you…this is a lot to ask, but could you come over ? I think he’ll listen to you, and….please help me.” Mary sounds desperate.
“I know what you mean.” Cas murmurs. “I’m tired of talking about all the wrongs we have to right. And I just want to have one conversation that doesn’t involve the advice of ‘praying about it.’ I don’t even know if I believe in God…” Cas admits quietly. “I believe in my cause, but I don’t know if I buy into the whole divine power thing. Maybe that comes with seeing the way things are out here….” He glances over at Dean for a brief moment. “I’m scared to even mention that I’m homosexual around my group- they’re all so God-driven that I’m afraid I’ll be shunned. My best friend of eight years doesn’t even know that I’m gay….” Cas doesn’t even know where that confession came from, but it just seemed like the type of ‘real’ thing that Dean was referring to.
She types on her computer for a moment. “Room 206, just down the hall and to your right.”
He laid Cas underneath him, slowly pulling his boxer briefs off, kissing down his legs as he did so. He teased and sucked his way down Cas’ chest, licking over his nipples andnibbling on his collarbone. Dean nipped at Cas’ hips, and dipped his tongue into his belly button. He teased until he couldn’t stand it anymore, and then he lubed his fingers up and slowly slid one into Cas, watching his face as he worked him open. He was gentle and sweet, taking his time with Cas, like he was fragile. When he felt like Cas was prepped enough, he let him lube his cock up and kissed him deeply. He pushed into him an inch at a time, until he was fully sheathed and Cas was begging him to move. He placed his hands on either side of Cas and slowly rolled his hips, pushing in and out. Cas raked his nails down Dean’s back and nipped at his jaw, enjoying the noises he was making. Cas is so beautiful to him, especially now, and he feels like he can never let this go. Dean increased his pace, and they both chased their orgasms in a maze of heat and whispered curses.  Dean watched Cas’ face as he came and he thought he had never seen anything more beautiful.
December, 2002
“Okay.” Cas agrees, and gives him a fond smile in return.
“There’s nothing you can think of that would lead him to believe that therapy would be beneficial to you ?” Garth is choosing his words carefully. It can be easy to upset patients, especially if this is their first time here.
Dean has a very strange dream that night- it starts off as a nightmare, with him being ripped apart in Hell. But the scene starts to change, and the flames burning around him begin to extinguish, and in their place, a soft blue swirling light replaces the harsh orange. Someone grabs his hand, and it looks to be an angel, its wings blackened by the fire. He pulls Dean out of Hell, the air getting fresher by the moment, and the heat and pain receding. Just before they’re about to break free, Dean catches a glimpse of the angels bright blue eyes.
“I have a question.” Dean says to him, about five days later.
“Dean.” Cas practically breathes. He’s frozen for a moment before his training kicks in. “How are you feeling ?”
Cas feels like the wind is knocked out of him. He vaguely feels Sam’s hand on his shoulder “C’mon Cas, let’s go see him.” He stands up, feeling numb, and follows Dr. Barnes to Dean’s room- 302. She knocks on it, “Dean, you have some visitors.”
Up one night with the baby at 1am, Dean brings him into he and Castiel’s bedroom. Cas is sitting up waiting for him. “Cas, I..I want to keep him.” Dean confesses desperately. “I want this little boy.” His boyfriend gives him a sad smile. “I don’t know if that’s possible. In the future, we can adopt.” He tells him, his supposed-to-be-hopeful tone falling flat even in his own ears. He knows what Dean means, what he is feeling, because he’s feeling the same way. They both want /this/ little boy, not just any kid from an adoption agency. This little boy is special, a gift for them from some unknown being.
He waves to Missouri as he passes by, and she stops to whistle at him. “Boy, look at you go.”
Cas is waiting in the parking lot in the car. He’d stayed in case Dean needed him. When Dean climbs into the shotgun seat, he tentatively asks “How’d it go ?”
Cas is ‘suspended’ for being unprofessional. Luckily, it’s only a two day suspension, but he still feels like he is not the doctor in the wrong. Supposedly a case of patient neglect was filed against Pam by John and Mary Winchester. Cas doesn’t really blame them, especially with all that Dean has been through. The worst part about Cas’ suspension isn’t even that he isn’t getting paid, it’s that he isn’t able to check up on his patients and see how they’re doing. The hospital is his life, and every person that he’s met there has impacted him somehow. So many lives he’s seen saved and lost, so many pieces shattered and put back together- but he wouldn’t want any other job.
The next time Cas pops up in Dean’s life is just a few weeks later. He’s ‘working’ near their base camp again. He actually scares the daylights out of Dean, when he appears seemingly out of nowhere. “Dean, it’s good to see a familiar face. Would you like some water ?”
“I was locked in that dark basement for the entire four years. No matter how much I screamed, begged, or cried, Alastair wouldn’t let me go. He would whip me, burn me, choke me, cut me, anything he could think of, just for fun. I thought I was going to die there…I had no idea what was going on when he left me alone for that month, but it was the worst of my life. I would starve, and pass out from dehydration… I had to eat old, moldy food he had left down there, and drink dirty water off the ground, that had leaked from the ceiling. That’s what I dream about the most.”
Cas is walking out of the bathroom when Dean speaks again. “I love you.”
In the morning, Cas saves Dean’s room for last when he does rounds. He meticulously checks his vitals and all the equipment, before inspecting his IV bag and trying to decide if he should switch it out. As he stands there contemplating, beside him a pair of jade green eyes flutter open. It takes Cas another minute to notice, and when he does, it’s a shock. Dean’s eyes are gorgeous, bright against his pale skin and peeking out from underneath long lashes- and not to mention, he’s awake.
Today, Castiel Novak was banished to what the staff refers to as ‘the pit’- aka, the emergency room. The interns detest emergency room time, because it seems to only be sprained ankles and stitches- they want the good stuff, the exciting surgeries and the trauma. This was one of those days that gave the pit its stereotype; quiet and uneventful, only full of sniffling children and elderly patients. That is, until a gurney is rushed in by frantic medics yelling vitals. It looked like a scene out of ‘Dr. Sexy, M.D’, all drama and excitement. Cas steps out of the way initially, but he’s one of the only interns in the ER today so he’s bound to get in on the action. He follows after the gurney and stands awkwardly in the doorway of the room, surveying the scene and trying to comprehend what’s happening.
“Don’t mention it…I’ve missed you. Things have been really busy at the hospital; wintertime is always a mess, with the icy roads, you know…” He trails off to chuckle at Dean, who is scarfing down his chocolate. “You’ve got some…Jeez Dean, you’re messy.” He brushes his thumb over the corner of his mouth, wiping the chocolate away. Dean’s tongue darts out to playfully lick his tongue, and Cas pulls away. “Gross !” They both start laughing, and Dean shakes his head.
Dean kicks the dead animal aside, but it’s already too late- it has triggered him. And he just keeps screaming.
“No, just try not to wake him, please. He’s been having trouble sleeping.” Mary says, sadness coloring her voice. “I suppose that’s to be expected though.” She sighs as she looks down at her son. “This is a miracle though, it really is. Angels were watching over him.”
John died while Dean was over in Afghanistan the first time he served. It was very hard for him, knowing that his father died alone, and he hadn’t been there to take care of him. He had flown back for the funeral, but took no extra time off. He just couldn’t face being home with all of his mourning relatives. It made him feel like a coward, and so he threw himself back into his duties overseas. Overall, it had been yet another devastating time for him. He’s just glad that now he’s past everything that happened, and he’s on to the good part of his life. He’s putting everything behind him now, in the best way.
“I’m so messed up. Everyone thinks I’m a freak now, too.” Dean says bitterly, looking out the car window. He had thought this kind of stuff was long over with.
The counseling sessions are tough, that he can’t deny. Sometimes they leave him with a tight chest or tears on his cheeks, but then he remembers bearing those feelings alone in a dark room and he’s grateful. He’s slowly sewing up the hole that Alistair left in him, even if the edges are still rough. Most of the blonde-haired man’s motivation comes from picturing the future. He pictures living with Cas without being a burden, being able to contribute to their shared life. Making dinner for Castiel when he gets off a late shift at the hospital, or setting an alarm to wake up early just for a kiss goodbye. He deserves better for his own sake, but so does his lover. Dean is determined to be the kind of guy Cas can be proud of dating.
“Cas!” Dean gasps, clutching at his arm. His boyfriend is bent over in pain, squeezing his eyes shut. Sam is already inside the restaurant, but Dean can’t be worried about that right now. “What’s wrong?” He asks, twice, but Cas doesn’t-or can’t- answer him.
Five Months to the Wedding
The Child Protective Services visit and interview the next week are nerve-wracking. Cas keeps smoothing down his over-gelled hair anxiously, while Dean holds the small boy on his hip and clings to him like a lifeline.
With that, Dean writes down one word- “Stay.”
I'm so sorry I haven't updated sooner ! I need to replace my laptop battery and my charger jack is messed up, so it was difficult to get it to work long enough for me to write.
“Follow the stream !” Dean calls back, his voice hoarse. He shrinks down, leaning against a tree. The blood makes him remember all the blood from the first time Alastair whipped him; how it ran down his back in rivulets, pooling on the floor beside him.
It takes Cas a few minutes to realize that Dean has spoken to him, and a few more to realize that he’s probably the first that Dean has spoken to since the whole ordeal. He feels a rush of pride, and then guilt because of the circumstance. He isn’t sure whether he should make a big deal out of Dean speaking, or if he should do exactly the opposite. One wrong move and it could upset Dean all over again, and that’s the last thing he wishes to do.
, and pretty much his whole month long stay in the hospital is him trying to get more accustomed to him. He feels bad about it, he knows that must be really hard for Cas.
She stops. “Thomas?”
Cas is sitting up in bed, with a cut on his forehead and his arm propped up until they can put a proper cast on it. “Dean, Dean, I’m fine, I’m okay. I can’t say the same for my car though.” He gives Dean a small smile.
“I would never. He’s a great guy, really great.” He says this with sincerity, none of the fake stumbling he would have given to the father of some girl he was with at the time.
“Cas ?”
“Yes we are.” Dean kisses him gently. “I just want you to know that I couldn’t have done any of this without you, so…thank you. I can’t really thank you enough. I’m kind of forever in your debt.” Dean grins softly.
“Bye Dean.” He says with a sad smile.
Dean learns a few new things about Castiel on their first official date- number one being he is terrible at mini golf. Despite this, they both have a great time, even if it takes longer than expected to get through the course. The second thing he learns is that Cas has not been out on a real date in almost four years. It’s been as long for Dean for a date with a man. He did go on a few dates with a woman named Lisa last year, but she ended up back with her ex for the sake of their kid together and that was the end of that. The third thing he learns surprises Dean- Cas is /funny./ He’s always been funny, to be fair, but when they’re in Dean’s garage he’s more reserved, it’s more of a quiet, ‘I’m not trying to be funny’ humor. But here, on the mini golf course, it seems like he is really letting loose and the more uninhibited side of him is appearing in front of Dean’s eyes.
“I gotta tell you, you’re not what I was expecting.” Dean isn’t rude when he says it, just commenting, as if elaborating on why he hadn’t recognized him earlier.
He blows him a kiss from the driveway, and looks away before he can see Cas cry.
to leave. It’s been two years since they’ve met, and he thinks he’s known that he loves Dean for a while. He just wants him to stay with him forever, so they can watch the stars, and read, and go on picnics and watch dumb movies and kiss all night long. He just wants Dean.
He sleeps on Dean’s side of the bed that night.
“But it’s possible?” Sam asks hopefully. Jodi nods, and they set to work on trying to gather the extensive paperwork they will need. Both agree not to mention it to anyone else, least of all Castiel and Dean, before they are positive.
“When Dean was in Afghanistan, a bomb went off near where his platoon was hiding. He
They get a lot of bad weather in the weeks that follow. January proves to be cold and snowy, just as the weathermen had predicted. But life doesn’t stop just for the frosty flakes, and Cas often finds himself driving to work in a near blizzard. This particular night is dark onyx, windy, icy, and snowing all at once, and it seems like Cas’ car is crawling along the road. The car in front of him turns on its hazard lights, so he moves into the next lane.
When they get home, Dean even asks Cas to watch a movie. They curl up together on the couch, with Cas in Dean’s arms. Dean keeps giving Cas gentle kisses anywhere and everywhere. He’s missed this and even though things are still hard, he’s going to keep pushing through. Sure he’s still in pain and struggling, but he can at least try.  After all the shit he’s been through, Cas has stuck by his side the whole time. And he refuses to let him down.
Dean shrugs, not meeting his eye. “Yeah, dad would take a hunt across the country and take us with him. When we were still too young to join, I’d watch Sam in whatever room we’d rented for that day. Now I cook for Sam and Bobby every night.”
He starts being more careful after that.
This is a little shorter than normal, I apologize. Anyway, we're finally gaining some headway into their actual relationship... (:
They both smile stupidly at each other for a moment, when Dean leans down, intent on Cas’ lips.
In all the ways Castiel imagined his walk going, this was not it. How many times had he wished for something interesting to happen in his life? It seems he got more than he bargained for.
“I mean, maybe not exactly…” Sam has mixed feelings- they are helping people, but it’s at their own expense. And the expense of their entire lives. There’s a large part of him that resents their father for dragging them into the life.
Cas feels tears in his own eyes, and he knows he’ll never forget the look on Dean’s face as he wrote that. He pulls him into a tight hug, rubbing the scars on his back. “You’re safe now, with me. He’s dead, he can’t hurt you anymore.”
Dean scrubs a hand over his face, bustling around the room to collect all his things. He’s not sure how he feels about going home- he’s waited for so long, but now the prospect of seeing his old life seems so scary. So many memories… Even just putting on his old clothes this morning seemed wrong, like he was trying to be past-Dean.  He sighs and sits down on his bed, waiting for the discharge papers to be taken care of. Cas enters the room to say goodbye.
“Are you alright?” He crouches and surveys the damage, wincing at the gashes welling blood between the fabric of his shredded shirt. He places a gentle hand on his shoulder.
“There’s this quote, that I read. It made me think of you.” Cas pulls a worn book from his backpack and opens to the book-marked page. “I have the deepest affection for intellectual conversations. The ability to just sit and talk. About love, about life, about anything, about everything. To sit under the moon with all the time in the world, the full-speed train that is our lives slowing to a crawl. Bound by no obligations, barred by no human limitations. To speak without regret or fear of consequence. To talk for hours and about what’s really important in life. “What can you ever really know of other people’s souls—of their temptations, their opportunities, their struggles? One soul in the whole creation you do know: and it is the only one whose fate is placed in your hands” Cas finishes, his deep voice trailing off at the end. “I want you to keep it, a real, touchable, personified version of us…”
“I had a great time, Dean.” He cringes immediately, that was the most cliché thing he could have possibly said, but Dean doesn’t seem to mind.
They spend some more time in Castiel’s room, just relaxing and getting their bearings after the hunt. It’s really nice, having friends over and not dealing with the usual loneliness and isolation. Cas feels grateful that he met the Winchesters.
This is just a job to Cas. Something he is quite literally forced to do. “He doesn’t actually give a crap about you, and if he does, it’s because Heaven told him to.” Dean’s ever-helpful internal monologue berates himself for being stupid enough to think that they had actually formed a real friendship.
“Your parents still aren’t home?” Dean looks at him for the first time that night. Cas shakes his head silently.
It takes John ten minutes to find Dean, who is sitting on the ground, soaking wet and covered in blood. He scoops him up in his arms like he’s a little kid again, and hurries back toward the house; no questions asked. Dean clings to him and cries into his shoulder, not caring that he’s twenty-one years old and he’s forcing his dad to carry him.
Dean lays flat on his back after that, staring at the ceiling. Benny sits on one side of his bed, a few feet away so as not to crowd him. Cas does the same, forgetting that he was supposed to be going home after a 36 hour shift. Castiel falls asleep, and is woken up by Benny about forty-five minutes later.
“Pamela !” He yells when he sees her. “What the hell do you think you’re doing ? Did you even look at what blood pressure you wrote down ?! 110 over  65 ! I took Dean out to walk because you told me that Milton cleared him, when he didn’t ! He passed out, and his IV ripped out, and now all of that unnecessary pain and extra recovery time is on you, all because you were too damn busy to tell someone that his blood pressure was too low !” Cas finishes in a huff, realizing that everyone in the hall has stopped to stare and listen.
"I'm getting therapy." Dean tells Cas on the phone. "I hope that it makes me better."
“I know it doesn’t seem like it, but you
“I agree.” Dean replies quietly. He shifts a little closer to him.
June, 2002
I wanted to touch base on Dean's past again....I hope everything makes sense and that you guys enjoyed it :)
“He saved me.” Cas reminds him.
Cas laughs “I guess we both did.”
He rubs Dean’s back with gentle hands, whispering calming things into his ear. He listens to his breathing regulate and his heart beat slow. “Everything is okay, he’s dead. And I’m not going to let anything happen to you.” He presses a gentle kiss to Dean’s forehead without thinking, and he realizes that Dean isn’t just a patient anymore. He’s much, much more than that.
Sam had texted Castiel earlier in the day to say he was sick and would not be at school today. Cas stares out the library window at the pelting rain, internally sighing. The walk home will be unpleasant at best, without a ride in the Impala to shield him from the rain.
“No, you worked hard to get where you are now.” Benny pipes in. “We’re proud of you, Dean.” He claps Dean on the shoulder and gives him a reassuring smile.
Cas runs into the room two minutes before midnight, and scooches onto a small cot next to Dean. Dean hands him a glass of sparkling apple juice, and they make a toast to a new beginning.
“You can see that from over here?” Castiel squeaks. His cheeks flare red and he hates that he feels embarrassed.
Dean loses consciousness about the time that the paramedics arrive. He heard the sirens, aware that he didn’t have to fight to stay awake anymore because he would be being treated by professionals who would take care of him. He vaguely knows that Cas is with him, and that he’s extremely worried, but the pain overwhelms him and he drifts off seamlessly.
Dean is so happy that he's able to do all of this with Cas- cherish him, take him out for a nice evening, make him feel like he's the only person in the world. He thanks God silently that he didn't make the wrong choice and commit suicide, and also that he wasn't killed in the war. There must be angels looking out for him, because he never thought he could have all this, that he could be this happy.
A few days after arriving home, Dean calls for his boyfriend in an unsure tone. “Yes Dean?” Castiel appears at his side in under a minute.
“Don’t hurt yourself !” Cas says, moving closer.
It’s now 6:30am, and the living room that Dean and Cas share is packed with people. Sheriff Mills is there, along with a few others from the police department and Dean’s younger brother. Mary and Gabriel have been instructed to give them some space until the police and Sam, the town’s resident lawyer, can figure this situation out. It seems as though the boys have told their story a hundred times by now- they woke up, heard crying, and then bam- a baby appeared.
Cas keeps busy by focusing on his work with Chuck, his best friend. They’ve been friends since high school, and they joined this missionary together in August of 2001. Chuck is eclectic and full of energy, a dedicated worker who he means so much to him. That’s why it’s so strange to Cas why he hasn’t mentioned Dean to him at all.
This is the type of thing the council is looking for: what can they fix within the creation of God that is Dean Winchester? Despite popular belief and misinterpretation, Castiel’s Father and the other inhabitants of Heaven are not against other sexualities that are not heterosexual. However, Dean’s own struggle to accept it is something that is of definite interest to Heaven.
Dean holds up a finger. He rifles around in the drawer next to his bed and pulls out a plastic bag filled with his possessions that he had with him overseas. It’s only a few things- a dirty piece of paper, a photograph, and his dog tags. “Is this it ?” He holds up the warn, frayed, and folded up piece of paper, handing it to Cas.
It’s mid-afternoon now, and almost too quiet for Dean’s liking. Not hearing the sound of Henrikson barking orders makes him uneasy. He stands up and patrols the border of the camp- it looks like everyone is crowded around in the middle of the tents and tanks. Dean jogs over to them. “Where did you get that ?” He asks Lafitte. Benny is holding a bottle of clean, pure water. Lafitte nods to the rather scrawny man in the middle of the circle, with an armful of the bottles. Immediately it is plain that the man is not from around here. He isn’t dusty or tanned, nor muscular. He isn’t a soldier, not by far. Dean asks him for a water bottle, and he receives one with a nod- no words are spoken, but it seems as though something is exchanged. Dean ignores the uneasy feeling and settles back down on his rock. He is holding the bottle to his head, eyes closed, when he feels the shadow of someone standing over him. “Mind if I sit ? There seems to be nowhere else.” Dean scoots over to allow room for the stranger with the water. They sit in silence for a few minutes as Dean chugs his bottle.
Dean hasn’t been to this place much, and Cas has never been at all, but they decide to pick something different than the Roadhouse. They soon realize their mistake as they notice a small group of men watching them. After a few minutes, they can clearly hear them making inappropriate and homophobic comments. Cas is used to hearing harsh slurs from his youth, and they had never really bothered him. He knew who he was and it didn’t matter to him what strangers thought. On the contrary, that kind of language is so rarely heard in this town that it starts to rile Dean up.
Dean shrugs noncommittally and takes a sip of his own coffee. He scribbles quickly on his board and slides it over to Cas. “Milton says I might be able to walk in a few days.”
“See you later, Dean.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Sorry, the ending kinda sucks. Thoughts ?
“Yeah, our dad’s not around a ton either. We have our Uncle Bobby now though, he’s not even really our uncle, but- you know what, that’s not really relevant. You could come to The Roadhouse after school with me, I go there a lot to study while Dean is working.” Sam looks hopeful to have a study buddy.
Castiel’s mind is lust-hazy, and it seems like both minutes and hours have passed until he is watching his boyfriend roll on a condom. They’ve moved it to the bedroom now, a mass of tangled limbs on the king-sized bed that now holds both of their scents from everyday use. Dean pushes his legs up to rest over his own shoulders. He lines up with Cas’ prepped and ready entrance, smoothing his calloused hands down his lover’s thighs. “I’m gonna make it so good for you.” His grammar has dropped more syllables than usual with his arousal, a slight southern twang slipping out, barely noticeable to anyone that knows him any less than Cas. Dean pushes his length in slowly, his eyes slipping shut at the feeling. “So tight…” The pair exchanges a dirty kiss, all tongue and hot arousal. After the adjustment period, Dean quickens his pace until the sound of slapping skin and harsh breaths is filling the room.
The officer gives Cas instructions on where Dean is being flown to. He’s going to be at a fancy military hospital in New York, in a few hours.
“Yeah, I guess it was. It left me pretty scared because I didn’t know anything. Well, I knew most of my life, but the recent stuff I couldn’t remember at all. It was all new and frightening…” Dean takes a deep breath and continues. “Then I started getting flashbacks of the war, which was
“Don’t stop.” He pleads.
March 2004
Cas and Dean turn to look at one another excitedly. “But, there’s one more thing.” Sam confesses.
Cas combs his hands through Dean’s hair “It will be fun. You’ll feel better.”
After a while, Sam gives them some alone time and goes to make calls to relatives.
“Yellow eyes, you say?” She repeats Cas’ words. He nods, tilting his head in confusion at her reaction.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
As they begin the journey back to the car, Dean suddenly begins to feel increasingly nervous. His hand barely brushes against Cas’ every so often, and he so badly wants to take it, but he chickens out. He’s almost pissed at himself by the time they make it back to his place. Cas is climbing in his car and he still hasn’t made a move.
Sam is the one to lead Dean to his room, while their mom and dad prepare everything for the dinner party.
Castiel bolts, running back toward the bar. He bursts through the door “Help! I need help.” He sounds hysterical. “My boyfriend is being attacked!” A bunch of men jump out of their seats, and the bartender calls the police. Cas runs back outside, almost tripping over his own feet. The trio of men see the mob coming toward them and drop Dean, all three of them bolting in different directions. Cas is the first one to reach Dean, and although he knows this is his boyfriend, his brain almost doesn’t comprehend it.
“Oh, I am sorry…” Castiel is embarrassed now. “I just thought…” He cups his hands around his own mug and squeezes, hoping that he can disappear into the warm liquid inside.
Dean shakes his head, embarrassed now. He doesn’t even know what he was trying to say himself. He buries his face in his pillow, hoping Cas will drop it.
of his life, but he also lost about four years.
“Of course, my apologies, I was being rude.” They quickly switch over to talking about school and the class they’re mutually studying for.
Missouri answers it, but he requests Cas, and ten minutes later, Cas appears in the doorway. “Hey, champ, you okay ?” Dean doesn’t feel like writing out an explanation, so he just shakes his head no. Cas sits on the edge of his bed.
Dean just sits up a little, leaning forward. He knows that the doctor is referring to his back, where infection is most likely to occur. He feels light, cool touches on his sore back, carefully peeling off the wrap and rubbing salve onto it. He hisses in pain anyway, because the deep grooves are sensitive.
John and Mary insist that Cas stay the whole week with them, so he doesn’t have to be alone. They have a guest room in the same hall as Dean and Sam’s rooms, upstairs.
But he can’t.
“Didn’t peg you for a
Dean looks fantastic tonight, in a tight black t-shirt and dark jeans that hug his butt. Cas can’t help but feel the heat rising to his cheeks as he watches him walk in front of him. They grab a picnic table and watch the band set up. Cas squints his eyes, he could swear the drummer looks like…
“I’m so sorry. Come here…” It takes Dean over an hour to come out of the position. He crawls to Cas and lays his head next to him without touching him. They sit together in silence for two more hours, until Dean has fallen asleep from exhaustion. Only then does Cas allow his own tears to fall, creating a puddle on the carpet in front of him. He sits awake next to Dean almost all night, hating himself for not being the boyfriend, or hell, even human being, he’d thought he was being.
“Whatsa matter? Thought that’s what you liked.” The man sneers. His voice is nasally and his tone is taunting.
(See the end of the chapter for
“It will be good for you…to talk about things. I know there’s things you don’t want me to know, so maybe you can tell this guy. His name is Garth, he’s supposed to be really great. Please, Dean ?”
“What the hell are you doing out here?” The boy rolls off of Castiel, and for the first time he sees his arm in a sling. It must have aggravated his injury to tackle Castiel out of harm's way, but he did it anyway.
Mary peeks in and sees them laughing together, and the sight brings tears to her eyes. Cas is such a blessing to them, especially for Dean. He’s really come out of his shell since they’ve started hanging out more, and even though they haven’t gotten him professional help yet, she believes that he’s slowly healing.
I haven't forgotten about you all ! Or this story. Here's another chapter, although it's a little short. I hope you enjoy it anyway, and check out my second fic that's currently in progress- "Angel of the Morning"
Cas wakes up on the floor at 7am on the dot, when his phone rings. He already knows it’s going to be someone from the hospital convincing him not to quit after hearing his voicemail. He ends up having a thirty minute long conversation with his supervisor and concedes not to quit but to settle for a few personal days off. That offer is unheard of for a physician who is doing their residency, and Cas knows he should feel lucky, but the thought of having to leave Dean alone again is twisting his insides.
"Cas, I'm covered in scars and burns. That's not beautiful to anyone." He looks down at his hands in his lap, scooting away a little. "I'm sorry I ruined everything again."
Head over to my Instagram account for some pictures of Dean related to how he would look in this chapter  ! Tried my hardest to put them in there but it didn't work out :(
“Because it means that if you’re cleared…you can sign the adoption papers within a year.” Sam tells him.
Dean goes to the fabric store and picks out thick crimson yarn and a grey, howling wolf patch for the front of it. He buys a knitting needle and a book about the basics of knitting.
“Yes.” He tells him, his eyes welling up. Dean slides the ring onto his finger. Everyone around them claps and cheers, and Dean stands up and takes a bow. He pulls Cas up with him and yells “We’re getting married !” More people cheer, and a few come up and congratulate them.
Most days it seems to Dean that there’s no real reason for anything. He watches the rain out the window and wonders why. He watches the minutes on the clock tick by and wonders why time even exists, why it matters. Food tastes bland to him anymore. He’s losing weight and his job is long gone. He doesn’t shower enough. He forgets to go to the bathroom until his bladder is almost bursting. He puts a tiny bit more effort in when Cas is home, but he is becoming increasingly busier at the hospital and Dean can’t bring himself to hold him back from something he’s worked so hard for and loves so much. He gives off the illusion to his family that he and Cas are often busy together and that is the reason why he doesn’t see them as much. In reality, most days Dean sits at home in the dark, ignoring the world that has hurt him so much.
It’s a nice change from laying in bed all day, and Dean thinks about making a routine. Maybe he’ll do this every Monday, and then Tuesdays he’ll do something different…it will return normalcy to his life, and give him something to do- yeah, he’ll make a routine.
“Is he brain dead ?” Cas asks fearfully.
This chapter skips around a bit too, but I did a lot more elaboration on how Dean is doing post trauma, and a little insight to what he endured while he was kidnapped. I hope it's not getting too annoying to keep focusing on Dean's declining mental state and what not....thoughts ? In hindsight, this whole chapter probably doesn't make sense. I don't even know.
“Dean !” He flings himself at him and wraps his arms around him without another thought. “You’re here…oh God…you’re here.” He mumbles. Dean has longer hair now, and he’s definitely thinner, but he’s the same Dean.
Dean is shaking uncontrollably now, his breathing coming in rough gasps. He pulls his phone out and tries to dial Cas’ number, but his fingers are too clumsy in his current state. More people approach him to ask if he’s alright. He has a nice middle aged woman dial Castiel’s number for him.
And that sentence makes Dean’s heart swell. Cas makes it sound like even though they were countries and millions of miles apart, they were together because of their sky.
“It’s been…..a while.” Castiel admits cautiously.
“I want it to be a date.” Cas tells him. “You’re so nice to me, you’re a good cook, and….I want it to be a date.” He repeats. He is blushing on the other end of the line and is thankful that this is not in person.
Maybe Dean isn’t, but Cas is so deathly afraid. If he loses Dean, he’s lost everything. He’s lost his future, his happiness…His heart clenches and his stomach lurches, bile climbing in his throat. He throws up in the bathroom, and the tears start to stream down his face. Dean
Even though everything is still messed up, having Cas there doesn’t freak Dean out as much as he thought it would. He supposes that after all his trauma, he should be more closed off, but he just can’t bring himself to shut everyone out. He spent so long without people there to care, he just can’t let it go now. Dean doesn’t care that he’s already becoming dangerously co-dependent on Cas- it doesn’t matter anymore. He’s clinging to anything he can, and the more Castiel allows it, the more he doesn’t push him away, the more Dean needs him.
“So, this is like your job?” Dean inquires, looking up at Cas’ face for the first time since he has begun bombarding him with questions.
February, 2002
“Oh my god…it’s a…” Dean is cut off by the sound of the baby crying once again- the sound that the two heard in the bedroom just minutes prior. Castiel whips open the door. “A baby?!”
Dean can now get a good look at the other car- a 1978 Lincoln Continental of all vehicles. The thing is a yellow color that could be described by some as putrid, and rusting in various spots. And now, with a decent-sized dent in the back and a fender that is hanging on with its last hope. Dean is pondering all of this when he realizes two things: the driver of the other car is now standing near him, and he hasn’t even thought to check his own Impala for damage yet. “Man…I am so sorry. Couldn’t even see your car through the bushes.” Dean starts with an apology to the stranger while assessing his front fender. He breathes a quiet sigh of relief- his baby is unharmed save for a couple of small scratches. His car is old, a 1967 model, but sturdy as hell and well taken care of. The Continental on the other hand…clearly suffered the damage due to lack of tender loving care. The other man finally speaks “It was clearly an unfortunate accident. I do not blame you.” Dean had not been expecting the gruff voice that emanated from the other man, nor the words he spoke. He’d been expecting the guy to be an asshole, frankly, given the situation. “I do not have automobile insurance.” The man says as an afterthought, rubbing the back of his neck in a clear sign of distress.
.” Sam frowns.
Castiel wears his smile all the way up to his room.
Cas speeds up his pace, snapping his hips forward. He shifts and changes the angle, making both of them let out a strangled sound.
Dean kisses his cheek. “It’s almost 11.”
January, 2004
Jodi looks bewildered “Dean’s father was tracking that man before he passed.”
. I know that it’s difficult right now, and it hurts, and it seems like nothing is working, but trust me when I say that you’re doing amazing. It wasn’t your fault that you passed out, that was a fault on part of the staff, and maybe even me. I apologize for that Dean, I really do. But you can make it through this, and I’m going to be here for you through all of it.”
He kisses him and tastes a bit of himself, which causes a heavy and sticky makeout session. They shower together again afterward, before collapsing into bed, curled around one another.
Dean agrees, and Cas comes to take Dean an hour later. “Milton checked him over ? He’s good to go ?” He double checks.
When they arrived, Jo got to him first. She squeezed him in a big hug “Well, you’re just as square-headed as the last time I saw you.” Ellen scolds her, but it pulls a laugh out of Dean. He was glad that she was treating him normally. Ellen was next -pulling him into a long, soft hug, with a “We’re so glad you’re back, sweetie.” Bobby hung back until Mary had ushered Ellen and Jo into the kitchen. He came up and held Dean’s face for a moment, with tears in his eyes. Bobby was like a second father to him, and he knew that he was like the son Bobby never had. Bobby hugged him around the shoulders with a gruff “Good to see you again, boy.”
“And for what it’s worth, I’m sorry.”
Cas’ breath catches in his throat when he reads Dean’s letter. He flashes back to when they first met;
Cas climbs up the stairs to Dean’s room, pushing open the door. Dean is sitting on his bed waiting.  He looks a lot different now than when Cas first met him. His skin is a shade of bronze, and freckles are visible sprinkled across his nose. His eyes are brighter, and he looks so much healthier. He looks beautiful.
“Cas?”
Dean can barely sleep all night, the day’s events playing over in his mind. He feels guilty for not knowing Cas was sick, even if he hadn’t seen him all day. He shudders to think what might have happened if his appendix had burst. Cas has become such a light in Dean’s life, he can’t imagine what his days would be like without his dry humor, his wide smile, or his gentle, hesitant touch. He thinks of the word love, and it doesn’t even startle him- it doesn’t feel like a realization, it feels so natural that he doesn’t even notice that he’s just associated the word with Castiel.
They find a wedding planner and start deciding on things right away. They set the date for the end of the next summer- August 28
“Castiel?” The boy looks at him in confusion, and he recognizes him as Sam Winchester, a boy from his high school several grades below him. The other male with him, currently on top of his own body, doesn’t look familiar despite his age being obviously closer to Castiel’s own.
One night in late August, Dean asks Cas on a date.
He sees Garth the following Monday. He’s nothing at all like Dean expected; Dean had been picturing a stereotypical fat, old, bald guy. But Garth looks younger than him even- a tall, skinny, nerdy dude with an encouraging smile. The nameplate on his desk reads “Garth Fitzgerald IV.” Maybe then his session will go better than expected too.
For some reason, I had trouble organizing this chapter- I feel like it skips around a lot. I hope it still makes sense....also, it's a little shorter, but I felt like it was completed. I wanted to do some more description about Dean's rescue, but I figured it wouldn't make sense for him to remember every little detail, what with shock and all that. I might do some more elaboration later....Thoughts on this chapter ?
Castiel has been working on his vows for days now. They are planning on doing simple, regulation vows at the courthouse, but the dark-haired man wants to say something really special on the day of their actual celebratory wedding. A knock at the door jars him out of his thoughts. "Coming!"
Cas sees Dean almost as much as he sees Sam, although their interaction is much more limited. He often picks them up from here or there, but he doesn’t always stick around for the hanging out part.
“Dean !” Sam yells, flinging the door open. “Dean- oh, shit. Sorry.” Sam closes the door again.
“Dean, stop. Please.” Cas pleads with him. He watches as Dean throws the bag over his shoulder and begins to exit the room. “Please!” He says again, louder this time. He follows Dean until they’re almost to the front door- Dean continues to ignore him. He makes a grab for the strap of the duffel bag , not realizing his mistake. All Dean sees out of the corner of his eye is a hand quickly coming toward him. He drops the bag immediately and covers his head with his hands, scooting away from Castiel quickly. Cas’ feels what is left of his heart break apart inside his chest. Dean thought he was going to hurt him. He had thought that Cas was going to hit him.
“Hey, you doing okay?” Sam sits down at the same table as him in the library, expression worried.
Dean ponders that for a moment. “You’re right. You got me there.”
“Only once a week. Just try it. You never know…” Cas pleads.
“Want to talk about it ?” Castiel asks him gently. He assumes it was another nightmare, which wouldn’t be an absurd considering all Dean has been through. To his surprise, Dean grabs his board and begins to write.
There’s still a portion of him that thinks this all can’t possibly be real, but when he sees a wispy, transparent woman, it’s all of the proof he needs. Right before their eyes, she shrieks and shoves Dean, hard. He skitters back and lands hard on his ass, and Cas and Sam wince in sympathy from the shadows. The woman- ghost- whatever, jumps onto Dean and rakes her nails over his chest, ripping his shirt in long streaks. Sam stands suddenly.
“I love you. I love you so much.”
Dean's Date Outfit
“In a way. It is my duty to serve Heaven and do as they ask of me.” The pair are sitting outside on Dean’s small back patio. The evening air is balmy and the sky is a beautiful peach color, signaling the setting of the late June sun.
Castiel sets up an ‘appointment’ with Dean for the next week, with a hopeful flutter in his stomach and an undented bumper.
“Keep talking Dean !” John tells him, running as fast as he can over the frozen ground.
“No!” Cas says it much like a petulant child. “But I am tipsy.” He admits.
“I want to take you out tonight babe. Do dinner at a fancy restaurant and a movie, fireworks show afterward…the whole thing.” He wraps his arms around Cas’ waist and kisses the back of his neck.
Can you say the worst at beginning stories and consistently updating them?
Dean sits up with Cas while they put the cast on his arm, and is the first one to sign it. They release him in the early morning, and he goes home to the Winchester’s house. They lay in Dean’s bed together, talking quietly and absorbing each other’s presence.
Dean's eyes grow wide and Castiel lets out a small gasp. Sam leaves them alone with a small file of papers regarding the CPS visit, promising to call later. The two males sit together on their couch, at a loss for words for quite some time. Finally, Dean speaks, "Well, this isn't quite how I wanted to do it." He laughs shakily, his nerves causing his voice to tremble.
“I have to say that I’m going to miss you- but that being said, I don’t ever want to see you in here again.” He smiles. “I know you have a long hard road in front of you, but I know you’re tough enough to handle it, too. Good luck, Dean.”
here. He must have this job in addition to hunting- Castiel can’t imagine that pays well.
“What would
Dean hasn’t spoken a word to Castiel in over a week, though Cas has appeared three more times since the night at the Roadhouse. The angel can’t understand how saying such a thing to the other man could have upset him- he had let him know that his feelings were okay, he did not berate him or spout some misinterpreted scripture like many others would be so inclined to do.
The other boy, Dean, gestures to the immobile body to their right. “Well he does now.”
“You may go now, if you wish.”
“Do you want me to tell you our story ?” Cas asks hopefully- maybe it will jog Dean’s memory.
I mean, who doesn't love Dirty dancing references? Also, it's true that Swayze's butt in those black pants really added to the quality of the movie. Thank you all for reading and leave me some feedback (:
He doesn’t use them- they’re something that Gabriel got for him a few years back. His brother had disguised them as a gag gift but he has the sneaking suspicion that it was his brother’s way of giving him his approval, letting him know that he didn’t have a problem with his sexual orientation.
“Thanks, it’s something Sam got me when we were kids. I never take it off.” He rests a palm on Cas’ thigh, Cas guesses to ground himself as he gets his wounds tended to. His hand is warm even through his jeans, and he wills himself not to squirm.
"Are we dating ?" Dean asks, holding his breath
(See the end of the chapter for

“My mom always used to tell me that when I was a kid.” Dean tells him, wondering why he’s oversharing to his boyfriend’s older brother whom he has just met not half an hour ago. Gabe swallows another piece of licorice. “It’s true. Always have been, for that kid.” Dean doesn’t understand what he means but doesn’t ask.
Castiel nods, unsure of what else to say. It’s not like anyone would believe him anyway.
The first thing he does when he gets off the plane is hug Sam. He calls him a wimp for crying, but secretly he’s wiping his eyes behind Sam’s back. Sam drove here in Baby, and Dean drives them home with pride, blasting AC/DC with the windows rolled down. He takes a long, hot shower when they get there, then collapses into bed. He sleeps for two days straight.
Leave me some feedback !
Dean can leave his room now, which usually results in Sam pushing him in a wheelchair down the hallways, or to the cafeteria, or the solariums at the end of the halls. It makes Dean feel like a little less of a prisoner, but not less of a burden. What kind of 21 year old can’t walk by himself ? Especially one with two fully functioning legs. But no, Dr. Milton insists that his lungs aren’t strong enough and his vitals aren’t quite right. Dean chooses to sit by windows mostly, watching the sunset or the stars. He even wheels himself down to the cafeteria sometimes, and parks his wheelchair by the floor-to-ceiling windows, watching the cars go by at night.
Dean has been here for two months, but the therapists and psychologists still don’t think he’s quite ready. He feels great, but he trusts their judgment. There’s no way that he wants to go home too soon and regress from all of his hard work.
Cas wanted to tell her that he thought her second closet full of only shoes and handbags was ‘impractical’, but of course he said nothing.
“I was near a bomb when it exploded, and it gave me a brain injury- memory loss. I couldn’t remember Cas…that’s my boyfriend. I still feel really bad about it, because that must have been pretty hard for him.”
Dean is not expecting his phone to ring a few minutes later, but he answers it right away so that he doesn’t have time to think too much. “Hello, Dean.” Cas’ familiar gravel voice greets him.
It breaks Dean’s heart to hear his mom’s soft crying and murmured words when she thinks her son is asleep.
“Yes it is. May I ask who is speaking ?”
Bobby hands him a gold pocket watch with intricate carvings on it.
“Someone once told me that it’s okay to be scared, it means you still have something to lose. Stay scared, Dean.”
getting better.” Cas tells Dean. They’re sitting on Dean’s bed, talking.
The two men from inside the bar seem to step out from nowhere. None of them look at Cas, they swarm Dean with a vengeance. It’s clear that they are angry with Dean for trying to stand up to them. Two of them hold his arms while the man with the yellow eyes gets a good hit right to Dean’s jaw. Cas freezes in shocked horror. Dean’s lip splits immediately and begins to bleed. In the span of a mere minute, the man with the yellow eyes has hit Dean half a dozen times. Castiel can hear himself screaming for them to stop, but his voice sounds foreign and far away, even to his own ears.
“Thank you Dean, that was very kind of you.” Cas sees what Sam means now about his brother being a “softie”. He’s weirdly touched by the gesture.
“Yeah, I can’t argue with that.” Cas huffs a laugh. He leans in again, giving Dean soft , hot kisses.
“Yeah well I’m me, and you two are...you two. And the you two that you two are is...not hunters.” Dean scowls, standing up.
“Mary and I talked about it, and we’re not sure it’s right for Dean specifically.” John says. “We don’t want him to have to relive it over and over…”
” They chant in unison. “Happy New- !” Dean’s exclaim is interrupted by Cas’ lips colliding with his own. Cas pulls away after a moment and rests their foreheads together. “Happy New Year, Dean.”
“You know, I may have just met you, but I missed you.” Dean admits. “I miss talking about real things. All anyone wants to do around here is complain or talk about home. I want to talk about life. I want to talk about things we love and hate, and memories and happy times, not things we miss. Not the fucked up things, not all the lost time.” Dean sighs and looks up at the sky.
“Pain ?” Dean shakes his head again. “Just want some company, then ? I can stay for a few minutes.” Cas chatters mindlessly, trying to distract Dean from his obvious discomfort. Dean falls asleep while he’s talking, the tail of his lab coat underneath Dean’s arm. He lifts it gently and puts it back on the bed, but not before giving his hand a reassuring squeeze. “Goodnight, Dean.”
Dean is out grocery shopping by himself one day when he hears a nasally voice that sounds exactly like Alistair’s. In the back of his mind, he knows that Alistair is dead, but for one moment, it just takes him back.
The blue-eyed man squeaks "Dean!" He had no idea that Dean was thinking about their future so seriously. He knows this is a big deal for him. "I do. I mean, I will. I mean, let's do this." He stutters out the sentence ungracefully, the high points of his cheekbones flushing rose. They embrace softly before going through the papers in the file that Sam left.
The three men have a delicious meal together, and Dean is thrilled at how well Cas and Sam are hitting it off. He couldn’t be more proud to show off either one of them, and getting to show them off to each other had him practically splitting his face with his grin. Dean and his boyfriend lay together on the couch after Sam leaves.
Dean is put into a neck brace and strapped down to a stretcher as they prepare to load him into the ambulance. They ask Cas all kinds of questions, and he rattles off the answers in shock. He calls Sam on the ride to the hospital as he squeezes Dean’s hand. Sam’s voice sounds as panicked as his own, and he promises that himself and Mary are on their way.
“Yeah, well he’s a softie.” He smiles wryly. “Hunting is his thing, you know? He enjoys all of it, saving people, feeling like he’s making a difference.”
“Dean ?” Mary shakes Dean awake gently. “Was it another nightmare sweetie ?”
“Please…don’t come closer.” Dean is panicking, and he feels bad for resisting the man’s help. He shakes his head and walks away.
“You’re right. The exact same sky.” He says, almost wistfully, like he wishes that the sky was a private thing between him and Dean. He wishes that it was only theirs, someplace they can look when they want to get away from it all and be real. He likes that expression now, ‘being real.’ It’s like everything else is fake unless you put your own meaning behind it, give it your own breath and a piece of yourself. That’s what Dean wants, he wants Cas to share little pieces of himself. Not shallow little details, but the clear cut things that define him. He wants reality out here in this wasteland. And Cas won’t be the one to deny him.
“As long as no parents or guardians turn up, we might be able to find a way to bypass the foster system entirely and move the process along. It’s gonna take some time.” Jodi warns Sam. “And both of the boys and the house will need to pass an inspection and evaluation.”
Cas prays now, every night, for Dean. It weighs on his mind that maybe, just maybe, he hasn’t seen him these four months because he was killed in the line of duty. He doesn’t want to think about that possibility- it seems like the only reason he’s still doing this now is for Dean. He’s lost his passion, not for helping people but for the peace side of this war. He sees the soldiers point of view now, whether that’s because of Dean or not. He sees the Afghans do just as much to the Americans, and yet there’s no one racing to help their side out. It’s a double standard and it’s unfair and it’s not real. It’s bullshit. Every night he lays in the sand and looks up at the stars.
That’s Dean’s routine for a while, until ‘text Cas’ starts taking over the whole agenda. Cas’ texts are sporadic since he’s always working, but it always gives Dean a thrill to hear from him. It’s something nice to look forward to for a change.
Two months almost to the day the boy was found, Sam comes bursting through the door of his brother’s house. “I have some good news.” His smile can’t be contained. “In a few weeks, I scheduled a CPS visit for you two.” Both Cas and Dean look confused.
“Would you like something to drink, or eat?” The polite church boy still resides in him, a habit that he’s never quite broken.
“We met in 2001, in Afghanistan. You had just enlisted and I was a mission worker there, with my church. I brought your platoon some water… I told you I didn’t believe in the war, and we argued at first. Then we just kept meeting up, and we would just talk. Mostly we’d lay on our backs and look up at the stars together…I left a few months before you were deployed back home, and then we didn’t see each other for a few months. But then you drove to South Carolina to visit me….you stayed a week with me, and then was when I knew I loved you. We started dating after that, and we would drive to each other’s house every weekend….the first time that we, um, made love…was the night you asked me to move in with you. We were so happy…..but then you enlisted again. I was so mad at you, I said some awful things to you, and I didn’t say goodbye before you left. I’m so sorry for that. We wrote letters to each other though…I’ll bring them and you can read them.” Cas looks down and fidgets with his hands, unsure of what to say next. It’s really hard for him, he will have to re-explain the details of their relationship to someone who once knew him better than anyone.
There is probably a lot of mistakes near the end, so sorry about that. I was hurrying to get this posted. So here's basically some insight on Dean's home life after everything that's happened...
Dean raises his head, and Cas can see that he’s been crying. It’s the first time he’s ever seen Dean get emotional, and he knows it must have all been bottling up. “Listen…I can’t say I know what you’ve been through, nor can I spout off facts about kidnapping or its victims. But medicine- medicine I do know. And that’s how I know that you
I'm so sorry I've been crap at updating ! Enjoy some smut in lieu of apology :) This is kind of a filler chapter, because I didn't want them to be married just yet. It's a little short, but I felt like it was finished so that's why I'm posting it. Again, thank you to everyone who's left kudos and/or commented !
Dean grunts in response.
He goes downstairs, and hears his family conversing in quiet voices- most likely in worried tones, about him.
It’s over.
Cas keeps going at a steady, fast pace and fucks them both into a blissful orgasm. Cas hasn’t come untouched in a long time, but tonight was just so perfect that he did anyway. Dean swipes a finger through the mess on his chest and sucks on it, closing his eyes. He swollen lips close around his fingers beautifully, and Cas moans at the sight. “You’re so hot.”
“Um, okay, thank you.” Castiel dutifully climbs into the backseat of Dean Winchester’s car for the second time.
“Dean!”
Cas can’t help but laugh at that, but truthfully Dean just astonished him. Was he alluding to finding Patrick Swayze attractive? As in, a male? Castiel ponders this as Dean slides back underneath the Continental. At some point, Dean has turned on the radio, at first singing exaggeratedly as a joke, but now, singing quietly in a normal voice. He wonders if Dean knows that he can hear him. It’s nice, sitting in companionable silence in the wake of the setting sun.
He imagines himself slipping the Winchester brothers a fifty that night- “Hey, thanks for saving my life from that werewolf, sure was a close one”- and chuckles to himself.
“Would you….would you want to be my boyfriend? Start officially dating?” Dean wants to ask before the band begins again.
“I don’t know !” He dry sobs. That’s the whole point, he doesn’t know what’s going on anymore. Sure, he remembers
Up in the sky, spelled in purple, is
It takes half an hour for Dean to stop crying, and then he's just listless. Cas cleans him up and gets him to drink some water, and then tucks him in.
“Sometimes, you can’t change people’s opinions. And that’s okay. We don’t have to prove anything to anyone.” Cas tells him gently.
They arrive and sit at a table, sipping coffees. A few people recognize Dean and are whispering, but he ignores them in favor of ‘talking’ to Sam.
The next day, they have lunch with Jess and Sam, and they break the news. Jess starts crying with joy, and even Sam looks misty-eyed. He hugs them both “I’m so happy for you.” Jess starts talking to Cas about wedding invitations, color themes, and flower arrangements. Sam and Dean discuss the guests and the date.
Dean slips his hands just beneath Cas’ new sweater, to rest on his hips. His thumbs rub slow circles, giving Cas a tingly feeling all the way to his toes.
“Now, Sam!”
Cas opens it carefully. He can barely make out the words from all the dirt, but he’s 99% sure this
"You haven't ruined anything. Everything is just fine. This is the best Christmas I've ever had, and I wouldn't want to spend it anywhere else." He reaches out for Dean's hand and pulls him closer again.
Dean barks a laugh “You just disrespected soldiers everywhere yet you think you should give us water anyway ? What are you, one of those bible-thumpers that don’t ‘believe’ in the war ?”
“Dean, baby, please wake up. Get out of bed, get some fresh air…I made us some food.” Cas pleads, sitting on the edge of the bed.
He hopes his idea isn’t lame, but he can think of a perfect sweater to make him. A huge, cozy maroon one, and he’ll find a patch to iron on the front.
The facility itself is beautiful, with lots of outdoor space to think and confront his demons. He spends a lot of time outside in the lush, gorgeous garden. He knows Castiel would love this part of the property. He sits on a concrete bench there and thinks or writes. Occasionally Dean will snort- his former self would think he’s a wussy for keeping a journal. Yet, it helps. He puts down the thoughts he would never say out loud for fear of hurting someone.
Sometimes it’s weeks, sometimes longer, but Dean
“I’m sure they appreciate that very much. I would love a home cooked meal every night.” Castiel says wistfully.
“Thank you, angel.” Dean grins back.
“Don’t be ridiculous. I love ambulance rides.” Dean attempts to crack a joke, managing a tight smile.
“Next time?” Cas implores shyly.
“I think you should see a therapist…”
Maybe it has something to do with the fact that he’s spent all his life in a small town in Kansas that is less than tolerable of anyone of a different race, religion, background, or sexual orientation. Maybe it has something to do with the disappointment he had seen in his father’s eyes the day that he caught him in his room with Aaron Bass when they were sixteen. Maybe it has something to do with how much his heart had hurt after he told Aaron the next day that he didn’t want to hang out anymore, maybe it was when he couldn’t even meet the other boy’s eyes as he did so. Or maybe, it was the burning jealousy that he felt when Aaron moved on with someone else senior year. Maybe it was his vow to never get involved with a guy again- or the familiar feeling of self-hatred he has had every ‘morning after’ for years to come when he has broken his own rule.
“Dean! He has the original
“I’m aware.” Dean crosses his arms over his chest, suddenly conscious of the fact that he is shirtless in front of Cas. “Haven’t had much to say.” He adds, averting his eyes to the worn carpeting.
Dean picks a facility with the help of his supporters and is unpacking his things in his ‘new room’ two weeks later. He has decided that he doesn’t want any visitations while he is here, and he hopes that his family and Cas understand why. The tortured man wants no distractions, plus he wants to emerge a whole new man and surprise them all. It also may have a little something to do with the fact that if they come to visit he’s terrified that his willpower will break down and he will want to leave with them. Perhaps the toughest part is that the program has no set length- he will stay as long as he needs until they feel that he is mentally sound enough to return home.
Cas smiles and moves closer to kiss him. “I love you too.”
“Yeah. Just thinking, you know ?” Dean rolls onto his side to face Cas. “I try not to think about it mostly, but sometimes it’s inevitable.”
Cas has laid awake on more than one occasion thinking about all the things he’d like to do with Dean in their future. Having Dean stay the night was one of them, as well has have sex, move in together, buy a house…Cas would love nothing more than to do all the good things in life with Dean, but sometimes he’s scared of pushing Dean away. He doesn’t blame him for struggling to be able to do some things, and he just hopes his own impatience sometimes won’t sabotage their relationship. He dreams of buying them a house, and getting down on one knee. He knows deep down that he’s completely in love with Dean, and he would do anything for him. He’ll wait for him.
Dean looks up at Cas, and has the sudden, overwhelming urge to press their lips together. Cas means so much to him, has been there for him for months now, and he just needs more. He needs this to mean something, to make it permanent. Because if he loses this, he doesn’t think he’ll ever recover. He needs, craves affection so much now, and he truly has feelings for Cas.
Cas ends up staying until ten o’clock that night, after countless episodes of ‘Dr. Sexy’ and a dinner with the Winchesters. Castiel had almost forgotten what it was like to have a family dinner. He gives Dean his cell phone number before he leaves, telling himself that since Dean is no longer his patient, that it’s okay. Dean is a twenty-one year old adult, and Cas is a twenty-four year old adult, and there’s no real reason why they can’t be friends.
Truthfully, Dean had thought about it. But back then, there just hadn’t been quite the living in the profession as there was today. Dean had gone to school for architecture instead, but then his dad had passed and he came home to help their mom and Sam. The he found a job doing contracting that paid well, and the rest was history. He did secretly regret not finishing a degree, but he would never let his mother or brother feel guilty over needing him.
(See the end of the chapter for
He speaks soothingly to him, not touching him again and sitting a safe distance away but still close enough to comfort him. He helps him stand up afterward and picks up the cans. As they walk out, Cas asks if he wants to talk about it.
I hope I made enough sense when describing things from both Dean and Cas' point of view. Also, to clarify, John will be portayed in the story as how I think he would have been as a father if he weren't a hunter. Think of "What is and What Never Should Be" vibes. Thank you for reading and let me know what you think so far!
“I hate you ! I hate you !” Cas has been screaming at Dean for an hour. He’s inconsolable, crying and begging him. Dean tries to hug him, but Cas shoves him away. “Just leave ! Might as well leave now !”
"Cas ?"
“What about
"Dean, you okay ?" He asks, nudging him. Dean just shakes his head and goes back to silently staring out the window. They sit in silence for a long time, before Cas tries to talk to him again.
