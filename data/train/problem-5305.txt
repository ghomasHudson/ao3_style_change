Tony shakes his head. “I need to say it, anyway. It was removed because my dad was afraid I would use it and ruin your legacy. I don’t think I would have,” he adds with a sudden fierceness, a sudden vulnerability, eyes bright. “I wouldn’t ever use this connection against you. Or anything against you.”
Tony raises a hand, conjuring a magic ball. The door to the building slides open easily. “Scan,” he murmurs, sounding puzzled. The ball he conjures ripples, but remains colorless, negative for illusions. “Well, it’s not an illusion,” Tony says. “Or anything I recognize. But there’s definitely magic, it’s everywhere.”
“It doesn’t matter how hard I tried,” Tony says. Steve is trying so hard. It’s not like he wasn’t there to see Tony execute his darker ideas. “It wasn’t enough. Or it was too much.” He mentally reminds himself to send Steve new override codes.
Natasha’s lips curve up, and Tony thinks they’re painted as red as the Aether. “I wouldn’t say long.”
Steve shrugs and agrees. They find the Scarlet Witch waiting outside her home for them, arms crossed, standing in a garden of blooming, snow white flowers.
Tony hums, crossing his arms. He used to really want to meet Steve (he was a kid at some point, too, wasn’t he). At first as a fan, before he got tired of Howard talking about him.
“Do you think the Infinity Stones let just anybody wield them?” Thanos demands, and his voice booms now, the strange heavy tone turning into something angrier. Anguish. Loss. He’s a broken, fallen god. “The mind stone lets you, because if you wield the gauntlet once, it will always remember you.”
Steve nods, moaning when Tony reaches for Steve’s cock and starts to stroke him with clever fingers. “Tony,” Steve gasps, running a hand down Tony’s back. He thinks he might accidentally have taken in some of Tony’s magic because he feels a thrill of familiar power jolt through him, liquid, his nerves sinking down into an intoxicating heat, the ice in his veins replaced by fire.
Tony sucks in a breath, then exhales, and smiles, feeling cold. That’s that, then. He doesn’t have to worry anymore about Steve having memories or actual feelings for him. This isn’t real.
“I give you my Word I won’t tell anyone what you’re working on,” Steve adds. “I swear on my shield.”
“You have me,” Steve says, deepening the kiss and showing Tony that he is definitely not a ghost and isn’t going anywhere, not without Tony.
“I don’t,” Steve snaps. “I don’t know you. Fuck. Tony. I’d heard it was possible, memory transference, but… oh my God. You ate—you ate my friends,” he chokes, furious. Grief and shock glaze over his eyes. “Is that what you’re after, is that why you’re here? Tell me. What gave Hydra the right to decide things for the rest of the world? Who gave you the right? They took away your choice, so you take away everyone else’s?”
“Right, yes. You know about the Captain,” Tony says. He doesn’t look at Steve when he adds, “Captain, meet Bruce Banner. He’s one of the many people who have tried reinventing your particular brand of antimagic powers.”
“Hey, you okay?” Steve asks, sounding a little breathless. Kneeling by the tub, he looks awkward, almost unsure. If Tony didn’t know Steve better than he should, he’d think it very uncharacteristic of him.
They’ve both learned in very different ways how to best deal with wounds. One presses on them, bandages them up and soldiers onwards, stands his ground (he thinks it should hurt less than this). The other lets himself bleed out, makes himself into something else, that way he can’t bleed anymore (he thought it would hurt less than this).
“Hi Steve,” Bucky says, and there’s a certain softness to his voice that suggests he doesn’t want to do this, but he stands in front of Steve anyway. “You should’ve left. I warned you.”
Maybe it’s because he’s still sentimental, after all, and can’t bear to do something like that to the one he, despite all reason and logic, loves. Not that he has anybody to confide that in, and Steve will never know.
“Oh, so you do understand the concept of asking and answering,” Tony says. “Good job, Cap. Nice to know you just purposefully avoid that.”
“No,” Tony snaps, “no. I want everything done, undone. Just because you failed to save everyone does not mean you stop trying. You definitely don’t go burning down planets.”
It must be. There is nothing here. No one. Nothing but Tony’s own thoughts, nothing but the aftermath of his failure.
Tony arches, grinding them against each other, searching for friction. He smirks at the scent of blood—Steve is injured—and arousal. He smells it, it makes him lick his lips. Slowly, for show, for a reminder.
“What do you mean, ‘what do you mean’?” Tony arches an eyebrow. “He was… see-through. Like he’s moving in a different plane.” He grimaces. “The whole city sort of feels like that.”
“I am the Scarlet Witch. Not Wanda Maximoff to you.” The young woman glares at Tony. “Tony Stark.” Her voice holds no affection.
Tony laughs, terrified. “Not really. I forced yours, I’m the one who didn’t let you stop me. I—I took off the armor for a reason. Just so you know, you should knock me out next time. Or kill me. I give you permission. There you go.”
Right now, Steve holds onto that glacial feeling, lets it build inside, unyielding to any magic Loki may cast.
Tony looks back to whatever he’s working on. Steve wonders what expression he’s making when he says, “Guess the world doesn’t need you as much anymore, huh, Cap?”
The dead are still dead. Steve is… he is still gone. Just dust. They are all just dust in the end, but it’s not supposed to be the end yet.
Tony peers at him. “Here I thought you’d be singing ‘let’s kill the Nazis’ in your patriotic suit. I can have JARVIS play the accompaniment if you want.”
“The arc reactor. I made it to replace my heart. My mana is, pardon my language, fucked up,” Tony says wryly, but there’s a sort of relief in his eyes, like he’s glad Steve is listening like this, glad he finally knows. “Curse gone wrong when I was captured.” He shrugs. “The rift must’ve messed with that, when I shot at the freaky ninja that popped up out of nowhere.”
Steve makes his way back to where the festival is happening. The streets are emptier now, only lanterns floating around in the sky. People are busy spending time with loved ones. Catching up for lost time.
The tension in the room is palpable. He can practically hear them wondering if they should’ve set up more counter wards for the Captain, in case the summon backfires and the contract isn’t as unbreakable and reliable as they think it is.
“Well,” Tony says, “we heard that Sokovia was the place to be if we wanted our dreams to come true.”
Neither of them denied it, which made Steve blush. They made their way to the location Wanda gave them, a bubbling hot spring in the night. The air is warm here, smoldering.
Steve looks at Tony, not really believing it, even though Tony isn’t lying. How is he supposed to? “The world needs the Captain,” Steve says quietly. It’s something he’s been told for a very long time.
“Yes,” Steve says, then takes a deep breath. “But you know. The Purple Man. He—he forced both our hands.”
He feels like he’s known Steve since forever. Does Steve feel the same? Is that why Steve was so pleased when Tony told him in the cell that night, when Tony told him that he was going to defect from Hydra? One person won’t make the difference.
Desire makes you vulnerable. Need destroys people. Tony won’t let himself need anything or anyone else.
Tony shrugs. “I’m not saying stop being the fancy knight you are, though I wish you could get rid of the summon part,” he says. “That’s you, you know. You’re both Steve Rogers and the Captain. I’m not separating them. It’s like how the Iron Man and I are one. I can like you without having to choose—” Steve freezes up at those words, and Tony notices, of course he does. He swallows. “Okay, I. Did not mean that.”
“Tony Stark,” the vendor says, recognizing Tony. It occurs to Steve that Tony could wear a different mask and armor, could take off everything that makes him Iron Man. Maybe he thinks everything that he should be
Steve moves to deal with the injury. “No,” Tony says quickly. His eyes strain, looking at the plain white ceiling. It’s an old view. “It’s okay. I’ll heal.”
“The rune looks Asgardian, doesn’t it?” Tony asks. “Like old Wish magic. The unreliable monkey’s paw strikes again.”
,” he says, and pulls Steve’s cowl off, sliding his fingers gently through his beautiful blond hair. He hands the shield back to Steve and offers, “Knock me out. Maybe even kill me—there’s a thought. Do you think you can do that?”
“I’m asking for it right now,” Tony presses. From what Nebula told him... “Think about Gamora. Let me bring her back. All of them.” He hates Thanos, but he needs to convince him more than he needs vengeance. Perhaps, with the power of the mind stone, his voice holds enough persuasion to sway him.
“Even I can’t fix all the awful stagnation,” Tony says. “And not all change is good. Aren’t you supposed to be able to tell?”
They walk through and see the remnants. Steve can hear wailing souls, trapped in the place between worlds, not quite living, but unable to die in peace. Wanderers. He tightens his grip on his shield.
Steve isn’t good enough at compartmentalizing Tony away, though. Tony always bleeds through, and if he cuts off this heel, Steve won’t have this flaw anymore.
See—that’s how Tony wishes it went. In another world, it never goes this far. Or maybe it always does.
“But that’s also when it’s the riskiest,” Tony says. “Is self-sacrificing a shtick of yours, or does that just really get you off?”
“They say you’re the best there is at runes,” Steve says. Unlike Tony Stark, Steve can swallow his anger and pride for the sake of others.
“Stop talking about everything we could have if you come back?” Tony asks. “We can rebuild the world together. Oh… I’ll let you fuck me, stretch me open with your dick.” He moans shamelessly at the thought. “Yeah. Sounds good, doesn’t it? Just come home to me.”
Tony laughs. “You broke into my tower the first time we met,” he says. “This was nothing.” His eyes dart around. He looks restless, like he’s expecting tentacles to sprout out of the rocks.
That’s alarming. If it’s true that no spells are cast but wrathful monsters are appearing, something is happening. “Where is the origin? Are the other realms affected?”
The petals bloom strongly when Steve touches them. “They’re beautiful,” he says. They remind him of the field of lilies that bloomed every spring in his hometown. They’re probably no longer there. “Are all Sokovian flowers enchanted?”
Steve shakes his head. He doesn’t like the idea of Tony always avoiding that, of no one genuinely asking Tony that. He doesn’t want to only be Cap to Tony. “Call me Steve,” he says.
Steve moans, starving for it like people yearn for addictive ambrosia that stopped working on him ages ago. Each touch is electrifying and heated and Steve can’t quite help the sense of urgency that slips into each motion, driven by desperation.
orders,” he amends, then laughs faintly. This isn’t the time for comfort. “You were really good at following my orders, Cap.”
“I don’t understand,” Steve says softly, after a while where they just chat about random things. “You have misplaced faith in me. You don’t need my belief in you. I don’t—I’m not all that great, Tony.”
“Oh, yeah. Cute, but that’s where you’re wrong,” Tony cuts in. It feels good to surprise Captain America. “Of course it’s all me. He gave me a little nudge to start my plans, that’s all. The Purple Man is nowhere near smart enough to orchestrate any of this.” He waves a dismissive hand. “C’mon. You really think anyone else can fix the world in less than a week? The Purple Man has had his magic tricks for how long now? If he could’ve, he would’ve done it without me.”
“It’s fine,” Tony cuts in quickly. “I felt weird, too.” Steve nods. “It was the rift, it interferes with thought. I completely forgot that I was there to fix the rune.” He sighs. “I’ll—I’ll set some protective waves to counter the thought interference next time.” He looks out dubiously. “If the snow clears. I’m not really digging the cold.”
“Aren’t you supposed to know?” Tony asks, raising his eyebrows. “Howling Knight of ye olde days, taking down evil sorcerers left and right. Back when magic wasn’t accepted, huh.”
“I’m fine, though,” Tony points out. “I do have J. A few bruises ain’t a flesh wound.” He grins, waving his very present limbs. “Plus I’ve got you, Pep.”
“We’re going for something more family friendly these days,” Fury says. “We prefer law enforcement agency.”
“That’s impossi—” Tony cuts himself off. “Not impossible. Okay, I see what you’re doing there. Do you think you’re being cute, Steve?”
Tony stares at him for another moment. Whatever Tony finds makes his lips twitch up, hostility clearing off his face, and now he just looks tired. Exhaustion covers him like a blanket now. “Sure, okay. Well, I look forward to having your shield,” he says, then huffs out a laugh. “Really, you wouldn’t be interested.” He conjures up some light and turns back around, gesturing for Steve to walk over. “It’s just something to help people without magic interact with the magic-driven world around them. Nothing that shouldn’t already exist.”
“Not real,” Tony tells it, because that’s better than saying yes or no. He’s always been better than Steve at lying, maybe he can believe himself this time. He supposed that doesn’t matter, though. As long as he convinces Steve.
“SHIELD,” Bruce mutters, not looking happy. “SHIELD had the shield, Tony?” He sounds concerned. “Really?”
“Jeez, you’re right,” Tony says, raising his eyebrows. Curious. That’s what that expression is. “But I don’t think Odin can hate me more now that he’s dead, so I think I’m safe.”
He can’t remember how exactly they got Tony to wake up. It might involve Clint and an arrow. He supposes it doesn’t matter.
Wanda narrows her eyes at Tony. “Official files miss a lot of things. Things people like you don’t care about.” She shakes her head. “What are you doing here?”
Tony twitches. “Alright, fine. Well, I’m headed to Asgard to find out what they know there. You can stay put somewhere. Don’t get lost, Dorothy.”
Tony moans, closing his eyes and sinking down as low as he can. Everything cools down gradually. He inhales deeply.
“Yeaaah, it’s still not iron, Thor,” Tony says. “I’m not looking to fight anyone who forges with iron, that’d be unfair to them. But we’re not fighting faeries these days. I’m not even financially partnered with the fae, there’s literally no connection, why would I use iron?”
“Not precisely,” Loki says, a hint of something Steve has never heard in his voice, but it makes the entire room’s signature darken. “It is the other way around. Asgardian runes look like this one.”
Tony thinks about Stephen Strange’s words. He thinks about the Tony Stark in that other universe, the one who may have saved the world.
Tony blinks at him, gives him a noncommittal shrug and nod. “It’s fine,” he says. “He isn’t so bad.” He sounds amused at that. Fond, like he appreciates it, which Steve did not expect. “Right, Cap? Not gonna recite this verbatim to SHIELD?”
Steve opens his eyes. “Okay,” he says, sitting up, and brings his hand to Tony’s chest, carefully. He doesn’t want to hurt Tony, he knows his touch can be unpleasant for magic users. Cold, nullifying. He brushes the arc reactor, feels it pulse like a heartbeat.
Everything seems too much and not enough after Afghanistan. Too much air to breathe, not enough to make Tony feel safe.
This is what heartbreak looks on Steve. It looks… familiar, but it can’t be, because Tony doesn’t have a single memory of this. He sifts through the memories of countless (that’s a lie, he knows exactly how many—forty-two, forty-two) people who knew Steve for much longer than Tony, and none of them have seen this expression.
“You have got to be joking,” Tony says, jaw dropping. “Tell me this is some new brand of joking. They haven’t appeared in a thousand years. They aren’t supposed to exist.”
Tony kisses Steve again, and this time Steve kisses back, opening his mouth and meeting Tony’s tongue. Tony continues rutting against Steve, hands moving greedily to touch more, fingers hooking in Steve’s pants.
No... He needs to make sure. He doesn’t like looking at his reflection, but he needs to know if he’s in control right now because he doesn’t fucking feel it.
“Tony,” Steve says, and the Captain America voice is still going strong but he can’t hide his distress. He can’t hide that he knows exactly where this is going, he’s clever and they know each other too well for him to not guess. “I know this isn’t you. I believe in you.”
Tony wishes Steve won’t try to catch Tony when he’s falling. “Still. It was mine, and I thought about it.” He glances at Steve, exhaustion tinged with growing fear, because how does Steve not see the problem with what had happened? “A lot more than I should’ve.”
“We’re lucky. The timing is good. We’ll wait till the Veil fades,” Steve says. “Until then, even I can’t contain the Aether.” Only when the Veil fades will Steve be able to do it.
Tony’s eyes flutter shut for a moment as he leans into Steve’s hand. “Has to be good for something, right?” he murmurs, and smiles at Steve.
He doesn’t want this. It’s not fair, Steve should still be here. But pain and death don’t have to be fair or right or make any sense. Sometimes it just fucking sucks.
He has taken the iron from his blood and made a suit, armor that is supposed to protect and not attack, but it was only ever supposed to be from his own blood, not from others. The world shouldn’t have had to pay. The armor shouldn’t have to protect the world from himself.
“Why do you think that,” Wanda says slowly, eyes uncertain, and she looks strikingly young. Steve wishes he’d been summoned more, wishes he’d been able to save her, wishes she didn’t have to save herself.
Tony wills his armor to come back around him when Bucky changes his stance and attacks, and Steve catches his blows, each hit sparking red and orange in the white backdrop, the colors clashing violently. Steve moves so fast, so amazingly fluidly, each motion so heavy that Tony can sense the impact reverberating in his core. But with each time they cross, they seem to flicker out of existence.
Steve knows this is a bad situation. He wouldn’t have been summoned otherwise. It takes a lot of energy to summon a Knight.
Steve smiles, holding a hand out before the mystical animal. The griffin inclines her head, makes a soft purring noise, allowing him to touch. Steve brushes her head gently.
In the end, Tony can do everything except this, except save Steve, because his magic is too unstable, too broken, and he should’ve spent more time trying to fix that damn shield.
Steve stares up in astonishment. He eyes the side of the tower, follows the sleek lines upwards. He’s willing to bet that Tony Stark is on the highest floor, where his name,
Tony reaches out slowly, tracing Steve’s mark with a finger. “It’s why SHIELD trusted me to be on the team,” Tony says shakily. “They didn’t say it, but that’s why. They rejected me until you woke up.” He drags his eyes up, tears in his eyes. “I guess you deserve to know why, right?”
Steve pulls back, doesn’t meet Tony’s eyes, stares down at the captivating, glowing blue in the dark, where their breaths tangle together, and sense bends to desire. He thinks if he looks at Tony right now, he might break, might ask Tony for too much.
Tony is alone, lying down in a pool of blood. Endless red. Endless red. He barely has the energy to feel anything other than a mute, hollow anguish.
Then, Bruce looks towards Steve, turning uncomfortable as his eyes take in Steve’s armor. “Uh. Tony, that’s… that’s dragon scale.”
When Tony closes his eyes, sometimes his body feels like it’s still there, underwater. Under somebody else’s control.
Tony briefly considers using the mark to garner sympathy and support. The world recognizes Captain America. His soulmate must, then, be in the public’s favor.
“It’s supposed to be fine. The arc reactor is supposed to—“ Tony takes a shuddery breath. “Fix it. It’s supposed to fix it.”
This is the first time someone hasn’t recognized Steve. Maybe that’s a good sign, but Steve doesn’t feel very good about it. He’s not in his armor right now, after all, and his shield is safely stored away. It makes sense that Wanda wouldn’t recognize him. He opens his mouth to answer, he’s not sure what exactly, but Tony cuts him off by resting a hand on Steve’s arm, rather suggestively.
“Oh. No. I can fly,” Tony says. “Don’t need wings when you’ve got anti-gravity magic.” He wiggles his fingers and hops off the ground, effortlessly hovering in the air.
“And much more genuine than most humans I’ve met. I spoke with him on the elevator coming up,” Steve says cheerfully.
“Don’t waste my time. Show me your wrist, kid.” Howard, previously uninterested in Tony’s soulmate (uninterested in Tony, period), is wary of Tony’s reaction. He grabs Tony’s left hand, eyes narrowed.
. Never seen him like this. There was one thing Steve, even after all those years, never gave away. None of the hearts Tony had devoured, none of them had seen this before. Tony prefers the bang. In a bang, Tony can drown everything in screams and shouts. In silence, Tony can hear Steve’s heart crack.
“I heard what you said, by the way, with the florist,” Tony says, clearly going for nonchalant. “All of it.”
The echoing in the cave seems to be growing louder. Steve hears a stream of water flowing, deepening until it feels like the cave is submerged under cold water, sound waves altering.
“Who’s doing the pulling apart?” Steve asks, watching Tony examine the rune thoughtfully. “It’s not SHIELD.”
“One, he's not exactly going to waste time haunting me. Two, aw, is the Captain scandalized?” Tony smirks, conspiratorial. “Don’t worry, I’ve said it to his face before.”
“It’s not good to chase ghosts, Steve,” Tony tells him, kissing Steve. He tastes like loneliness and desperation and, on the bad days, he tastes like hope. When he takes him, Tony can (almost) forget about those dreams, because they never happened, not really.
Tony bares his razor sharp teeth in a grin, doesn’t miss the way Steve’s gaze catches on them, the way his jaw tightens as if he’s guilty, the way Steve hardens even more as if he enjoys the danger, needs it (needs Tony) to feel alive. “No. Of course not,” Tony says. “I know
“Nothing pitiful about you, Steve,” Tony says with a dismissive wave of the hand. “Anyway, I’m sorry I made you uncomfortable,” he adds, like it’s nothing. Maybe it is, to him. Maybe it’s just a funny idea he thought of. Tony’s eyes dart over to see his reaction.
Tony Stark’s lips twitch into a mocking smile and he laughs. “Oh, no. Sure, contracting with a soul trapped from the past, giving them time from your life to lengthen theirs. Blood magic,” he says bluntly, as if it’s not taboo these days. “They don’t call it that, obviously, not when SHIELD uses it. Fury’s all about what looks nice on a brochure. But that’s still what it is.”
The worst part about the sometimes is that—it’s only sometimes. After they work together a few times, Tony appears to have proven himself. Or whatever. The precious times when they aren’t fighting, Tony delights in making Steve smile and laugh. When Steve isn’t the perfect super soldier, when Steve (
Steve doesn’t like the sneer in Tony’s voice. It seems to run in the family, but Steve has never experienced it directed at him. “I’m summoned when I’m needed.”
“I’m dying, Steve. Maybe—maybe Hydra is right. If we go surrender, they can change me so I can be human. We can be together.”
Tony doesn’t ask his dad to stay. In fact, he moves out. He doesn’t wait to be kicked out. It’s all about initiative, isn’t it?
Steve blinks, surprised at the sense of life he feels. That’s what was strange. The suit feels like it has something sentient running it, but not with something quite like human mana.
He could still be in a lab. That would’ve been better. At least then he has an excuse for being a monster—has other people to accuse.
“Tony. It wasn’t you. Not… not just you,” Steve says finally. He’s powering through this, hoping Tony will answer, will meet him halfway, but there is no halfway. Not on this path.
By the looks of it, it’s not his vacation destination. Tony sounds like he never wants to go there again.
not yours,” Tony says with a sneer, then bites his tongue but it’s too late. He never could shut up, he’ll have to learn to shut up when it matters.
“How did you know I was here?” Steve asks. He’s not especially surprised, but he is curious (impressed). When he makes the effort to hide his presence, usually people don’t sense him. He doesn’t have a signature, after all, and there are no reflective surfaces from which Tony can see him.
(Tony could’ve died, could’ve stayed evil. Steve couldn’t risk that, not when there was still more he could’ve done.)
Tony’s lived so much of life, this is just going to be one more thing on the list of what he’s done. Steve doesn’t want to just be a name to Tony, but being more than that to him when Steve knows that it’s a one-way trip for Steve, it seems too cruel.
“Yeah, of course you did,” Tony says. “It’s always for the world.” The bitterness in Tony’s voice hurts because Steve knows it’s a double-edged sword, and Tony bleeds, even behind all his shiny armor. He’s just as vulnerable as Steve pretends not to be.
Steve tenses. “You’re using her. As transportation,” he says, turning to Tony. He doesn’t mean to be accusatory, but he doesn’t get the tone right, too alarmed by the unexpected scene. He instantly regrets the words when he sees the dismay that Tony hides almost as soon as it flickers on his face. It’s like watching the glow of fireflies fade in the night, soft enough that there is no afterimage when it’s left, so he almost doesn’t miss it when it’s gone.
It’s just one night. Steve doesn’t have time for more than this, anyway. He doesn’t think he should. Once is enough.
“Oh, good Captain. It’s nothing bad,” Thor says, sounding pleased. “He shows affection in such a manner. I myself have been stabbed thirty-seven times.”
“You’ve been here before though, right?” Tony asks. “You were here when the library went up in flames. What’s that like?”
Steve says nothing, responds in silence, as if nothing matters anymore. He sees nothing left to fight for. Steve is much more terrifying than Tony. He’s human. He deepens the bruising, rage fueling their touches and bites until everything aches. He kisses Tony painfully hard like he’s drowning, and Tony moans, shudders, laughs brokenly in return because he knows exactly who started the flood.
“Well, no need to generalize like that. I’m pretty sure the kids who make spoons bend aren’t dangerous.”
He wonders if Wanda can sense the stone’s presence on Earth. Grief is a good motivator, but it also clouds the mind. He hopes she can’t. He hopes she won’t find out Tony has ever had it like this.
In the glint of the reflection of Steve’s shield, he catches a glimpse of shadows. He tilts it out of Tony’s line of sight.
People think about the Captain all the time. They think about how the Captain saves the day, how the Captain is mysterious and strong. They see what the Captain is, what he can offer them. They don’t listen, never stop to think about the Captain’s why, much less talk to him about it.
This will hopefully be enough to stop the truth, and he won’t be able to take it back. It’s an excuse Tony knows Steve will let him have, even if he might know this is a lie. Steve cares too much to do otherwise. He’s a good person. He doesn’t deserve Tony. Even if he thinks he wants to choose Tony now—
“Huh. Alright.” Tony makes a face. “You’re right, you know. The rune war really did mess magic up. It’s so dangerous now.”
Steve catches him by the arms as Tony runs his hands over Steve’s naked chest. His touch is much gentler than his voice, which is hoarse and sharp. “Hey, Tony,” Steve says.
“I guess it was that easy for you to shake me off too, huh. Y’know what, I think I’m fine with being happy for once, Steve.”
“You don’t look like you’re healing right now,” Steve says dubiously, worried. Worried. Tony doesn’t believe him. Humans are supposed to be cruel and heartless. Humans made Tony into the monster he is, after all. Tony signed up for this, but this was never his design.
“Some choice that was. You can't break the contract,” Tony continues, not letting it go, like he’s trying to prove a point, just trying to be right.
“We’ve used summons like this,” Fury says, reaching up to take off his eyepatch. “You hesitant, Natasha?”
“Yes. We understand,” Wanda admits, fingers fluttering. “Magic wouldn’t have any limits.” She swallows, guilt heavy on her face, but doesn’t look away from Steve. “I’m sorry. I want to make things right again. I thought it would be enough to wish for the wish to be undone, but is not enough. I—I don’t have the power to nullify the Aether.”
(There is nothing left to say. The only person in the entire universe he wanted to convince is gone.)
In the end, Tony’s not sure what convinces himself to not manipulate the world using Captain America.
“That’s not—You’re not the only weapon. He forced you, and all of us, to believe it was a good idea, but you knew it wasn’t. That’s why you never do anything like that when you’re you,” Steve reasons. “You’re a good man. And we’re the Avengers, we stick together. If one of us falls, we catch them. If you fall, I’ll catch you.”
Tony tenses, hand twitching before he tries to withdraw it. Steve raises his own, holding it there. Tony doesn’t look at him sharply, but Steve feels Tony’s magic shrink away, almost like it’s trying to seem less powerful, even as Tony straightens up and is probably about to say something stupid.
People aren’t very good at that. Steve swallows. “I’ve slept nearly a century,” he says. “That’s more than enough.”
Steve’s hand darts up to grasp Tony’s arm immediately, but he doesn’t grip too hard. They’ve sparred, they’ve fought, with and against each other. Steve knows that Tony is hardly fragile—but he also knows that Tony is breakable, not invincible. Saying something does not make it so. He’s seen Tony fall.
“That’s sad, Steve. Mourning someone while they’re still alive,” Tony says. “Knowing the inevitable. Having to accept it.”
“Well,” Tony says, “that’s not normal.” Steve can feel Tony’s arc reactor reacting to the mutated magic in the air around them. His signature struggles to stay steady, betraying how rattled he feels, being not in control of his magic.
“Legacy,” Tony says, and grins, all teeth. “Yes. What a legacy, Cap. SHIELD ensures that the world stays broken, you know. You shouldn’t be so quick to idealize anyone.”
It’s a delicate enough story. It occurs to Steve that probably no one can remember her because no one is taught about her in the first place. She wouldn’t be, not with the way pixies have been regarded as untrustworthy and whimsical for a very, very long time.
Tony doesn’t look embarrassed, but his words rush out in a way that makes Steve feel like he is. “Yeah, no, it’s fine. I forgot,” he says. “You don’t know this stuff.”
He could stay here. It would be easier to lie down, close his eyes. Sleep without intending to wake up.
Then again, he doesn’t feel like Iron Man is a commonplace look either. It looks vaguely out of this time. Too shiny. Too bright.
Tony presses his lips against Steve’s skin, an obvious kiss. His lips are cool against Steve, who radiates heat. God, he’s hungry, and cold. His breathing grows fast, erratic, and he moans at the thought of all that he’s going to do. Desire overwhelms.
Once, Tony would say it’s because he’s expendable, that he would deserve it. Once, he would say it’s because he’s the only one capable of doing it. Once, he said he would rather cut the wire.
It’s hard because Steve Rogers really is a good man. Tony digs deep and pokes at his buttons and wants Steve to finally
In the baths after: he practices, you see. Water on skin, sinking into it. Sink past the nose, the eyes, the hair—feel the heaviness of the water. Sink a little deeper each time and hope it will wash away the freezing sensation of drowning.
“Hey, now. If you say it’s not my fault, though it sorta really is, then it’s completely not yours, Cap,” Tony says, even manages a smile, hey, he should be proud. He plasters it on so there is some more distance between them. He hates doing this, especially when he wants Steve to care (Steve cares), but he can’t always get what he wants.
They meet anyway. Steve finds him, apparently because he knew Howard and Fury thought it would be a good idea for them to meet.
This is all very messed up. Steve is the one comforting Tony, and not the other way around. Tony’s lips curve up wryly, but he can’t maintain the empty smile for long, not around Steve who looks pained, brows drawn together. Tony has that effect on the people around him. He grimaces and puts a hand to his head.
Tony shouldn’t have tried to look for anything in Steve. Steve doesn’t know if there’s anything worth finding, and what Tony will see—it’s not something he’ll like.
“You’re supposed to be there too!” Tony’s mask drops down, which isn’t wise, because Tony isn’t immune to the raw mana in the air right now that the Aether is messing the world up. Human skin is prone to being hurt by it, and Tony is very human.
“Mixed in some interdimensional place,” Steve says, wondering if Tony knows of her sacrifice. Steve doubts it. History always seems to prefer Steve, prefer the one who they can point at and say,
Tony pouts. Steve is not imagining it, Tony Stark is actually pouting right now, and Steve wants to feel irritated, but the irritation evaporates when he realizes Bruce appreciates Tony’s blunt casualness towards what must’ve been a terrible experience. Steve is conflicted, unsure how to feel, uncertain why there’s a bloom of warmth inside his chest. Bruce is dangerous. Maybe not like Loki is, but Bruce’s signature is unstable.
Steve twirls it in his hand. It seems to turn to white smoke when he breathes on it, lost with the long exhale into the air. He reaches out with a hand, trying to catch the trace of magic, but it fades away into the night.
“Boring?” Tony asks incredulously, looking at him. “Steve. No. Of course not. You’re… you’re not boring. And, I mean, retold history is kinda an illusion too.” He waves a hand, creating a false flame. “It looks warm, but…” he clasps his hand over Steve’s. Steve feels the magic from the illusion splash into his palm like flames, but his hand is cold. Tony’s hand is warm, though, and even with the hot spring around them, Steve feels him very strongly. The heat is nice. “It’s not really there, is it? The truth is always somewhere else. And I want to hear about you, too. From you.”
“Well,” Tony says, trying to think about more important things. Did they secretly have advanced technology in the forties? Have Tony’s kind of tech? AIs? No. Definitely not. Maybe he should check later. “Sure, Captain. All the better to discern me from my dad.”
Steve supposes he’s not wrong. He lets the quiet set in for a moment. He’s surprised Tony doesn’t break it, just lets his tinkering fill what otherwise would be the silence between them. Maybe Tony didn’t gravitate to magic because he had time to fill, but because magic is what he loves.
, even as the other half dies inside when Steve says, later, “Take away that suit of armor, what are you?”
Tony falters, then resumes. “I’m sorry you don’t have control over it, Steve,” he says. “Nobody has a choice, I know. But you don’t have to go risking your life for me like that. Seriously. It’s cool.”
“I got no hits on this rune,” Natasha says, careful to not touch the drawn rune. Even though it’s supposed to be inert, with no mana imbued into it, it still might react to the mana that flows under skin. Runes aren’t meant for human use. “It’s completely new.”
“It got me this,” Tony says, shrugs, splitting the fruit with a clean crack. He hands Steve half of the fruit. “Phoenixfruit, firefruit, whatever you want to call it.” Steve watches in astonishment at how the negativity seems to have slipped off him like he’s immune (or has learned how to be used to it). His eyes dance with delight when Steve nearly drops the amber fruit when the fruit rumbles. “You’ll like it! Or hate it. Either way, your reaction will be great.”
“SHIELD seems to have done fine without me,” Steve comments, thinking of the few he’d had the chance to meet.
Tony takes a few steps away from Steve, doesn’t let them touch. Steve shouldn’t feel the need to comfort Tony after what Tony has done to him.
Tony looks up at Natasha, struggling to feel surprised, but somehow isn’t. “What, you and that Bucky have a long and sordid history?”
“Too much to lose,” Tony replies smoothly. He leans up to kiss Steve again, roughly, and he thinks one of them has drawn blood, like copper, like rust. “Why would I risk it? But it’s fine. I have you now.”
“The impossible is made possible,” Steve says, thinking of crimson waves crashing against itself, flowing and dark and alive. “They say the Aether is what wrote the universe.” He looks at Tony. “Do you think you can undo the rune so it stops making the Aether change reality? So it reverses the world to before?”
“Nah,” Tony says. His eyes linger on the art, catching on the strokes of sad reds and lonely yellows for just one moment. It’s haunting, almost like Tony is seeing the ghost of what he’s done. “Tell Pep to deal with all art related matters from now on.”
Natasha looks straight back at him and arches an eyebrow. “If I didn’t know you, I’d say you were desperate, ser.”
“I’m starting to think you’re only after me for my shield,” Steve says. “I fought with them, you know.”
Wanda assures Tony it’ll be fine, which shows how not fine everything is, if Wanda Maximoff of all people is telling him that and handing him a ghost-whisperer.
After they exit the palace, Tony says, “Well, nice knowing you, Cap, but I guess this is where it ends.”
Steve finds himself missing the Asgardian mead. Everyone else always goes for the golden apples, but…
For awhile, he hides it from his father. Not that it’s hard, since Howard’s not exactly there much. And no—he’s not
“Well, we strive to break records every day, Captain. Make the impossible possible,” Fury says. “Make some possibles impossible.”
It’s very odd, Tony directing that at Steve. He doesn’t know how to react. “It’s always history,” Steve says.
“Good to hear you say that, glad you can appreciate it when you know gold can’t buy everything,” Tony says, sounding somewhat amused, but it sounds forced, like there’s something more fragile in his voice that he wants to mask. Worry, Steve thinks. “Not in this economy. Everyone’s after diamond these days.”
Tony smiles at him brightly, then looks away with an almost wistful laugh to himself. He takes a bite of his half, chewing. Steve watches him swallow.
“Ser,” Natasha echoes, tightening her jaw. Unsurprised, because Fury’s had a soft spot for Stark for a while, but the Knight? She doesn’t question Fury often, not directly, because she’s had a lifetime of fighting SHIELD already. She only runs the occasional recon op behind his back when he turns to his blind side, and in return Natasha closes her eyes when Fury asks for Natasha’s infiltration and secret-keeping magic.
“It is quite pretty,” Tony says. “Just like pixies, I do like pretty things.” He sends Steve a flirtatious look.
Tony can’t say no now that Steve’s downstairs, so he lets him up and stares at him and thinks about how all this time (all his fucking life) he thought Steve Rogers was dead, and Tony never even had the right to mourn because Steve Rogers wasn’t his, he was always Captain America, hero to the
Not all of it, though. He’s sure that Steve doesn’t know everything. Steve doesn’t know how Tony became a mermaid, nor why he was there sharing Steve’s cell. He doesn’t know why Tony is here right now.
Steve’s expression falls. He can’t manage a smile here, not anymore. “It’s just pretend,” Steve says. “I understand.”
“You’re injured,” Steve says, widening his eyes. He shifts over, closer so he can examine the wounds on Tony’s palms. The metal of his gloves had been broken through. “Magic lesions?” he asks, confused. Those are very rare, only happen to weak sorcerers. “Can your body not handle the stress of magic—”
“Until it isn’t?” Steve asks, then shakes his head. “My time is—it’s borrowed. Not mine,” he says, pulling his hand away from Tony’s. “I’m a man out of time. What I have, it’s all stolen. It’s their sacrifice. Fury is doing this because he feels he must. His life is being drained for my soul to be here.”
Steve jerks back and he opens his mouth to speak, stunned, but Tony doesn’t let him, holding him there with a hand gripping his neck, leaning up to press their lips together. Steve makes a wounded noise, dropping the shield with a clang, opening his mouth, and someone in the room laughs, laughs, and Tony thinks that might be him, too.
“I bet you’re regretting you saved me now,” Tony says, surfacing slightly from the water, enough so he can talk. Fuck, he missed the water, as sick as this is. Nothing good comes from this.
He wonders how close and how often Tony Stark had come to saving the world, just to fail in the end. Perhaps Strange is hoping this will be that second time he will finally make it.
Steve looks disappointed, more reserved than before. Is it the smile? They haven’t known each other long enough for Steve to expect certain things out of him, yet he does. “I’m going to go check on some leads, try to convince a few old friends. You’re free to go,” he says. “If you want. I can’t put a leash on you like they did. It’s wrong.”
“We don’t know where. We’ve contacted Asgard, they say they’re experiencing very mild, but similar, occurrences.”
“What do you want,” Tony says breathily, “what can I do for you?” His eyes are hooded, blown dark with desire. He’s been worth the wait, a night with him is worth another forever, but they’re not going to get either of those. He kisses down Steve’s chest, dipping down until he reaches Steve’s stomach, teasingly low. He licks the inside of Steve’s thigh, making Steve gasp and moan his name.
Steve looks at Tony like they have known each other for far longer than just three months, and he’s rattled by some of the things Tony says about himself sometimes. Things that aren’t even lies, and Steve looks like he doesn’t think they’re true. It pisses Tony off, because it’s impossible. Tony has been Hydra his entire life. All of the memories that he’s stolen corroborate that fact.
“Hey,” Steve murmurs, running his hands over Tony comfortingly, seeing him lost in his guilt-ridden thoughts again. “Why do you always insist on doing this alone?”
Steve had been warned, but he still expected something better from Tony Stark. Howard had been very different from this. Howard didn’t think the contract was much of a problem. “As long as I’m needed,” Steve says, “I see no reason to.”
Sometimes, Steve looks at Tony with such aching longing that Tony thinks he must be seeing somebody else, someone he has actual history with. But Steve always dreams with Tony’s name on his lips, and looks haunted when he wakes, as though he thought Tony had gone off and died somewhere.
He doesn’t. He’s always wearing the suit, and he has no need to touch Captain America—who isn’t his. He refuses to be owned, because he’s had enough of being thrown away.
Tony flinches. He runs his hands in water, splashes it on his face. It’s cold. It needs to be colder. “You know me better than to say that, J,” Tony says, and is thankful that JARVIS remains silent at that.
Tony doesn’t throw any offensive spells at him. He doesn’t look particularly surprised by Steve’s appearance, which means his security must be better than he’d let Steve believe.
Instead of baring his heart (who had ever said he had one?), Tony says, “Okay, I got business to do. Chop chop, was nice meeting you. Jarv will show you the way out.”
It’s not that resynchronization isn’t possible. It’s the idea that it is possible that terrifies Tony. He can’t let that happen, because he knows that if he has to choose between the world and Steve, well, it isn’t much of a choice.
“You have more control. You always get to know who summoned you, Steve. That itself is the price you pay,” Bucky says. “I don’t.” He shrugs, a trace of pain and guilt in his eyes, and Tony watches as Steve’s face contorts with pain and regret.
Steve coughs, but doesn’t deny it. “That’s the All-Father you’re talking about,” he says, tapping below one eye. “He can supposedly see us, even from Valhalla.”
Steve lets out a laugh. He widens his eyes at what they walk upon when they enter the busy streets. They are completely packed with people. Flowers dance through the skies, riding the gentle breeze. Steve smells warm noodles. For the first time in a long time (a lifetime), he registers his hunger.
“You ask me why I have faith in you, it’s because I know you can do it,” he says. “You’re stronger than some red mass of concentrated magic.”
“You must lose that which you love most.” Thanos looks to the horizons, where the skies burn. The blood never ceases. This is Thanos’ legacy. This is the legacy Tony never wanted. If Tony gets the stones, he can undo everything. “I respect you because you don’t make the same mistake twice. The one I never stop making.”
Steve looks at the swirling red, at the pure darkness in the Rift, an abyss that will suck in Tony and reality with him if Steve fails. “I need to,” Steve says.
He doesn’t expect Tony to hone in on his words so doggedly. He should have. “What?” Tony looks at him. “What happened? Where’d your usual positive attitude go. Was it stolen by an emotion-selling pixie?” His lips quirk up, but the smile doesn’t quite reach his eyes. “Because if so, I am so hiring whoever managed that.”
Steve looks stricken. He doesn’t look like Captain America, the hero, or even the soldier. He looks exhausted, pain etched in his clear blue eyes. Part of Tony thinks,
(Where is Thor? Where are the others, they need to be here to disable the Purple Man, they need to figure out a way to do it without hurting Tony—)
“Maybe I shouldn’t. You seem to be fine with watching as the world falls apart,” Steve says, lips curling up coldly. “You have the perfect view from up here.”
“They’re strong, loyal beings,” Steve says. Giselle’s fur is a bright auburn, warm through his fingers. He hasn’t seen one in such a healthy condition in a while. She seems to have a fake back leg, Steve notes. He recognizes the magic signature, it’s incredibly immaculate magic woven together to create something that moves so organically yet has an admirable strength.
Tony wears his lack of soulmark with pride. He shows the entire world a sliver of his brilliance (they couldn’t handle more), lets them see how brightly he shines despite having no markings on his wrists. He dares others to question his abilities, and laughs at the world when he proves it wrong, every single time. He mocks them for their belief that only people with marks are ever good enough to succeed.
Tony’s eyes are bright. He coughs a little. “Yeah?” he asks, briefly forgetting to cover it up with an
Tony gulps in lungfuls of air, staring hard at his reflection in the mirror. His eyes are his own right now, molten copper no longer covered by a cloud of purple, but this does nothing to stave off the fear that’s corroding his mind.
The worst part is—if Tony had the chance, he would do this over the exact same. Even knowing what he knows now... He could. He can.
And what Steve feels—it’s not anger, either. It’s something that takes his breath away, but lets him breathe at the same time. It’s someone. It’s Tony.
Steve walks into the tower, unhindered, the wards slipping off him like water. The thing about a world dominated by sorcerers who think they can build whatever they want using magic is that they never expect someone like Steve, who is immune.
Well, there goes that. Tony is more tight-lipped than he seems. “Do you want me to appeal to your sense of heroism?” Steve asks. He looks at what Stark is working on, but the man seems to keep no schematics outside his mind. Steve doesn’t sense any secret-keeping seals, which had been everywhere in SHIELD’s underground quarters.
He sends Steve a message to meet him on the rooftop. He can’t stop pacing around. Morning has risen, the city bright and awake.
Great men are not always good men. Tony resents the idea that Captain America could possibly be both. How’s he supposed to hate Steve Rogers now?
Steve’s eyes widen. He stares, then growls, “The Purple Man,” glaring behind Tony, and he’s not desperate, not yet, just angry, still thinks he has mind control to blame.
“That’s not an option you would take,” Steve hazards a guess, and by the way Tony widens his eyes, he thinks he’s right. “You know a way to find the Aether, don’t you?”
And say what people may about memory, Steve knows that sometimes just because people forget why something happened in the first place, it doesn’t mean they won’t remember to keep the distrust. People make sides without knowing what they’re standing for. Without caring, sometimes. It’s supposed to matter more than that, isn’t it?
Steve tilts his head, smiling a little despite his weariness. The world always is ending. Every single time he is summoned, people tell him there’s a world-ending risk running around (except for that one time a few centuries ago when he was summoned by accident to clean up a mercenary’s room, and he’s still bemused by that).
The machination in his ear shimmers red, magic pulsing throughout the pieces of armor that Tony is wearing.
“It’s really fucking hilarious, Dad,” Tony laughs when Howard is back from his trip and finally asks, in the most bored tone, what Tony’s mark is.
Howard’s expression ices over. “You can’t even do this one thing right,” he spits. “He’s dead. And who in their right mind would trust someone with a dead soulmate?” He stares at Tony like Tony’s a business competitor, an enemy… like he’s nothing. “I should disinherit you.”
Steve feels a pang in his chest. Why is Tony’s magic broken? Maybe being able to focus on something else will help. “You mentioned Wish magic,” he says. “Magic is about intent, right? The original caster must have Wished for something to come true, and the Aether interfered. So now anything we believe or fear to be true, happens.”
Tony stares at Steve, unblinking. Silent. There’s only the sound of water filling up the tub, and Steve, breathing. Heart, beating. Just the one heartbeat.
“It was already warped to begin with. Face it. Yeah. I ended war by ending peace.” His definition of better was so, so wrong. “I’ve always been the best at making weapons. I’m even better at being one.”
An eyebrow raises. “Are you saying Howard taught me wrong? I believe that, Captain. He taught me a lot of things,” he drawls, looking at Steve with distaste. “I’ve started to learn how wrong he was. So, why are you here?”
Then why isn’t Tony sleeping? Steve wants to ask. Tony probably wouldn’t appreciate that question. If he wants, he must have other people to talk to, like Bruce. Steve isn’t here to make friends.
In one fluid motion, he sits up onto the side of the tub with as little splash as he can. He takes Steve’s hand and, looking up at Steve through his eyelashes, moves it onto his tail where Tony’s thighs would be. He leans close, head at Steve’s chest. He can hear Steve’s heartbeat, he always can. It’s so loud and steady, and always louder when he knows Tony is nearby.
“Mermaids really aren’t as pretty as people think they are,” Tony informs Steve. Steve’s expression is tight, but he can’t feign indifference.
Believing he’s where Thanos is must not have been enough. He thought he could feel the pull of the other stones when he focused, when he dreamed, but...
And Tony won’t die, because he can’t bear the thought of Steve not forgiving him. He just rolls his eyes and says, “I’m just as much a destroyer as I am a creator, Steve. How do you think I’m so successful?”
Only thing that matters is if Steve remembers. Find that out, first. And then, well. Do what he has to do.
Wanda stares at him. She clenches her fists. “Let’s go,” she says to her brother. “We have a Winterveil to prepare for.”
Tony huffs out a laugh, sounding insincere. Steve is hit by the sudden desire to try and make Tony stop laughing like that. “Guess so.”
“I don’t think she’s—“ Steve sighs. “She kept the ghost-whisperers, Tony. She was still caring for them, even though her brother came back.”
“I get it. I know.” Tony sighs and nods, half to himself. “But you could have told me,” he says. “What you were going to do. That was an option. I mean, did that not seem like an option to you?” Uncertainty bleeds into his voice, makes it quieter. “Telling me things?”
Steve feels his heart crack. Of course. Tony could just doing this because he knows Steve is lonely, and the thing is, he’d be right. But Steve has been lonely for a long time, this isn’t just that. This is the sense of finally being with someone he wants. This is him wanting a
“Yeah, I’m. I’m good. It’s just not the typical afternoon news broadcasts I get.” Tony shakes his head. “The breaking news is usually of the newest haircut trend.” He tries to smile, but it’s strained. “Probably mine.”
“I’m going to elect to ignore that. Never did like history class,” Tony says. “Magic is being pulled apart by its seams, and when that happens—it used to be an if, by the way—the code in the universe is breaking.” He draws in the air off-handedly, the metal of his glove expanding to cover his entire arm. He conjures up a red glimmer—an identical copy of the rune, that’s not supposed to be this easy to draw, Steve watches in silent amazement—but Tony isn’t stupid enough to set it. “As much as I hate to say it, we’re going to need more help on this. I was going to leave this to Strange, but he doesn’t deal with the creation or alteration of runes, he just reads them.”
Steve takes a moment to process that. Their suspect seems equally surprised. Tony said he had an idea to make Scarlet Witch underestimate Steve, but…
Wanda gives him a lookover, then looks surprised. Probably by the lack of a signature. Magic nulls have always been rare. Not very welcome. “Who are you?” she asks, less hostile.
“Tony,” Steve says softly, raising a tentative hand. He lets it fall to the side, though, not wanting the touch to accidentally set Tony’s magic off. “You don’t need to do that.”
“I know, I’m not great at making decisions. But you shouldn’t speak, you’re not that great at it either, Steve Rogers. I know it’s stupid to want you to care about me,” he continues. “But you can trust me. I wouldn’t have done anything stupid.”
True. If Tony really wanted, he’d probably have been an even worse villain. There was probably residual loyalty to whatever was right, to Steve. Tony doesn’t know what to do with that.
Steve takes a deep, steadying breath. Tony will be fine. He’s seen and created more of this world than Steve can imagine. Steve’s job right now is to keep it standing.
in nature... Weird. The tree didn’t foretell this, and the tree is a control freak. Funny that Loki should say that, honestly. I guess I’m bumping up my vacation to Asgard to earlier.”
Natasha puts a hand on Tony’s shoulder. Tony tenses. “At least you got to see him die.” Her eyes are intense. It feels like she’s trying to say something true, say something because she actually means it for once in her life. She really sucks at telling the truth, if that’s the case. “It’s a better fate for them than to be living ghosts.”
“Tony,” Steve says firmly, and notices how Tony tenses at the use of his name, eyes widening slightly, “you’re not responsible for fixing everything broken in the world.”
Steve finds that he really hates it when Tony does that. “They said the arc reactor powers your magic. Just like any other crystal,” Steve says. “It’s not any other crystal.”
This is a waste of time. Steve unclenches his fists. He is contracted to focus on ridding the disturbances, on finding and dispelling the mysterious rune. He is not here to fight someone who seems to have been fighting the world since he was born.
Steve brushes a finger over the petal. It’s very soft. The blue seems to shimmer beneath his skin, like mana is flowing through him to it, even though he has none.
“That,” Tony says, “was me being polite instead of saying fuck off. Trial version is over now, though, so fuck off. Go hibernate or whatever it is you do.”
Tony exhales, smiles a little. It’s genuine, but a little too bright, a touch sad, and Steve’s heart skips at the sight of it.
And the world watches, enraptured, because no one has quite flown so high. They all wait for him to fall, of course. Many actively try to shoot him down because they can’t bear someone markless like Tony Stark carving the path to the future. Everybody expects him to fail, telling him he’s worthless, unstable, just lucky to inherit a fortune from his oh-so-generous (ha) father. They tell him he’s undeserving of everything
Steve closes his eyes. “I knew it,” he says softly. When he opens his eyes, they’re dark. “You never defected, did you. Not from Hydra.” Steve is clever enough. He doesn’t need to watch a video of Tony eating Bucky’s heart to figure it out, or a confirmation that Tony has the power of memory absorption. “Tell me the truth, Tony,” he says coldly. He thinks Tony is lying. That voice, Tony doesn’t like (has never liked it) on him, but he sure uses it well.
“You know that’s not true,” Tony says. With a frown, he turns to look at Steve, who looks tired, too. He doesn’t need as much sleep as the rest of them, but Tony doesn’t like seeing him losing it. Now he knows exactly why. “It was all ideas
Tony curls his lips down, but he doesn’t look angry at Steve, more so frustrated by the situation. “That’s not fair on me,” he says.
Tony looks at Steve, tilting his head. He reaches out for Steve’s hand, holds it tightly. Their hands are dry, as if it’s never rained.
But Steve isn’t here for him, barely even looks at Tony before he throws his shield at the Purple Man. Tony frowns and flies to jump on the shield, slamming it down to the floor with a loud bang. He picks it up and narrows his eyes, then tilts his head to the side.
“Why? You didn’t think I would stop, did you? Unless you did something permanent? You should, next time.”
“Give me the gauntlet,” Tony says, but he barely feels himself speaking. These are just words. He is weak. “Or tell me that this world is better without who you love.”
Steve feels disappointed that Tony seems to be just like everyone else, after all, not seeing Steve as trustworthy because he’s magic-immune, as if people always needed to give their Word to keep a promise.
But this is a better world. He gets to have Steve in this world and there’s no war, Tony doesn’t have to be scared they’ll be on different sides.
“Really,” Steve says, smile warming, and he can’t keep these words in. “I like your company too, Tony.”
Tony’s lips curve down. “It’s a one-way trip, Steve,” he says tightly, something hard in his voice, and it takes a moment before his eyes move to search for Steve.
He blinks. His world has shifted, become darker with his transformation back. The gleaming black of his eyes has completely swallowed up the blue, that vestige of his humanity gone. Steve didn’t turn on the lights. Tony’s pretty sure they can both see fine in the dark, though, so he wonders what Steve is trying to avoid. Tony was originally going to shift back after his wound healed, but he thinks he wants to see more.
Tony shrugs, as if it’s not something incredible. “And you don’t even need spells. I bet you had a court magician who waved oak wands around while chanting,” he says, ignoring the unspoken question. Steve really wants to ask why, but there’s something more pressing.
That’s just the problem, isn’t it? It’d be easier if Steve could pretend Tony doesn’t, but he knows Tony too well already for him to believe that Tony is uncaring.
“Sokovia,” Tony says, magic flaring for more than just a moment, radiating something very heavy. It’s clearer, now, no longer suppressed. Steve is more familiar with Tony, he recognizes it, can hardly believe he missed it before. Maybe Steve was trying to not see it. “Why is it Sokovia?”
Tony has to believe he can, just like he believed he held the mind stone, wanted the mind stone so much that it was enough, recreated it completely in his mind based on Shuri’s data, powered his desire through sheer force of thought, and then—it manifested, right there.
