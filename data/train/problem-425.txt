… I…” Speechlessness from Sherlock Holmes? Any man would be flattered, and John was no exception, clambering onto the bed on his knees and watching as Sherlock removed his drawers to expose himself fully, and what a sight he was.
Sherlock watched with interest, he had every intention of attempting to soothe John, but a scientific mind finds stimulation in odd places, and John's panic attack was intriguing on a personal and scientific level. Lestrade was staring at him incredulously, disbelief plastered his face as Sherlock simply watched the events unfold from a distance. Sherlock attempted to warn Lestrade to be wary, he knew touching an army veteran during one of these attacks could be detrimental to your health, mainly your heart's ability to beat. The whispered words of caution were unheeded as Lestrade walked over and placed a hand on John's shoulder. Sherlock sighed at the inherent stupidity of normal people. John's arms already had Lestrade's airways cut off and looked to be on the cusp of breaking his neck when Sherlock stepped in, soothing John with his voice until he managed to pry the hands from around an almost unconscious detective. "Ah. You touched his scar Lestrade." Sherlock said to the coughing Detective.
,’ he concluded, brow furrowed in uncertainty. If the two of them were indeed together, then how would Doctor Watson -
"We have a meeting with Mummy in two days, she wants the whole story of what's happened since Mycroft's. We're bringing Mrs Hudson along so it's easier." John smiled and then rubbed the back of his neck "Yeah we're going to have to meet up with Harry at some stage soon, she eh 'wants to meet the man who turned her baby brother' " Sherlock frowned "I didn't turn you, you just fell for me and I happened to be a man." John shrugged "She didn't really give me the chance to explain, but it doesn't matter anyway, I don't really care what people think anymore, they haven't got a Sherlock to deduce the living daylights out of anyone annoying" John smiled and held out his arm and Sherlock linked them as the walked, pulling on scarves and coats as they went. "What do you feel like for lunch?" John asked as they reached the street. "Angelo's?" Sherlock grinned "Angelo's" John replied with a smile.
Sherlock’s voice cracked, his name an almost sob, and John couldn’t stop his hands from reaching out to soothe, one tracing the line of his cheek and the other drifting through his curls.
"Um. I accept your apology? I'll just get out of your hair… But Mycroft… I… I eh… I do you know." Mycroft was utterly bamboozled. If he was accepting his apology what was he doing leaving? Wrong! Mycroft's brain was yelling at him. "Gregory…what—" Greg screwed his face up and ran a hand through his hair, barking out a mirthless laugh. "It shouldn't be so bloody hard, you know? I told myself that no matter what I would do this but now it's happening… I want you to know even though you hurt me… Must be a masochist… But I'm going to do it anyway, just for you. You could never accept a compliment, or that I would want someone like you, no matter how often I repeated it, you were always going to be too fat, or pale, or
John was drifting through his days, running through the motions like a well programmed machine, but always he wondered if maybe Sherlock would have been open to starting something between them, maybe even to the point where he would be willing to look at John's soul mark, just so they could know once and for all. It was stupid now, having all these ‘What if’s?’ when he'd been in a position to actually find out and had been too cowardly to take the chance.
He felt a bit of a twat actually, for letting this get to him so much. He had known Sherlock wouldn't feel quite so strongly for him as he'd want but having even friendship thrown back in his face hurt. Sherlock was his best friend, but what was he meant to do if he wasn't Sherlock's? "Bloody man can't be conscious of other people and their feelings for one bloody moment." John muttered to himself as he found a bench to sit on, ignoring the man at the other end of it until he realised how familiar it was. "Greg?!" Greg turned to face him with a slight grin. "Alright mate?" John glowered at him. "Just peachy Greg, just peachy. Mycroft?" The replying eye roll was confirmation in itself. John sighed, Sherlock wouldn't like this when he found out in the morning. He didn't know why he couldn't just stop caring what Sherlock might feel even when they were fighting. Bloody man.
The door opening for the second time was his cue to exit, although he was in his jocks because he was not eating breakfast in his dress uniform. He just wasn't. "There had better be breakfast in one of your arms because I'm starved" John said cheerily as he rubbed a towel through his hair and strolled out to greet them. Both Molly and Greg stared. "What?" John looked around, but found nothing. Molly blushed as she answered. "You look um... rather built actually John, don't mind us we're just..." "admiring the view" Greg chimed in with a big grin and John couldn't help but laugh. "Thanks. Hungry?"
“You’re a good man, John, and as a friend I really want to see you happy. I don’t know about you but I believe fate has its ways and we may see Sherlock again soon. Now chin up and help me get the staff lounge ready for Christmas. The day’s almost upon us and unlike most of the staff here, I know how to brighten up a room with Christmas decorations properly,” Paula sighed and led him out of the operating room.
Sherlock pouted as John walked away. Was he deliberately teasing Sherlock with light kisses on his head instead of his lips? Something had to be done and Sherlock knew who to ask.
Eventually Greg left to do his "real job" and left them alone again. When John awoke he looked around and groaned "Are we still here? I'm a doctor, give me the equipment and I can take care of myself at home. I honestly thought you'd have broken us out by now" Sherlock smirked and shuffled off the bed, allowing John to stretch out fully again. "Unfortunately I have to wait at least another day or two before it's even close to being acceptable, Mycroft said the end of the week but I sincerely hope you don't plan on staying here that long regardless." John frowned and tilted his head to the side "A week is too long, let's just go home soon as we can." Sherlock nodded and began reading the paper to John who smiled happily as he listened to Sherlock's voice. Two days passed like that, with Sherlock reading to John and solving cold cases together, watching crap telly and sleeping curled up in one another, falling asleep to the sound of Sherlock's voice. On the morning of the fourth day John woke to find Sherlock pulling on his coat. "John we're going home."
"Excuse me." John thundered in that quiet manner of his that stunned most every one of those torpid women to silence. "I, to begin with, am not a piece of meat to be paid for. I'm not an escort or whatever it is that you're insinuating I am." He took a deep breath in and held out his hand for Cordelia to shake, which she warily did. "The name is Captain John Watson of the fifth Northumberland fusiliers and you would do well to remember it. I'm Sherlock's fiancé. Would you like to dance love?" John asked with a smile and Sherlock took his arm and steered them both away. "Have I told you that I love you?" Sherlock beamed down at him, noting the terrified squeaks from the ladies at their back as one mentioned the fact that John could probably kill them all with his bare hands."You might have mentioned it a few times now yeah."
"Well Annie, what about you? Why pick the justice league?" Anthea smiled wistfully at nothing, remembering. "When I first went to work with Mycroft... Scratch that, too long a tale to tell. Mycroft has always been a genius,
"Later, let's open this now so we can sit down at some point today." Sherlock added as he plopped himself down on the floor in the middle of the pile and patted the spot next to him. John chuckled and sat next to him, rolling up his sleeves and praying no one had sent body parts.
because he didn't trust them) with a child, it was more that he didn't see how a baby, or a child of any age, would fit into the insane life that they had carved out for themselves. Babies needed stability, and routine, and to be fed, and changed, and remain unexposed to dangerous chemical experiments. He loved them both dearly, but it would be a lie to say that the initial idea had sat well with him.
The clack of the umbrella faded into the distance and Sherlock was left alone once more. He felt drowsy, but because he did not know whether that was due to the conclusion of the case or due to blood loss he would not allow himself to sleep. He was glad he'd foregone his coat that morning as it would have been hellishly difficult to clean all the blood stains out of it. John would arrive soon and Sherlock wanted to look as good as possible to avoid the worst of his anger. That being said it was more difficult that he anticipated to roll onto his back without widening the cut. In the end he simply endured the pain and lay panting on his back.
They witnessed this now; John with his deft fingers as he stitched the wound closed, helping to cover Sherlock in warming blankets and barking out orders as his pulse plummeted once again. When the patient started to seize, John was ready, quickly pushing him onto his side and holding his head steady as his limbs thrashed and rattled the bed.
"I won't say no" Greg laughed, watching as Sherlock followed John's retreating form with his eyes from behind his laptop.  Two lazy minutes passed with Greg leaning his face and arms on the pool edge,  anchoring himself to the shore while Mycroft snook a glance every few seconds until John returned,  a tray of lemonade and  small cakes in his hands.  Greg leapt out of the pool to sit next to the loungers in the shade and gorged himself on the sweet and bitter combination. Washing the cappuccino cake down with fresh lemonade, Lestrade  wondered why he ever did anything else.
The rest of the team lined the benches against the walls of the changing room, waiting for the verdict of the Coach. In general Lestrade punished in two ways: The whole team or one individual. In truth even if only a couple of the lads were punished it still affected the entire lot, they were all good mates and one being down brought the rest down too. Still, everyone sat up straighter when the noise of eight sets of feet began their journey down the corridor. John quickly looked at the guys faces and knew it was a team punishment, they looked genuinely apologetic, indignation would have been somewhere in their eyes if they'd been suspended. "Right." The Coach began, eyeballing the gathered teens with irritation flashing across his face. "These three idiots thought it would be funny to interrupt the lessons of our friendly neighbours at Lobelia Academy of Dance yesterday. Now the principal Ms. Adler offered a deal of sorts, and it was that she wouldn't press charges for the trespassing if you all, that's every one of you, goes to the school during training time and makes an effort, a proper good fist of dancing. I'm going to leave the decision to your captain, because I personally think a run in with the police might knock some sense into these three, but maybe you don't share the sentiment. So. Watson, what will it be?"
Greg was mercifully available, and if he didn't believe before now John was certain that there was a God out there who was perpetually looking down on him. The pub was relatively busy for a Thursday night, being the halfway point between 221 and the Yard made it a frequent stop when John and Greg went out together. The low hum of voices rumbled softly and unobtrusively in the background as he sat at the bar and ordered two pints, waiting for Lestrade who was frequently late for these get togethers. Not that John had an issue with that, on the contrary. Usually this alone time was spent trying to think of things to talk about that didn't involve either of their partners. Not an easy task at all he was slightly embarrassed to admit. Greg trundled in with a weary grin on his face a little while later and John realised with a jolt that they hadn't had a proper non case related chat since... God since before the Moran situation. "Sorry mate, you know how it is" Greg smiled as he sat down and picked up his glass "Ta for this by the way, been so swamped lately I haven't been able to breathe let alone go for a pint. We'd an inspection there last week and I swear to whatever's out there if I have to redo one more bit of shoddy paperwork I'll arrest myself when I murder the rest of them." John laughed heartily and realised how much he had missed this, talking to someone who wasn't five steps ahead all the time, who liked pints and footie and a chat about something other than corpses and other typical case related issues. Still in the back of his mind he was wondering what Sherlock was up to, missing him even though they'd been at each other all day everyday for weeks. God he was getting needy... He shoved those thoughts deep into the recesses of his mind and settled into his stool. "I wouldn't blame you, plus Sherlock would get a real kick out of that. He might even send you flowers for it" John laughed and Greg smiled brightly.
"Morning Sherlock" he yawned into his chest. "Good morning John. We promised Mummy that we" John pressed a finger to his lips "Shshsh. No discussions until I've at least had some tea."Sherlock rolled his eyes and extricated his body from John's octopus arms. Sometimes it was hard to believe he only had two of them, he always seemed to tangle himself around Sherlock. "Come along then John" he called as he pulled on his robe and swept out into the kitchen. John rubbed the sleep from his eyes and stretched, wide awake now he threw on a pair of lounge pants and turned on the kettle bare chested. Sherlock had picked up his violin and was playing, the melody swelling and changing key as he swayed, whole body moving with it. John watched enthralled until the toast popped and kettle boiled and he had to look away. When he had set the table the music stopped abruptly and Sherlock sat down with a contented sigh to sip his tea. "We're bringing Mrs Hudson with us to Mummy's later in case you've forgotten" he remarked over his mug, smirking at John's sleep mused hair and lack of shirt. "Somehow I don't think I could forget the fact that we're taking Mrs Hudson with us. You have told her that though, right?" John shook his head fondly as Sherlock realised his mistake. "MRS HUDSON" he bellowed, she was obviously awake and probably just beginning to make lunch, so late had they slept in.
Sincere apologies for the late late late update, we got really stuck with this chapter, coupled with real life commitments, but we've got the hang of things now :)
The problem he was having with movement and speech was only amplified by the fact that he couldn't see a bloody thing.
Sherlock could feel the cool summer breeze licking at his skin through the open window. The night was silent and the darkness was heavy, a thick blanket that smothered the world. In the end he didn't need to watch. He could still see Sebastian walking through the door, hear himself rush to meet him, feel his heart beating fast in his chest as he pressed his lips to Sebastian's for the first time. He could hear the resounding crack of Sebastian's hand across his face, the taste of salty tears mixed with blood filled his mouth. Sebastian was not yet finished. Sherlock heard the metallic zing of his butterfly knife opening as Sebastian threw him to the ground, growling insults and tearing his shirt apart at the seams, exposing his back. He felt the vibrations of his own quiet screams of pain as Sebastian sliced him with the knife in little jagged bursts. The sound of his laughter echoed off the walls, manic. Sherlock saw himself cowering, pleading, swearing never to do it again. He still remembered Sebastian cutting open his trousers and plunging inside him, he was unprepared and unprotected. Sherlock listened to his own whispers of pain and protest that were unheeded. Blood streamed down his back and Sebastian continued forcing himself into Sherlock, occasionally stopping to pour lemon into the cuts on his back or widen them. Sherlock remembered the disgust and terror he felt when Sebastian had left. He had lain on the floor for hours before texting Mycroft. He did not tell him about the rape. He didn't need to. As soon as it ended, the sequence started up again and Sherlock steeled himself to relive the pain and terror once. He had no choice. He was trapped in his head.
"Are you and him? None of my business but..." he trailed off, wrapping the bandage around again. John looked over at Sherlock and his eyes softened. "Yeah he's mine, best friends and everything." The medical smiled at him and took a pin between his teeth. "So go on. Gush a little, you're dying to, I can tell!" They laughed together and John blushed. "We met through a friend, I was just back from Afghanistan after getting shot and was looking for a place to stay, a roommate. Mike introduced me to Sherlock in a morgue and he borrowed my phone, then asked me whether I'd been in Afghanistan or Iraq"The medic gaped. "Just like that? Had that Mike told him about it or?" John grinned proudly "Nope. He told me my whole life story just like that, knew everything about me from how I looked, held myself, scratch marks on my phone. He asked me to move in with him there and then, and the next day I did. The next few days were a bit different then what I was expecting, He brought me to a crime scene with him, I was kidnapped by his brother who tried to bribe me for information about him- I refused, I texted a murderer, told him what my last words were when I got shot, witnessed a surprise drug bust. That was all before he figured out who the murderer was and then left with him, without telling anyone. I used the gps on a phone to track him down, saved his life and then we laughed about it on the way home." John watched as Sherlock put his head in his hands, knowing that Lestrade had just made him spell everything out for him and yet still didn't understand. The medic was obviously impressed, he hadn't had to deal with Sherlock properly so he hadn't had the chance to see how he acted with anyone but John. "Well that's one way to start a relationship anyway." he laughed and stepped back "You're all done, Your knuckles should heal in a few days anyway so just be careful not to punch anyone until then." John shrugged and thanked the man before walking over to join Sherlock.
A/N IMPORTANT TW! Right this is pretty dark stuff so expect: split personality, drugging, violence, rape and language. If any of this is a trigger for you tread carefully, I WILL POST ANOTHER CHAPTER SO YOU CAN READ THAT.
With all this in mind, Sherlock propositioned John over tea. "From Christmas eve to New years day." John peered at him over the top of the paper "Are you going to elaborate or is this one of those times I'm supposed to be able to deduce what you mean because if it is I don't think you'll be very pleased…" Sherlock rolled his eyes, smirking slightly. "Those are the dates during which we have been invited, or rather ordered, to stay with Mummy. The Holmes Christmas calendar is rather full and utterly dull for the most part, however I've never had a John there with me before so I cannot say with any certainty that it would be the same this time around. We're looking at Christmas dinner with the family, As in Mummy, Mycroft, myself, and hopefully you and Lestrade. Boxing day is for relaxation after the affairs of the day before, and up until New years eve we should mostly be left to our own devices. New years eve is the night of Mummy's annual party and it's a tedious affair filled almost exclusively with vacuous people that I detest and that reciprocate the sentiment. The only people in attendance worth meeting would be my cousins Sherrinford and Aurora and their families." John snickered into his paper. "I can't believe how mad your names are! I have never heard of anyone outside of a Disney movie called Aurora and Sherrinford well that's just… But you like them?" Sherlock glowered and played with the handle of his cup. "Like is not a term I would generally apply, but I suppose in this case it's applicable. They're part of the French quarter of the family so we didn't meet very often, but being of similar age and sharing a dislike of the events we were forced to attend… Yes I suppose I like them." John smiled. It had taken a long enough time to get Sherlock to admit that he considered some people to be his friends, and to know that he had family members, albeit foreign ones that he barely saw, that he liked was comforting. The idea of a young Sherlock being tormented and lonely tore at John's heart even now and if these two cousins offered a brief respite from that he was sure he would love to meet them. "Alright, it's been a while since you spent Christmas with your family anyway" he grinned "plus this will give me the chance to see any baby pictures!" Sherlock groaned and John laughed happily, forgetting at least for the time being his melancholy.
"Alright Sally?" Jim slipped his phone back into his pocket and sat down at the smallest table in the lunch room of New Scotland Yard. "Did you get the texts?" Sally asked, smirking into her chips. "Yeah, sounded pretty urgent but you don't seem busy..." he looked around as if to make sure that she was in fact not busy, and Sally once again found herself agreeing with the freak's proclamation that he was a complete dunder head. "I was busy at the time and so were you. It was a crime scene Jim, we both worked on it until the Freak and his lap dog arrived?" Realisation dawned on him and he nodded, slyly pinching one of her chips. "Alright alright I'm not a total dim wit Sally, what about it?" Eyes darting around the packed room, Sally beckoned him in closer, leaning in until their bodies created a shielded circle. "Well, the freak was rushing about, spewing his voodoo crap while little lap dog was chatting to Greg in the corner right?" Anderson nodded, eyes wide, riveted already. If Sally Donovan knew one thing it was gossip and judging by her excitement this was good stuff. "Ok so he's leaning over for a while, examining the body and complaining when he does that thing where he jumps and runs away screaming something random about gardeners or colours or whatever. Lap dog trots loyal at his heels and that should be that. You know we all keep dusting for prints yada yada yada and it's all normal stuff. This time though, I was the only one left at the scene and when the freak jumped up, something fell out of his pocket.""What was it?!" images of human fingers and bloody knives ran through his head, but nothing prepared him for the shock he got when Sally placed it on the table. "A ring box. The freak was carrying a ring box. Haven't opened it yet, thought I'd wait for you" Sally batted her lashes a bit and shimmied closer still, hiding the box from view. "You gem Sally Donovan! You do the honours." Nervously, fingers tingling, she prized open the box and looked inside. "Well fuck me. He's going to propose?!"
John couldn't help but step forward, lay a hand on his arm in an attempt to comfort him but if anything he seemed to tense up more under John's hand.
"Yoohoo John dear I've brought some tea up!" Sherlock's ears pricked up like a cat's and he stared open mouthed at the elderly woman walking through the door. "Mrs Hudson?!" he exclaimed as John moved out from behind him (He felt the loss rather keenly.) Mrs Hudson nearly dropped her tray when she saw him and had to sit down before she could say anything. "Sherlock what on Earth are you doing here? Dear me you look like you've been through the wars…" John began pouring tea when Mrs Hudson gasped. "We'll need a third cup won't we, I'll just fetch it now" Sherlock made to interrupt the poor woman but before he could get a word in edge ways John had grasped her hand fondly and pressed her back into her seat. "No, I'll get it. I don't want either of you to strain yourselves. Make sure he doesn't try fiddle with those bandages will you?" John requested with an exasperated smile, tilting his head in the direction of Sherlock's stray hand fraying the edges of his bandages. "Why do I get the feeling that I'll have to watch you 24/7?" The statement was laced with such genuine wonder that Sherlock couldn't help but stare at the retreating back of the human who had suddenly forced him to feel, and evidently felt in return. Mrs Hudson gave him a look "I can get the upstairs room ready, that is, if you'll be needing two." She remarked with a coy smile. Rose dusted his cheeks as he realised that he really, really hoped they didn't.
He did not believe in soulmates, that two people could truly be compatible. Instead he believed that emotional attachments represent nothing but a burden, an irrational compulsive need to put someone else’s happiness ahead of his own. Sherlock was well aware of the success rates of marriage between proven soulmates - the numbers were not the least bit encouraging.
. Your idiotic peers may fall for that tripe but I am not about to. Spare me your platitudes and run along, I'm sure you're
On the worst days, those frustrations would spill over to actual tears, and little Sherlock would think it impossible to not be more alone in the world.
He sighed and lay back against the headboard. Maybe they didn't have that type of relationship? What if John got bored and went elsewhere? Sherlock couldn't stand the thought of sharing him. God this was more complicated than all the cases Lestrade had called him for combined. Careful not to jostle John, Sherlock managed to leave John's room and pull on his robe. He perched on the armchair, figuring out his next move.
Their banter continued in much the same fashion for how long Sherlock could not say, but he did not miss the way John's eyes tracked every movement and gesture he made.
John wheezed and coughed, the taste of his own seared flesh permeating his mouth. It always seemed that his dominant hand or arm rather was the one to get injured. First the shooting in Afghanistan and now this, his left arm would be a myriad of scars by the time he died. There was a distinct possibility that the burns wouldn't have time to scar. John was not an idiot, he knew full well that the drowsiness he was feeling would begin to overcome him soon enough, although he had no idea how soon. Time passing wasn't really the big issue. Sebastian tore the metal away from his arm, the skin had molded onto the tag, leaving blackened pieces in the engraving. Sherlock wouldn't like that particular reminder John thought to himself as Sebastian stalked away, tossing the bracelet back onto his chest. There was more coming. He could tell that this was not yet over, Sebastian had an end game in sight and the only way he would let John out of here would be in multiple pieces. John looked up at himself in the mirrored ceiling and wondered if he had looked this disheveled when he'd been shot. Probably.
In the olden days, people had denounced love at first sight as impossible, because for them it was. It took thousands of years of evolution and documenting to reveal the truth of that phrase. It was all in the eyes. There was no real telling signs, colour had a little to do with it but seeing as there were only a certain number of eye colours you could be that helped very little. Sites were set up, showing only pictures of someone's eyes. If they were your soulmate you would know instantly and have to find them, no matter what. As the realisation that eyes were the key to finding the perfect match for you, people made eye contact with almost everyone around them, just in case. It did happen like that too, people would walk down the road and suddenly their soulmate would just be there. John Watson had seen it happen many times. For a while he had searched, just like everyone else, but eventually he gave up, joined the army, protected the bonds people had made with his life against people who wished to destroy them. After all, if one half of a pairing dies the other might as well be because there is only one person made for you, and once they are gone you will truly be alone, a shell of what you used to be, the mark of your soulmate branding you forever.
When he looked up at his parents, both were giving him tender looks. “What?” he asked abruptly, rolling his eyes as they shared a knowing glance.
He had not been himself. Or, to clarify, he had not been the self he had tried for all these years to be. He was, at moment, returning his mind to normalcy and waiting for the information about what had happened to arrive. For about a week now, he'd been more like his university self. Twisted, coniving, self obsessed and above all an empath, for that alone was the way to survive the hellish eternity that was third level education. As with each occasion he attempted to stave it off, or at least be alone. These episodes fell on him in fits and spurts, and had been a recurring theme of his existence since his drug days, locking the man he'd grown to be away in his mind palace to watch any number of horrors unleashed by his own, personal brand of demon. He'd known, it had been too easy, too long he'd managed to keep all of that under lock and key, hiding his ultimate derangement from John, but now, now Moriarty was back, now Mary Morstan had fallen to the wayside and John had returned to him, the carefully oiled machine of his mind was taking over, for what purpose he couldn't say, but he knew one thing was certain. Lying on his bed with no memory as of yet, Sherlock Holmes knew he needed to remaster his transport.
Not-Sherlock crept to the kitchen and reached into the recesses of the drawer of supplies he had for experiments, pulling out a little blue powder and pouring it into the only jam they had - ensuring John would ingest it. Sherlock was starting to get a picture of where this was going, and the drugs that would make John a bit slow and easy to manipulate were giving him a picture he didn't want to see. Still, he had to know. John jogged up the stairs from work, and his eyes wrinkled with the sincerity of the smile he offered at seeing Sherlock out of his room. "You hungry?" John asked brightly and Sherlock watched as Not-Him snickered to himself before turning to John with a bored expression. "No." and then flew to the box of fingers on the table. As he'd predicted, John popped some bread in the toaster, and the kettle on before heading upstairs to take off his shoes and put on some more appropriate clothes to lounge about in. He arrived back downstairs with the precise timing of someone who had repeated this ritual many times before, and the toast was ready when he was. God, this was too easy. Sherlock had gotten too close to John clearly, because now Not-Him could (and had) access to all the vast stores of information he had on John and was using it to play him like a violin. Within a matter of seconds the contaminated jam was in John's mouth and Sherlock was frozen in anticipation of what was to come.
Trust his brother to get himself into mischief on the day of his child's birth (contingency plan D: early labour coming into play. Unexpected.) and end up entirely uncontactable, and in the back of some criminal's van. Married life had changed very little about Sherlock and John, that much had become increasingly clear over the past few months. "Yes, as soon as we have a pin on them, send whatever we have that's fastest. Gregory will be on hand to provide a gentle amount of police escorting, but one can never be too careful when it comes to childbirth." Mycroft ordered, affecting nonchalance while Lucia smiled brightly at his side. It wouldn't do for his other employees to see in, but Lucia knew how to read him, and his excitement was palpable to her.
Kind of a part II-ish for the last one, dealing with the proposal itself as requested, sorry it took forever, had 2 scenarios to make for this and my other fic and I wanted them to be different so yeah
As he pulled up to the gates Sherlock practically flew out of the car to buzz them in, and the open door wafted the unmistakably citrus scent of lemon zest in on the breeze. It was a soothing and familiar scent, one that had always held happier memories of days spent with a much smaller, much more affable Sherlock in the summers of their youth, back when father had been alive and everyone had left them to their own devices, preferring to conduct business, shop or see the opera than chase after their children.
I am quite literally weak at the knees, (although you may be somewhat to blame for that) Nausea, dizziness. Regular symptoms of low blood sugar or orthostatic hypotension. -SH
John could see that Sherlock was struggling to speak. He turned, pouring water into a cup from the pitcher on the side table. He helped prop up a weary-looking Sherlock and brought the cup to his chapped lips. When he was done, he settled back into the pillows and fixed John with that unnerving gaze once again.
Three years exactly. It had been one thousand and ninety five days, each one both blurring into the next in an endless stream of the mundane and lasting for what felt like decades. Sherlock Holmes was a dead man walking, quite literally, while John Watson was simply a man who may as well have been dead who walked anyway. After day one - because suddenly dates and times no longer had meaning aside from when they occurred in regards to the fall - John could no longer call 221b his home, because the one thing that had made it so was now gone. He had moved back to the bedsit against the wishes of one Mrs Hudson who attempted to convince him that staying was the best option, but concluded that he was always welcome to go back and promising not to move anything unless it was in danger of decomposition. She had cried when he left. He had'nt, there were no tears spare, he was saving them for the night, when he could once again see the man he loved in all his glory. People always said that the first day of anything is the most difficult, because it's new and terrifying. This was not the case for John. The worst day was the first anniversary, when he realised he had an eternity of days like this before him, and he would be facing them alone.
, and that to compile whatever else he needed, he had to see John again, somehow. He closed his eyes, inhaled deeply through his nose, and looked at his brother squarely in the eyes.”I can’t quite believe I’m saying this, but you’re right, brother mine. However, if nothing goes the way it should be, rest assured I will tell Mummy about that one time in summer where you-”
only shudder in response. "It's ok Sherlock, you're ok." The words brought little comfort. "It doesn't matter if I'm ok. Are you ok John?" Sherlock muttered softly into John's neck. "I'm right here with you, of course I'm ok, and it matters to me if no one else. Do you want to talk about it? Apparently that helps but I never found it did."
"I've gone for too long living like I'm not alive, so I'm gonna start over tonight, beginning with you and I, when this memory fades I'm gonna make sure it's replaced with chances taken, hope embraced, and have I told you, I'm not going, cuz I've been waiting for a miracle and I'm not leaving, I won't let you, let you give up on a miracle, cuz it might save you..." John sang on and on, getting progressively more confident, staring into Sherlock's eyes by the time he came to the final part of the song "It's not faith if you use your eyes,if you use your eyes, oh if you use your eyes" he trailed off and they sat staring at each other again, wondering if the songs had been about them, hoping the songs were about them. John cleared his throat and his tongue flicked out across his lower lip, and it was all that Sherlock could look at. He shook his head to clear the rest of the images that brought with it and decided to be brave.
The first time everything had simply gone dark but after that he had found himself in a garden. Mycroft's garden to be precise. He would look around and there, sitting with his back to him on the edge of the lake was Sherlock. John would walk towards him and he'd turn around, face lighting up with a bright smile and beckon him closer, patting the grass next to him. He'd get just close enough to smell that smell that was undeniably Sherlock and he'd be back with Sebastian in the dark cell. It probably hurt more than all the beating and torture combined, simply because he had to come back to this. Every time without fail he'd come to and search for the raven curls he had become used to seeing and disappointment would rise again in his throat. He was coming, John knew he was. Am I drunk? John's vision was swimming but not in the same way as it had been before. This felt like he'd been on a bender. Of course. The vodka. It would have had direct access to his bloodstream. Just great.
The knowledge, paired with the overwhelming sensation, sent Holmes swooning, knees buckling beneath him as John caught carried him to the bed, laying him out so he would be comfortable before shedding that final layer and appearing nude before him. Sherlock stared at him with the intensity of focus he reserved for particularly intriguing cases, mouth agape as he processed the new anatomical information he was receiving on John. “Dear God,
“Sociopath eh? What else do you do when you're not running around shooting up?” John said almost casually, folding his arms.
“I'm on my way, no need to shout.” He supposed he should really go, after all it was one of the first Christmases he'd spent with them in a long time. Carefully he replaced everything into the box and hid it again before hopping up, stretching out and making his way downstairs to face the music.
Sherlock sighed. “Yes, I've gathered that John is not quite as unbearable as the rest of mankind but there's no need to read too much into his behaviour. Now kindly refrain from bringing him up again unless there's something
"I" his voice was rough like sandpaper to his own ears from lack of use, from just how wrecked he felt "I love you too." John's lips find his again even as he slips out.
The experiment had concluded a week ago, but cases had been light on the ground the past month or so, The death of Sebastian Moran had left a power vacuum that had exposed many criminal strings in their own civil war to find a new king, but no one out there was anything like Moriarty, in fact the majority could not surpass even Moran's average intellect and that was a sad state of affairs indeed. They'd done his work for him. Dull. At least John too was feeling the strain of having little to actually do, the tension built up in his shoulders would tell nothing to anyone who didn't know John as he did. No one knew John like he did. That was a point of intense pride for him. The tension was mounting each day, and while there was some relief to be found at night (or whenever he felt they could both use a little break, which was more often than he'd like to admit. John never seemed to mind) there was a day coming soon that John would simply explode and Sherlock had no clue what that would entail. For once, however, he'd rather not know. "You need to get out John, you're tense beyond belief and while my...tactics... have been working rather well I am genuinely starting to fear for your health. Go out somewhere." Sherlock pressed, he remembered the John he'd first met, the nightmare riddled depressed military vet with the dead eyes. Never again would he allow that fate to befall his John, and that was seemingly where he was headed. John smiled weakly and looked pointedly at the garish smiley face that adorned their wall, or more specifically the rows of bullet holes that surrounded it. "I think we're both going a bit stir crazy, and I love you, but if you screech your way through another Vivaldi I swear the wall won't be the only thing that has bullet holes in this apartment" He joked lightly and sighed "I have an idea. I'll go out with Greg tonight if he's free, maybe Mike or something if he's not, and you get out to Bart's and do some very disgusting experiments that I will take great pleasure in hearing all about them in the morning. Sound good?" Sherlock's honest smile brightened his face considerably at that and he rushed across the room, planting a sloppy kiss on John's forehead. "For an idiot you are remarkably intelligent John" he murmured and they laughed together, the pleasant musicality of it warming the room substantially, floating down to Mrs Hudson in her living room, making her smile.
John was snapped out of his reverie by Dan’s pat on his back and feeling sheepish at having been caught, quickly handed his present to his colleague.
The ballroom was massive, it took up almost an entire block of the house on it's own but now John completely understood why. Five hundred people is an awful lot to seat and have a dancefloor to accommodate them at once, plus the bar and orchestra, the size was rather necessary. "Jesus" John let out a low whistle as he surveyed the women were dripping with jewels and sparkling gowns that twinkled in the light, and the men wore tailored tuxedos that would put James Bond to shame, even the children were dazzling in their style and suddenly John was glad of his uniform because nothing he owned would ever fit into this crowd. The room had several doors leading out to heated terraces and all were open to let air circulate.
Sherlock awoke the next morning prepared to get Christmas Day over and done with. Rubbing sleep from his eyes, he dragged himself out of bed and into his en suite bathroom, managing to bump into no less than five different objects in the still mostly-dim bedroom, thanks to the heavy curtains drawn to block out the morning glare. Thirty minutes later, freshened up, dressed in one of his favourite suits and curls tamed, Sherlock stepped out into the corridor and straight into his elder brother.
Surprise it's me! I can't believe that there's only 1 left. I think part of the reason it's taken me so long to finish is that I don't want it to be over? It's been years now, and I just don't do well with change I guess... part of me thinks I should finish and post on Jan 1st for the poetic thing but then I'm also like.... maybe I should wait for the kiss though.. Never mind my rambling, this one is such a strange concept, like I was inspired by a really nice pair of socks. Hope you enjoy it, and as always, feel free to hit me up on tumblr @matchingbulletwounds if you do, ~S
They turned, hand in hand, and walked back down the aisle and into the house where they were met by Sebastian and ushered into a sitting room. "Ten minutes sirs and I'll be back to escort you to the reception" Sebastian added as he left, giving both of them stern glances that clearly meant "You bloody better have your clothes on when I get back." John chuckled and Sherlock smirked as the door closed. No sooner had it clicked than John was surrounding him, embracing Sherlock tightly, giddily. Sherlock looped his arms around John and they simply stood there for a while, breathing. Sherlock was first to break the silence. "You got Mycroft's blessing?" he asked and John could here the smile in his voice. "Oh shut up, I'm old fashioned ok?" Sherlock's answering laugh rumbled in his chest and against John's face. "God I didn't even look to see who's here I was too nervous. They did a lovely job of it though, the trees and the flowers and all that, Mrs Hudson and Orabelle, it was really something." John reached up and took off his beret, setting it down on a table and pulling Sherlock down for a quick kiss, which turned into a not quite so quick one thanks to Sherlock groaning "I like this damned uniform almost as much as I like you out of it." And something that sounded like "Bloody military and their bloody uniforms" which did not help the 'keep your clothes on' decree at all. Still, by the time Sebastian did return they had fixed their jackets and were ready to go.
To be frank, John wasn't sure if he wanted to let Sherlock slip away that easily, especially if he does turn out to be John's soulmate in this world. God knows what could happen to Sherlock next. If his addiction and inclination towards trouble was anything to go by, John didn't dare guess how long it would be until Sherlock was wheeled into the emergency room once again.
Greg groaned loudly into a soggy pillow. His head was throbbing, pain pulsing and rising with the beat of his heart. To top off the headache, his stomach was a bit iffy and his mouth was about as dry as a towel. He opened one eye and looked down to find himself fully clothed thankfully as the bed he was in was definitely not Mycroft's. Slowly so as not to exacerbate his head he rolled onto his back and breathed a sigh of relief, John Watson truly was a saint. A quick glance at the clock showed it was only 7am and he rolled out of bed and trundled downstairs to find the apartment silent, and the coats of it's owners gone. He sighed and shook his head, wincing when the throbbing intensified "Bloody Holmes's." he cursed a bit before shuffling into the shower and turning it up high. God he felt horrific. What had he been thinking last night, drinking himself into a stupor. More importantly, what had he been saying!? Try though he might, his memory only allowed for patches of his conversation to come back to him, but he was relatively positive that he'd told John (and by extension Lucia, Mycroft's ever watchful assistant) that he loved Mycroft before he even told him that.
More time before he was back on cases and ignoring him, more time before John would go to the clinic for a day or two. It was a very surreal feeling, not being bored without a case. Sherlock kept waiting for the boredom to come, but these days it never did, and Sherlock was becoming increasingly aware of the reason. John, feelings, memories, all suddenly filled the unoccupied moments in his head. Shockingly, he didn't mind. He quite liked it in fact. There was something, something tangible beneath it all, and he did not as of yet have a label for it. These were the things that ran through his mind as he strolled over the gravel path that lead to the gardens, John's hand clasped lightly in his. The sun was just beginning to set, pink light made the whole expanse of land glow. Sherlock did not notice. He was busy, watching John, and how content he was.
Mrs Hudson laughed merrily at that "It seems like all the memories I had of you Sherlock from when you were younger involve that exact face. Oh, remember when you were trying to get him to learn French from that woman... Whatever her name was, and Sherlock here refused to open his mouth for months and there was nothing anyone could do to convince him and then" she had to hold her sides so uncontrollable was her laughter "when you told her there was no point, that she could leave he gave a string of his deductions about her in French?" Orabelle smiled fondly at the memory. "Oui je rappele ça, le petit coquin a l'apprendu déjà. Tu as effaces la langue je suppose?" ( yes I remember that, the little rascal had learned it already. You've deleted the language I suppose?) John was shocked sufficiently to learn that he still understood what she was saying, apparently those French A levels had stayed with him. Sherlock quirked a brow and the corner of his mouth turned upwards.
Before he left to get the appropriate tests ordered, John glanced down at the chart hanging on the edge of the hospital bed, then back up to have a proper look at the patient lying prone upon it.
"Cordelia." Cordelia laughed, a high pitched nasal sound that grated on your ears and made Sherlock want very much to harpoon her. "And who's the dishy date then?" she whirled to look John up and down. "How much are you paying him because I would double it for a night with the toy soldier here." She simpered, batting her oversized lashes and sticking out her chest. John's visible recoil and growing fury were the only reason Sherlock had yet to say anything to that. Maybe he was looking around the room, trying to see who else thought that he'd ever stoop to hiring an escort. A number that shouldn't have surprised him, did.
To say he was impatient to be gone was an understatement, but when one's brother is Queen's man of the county ( and quite a sizable collection of other territories as well, not that any of these simpletons knew that) obligation dictated much of the odious niceties he must show to the masses. That, and the tidy little sum he would be given in exchange for holding his tongue about the less savoury activities of their neighbours.
"Maybe a thank you blog post. I don't think the paper industry could hack the number of thank you cards we would need" John mused, staring at the bag full of wrapping and envelopes he'd had to grab after five minutes because the place had looked like a small hurricane had torn through.
"Hey John wait up!" Greg called to him, crashing through the forest with, surprisingly given how soon lunch would have to be prepared, Mike at his side.
John smiled and picked up the jacket, turning to face Sherlock. Those were their compliments, the only ones Sherlock really knew to use and the only John had ever bestowed upon him. He was blushing. "Thanks, Right.. Uh.. Well you should get dressed too, it's almost two, if you want to finish up whatever the experiment on the table is before we go, don't want Mrs Hudson to try clear it away again." The last time she'd done that... There had very nearly been an epidemic. Sherlock nodded curtly, going to the bathroom with a bundle of clothes in his arms. John cleaned up while he was in the shower, wiping crumbs off the sheets and washing dishes.
John's time with Mrs Hudson and Orabelle had been a bit odd in his opinion. Orabelle had basically suggested they tie him up so he couldn't escape; not that he wanted to leave at all but the fact that she suspected he did grated, and in the next breath was repeating how she thought he was a great man and how good he was to Sherlock and how lucky they all were to know him and the like, getting a bit misty eyed. Mrs Hudson just kept interrupting at intervals to let everyone know that they were her boys and that she'd have married ones of her own now so take that Mrs Turner. Greg slyly informed him that both women were a bit over the limit and assured that both would be sober by the ceremony. He bloody hoped so. Then the door had swung open dramatically and a short man in glasses announced that the flowers had arrived, if Mrs Holmes would like to oversee their distribution? That sobered her right up and she was off like a light, Mrs Hudson in tow, both blowing past Mycroft's PA who was standing in the door sheepishly. Molly was blushing and trying not to smile and John, not quite as dense as he once was, beckoned the woman in.
John adjusted the belt on his dress uniform and sighed. "Sleeping tablets. I was gone for all of a minute and you managed to sneak up to my old room and get my dress uniform into the bottom of our suitcase while I pissed? Why?" Sherlock popped his perfectly styled head out of the bathroom while still eyeing himself in the mirror. "Well I thought you'd look rather dashing in it and-" John just raised an eyebrow. "Fine, fine! People here will show you the respect you deserve this way alright? It seems to me that far too many of my relatives have yet to realise that you actually kill people and that they should watch their tongues." Scowling he slipped back inside and closed his jacket before he lifted his head to look at John in his regalia. "John. If we didn't have to be downstairs right now... It's not decent how you look in that uniform." John blushed a bit and stood to attention before putting his cap and medals on. "I can't say I'm not thinking the same about you in that suit, those tails really do just top it all off. Are we ready to head?" he asked lightly, knowing that this would be a bit of a fuck you moment for Sherlock to relish as he introduced everyone who'd mocked and teased him all those years to the fiancé and best friend they had assured him he'd never have. Sherlock grinned and held out his hand for John who took it without hesitation.
The idea of the pic with Mycroft carrying Sherlock on his back was inspired by this work of art and its original artist http://whimsycatcher.tumblr.com/post/136598154738 ; Go check it out, and beware, you might spill some tears.
"Good. Its working for me too. That is if you'd be amenable to maybe keeping that up, The two of us together. I mean I know we only just met but there's something about you... I know I'd like to stay wherever you are." Sherlock seemed to need a minute to pull himself together. "I wish someone had told me I'm so good I can make a talker speechless." John joked and Sherlock swallowed, blushing to his hairline.
"So. When, exactly, did you plan on telling me firstly that you had a friend who was willing to class themselves as such, and secondly that you two had entered a romantic relationship? Before you try and reproach me for earlier, he is your first relationship as far as I am concerned. That brief spat with that brute Sebastian in college was part of my reasoning that you would never be in a relationship, not after that night." Mycroft's face had gone stony at the first mention of Sebastian. The man had used Sherlock, at a time when he was confused and easily lead. Well, more easily. He had not learned how to control his feelings and had fallen under Sebastian's sadistic wing.
He broke their lips apart gently and slid Sherlock back to an almost fully upright position (his knees seemed to be failing him at the moment, John would be lying if he said he wasn't proud.) with their foreheads leaning against each other's and gave Sherlock a second to calm himself down. "That was me seducing you the way a swan should seduce a prince." John uttered into the quiet that was broken only by Sherlock panting. "But also in the way a man seduces another. Is it working?" John asked casually, moving so he could stare into Sherlock's eyes. Flushed and hair in an even wilder disarray he looked wonderful, alive. Big eyes blinked at him and Sherlock nodded slowly, making John grin.
The journey was not long enough, and when they reached the stable John was almost disappointed that they had to go inside. Mummy, Mycroft and Greg were already saddling up when the arrived. Sherlock lead John past the half doors until they had reached the last two doors. "I'll show you how to mount" Sherlock said exuberantly, his excitement showing through. He strode confidently into the stall with a grey, it's white skin luminous. John watched in fascination at the gentle manner in which Sherlock crooned to the horse while he put on his saddle and bit. He could hear the others going outside, the steady clip clop of hooves on the ground peppered with a quiet swear from Greg.
Waking up in each others arms had yet to lose it's appeal, and Sherlock couldn't help but revel in the caress of his fiancé, nor could he get used to thinking of John in those words. Long gone were the linguistic basics of friends and best mates, traded in for the more pleasing lover, partner, boyfriend as the language of seduction and possession came into play. Now however, an entirely new cocktail of powerful words were needed, words like fiancé and husband, words that held so much more weight than Sherlock had ever dreamed. In times of utter and complete languid calm he would call to his mind John's name and many of the words he had come to associate it with. John Watson: flatmate, partner, soldier, back up, doctor, best friend, only friend, laughter, lover, fiancé, heart, life - to list but a few. They would have to get up soon he knew, Mummy was awaiting them, but he could not bring himself to rouse John, not quite yet. He would begin to wake on his own in a few minutes anyway, drifting into the lighter sleep of morning. For now Sherlock was content to watch his John sleep, chest rising and falling with each breath, simply for the pleasure of knowing that he could. Even as he watched John's breathing began to quicken, and John rolled over sluggishly and planted a kiss on his chest.
A sleek black car rolled up and Greg slid inside, still seething. He was really angry at himself, after all they knew Sebastian would come after John but he'd thought it would be that Harold guy first, he thought they had time to prepare. He put his face in his hands and was silent the whole way.
Sherlock was getting rather tired of being called for easily solved cases. While at first glance the case had seemed interesting, he saw through it almost instantaneously. The mother had killed the children as revenge for the father getting custody, and then he had killed her for the offence. Obviously. It was just barely worth getting dressed for and not near worth the amount of paper work he would have to do in the same room as Anderson and Donovan. Nothing was worth that, yet there he was, sitting by the door trying desperately to ignore them while he filled in his statement. That it seemed, was not how they wanted the day to play out.
"John" Sherlock whispered as he shook his husband gently "Come along or we'll miss our flight." John had passed out in his chair after dancing solidly into the wee hours of the morning with everyone in the room, including Sherlock himself on a good few occasions. He was still slumped there when their 5am lift to the airport arrived, and he wasn't alone. In fact there was a pile of various people sleeping with arms on tables and jackets as pillows where they'd fallen in the ball room. But none of them had a flight to make. John startled awake and blinked rapidly before he noticed Sherlock was there and a wide grin threatened to split his face in two.
Sherlock frowned. "Was that... Not good?" he seemed bashful now, insecure about his rash action. Maybe John hadn't liked that, it was plausible that he had not been teasing but been uncomfortable with this still. Sherlock cursed himself in his head."No! God no! That was... Definitely good. I just realised I'd forgotten to breathe" John reassured him, blushing slightly at the way he'd lost the ability to function the moment Sherlock had kissed him.
With the frigid water all around him, Sherlock finally felt the sharp tendrils of pain curling to the side of his upper abdomen. Evidently Ricoletti’s knife did make contact with his person.
Sometimes Mycroft could barely believe that he was now in possession of more friends than he had ever thought to have in his life. At one point he'd had only Sherlock, but burning those bridges had meant years of being alone, until he had found Lucia. A conventional friendship theirs was not, and very few knew quite how close they really were, within his profession there were rules against it of course, and his moving up the political ladder had not been a solely selfish endeavour if it meant maintaining their secret until it didn't matter anymore. He had been the biggest supporter of the fact that caring was not an advantage. He had meant it when he'd taught his brother that. Yet here he was, driving a car full of people who would call themselves his friends and vice versa, to a villa in the outskirts of  Venice for a week long holiday. The world, he had concluded, was quite a fickle and strange place to be.
After the hubbub died down and the invisible man was definitely in a police station John couldn't help laughing. "What?" Sherlock asked with eyebrows raised. " Nothing, nothing. Our life is utterly bizarre is all." Sherlock laughed along with him and led the way back into the reception where the tables had been pushed to the sides of the room, the light of the setting sun flooded in, and Mycroft and Aurora sat at their instruments. Just for one song of course, after that there was a sound system and Sherlock had been assured the music was perfect for the occasion. "One last surprise John. May I have this dance?" Sherlock held out a hand and John took it with a confused smile as they strode into the centre of the room.
Now that they were in his room, Sherlock didn't know how this would play out. Was he supposed to say something or ask about which side of the bed John would prefer? He resolved to be silent, tearing off the dressing gown and ratty shirt and throwing them in a corner before sliding into the bed, leaving the duvet corner open for John to join him. John made the decision to forgo pyjamas and stick to boxers and his undershirt, stripping down carefully before taking the invitation and getting into bed. It was awkward, with miles of space between them and John unsure of where the boundaries lay, they spent ten minutes laying in complete silence before Sherlock gave a frustrated grunt.
John waited patiently at the tape and when Sherlock reached him and began to giggle he couldn't help himself but join in. When he did Sherlock's eyes flew to his in surprise and there was a burning sensation in his hand, and his chest. In fact his whole body was warm and full and relaxed. "Oh." Sherlock said, staring at the new ice blue eye on his hand. "Wow." John said, looking into the intoxicating eyes of his soulmate. They were only millimeters apart, and the electricity between them was a tangible force, a magnetic field that ran from one to the other. John could feel his body being pulled inexplicably closer to Sherlock's. Sherlock gulped as their foreheads met. All of a sudden Sherlock felt the urge to be so much closer, and thank John for killing for him "That...what you did there... it was... I... It was good. Thank you" Sherlock whispered as their mouths collided. John's hand found his and the sweet fire in his veins grew with every moment they were together.
“John noticed my apparent sleeplessness. Nothing more than a doctor’s concern for the wellbeing and recovery of his patient.”
"Watson... I.." he coughed and took a half step backward, and Watson was surprised to feel his fingers twitch with the desire to put him back where he had started. "I know it is indecent and improper and a host of other such sins but, try though I might... It is... you, are, rather... and I am
John's blood was a fire, magma raging through his veins as his wandering hands reached skin, blemished with reminders of dangers they had faced, and all the more beautiful for them. With Sherlock's deft violinist's fingers traveled down the buttons of his waistcoat, quaking as they went, John knew that he would rip the sun from the very sky if Sherlock but asked, and that was the fact of the matter.  "Anything, Sherlock, anything." He kissed it into Sherlock's throat, tasting the salt-sweat and charcoal of their day, finally putting a name to that light, almost floral scent that followed Sherlock on days they had spent at home - lavender oil dripped onto his neck, and maybe other areas John would joyously explore.
When he looked at her face, the cheeky grin lighting up her blue eyes, he wished he could feel something for her other than friendship, but he couldn't. His second, verbal reaction, was to agree to go. Maybe some festive cheer would remind his rebellious brain that other things were important too, and maybe he'd pull himself together enough to actually enjoy it.
He only slowed when the door of John's room got in his way. He could hear him, pottering about inside, the distinct sounds of a kettle boiling and a tea spoon clinking off a mug reinforcing the fact that this was real. Subtlety was probably the best approach and so he knocked sharply on the door. "Go away please, I'm not interested" "John?" Mug clattered to the floor. "Sherlock?" "Open the door John. Please." Two quick steps and suddenly door swung open, revealing one to the other. Seconds, an eternity, passed between them, growing and writhing in their unbroken gaze. "John I-" Sherlock was cut off abruptly by John, who flew at him and pressed their lips together, like Sherlock was the only thing he needed to breathe. Sherlock pulled John to him and ran his hands up and down his body, once again mapping it. "I don't know" John whispered between kisses "whether to kick you into next week" his mouth ravaged Sherlock's "Or have a mental breakdown because you're alive." Lips and tongue traced his jaw and followed it down to his neck. "I can explain it all John I - oh" John held a finger to his lips. "Tomorrow you will be telling me everything about all of this and I will see if you deserve a good kicking or not. Right now though, I need to see all of you. I missed you so much Sherlock, And I'm going to show you exactly how much if you close the door." Sherlock pulled the door shut and waited, watching John smile deviously. "Strip and get on the bed" Sherlock did as he was told, not ashamed of the new scars he had accrued over the years. He planted himself on John's bed and looked up for his next instruction. "Good, now put your hands over your head, just like that, okay, I'm going to cuff them up there, and now your legs exactly!" He didn't bother asking why exactly John had these handcuffs but it was probably above board.
"And you, you must be John Watson. I'm very pleased to meet you I must say! Mycroft has always had someone on his sleeve, although none as handsome as Gregory, but you my dear are the first person with my Sherlock. To think he has kept you from me! You must be something special, Sherlock is very guarded, in fact for years I thought that he was just not geared towards having relationships at all!" It was at that point that Sherlock cleared his throat loudly, a hint of a blush had spread itself across his got up and shook her hand warmly, smiling broadly. "I'm nothing special" he laughed, glancing back at Sherlock and grinning wider. "I can't take credit, we became friends thanks to him and after that well... Equally responsible." Mummy winked almost imperceptibly at him as he sat back down and Sherlock took his hand, stroking his thumb across the knuckles lightly. That was a thank you if John had ever gotten one. He knew his Sherlock struggled with it sometimes. Every little gesture filled him with happiness.
The group that had gathered for the party was eclectic to put it mildly. Obviously Lily, Molly's twin sister had come, travelling back from her new home in Tokyo specially for the occasion she was certain would never happen. Then there was Tina and Mary from Bart's, her constant companions and closest friends, Mycroft's assistant Anthea who'd become her friend mainly because of the Reichenbach situation, Sally Donovan, a surprisingly kind
"Yes actually, if you could send a bouquet of roses to the hospital, and perhaps the baby bag from my brother's flat, I doubt they brought that with them in the van."
The numbers on his forearm were still there, clear as day. Sherlock squinted at them, trying to see the important remaining two numbers. John cleared his throat, quickly moving away out of Sherlock’s reach. “Right. Get some rest, Sherlock.”
Sherlock's eyes filled with pain when he saw John, heard him speaking. John felt a stab in his chest when he realised that Sherlock thought he was Moriarty. It hurt more than it should have. Jim was laughing when he told John to unzip the coat, putting the bomb in full view of the detective. The impassive mask returned to Sherlock easily, but not before John caught worry and terror in his eyes. Through the whole ordeal Sherlock's eyes never left his, his gaze never faltered. When the red dots appeared on Sherlock, that made John really angry. No one got to threaten his Sherlock. "my Sherlock?" he thought to himself before forming a plan.
The chair John pulls up to his bedside seems to suggest otherwise, and as he opens his mouth to speak, Sherlock’s heart beats a staccato rhythm in his chest. This was it.
“Piss off, Mycroft,” came the standard reply. What else was there to say to a meddlesome elder brother?
Sherlock tossed his phone aside and began planning his attack. The pleasant thing was that at least he would not be forced to employ his acting skill this time, he did have feelings for John, past the accepted line of platonic friendship for certain. Past almost any line he had ever set for himself actually. What he really needed was a solid plan to bring the sparks that were so evidently present between them to fruition. Before Mycroft did. He had a knack for that, generally pulling rather important people from his life. Not that he was complaining, some of them had been rather unpleasant to him so when they 'dated' (A strong word for what he deduced they were 'doing') Mycroft they were soon out of his life and far away, which was perfect. "Stupid bloody brother and his stupid bloo-" John shuffled in, laden down with tea and gave Sherlock an odd look. "Are you alright?" he asked tentatively, handing a mug across. Sherlock scowled. "Of course I'm alright. Why did you accept the shoes?" John gave Sherlock and incredulous look and rubbed his temples "I needed shoes to wear, as much as I love the whole vagrant style, I am a fan of warm feet and having footwear in general. Especially when it's raining. Why does it matter? It's just shoes. Besides, I thought you liked it when we spent Mycroft's money." Sherlock scoffed. "Mycroft had a pair of shoes ready, in precisely your size, that were just so convenient. Think John! What must it be like in your mind? So empty! Come on John, you know that there's a reason. Deduce it." John took a sip of his tea and shook his head. "Sherlock we both know that my skills of deduction are next to nothing, so if you're going to explain yourself please do, but I don't know what you're looking for from me exactly." John frowned and raised a brow, waiting for an answer. "He's attempting to… seduce you" Sherlock spat with a scowl. John was silent. "Um. Right… not exactly what I was expecting… at all… eh… but it was just… shoes! I don't… Mycroft?!…" John babbled on, a dusting of cerise glowing across his cheeks. Sherlock's eyes widened. "Oh dear God tell me you don't want Mycroft!" John sputtered "NO! Jesus no, it'sMycroft for pete's sake but it just makes you think…" Sherlock smirked "That's a first" and John punched him lightly on the arm. "Alright you twat no need to be so annoying. What I was trying to say was that I thought the Holmes brothers didn't do relationships, affection, seduction without the motive of a case or for Mycroft I would have thought a political coup." Sherlock ran a hand through his curls and shook his head "We're Holmes' we can go after whatever and whomever we please, just generally we don't find anyone who is worth the effort, or more likely, going to return the sentiment without some form of deception. I personally have never been a party to sentiment but I could be, if I found someone who fit my criteria." John smiled "Ah yes, Caring is not an advantage. I would say your criteria are a bit impossible to meet, after all you're… you." Rolling his eyes Sherlock flopped back onto the couch. "Eloquent as always John. I am indeed, me. What an observation. It is not impossible to meet my criteria, just difficult. Unlikely even. It has only happened once in my life."
"Sherlock Holmes, now that's a name I wouldn't soon forget. What brought you to Florida so Sherlock? A girl?" John inquired quietly as the safety instructions began.
Clara and John raced to Harry's room as soon as the doctor told them she was awake. Sherlock hung back however, because he now knew something he shouldn't, the eldest Watson was dying, and she did not plan on telling anyone. Yet he knew. If he told John, he'd be devastated, and if he neglected to tell him he'd be both devastated and furious at being lied to. "Damn it Harriet!" he groaned in frustration, leaning back against the wall. Trust her to manage this, how on earth was he supposed to proceed? Tell or don't tell? He needed a second opinion. "Mrs Hudson?" he muttered down the phone, it was still early and the old lady didn't take too kindly to her sleep being interrupted when she just returned from some time away. "Sherlock dear what is it?" she asked readily, Sherlock wondered how he'd ever managed without her guidance. "I have stumbled across some rather... unpleasant news while deducing. The person the news is about does not want John to know about it, and now that I know... I am not quite sure what the protocol in this situation would be. Either way John
Rosie Mia Watson-Holmes is born weighing 7 pounds 6 ounces, at 6:17 pm on the clearest 5th of November for years. Her parents literally fall into the room a minute before she takes her first breath. They both cry when the hear her voice for the first time. She is the lightest thing Sherlock has ever held and he would destroy the world for her already.
." His eyes widened at the sight before him, and Sherlock, once he had caught his breath, realised the situation quite quickly. He flushed red, frozen to the spot as John stared at him in his nakedness, and while he stuttered bits and pieces of an apology and reached down to retrieve the towel, a hand stopped him. He looked up in askance and this time it was John's turn to flush.
If you are going to read these then I may as well be honest. I miss you. Every fibre of my being misses you and thoughts of you are the only thing that convinces me to keep going. You are an extraordinary man John, and I thought that I was telling the truth when I said that being alone protected me because it always has before, but I was wrong. You have protected me and fought for me and been the best friend anyone could possibly ask for and I thought I didn't need you but I do, more than I need the work or relief from boredom. I need you like Mycroft's assistant needs her phone, I need you like Mrs Hudson needs to reassure us that she is not our housekeeper, I need you like Lestrade needs sleep, I need you like Mycroft needs to be in control, I need you more than I need myself. I can't help but hope that you need me too, because the point of no return has long since passed for me and I think the damage would be irreparable should you leave me. Perhaps the Greeks were right, and we were truly born with four arms, four legs, and a single heart, split into two beings and dropped to the Earth, trying to find one another again to complete ourselves. Perhaps you were given the heart and I was given the head.
Ricoletti’s fingers were still attached steadfastly to his coat. The coat wasn't helping. The heavy material was absorbing water fast and weighing Sherlock down quicker than he could hope to kick himself to the surface. Add Ricoletti’s weight, and Sherlock was almost certain he would never see the light of day again.
The heart monitors jumped up and down excitedly until a nurse came in and tutted, telling Sherlock that he was interfering with the patient and would be removed. She plodded over to the IV and injected a sedative into it. John had half laughed half sighed into Sherlock's mouth and then broke away,apologizing to the nurse as he tried to get his pulse under control. Sherlock was trying to hide his smile and failing miserably. John hit him softly on the hand "It's not my fault you're so gorgeous! With your cheekbones and your collar all turned up so you look cool... Honestly! You'd think you were doing it on purpose!" he laughed staring at Sherlock again and reminding himself that he had said he loved him just a few short hours ago. "What?" Sherlock had noticed his stares clearly and John beamed. He didn't think he would stop smiling again for a long time. "You love me" he said, snuggling back into his pillows looking rather pleased with himself. "Yes I do" Sherlock said, stroking John's hair as he fell asleep.
If anything, John seemed pleased with his aloof response, grinning brighter and licking his lips 1.23 more times a minute. "So if it wasn't a girl, and I doubt it was the holidaying,you must be here on business." Mildly pleased that this one wasn't a total dolt Sherlock decided to tell him exactly why he was here, and let John take it how he would.
He had been on the verge of figuring out where and who exactly they should target for a day and a half when he'd realized that some assistance of a chemical variety would help immensely with speeding up the process. It had sped up the deductions and within an hour he had the solution (old house four blocks from the dumping site with a series of unused drainage pipes connecting it to the real base of operations two kilometers east.) but he'd also had himself dragged to A&E, so all in all the time had worked out about the same.
"I'm fine, I'll keep the sleeve unbuttoned and that should be adequate." Sherlock attempted to swan past John and out of the bathroom but a hand, wrapped ever so gently around his uninjured wrist, held him back. He was frozen to the spot when a calloused thumb began absently swirling patterns into the skin there.
“Thing is, I don’t even know if it’s his birthdate on my mark because I had no reason to make him see it, and now he’s gone. I don’t like not knowing, Paula, I really don’t.”
Waiters and waitresses began to circulate with various dishes as soon as the newlyweds sat down, and for a long while all that was heard was light chatter and cutlery clicking off delft.
easy for John and Sherlock to get their happy ending ;) Meanwhile drop us a comment to let us know how we're doing, it'll help very much!
"Ooooooh here I go again, walking the line, killing time between my sins, Ooooooh why do I come here? The endings still the same I'm bringing back old tears, I act like I don't knoooow, where this road will gooooo, Pour me something stronger, pour me something straight, all these crooked voices make them go away, I can barely stand up, I can hardly breathe, pour me something stronger than me, pour me something stronger than me" Sherlock's voice was smooth and melodic, but the lyrics were saturated with pain and loss and every time his eyes would rise to meet John's he'd feel his heartbeat in his mouth. Without knowing it they had shuffled closer, Sherlock now sat between John's legs on the edge of the bed and John's hand was on his leg, holding him. He sang on "Pour me something stronger, pour me something dark, pour it up so high, till I can't feel my heart, I can barely stand up, I can hardly breathe, pour me something stronger than me, hmmmmmmmmmm"
When Sherlock woke, he was both shocked and pleased to find John was still in bed with him. He could feel Johns arm under his back, hand drooped lazily in the crook of his elbow while the other was covering his own which were lying on johns chest. He hadn't had a single nightmare. Sherlock had almost forgotten how restoring sleep could be, usually if he tried he ended up in a worse state than before, dreams of a past life he'd rather forget plagued him every time he closed his eyes.
That, of course, posed its own problems. To what extent would John be willing, be able even, to tell him the truth? After all, Sherlock, while he was certain that they had some form of prior relationship, could not be sure if it was positive or negative, and for which of them it was either positive or negative. Who had decided that they wouldn’t associate? If it had been John… the likelihood of him giving a version of events untarnished by his own bias against Sherlock, over past behaviour he couldn’t even remember, was very slim.
In fact, if anything Sherlock would venture that John was going out of his way to avoid seeing him, because it was blatantly apparent from Stamford’s pointed sighs as he did his new rounds that John had gone so far as to switch rounds just to maintain a relative distance. It was as if he knew that, whatever it was that was going on, Sherlock was close to figuring it out.
Lestrade could only shake his head in exasperation before stepping forward to fill Sherlock in on the details.
“Playing the perfectly polite gentleman this morning I see. Well the other son in the family is going out for a walk and you’re not welcome to join me.”
Just as he pressed send the door clattered open and Sherlock strolled in. "Well that was tedious." he smirked and John stifled a laugh and turned on the kettle. The rumble of Sherlock's voice explaining his experiment ("of course I've done this sort of thing before but
"Oh perfect you're just on time." Orabelle rubbed a hand over his cheek and straightened his tie, the way she had the first time she'd put him in one, and hadn't repeated since. "My baby boy..." she looked on the verge of tears and he took her hand in his instinctively, and she wiped her eyes quietly with the other before turning away and picking up a dark blue orchid and pinning it to his jacket, smoothing absent mindedly as she went. The familiar trill of violin strings began Greg and Mrs Hudson were moving, stepping out into the sunshine and away. "Here we go" Mummy said quietly as Oceana took her first steps out, and Archie just moments behind.
"So Sherlock brings me to Molly's lab, she's our friend who's a pathologist, which is actually where we first met and it's been scrubbed down and on the desk is dinner and candles from Angelo's where we had our first date. I still had no idea what he was planning because as he says I'm an idiot but we started eating and he's telling me all these stories about Mycroft as a child and then out of the blue he says that he has something for me and slides this pile of navy fabric across the desk. It's all folded up into a square and I start unfolding it, it is pretty clear that it's a scarf, the exact same as the one he wears everyday but on the next to last fold there's letters embroidered into it - JHWH, and I asked what the extra H was for but Sherlock peeled that back and sitting there was a ring box. I think my heart stopped beating for a moment when I saw it... He gave me a little speech that was... and asked me to marry him." Sherlock placed his hand over John's "Much to my surprise John laughed and pulled out two boxes of his own, and asked me to marry him. We both said yes and proceeded to have copius amounts of-" John put a hand over his mouth and blushed "Not that much detail Sherlock!" Mrs Hudson giggled "Nothing I haven't heard before, I do live below you boys, I don't think any of us have gotten much sleep recently" she winked and John wished he could delete that from his mind.
"In case I haven't been oozing mushy thoughts all morning, you're amazing. Also you're warm and I'm going to nap. We can have our fun on the plane."
He put his hand back in the sand and slowly Sherlock's own hand was moving to touch John's, bit by bit until nervous fingers were slotted between his own, pale white in dusky gold. They sat like that, hand in hand and silent staring up at the sky until it was fully dark. They'd have to talk this through, both men knew that obviously, but right now, the gentle pressure between their hands and the sky full of stars was enough. It seemed as if they had both been tired in more ways than one.
Sherlock was confident that he could be done within five minutes of arriving. Had to get there to finish, and a taxi was the only option. Calming down a bit was the only solution because the taxi driver would not be pleased to see that. Sherlock made a mental note to keep the shirt John was wearing. It was what had spurred him forward, apparently the fitted quality was something of a turn on. That in itself intrigued him. It called for more... Testing. After all, A quality experiment had at least three repetitions.
It was Mummy's turn to speak. “What your father means, dear, is that you should give this a chance, you deserve to be just as happy as we are darling, and maybe it will work out, and maybe it won't. There are no guarantees in love, but you shouldn't let it walk right by you without at least reaching for it.”
His mind was stagnating in his skull even now, there was no John to occupy his every thought, no case to satisfy his hunger. The lights in 221 Baker street had not been turned on for six days now. Darkness seemed apt, it was supposed to numb him, dull his senses until he couldn't lie to himself about the only real solution. Seven years sober. He had promised himself, Mycroft, Lestrade, John never to go back. Yet the resolve was fading, crumbling more with each passing minute. They would be so disappointed. Just like every one always was, Mummy about his wasted talents, Mycroft about his lack of interest, Lestrade at his calculating ways, John at his occasional cutting comments. Sherlock was one massive disappointment, adding one more item to the long list would not matter. No one would be there to chastise him anyway, they wouldn't find out. There were at least three trustworthy dealers in the direct vicinity, and even with Mycroft's eyes Sherlock could hide. He was never found if he didn't want to be.
"I...that is to say... it might be beneficial... of course it also might not... transport absolutely betraying me... this" Sherlock struggled to articulate himself, a high flush on his cheeks "was an incredibly poor idea. I apologize." John frowned as he spun around and made to leave, jumping out of his chair and taking hold of his wrist, guiding him back into the kitchen and manoeuvering him into a sort of slouch against the table.
. Of course he couldn't just outright say anything, John might not even be gay and that would be awkward for them both. He sighed and flopped back onto the bed, fingers picking idly at his guitar. A soft melody began to flow from his fingertips and he quickly picked up a notepad and scribbled down the chords, humming along while thinking up lyrics.
“Maybe. In all honesty we won't know until he wakes up, and even then not until the medicine clears his system. There may be some form of aphasia, loss of mental acuity, motor difficulties, short term memory loss, amnesia, difficulty with concentration… and there could also be nothing. We won't know for a while yet.” In silence the two men sat, lost in their thoughts and the sounds of the hospital slowing down as the rush shift ended and graveyard began.
Sherlock had risen to eat last night and that was it, he slept like the dead until John woke him the next morning to get the taxi to the airport. Boarding the plane, Sherlock was like a sleepy toddler, shepherded by John through the airport and into their seats on a private plane, where, like a child, he curled up and slept, taking John's hand in his own while unconscious. John's thumb ran across his knuckles, soothing, as the plane brought them ever closer to respite.
It was a cottage built from sandstone with a few darker bricks around the windows and door frame, and powder blue wooden features like the shutters and door. A rose trellis climbed the door frame, reaching upwards from the plant life that adorned the ground in beds all across the front of the cottage. The limestone curled down into three paths that led away from the property itself and into the wild landscape around it. The first circled gently around a massive oak tree that dominated the drive way and then trickled down across a grassy field and into a small vegetable garden and orchard where it reconnected with the secind path that seemed to bring you directly out into the middle of an explosive field of wild flowers and led around the back of the property, in the opposite direction to the third path. What wonders that side of the cottage held John couldn't guess, he could only gape open mouthed at the beauty of what he could see.
The peace of the place, broken only by the whisper of leaves and the hum and chirps of insects and birds, made everything seem thick and slow, like honey dribbling down from a spoon and even the sound of the key turning in the lock seemed like too much. Sherlock allowed himself to be immersed in it, in this place, in the nature of it, in John and his slow inexorable seduction of him like waves lapping against the shore. Every touch had a crystalline brilliance, a hyper reality for him and it threatened to overwhelm his every sense, to drag him into oblivion but then there was John's hand, his anchor to the world, and there was his breath, like the flight of the birds, and his heartbeat like the wings of the bees, and his whispered devotion like the very wind in the trees outside and Sherlock was one with the universe, finally at peace with the world in John's careful hands.
He did not have the energy left to be mad at Mycroft. It was too late for that now and his punishment was the worst Sherlock could have devised. Every single day, without fail while he was gone Mycroft would have to go to the flat and watch John. No cameras to keep him detached. He would live with what his actions had done. For once in his life Mycroft would know consequences. Sherlock wished that their was another way, that they could simply switch places and it would be Mycroft on that roof, it would be Mycroft killing criminals and destroying an empire, while he stayed with John, loved him more every day, solved cases and eventually retired at around age 92 to be a beekeeper with John. But he was not going to be that lucky.
And they were kissing, Sherlock surging against him like a dying man desperate for one more day, his mouth like lightning striking against John’s own. John wondered if he could feel his heart thundering in his chest through the barriers of their clothing, wondered if he knew just how long he had been waiting for this from some innocuous detail like the curve of his lip as they ravaged each other. Hands lingered, in hair and on necks, embracing each other tight enough to bruise just for the simple pleasure of touching from chest to thigh as they bumped against the wall of 221b.
"Do you have a plan?" Lucia asked softly from the seat next to him. "Of sorts." Mycroft replied, aiming for nonchalance and missing the mark by far. "Apologising for my actions of late will obviously be the first port of call, after that… Well." and Mycroft shrugged a shoulder, falling silent. "You should tell him how you feel - sir" Lucia quipped, adding on the term of respect only because of the presence of another in the car. "And why on Earth would I do that? Why open oneself up to ridicule and pain in that way? You say that Gregory will not be cruel, but all people are cruel with the hearts of others" Mycroft spat, his nervousness giving way to anger " I have seen it everyday, people making false declarations of affection, born of greed and lust for power when in actuality they are mocking their partner. I refused a long time ago to allow that to happen to me, and up until this point I have kept to my beliefs. All lives end, all hearts are broken and caring is not an advantage." Lucia gave him a sidelong glance, her face a picture of melancholy. "But you docare, and so does Greg. An Iceman is a man nonetheless, and this particular Iceman has been granted the unbelievably good fortune of finding someone who sees past the icy exterior and cares for you anyway, and deserves to know that he isn't alone in it. Just… Don't discount it yet. Talk to him." Mycroft snorted and turned away from her once more, but he didn't say he wouldn't do it, and that was enough for her. Pulling up to the manor Mycroft gritted his teeth against the memories it sparked, how Gregory had stared pink cheeked and open mouthed at the grandeur— "No." he admonished himself as he slid gracefully from the car. "I'll be back from Vienna within the week, text if you need me" Lucia smiled softly and closed the door, and Mycroft watched as the car drove away from him from the same spot on the driveway. There was nothing to do but go inside and apologise, he had to, but God if his heart beat any faster it would probably explode. 'Wouldn't that just be hilarious' he thought to himself as he turned his key in the lock 'to be constantly sought after by mercenaries, terrorists, foreign officials, only to die of an impromptu heart attack because you're terrified to confess to the man you invited to live with you. Good show Mycroft, really, that's a fitting way to die.'
"Now, if you're quite finished Gregory, I do believe I promised to make you regret leaving this morning. Come along" Mycroft had pulled the base of his umbrella away, revealing it's true nature. It was a beautiful, deliciously painful, mahogany cane. Greg shivered at the sight of it. "Now Gregory, you are going to like this" Mycroft purred and God, it was all Greg could do not to jump him right there in the kitchen but the wait would be worth it. Admittedly, sitting down would be an issue for the next few days. Mycroft Holmes loved Greg's dominant side, but tonight he was going to submit, and love every minute of it.
“John. You’re miserable. Now I don’t know what it is about Holmes that has you all worked up but you need to stop it right now. It’s not good for someone in your position to be this distracted all the time. Either you get off your sorry arse and do something about it or I will.”
Beth stood with her back to the lake, a crown of flowers on her head and tears in her eyes as she spoke to the men in front of her, both of whom wore flowers in their hair as well. Their hands were clasped tight between them and when Beth's mouth stopped moving, they embraced tightly, smiling at each other with no regard for the people around them and then they kissed.
case, if you don’t mind, detective inspector?” Sherlock spun back towards the evidence board. “Now what can you tell me about these marks on the victim’s body?”
When they sobered up, adrenaline was still running through their veins and Sherlock's heart was racing. John was giving him the post-case look of pure admiration and suddenly he knew that it was time to do it. He peeled himself off the wall and simultaneously pinned John to it. "John" he whispered, voice dropped to a low rumbling bass that reverberated through both of them. Slowly, he reached into his pocket and pulled out the box. "John" he said again, watching as John's eyes widened and his breathing hitched. "Sherlock?" John couldn't breathe, this was happening. "Oh my God" he whispered as Sherlock dropped to one knee. "Apparently this is how it's done traditionally. I'm not one for tradition but this seemed like something to... John. You know how much you mean to me, and in case you don't the answer is everything. I didn't think I'd ever have a friend, much less a partner, a best friend and a lover all rolled into one, so I never thought that I would want to get married. But then you came along with all your silly jumpers and your crooked smile, and before you even knew me you killed a man to save me. Then I realise that I love you and you decide that you want me too, of all people you choose me, love me, and all of a sudden I can't wait for the whole world to know that you are mine and I am yours, for as long as you'll have me. John Watson will you marry me?" Sherlock threw the box on the ground and held up the ring, a silver band with two diamonds set into it, and he held his breath. John grabbed him and pulled him up gruffly, smashing their lips together and pushing his tongue into Sherlock's mouth, holding back a chuckle at the yelp of surprise turned groan that he swallowed. When they broke apart John took his face in his hands and kissed him again, much more gently. "Of course I'll marry you Sherlock." he croaked and they beamed at each other as Sherlock slid the ring onto his finger.
fruit juicer and make your own protein shakes at home. God knows what you put in those things anyway,” John laughed, smacking the other hard on the back and pulling away, and just as he was about to turn back to face his circle of colleagues, John spotted a very familiar face hovering in the corridor just outside the lounge.
The first thing Sherlock noticed, as he began to come to, was how cold he was despite the thick wool of his coat separating him from the... concrete? Groggily opening an eye, Sherlock tried to reconcile what he was seeing with what he understood of the known universe- either the suspect's home had been hidden somehow inside a cheese factory, or he had stumbled into an alternate universe, or, and the longer he stared up at the towering block of cheeses, the more he was swaying towards this one, he had been discovered during the small, technically undocumented search that he and John had been doing, and then been knocked out and stowed away in somewhere that was familiar to their suspect, Henry Long.
For now, knowing that he was not alone was enough to kill the nightmares of losing John, his resolve to solve the Moriarty issue had grown infinitely larger now that he had something to lose. It was dangerous and bloody moronic, his plan to stop Jim but waking up next to John would definitely reassure him that everything would be okay. It always would be with John. Sherlock felt lips brush lightly off his head, and his whole body relaxed for the first time he could remember since his drug days, and definitely the first time since Jim had appeared. "Goodnight" John whispered and, with a contented sigh, they slept, wrapped in the safety of the others arms.
Sherlock stared at himself in the mirror, wearing now the last minute addition of a bow tie (he planned to remove it as soon as the ceremony was over) and hoped he didn't make a fool of himself. His mind was a hundred places, reminding him of all that could go wrong. What if John had changed his mind? "He's already waiting for you at the altar. His mind was made up after your first date, would you like to know how I know that?" Mycroft replied with a slight smile at the fact that Sherlock had spoken his thoughts aloud. He nodded and Mycroft smiled a bit wider. "He asked me for my blessing on the eventuality of his proposal, I thought he was joking to be quite honest, then again my humour is not what the masses would consider to be funny. But there you have it. Now on the other hand if you have decided that you don't want this I can spirit you away if you wish, but judging by the look on your face you haven't so, worry not, just focus on the periodic table until the music begins." Sherlock's heart gave a little fizzle at that. One date and John knew they would make it to this day, even went so far as to talk to Mycroft about it so oddly that he hadn't had any idea that it would actually happen. Oh John. Mycroft looked at his pocketwatch. 1:45. "You're expected in the gazeebo brother mine, and I in my seat, the ushers will be having fits." Sherlock gave a dry chuckle at his joke and began the descent to the garden.
doctor.” Another smirk. “What is it about the decorated ex-soldier that has you so frazzled, brother dear? Is that the first signs of sentiment I see over the man who saved your life, or is it just the cocaine talking? God forbid I let my compromised baby brother back out onto the streets without the highest assurances that he is well and truly recovered.” Mycroft crossed his ankles and leant against his umbrella, dropping a bag undoubtedly containing a change of clothes at Sherlock's feet.
"...HE COULD HAVE BEEN KILLED! I DON'T CARE IF HE STOPPED TEN BLOODY ASSASSINATIONS IT'S NOT WORTH HIS LIFE! Not to me, and I would have thought not to you either Mycroft. Clearly I was mistaken." The pounding in his head intensified, but Sherlock couldn't tear himself away from John's words. Of course he knew in an unspoken sense that his life was worth quite a lot in John's eyes but John was champion of the innocents, always willing to sacrifice to save the many. To hear him acknowledge that Sherlock was more important to him than that hardwire need to save was a revelation. If he wasn't bandaged to the nines the temptation to physically show John how much he too meant in Sherlock's life would have overwhelmed him, as it was all he managed was a wince from his place on the couch when John slammed the door.
"Thank you Greg, seriously mate that was... and the ones of today as well... just... thank you." John said seriously as Greg sat back down and Mycroft squeezed his elbow. John had been told that only Greg was speaking, when Sherlock stood up he stared at the rest of the table in surprise and they all just smiled back at him.
John dragged Greg up to his old bed and dumped him unceremoniously onto the bed, returning to place paracetamol and a glass of water on the side table by the sleeping man. Chuckling at the drool dribbling slowly from the corner of his mouth John snapped a photo and sent it to Sherlock before trudging back to his armchair. He'd not had the chance yet to update his blog and inform the masses that they were engaged and though he was slightly on the wrong side of sober he opened his laptop and began.
"Wonderful. Well. One of us is going to have to get up and figure out a plan, and I'm guessing from your frankly disconcerting level of regular human brain skill at the minute, that person is going to be me so off you hop." John could feel Sherlock pout as he let him go, and rolled around so they were face to face to give him a quick kiss. "I'm glad you're pretty much okay, you glorious madman. I'm going to get us out of here, all right?" Sherlock grinned at him.
We're getting clos to the end of this prompt list and the end of this fic... Think I'm getting separation anxiety :L 8 left...
"I suppose you're here to make sure I don't get into any trouble. Mycroft neglects to remember that I am a grown man."
John bit back a groan and turned to face the ten other guys who looked stunned. "I see it like this, either we take a few weeks of dance classes or we let our mates take a fall they might never recover from. I don't see much of a choice there. But" he spun back around "I'm going to want a few things from you in exchange. First you have to promise you won't get in any more trouble until the season is over. Second you can't whine at us that dancing is hard or that you wish you were on the pitch because it's your fault and thirdly I'll be expecting you to apologise to the team. You let us down yesterday guys, we're better than that sort of thing, and you've brought our name down too. That last you can do now." Even Lestrade felt a little bit bad for the messers, getting a talk down from John Watson just made you feel bad, it was like disappointing your old man, you felt shame and guilt for every little thing no matter what. He thought it was the eyes, they were very honest much like John himself and if he felt like you'd let him down you bloody well knew it. Similarly he could bring you right up out of the gutter with an easy smile and his forgiving nature. It was part of what made him a great captain.
He raised a salacious brow "Was there a reason I wasn't supposed to? " Mycroft pinched the bridge of his nose in exasperation.
Through it all, John kept up his best smile, genuinely thankful for the company and yet, he could not help being distracted with thoughts of whether Sherlock was alone or surrounded by family at that moment, whether he was feeling lonely or loved, or whether he wished he was somewhere else, not unlike how John felt at that very moment.
It was a little while before John could say anything. "Sherlock that is... I don't know if I have words to describe it mate. Its bloody incredible! If you ever decide ballet isn't for you go join the bloody philharmonic you talented sod!" John laughed and patted Sherlock on the shoulder. "Seriously though, you're something else. Anyway, on to the dancing" He flopped down on the floor next to Sherlock who still wasn't moving. "You alright?" John asked cautiously and Sherlock shook his head clear, gave John an unreadable look and hit replay, gliding to the centre of the floor in perfectly executed bourrée and suddenly John understood what Ms. Adler had meant.
Fuck. Sherlock raised an arched brow and took a step closer as John attempted to move behind the counter, praying that Sherlock hadn't seen the physical manifestation of his thoughts. A slight smirk had broken out on Sherlock's face as he cornered John, his half naked body pressed so close yet not quite touching John's. "Did you know" Sherlock murmured in a low baritone "that I have quite a weakness for sailors? Especially consulting bloggers?"
They stopped on the landing of 221B and stared at the door in silence for a while before Sherlock opened that too and they walked somberly inside. A layer of dust covered the mostly empty apartment, obscuring a few of the shallower bullet holes and burn marks. John was still in the foyer, zoned out, while Sherlock paced the living room, what had been the living room, his hands reaching up to touch the faded yellow of a graffiti smily face. It was dark already, and they hadn't had the foresight to bring candles or torches or really anything much useful seeing as the electricity was obviously not going to still be running. Still, hindsight wasn't much use to them. Eventually they simply lay down on the floor.
With a gasp, Sherlock shuddered back into the present. Peeling his eyes open slowly, Sherlock felt like his normal self but could not help feeling a little bit more hollow inside, as if something was missing. Brushing it off, he reached for his phone, unlocking it to see he has two missed calls from his acquaintance down at Scotland Yard. Another call comes through at that very moment, to which Sherlock answered.
"Well,  I should have guessed there was red hair in the family with you both being so pale, make sure to  get your ears, the amount of burnt ears I've seen !"  John quipped as he scooted around them to the fridge for something to drink, grabbing four glasses and a  bottle of what looked like fresh orange juice.  Mycroft rolled his eyes and continued to smooth cream over his arms "Yes well, there's one in every family. Lucky for me I was blessed with a darker shade on my head, the difficulties red heads have in finding clothing to suit their hair is not something I envy."
John shrugged. "I'm pretty sure every 16 year old works in Tesco at some point. Well, not you, obviously. But all my friends when I was growing up did and so did I. I spent an entire summer working back here when I was 16 and it really hasn't changed. Just like the door lock can be opened from the inside if you hit it at the right angle."
"Well. Fancy that. Nice to see you again so soon. Thank you ma'am I'll take him off your hands if you'd like, I'm sure you're very busy." The undercurrent of flirtation was not lost on the stewardess as she blushed and fluttered her lashes a good bit before leaving them be. Sherlock was struck by how very unlikely this situation was, and he stood staring vaguely into nothing before the man spoke again.
"Open the door James." Sherlock had hoped to avoid a scene that would scare their invisible man away by moving this part of the proceedings upstairs, not convince Sholto that this was somehow meant to be. Of course the blatant signs of depression that had been irrelevant earlier were now blaring sirens in his head. John's presence wasn't exactly helping either. "Please don't do this Major." John added desperately, and Sherlock knew that he'd have to really step up his game now because Sholto had to live. He had to. "I'm a good man Holmes. Those crows... that wasn't my fault. But people don't understand, they haven't been on the ground, making the hard choices. We're both still good men Holmes, even if some of our choices haven't been great. Maybe they'll see that now." Sherlock pressed his face up against the frack between door and frame. "There's a whole gang of people who know that right here, two of them outside this door. We are good men James, and that's why we would never do this to John, to any of them. They deserve better, and so do you. Open the door." John held his breath for agonizingly long moments before the heavenly sound of the bolt sliding back broke the silence. John's arms wrapped around them both. "Thank you" he murmured. There was nothing else to say.
"Ah." John exclaimed softly "ones that involve flying. I see." Sherlock only inclined his head in reply and was shocked to discover that John's hands were around his: the first trapped between the armrest and his death grip, the second soothing over the knuckles of that hand in a gesture that few had ever bestowed upon him, an effort at care and comfort that he had not received in a long time. It was quite nice actually. Altitude reached, the terrifying vertical ascent levelled off and Sherlock, vaguely embarrassed, gingerly released the hand that he'd been crushing.
"Oh, Mr Watson? Amazing work, truly something. He's working right through there if you'd like to meet him, of course Mr Stamford would have to accompany you until you're with him, regulations and all that." Sherlock nodded and stood in wait, listening to the rhythmic chopping and sanding of wood until she returned with Mike at her side.
Breathing hard, Sherlock braced himself against the railing of the bridge as Ricoletti threw himself at the detective, bringing the knife high to aim it at Sherlock's neck only to be shoved back hard as Sherlock kicked his legs up to push the man backwards, buying himself a brief moment of reprieve. He followed with a right hook to the man's left temple, knocking him off balance.
"Watson?" It was tentatively spoken, softly uttered into the stillness of the night and of course he would turn around, stand to try and source the ill that made Holmes, confident in his every endeavour, speak thusly. He turned to find Holmes much closer than he had anticipated him to be, and while he was indeed out of the bath, that did not mean he was in a state to be looked upon by Watson, but it seemed as if look was all he could do. Clad only in a towel held around the waist, Holmes was still damp and flush from his bath and Watson could not tear his eyes away from the water droplets rolling down from his hair, taking a path over his chest and finally disappearing into the towel line. He could barely think, but managed to wrestle a question from his lips.
“I wonder that every minute I'm spending here locked in this tedious conversation. Maybe you should go on a walk, make room for all the food you're going to stuff into yourself at dinner, I'm sure there are some paths that will lead you far away from me.” Sherlock scoffed as he pushed past and strode off, intent now on taking that walk just to spite Mycroft.
"Because you can actually sit down, I won't try and stop you." Sherlock caught his eye and nodded, plopping himself down and sprawling out across a row of chairs. The man simply threw him a half smile and went back to his laptop, somehow knowing that silence would be appreciated. Sherlock observed him slyly around steepled fingers and watched as he typed and ran hands through his hair, licking his lips every few seconds without even noticing and occasionally fiddling with his shirt buttons. Eventually Sherlock looked away and closed his eyes, content to rest a bit, archive this success in his mind palace, and mentally prepare for the hell ahead. Time passed and before Sherlock knew it the stranger was rising, gathering his things and moving swiftly towards the exit. Just before he crossed out of sight, the blonde man turned back to him with a grin and a slight wave.
"Now, what type of table are you looking for? I have a couple that you might like" Edgar clomped deeper into the shop and the couple followed after him. "This will explain why someone so brilliant became a shop keeper." They were at the back wall before John realised, he had focused on the things he was passing rather than the destination. Persian rugs, Mahogany armoirs, jewel encrusted trinkets, chaise longues and a host of other intriguing items that had him feeling like he was walking through the cave from Aladdin. "Pine, from the 1930's, Fire retardant, admittedly the carvings are a bit on the morbid side, skulls and crows on the vines but I think it suits you. Plus all the detail is in the legs, so if the top gets scorched or melted again you can just replace that and keep the original legs." John was speechless, it was a perfect fit for them, practical and well built with a side of mystery and danger. "You're bloody brilliant Edgar! I can see why this job would be good for you." Edgar beamed and excused himself to call his grandson who worked with him as a truck driver who did the heavy lifting and delivered goods to all clients.
“Yes Mummy, why, just the other afternoon I had the pleasure of being introduced to a very fine doctor who knows Sherlock here, and he seemed very fond of him indeed, so naturally he must be competent, perhaps he went to school with Ms Draper, he went to St Bartholomew’s, is that not right Sherlock?”
That was as good as a promise from Mycroft so Greg steeled himself and walked into a now almost entirely deserted common room, spotting Sherlock almost instantly in his armchair by the fire. Cautiously, Greg sat down next to him and said nothing for a while. First thing he'd learned about talking emotion with Sherlock was that you had to let him make the first move and that happened best when the weapon of silence was well employed.
"I feel like we're going to regret giving them the reins in the near future" John muttered under his breath to Sherlock as they sat down at the table and listened to Mrs Hudson and Mummy Holmes discuss a hundred things at once. They were already squealing shrilly, John could just barely make out words like "flower arrangement" and "venue specialist". He sighed resignedly and Sherlock patted his arm "As long as they're happy we don't have to deal with them." John smirked and fiddled with the silverware that was probably genuine silver and took a deep breath to just calm himself a bit. Their future seemed to be revealing itself at a devastating pace and while it was all wonderful from this side of the timeline the chances of successfully maneuvering themselves to live that way were slim to say the least.
It was raining, a truly miserable downpour accompanied by gale force winds and a warning to stay in your home being broadcast on the news. Both inhabitants of 221b were warm and appreciative of the cozy atmosphere that they had created, warm yellow light flooding the sitting room thanks to an impromptu fire and both men in pyjamas and dressing gowns, enjoying tea and each other's company. Sherlock played soothing pieces on the violin to contrast the lashing of rain at the windows and the howls of the wind as it tried to enter their sanctuary. John read though his attention was stolen by Sherlock's fluid movements more often than not, until he gave up the pretends all together and simply revelled in the music.
John was at the table, cup of tea in hand, smiling softly at a photo Mrs Hudson had sent up of him and Sherlock wrapped in a tight embrace in front of Speedy's. Sherlock's throat closed up just a little more at that. This would quite possibly be his last night with John, ever. When he kissed him it was urgent and needy, he needed to map every single inch of John's body, burn it permanently into his mind so that he could always have it with him. When they fell into bed his movements were slow and so very apologetic. He hoped John understood the sentiment as he held him even closer, running his hands through his hair and over his scar. He crushed their mouths together, tasting John and tea and baker street and home for the last time and he wanted to just bottle that taste because he was going to miss every single little dust mote in the flat and every cell of his body would scream for his John. But it was all for him, anything to keep him safe. When they were finished and boneless, Sherlock wrapped himself around the warmth that was John with all his limbs. John kissed his cheek lightly. "When you do this... I feel like you're saying goodbye." Sherlock didn't answer and John didn't say anything else, just held him tighter and pretended he didn't feel the teardrops falling in his hair.
The hansom ride home was an unpleasant one, only due to the fact that Holmes had rolled across a floor covered in blood and other unsavoury things and as such was not exactly a delight on the senses. Dusk had fallen and the silence between them was one of ease rather than discomfort, with the snow still falling and people in their homes, silence reigned supreme. Watson's gaze drifted occasionally towards Holmes, only to find each time he was already being watched as their gazes met. He was not sure what Holmes was seeing, but it was clearly quite vexing. It was a relief when the cab pulled up to Baker street, and home.
"Eh. Do we... do we even know this many people?" John breathed as he tentatively made his way through the piles.
“May I?” he asked softly, hands whispering down Sherlock’s quivering flanks, toying with his shirt-tails.
Mike waited until John was out of earshot to speak again carefully watching to be sure he wouldn't be able to hear.
Sherlock's hand entwined itself into John's as they strolled through the gardens. The stables were a mere dot on the horizon and having some more time alone was something Sherlock did not want to pass up. Even he had to admit that there was a fantasy like beauty to the place, beams of sunlight shone through gaps between trees, illuminating dust motes and giving the green glades a surreal glowing quality. The faint trickle of the river and birds chirping played in the background, and the occasional flower bush or bed added an explosion of vibrant colour to the landscape. John could see why Sherlock would have hidden outside when he was young, it was breathtaking. He had fallen into step with Sherlock and held him close. It was incredibly romantic, the quiet stroll to the stables was a much appreciated chance to enjoy just being near the other, able to look and smile and just be. They were comfortable to walk in silence, talking would have broken the spell somehow.
There was a soft knock on the door and he knew it was John. "Come in" he called, still writing furiously. John tiptoed inside and smiled down at Sherlock's sprawled form. "What are you up to then Sherlock?" he asked jovially, settling into a chair. Sherlock looked up for a moment and half smiled tiredly "Writing..." he trailed off, staring intensely at John and then going back to his page. John looked at him with concern, he sounded so serious and it seemed like John should be the same. "Well can I hear what you have so far?" John asked nervously, wondering if he was overstepping. Sherlock froze for a moment and then sat up so his legs were against John's. He didn't move away. God if John only knew how many mornings he had spent in this exact position, wondering if there was any point in hoping at all, constantly hurting himself just by watching John have a life outside of him. It hurt, God did it hurt "You were the one who inspired it so..." Sherlock muttered gently to himself before clearing his throat and righting the instrument on his lap. Softly he began to sing
Harry smirked and coughed a bit then continued her interrogations. "I was thinking it was probably you who convinced him, you seem pretty convincing. But now..." she grinned "Now I'm thinking it's the other way around. According to my reliable sources Johnny here's packing" she winked at Sherlock as John spluttered and blushed furiously "HARRY!" he groaned, putting his hands over his face "are we really going to do this? Again?" She shrugged in response and rounded back on Sherlock. Sure enough John's gaze had flitted to the window and the street outside. If only wishes could become reality, then he would not have to suffer this embarrassment. Alas there was no poof of smoke to take them away. "Clara was out with John shopping for this concert they were going to right? And Johnny lets her pick out stuff for him because she works in fashion and just knows her stuff. Anyway so picture John here just trying on everything that she tosses into the changing room without a second glance at what it is because he only wants to leave, he's got lectures and then training to go to or whatever. So Clara, being the stylist, gets a pair of leather skinnys and hands them in, not really thinking through the logistics. She's waiting outside and calls to him to come out, and he's not one for preening himself in the mirror first, so he just strides out in nothing but a pair of leather trousers that left NOTHING to the imagination. Needless to say I heard all about it when she came home. Well, am I right?" Sherlock simply smirked and lifted his cup to his lips, jolting slightly in surprise at the sweetness of the coffee inside. "Cinnamon chai latte" John murmured, gaze still directed to the outdoors.
It had been an interesting case, an eight on the scale for the sheer vastness of the population involved. Then again, even John had known to try the funeral home for the killer, but John was smarter than most anyway. It had been hilarious to see the blank stare in Anderson's eyes when John had mentioned that. Sherlock had never been happier to be a small step behind. The glorious thing was that the case didn't end there. Oh no, the whole spree went so much deeper than that. Paul, or rather Pauline, was the original killer but her victim, a seemingly innocent man had not been a "random" kill. It was a hit, sent out by the large scale gambling ring that Pauline was indebted to. They too had received orders from elsewhere, and the trafficking ring that had grown in the sewers of London (Sherlock made a note to warn John next time they were going somewhere like that. The tears in John's eyes as they sprinted through had made him very angry) did not spring from nothing. An entire week and a half later and they had reached the top tier. The trail had lead to one place most people would not have even thought of. Sherlock had suspected after day three but "evidence" was what Lestrade had wanted, evidence was what he'd get.
“Thanks, but it's alright Mary, there's some things I need to settle with Mr Holmes here for a while. Just leave them there would you?” John said with a small smile, already turning his attention to removing the bloodied gauze with care.
Now now now now now now now now now now. Sherlock's senses were screaming at him, dragging him down, demanding satisfaction, release. The only type of release he had ever known. John had been gone for two weeks now, he had left in a fit of anger and not returned since. Mrs. Hudson was also away, in the company of her ailing sister who was destined to die within the month. Sherlock was alone in Baker street, but he had been alone for much longer than that. His whole life had been one long tangent of being alone, finding someone who could perhaps be a friend and then burning that bridge. First Mycroft, now his John... Sherlock curled in tighter, hugging his knees against his chest as he had done for so many years, the position almost second nature, his muscle memory had not forgotten even after all this time the comfort the stillness had once offered him. Not anymore. Comfort was John and lumpy jumpers and the smell of tea and a crooked grin and a pat on the arm and an inappropriate giggle. Tonight comfort was absent, it had been for 12.5 nights now.
John opened one eye and reminded himself that he was on the floor of 221b with a very clingy Sherlock draped around him like a blanket. Sherlock had not lied to Lestrade, they had been very very busy indeed. They didn't call him three continents Watson for no reason. He smirked to himself as he gently rolled over, placing Sherlock on the ground and putting himself against his chest. There he could move about properly even when Sherlock's arms wrapped around him. He nestled against his fiancé and sighed happily, thinking about the night before. He still hadn't gotten over the shock that Sherlock had actually proposed to him, got down on one knee and proposed. The same Sherlock who had in the past adamantly insisted himself incapable of emotion and even still had just barely told John that he loved him a fortnight ago. If this was a very detailed dream stemming from some sort of coma he'd been left in after Sebastian, well he hoped it didn't end. Sherlock had been so... He was reluctant even in his head to use the word sweet to describe him but that was the only adjective he could think of. Thinking of adjectives he was pretty vague on the meaning of the word ardently, sure he'd seen Pride and Prejudice (the one with Keira knightley of course) enough times to get the general gist of it being a positive thing but apart from that he really didn't know what it meant.
“Huh? Yes, why wouldn’t I be?” Sherlock frowned, overlooking the evidence board where details of the latest case has been scattered.
The car glided to a halt outside the gates and Sherlock hopped out, followed moments later by Greg who sent the last in a series of texts before realising they'd stopped. The gates were unlocked and a light shove meant all they had to do was walk inside. The driveway was long, supposedly to lengthen the distance an escapee would have to navigate before reaching freedom, which was logical enough. Greg spoke to the driver briefly and he simply nodded his understanding, twenty minutes and he was to be at the front doors with the car, just in case. Sherlock was fidgeting, anxious now that they would be too late. "You remember what I told you?" he gave Greg a piercing look, and Greg simply adjusted his stance and grunted the affirmative, loading his gun quietly as they began they're descent. The wind whispered through the trees and blew stray leaves across their path, like tumbleweed in an old western movie.
It was when he tried to move away, up and off of John's lap that he finally snapped back and held Sherlock's hip, keeping him in place. He was pink up to his ears now and if John didn't know better he'd have said he looked on the verge of tears. Softly John slid a hand beneath his chin and lifted Sherlock's face up. "Don't, don't hide yourself, your emotions, from me, Sherlock. I want to see when you're embarrassed, or ashamed, or upset, or angry, or lonely, or content or excited, I want to see it all. Everything. Anything you'll give me. Your deductions, your ideas, your observations, your worries, your hopes, your feelings..." John's other hand moved slowly down, caressing shoulder, arm, chest, stomach, hand, thigh and he leaned in so he'd be whispering straight into Sherlock's ear because in this at least he had practice, even if he was still shocked (which he was) seduction? That he could do. "your breath," A warm exhale against the shell of Sherlock's ear elicited a shudder "your body," Slow, careful hands just barely ghosting across tender flesh and Sherlock was vibrating in his skin, his hands trying to rip through John's shirt "your heart," A hitch in his breath "Yourself. Can I have you, Sherlock Holmes?" "John..." A barely breathed plea.
"What am I going to do without you?" John asked, his voice cracking. "We were supposed to have so much more time! I don't... Christ I miss you already Sherlock and you're right next to me." Sherlock swallowed the lump in his throat and said nothing, but his long hand reached out and fell on top of John's. The message was clear- I'm still here."Sherlock..." Some movement then and Sherlock's eyes could pick out the pinpricks of light in John's as he turned to face him. "Why are we here?" He was thankful John had, for once, asked the right question.
Sherlock felt strange fluttering in his stomach and it unnerved him. It must have shown on his face because John was quick to try and grill him. Sherlock was not ready to try answer the questions he knew were coming quite yet, so he silenced John and was inordinately grateful when he kept his mouth shut. The room was nice, although the cleaner who had stripped his bed was having  several affairs with staff members, Sherlock had no real objections to the room. Unless the fact that John's bed was not part of his own counted. The stray thought would have thrown him for a loop not too long ago but now... that was almost innocent.He stripped off his coat, enjoying the secretive glances that John gave him as he did so. He'd worn the purple shirt on purpose just because he knew John liked clambered onto the couch and shut his eyes, hands nestled under his chin. It was time to play the waiting game.
On the floor of the sitting room. I was in my mind palace and when I attempted to get up I lost consciousness. I have tried repeatedly but the results have been the same -SH
It had been weeks since he'd heard from Mycroft at all, Lucia was his only point of contact to his world at the moment, and not for lack of trying. He texted the man every single day, saying good morning, how Sherlock was doing, and sometimes (when he was feeling particularly needy) that he missed him. He'd gotten no response. At all. Sighing wearily and pulling on a towel on the way to the kitchen he checked his phone again, mentally berating himself for how deeply he had let this man affect him. Chances were that he knew how Greg felt about him already- he was related to Sherlock after all - and skipped town, laying low in Vienna or more likely somewhere different entirely. Two messages. The first from Lucia, but he left that for last because who knew what it would say? John's message was from this morning, only an hour ago. 'Greg, sorry that we ran out on you but my sister is in hospital at the moment and... I'll explain it all later because it's insane. No need to worry, your secret is safe with me by the way. It'll all work out -J' Greg smiled briefly, trust John to try reassure him even when he's sitting in hospital with his sister. Recoiling from the array of fingers and whatever that squishy pink stuff was in the fridge he popped two slices of bread into the toaster and sat down softly before reading Lucia's message. 'I was unaware that had not been responding to you but rest assured we will be having a very frank conversation. If you still feel the same way about him when we return in two weeks know that I will not have said a word. I may just have to slap him if he messes this up with you Greg. Will report back later, give Sherlock and John my best -L' Smiling at the kindness of the woman he'd come to be great friends with, Greg sat back and munched his toast plain. Whatever was going to happen between him and Mycroft, at least he'd be put out of his misery soon.
Sergeant Donovan whistled "This guy doesn't even know the freak and already he's got the idea of him... Knew exactly what to say to him. I'd be impressed if it wasn't so creepy" Sherlock bristled next to him and Lestrade saw what was coming. " Is there a gap? The next one is the 3rd of March 2011... and why do you have copies of your own leters?" Sherlock nodded, glared, but didn't elaborate. Lestrade began to read "Dear John, Surprisingly enough you're not as boring as I expected you would be. There was no whining in your letter, and you asked about my case. Adrenaline junkie then, you live for danger, but also have a compulsion to help others around you and therefore army doctor was an easy choice to make, that and the fact that you have no close attachments in your family, likely one member is addicted to something, probably a substance I'm going with alcoholic and you wanted away from them, close family then, sibling, older brother perhaps? Explains why you didn't receive any other post at Christmas, you're unattached. As for the case, my client was acquitted after I proved that at the time of the murders he was six doors down house breaking. The actual murderer was one of the victim's children. Apparently the three victims were in a polyamourus relationship and the child was doing an internship at a butchery, an invitation to stay over for Christmas was the final straw and he killed them all! I did some sketches for my notes and sent them along in case you wanted to see it all. I find visual aids to be rather useful for most people, after all my mind palace is very visual. London is quiet at the moment, it's hateful. Hopefully someone will do something clever soon, my land lord is taking issue with the fingers I put in the vents. Clearly he doesn't appreciate my experiments. If you have no other arrangements I am available, of course if you do I will just find something else to do. I'm sure Mummy will have planned yet another dastardly party. When do you arrive anyway? In regards to the saliva coagulation I have concluded that it takes thirty two hours and fifty three seconds. The fingers should be done now, Sincerely Sherlock."
Sherlock barely caught the small pout the nurse shot John’s way before the tray was placed at the bedside table and the door closed behind her. He frowned as he registered a niggling feeling in his head.
The scene was a small house on the outskirts of London. John paid the cabbie and smiled as he ducked under the police tape that was being held up by Sherlock. Donovan was staring at them and snickering, and John bristled for a moment before Sherlock stepped in. "Donovan! I see you're scrubbing floors again with Anderson. I take it his wife is out of town? Oh she's not out of town, but you liked the added danger of getting caught!" Sherlock cried gleefully as they sauntered past and into the house, leaving a blushing Donovan behind. John was chuckling to himself and Sherlock was grinning when they went inside the sitting room. John's laugh died on his lips. Lestrade began talking "Male, age approximately 35, still no ID..." John butted in there. "I know him. Sergeant Charles McNamara, 5th fusiliers brigade. My old company in Afghanistan." John had gone pale, and Sherlock could feel his weight leaning against him. He took over from there.
John eyed his left hand - perfectly steady as it caressed Sherlock’s in minute strokes. He thought back to the question posed by the man’s elder brother earlier; what was he doing? Was he really considering this - risking everything to pursue something more with this sad, misunderstood,
"Christ you're beautiful. I still can't believe you married me, seems like some sort of dream that I bloody never want to wake up from." John kissed him again, straining hard against his seatbelt to reach more of Sherlock's skin.
Sherlock unlocked the back door with ease and Greg reminded himself to buy a bolt lock for his office tomorrow. The inside was almost as he had imagined it would be, bar the flickering lights. They had no lights at all but the beam of the torch. It illuminated grubby walls with black streaks running down them and hard concrete floors. Sherlock swiveled the ray from side to side, showing the harsh reality of the hospital. Even through the tiny porthole windows in the doors Greg could see dentists chairs with straps on them surrounded by electrical equipment and it was hard not to think about the people who'd been forced to submit to shocks frying their brain simply because they were born with a disorder. Thinking about it, that was exactly what had happened to John earlier. Greg couldn't help but see his friend's face contorted in agony in his head. He shivered and resolved to look straight ahead. Sherlock was staring intently at the ground and when Greg followed his gaze he saw the footprints that had been left in the dust. They were in the right place then. Seemed like Sherlock had flawless instinct where John was concerned.
They were led to a door and Mary stepped in first, the doctors office equipped with everything they'd need to get this done. "Hello, I'm Dr Stapleton and I'll be handling you all through Ms Morstan's pregnancy." The brown haired woman smiled at them and shook hands before gesturing the table. "That's my cue" Mary smiled as she hopped up and the doctor began to go through what would happen. Unnecessary for this particular party, John was a doctor, and Sherlock had done more research than most practitioners would ever have had to learn, at this stage he was confident he could deliver the babe himself, and Mary had gone through all of this before with her best friend, right down to holding the woman's hand at the birth.
"It's... I would like to but... My practical experience of em... This sort of thing would be limited to a singular occasion, right now, and I've gathered that this would be an issue for most." John gaped at him in disbelief. "That was your first kiss?!" Sherlock got a few shades darker as he nodded. Now that was truly unbelievable. Sherlock was a devastating creature, ridiculously good looking, talented, funny and smart, how on earth he was only just being kissed for the first time now at seventeen was something else. It would explain some of the reluctance in dancing the seduction: he truly didn't know how to. John felt a bit bad actually, his first kiss had been a much gentler affair with a pretty girl from the village, his first kiss with another boy had been a dare at a rather wild party about three years back. Not exactly a gentle introduction to the world of intimacy in any case.
John marveled at him, waiting till they were home to ask him how he'd figured everything out. Sherlock had calmly explained it to him for a while, tempted to leave out the bit where he'd gotten Mycroft to give some SAS men a quick tip about the shooters that had almost ruined his life, after which John was awestruck.
John couldn't help but worship the man in his arms, fondness and awe radiating off him as he brushed his hands through Sherlock's curls and teased his teeth across his jaw. "You're too beautiful Sherlock, so beautiful I can't breathe sometimes just for looking at you. You don't even know how perfect you are to me. I look at you and wonder how anyone could be so utterly fucking glorious as you are." John breathes it into his skin with every breath and it's so much, Sherlock can only whimper back at him, press himself against John, pleading with him to touch, to take. And John, ever tuned to what Sherlock needs, lowers them to the ground right there in the living/dining room and stares hard into Sherlock's eyes, they're watering now with the emotion of what they are doing, what they're about to do, black orbs rimmed with silver like a lunar eclipse in a puddle.
Later, when they were sweaty and panting in bed, thoroughly debauched, Sherlock turned and looked at John very seriously. "We should probably discuss this now. Do you want children? And yes I know we'd need a different set of genitalia to achieve that but the question stands, do you?" John furrowed his brow. "I don't know Sherlock, maybe. I could live happily without them." Sherlock smiled to himself at John's utter selflessness. He had skirted very well around saying that he wanted them, but if Sherlock didn't he was ok with that. "Plus" John added, shuffling closer "The only person I'd want them with is you and seeing as that's physically impossible... what about you?" Sherlock smirked. "Maybe. I don't think I'd make a good father though, and there is no one I would want them with but you so I suppose that's a no go." At that precise moment Sherlock's phone buzzed. He scoffed and John tilted his head.
Besides, the numbers on your arm would appear meaningless, jumbled up except when laid eyes upon by your intended. If seen by the right person, he or she would see his date of birth. John had seen his on Sherlock’s arm. The thing is, he had no way of knowing if the numbers were in their original jumbled mess and just happened to say
Running his fingers through his curls one last time, Sherlock pulled on his suit jacket. John was waiting for him by the door dressed immaculately in a charcoal suit with a black tie. They matched, but Sherlock's tie was a deep plum. "Shall we?" He asked, putting on his poshest accent. "We shall" replied John, opening taxi door. "Where to?" "12 Grimmauld place"
"John Watson you are the most improbable man..." and before John could blink the hands in his shirt were pulling him impossibly closer and Sherlock was kissing him. Sherlock was kissing him. Sherlock. Kissing him. He didn't even close his eyes he was in such a state of shock, dimly he was aware of the fact that he should probably respond, or do something at least, but his brain had short circuited and was blissfully unoccupied with thoughts other than pure surprise. Sherlock broke away and John just oggled at him, all flushed cheeks and lips just slightly swollen from the kiss and looking a bit nervous which for Sherlock meant he was panicked and then he opened his mouth and said "Did I do it wrong?" genuinely looking to know if he was a bad kisser like that was even in the realm of possibility. And as John just kept staring he flushed even more, dipping his face down and away, like John couldn't see that he was quite embarrassed without doing that, after all Sherlock was in his lap, he didn't exactly need the lights to be on to know what was lying against his thigh.
, not blind. Who could deny that Holmes was beautiful? Statuesque, porcelain skin, and all the features of Michelangelo’s David with a mouth that looked as sinful as any John had noted on a woman. He had seen more of Holmes through the years than he had ever hoped he would be allowed to, and for an age had felt guilty at his secret admiration of Holmes’s lithe form, acerbic wit, and astonishing intellect.
He breaks their kiss, running his hand through the curls that have come into full force as they had been together, and Sherlock locks eyes with him, and John aches, aches to his core he is so completely in love that he does not think he can look for much longer and so begin the slow exploration of skin with his lips.
John felt a jab in his side and looked up to find the others were already out of the car and waiting for him. Cheeks lightly coloured he clambered out and followed on behind the two of them. Every hospital felt the same to him, and sitting in yet another bloody waiting room was becoming a monthly activity. At least this was a comfort zone for him, Sherlock was shifting in his seat and making intense eye contact with the door. John rubbed his leg absentmindedly, noting with no small amount of pride that Sherlock relaxed after only a few minutes of it. Of course it was much easier to be calm when you weren't even looking at the various stares and glares you're receiving from women in varied states of pregnancy.
