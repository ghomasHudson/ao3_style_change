Tony sighs and grabs his cup of coffee. Peter was so young and so old at the same time. He was constantly worrying about things no kid his age should be concerned about. Yet he still needed a story at night and god forbid you forgot to turn on the night light. It turned into a major meltdown. He can feel Peter sneaking glances over at him.
Tony is pulled from his thoughts as Beverly dumps her seashells onto the glass patio table. His first instinct is to yell at her and then check the table for scratches. Her smile would turn into a straight line and her little face would scrunch up before the tears and cries come. He might even spank her. It was something Howard would have done and Tony wondered how deeply it had affected him. After they had adopted Peter, Steve had gone to the library and come home with a stack of parenting books. Tony as per usual gave him a hard time about it and said all the books were ridiculous, however, he did read them in secret. In his workshop, as he waiting for code to compile or tests to run, he would read through them and take down notes. Steve would give him a knowing smile whenever Tony would absentmindedly reference something from one of the books.
“That’s better, now, say it.”
The routine being Tony saunters in, Steve tells him to leave and Tony refuses. Twenty minutes later they’re breathing heavily and slipping their clothes back on as Steve glares daggers at him. Tony doesn’t know why they play this pretend game if it’ll only lead up to that, but somehow the sex is a lot more fun that way.
Tony’s eyes fixated on his, “Captain.”
Steve let his eyes fall on the sight, and oh god  Tony was right, the head of his cock was peeking from his panties, dribbling pre come and all. Tony reached down to rub the head with the tip of his finger, and Steve arched up in response, feeling ripples of pleasure course through him.
The problem is, Steve’s been thinking about his offer for a month now, and it’s turned unhealthy. Like feeling guilty when he has to make a passing glance at Tony unhealthy.
One of his hands let go of the hold he had on his newspaper, wiping the sweat from his brow and feeling around him. Tony was currently taking a well needed bath, so he couldn’t have taken it, but knowing him he probably would've wanted to attach some weird technology on it to make it fly.
Tony’s silent for a moment, then. “I didn’t mean to make you feel uncomfortable, can we just move on? It won’t happen again,” he says, sounding almost desperate. As if there’s something else to lose besides the overt awkwardness.
The brunet shakes his head a bit, as if trying to come to grips with Steve’s curiosity. “Tony if you don’t--”
“He’s pretty good looking, yeah.” Tony dismissed, Jan stared him down, and Tony finally broke.
“We are on vacation now, aren’t we, Stark?”
With that, Steve headed back to his room, getting the suit off and freshening up a bit. From there, he took one of the babydoll sets he had, a soft lavender with lace straps and top leading down to sheer material that brushed against his pecs, and a ribbon in the center. The panties were the same color, lace and a thong this time, followed by sheer stockings and a frilly white garter belt. Reaching in the back of his closet he grabbed a pair of nude heels, as he slipped them on he felt himself sigh in relief.
“Looks like we could use another bath,” Steve said when he finally caught his breath. It was still too damn hot but he was sure he could feel another breeze soon.
“There is no date, I stopped him the other day for speeding, which definitely doesn’t constitute a date.”
“I know.”
He couldn't remember what had been said, all he knew at that moment was that he was face up on the floor with Steve's boot snug against his neck. He also knew his cock was straining against boxers that Steve would find obscenely expensive. Steve pushed down harder and Tony let out a gurgle that was meant to be a cry.
“We’re men. Men masturbate. We’re adult men, we can be open about masturbation.”
“You need to lay off the drinks,” said Anthony.
4. Tony was genuinely exhausted after three meetings back to back, avenging crap, and another meeting to squeeze in after. The suit was the first thing off of him, he just needed a minute on the couch, just one minute.
Steve let a not quite full on grin pass his lips. “Do we need to go over anything before we get started?”
Tony slowly lifted himself up and spoke, “This doesn’t mean you’ll stop going commando, right?”
“We’re still going out to dinner though.”
“Jesus, Stark,” he grunts as he feels Tony’s mouth take more of him down, and then his throat god his throat-- no one should be able to do that, and yet Tony is taking him down seamlessly, as though he were born to do so. Steve lifts his hips and grabs a fistful of Tony’s hair, fucking his mouth and groaning when he hears Tony gag and feels it. His nerves alight, every single one in tune with Tony’s mouth sucking him dry. He can feel the hand in Tony’s hair shake, his hips slowly losing rhythm.
“Don’t tell me you’ve forgotten already,” Tony asked right next to Steve’s ear.
For a moment, Steve pressed his erection against Tony’s steadily growing one, and then backed up with ease, around the island, and out of the kitchen. Tony nearly keeled over, clutching the edge of the countertop and trying to catch his breath. Tony knew Steve could be playful, cocky even (no pun intended), but this was a side of him Tony was utterly
“You’re adorable, and short.” Antonio replied, followed by Anthony shoving him slightly. Anthony was not that short.
” not-Steve says, brushing the pad of his thumb against Tony’s cheek and looking at him. This time Tony doesn’t feel the sense of comfort he usually gets when Steve looks into his eyes. He feels sick.
“Night, Rogers,” Tony sighed out, snuggling against Steve’s chest.
Steve makes a shushing noise, pulling Tony's head down into a slow kiss, locking their fingers together, and again, Tony's still searching for more in the seven minutes they have, six minutes now.
“What isn’t good, is that you’re incredibly hard and not in me.”
“The way you were touching me, I assumed you wanted something else.”
“What you’re not understanding is that these rules are not just a handout. Patience works both ways, pet, and I’m willing to wait for you to be serious and get it right--”
A small noise left him when he ran his forefinger against his entrance, he wondered what Steve’s cock looked like, was it cut or uncut, was it as big as he fantasized, was the head of his cock sensitive, and who did he think about when he jerked off. He would be so lucky if they were the same thoughts he had, thoughts of him being held down and fucked post mission on the Quinjet, adrenaline pumping from a treacherous battle—Tony gripped the base of his cock to calm himself once more, gasping as he did so.
He got on all fours, wanting to come off as seductive to please Steve, but he felt so exposed, like an open wound. Steve stared at him as if a constant stream of ideas of what he wanted to do to Tony were occupying his thoughts, but he said nothing. His legs were spread invitingly, and his fingers were resting on his chin, it was beckoning, and caused Tony to be aware of the fact that they hadn’t even kissed yet.
(See the end of the chapter for
to signify he was finished.
“Come here,” said Steve.
“Are you aware of how fast you were going back there?” Handsome asked, face tight and gaze even, then proceeded to squint. “Aren’t you the guy who orders a million donuts every morning?”
“Clean up, I have a meeting in half an hour.”
Back at the tower, Tony decided to count that situation as something that was a thing they weren’t supposed to bring up, ever. He was familiar with those type of circumstances, that’s how he thrived as Tony Stark. Tony jerked off and fingered himself all night that night, and after that he could look Steve in the eye (and groin) without instantly getting a hard on.
Tony licked at the tip, sucking up the precome eagerly, which got a distinct exhale from Steve.  The hand in his hair gripped harder, but Tony refused to rush. He took his time, licking along the shaft, then back up to the head. He enjoyed the texture along his tongue, sucking the tip, then moving to suck on his balls. One of his hands stroked up and down simultaneously, in sync with the sucking along the tip of Steve’s cock, and Steve’s hips bucked in time with Tony’s rhythm.
God, they should probably establish rules of some sort, but he doesn’t want to care about someone else's well being right now. Maybe part of the reason why he wants Tony to begin with is because he’s aware of his lack of self care. Even if it becomes too much, Tony won’t tell him to stop, the recognition of his own boundaries being an afterthought. Steve shouldn’t want that, he shouldn’t enable the brunet's staggeringly unhealthy behaviors and habits, but again, he doesn’t want to care.
Tony’s shaking uncontrollably now, wanting to lean into the touch, but instead, he pulls his face in the opposite direction and struggles against the chains a bit.
Antonio rolled his eyes. “Darling, sex has nothing to do with how badly we treat each other. Yes, I am partially to blame--not that any of you are shocked, but you two still have a chance. We’re all screw ups, after all. Especially you, Tony.”
“Yes Master, please Master!”
fast (granted, he didn’t even bother glancing at what the speed limit was but who actually complied to the speed limit on the highway). Just as he’d managed to swallow down the last of doughnut and itched to sip a bit of his coffee, he heard the annoying siren of the car go off once, twice, and fuck okay he should pull over.
It was strange, but Tony liked it.
Tony didn’t remember saying he was going to nap a bit, but he drifted off, with Steve’s arms wrapped around his waist, which left enough leeway for him to fall asleep.
“Details.”
Tony flickered his gaze to the basket of bread he’d been tempted to grab before Steve arrived. “I’m not exactly well versed. I’ve done some research, but the doms I’ve encountered weren’t the best, to put it kindly.”
“These first meetings are always awkward, no matter how many times you do them, which reminds me, how much experience do you have?” Steve asked, keeping his gaze on Tony’s eyes.
Steve—it can't possibly be his Steve. He feels nauseous again, but he’s afraid of showing any vulnerability that could allude to him being weak (despite being chained up and possibly playing at the hands of some grander scheme). He could possibly negotiate; maybe this Steve is a clone, but how?
“We can definitely bond through a threesome, and to my pleasant surprise both of you are very handsome. I’m obviously the best looking one, though.”
“Gorgeous,” Steve whispers, then flexes his fingers and slaps Tony’s butt again. Tony reaches for the sheets on the bed, gripping tightly and sniffing gently. Steve refuses to look at his face right now, something like guilt tugging at him at the same time as the urge to ruin the great Tony Stark, to break him down further and leave him a teary eyed mess.
Steve pulled out a pen from his pocket and outstretched Tony’s palm, writing down his number with a smile plastered on his face.
Tony’s knees felt weak.
“Why’d you come out?”
“I’m guessing you’re awake now?”
“Not hard enough. I’m here to test your limits, and I’m not telling you to do something you can’t do. So, again, from the top.”
Digging into Tony’s left pocket he rolled his eyes when he found a small tube of lubrication, how convenient of him.
The corners of Steve’s lips upturn into a smirk. “Been asking myself the same thing lately.”
Wrong answer apparently, or right, as far as Tony was concerned. In a flash, Steve's boot was back on his neck, harder this time, enough to feel all the air leave his windpipe at once.
“Come here.”
“10 years now. Feels like forever at this point. Sometimes I think it’s unhealthy to love him as much as I do.”
“He can’t be that mean... You did say you guys have slept together.” Tony was in denial, and Antonio had a sharp enough tongue to piss off just about anyone.
“I figured you’d get curious enough and ask.” Steve responded, playfulness apparent in his tone.
Tony looks just as shocked as Steve feels. “Oh--I honestly didn’t expect you to say yes. How about eight?”
Their fingers intertwined, and Tony didn’t want to go anywhere. He wanted to stay in bed and do this for hours until they remembered every contour of each other’s bodies. Sadly, Steve pulled away too soon.
Peter is transfixed by a cartoon on the television as the adults are busy getting ready for the day and discussing the plan for the afternoon. Ben is sitting at the kitchen table reading the news on a StarkPad. A plate with dirty silverware and a half empty coffee cup sit next to him. May is in the bathroom blowdrying her hair. The sound permeating out to the main living area. Everyone is doing their own thing for breakfast. Steve walks into the room all dressed for the day. He scoops up Ben’s plate on his way to the kitchen. “You done with this?”
“You’re still up,” Peter’s voice draws Tony from his revery.
“That doesn’t explain how…”
“His husband is Tony Stark, you know that? Of Stark Industries? IronMan?”
“Are you alright?”
Tony didn’t know if it was something Peter needed to hear but he felt like it could be. He didn’t know what was going through the kid’s head. The adoption agency had recommended taking him to a therapist. Every week they took him and the therapist would chat with them after each session. As much as Peter had made progress towards a normal childhood there were always going to be things lurking just beneath the surface. Losing his parents so young and having to bounce around homes for a couple years. Peter doesn’t respond to his statement but seems to relax a little more in his hold.
“If I was allowed to hit her.”
She focuses on Steve next while Clint silently takes in the room.
Tony had been keeping a low profile. He hadn’t stormed into Stark Industries and taken the company back. He had pulled out a large amount of money from what Steve considered to be a questionable offshore account. Bought random things from hardware stores, busted up some walls. He repaired them of course. Assuring Steve that it wasn’t even noticeable.
“Sam! I didn’t hurt my kid!”
“No Daddy! We can’t leave yet! You said we could get ice cream while we’re downtown,” Peter complains as he walks circles around his parents.
“I’ve got you, it’s going to be okay, you’re going to be okay,” Peter says.
Tony didn’t really even want to see Steve. It was another reminder of how he couldn’t get someone to stay and love him. He could cancel, spend the day alone in his workshop bury himself in work. It wasn’t fair to Steve though. Their relationship had been great and he had been nothing but kind and supportive. Even offering to watch Morgan to give him and Pepper more alone time.
“We’re having a lot of behavioral problem with Peter.”
Steve kisses down his neck, down his chest, his mouth pausing over a nipple hot breath teasing the sensitive skin. “I miss you,” Steve pleads with him showing a vulnerability he only lets a few people see. Both men look towards the kitchen suddenly as it sounds like something had slid off the counter and crashed onto the floor. They both look at each other uncertain. A few seconds later the same sound and then it repeats again. Until suddenly it sounds like a pile of things crashing into the ground. Steve pushes himself up and quickly grabs his shield from behind the dresser and looks back at Tony. “Stay in here, I’ll check it out.”
Steve and Tony were working hard at putting the whole incident behind them. Many things had returned back to normal. While Tony returned to his Stark Industries duties right when they returned, Steve took more time off. Each night before bed, he would give Peter his bath. Steve used to set him up in the bath and leave to do other things. Finish the dishes in the sink or do some sweeping up. Now he stayed in there the whole time. After a week of watching Peter closely he returned to the satellite SHIELD office in NYC. The call from Agent Coulson was welcome because the information he could provide would allow them some closure.
Peter reluctantly comes in the room still holding the offending toy. He quickly hides it behind his back when he sees Steve eyeing it. “You can not hit your sister, do you understand me?”
“Most of the day. I can’t get it out of my head.”
“I’m fine. Need a minute to wake up. Will you go make sure your sister is okay?”
“We’re happy to watch Peter anytime you need. But Ben and I have decided we’re not having kids.”
Tony lets go of Peter and takes a step back surveying the room.
“I don’t—This was a mistake,” Beverly says standing up slowly and starting up the stairs.
Note: If you don’t want a reply, for any reason (sometimes I feel shy when I’m reading and not up to starting a conversation, for example), feel free to sign your comment with “whisper” and I will appreciate it but not respond!
“I’m not hungry. Can we talk? Because I want to know what Steve has been telling you.”
“How long have I been,” Tony starts followed by a pregnant pause.
“Yes,” Tony says while Steve tells him he hasn’t.
“We’re married, right? But we sleep in separate beds?”
“Why don’t you read the label, Tony?” Steve teases but there isn’t much behind the words like he’s going through the motions.
She turns her head to look up at him, “the room is too big.”
“Yes, Tony they are. Safely tucked into their beds”
“I’m sorry,” Steve whispers.
“I believe you Steve.”
Beverly giggles at the word. Tony and Steve struggle with the criss-cross straps of her sundress before finally getting it on her.
“I’m sorry. I’ll be really good for Aunt May and Uncle Ben. I promise.”
“Tony can I talk to you about something?” Steve asks ignoring Tony’s insult.
Tony sits up as Peter is crawling into the bed. He stands up and tucks Peter under the covers.
“I can’t concentrate,” Steve confesses.
“It was a bottle of wine. My boyfriend broke up with me and I just wanted to forget for a minute. You ignored me as soon as I got here.”
It’s fairly quiet when Steve arrives and he wonders where Pepper and Morgan are at. He was expecting to come to a full house. Tony is sitting at the dining table nursing a cup of coffee. Tony’s personal chef is preparing food for brunch. Steve grabs a cup and joins Tony at the table.
Peter snorts from the backseat and buries his face in his hands as he tries to stop laughing.
“No, Steve should—” Peter lets out a yelp as Tony swats at his bottom like he’s a small child. It of course didn’t hurt but it was unexpected.
“I mean emotionally. No-one has questioned if your children are intelligent.”
Peter doesn’t need to told twice as he bounds up the stairs. Tony is leaning against the kitchen counter by the basement door.
“Nat.”
Steve comes in the room with a laundry basket on his hip. He sits it on the table and it’s full of Peter’s freshly washed clothes. He starts to dig through it, “should we just leave him in pajamas? We’re not going anywhere.”
“She gets scared at night. They have her in a secure room for an Inhuman. It’s not a kids room. The walls are dark and plain. She told me she doesn’t want to stay there at night and I’m suppose to ignore that? She’s my kid.”
She kneels in front of him. “How’d you hit your head sweetie?” She asks him questions as she runs through some checks for a concussion.”Will you let me look at it?” He shakes his head and moves further into the couch. “Peter I really have to check.”
“Boston’s friendly neighborhood Spider-man. Did you tell him New York misses him?”
“I was waiting in the office for Dad to pick me up. I was really upset that he didn’t come. Like mad mad. So I ran over to the office lady when he picked up my backpack and yelled I’ve never seen this man before in my life.”
“When is that?”
Tony smirks at Steve thermometer hanging of his mouth and Steve blushes back at him.
“Sure. Thank you. Hope to see you soon.”
Phil stands up, grabs his briefcase and walks over to the table. He sets two folders on the table as the other two men make cups of coffee. He makes a cup for himself before he opens the top folder.
Steve is already out of the room and heading outside. Shouting Peter’s name. He’s soon joined by Tony who’s holding a broken camera in his hand. It was what he had placed above the sliding door to alert him if Peter was sneaking out. “Peter trashed our phones. And this. I’ll put on my suit and fly over the forest to look for a heat signature.”
Peter looks over him a little taken aback. “You sound really okay with that.”
“Lying to Tony. Like that old movie May loves. While You Were Sleeping. With Sandra Bullock.”
“Please,” Steve says as he tries to calm Peter.
“I thought my father forbade you from hunting here. Yup, I’m pretty sure he did.”
“Hey buddy, you scared me. Why are you still up?”
This author sees and appreciates all comments, but may not reply.
“But when did real people get their colors?”
He takes it and says, “it’s not bad.”
It’s nearly midnight by the time Peter actually gets discharged. They load up the car that Bruce had packed up and drove to the hospital to meet them after the rest of the team got on the Quinjet. Bruce had returned home after the first night. Peter is carefully buckled into the backseat and then wrapped with a blanket from the gift shop. Even with it being mid-summer they were worried about him catching a chill. Tony and Steve took turns on the drive back to the city. They collapse into bed when they finally make it home.
“Thanks,” Steve says offering his hand and looking at the whiteboard that listed out Peter’s doctor and nurse. “Stephanie, we appreciate it.”
“Our little boy,—” Tony groans and shifts under Steve’s weight, “—who loves you and thinks the world of you. ”
He nods slowly.  “It’s mine, why do I have to share?”
“Peter, for fucks sake.”
Steve won’t let go so Peter starts to scream but no sound comes out. He looks up at Steve horrified and confused about why he can’t make a sound. Steve pulls him forward and through the door propelling him forward before letting him go and crash into the wooden deck. The pain spreading through his nose and face is worse than anything he felt before. He curls up into himself and cries his silent tears. The sound still muted no matter how much he calls for Tony.
“It’s not funny you two.”
Steve felt safe in Tony’s arms as they cuddled up on the couch after eating. The empty popcorn bowl and glasses of Coca-Cola sat on the coffee table. On the long months of the mission he had forgotten what real comfort felt like. Tony loved him and and in this moment that was all he needed.
Tony is starting to doze off when Steve comes in the room and shuts off the television. The local reporter was outside Beverly’s childhood home detailing the mysterious death that happened. Two adults and one child dead from apparent carbon monoxide poisoning. Steve didn’t want his daughter to find out that way. Especially since she was the ‘dead’ child in question. To protect her, SHIELD had faked her death and destroyed her old identity. A new history was created and they were waiting on signatures to create her identity as Steve and Tony’s adopted daughter. Beverly Rose Stark and her past would be permanently sealed. And by sealed, they meant destroyed in a fire and unrecoverable.
“Hush now. Get up. We have somewhere to be.”
“Not a baby,” Peter mumbles against the grey fabric of Steve’s shirt.
“I spoke to Pete this morning. He’s excited about an experiment. Honestly most of it went over my head but I tried to keep up. He said they got tons of snow in Boston the other night. He went around helping people stuck in the snow,” Steve says trying to stave off the silence.
“Steve. You can’t keep signing her out and keeping her overnight. Fill out the paperwork. Make it official and we don’t have to keep doing this.”
“When should we start heading back to headquarters?” Tony asks from his spot on the recliner.
“Tony?”
“You don’t feel warm. But maybe we should have a doctor look at you anyway,” Steve says worried.
Peter: His face is so red. You broke him
“I remember you crying.”
Steve starts to clean up the toys and replace them in the box.
“Peter! What the hell are you doing?”
“Well actually—” Steve begins as he makes everyone stay on the call for another ten minutes. The meeting ends and the intern promises to send out the meeting notes after he finishes editing them. He stands up to check on the children again wanting to make sure the swelling on Beverly’s eye was going down. He’s disappointed to find Peter out of time-out and playing with his toys in the middle of the room.
Peter whips a shampoo bottle over at Steve’s legs. It misses and rolls across the bottom of the shower. Peter had been acting out severely since Beverly had come to live with them. They were working with a new psychologist they found in the area and trying to be more consistent in their discipline.
‘What’s that, Pops?” Peter asks as he finally retrieves what he had been searching for.
Steve goes into the living-room and sets down a glass of water. Tony peeks out from under his hand, “that’s not coffee babe.”
Peter is wiping at his cheek with the sleeve of his flannel. So child-like and innocent but the tone of his voice doesn’t reflect that. Tony misses the innocent teenager he once knew.
“Huh? You talking to me or the TV?”
“What?”
Beverly reaches across the table for a dish of m&ms. Tony grabs it before she can and puts a small amount of his plate for her. She eats her snacks and lets Tony play the game without interruptions.
“Then who did it? Am I supposed to think Aunt May did it?”
“Hey uh—”
That guilty smile crosses Peter’s face and he admits that he hasn’t. Steve pulls Peter close to him wrapping his arm around him. “We’re going to have a talk later,” he says softly before raising his voice to a normal speaking level. “Jerry and Marie, meet my son Peter.”
Thanks for reading. I hope everyone is staying safe and well.
Steve kisses his forehead. “Let’s get you home and cleaned up.  You’ll be feeling better in no time.” Steve accepts Peter’s hand into his time and they walk up the long driveway to the house.
“Can you two stop?” Steve asks.
“Okay but who will make us breakfast?”
Tony sits up and reaches for his phone to find it missing. “I swear I put my phone right here.”
“A boat? I don’t know. It looks big enough to be a ship.”
“Love you, kid,” Tony says as he leans down and kisses his forehead. Steve is next as he places a kiss on his cheek and whispers, “I love you.”
“Are you kidding me right now?” Tony scolds as he leans down to Peter’s level and grabs his shoulders roughly.
“He’d feel better if he would just sleep,” Steve says as he stares at Tony for a second before grabbing his StarkPad. He’d rather scroll through social media than continue their conversation from earlier.
“Peter.”
“Okay Peter. Nap time. Go to your room.”
“JARVIS, call the pediatrician and see if we can get someone out on a house visit. Send them Peter’s hospital records.”
“That sounds nice. When? Today?”
“Help me pack,” he tells her before noticing Tony in the doorway. “I’m sorry Tony but we’re heading home. I’m not staying in this place.”
Beverly: For me or him? Pops would be so confused if Dad vajazzled himself
“Maybe the Avengers aren’t real?”
“I know. I know. I give in to the tantrums.”
“I didn’t send you to your room. I just wanted to check your sister for a minute. You could have stayed right by me,” Steve explains as he tries to keep his voice calm.
Steve gets up and goes to the kitchen, making both of them glasses of water. He hands one to Tony before sitting on the couch.
“Not Jesus! Tony said we didn’t have to,” Beverly complains.
Tony laughs but doesn’t offer an answer. Because I love you. Because your smell comforts me.
“I sure as hell didn’t—”
“I like when you grow your beard in.”
Steve playfully puts him into a headlock. “What did you say?”
After the lighthouse tour they pick up sandwiches from a local shop and head to the waterfront park to eat. They roll out a picnic blanket to sit on. Tony was feeling decent earlier in the day but after lunch he started to develop a headache. Steve put his arm around, pulls him close and asks,
A few months have passed and Peter was doing well with recovery. Luckily there was no brain damage and his health had returned to normal. Steve still took him to weekly appointments to see the psychiatrist. They had a follow-up appointment with a specialist at the local hospital that he was dreading. Any mention of doctors or hospitals put Peter into a panic. It took forever to calm him back down. Steve had discussed it with the psychiatrist and there was a plan in place.
Steve gets called out on a mission over the holidays. Tony is stuck with two sick kids and has some unexpected visitors.
“Peter. He’s all upset I told him he had to sleep in his own bed. Why even wake him up?”
Peter looks at Tony pleadingly hoping his dad will override Steve’s punishment. “Your father is right. You could have gotten hurt or bit by that dog.”
“You hear that, Babe? Peter wants you to join us.”
“This isn’t real,” Peter says as he looks between them. “I must be asleep.”
“It’s way past your bedtime.”
Steve pushes his hand away, pausing to rub his thumb across Peter’s palm. He drops his hand and starts to rub his back. Steve’s body stops fighting sleep and his mind starts to drift. Peter had finally gotten quiet and Steve felt so relaxed. Being home, feeling safe, and surrounded by the ones he loved.
“You can’t do that Peter.”
“I’m sure you’ll want to discuss this all with Tony.”
“Are you a damn dog?”
“As you’ll remember we set up a team to investigate after the debriefing at the SHIELD office. Peter gave a rather interesting account of supernatural beings in the home. We have reason to believe he was telling the truth. We found evidence that an Asgardian demon was living on the property. You’ve heard of Kitsune in Japanese mythology, right?”
Peter wraps the blankets tighter around himself and moves closer to the edge of the couch. “No! You’re only doing that because I said something.”
“Dammit Tony! Were you even there when we were talking earlier? I’m just as lost as you are.”
“Not going to help?” Steve asks turning towards him. “Noticed you ran off when I was unloading groceries too.”
“They were alright. Traffic wasn’t great.”
“I thought we weren’t supposed to talk about it,” Peter says.
“Sure. He’s back from the dead. Confused. It’s ripe for you to play out whatever sick fantasy. How long have you been thirsting after him? The whole thing in Germany, tearing the Avengers apart, was that all because Tony rejected you?”
“You feeling alright?” May asks concerned.
“No! Papa stop!” He tries grabbing at Steve’s arm. “Leave it, please!”
“Is she in D.C.? Can I see her?”
“He’s darling,” May says as she pours two cups of coffee. She adds cream and sugar before walking back to their bedroom. Steve could relate with them wanting privacy. He had gotten used to Tony’s lifestyle and staying in luxurious hotels. He would usually spring for the Presidential  Suite. Steve had no idea why they would need two floors and floor-to-ceiling windows in a hotel room. They were bigger than this home they were staying in. They would usually have more than enough space for the two of them. This was feeling cramped to him. Strange for a man who grew up in a one bedroom apartment in Brooklyn but life had changed. He had changed.
*****
“A green Blow Pop.”
“Listen. It’s probably nothing but that sounds like a seizure to me. It’s not always spasms or convulsions.”
“Peter! That’s enough,” Tony cuts in, clearly shaken.  Peter startles and doesn’t understand why Tony is scolding him.
It's getting difficult to write a story set in summer when the high has been around 4 celcius and it's snowing almost every morning. It was still warm weather when I started the story. I'm making it work somehow. The chapter kept getting longer and didn't want to end. I hope it isn't too long. Thanks for reading.
“Nothing Tony. Go to bed,” Peter says in a matter-of-fact way.
“You’re thinking of Peter. He’s in college now,” Steve tries to answer vaguely without sounding obvious.
“Shut-up,” Tony cuts him off.
“Yes. I’m very sorry. Didn’t realize he wandered onto your property.”
“Don’t get smart with me,” Steve warns him as he goes into the kitchen and pours a glass of water. Peter sighs, both of his parents were being frustrating tonight.  He pads into the kitchen and leans on the counter. Peter grabs the half empty glass Steve just set down and drinks the rest of the water in before placing it back down. Steve grabs it and puts it under the tap and fills it again. “Are you done stealing my water?”
Peter’s acting out was wearing on his last nerve. “That’s enough with the ghosts. I don’t want to hear another word. This acting-out has to stop.”
Tony shakes his head. “Let me check Daddy. Open your mouth. We got to take your temperature. Papa get me the thermometer.”
“I can’t just abandon Iron Man or the Avengers. You know that. It’s who I am,” Tony pleads with her.
“You really can’t let your Papa shower by himself?”
“Isn’t it late for you to be out?”
“I want Tony,” Peter whispers softly.
“Because you got here so late. I had to be up early. Not everything is about you.”
Tony leads him into the living-room and makes him sit on the couch. He grabs a bag of peas and a towel from the kitchen. Instructs him to hold it to the back of his head. May is coming inside. “Is he alright?”
“And I used it.”
“Give me a minute,” he says as he mutes his headset and removes it from his ear before placing it on the desk. He takes a deep breath and walks into the other room, finding two screaming children.
“That’s good. I haven’t changed your diaper recently. Didn’t put you in pull-ups overnight. Any accidents?”
“Bevie, are they hurting?”
“Hey Steve! It’s me, just here to do my laundry,” Peter calls out after unlocking the door to the soldier’s apartment.
Steve rinses all the dishes in the sink and loads up the dishwasher. He looks at the empty coffee pot and washes that next. After he tidies up the kitchen he sits on the table by Ben. “We should leave within the next hour.”
Middle of summer and the trees are full of leaves making it impossible to see the forest floor. Jarvis was zooming in when he found heat signatures but nothing as a big as a child had showed up. He started to worry that Peter wasn’t even in the woods. He hoped Steve was checking in and around the house. He had to keep a clear head, he couldn’t let the worries about his son cloud his mind. It was still early morning, the sky still had that hazed over look it gets before the sun fully rises. Peter had left before Steve woke and it would have been full dark. Full dark, in a large forest with all types of animals that would view a human child as easy prey.
Tony sits at the dining table finishing up his project despite his headache.. He ignores the calls coming in from Steve on his phone. It had been hours and was past dinner time. He didn’t want to talk to him. It had taken almost that much time to get Peter to calm down again. He said he had a bad dream during his nap and then Steve had scared him when he starting yelling. In the past few minutes, Peter had been complaining he was hungry. Tony had given him a bag of chips. He was about to look through the fridge for something they could eat when Steve comes in the door with greasy burgers and milkshakes. “I got your favorite Pete. Strawberry. And chocolate for you, my love,” he says as he hands one to Tony. He leans down to kiss him and surprisingly the kiss is returned. “I broke some gym equipment. You’ll be seeing a charge soon.”
Steve is suddenly on full alert, thinking back to the days before Tony got sober. There was no such thing as one drink with Tony. He was of course fun at the beginning of the night. Not so much as it wore on, when depending on his drink of choice Tony could turn mean or sad. Steve could only take so many insults before it started to hurt. He could only take so many before he would start yelling back at Tony. Awful fights would occur and lead to awkward apologetic mornings. On the other end there is sad Tony, his mood would dip so low it was impossible to pull him out of it. It would bleed into the subsequent days and ultimately lead to another drinking session.
Tony startles out of his light sleep as the bathroom door pulls open. He feels the bed dip down as Steve gets into it. He doesn’t lie down though and Tony can feel his eyes on his back. Steve’s hand rests on his shoulder. Tony hopes he’ll lean in and kiss his cheek, offering some sort of comfort. Instead Steve moves away and settles into the bed. Making sure he keeps to his own side.
“But I’ve been good and I went to the doctor with Tony.”
It’s slightly chilly when Steve leaves his room and heads to the kitchen to start the coffee maker. It’s one of those rare morning where Tony is awake and getting ready for the day before him. Tony is already dressed, grabbing keys off the hook and slipping on shoes. “Need anything from the store, hun?”
Beverly is climbing onto his lap to show him something else.
“I’m going to listen your chest. Will you take a deep breath for me when I ask?”
Tony sighs and runs his hand through his hair. “I haven’t a clue.”
Beverly runs up to them and stops cautiously a few feet away. Peter is usually over the moon for visitors but he’s on the couch, arms wrapped around a Captain America pillow as he watches a science program about outer space.
“How about this? I have Friday put on your favorite movie. I’ll go in the kitchen and make popcorn. The real way on the stove in a pot with some oil. Like your mother used to make. Cold glass bottles of Coca-Cola.”
Tony grunts in response and keeps working on soldering wires.
“Peter! We don’t throw things at each other! Get over here now!”
“Breathe with me,” He says before slowing down his breath. Talking her through the breathing exercise.
“Do you think she’s downstairs?” MJ asks as she heads down the steps and glances into the room.
“You know the answer to that Peter and don’t go waking him up.”
Peter falls silent and his lip starts to tremble. The teasing hurt and it made him feel stupid.
“Sorry.  I know we agreed but he just wasn’t listening.”
“A minute or two.”
“Don’t worry about that. We’re not mad at you. Okay?”
“My parents are long dead. Same with Bucky. And Peggy…Peggy is slowly starting to forget things. She’s not always aware of what age we are or where she’s at. Besides you and Peter what do I have?”
“See? That wasn’t so bad,” Tony says as he runs his hand through her hair trying to get it slightly more presentable.

“Come over here like I asked.”
“Why?”
He gestures towards the closet. “Peter is about to head outside.”
“Dad!” Peter complains, “I don’t want to hear about you two having sex.”
Peter cries and attempts to pull himself out of Steve’s grip. “No! Please! She’s hurting me!”
This author sees and appreciates all comments, but may not reply.
They split up, Tony going back to New York to retrieve Peter and pack their things. Steve going directly to the house in Malibu with Beverly.
“Windex, kid,” Tony says as he pulls the shower head from its holder so he can rinse Peter’s feet  before he stands back up.
“Because Ned offered first?”
The Quinjet lands on Tony’s helicopter pad nearby and he’s surprised when the call comes in from Clint and Natasha. He figured they would already be enroute to the location and he’d be riding with someone else. The two come inside to see Tony and the kids.
The two teenagers whine in the backseat about the radio choice until Steve has enough.
“I’m sorry. Come to bed with me. If that’s what you want of course.”
“I could get hurt walking right now. What’s your point?”
Steve zips up his bag and observes the room. Peter finally squeaks out an apology and Tony lets him go. He wipes the tears off his face and turns to head upstairs. He cries out as Steve grabs him and pulls him up into his arms. Peter reluctantly lets himself be held. “I know you’re mad at me and I’m sorry it has to be like this. I love you son.”
Peter immediately stops crying and sits up. “Can I go?”
This story is part of the
“I almost kept that one for myself,” Steve says softly to him.
“Steve?” Ben pulls him out of his reverie. “You still with us?”
“I know I didn’t mean to yell at you,” Steve says coming back into the room. Beverly decides to tip her bowl over, giggling as she watches the mess.
“I’m sorry. I just can’t,” Steve mumbles to himself before leaving the room. He sits on the couch and continues laughing hysterically. He was no help to Tony or Peter in this state. Peter was fine there was no way Tony could actually hurt him. This was something the two would have to work out on their own. This world with Tony, albeit a confused Tony, was an interesting one.
“Oh,” Peter says softly.
Tony adjusts the way he’s sitting. “You smell. You need a shower.”
“You’re alright. Daddy and I aren’t mad at you. Find a movie to watch while we clean up,” Steve says as he hands him the remote.
“Cool! Daddy forgot to put the turkey in so we had to come here.”
Peter reluctantly gets into the bed and rolls onto his side facing away from his father. Steve pulls the covers up and tucks him in. Peter moves away as Steve tries to kiss him. “Don’t want a kiss,” Peter says as he waves him off. Steve crosses his arms and sighs as he tries to ignore the feelings of hurt and anger surfacing from Peter’s dismissal. He felt anger at Tony for waking Peter up and taking him out of his room. He was supposed to check that he was there and that was it. Steve turns off the light and shuts the door leaving it cracked as he exits the room. “Goodnight,” he says and Peter doesn’t respond.
“Another time,” Tony says with feigned disappointment as he goes to answers the door and the older gentlemen from across the street is standing there in a heavy-duty rain jacket. He has candles and flashlights. “The power will be out for a bit. Thought we’d bring some supplies over.”
Peter runs his hand through his damp hair. He was covered in sweat and exhausted. He wanted to talk to Tony, spend every waking moment with him. But right now he just wanted to shower and collapse into bed. Tony would be there tomorrow. Or not and this was all some strange fever dream.
“Peter, if you get out of time out you will get a spanking, remember?”
Peter rolls his eyes and huffs. “I’m not a baby.”
“Peter?”
Instead Peter had no choice but to stare up at her pale face, her lips blue and her eyes white. White and dead like the fish Steve had caught the last time he took Peter fishing. The eyes scared him and he kept asking why they looked like that. Suddenly the figure pounces down on him like a cat, hitting his stomach hard causing him to gasp. He sits up and screams as loud as he can. The figure dissipates into a black cloud. Peter doesn’t wait to see what happens next he jumps out of his bed, tangling his legs in his sheets and slamming his knees hard into the wood floor. He pulls himself up and runs for his door pulling  it open and racing down the hall to his parents bedroom. He launches himself onto their bed and dives into Tony’s arms. Both his parents are sitting up in bed seconds away from getting up to check on him. He bursts into tears as he buries his face into the crook of his father’s neck.
“Our second date has gone so well.” Tony picked up his phone and ran to the bathroom to take the call. Something business related that he wished he would have ignored and had more time with Steve.
Stay tuned~
“Stop,” Steve commanded.
“Come to me,” he says smoothly. Tony hesitates, but follows the direction given after only a brief moment. Steve wonders what Tony’s true goals are. Direction? Attention? Is he looking for someone to see him in a way he refuses to see himself? Steve wonders how long it's going to take to crack Tony piece by piece until he’s a literal weeping mess on the floor.
“Forget I asked, Steve.” Was the last time Tony had mentioned it, before walking off and never speaking about it again.
Another kick to his ribs.
It started out as innocent curiosity at first. Steve had always loved the look of lingerie. One day, walking inside of the stores after staring down a pair of black silk with lace trim, he, on impulse, bought them as soon as he got a feel of the soft material. The clerk smiled, saying that his girlfriend would be pleasantly surprised, Steve let out a nervous laugh and agreed.
“I wanted a daughter, and I wanted to name her Maria,” He says while picking at the skin on his thumb. He’s pausing in between sentences, grabbing words from thin air and trying to piece them.  Steve just stares. He does that a lot when he’s determining an answer, it never comes.
“I know.”
He could almost feel jagged nails scrape along his scalp softly then grip his hair, because if Tony was up for a challenge Steve would readily give him one. Tony’s torso lifted and his thighs were shaking, sweat slicking against his chest and back causing the once loose-fitting shirt to stick to his now clammy skin. His left hand was stroking fast enough to create consistent smacking sounds because of his hand tightly coiled around his cock hitting his pelvis so rapidly.
“Yes, Master.”
For one thing, Steve didn’t care for anything lavish. The straight laced army veteran in him found solace in other things. It was ironic, really; the same tragedies that Tony was told not to worry about were the living conditions for Steve. Their relationship had always been an interesting one, and Tony’s need to spend to show his appreciation only heightened their obscure ways of displaying affection.
Tony leaned against the wall and looked up at Steve, meeting his clear eyes briefly, then his eyes trailed over the man's nose and lips, followed by the sharp lines of his jaw. Like the paintings he kept tracing the lines of with his eyes over and over again. Steve’s finger traced over his bottom lip gently, one hand at his waist, and Tony’s heart was strumming out of control. The pit of his stomach was a pool of mush and his thoughts made no sense, until Steve finally kissed him.
It’s almost like a standoff, only Steve wonders what Tony's contemplating. He could up and leave, he could attack, he could try and talk his way out of it, probably getting punched in the mouth again for his efforts, but he could damn well try. Yet he’s silent and still.
“Were you serious about publicly humiliating me in front of millions of people plus our teammates?” Steve asked.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I’ve never wanted the typical marriage with children. I—I’ve never known what I’ve wanted outside of being Captain America, so anything emotionally excessive is foreign.” The words are spoken slowly, as if he’d just gotten around to confessing this to himself.
part of him kicked in, Steve once again grabbed his cock. This time firmer than the sweatpants episode. Slowly Tony lifted his head, and was met with the smuggest smirk and most mischievous glint in Steve's eyes.
Tony nodded in agreement, letting a grin grace his lips before slowly pushing himself into Steve. Both of them groaning in unison, a little clink from Tony’s buckle resonated when he began thrusting. One hand on the base of Steve’s cock, stroking in time with thrust after thrust. Tony leaned in closer, making it so the thrusts were short but hard enough for Steve to feel it.
“You still cold?”
Tony cast his eyes over the manicured grass, each blade cut simplistically yet perfectly to match the intricacies of plain yet sought out grandeur the property projected. It’s nothing he hadn’t seen millions of times before. Ever since he was a child as others mucked along the treacherous troubles that was the great depression-Tony had no idea what it even was until overheard on the radio-even then, when asking his father about these events, his father said it was nothing he had to worry about. In some ways he'd been right.
A hand grabs at Tony’s chin. “You are petrified. Look at you—
“You look disappointed, perhaps a thank you is—“ Before Tony could utter another unwelcomed word Steve grabbed the collar of his shirt and pulled him into a hard kiss.
“Ready?” Steve asked.
Tony smiled. “And what a fine morning it is, darling. I’m assuming you had a good rest.”
Tony was so close, so deliciously close and fighting off the shock that shook him to the core. He stopped and turned to face Steve, both of them making eye contact this time and hesitantly, Tony looked down at Steve’s cock. Beautiful, uncut and bigger than expected, the head turning a reddish purple color from the blood flow. He reached over, wanting to taste but restraining himself and just stroking instead.
Steve grips his hair once more. “You are so beautiful.” His hands feel warm on Tony’s cold and clammy skin. “Unbutton my pants and suck my cock.”
Steve would be lying if he said he didn’t love the attention, eyes glued to him as if he’s all Tony wanted right now. He bit his lower lip at the sight of Tony’s legs spread open, inviting, so damn inviting.
things,” Steve teased. Tony gently elbowed him before falling asleep seconds later, his head pillowed on Steve’s chest.
With that they head their separate ways. Steve mulling over his thoughts the entire ride home, wondering how he would ask. If he can still ask. Tony brought it up, and he’s obviously still thinking about it. Steve chews on his bottom lip, contemplating how and when he should bring it up--because not doing it is no longer an option. He can no longer ignore the shroud of darkness that grips him, he needs release. And Tony is going to give it to him.
Steve shuddered, “Afraid of a lonely night without me?”
Steve raises his eyebrow. “No, I’m eating.” His Brooklyn drawl leaves him, and he lifts his legs to cross atop of his desk as he continues eating as if Tony hasn't said a thing.
They’d discussed the few questions Tony had about the rules, all of them having the recurring theme; were they now considered to be in a relationship. Steve told him it didn’t have to be defined now, that technicalities could be worked out further down the line, but it didn’t mean he couldn’t follow the rules. Tony wouldn’t fathom it; the fact that they had a set of rules made him uneasy, yes, but still curious.
“You. I was gonna walk up to you and say ‘Heya partner’ in your accent, and then give you a little show.”
A hand around his cock had him coming, hips jutting up and gasping, tugging at the sheets so hard he thought he’d tear them. Seconds later, he flopped against the sheets, meeting Steve’s eyes and smiling, his eyes glazed over and feeling exhausted yet better than he has in a while.
The officer looked up from his license, his lips twitching at the corners, “That was terrible, Mr. Stark.”
Steve didn’t need to be told twice.
“That’s all you’re worth. You should be grateful I even let you taste my cock.” He pulls Tony by his hair so he’s face to face with Steve’s come. Tony’s tongue darts out to lick his upper lip nervously. He hesitates before licking over the thick black kevlar near his upper thigh. He moves higher up his unbuttoned trousers, sucking on the fabric at his groin to get some of the fluid that's seeped in. His tongue works patterns that let out a strange noise when the texture of the fabric meets Tony’s tongue. Some of the come has landed on his belt buckle, some over his midsection, all of it was lapped up carefully, and with some eagerness behind it. Steve’s glad he’s a man of self restraint because this would drive a lesser man crazy.
Tony took a deep breath, the words were all there. “To the submissive, I say this: A potential Dominant will let you know if She or He is interested in you or not. Keep in mind that your purpose as a submissive is to serve and to satisfy someone who will take into consideration the realisation of your fantasies. Don’t expect your Dominant to be able to turn on like a light switch. The timing must be right for both of you.”
“Must I tell you everything? Besides, it’s not a big deal. I’m just a bit chilly, is all.” He snuggled underneath the blankets, and as he did, so did Steve unravel himself from the sheets, lying back down the opposite direction once more.
Tony brain was still foggy, but he did what he was told, excited for what was to come. Reward rung in his ears and admittedly coddled his pride, but most importantly, Steve was pleased. He was probably grinning like an idiot.
“Oh shut up. Antonio understands, right?”
“Were you starting or agreeing with me?” Tony asked, finally making eye contact.
They weren’t making eye contact right now, both of them staring up at the ceiling as if it would give them answers on how to proceed. Tony decided to sit up. It was most comfortable for him that way, which meant Steve would get a clear view.  To avoid this, he turned on his side, facing the alarm clock, which now read
After coming into Steve’s hand, Tony’s hips lowered, and Steve pulled his fingers out gently. Tony was still trembling, smiling as Steve leaned down for a soft kiss.
He felt dizzy when Steve pulled away. Tony’s lips chased, but the blond only ran a fingertip along his lips and smiled.
Tony closes his eyes in disgust, and As soon as he opens his mouth in the slightest, he can hear Steve’s zipper and the rustling of clothing. He feels the head of Steve’s cock touch his lips, and gently sticks out a tongue to taste.  He’s always wanted this, he thinks, stifling a groan, but not like this. Never like this.
“Take off the suit,” Steve says after dropping the man.
Tony was trying to get a peek at the canvases. He could see flashes of what seemed to be half painted body formations and detailed muscle work, and Tony wanted to see more. As he stood on his toes to look, he nearly stumbled over, causing a loud clack from the heels of his shoes hitting hard wood floor. Turning he looked in Steve’s direction to see him sitting.
Walking out the door and partially feeling as if today he’d made progress. At least to him he did. Listening to a voice outside of the one in his head that always accused him of making mistakes was a enough for now.
He’d gotten to know a lot more about Steve, too. He learned a bit about his military background, and his job as an artist. He was a lover of anything vintage, his music taste that of an old man, but again, Tony liked it. He liked Steve’s grounded nature, his dry wit was a plus, and saying he was easy on the eyes was a huge understatement. It was rare that Tony appreciated the person someone was, but this was one of those rare cases; a start in the right direction. Even if a thought crossed his mind that this one might work out.
“Answer me with a yes sir.”
Steve took slow steps, again, reenacting what Tony did earlier, only adding a slight sway in his hips. Tony took another sip from the glass, and then set it down. Soon, he was in Tony's lap, letting out soft sighs as Tony’s calloused fingers felt along bare skin.
“You should stop pretending like it’s not my fault… all of this is my fault.”
Antonio rested his head onto Anthony’s shoulder. “Nonsense. I’m a fantastic liar, and way too sober to tell you about my
“Do you usually back sass officers?”
“Banana.”
As Steve tried to formulate a response, Tony sipped on his scotch. The grin on his face distorted by the glass being put up to his lips.
“Again, this time I want you to say it like you believe what you’re telling me. We’ll do this until you get it right.”
“So… gonna tuck me in, Rogers?” Tony joked, trying to break what he assumed was an awkward silence.
He could practically hear the smirk in Steve’s voice. “Good.”
Tony sipped his wine. “Soon…” The hell if he knew. It depended on whether or not Steve would be comfortable with, that. It didn’t seem like he wouldn’t be, though. Nonetheless, he still didn’t know if what they were meant the same level of commitment a normal relationship brought, and if Steve didn’t want that… well…
He moaned regardless, and Steve’s mouth quirked.
“Crawl to me.”
Tony raised an eyebrow, “Don’t keep me waiting too long.”
“Finally made time for me? What’s with that? Next thing you know you’ll start getting sleep or something.” Jan shared the same grin.
“You walk pretty well in those heels. If I pay you to walk around in heels and bend over and pick up stuff, would that be considered prostitution?”
Tony shifted his gaze lower to meet the other’s.
Tony laps his tongue around the head, then underneath, and Steve groans rather loudly before pushing Tony’s head back down, huffing when he chokes. He keeps fucking Tony’s mouth until he finally releases, coming hard enough to make his vision blur, giving a full body shudder. His brain is muddled with nothing but the mantra
“Then get undressed, I want to hear the first rule, pet.”
“You should stop blaming yourself.”
Tony moaned and sucked harder, he didn’t care if his throat was sore or that he needed to breathe at some point, he just needed Steve to come down his throat. Tony’s arms were shaking, he was so enthusiastic about Steve getting off that he neglected his own straining erection so firmly tucked into his boxers under confining slacks. A few minutes later, however, Steve gave Tony what he’s been craving ever since he’d seen the glorious outline that was Steve’s magnificent cock. Steve’s hips lifted and he was on his toes, coming down Tony’s throat and then he pulling out. Tony had to swallow all of it, and he’d never felt so used before; it was the most erotic sensation possible.
He briefly wondered when this would happen again, but dismissed the thought as soon as it came. He wanted to live in the now for once. Take in every detail for the jerk off memory banks. Steve’s eyes half lidded, his glare slowly turning glassy as he kept a firm grip on his length. He seemed to use his whole palm to stroke himself, and god did he need it with that huge cock of his. He let out soft grunts and heavy pants, occasionally cursing lowly while he tipped on feet a bit. His free hand held onto some piece of furniture as he worked himself, his grip growing increasingly firmer with each stroke. Tony wanted Steve like this all the time, in him, on top of him-- holding him down, making him fucking scream and pray desperately because he went so far off the deep end. And then Steve came, groans leaving him between harsh breaths, thick ropes of white landing on Tony's rug. Steve tipped forward and his head was tipped back. He finished with a low “fuck,” and Tony imaged it must have felt really good. All of this felt so fucking good.
‘You’ve been hurt…much more than I realized. God, Tony, I wish I’d found you sooner, that I could’ve protected you from all those who-’
‘Wait!’ Tony blurted, meeting Steve’s gaze and slowly lifting his arms above his head, his T-shirt going with it. Now he was bare in all sense of the word, his soul, his vulnerability. He still wore his sweatpants, but he hadn’t ever been shy about nudity, he had a damn fine cock, and he knew it, but this, allowing someone to see his scar, a reminder of the betrayal, was a new experience.
‘Soulmates, the thing you’ve been looking for and won’t admit to yourself. Our soulmates have been affected by the same magic, or science, or whatever it was they gave us,’ Steve said dismissively, like the how wasn’t important.
‘What if…God, Pep, what if he’s it?’ Tony whispered, the word filling up the space of the workshop, crushing him with its meaning. He’d been avoiding the problem, silencing the tiny
He wasn’t going to be beholden to its restrictions.
This was so much harder than Pepper made it out to be, being vulnerable in front of someone you didn’t know that well, someone you wanted to know better, and you just had to pray they felt the same way. He felt exposed, terrified, and his hand came up to cover the scar on his chest, his foot taking a step back.
The science part of Tony’s brain wanted answers, wanted a sample of Steve’s blood to dissect, to prove him wrong, because the whole idea of occult witches in the wilderness being able to create an…elixir of life was ridiculous, and it insulted his rational brain. The other part of his brain, the naïve romantic part that Howard had never been able to crush despite trying, the part Tony desperately tried to ignore, was looking at Steve in wonder.
‘It is, yes,’ Steve answered both questions with an easy smile.
‘Yeah, you got the short straw when you got me,’ Tony mumbled, ignoring Steve’s sigh.
He looked over his shoulder, helpless to the craving want smoldering in his chest, needing to see Tony one last time and know he was happy before he walked away. Tony turned at the exact same moment, and Steve saw the flash of gorgeous brown eyes, a replica of the eyes the first reincarnation of his love had, the same honey-soaked teak which sparkled with curiosity, and Steve knew that later they would burn with determination and creativity, knew deep in the marrow of his bones that this was the person Tony would turn out to be.
Walking through the living room, Tony paused to look upstairs, imagining the weight of his previous self looking down at him. How similar were they? Was he still Tony, or just a faint reflection of those who came before? Were his thoughts his own?
Thank you so much for reading our story!
‘Because love doesn’t mean you hold onto them at any cost. That you entrap them. One didn’t believe me, one was against the idea of soul mates, another met someone else, and I let them all go.’
‘Thank you,’
‘Do you now?’ Steve answered, his polite smile from earlier evolving into something carnal.
Of course he didn’t have a traditional soul mate. He was Tony Stark, he didn’t do normal, but he had found his soulmate and he’d always been protective over his stuff.
A detailed picture of eyes,
he mouthed when he straightened up, like he couldn’t believe what he was seeing, joy sparking in his blue eyes. Emotion clogged the back of Tony’s throat, and he put his sunglasses in his suit pocket awkwardly, unsure how to handle being the focus of such attention.
Finding Steve, he leant against a doorframe watching him for a moment. He’d always been a little suspicious of people who volunteered, his lessons from his dad clashing with what his mom tried to teach him. Howard believed that nothing in life was free, that everyone was looking out for number one. Maria taught him the opposite, but he’d seen too many people at charity events trying to further their own agenda under the pretense of supporting those less fortunate.
Tony could feel the heat in his face as he walked on the sidewalk, people parting around him as he jammed his hands into his pockets, gaze on the ground.
He felt at ease here.
‘Oh, Tony look at you…Just wait there a moment, okay?’ Steve said, patting his shoulder and leaving him beside the door, trusting him not to bolt again. Tony didn’t move from beside the door, feeling the rain drip down his face and off his nose, his fingers feeling the bite of the cold as he flexed them.
‘I know how that looks, how this appears but…’ Steve trailed off, crossing his arms over his chest and looking at his feet. ‘Your eyes, they’re beautiful and I haven’t stopped thinking about them since your penthouse the other day. I…well I wanted to capture them on paper. Sorry, that’s just what artists do I guess.’
Steve felt his hand lift, wanting to reassure Tony, but he let it fall to his side, knowing there was nothing he could do. The kindest thing he could do was walk away from Tony, protecting him from the entangled heartache waiting for him in the future.
‘Steve…please,’ he begged, becoming flustered with how powerless he was against the stronger man. Steve’s biceps were tense with the effort of holding himself aloft, the powerful muscles in his back flexing as Tony dug his nails into his shoulder blades.
‘Sorry,’ was all he could say.
‘In a way, it is you, sort of,’ Steve whispered.
This was approaching territory Tony knew now, Stark Industries had looked into similar things, serums to enhance soldiers, nanorobotics that could be introduced to a human skeletal system.

The End
‘Thank you for your service to our country,’ Tony said.
‘So, you’re an inventor, a creative type.’ Steve didn’t push Tony, steering the conversation away.
Stocks had plummeted since the attempted coup by Obadiah Stane, regardless of Tony being the victim to his attack, the public only saw a company in turmoil, even as Tony recovered in a hospital bed with a stab wound in his chest.
he referred to was.
‘Why didn’t you explain things to them? Why didn’t you keep them with you?’
‘Now that I’ve brought your piece, are you free for the evening?’ Tony turned back to Steve, hoping he was portraying the right amount of interest. There was a fine line between appearing eager and desperate, and Tony felt like he was closer to the latter, wanting to feel this man’s arms around him, only a little bit apprehensive about how intense his feelings were.
‘It…he,’ Tony corrected himself, glancing up at Steve nervously to see what his reaction would be to that. They might be bots but they were important to him, even if he never told them that. ‘DUM-E was the first robot I made, he helps me down in my workshop, well, I say helps,’ Tony grumbled, taking a sip of his wine.
Exhaling loudly, Steve walked over to a chest of drawers in the corner of the room, still giving Tony a wide berth. Rummaging in the draws, he pulled out an intricate wooden box, which he presented to Tony.
Ignoring the issue of the dog tags and the tangled ball of complication that it entailed, Tony reached for the photo book, flipping the pages until he found what he was looking for.
‘Not in the slightest. Like I was trying to say earlier, I have cared about every version of you, tried to do my best to care for you, even from a distance, but you’re different Tony.’
‘The joke’s on her, you don’t have any wires for her to rip out,’ Tony mumbled, rummaging around in the draw for a wine opener.
Steve nodded, looking up. ‘JARVIS?’
‘Yeah? Like what you see soldier?’ Tony teased, his usual filtration coming out.
‘Sorry, my mouth works faster than my brain sometimes and I say things-’
brave,’ Steve whispered.
‘At least let me try and fix it, that’s what you found me for, wasn’t it?’
‘Listen, I know you’ve been hurt, and I’m amazed how strong you are-’
Steve pondered, watching as the pair stopped in front of a picture, the adult bending down on his knee so he could speak at the child’s height, gesturing up at a painting.
‘You said that before, I get the impression you’re a very selfless person,’ Tony muttered.
Instead, he shuffled over to the next painting, trying not to smile as Steve followed him. This piece exuded loneliness, heartache. He couldn’t explain why, no part of him understood the tortured soul in the art piece, the feelings a painter spilled onto his canvas. But Tony could with this. The figure was rendered with agonizing detail, the broad muscles of his back, brown hair curling at his nape, and every mole, every imperfection rendered in beautiful detail. You couldn’t see the subject’s face, but that didn’t matter.
‘Go sit on the couch, Tony, I’ll be there in a minute,’ Steve said curtly, turning his back to Tony, fiddling with the spoon in the other mug.
‘I don’t…fall asleep near people,’ Tony managed to get out after a jaw cracking yawn.
Here he thought
‘In times of war, governments can do desperate things to ensure their victory,’ Steve told him in a monotone voice. ‘Soldiers, we…we’re taught to follow orders without question. We believe in the cause, the greater good. When I fought for my country, I believed I was doing the right thing, fighting for our independence.’
‘As you can see, I know next to nothing about art,’ he gestured up at the piece. ‘I’m here to help the charity auction, and I was looking for something for my friend, which was why I was laughing, not at this piece, this piece is terrifying,’ Tony rambled.
Rocking back and forth on his heels for a moment, he ran his tongue over his teeth before pushing his way into the building and turning on the charm at the first person he saw.
Tony hissed as Steve ran his tongue over the puckered tissue, layering over the memories of the knife plunging into his skin with pleasurable ones, eradicating the fear with pleasure, one of his hands reaching down to grip Tony through his sweats, making him choke on a moan, his eyes clenching shut as he gave himself up to Steve.
and here
Steve moved around Tony cautiously, careful not to touch as he tugged the sheet off, bundling it in his arms and holding it close to his chest. He didn’t obstruct Tony’s path, didn’t try to explain in anyway, he hunched back against the brick of his bedroom wall, trying to appear as small and unthreatening as possible.
‘Tony? What’s wrong?’
‘You could just take it down you know,’ Tony teased, picking up a pen from the desk and clicking it repeatedly as he grinned up at him.
A tentative hand skimmed across his skin where his t-shirt and sweatpants met, and Tony moaned at the electric feel of it, grinding up into Steve’s cock to let him know how
Tony wondered if it was to do with Steve being his soulmate, if his body somehow craved Steve’s like his soul did.
‘But what about…’ Tony gestured at the dog tags, stuck on that one thing.
‘As you’ve just paid my rent for the next few months, it’d be rude of me not to at least offer to buy you a drink or something,’ Steve agreed.
A cold drench of reality shook him from these revelations as Steve’s thumb rubbed against the edge of the puckered scar tissue on his chest. Tony’s body instinctively flinched away, his hips stopping their rutting as he tore his mouth away from Steve’s, his head falling back on the cushion behind him, gazing up at the man who had pinned him in.
‘Pepper,’ he groaned, refusing to look her in the eye.
‘When was the meeting with the UN again, was it this Wednesday? We need to get moving if we’re going to have anything to-’
Steve went still, and Tony could hear the cogs turning in his head.
Alright, that was quite a powerful piece, terrifying too.
‘Alright, let’s try logic then,’ she huffed. ‘You don’t have enough data, you don’t even know if this Steve is your soulmate, you’re acting on a hunch-’
‘I’m not doing this right if you’re still thinking,’ Steve murmured over his lips, scattering whatever Tony had just been thinking about, his mind filled only with Steve.
‘I don’t think so? I mean, I saw you when you first arrived with your friend. I think we might have made eye contact.’ Steve’s voice rumbled, rolling over Tony in a caress. Raising his champagne glass to his mouth, Steve wet his lips with the bubbly liquid, capturing Tony’s attention, wishing he could reach up and kiss the droplets from his bottom lip.
‘My unit was offered what you would now call an experimental drug, I suppose. A way to make us stronger, faster, resilient to injuries so we could win the war.’
‘DUM-E,’ Tony corrected, allowing himself to be led, sitting back on one edge of the black leather couch as Steve took the other side, completely relaxed, waiting for Tony to explain. This…didn’t happen, he might talk to his date for a little bit, but the girls usually perched on the couch, waiting for him to make the move, nervous and skittish until they started making out. Only Rhodey sprawled out on his couch like he owned the place, kicking his feet up on Tony’s expensive mahogany coffee table.
Steve gave him a look then, a gaze so heartachingly tender that it made Tony’s palms sweat from the pounding of his heart.
Turning to look over his shoulder, Tony saw Steve leaning against the doorframe, his broad shoulders nearly filling the whole space.
‘What about the super duper encrypted files?’ Tony pushed.
Taking a gulp of his wine that was probably meant to be savored, Tony reached out to place it on the coffee table, mirroring Steve’s position on the couch.
His hand came up to rest against the back of Steve’s head, not tugging him away, his fingers twining in blonde hair as he brought him closer, wanting the attention, his body burning from how sensitive his skin was becoming.
‘So do the Eternals, but they are forced to live without them, to watch their soulmates die over and over only to be reincarnated again and again.’
‘My best friend, Rhodey, he’s a military man too, guess I’m just drawn to people like that,’ Tony teased, wanting to break Steve from his trance.
‘There you are, I’ve been looking everywhere for you. Sorry, I’m Virginia Potts,’ she offered Steve her hand who took it and pressed a kiss to her knuckles instead of shaking it, making a blush erupt on her cheeks.
‘Yeah, I mean, I’m not sure if you wanted to see me again, but I thought if I showed up I might be able to persuade you out on a date with my good looks alone, get to know you better. I mean that’s what you wanted right?’ He was hiding under his usual bullshit bluster, and he knew Steve knew it too, which made him even more uncomfortable.
Steve waited until the fretful tossing and turning stopped, Tony’s breathing becoming slow and measured once again. Shifting in the bed, Steve looked down at his sleeping soulmate who even unconscious was frowning, mouth moving as if he was still thinking, trying to form sentences. None of the others had done that, and Steve found it adorable.
He held the hand of an adult, not his father, Steve had spent countless years studying the features of a human face, and he could see nothing that suggested a familial link between the two. It was possible the child took after his mother, but Steve could see by the way he held the adult’s hand, the polite detached way in which he answered, that this wasn’t his father.
‘There’s something upstairs I want to show you,’ Steve said when Tony picked up a photo frame with a picture of Steve and another man with startling blue eyes and messy brown hair. Placing the photo down, Tony looked over his shoulder, taking in Steve’s relaxed posture, the offered hand.
‘Sorry, I was thinking about something else,’ Tony said smoothly, turning to look at the person who had spoken to him.
Sensing it, or reading it in his posture, Steve shifted down the couch, keeping his gaze locked with Tony, his stomach resting against Tony’s hips, his head now level with the scar over his heart.
‘Sorry,’ Tony mumbled, his own teeth pressing down on the faint imprint his teeth had left, watching a ruby flush wash across Steve’s cheekbones.

‘If you love someone, you let them go,’ Steve told him, sliding down the wall so he could sit at the foot of it, elbows on his knees as he stared at the space between them. He looked so sad, so dejected that something stirred in Tony’s withered husk of a heart, the need to make his feel better.
okay he was with this. Steve let out his own moan as Tony rubbed himself against him, his hand trailing up Tony’s side, dragging the T-shirt with it, his skin prickling from the sensation as the cooler air met his bare skin.
There. Tony spoke the truth, the thing that had been keeping him up at night, throwing himself into his work.
‘Yeah, you’re literally my polar opposite, I can’t survive without my phone,’ Tony laughed, stretching himself out, his limbs loose from the effects of the wine they’d nearly finished. It was late now, or very early depending on which way you looked at it, and while Tony was used to being awake at haphazard hours, Steve probably needed to go home and sleep.
‘You don’t know that I’m going to call you. You’re really going to walk out that door? Miss out on spending a night with Tony Stark?’
‘Alright, Tony, I’ll take care of the details regarding the purchase of this piece. Let me just go tell Happy you’re ready to-’
‘You’re…You’re,’ the receptionist stuttered, her eyes going wide and her bottom lip trembling.
‘Do I know you?’ Tony blurted, feeling like he’d meet Steve somewhere before.
and also here
It was here that Steve finally looked up, watching Tony as he flipped through the album. He could feel his heart start to pound under the scrutiny, a ringing vibrating in his ears the further he got through the photos, his mouth drying, tongue thick in his mouth. Steve was the common factor, but there were different men, with different background, different ages of props, a sepia wash to the older ones, and then a charcoal drawing of Steve and the man in the canvas before him.
‘Alright, Tony,’ Steve whispered, tugging a blanket out from behind the couch, a fluffy black thing that he drew around Tony’s shoulders, hesitantly draping his arm on the back of the couch behind Tony’s head. They didn’t say anything more for a few minutes, watching the steam from the mugs curl into the air, listening to the pattering against the windows.
‘Yeah,’ Tony forced out, focusing on the heat of Steve’s palm covering the mass of gnarled flesh, the way he felt safe rather than threatened. ‘He died trying to use the tech he stole.’ Tony whimpered as Steve stroked the tips of his fingertips over the groove in his sternum, the tenderness, his own vulnerability mingling with his desire from a few seconds ago, a potent mix that made him feel almost drunk as he gazed up at blue eyes.
‘But Pepper why!’ Tony whined as she dug her nails into the tender skin at the crook of his elbow, warning him as another couple drifted past. They both plastered identical smiles on their faces, and he murmured a pleasant ‘good evening’ like Pepper had made him practice over and over to stamp his sarcasm out.
‘Wait, your soulmate dies over and over, and you have to wait for them to be reborn… and they don’t know who you are?’ That sounded like a form of torture to Tony, a solitary agony.
Still watching Steve, Tony could see that his want to help was genuine. The man wore his heart on his sleeve, which made Tony wonder if he was desperate to find something wrong with him. JARVIS might not have been able to find out information about him when he was younger, but maybe that was a clerical error, or he’d just been a very quiet teen.
He flinched when a towel fell on his head, clothes pressed into his hands.
After fending Happy off, reassuring him that JARVIS could take over as his security for the evening, Tony finally shut the door in his face, sighing and resting his forehead against it for a few moments. He was grateful Happy looked after him as well as he did, he really was, but he could be overbearing at times.
‘Others? Wait there are more of you?’
‘You want to come on me?’ Tony whispered, flicking his tongue against Steve’s lips, darting inside when it opened on a gasp.
Stretching a hand out, he stroked a hand over Tony’s head, kissing his forehead before slipping silently from the bed. He padded over to the window, within ear shot of Tony, able to come back if needed.
Steve’s chest gingerly rested on his, and Tony tried to tug him closer, to have his hips pressing down on him too, but Steve wouldn’t move. Whether that was because he was trying to tease Tony or keep things slow, he wasn’t sure, but he needed more.
‘I don’t know much about you I’d rather hear about you from you, rather than listening to what the rest of the world says,’ Steve said, reaching down to place his glass on the floor, turning so his feet now rested on the couch, his body facing Tony’s.
Happy was going to kill him.
‘Me helping.’
Rewiring circuitry distracted him from external influences, his mind free from the conundrum that had plagued him for the last week or so.
‘Who are you talking to?’ Steve’s voice interrupted.
He flinched at Pepper’s voice.
‘What if I don’t want to?’ Steve whispered, reading his mind.
‘You want me to make you come like this, Tony?’ Steve settled back down, exhaling over the precome on Tony’s cock, his thumb replacing the spot his tongue had been, not breaching his body, just sweeping back and forth as his lips ran up the side of Tony’s cock.
‘I can see it, the way you light up when you talk to JARVIS, the way you just spoke about DUM-E, you’re an inventor, Tony,’ Steve said firmly.
‘You’re right. I’ve given you every opportunity to walk away, and I’ll always respect your choice to walk away if that’s what you want, but you came back,’ Steve said in wonderment.
Fear grew in Tony’s stomach, crushing his organs and making it hard to breathe, his gaze fixed on the words
He looked over as Tony mumbled in sleep, turning over in the sheets. Watching Tony sleep, Steve prayed with every fiber of his being that Tony could do the impossible, that he’d be able to live out his remaining days with Tony, finally committing to his soulmate without the fear of being left behind, alone for years before they met again.
What was he doing here? He’d gone willingly into a stranger’s loft, without anyone. Even JARVIS wouldn’t be able to alert someone fast enough to stop him getting murdered.
‘You’re not the same as them Tony. You have similarities, I’m not going to lie, but it’s your experiences that shape your soul, your decisions and moral compass. They aren’t you, just like you aren’t them,’ Steve’s voice was soft, patient, trying to entice Tony away from his anger.
Pepper steered them over to the bar, bypassing the ice sculptures glinting in the ambient lights overhead, a soft glow rather than the harsh illumination they usually used for this floor.
‘I can’t imagine that. Your soulmate walking away from you. I’m sorry, on behalf of all my other selves.’ He was sorry, he might not remember it, may or may not be the same person born again, Tony really wasn’t sure how it worked, but it hurt, it hurt thinking about Steve being heartbroken.
‘I am, Mr Stark, but a gentleman still has eyes,’ Steve drawled, gently biting the side of Tony’s knee as he slid his hands beneath Tony’s ass, gripping hard and then moaning low under his breath at the give of Tony’s flesh.
‘Krystal? Karen? Oh, she was a handful,’ Tony said with a snort, wiggling his eyebrows.
‘You know…I have a decent bed at home,’ Tony teased moving over to sit on the edge of it, distracted by a huge canvas covered by a sheet, dominating the far side of the wall, obscuring any natural light from a sky light in the sloping roof.
‘Tony, I know you, know behind the bluster and the glam there’s an emotionally scarred individual who wants the ever after. You want the soulmate, the happy ending.’ Rhodey reached out again, flinching when Tony knocked his hand away, shoving back his chair so he could stalk around the office.
‘Why did you call him…it JARVIS?’ Steve asked.
‘They’re my family,’ Tony answered, hearing the anger in his words, the uncertainty.
‘Your self-preservation against the pain is stopping you living. You could have everything you wanted, find the person who gets you, get rid of those lonely feelings you carry around with you, but you’re too scared to try.’ Pepper stroked her fingers through his hair. ‘You’re already living in pain because you’re drowning in your fear. This isn’t going to go away. You’ll always feel like a part of you is missing.’
‘No one ever gives as good a reaction as you do, honey bear. Is this office secure?’
‘Need…to go,’ Tony mumbled, feeling himself stumbling in and out of sleep.
‘The Revolutionary War sort of decades,’ Tony ground out from clenched teeth.
There were times in life where you could just look at an object and know it was treasured, the worn fur of a child’s favorite teddy bear, the imprint on a person’s finger where their wedding ring sat… looking inside the box, Tony could immediately tell these items were precious. Peeling back a brown paper bag, Tony could see letters nestled inside, carefully wrapped with twine, and he placed them carefully on the mattress, before picking up a small photo album.
‘You’ve walked past the shelter, sir,’ JARVIS piped up, directing Tony’s attention to a crumbling brick building, graffiti sprawled across it in different stages of decay.
Steve’s movements were peculiar, almost awkward, like he hadn’t done this in a while, and Tony couldn’t believe that. A gorgeous man like this couldn’t be wanting for a sexual partner. In a way, the inexperience fanned the flames of Tony’s lust higher, the idea that he had this man all to himself, that perhaps he’d been waiting for Tony, and suddenly he needed to get closer.
Steve leant forward on his bench, the wood creaking as he craned his neck up, trying to capture a glimpse between the crowds of people. He’d seen him from all different walks of life, successful, downtrodden with a chip on his shoulder about the world he lived in, someone who embraced life.
‘Steve…I mean…Mr Rogers he’s…he’s helping out down at the homeless shelter this afternoon. Shall I call him for you, or you can wait and I’ll go get him…I mean…’ the receptionist floundered, flustered.
Tony puffed out a laugh into her skin. ‘I’m Tony Stark, I’m not scared of anything.’
He once again wondered why they hadn’t dated. She was beautiful, intelligent, would probably be better at running Stark Industries, and she knew him, understood all his quirks and the like. There lay the problem. She knew him too well, if that were such a thing, she and Rhodey both. They were family, the few people he could say he loved unconditionally. He wasn’t going to jeopardize that with either of them.
He could hear her heels clacking after him, and he went around one of the tables, trying to put space between them, knowing if she caught him he was going to crack, break under all the pressure. This wasn’t him, he was Tony Stark, philanderer of both sexes, only indulging in casual intimacy to keep himself safe. He didn’t pine over lost chances, didn’t smell his couch cushions just to inhale the faint scent of Steve’s cologne.
‘I am Mr Stark’s AI system.’
indeed,’ Pepper scoffed, throwing the words his father had always used back at him. She sat him down on the edge of one of his workbenches, bending a little so she could look him in the eye.
‘I like the colors, Jarvis,’ the child spoke, tilting his head to the side as he gazed up at the piece.
‘Well, Rogers, nice to know you won’t stop me from running out of your life, kind of breaking the whole image I have of you being a romantic.’
‘Dummy?’ Steve asked with a smile, gesturing with his free hand back into the living room.
‘Getting a little possessive there?’ Tony tried to tease. ‘I thought we were taking things slow.’
‘You’re wondering why I’m taking this slow.’ Steve propped his elbow on the couch so he could rest his head in his hand, turning to look at Tony, his free hand cupping the side of his face.
No one had ever asked that before.
and also
‘Pick something you like, it’s going to end up on your walls after all! No! Pick something for Rhodey! he said his office needed sprucing up!’
‘Tony!’
‘Sir likes to play with words, I am called Just A Rather Very Intelligent System, or JARVIS as an acronym,’ JARVIS answered.
This didn’t feel like anything like that, this felt stronger, an ache that burrowed deep and hooked its claws into the delicate flesh of his organs, tugging with every heartbeat.
‘Tony, what your parents had…that wasn’t right. Soulmates…it’s meant to be a wonderful, beautiful bond-’
‘For being distrusting…I was betrayed as you know, by someone I cared about, someone I thought cared about me…talking about it doesn’t really capture the pain I felt, not just from the knife.’ Tony refused to say anything else, placing the sketchbook down.
Tony peeked at Steve from the corner of his eye, the way royal blue sweatpants clung to his firm thighs, a matching tank top showing the tips of his pectorals, a few thin white scars marring the skin of his arms.
, Pepper mouthed, shooing him again.
‘I haven’t got anything to prepare you with, baby, I need to go upstairs-’
‘What do you do, Tony?’ Steve asked suddenly, interrupting Tony’s daydream about those muscular arms wrapped around him, the firmness of the thighs he could see straining the suit pants.
In all honesty, Tony had expected a night of great sex, but this was good too. Steve was easy to talk to, felt comfortable to be around. He might not know the reason behind it, but it had been a long time since he’d hung out with someone who wasn’t Pepper or Rhodey. He found himself relaxing, laughing as they talked.
Tony’s thoughts fragmented on the floor, impossible for him to pick up and make sense of.  How could Steve bear that? That must have been why he approached Tony in the first place. He needed help and he hadn’t known how to ask.
‘Tony,’ Steve choked out, leaning forward so they could kiss, filthy and uncoordinated, Steve gasping into his mouth the closer he got to orgasm.
‘I’ll leave that up to you, Tony,’ Steve told him, reaching down to kiss him goodbye, which Tony accepted, his treacherous body craving it.
‘Nothing much to report I’m afraid. I was born in New York, lived here for most of my life and I’ve been a soldier for a lot of it too.’
‘Apparently, they’re not.’ Tony bit down on his lip, refusing to think of how he’d rushed out of Steve’s apartment a few days ago. Steve hadn’t stopped him, just as he promised, hadn’t even moved in regard to Tony’s reaction.
‘Happened six times so far, and in only one of those reincarnations did we stay together to the end of their natural life. The others, it was too much for them, we came together for a brief moment, drawn together as soulmates are and then…I let them go again.’ Steve’s fingers twitched in the air, like he was imagining the loss all over again.
understood. ‘You must have seen the news, the attack that landed me in hospital. Stane, he, well he was my business partner and before that, he was the interim CEO of Stark Industries, until I was old enough to take over…my father left me a weapons business when all I wanted to do was invent, and I fell into the family business. Didn’t question it, until Stane tried to murder me for wanting to stop it…wanting to stop selling weapons under the table.’
‘Tony, he’s right there in front of you-’
Lonely at the top. That saying really underplayed the feelings that came with it. The loneliness was a crippling thing that crept up on him at night, invaded his dreams, his waking hours. It drove him into the arms of countless people, their attention a quick flash of light in the darkness of his soul. There were other motes of brightness, Rhodey and Pepper, his platonic soul mates, the ones who understood him, who truly got him. They understood his late night inventing binges were the inevitable chase of him trying to avoid his demons, that the girls were just a band aid on a tortured soul.
‘No!’ Tony gasped out, delirious with desire, terrified that Steve wouldn’t come back, that he was leaving.
‘Super soldiers?’
Tony needed information, he needed data. Emotions were tangled, snarled things and he didn’t even know where to begin in sorting out how he felt about all of this.
‘Your place, it’s nice, even with the mess,’ Tony teased, meaning it. It was nowhere near as big as his penthouse, but that place was insane, more for show than comfort, Steve’s place felt lived in, homely, little pieces of the man littered about. The décor was a gentle chromatic palette, drenched in sunlight courtesy of the huge windows, which the plants in shelves next to the window no doubt loved.
‘Great, more romantic nonsense. You’re as bad as Steve.’
Looking no older than he did now.
Tony walked around, avoiding the kitchen area as Steve moved to block it, humiliated by the mess. He stifled a laugh at all the coffee mugs stacked up beside the sink, the plates with an empty pizza box balancing on them. He continued walking around the small living area, picking up random brushes and pencils as he went.
‘What am I thinking now?’ Tony challenged, sliding across the couch to press their thighs together, plucking Steve’s glass from his hand and placing it on the floor.
He scanned the guests around him, meeting Happy’s gaze from where he stood in his security outfit at the entrance to the floor. Happy was watching him like a hawk, determined not to let anything compromise his life again, still not forgiving himself for what had happened with Stane. Tony could feel a prickle over his skin as he broke eye contact with Happy. He was used to being watched throughout his life, the paparazzi hounded him, and he was used to donning his media face, the cocky expression they expected to see him with.
He met Steve for another kiss, his head becoming foggy with the sensation, everything shutting down apart from the singular burning purpose of wanting Steve and wanting him now, of wanting to be swamped by him, drowning in the sensations. It should have scared him, the loss of his self like this, but he knew, in the core of his being that he could trust Steve, that he could let go and just be Tony with him.
‘As in….you saw me in the papers and what? Reimagined me from a few centuries ago?’
‘One hour Tony, go and be polite for one hour and then meet me back here. I’ll made a bid for something on your behalf,’ Pepper shooed him away with her hand.
‘Hmm,’ Pepper made a noise, still holding him close.
Kisses melted from one into another, leaving them both breathless and panting, Tony’s body warming from both the kisses and Steve’s proximity. Steve pulled away with a gasp, darkened blue eyes gazing down at him in wonderment, making Tony squirm under the scrutiny. Usually, he lived for the spotlight, craved the attention, but there was something different about Steve. He could see through all the bluster, saw Tony for who he really was, and it left him feeling vulnerable, something he hadn’t felt since Stane.
‘But?’ Steve prompted gently, gaze on where Tony’s hand was covering his chest.
‘Would that really be such a bad thing?’ Pepper asked, not needing Tony to elaborate, knowing what the
Steve understood the concept behind abstract art, the use of vibrant colors and broad strokes bringing out the life and spirit of the theme the artist held in their heart, rather than trying to constrain it to one form. That didn’t mean he understood it either, but he could understand why this piece might appeal to a child, the garish splats looking like oil on water.
‘You pick one,’ he muttered petulantly.
‘Baby,’ Steve breathed, moaning and pressing forward when Tony reached down and took over, feeling the length and girth of Steve in his hand, glad they hadn’t had sex yet. He would need a lot of preparation to take him.
‘Tony?’ Steve gasped out, his hair unstyled and flopping over his forehead, fingers smudged with what looked like charcoal. ‘What are you…what’s wrong, are you hurt-’
He was hiding something.
It had been just over a year since they’d been reunited as adults, a year since Tony had come back to him in the rain that night. Steve looked down at New York beneath Tony’s penthouse window, wondering how much longer he’d have to watch the world around him change, endure the torture of knowing he’d lose the ones he cared about over and over.
‘And he’s your…’
‘Immortals, Tony, we don’t die,’ Steve said with a smile as if the whole concept was funny.
Pepper was right, she always was, and he honestly didn’t know if Steve was his soulmate, or just a handsome guy he had the stirrings of interest for. It wasn’t as if Tony had ever felt romantic feelings for another person before, he could be confusing the two.
Tony inhaled deeply, taking comfort from her perfume, the smell of the Stark Industries office, everything that made Pepper, Pepper. She was a guiding light in his life, his compass, she wouldn’t steer him wrong. He could be honest around her.
Tony looked up from where he’d pried open the lid.
‘And I feel for the dude I do, but Tones, that isn’t up to you to fix. You have one life. Live it the way you want to.’
‘Breathe, honey, it’s me, you’re safe with me,’ Steve promised, moving his hand away.
‘Holy fuck.’ Rhodey let go of him and slumped back, hands loose on his lap. ‘Are you sure?’
‘Tony?’
‘Is he still alive?’ Steve growled, and suddenly Tony could see the soldier in him, the being that had been in God knows how many wars, who had lost friends, had killed to save his country.
‘If you love someone you let them go,’ Steve quoted, resting his hand on top of Tony’s, printing his fingertips in charcoal smudges on Tony’s skin.
‘You came back, Tony, that makes you mine,’ Steve responded.
Tony read the stenciled words on the window of Steve’s gallery for the tenth time, wondering why Steve had picked that quote. JARVIS had told him it was something Vincent van Gogh had said, and Tony contemplated the meaning as he stood on the sidewalk.
‘Sir, I cannot find anything alluding to what Mr Rogers spoke to you about,’ JARVIS interrupted.
eyes if he wasn’t mistaken.
‘Found who? Tony, what’s going on?’ Rhodey reached down to place his free hand on Tony’s shoulder, his grip firm.
‘Hey, it’s okay, you’re alright,’ Steve reassured him before taking away his hand, giving Tony his space.
The name pierced his chest, spreading out like spiderwebs to entangle in his lungs and heart, infusing every breath, every heartbeat with the name. Steve breathed deep, feeling at peace for the first time in decades. He moved away from the pair, pretending to look at other art pieces before being drawn back to his own canvas as always, the essence of his first love captured by the strokes of his brush, the closest thing to immortal his love could be.
Besides, Pepper was adamant about holding out for her soulmate. She was, at her core, a romantic at heart, and ate the propaganda straight from society’s palm. Tony had seen what pain awaited soul mates, had learnt of its lessons straight from his mother’s lap.
printed on the brass, an eagle beside it.
He could only hold on and gasp against the exquisite feeling as Steve’s tongue jabbed inside him with delicate flicks, alternating between that and broad strokes of his tongue across his hole, teasing him.
‘But he’s been waiting for years, has watched his soulmate walk away from him over and over.’ For some reason, that was what Tony kept picturing, the fragile hope Steve must have carried in his chest, year after year only for it to wither and crumble into dust.
‘Because you’re the seventh reincarnation of my soulmate.’
‘Come with me back to my lab. I can take a sample of your blood and analyze it. There must be a way to fix whatever is happening to you. Modern medicine, science has come on so far since…well, whenever you were born. Hell Steve, I’m an innovator in the world of science, if me and my company can’t fix it, then I can put you in touch with others-’
‘I don’t…I don’t know how to explain it, any of this…I hate this whole thing. This is why I don’t do relationships. I don’t like how they clog my brain, my thoughts.’
‘You know, you create distance between yourself and others. You can’t understand people if you only throw money at the problems.’
‘No, it’s because you’re scared of commitment, of getting hurt again,’ Pepper corrected, bringing her arms around his waist and holding him.
‘I swear to God, Tony!’ she almost exploded, reigning it in at the last moment, reaching up to pry his hand away from his chest. Her eyes softened as she linked their fingers together, gaze on the scar over his heart, hidden by layers of expensive suit.
‘What do you see?’ Steve asked, and Tony could hear the curiosity threaded through the words.
‘A serum,’ Tony croaked out.
‘Anyway, that’s enough about me, who are you, Steve Rogers?’ Tony turned the tables, genuine curiosity in his voice now. Who was this man who made secrets tumble from his lips like this?
‘Being soulmates with my dad destroyed my mom, Pep, what if he does the same to me?’
He’d never seen him as a child before.
Unable to sit any longer, Steve got to his feet, blending into the crowd as he inched his way closer, knowing he shouldn’t influence any part of the child’s life, but desperate for any scrap of information about him.
‘Trust me, it wasn’t a compliment.’ Tony held Steve still as he tried to pull away. ‘Have you ever considered that you can be so self-sacrificing that you become self-centered? You’re acting in what you think are my best interests because you’re sacrificing yourself for the cause, for what you believe to be my greater good. You haven’t asked me what I wanted.’
‘But…’ Tony let the album fall to the bed, rooting through the box, movie stubs from before he was born, metal dog tags from when Steve was a soldier, a belt buckle with wonky letters spelling out Steve, another set of military tags with the words,
‘Why? Got some top secret stuff you need to discuss in my very public office?’ Rhodey chuckled, looking over his shoulder when Tony didn’t quip back. ‘Tony? Everything-’
Shoving all those conflicting feelings down inside his head, Tony decided he was going to find Rhodey’s new office art piece himself. Walking amongst the paintings, he found he actually liked some of the pieces, but none of them were awful enough for Rhodey. He needed a nude piece, that would be perfect. Tony cackled as he imagined Rhodey’s face after he’d turned up at his military office with it No, he would stick it on the wall first, why give him the opportunity to reject it?
‘Good morning! Say, I don’t suppose you know where I could find a Mr Steve Rogers could you?’
had issues with loneliness.
Steve wriggled Tony’s sweats down, nosing along his hipbone, his breath heated against the downy hair covering his lower stomach.
up the others, that’s what you’re good at, remember?’ Pepper relented. ‘No girls tonight please. The last one I kicked out of the house in Malibu the other morning was vicious.’
‘Don’t worry about it, I’m staying in the New York penthouse tonight, that makes it much easier for you to chase them out in the morning.’ He ducked as she swiped at his head, trying to hide her laugh.
‘Fine I’ll pick a piece, but you go
Shaken from his internal thoughts, Tony looked up at the painting he was stood beside, black tendrils reaching out from what looked like a screen, or a phone, dragging the human in the foreground backwards into its depths, other tortured souls caught in its netting.
‘If you’re wrong and he isn’t it, then no big deal. If this soldier
‘Jarvis was my butler when I was a child, he was more a father to me than my own and…I wanted to honor him in some way. JARVIS is my greatest achievement-’
When a lull in the conversation happened, Tony made his excuses with a charming smile and headed back to the bar, discreetly trying to check his watch as he went. Flagging down the bartender he ordered a scotch, turning so his back rested against the counter, making himself seem approachable and not hiding hunched over at the bar like he really didn’t want to be there.
‘Yeah, I guess you are,’ Steve said, his voice hollow. ‘Anyway, that’s me. I used to be a soldier and I guess… I wanted to do something else for a while, I wanted to create things rather than…’ Steve trailed off.
‘Heartbreak,’ he said without thinking, focused on the person in the picture.
‘No! This sucks! I thought finding your soulmate was meant to be the big happy ending, the ride off into the sunset sort of deal, and instead I find out that…that…’ The chattering of his teeth prevented him from saying anything else, and he finally allowed Steve to pull him into the apartment, peeling off his sodden jacket as he went.
‘Unfortunately, money makes the world go around. Me giving money to these guys means it could help more homeless people, expand to other shelters, get more food. That’s going to be more use than me helping and creating a PA nightmare for them all,’ Tony snapped, storming out.
Steve wouldn’t let him rush the kiss, held him still with one of his massive hands, but Tony didn’t feel threatened, or put off by it, meeting the slick, warm tongue with an enthusiastic moan, shifting onto Steve’s lap and twisting his fingers into blond hair, aching to get closer. When they broke away for air, Steve held him close with both hands, dropping his forehead down to Tony’s as they both panted for breath, their created air mingling together.
‘Hey, hey, come back to me, honey,’ Steve whispered, stretching down to kiss his cheekbone. ‘I see you, Tony Stark, someone who is nervous, but willing to try, even after he’s been hurt. Someone I can see myself falling in love with.’
‘Everyone finds their soulmate eventually,’ Tony told him. It was the inevitable truth. They all found the one they were destined to be with, and Tony would fight against his inevitable fate for as long as he could. He didn’t need someone else to be complete, loneliness be damned. Tony wasn’t going to end up like his mom, wasn’t going to be betrayed again, watching as someone he considered his father tried to carve his heart from his chest.
‘Jesus, Tony,’ Steve gasped, his body twitching in a repressed shudder, regaining control of himself. Tony didn’t want that, didn’t want Steve to hold himself back in some misguided attempt to not pressure him into anything. He could feel himself practically vibrating from the assault to his ears, the warm kisses pressed to the tender skin at his throat, the hint of teeth that made him groan and buck his hips up into nothing, desperate for friction.
‘Mr Rogers!’ Tony placed a hand over his chest, ignoring the way his body shifted the slightest bit up into Steve’s hold, the grin on his face that revealed it hadn’t gone unnoticed. ‘I thought you to be a gentleman!’
‘Good, saves me from ripping him apart,’ Steve spat. ‘I almost lost you before I found you. I’m not losing you again,’ he swore, the breath of his promise rippling across Tony’s skin, saturating it with his pledge.
‘God, Tony, you’re fucking beautiful,’ Steve mumbled against his lips, his blue eyes shining as he gazed down at Tony, fingers trembling as he cradled his head.
‘You’re safe here, Tony, I’m here. I won’t let anything hurt you,’ Steve promised. Tony felt a weight on his chest, a hand covering his scar. Instead of flinching away from it, he managed to muster the strength to bring his own hand up and flop it on top of Steve’s, nestling closer with his head before allowing himself to sleep.
That he could fall in love with this man.
Steve caught his gaze as soon as he thought it, like he could hear Tony’s thoughts.
‘JARVIS, can you clear my schedule for tomorrow?’ Tony asked as he walked into the kitchen, looking for a bottle of wine.
‘No past self of you has ever understood my pain, or apologized for it. That’s a unique Tony Stark thing.’
‘You manipulated the words to spell out Jarvis. Who was he originally?’ Steve asked again.
Steve sat up on his knees, taking his weight from Tony, allowing him to gaze down and see his body in its entirety. His gaze lingered on Tony’s scar, a flash of something dark and possessive smearing across his face for a moment before it cleared, his expression raw as he gazed into Tony’s eyes. Carefully, so Tony could see what he was doing, Steve stretched his hand out, cupping the side of his throat.
That more than anything else made Tony place his hand in Steve’s, knowing he could trust him.
Jarvis called him, his gaze down at the watch on his wrist, unease evident in his posture. They were late for something, and this made him anxious. Tony didn’t move at first, his shoulders lifting to his ears, hiding from the inevitable. Whoever it was summoning them, neither of them wanted to go.
‘I did what you said, Pepper. I talked to people, I put in a bid for a few pieces, and now I want this,’ Tony gestured up at the painting while maintaining eye contact with Steve.
‘Wait, what?’ Tony scrambled up into sitting on his knees, watching as Steve got up and reached for his jacket.
