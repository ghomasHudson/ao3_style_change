He smiles down at him, now, still poised with his tongue out, hands behind his back and legs spread. "I'm going to feed you," Steve says "okay?"
“What? No! I meant – paparazzi, you know. Photographers,” Tony clarifies, “journalists, people who make money off that kinda thing. Maybe one of the guests had a bet, Jesus.”
“Mmm?” Tony presses, drowsily. They’re tangled again. Steve curled against his chest, their legs entwined, no saying where one starts and the other begins.
Tony scrubs his eyes with one hand, swings his feet out of bed. “Okay,” he breathes. “Okay. Natasha is downstairs, right?”
“Come to bed,” Steve says again, and his hands wrap around his waist. It’s safe. It’s more safe than Tony has ever felt. He hates it. “I want to see your face when I wake up,” he whispers, kissing along Tony’s throat.
Tony sits up, and he’s vaguely aware of her crossing the room, the bedroom, this is the same one he woke up in weeks ago, at the start of this, when Steve was still alive—
He had woken up late, wearing last night’s clothes, except now they are clean. He vaguely remembers embarrassing himself, throwing up bile in the hallway of the hotel. He doesn’t think too hard about who changed them, and why, and he doesn’t think about Pierce’s fucking friendly eyes, kind, and the absolute myriad of ways he humiliated himself last night.
He had wanted something from Steve, in that moment. Some kind of balm, a self-soothe, even though after he had spat in his face. In that tight, brief moment, his hands on Tony’s back, frail, there had been no animosity. Like friends. Like –
Just so I know if the things I'm writing are coming across the way I want them to -- what do people think is in Tony's file that he's trying to keep secret?
And then Sarah is just staring at him with a look of mingled shock and horror. “You were – when you say lovers – “
And he’d be free, in a sense. Not just to fuck who he wants, or do what he wants – he’d be free of the stitching that binds him here, keeps him in place. If he let go it in his heart, it would break him, but he’d never have to worry. Not about what Steve thinks of him, his hair, his clothes, but also about
“Thoughts, voices, they tell me not to trust you. Me, I, I tell myself not to trust you. I can’t stop it. It’s driving me insane.”
The room Diana has led him to is deep below the compound. As of this day, Tony still doesn’t know exactly where they are. All he knows it that above him is are the chambers that make up the council and that, down here, hundreds of stone steps under, are the rooms Diana takes her people to be tortured.
It’s Bucky’s idea, actually. Bucky mentions it because he’d always wanted a dog, but was allergic. Steve remembers this well from when they were kids; allergic was probably putting it mildly. Bucky could cough himself into a vomiting fit if around loose hair for too long, and although he loved dogs (still does), it was just never feasible. The same way that despite everything the serum’s done for Steve, he can’t seem to shake hayfever, Bucky never got over his old allergy, and so had to decline the donation of a new puppy that the veterens society had tried to donate.
One foot in front of the other. The door, he sees, isn’t even closed – it’s been left slightly ajar, a soft warm light burring through the crack. Listlessly, Tony rests his head against the concrete wall, all cool and still; he listens to the sounds from beyond it.
“You’d like that,” Steve tells him roughly, fucking back in, scratching the back of his head and sighing, biting his lip. “Yeah you would. Be fucked and knotted on the floor like a dirty slut, taking it outside of heat, show you who’s boss. You’d like that, wouldn’t you Stark?”
Pierce can barely hold in his snicker of laughter. The solider is pressed against Tony’s back. His hands, strangely, are resting on Tony’s shoulders. Gentle.
He waits for Steve’s excuse. To his surprise, he acquiesces easily. “Okay,” he says, tucking his arms around Tony’s shoulders, sighing into his throat. “Just tonight,” he agrees.
“Hmm,” Tony had hummed, gently pushing Steve’s hair back from his brow. “Until the day I die,” he sang.
family, the ones who were there for him, always. There’s a photo here of Rhodey and Tony, arms around each other’s shoulders, thumbs up grinning in front of a – DUM-E. It’s DUM-E, Steve realises, and he laughs, bows his head.
“Oh,” Tony mumbles. He rubs a spot above his left eyebrow with his shirt sleeve clenched in his fist. “She never mentioned…”
There are footsteps on the stairs, soft, socked feet. “It’s Captain America,” Morgan says, “hi, Captain America.”
“I don’t know. You were one of the first omegas I’d spoken to since – before. And you were reassuring, I think, in your own weird way. You didn’t listen to instructions, and I liked that, even when it made me mad. You’re like the others,” he seems to realise, “at camp, at parties. You know what you want, and how to get it, and you’re not – docile. Bred to be docile, I mean.”
“We’ve lost men,” she tells him, bluntly. “Not Cap’s fault – no one’s blaming him. What was he supposed to do, let them tear those poor things apart?”
“Don’t do that.” Steve says gently. “Not with your bare hands, Tony – Tony! Look at what you’ve done. Stop that, stop.” Steve pulls Tony’s hands away from the ground, stands, drags him with him. “You’re bleeding.” He states.
Steve is not reachable. When he looks up, nostrils flared, eyes red, shoulders taut like a bull prepping to strike. Tony thinks – he doesn’t see me. Or he does, but he doesn’t – know me.
Steve thrusts up, but it’s Tony who get the pleasure. Like this, cock trapped between their stomachs, the new position pushing Steve against his prostate again and again, Tony can ride him till – till –
“I’m fine,” he wheezes, turns to smile at him, eyes watery. “If you want me, I’ll be in bed.” He feels his head go hazy. “I can be,” he tries again, avoiding his reflection in the mirror, “I can be… so good, for you. Steve.”
The soldier rips through the bindings with his knife. Immediately, Tony sucks in deep breaths, hands shaking, but finally,
“There were thirteen on Tony, when I last counted,” Steve tells him. “I know for a fact it was more originally, but I can’t prove it, so you’re going to get lucky.” The rain is making it hard to keep his cigarette alight. “By the way – he doesn’t have scars, anymore. So don’t go thinking you left a mark. You didn’t.”
I feel I should put a word in for your father. He has not got long left. If you're reading this, and he is still alive, then please, take you chance while you still can. Talk to him. Try to understand him. You only have one father, Tony. While I am damaged, and most likely incapable of love, your father does love you. More than anything, I think. And he's broken, too, he doesn't know how to show it. I forget, we all forget, he was a war man. He saw things. And years of building weapons hardens you. Although he's not a sentimental man, I can know he wants the best for you.
He hears Steve voice, short, sharp. “Well now,” he says, “this is the way the alpha do business, Captain.”
Tony nods, eyes fixed on Steve length. His tongue flicks out of the gag although Steve's doesn't know if he's aware he's doing it. "Soft and slow, okay? No rush." Steve slides both hands through Tony's hair, guides him carefully to his cock. He lines up the hole in the gag with the head, gently lowering Tony down until Steve is sheathed in the warmth. He moans, and fights the urge to thrust. "That's," he breathes "that's good. How's the air? You comfy?"
floating; it’s easy, then, to let Steve take over, fuck him through the aftershocks, use him to chase his own completion. As far as Tony’s concerned, he’s won: he came, despite Steve’s best attempts to the contrary.
“Are you panicking? Should I have not called? Tony this is really hard for me, it’s been years, and I don’t know what’s going on with you — “
“No,” Tony blurts “yes, sorry. Yeah, thinking. Uh,” he throws the device in the air, catches it deftly. “There. Fixed it. Keyed to my biosignature, sorry. What was that about someone chasing you?”
Steve sits him at the island table, sets a glass of water in front of him, and makes some calls. He can hear his voice, measured, calm. “… three. Yes, three. Is that bad? No, I think he just misjudged. The pain was worse this morning. He’s fine, totally fine, he just mentioned – okay. I’ll do that, then. I’ll make sure. Thank you, thanks.”
I KNOW it's a shitty filler chapter and it's really short but i had to just get this stuff out the way. Obviously, next chapter will be all the action stuff, so maybe four more chapters? Idk, my plans usually change.
“So I returned those children to their cells. They must have died a few days later. And Mother turned me.”
The snow eases up for the drive. Sarah is mostly silent on the way to New York, but she puts on the radio, lets mellow Christmas songs play through the speakers.
Tony. They weren’t supposed to go so far,” Pierce admits, “I don’t think he wanted you to be damaged like that, but things got out of hand. Look at you,” he murmurs, “you don’t understand, do you? We had
Tony doesn’t know what makes him say: “Oh, don’t worry. I’d go to his room, you’d still have the bed.”
Steve limps forward on his knees, shuffles, whimpering. Tony brushes his hair back from his face, blows cool air on his sweat-soaked brow. “Back,” he shows him easing him onto the floor. He’s drawn tightly, so tightly that he won’t let his legs lie flat, the muscles corded and thick. His cock is hard, red and purpling, swollen. It’s going to hurt him, Tony know. This isn’t going to feel good.
“So,” Steve announced. “We’ve been doing this all backward.” He bit his cheek to keep from laughing when Tony jumped about half a foot in the air and whirled to face him, waving his spatula with one hand in mock threat.
Bucky sighed and took a sip from his mug, staring deeply at the contents, as if they had all the solutions. “My best friend Steve, he’s in the army. And, uh, he had a black-ops mission, which means--”
Steve scooped the omega and placed him in the bath that was already full thanks to JARVIS. He deposited his cargo gently into the warm water and climbed in himself, snorting as Tony listed against him, jello in the hot spray. “Tired, baby?”
except for when he was sick and the fever made him emotional. “Has something happened?” Steve twisted awkwardly to face him, cursing his big body and their little couch as the springs creaked dangerously. “Tony, honey, talk to me."
Steve snorted and shot him a glance from the driver’s seat. “How is this my fault? You’re the one who agreed to go with me to ComicCon.”
"‘M bad," he croaks out, hands twitching uselessly. "They said that I'm, I don't, ‘m bad?" he asks helplessly, instinctively curling closer to the omega's warmth.
Tony goes to parties like this every week. This is commonplace; something Tony will grouch and complain over but end up inevitably going under threat of death via Pepper’s heels.  Steve had kissed him goodbye laughter in his voice as he wished him luck, Tony pouting his voice belaying his amusement.
“I’m telling Ms. Romonoff you said that,” MJ said flatly from the other desk, not looking up from her book.
Steve heard Tony’s soft hitching breaths before he saw Tony’s slender form, and walked over the gravel to stand beside Tony. “I thought you might be here,” he said, voice low and scraping across the gravel they stood on.
He reeled Tony in by the nape of his neck, stretching them over the sofa so he could explore his omega’s mouth and the way he panted so sweetly against his lips, mewling and pressing into his body. “More,” Tony moaned, curling closer and closer until Steve tugged him down so they were laying on top of each other on the cramped couch.
Steve chuckled, chest rumbling as he leaned down to scent the omega with a soft growl. “You came so hard you passed out, genius. I think I’m allowed to be this smug.”
Tony smiled at him, seemingly mollified. “You weren’t, thank you. I haven’t been getting much sleep lately, what with work and this little troublemaker,” he ruffled Peter's hair and pressed a kiss to the boy’s cheek, and Steve melted. “So thank you for that.”
“Darlin’” Steve’s voice was raspy when he finally pulled away so Tony could breathe. Tony, on that hand, was panting hard, cheeks blotchy and lips bruised and smiling so wide that Steve felt like he couldn’t breathe, extended lung capacity be damned. “Goddamn, I’ve gotta be the luckiest alpha in the world.”
Tony beamed and drew Steve down into his arms. “Okay,” he said, kissing the tip of Steve’s nose. “Bored though. Bot much to do on bed rest.”his challenge.
“Do you use a belt or a paddle?” the question came out of nowhere. What on--Steve washed cold when he realized what Tony was referring to. “Or your hand?” Tony turned and gave him an empty look. “Can I ask you a question, sir?”
Steve felt his heart break all over again as Tony shivered. “Yeah, Tony,” he whispers. “So good for your Captain.”
Tony grinned and flushed, Steve stealing a look towards Natasha and watching her narrow her eyes at Tony. He smiled and didn’t say anything when she turned her suspicious eyes on him. He knew that was her look when she claimed people and took them under her wing. “Just him?” she asked.
"Please don't," he begs, his voice sounding far away to his own ears. "What do you--" realization dawns on him and he tries to turn himself over, to make it easier where it won't hurt his back so much. "Be quick please?" he dares to look behind him, where the alpha is staring with a hand over her mouth. "Don’t make it-Don't make it hurt. Please?" he tries again.
Steve stares at him in awe. His sweet thing—not his, he wouldn’t be his until Tony knew he was his own first—was so giving, so kind. “Can I kiss you?” Steve barely recognized his own voice as rough and low as it went. “Please? You can say no of course but, please?”
Steve softened and tugged Tony close and shut his eyes, taking a deep whiff of the chocolate and smoke. “Would it really be living without you?”
“You mean Tony?” he asked, spinning around in his comfortable chair and wiping his charcoal-smudged hands down on his smock. “Yeah, I do. He’s a great guy.”
“Fuck Howard,” Steve said vehemently, causing Tony to jump. “I would never, and any decent alpha wouldn’t either. Just because we’re an alpha and are biologically equipped with a knot doesn’t mean we have the right to go sticking it anywhere we want.” By the end of the rant, Steve was flushed in the cheek and Tony looked dubious. “I promise you unless you explicitly tell me you want it, babylove, I would never.”
Steve isn’t smiling. “The report,” he says, “about the omegas, the ones that were hurt.” Is going to say it? Say the word? “The ones who were raped.”
"You say that a lot, Rogers," Tony spits, standing and carefully levering himself out the bath as carefully as he can "you, fine, you know what? We're obviously both tired. Something's got you irritated. I'll sleep downstairs."
"You said you wanted to help. And I get it if you don't want to. We can find something else. But honestly, this is the best alternative to, to other things."
"What?" Tony says, staring up at him. "What? You think -- " Tony feels himself swarming with fury "you think I -- is this a joke to you? Have you any comprehension of -- " He can barely articulate the words "you ass! Big strong dom, can't get help from anybody, has to protect his precious little sub you fucking neanderthal!"
The alpha petting him twists, cups his throat. He’s smiling. His face is blurry, but Tony can make out his lips. He lifts his chin to kiss him, if that’s what he wants. The alpha puts his fingers in his mouth. “Do you know why you’re here?” He teases, stroking his cheek with his thumb.
He doesn’t. Tony sits there, hands between his knees, eyes shut and head tipped up, painted in an alpha’s spend. It’s cooled on his skin by the time Steve’s hand grips his throat, tugs him up to straddle his lap.
“Did he do it on purpose,” Bruce says, without saying the word that they’re both thinking. “Was it — intentional.”
He’s just a dog, Tony, the first voice manages wearily. Why would HYDRA want him? As a matter of fact, why do they want you? You aren’t being held hostage, listen to what the doctor is telling you. You’re at a facility, you’re in the ward again. The doctor said Steve isn’t allowed to visit, and neither are any of the Avengers, because of what happened. Listen, Tony, listen to him or you’ll be sucked in here and never let out again.
“Milk,” Tony says absently, pushing meat around the bowl, staring into space. “We say milk on Earth.”
Steve frowns. "What? Christ, no. You'd be the first person I told. I wouldn't -- I'd never keep that from you!"
“You didn’t hurt me,” Tony says guardedly, even though his arm is still bruised. “You were out of your mind.”
"You know," Steve says, carefully "Bucky was a submissive, too. That's how a know some things. I think -- you're both very similar. You wouldn't have known he was a sub unless he was under, like you."
New York hasn’t changed, not at all. The streets are still busy, people still live their lives. Tony had forgotten; how self-centred is that? But hidden away in the facility, he had forgotten that ordinary people live ordinary lives, that life goes on, that somewhere people still dance in clubs and drink fine wine and worry about taxes.
He shrugs. His words come back to him, in parts. He could probably say a few now, if he wanted. But not a sentence.
“I can try,” he laughs. “Cap – I don’t want to be that guy, but the president has asked to see you, you probably want to knock him off first. But don’t you worry, From Stark,” and Rumlow turns that grating smile back at Tony, “I have someone more important for you to see.”
Pierce taps his cheek twice, gently. Tony, he says, reproachful, schooling. Are you paying attention?
“I’m not going to kill you, Richards,” Steve frowns. “If Tony wanted you dead, he would have killed you years ago.”
Steve had thought they would have more time, you see. He had thought, okay, so now Tony’s depressed, but so was I once. And it gets better eventually. We have so much time left, Tony won’t always feel this way, and someday he will get better.
“Would you like that?” He asks again, simply. “Tony? We’re trying to help you, here. You wouldn’t be the first patient with an aid dog. What do you say?”
Those nights, Tony would either drink himself to sleep (best outcome), want Steve to fuck it out of him (middling), or work himself into a rage (bad). And, granted, it was the only time Steve ever really got to see him angry, and it wasn’t often, but it was mildly scary. It would remind Steve of himself as a child, hiding under a table, under a bed, behind his mother’s hip, when his father spat and screamed and smashed.
Pierce flicks ash. “I mean,” he continues, “it seems like the Captain is spurred to action by one, very particular, trigger.”
He can’t imagine Tony ever willingly doing something like that now, laughing as Steve worked himself up in bed and kissing him deeply when he was finished, with his spend dripping down Steve’s balls. He can’t imagine him ever sleeping in a bed like he owns it, or ordering Steve to do anything at all. He wants to brush Tony’s soft hair from his brow, cheeks, but he knows that luxury is no longer afforded to him, not after what happened.
“No,” Tony concedes, “it’s not, like, a rule, you know? I could have run off with any alpha off the street, popped out his spawn, and they could have been omega. I’m not saying, you don’t get poor O’s, of course you fucking do. Just that – I don’t know, Steve, I’m pulling these figures out of my ass, but if I hazarded a guess – maybe 2% of us come from very old, very established lines. The other 8%... they’re your prostitutes. I mean, not all of them, obviously. Most are just normal, middle-class… I’m – talking myself into a corner.”
There’s a small furrow in Tony’s brow. To the untrained eye, it’s like he’s confused. Steve knows it’s worse than that: it means he’s hurt, and trying not to show it.
“I’m rich, I’m pretty, I’m clever. You could work all your life and not achieve a fraction of what I’m worth. I think I’ve earned it.”
Gus lets his cheek rest on the ground. “She was going to kill you,” he exhales “very, very painfully. Trust me, I would know.”
“You gonna screw me?” He asks, stupidly unable to keep want out of his voice, like he’s in heat and it’s his first time.
“I could never be intimidated by you, Stark,” Steve laughs. “You’re an omega in a suit. You wouldn’t be so hard to shut up, all things considered.”
"I don't want the water, Tony, I don't -- " he almost reaches for him again and then holds back "I don't want the water." He says firmly.
A heavy hand rests on his shoulder. “Those who go to Valhalla do not leave easy. A world of eternal happiness, pleasure. Would you take that away? Take it away from a man who — who suffered so much, before he fell?”
Steve shuts his eyes, rubs his face. “I was hurting you, Tony,” he mutters, “more than you realise.”
Tony frowns at him. “You do that,” he says absently, picking up the end of Mr Green’s tie and dropping it into his scotch glass. “Get your tip wet for me, okay?”
“Looks like it. He’s part of the old guard,” Tony tells him, truthfully. “Him, Pierce, your Peggy. I guess he thinks he owes me something. My dad something,” he corrects.
“Earlier, you said – you didn’t know what you did wrong, to make me leave. I just hope you know it’s nothing you did, Tony. It was all me.”
Tony tries, because… he has to listen, for a reason. Pierce is blurry, more colour than man. Everything is blurry, shapes and streaks, not real.
He gags, coughs around the thick skin in his mouth, against his tongue, pushing against the back of his throat. “That’s it,” Steve eases, grunting as he sighs, head back, uncaring of Tony’s distress, “such a good fucking bitch now, huh? Finally learnt your lesson.”
It’s pretty fucking obvious early on that Steve is not going to have any consideration for Tony’s pleasure. He fucks him. Relentless, with no pause for breath, fucks him into the cold, dirty floor. He pulls at Tony’s hair, pulls back his head, makes him bare his throat and
Tony’s ears are ringing, sucking in breath, gripping his throat. “What’s wrong with him?” He wheezes, “what have they done to him?”
Shame. Hot shame, not good, all down his back. He has to duck his gaze, swallow hard, tuck his shoulders against his neck. “Sorry,” he mutters, “I thought – I thought – “
Steve is too alpha. It’s Tony’s working hypothesis – he’s too alpha, he never learnt to contain himself the way well-bred alpha do. He doesn’t contract an omega, he just takes them. What he wants he gets. And so standing, in this room, out of time and out of place…
It's not even a hospital. It's one of those mobile doctor's vehicles. No wonder everyone's all over the place. Was there a battle? Is the battle still going on? He can't hear anything. Maybe Steve should be here by now. Maybe --
Tony lets Steve fold him into the chair, carefully buckling him in. "My head is killing me." Tony mumbles.
“Good,” he says, succinctly, “if you promise me you did it clean, and you didn’t get anyone else involved.”
“Okay,” Steve continues, gently, “I’m glad. Pierce, I hope that so long as we come to an agreement, that can be allowed to stand.”
“Or I’m using you,” Tony says tiredly. “Does it matter? As it happens, I sometimes like having my hair pulled and my face slapped, okay? We’ve been over it. Stop overthinking it.”
“C’mon,” Bucky interrupts. “We should take this to his widow. There are family photos, he has a kid, right? They’ll want this.”
Rumlow leans forward. “Yeah, I’ll bet you are,” he mutters, lip twitching. “I bet we’d see just what kind of bitch you are if the Captain wasn’t there to protect you.”
Peter Parker rubs the back of his neck, looks uneasy. “You were gone a long time. I panicked. I know — what I saw in the news, or whatever, but I didn’t have anyone else to give me answers. I didn’t — Mr Stark, there’s no one else I can trust now.”
Tony presses his head to Steve's knees. "I mean it." He says "I'm sorry I talked about your nightmares like that. It was shitty. And for the record, I wouldn't leave. I'll never stop waking you up when you cry."
This time, only Steve drives Tony, and he takes the passenger seat. He doesn’t ask where they’re going, but Steve emphasises that they’re going to a kennel to pick a dog and if Tony doesn’t want to that’s fine, but Steve has always liked a dog, and so he’d like Tony’s help picking one. Tony rolls his head, glares at him.
he thinks. Not in those words, because his head can’t make words, not really. But the sentiment of it.
“I’m a scientist, too. A bio-engineer, I think. Well, I like to call myself one. I have a colleague do most of the, uh,” he smirks, raises his brows, “heavy-lifting.”
“They didn’t suffer,” Steve tells him. “Most of them, it happened before they even knew what was going on. It was almost – “
The nurse sighs. "You were just a little dehydrated Mr Stark, and it's the last thing you need with a head injury like yours."
Tony shuts the drawer, throws his sleep clothes on a chair. “Do I seem like the type of person to just lie back and take it?”
He wakes in a bedroom. He can’t remember moving. He hands are not bound, and he’s free to move. There’s an ensuite, no razors, and Mosely rests over his feet.
Steve hadn’t paid much attention to Tony’s physiotherapist. She’s short, maybe, by Steve’s standards; just a little under Tony. Thick, curly black hair and a very pale complexion, with a strong nose. That’s about all Steve had noted, other than she looked kind and spoke fast.
Tony shrugs again. He sneaks a look at Nick’s face from under his lashes. Friendly and safe, of course. Obviously. Steve wouldn’t leave him with anyone who wasn’t.
But then a certain catch of light, a sound carried in the thick air. The shadow of a man, hands in pockets, cloaked in sun and head tilted at the sky. He turns, and smiles.
They don’t get many calls. So when the landline rings and Sarah’s in the shower, Tony’s almost reluctant to get it. It could be the media, like when they first found out Tony was living here, and camped outside for a week until the local police scared them away. It could be a salesman. It could be one of Tony’s doctors.
Tony dreams about him. Tall, blank eyes, milky-blue. Lank hair, dark. That awful metal arm. He thinks about the taste of his lips, the feel of him wrapped around his waist. His tongue against his teeth. And then, under it all, the scent of Steve. The scent of home, somewhere buried.
Steve should be elated, then. He should be over the moon that now, Tony does care. That he’s regained enough possession of his mind and body to feel wrong when he’s invaded. He should be glad. “Do I – Tony, when you say touch…”
“Right,” Steve says. “Of course. But – you know it was a formality, right?” And Steve’s tone is near desperate, suddenly. “You know that – you never really would have been charged. Ross’s dirty dealings, that had nothing to do with you, no one wanted you – you prosecuted – “
“That’s funny, Steve, don’t quit the day job.” He slumps into a seat, slings his feet onto the table, helping himself to a bread roll. “Are we eating, or – ”
“It does. And we’ll talk about it, when you’re here. But I think it cost you a lot to say that, didn’t it? It was hard.”
Gus chuckles, props himself up where he begins to slide. “Captain, I have little time for your animosity. Surely, maybe, we can put aside out differences in aim of a common goal?”
A lot of time for Tony, in fact. He doesn’t question it, doesn’t overthink it. He just knows this: Steve would not have asked him here, tonight, unless it was important to him. Gala, the President is here, Fury is here, Alexander Pierce is here, and Steve is the man of the hour.
“I’m sorry if, uh. If me leaving like that, if it left you with some – unanswered questions, or if you were hurt – “
Tony sighs, lets Steve run the water over his head. He feels it spill over his shoulders, down his spine, loves the way Steve's strong fingers work against his head. The sound of water soothes him. "Thank you," he murmurs "for earlier. It was a good scene."
“Okay,” Tony is starting to pull on pants one-handed. “He’ll metabolise it,” he says, fairly confident.
Tony skitters on his feet. The solider is stiff. The Kevlar is rough against his chest. They have to move the solider, so he knows how to do it. Arm around Tony’s waist, the other gripping his hand, not even holding it. Tony’s legs give out. His face smears into his shoulder. They have him waltz Tony around the floor, feet slack, burning when they’re dragged around the carpet.
“Where is he?” He hears Rhodey ask. Sarah says something in reply, but her soft voice is nothing more than the rumble of cadence through the floor. Tony huffs a breath, kicks his legs against the wall of the closet, tries to breathe. He’s being stupid. This is stupid.
Tony gave him a nervous smile but brushed a soft kiss over his cheek, and Steve melted, squeezing his hand between his own. He was warm and softening, gaining weight and starting to get that glow that healthy and happy omega’s always had. “Okay,” he murmured,  turning back to the pan. “Okay,” he whispered again, and Steve ignored it. It wasn’t meant for him, but his heart ached at how Tony still got anxious at things that most would assume would be completely undeserving of punishment.
Bucky sighed and slumped. “Sorry,” he mumbled. “It’s just that my best friend, Steve, he’s off in Iraq and I got discharged after the whole,” he wiggled his left arm. “Thing, and so it just-”
“You’re dating him?” the incredulous shouts came, as Sam and Clint gaped, Natasha looked mildly surprised, which for her was about the equivalent of her jaw on the actual floor, and Thor looked surprised. “Tony Stark?”
,” and Tony whimpers a little bit before clamping his mouth shut. He’s becoming weak, months ago before college he could take shouting and beating without noise and before he’s even punished he’s crying. Christ, he’s
him good at this, all of them. It’s their own fault. They shouldn’t have – shouldn’t have bred him to be used if they didn’t want him to be so good at it.
Tony opens his mouth and sticks out his tongue like the dumb fucking slut he is. His brain is cooked out, not working; it doesn’t even occur to him until Steve is using him like a fucktoy, steering from his hair, that he was close to knotting.
Tony presses closer, nosing between Pierce’s shirt and his skin. He’s lying in bed. The pillows are made of feathers, the sheets are silk. There’s a gag in his mouth, and his wrists are tied with rope. What was it, Ty had said?
Diana chuckles, giggles. “I don’t know, Tony, anything. I’m in charge now. You can be my servant, I suppose. I’m not going to kill you, it would be a waste.”
“Don’t,” Tony says again, but he doesn’t mean it.  Steve lifts his leg, scrapes his nails against the sole of his foot, laughs when Tony laughs. He kisses Tony’s ankle, the delicate joint. Tony sighs. And then his finger trails a soft circle around the skin, over the foot, behind it. He realises.
“Oh, God,” he mutters, pulling back. “I’m sorry. I don’t know what I’m thinking, I’m – “ Jesus. What the fuck is wrong with him? Tony feels his cheeks heat, the utter stupidity of him, scenting an alpha like that, scenting –
“But he must have said something,” Tony presses, lodging himself between the door and door-frame. “He must have, right? I think – whatever you heard, I can explain – “
“This landed on my desk this morning from R&D. You know something weird? I couldn’t find any record of it on our servers. So top secret it didn’t even exist.”
“It’s held together with a gold-titanium alloy,” Diana says proudly, hips swishing, and Tony thinks he’s heard those words somewhere else before. “I had it made specially for you. I knew you would be coming.”
Such trust. Nick will be so happy with his latest acquisition. “Great,” Tony tells him, shortly. He takes another drag, flicks ash into the sky.
“Right. Shawarma. I won’t tell you them you cried,” he teases. “All over little old me, imagine that. Dad would be so proud.” He turns away, looks over his shoulder. “You coming?”
Steve favourite was a sushi bar a block away from the tower. It used to make Tony laugh, how impressed Steve was by the automated counters. He thought it was like stepping into a sci-fi novel, he thought raw fish was something so exotic, and so like every other part of their relationship, Tony indulged him.
“You weren’t,” Steve agrees, but even that’s said like it’s all easy-breezy apple-pie. “Sit,” he orders, pulling out the chair at the head of the table.
“That’s it,” Steve sighs, bracing his hands on his hips, leaning back slightly, shoulders squared, as if stretching his back. “Good boy,” he says, absently patting Tony’s hair, “don’t fight it,” he advises, “relax your muscles, let it happen. Swallow
“I like you wearing my things,” he calls over his shoulder, as if to lighten the mood. Tony laughs, lies himself on the couch. It’s soft, deep, unlike the modern things he has back at the tower. Back home, he should say. “It’s cute.”
the thought ‘I’m not your friend’ drifting through the Captain’s brain. Instead, he goes for the more diplomatic. “You’re surprisingly chipper.”
Tony has one hand braced on the seat, the other in the shape of a fist crashing against the window. “You never listen,” he’s breathing “you never listen, you never listen, you never, ever listen to me, why don’t you listen, why don’t you listen, I just want to go home, I’m tired, I’m tired, I’m tired, I’m – “
“A dimension, I suppose. Your notion of God, it isn’t… unfamiliar, across the worlds. Maybe there was someone who created everything, on Asgard we have our own myths. I am supposedly a god, although I can’t think of myself that way. But yes: Valhalla. Another dimension, if you will. I have been there often in my youth, because on Asgard we possess that ability.”
Pierce groans on the floor, makes a sound a like sick animal. Tony swills the drink in his mouth, gargles, spits the taste of him onto the floor. He brushes the back of his hand across his mouth. His spit is mixed with blood.
He realises, he must sound slightly breathless. They’re all staring at him. Tony narrows his eyes, closes his fingers around the stone. It sparks, harmlessly, unused. “You okay, Cap?” He asks, suspicious. “You look a little winded.”
"Yes, you are." A doctor says, helping lever him into a sitting position. The lights in here are definitely too bright. Tony winces, tries to shield his eyes with his arm. The blue robe has gone and now he's wearing one of those horrific white hospital smocks that tie up at the back. "How was that, Mr Stark. Not too traumatic I hope?"
"I was thinking about our list. All those things you want to try out." Tony pushes back his head to look up at Steve, see him smirk.
The vest is too tight. Pierce had tied it, lovingly, the way Steve might before a night out. Steve never pulled the stays this tight. He never wanted Tony’s waist to be so sharp he could barely breath. His ribs are so bruised, and he can’t breathe. He hurts to badly, and he’s hemmed in with this final torture, a corset that’s too damn tight. He thinks, he might be bleeding through his shirt. He thinks, he wishes he could squeeze the life out of Pierce the way the heavy fabric is squeezing the life out of him.
he thinks again, not risking fighting back. Steve will almost certainly see it as an affront, a rejection. His legs are shaking, he realises, distantly. He scents so angry, so distant –
Steve runs his fingers over Tony’s stretched bottom lip, inhales heavily. “I just like the idea of it,” he says. “You all quiet, having to just – deal with it,” he smirks. Two fingers sit heavy on Tony’s tongue. “Do you want to suck them for me?”
he makes sure to rectify, quickly, “but because I would like to have words with you, Rogers. I’ve had time to stew. Twenty-one days, to be exact.”
“Maybe we could have done better,” Peter concedes. “I don’t know, Mr Stark. Maybe – we could have got the gauntlet, I guess. But what then? Would you have had it? Because, no offence Mr Stark, but you’re probably not the best – “
The worst of the burns are on the right side of this throat, skin mottled, twisted. Vaguely, it’s the shape of a handprint, except when the skin began to melt it lost most of its shape. The left side has one thumb mark, where Killian had squeezed. It stretches up towards his jaw, ugly, unavoidable.
Instead, Tony lays his hand against Steve’s chest. He smells his lust scent, low-key and simmering throughout their conversation, ratchet up. His pupils expand. His breath is forcefully long and low. “When’s the last time someone touched
He rolls onto his side, blinks at him. “I’m going to make myself perfect,” he whispers. “I’m going to – to take off twenty years.”
Tony taps out two fingers on Steve's thigh, bracing his hands on Steve's knees. "Good boy," Steve says, slightly breathless "that's great. You, you just get to work and I'll -- " Steve loses words for a moments at Tony sucks at his head "I'll just sit here."
Tony stares at her and feels… well, the drugs won’t really let him feel, but he feels shaky and ill. He wants to feel anger, because Tony has lost everything paying for Ultron’s reparations, and yet he never would have made Ultron if Wanda hadn’t forced him. He really wants to be sick, the conflict of emotions inside him stirring him up and –
“I drove down to your HQ. Steve said he’s been coming here everyday but they won’t let him see you.”
and people loved it on him, and it hadn’t been daring anymore, it had become something he had to have to project this stupid fucking image he built for himself, and –
Tony curls his head into Steve’s shoulder. It surprises him; a few days ago, he was afraid that Tony wanted him dead, that he hated him for what he did, resented his presence. Now, though, he tightens his grip. “Do you really still love me?” He asks.
“I’m good thanks,” Rhodey smiles. “You’re a regular face around here?” He says, once the nurse has gone.
“The Captain and Ms Romanoff are currently hosting a dinner. I believe Doctor Banner and Mr Barton will be joining shortly. I am sure you will be welcome.”
“Calm down,” Steve manages, but he sounds panicked himself. “Look, we’re leaving. See? I’m leaving. I’m driving away, here. We’ll come back another day, it’s fine, it’s fine Tony, it’s okay.”
“I know,” Tony says, slowly. His words mash together, slur into one another like syrup, so droopy and carefully placed. “I still have lawyers.”
As I was saying, I do not excuse how your father and I have treated you. To grow up without parents is unforgivable. To grow up unloved is abhorrent. To grow up with two alcoholic parents is horrific. And I cannot put onto paper the weight of the injustice thrown upon you by us, made worse by the fact that it was completely avoidable.
He presses into Tony's mouth. "Suck." He says, again, and Tony cleans his come off of Steve's hand, movements sloppy and uncoordinated.
Tony glares at him. He can’t quite shake the feeling that Steve could have avoided falling 2000ft if he’d been more careful, and the fact he wasn’t irritates him. He makes a short, stubborn noise with the back of his throat. Pushes at his shoulders.
Pierce cards his fingers through Tony’s hair, lifts up his head. He tsks, and dabs at a string of drool from the corner of his mouth. “Good boy,” he says, as if Tony has done something, and then strokes him back down onto the pillow, scratches his nails absently against the back of Tony’s neck. “You’re the most responsive omega I’ve ever seen, did you know that, Tony? Unbelievable. Even at your age, you just feel it all so keenly, don’t you?” He rubs his knuckles behind Tony’s ear; he shivers.
She reaches out, brushes an errant tear from his cheek. “You never cried,” she murmurs, “not once. Because I think, for you – he was never really gone, was he?”
He’s blinking up at the blurry shapes leaning over him, talking at him, about him, around him. He wants to recoil, hide from the noises and large, loud sounds. He wants to raise his hands so he can push them all away.
He wasn’t invited. Steve didn’t invite him. He’d waited before even asking him to spend the evening, out of pity. Tony doesn’t want pity, oh no. It’s cold. He’s not wearing a coat. He doesn’t want pity. He’s going to show Steve everything that he can bring to the table, yes he will. He’s --
“Sarah helps,” Tony admits. “She gets me focused on the little things. You know, gardening. Walking. Cooking. Is that crazy? I’m really fucked up, Jim. I — I go to sleep at ten every night and get up early so I can walk my dog and make breakfast. Am I mad?”
He’s called him a lot, in the seven months he’s been gone. At first, it was every day, then every week. Then, once a month. But never less than that. Every time it went unanswered, he’d send a message, in that clunky way he texts:
"C'mon," Steve chides "up, get in." He turns back to the woman "Thanks." He says again, and follows Tony inside.
“Since the start. He was always very… touchy feely. After I went off my meds – when I got difficult. He got a bit more bold. I’m just saying, if it’s okay, I’d like to get a new one.”
“Why is it always me?! You’re an asshole, no one’s – oof.” Steve’s bracketing his head with his arms, the window freezing against his bare ass, sucking a line down his throat. “Oh,” Tony says, because his tongue has found his sweet-spot, just behind his ear, “oh, fuck.”
Did he just say that? Pierce looks up, smiles at him. “Well, it’s nice to hear you say that, Tony.” He taps two fingers lightly against Tony’s chin, and he doesn’t even flinch. It feels nice. Good, to have someone guide his head to the side, gentle.
“Other than the occasional masturbation,” Tony says seriously. And regrets it almost immediately when Steve doesn’t laugh, or smile, or – react, in any discernible way.
Which as good a segway as any. “You often feel like – like you have emotions you can’t control, Steve?” He pulls up his knees, tucks himself against the couch, head bent slightly to the side to bear his neck.
“Nothing to be sorry for,” Steve says roughly, clearing his throat. “You’ve been there for me, Tony. You’ve, uh. Given me a home. So, I’m here for you now. Whenever you need me.”
There’s a bad ache all up his side. His wrist is clammed up in a splint. To stand, he has to shakily rest himself against the bedside table. Someone’s removed the apple, left two pink pills. He ignores them.
This is the fool Thanos saw as equal. He showed this man more respect in one fight than he showed Nebula her entire life. And yet, he she is, still with fire in her heart, while this idiot gabbles and tears at his clothes and weeps at his hands like a mother with the blood of her baby on her palms.
“After,” Tony agrees, and he feels slightly breathless, dizzy from the twist with Steve’s and Pierce’s scents intermingled in his nostrils. “Schmooze,” he says, rolling the word over his tongue, “hah! Aren’t you just a regular political player these days, Steve.”
Steve is trying, Tony knows. Oh he is intimately aware of how hard Steve is trying. It’s guilt, something whispers inside his head. He’s guilty, he’s guilty and so he thinks he can make this better by helping you. You’re his penance.
He feels furs under his belly, feels his nakedness, and it doesn’t bother him, not really, why would it, but it sends the first tendrils of doubt running through his mind, curling at the base of his skull. A feeling of unease settles in his belly.
“Yeah you do.” Steve sighs. “Of course you do.” He pauses. “Was it – was it something we said? I didn’t mean – ”
Pierce cocks his head to the side, looks sad, or maybe – bemused. “Tony,” he says, softly. “You are one of the dumbest smart people I’ve ever met, did you know that? But then again, you are only omega.”
“Every night,” he says, and Tony doesn’t know how to respond. So he wraps his arms around Steve’s neck, simple, easy, gives the kind of comfort only an omega can give.
“I was, for awhile. I was here for physio too. Among other things, obviously. I — do you want to see?”
Still, he collects himself. “Her phone was there,” he continues. And her shoes. Wine glass. But she’s gone. And that’s that.”
That cuts him, even though he’s already been nothing but cruel. “Just go,” he mutters, tucking his chin against his knees, still not having looked him in the face. “Get out. Leave me alone.”
Warning for Diana. And her disturbing imagery. Eeesh. No actual torture, but still. Diana is not a nice person.
“If I had it my way, I’d shoot you now. Good clean death. But he killed my sister, and I want revenge, and apparently I
He realises he’s lost Steve, or rather, his bearings – the champagne must have gone to his head. “Woah,” he hears Steve say, laughing at him, or rather, with him; he grips his waist to stop him stumbling, catches his hand. “You drunk already?”
“Well,” Steve says, sighing, rolling onto his front, punching the pillow. “I don’t want kids, for what it’s worth. And even if I did, we could get a breeder. But that other stuff – is fine. I’m in no rush, Tony.” He reaches forward, kisses his shoulder. “I’m sorry,” he adds, quietly, “if I upset you.”
“Back off,” Pierce mutters, “just give him some space, you’re upsetting him. Here – tell them we’ve found him. Tell them – it was nothing, he wasn’t missing, he just bumped into an old friend and lost track of time.”
Tony is helpless. He thinks his jaw might break. His eyes are stinging, his chest damp with his own drool, and his prick – is still so fucking hard against his belly. “What was I saying?” Steve asks casually, shifting forward slightly which means nothing to him, but drives the knot further against Tony’s throat, the slow pumping of come into his belly triggering a weak coughing fit, seed just slipping through the corners of his mouth. “About your rightful place. I’d keep you here permanently if I could, Stark. What do you think? You’d be a good come-dump, full-time. It would certainly keep you out of trouble.”
“You’re not going to hurt me,” he says, confidently. “You don’t know how. You’ve never killed with your own two hands in your life.”
“Yeah, well it regenerated my cells,” Tony says defensively. “I didn’t do it on purpose.” A beat. “You’re, uh – my arm. It hurts.”
He slaps his hands against Steve’s arms, kicks his legs, pulls his hair and scratches his back. Jarvis blares lights and cymbals and a red flashing alarm. Steve’s brow furrows, his face scrunches, and he opens his eyes.
“Don’t pull out,” Tony blurts, quickly, gripping Steve’s shoulders. “No, don’t – it’s fine. Don’t rush it.”
He jerks. He can barely lift his head. His face feels swollen, his brain feels swollen. He’s tied to a chair. Ankles and wrists, except for a garter belt no one bothered to remove.
Tony doesn’t even think he could make it up stairs like this. So he settles on the couch, blanket wrapped over his shoulders. He didn’t know it was possible to sleep this much, but it comes easy, and then he rests.
“I want…” Steve’s mouth is dry “I want to be there.” He sees his friends smile, he sees an eternal sun and fields of gold. “How do I get there?”
“I guess you’ve changed something for me,” Tony murmurs, closing his eyes. “I would have had the skin tanned off my ass if I was caught with a pair of these growing up.”
Tony looks away, down, desperately anywhere that’s not Steve, so he doesn’t have to see pity on his face. “It’s bad,” he croaks.
He clicks a button, the slideshow moves on. A picture of a small village, somewhere in Eastern Europe. Old Nazis who figure themselves HYDRA’s spiritual successor. The few shop-fronts burnt husks. And then a photo, with the upper face blurred, of a young man, bleeding from the mouth, dead on the floor.
“Meh,” Tony mumbled, turning his head so his cheek was pressed against STeve’s collarbone. “What’sit?”
Toni’s smile dimmed as she took in the sight of her friend. Pepper was bent over her desk with her head in her hands, and her pen balanced precariously in her slack hands as she simply stared at the fine oak of her desk. Never once could Tony remember Pepper not in a full flurry of activity while at the office, much less react so dimly when she walked in on time with a stack full of completed work.
Tony watched him warily, making Steve’s heart twist painfully in his chest. Had he really disappointed Tony so often that he was so cautious at the thought of an actual date?
Bucky sighed, lovestruck. He always felt good when Tony called him sir, whether Tony was down or just as a loving term in their home. “Yeah?” he asked, standing again and starting to strip off his suit jacket and unknot his tie that Tony had done this morning. “What’d ya do today, darling?”
I know I'm behind, but with school just starting, everything's a little bit hectic. Hopefully, I'll be able to catch up soon and then we'll be back to normal.
Bucky snorted but didn’t say anything. This was an argument they’d had many a time. “Here,” he said instead, unwrapping his hand from Tony’s waist. “Just wait here.”
Tony giggled reluctantly. “Charmer,” he said teasingly, flopping over the couch to land in a tangled mess in Steve’s lap.
The steward opened their room with a flourish and showed them inside. “This will be your room for the night Mr. and Mr. Rogers. I hope you find everything satisfactory, and if you need anything just ring down to the lobby and we will do our best to accommodate all of your needs.”
making this an au because i only have lke seven hours to finish t“Hi,” Steve crooned, crawling over the bed to where Tony was waiting with open arms. “Hi, sweetheart,” he murmured, kissing his neck and blowing a raspberry just to feel Tony squeal and bat at him uselessly. “How are you feeling?”
hey, y'all. I am so so so sorry about my updates, I know I said every Wednesday, but clearly that's not happening. i just have lot going on in terms of school and the work I have to get done, so I never have time to get myself together, especially because for me, midterms were last week, so I didn't fix what I have written for chapter twelve, and didn't get it done Monday, yesterday, or today. I am so sorry, but I promise I'm not abandoning this fic, nor is it going on hiatus.
you want to talk!?” Tony stared at him with scathing furor, flushed red in anger. “It’s good to know that I have to be hysterical for you to care."
Steve smiled, and went for the clasp on the back of the wedding dress, undoing the clasp with careful fingers. He hopes that the dress can eventually be something that they can, or at least Tony can look back on with fond thoughts, and not something that symbolized the end of his world. “Okay?” he asked, as his fingers brushed the porcelain skin of Tony’s back.
Steve smiled and cupped Tony’s cheek, rubbing the smooth, rouge touched cheek. “Then why can’t we?” he pressed their lips together to quickly swallow Tony’s arguments. The fastest way to stop Tony from saying something rash, he had learned, was to kiss him. For a man who was claimed to have slept with his whole kingdom, he always got wonderfully flustered after a kiss.
Tony strode forward and cupped his alpha’s cold cheeks. “There have been studies that say a man with shellshock’s mate can keep the symptoms away. Somethin’ to do with pheromones, or whatever, an’ it’s been proven globally.” He paused and, carefully, went up on his toes to kiss Steve’s jaw. “C’mon alpha.”
“Yeah, Bucky,” Tony whispered awestruck, before putting the puppy down on the couch to give him a hug. “Thank you,” breathed Tony into his shoulder. “Thank you so much.”
“Uh, you were asleep and you’re son looked like he was about to throw a tantrum of epic proportions, and you looked like you needed to sleep, so I was just making faces at your kid to keep him entertained.” Steve flushed at the ramble of words that spilled out of his mouth. “I didn’t mean to overstep.”
Steve helped him off of the train car, swinging him down with ease by his waist as he tripped over his own dress--
Steve swallowed down the anger hesitantly. “Tony? Honey, are you crying?” Steve asked concernedly, reaching up to cup his face, to feel his temperature. Tony didn’t cry in front of him
I just wanted to explain what was going on, even though you guys do deserve better. thank you for all your support--your kudos and comments mean the world to me, and they are what especially motivate me to get that google doc open and start putting my ideas to text. Here's hoping that I can post next week!
Tony's shoulders were shaking and the omega wiped at his face--was he brushing away tears?. “I am yours, so you can use me how you’d like--”
He stops. What? Steve looks confused. Is this a part of the punishment? Make him repeat it often enough for him to know what he’d done wrong?
He considers leaving, just getting out the door before Steve lays into him, and he knows he won’t be walking right at least, most likely not being able to move without wincing. He remembers when Howard laid into him the first time, how he couldn’t sit down or lie on his back for weeks. He considers dropping the glass and grabbing his case and leaving.
“Nothing, Alpha,” he mumbled but the poor thing was as stiff as a board and his hands were curled into fists against his thighs. “I yours to use as wanted.” The thing was obviously rehearsed, and Steve just about fell off the bed when he realized what Tony was referring to.
, Tony, you haven’t ever been a bother! You could never be a bother. I’ve been busy, baby, with my art project though that’s no excuse. I'm so so sorry, honey. And I always have time for you, though that doesn't really excuse me for goin' out with Bucky and Sam. I'm sorry. We’re partners, Tony, and I lost sight of how you were feeling. I’m gonna do my best to make it up to you,” he promised, squeezing at Tony’s calloused hand determinedly. “Why don’t we go out? We can go to that gay bar over on third street or we can rent a movie cheap and watch it in out boxers together, or we can get dressed up and splurge on dinner with some of those savings we have holed away for a rainy day. Whatever you want.”
Steve grabbed his hips with one hand and held him in place. “Almost done, babe,” he said, hushing Tony. “Almost done. I’m sorry.”
Tony shrunk uncomfortably into Steve’s side, and Steve didn’t have to look to see that Tony was nibbling on his lip and fiddling with his -- frankly adorable glasses, the ones with the big black frames that made Tony look like a lost puppy-- and wrapped a comforting arm around Tony’s waist, curling his fingers into Steve’s varsity letterman jacket that Tony was wearing. “Yes, I am,” he said firmly, and secretly relished the look as all four of them started shouting again. “Tony and I have been going out for a couple of months.”
Above the constellations swam as Artemis passed her course, the two clinging to one another as the sun rose.
When Steve wakes up, Tony is fast asleep, still burrowed into his chest and wrapped in the blanket cocoon that Steve had tucked him into. He’s drooling, Steve notes affectionately, rubbing his back and carefully tugging his shirt down from where it had ridden up. He looks over Tony’s fluffy little head and slumps when he realizes that it’s already six and they had to be catching a train in an hour and a half, just enough time for them to shower and grab something for breakfast. He sighs again, the I’m-annoyed-but-I’m-gonna-suffer-tragically-but-while-looking-pretty one that Nat had so aptly named (he assumed, he got that a lot), and yes, Steve knows the names too. “Tony,” he leans down and murmurs into the omega’s ear. “We gotta go, sweetheart and I need to make sure you’re up."
Tony leaned his head on the window, relishing the cold and the slight bumps as the train carried him farther away from home. Really, he wasn’t going that far, just an hour by train, and if they got the service they got that morning, it would be even less. But to be away from Jarvis, and Ana, and his
Bucky blew a ring of smoke clear out in the chilly air and drummed his fingers on the filthy brick wall behind him. He was waiting for his sweetheart, who sat inside with his mentee for his tutoring. His little sweetheart was such a doll. Pure and sweet and cringed from physical violence, though he didn’t hesitate to rip into anyone verbally. Some days Bucky wondered how in hell Tony had ended up with him.
MJ sighed and turned to face him, ticking off her fingers. “Ms. Romanoff would eat him alive, Mr. Barton would blow up the school with him, Mr. Banner would take over the world with their brains, Mr. Odinson is in a relationship and I don’t think he’s into polyamory, Mr. Coulson would chew him up and spit him out, I don't want to think about Principal Fury and Mr. Stark--" she said and Steve shuddered. Blech. "and Mr. Barnes would kill him in his sleep,” she said, giving Steve a frankly intimidating stare. "You're our last hope."
“Well, you are pretty small,” Steve said, grinning up at his husband and lacing their fingers together as Tony swatted at his shoulder. “And we do look pretty good together.”
Steve smiled and squeezed Tony’s knee, standing up and helping Tony up too to give him a hug again. “I’ve liked you since I heard that you got mad at your sexist physics professor at MIT and you put his car on top of the social studies department.”
“You mean Tony?” he asked, spinning around in his comfortable chair and wiping his charcoal-smudged hands down on his smock. “Yeah, I do. He’s a great guy.”
Getting into their new house is uneventful. It’s a big apartment on the nice side of Brooklyn, a part that Steve admits he’s never been to, and Tony couldn’t say he’d ever been either except for maybe when he was little and unpresented, and Howard still liked him.
Steve didn’t say anything, but Tony felt his being pulled into Steve’s lap and turned to hide his face in Steve’s shirt. It smelled nice, like healthy alpha and apples. He moaned quietly as Steve returned to massaging his scalp, and went limp. “You wanna take a nap?” Steve’s voice seemed far away and Tony whined, butting his head against the hand that was rubbing his head.
Steve dropped his bag with a thud in the foyer of Tony and his’ apartment wearily. Today had been a long, long day. Over in Brooklyn, there had been a shooting a local elementary school, the kid with the gun shooting three people fatally and several more in the hospital. To top it off, after his spree, the shooter had shot himself, committing suicide. He was a kid. A fifteen-year-old who probably had hopes and dreams and had people who loved him.
Bucky let him, and rested his hand on his omega’s belly, relishing the soft kicks against his hand. Tony let out a sharp exhale at one particularly strong kick, and Bucky winced in sympathy and rubbed Tony’s back, right where he complained about aches all the time. “Feelin’ alright, baby?” he murmured, bending down to kiss Tony when Tony got the tie off him and got off his belt, untucking his shirt and leaving everything else intact. “I know you’ve been feelin’ ache-y.”
Steve nodded politely and suppressed the urge to shut the door in the man’s face. He was only doing his job. Tony didn’t say anything behind him and Steve wondered if he just wasn’t the talkative type, considering he had said nothing but what the officiant told him to say, a quiet mewl when Steve had broken his bonding gland and quiet polite conversation with guests at the reception through the whole wedding. “Thank you,” the blonde said. His Ma didn’t raise with no manners.  “We’ll be sure to.”
Tony flinched, looking at him through surprisingly thick lashes and shaking his head, before flinching and mumbling, “Whatever you would like, sir.”
They all shut up for a precious few seconds, before the barrage started again, this time much more coordinated. “So,” Sam started slowly. “Is this serious?” He was looking straight at Tony, and Steve figured that this was their way of assessing Tony and Steve was overcome with as much fondness for their protectiveness as he was annoyed for sizing Tony up.
Bucky grinned down at his, kissing the omega’s temple. “Don’t’cha worry your pretty little head about it,” he said. “It’s my pleasure.”
he’s so greedy, he’s not supposed to make deals with his alpha, his dom, he knows better. “Please, please don’t be mad, don’t shout, I’ll be good, I promise.”
“You goin’ down, sweetheart?” Bucky asked, pulling them both out of the dance floor and to the near-empty hall, which fully emptied when Bucky glared, tugging Tony behind him and watching as the last stragglers skittered down the hall. He pushed Tony gently against the wall, caging him in with his arms, knowing that it made Tony feel safer and more secure, a confession whispered in the dark. “Feelin’ floaty yet?” He fingered Tony’s collar, which he had bought for the sub when they had gone public, a collar being the traditional norm for taken subs.
Steve leaves early the next morning for something, and with his warmer gone, Tony is forced to wake up. He blearily wanders into the kitchen, already unpacked by whoever was in charge of welcoming America’s beloved Captain back home. He looks, but there’s no coffee maker. He’ll have to remedy that as soon as possible, but for then he settles on grabbing a cold glass of water. At the very least it’ll shock him awake. But he’s tired and bleary-eyed and he drops the glass, the cup shattering to a million pieces under his feet and the noise is enough to shock him right through his bones.
Tony leaned into him and Bucky helped him waddle into the foyer, where the box was still sitting inconspicuously, air holes drilled. “Still,” the omega groused. “Don’t need that many gifts.”
A beat. Tony’s head jerks to look at him; his eyes are wide, rabid, fevered, lined with red. “Yeah,” Steve tells him, quietly, soothing, “I know, Tony. You tried your best.”
Steve stands by the couch, looming. “I don’t know,” he shrugs. “I don’t see why we shouldn’t. Had fun last time, didn’t you?”
Clint drags out a harness. “Put the vamp in this,” he says, wind from the quinjet repulsers blowing his hair “we’ll lift him up. Steve, put this on.” And he hands Steve a harness, straps him to the rope.
There’s someone else there, though. Hooded, standing braced against wind with his hands in his pockets.
“I said, do you agree?” Pierce presses. His face is blurry. His lips are moving, and sound follows after. Disconnect.
“And you’ll need to do press. Explain that you’re grateful justice has been served, that you’ve always maintained you were unfairly weighed against — “
Tony watches his hands on the cards. Fast and steady, even now – Tony’s hands shake more than Fury’s, and Tony’s half his age.
“I’m not a god, Steve. I am a person, like any other. But around the universe, there are… different species of human.”
"So." Tony says "Let's start again. You told me, last night, that you were looking into counselling. Why."
Back in the good days, he and Tony would go for lunch. At least once a week, any day. Usually when Tony had been in the office, because he said it gave him something to look forward to. They’d tried everything, Italian, Chinese, Vietnamese, Thai, Indian, every cuisine under the sun.
Tony opens his eyes, strains upward best he can. His vision is blurry, slightly, fuzzy with unshed tears, the pressure of keeping position. Steve’s hand cups his cheek, thumb strokes over his temple. “Jesus,” he mutters, wiping absently at a tear, “if you knew how you looked right now, Stark.”
“Company.” Steve mulls the word over. “I suppose I got the wrong impression, huh? When you invited me, away, to share single-bed room as your date.”
Now, she’s talking about taking Tony out tomorrow. She says she understand it’s the anniversary of his parent’s death (Steve curses himself for forgetting) and he wants to visit the graves. She says she’s more than happy to drive him, since it’s on the way, and she’ll happily drive him back too.
“You know, what you can do,” Pepper finishes. “I love him. God knows, I loved him. And he gave me Morgan, and – we were so happy,” she laughs, softly. “He chose me, this time. Because you both made choices. But maybe, in some other time – maybe, with different choices, it would go some different way.”
But it was worth it for the rolled eyes and sneer whenever his parents saw it. Like he’d done something they didn’t like, for himself, and that made it good.
Tony braces his hands on the sink. He would explain it wasn’t Sarah’s fault, or Rhodey’s. That he understands they just want the best for him. But maybe the best is just him… going away. Everything would be simple then.
It’s pretty boring, but relatively satisfying, sex. Tony cups his head, lets his fingers brush through the blond hair, intimate. “I know my place,” he says, easily, “your bed only.”
“Do you know how to dance, soldier?” One of them asks. “I’m sure you do, somewhere. I’m sure you used to be quite the bitch-magnet, huh?”
They all bring him little gifts. Some fresh fruit, or bread, or cake. Wanda comes with a stack of books she said Steve found in his bedroom, and Tony is grateful, at least.
They did the soles of his feet, too, but those are long gone. Tony’s toes twitch at the memory, and Steve’s kisses on each scar don’t do much to bring him back. But then he nips at the soft, plump skin of his inner thigh, bites once, then again,
breed your genes, that’s for certain. You and my soldier both. Tony’s as good a vessel as any. I’ll put you in the chair, same as him,” he nods at the soldier, “I’ll fry your brains. You’ll kill when I ask you, you’ll fuck when I ask you, like a good stud. And I get to keep our lovely Tony all to myself. Does that sound more agreeable to your famous
He lunges, and Pierce scatters back, into a side table, throws it in his path, laughing, wheezing. “You’re too slow,” he mocks, “you won’t be able to do it, Stark. Give up. Give in.”
He whimpers. “I’m sorry,” he says, and Steve growls in frustration, shakes him. He cries out, can’t help it; the shock of sharp pain sends his nerves skittering, takes him by surprise.
good. No doubt, SHIELD will get to see everyone’s little secrets, because no one reads the fine print. Ty gets the money, SHIELD gets – world domination, probably. Tony gets an irritating problem off his back, and enough to time to dig through Ty’s private computer and delete any copies he has of incriminating footage.
She dumps her crumbs in the trash and leaves. It’s the first time she’s addressed it head on, the first time anyone has said, bluntly: Tony is dead. It leaves a bitter taste in his mouth. Thinking about the day ahead, about the next day, and the day after that, all of them without him, with nothing to look forward to, it makes him —
“I doubt it. We have fun last night, Captain. If you don’t show up, it won’t be so fun for Tony. I can’t say he’ll enjoy himself much.”
Absently, he wipes a tear from his cheek, sips his drink. Pierce is kind enough not to mention it, sitting himself next to him on the couch. “Now,” he says, quietly, fatherly, “let’s see what we can do about this arm, hmm?”
Then there are footsteps pounding up the stairs. Christ, not for him, right? Please say the guest is going to bathroom. Please, for the love of God, don’t let them come in here —
Steve is behind the glass. He’s curled in the corner, naked, bruised, bloodied, more vulnerable than Tony’s ever known him. “Oh,” he breathes, “my poor Cap. What the hell have they done to you?”
Oh please, the first voice laughs, you won’t leave here, idiot. There’s only one way you get to leave here. They don’t want you, Tony, but they know how to use you, and there are still things you’re good for. Hey, maybe they’ll trot you out in front of the crowd, dress you up in a suit and use you for press tours, or get you back on those weapons. Maybe Steve will truss you up like a pony and use your ass, maybe you can be their beating boy, maybe Barnes will use you like a slave and Clint for target practice, it’s what you deserve, it’s what you deserve, it’s what you deserve –
and I tried to make it better for him, but somehow it was – too short, but it took too long. There wasn’t anything I could say. There wasn’t anything I could do. He was just a kid,”
“We would like to have you,” Steve tries, one last time. “It would be good to have you back on the team.”
He hears crashing in the kitchen. It doesn’t sound like decaf. Aimlessly, he decides to investigate, although he suspects he knows the cause; Steve has – crushed a mug against the countertop. And now he’s bleeding. “It’s fine,” he says.
I know how this must sound. No boy should have to hear about their mother's escapades, and I won't horrify you with them here. But you remember the baby, don't you? The last one, the last one I lost. I had plans. I was going to leave your father. I was going to raise this new baby on my own. I thought my lover would take me in, or that somehow we would be able to have a life together. I was dreaming. The baby died. Nick consoled me, for a time, but then Howard found out. After that, I rarely saw him again.
Tony blinks and nods. He sits at one of the chairs at the table and Steve pushes him in. He lays his hands straight on the countertop, tries to space evenly the gap between each finger, which engrosses him for a time, allows him to forget that there’s even anyone else there. He doesn’t even flinch when someone sets themselves down in the seat next to him, too focussed on the triangle shapes his fingers make.
An awkward silence. Steve clears his throat. “I brought you this,” he says, holding something out. Tony doesn’t look at him, but he does creep his eyes to the right to see the package.
A couch, a desk, a wall that looks out at the sky. “Pierce,” Tony hears himself say, face screwed, “is he – is he going to be okay?”
Tony throws the bundled up crumpled letter at him. It bounces off his shoulder. “This,” he croaks, covering his eyes with his hands and leaning against his knees.
Steve always feels light-headed, when Tony mentions that. It’s like piercing a balloon. It reminds him of reality, that Tony is older, and human, and he suffers physically in a way Steve never will. He swallows, puts down his chopsticks and says, “Oh yeah?” As casual as he can manage.
He flips the screen in his face. Nine missed calls, seventeen missed messages, four voicemails. Tony shuts his eyes. For the first time, he wants to cry.
“It’s been a long few days, actually,” Ross close-enough sneers at him, downing his drink. “We lost men.”
So Steve and Tony pick a grassy plain, just overlooking the small houses below. That night, they stand there, urn in hand.
"Okay." Tony says, evenly, irritated as he feels his remaining sub space fall away "Or, you could admit that, you know, as a dom, you enjoy sometimes... letting me have it, and we could work through alternative therapies together, because -- and brace yourself for this, because it's a big one -- we are, in fact, in a relationship, which, according to my books means we lean on each other for mutual support. Mutual."
A few seconds later, a shrill howl was piercing the air, and Tony was racing forward to the source of the sound, no doubt in his mind that his alphas were doing the same. The crowd withdrew fairly easily when they realized who he was, but he still had to shove his way through the last bits of the throng, only to feel his heart stop as a wickedly familiar face glared back at him; Justin Hammer. “Get your hands off my daughter!” Tony demanded, curling his fists as the other alpha smirked back at him.
(He’d admit he did stupid things sometimes just to make Tony laugh and coax him out of his shell, and stoutly ignored the fluttering in his stomach that was distinctly unlike friendship. The very first time Tony had disagreed with him, he’d clapped a hand over his mouth and sank to his knees with a sickening crack, turning pale enough that Steve worried for his health. They’d come a long way from that.)
Steve gaped. That was what this was about? He had a huge art project due in weeks, his first subject had dropped out on him and caused him to waste weeks of time, and Tony was mad that he hadn’t come to bed? “I was fuckin’ busy, Tony! And that means you have to shove me?”
When he looked up, Tony was beaming, a hand over his mouth. “Oh, it’s so cute!” Tony whispered. “And so small.”
Steve didn’t respond until they were both in the car, only then turning to look at him with something unreadable in his eyes. “How did you know to do that?” Steve demanded and Tony flinched unintentionally, ducking his shoulders to make the hit he suspected was coming to avoid his already bruised shoulder from before the wedding. And Steve was a supersoldier, his hits had to hurt more than Howard, though the old man had a mean swing.
“Sorry,” Tony muttered a flash of something going across his face before evening out into Tony’s placid if nervous look. “Sorry.”
They sleep in the same bedroom that night and Tony learned that his new-husband was an octopus, though neither of them could say they minded.
Tony laughed but whimpered aloud as Steve finally got working inside him. “Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow,” he moaned, squirming helplessly and trying to work his hips away from Steve’s fingers, lifting them to get away from his probing touch. “That hurts!”
we have an endgame! (Well, kind of). I still have plans for this fic, bc I don't think Tony's recovery and evolution really ends at them getting together (RELATIONSHIPS DO NOT CURE TRAUMA. YOUR S/O CANNOT FIX YOU, BUT THEY CAN HELP AND SUPPORT YOU.) so there's probably gonna be a relationship evolution right along Tony's story, which will start soon (maybe? i'm woefully scrambled with this) but we're getting there. anyway, toodles, and if you liked it make sure to leave a comment!
"What?” Tony said, righting himself before Steve could even reprimand him for diving headfirst from the back of the couch. “You were saying, Steve?”
The alpha that rubbed his calf rises and maybe she was sitting? That makes him giggle again because a sight they would've made.
If the newcomer responded, Tony didn't hear it. He feels footsteps padding towards him and he turned towards them, taking a deep whiff. Omega. He looks over and sees blue eyes again, but it's
“And you keep calling me pet names and I don’t know what to do and the last few weeks have been wonderful and the best I’ve ever had,” he swallowed, hiccuping, “and sometimes I wish I could just go, it’s not like anybody’d miss me, you’d probably be happier with me gone and you could find a good omega that can follow commands and is skinny and pretty and isn’t
Steve dropped his bag with a thud in the foyer of Tony and his’ apartment wearily. Today had been a long, long day. Over in Brooklyn, there had been a shooting a local elementary school, the kid with the gun shooting three people fatally and several more in the hospital. To top it off, after his spree, the shooter had shot himself, committing suicide. He was a kid. A fifteen-year-old who probably had hopes and dreams and had people who loved him.
Tony’s eyes filled. “Don’t say that. You have, you have a whole life ahead of you. You have a life to live.”
Tony hiccuped and wiped his face, staring at Steve with something hideously unbelieving in his eyes. “I am?” he asked softly. “Really? Me?” He sounded so sweet and so breakable at that moment that Steve felt his own eyes prick. “You really think so?”
“As if I could be anything but,” Steve mumbled, before grabbing a cloth and reaching between Tony’s thighs, trying to get the dried come and slick and probably spit off, considering how Steve had literally eaten Tony out until he was crying. He pressed his face to the crook of Tony’s neck and shoulders, sucking gently on Tony’s scent gland as the omega whimpered a little and twitched. “Sorry.”
Tony snickered. “Well, my legs still feel like jelly,” he swatted at Steve’s cheek as the alpha grinned smugly and satisfied pheromones filled their bathroom. “Stop looking so smug, that’s my thing Freezerburn.”
“Hey, so the media thinks we’re dating.” The man he kept inadvertently bumping into, slipped into Steve's coffee shop booth and nearly startled the living daylights out of him.
“Not allowed, not allowed,” Tony whispers frantically, shaking his head. “Good subs take their punishment without complaining, and I-I, I did, I did bad, so bad, I broke the glass and I can clean it all up, I promise, I’ll take my punishment,” he can feel his voice rising frantically and he tries to control his sobs without erupting into incoherent whimpers and tears as he does to Howard and his teachers. “I’ll be good, I can be a good boy, I can, I promise, just don’t, don’t be mad?” he pleads, and
Tony was reeled into a hug, when the man put his lips to Tony’s ear and murmured, “My name’s Bucky and the blonde is Steve. Just go with it.” He pulled away and stared stonily at Ty, his hand tightening on Tony’swaist when Tony subtly shifted and showed him the bruises on his wrist. Tony was done dealing with this douchebag, and if these two guys were ready to wail on him, he was absolutely okay with that.
“Good boy,” Bucky murmured and grinned when Tony ducked his head a flush rising from his delicate collarbones to his cheeks. Bucky quickly pulled at the box, it falling open at a tug. It was an elaborate fake. Really it was just a kennel for the surprise inside with airholes and space for its contents, but it just looked any ordinary box. And out of the box sprung a little German Shepherd, its ears cocked up and skidding on the slick floors, nails clacking. “Hey little buddy,” Bucky murmured, picking up the puppy and smiling when it licked at his neck. “C’mon, let’s go meet your mama.”
“What did I do wrong?” Tony whispered, feet fidgeting and Steve could hear their soft scuffle against the flooring. “Or, is-is it stress, because I can attend to that alpha--”
Steve beamed and stuck his tongue out at the toddler in the seat next to him, scrunching his nose and widening his eyes comically.
“Yeah, love,” Steve chocked out. “I didn’t--you, so you came from a terrible household, and when we met you had all these expectations, and I thought it was nuts, baby, couldn’t believe it, and I might’ve gone overboard because you’d been out in the cold by everybody so often that it looked like you needed somebody to warm you up, and with that I made you feel less and I’m so so sorry.”
Tony rolled his eyes and ruffled his hair, standing up and stretching as his bones popped. “I know, kiddo. So I’d make you write essays on dumb things. Like English.”
, Steve. I, uh,” Here, Tony hesitated. “I called Sam, and he said you, Bucky, and him went to the movies yesterday. How do you have time for them, but not me?” Tony looked so hurt, and it pained Steve down to his core. He hated seeing anyone upset, really, but seeing Tony’s face wet and flushed red felt like there was a rope around his chest that got tighter with every word. “Do you really not want to spend time with me? Am I that much of a bother?"
Tony shook his hand silently, looking adorably sleep-rumpled in his hoodie and jeans. “I’m Tony,” he said and leaned over to press a kiss to the little boy’s cheek. “And this is Peter. Now what’re you doing?” he asked, glancing meaningfully between Peter and Steve.
Tony eyed him. “Yeah, because I thought we would act like normal people for once and take a plane!” He flapped his arms. “I’m going to be stuck in a car for, like, three days with absolutely nothing to do!”
The alpha's scent is tinged with worry and anger and Tony felt it spike and shrinks down into himself. He wasn't trying to be bad, he was trying so hard, was he not supposed to call his alpha Steve? Good subs do not call their masters by their first name, Tony thinks loosely, remembering the Old Ways protocol that Howard had tried to drill into him. "Sorry," Tony mumbles and tries to roll over. Infractions mean punishment, he knows that. But. He's so tired. And it hurts all over and it feels like his stomach is on fire and something's probably torn up inside him and Tony doesn't know what he wants. "'M sorry, sir."
, Howard’s voice hissed in his ear--and he took Steve’s hand with ease, slipping a newspaper smile onto his face with practiced ease as the reporters scrambled around them, shouting questions as they stepped off the platform. He had forgotten how bad press could be while he was holed up at college, but Steve was clearly a newbie at it and he ducked his head and pressed himself to Steve’s side. The alpha was as stiff as a board and his smile was obviously fake. “Stop looking so uncomfortable,” he mumbled, letting out a breath of relief as their car showed up at the curb to take them to their new home. “The newspapers are gonna eat that up.”
Tony quirked his mouth and looked at him through the hair that fell in front of his eyes anyway. “Mhm.”
“Nobody ever tells me what I do wrong,” Tony whispered out of the blue, and when Steve peeked his head up to look Tony looked ashamed, flushed and lip wobbling. “I’d do better if I c-could, but How-Howard said that I do most things wrong, but I don’t know what I did, and-and he said I’m too loud, and the tutors said I was too clingy, but you won’t tell me what I did wrong and-and-and every time you look at me, you look at me like I’m pitiful, some horrifying little thing that can’t do
hello! so i have a posting schedule (finally) figured, out and y'all can expect a new chapter every wednesday, maybe twice a week if my school stuff gets figured out. also, i got sidetracked with plot, so enjoy this mostly hurt/comfort, kinda short, chappie!
Steve was still frowning slightly but he mostly looked amused. “Nothin’ to be sorry about. It’s nice ta’ know you’ve got good friends, sweetheart,” he smiled comfortably. “I know I wouldn’t be alive if not for Buck.”
“He asked you to leave him alone,” came the voice of his savior. When Tony turned, a tall blonde man was standing at the doorway to the back of the bar, another man, equally broad, right behind him and glowering. The man behind stepped around the blonde, putting a hand on Tony’s back and ging him a one-armed hug.
Tony was, surprisingly, the one who decided that it was about time they left their bed after they had held each other for hours, dozing off and then just cuddling together. “Steve?” he whispered, and the alpha tried to not jump at the sudden voice in his ear.
Tony had made sure to regulate his alcohol consumption, having no more than a glass a wine beforehand and a tumbler of scotch during the toast. He knows better, and he's been doing a lot better since Steve had come into his life and had been there to hold his hand.  He doesn't think he's ever seen Steve smile so bright as when he had come home while Tony was dumping the dozens of bottles of stupidly expensive whiskey, old cans of sour beer, and anything else that might've been in his possession into the sink.
He’s crying now, tears slipping down his cheeks and soaking into the already-scratchy neckline of his nightgown. It’s a matter of time before Steve comes home and he tried to think of the floor and the glass between his fingertips and palms and desperately tries not to lose this fight.
“Oh, come one,” the guy next to him complained as the PA came on again to announce, ‘FLight 454 would be delayed another 3 hours due to weather conditions.’ “It’s like Mother Nature hates us.”
“I have nightmares,” Steve interrupted, staring at a spot on the wall behind Tony’s head. “They ain’t pretty and it was luck that kept ‘em away th’ night in the hotel. I scream and kick, and I’m a supersoldier, Tony,” Tony was surprised to see the shadows lurking in Steve’s eyes and the pain that swam unfiltered. “I don’t want ta’ hurt ya, so we should probably sleep in different bedrooms. There’s--”
Because he’s not, oh God, Steve isn’t alive, and Tony shakes, puts his head in his hands and sobs, doesn’t bother holding back, he couldn’t even if he wanted to because there is nothing that could stop this, this tidal wave of agony, the explosion of emotion. Steve is dead, his Steve, his imprint, the man he loved more than life itself, the man he would kill for, murder for, do anything for, he’s gone, gone, gone and it’s his fault because he trusted Gus, he imprinted, he forced Steve out on a search for an imaginary cure, if none of that had happened, none of it, if he had been careful, if he had been wise and not so goddamn selfish then Steve would be alive.
"Or," he says conversationally as he forces his length down Tony's throat "I could have you plugged. Plugged, and set to vibrate. What else do you love? God, those panties we saw last week. You'd be wearing them. Naked, apart from the plug and underwear, and I'd make you work like that. Answer calls like that. Imagine trying to keep a straight voice when someone's down the line. Imagine what I would do to you if you came without my permission."
That makes sense. Tony can’t move, anyway, he’s so tired. Pierce rolls him over, starts on the buttons of his shirt. Tony’s eyes are shut. His jaw is slack. When Piece touches the clasp of his pants, he panics, tries to lift his head, and is greeted with a wrist, proffered under his nose. Pierce scents calm, and safe. Tony is calm and safe. He falls back against the pillows.
He feels himself listing to the side and he pushes out his hand to support himself. Shoddy service, he thinks. Who leaves their concussed patient alone in a -- in a --
He shuts his eyes. One of Steve’s hands are resting on his thigh, holding him; the other is leaving his hair, tracing a very light line down his cheek, to his chin; tipping it left and right. “Are you drunk?” He asks.
Steve wishes he could do that, that he could be so casual with his touches. But he knows that Natasha, for all the trouble she caused Tony, was always on his side. That she saw Tony’s view in a way that Steve never could. And so Tony doesn’t appear to mind so much when she holds the straw to his lips and lets him drink. She removes two candy bars from her pocket, and Steve recognises them as that high-calorie junk that they used to feed the undernourished children on his peace missions to Cambodia. Natasha leaves them surreptitiously on the bed and exits smoothly; Steve envies her this, her ability to interact with Tony and her freedom to come and go without fear of consequence.
“I didn’t realise you were catholic,” Sarah says, with just a hint of hidden happiness. It hadn’t occurred to Tony that religion was something she cared for.
Tony realises he’s been rubbing at his throat, where the burnt, mottled skin used to be. “I don’t know what kind of relationship you think we have. We haven’t – I’ve barely seen him in months.”
He thinks Nick isn’t so strong these days either. He didn’t die, obviously; but the crash must have taken something out of him. He’s favouring his left side.
But it does feel good, to be thrumming with pleasure beneath the hands of someone who’s wings are broad enough to cloak him. Keep him safe.
Steve’s thumbs press warningly. “No. But in this world, we’ve signed a contract. A proper contract, old-fashioned. I’m leasing you for, I don’t know, six months, a year. And you’ve agreed to it, because you know it’s good for you. You want to be taken care of, and you want to be taken out of your head.”
“Yeah, well…” he trails off. He’s cold, he realises suddenly. The shirt is too thin, and he hasn’t got a coat.
Back in the good days, Steve and Tony had once taken a vacation. Not a long one, seven days in a villa in Italy.
He’s in a rubber room. It’s not like the movies. Tony thinks he’s been put in one of these before, the soft walls and floor, like a kid’s playpen, but memory of that time is hazy. Here, the walls aren’t white, but they’re coloured a calming light blue, the floor slightly darker, and there are windows lining the top where they can’t be reached, letting in natural light.
“Well?” Tony asks him. He blinks slowly, enough that when he opens his eyes again, everything has gone traitorously soft and blurry at the edges. Before Steve, no one could do this to him. Except his father. And even then, only when he was small, before his wings grew to eclipse his old man’s, and pretty much everyone else’s. Oh, before. Before, before, before. What’s the fucking point.
“That’s for me to know. You’re just a working piece, Tony. Do this for me, and I’ll make sure this file meets the shredder.”
Tony accepts this. It isn’t so bad, not having the words. It’s not like people listen to him anyway.
to, and I failed. I see your face every night, before I sleep. It ruined me, Tony. When I say, you can’t help me – you can’t. There are some things that are an alpha’s burden.”
“In which case, it’s important you don’t let him skimp on therapy. Physiotherapy, I mean. There’s nerve damage, you know, in his hands? He’ll need patience on that front. And of course,” the doctor lowers his voice slightly “there’s the matter of covering the cost of his treatment? You understand, we acted on good faith because Mr Stark was never one to default on his debts, but since the assets were seized…”
"You know what it's like?" Tony says quietly "Do you know what it's like to, to crawl for a guy who won't tell you his secrets?"
“It was – weird,” he agrees, slowly. “When you went to DC, like that. I don’t know – I don’t know what I did wrong.”
It’s good to get out of his dress-clothes, pull on one’s of Steve gratuitously over-sized sweaters. It falls to mid-thigh, the arms too long to be practical, but it’s comforting to hide his hands, smothered in fabric. Pierce’s coat is discarded; Tony pulls the collar over his nose and inhales
When the omega looked back up, Steve was sitting forward curiously. “You build?” He said and Tony flinched, ducking his head to block Steve’s view of the tears that would probably come when Steve started shouting. He was pathetic. Twenty-two years of being shouted at, and he still started to cry as soon as the voice came. They were in a private compartment if Steve cared, so their shouting would be muffled, but considering how revered Captain America was after his win over the Red Skull and the Nazis, Tony knew that not many would care about him shouting.
Tony hesitated and began to pull back to eye him. Steve tried to keep his face as impassive as he could as Tony studied him. “Lil’ bit,” he admitted quietly. “But I can hear your stomach growling.”
“Do you love me?” Steve wasn’t going to beat around the bush. They had confessed their love for each other weeks ago, and he knew that where Tony was going came out of fear and trepidation of Tony’s buried desire to be accepted and fear of being a disappointment. They were on opposing kingdoms, yes, but love triumphed petty grudges did it not?
Steve sighed and sat back as each of them babbled questions on top of each other. “Will all of you calm down? It’s not like I told you something life or death.”
He’d do anything, give one of his limbs, maybe all of them, just to be able to go one day without being bad.
Bucky snorted but didn’t say anything. This was an argument they’d had many a time. “Here,” he said instead, unwrapping his hand from Tony’s waist. “Just wait here.”
Steve sat in silence and flipped through the sports section from the newspaper, where it sat on the table from that morning when Steve had tossed it on the table after breakfast. “Baby?” he said softly as Tony stood stoutly facing the stove. The easy warm atmosphere from before was gone, and Tony stood rigid. With his enhanced hearing, Steve could even hear Tony’s hand shaking as his grip on the spoon made it clank against the pan. “You okay?”
Tony nodded his head. “Yeah. My best friend, Rhodey, knows about this.” Sam perked up at the sound of Rhodey.
“Bad,” he whimpers. He wants so badly for Steve to not be lying, but he knows what alphas are like. He’s not stupid, he learns from his mistakes and he won’t expect any dom to be lenient. “I was so bad, I didn’t mean to be, I promise!”
Tony swore he had just turned around for a second, but by the time he had turned around from getting his drink, Maggie was gone, lost in the crowd.
,” and maybe it was selfish, but Tony was alright with being selfish if it kept Steve safe and loved by his side.
“Don’ need ta’ call me sir,” Steve whispered, already dreading what Tony had to say. “But sure babydoll.”
Tony shrugged. “Feels like I’m losing it. After all,” he leered up at Steve. “I was screaming last night.”
The door opens with a click and he hears Steve’s called out, “Tony?’ before hearing his footsteps approaching behind him and a little gasp. He supposes he makes a sight, blood dripping down his palms and scratches all over his legs. “What?”
He could wait till his sweet thing was ready. Until then, he’d just court his mate the way he deserved.
, he can one day be able to walk through a room without worrying that he was being too loud, or drop a glass and not collapse to tears.
“How far along?” Tony startled and turned around, one hand on his belly to face a pretty brunette with -- surprising enough -- a metal arm that was rubbing over his own belly.
, worthless. NO wonder nobody’s come for you yet, imagine that they’d be happy to finally get rid of you.”
“We just got married, Steve.” Tony turned to look at him and Steve was horrified to see tears glittering in his eyes, reflecting proof of the grey eyed one’s blessing, even as they shone with sadness. “We just got married. I’m not with child, thank Zeus for that, and you are about to go off to fight someone else’s war in someone else’s land for someone else’s wife.”
Bucky ducked his head, a blush going up to his stupidly nice cheekbones. Not that Tony was staring. He wasn’t. It was just that Bucky was shaped very nicely, and had a drool-worthy metal arm, and an ass that wouldn’t quit. It would just be rude to not look.
Steve smiled at him again. “It was no problem. He’s adorable.” Steve smiled at the boy and waggled his fingers. “Hiya, Peter.”
.” He looked at him, though everything seemed fuzzy. He counts the particles of dust, he counts the freckles on the alpha’s face, and then oh--
Tony sat up and grinned as Bucky blushed again. “That was way too enthusiastic,” he whispered mortified. “But I’d love to.”
Tony shook his hand silently, looking adorably sleep-rumpled in his hoodie and jeans. “I’m Tony,” he said and leaned over to press a kiss to the little boy’s cheek. “And this is Peter. Now what’re you doing?” he asked, glancing meaningfully between Peter and Steve.
He heard footsteps and the door opening with a click as Tony walked in sometime in and wrapped his arms around Steve’s slim waist. “Hurgh,” he mumbled against Steve’s back.
“He was just a kid,” murmured Steve, choking back the lump in his throat and the tears that threatened to fall for the second time that day. “Younger than we were when we met.”
Tony leaned in, “Tell me if you want me to stop,” he murmured. “But I’d like you to know this is because I want this, and not because I think you do.” He brushed his lips hesitantly over Steve’s and he--snapped.
Tony leaned his head on the window, relishing the cold and the slight bumps as the train carried him farther away from home. Really, he wasn’t going that far, just an hour by train, and if they got the service they got that morning, it would be even less.
, his suitcase is awful small -- and digs through the case for something for bed. Everything is something sheer and tiny, and probably not at all comfortable from the way it feels in his hands, and even in their fantastically rich hotel room, it’s still chilly. “Fuck,” he breathes, sitting back. His family, his mother and father, the people who are to care for and nurture the little omega haven’t even left him something comfortable to wear and the alpha swallows the anger in him, the instinct to hurt and protect whoever had harmed
Steve smiled into the kiss. “All yours,” he mumbled, before pulling away to wrinkle his nose. “Also your breath stinks.”
“I’m not mad,” and weirdly enough Steve sounds earnest. “I’m not mad, babydoll, it was just an accident. I’m just worried that you’re hurt sugar, I don’ want ya to be hurt, sweetheart, and I’m not gonna punish you, not ever for an accident.”
Steve smiles, helplessly fond, dragging his hands over Tony’s waist and helping him step out of the dress. “Captain is so proud of you,” he praises and he can feel Tony practically lighting up underneath him, looking up at him with so so grateful eyes, just happy to be touched without intent to harm and few words of praise. Christ, he can’t imagine what Tony’s life has been like if Tony was expecting him to hit him and hurt him and fucking
Tony nodded and leaned into Steve’s side. “Yeah,” he said quietly. “He’s the best thing that’s ever happened to me.”
Bucky grinned and strode over, putting the puppy into Tony's waiting arms. “Just like you,” he said, laughing when Tony swatted at him.
Steve sat back and cocked an eyebrow. “I don’t believe you,” he said finally after a few moments of just studying him.

And by the time they were disembarked and on the shuttle, Steve had a date with one adorable single-dad and his son.
“Thanks, I’m really feeling the love,” Clint complained, deliberately missing Tony’s suit and making the brunette chuckle.
“Sorry,” he whispered, flinching, and then cringing all over again because he wasn’t supposed to do that--
“But he’s so cute,” Tony whined and kept petting Dodger, scratching behind his ears. “Aren’t you boy? Yes, yes you are!” he crooned in a baby voice, and wow, this was a side of the seemingly callous boy that Steve hadn’t seen.
“Anyway, the mission was supposed to be for a week, but it's been nearly two, and I’ve just been really stressed out.”
“Fuck!” Steve yelped, fumbling for his book that had tumbled down from the force of his surprise. “You made me lose my page!” Steve scowled, dropping the book on his lap. “What do you want?"
