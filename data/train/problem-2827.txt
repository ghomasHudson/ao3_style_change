It is his piercing blue eyes and the sadness that shines within them that bring Dean's entire world to a halt.
"Merry Christmas, Charlie."
"I'm glad you have someone to come home to."
Cas is on the edge of the bed, ready to close the distance between them, to hold Dean tight and tell him however often he needs to hear it that it's okay to not be ready to come out, that he should wait until he feels safe enough to uncover that part of himself for the world to see; but Dean beats him to it, falling to his knees in front of Cas, wrapping his arms around Cas' waist and pressing his cheek against his stomach.
It's the middle of the night, people are beginning to leave, and Dean sits unmoving on the couch with his heart so full, it should be bursting.
"Hello," he says wearily.
"Cas, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry," he repeats over and over again and now his voice is trembling too and he is still crying and it breaks Cas' heart to see him like that.
"I'm not some kind of alcoholic or anything. Or stalker or something."
"Because," Dean said, shutting the oven door with a lot more force than necessary, "it is just another day and I don't want you to make a big deal out of it and don't tell me you won't."
Blue eyes were trained on him unblinkingly and Dean could feel a blush heating up his face.
Charlie wordlessly holds up her hand and Dean high-fives her on his way out, leaving a flustered Cas and a laughing Meg behind.
"High praise from the devil," Dean snorts, "But to be honest, I occasionally do."
Perfect until Dean realizes what's happening and abruptly pulls away.
"He told you today?," Sam asks and he doesn't sound triumphant or apologetic or amused like Dean expected him to. He sounds done like he does when Dean gets on his nerves or when Cas acts even stranger than usual and Dean doesn't know what to make of that.
“Charlie and I each have 5 free passes for cancelling on each other.”
He is still smiling, but his eyelids are drooping, and he looks like he's about to pass out.
It should not be possible to miss someone after such a short time together and such a long time apart.
He rubs the back of his neck and still doesn't look at Cas.
Dean's back is turned towards the man who's gun is aimed at him.
Cas is gonna have one hell of a hangover and probably won't remember any of this tomorrow.
“It’s you, you idiot. Who else would it be?”
It was not entirely unexpected, since they are both not really the type for movie nights, but it still hurt a little to know that they prefer to spend their time elsewhere.
"This heat wave really is taking a toll on brain cells, people," she claims, shaking her head.
"You don't deserve to be treated like some dirty little secret. We are not … This," he gestures between them, "is not a bad thing, nothing to be ashamed of. I know that. Please believe me, when I say 'I know that'."
"Of course, man. Take your time."
If he had really spent eleven years in blissful obliviousness, what changed?
They sit in silence after that. Cas is looking at the sky again. The clouds have broken, the stars are finally visible and not for the first time is Cas enchanted by their infinity.
It is hard to concentrate, because the weird tension lingers and Cas can tell that Dean's mind is somewhere else.
The universe was on his side; for the first time in his life, he was sure of it.
"I would like to eat here."
If Dean didn't want to tell Cas, then that was his decision, and Cas had to accept that. That did not mean he had to like it.
He shot Castiel a sideways glance.
When he opens his eyes again, Dean watches him from a few steps ahead with an unbearably soft expression on his face.
"New Year's Resolution: Quit whining and shut the hell up."
"What am I doing here? You're the one who broke into my apartment."
"It's not fair, Cas. Why do they get to have that and we don't? Still don't, after so many people spent so many years fighting for us to have it, gave their lives for us to have it."
This was a terrible idea.
If he ever wanted proof that he's a horrible person, now he has it.
He clings to the memories like a drowning man to a life raft, wondering if in reality they are an anchor pulling him under.
His heart is racing like its being chased by the devil himself and maybe it is. Maybe death is reaching for him and hell already made its claim.
Sam is laughing now, but he doesn't sound amused.
The first page is empty.
"It was supposed to be me. It was supposed to be me. Why didn't you let it be me?," Dean is frantic and desperate and he doesn't understand. Cas can tell he doesn't and it breaks his heart all over again.
“Just get in the car.” Dean sighs and once they are all in, he starts the engine and drives towards the highway and then follows some road signs towards the tree farm that he had found last night that was just a couple of hours away from them.
The Other Side by The Greatest Showman Cast.
“Angels and ministers of grace, defend us...” Jimmy starts to say as he stays near the door.

have for him, the things that I'm not allowed to utter out loud. Maybe
“It must have been about...4:15. I remember that the radio said it was 4:10 when I was parking.”
“Time for bed, kiddo.” He said when it was almost 9:30. Ben nodded and went upstairs to his room; he used the bathroom to change and wash his teeth before laying down. “Wait, I need Mr. Cuddles!”
“Don´t you think is a bit too tall for the bunker?” Cas looks at the tree unsure of how they will be able to take it to the bunker although it's nice to see Dean smiling so carefree.
He closes his eyes and thinks about Ben and that helps him gain the courage to drive down the ramp towards the highway, he prays he can make it and that Sam won´t have to pick where he left off.
He took out his badge and showed it to him. “Agent Novak, I´m from the FBI.”
After what feels like ages he manages to arrive at the locker room. He looks at the ticket and stars looking for the right aisle. He finds it at the end and then looks for the number 1. He opens it and finds a shoebox, he shakes it and hears something. He sends a text yo his brother saying he will meet at his place since his house must still have someone watching his house.
Castiel wanted to tell the other guy that it was obvious his experience wasn't working out but he didn't want to get in trouble. “ I came here to find the killer and that's exactly what I'm gonna do - with or without your help.”
8:31 a.m
“No, We can´t lose time, man. I need to go and get to the bottom of this. If I don´t get back here in 24 hours then yeah, you can talk to someone but for now, I need to know you will help me.”
“Aww Sammy, you wound me!” He said dramatically and chuckles when the other just rolls his eyes. “What? Can´t I see my boyfriend during the holidays?”
1.904 inches of rain.
“Yeah, like what?” Dean sat next to him on the floor.
He nods and walks into the room once Lilith opens the door. He leaves the money on the table and looks up in time for Lilith to set an alarm and moved to the bed. He stands next to the bed.
For...
Kick off Meeting
The bear
Jake gets in the back seat next to Castiel. “Have you ever done this before?”
Uriel rolls his eyes and walks towards the door before he kicks at it. “There is now.”
Castiel looks at the conference room and decides to stay and watch for a little while, he stands near the door so he can leave without anyone else noticing. He sees that there is a lot of reporters from local news but he can also see a small bunch from nationwide news. The captain walks into the room and starts the press conference and then mentions the name of the kid that had been found and that it had been found in a wasteland in the East End at around 6:30 a.m, five days after he was reported missing. There had been an autopsy but it wasn´t done yet so he would give more details the next day but it would seem that he drowned. That the police were working around the clock to find the murderer as soon as possible and if anyone got any questions. At that Castiel made his way to back to the receptionist, as he was leaving he heard a reporter ask about the profiler from the FBI, he didn't hear the answer.
Chapter 2- Sleazy Place
He sighs and stands up. He looks to the other side of the room and notices a hallway, he follows it until he sees a door, without hesitation, he opens it to see a bedroom with a bed and a crib, next to the wardrobe there is another door. He goes to open it. “Mrs. Kline! Are you there?”
then that I return the little phrase -the one that means so much-
It was now December in Kansas and the town was being decorated with different lights and ornaments to celebrate the holidays. The main street was cleaned each morning to stop the snow from interrupting the traffic even if it was a small town, people still need to move from one place to the other or in some cases drive to another town for work.
“You are not driving, Dean.” Sam walks with him to the door.
3:15 PM
“That's me, welcome to this shit-hole, hope you brought your umbrella.” He frowns and looks at one of the nearby cops. “Can you do something about the bulldozer? I cant hear my own thoughts!”
This one was a bit difficult to write.
“Agent Novak, this should come in handy, We call it ARI which is the acronym of added reality interface, they are state of the art and will help you investigate scenes and analyze evidence in an efficient way.” Hannah, his boss had told him as she had given him a small box. “But I must warn you that we have reports from other agents that have suffered some side effects when they have used the equipment for a prolonged period of time. So try to use it only for crimes where we don't have a lot of visual clues and NOT for trivial situations.”
Dean had been the one to go out and get them an artificial tree from one of the local thrift stores and Sam had located a few boxes with Christmas ornaments. They had spent the afternoon trying to decorate it as best as they could and with the limited supplies they had.
relationship sits at. From casual lovers to adoring partners. But
The man nods and asks him to follow him to the desk. He types a few words and smiles at Dean. “I thought you weren't going to pick her up, that car has been here for over a month.” He turns to grab the keys. “We checked the tires and the engine as you asked or well your friend said and we have been waiting for you or him to pick it up. It´s on the third floor down. Just take the elevator.” He points to the back.
“Me too, Ben..” Dean rubs his arm and tries to smile at him. “Me too.”
with his head in my lap -while he insists on attempting to memorise
Gadreel looks at her and before leaving he drops his card on the table and tells her to call him in case she remembers anything, no matter how unimportant it seems. After that, he leaves the motel room and goes to the hallway. On his way out he sees a man wearing a tank top who goes to the room he just left, he thinks its a client and continues to the stairs.
“The more clues we get, the more we can reduce the zone. We can then cross-check it with our list of suspects and identify the killer.”
Dean nods thinking about that, he and Cas were good but he still has a bit of trouble showing affection outside of their room.
Jack looks at the rest of the things in the market and is a bit confused as to why they have angels wearing dresses, he decides to ask Sam about it later. He keeps looking and finds some that are about candy so he buys them with the money he has saved.
Castiel steps back. “I´m here to arrest a serial killer. With all due respect, Captain, the rest, it´s none of my business, I do my job and you do yours.”
way over to where I stand.
Dean laughs remembering a drunk promise that he would teach Cas how to dance. “No, stand up.”
“That… they were giving them in the parking lot, they said is a festival where you can buy decorations and also there are competitions like building snowmen and snowball fights… and something about a skating rink.”
Sam blushed a bit at that. “You never ask for an invitation.”
He reaches for a glass of water before he actually answers. “I feel like I´m dead as if when Emma died, I did too... When that car showed up from nowhere and ran into us…”
We get an introduction to another character and know what happened to Dean after the last chapter.
He was pretty excited about they actually have the chance to celebrate Christmas this year and he wanted to make it special not only for Jack but also for his brother and Cas.
Dean sighs and nods as he rubs his neck, he had messed up a bit but he was sure he could make up for it. He looks up when he hears thunder. “Ben, I think we should go since it´s going to rain soon.”
“For the moment, about ten square miles.”Castiel sighs since he knows that's a lot of ground to cover.
“No!, Sammy, you don´t understand, I need to do this without them, they won´t believe me, might even think I kidnapped Ben… No! I will continue with this, I have one down and four more to go. I´m sure when I get the last clue, I will find Ben and then only then we call the police, okay?”
Later that day, Castiel and Uriel made their way to the place where the first suspect was. It was in a bad zone. Castiel sighs as he stops at the apartment door and knocks a couple of times. “No answer. We've wasted our time coming here.”
Sam parks at Dean´s place and notices that the lights are off. He opens the door and walks in calling his brother, Gabriel close behind him. He walks into the living room and sees his brother. “Dean! What happened?”
While Gadreel is doing his best to cover the wounds, Kelly starts to come around and looks at him. She stays on the bed and flinches a bit when he touches the wound. After a few minutes, Gadreel has the wounds as secure as he can and he sees that the left one is bleeding less from the stains on the fabric.
“I want to do that too but as Dean said, it's dangerous now. We can´t just go and say we got the letter. I think we should do some research with the others… I don´t think Dean is the only father that got this box with the clues. But it's weird that none of the others said anything about this or the news never mention that…”
As he waits for Donna to finish a phone call he notices a watch. “Nice watch.”
Zachariah nods. “Then what´s next?”
Lilith shakes his head. “He is an ex-client who thinks he owns me, last time I had to call the cops. Thanks and…take care.”
Gadreel nods. “I have lost someone too and I know how hard it can be…Henry” he adds having seen his tag with his name.
She shakes her head. “I´d like a room”
“His name is Jack,” Kelly said from her position on the bed. “Do you know what to do?”
“Wait… Do you think the Origami Killer...” Dean starts to say remembering the news.
“Please just…. Help me to my room. It´s 207” The strange man says as he tries to stand up.
“Well Kelly, just look after yourself and Jack.”
He stops at the door and turns to look at her. “I don´t exactly feel lucky, doc.” With that, he leaves and makes his next appointment.
“What would Jessica think if she saw you?” Gadreel takes a step in his direction. “Ask your self, what would happen to her if things went wrong?” he slowly walks and stops near him. “I want you to slowly lower your gun and put it away and leave, I´m sure my friend and I will forget about what just happen and you will have earned a second chance no to fuck up your life. What do you say?”
Dean and Castiel had kept walking and they were near the end of the raw where Dean finally had found a tree, he dimmed worthy to be in the bunker and also tall enough to fit in the main room.
Song # 54
Castiel nods and looks at him and maybe it was the alcohol or simply the idea that Dean might never come back but he got some courage. “You will owe me a dance.”
His son looks at the bag and frowns before looking at him. “I hate strawberry. But I can eat it, thanks.”
Dean finished his song. “Thanks, everyone!”
Pamela as if sensing his distress looks at him. “Don´t worry this doesn't have a grade.” She grabs a piece of paper and shows it to him.
“I must have some bruises… nothing fatal, just sore as hell. I swear it looks worst than it is.” Dean whispers as he drags his feet into the room.
Balthazar watched the exchange with an amused look, his friend looked like something apart from the vegetables had caught his
Gadreel nods and leaves the room, he goes to his car and makes a few notes on his notepad before he drives to his apartment. He leaves his coat on the couch near the window and then goes to his kitchen to eat something before calling it a day.
“Here. I was here, I was praying - all day.” Jimmy walks towards the altar and points at it.
“Sure. Wait here.” He goes to the stand and looks at the options and grabs a package of strawberry gummy bears, he paid for it and then went back to sit with Ben. “Here, kiddo.”
Though sometimes a kiss fails to change the world. What if it doesn't
The story will be a bit slow this few chapters since I´m introducing the characters but I think after chapter 5 things will start getting interested. I will try to update every week.
Chapter 3- CRIME SCENE
Cas is about to shoot his resolution not to pry into the wind, when Dean finally turns around to face him.
It starts snowing seconds before their lips meet.
He does not know how many times Dean has caught him staring from across the hallway.
They did not part on bad terms last time, but they are not exactly friends either, and Cas has no idea how he is supposed to greet Dean. The other man doesn't seem to share his hesitation as he spreads his arms like he's expecting a hug.
Wounds heal, scars fade, but only if you let them.
So he carefully approaches the boy, who is almost asleep.
the guy says,
Dean behaves in a way Cas has seen him be a hundred times.
Most of his friends have good reasons for not being here, Cas knows that and he knows it's not their fault, but it still hurts.
They are polar opposites.
At war, every single minute could be your last.
As if Dean is going to refuse him anything.
"I meant it when I said I wanted to get along from now on," he says, congratulating himself for stringing together an entire sentence.
Of all the things he expected her to say, this is most certainly not it.
Cas doubts that he'll be able to eat anything until whatever is going on is settled, so he simply shakes his head. A nod is his only answer and then Dean's making his way upstairs like everything is fine, leaving a bewildered Castiel behind.
God his eyes are blue.
While the woman in question looks like Christmas came early this year, it suddenly dawns on Cas that Dean probably said what he said, because he did not want to outright say that he doesn't want to go with Cas.
"If you want to."
A man with whom he is going to spend an undefined amount of time in the car with.
"Okay," he said, slowly letting out a breath, "this is fine."
His hands tighten around the steering wheel and he's going way faster than the speed limit would allow, but he doesn't care.
How could he after everything Dean has done to him?
“I know, it’s a blessing and a curse,” Cas says, seeing his chance to finally contribute to the conversation.
Maybe it was time to go apartment hunting again.
Their exchanges that night had been limited, but they were enough to intrigue Cas, making him want to know everything about the fascinating man that is Dean Winchester.
Dean is angry and Cas doesn't know why.
Staring at the screen of his computer, Cas unsuccessfully tries to focus on the numbers in front of him.
His oh so blue eyes are watching him and Dean smiles at Cas, because how could he not.
Thankfully, he is not in the classroom yet, nobody is, it’s blessedly empty, giving Cas the opportunity to make plans on how to proceed further in his search for the poet.
Dean without ever receiving so much as a simple "thank you".
Now that Dean’s laughter has faded, an awkward silence threatens to settle after that last comment.
She hugs Dean and punches Cas' shoulder as a goodbye and just like that, she's gone, leaving a flustered Cas and a silent Dean behind.
"You are sooo pretty," Cas tells him with the blatant honesty only drunk people and children can get away with.
There is nothing either one of them can do about it and the silence between them reminds Dean once again that they do not know each other. That he is holding a stranger's hand in a coffee shop and that they probably won't see each other again once Cas decides it is time to leave. It is a weird thought. With all the awkwardness going on on Dean's part, he doubts that Castiel feels drawn to him in the same way he does. This isn't a hallmark Christmas movie.
"I meant Meg and Balthazar."
He pictures to be back.
"It's fine. I know how important your job is and there's only half an hour left of your shift. We'll be together soon enough. Now get off the phone," he chides gently, "and back to work. Dinner will be ready when you get home."
"You are amazing," Dean whispers and for a moment his eyes flicker to Cas' lips, "You are kind and passionate and incredibly smart and I wish I'd had the courage to talk to you sooner. I mean really talk to you. Back when we were in school I chickened out every time I tried."
So if Cas is the one to say it out loud, then that's fine. Because the way Dean's face lights up and his eyes and smile become unbearably soft every time he hears Cas say the words tells Cas all he needs to know.
The guy could've just given him a weird look, ordered his coffee and been on his merry way, instead of being completely unresponsive.
"It's fine, Dean," he begins and talks right over Dean's scoff of disbelief, "sometimes it's easiest to talk to people who are not that involved in our lives. I know it’s sometimes hard to remember, but you don't have to worry about failing or not being good enough, because you are. You are enough.
The thought made him chuckle, which then turned into laughter until he had to lean against a lamppost for support and was gasping for air.
"Sorry, you don't have to tell me, of course. I was just trying to make conversation and I mean, it's not like it's a grave question, because really you can just answer with yes or no, so it's not a big deal, but you seem kinda sad, so maybe it is for you and I didn't mean to overstep or bring back bad memories or anything and ...,"
"I'm aware of what I'm doing, Dean," Cas protests, but he's blinking rapidly as if he's about to fall asleep again, and his words are still not as clear as Dean would need them to be to believe him.
"You were the fumbling idiot? I could barely get a word out whenever you were close to me and as soon as you walked away I beat myself up about all the things I could've said to you. Would've said to you if only I had been a little braver."
Whoever it belongs to has to be bright and honest and complex and beautiful.
"Oh," Cas says very slowly. He is slurring the words a bit, making his intoxicated state even more obvious.
The other man is only a few steps ahead of him, close enough for Cas to call after him.
Maybe this is how it ends.
Dean does not dare to move because he knows the bubble will burst as soon as he does so much as breathe too hard.
"I know, I know. The two are literally the sweetest human beings on this planet and believe me when I tell you that I feel like shit and you're allowed to think I am a terrible person, but I got so angry when I saw them."
He can't bring himself to look at Cas, does not want to see his pitying smile, so he trains his eyes on the floor and speaks to Cas' feet instead. He feels sick.
Belatedly he realizes that Cas is still waiting for an answer, so he clears his throat and smiles awkwardly.
They are probably just in the kitchen, getting Castiel some water, but he doesn't want to leave him alone as long as he doesn't know for sure.
"Yes ... no ... well, I do remember you."
Knows that his feelings make no sense and that even if he decides to pour his heart into the gift and Castiel rejects him, he'll live, but that doesn't make it less scary.
It's not a choice at all.
"I would've deserved it. I was picking up some stupid stupid necklace, because I wanted to keep a stupid promise and because I couldn't be smart just once. It should have been me. Why wouldn't you let it be me?"
"Charlie called to fill me in on the whole thing with Gilda but she did not answer any of my messages after that so I couldn't get your number to ask if it was okay for me to show up here without her since you know, we don't really know each other and all that and you probably don't even remember me …"
Dean cries harder and Cas wonders what it is about him being wounded that brings this strong unbreakable man to fall apart like this.
He probably thought he'd say the words, Dean would stare at him for a second, then call him out on it and then Cas would tell him that he found out about Dean's feelings, but unfortunately (and to no one's surprise) did not feel the same way, even though he very much valued Dean as a friend.
"I told Sam about my plan and that I was not sure how you'd react and that I was afraid you would get angry. I am aware of your temper so I consulted your brother, since he knows you best. He told me to "go for it" and so I did. Of course I now see that I should have tried a different approach."
By now Dean is looking a little choked up and Cas' smiles nervously wondering if his speech was too much. Apparently he still doesn’t really know how to talk to people when this is what he deems appropriate for a party conversation.
Cas and the blue eyed boy from the poems have nothing in common but the color of their eyes and hair and Dean is simply not the type to write poems and even if he did, he would not write them about Castiel.
Thankfully the end of the queue saves Dean from having to come up with an excuse and he mockingly bows before Charlie.
Only when they're in the parking lot by his baby, he slows down and glares at Charlie.
Instead her eyes are glued to the glass of water on her desk like she seriously considers pouring it all over herself.
After everything Cas has done
"There is nothing to be sorry about," he whispers, "We are not the ones at fault."
It's Halloween, November is approaching with lightning speed - technically it's already there - and that means the next weeks are probably gonna be hell, but right now, in this very moment, all Dean feels is happiness.
He cannot finish the sentence.
"What's up, Sammy?," he asks, trying to sound as casual as possible.
"Very," Dean grinned, wrapping both hands around his drink, before snuggling back into the pillows.
Dean stumbled back. “Wait—”
He sent her the video he’d just sent Sam and Eileen.
“Well by my count, the last time you bragged about getting laid was couple months ago when those two bikers came into town—what were their names again?”
Because I, I swear,
“Wonderful, Billie, yes. And some cultures still keep that tradition alive, though it is mostly lost in our society today. But it is not gone.
Cas lifted his wrist, displaying the ice bag, half melted. Dean put down the mugs and went off to make up a new bag. “There were lots of rules,” acknowledged Cas, loud enough that Dean could hear him over the ice being scooped together. “No fraternizing with the artists. Though the artists could fraternize with each other, if they were both under contract with Garrison. But they couldn’t have kids, under a certain age. That was the biggest one.”
The storm had come. Dean sighed and tucked the knife back into its sheath, which he’d wedged under the mattress. He clutched his side belatedly, bruise complaining loudly about the sudden movement. It was dark in the cabin, but he couldn’t tell if it was because of the storm or the hour. He blinked a couple of times, trying to spot the glowing red numbers of the alarm clock, but another flash of lightning proved that the clock was there, but blank. He reached over and turned the switch on the lamp: nothing.
Dean reined himself in, closing his eyes and taking in a deep breath, blowing on the exhale. “Fine,” he bit out. He looked back at his brother, plastering on what even Cas could see was a fake little smile. “Why did you invite him here?”
Dean slammed his beer on the table and whipped his head to glare at Sam. “Is that true?”
“Evidence,” she said soberly, and handed the phone to Victor without another word.
He didn’t have to wait long for a response.
The Pit was full of engineers and mechanics and painters and bike experts of all kinds. Men and women worked in close quarters without much room to create their frankensteined masterpieces, often in nothing but tanks and jeans in the heavy air, tattoos wrapped around their arms and dotting their necks. A large garage door stayed open in good weather for ease of bike transport and to let in a fresh breeze, but it didn’t do much to cut through the heat or the stink of metal and oil and gasoline. The Pit was dark, too, sparks spraying in arcs as welders went about their jobs, flashing orange against the walls. More than anything else, though, the Pit was loud: tools buzzed, music pumped through speakers, engines revved, people shouted to be heard above it all. It was large operation with a lot of moving parts, but given that there was a Harley plant just down the road, there was never a shortage of bikes to steal, or talent to poach. Of course, there were few like Dean who’d stumbled into the Pit and never crawled back out if it. Despite that, somehow, he’d become a favorite of Alastair’s.
Reacting on instinct, he rips open their large kitchen cabinet and yanks out the fire extinguisher, silently thanking Dean's profession-induced cautiousness.
They walk beside each other in silence which is not unusual for them, but something about it doesn't sit right with Cas and by the time they arrive at Dean's house, his stomach is in knots. He tries to come up with something, anything to break the silence between them, but Dean simply unlocks the front door and just like that he's out of reach again.
He can tell, because Dean's fingers are curled into fists and the unhappy scowl hasn't left his face since they walked out of the class room.
Not to forget about Dean’s crush on this literal angel Cas has yet to get to know.
The ridiculousness of both the situation and the idea that Cas could have wanted to kiss him bring tears to his eyes, and he laughs until his stomach hurts.
They have the house to themselves which is not unusual either since John Winchester is rarely ever home and Sam tries to spend as little time there as possible. Cas knows he is at soccer practice right now, but he finds himself longing for the younger Winchester's presence which never fails to lighten Dean's mood. Sam is also much better at calling Dean out for his bullshit than Cas is. Sometimes it's like the two brother speak a language no one else understands and even though Cas sometimes feels left out because of it, right now he could really use a someone who is fluent in Winchester, because Dean's behavior is worrying him.
The boys seem to know each other, but they are not very close.
"Well dear, if you can't stand the heat, get out of hell," Rowena quips from next to Cas and not for the first time today he wonders what kind of witchcraft is responsible for her being completely unaffected by the inhuman temperatures.
"I'll tell you what I want, Cas," Dean said, "On that particular day, like any other goddamn day of the year, I wanna go to class, go to work, and go home where I make dinner for us and then sit on the couch watching Star Wars or Dr. Sexy or some brainless reality show, before going to bed. That's it. Perfect birthday for me. Wouldn't dream of wanting anything else."
As if he could.
It’s something more profound than that, even though Cas can’t put his finger it.
For a while there was no doubt in his mind that the two were meant to be, that every cliché, every love story finally made sense, because loving Dean was as easy as breathing.
"They asked if I wanted to go and I said no and so they left."
His pie is long eaten and what's left of the tea must be cold, so Dean decides to check up on him, before the afternoon rush.
Because there's a boy half asleep in his lap.
A nervous chuckle escaped his lips as he tried to deflect by shooting Cas a crooked grin.
Emerald green eyes meet his own and his breath catches in his throat.
He clears his throat in order to break his incredulous stare.
All he could tell from the poems is that the stranger is a boy his age with green eyes who has a little brother, a resilient mother and no sense of self-worth.
And when they talked about everything and nothing until the sun rose, until Dean dosed off on Cas' shoulder and Cas fell asleep with his head resting against Dean's, well that was no one's business but theirs.
"You mean, you didn't dress up just for me?"
It was impossible to be in a bad mood in the company of his best friend.
Cas’ eyes follow the movement of Dean’s tongue and he’s momentarily distracted from his speech before he realizes what he’s doing and continues.
"You could always take your shirt off," Charlie shrugs nonchalantly, making Cas bump his leg against his desk. He bites back a curse as pain shoots through his knee, trying to be as quiet as possible, but judging by the smug look on Charlie's face she knows exactly what the mental image of a shirtless Dean does to him.
"I am so sorry," Dean says again.
His arms wind around Cas' neck and he presses their foreheads together and closes his eyes.
"Why are you staring at me? Don't you think I would've done something about this if I could? What about tech freak? Can't she rewire the stupid thing or reboot its system or whatever the fuck is necessary to get breathable air into this shit show of an office?"
Startled by the sudden movement, Dean looks up at him, startled, having been lost in thought.
“NO—” thundered Michael, but it was too late. Gabe reached a palm to each of their foreheads and in the next blink,
Dean stared at his jawline a moment before following his gaze. Now that he could see past him he understood what was so enthralling: the storm had finally left the shore. The roiling mass of dark clouds now tumbled east across Lake Superior and lightning spidered great sticky webs between clouds and down into the water. Thunder trailed seconds behind. “Awesome,” said Dean.
As for Cas…Cas always looked so damn happy to see him. Every time his eyes would grow wide, like he wasn’t sure whether Dean had left without saying goodbye. And fair enough. It had crossed his mind a couple times, especially since he kept hitting dead ends. Still, he’d taken to showing Cas the shitty pictures he took on his phone too, since he insisted on hearing every detail of Dean’s exploits as if he hadn’t spent his entire life living in the area, and seen everything a hundred times. Sometime this led to more stories from Cas. Other times, after the last guest had darkened the doorstep for the night, Cas pulled Dean upstairs and they passed what little free time the poor guy had without talking at all.
“Done for the season,” she said.
and slowly I would rise and dress,
“I think so too. An important use of repetition.” She paused, closed the book, and offered it to him. “Still up for that switch?”
When he arrived in town, it was several times as crowded as he remembered it. People were popping in and out of shops in the town center and taking selfies on the bridge over the little waterfall, and the sidewalks were full of pedestrians: college kids, most of whom didn’t bother looking before crossing the fucking street. At least Baby got a few whistles of appreciation along the way.
“I figured as much. Look, Sam.” Cas watched a drop of condensation slide down his beer glass, and swiped it away with his thumb. “Your brother doesn’t need some exec or manager coming in and filling his head with buzzwords. But I can still give him an outside perspective he might respect.”
side that Charlie brought out, or even how, against all the odds, Sammy still looked at him and saw a good brother? Or did notice the shadows of his darkest self, the jagged edges that Alastair had cast a blinding spotlight on, the part of him that haunted and shamed him his every idle moment? The part that was capable of cruelty and betraying others and destroying everything in his path? No, it was certain Cas couldn’t see it otherwise he wouldn’t still be there, using his pool cue to keep balance as he belly-laughed. And that’s why, in the end, nothing could go further than this. If they got too close, Dean’s shape would rip Castiel’s to shreds. Dean promised himself he would never let that happen.
In the end Dean took it, thinking back to how Cas had listened to Sam and Dean’s song, eyes closed, small beatific smile on his face. A man who hears music like he does must know what he’s talking about, at least some of the time. The headphones smelled of Cas’s sweat, which would usually have Dean running for Purell. But it wasn’t the stale kind Dean was used to, drunk rock stars and fans stinking of alcohol and weed, grimy mechanics swimming in oil and old coveralls, or detoxing junkies shaking the drugs from their pores. Just good, clean sweat from hard work and a trace of the soap the Mullens sold under CC’s Bees. So he settled for a cursory wipe with his own t-shirt, and put them on.
“I’ll buy next time it’s your turn to get the round,” Victor decided.
Dean shifted around to face Cas fully, and wowza. No sweater today, but a gray t-shirt for some local outfitting company. It really showed off his arms. How the hell had he forgotten how gorgeous Cas was so quickly? Even if he looked a bit upset. “What was that all about? Guy into real estate or something? Bet he wants to get at that agate beach.”
“Beautiful, isn’t it?” Castiel asked.
"Oh! Uh, yeah," said Dean, walking the few steps over and giving her an awkward pat on the hood. "She's my Baby."
“They’re gonna come for you,” said Dean, sniffling. He gave up on the duffel and slung it, still open, onto his shoulder. Then he slung the strap of the weapons bag over it, tossed the cabin key on the table, and was out the door. “Get out of there, right now. Grab Jess and split.”
From bygone eras and unforgiving lights all
Dean looked Alastair straight on and said, “No.”
“Shut up,” said Dean, nudging him with his elbow.
“Hey!” someone shouted behind them. “You! Look what you did to my car!”
“Not a chance,” Sam snarled.
Interesting. Castiel took a seat at the desk behind the white pieces and after a moment, Dean slid into the opposing one. He gestured for Cas to go ahead.
and the band pulled and lifted and the hands fell away
“Shame I won’t see you ‘til next week,” said Dean, after they’d cleaned up and settled back into his bed. “I wouldn’t say no to more of that. You know, if you want.”
He started walking. Then looked down at his phone, which was still open.
This had the desired affect. Cas picked up the sleeve for the Artie Shaw record with a small smile. “Klara did, yes. This was one of the first records in the collection. You enjoy music?”
“Death, though,” said Billie. She’d clearly spotted the same thing. “He was dizzy, and he hung on like death. His father beat the time on his head…his mother clearly upset. It’s a conceit, isn’t it?”
“Then don’t,” said Dean. “Fuck Zachariah, man.”
“Sammy,” he said. His speaking voice was as rough and lovely as his singing voice promised.
. The rest he took out now and set down in precarious towers around the box: hardcover poetry anthologies from Missouri, expensive special edition boxsets from Charlie, pass-it-on library paperbacks so cracked and worn the spines were illegible. Beneath all those were notebooks. Gifted moleskins, black and smooth; cheap grocery store spirals in primary colors, ripped and scribbled and smudged. One of them, half empty. It was a blue spiral, college-ruled—less ironic, now—the metal partially unscrewed from the edge. A few pencils were rolling about the bottom of the box, so he grabbed one of those too.
Ginsberg’s drafts. Lines crossed out and adjustments chicken-scratched in the margins and phrases reworked and reworked and worked over again.
Castiel cocked his head, confusion writ on his face.
“You gonna write it on Jack Allen?”
There was a murmur of agreement across the class at that one. “Good,” said Castiel. “All true. But what
Besides, he always had a great deal of grading to do during the school year. And while it wasn’t as cozy as his apartment, Castiel liked his office, too: the shelves filled with books, the little plants he bought from the flower shop in town, Claire’s bee, the way he could turn around in his chair and look out his windows onto campus, and the old stone chapel sitting on top of the hill. It was a good thing, because his lower level classes were always too full. His own fault, of course. Students would beg him to authorize overrides when the courses were filled to capacity, and if they wanted his instruction badly enough to bother, who was he to say no? Castiel was sure this was a factor in other colleges refusing him tenure, but he couldn’t regret it.
“If it’s that important,” said Cas, “he’ll come around.”
Dean felt that residual middle school feeling of desperately not wanting to be the odd one out, as he’d always been when they moved around, but swift on its heels was the realization that he was too old for that shit. And he was in the back of the room anyway, where only Kevin and Castiel could see him. He raised his hand, just enough to be noticed. Only a few other people did. Cas let his eyes flit to each of his students to assess their reaction. He gave Dean a fleeting smile. Or maybe he imagined it.
At length Dean became aware of a rustling in the underbrush on the other side of the road. He held his breath as he caught movement, a figure among the red and orange trees. He couldn’t tell what it was between the shadows. An old nightmare came back to him, more flotsam and jetsam floating to the surface of his mind now the floodgates were open: a monster chasing him through the woods, chasing him. The figure moved closer, walked toward the edge of the road where the trees began to thin, and…it was a deer.
Though there was no rain, the air was ripe with the taste of a coming storm. “Is the cavalry coming or not?” Dean joked weakly.
“Oh yeah?” Dean challenged. “How did I survive, huh? How am I not hurt?”
? He’s pretty sure he’s never said that before in his entire
It wouldn’t budge.
“Do you? I’m sure Ash has ProTools, so there’s your software. Get a laptop and some dynamic mics. A good producer,” he gestured at himself, “and the right kind of publicity, and you have yourself…maybe not a best-selling album, but one that sells decently enough. Et voila, a loyal following and as a bonus you keep all the profits.”
With a glance he knew it was a classic Honda off-roader. Late 60s, by her curves, twin exhaust pipes stacked on the left side. She was sorely in need of a paint job, chrome chipping, and rust was eating her up in places besides, so it was little wonder that Alastair would rather strip her for parts than build her into something else. Dean crouched to inspect the wheels. They were in surprisingly good shape, given the state of the rest of her. As for the engine…he did a quick scan. It needed a little TLC, but given that Abaddon had ridden it okay, and that the bones were good, he didn’t see why he couldn’t…Dean hesitated to reach for his tools, even with Abaddon’s threat still lingering overhead. He’d stripped hundreds of bikes before. What made this one so different? She was old, so what? But in asking himself the question he already had the answer: the bike wasn’t an it, but a
Castiel’s eyes flashed. Or, no, that must have been the lightning, judging by the thunder that rolled overhead. Dean held his breath, maybe for the disgust, or for Cas to laugh it off and joke back, but the last thing he was expecting was an even, “Is that what you think?”
Sam looked at Jake. Seeing the same determination in his face, he turned back to Az. “Yeah. Let’s play.”
Sam cut himself off and cleared his throat. Dean looked at him, and swigged his beer while he thought. “Why does that jog a bell?” he asked.
“Charlie, then. It’s good to meet you both. Now I’m going to tell you all a little bit about how I’m going to run this class. Every morning you will spend a half an hour at the beginning of class writing in your notebooks.”
Hope lit Sam’s face. He could finally see where Cas was going with this. “Absolutely,” Sam agreed.
“Nursery rhymes.”
“Does he, though?” Sam waved at someone who just came in, but promptly turned back to Cas. They had to lean closer now that the noise level was going up. “I’ve thought about this for a long time. Trying to figure out when I stopped being happy playing music. And I’m not sure exactly when it started, but by the time I hated it? It’s when Dean was no longer around. I might be willing to come back into the public to play, and write songs, but not as whatever Azazel and Ruby built me up to be. Just as myself, playing with my brother, just as himself. It was the family business, you know.”
“Oh—” Dean blushed. “Yeah, of course. Ah. Um.”
“Wanna know where the sights are nearby,” Dean answered. “Especially old things with cool stories behind them. Haunted houses, local legends, you know.” Dean propped his chin on his hand and smiled up at him. “You could show me yourself.”
They both smiled; then their faces melted back into neutral expressions, though they retained eye contact. It was actually really cool listening to a song, hearing its every nuance, and watching how another person reacted, knowing they were hearing the same thing. Dean could see the small movement in Cas’s eyes as he read Dean’s face in turn. Then the corner of his mouth lifted the slightest bit. Dean felt its echo rising in himself, and didn’t stop it. The music had sunk in its hooks. They started singing at the same time: “Before the day I met you, life was so unkind. You’re the key to my peace of mind. AND YOU MAKE ME FEEL!” They grinned as they sang—god, Cas looked like a dork—which, Dean supposed, made him a dork too—but there was really nothing like a man looking into another man’s eyes and going to town on a karaoke favorite. It was
At length Cas blinked, and opened up an accordion folder lying on his desk. “With Missouri’s recommendation, I’m happy to have you in class. Even though you won’t be receiving a grade, I will still expect the same effort from you as I expect from my other students.” He pulled out another smaller packet, and gave that to Dean, too. “I’ll give you a copy of my syllabus as it stands now, just to give you an idea. You may miss no more than two classes. We meet Tuesday and Thursday afternoons for an hour and a half. You’ll be expected to contribute to discussion at least once every class period. You will be writing at least one to two short explications for each poetic movement, depending on what the reading assignment is. There will be a paper at the end of each unit, which—” He held up a finger when Dean opened his mouth to protest. “—you will also write. If I feel it is below a passing grade, you will meet with me one on one like any other student, after which you will have the option to rewrite the paper.”
“I like it,” said Cas, a bit of that glow about him again. There was a bit of smug about the way he chewed his bite of cobbler after, too.
“Yeah, I confirmed it with Dad—and before you say anything I don’t think they’re the type to send Christmas cards to each other. Look, why don’t I give you her number, and then I’ll get in the car and start heading to you, okay? You can give her a call tomorrow while I’m still driving.” Dean held his breath, waiting.
That’s all it took. First a couple more gulls turned up. A blink, and then five more. Dean chucked a whole handful of popcorn this time, which tumbled down lightly between the varied stones of the agate beach, and within a minute dozens and dozens of seagulls were circling overhead, crying out for a feast. Dean chose his moments carefully, being as sparing as possible. The gulls landed, pecking between the rocks, stealing from each other, and then—
“Er, yes,” said Dean.
A boy, not yet a man) takes everything
They must have kissed for a while, because the next thing he knew, a new song was playing softly from the headphones, clutched in Cas’s hands over Dean’s shoulders. “Oh right,” said Dean. “’Du Hast’.” When Cas went in for another kiss, Dean leaned back a bit. “What about the car?” he asked.
Cas grunted. “Sam told you.”
And it was perfect.
“I think so, yeah,” said Dean.
Cas’s nose crinkled in a smile. “Good morning, Dean,” he said.
“Yeah, um, unless…”
“Well—”
“He must like baths too, huh?”
Cas felt tears pricking his own eyes. “He targeted the passion at the foundation of your self. The part of your soul that you look at and think, despite my failures and despite my mistakes, I am good and what I do in this world is good. And he redirected it. Little by little he twisted it inside out until one day you looked in the mirror and didn’t recognize the person staring back at you. Because it was too late. You’d already betrayed the person you used to be, and put out into the world the antithesis of what your gift is meant for.”
The thunderous rumble hot on its heels shook Dean to the core, because it was no pillar. It was the silhouette of a man in profile, a
. You say there’s no point and you’re not good enough and I’m better onstage alone and I thought you might want the opinion of a neutral fucking party.”
Cas listened to him as he let the yell fall away, quite naturally, until he slid seamlessly into the second verse, a deep well of emotion expertly leashed. Then he raised his voice again, shouting out the chorus, until he ripped himself open and burst into the guitar solo. And even though it was dim and Cas couldn’t make out his face, he could read his body language perfectly well, see how he wasn’t at all performing. Wasn’t self-conscious. Was just playing good music with his bandmates, feeling the emotions, letting them through, giving them voice. Letting them go. He leaned back at the high notes, hips cradling his guitar, bowlegs bent as he swayed back and forth, the amps filling the room, the music saying what needed to be said.
“Angels,” he answered, matter-of-fact.
“Don’t think so.”
She smiled brightly and took the bag, catching Patience on her next pass through the gulls. The kid jumped up and down in excitement. Once they were out of earshot, James shoved his hands in his pockets. Without looking at Dean, he said, “She didn’t say where you old friends from.”
“—might be in need of a little recreation.”
Cas smiled again. "She suits you, you know?"
“What?”
“What about Dad?”
“I see how it is.” Dean accepted the hug.
He hung up and patted his pockets for his keys. “Shit,” he muttered.
At length the bacon was gone and the last bit of syrup had been wiped up from their plates. Donna leaned back in her chair, absently patting her stomach, and looked out the window again.
Dean was overwhelmed. No other word. Overwhelmed. With guilt. With shame. He let the arguments wash over him, this time, the recriminations about ungrateful children, the comparisons of the different perceived behaviors of the fathers in the two poems…the nuance, all nuance lost. When Castiel told them to pair off and discuss further, Dean turned toward Kevin more out of habit than anything.
Funny what you forgot, when you left places behind.
“Could be.”
Is there life on Mars?
“My brother. Dean.”
The room fell into the usual thoughtful silence whenever a poem was finished. Castiel let it sit for a few moments. He stood to the side of the projector screen, hands on his hips, and surveyed the students. “First impressions?”
Cas tapped a button and handed over the phone. Gone was the righteous rage; all that was left was unapologetic concern. “She was the first person I thought of to call.”
“That is not what matters most,” said Mikey, his own voice tolling in the same chorus. “The Plan has begun earlier than expected, yes, but begun it has. Relinquish my Sword, Castiel.”
“I already told you I can’t! I can’t tell them everything because they don’t understand how his mind works, not like I do. I tried telling Sam once but I don’t think he really got it…in a lot of ways he’s still just kid…”
Cas sucked in a breath. “He’s at least twice our age.”
. “I don’t know,” he said.
“My staff?”
“Hell yeah, that’s a no. Not a no against kissing, but I sure as hell ain’t kissing you.”
, the collected works of Jack Allen, and he hadn’t really wanted anything to do with it. Dean supposed he was grateful for it because it was what had gotten Charlie speaking to him again after he’d blown up at her. The publisher had offered a decent deal for a poetry collection, which didn’t actually add up to much, but she had thought it was a good offer. He’d agreed to it mostly out of apology, and told her to do what she wanted with it.
They found themselves reading the next day’s pages together every lunch period over the week. One day when it was raining, they sat together in an empty hallway, a dead end in a far corner of the school, legs stretched long in front of them on the industrial carpet. Rain pounded at the window above their heads.
Patience rolled her eyes. “You sound like Dad.”
“Please take this seriously,” Sam pleaded. “What if he works for the Hellraisers?”
Had she seen the memory flash in his head, the last time he ever saw his mother, pinned to the ceiling and burning? If she wasn’t real, she was damn good at faking it. “And?” he said gruffly.
After an uproarious Christmas it was quiet and lonely in Castiel’s little apartment, but the rest of break moved quickly regardless. He was sending emails back and forth with Naomi about lesson planning and, come the new year, even meeting with her at the school to get ready. It also gave him ample opportunity to bring her his plan for the theatre kids, and ask what kind of permissions they might need from the school. She informed him that all a student club needs is for two faculty members to sign up as advisors. These she promised to find, so all that was left was to wait for the first day of school to ask the kids if they were on board.
“So you know he was in the music industry?”
Dean’s lip curled in a sneer. “Alastair seduced me. I let him.”
“Not the Mark X?”
Cas did his best with the tax work, but for once the numbers offered no escape for him. These Hellraisers had smashed a hornet’s nest at his feet, stinging everyone around him. Sam wasn’t his usual self in class, Dean wouldn’t look him in the eye, and the Singers were upset, too. But the crux of it was that Castiel knew next to nothing about them, yet didn’t know who best to ask. Still, taxes waited for no man. He had no plans of disappointing the Singers with shoddy accounting. It was so slow-going, though, that by 10:30 even thoughts of the Hellraisers were being overshadowed by pie.
That…actually made some sense. “But you don’t like it?”
The only falls Dean had ever had before were quick ones, never higher than the second story, hardly enough time to think “Oh, shit!” before hitting the ground. This was nothing like that. This was a suspended moment in time, an endless few seconds, a startling, sharp clarity that rendered his entire life visible. Not flashing like some highlights reel, but visible, a vista, a topography whose hills and valleys he could effortlessly survey and understand.
Al had been hinting lately that Dean was about ready to become an initiate in the Hellraisers. About ready for what? His mind clambered to answer the question, filling it with everything he suspected about the gang but still didn’t know, didn’t want to know. Dean might not recognize who the hell he was anymore, but it wasn’t that. It sure as fuck wasn’t that.
“This is swing,” said Dean. “Why aren’t we swinging?”
Dean tossed the paper back onto the table after having read only halfway down the second page, and took a strong gulp of his red wine. “Should I drop out now and save you the trouble?”
The first verse was almost over and Dean was five seconds away from sending out a search party when Cas finally slumped into the seat next to him. Between his wild hair and wrinkled button-up he looked rumpled and harried. “Where have you been?” Dean hissed.
? And cars are ladies, Cas, everyone knows that.”
“Passion, Dean,” Cas sighed when he teased him about it. “Her passion.”
The engines were loud even from that distance, and they could hear shouts being traded back and forth, but not quite what. It must have been really something, though, because suddenly the Rider shifted into gear and rode out into the street. All five of the Hellraisers wasted no time in following, peeling out of the lot to make chase. They didn’t even look back.
“Of course it is. Writing is about communicating your idea, isn’t it?”
Who was he kidding? He swiped open his phone.
Speaking of which, “Let me give you something,” Cas said.
With a
Working the case had him taking on a strange double life the next few days. In one of them he was a hunter: he visited the towns up and down the coast, visited the nearest libraries to browse their books and poke at their computers, spoke to a college professor in Duluth and an Elder up in Grand Portage. He even kept an eye on news out of Hibbing, though it was all quiet on that front. The bitch of it was that Dean’s evidence wall was made up of little more than Patience’s drawing and a couple wild guesses. He had no idea what he was even supposed to be looking for. It’s almost like what Missouri and James had claimed to feel hadn’t even happened yet and Dean was left waiting for some other sign. The longer it took, the less sure he was that he needed to be there at all.
“I want to help people.”
It was a masterpiece of kid crayon: misshapen figures that represented herself, her parents, and Dean, blue scribbles for the lake, obligatory yellow sun in the corner, a square of red to represent the popcorn bag, a couple dozen humped gray lines like elongated Ms to represent the seagulls flying around. “Dude,” he said, “this is the coolest drawing ever. Thank you!”
Dean rubbed his thumb against his pulse. “Good,” he said, gruffly. Like it might have come out as sweet and awkward as Cas had heard him just before, but Dean was deliberately trying to cover it up.
She gave his shoulder a light smack with the back of her hand and shook her head. “Have a seat.” Instead of going back behind her desk, she sat in one of the two chairs in front of it. He took the other one, conscious of his knees poking out of his ratty jeans. They were so comfortable, and he so rarely had to make an effort, he’d forgotten. Some impression he was making.
“So I’m working here ‘til midnight.”
“Most of the usual suspects for the crew,” said Sam. Besides him Castiel recognized a couple of the others from his classes, but the rest were strangers.
The sky was noticeably darker, the wind palpably stronger. Dean watched the roiling clouds pouring down from the mountains until a crash came from behind and he turned, startled. Another crash sounded and this time he saw it happen: the waves on the lake had become tremendous, the foamy spray as they hit the cliff reaching over the guard rail. He sought Cas out for reassurance, a fellow witness, anything. Castiel was turning in a slow circle, the wind whipping at his hair, his coat, but not buffetted about himself at all. The tower stood tall behind him, the light flashing round and round overhead. As the clouds grew closer, blacker, it quickly became the easiest thing to see.
“I pretty much haven’t written a paper since I was seventeen, so if you’re gonna want me to write those you can’t expect it to be genius A+ quality, okay?”
“Hey, yourself. I’m Alex,” she said. “I work over at the clinic.”
“Dude,” said Kevin.
“I’m sorry to hear that,” said Castiel. Somehow he made it sound like more than the usual platitude. “Though why did you drive all the way out here instead of getting some rest at home?”
The last bowl of chips was set out, and Sam pounded up the stairs to touch up his hair, or whatever he did to primp himself. Dean followed quietly after him, and sat on his bed in the room the brothers shared. Sam left the bathroom and started when he saw Dean was there. “What?” he asked.
“They don’t read plays in high school English anymore, huh?”
Energized by the sugar rush, Dean slid back into his car a little less wearily than he’d left it—though with no less pain. He shoved the third cookie into his mouth all at once and put his car key in the ignition. Baby’s engine was very loud in the isolated bubble the motel had carved for itself. He pulled out of the parking spot and slowly drove to where it split to either side and ran parallel to the land’s edge. He turned to the right as instructed, putting the lake on his left. It was probably quite the view when there was enough light to see it by. He kept one eye on the road and the other on the deep, dark emptiness where Superior met Minnesota. Periodically cabins popped up between the drive and the lake, some bigger than others, though Baby’s headlights only flashed against parked cars a couple of times. The road kept running parallel to the cliff’s edge until its end, where there was enough space for a car to turn around, if need be. The small cabin near there had 12 in large black numbers screwed to the wood next to the front door. There was a gravel patch to its right, and that’s where Dean pulled in the Impala and parked.
