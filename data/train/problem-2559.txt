The guys, including Sam snickered, whilst, he tried to fight down the tummy fluttering reaction to Benny’s words and the damn blush crawling up his cheeks.
Dean was busy remembering every inch of skin that made up the unknown alphas face. His heart was in his throat. He feared for his life, with this very handsome, blue eyed slaver, that smelled of apples. He knew he would only survive if he adhered to the alphas commands and requests. He timidly asked, “what condition?”
Dean wasn’t able to get much sleep. He was laying flat on his back, staring up at the ceiling of his bedroom. He could only think of one wolf- Castiel. His omega mate plagued his thoughts- that gorgeous smile, that absolute shyness, that beautiful blue eyes and most importantly that bond the town wolf shared with his little brother Gem.
. How lucky were he and Sam to score such amazing pastry chefs as husbands and lifelong mates! For a minute, all their current heartaches and upcoming problems slipped his mind and all he wanted to do was hug and kiss the life out of his mate. So, he walked over to his sweetheart, and hugged him from behind. He wrapped his arms around Castiel’s waist, pressing his palms tenderly into his mate’s softened tummy. He laid a tender kiss, just under his mate’s ear, sniffing lightly that mesmerizing apple pie scent, instantly letting out a hum of delight, “Mmm. You smell heavenly, baby”.
He huffed and folded his arms along his chest, “He’s not going to be a problem, Bobby.” He ran a hand down his face, releasing a tired sigh, “Just…stunned is all!”
He cleared his throat once more, “Um- I should go check on Bobby. He says he’ll be helping me familiarize with the auto shop setup”.
Two families whose soldiers roamed different corners of the city. Most under the disguise of humans- hunting for their next prey.
Dean beamed, “Hey Cas”. The man pulled out an animal skinned pouch from his pocket, “I bought you a present".
There was nothing wrong with his beloved girl; his loss of concentration was due to Castiel Novak’s lame-o car parked right next to his.
Dean jumped a little- getting startled- before he’s offing his stool and turning to engulf him properly. He loved his big brothers safe and comforting hugs. Both were emotional and they could feel it in their hearts. Dean’s voice was thick as he murmured into his shoulder, “Hey Sammy! God I missed you!”
was begging to be filled. The whole world around them became null and void. He clung onto the alpha who was moaning above him (running his fingers down the alphas shoulder blades), who was busy turning him to mush.
Again, work has been keeping me too busy. Sighs, apologies. I hope you enjoy the next chapter! And let me know what you think!
He beamed, “So, daddy, can Cas and I go see the bees and then I want to take him to go see the tiny stream filled with tiny rocks, please?”
This time, Dean looked at him with an inkling of determination in those saddened green orbs, “It means, Cas, that us….
He sighed and suddenly felt the tiredness of two years hit him. He dug his hands into the front pockets of his jeans, and paced. He stopped pacing after a whole minute to confess in a drained voice, “I lost my scholarship 2 years back, Cas. I got into a fight with a rich asshole alpha. Little did I know said alpha was son to another asshole alpha who had the power to clip me off my scholarship. I…needed to find ways to pay for my coursework, pay the boarding fees for my dorm and feed myself. So, I found two part time jobs, worked my ass off just to keep my education rolling, so that someday I could give you the life that
She beamed and clapped her hands together. “Ok good! Now, who’s up for some hot chocolate and freshly baked apple pie!?”
“Who you calling cussy! Don’t make me come there and hang my bad foot in your ass!” The second gruff voice of his other good old friend Bobby Singer replied.
Uh! He didn’t want to give in, but, every inch of his alpha wolf wanted to reach out and give the omega what he wanted. He had two weaknesses; Sammy and this
He smiled and did as requested. He sat himself next to the blue eyed man and was comfortable enough to slip an arm behind Cas, to grip his waist. He loved that Cas snuggled into him- the man’s torso was facing his side- inwards, forearm on his shoulder, knee folded in while the other leg was on the ground. He could feel Cas eyes meet the side of his face. He turned his head slightly and met those curious blues. He asked, “So, what movie have you chosen, angel?”
Dean did his own unique thing for a first date and he was impressed. He laughed, he blushed, and he felt immense joy. That was all he needed.
“Well then. See! You’re definitely a lucky guy to be eating delicious home cooked meals! If I had a choice between takeout and home cooked meals; I would choose the latter.”
Dean felt exactly the same. He kissed the top of his lovers sweaty dark hair, “This will never end, baby. We just have to be smart”.
He saw Cas look like he was going to cry or something and look over at his daddy. His daddy kissed Cas cheek and whispered something into Cas ear that made him smile and his cheeks turn pink. Cas looked back at him just like the way daddy would look at him too – with heart eyes, “Yes, sweetheart. I would love it if you called me papa.”
Again, maybe he was overthinking or over analyzing. He thought he saw the corner of Dean’s lip quirk up in a barely there smile. He quickly averted the mans intense grass green eyes, that looked almost deep sea green in this lighting. Meanwhile, Dean apologized, “Sorry, for the mix up, Cas”.
He answered, “They ordered that if within the year, you do not conceive, I must plant my pup into a fertile second mate. One they have already chosen to bear my offspring”.
Now, plans are to focus on my fic “BLUE JAY”😁 Check it out if you have the time (Updates will begin tomorrow).
They were now leaning their foreheads against each others, sharing their breaths. Their slow grind was slowly picking up speed.
It was just that everything was overwhelming. And truth is, he kinda felt afraid to be alone right now. Particularly when he felt scrutinizing eyes on him the moment he entered the pack halls with Gabriel.
“Dad, how am I going to explain to Cas what the council require of me to do!?” He rubbed a hand down his face, “He'll be devastated! Heck! We just recently lost a pup, dad!” He really wanted to pull the hairs out of his own scalp.
Sam wanted to see Gabriel so badly, but he couldn’t. He couldn’t risk Gabriel’s safety. And, he had promised Dean that he would stay away till Lucifer was brought to task for his heinous unforgivable crimes. He would have to resort to texting his upset boyfriend who still did not understand why Sam had to stay away.
Chuck Milton nodded and slipped on his flute of champaign. “Yup. A disgrace to our pure bloodline and kind. The tainted spawn of a human and wolf.”
He had a feeling that Dean probably wanted to talk about what happened at dinner a week and a half ago, so yes, he was a little nervous. He didn’t know what the alpha might say, and he could only hope that it’s good.
For the first time ever, Dean reached out to touch an alpha. He rested his skeletal like hand atop his alphas hand, “Yes alpha. This is ok with me”. Something told him to trust in Castiel Novak.
. He said in a displeasing tone, “who in the hell still drives that piece of scrap metal! Such blasphemy to be parked beside a beauty like baby!”
. Was he really all those things to Dean? He didn’t know why those words were hurting him so much. Right now, he was extremely sad, but, more so, he was angry. He didn’t know whether he was angry at Dean or himself though.
All she wished, the moment Dean and Sam were born, was for them to live a carefree and happy life. She always asked her ancestors to guide them on their paths, and be there for them when the going gets tough. And boy oh boy, has her children been through some trying times.
- opposite his café. A stain in this old and vulnerable town. He shivered at the sight of the red bricked structure and that flicking green neon sign that read, ‘
Then, the alpha laid a sweet peck on his throat before pulling back. He immediately whined at the loss of alpha warmth, opening his eyes to catch the sight of a barely controlled, breathless Dean- concentrated on him with hunger in those green orbs (at a good few feet away). He said, “Dean, we don’t have to wait. We can do this now. I’m ready.” He sounded a little desperate- and he was.
Castiel felt hot tears run down his cheek, holding his little brother as close as possible to his heart. “Me too, Gabe. Me too. But, I will do all in my power to keep you safe, I promise.”
. Dean shook his head and finally glanced at him, again with saddened eyes. The alpha looked like whatever he would say next, would be hard. The alpha smiled sadly at him, making his heart squeeze in a hopeless way. Then, Dean admitted something shocking- in a hesitant tone, “Cas, I…um…I had dreams of you too…every time I fell asleep….and….um- sort of thought of you….alot…when I was awake…um…mostly during my ruts.”
He had so much to do, so much to see, so much to give before being forced to be tied down into a life of mating.
Dean and Sam just watched the exchange quietly. These were happy times now. Lucifer and his alphas that participated in the slaughter of the Novak Pack omegas and pups were now captured and sentenced immediately to life imprisonment in wolf prisons. The Novak Pack wolves no longer hid and were now given space to set up their homes in Winchester Pack lands.
So, Dean did the same thing, pulling out a little and sinking back in. Christ that felt too good. He itched to fuck. His groin and cock burned in desire. He shivered when Castiel threw his head back, moaning out, “More!”
Dean knew that communicating back telepathically may be the only choice he is provided by the omega, for now. So he decided to turn his back to Cas door, sliding down it, till he was seated on the ground. He had his knees pulled up to chest, his arms wrapped securely around his crooked knees, his feet firmly pressed flat into the floorboards, and the back of his head pushing back into the wooden door. His gaze fell on the portraits of he and Cas hanging on the walls- all laughing and happy. He sighed,
. So, in other words, it’s the best time for a reserved guy like him, to be visiting a pub. He never really enjoyed too much people all crowded up in one area.
He was drawn out of his thoughts when the barbarian alpha leader came stumbling into the tent with a horn filled with wine in one hand. His heart was beating fast and he was frozen still as the alpha seized him up hungrily from head to foot. Then those terrifying words said in the alphas slurred gruff voice rang out through the tent, “Strip and present, omega!”
Hehe. I'm sure many of my readers know that I don't like hovering too much on pain. I love our boys!
What was surprising was that Cas would undress before him, so boldly, before slipping into a bathrobe and heading to the bathroom. It was times like that that he would feel a sense of shyness, and at the same time a tinge of excitement overcome him.
He had never been affected by anyone’s closeness and sweet words before. Cas words and closeness had this indescribable spark of pleasant energy flowing through him. His heart was fluttering hard, and, everything felt so magical and perfect at this very moment. He was drawn to the beautiful blue eyed man, who was so bold and adorable. His hands itched to grab Cas waist, so, he gave in and lightly gripped Cas on either sides of his waists. He found himself studying Cas blush and shyness. He whispered back, “Is this ok?” If Cas was uncomfortable, he would let go.
He knew he shouldn’t, but proceeded to peer in through a hole in the wall. What he saw broke his heart even further.
Suddenly he was feeling eager to learn. No one had ever taken the time out to teach him something- like a popular game before. So, without much thought, he asked, “Will you teach me how to aim and hit the cue ball right, Dean?”
There is this heavy weight in his chest and the fear that John may not want anything to do with the Novak Pack. And, he wouldn’t blame the Winchester Pack alpha seeing as his main priority would be to secure the Winchester Pack from any form of harm. On the upside, he always viewed John to be an open minded, rule breaker and free thinker, so he hoped something good would come out of the discussions. He nodded,
Dean seemed to take deep breaths, just to calm himself down. And, when the alpha was calm, all he had left on his face was a sudden sadness and defeat (that shook
Novak Pack lands had the same scenic view of Winchester Pack lands. There were tall pine trees littering the mountain sides, there were placid lakes and waterlily filled ponds in the flat lands. The only uniqueness inside Novak Pack lands were the different varieties of orchids that grew like weeds everywhere.
As soon as Dean and Castiel appeared behind John, Ellen’s voice changed into motherly excitement, her face lighting up as she got off her chair and made her way to his pups with open arms, “Oh how are my sweet children?” Yup, Dean, Sam and Castiel were considered her pups too.
He shrugged his shoulders, meeting the man’s eyes briefly. “No problem, Dean”. The way Dean smiled warmly at him was enough to make his heart want to climb out of his chest, run around and scream out loud how ‘
It took several minutes for Cas to finally stir awake. The little wolf lifted his head, yawned, stretching his paws out on his chest-
His alarm sets off at 6:00am, he gets out of bed, he lazily trudges to the bathroom (takes a piss, then, brushes his teeth), he has a shower, he readies himself in a black suit and tie, he makes his way over to his kitchen, has his coffee and a bite, throws on his trench coat, grabs his messenger bag, grabs his apartment and car keys, heads down to the complex’s basement garage, locates his car, gets in and drives to work.
. That’s when he made his way over to his omega who was pulling out weeds in a nearby field of sunflowers. From a distance, he could see that Castiel was a little thinner than the last time, plus, the little omega had grown a few inches off the ground. And damn, that dark hair seemed to be getting thicker and messier- it made him itch to dig his fingers in
He schooled himself and rapped his knuckles on the door. Almost immediately, he heard a gravelly voice answer, “Come in”. Yeah, that voice was definitely sending shivers through him.
“It’s good to be home.” Dean smiled and let his green eyes roam his 6 foot 2 height. “Damn Sammy! Eating your Wheaties did wonders for you, huh!”
“Benny, Ash, Adam And Michael will be meeting up at the ‘Irish Pub’ at around 7pm. So, after dinner with the parents, you and I  can meet up with the guys for a few beers and try some of  the states best ‘Buffalo Chicken Wings’”.
Charlie sucked in a breath. She looked torn between excited and concerned. “What happened, Castiel? Did he say anything?”
Yup the excitement of Dean and John Winchester (including him) could not be contained at that announcement. He’d like to indulge in something comforting before he hit the hay and tried to forget about the happenings of tonight.
He turned to see a handsome alpha in a tux who looked in his fifties or early sixties. The man resembled Dean so much with his grass green eyes and wore his well trimmed salt and pepper beard quite well. There was a beautiful sandy blonde haired lady standing beside the alpha with a tender and loving smile aimed at Sam and Dean.
What would he make of this, because, if he was being true to himself; he was affected by Dean’s words- to the very soul.
It was silent for nearly a minute, and he honestly thought that Cas had all but tuned him out and abandoned this conversation. But, then, he heard the click of a lock, and suddenly the door he was braced on flung open- which meant he was caught off guard and falling back onto the floor, his head and back knocking lightly onto Cas carpeted floor. He groaned and peered up at Cas who was standing just to the right of his ear- blue concerned eyes looking down at him. The omega looked stunned and slightly apologetic, asking, “Dean, are you ok?”
All Castiel could think was how much he owed to his Blue Jay friend. He smiled as he surrendered to the warmth of his alpha, whispering, “Good.”
Dean would watch the omega toying with his own hole, legs spread apart to give the alpha a view of his leaking cavern while he panted out, “Please Dean. I’m ready for your knot alpha! I can’t take it any longer!”
This reminded him of just how he wasn’t enough for Dean, how he got rejected by his own mate 10 years ago. He grit his teeth, suddenly finding courage he didn’t know he had, “what do you want, Dean?” He sneered, “Come to tell me how this is not right? That our bond just isn’t right!” He repeated Dean’s painful words to him 10 years ago.
As if an invisible force was guiding his chin up, he met the green eyes of the alpha that smelled so alluring. This time, he felt his omega yip within him, particularly happy that its alpha was smiling so handsomely back. He couldn’t help the small pull at the corner of his lips as he glanced into those warm welcoming eyes framed by the most longest lashes he’s ever seen on a man. He didn’t mean for the next words to slip out of his mouth, “You…like me?”He didn’t dare turn his head to see why Gabe was giggling like a school girl with a crush while he chatted with the other long haired alpha.
But, Jimmy went through trauma counseling and seemed to be coming back to his usual confident self. His older twin was making friends again, going out to parties, maintaining a ‘B’ average and dating.
He couldn’t control his tears this time, feeling it blur his vision and finally spill down his cheeks. His chest felt like it was being squeezed tight by an invisible force. His whole being trembled lightly.
His protective side kicked in. He heard the scuttling of pawed feet on their varnished wooden floor. He turned around just in time to see Dean skid to a halt in the kitchen. He instantly caught sight of whatever was clamped between his eldest sons snout.
Charlie and Dorothy were so in love, always doting on the other. It was kinda funny, seeing as they completely loathed each other in their high school days. Well, somehow, they had matured and finally ran into each other again at a LARP event. This time, Charlie bucked up and asked Dorothy out….and the rest they say is history.
Sam felt the same. So, they both stood to the side, chatting and trying to pass time…until something spectacular happened, Sam had finally reacted to one of the omegas. This omega was clearly different from Sam’s usual type i.e. Sam always settled for darker haired girls…never once has he seen Sam date a man.
Castiel shook his head, turning to meet his eyes with such kindness, “I would love for Kaylen to show me the bees and streams. It would certainly be an exciting adventure.”
Deep breaths and mental self talks usually calmed him down. He would swallow the lump in his throat and lay his head gently back against the top edge of the headboard whenever the door to their bathroom closed shut behind Cas. He stared up at the ceiling, sighing, “Get a hold of yourself, Dean. This is not the time to be getting all hot about the sexy omega in your room.”
This made Dean and Castiel chuckle. Oh they knew which two he was going on about- they were family after all and his three boys had spent a lot of time chasing those alphas tails and massive paws from mere pups to now. As if on cue, he heard the loud grumpy voice of his good old friend Rufus Turner bark out, “Oh go screw a cactus ya miserable old cussy!”
He smiled at his now slightly nervous children and winked, “Don’t worry.” He thumbed towards the council hall, “Those alphas in there are close to losing their entire teeth. Well two of them at least.”
Bless his soul, Sam growled warningly at the pack alpha, “Don’t threaten my future mate, Chuck. Watch it!”
John nodded, “Yes. And that’s why you have dreams and thoughts of each other during heats or ruts, are drawn to each other- much stronger than anyone else, and that’s why you can communicate telepathically even if one is in wolf form while the other is in human form. Your constant longing for each other is a natural feeling between two destined mates. You were meant to be a pair.”
Nevertheless, that was the least of his worries. Today he sat at the dinner table, feeling terrible and upset. He lowered his gaze onto his still filled plate of food before him, feeling tears well in his eyes as he whispered, “I’m sorry.”
The next morning, he woke up warm and curled up under his sheets. The furs on his body acted like a heater- enough to sustain him through the lonely cold night. The time on his caterpillar digital clock read 7:00am.
Castiel felt like his whole world stopped spinning the instant Dean had mentioned her name and to make it worse, she was moving in tomorrow. All his life, Anna made his life a living hell, and now, she was given the opportunity to continue doing so.
The alpha looked stone cold pissed and within an inch of morphing into his true wolf form. Where was John?
Sam glanced at him weirdly. But, he ignored it, in turn of following in the direction that Cas and the red head went. He didn’t know what he was doing or why….but, he felt like having a match with Cas.
Missouri tapped his cheek lightly, “Good things are coming, Castiel. Maybe it starts off painful, but, it gets better. And, Jimmy has always been by your side and in your heart. His memory lives on in you. Don’t you ever forget that”.
Cas shot steely blue eyes at Dean, that made the alpha immediately clamp his mouth shut. The omega growled, “Shut up, Dean! Mom and dad need to know the truth!”
And he watched Dean’s Impala zoom down the road with a churning tummy and teary eyes (that didn’t stop overflowing, even after the Impala became a mere dot in the distance, before it disappeared).
Gabe snickered, “Well, come to think of it, Anna is a wannabe. She thinks that her pretend mating with Dean means he’s her destined mate and shit. Stupid privileged immature brat!” Gabe pushed himself up on his elbow, hovering over his side, peering down at him, eyes all concerned, “Just alert Dean to be careful of her, if Anna decides to try her luck on Dean. She’s a snake.”
Only this time, Dean’s heart began to race as neared the lair. He was also very uncomfortable with the fact that the hunters whom his father had sent to fetch him were walking a few meters behind him. He was being summoned by his dad and he hoped he hadn’t pissed the head lycan off further than necessary.
His alpha walked up to him, unbinding him and pointing towards a nearby stream, “Bathe yourself omega, get yourself ready for my arrival in our tent.” With that the alpha walked away.
Of course he expected stubbornness from Cas. It was the omegas default setting. Stubbornness, intelligence and cuteness were what made Cas who he was. He dug his hands into the front pockets of his jeans, eyes timidly focused on the window just over the omegas shoulder. He awkwardly felt shy, replying, “Because, I didn’t like seeing you upset when you saw Lisa…putting her hands on me…like that.”
He doesn’t know if he should call it their loss, seeing as Dean was hardly home now. The alpha was being hauled into council meetings by the current Lawrence Pack alpha, John Winchester-
Like the first time, this kiss was sweet. The only difference now, is that there was more exploring. Dean promised to teach his boyfriend the art of kissing- and the next step was introducing some tongue.
They were just standing there, looking all awkward. So, this time, he had to step up and decided a change of topic. “So, I’ve got your um- paperwork for your contract printed out. Maybe you could get down to reading it, and if you have any queries or concerns then you can point them out to me”. He gestured to the empty chair before his office desk, “Have a seat, Mr. Winchester”.
Life had led them this far….Destiny had allowed an omega and alpha to meet and fall in love. Now, they were being made whole with the gift of a pup.
Castiel’s eyes were fully blow with desire and want. The omega’s dark hair already sticking to his sweaty forehead. He hummed and bit his bottom lip, “Hmmm. Ok Dean. I already have it ready for us.”
Castiel felt his cock being massaged so erotically by that sweet hole. He shivered whenever his cockhead would press against Dean’s g-spot. The sound of his lycan boyfriend crying out in ecstasy, wriggling on his cock and meeting his every thrust, had him moaning out, “oh Dean! So fucking good!”
He shyly threaded his fingers into Deans, feeling a slight heat travel up his cheeks, saying, “I forgive you, Dean. You are a good alpha.”
John chuckled at his wife, “Maybe Sam, honey. He is after all dating Castiel’s big brother.” His heart may have squeezed at that revelation, maybe he didn’t want it to be Sam who talked about him.
Out of all the Winchester’s harbored around the living room, Gem was the most talkative one. Well, a 4 year old with his wild imaginations and pup adventures would have a list of things to talk about come end of the day.
He watched in serious nervousness as Dean thumbed in the direction Charlie had disappeared off to. “Your girlfriends got a spitfire personality!” Dean walked over to his side of the pool table, eyes still lingering on him. “You’re a lucky man, Cas”.
Castiel’s eyes fell to the ground, nodding with so much obedience, “Ok alpha. I will fetch her for you”.
He didn’t stir when the door to his bedroom opened nor did he flinch when his father’s careful voice sounded, “Dean, son, are you ok?”
Dean craved so badly to have his hard cock buried into Castiel’s dripping hole. The smell of Castiel’s delicious sex juices, dominating the air, had his alpha feeling excited and mad with lust. But, he couldn’t. He should be able to, as Castiel was ripe for the taking; and under wolf laws, Castiel could be claimed by his alpha if he wanted.
His voice trembled and his eyes pooled with tears, the blurry floor was his focus as he responded, “No Gabe, I’m not ok. P-please take me h-home, I c-can’t be here any more.”
Somehow, he wanted to show off his blue eyed prize to the entire pack. Maybe, take the male omega before all- the way any true ruling alpha barbarian would.
His fascination soon changed into deep seated heartache and longing. He yearned to be one of those omegas down there, flaunting themselves at any handsome alphas. He yearned to feel the excitement that would brew when an alphas eyes were hooked on him, seizing him up as a potential mate.
He uttered, “wait!” He then turned back to glance into the shadows, snapping out, “I don’t know what you’re playing at Craven, but, know that Dean is my choice! Your obsession with me needs to stop and you need to walk away!” His eyes could finally fixate on a silhouette in the dark. And from memory, he knew it was Craven.
At one point, Castiel was distractedly enjoying the feel of his alphas fingers massaging the nap of his neck. Too distracted that he was caught off guard when Gem asked, “Don’t you think butterflies are cute, Blue?”
Before he knew it, he was getting up on his paws, and, trotting over to the blue jay. The blue jay chirped in delight before taking flight once more-
He heard Dean’s boots crunching on the gravel below their feet, feeling the man’s warmth just to his side. He couldn’t stop thinking of how Dean’s body felt, nearly plastered into him last night-
So maybe it was a good thing that his parents chose someone for him. He knew that his mother and father would choose someone who would be a good fit to him. Sam too.
Warning: This chapter is sex with an underage. So please take heed! And, we must take into account the context of that times, sex happened when a lot were young and before 18 too. Keep an open mind.
Daddy knelt down by his bedside, still not touching him. The way daddy seemed so calm and composed was impressive. Then again, his dad was an experienced alpha when it came to ruts and would most probably have it all figured out. Daddy gently spoke, “its ok son. You will get through this. Daddy will bring you a few things so that you can relieve yourself.”
. So, he just had to comment. And, he wished he hadn’t, when the man’s face turned sad. And, the man seemed affected negatively by his comment of his eye color. Somehow, he sensed that this man before him was always or mostly surrounding himself with a
He knew that Dean was just speaking an honest observation, however, he couldn’t help but feel as if it meant that his eyes were dull, lifeless and….boring. Yes, his brother’s sapphire eyes could tame the most vilest of beasts- he has experienced its power to calm and he has seen how brilliantly attractive it was.
He fell asleep while his alpha was still buried deep inside him, knotted and leaking hard. He felt the touch of soft lips on his cheek, but it must be a dream, Dean would never be affectionate with him. Never.
Michael sighed. There was really nothing he could do about this situation. His little brother was stepping up to his game. “Fine!” He then signaled the two bodyguards, “Come with me. I have to go pick up another omega from the market slave ring!”
Right now, all he wanted to do was reach out and bang those two knucklehead’s heads together and stay
His heart fluttered several times. He inhaled a deep breath and pulled out the rose from behind him, “Here, this red rose is for you”.
Dean heart achingly uttered, “Baby, the Council have chosen Anna Novak to be my second mate, when the time arises, and pups need to be conceived. She will be moving in tomorrow”.
Charlie replied, “Dorothy will be busy working on her latest ‘Wizard Of Oz’ project for the upcoming Emerald City Convention, so she won’t be coming. Plus, she will want me to be out of the apartment for a few hours, as she can’t concentrate when I’m around”. Charlie giggled at the end.
Cas wrapped arms around himself- as if for comfort. The omega had slightly watery eyes as he turned to face
“Good night baby. Sweet dreams.” He laid one final kiss on his son’s forehead, before heading off to the door and closing it shut behind him.
Cas had to meet Dean’s gaze with a confusing weary look. Still those green eyes didn’t seem unfazed. There was just pure curiosity and honesty in those beautiful alpha eyes he had come to love so much. He asked almost weakly, “Won’t your parents find me…unsuitable…for their prince?” He chewed his bottom lip, heart squeezing just a little as he admitted, “I mean, I am just a poor commoner.”
His cafe was the heart of the town. Well renowned and recognized for its five year winning streak in Harmony’s thriving small business awards. This classic establishment also had a 4 and half star rating. Mhmm, which meant tourists also stopped by to try out their pies and coffee. There was never a disappointment.
! Charlie shifted her eyes to Dean, “Dean, would you be kind enough to give Castiel some pointers, while I go order us another round of beers, please?”
Their lips slotted perfectly, moving in tandem and seeking each others’ taste. Cas lips so soft and warm between his- so pure and delicious.
Castiel suspected what Gabe was here for. Apparently, news always spread fast in the Novak mansion. He lightly touched his brother’s chest, sighing, “Gabe, now isn’t exactly the right time to meet my omega. He is resting now, plus, too much attention will overwhelm him”.
Dean threw in a cheeky smirk followed by a chuckle, “Mhmm. That's not what I picked up, omega”. The alpha then shrugged, “Plus, I could smell how jealous you were too".
He peeked his head into the office, meeting Castiel’s beautiful- um no- unique blue eyes. He said, “Um- are you free right now? I’ve um- I’ve read the contract and signed it”.
Dean threw in a wink and that got butterflies fluttering in his tummy and his cheeks heating up. “You’re welcome, Cas”.
He trembled. He was upset and angry. His comfort right now was his old bedroom at his parents house- just sitting on the edge of his bed, head bowed and staring at his feet, away from the crowd at his little brothers engagement party.
For three years, his sole focus was on Kaylen, but just recently, things have developed. His father wanting to pass on the pack alpha title to him, but, in order to do so successfully, he needed to be with mate. Such was the law of the old.
He still remembered that night, 18 year old Prince Dean visited his family’s cottage. Well, more so, took shelter from a sweltering storm. He was only 10 at the time and remembered being thrilled at seeing royalty in his home. And he felt, at first instances, his heart was won by the handsomeness, charm and strength of the alpha prince.
That’s right. They were both getting mated off to the Winchester brothers. He didn’t know who they were, nor has he seen their faces.  But, he would bet that their reactions would be more appealing towards Gabe than he.
Of course, he pushed his feelings for Dean unto the back burner. Jimmy deserves something good. His brother had been through a lot, with the car crash, the nightmares that followed and the counseling sessions. It was in high school, that Castiel buried his feelings for Dean- never allowing it to truly get to him.
If there was anything any alpha was drawn to, it was how good an omega is around any pup. It was some kind of a sign for a potential and perfect mate.
Anna folded her arms along her chest, pushing out her jaw, “Castiel will not satisfy you Dean! He is still a child and cannot provide you any pleasure I can!” She knew that using the
He could practically see her mulling things over in her mind, before she asked, “We’re not talking about Dean Winchester…right? Because, if i remember correctly, he was the only one you had a secret crush on in high school.”
Dean was more than happy to follow his omega. Both ignoring the shrieks of Anna. When they got to the top of the stairs, Castiel closed the basement door, reached for the key hanging on the hook, and locked it shut. Castiel finally released a deep breath, but there were no regret nor tears. His omega just fell into his arms and held him. He rubbed Cas back, “you ok, hon?”
The Winchester’s had accepted Castiel wholeheartedly. But, not only them, for the whole of the kingdom did too as Deans precious mate. And because of this acceptance, life was easy and tolerable in the castle. The omega and alpha’s life was filled with adventures and copious amounts of lovemaking.
With those words John Winchester arose from his seat and left his stunned silent son to mull things over in his head.
It didn’t matter if Cas (or James?) biological parents were standing before them. The fact of the matter was, every single one of these white wolves, were nothing but strangers in his eyes. It seemed that Cas was on guard too- sticking close to his side, tone still questioning and eyes staring down the pack before them with mistrust.
“I’m sorry, Dean. But, Castiel is infertile. You will be taking up the Winchester Pack title in a few year time, but before that, you need an heir!”
Dean looked subdued, “Ok, Castiel. Come find me in Pack lands. I won’t be going anywhere.” And maybe that did sound good that Dean wasn't just going to up and leave at the first sign of trouble.
He was Winchester-Alpha-Ready to serve and honor his heartbroken mate, he was ready to make it up to his mate, till the day he breathed his last.
Castiel knew he had to keep his cool, otherwise the omega would be doomed under another slave traders hands. He held in his temper and walked up to the bodyguard, “Give him to me. I’ll carry him to the vehicle”.
between the two boys (so unlikely in nature), that made both Mary and John feel that this talk was very much needed.
Gabe giggled and for once sounded happy. Yeah, hearing Gabriel happy was all that mattered right now.
Whatever this was, he was torn between feelings of anxiety and excitement. Surprisingly, more of the latter!
He just lay there on his back, naked, a little horny with his thighs parted, while his alpha did all the work, surprisingly making him come twice before he was spilling inside him.
Castiel seemed to know what was coming, moaning out loud and spreading his thighs further apart. They kissed and nipped as Dean playfully rubbed the head of his leaking cock up and down that furled wet hole. He braced himself up on one hand by Cas head, glancing into the omegas blown blue eyes. His voice raspy with sex as he panted out, “You sure you’re ready for my cock and knot, baby.”
During high school, when Jimmy was picked up in this Impala; he would sit by his bedroom window, stare and let his mind wonder. Judging by the way Jimmy’s eyes would light up, the way his brother would start laughing and bobbing his head to loud Metallica playing from the car stereo- he would say that the ride was pretty damn awesome.
Well, he won’t tell anyone, including his dad, that he had orgasmed hard, to Cas on his mind.  It even took him a lot not to let Cas name fall out his lips as he released cum into the artificial omega hole- somehow picturing Cas face. God forbid if anyone found out.
by the hands. The man groaned, “Red, come on! I can’t play pool, even to save my life!” However, the red head managed to get the man up and dragging his feet towards the pool tables.
Therefore, he sat his son down a week back and asked him about how he would feel if daddy brought home someone he could call papa. To say the kid was enthusiastic was an understatement. Nevertheless, his baby was ok with the idea of having a papa.
He had cooked from scratch: grilled steak, salt and vinegar potato wedges, tangy carrot slaw and the for dessert a freshly baked apple pie.
Dean had travelled this labyrinth of stone tunnels ever since he could learn how to independently transform into a werewolf-
. The rest of the day at work went without hindrance. And, to add to his excitement, Dean had assigned him a nickname. He wished he could stop blushing then, but, he couldn’t control it. And maybe he was hallucinating when he saw Dean redden up some, but, yeah, he’d just shut up about it.
Cas chuckled warmly, his free hand, covering one of his that was resting on the man’s tummy. Cas laid his head back into his shoulder, stretching out that fine neck that his eyes were drawn to- making his mouth water- with the want of sucking hickeys into it. Maybe, someday, he would.
. He didn’t think he could watch Dean loving on his sister Anna again- heck it’s hard enough to see the man still buried in his sister at this very moment-
His heart beat so fast as he watched the omega strip naked, exposing that flawless unmarked skin. His cock twitched at the sight of the omega laying down on his back and spreading those thighs apart to reveal that beautiful pink treasure between.
“Dean found a pup by the Wicker Streams. It was alone”. He added, “Mary, we need to take the pup back. Its mother might be looking for it”.
Again, it was quiet as Dean just gave out chesty purrs of warmth. Yeah, he loved those and Dean knew he loved those too. Those purrs vibrated through his entire body making him feel calm.
The pool balls scattered and he managed to pocket a stripe pool ball. He grinned, “Yours is the solid pool ball. Go on. Take a hit. Give it a try”.
He promised he wouldn’t cry on his big brother’s wedding day. But, seeing Castiel so happy…..smiling brightly….looking so beautiful and in love…made those tears he was trying to hold back come sliding down his cheeks.
The intensity of Cas stare and the fact that they were standing a mere foot apart, had him feeling all tingly, giddy- swallowing the lump in his throat. He found himself unconsciously thumbing Cas cheek in circles, “Well, you’re welcome, Cas”.
He smiled sleepily and dug his fingers into the little omegas fur. His voice strained as he said, “Little omega, wake up. You’re suffocating me.” Though, he could push the omega off or roll onto his side, so that the omega fell unto the mattress;
Gabe proceeded to cut perfect triangular pieces of pie, commenting, “you know, many of our townsfolk actually have started trying out Dean’s establishment. And from what I’ve heard, the pies and coffee are outstanding”.
Castiel frowned in a slightly amused manner, a pink blush climbing his cheeks, murmuring, “Dean, did you not hear a word I just said?”
Midway up the stairs, he morphed into his tiny omega wolf. His stupid white furred omega wolf that was not as pretty as Lisa’s chocolate furred omega wolf. With tears running down his snout, he found his way into his bedroom, somehow managing to shut the door behind him.
Mary clasped at her heart, “Oh John. Do you think Dean will bring this special someone to the castle soon? I sure would like to meet this boy or girl that has captured our son’s heart.”
Cas had this beautiful twinkle in his blue eyes as he smiled. The man picked up his burger and commented, “And, maybe you can show me a few great takeout joints in Lawrence?” The man bit into his burger humming in delight and eyeing his cheese burger with adoration. “I swear this is like a bite of heaven”.
Soon, both lycan and vampire were losing themselves again in their heightened states of want and pleasure.
He couldn't bare to feel and see his omegas pain, the nights after he had sex with Anna on every yearly visit. So, as much as it tested his self restraint to engage in sexual activities- he had decided to stop all encounters with Anna. There was also the other reason, Anna had also found her true mate, but had seemed to form an addiction with him instead.
He choked into his pillow, ‘He won’t Gabriel. How will he love someone who is littered in scars and has a limp in his walk because of a lifelong knee injury?'
Sex was a Lycan and vampire addiction, apart from tearing people to pieces and draining people of blood. The vampire and lycan were now frotting slow and good.
He somehow felt that asking this question would only upset him further, but, his curiosity got the better of him, “Um- that’s a good thing…right? You thinking of me when you were going through your difficult situation. That’s normal….right?”
Sam itched to stomp over to the Milton’s and give that no good Lucifer a punch and a piece of mind. Damn did it take all his willpower not to. He didn’t want to make anything worse. Not for Gabe and not for Dean and Castiel too. With trembling hands he typed out a reply.
Sam wished he could be with his babe too. Well guess the next best thing would be to call and say it over the phone. So, instead of replying via text he dialed Gabe’s number and within two rings the omega picked up.
He turned to his boys as he neared the council chambers, a massive hall in the middle of Winchester Pack lands, meeting his boys wandering eyes, “Listen here pups. I want you to tell them all you know and most importantly the truth, ok?”
And, yeah. He didn’t know who made the first move. All that mattered was their lips had finally met.
Call him self centered, he couldn’t help but get hooked on one word ‘Beauty’. He found himself asking with a fluttering heart, “You think I’m beautiful?”
Gabe whimpered and braced himself for the painful blow, when he heard the growl of his alpha mate, Sammy, followed by the words, “DON’T YOU DARE TOUCH HIM YOU MURDEROUS PIECE OF SHIT!”
Their short lovemaking had turned into a long one. They were supposed to be headed to John Winchester’s lair, but found themselves distracted with each other, once again.
It started with glorious smells emanating off each other in the morning. Those amazing scents sent both alpha and omega into a sexual high. Dean couldn’t help but push himself into Castiel’s wet hole that morning, right on their bed, immediately starting up a firm rhythm. It didn’t take long for both to orgasm hard, knotted once more.
Honestly, he never really expected their relationship to last that long. At first, it was just a hook up or rebound sex. Then, rebound sex turned into late night booty calls, which then somehow led to dates and moving in after a year. It wasn’t until the 3rd year of their relationship that Dean noticed the controlling behavior and the abruptness. But, like a dumbass, he stayed.
He was tired, he was sweating through his clothes, his feet felt like they were swollen by the time they reached their stop for the night. Luckily they weren’t traveling too fast and stopped for food and water along the way otherwise he would probably be dragged on the dirt because he wouldn’t be able to walk anymore.
This time his smile grew genuine and true. “Of course sweetheart. I would love it if we cuddled.” He winked, “I call dibs on being the bigger spoon though.”
Dean had gotten so accustomed to her body and touches that he was practically leaking. His cock twitched in anticipation, wanting to be buried deep inside that moist hole he knew did wonders to him- his eyes fluttering as pleasure climbed within him.
Dean was the first to speak, slightly breathing hard, “Um- you smell real fucking good, Cas.” The alpha then rubbed the back of his neck with his hand.
That’s how they both ended up standing before Jimmy’s tombstone. There was a fine warm breeze blowing into their faces and the sweet scent of the white roses floated through the air. He and Dean found themselves leaning into each other’s sides, as if seeking some comfort and warmth. He felt safe enough to say, “Jimmy meant the world to you, Dean”.
And behind John stood four other wiser older looking wolves and even more awesome was Sam who stood by Gabe and a good 30 or so Winchester warrior wolves. All looking ready to maim and kill for the protection of their own.
Castiel was feeling hot and extremely unsettled. He was leaking like crazy from his hole and his cock refused to stay limp- erect, throbbing and red. This time he was in his bath water. He tried fingering himself and it felt so damn good, making him moan out loudly into the bath space. He tried jerking himself while working three fingers into his throbbing hole- it wasn’t long before his head fell back, crying out loud as he orgasmed hard. Yet, it still wasn’t enough.
’ but, maybe later. He was conflicted whether to reach out and rest a hand on the omegas trembling hands or not. He settled for just sticking to his boundaries and soothingly saying, “It’s ok, Dean. I won’t take you to the hospital, if you don’t want. But on one condition only”.
And Cas did try to mimic the way he positioned himself, before taking aim and hitting the cue ball, which got it flying into the air and falling off the pool table, hitting the wooden floor with a loud clack. He watched the blue eyed man fold into himself, looking utterly embarrassed, “I’m sorry Dean. I freaken suck!”
He glanced around to see his father obviously clueless to the telepathic conversation between the two forest alphas. He met Gabe's eyes and watched his bother tap a finger unto his own temple.
As they passed a orchid filled meadow, he had a sense of déjà vu, like he’d been here before. Like he had run in these very fields with that
A/N: I am so sorry for posting up very late. To be honest, my spark for writing had slowly dimmed out when I lost my father early last year. He always believed in my writing- no matter what I wrote and he was someone who was always keen to hear about my stories. I had started slowly pulling away from something I loved- writing. And yeah, it’s been hard to type up words for the stories I love.
The dreadful thing that still plagues his mind was the fact that he did see some troubling signs that Jimmy may have needed serious help, but, refused to acknowledge it and just chucked it down to his possible envy of the popularity status his brother held.
“Ok Dean”. Castiel eyes glanced at him in innocent wonder, which kind of made him hot under the collar. The man replied with a smile, “Have a great day, Dean”.
Dean had thought of how his husband had cried himself to sleep last night. He trembled in his arms unable to contain his emotions any longer. It was too much for Castiel.
He was enjoying this moment with Dean. Whilst, they snuggled, he couldn’t help but let his mind drift to everything else in his life.
It was quiet for a while. He just studied Gabe: the man looking like he wanted to say something more and in deep contemplation. This was a familiar habit he saw every year before Gabe attended the annual meet- it saddened him, because he knew what Gabe was going to ask him- the same question the younger wolf would ask him every year.
He watched as Anna's powerful orgasm drove Dean to the edge, making the alpha pound erratically into Anna, crying out his release into her soaking cunt. He watched as both shivered and held each others sweaty bodies- and from this angle- he felt they were sharing breathy kisses.
He enjoyed the comfort of Dean’s chesty purrs. It rattled his body and pleased his omega wolf. Despite all that was going on- he felt blanketed in safety and love, at this moment. That’s all he needed from Dean.
The blonde omega chuckled and placed his hand into his, “Hello Dean, it’s a pleasure to meet Sammy’s big brother.”
He wondered what was so important to discuss, that lunch had to wait. He could have protested that they grab something to eat first, but, the looks on Dean and Castiel’s faces screamed urgency. So, here they were; him, Mary and Sam (who Dean insisted join) were now seated in the sofa of their living room. He nearly smiled at the linked hands of Dean and Castiel as they sat side by side on the sofa opposite to theirs, however, the nervous energy pouring out the young alpha and omega mates was enough to divert his attention.
“Yeah. I missed you.” He timidly replied. When Dean didn’t say anything further, he felt his heart squeeze. “Are you upset with me that I cried?”
Castiel chuckled at his lovers childishness. He leaned in and brushed his lips gently against Dean’s in a feathery light kiss, murmuring, “I do love all of you, Dean".
He smiled and continued cutting the sides of the ham and cheese sandwiches he had prepared for family lunch. He was just setting up the sandwiches on plates, when an unfamiliar scent caught his nose. One that was intermingled with his oldest child’s.
The way Castiel looked up at him as if with stars in his eyes made everything a little more sweeter.
A/N: Dean is 14 years old in this chapter. Cas is 10 years old. This is 5 years ahead from the time Cas was 5 years old.
Now, he was losing Dean to the societal expectations of higher education. Specifically, to an all alpha college, a few states away. He felt hopeless as Dean told him that he’d be popping in on important holidays only and that they’d skype or face time too.
It was like he was drawn to the alpha. He couldn't help himself. He wished that he had much stronger willpower- so that he could avoid witnessing what he saw, next.
He ran his tongue along his bottom lip, heart skipping a beat, as he watched Dean follow the movement briefly before dragging those green eyes back up to meet his blues. He looked for something to say-
He walked through his lonely front lawn, up the stairs of his front porch. He had his hand on the door knob, ready to open his front door, when a foreign yet pleasant scent caught his nose. He stood frozen on the spot, wondering just who was lurking somewhere behind him.
He watched as Cas closed his eyes in contentment, the man’s face contorting into one of absolute bliss- as he took the first bite of his cheese burger. Castiel hummed in delight, “Oh my God! This makes me very happy”.
And for some reason, he knew, this is exactly what Cas needed right now. To feel the presence of his alpha, to know this is all real and that he is loved.
The Broodmaster’s, a vicious werewolf family, reigned over the werewolves- after William had been slaughtered by the vampires. And, to this day remained an important ally to the Lycans.
A sweet romance they had and despite the years of heartache Sam’s older alpha brother had put him through-
The thing Castiel liked about this family time was that all the Winchester men listened intently to everything Gem said, as well as, interacted with the pup whenever they had to. Castiel concluded that the little one had all the Winchester alphas wrapped around his tiny omega fingers. Now, Castiel felt himself slowly falling into that trap. The pup was contagious.
For the first time he saw the omega look at him with this aura of surprise. Cas asked almost quietly, “Was…as in…no longer?”
The omega could only brace himself up on his forearm, studying the alphas moonlit touched face. He was looking for any signs of trickery, but, he ended up not finding a damn thing. All he was met with was Dean’s serious gaze and a small nervous smile.
And so Dean did give his omega more. The rest of the day was spent tied together, having a short meal break before getting back to making love on every surface of their bedroom. Their heat and rut filled day soon stretched into a whole week of unashamed lovemaking. Somehow, the entire palace knew not to disturb them, and the King ordered that food be sent to the mated pairs room…no disturbances!
Gabriel stood close to him, running his eyes over Castiel’s sexy black suit and tie, all the way up that delicious neck and finally up to bore into those amazing blue eyes. Castiel was always attractive and any vamp would desire to have this blue eyed, dark haired, tall beauty as their mate for life
Hello, he could be talking to a client. Someone barging in wouldn’t be so kind and would only reflect on the company’s lack of professionalism.
He shook his head, “No Cas. Even then, it ain’t right and I still won’t do it!” He knew something had to be done after a long night buried in someone he didn’t love, whilst, at the expense of hurting his own true mate. So he made a tough call, “Cas I have a plan”.
So he blurted, “Cas, you don’t have to say yes. All will still be well. But,….truth is, you make me feel things…good things that I’ve never felt with anyone before. Not, even with your brother, Jimmy. And being around you, makes me happy. And, every time, I want more. I can’t stop thinking about you! Your smile, your beautiful eyes, your voice, and everything else that comes with you”. He rubbed a hand down his face, “You’re an amazing person Cas. One of a kind. And, I can’t let the fact that you mean something wonderful to me, go. Someone told me that I needed to seize the day- so, here I am, seizing it”.
Castiel knew where Dean was coming from. They were going to return back to the Novak manor. The omega probably thought the worst.
They drove around, passing parks, buildings and a few wonderful sceneries. He saw that they were nearing the cemetery Jimmy was buried in, so, he found himself asking- out of the blue, “Can we stop over and see Jimmy, Dean?”
Castiel chuckled, “Of course I would love to come see the bees with you, Kaylen. It would be my pleasure.”
Sam offered his brother a genuine smile and clap on his back, “Good for you Dean. I’m happy for you. And not to mention Kaylen seems to be in love with Cas too, so that’s a great indication that Castiel is the perfect mate for you. Lord knows that kid is very skeptical when it comes to people he just meets.”
A/N: Eeek! Don't kill me for the cliffhanger, please! I promise I'll update soon my lovelies! But, just to keep the suspense, you know somethings about to go down!
Cas voice was raspy and breathless, as he stuttered, “D-Dean? Um…wow! You’re here. W-When did y-you arrive?” Totally sounding off.
He chuckled warmly. “I see. I’ll go put these in a vase, then, I’ll be out.” He stepped to the side, “Do you want to come in?”
“That’s a promise ring". Dean held up his hand, showing the exact same designed ring on his finger, but only bigger. “I have one too. A promise that my heart belongs to you. Forever". Dean gestured, “Put it on".
Chuck growled behind his fake smile, “Careful what you say, Gabriel. You know I don’t tolerate disobedience.”
He remembered when he was a tiny pup and momma used to pull Sammy and he into her furry underbelly, to keep them warm from the cold or all the nasties. He turned and curled into the alpha wolf, burying his face underneath the alphas furry chin, curling his fingers into the thick fur.
He would blurt out in annoyance, “He still could have made time for us, Sam! He still could have, at least, spent the last 2 Christmas holidays with us, Sam!” He holds up a hand as Sam tries to speak once more, halting the alphas words. “Enough! Sam! I’m not going to talk further about any of this!” He turns to walk away, but, stops in his tracks when Sam says so softly.
’. But, she knew just how to nag at him, and, he always gave up- with that pout! He released an unimpressed huff, before he grabbed the cue stick being offered to him. “Fine! But, if I’m going to make a fool of myself, then, you might as well buy me my next beer!”
His attention was drawn to his friends, taking a long sip of his beer, before he shrugged, “I just…I needed to get my head right…is all guys. I’m sorry if y’all only heard from me over the phone”. He clicked his tongue, raising his beer bottle before him, “but hey, I’m here now!”
He just wanted to get back to Cas who was waiting for him in the living room. He wanted to cuddle the man, watch a movie or talk….and maybe, slip in a few kisses. He smiled at the latter.
To divert his mind, he cleared his throat loudly earning a startled gasp from Castiel who dropped what he was doing to look at him with wide eyes and reddened sun kissed cheeks.
He felt dirty and sick when their soul bonds ignited that night, not because of his mate, but because of the scent of his girlfriend lingering around him. He wanted to scrub himself clean!
“Why are you speaking that wretched half breeds name here, Gabriel, before these splendid alpha wolves!”
Their lovemaking didn’t stop there. Dean refused to pull out, instead carrying Castiel to their bed,, laying his omega down on their ruffled sheets,  pressing his omega into their cum stained sheets and fucking the pleading omega deep and hard once more.
A/N: I would be curious to know your thoughts on how you think Dean and Cas will meet? Or who will point Dean towards Cas? 😁
He wanted to stay stubborn, but, he always liked Dean’s presents, so he reached out and accepted the the gift from Dean. He didn’t intend for their fingers to brush, but it did, and both couldn’t help but gasp at the tingling sensations crawling up their fingers and arms. He watched the alpha blush hard, clearing his throat.
In secret, they would make vicious love, on red velvet sheets. Bite marks and bruises would heal in no time. Dean, the eldest son of the great alpha John and Castiel, the eldest son of the great elder Michael, would find their naked bodies entwined in the most intimate of ways.
Time to get things in here sorted. She was not going to let the Milton Pack alpha get away with these despicable crimes against omegas. Not as long as she’s living and breathing!
Dean suddenly huffed in clear annoyance, “Cas, you need to grow up!” Then, Dean went on to sneer out, without meeting his eyes, “Christ you’re such a needy, whiny omega! It’s freaken suffocating!”
Mary twirled her finger in the air, “And, who is that behind you, sweetheart. Surely, he must come forward so your father and I can see him proper.”
That’s why, two days after the basement incident, Castiel and a supportive Dean went over to their doctors office to get examined. Well, Castiel was the one who was going to get examined to see if there was still a chance to conceive any time soon.
Castiel felt the anger draining out of him. Dean had a point. A war between the two species would likely start from his family or because of any harm that comes to his family. The Novak’s were of more importance than the Milton’s. He stepped back and released the hold on his lovers lapels. He watched as Dean sucked in deep breaths, before meeting his eyes. Castiel folded his arms along his chest, “Now what, hmm? Because, I don’t want to keep this from your father, Dean. I’m sure he can make an exception for our love!”
Finally, last week, he had had enough after he caught Anna snooping around his phone and making plans on his behalf, whilst shutting out his friends meetup sessions. He had ended things in the most kindest way he could- which only drove Anna into screaming at him- he then packed his bags, and left Austin.
Castiel, once more, was in awe. The more he found out about the forest wolves, the less respectful he became for so called town elders, who fed them with lies whilst growing up.
Castiel’s heart once again swell for this considerate alpha. He felt a certain lightness and excitement slowly creep in. He responded with a resounding purr.
One of the old wolves of the Milton Council stepped up, “You will release the halfbreed, young alpha! The Milton Wolf Councils decision must be adhered to or else, you face punishment for non compliance!”
Dean gnawed at his bottom lip, looking as if he were thinking hard about what to say next. He had to hold his breath, because Dean still looked sad. The alpha nervously uttered, “No, Cas. It’s usually not a good thing to be thinking of your
“Uh! Whatever! Fact of the matter is, ELLEN CHOSE ME! Even though we are both alphas!” Bobby continued sounding proud.
Damn the vamp was real strong! And, highly pissed. Dean gripped his lovers wrists for some semblance of support and wheezed out, “Baby, I had no choice! It was only for the safety of both our families!”
It wasn’t that he missed his family, no. It was more to do with the fact that he missed the warmth and comfort his alpha provided. He was provided a fully furnished room of his own and allowed his own space to get comfortable.
Bobby couldn’t stop laughing after that, roaring into the air. But, just when he thought the fun had ended, Bobby had laughed too hard and released an unmistakable fart- that sounded even worse that Rufus failed attempt at a growl. A loud squeak.
He got up off the dining room chair and walked towards the window, grumbling out, “How respectable!”
Dean used the opportunity to thread his fingers into the dark hairs at the nape of Castiel's head, nudging the man into him, landing a solid, deep kiss onto his lovers eagerly compliant and hungry mouth. Both losing themselves in the addictive tastes of one another, soon moaning into each others mouths as their tongues danced in sweet embrace.
The jay bird was calling to his omega wolf to follow. Just as well, Dean had come to stand beside him, asking,
The town wolves had started to refer to him as The Dove Wolf. The omega wolves offered to the forest wolves to uphold peace and prosperity.
Clearly, Dean knew what he was doing, thumbing his hardened clit, increasing the pace of those delicious thick fingers dipping inside him. The alpha always made him discover something new about himself….and that maybe….maybe he was enjoying this a little too much. He felt his eyes stutter close, biting his bottom lip as he panted out, “Dean, I don’t know…mmmm…oh Gods!” He dipped his head back to expose his throat, suddenly feeling warm lips ghost up the nape of his neck, then the alpha began sucking the blood unto the surface of his skin right above his jugular. The words spilled out before he could stop it, “Mmm….Dean…..I want you now!”
He never felt more relieved when he shut the door to his home, sliding down to sit on the floor. He leaned his head back unto the wood, closed his eyes and took deep breaths to will his erratically beating heart to return to its normal rhythms.
He furrowed his brows, “Who’s here?” Before he could explore further, he heard a deep gruff voice calling out from behind them. He turned to find that it was none other than his beloveds big brother, making him glance back into the side of Castiel’s face, “Dean. Dean Winchester?”
He held his omega steady against him, laying a kiss atop the omegas head. This was perfect and he felt so complete in this moment. He fell asleep to Cas whispering sleepily, “Thank you, Dean.”
Ellen Harvelle spoke direct and firm, “Lucifer Milton, you are now held for the slaughter of the Novak packs innocent omegas and pups, 18 years ago. You will front the high wolf committee. You plus the alphas who participated , and are being seized as we speak, will now be sentenced to wolf imprisonment for your crimes.”
He was a male omega. There were no such things as male omegas truly. Male omegas were special because they were made….or modified to fit the exotic description of what a male omega would look like.
. He licked at the shell of his lovers reddening ears, twisting his fists repeatedly around their hard cocks, gaining a filthy moan out of Castiel. The alpha dirtily whispered into Castiel's ear, “We'll talk about it later, babe. Right now – oh fuck- I wanna take you apart on my cock!”
They were nearly to his BMW when Castiel froze in his tracks, which resulted in him stopping by his brother. He felt his brother shiver in his arms, breathing a little labored, so he asked, “Castiel what is it? What’s wrong?”
Napier and the other death dealers were taking too long. It has already been 4 hours and they haven’t brought Castiel back to him.
He swallowed the lump in his throat, gathering up his courage and responded a little on the faint side, “Ok. I’ll attend.”
Bobby sighed, “The accountant advised that its important to draw up contracts, as it safeguards the auto shop and the employee”.
All he could do was smile at the bonding pair, quiet and curious. The pair were seated on the couch, talking about the bees in his mom’s outdoor gardens, while nursing a glass each of chilled lemonade Mary had handed them upon entry.
Dean knew that the consummation of their mating could take place later, in private, but, the bite was important to be sighted by the alpha leaders of a pack as they would bare witness to this union. So, he turned his green wolf eyes to meet his omegas blues,
Rufus wanted to release a growl but instead sounded like a rusty broken piece of scrap metal squealing around here and there, with no business being on the roads except for the junk yard.
release a happy sound. Stupid omega! If only he didn’t make a pleasant sound, then Dean would have kissed him.
….in such a way…..when an alpha is going through his ruts.” Dean swallowed hard, “And, um….the dreams I had….of you and me….together….were not very
With a heavy heart, he watched Castiel walk away towards the direction of the field’s with a slump to his posture. So much for spending all his time, during his travels, getting to know his true mate.
Pam boldly reached for a piece of sliced apple from his platter, taking a bite and shrugging, “Well I’ve been a servant of the barbarian Winchester’s for quite a few years now and I must say, Dean has never treated an omega the way he treats you. He is a good alpha, once you get to know him. Right now, he’s just testing the waters.”
He ran, he ran to his parents, he cried to his father about his omega Castiel. He wanted to go back, pull the omega into his arms and say he was sorry, but he couldn’t. He remembered his father’s words to him that night.
The man before him was older- yes- with the much more prominent crows feet, a filled up fit body and a two day scruff. But, at the same time, he still held the same attributes that made him the teen boy, who had won his brother’s heart and made him secretly crush- the same grass green eyes, the same sandy blonde hair, the same pouty lips, the same freckles dusting the bridge of that perfect nose, heck even the same flannel and jean loving attire that was this man’s signature look.
Sam looked uncomfortable and nervous. The omega stuttered, “I wasn’t supposed to say, Gabe. Not until we are officially married.”
Castiel was beyond ecstatic when he found out, whereas Anna was beyond furious. Apparently, she still wanted Dean, despite discovering her true mate. She didn’t give a fuss about Dean's decision, instead tried to jump him before Castiel. She began rubbing his hard member through his clothes, whispering into Dean’s ear hotly, “I know you want to dip you cock deep into my soaking wet cunt, alpha".
A/N: I apologize for the delay in posting, there has been so much going on in life that I hardly have the time to follow up with my stories. I will try making an effort to make time for my stories from now onwards, I promise.
His heart squeezed as he took in his surroundings. The trees looked familiar, the patches of flowerbeds littered all around, looked familiar, the smell of the soothing scents of Lavender, Honey and Cocoa butter were familiar.
He swallowed thickly, eyes bashfully looking at a couple just a few feet from them, who were full on engaged in passionate intercourse, where the completely naked female omega was riding her equally exposed alpha whilst seated on that muscular lap- not a care in the world for anyone around them.
He wondered why though? There were high classed omegas such as Lisa Braeden and Abbadon Milton eyeing the green eyed alpha wolf with unmistakable hunger and interest. Surely, a man so handsome as Dean would be able to have anyone he wanted with a click of his fingers.
And come the omega did, multiple times, legs shaking and body vibrating hard, coating his cock and balls with slick.
Dean eyed him with a thankful smile; there was so much adoration bouncing off those green orbs. The man grabbed his hand that was rested atop the table, bringing it to those pouty lips and giving his knuckle a gentle kiss. “Thank you, Cas. This is perfect and smells heavenly. I can’t wait to try this delicious meal”.
. He asked, “do you mind if i guide you into the perfect position?” Christ his thoughts travelled to how naughty that sounded.

He was done with the disobedience of Castiel. By the end of tonight, Castiel would be warming his bed.
The blonde haired lady tilted her head to the side in curiosity, “Castiel? I swear I have heard that name mentioned once or twice in our house by one of our boys, John.”
In his heart, he already knew the best solution to this whole situation- but that would be for Cas and Dean to decide if/when they felt ready to.
Charlie ordered their buffalo chicken wings and beers. As they waited, Charlie asked, “So, you ok being here?”
10 years later, after jolting awake from another saddened dream- he asked why? Why did he have to be the one that found his brother? He rubbed a hand down his face, peering into the darkness of his room. He spared a glance at his digital clock sitting on his nightstand, seeing it read 4:00am and murmured, “I need a glass of water”.
As they panted hard, just holding on for dear life, Dean uttered unto Castiel’s lips, “I think we’re in a heat and rut babe. I’m still hard and you’re still leaking so good for me.”
They both sat on his bed, facing each other. He had his legs crossed and drawn to him, whilst Dean just hung one of his legs over the side of the bed and folded the other one in. They were both as comfortable as they could get for this conversation,
He finally registered and glanced worriedly into Deans worried eyes. He shakily asked, “Dean, what do we do?”
Then, he heard twigs creak as Dean approached. He frowned as he felt his omega wolf stir within him, for the first time ever since meeting the forest wolves. His body was reacting the wrong way-
Like he, Dean was casually dressed in a red plaid long sleeved shirt and black jeans with black boots. The man actually resembled the look of a bad boy- with a charming lopsided cheeky grin. He bit his bottom lip, seeing Dean follow the movement with those green eyes. He blushed hard, “Hey Dean. Welcome.” He stood to the side to allow Dean access in.
But then, things didn’t always go smoothly. Happiness only lasted for a brief time before Chuck Milton came knocking.
Apparently, he had nicked a nerve in the alpha. John could see it too, as Deans green eyes, flickered between red and green. The older alpha said, as soothingly as he could, “Dean, calm yourself.”
Now the idea of that stung. What if that were the case and he wasn’t just that good looking. All the treatment he had received from his peers and other wolves throughout the years spoke for itself.
Castiel was sitting not too far, eyes focused solely on the plate of food before him. When Dean didn’t think anyone was looking, he would spare a quick peek at Cas, before, diverting his attention back down to his plate, forking at a string of bacon. There was this undeniable, palpable, tension between the two.
“Why didn’t you tell me that Dean had gone to an Alpha Training Institution Sam? You only told me that he had to go do something important and that that was as far as you knew!”
was at the forefront of his mind. He itched to transform and run into the woods looking for these intruders.
Dean flushed nearly as red as the rose itself. The man couldn’t stop his toothy smile as he took the single rose from him, holding it to his heart and saying, “thank you, sweet angel”.
He shivered and finally released a whine as his alpha gripped his hips lightly, lips now whispering hot words into his ear with such gruffness. “Fuck Cas. You smell so good that I wanna eat you up.”
He knew it may be too soon to say this, but, he couldn’t hide it anymore. He wanted to let Cas know where he stood. “I’m in love with you.”
His tiny snout was clamped on the pups nape. The pup was swinging back and forth while he trot forward. There were times he’d accidentally drop the pup onto the leafy grounds. Those were the times he’d growl in puppy frustration.
Thinking of cuddling in Dean’s arms while watching a movie made him all gooey. Yeah. He looked forward to the rest of the night….and the small talk he wanted to have before the movie.
He wanted to join Dean, hackles on the rise. He was however, nearly falling off balance, when he saw
He pretended to busy himself with his computer, just so he didn’t have to sit there, looking like a damn fool, whilst Dean read his contract. He was scrolling through last months financial records, when Dean suddenly calmly uttered, “Your eyes are different from your brothers”.
The full moon was up and bright enough to cast a magical glow onto the surfaces of the water, adding to what the lights from the festival provided. There were a lot of stars up tonight, glowing bright. There was a warm night breeze brushing both their faces. It was peaceful here, serene, even though it was dark. He just enjoyed the warmth of Castiel in his arms.
He has thought of kissing those damn lips, every damn day since the bar. Seize the day, right. So, he dragged his eyes back up to meet Cas lightly blown pupils, admitting so softly, “Cas, I really want to kiss you right now.”
Again, the choice was Cas’s too. Dean was not going to force Cas into anything he felt uncomfortable doing. He wasn’t a controlling alpha and believed in balance.
He watched as both Dean and Castiel glanced briefly at one another, hands tightening their hold. Then, Dean nodded at Castiel, before the young alpha’s eyes fell back on him (hesitation in those green orbs he dearly loved). “Dad, Cas and I- uh- we ran into a few wolves during our hike through the woods, today.”
“Oh John. Leave the pup here. You go scout out the woods and if you find the pups parents, then you can invite them over to come get their pup. It’s going to be getting cold soon and I don’t think it wise to be carrying a very tiny pup around when temperatures drop”.
He was out doing some gardening with little Kaylen and Mary when he spotted them. His heart began to beat loudly in his throat when he saw the disgusted look his uncle aimed at him.
He had tried to find his own mate, which his parents allowed him time too, but, he just didn’t appeal to any. Lisa was fantastic in bed, but didn’t know a damn thing about respect. Anna was a sweetheart, but only to a limit before she turned into this overly possessive freak. And the list went on…
As he got nearer, Dean’s leather and whiskey scent, smacked him hard on the face. It was so strong and reeking of something else- something that made his heart pound faster and his omega squirm. There was this feeling in his lower tummy, but, it came and went, repeatedly.
Neither he nor Dean had spoken much as they made their way back to the Winchester Pack encampment. Both were lost in deep thoughts it seemed, mulling over the surprising events and revelations they had just encounted.
Charlie blushed and sweetly said, “oh please, call me Charlie or Red!” She had the nerve to spare him a peek, wink at him, before saying, “Have fun learning, Cassie!” Before, she was walking over to the bar like she hadn’t just left her best friend to the wolves.
Cas decided to turn his head towards him, eyes peering into his and whispering, “Nothings wrong, Dean. It’s just…I miss your warmth.”
A year. Dean and Cas had a year- and damn he would try to get Cas pregnant. Even if they were unsuccessful, no one could ever rob him of Cas or vice versa. He murmured into his mate’s hair, “No one will take me away from you, Cas. You are my true mate and we will find a damn way, no matter what”.
His eyes shot up to meet Dean’s searching ones. He shouldn’t probe any further or he might just hear something he doesn’t like. But, his curiosity got the better of him. He asked in an almost barely there voice, “How so?”
Gabe didn’t hide his dislike for her. His omega huffed, “You know, she asked about your brother Dean?”
Cas was silent. He could feel the omegas scent sadden. He tried to reach out with his alpha within to soothe its omega.
Castiel was completely concentrated on helping his omega into the Novak’s lavish mansion, that he forgot about the welcome party that was awaiting their arrival. A welcome party that contained two muscular, mean looking alpha guards and his big brother, Michael. Usually, they would abruptly secure the omega slave and drag him/her kicking and screaming into the cold, filthy, caged cells- located in the basements. That would usually be the omegas place of lodging until they died- after being used up thoroughly, of course.
He could hear Charlie’s barely audible gasp. He couldn’t blame her when his own heart started to beat erratically-
Castiel sucked Dean’s bottom lip between his own, feeling the pleasant electricity flow through that act. Again, his hole throbbed hard around his alphas still hard cock. Both unable to hold back on grinding into each other. This time, Dean’s knot grew thicker inside his omegas hole, cock spurting out more streams of cum into the drenched omega. Castiel released Dean’s lip, throwing his head back and howling at how good it felt to be filled so full. “Mmm. Oh Dean! Yes! More!...Please give me more!”
Anyway, his thoughts be damned. It just didn’t matter and maybe Pam was just over analyzing and wrong. Yup, she was definitely wrong! Nevertheless, he had to get up and do as his barbarian alpha commanded.
And, they would talk about these feelings and actions, but, not now. Now, they enjoyed the company and warmth of each other.
He was lucky enough that Dean hadn’t hit him yet….because he learned that keeping your mouth shut and doing as you’re told is the only best option of staying alive.
. Steak, any potato dish, gravy, and apple pies (yeah he figured Dean loved apple pies, having witnessed how the man guzzled the pastry at the festival with so much joy). Ellen was smiling cheekily at him, gushing over him and saying, “Oh I’m so thrilled that you boys are boyfriends!”
John was the first to speak up. “Boys, there’s a few things your mother and I would like to talk to you about.” The great alpha leader continued, “However, before we get into our discussions, I want to ask, how both of you doing so far?”
Gabriel complained, whined and grumbled, but eventually pouted and settled with Sam’s reason. He knew how important it was for Sam to learn how to be a proper alpha, particularly from his father. So, yeah the white lie Sam had created had fooled his boyfriend.
Oh that was the final straw for Castiel. Dean watched in sudden shock when his omega lover stomped toward Anna, grabbed a fistful of her red hair and dragged her kicking and screaming, towards the basement. “Let me go, you psycho!”
Now, Lucifer looked to do more damage, not caring that it was before everyone else that lived in the mansion. The alpha raised his belt in the air, ready to deliver some blows to the pathetic omega of a son. “You omegas are a good for nothing waste of space. You deserve nothing but pain and suffering!”
He peered at the screen and his grumpiness flew out the window, to be instantly replaced with a huge smile. Only one person could make him smile like that- well there were originally two-
Missouri’s Flower Shop was always open before any of the city’s stores, markets and supermarkets in Lawrence. 7:00am and Missouri was turning the sign to ‘
And, in his heart, he knew he was never going to fall out of love with Dean. In his heart, he knew that no one would compare to Dean. In his heart, he knew that Balthazar was only someone special who filled that hole in his heart- after Dean had left for college. Now, Dean was back, that hole was once again replaced by Dean.
Bobby shrugged, whilst Ellen commented while busy washing the dishes. “He means well. A shy man with a heart of gold. Hard to find his types nowadays”.
And so, Dean did as he was told, shoving himself deep into Castiel. The alpha roared as his knot got securely locked inside the omega, cock suddenly jerking hard to release loads of cum inside it’s omega. That seemed to throw Castiel over the edge as the omegas back bowed, the omega scratched down Dean’s back as he came hard and screaming, painting their tummies with cum and coating Dean’s pulsing cock with waves of omega juices.
The Winchester wolves were known to be bigger, faster and much more built than your average alpha wolf. They came from very strong bloodlines and perfect genes that were passed down from generation to generation. It was hard to miss their aura and presence whenever they were around.
He sat between Grandma and Castiel, in his high chair. He dug into his pancakes, it was so yummy that he was humming in delight. When he finished, he thanked grandma for the lovely pancake. Daddy always says ‘
His heart hurt so much as he remembered every rejection he had faced growing up, every ridicule, every twisted comment by an alpha who looked at him as if he were crap.He repeated the words they assaulted him with,
“Cassie, even if I hadn’t said anything or told Dean about the omega with the apple pie scent, I am positively sure that he would have still found you!” He shrugged and hugged Castiel once more, “He would have followed his alpha nose- they are very sensitive to smell big bro. That’s why alpha noses are so ginormous.”
Nothing captivated him more in his life till date than the gorgeous hunk of an Adonis who seemed to be busy chatting up a slightly shorter 6 foot tall sandy blonde haired alpha, standing by the water fountain. Both wolves were well built and looked stronger than any other alpha he had seen, which could only mean that they were Winchester wolves.
He laid out a slice each on their plates and dug in. Dean was now moaning obscenely. The man couldn’t help but blurt out, “Damnit Cas! This pie is actually better than moms!” Dean quickly added, “But, don’t tell her I said that.”
Dean smiled fondly at Cas- whose blue eyes drifted down to meet Deans- a soft smile playing on his lips. Of course, Dean had to add, “I miss running beside you, Cas.”
Suddenly, there was a strong alphas voice- like the one he heard in his head- but a little rickety and cracked, swimming through his mind,
“You’re welcome, Cas”. He cleared his throat and said, “I enjoyed your company too”. He licked his lips and shyly muttered, “We should do this again. Lunch or dinner? Maybe, um- dinner, somewhere?”
Both Lycan and Werewolf carried the bloodline of the first Werewolf, William. However, Lycans weren’t directly linked to the main source. Instead, werewolves were- those that were bitten by William himself. The first Lycan was born out of a female werewolf- whose whatever little human gene- had been able to formulate a human child to grow inside her womb.
