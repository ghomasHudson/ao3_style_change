And maybe Dean is right, maybe he was right to save Ruby, right to let me lose myself again even if it was just so he could bring Cas back. At my worst, I could exorcise demons, save their victims. At my best, I killed Alastair, Grand Torturer of Hell. Maybe with enough, now, I could take on Chuck.
“I am, but we didn’t have to…” Castiel lifts his head off the bed.
“Does this feel different?” Dean brings himself up to Castiel’s face.
“I don’t know. Losing my mind, maybe. What are you doing here?” Sam digs his feet into the dirt to stop the movement.
I’m shaking, from cold and from fear, and Ruby puts her hand over mine. Ruby tells me that its close, that it will be here soon, that Jack made it loud and the Empty is doing everything it can, just to sleep again. And it can’t sleep with me, a fading dead angel, stuck here.
Dean lifts the sleeve of his jacket. “Do it,” he says.
And when Dean is asleep, Castiel doesn’t move, even though he could slip away, anywhere else. He could vanish, to some other corner of the Earth and Dean would never know. But there’s nowhere else, that Castiel would feel like this. Nowhere else where he can close his eyes, and pray to a God he knows long deserted everything, pray that Heaven would just release him forever. Pray that he could fully belong here, fully belong to Dean.
Dean starts to close the door, but Castiel calls him back, without thinking about why. Dean locks the door behind him. He stands there, listening to the sound of the rushing water, staring at his reflection in the mirror, at the reddish-blue circles underneath his eyes, at a reflection that’s worn, exhausted, done.
“I just want to be free, from this, from everything.” Dean puts his head back down, half on the pillow, half on Castiel’s shoulder. “Whatever. I don’t know why I’m telling you this right now.”
Eileen pours the contents of a water bottle over the fire, until the last of the embers burn out.
Castiel wipes his hand on his trench coat and runs his fingers along Dean’s chin and mouth. Dean rolls his head along Castiel’s shoulder, as Castiel wraps both his arms around him, burying his face against Dean’s. Castiel could let the rest of the world be lost, Raptured, and it wouldn’t matter, because Dean is his, for now.
“Being normal, that’s what I always wanted, from the minute I realized that Dean and I weren’t normal at all. When, you know, I realized, other kids didn’t get dragged around and left in shitty motels while their fathers hunted ghosts,” Sam leans forward on the bench. “But, there were times, I thought—why would I ever want to just be normal? I thought it wasn’t for me, I guess. Sometimes, I thought I had been crazy—what was I thinking, when I was a kid? Becoming a lawyer, living behind some white picket fence. Sometimes that sounded more like a nightmare than the one I was living. But then I brought you back and being normal—that’s all I want.”
Last night on Earth. And Castiel deserves this, deserves something he’s never had, deserves Dean. “Right, and then I die.”
Lisa pulls her robe across her, and steps in front of Castiel, before closing herself in the bathroom. Castiel can hear her, using the toilet, washing her hands, brushing her teeth. And he hates her, hates himself, hates every decision he’s ever made, that’s led him here, to fucking himself in a bedroom corner, to sitting here covered in his own cum, to staring up at Dean Winchester’s body as he searches for his boxer shorts.
In the shadows of Lisa’s bedroom, Castiel closes his eyes and listens. He’s convinced himself that if he just listens, that this is all okay. He listens to the sound of Dean’s lips against Lisa’s body, to the sound of Dean groaning as Lisa takes him into her mouth, to the sound of Dean’s face in between Lisa’s legs. He listens to the sound of Dean pushing himself inside her, to the way she tells him how good he feels, to the way Dean’s skin slams into hers.
The sidewalk is broken underneath Dean’s footsteps, tree roots pushing concrete into sharp hills. Along U.S Route 6, the sound of wet grass is muffled by the passing tires of pick-up trucks and minivans. And beyond a set of train tracks, there’s a strip mall, a bar, a store with a “Going Out of Business” poster taped to the window. There’s a 24-hour diner, a man with tangled white hair and a torn sleeping bag leaning against the brick façade of convenience store, a woman bending into the window of a white BMW, exchanging a small bag with folded cash that the driver drops into her hands.
Chuck sits across from me and turns the cereal box toward him. He reads the side panel, “You know, maybe you should eat a little healthier now that you’re…human.” He shoves a handful of cereal into his mouth. “And it doesn’t even taste good.”
“Yes.” As she speaks, Jack can tell she’s struggling to admit it.
Because, from the minute I stole Dean’s soul from Hell, I needed him, wanted him, all of him, in a way I didn’t understand.
And Dean knows that maybe he shouldn’t believe anything that Castiel tells him, that maybe this is all part of God’s plan. That maybe this is just Castiel’s way of indoctrinating him, forcing him onto the side of the angels.
“I don’t know what I mean, forget it,” Dean says.
“Thanks, I guess.” I remember how once, I trusted her. I thought she wanted to help me, help me save Dean. Everything about her, and everything she ever said was a lie. So I don’t know why I believe her now.
Dean closes his eyes, so there’s nothing, nothing but darkness, nothing but the feeling of Castiel rolling him back and forth against his throat, nothing but the feeling of Castiel’s face in his thighs. And Dean bites down, into the parts of Castiel that hover over him, as he feels himself break, until he can’t take it anymore.
“Your friend, the guy you were sitting with?” She reaches forward, tugs on Castiel’s tie, twists it around her wrist.
And Dean doesn’t know what to do, or say, right now. Right now is usually the part where he’d get up, give an excuse, write down a fake phone number, leave forever. Or the part when someone would do the same to him. He just knows he wants to stay here, because for the first time, ever, he feels like he matters, to someone, for something.
“Okay, Dean,” Castiel knows he could stay here, like this, forever, anyway.
“Fuck,” Castiel mumbles, and his lips brush across the tip of where Dean’s body is waiting for him.
Jude 1:7, or something, some word of an absconded God, that Castiel can’t remember as he comes in Dean’s mouth.
“I’m fucking tired, man. And we’re still like twelve hours away.” Dean reaches into the car and pulls Castiel by the wrist, out onto the tire-tread-streaked dirt. In the faint glimmer of moonlight that breaks through the clouds above, Castiel’s body brushes into Dean’s as he walks around to the driver’s side of the Impala. And all Castiel can think about, all he’s been thinking about since Dean had dragged him into this hunt, is all this time, alone with Dean. All this time to fuck up and do something, say something he shouldn’t.
“Just go with it, you’ll get out of here, I’ll get you out of here, come on,” she takes his hand, pulls him toward the door.
Sam is asleep, motel-room sheets pulled up to his chin, laptop precariously balanced by his foot at the edge of the bed. The laugh track from some long-cancelled sitcom is just a murmur from the television that casts a bluish glow on Castiel.
“He told me something. Before it took him. It took him….” I can’t find the words. All I can think about is Cas, rotting away in the Empty somewhere. Cas, who didn’t think I’m human disorder incarnate, or something like that. Cas, who only wanted something more, something he thought he couldn’t have.
So he walks and walks for what might be minutes or what might be hours. He walks through overgrown grass, through twisted weeds, patches of yellow dandelions. He walks over broken branches, an empty gas container, and shattered glass.
Castiel moves his finger over the screen, until the red trash can icon slides into view, then he removes Dean from Lisa’s contacts list. He repeats every step on Ben’s phone, considers leaving one or two pictures, so that Ben has some evidence, something left, of his father. But Castiel knows fathers just let you down, fathers just abandon you, fathers just disappear, and Ben doesn’t need to know what he never really had anyway.
Castiel climbs out of the car, and Eileen wraps her arms around him, and then Dean. “I’m so happy,” she says. “For you, for both of you.”
Dizzy, Dean lifts his head, up to Castiel’s face, his mouth his only inches away from Castiel’s. Never has Castiel felt so close to violating every single rule of Heaven. He can barely understand what he wants, or why he wants it, but all he knows, is he wants something, and he wants it from Dean. Once, he had held Dean’s soul, in his hands, but right now, even that isn’t enough. He runs his fingers up the back of Dean’s neck, arching Dean’s lips up toward his. Castiel would give anything, everything, just to kiss Dean, just to feel Dean kiss him.
“You’re not wrong, but, sorry.” Dean digs the heel of his boot into the blacktop.
“Sometimes, I don’t know the difference between this, and Sam and the demon blood,” Dean says, the blade the only thing separating his body from Castiel’s. “And sometimes I tell myself, I shouldn’t do this.”
And he doesn’t want to leave his room, because behind his door, is Jack. Everyone, everything, Dean just lost, was all because of Jack. Dean can’t even look at him, because all he can see is Cas, Cas dead on the ground, Cas burning in a pile of broken wood.
And Dean doesn’t close his eyes, because he likes to watch Castiel’s face, as he comes, as his lips hang open and he lets Dean’s name escape his breath one, two, three times. And Dean doesn’t close his eyes, because he likes to watch Castiel’s mouth, everywhere, wrapped around him, swallowing him down.
“I ruin everything, everyone I touch,” Castiel tilts his head, focusing his eyes on the way the mattress curves itself around Dean’s body. “I don’t want to ruin you. Not anymore than I already have.”
“So am I,” Castiel’s lips find Dean’s again, and he exhales slowly into Dean.
“With your brother’s demon girlfriend. Turning human, dying slowly and painfully. Like humans do.” It leans forward closer to me. “That’s right, Dean Winchester. You made yourself into this, this dead half angel disaster, or whatever, and Castiel, I don’t even know how much longer I can hold him, because he’s hardly an angel anymore, because he fell over and over again, all for you.”
“I guess…when you pulled me from the Empty….” Castiel says. “Because you were an angel, somehow, and I’m human…” He slides his body up enough to grab onto the collar of Dean’s shirt, tugging on it, until Dean’s chest is touching his again. “I’m sorry, Cas,” Dean says, and Castiel doesn’t really know what Dean’s apologizing for, but he can’t respond, because Dean’s mouth is on his, and Dean’s fingers are running down his sides, right to the top of Castiel’s pants.
So he pushes Dean’s lips into his throat, the feeling of Dean’s mouth against him, sucking out his grace, sends waves of shock, longing through him. Dean pulls at the collar of Castiel’s coat, pushing it aside, his teeth brushing against Castiel’s skin as Castiel’s grace drips down into him. Castiel groans, into Dean’s forehead, and he lets him take more and more of him, until Castiel can feel himself on the edge of humanity.
Dean opens the journal, looks through the few remaining pages, at his father’s ramblings, and he throws it down into the pyre, watches as the flames engulf it. “And it’s for all of you, our real family.”
And there were things, Dean should have said, things he wanted to say, that he knew Castiel wouldn’t understand, that he knew Castiel couldn’t reciprocate. And now, alone, grasping the edges of the bag that holds his—best friend, fuck buddy, lover, whatever, Dean regrets saying nothing, saying the wrong things, regrets lying.
“I wanted you to hurt me,” Castiel moves his fingers onto Dean’s shoulders, pushing him backward into the mud.
“You know, Sam Winchester. The boy with the demon blood. I fixed him once, made him…sane…cured his addiction. Stopped him from destroying everything. But not anymore.”  God raises his hand in front of my face and smiles. And for the first time today, I regret being powerless, defenseless….human.
“Something like us?” Castiel’s slides his palms down onto the bed, leaning backward, spreading his knees apart, grinding his heel against the floor.
There were times, when he tried to tell me that his powers were failing, failing and he didn’t know why. He’d tried to talk to me about it so many times, but I just ignored him. There was the night, the night he’d left me; all the times he’d tried to talk to me when I was too drunk or too angry to listen, all the times I’d woken up from some terror-filled dream, only to see him sitting on the edge of my bed, eyes closed, asking himself why he couldn’t stop the nightmares anymore.
The pounding against the wall is replaced by the sound of the toilet flushing, of water running, of the duffel bag unzipping, of Dean’s movements against the tiled floor. Castiel prays silently, prays to himself, that Dean wants this tonight, the way that Castiel wants this. That Dean wants to fuck the way they’ve fucked in bar bathrooms, in cemetery fields while the bones of some vengeful spirit burned to dust.
“I was following the reapers,” Castiel lets himself fall against Dean’s hands. “Lucifer found me, trapped me. I’m sorry, Dean. I’m sorry about Jo, and Ellen. I’m sorry.”
But this is different, Castiel is different.
“Does it matter?” Crowley puts his glass down on the coffee table. “It belongs to a friend. He’s on vacation and he owed me a favor.”
“And I couldn’t save him. I couldn’t save Cas.” Admitting this, admitting that I’ve failed, again, to Sam, tears through my insides. I’ve lost Cas too many times already, to Purgatory, to Heaven, to let him go now. After all this. “We need to bring him back. Before we find Chuck, before we stop the goddamn apocalypse again, we need to bring him back.”
Castiel knows Dean knows the answer to his own question. He reaches into his coat and pulls out his angel blade, presses the handle into Dean’s palm. “Tonight may be the last time you can do this.”
Because Castiel doesn’t know what’s right or what’s wrong or what he’s doing anymore.
“Thank you,” Castiel half-whispers. She nods, smiles, and tells Dean to go screw himself.
He raises his hand in front of the car, slowly, until its engine sputters and starts. Then Castiel drives it back, to the church parking lot, positioning its headlights directly across from the front of Lisa’s car, rolling in reverse until he’s far enough away to build the momentum he needs.
It was always going to end with him, alone, or dead, or both.
I bend forward across the table, until I’m nearly lying down on it, and I tell her, “I need it. It’s the only chance we have now.”
“We can’t,” Castiel says, opening his mouth against Dean’s. “I can’t. They’ll kill you.”
Anti-God is Anti-American. The billboard, red, white, and blue and streaked with dirt, casts a shadow down on the broken gravel beneath Castiel’s feet. Leaning against the boarded-up doors of a building labeled nothing but Adult Videos, Castiel lets the wind sweep across his face, and he wonders, how he ever put all his faith, all his trust, under the flag of a God who left this world to burn.
“I don’t understand. Cas’ deal was that the Empty would take him, when he was happy. Cas told me he was far from being happy,” he says.
He pulls himself back to Lisa Braeden’s driveway. The door to her car is unlocked. Castiel turns the key, the one he’d found in Lisa’s bag, in the ignition. And he drives, in circles, block after block, past houses, past stores, until he finds a church, deserted and neglected, and surrounded by an empty lot.
“Fuck you.” Sam turns his face away from the headlights of a passing car. He doesn’t know where he is or where he’s going, but he walks. He walks, while Lucifer tells him all the ways he’s going to give in, eventually. All the ways Lucifer will use him to destroy the world.
“It is,” Castiel says. “But, I’m in. Give me the souls.”
“What the fuck, Cas?” Dean pulls away from the curb, makes his way down the street, the guilt from forcing Castiel to leave, from telling him he couldn’t stay, circulating throughout him as he wraps his fingers around the steering wheel.
Dean doesn’t know what to call what he’s done to Castiel. Desecration, maybe. Probably.
I’m cold and tired, in a way I can only remember being once before. My stomach aches, and I think maybe I’m hungry. I think maybe I’m losing my mind.
“I took too much,” Dean says, lifting himself off Castiel, dirt smearing across his cheeks as he runs his fingers down his face.  “Fuck, I took too much, Cas.” The echo of Jo’s death in his head, is finally gone, and there’s nothing but Castiel, scarred and half-conscious, beneath him.
The only light in the South Dakota night flickers from Bobby’s porch. In the darkness, Dean pulls at the buttons of Castiel’s shirt, pulls Castiel down into dying patches of grass and scattered, broken nails and screws. And he knows that Castiel could turn him to dust, that Castiel could end him, right here, right now, but that Castiel wants this, that Castiel is just as fucked up as he is.
Dean shoves Castiel’s fingers off the sleeve of his jacket. “No. You didn’t. I spent a year, looking for you in Purgatory. Praying to you. I was going to save us both. And you—you decide you need to stay there. You decide you deserve to be there. You decide to let me think that I fucked up again, that I failed you. And all you can say is sorry, all you can do is tell me I can’t save everyone.”
“I don’t deserve you,” Sam says, shoving his hands into the pockets of his jacket. He kicks his feet around in the pile of dead leaves gathered on the ground. A woman walks by pushing a baby stroller, a dog on a leash sniffs the air and barks before continuing down the sidewalk. All these people, who never realized, never understood, the things that were out there, the things that lurked in the dark, are safe now, and Sam knows he had nothing to do with it.
The man in the torn sleeping bag coughs, raises his head from hands and slumps back down onto the sidewalk. Dean recognizes the look of exhaustion, of hunger, of hopelessness, because it’s a look Dean knows that he’s had a million times. Outside grocery stores at ten-years old, hoping that someone would pity him enough to donate something from their overflowing shopping cart, something that would be enough to feed Sam, and maybe himself. Because their father never left them with enough cash, when he was gone for days, for a week, on a hunt.
Still lying on top of Dean, Castiel slides his hands in between Dean’s waist and the floor, and he rolls onto his side, onto his back, pulling Dean with him, until Dean is staring up at the stark-white ceiling. Dean turns his mouth into Castiel’s, his tongue running along Castiel’s as he takes Castiel’s hand, guides it down in past his chest and his stomach and in between his legs. “Cas, please,” he says, because he knows Castiel likes it when Dean begs for him. Because maybe they know each other’s bodies as well as they know their own, because they know exactly how to touch each other, where to touch each other, when they’ve gone too far, when they haven’t gone far enough. Because all of this is, and has always been, beyond the need for words.
“What? No, it’s not that. It’s not you,” Castiel turns his face up to hers. “It’s just—what’s your real name?”
Dean can feel Castiel’s lips, his tongue, all over him. Castiel, fallen Angel of the Lord who had dragged him out of Hell and put him back together. Castiel, who led armies in Heaven. Castiel, who sacrificed himself to the Empty. Castiel, human, forever, because of him. Close to reaching the end, Dean steps back, letting himself fall away from Castiel. “Stop. Sorry. I don’t want to…I don’t want this to be over, yet.”
Dean kneels down in the dirt, falling forward, Castiel’s death—the bright white-blue light that exploded from his body as Lucifer shoved the angel blade through him—plays over and over in his mind, a constant loop, a constant reminder of the fact that Dean couldn’t save him. Dean rolls over, turns his face up to the sky.
Even the blood of the King of Hell can’t convince Sam that any of this is worth it, is worth his life, is worth Dean’s life.
Last night on Earth. And this is the last place he wants to be.  “You can have the money,” Castiel says. “We don’t have to do anything.”
And Castiel gives in, until his face is buried in Dean’s pillow, until Dean’s lips and fingers are everywhere, until Castiel finally has Dean, in every way, until Castiel finally has everything, anything, he’s ever wanted.
“This is for my parents,” she says, handing the book to Jack.
Chuck puts his hand on Dean’s shoulder, over the stain of Castiel’s handprint on Dean’s jacket. “Come on, Dean.”
Raphael, God, Castiel doesn’t care, about any of it, as he holds the back of Dean’s head against him, as Dean hangs onto the bottom of his shirt, unbuttoning it from the bottom up. And, without all his grace, with his body nearly human, Castiel knows why, understands why, people will do anything for this, this feeling that every single one of his nerves is exposed to Dean. This feeling that Dean is eating him alive. This feeling that he couldn’t be closer to Dean than right now, against the wall of a foreclosed-on shithole, listening to the sound of a neighborhood dog that won’t stop barking, of a car alarm honking somewhere far away, of Dean gagging as he slides himself forward, letting Castiel slip nearly down his throat.
Dean collapses back into the dead, brown grass where God was finally destroyed.
“Yeah, me neither.” Dean lets himself give in to the feeling of Castiel’s grace, pulling him into darkness, and he lets all of the nights of sleep deprivation, that have built up inside him, succumb into a sleep that’s empty, safe, calm. A sleep that isn’t stalked by everything he’s running from.
But Castiel’s lips move up Dean’s spine, to the back of Dean’s neck, and he tilts Dean’s head back, with his uninjured hand, his teeth brushing along Dean’s throat. “I used to worry about breaking you, ruining you.”
“Because it’s all we know how to do.” My eyes focus on the pages, but I’m not reading a word. I can hear her blood pumping through her body. I can almost feel the way it was, to be with her, to cut into her skin, to drink from her. The power she gave me, it was incomparable to anything else I’ve ever felt.
This is the end.
Ruby manages to sit up, in the center of Sam’s bed, pulling her clothes over her blood-streaked body. Disoriented, she makes her way to the doorway, and out in the hall. She calls to Sam, but he doesn’t answer, and she stands, in front of Dean’s room.  She wonders if she should just leave. She can find another way back to Hell. She doesn’t need Sam Winchester, or Dean Winchester, or Castiel, or their God problems. She’s supposed to be a villain in this story. Maybe. She doesn’t know anymore.
And Castiel pulls away, sits, at the edge of the mattress, at the edge of Dean’s body, at the edge of what Castiel knows is a crucifixion. At the edge of what Castiel knows is his betrayal of Dean Winchester.
“No, nothing on Lucifer. Not yet anyway.” Sam says, turning the laptop to Dean. “But I think I found a case.”
Dean does it on all purpose. He lets his hips almost brush into Castiel’s in the doorway. He lets his lips almost touch Castiel’s, as he tries to ignore the feeling of Castiel’s breath against his neck. As he tries to swallow the anger, the confusion, everything, that he feels in every inch of his body.
“I’ll stop, we can stop,” Castiel says. “I’ll go.”
“Not me,” Dean says. “I can’t do it. Not alone.”
“You can touch me,” Dean says. “You can do whatever, whatever you want.”
Dean reaches down, to just above where his body is joined with Castiel’s, and he wraps his hand around himself, moving his wrist in rhythm with Castiel grinding against him.
“Why not?” Dean turns the volume on the television lower. “I mean, FBI probably isn’t the way to get them to talk. Maybe just be, you know, normal, or whatever.”
Castiel turns to him, “I told you, the other angels…they don’t trust me anymore. Because of you. If they find out that I’m helping you...I can’t take that chance.”
“I want to hear you say it,” Castiel mutters into Dean’s hair.
“What if I fuck up? What if I go too far?” Dean sits up, his body sliding along Castiel’s. His breath still short, the palms of his hands still beaded with sweat.
“I won’t let you.” Castiel lets his feet fall to the floor and he walks, to the edge of the room, to where the light from the hallway spills under the space between the door and the rug, to where his coat is crumbled. He finds his angel blade in one of the inner pockets, and he runs his finger along the blade. “I’ll stop you, if you need me to.”
“It was a gift from you, so yes,” Castiel says. “So I kept it with me. I loved you for a long time, Dean.” He turns away, but Dean pulls his face against his, and kisses him. “I’m sorry, sorry for everything, Cas. Sorry for treating you like shit, sorry for blaming you, sorry that I let you go, so many times.”
He stands over the toilet, leaning his head back up to the square fluorescent light that shines down across the white marble counter and the floral-pattered shower curtain that hangs from a crooked metal bar. And, when he’s done, he stands in front of the mirror, and he tells himself over and over, that he can’t stay here with Castiel, and that Castiel can’t come home, Castiel can’t put Sam in danger. And he hates everything he sees, hates the fading bruises and scars on his arms, hates the anti-possession symbol embedded in ink on his chest, hates every fucking reminder of this life. Hates the way he feels about Castiel, hates himself for not being good enough for Castiel to feel the same.
But I was all we had. I was supposed to save them all. And now I’m sitting here, in the dark, slurping the chocolate-chip-stained milk from a bowl, finally feeling free, free from destiny and fate, free from all the things that made me useful, needed.
Castiel traces the same steps he used to take when they did this. He runs his fingers along the buttons on his shirt, undoing them one by one, letting the material fall open across his chest. He drops the knife onto the bed, lays down beside Dean, tries not to think about the way Dean’s eyes move from his own eyes, down his lips, down the rest of his body.
“Why should I do that? So your brother can find out and try to kill me? No thanks.” Crowley says.
I can’t even say it. I can’t even say he’s gone. I don’t give a shit about everyone else right now.
Castiel lifts himself from the bed, pulls Dean’s hand away from Dean’s body. “Don’t. I want to.” He buries his face, in between Dean’s legs, bending over Dean, bending over across the bed. Dean gasps for air, gasps for anything, as Castiel’s tongue touches him where he’s still raw, as Castiel takes him into his mouth.
“Okay. Sarah. It’s not you. I just need to get out of here.” Castiel reaches into his pocket and pulls out whatever crumpled twenty-dollar bills Dean had given him. “I need to get my—friend—out of here too. We shouldn’t be here, not tonight.”
Underneath Dean, Castiel has never felt so close to telling Dean to destroy everything inside him created by God. He’s never felt so close to tearing his own wounds open, draining his own grace dry, so he could be something, someone else. But that’s not what Dean wants. Dean wants a warrior, a soldier, to fight this Apocalypse with him. And Castiel is afraid, that all of this will end, if he’s not what, or who, Dean wants.
“Well, I’m here,” she says. “We all are, and I think, that’s all that matters, right?”
“Take what you want. Take it all. It doesn’t even matter,” Castiel says. “Or do you mean something other than taking my grace? Do you mean you want to stop the other things you do to me?”
“I have reason to believe he’s here.” Crowley taps his fingers along the leather of the passenger seat.
“Remember once, when we were little, Dad left us in some disgusting motel room while he went on a hunt. I was sick, and you made me canned Chicken and Stars soup and I laid there, trying to sleep, and I couldn’t because the people in the room next to us were fucking so loud, against the wall, and you told me they were fighting,” Sam shakes his head, laughs. “And you told me stories, to distract me. You told me angels were watching over us and that everything was going to be okay, someday.”
“Nevermind.” Castiel puts his head down on the pillow next to Dean’s, lets Dean slip his fingers through Castiel’s own. Every time Dean touches him, every time Dean runs his hands along Castiel’s body and every time Dean’s lips press against his cheek, Castiel feels like his power, his divinity, is slowly being stolen, siphoned away.
He wants to hate himself, for lying here, legs spread in the air, jerking himself off while Castiel pushes further up inside him, but, instead, Dean can never remember, ever, anything that felt better than this.
“Fuck you, Cas,” Dean says, slipping his finger under the button on his own jeans, letting them fall to somewhere below his knees.
“Maybe,” he says, wrapping his hand around my throat, until my breath can barely escape my lungs, and he raises his other hand to my mouth. I can feel him, slowly pulling the life out of me, black smoke filling the air in between us. I can feel myself fading, leaving my body. I can’t speak, and he raises his hand higher, above my head, and I can’t see him through the thick haze that floats quietly out of my mouth.
“I won’t touch you, Dean,” Castiel’s eyes move across Dean, across the black t-shirt pulled halfway up his stomach, and across Dean’s legs. “I never needed to touch you.”
Castiel looks down, away from Dean, but Dean forces his chin back up, and he bends, smashes Castiel’s mouth into his own. Standing in front of Castiel, Dean takes off his clothes, throws them down by Castiel’s feet, and, with the glow of the television dripping down his naked skin, he puts his head into his hands, tells Castiel to touch him, in any way, anywhere, he wants.
“I’m sorry, I can’t stop myself, when we do this, when I’m like this,” Dean says, as Castiel tugs on the collar of his flannel shirt. “It’s the only thing that makes all the anger, everything, go away. I’m sorry.”
Dean always assumed he’d die young, in some stupid way, on some stupid hunt. His father even told him, once, that would probably be the best thing that could happen to him. So he didn’t have to die old, alone, forgotten. Like hunters always do. He never even expected to make it past 40. And now he’s going to die because God had decided he’s bored, done with the world, done with Dean.
Sam follows the brick walkway out of the backyard, to a neighborhood filled with houses adorned with icicle holiday lights, illuminated plastic Santa Clauses and snowmen. He walks down the street, and he considers texting Dean, considers asking him if everything is okay. If he’s figured out the case and killed the bad guy. But he knows Dean will figure out the case and kill the bad guy, because he’s Dean. And it’s late, and Dean is with Castiel, and Sam doesn’t know what that means, really, but he knows enough.
“I think, because it is,” Dean takes the box from him, glancing back at Jack, snoring in the backseat.
Outside, its barely day, and the room is filled with shadows, except for the sliver of light that pours out of the bathroom. The morning after, waking up in the same place as someone whose body he’d had against his only hours ago, isn’t something Dean is used to. He’s used to drunken walk-of-shames, slipping out of back doors, passing out in the back of the Impala struggling to remember where he was, who he was.
He stares across the field, at the graves that have fallen over onto their sides, at the way the last rays of the sun glimmer off the tombstones and the trees. And then he stares into the box Castiel holds on his lap, the last contents of the Impala, the last thing that Dean needs to destroy, to finally be free.
Castiel looks away from the shadows passing by at 65 miles per hour. “Why didn’t you take Sam? Crowley and I, we were looking for Lucifer. It’s not something Sam needs to do.”
“Why?” Castiel finally raises his eyes to Dean’s.
“You know, don’t you?” Sam slides himself up against the back of the couch. “Of course you know.”
I scatter the papers all over the room. Maybe this is his research; he must have been trying to find a way out of his deal, he couldn’t have accepted this as his fate. Maybe there’s something here I can use to summon the Empty, to bring him back. But there’s nothing but newspaper clippings. Cases. Two bodies found on Long Island missing their hearts. A bunch of cattle mutilations outside of Philadelphia. Seven missing teenagers in Phoenix.
Whatever he and Dean had, he wonders if it’s gone now. The nights he’d let Dean have too much of his grace, his vessel weak, struggling, while Dean slept beside him. The nights when half their clothes lay strewn across the floor of some motel room, and the other half pretended to be a barrier to parts of their bodies they let each other touch anyway.  The nights when Dean would slip his tongue into Castiel’s mouth, when Castiel would tell Dean he couldn’t, wouldn’t go any further, because what they were doing was already heresy. The drunken blow job Dean had given him, in some abandoned house, somewhere in Maine, because Castiel had been sure, that it was going to be his last night on Earth, that Raphael was going to destroy him, and that he’d never have to face anything ever again.
“Yes. All of it. Even the corpse on her living room floor,” Castiel stops his eyes from meeting Dean’s. “Dr. something.”
Dean doesn’t believe, anything that Castiel is saying right now, doesn’t believe that he’s going to call off whatever insane plan he has to stop Lucifer’s child from entering this world. But he pushes Castiel up against the counter, lets his leg push itself up in between Castiel’s legs. “You’re lying, I know you’re lying. But before you do whatever you’re going to do, before you walk out of here again, I need you, because maybe this will be the last time I can have you.”
“Sounds the same as my father,” Castiel squints against the sunrise. “Except, I think my father fucks with everyone’s head in a way. And a lot of people still want his approval. Actually, a lot of people think they need his approval for everything.”
“What? Does what feel different? Being here, with you?” Castiel moves his hand up Dean’s arm, pressing his fingers into Dean’s skin. And he wants to pull Dean closer, he wants to pull Dean against him, but the things he feels, are new and different and human. The way he feels like the air he swallows can’t find his lungs. The way his brain is failing to control every nerve in his body. The way he needs this, needs Dean, and the way he’s not afraid, anymore, of Heaven’s consequences.
His eyes are locked on Castiel’s, and his fingertips move along the scar.
“Too much humanity,” Ruby sits down beside me. “You know, me and Sam had a thing. It was pretty good.”
The coffee is terrible but Sam drinks it anyway. The coffee is always terrible, and Sam always drinks it anyway. He hasn’t slept more than a few hours since they’d gotten back from Los Angeles. Since they’d failed, again, to stop Lucifer.
Over the past few hours, hazy pieces of the last couple of days have seeped back into his brain—bringing Dean back from the Empty, a dozen fights with Dean for sacrificing Jack’s grace for Cas, Cas, barely alive and human, in the back of the Impala, telling him over and over again that they should have never saved him, Ruby bloody in his bed.
Castiel wraps his fingers around Dean’s wrist, forces the weapon out of Dean’s hand. “I was supposed to save you, stop you from doing what you’ve already done.”
But now, instead of Dean, it’s imaginary Lucifer, wrapping his fingers around the metal bars, spinning Sam in circles. Imaginary Lucifer, telling Sam this will all be over soon, because he’ll give in, because the demon blood addiction will only get worse, and he’ll want nothing more than to be the perfect vessel for the Devil.
“Well, this never meant anything anyway, right?” Castiel’s tongue grazes along the inside of Dean’s lips. “So what would it change?”
And something about this, the way Castiel’s mouth begs for his, the way Castiel’s tongue slides along his own, the way he knows that Castiel isn’t going to listen to his pleas, tastes like treason. But Dean pulls away just enough to mumble, “Yes.”
“Why Ethan Burke? Why not some other celebrity like Vince? Ethan Burke doesn’t exactly have millions of adoring fans.” Sam pushes the seat backward and tilts his head back toward Crowley. “Or do you not know that for sure either?”
And Dean tries to accept that this, this is his destiny, his end. That he was born to be a brother, and a mother, and a father, to Sam. That he was born as a means to an end for everyone he’d ever known, anyone he’d ever loved. Except for Cas. He tries to accept that he was nothing but a burned-out vessel for Michael, a constant pawn in what feels like a thousand failed apocalypses. And part of him wishes that Chuck would just destroy everything already, stop dragging this out. And part of him knows that he can’t give up, can’t let this happen.
I slide down the wall, and onto the floor. This has been in me all along. And the only reason I ever thought that maybe, someday, I could just be normal is because Chuck tricked me into thinking I was someone else, somebody who isn’t a freak.
Dean lies down, stretching his arm across Castiel’s legs. He still feels wounded, torn up inside, from the angel spell, from being drained of Jack’s grace, and he’s almost scared, about how much he wants this. “I ruined you, like I ruin everything.” Dean tugs on the material of Castiel’s shirt and drags Castiel down onto the pillow beside him.
“I heard your prayer.” I want to forgive him. I want to pretend that everything is fine. But I’m still furious, for putting Mary, Jack, and every single mistake we’ve ever made, on me. There’s still so much anger, deep inside me, and I want to finally take it all out on him.
“No,” Dean holds his hand out, balancing the gun on his fingers. “No. Never. We’ll find a way, Sam. Don’t do this. Fight him, fight Chuck.”
“Meg?”
And Dean finally lets himself fall asleep, for the first time in days, because he’s finally not terrified, because he finally knows someone is watching over him, because he’s full of Castiel’s grace, and because feels something, with Castiel, that he doesn’t understand, or that maybe he doesn’t want to understand.
Dean pushes a grease-stained paper dish to the edge of the table, pushes the stack of brown folders toward a jammed napkin holder and a saltshaker crusted with white crystals. And he tries to convince himself that this is really just some sick son-of-a-bitch. That maybe there’s nothing, nothing here, in this bent-at-the-edges pile of typed reports and scribbled notes, that means this is a case. Nothing for them to hunt, no reason for him, no reason for Castiel, to do anything here, other than sit at this table, at this almost-crowded pizza place. No reason for them to do anything than vanish into this island of vast congestion, for days, forever.
And Sam has almost told Dean, so many times, that he’s not okay, that he’s never been okay, not since they’d stopped the Apocalypse the first time, not since Castiel had dragged him from the cage, not since his soul had spent Hell-decades enduring everything Lucifer had to give. But he can’t, and he won’t, burden Dean with this because Dean doesn’t deserve it, and Dean has done enough. Because Dean raised him, and he didn’t raise him to be this.
He stumbles through the hall and into the Bunker’s dungeon, shutting the door behind him, closing his eyes and pressing his head into the wall. He can see Eileen, lost, alone, in some other dimension, asking him to bring her back, before it’s too late, before she’s gone forever. “I’m sorry. I’m sorry, Eileen. I’m sorry, I don’t know what to do. Tell me what to do.”
“Paid for what?” Castiel lets the can fall from his hand, and he doesn’t know if he wants to know the answer to his question, because he’s not really sure why he asked.
“You didn’t come right back,” Castiel says.
He had considered, maybe convinced himself, that the best thing of all would be to never tell her about the psychic powers, the demon blood, Ruby. To just tell her that they’d defeated Chuck, that it was over, all over, and they could finally live their lives without worrying about all the things that went bump in the night, because all those things, they’re all gone now.
“No, Dean. It’s not like that. I just can’t do this anymore. I’m tired. And you can’t do this either. Because, if I let you, eventually…it’s going to kill you.”
But Sam says nothing, because it’s not his secret. And Sam says nothing, because he has his own secrets.
When they do this, sometimes, Castiel wishes for some kind of accident.  He wishes that Dean would go too far, take everything, take every bit of his grace, take everything that’s holy, rip him apart until he’s nothing but human, mortal. Then, maybe, he could have Dean, the way he wants to have Dean, without worrying about Heaven, without worrying about divine retaliation.
Castiel looks down at the sandwich. The crust is missing from the edges of the bread, the same way that Dean always cuts it off for Jack. “That’s exactly how I feel, and I guess, how I was feeling for awhile, before this.”
“Like I said. Big bank. King of Hell. A lot of overlap,” Crowley says, stopping in front of a door, and motioning to the nameplate. “Charles Dryer. Sold his soul to me in 2012, I gave him ten years, in exchange he got this job. But he thinks he’s second-in-charge here, but really he’s just Ethan Burke’s pet. But he can get us in.”
“The angels will stay in heaven, demons in hell, like it’s supposed to be,” Amara stands, walking beside Ruby. “Except Ruby. Ruby’s right—Rowena needs help in Hell. Stopping whatever demon insurrection is going on. Working with Heaven to make sure everything’s under control. No angel-demon wars, no more attempts to overthrow the world, or whatever Chuck let happen.”
“Are you sure you don’t want some?” she smiles with pale pink lipstick. “Are you okay?”
“I guess the good news is that Lucifer is definitely here.” Crowley leans against the doorway, falling out of the way as Sam pushes his way through.
“Tell me you’ll stop asking me to stop, tell me you’ll trust me,” Castiel says, as Dean’s hand falls into his.
“Did you ever think it could end like this?” Sam looks around, at the contents of the Impala, everywhere. All these things, they would maybe never need again, because they’d won, because God is dead and because Amara had saved Dean, saved Dean from the life he never really wanted.
“Do you know Hayley Meyer, Ms. Gallagher?” Castiel asks, sliding his body away from Dean’s on the cushion when he realizes their legs are rubbing into one another.
“It’s not you—it’s complicated, Cas.” Dean’s hand wraps around Castiel’s throat, and he pushes Castiel’s head backward, against his mouth.
“Chuck told you that, right? He told me that too, so that I would believe that I needed him.” Amara places her hand over the ash, makes it dissipate into the clouds. “My brother created this world, and there are parts of it that are beautiful, but so much of it is so, so ugly. He called himself a creator, the light, but he stood by, and let people destroy one another. He let the world collapse into sickness and turmoil, and he enjoyed it. Just a plot twist in one of his stories. He let terrible things happen to people who didn’t deserve any of it. And most of the time, he just abandoned you. He was the light and the darkness, and he convinced everyone—even me—that I was the one who embodied pure destruction. But I’m not him, and I don’t want to end this world, and I don’t need him. I realize now that I never did.”
Castiel slips his fingertips in between their bodies, lets his hands replace Dean’s, lets himself close his eyes and feel Dean’s skin, feel Dean’s everything, against him. And, in this corridor of some motel somewhere in Iowa, this—Castiel—is the only thing that makes sense to Dean.  The cold glass of the vending machine against him, Dean presses his forehead into Castiel’s. “Cas, I—”
It hurts, hurts like Hell, at first. It hurts more than the first time Dean let someone do this to him, when he was supposed to be on some hunt with Lee, when they were both wasted out of their mind. When he’d let Lee fuck him on some dirty motel room floor instead of slaughtering some vampire nest, when Dean’s father had found them there. It hurts more than the things his father had said to him, after that. More than all the times he’d wound up bloody and barely alive under Benny. More than the bikers on pool tables. More than the lawyer who had paid $500 to screw Dean while his wife watched.
“That’s why we can’t let him keep going,” Sam says. “Because eventually we’ll never be able to stop him.” He lets his neck sink back into the throw pillows, he tries to drown out the sound of everything around him. He tries to swallow the feeling, in his mouth, in his brain, the feeling of need, of hunger for something he knows he should reject.
“Don’t do this, Sam. Don’t make Dean do this. You know this isn’t you. Don’t let God have his way,” Ruby tries to pull herself away from Chuck, and she can feel something, something changing, in his grip.
“Maybe ten. Maybe more.” Dean slips his arm further behind his back, slips away from Castiel’s grasp. “But they’re all dead. They’re all dead, and their nest was full of so much good shit, I guess they had a lot of fun, you know, when they weren’t killing people.”
“That’s what everyone tells me.” I close my eyes again, almost drifting off.
At the edge of his bed, Dean kneels in front of Castiel. Like he’s praying, confessing.
And this is the kind of misery that Sam longs for, when it’s two in the morning and he can’t sleep and all he can think about is how good it feels, when he gives in. When Dean is God-knows-where with Castiel doing God-knows-what, and Sam abandons some motel room to summon whatever it is he needs. This, this is the kind of misery that Sam knows he deserves, that Dean deserves—the misery of being normal.
“I want to.” In the dark, Castiel takes Dean between his lips, lets his tongue push Dean up into the roof of his mouth, lets his fingers move underneath Dean, lets them slip inside Dean, lets Dean squirm against him.
“I can’t,” Castiel tries to turn his face away. But on the brink of death, or something worse, Castiel doesn’t really remember why he can’t give in. “I want to, I want to, but I can’t.”
“I don’t want to do this.” Dean pushes himself onto his elbows. “I don’t want to find monsters and I don’t want to find Lucifer. And I’ll never tell Sam that because, if he knew how tired I am of it all, he’d make me stop, and he’d take on everything himself. Someday, you and me, and Sam, we’re going to get out. Forever.”
“He didn’t care about the baby. He was there for me. He told me he could hear me, my pain, for miles,” Castiel says. “I lost my grace, I’m powerless, you kicked me out of the bunker. How I feel, it drew him to me.”
And Castiel had imagined this a hundred, a thousand times, imagined what it would be like, to feel Dean from the inside, to devour every cell of the body he had resurrected. but he had never imagined this with the burden of humanity that now lives in his brain. He never imagined how hard it would be to silence everything he wants to say, to confess, right now. He never imagined that this could feel so pure but so corrupt all at once.
“This is a Nephilim, not just a Nephilim. It’s the literal spawn of the devil.” Castiel turns his eyes to Dean’s. “This is bigger than us.”
“Pretty sure they’re going to hunt me anyway,” Dean lets his tongue brush along Castiel’s lips as he pushes his jeans down to his ankles.
Castiel uses his grace, nearly all of it to heal, rebuild, Dean’s body, to restore Dean’s soul. The force of Castiel’s power causes the trees surrounding them to crash down to the ground, causes the forest to succumb to its own death. The force of Castiel’s power burns Dean’s new flesh, burns the outline of Castiel’s hand along Dean’s shoulder. And Castiel runs his fingers along the blistered skin, along the soul he can still feel, now burning inside of Dean’s body.
Somewhere, Chuck is destroying the entire world, and I don’t care. Not anymore. Caring has never gotten me anything, except everyone I’ve ever loved dead.
“What do I want?” Chuck puts his hand on his chin. “Well, Sam knows, and I’ll let him tell you.”
“What if I make you, what if it’s what you need to do, to get me to help you? To stop your Apocalypse?” Dean lifts his head off the bed, just enough so that his tongue scrapes against Castiel’s neck, across the newly-healed flesh, across the spot where Dean had drained him only moments before.
Slowly, he picks himself up from the ground, and in the dim light that streams down from the moon, the shadows of broken angel wings reflect on the trees and in the grass.
So Castiel sits outside Lisa’s house, at the edge of her driveway, knowing he should leave, but knowing he can’t, knowing he’d give up Heaven just to have Dean. God should choose someone else.
“I’m sure but, no, I’m not okay.” Saying those words, finally telling someone, someone whose name he doesn’t even know, someone he’ll never see again, lets a wave of solace fall over him, because he’s been choking it all down, since forever, since Castiel admitted that he deserved to be punished, for the things he did on Earth and in Heaven, for the things he did with Dean.
Sam is standing over me. “Dean? What’s happening? What did you do? And Ruby?”
“I can’t keep doing this,” Castiel’s fingers wrap around Dean’s wrist, trying to create some kind of distance between them, trying not to succeed. “I can’t keep giving you my grace.”
Stepping over the glass of the burned-out frame of the building covered in the invisible carcasses of hellhounds, Castiel makes his way through piles of still-smoldering wood, piles of twisted nails, piles of paint cans with lids blown off. He makes his way to the remains, the ash and bone, of Ellen and Jo. And he knows he should bury them, or scatter their ashes, something other than leaving their seared corpses for the scavengers. But Dean is praying to him, praying for him, silencing every other thought in Castiel’s brain.
And I don’t know what’s happening to me.
“You let him have your blood…again?” Castiel brings the blanket up further on his stomach.
“You’ll give me my mother?” I twist my arms until I’m free from his grip.
And, now, finally lying here next to Dean Winchester, his just-fucked body up against mine, I close my eyes and wait for the Empty.
He closes his eyes, and tries to imagine what it would be like, to be free from this forever. To have some boring job. To live somewhere besides an underground bunker. To be free of the constant dreams of the apocalypse and Hell. But he knows that he probably won’t even survive the next few days and, all of this, is just bullshit Dean Winchester will never have, never deserve.
“I’m going to screw this up,” Dean’s mouth breaks away from Castiel’s.
But I was too fucking stupid to realize.
“I just need to make it turn off—the dreams, the things in my head.” Dean lifts the blade up to Castiel’s throat. He can still remember doing this, he can still remember the taste of Castiel, the way Castiel’s grace felt everywhere inside him. And he cuts along Castiel’s neck, down to his chest, with the same hesitancy, the same longing, that he used to. His lips run along Castiel’s body, the bluish-white glow of his grace reflecting off the walls, the ceiling, everything. Castiel’s fingers are in his hair, moving under the collar of his shirt, and onto his back.
But Dean clenches his hand around Castiel’s, pulling Castiel closer to him. “I wanted to escape. To be invisible. To be someone else. And I thought I could do that here, I thought I could get lost in this place where my father would never really want to look for me. And I thought I could do something here, other than just kill monsters. But whatever, here I am and we’re looking for a monster to kill.”
“Jo?” Dean asks.
It’s over. Finally. The nightmare he’s been living since he was four years-old. The nightmare that began with Dean carrying Sam away from the flames, the nightmare that ended in the ashes of God.  Dean sits down on the ground, pressing the back of his neck into the cold metal bumper surrounding the license plate. It’s over. And he doesn’t know what to do, where to go. All he’s ever been, his entire life, was a hunter. And now he’s nothing. He’s Dean Winchester. Dean Winchester, almost 42 years-old with a GED, a give ‘em hell attitude, and a blank resume. Except for the demon-killing.
“Do it,” Dean reaches out to Sam, the gun hanging loosely from his hand. “Do it. Let Cas and Jack and Ruby go. Isn’t this all Chuck wants? One brother kills the other? This is all you need to do. And then you’ll be free from me.”
“I’ll do whatever you want me to do.” Castiel runs his hand down Dean’s shoulder, across the flesh he’d once branded as his own, down the black ink of Dean’s anti-possession tattoo, down skin covered with bruises and scars and scabs. His fingers stumble past the button on Dean’s jeans, through a light trail of hair, pulling at a band of elastic that he twists around, and over the edge of Dean’s pants.
“Because I asked you to,” Dean says.
Heaven is godless. And Castiel could have it all. If he wanted to.
“What if we don’t?” Castiel leans forward, places his hand over Dean’s, lets his fingers fall through Dean’s.
Everything it says, I know it’s right. I know Dean never felt the same way. He’d spent half of the past year blaming me for everything, everything that went wrong. And I never really cared that he didn’t feel the same way, until now, until here. Now there’s a feeling inside me, that hates myself, that wants to know how I could possibly think there was ever a chance he might want me, the way I wanted him. That hates myself for all the nights I watched him as he slept, hates myself for all the things I thought about doing to him in every disgusting, dirty motel room we ever shared.
“Then you’ll have Cas. And Jack. And Bobby. They’ll help you.  But I’m out.” Sam digs his fingers into the Earth.
The body sprawled on the floor in the living room, its neck twisted and its head backwards, its eyes wide open, watches Castiel as he flips through the wallet that was stuffed into its pants. There’s a driver’s license, a hospital badge identifying Dr. Matthew J. Taylor, Pediatric Oncologist. Sixty dollars that Castiel slips into his own pocket.
There’s been nothing for miles but grass and trees, and he can’t remember the last time they had passed another car or truck or anything that looked something close to occupied. And it’s been miles since he’s said a word, since Castiel has said a word.
And whatever was sacred, divine, about any of this, about the things they did in secret, has been replaced with the unholy feeling of two scarred and bruised and mortal bodies moving against one another, of clothes being pulled away from helpless human flesh, of Dean’s mouth and Dean’s fingers everywhere.
Sam watches the world rotate, the sky that turns in circles. And he closes his eyes, letting himself surrender to the warmth of the blood inside him, and the sound of Lucifer’s voice, the sound of Lucifer’s voice that mixes with the far-away and distant voice of a twelve year-old Dean, laughing, telling him everything will be okay. A voice that reminds him that, neither of them deserved this life.
“It can be arranged.” I’ve been reading the same spell book over and over, and I don’t know why, because there’s no spell to kill God. We had everything we needed, we had Jack, and now we have nothing. Because Dean decided it would be okay to sacrifice everything. He spent an hour tonight, telling me over and over that I would have done the same, for Eileen, and I spent an hour telling him that he was wrong, even though I know he’s not.
She lifts up the bottom of her shirt, just enough to reveal the lower part of her stomach. She looks down at me, and she says, “It’s okay, Sam.”
Dean pulls himself up, so that he’s directly across from Sam. “I came out here…to get out of there…to clear my head or whatever. I don’t want to talk about this. We’re all going to be dead soon anyway.”
“I’d like to think you’re here to save me, like you promised you would, but we both know you were just lying about that.” She steps out from the shadows. “What are you, Castiel?”
He could be their new God. If he even believed in God anymore.
Dean doesn’t answer, he just stares, his green eyes bloodshot. Inside, he’s furious, that Castiel can’t figure out the answers to his own questions, that he doesn’t know, that he hasn’t known all along. He’s furious that Castiel, the angel who gripped him tight and raised him from Perdition, fell, lost his grace, became human, all for someone like him. He’s furious that he doesn’t know what to say to Castiel, or how to say it, or whether he should say it at all. He wasn’t worth this. “What did you even mean?” he asks Castiel. “Your deal….you said you didn’t know what would make you happy. You said the one thing you want, is something you know you can never have? What the hell were you talking about?”
No answer. Nothing but the sound of the Impala’s engine revving underneath his foot.
I’m lying in a void, in desolation, and every part of me wants to regret this, this eternal damnation. But I saved him, I saved Dean.
Between the cotton and flesh, her hand moves through the hair on his chest, and she presses her lips against his, “I know. I know, Jim.”
“You’ll destroy him. We’ll make you destroy him,” Naomi sits back down in her chair.
“Yeah, something like that. Not my thing.” He folds his hand over her wrist. “I just need to get out of here, Sarah. I need to get my friend out of here. And I wish I could get you out of here, because, I don’t think you want to be here either.”
The road to Hell is paved with lust and greed and despair.
And Dean wants Castiel, again, wants Castiel to make him come so fucking bad,, but Castiel is laying here, naked and human and empty and damaged. So Dean lets his own hand fall, fall past his waist, and he lets his fingers tighten around himself as Castiel exhales into him.
No one has been here in years. Ivy and weeds grow along the long-closed doors. There are so many letters missing from the sign in front that its name has been forgotten to all but old maps and dead parishioners.
But I can’t let him lose his mind again. Because I’m in love with humanity, or something like that.
Dean doesn’t move, doesn’t speak, until the sun hovers over the horizon and the stars fade to nothing, until the sky turns from black to orange to red to pink to blue. Until the ashes have scattered along the ground, until he can barely find them against the rising light of the dawn. And when there’s nothing but dusty traces of Castiel along the dirt, Dean walks back across the shattered glass and the empty gas container and the yellow dandelions and the twisted weeds, back to the Impala that’s splattered with mud from the lonely truck that had passed through during the night.
“Because I forgot your fake name.”
“Should we, I don’t know, say something while we do this?” Castiel throws another match onto the ground, as the flames stray in the wind. “It seems like we should say something, maybe.”
He listens to the sound of Dean breathing, to the feeling of Dean’s chest moving up and down against his body. He folds his fingers around Dean’s, and he imagines that this is all there is for them. That there isn’t a world full of demons waiting for them. He imagines that this is something that’s not camouflaged with lies, deception. He imagines that this is real, that this is reality, to everyone who matters to them.
And then he tells her everything, and he can tell how carefully she watches his lips as he speaks, reading every word, the things he can remember, and the things that Dean, and Cas, and Jack all told him. About the spell, how he used Chuck’s power and Amara’s power to make Dean into some kind of angel, that he sent him to the Empty to save Cas, that he brought him back, that Dean made some kind of deal with the Empty, Jack’s grace for Cas, for Ruby. About all the demon blood, about how he couldn’t control himself, about Ruby. About how Chuck had taken over him entirely, and that it was Dean who had summoned Amara, broken her free. About how, everything they hunted, everything they spent their lives fighting, is locked away now, far, far from Earth.
He reaches down and holds my head against his thighs, and I cough involuntarily, and roll him around with my tongue. And I know I’m an Angel of the Lord or something, and I shouldn’t be doing this, I shouldn’t be down here on this cold cement floor, I shouldn’t love the feeling of his hips against my cheeks.
“Except you won’t stop whatever the fuck it is you’re doing.” Dean’s voice is damning, accusatory, but his hand finds Castiel’s on the bed, and his fingers run along Castiel’s, down Castiel’s palm, to Castiel’s wrist.
“I don’t know. I don’t care right now.”
“You want to find Lucifer, right? And you weren’t doing such a good job on your own. Do this, for me, and I won’t give Dean and Cas a reason not to work with you.” Sam could tell Dean and Castiel anything, and they would believe him, they would believe him just like Dean believed him when he’d told him he was just staying behind, staying at the Bunker.
“Is there someone else?” she asks, her hands folding into one another on the table. “A lot of the people I meet here, they’ve been cheated on, lied to.”
Dean pushes himself up on the bed, pushes himself up against Castiel’s body. “Cas, I still want you to fucking destroy me.”
She smells like hand sanitizer and mint-flavored chewing gum. And Castiel can’t remember the instructions Dean gave him, because he wasn’t listening, because he just wants this to be over. He leans back in the chair, a chair covered in body fluids dried white, glitter, and something that might be, probably is, blood. She’s grinding against him, and, he thinks, this is supposed to make him feel good, make him feel something. But all he can do is wonder why he ever let Dean convince him to come here.
Sam reaches down onto the ground and pulls me up by my shoulders. “Dean, without Jack, how do we bring everyone back? How do I bring Eileen back? Or this is it, you get Cas back, and I get…nothing?”
It laughs again, this time even louder. “I’ll never sleep again, all because of your Nephilim. You think I’ll ever let you know peace, after all that you’ve done?” It stops talking, and moves Meg’s hands further down my chest, the buttons on my shirt falling open. It slides Meg’s hand just above my heart. And I pray, pray to the God that I wish didn’t exist, for it to stop.
I need to find him, get him out of here, before Sam tries to bring me back. Here, I’m the hunted, hunted by the demons and angels I’ve sent to their deaths—Alastair, Azazel, too many to even remember.
Dean presses his face down into the bed, blood from the wound on his nose dotting across the faded and stained cotton. “Cas, please. Please. I can’t do this.”
He holds the journal, John Winchester’s Journal, over the fire. His father’s directions, to him, to Sam, to pick up where he left off, the family business.
Maybe he should buy an urn, maybe he should buy something, something for Castiel. Something other than this goddamn bag, with its goddamn white write-on label in the corner, with its goddamn brand name printed in block lettering along the top.
“No, I never thought I’d survive this. And, honestly, I thought—if I did survive—something else would get me eventually. My bet was always on a vamp,” Dean stands up from the floor, leaning against the car.
So I undo the button on her jeans with the tip of my knife, pull the zipper down slowly. She says something about thinking about me, while she was in the Empty, something about how she missed this.
Castiel’s fingers move down Dean’s forehead, his cheek, and they spread Dean’s lips apart as a trail of light hangs in the air between them. Dean’s teeth and tongue are against Castiel’s fingertips and Dean slides his body back up, so that his face is against Castiel’s. Castiel heals himself with one hand, lets his other hand move away from Dean’s mouth, down Dean’s chin as Dean turns his head into Castiel’s touch.
“I’m not. Are you?” she asks.
“I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to unload that on the two of you. I don’t know why I did. I just have no one to talk to but the kids and—well, I can’t tell them that,” she says. “Just please find the person who did this. Just please don’t let someone get away with they what they did to him.”
“No,” Sam tells himself, stepping back from Dean’s door, fighting everything going on in his brain. “No, I won’t do this.”
“I’ll come with you.” Castiel raises his body from the battered chair.
Dean feels Castiel, trying to drag him away from Sam, but Dean ignores him, because if he doesn’t, Dean will never accept that this is it, how, when, he dies. Because if he looks at Castiel, right now, he’ll never be able to let himself go.
Sam had left Ruby, bleeding and maybe barely alive, on his bed. He can still hear her, from his room, a strained voice, telling him not to, that this is all God, God trying to save himself. But all Sam wants, right now, is to fix this the way Chuck wants—to erase Castiel from this story, to give Chuck the Cain and Abel fantasy that he’s wanted all along.
The moment he laid a hand on me in Hell, my soul, all of me, it belonged to him.
Dean moves his leg against Castiel’s because, just feeling Castiel against him, makes saying this easier, makes him feel like none of what he’s saying matters anymore. “And, once, I told him that, maybe I wanted out too. Just like Sam. And after that, he made me be the one to kill everything, everyone. Even when they maybe didn’t deserve it. Because, you know, some humans are monsters and some monsters, well, they’re almost human and maybe deserved a chance my Dad was never willing to give them. And, every time, he would tell me, ‘See, this is what you’re meant for. This is the only thing you can do right.”’
The dirt-and-rock covered road cracks underneath the tires of the Impala. There’s nothing, no one out here, except for powerlines and dying trees. But the dark solitude doesn’t provide any consolation to Dean. Every time, every single time, he has to do this, every time he has to disguise the death of someone held hostage by angels or demons as nothing but another wrong place, wrong time homicide, he wonders if this will be it. The day he gets caught. The day he finally faces the punishment he thinks maybe he deserves.
It smiles again. “I think we have a deal…if I could get to Earth, without being summoned. How’s that going to work? No one’s left.”
Castiel struggles to control his body, a human body he doesn’t fully understand, a body that’s trembling and sweating and desperate. He pulls away from Dean, afraid he’s gone too far already, but Dean turns and brings himself onto the edge of the bed.
Castiel stretches the blue lace underwear knotted around his fingertips. “Did you steal these too?”
Dean leans into Castiel’s grip, leans into Castiel’s hand.  “You know that I do, Cas.”
Because there are things about Sam, that no one knows. Things that Sam has kept locked inside himself for years. Things that Dean would destroy everything, even himself, to end. The trauma, of the cage, of Hell, that Sam still dreams about every night. The addictions that never really went away, the cravings that he’s managed to control for now by letting himself have just a little, by letting himself go only when he hasn’t slept in days and he’s on the brink of something close to insanity. And Lucifer, possessing whoever he wants, wherever he wants, for pleasure, to get off on it, might be what finally sends Sam over the edge, sends him somewhere he can never come back from.
And Castiel escapes, back to the burned remains of Carthage, back to the burned remains of the hardware store, back to the burned remains of Jo and Ellen. Back to the burned remains of what it means to feel this way, to feel anything, about Dean Winchester.
And he stands on the edge of a closed-for-the-winter swimming pool that stretches across a backyard filled with fresh-cut grass, flower pots, lounge chairs, a glass table with an umbrella shielding the moonlight. A swimming pool that belongs, or belonged, to Crowley’s friend or associate or victim or whoever.
Crowley sits down on the couch next to him. “Are you asking me to give you demon blood? Are you asking me to give you with my own blood?”
“It should have been me ripped apart by those hellhounds. It should be me who’s dead,” Dean’s lips move against Castiel’s neck as he speaks.
Dean’s tongue moves down Castiel’s throat, and he stretches the cotton of Castiel’s t-shirt across his shoulder, revealing the red blisters that Castiel hasn’t told him about, that Castiel intended to hide until they healed, or until he was dead. Dean sits up, legs spread over Castiel’s stomach, and tugs the shirt over his head, drops it to the floor.
The sun is setting, on a now-vacant world, and I use the last rays of dying light to read through Rowena’s spell book again. This keeps my mind off the fact that maybe Eileen is dead, in Hell, or that Chuck sent her to some other dimension, or planet, and that maybe we’ll never see each other ever again.
“I don’t feel differently about you, but this feels different.” Castiel’s eyes turn away from Dean’s. “I’m just human, and there’s no reason for me to say no to you anymore.” He lets his fingers travel up Dean’s shoulder, to the back of Dean’s neck, and he leans forward, his mouth pressing into Dean’s forehead.
Castiel raises his own fingers to the leather collar that Dean is fastening around him, to the cold metal of the chain drops down the center of his chest. “Did you steal this?”
“Sure, I guess,” Dean says. “Or, sometimes, people just want to get fucked. Or they want somebody to do something their wife or girlfriend or husband or boyfriend won’t, you know? Or maybe you don’t know.”
Still holding Castiel close to him through the band of leather that surrounds Castiel’s neck, Dean mumbles. “What are we, Cas?”
And Dean remembers, what the angel, the drunk one he’d first met outside Pirate Pete’s Jolly Treats and last met in the North Cove Sheriff’s Office, said. “Castiel’s dead. All the way dead. Because of you.”
We’ve run through this same dialogue four or five times in the hour and a half since Sam’s gone to sleep. I peel the label off an empty beer bottle, crumble it in my fingers, throw it into a glass and watch it sink down to the bottom. Anything to distract myself from him.
He can still taste Ruby’s blood on his tongue, and he wants to regret fucking her again, he wants to regret how much he likes fucking her, but all he can regret, right now, is that he didn’t kill Castiel, that he didn’t kill Dean.
Inside Dean, Castiel’s grace blurs out the noise coming from the streets below, blurs out the visions, blurs out Dean’s thoughts. And he waits, for sleep, or something like that, to take him away from the tremors of fear, the vague memories of Hell and Purgatory. He waits for all of his senses to fade away, for everything to fade away, except the feeling of Castiel’s chest against his own. Even completely wasted on Castiel’s grace, the way Castiel touches him, it still makes him ache, everywhere.
“But, you will, right? Because it’s me you want, really. Not her, not your kids. You don’t care about them anymore.” She runs her fingers down his neck, underneath his shirt.
“I guess, though, you were right,” Sam throws the knife into a stack of discarded weapons. “At least, for you. Me…look at how quickly I let Chuck take over me. I was weak, I couldn’t fight it, and I’m sorry I never told you about what was happening to me.”
Dean releases his fingers from Castiel’s shirt, turns back toward the road, to the green glow of the traffic light that flows through the air as he turns onto Main Street. It’s always Main Street, and it’s always the same, in every haunted and cursed corner of America. Main Street is always lined with bankrupt stores and half-empty bars and flickering streetlamps. And Dean is tired, of the Main Streets, and the half-empty bars, and he’s tired of hiding bodies and tired of losing everything to save everyone else.
Castiel pulls himself away from Dean, the dim white light from the soda machine casting shadows across his face. He can feel Dean’s anger, Dean’s rage, he can feel the things he felt every day, every time Dean prayed to him in Purgatory. He can feel Dean’s longing, longing for something Castiel doesn’t believe Dean could ever really want.
“I have to go to work,” Castiel says.
And even now, with Jack’s grace inside me, I need him to come back.
“You know what I want,” Dean says, running his mouth down Castiel’s jaw and onto the collar, letting his teeth graze against the leather.
I try to think of something, some lie, that would take away everything he feels, make him numb to the end of everything. Instead, I press my palm into his shoulder, right where he was once scarred from my hands dragging him out of Hell. I tell him I’ll do whatever he needs. He already knows that. Again, he says he’s sorry, sorry for everything, sorry for letting me leave, sorry that he didn’t stop me, sorry for blaming me for the mess in his head.
It takes everything in him not to ask Castiel if these years of touching and kissing and fucking until Dean passes out mean anything more than just getting off. And, instead, he lets Castiel wrap his hand around his neck, bend his head back. He groans as Castiel’s teeth clench down into his shoulder, as Castiel comes, as Castiel’s body falls away from his own.
Castiel tries to ignore Lisa, moaning, whispering something about much she loves fucking Dean, something about how much she loves Dean. With his free hand, Castiel reaches up into his hair, pulling at his scalp, forcing his own hips against the curled-up fingers that he wants, needs, to be any part of Dean, as he soaks his pants, the bottom of his shirt, everything.
Castiel slips the angel blade into Dean’s hand. “I think I’m safe. This is what you care about, right? Not me.”
“It’s not, you know it’s not. Nothing is bigger than us. You know, that together, you, me, and Sam, we can figure this out.” Dean brings Castiel closer to him, against him. “And if we can’t, if Lucifer’s kid is really going to end it all—we’ll go out fighting, we’ll go out together.”
“Cas, please, if you’re listening, I need to talk to you. I need your help,” Dean says, into folded fingers.
Sam picks up a bullet off the floor and holds it between his fingers. “You saved the world, Dean. You got what you wanted. You got your toes in the sand ending.”
“The Empty only takes angels and demons.” Jack says. “You and Dean can’t go.”
And Castiel lays in the silence of the traffic, of the world, below them, and he pretends that world doesn’t exist, that there’s just Dean.
I’d do anything for him. Kill anyone. Kill God. Before him, I was obedient, indoctrinated Castiel. And I gave up everything for him.
“Yes.”
He reads the international news, the local news, the news for every major city in America. He reads about town mayor elections and high school sports. He reads about the four men with missing hearts who have been found over the past three days in Manhattan. An investment banker, a doctor, a city councilman, a lawyer. All found in their offices. All married, all in their late forties, fifties. No leads, nothing. Probably, maybe, a serial killer, according to the police.
“Are you here a lot or something?” Sam wraps his fingers around one of the gold door handles.
He pushes Dean back up against the vending machine, letting his tongue fall into Dean’s mouth, moving his body in rhythm with Dean. Dean’s fingers tighten around him and finally, Castiel forgives himself, forgives his sins.
“You don’t have to do this,” Dean mumbles, everything in his mind is still stuck in the haze of Castiel’s grace. “Unless you want to. But you never want to.”
Castiel pulls the blade from the dirt. “Just do it, Dean. It’s okay.”
The empty angel vessel drifts face-up between the narrow shores of an Idaho canal. Its head scraping along the grass-covered banks, its legs twisted in the murky water. Its eyes open and staring at the vast and forsaken Heaven to which it surrendered control.
