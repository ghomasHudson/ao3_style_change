Obviously I have no idea what to make of that, but I will admit that it sounds remarkably sexy coming from Sherlock, his lush mouth caressing the words.  The women around the table swoon.
If you are reading this fic as new chapters are posted, please go back and re-read the end of chapter five before continuing. I've made a small change that impacts on the action of this chapter - nothing huge, but everything makes a bit more sense with the reworked scene in chapter five. (Oh, the joys of writing a WIP...) Anway, start from the point where John is apprehended by the redhats and you should be golden.
Tearing down Curzon Road away from the club, John saw the tall trees of Hyde Park looming ahead of them.  Sherlock ducked into their shadows and turned left. “This way!” Sherlock called, and with an annoyed shake of his head, John noted that his companion lacked any noticeable trace of strain from running.
- Janine’s name was originally Eileen in chapter one (it's since been changed), but I decided to use canon names for characters despite her not playing a similar role to her BBC Sherlock counterpart.  Anyway, Eileen is now Janine and shall be for the remainder of the story - although she may not feature much more.
Affecting nonchalance, Sherlock continued to gaze out over the crowd.  He could feel John’s eyes on him but resisted the temptation to look back at him immediately. “To begin with, you have a desire to save people, even those as offensive as me, who put us both at risk in a pub full of drunken, patriotic subjects of the British Empire.  It emanates from your very being.  Most people would not have bothered to rescue someone they just met, let alone someone they suspected of possible dangerous or illegal conduct.  You, however, did not hesitate to assist me, so I cannot fathom that you would have enlisted without seeking out a position that would allow you to save as many people as possible, therefore not just an ordinary soldier on the front lines, despite the fact that it would have fulfilled your sense of national duty.
“While I’ve come to accept and manage the parts of my personality that tend towards the addictive, I also believe that my age and inexperience left me particularly vulnerable to those negative influences that are so pervasive in this industry.  Had I started my career later, I may not have been as susceptible to those temptations.  However, it is what it is and I cannot change my story now.  I can only learn from it.”  They are phrases I recall from his meeting with Sally yesterday and Sherlock recites them like he’s reading his lines.
With all the celebrating and imbibing going on tonight, it was only natural that there would be a few injuries, either by sheer accident or ill-advised displays of machismo resulting in fisticuffs. John had witnessed all sorts of stupid drunken behaviour, especially by young soldiers who couldn’t yet hold their liquor.
Matching Sherlock’s long stride, it felt like a short walk indeed back to Harry’s flat. As they approached the street door, John wondered if Sherlock had ever set foot in a working class neighbourhood, let alone a slightly dilapidated house, now divided into three separate flats.
John did not seem wholly satisfied with that answer, but he replied with “true” nonetheless.
By that point Prince Henry and Major Lestrade had caught up and both looked extremely displeased at their causing a scene on the street. John just wanted to be away from the lot of them.
John’s left hand came up to cover Sherlock’s where it rested on his chest, while his right moved slowly to Sherlock’s cheek, as though to give Sherlock time to anticipate or scorn his touch. When John’s fingers made contact with his skin, Sherlock drew a sharp breath and pushed his head more firmly into John’s hand.
The Curzon Club was located in an imposing Edwardian building, its tidy brick walls and ornately carved door were framed by white Greek Corinthian columns, which drew the eye up to the decorative pediments above.  Up a short flight of stairs, edged with wrought-iron railings, a doorman was unexpectedly positioned behind a podium, lit by the warm orange glow of the streetlamp.  Sherlock had visited any number of imposing buildings, but he still recognised grandeur when he saw it.  Nevertheless, he marched up the stairs with determination, John trailing behind him.
For the second time that night, John found himself running through the streets of London.
We stand, giggling in the shadows, for a few more minutes, until the couple can no longer be heard and then slip out from our hiding place to make our way back to the gate on Rosmead Road, keeping to the grass to hide our footsteps.  This time Sherlock gestures for me to climb over first and I manage with a bit more dignity than my first attempt.  Sherlock quickly follows and we set off down the road, away from our transgression of trespassing and head in the direction of my flat.
“Mmmngh,” I groan, wrestling my arms from under the duvet and hugging him close to me.  “Hi.”  My voice scratchy with sleep.
“Poor bloke.”
Across the room Mycroft sighs, and Sherlock approaches me, ignoring any rules about personal space, especially in the middle of a fight, and grasps my shoulders. He’s radiating intensity and I twist away from him, knocking his hands down and moving towards the sitting room door, exit route at the ready.  I’m breathing hard through my nose and prepped for a fight.
Sherlock glares at him but stalks off down the hall, leaving Armon to follow behind.  After their departure, a few members of his team start whispering, the hiss of their conversation reaching me across the room but not the words themselves.  They’re clearly gossiping about Sherlock, though, and it serves to irritate me further.  Sally approaches them, barks some command and they disperse, thankfully.  I sit back down on the pink armchair and stew in my feelings of frustration and helplessness.
In the end, it’s Sherlock’s calm certainty that propels me to move past my nerves and refocus on him, on making him feel good.  His hands slide across my shoulders, pulling me closer, and I slide slowly into him until I’m surrounded by the silky heat of his body.
Sherlock glares at me briefly to make his point, and then extricates himself from his sulk.  “
Above them, Papa and Mummy looked stern and unimpressed. While they were both adept at schooling their expressions to suit the moment, regardless of their true thoughts and feelings, Sherlock was fairly certain that ‘stern and unimpressed’ was a fair summation of their current moods. He glimpsed Mycroft and Major Lestrade off to the side observing the proceedings; Mycroft had his usual air of disappointed superiority, while Lestrade appeared tired and anxious. While it had been Lestrade’s duty to look after him and Mycroft tonight, Sherlock was reluctant to wish him any ill will for failing to keep tabs on him. He seemed like a decent chap and Sherlock was momentarily concerned about what repercussions he might face, just as he was with John.
Sherlock poses for a photograph, begrudgingly I can tell, and I’m tempted to take out my own phone to document the moment, but I think that might push him over the edge so I just make a mental note to track down the image later.  The second Armon lowers his phone, the buzz in the flat kicks up a notch as all of the members of his team rush about to finish any final tasks as they prepare to depart for the theatre.
“I beg your pardon!” Sherlock exclaimed at the same time John growled, “Watch it.”
“No, Captain. Since young Sherlock, here, decided to do a runner, I have spent the majority of the evening tracking him, and incidentally you, across London.  Now that I’ve located him, however, that is my destination.  And yours.” He stated, eyeballing Sherlock, who glared right back at him. “Mycroft is waiting for us there.”
I scan the restaurant -- it’s small, just a handful of booths and tables squeezed into the narrow space -- and spot Sherlock sitting at a secluded table near the back.  There’s a glass of wine on the table in front of him and he’s doing something on his phone, but his eyes snap to me as soon as I take a step towards him and stay on me as I close the distance between us.
5. And some other photos of John’s outfit, Sherlock's pocket square, and Molly and Greg’s house (far right):
He wants to read it, I know he does, but he’s restraining himself admirably, not wanting to pressure me.  I find that the idea of showing it to him doesn’t make me as anxious as I thought it might, so I make the offer so he doesn’t combust.  “Do you want to read it?”
“I’m sorry to drop in on you so unexpectedly and I’m sure my appearance at your door is inconvenient if not entirely unwanted, but. . .”  He’d started with typical Sherlockian fervor, like he’s delivering a line in one of his films, but then he falters, words drying up.  He stares at the ground for a moment, hands straining against his pockets, and then he looks up to meet my eye.  “I didn’t know where else to go.”
She looks at me intently and then says, “I’ve just made scones.  Come in and we’ll have a cup of tea.”
“Send me screenshots of the texts and block the number.  I’ll send them to some of the guys on duty and ask them to run the number, see what turns up.  And if you get any other weird messages or phone calls or, I don't know, telegrams, you tell me, okay?  Okay, John?”  There’s an edge to his voice that he doesn’t usually have when he’s talking to me.
“Mycroft!” he yelled, turning swiftly away from the window.  He strode across the room, narrowly avoiding the chairs and side tables that blocked the most direct path to the gallery.  The door was opened swiftly by one of the silent, ever-present footmen as he approached.
“I know.”
Placing his hands beneath his chin, Sherlock closed his eyes and sifted through the information about London that might assist in planning out his adventures.  Trafalgar Square was definitely on his list.  A pub or a club - a place that did not cater to the upper echelons of society.  He let the room fade away, making a mental map of potential routes between destinations.
Sherlock hesitated. “I feel like I should apologise, for writing to you after so many years. I cannot imagine what you must have thought upon receiving my letter, but I am glad that you have come. I confess, I was not sure that you would.”
Once he’s divested me of the offensive garments, I can’t help but groan at the contact when he lays on top of me once more, the firmness of his erection where it presses into my thigh.  I curl my limbs around him in an effort to keep him there always and seek out his lips once more.  Sherlock settles against me, his hot skin pressing into mine, the intensity of the feeling is nothing short of incredible now that there’s nothing between us.  My hands trail down his back to grasp his arse, pulling him up so that our erections slide together, keeping with the rhythm Sherlock has established.
While he should follow behind his brother and perform the same greetings, he struggled to move from his position just inside the door.  As he deliberated, Major Lestrade stepped up beside him and spoke.
“Friends, is that what you are?  Sherlock doesn’t have friends.”
I can’t help but laugh.  “Later,” I say.
“Indeed.”
Shortly thereafter, Lestrade took a final sip of tea and bid them farewell, leaving Sherlock alone with John at the table. Next to him, John was still erupting with occasional giggles, which seemed to fizz up Sherlock’s spine every time he heard one.
“Lieutenant-Colonel Watson.”
“Oh, shit!”  It bursts from my mouth before my inherent polite Britishness can kick in.  “Pardon me, I am so sorry!”
“Me?  Why?”  Sherlock looked genuinely confused.
“For your decorum earlier this evening, I have commanded that you be taken into custody and your infractions will be dealt with by the Military Police. You are a -”
“It’s necessary, believe me,” I reply.  The bartender places the drink in front of me and I take a large pull of the whisky, enjoying the smoky burn as it travels down my throat.
“Yes, I’m aware,” he says, rather curtly, “I’ll take care of it.”
I huff out a breath but can’t stop my lips twisting into a grin.   I approach the damn fence again, and with Sherlock pointing out footholds and at one point, catching my foot before it slips, I manage to get to the top of the fence and grab a tree branch overhead, before somewhat awkwardly letting myself down on the other side, landing with a thump.
. . . there is great comfort in the thought that the years of darkness and danger in which the children of our country have grown up are over . . .
“Yes, but I could have picked it up.  Surely sorting out our dinner is below her pay grade.”
As John started scrubbing, he drifted into a daze, fingers working by muscle memory and radio adverts buzzing through his subconscious - a new Renault, PG Tips, some film starring Matt Damon.
“Hi,” my brain supplies.  It comes out a bit breathless, just seeing him again throws me for a loop.
“And James Moriarty was not one of those people?”
John felt his annoyance seeping out of him but tried to keep hold of it, even as it slipped through his fingers. “Well, you made a first-class prat out of me,
~~Seven o’clock in the evening~~
The cloakroom was mercifully empty and there, at the other end of the wide corridor packed with overcoats, stood another door.  Sherlock smiled widely, mentally congratulating himself for his own cleverness, then went in search of his overcoat.
“Oh, Christ.”
John offered a small encouraging laugh in response, hoping the driver would take a hint that conversation wasn’t necessary or desired.  Thankfully, he did and John returned his focus to the world separated from him by a pane of glass.
”I suggest you be glad we are going at all and try to enjoy it instead of scowling at me like a child.”
~~8th April 1952~~
The morning was warm and the sun shone brightly in the sky as Sherlock navigated the car through the still-quiet streets of London. It was true, what he had said to John, he did love to drive. It always felt like freedom, and Sherlock had had few opportunities to drive over the last few years, the exception being their annual trip to Balmoral, where he could take the Range Rover on wild treks through the grounds, fast and a bit reckless. Now, while still favouring a bit of speed, Sherlock took more care while making turns because John was in the car with him.
“Yes, you played your part very formidably, Mycroft.  Well done, and my heartiest congratulations to you for your role in winning the war.”
“Oh.”  His expression softens and some of the Sherlock I knew seems to be seeping back into him and I have to look away from his face.  It’s too confusing.
“Do you know?”
They had stopped walking, and they now stood in the shadows of the large houses that surrounded them on Sloane Street. Sherlock could not hear anything beyond the soft exhalations of John’s breathing. It seemed like his entire being was focused on the man in front of him. Every nerve frozen in anticipation. Of what, he was not quite certain.
“I bought things for dinner,” I try to explain.
Despite shaking fingers, I manage to roll on the condom, the once familiar motion feeling strangely foreign given the importance of what will happen next, and move to lay between Sherlock’s legs.  I take a deep breath to collect myself and look down at him.  Even in the shadowy darkness, he looks radiant and so very open, every last barrier stripped away.
She smacks me in the arm.  “At least I’m not as old as you!”
“Excuse me?”  The woman, Sally, glances up from tapping away on her phone, and looks at Mycroft like he’s the reason for a constant headache.
“Well, Sherlock, thank you for sitting down with us this morning and sharing your story with us.  We wish you all the best moving forward, especially with the upcoming film,” Naga says.
With a soft chuckle, I swat him on the hip and go to the door to let Armon know it’s safe to re-enter.  I leave them to it and go to wait in the sitting room with the rest of Sherlock’s team.  Ten minutes later, he emerges in his full outfit and my jaw nearly hits the floor.  Honestly, while I always think Sherlock looks amazing, and while I’ve seen him in nearly every state of dress, this current outfit is just incredible.
But clearly Sherlock had had the same thought, for he said, “Please do not mock me, John. I was being sincere.”
Heading back through to the kitchen, John assessed the state of Harry’s cupboards. Had he been at the barracks, he would have access to ammonia or hydrogen peroxide, but seeing as this was Harry and she barely had food in her cupboards, he’d have to be a bit more creative in this bloodstain removal. Cornstarch and salt water would take too long, so that really only left white vinegar. John dug around and finally, buried under various foodstuffs, John triumphantly pulled out a small bottle of vinegar.
With a resigned sigh, he said, “You will see that no harm comes to him, Captain.”
- Last week, the bin lorry rocked up outside my flat at midnight on a Saturday and I was pissed.  Probably not as pissed as Sherlock and John for having their first kiss interrupted, but still…
Sherlock mustered all his composure and said, “Goodbye, John.”
“He does seem to have a way of putting one off lingering in the shop.”
It feels like heaven.
John grinned up at him. “
“John,” he says softly behind me, “I realise that I have no right to ask this of you and in all likelihood you will, and probably should, say no, but I would be very grateful for your help.”
“Very good, Sir,” the footman replied, backing out of the room and closing the door.
What the fuck is a bin lorry doing out at midnight on a Saturday?
John stepped back from the car and Sherlock found that he could not watch John walk away. He shifted the car into gear and eased forward down the road. Never before had he experienced the piercing agony of a final goodbye.
“John.”
And if you haven't seen A Royal Night Out, please do! It's utterly charming. :)
The next thirty minutes are a whirlwind of activity.  Sherlock finishes his cup of tea just as Sally buzzes to be let up.  She’s brought a recently pressed suit for him to wear and she fusses over him, fixing his lapels and brushing invisible lint from his shoulders as she rattles off last minute reminders for the upcoming interview.
“Mmm,” he murmurs, distantly.  “I need to make a call.  Good night, John.”
Mycroft eyed him and Sherlock did his best to return his gaze unwaveringly.  “That was a very diplomatic answer, Prince William.  One that may convince Papa and Mummy, but I know you far too well.  Why do you really want to go out, Sherlock, and why must I go as well?”
I’ve barely stepped inside when Janine’s loud and perky greeting hits me.  I give her what feels like a pained smile as I approach the counter.
John was impressed, and he noticed a faint flush across Lestrade’s face following Sherlock’s ultimatum.
“Concerned for whom?  Seems to me like you’re sticking your nose in where it doesn’t belong, mate.”  He grimaces at being called ‘mate’ and I give myself a mental high-five.
⟪Oh god, John, ignore Greg. He’s been giddy all morning. I mean, we both have but still ignore him. We’re just happy for you!!! X⟫
Throughout his youth, Sherlock had, more or less, run riot around the palace—exploring the secret passages and servants quarters, claiming a corner of the garden as a pirate’s hideaway (frowned upon immensely by his father given the trouble actual pirates had caused their forebears), running away from governesses and tutors, performing ‘experiments’ in the palace kitchens and leaving behind scorch marks that had to be scoured for hours. He submitted to the punishments that followed this behaviour with a sense of immense irritation and was back to misbehaving shortly thereafter. Not one of these chastisements caused him to feel any concern about the consequences of his actions. Not one. He had never before truly worried about how he might be received by his mother and father.
“I’m early, but I come bearing coffee,” she says and once again pushing passed me into the sitting room.  I sigh -- so much for our day in bed.
My heart clenches at the sight of him there, like he belongs even after what I said to him last night.  I want this to be a reality -- Sherlock being here when I get in from work, sharing meals and watching crap telly in the evenings, sitting together while reading and not talking for hours, generally wanting Sherlock to feel at home in my home.
Sherlock interrupted before either officer could get a word in.  “No, that will be quite all right, Maxwell.  As the Captain said, we shall just be on our way, but the Colonel is ever so eager to get inside, so perhaps you could assist him.”
He drew to a stop and rounded on Prince William. “You lied to me all night long, because you’re a prince and you think you can do whatever you like.”
“All right.”  John’s tone rang with feigned scepticism, which was also disproved by the grin stretching across his face.  He had come to stand in front of the lion’s paws, their shoulders bumping as they surveyed the scene before them.  “So, do you think he’ll be here?  In Trafalgar Square, I mean.”
The idea of a young Sherlock, lost in the bacchanalian world of the film industry and battling addiction makes me inexpressibly sad.  It’s also hard to make sense of it in relation to the man I got to know five months ago, who was warm, charming, funny, and seemingly so centred and focused.  But then, he’s obviously been on his own journey over the last decade, changing, discovering, becoming a different man.
He pulled back just far enough so he could look Sherlock in the eye for the first time since he had entered the kitchen. “I’ll dance with you. Whenever you want.”
“Yes, all right, fine, but can we have breakfast first?  A proper breakfast, not just those pastries that Sally brought.”
He grumbles in response, pulling the duvet up over his shoulder and snuggling around me even tighter, causing me to laugh.
“John was just telling us about how he turned down Sherlock Holmes,” Greg says, raising an eyebrow at me.
“All right, Meeks, I assume you managed to secure assistance and an ambulance is indeed coming?” Meeks nodded, eyes wide and looking slightly unsteady on his feet now that his adrenaline was receding. “Good. In that case, sit down there and tell us what happened. Sherlock, come here.”
He’s seated beside me, looking out the window.  To an outside observer, he may appear calm, but I know it’s an act.  Sherlock is as anxious as I am about this -- the first time we’ll be officially photographed together.  The paparazzi and fan photos that made their way into the tabloids and onto social media and the resulting speculation don’t count.
“Sherlock,” I say, with all the sternness I can muster, which isn’t much at all.  In response, he adopts a completely insincere look of innocence and my heart flips that this ridiculous man is mine.
“. . . Prince William.  Bit of an awkward duckling, that one.”  A woman’s voice floated to his ears from the other side of an enormous floral arrangement.
Slowly, John leaned down and pressed a soft kiss to those beautiful, full lips.
“Goodbye, Sherlock. Go solve all of London’s mysteries.”
“That’s odd. I think about snogging you whenever I wash the dishes.”
This caused John to snort out a laugh.  Of course there were bloody two of them.
Sherlock laughs.  “Compared to some of the vultures I meet at industry events, they were positively enchanting.  I much prefer socialising when people aren’t circling, waiting to see what salacious information they can gleen or how I can help them further their careers.  Your friends are genuinely decent people, John, and they care about you.”
John was quiet, staring out at the trees as they blurred passed on the roadside. Sherlock fidgeted as he waited for John to respond.
Sherlock glanced up at John, who gave him a slight smile and a wink.
Besides, John was already attempting to clamber up next him on the statue.  It was obvious that his left shoulder was still weak; John pushed himself up easily with his right arm but struggled to straighten his left.  Sherlock was tempted to help him, but he thought John might not appreciate the gesture. Instead, he waited until John had a knee under himself and then extended his hand, allowing John the choice of taking it or not.
By October, I’ve watched all twenty-two of his films, plus random episodes of a few television series from the late 90s and early 00s.
This admission feels like a punch to the solar plexus.  My hands clench into fists and I attempt to calm the rage coursing through my body.  I look between them and, for first time, notice the family resemblance in some of their features, which only serves to piss me off even more.
“Shall we walk and see what we find?  There’s bound to be some overpriced local spot up ahead where hoity-toity people like you gather.”
Meeting Sherlock was brilliant, but he is also, you know, a million miles from the world I live in.  For a moment, he ventured to walk amongst us commoners, only to flit away again when it was apparent he didn’t belong.
“He was rather determined to ruin our fun,” John agreed.
John cocked his head.  “Oh?”
And then the driver was pulling around to the front of the palace and stopping near the Victoria Memorial. The Mall itself was mostly deserted, although John could see a few persistent revellers in the distance, who would soon wake up, most likely hungover, in the pale light that filtered through the London streets.
Received 13/5/2018  08:11
“No, not this time.”  Sherlock takes a sip of his tea and doesn’t say anything more.  Perhaps it isn’t polite to ask too many questions about a celebrity’s upcoming project so I cast about for another topic of conversation, but Sherlock beats me to it.
Suddenly the taxi screeched to a halt and in the split second before he flew off the seat, John managed to grab onto the door and braced himself against the force of the stopping vehicle.  With his heart rabbiting in his chest, he realised a man was standing in the middle of the street, the bonnet of the taxi inches from his shins.   He was standing with his arm outstretched, palm forward, as if commanding the taxi to stop.  John immediately shifted to attention.
“We had a good night, right?” he asked.
Sherlock smiled at John’s phrasing.  It had been a long time since anyone had used the word ‘arseholes’ around him - it was not something that usually came up in polite conversation.  As silly as it was to admit, it thrilled him to engage with someone without the usual barrier of politeness typically required of those addressing royalty, but the fact that John had instantly taken his side also made him feel oddly wrongfooted.
“I think you need to do what feels right to you.”
In the end, Sherlock forfeits the newly-named Brownie of Despair to Harry, which in reality is just a second slice of the store-bought chocolate cake.
“Well, whatever you said clearly was effective.”
With a fond smile, John agreed, “We did.”
Sherlock went about fixing a second cup for them both and they fell into a companionable silence as they sipped Harry’s tea, stealing glances at each other and not wanting to burst this hushed bubble that had surrounded them.
The clock on my bedside table reads eight-thirty so there really isn’t a need to get up any time soon.  No shop to open today and Sherlock is still on lockdown so we can spend all day in this bed as far as I’m concerned.  I go back to lightly tracing patterns onto his back and minutes blur together as we luxuriate in the presence of each other’s company.
Sherlock is ridiculous
Sherlock had absolutely no idea how much money John had spent over the course of the evening between the taxi journeys and the drinks and everything else. He looked at John for guidance, eyes wide.
“No, nothing pressing. Stay.”
It had been twenty minutes at least since Papa had departed and he had surely found enough money to repay John by now, but Sherlock was reluctant to let their acquaintance end here, with John walking out the doors of Buckingham Palace and Sherlock having to let him.
Although, officially, no one knows that yet.  Sherlock has attended the premieres and other award shows so far on his own.  The expectation is that he will do the same tonight, so there really is no pressure for me to walk the red carpet with him.
I glare at her, but deep down, I know she's right.
“You sure you’re okay on the sofa?” I ask, depositing the pile of linens in the space I’d vacated.
I want to protest, but now that he points it out, I think I did spend most of dinner thinking about kissing him and licking my lips as a result.  It wasn’t intentional, but I’m feeling rather smug about the idea of Sherlock being distracted by it throughout our meal.
“You say that now, but I know you’ll be whining that something was ruined later on.”
Sherlock looked uncertain.  “I must decline.  I -- I have no money with me.”
Although John thought he knew the physicality of Sherlock Holmes fairly well by this point, after months of watching him chase criminals across London, throw himself dramatically down on the sofa in a huff, or step out of his bedroom half-dressed in a sheet. He knew the breadth of Sherlock’s shoulders, the lankiness of his limbs and the narrowness of his waist by sight. He did not, however, know how that body would feel pressed against his own.
Saturdays are usually a peaceful reprieve after a long week -- the only day I’m in the shop alone, just me and my books.  An odd customer will wander in, usually browse amongst the shelves, occasionally buy something, and then depart, leaving behind nothing but flecks of dust shifting in the sunlight and the sound of the traffic outside, muffled and distorted through the glass.
.  If you watch it, you’ll see me in the scene at the pub -- I even have a few lines!”
Sherlock steps up beside me and holds out the sunflowers to Harry, ‘These are for you.  Happy birthday, Harry.”  While he’s talking his left hand settles gently on my lower back and I’m so glad that everyone is focused on the flowers in that moment because I shiver visibly at the contact.  Sherlock slants his eyes over to me and I give him a quick smile, stepping a bit closer to him and leaning back into the reassuring pressure of his hand.  The butterflies have returned.
“All right?” John asked before Sherlock even had a chance to formulate a greeting.
“Kind of deserved though, that panic, mate.  You did turn the poor bloke down.”
“So, you’re at home and safe?  Good.”  I blow out a deep breath, relieved.  At least Sherlock is okay, although I’m not sure what I would have done if he hadn’t answered or wasn’t safe and sound at home.  Probably something stupid.  “Um, you haven’t received any strange texts lately, have you?”
“I think I’m going to head to bed early tonight,” I say, rubbing the fingers of my left hand together out of habit, a sign of anxiety, my therapist tells me.
“It is nothing you need to concern yourself with, just a minor misunderstanding,” he waved his hand as if to brush away their concern.  “I would very much appreciate it if you could take me to Trafalgar Square.”
Trying to restore the peace, I say, “Listen, Sherlock, I know it’s got to be frustrating being stuck here and not being able to just, you know, function as you normally do, but I don’t mind helping you out.  Britannia Spice isn’t far from the shop, so it would have been a simple thing for me to collect it.”
“I feel like I owe you an apology, John. It seems that I, quite without thought, caused you to alter your plans for the evening. I have made many assumptions, one of which was that you would, of course, want to accompany me on what has proven to be a comedy of errors.”
- The lights near Trafalgar Square are real - they’ve been used for the last couple years in memory of the Pulse Orlando attack.  Read more here: https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/london-pride-gay-and-trans-symbols-replace-little-green-man-on-traffic-lights-a7091541.html
Sherlock shrugs against me.
Young Prince William, 1944. “I despised that uniform. Everything about my involvement with the Home Guard was ridiculous, but it was important that I was seen to be doing something, even if I did very little in reality. My turning up to lay sandbags isn’t what won the war.”
There is a giddiness threatening to bubble up inside me and I find myself wanting to tell passers-by that a bonafide celebrity came round to my flat and I managed, with some effort, not to make a complete fool out of myself in his presence.  (Considering his cheekbones and that voice, I think that’s all anyone would ask of me.)   The words dance on my tongue -- “You, there!  Group of women entering the cafe, do you know of Sherlock Holmes?  Because if you do, then I’m about to make you so jealous!”
Looking pleased as he sat down, Sherlock proceeded to wolf down the remainder of his eggs. For all that he seemed vaguely unenthusiastic about the possibility of food earlier, he'd certainly found an appetite.
“That may be true, but there’s also that eternal issue of rich people not wanting to share their nice things with the rabble.”
“Hush!  Undoubtedly, he is still nearby,” the man whispered, a note of panic rising his voice. Lifting his head, he focused his attention out into the lane, listening intently for any suspicious sounds.
Across from him, Sherlock scoffed and began muttering under his breath.  John shot him a look and then focused his attention back on the King’s speech.
Armon glances at me, rolls his eyes and continues to run the lint roller down the sleeve of the jacket.
It felt bloody marvelous. Especially when Sherlock insinuated one of those lean thighs between his legs and bent his knees so that they were of a height. It was like they were puzzle pieces slotting together with a satisfying snap, although in this case it was more of a moan and John wasn’t sure which one of them made the sound. Possibly both.
John had been out there, hidden in the sea of people, just beyond the walls and gates of his home, while Sherlock was inside preparing to go out. Given the number of people celebrating tonight, the odds of their paths crossing was infinitesimally small. If Sherlock had escaped the Ritz earlier or later, if John had taken a different taxi or not gotten one at all, then they would not have met. That John could exist in the world without Sherlock ever knowing him was unfathomable.
“Hi,” John said softly, “you okay?”
“That’s good of you, Sherlock.  And Angelo is certainly a fan of yours.  How long have you known him?”
“Major,” John said, with a salute and a wicked grin. “You must be famished after the night you have had!”
The word caused John to jerk back in surprise. Twenty minutes ago, he had been completely smitten with the man he knew as “Sherlock” and would not have hesitated to call him his friend. Now, however, John could feel the warm prickles of rage creeping up his spine. Bits and pieces of their conversation over the night began to flicker through his head and it all started to slot together.
On the radio, an advert ended and a new song began.
This is not what he had planned at all.  Irritation was threatening to spill over, but he tamped it down so as not completely destroy any chance of being allowed to leave.  “I am dressed as I choose to be dressed and the Ritz would have no option but to admit me, even if I were wrapped in a bedsheet.  I am, after all, a crowned prince of this realm.”
Soon Molly, Greg and Harry return from the kitchen, bearing an assortment of dishes between them and passing them out around the table.   Conversation dies while everyone loads up their plates with chicken, roasted potatoes, salad and warm brown bread.
“Your cane.  You left it in the taxi.  However, the way you carried yourself just now indicates that the cause of your limp is not a physical injury, rather it appears to be just in your mind.  Besides, that cane made you look far older than your age.  Come along, in here.”
“Are you mad?” John answered, which seemed to imply that he had considered it as a possibility.  “No.  You’re getting out and I’m going home.  You can make your own way to Trafalgar, I don’t bloody care how, but it won’t be in my taxi!”  By the end of it, John realised he’d been shouting.  He took a deep breath and settled himself back into the corner of the seat.  What on Earth was happening right now?
Resurfacing from my satisfied and stupidly happy haze at his question, I press a lingering kiss to his throat.  “Mm?”
Her obvious disapproval makes me stubbornly defiant and I nod.  “I said no.  We don’t make any sense, Harry.  He’s this brilliant, gorgeous celebrity and I’m, well, I’m just me.”
The next morning, I wake to an empty bed.  Since I’d finally fallen asleep pressed tightly against Sherlock, the lack of his warmth in my arms is immediately apparent.  Pushing back the covers, I shuffle out into the hall in search of him.  The flat is completely quiet, giving me no indication of where he is, so I glance in the into the kitchen -- empty -- and carry on into the sitting room.
I have five hours to kill and I have no idea how I’m going to survive it.  Five hours and then I have a date with Sherlock Holmes.  The realisation is overwhelming and I need to sit down on the stool behind the counter for a few minutes to catch my breath.
“Why do they even care?  It was over a decade ago.  Do they have nothing of importance to discuss?  Idiots.”  Sherlock flops back on the sofa, glaring at the newspapers on the table.
He comes back to himself suddenly and looks at me, eyes sad, and I really don’t want to know whatever conclusion he’s reached.
And, as always, thank you to @zigster-ao3, @eternaljohnlock and @88thparallel for their help in pulling this chapter together!  You're the best! x
Sally snorts.  “You just want Tom to comment on your post.”
“You was right lucky I was free when ya spotted me.  Been busy all day, people going here and there to celebrate.  You off to a party or summat?”
“See me. You didn’t see me, Sherlock. You never even looked my way. I watched you as you rode through Piccadilly. Hell, I never took my eyes off you, and you didn’t look my way!”
He didn’t remember much of what followed. The Queen most certainly followed her sons, but John was too absorbed with his concern for Sherlock to pay much attention to her or any of the other mourners that made up the rest of the mile-long procession.
“But what about you?”
I can feel Sherlock worrying for me, his fingers pressing around mine in reassurance.  I glance up, hoping to convey that I’m okay despite how nerve wracking this is -- this is his night and I am  here for him.  His eyes search mine and it feels like the noise and chaos around us just fades away.
The reception room was a formal space with a polished parquet floor and gold and crystal chandeliers drawing the eye.  Chairs lined the walls where guests were seated, sipping champagne and chatting.  Large colourful bouquets of nasturtiums, zinnia and irises dotted the room, filling the air with an overwhelming lush fragrance.
He turns to survey the shop, a distinct look of displeasure on his pinched face, before his hard gaze settles on me.  There’s something about the man that immediately causes me to be on alert.
Large windows lined the walls, but these started at chest-height and were frequently blocked by floral arrangements atop tables or statues.  Sherlock could not see any mechanism that would easily open the windows either, limiting their possibility as an escape route.  Besides the main entrance, there were two other doors leading out of the room, but nearer the external wall of the hotel.  They were most likely not used by guests; Sherlock made note to observe how frequently they were used and by whom.
Echoing Sherlock’s words from earlier, John said, “this way” and turned left to cross the carriage path that bordered the park and headed towards a narrow alley that he assumed would connect them with the Knightsbridge high street.  John was just acting on vague memory, and Sherlock didn’t appear to know this part of London too well either, but he met him stride for stride.
“Well, then, Mr. -- ?”
“Who else has been in the shop with you?”
“That sounds delightfully pedestrian.”
Once he’d gone, Sherlock approached, holding out his hand. “It is truly good to see you. Thank you for coming.”
I pace the length of my sitting room, a refrain of ‘what the fuck’ running through my head on repeat.  The first text was definitely alarming, and maybe it was stupid but I’d been able to put it out of my mind because of the way it was written.  This latest text, however, feels like an actual threat.  I can’t ignore this one.
(See the end of the chapter for
On Thursday evening, when the shops are open later, I spend a couple hours searching for a good birthday gift for Harry.  She’s always been impossible to buy for, but there seems to be added pressure this year since she’s turning thirty.  After looking in seven different stores, I finally settle on a backpack handbag thing that the saleswoman convinced me was cool.  It’s vegan, of course -- I learned my lesson last time I gave her something leather.  Then I pick up some her favourite Faber-Castell pens, which seems like a cop out, but I know she’ll appreciate it because she’s constantly losing them.  I contemplate a bottle of fizz, but that’s just asking for trouble and there will be enough booze at Greg and Molly’s as it is.  On my way home, I buy a gift bag so I can avoid wrapping anything in paper and a simple birthday card, which I sign ‘love, Johnny’ when I get home and toss it in the bag with the gifts.
I give him a gentle push.  “Shove off then and I’ll get it.”  He rolls off of me and I find myself missing the contact immediately, but I shuffle to the edge of the mattress, suddenly remembering that I’m completely nude.  As I glance around the floor for my pants, Sherlock presses a hand against my hip and I nearly collapse back against him, but I spy the navy boxer-briefs near the foot of the bed and bend to retrieve them, pulling them on quickly.  “Tea?” I ask as I stand, minimally clothed, and stretch.
Sherlock: “It would be insincere to pretend that my accomplishments bear no relationship to my station, one that I was born into out of sheer luck. Throughout my early years, I didn’t truly appreciate the privileged life I led, but through meeting John, I began to recognise that all the wealth, status or intelligence in the world are meaningless without kindness and generosity. I am proud to have learned that lesson. And I am also proud of my bees. They are a wonder.”
An answering smile flickered across Sherlock’s face, although it looked like he was trying to suppress it, rather unsuccessfully.  John thought this genuine expression transformed his features and he lost the air of superiority.  He seemed younger and softer around the edges in that moment. It made John wonder at the true story of his run from the officer, but he sensed he wouldn’t get that out of him, at least not right now.  Maybe later.
⟪As long as you give me wine first.⟫
With a quick glance to his right, Sherlock noted a taxicab approaching and with a burst of speed he hurtled closer to the fence, adjusting the length of his strides so he would catch the jump on his right foot.  Placing his right hand on the rail, Sherlock vaulted his legs over with an easy motion, coattails flapping behind him, and landed gracefully in the street, right in the path  of the taxi.
The Colonel got no further because Sherlock had heard enough. He bodily inserted himself into the mix and said, loudly, “I demand you release him at once.”
“No, John.  I understand, familial duty calls.” It may be my nerves being stretched thin in this moment, but I imagine that he looks particularly dejected, like this is not how he’d wanted or expected this interaction to go at all, but then he looks speculative, eyes traveling over my face, and says, “Unless. . .”
“What is the holdup?”  A booming voice interrupted from the queue.  “And since when did you start admitting captains and civilians into the Curzon?”  Contempt dripped from every word.
It was a question, a command, a plea, and John gave in to it, allowing himself to be pulled tightly against Sherlock’s body.
“Have you not heard the news?” Molly asks her, surprised.  Harry is usually the first to know celebrity gossip.
After a moment, he mumbled, “Trafalgar Square.”
“And what do you propose we do whilst out celebrating amongst the people?” Mycroft asked, sipping his tea.
I shouldn’t be surprised by the fact that he somehow knows my usual Indian order and yet I am.  ⟪How did you guess that???⟫
⟪You and your ridiculous rules.  SH⟫
I fall asleep still turning it over in my mind, examining it from all angles, trying to make sense of the enigma that is Sherlock Holmes.
⟪No, just trying to ensure that you don’t expire from malnutrition. SH⟫
He strode purposefully towards the door, pausing to run a hand over his jacket before wrenching it open to begin his rounds.
The response was instant. “Write.”
“He’s my brother.”
“That just means you’ve had more time to come to terms with your impending middle age, whereas I am just beginning the panic over getting older.  My best years are officially behind me and all I’ve got is my crap job, a shitty flat, funny, goggly eyes and sagging breasts.  No boyfriend either because I only seem to attract shitheads so I’ve sworn off men altogether.”
“It will be infinitely better than whatever that was you were eating yesterday,” Sherlock says as I hand my menu over to Angelo.
Lestrade sighed. “To your father. Yes, I am aware, but that doesn’t negate the fact that I am to escort you tonight. Now, in fact.”
“I falsed when I should have trued.”
John snorted, glaring at Prince William’s back. “Just doing my duty, Sir.”
“You don’t know when to shut up, do you?  Perhaps that’s why you’re not in uniform -- too much lip and not enough common sense to make it through basic training.”  With each word, small flecks of spittle landed on Sherlock’s face, and combined with the severe halitosis, Sherlock felt increasing levels of disgust and anger throughout the Colonel’s rant.
I find myself trying to alleviate his worry.  “It’s fine, Sherlock.  I’ve put up with Harry for thirty years, remember?  I know what it’s like.”
“John likes it.”
I wonder who he’s referring to, who’s in the inner circle of Sherlock’s life?  He doesn’t expand up on that thought, however, so I don’t ask.  We continue walking along Elgin Crescent, passing house after house, some with warm lights shining through the windows, indicative of the life inside them, others are dark and still.  We don’t seem to have a destination in mind, turning left onto Rosmead Road at random, both of us content to just meander.
It takes me a long time to fall asleep.
He held his arms up in an open hold and Irene slipped into them, her fingers coyly dancing up his shoulder as she did so. Together they began to move. Irene was clearly a decent dancer and he was able to pick up some basic steps by just watching those around them. He had lost sight of John, however, so he spun Irene away from him in an effort to turn them so that he could see the rest of the dancefloor.
It was now nearing lunchtime and after a leisurely and
My eyes snap from his shirt to his face.  “Oh my god, it’s you.”
Closing the door behind me, I deposit my lunch on the desk carelessly and attack the computer mouse, shaking it violently across the hard surface of the desk.  The computer has been sitting idle for the last hour and the screen has gone to sleep.  Once it’s woken from its nap, all too slowly for my liking, I click on the icon for the security package I’d had installed in the shop.
“It’s possible that it is just an over-eager fan, which I’m afraid are all too common in my line of work.”
Unknown
By the next morning, my life seems to have settled back into its ordinary pattern.  I wake up, I blearily stumble through breakfast, I go to work, put up with Anderson, and occasionally sell some books.
Sherlock wrinkled his nose again (and again John found it adorable). “If I must.”
“Are there any good establishments nearby?”
He steps farther into the shop, but we’re still on opposite sides of the counter and it feels like a barrier between us, so I walk over to him and reach out to grasp his arm, the feeling of the wet wool under my fingers and the solidity of his bones serving to ground me a bit.
“So you’re telling me you’ve received not one but two texts from an unknown number?”  His voice is sharp with disbelief.  Apparently he’s wide awake now.
John may have whimpered at that.  Jesus, what that voice did to him.
Looking down his nose at his younger brother,  Prince Henry said coolly, “Major Lestrade, will you please flag down a taxi for us? I believe it will be more expedient than ringing for a car. William, we must depart. Papa and Mummy were expecting us over an hour ago.”
“Right-o!”
“I don’t think I really care about your excuses.  Whatever game you two are playing, whatever fucked up game this is, I am not going to be involved.”
John placed his head in his hands and his shoulders shook with silent laughter.
The choice to stay together may have been easy, but that did not mean the path ahead of them was a smooth one. A month before their reunion, a well-publicised trial concluded and Alan Turing was convicted of "gross indecency". Despite the protection provided by Sherlock’s title, it was still essential that their relationship remained secret given the legal and societal views of homosexuality at the time. The pair endeavoured to keep their life together private, telling only those who needed to know and ensuring that any staff were trustworthy and properly vetted.
Sherlock goes from stoic to slightly puzzled.  “Pardon?”
“How do you take your tea? No sugar, I’m afraid, but I think Harry has a bit of milk somewhere so we don’t have to drink it black.”
Sherlock spotted a small Union Jack flag laying on the base of the statue, abandoned by its previous owner, and with a grin to the man by his side, he bent down to retrieve it.
“Oh, you are a feisty one,” she says, grinning as she looks me over.  “I can see why Sherlock was falling all over himself for you!”  She pushes the drinks holder and paper bag at me and strides into the flat, leaving me behind in the corridor to shut the door.
“It will do you no harm to wait; judging from the amount you have already had to drink this evening, surely your liver will thank you,” Sherlock retorted, turning to face the speaker, a tall, middle-aged Colonel with a greatly over-inflated sense of self-importance.  If only he knew whom he was addressing, then he would not be so pompous, but everything would be ruined were the truth to come out, so Sherlock did his best to suppress his irritation.
He sat down with his own pint across from Sherlock and raised it.  “Cheers, then.”
The spell had broken when John looked up and said, “You really are a posh git, aren’t you?” But his eyes, dark with intensity and a trace of humour, and his rough voice led Sherlock to realise he was not being mocked. Instead, he had felt that John rather liked some of the more pretentious aspects of his appearance and comportment.
⟪Give me more. SH⟫
“I’ll see you again?” I ask, staring up into his eyes.
Straightening his uniform jacket, he turned to locate his hat when he heard a knock at the door.
“John, hello.”
He stayed close to the trees, not wanting to move along the paths as they would leave him out in the open.  He paused briefly to listen for further footsteps and when there were none, he cursed the grass for dampening any sound.  He considered his options.  While the trees formed a ninety degree turn to the left, if he followed them, he would end up back at the Mall and Buckingham Palace.  While the crowds would be lively, he thought it best to remain as far from the Palace and its guards as possible.  Instead he continued straight on, crossing the path that led directly to the Victoria Memorial and skirted the edge of Piccadilly.
“Well, we’re free of Colonel Pisspot, and the night is still fairly young, surely we can find some other trouble to get into?”
- Just in case anyone was wondering, QuickBooks is an accounting software for small businesses.  I know nothing of accounting, but it’s what we use at work so I thought I’d throw that little detail in.
“If you would have chosen something more befitting your station, then we would not be having this discussion.”
“Is that something that you realised while you were in treatment or later on?” Naga asks, her voice sounding falsely sincere to my ears.
3. The made up film
“Why don’t you go on in, Colonel, and we’ll be on our way,” John said, his words polite but his tone scornful.
Greg wrinkles his nose in a grimace and retrieves his phone from my grip, sliding it back into his pocket.  “You’re right.  Sorry.”
He turns then, shoulders facing forward.  The distance between us feels like it’s growing despite both still being sat on the sofa, and I feel like I need to explain further.
“And it's obvious that there's a lot going on for you at the moment and a lot at stake in terms of your career, and I don't want to be a. . . liability.”  The word sticks in my throat.
After a beat, we meet in the middle, lips crashing together as Sherlock’s large hands come up to cup my face, his palms warm against my cheeks, fingers pushing into my hair.  This kiss is nothing like our first -- it’s like a tidal wave dragging me under, Sherlock’s lips and tongue moving against mine in a tumult; hot, wet, and rather messy.  I haven’t been kissed like this in ages, if ever.
The flat was quiet and the air around them felt charged. Distantly, John knew the seconds were ticking by as he continued to trace light patterns over Sherlock’s skin. With everything that had happened tonight, a complicated mix of emotions was coursing through him, but the one currently at the forefront was attraction. A sense of being pulled towards Sherlock, just like on Sloane Street, and he was loath to let this moment end, not wanting to acknowledge the reality of their situation. Now that he knew Sherlock was, in fact, Prince William, he understood deep down that this connection between them would only last for this one night. How could they possibly continue this...liaison given the difference in status between them and the public nature of Sherlock’s life? John couldn’t see how it would work.
Glancing to either side to see if anyone is watching us, I mutter, “Fine.”
“No problem.  Love you, mate.”
I do roll my eyes then.  “Do not go through my stuff, Sherlock.  Number one rule of crashing at someone else’s place.”
Sherlock picks up one of the newspapers and flicks through the pages, pausing when he finds a news article about himself.  I shift onto my toes to see over the edge of the paper and can just glimpse an unflattering picture of him on the opposite page.  In the photo, he’s caught mid-turn, his hands slightly blurred by motion and his face appearing frozen in an expression of absolute disgust.
“This is simply not true!”  He turns to me and continues his story, “Because of Sherlock’s recommendation, I was able to get a role in one of his films, a bit part in
Twenty minutes later, when I’ve finished, I tuck the pages safely back in the folder, place it back in the cupboard and curl up on my bed, emotionally exhausted but pleased.
Sherlock seems a bit reluctant but eventually says, “John, if you have no prior engagements, would you like to go on a date with me on Saturday night?”
John smiled.
Sherlock snorts and strides purposefully towards a gate separating us from the lush gardens within.  Following one firm tug, as if to test the strength of the lock, he steps back and examines the wrought iron fence.  I watch in dismay as he steps up on the brick base of the wall and begins to lift his left leg, seeking out a foothold.
John tapped the soldier on the cheek and leaned down closer to his ear.  “Private, can you hear me?  Come on, lad, wake up.  Private!” The last was shouted directly into the young man’s ear, but there was still no response.  Feeling gently along the man’s neck and then up around his head, John recognised the wet, sticky feeling before he’d even pulled his hands away, red with blood.
~~Seven o’clock in the morning~~
I stretch languorously and push back my duvet.  Sitting on the edge of my bed, I fire off texts to Harry, Greg, Molly, and Mike -  all of them short and giving nothing away.  I contemplate deleting the text from the unknown number but, still feeling a bit unsettled, I decide to keep it for now.  With a yawn, I collect my dressing gown and shuffle down the corridor to grab the Guardian from where it’s dropped through my letterbox.
“Shit! Sherlock, shouldn’t you be getting back?”
“It would have been, if you had been there.”  Sherlock lifts his head then and despite the darkness of the room, I’m able to feel the intensity in his eyes.  “It’s always you.  John Watson, you keep me right.”
Sally snorts.  “Don’t give yourself too much credit.  I think Harvey Weinstein still holds that title.”
Sherlock smirked.
I shift up in the bed so I can look him in the eye.  “Pretend I didn’t say all that rubbish just now and ask me again.”
With barely a nod of acknowledgment, I flag down the bartender.  “Bruichladdich.  Double, please.”
“Good evening, doorman, please let us through,” Sherlock said imperiously, putting years of issuing royal commands to use, and slapped his hand down on the edge of the podium.  Perhaps that had been a bit too aggressive.
The gravel on the path crunches beneath shoes as someone walks towards us from the left.  I’m casting about for a place to hide, panicking slightly when there’s nothing nearby that will cover both me and Sherlock, when I’m spun around and gently pushed forward, Sherlock’s palm in between my shoulder blades.
⟪I can be at your shop in twenty minutes.  SH⟫
Staring straight ahead at the bottles of alcohol that line the wall behind the bar, I say, “Sherlock is in my flat.”
“Yes, Your Majesty.  I am happy to be of service.” Lestrade replied, bowing his head as the King rose from his desk and approached.
Sherlock’s large hands were spread across John’s back, holding him, guiding him. Their heads
Sherlock rose from his chair and John followed, leaving behind the remainder of his cold tea.
“Nor should you be,” Naga says in an attempt to keep things running smoothly.  “I think it’s important that addiction is discussed openly, so that we can begin to dismantle the stigma and sense of shame that surrounds it.  When people like you step forward to share your journey, it can only help pave the way for others to open up about their stories.”
As always, thanks to @zigster-ao3 and @eternaljohnlock for helping me with this chapter! x
“Or I could drive you?” The offer just burst out of him. John looked surprised as well.
It’s odd to go about your normal, day-to-day tasks after something extraordinary has happened.  I’ve been staring at a list of titles to be ordered since I arrived at the shop earlier this morning like it’s suddenly written in a foreign language.  I’ve made thousands of orders before and now my brain seems to have omitted the process.
After the beer and whisky earlier in the night, Sherlock had had enough alcohol, so he shook his head, loath to shout over the music and loud chatter that filled up the room. Instead, he diverted them along the floor, closer to the band, and once they had passed the swarm of people near the bar, Sherlock noticed that there was enough room for a dancefloor. Various couples had paired off and were dancing to a slow jazz number. The unlucky men, who greatly outnumbered women at this party, were lined up along the wall, watching.
.  Just after eleven o’clock, I brush my teeth and, once again, slide into a cold, empty bed.
“Typical of family and close friends, I’ve found.”
Sherlock ambled further into the room plucked a glass of champagne off a tray being held stoically by a middle-aged waiter - stiffness in right arm, wounded-in-action early in the war - in the corner, aiming to give the impression that he was settling into this tedious soiree.  He pressed the glass to his lips and pretended to take a sip, tongue darting out by reflex to clear away the droplets that remained behind.  He suppressed a shudder - champagne was truly awful.  Mycroft appeared to revel in holding a glass in his hand, like it made people take him more seriously.  It seemed Mycroft was always trying to prove himself a man.
“Oh, I, uh, just thought you might like something else to wear.  None of my shirts will fit you, unless you don’t mind busting out of it like the hulk.”  Poor attempt at humour, Watson.  “Err. . . but I’ve got a t-shirt here.  Better than nothing, I suppose.”
He attempted to catch Sherlock's eye and wave him off, but the stubborn git was intent on the Colonel. Sherlock stood tall, posture perfect, and his entire demeanor rang with authority; John nearly gasped at the physical change to his friend.
“Wait, aren’t you dating the woman who played Evka?  You know, oh, what’s her name?” Harry asks, her voice loud and her lips stained red by the wine.
“Yeah, of course.  Thanks, Greg.”
⟪Slight problem.  I have no cash on me and I do not want to risk connecting my bank card to your address. SH⟫
“Oh my gosh, can you remember your line, the one from the scene where Petr and Evka find each other again?” Molly asks with a squeal.
He decided to give voice to these questions. “Where were you headed earlier?  In the taxicab, I mean.  Were you expected somewhere, by a girlfriend, perhaps?” He knew he was being rather obvious with the question, but he had to know.
There was a moment of silence, during which his parents studied him with a sense of displeased resignation, and Sherlock wondered how they would choose to proceed. Now that Sherlock had extended an invitation to breakfast, it would be impossibly rude to send John away. While they deliberated, Sherlock continued to smile up at them, guileless and expectant; an approach he had often employed as a child to smooth ruffled feathers and get what he wanted.
John coughed and moved farther into the kitchen, assessing their options. Something simple and quick, that’s all he had the energy for.
John tilted his head back to have a better view up his nostrils, not the most flattering angle but he wanted to ensure that the bleeding had stopped. He could see a bit of dried blood but no bright red indicating fresh bleeding.
“What?”
Mycroft rode nearest. He had always looked serious and disapproving to John, but time and grief had etched another layer of severity into his features. He was about to be crowned as the next King of the United Kingdom, so perhaps some of that was warranted.
Mac shrugged.  “Aye, but I’m also not going to let it bring down the night, ‘specially with all the girls right here.  Who needs the Curzon?”
“John,” Sherlock says, and I pause at the door.  “Thank you.”
I make my escape from the coffeeshop as quickly as I can and head over to open up my shop for the morning, unlocking the security gate outside the main door with one hand, pushing the wrought iron doors back to meet the exterior wall.  I kick some rubbish from the entry where it’s collected, having blown in overnight, and unlock the door, the bell greeting me happily as I enter.
~~ Two-forty-five in the morning~~
I desperately want to unlock my phone and read the message he sent.  I won’t give him the satisfaction of knowing how thrilled I am that I now have his number, so I pocket my phone instead.
“That. . . you. . . it’s mutual.  All of it,” Sherlock says in a rush and then collects himself.  “I recognise that there is a certain expectation of who Sherlock Holmes is based on interviews and appearances, but I think it’s important that you know that it’s not an accurate representation of me, not really.”
When the food is ready, I serve it onto two mismatched plates and turn to set them on the table, only to find Sherlock once again in my chair.  This seems to be becoming a pattern and instead of asking him to move, I just accept that I have a new chair and sit down across from him.  We eat, focused on the food in front of us, occasionally taking a sip of coffee, and altogether avoiding eye contact.
“Call him.  Tell him what’s going on and ask if he’s noticed anything suspicious.  If you can’t get him, let me know and I can ask the guys to investigate.”
Sherlock’s text arrives just as I’m sitting down to eat my dinner.  I do some quick mental maths and figure out that it’s nearly two o’clock in the afternoon where he is, meaning he’s suffered through five hours of interviews so far.  Even though I know that must be awful for him, I feel a momentary sense of sympathy for the people who are scheduled to interview him later in the afternoon.
He is fascinating and there were so many things I want to ask him. Just as I open up my mouth to ask one of the many questions rattling around in my head, the bell over the door rings and Anderson stumbles back into the shop, expensive cappuccinos in hand.
John looked interested at that.  “Oh?  What’d he do?”
Sherlock stood before the mirror in his chambers, scrutinising his appearance as his valet made final adjustments to his tie and sleeves.
His captors faltered. “Your friend, Your Majesty?”
My lack of enthusiasm doesn’t stop her from blatantly hitting on me every time I come in either.  She even flirts via Anderson, which is even weirder -- I don’t want Anderson to be involved in any part of my love life, especially not playing some sort of Chinese whispers matchmaker.  He’s endlessly disappointed that I don’t take her out, despite my numerous attempts to make it clear to him that I’m not interested.  I think this is mainly because he’d like to date her himself and living vicariously through me is the next best thing.
It just slips out.
After a conflicted pause, Sherlock glanced over at John and was met with a surprised smile. “Me neither.”
It’s rare that I feel grateful to have Anderson in the shop, but there are exceptions and today I accept his help and hide myself away in the office for the rest of the morning.  Besides sorting through a stack of papers on the desk, I attempt nothing else productive, instead choosing to play solitaire on the computer.  Greg texts at one point asking if I’ve received any other messages and I’m able to stem his worry as well as my own.
“Although it may surprise you to find out that I am not, in fact, an expert in all fields, I am not well versed in comics.” He says, quirking a brow in a hint of humour despite the earnestness in his eyes as he proceeds with his comment on my work.  “However, regardless of my lack of familiarity with this medium, I think this --” he places his hand on the comic “-- is remarkable.”
My eyes snap to his and his mouth curls up into a shy smile.
He chuckles, the vibrations cascading down my arm where it’s pressed against him.  “I don’t -- I’m making it up.”
“Don’t be tedious, John.  I’m climbing over, of course.”
⟪First lovers’ quarrel, hm?  Glad he’s all right though.  The number didn’t give us anything - probably a burner.  So even though you’ve blocked it, I wouldn’t be surprised if you got more from another number.  If you do, send me the screenshots and we’ll add them to the file.⟫
“No, I don’t think he will, at least not soon.  He seemed rather certain that his point had been made when he left.”
Oh, god, she really doesn’t give up.  Thankfully, I don’t even have to make up an excuse this time.  “Sorry, Janine.  I’ve got plans -- it’s my sister’s birthday so we’re going to celebrate.  Have a great time though.”
“Okay.”
“Oh, that.  A means to an end and nothing more.”
“Fine.  You win.  I’ll show you how to get to Trafalgar Square, but can we get a pint first?”
He shakes his head and then looks up at me, grey eyes wide.  “Tea?”
“Typical,” Sherlock grumbles, selecting another newspaper from the stack.
John nodded. “Very good, Ashford. I’ll make my rounds shortly to meet them all. Can you and Taunton assess the state of the storage room down by the mess hall to see if it could be cleared and used as another ward, perhaps for those about to be transferred out?”
The question earned another round of taunts and jibes thrown in Benton’s direction, which continued for a bit before Ste got around to answering him.
Well-tended grass blankets the ground on either side of the path, with pockets of flowers surrounding the bases of the tall trees that are scattered throughout the garden.  I assume that at some point someone strategically planted each one for peak aesthetic privacy.  They completely block from view any of surrounding houses, only a dim light filtering through the leaves.  There’s a gap in the trees through the middle of the garden so that the canopies open up to the heavens.  If there wasn’t so much light pollution in London, we might be able to see more than a handful of the brightest stars.
with Sherlock.  And in order to ask that of him, I need to make a big gesture, something worthy of him.
I glance at my watch.
A taxi was idling at the pavement with Prince Henry and Major Lestrade seated inside. The Prince was glaring out the open window nearest them, while Lestrade stifled a yawn from the passenger seat. Sherlock considered them briefly and then turned to John.
No, there would have been something more to draw you into the Army.  It was not the path you envisioned for yourself, clearly.  You are intelligent and capable, with a schoolboy dream of attending university for medicine, but that did not pan out as you had hoped.  Trouble with finances -- a gambling problem. . . ah, your father.”  Upon making this deduction, Sherlock stumbled, hoping he had not caused offense by revealing something so personal.  John eyes widened, but otherwise he did not react.  Sherlock quickly scanned John’s face for some indication that he had not pushed too far before continuing, “Well, becoming an Army medic must have seemed like a decent alternative then.  Not to mention the fact that you are decisive and brave. Two qualities which were, I am certain, immensely desirable in a combat medic.”
The man glances from the book in his hand back to me, an amused look dances across his features and and I can feel a flush creep up the back of my neck.
“Apologies, sir,” the doorman said, addressing the men behind them.  “If you would kindly just wait a moment, then this will be all sorted out.”  Turning back, he says to Sherlock and John, lips pursed with displeasure, “Gentlemen, if you are not members of the club, then you must be on this list, and as you are not, then I need permission from the General or the Major in order to permit you entrance.”
“The name is Sherlock Holmes.”
In typical fashion, this...just sorta happened. I needed a break from my WIP so I decided to pick up this little story again, with no set idea of where it would go. I thought it'd be steamy because of the lyrics of the song Slow Hands. John and Sherlock, however, had a different idea, so it's more sweet and silly because they're idiots in love. Obviously. Hope you enjoy!
“I don’t think you could ever be ordinary, Sherlock.” It sounded like an accusation, but he was fairly certain he hadn’t meant it that way. As shocking as the revelation that Sherlock was, in fact, Prince William had been, there was still something amazing about Sherlock that John could not deny.
Any restraint I had vanishes at the look on Sherlock’s face and I grab him by the back of his neck to pull his mouth down to mine, chasing his tongue and sucking at his bottom lip.  I can feel his moan down to my toes, my knees going a bit week as a result.  We seem to make the decision to seek out a soft surface at the same time, manoeuvring inelegantly through the kitchen door and down the hall to my bedroom.
“Yes, it was just fine, Anderson.  Thanks.  How about you?” I reply.   I refocus on the list in front of me like I’d actually been working when he’d entered in hopes that it will keep this conversation short, but Anderson is oblivious.  My question sets him off on a detailed explanation of his weekend exploits.
John fished the key out of his jacket pocket and inserted it into the lock. The hinges creaked loudly as the door opened, which could really use some grease; John made a mental note to fix it at some point. He gestured for Sherlock to precede him up the stairs, but before he could raise his foot to the first step, the door of flat A opened and the tired face of an older woman appeared.
I chuckle at that.  “Yeah, well, it feels like a lot has happened in that time.”
“Right, of course.”
“To a pub?”
With that, Sherlock turned to face the lion above him and, placing his hands on the cement base, pushed himself up, knees scrabbling slightly to gain purchase on the hard surface.  He stood, reaching out to balance himself on the back of the bronze sculpture, and looked down at John’s annoyed face below him.
I push back my chair and stumble around the desk in embarrassment at being caught in such an unprofessional state. “S-sorry, I didn’t realise anyone was here. Just a bit of a bad moment there, I’m afraid, not usually one to talk to myself.” I am ashamed to note that I giggle then, a nervous habit from my school days that I just can’t seem to shake. “Can I help you find anything?”
John sipped his tea, unsure of what to say now. He was reminded of the last time they sat with a pot of tea between them, brewed by Sherlock himself in the wee hours of the morning at Harry’s small flat in Battersea. How different this table seemed in contrast, with its beautiful silver and porcelain china, everything matching and polished to perfection, and a footman attending to the specific ceremony of afternoon tea. Although John’s cottage at the hospital was quite comfortable, and had its fair share of modern refinements, it still paled in comparison to the life Sherlock led here at Kensington Palace.
“So?”  Greg prompts, sipping on his black coffee.  “Tell me everything.”
John huffed out an annoyed breath. “Just come here. I need you to apply pressure to the man’s head wound.”
It’s a kiss of longing and tenderness and desire.  Sherlock is holding me so tightly it’s hard to breathe and he’s making small, needy mewling sounds that cause my heart to ache for him.  He’s also rutting against me, but between the weight of him pinning me down, the suffocating duvet and the fact that he’s still wearing his tux, I suddenly feel completely trapped and desperate to get my hands on him.
Sherlock
“Do you want to talk about it?” I ask, breaking the silence.
“Fine, yeah.  Been a bit of a weird week, but, you know, I’m muddling through.”
“John?”  Sherlock whispers, his voice sounding loud in the silence.
“That was terrible, John!”  Sherlock glared at the other man and pushed the flask back at him.
“Good evening, John.”  He stands abruptly and we look at each other for a beat before he extends his hand towards me.
-- but I choose to ignore it.
As I’m having my little freakout, Anderson’s returns, sheltering our lunches under his coat.  Now that he’s back, I realise how perfectly timed the man’s visit was.  He was waiting until I was alone to confront me -- no witnesses that way.
“Indeed.  What is your point, Captain?”
Walters placed a sterling silver tray of finger sandwiches and cakes on the table and began pouring tea into two gold-rimmed porcelain tea cups from an etched silver pot. He glanced up at John enquiringly, and John realised he was subtly asking how he took his tea.
“It’s me,” Sherlock rumbles back.  I imagine the look on his face to be a combination of amused and ‘oh, you poor, dim-witted human’.
My heart stutters and I inhale sharply.  Before I can answer his question, the bell above the door rings again and Harry swans in, a chaotic swirl of layers and scarves.
The hushed sounds in the garden are interrupted by the metallic grinding of a key in a lock and a screech as a garden gate is opened.
Sherlock emerged as John was putting the cap back on the bottle of vinegar and reshelving it. He stood in braces with his shirtsleeves rolled up to the elbow, forearms thin and pale. John forced himself to focus on Sherlock’s face, now clean, but his nose did appear a bit red and swollen. Not worryingly so, but John wanted to take a look anyway.
It’s odd being in the flat on my own again.  In five days, I have grown accustomed to having Sherlock here, and now it’s too quiet and strangely unfamiliar.
The casual way he asks the question causes my mouth to drop open as I turn back to Sherlock, questions flying through my mind.  Sherlock won’t meet my eye, instead he glares at the man and says, “John, this is my horrid brother, Mycroft.”
“Whadja just say to me?”
“Erm. . . right.  Well, Sherlock visited the shop earlier this week.”
Sherlock cocked his head enquiringly. “Why? I wasn’t even here.”
“Am I allowed to kiss you again?”
“I’m with you, Harry.  I don’t want him to be scared to at least give it a go.”  He turns to me and continues, “If it doesn’t work out, then we’ll deal with it, yeah?  But you’ve been hiding yourself away in this shop for years, like some timid book mouse, Johnny, and then Sherlock arrived and it was like you’d reclaimed a bit of yourself.  Maybe part of it was coming out, but I think a lot of it was just him.  He makes you brighter and bolder, or something.  You smile more with him.  Just don’t run away from it before it even has the chance to become something real -- isn’t that just what Sherlock did before?”
He looks at me sharply.  “Yes.”
Sherlock had taken a step towards me, but then draws up short.  “John, it’s what was necessary.  I --”
“Welcome back,” Naga Munchetty says, perfectly manicured hands clasped together in her lap.   “You know him for his appearances in the West End, on the silver screen, and in blockbuster films, however it was a revelation about a past stint in rehab that landed Sherlock Holmes in the headlines last week.  The story, which first appeared in the Daily Mail, alleges that over a decade ago, Mr. Holmes spent three months in a rehab facility in Switzerland overcoming an addiction to cocaine.  The actor, who is notoriously tight-lipped about his private life, released a statement over the weekend confirming that he was previously admitted to a rehab programme but not commenting on any of the other details that appeared in the original article.”
“Classic. Just classic. All our effort to tempt visitors into reading about Laos or Cambodia or wherever and somehow we’re down £347.”
“Oh, do contain yourself.  I wish to do nothing of the sort.  I simply meant that today marks the end of a war, the likes of which we will never see again, God willing, and our people are able to breathe a sigh of relief and celebrate the fact that they still have blood pumping through their veins and, if they dare to believe it, there is now the opportunity to live the life they had only seen in their dreams.  So we can choose to honour the sacrifices of our people by waving from a balcony and giving speeches, or we can be with them as they experience this new peace.” His elocution tutor would have been proud of the way he delivered that speech, clear and full of conviction.
Sherlock grins.  “No need to apologise.  I find that to be the norm for most people.  You are an exception to the nincompoop rule.”
Thanks to @eternaljohnlock and @shylockgnomes for being lovely betas for this chapter!
The response comes immediately.  ⟪No, not necessary.  SH⟫
“Oh, you know, I’ve got some very big plans.”
I realise that Janine has been talking at me while making my cappuccino and I’ve not taken in any of it.  She seems to be finishing a story about her flatmate’s new job at a bar in Soho so I tune back in to hear her say “. . . and the other night the drummer from that band, you know, the one that was just on the Graham Norton Show, came in with a bunch of his friends and after serving them drinks all night, she went and partied with them at their hotel and they gave her tickets to their gig tonight.”
“Maybe he regained consciousness enough to stumble a few meters before falling again?”
“Shit!” That can’t be right, surely?
I shake my head.  “You didn’t hear the way he was speaking.  He’s not a fan.  He’s a creep who thinks he’s entitled to be involved in this.”  I gesture between us, not sure what to call our relationship yet.  “I tried to queue up the CCTV but it’d been wiped.  Sherlock, this guy clearly has money and contacts, at least enough to hack into my system.”
Rising from his chair, Sherlock looked down, a challenge in his eye. “Come on, John. Are you going to lose your nerve now?”
The change in height and position meant that they were perfectly aligned and John blanked out momentarily with the realisation that he could feel Sherlock’s erection nudging against his own through their trousers. Groaning, he pulled himself closer with one arm, while tightening his grip on Sherlock’s hair with the other, licking into Sherlock’s mouth, sucking on his bottom lip. It was wet and messy and glorious.
“Sir, are you certain you wouldn’t be more comfortable in your tails or perhaps your tuxedo?” Collins asked, a worried frown creasing his forehead.  Collins had been eyeing his choice of tweed ever since Sherlock had pulled it out of the armoire after Mycroft’s announcement an hour ago that they were permitted out of the palace.
This simple sentence causes my breath to catch.  Greg sometimes has the ability to make me stop and reassess my cynical outlook of life.  Where I tend to brush things off with sarcasm, he strikes right to the heart of the matter, resulting in a gentle reminder of what’s actually important in life.  There are times when I envy his pragmatic optimism, but today I’m just so grateful for the fact that I can count him as my friend, that he’s here walking through Hyde Park with me full of support and good-natured humour while asking about my relationship with Sherlock.
I proceed to finish off the glass in a succession of gulps and set the glass back on the bar.  Greg and Mike exchange a glance.
“No, not in a rush,” he responded, “Doesn’t look like anyone’ll be getting anywhere quickly tonight.”
From an outside perspective, they do seem to have remarkable energy about them, and it’s easy to envision them seeking further adventure for years to come. And it seems fitting that to mark the next stage of their lives they held a ceremony to celebrate their civil partnership at Windsor Castle on 11th December last year. It was a simple ceremony with only family and close friends in attendance.
“Since when?” Molly teases.
Thanks to my lovely beta bees @zigster-ao3, @eternaljohnlock and @88thparallel for their help in sorting this chapter out! x
By the time the eggs were done, the kettle still hadn’t boiled so they sat down at the table and dug into their middle-of-the-night meal, served on mismatched plates and eaten with cheap tin forks, of which John was hyper aware, but Sherlock didn’t seem to notice.
My phone is blinking furiously when I wake up on Sunday morning after a long lie-in.  I swipe it unlocked and am greeted by thirteen new text messages.  Instantly, my heart rate speeds up over the possibility of who they’re from -- surely Sherlock hasn’t texted so much so soon?  I don’t think I’d really mind if he did, however, despite the fact that it would seem like a bit much from anyone else.
“I know, Sherlock.”
John snorted, “Yeah, sure. It all sounds so innocuous when you phrase it like that. Maybe running through dark alleyways while being chased is just an everyday occurrence for your lot then?  And who are you, anyway?”
“Yes! I got it!”
As always, thank you so much for reading along - I hope this fic has brought you as much joy as it has me. Only one more chapter to go! Can you believe?!
“Have you told Greg?”
Once the now-iconic photo of them leaving Westminster had been published, speculation began on if and when the couple might have their own ceremony when the law was enacted. As is typical with royal couples, the country was gripped by the possibility of this union, and Sherlock and John soon found themselves the topic of conversation at dinner tables, on the covers of tabloid magazines, and having bets placed on them by bookies from Bristol to Aberdeen. “We were far too old for all that,” John says, with a laugh. “I couldn’t understand all the fuss for two doddering old men like us.” To which Sherlock replies, “John has never understood that he is endlessly fascinating, regardless of his advancing age, so of course the public would love him, just as I do.”
I grin at him instead.  “Thank you.”
As Meeks wrapped up his account of the accident, a sharp voice demanded from the mouth of the alley, “What’s going on here?”
The doorman nodded and began scanning through the long list of names in front of him, his stubby index finger keeping his place as he moved down the page.  Sherlock narrowed his eyes and waited for the man to reach the end, when he would realise they did not belong.  It did not take long.
I mentioned this in the notes of a previous chapter, but as people have been asking about a few different elements of this story (e.g. John's comic and the velvet box), I may explore a few short stories set in this universe to finish off some of those story arcs that didn't fit within this fic as it stands.  Like you, I'm dying to learn how John is planning to propose to Sherlock! :)
Sherlock groaned. “You sound like Mycroft.”
“Would you care to take a seat?”  The man asked, oddly formal, standing at the back of the chair opposite as though waiting for John to accept before sitting down himself.
Sherlock pauses briefly, apparently refreshing the line in his mind, before reciting, “Ačkoli se dny cítily nekonečné a naše šance byly malé, udělali jsme to, mou lásku, vlastní srdce.”
Current stitch in his abdomen and worries over mouthing off to a superior officer aside, John realised he was having fun. Actual, god’s-honest fun. It wasn’t something he experienced much recently and so it was, therefore, all the more startling to recognise its reappearance.  And, if he examined the timing, it coincided with another unexpected arrival in his life in the form of one Sherlock Holmes, who was currently sprinting down the pavement ahead of him, long legs flying.
“You said earlier that owning a bookshop isn’t the normal route for an ex-soldier, which I suppose is true if one is only considering society’s narrow expectations for how life should play out. . .” he pauses, eyes focused out the window over the sink, and takes a sip of his tea.   “You were clearly well regarded, most likely moving up in rank quite quickly -- even after you were wounded, surely the Army could have found a place for you away from active duty.  Perhaps they did but you turned it down.”
“Sherlock?”
Chelsea Barracks, when they finally reached it at quarter to two, was still lit up brightly, despite the hour; clearly the party was still in full swing. At the gate, two young sergeants on duty, monitoring the crowd entering and exiting the barracks. Along with the others enthusiastically queuing up to enter the barracks, there was an occasional couple exiting, disappearing off into the night with furtive whispers, expectant looks, and laughter. The guards saluted John as they made their approach, and Sherlock stuck close to his elbow, but the sergeants did not question the presence of the civilian in John’s company.
Watching Sally and Sherlock plan their approach for handling the news about Sherlock’s past visit to rehab reminds me of a chess game.  Sherlock is seated on the sofa and Sally is lined up opposite him, perched on one of the chairs from the kitchen.  There is collection of newspapers from the last three days littering the table; they are covered in markings and post-it notes where Sally has tracked the shifts in coverage since the story broke.  She’s also printed off a draft statement for Sherlock to review as well as a long-term strategy for handling questions in his upcoming interviews.  They’re squabbling about them at the moment.  Unsurprisingly, Sherlock has opinions and Sally is rapidly making changes to the documents on her tablet, nodding in agreement with some of Sherlock’s demands and putting her foot down about others.
“A taxi? Oh, honestly,” sighed his mother.
We kiss and kiss and kiss.
I turn to him, nerves trickling back in.  “Yeah?”
⟪Fine. SH⟫
It’s a beautiful spring day, so I find a section of wall to perch on and each my lunch in the sun.  I’m about to return to the shop when my phone chimes, a sound that I’m beginning to look forward to hearing in a way I’ve never done before.
“Despite a lingering feeling of disbelief, I think I am happy really.  I know it’s been a bit of a rollercoaster, but it seems like we’re finally on the same page about everything.  And he’s so bloody beautiful, Greg.  I know you don’t want to hear the details, but you have to admit he’s beautiful.  Beautiful and mine.  What the hell?”
“It’s not terribly unusual, but it would have derailed my career if it had broken at the time, at least that’s what I was led to believe.”
With Anderson out of the shop, I have to cover the till so I emerge from the office grudgingly, like a bear woken too early from hibernation.  It’s been quiet today and I hope it stays that way.  While I wait for my lunch to be delivered, I doodle on some scraps of paper, attempting to plan the next section of the comic book.  After ten minutes, I only have a loosely connected series of words and drawings, which will need a lot more work before I can hand it over to Harry, but it’s a start.
“Ignoring it will make him seem like a machine, and a guilty one at that.  No, he has to comment on it.”
I spend the next half an hour focused on making a potato fry up with sausage, tomato and spinach, while my nerves dance the conga in my stomach.  I can’t decide if I’d rather race down the hall and demand to know what Sherlock thinks or pretend it’s not happening at all and never ask him for his assessment.
I bark out a laugh and then realise he’s serious so I push back from the table and go to retrieve the packet from the counter.  When I return to the table, he’s slipped on his suit jacket and buttoned the middle button.  Stained shirt and coat hanging over a forearm, he reaches out to select a Hobnob and then heads to the front door.
Sherlock’s face takes on an expression of shock, like I’ve offended him by siding with Armon, but then he huffs and says “fine”.  Before getting out of my lap, he kisses me, once again putting on a show for those watching us, which is exceptionally awkward now that our audience is more than just Sally.  But I’m not going to worry about it too much considering he obviously trusts these people enough to be open about who we are to each other in front of them.
“You’re worse than a fucking schoolgirl, mate.”
This was different. He felt stretched thin, nerves frayed, and the cause of his worry was currently marching behind him. Sherlock wondered what Papa and Mummy would make of John, for it simply was not protocol for guests to arrive at the palace without some warning. He usually relished keeping them on their toes, but in this instance, he was desperate for it to go smoothly.  And never mind the hundreds of staff that flitted through the palace, who seemed to thrive on gossiping about the undignified behaviour of the second son, for Prince William turning up at dawn with an unknown man would certainly set tongues wagging throughout the palace.
It was raining.
Compliment aside, John was caught on this new name. “Who’s Mycroft?”
John caught his eye and nodded towards the bar. “Do you want a drink?”
“They’re idiots.”
“Since now.  They’re all awful, even you lot and that includes my own brother.  You’re not worth the trouble.”
“I’ll just have to bother you all day, or snoop through your things.  One or the other.”  He shoots me a cheeky grin and then plucks his coffee cup from the table, looking far too pleased with himself as he brings it to his lips.
I stroke my fingers through his hair and say, “I’m sorry, Sherlock.  It should have been a happy night.”
In the middle of his seething invective, a movement in his peripheral vision caught his attention.  A man had just emerged from the door in the corner, carrying an armload of coats and he was making his way towards a small group of people preparing to depart.  A cloakroom, of course!  Sherlock had been distracted by Major Lestrade earlier when his coat had been removed by one of the staff and he had failed to notice where it had been taken.  Stupid, he berated himself.  Would the cloakroom be just a cupboard or would it be connected to other parts of the hotel?  He tried to picture the corridor outside and where other rooms ran off of it.
