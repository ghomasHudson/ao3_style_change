"God, yes." John closed his eyes, panting still from the amazing sensations. "That was amazing." He opened his eyes again, turning to look at his fiance with a smile. "You are amazing." He ran his fingers through Sherlock's curls.
Sherlock cried out when John sank his teeth into him and gripped tighter on their cocks. He moaned and bucked his hips faster as he approached his release. Groaning, he finally came, leaving trails of his release in the water.
John kissed Sherlock deeply, wrapping his arms under him so that he could bring Sherlock up. Their fronts were flush together, his lover's cock pressed between their abdomens. With each movement of John's hips, he made sure that Sherlock got friction.
Sherlock opened his eyes at the sound of a new voice, one he'd never heard before. He sighed and looked gratefully at the shorter boy, 17 years old if his memory served correctly, just transferred. His name was something common... Jim... or something like it. His thoughts were interrupted when Moran scoffed, "Freak here thinks he's better than us... we're gonna teach him a lesson." Sebastian turned back and punched Sherlock square in the nose, knocking him to the ground, "care to join us, John?"
!" He reared his hand back and slapped one of John's arse cheeks with a resounding smack.
John felt awful for bringing Sherlock to this again. It seemed like every episode that Sherlock had like this was because of him. He tried to get Sherlock's face tilted up so that he could kiss him or something, anything to get him out of this trap. "Sherlock, please don't cry. You're alright, you're safe."
Sherlock couldn't hear John over the music, just continued to run, pushing people out of his way. He ran all the way to the pool house, hiding in a closet once he got inside. He collapsed against the far wall, sobbing and curling up into a ball.
Sherlock woke early the next morning and found John still sleeping, but didn't wake him. Instead, he just watched him sleep. Sherlock didn't think he'd ever seen something so beautiful. He looked so peaceful and he smiled faintly up at him.
Sherlock smiled against the top of John's head, "I love you too, John Watson," he murmured. He closed his eyes and nuzzled closer to his fiance, knowing he would only have happy dreams with his lover in his arms.
Sherlock put on a lopsided smile and cocked his head to the side, "why are you looking at me like that?" he asked and kissed John on the cheek, "what are you thinking about?"
Sherlock nodded and hugged his father again. "I love you, dad," he said softly. "I love you, too son. I'm so proud of you." Mr. Holmes kissed his son on the forehead before sending him back to his fiancé.
John carefully climbed into the bed, moving around the various wires hooked up to his boyfriend, and he laid down next to him, hugging Sherlock back. "It's okay. I'm right here, and I'm not going anywhere." He rubbed Sherlock's back, trying to calm him down.
The judge frowned and shook his head, writing something down on the paper in front of him. Helen started to panic, she had no idea John would say such things and they were losing the judge. Sherlock grinned when John held up the ring, but everyone else gasped in shock and started murmuring. "Order!" the judge said, "silence! All of you, now!" Everyone quieted down and Helen immediately took the opportunity to stand.
They laid there together until the sun rose and Sherlock started placing gentle kisses all over John's face. "Time to get up, love... you have to go to school," he murmured.
John returned the kiss, melting against his husband. The day had been perfect so far, and it wasn't over yet.
Sherlock whimpered in relief and kissed John back, moving his hand to the back of John's head and rolling his lips against the shorter boy's. He took his free hand and rested it on John's hip, stroking gently and focusing all his attention on their kiss. Having never kissed anyone before, he was going purely on instinct and the few occasions he'd seen other people kissing.
John laughed a little, ending in a sigh. "Yeah, I guess. See you tomorrow then." He gave Sherlock one last, lingering kiss and then turned to open the door. He waved at Sherlock and then stepped inside, heading up to the flat.
Sherlock snuggled into John, "I'm a little sore, but okay otherwise." He looked up at John, "how are you? You're the one who had to find me... like that," he said softly and started tracing patterns on John's chest.
Sherlock smiled and looked his fiancé up and down, "I have to say the feeling is mutual." The tie accented John's eyes perfectly, just like Sherlock knew it would, and it almost made them sparkle. "We'll have plenty of time for that after the party." He held his arm out for John to take and grinned brightly at him.
John jumped a little as Sherlock caught him when he stood, but he relaxed back into the other boy and smirked. A tingle shot down his spine at the feel of Sherlock's lips on his neck and he reached up one hand to card through Sherlock's soft curls. "Well, if I'm beautiful and you're gorgeous, we'll be the best looking couple at school," he murmured.
John poked his tongue out at Sherlock, but followed him down the stairs, grabbing hold of his hand. He was excited to see what Sherlock had planned, but he also was hungry, and he could smell breakfast from halfway down. He was glad Sherlock had agreed to eat as well. It wasn't good for him to go so long without food.
Sherlock led them to his father's office where he was waiting with Ms. Rodin again. She greeted them and they took a seat at the table.
John sighed contentedly and opened his eyes to gaze at Sherlock. "You're more beautiful," he said with a hint of cheekiness. He pressed in a little closer to the other boy, enjoying the caresses on his sides.
John made a muffled grunting sound as Irene forced herself on him, and just as he was trying to push her away, he could see Sherlock in the door. His eyes went wide, heart breaking at the sight of his fiance looking so devastated, and he got an extra burst of energy. He shoved Irene to the ground as Sherlock ran off. "Shit!"
John quirked his mouth. He hadn't wanted to have to say all the details, because Sherlock didn't know what had happened, but he should have known that they were going to want to hear everything. "Sherlock and I were about to leave when a girl, Mary Morstan, came up to us and asked if she could speak to me alone. She took me around a corner and...She kissed me." He turned away, not meeting Sherlock's or Ms. Rodin's eyes. "I pushed her off, of course, and then I heard Sherlock shouting and I ran back."
"Or to punch him in the face," John added. He'd forgotten that during the trial they would actually have to come face to face with the bastard who almost killed both of them simultaneously.

This is the final chapter to the series and hopefully I will be posting more series in the future, with closer posts! Please continue to review and again, I thank you all for your support!!
Sherlock groaned in frustration and glared at his husband out of the corner of his eye. He knew he was going to tease, but had no idea he would be this cruel. "John...
touch him. Let him be the one to touch you first. If he reaches out for you, approach very cautiously, any sudden movements could snap him back into this. Don't mention the episode
Sherlock laughed, "I can't help it... you're just that irresistible." He smiled and opened the other car door, joining John in the back seat. He instructed Mycroft to take the other boy home and when they arrived at his flat, Sherlock walked his fiancé up the stairs and to his front door.
Sherlock frowned, he had an idea of why John's father didn't mention his second job, and it wasn't anything good. He quickly smiled before John could see the change in his demeanor and changed the topic to school. They continued to talk, Hamish and Siger seeming to get along very well, talking about things they had in common, which suprisingly was quite a bit.
John laughed and squirmed, momentarily escaping only to be attacked again. "I-I am!" he cried between laughs. "I'm ha-ha-happy, see?"
Sherlock was able to get his stitches removed that Wednesday, just in time for his wound to start closing up completely. He was glad for that, because he had
After several moments, Sherlock released John's lips, but rested their foreheads together. "I love you so much," he whispered and smiled at his fiancé. "I'm so sorry I ever doubted you, I promise it will never happen again." He lifted both his hands to cup the other boy's face and placed another soft kiss on his lips. Sherlock then stood up and held his hand out to help his fiancé up. "Come on, let's go back to the party... I want to dance with you again."
Sherlock grabbed John's hand and twined their fingers together. He smiled over at his husband and brought their joined hands up to his lips to place a kiss on the back of the other man's. "I love you," he said and squeezed John's hand.
John slipped his arms around Sherlock, watching out for his side, and pressed his face against Sherlock's neck. "I love you, too. Thank you for...for everything." For saving him and for coming back to him.
Sherlock bit back a smirk at John's reaction and turned to Mr. Watson with a smile. "Yes sir, if that's all right with you."
John met Sherlock's eyes, seeing exactly what he was supposed to see. Sherlock trusted him and it made him feel that much better about this. With both his hands, he pulled down Sherlock's pants and revealed his fully aroused length. John wrapped his fingers around it and slowly stroked, the rough skin feeling different in his hand than his own, but so good.
Sherlock's eyes widened as he realised what John was planning. He greedily sucked and licked his fiancé's fingers, coating them in saliva. He snuck a hand down to the other boy's arse and gave a squeeze, unable to help himself.
He found it hard to keep his hands to himself while they rode, but knew that as soon as he touched his fiancé, he wouldn't be able to control himself, so he sat on his hands and looked out the window, biting his lip and praying that they got home soon.
"The last time he did this... I found him shooting up cocaine three weeks later. I don't think I have to tell you what caused
John sighed as he watched Sherlock go, knowing that he probably wouldn't eat more than that. "Is he alright?" his father asked.
The next three days went by quickly and Friday afternoon after school, Sherlock stood outside waiting for John to get his overnight bag from his locker. As soon as he approached, he took his lover's hand and smiled at him, squeezing it. "Ready?"
John nodded even though Sherlock couldn't see. "I know. The same goes for you. I love you very much." He settled the phone between his ear and the pillow, closing his eyes so he could just concentrate on the sound of Sherlock's deep baritone.
Sherlock got up and washed his hands quickly, running back to join John on the bed. He wrapped his arms gently around him and kissed him softly on the lips. "I was thinking... we should have the dinner Friday night. That way you could spend the night with me after."
John let his head fall back with a moan as he was fully exposed. Everywhere that Sherlock touched, his muscles twitched. It was as though he were hardwired to Sherlock. He reached up to start undoing Sherlock's shirt, exposing the gorgeous pale skin which he proceeded to roam, fingers grazing the smooth lines of his body.
Sherlock decided then and there that the sound of John screaming his name in pleasure was his favourite sound in the world. He moved his head up and down, swallowing occasionally, trying to evoke more sounds out of his lover.
Sherlock chuckled, "well, I better get to it then, hmm?" He smiled and leaned down to kiss John again, prying his mouth open with his tongue and deepening the kiss. Moaning softly, he tangled their tongues together for a few moments before pulling away, slightly breathless. "We better stop... I'm not sure your father would appreciate walking in on a snogging session," he said and winked at John.
"Good..." John massaged Sherlock's scalp, being sure to get all his curls fully soapy. He chuckled and took some of the soap, putting it on Sherlock's chin. "I wonder how you would look with facial hair." He started dabbing the suds on Sherlock's face, creating a shampoo beard and moustache. "Still adorable."
John let out a relaxed groan as he was freed from the rest of his clothes, but soon returned to little whines and whimpers when Sherlock wouldn't touch his aching erection. He writhed at the lack of friction, trying to catch Sherlock's lips at least once.
Sherlock gasped and spun around, smirking at John, "Oooh... you cheeky bastard," he murmured playfully and lurched forward, pinning the other boy to the shower wall. "I think," he leaned down to whisper huskily in his ear, "that I'll have to take you up on me fucking you... I quite like the idea of being the first to have you that way." He nipped at John's earlobe and pulled away, smirking and finished rinsing off before stepping out of the shower and grabbing a towel for both of them.
John pressed down so he could grind into Sherlock as they kissed, but he made sure to only create minimal friction as he still wanted to tease Sherlock a little. He pulled away from his lover's kiss swollen lips and brought a hand up to trace them. "You are incredibly gorgeous like this," he breathed.
The rest of the afternoon went rather quickly and soon they were headed to Mary's for the party. Sherlock kept his arm around John's shoulders as they rode in the car and walked around to open the door for him when they arrived. "After you, darling," he said and smiled cheekily at the other boy.
Sherlock scrunched his face up and pushed on John's chest until their lips parted. "Sebastian... no, please... I don't want to do it, please don't make me..." he whimpered and curled in on himself, rocking back and forth.
Sherlock returned with his father then and they hugged tightly for several moments before Mr. Holmes pulled away and cupped his son's cheek, smiling at him. "I know you love that boy more than your own life, but I want you to remember that you are his life as well. When you marry him, you will become one person. Don't make any big decisions without him and remember that keeping yourself safe is important for his safety, too."
...I want you t-to fuck me...oh, that's good..." John reached down again and grabbed his arse.
Sherlock walked over and wrapped his arms around John's waist, leaning down to kiss him again. "Mmm... I'll just sit with you while you eat, I'm still okay," he said and smiled.
. I needed to testify... for me." He leaned in and gave him a quick kiss, resting their foreheads together afterwards. "If I hadn't told that story... Sebastian would still have been able to control me... to intimidate me and hurt me. But now... I feel freed. Thanks to you, John. You gave me the strength and courage I needed to testify." He smiled at his fiance and wiped the tears from his eyes.
"Anytime, love," Sherlock murmured and rested his cheek on the top of John's head.
Sherlock raised an eyebrow, "when have I ever treated you like a baby... or a dog?" He sat up and crossed his legs, reaching forward to take John's hands. "Come here," he said and pulled the other boy into his lap, wrapping his arms around his waist.
"Sherlock pushed me away and got...hit instead. Sebastian ran off after that and I called for an ambulance. Luckily we made it in time and they were able to save him." John let one of his fingers trail to Sherlock's wrist, feeling his pulse, and it calmed him.
Eventually, Mycroft came over with a handkerchief, insisting that they stop snogging in public and have some decency. Sherlock winked at John and finished cleaning him off with the handkerchief. "Musn't upset Myc too much, we're apparently embarrassing him in front of his date... Although, I don't think she's paying very much attention." He nodded over towards his table where a tall, dark haired girl was sitting, typing away on her phone.
Sherlock nodded and closed his eyes, feigning sleep. "Don't even bother..." He sighed as he heard his elder brother's voice come through the closed door. "I heard you two at it less than five minutes ago and I know you could not possibly have fallen asleep in such a short period of time, no matter how exhausted you are." Sherlock growled, "what do you
Sherlock took John's hand and walked over to his family. "Mum, Dad? John and I have something to tell you." Sherlock's parents turned to them and smiled, "what is it, boys?" Mrs. Holmes said, looking back and forth between them. He took a deep breath and squeezed John's hand, "We... have decided that we want to get married. I proposed and John said yes. We're engaged."
Sherlock frowned,
John couldn't say no. He groaned and rocked into Sherlock's hand, his own pulling on his lover's pants until they were fully off. He grabbed Sherlock's length, stroking him so that he could get enough precum to slick his fingers.
John kissed him back, letting Sherlock keep his movements going while he focused on what he was doing to his backside. He finally slipped a finger in, thrusting slowly in time with their moving hips. His other fingers teased around the rim of his entrance, and then he slipped in a second finger.
Sherlock smiled sadly, "doesn't mean she won't try to..." Just then his mother announced that the dining area was open and he stood to follow everyone else in, holding his arm out for John again.
Sherlock opened a door on the right side of the screen that revealed a sort of closet area filled with rows of films and the DVD player. "Any particular film you'd like to see? I'm sure we have anything you'd be interested in watching," he said from the closet.
Sherlock let out a low moan and slipped his own fingers into his lover's pants. "John..." he panted, "make love to me.
John pursed his lips. Of course, no surprise there. "Well,whatever. I don't have to drink anything to have fun." He looked up at Sherlock, smiling. "And we'll get to dance again, just like your birthday party."
Sherlock sighed happily and settled himself on top of John. "So..." he said, still stroking the other boy's face, "three days until we meet with the lawyer... Think you're ready?"
Sherlock smiled and took John's hand, leading him to the bathroom so they could take a shower. They managed to keep their hands to themselves and got out in time to meet Mycroft out front to go to school.
Meanwhile, the girl that had cornered Sherlock was still trying her best to grind against him. Sherlock groaned in frustration and pushed her away again, "Look... What's your name?"
John shifted on Sherlock as they kissed, so lost in their shared emotions that he forgot everything else but himself and Sherlock, together. He slipped his hands under Sherlock, around his neck to help pull him up a little to meet him. He let his tongue glide over Sherlock's lips and then into his mouth, feeling the familiar lines and crevices of his lover.
Sherlock nodded emphatically and whimpered, "yes... Yes,
Later that evening after Sherlock finished up his homework and worked on an experiment, he picked up his mobile to call John. He laid on his bed, staring at the ceiling while he waited for him to answer.
Disclaimer: I only own the story!
John couldn't help rolling his eyes a bit as Sherlock spoke French to the cabbie, but that was what happened when you had a genius for a husband. He had to admit, it was helpful since he didn't know a lick of French. They rode for about twenty minutes and then pulled up outside of a house. John turned to Sherlock with a raised eyebrow.
Sherlock smiled down at his boyfriend and leaned forward to press a soft kiss to his forehead, his nose and then one on his lips. "I'm so glad you're going to be okay, I was so worried," he whispered.
Sherlock chuckled and turned back to the screen. By the end of the film, he had settled very comfortably and had fallen asleep on John's shoulder, his face buried in the side of his fiance's neck.
Sherlock groaned and arched his back into his lover's touches. John could reduce him to a puddle within seconds and he
Sherlock intertwined his fingers with the other boy's and brought their joined hands up to the sides of John's head. He continued to kiss him deeply and rock his hips forward slowly, just enough for a little friction, but not too hard so as not to cause himself any pain.
Sherlock smiled, they lay there talking about their future until it was time for dinner. After they ate, Sherlock led his fiancé up to the bedroom and stopped in the middle, pulling John into his arms and leaning down to give him a long, passionate kiss. He pulled away slightly, eyes still closed. "John... I want to try something with you," he whispered against the shorter boy's lips.
The professor decided to let them run, he'd seen all their faces and knew their names. He immediately pulled out his mobile and called for an ambulance, then knelt down next to John and held his head up off the ground, taking off his blazer and laying it under his head. As soon as the paramedics arrived, John's father was called and he was rushed to the hospital.
"What happened next, was Sherlock still yelling out for you?" Helen asked. She was feeling a little emotional as well, because she knew what had happened from John telling it before, but the judge needed to hear all the details.
Sherlock's mother took his hand and looked at the ring, smiling back up at him, "simply beautiful," she said softly. Sherlock's father put a hand on his shoulder, "I'd like to have a little talk with you, son. You don't mind if I borrow him for a few minutes, do you John?" Mr. Holmes smiled and put his arm around Sherlock leading him away.
Sherlock walked them both to the table and let go of John's hand to pull out a chair for him. He took a seat next to him, his mother on his other side.
Sherlock smiled, "later darling, I love you too." As soon as John left the room he ran to his closet and pulled out a large chest. He pulled his necklace out from under his shirt and unlocked the chest with the key that hung from it.
John squeaked indignantly when Sherlock pinned him down, and kissed him back just as firmly. He followed Sherlock out of bed and locked their fingers together. "You know you could never upset me. And if you did I would let you know."
Sherlock nipped at John's hip bones and then his thighs before he licked the tip of his cock experimentally. He went back into his mind palace and dug out everything he had read on the Internet about fellatio and inhaled deeply before relaxing his throat muscles and taking as much as he could in his mouth.
Sherlock looked back at the two of them talking and chuckled, "looks like your father's back in the game, yeah?" he said and nodded towards them.
Sherlock sighed and rolled his eyes, "Oh, come on, John... I've read up on this and if we arrange ourselves correctly, it really shouldn't put much strain on either of us. Now take your clothes off and get in bed with me."
!" Sherlock moaned and gripped onto the other boy's shoulders, moving up and down as fast as he could. "
John pouted a little as Sherlock got up and then started buttoning his shirt up. He stepped out with Sherlock, shaking his head a little as he watched him fumble with the buttons. "Let me," he said, and nudged Sherlock's hands away to start doing the buttons himself.
frighten you." He held his breath in anticipation of John's reaction, he could hear his heart pounding in his ears.
Sherlock hummed sleepily and pulled John into his arms. He kissed him once and pulled away smiling. "As much as I enjoyed that... I think my favourite position is when I'm facing you. I get to kiss you more," he brushed a few stray hairs from John's forehead and kissed him softly again.
"Oh God, yes..." Sherlock moaned out and bucked his hips down again. His cock was still steadily leaking pre-cum and he whimpered as he felt his lover's tongue probe him. "
John shook his head. "I'm alright as long as you're here," he said, smiling back. "But do you think you could..." He shifted around a little, trying to see if he could make room in the bed around his various wires. "I'd like it if you could get in here with me. I know I'm going to have nightmares tonight. It always happens after something like this."
John laughed a little, relief flooding over him. He had to admit that he was a bit nervous, in spite of the fact that he knew Sherlock's parents were very easy-going. To see them laughing made him feel much better. When Mrs. Holmes pulled away from him he held out his hand and showed her the ring. It was a simple band, but it meant so much to him.
Sherlock followed John into slumber and was sleeping peacefully until a few hours later when he started to dream.
, now..." he moaned. He held on for a few more seconds before grunting and releasing deep inside his lover.
Ms. Rodin turned, "how did you?..."
Sherlock hummed in contentment, "and you," he kissed John on the lips, "
Sherlock groaned and let his head fall back on the pillow. He was shaking slightly from the anticipation of the pleasure he knew was coming. He continued to roll his hips down onto John's fingers, trying to get them deeper.
"Oi!" the officer standing next to him barked, "eyes down, what did I tell you?" Sebastian looked down at the table in front of him, but Sherlock could still see a smirk on his face.
Sherlock groaned into the empty bed next to him, but got up and hugged John from behind. He placed a kiss on the side of his neck and rested his chin on the other boy's shoulder. "I suppose I have no choice... since my pillow has decided to leave me," he said and chuckled.
Sherlock studied John's face as he looked at the mansion and judging by his expression he seemed embarrassed, but why?
Sherlock chuckled and finally had mercy on John, placing a couple of kisses on each thigh before engulfing his lover's entire erection in one go. He relaxed his throat muscles and started to work him slowly, swirling his tongue around the head of his cock.
"I know, trust me," Sherlock said and raised an eyebrow. He bent down slightly so John could reach the top of his head better and almost purred at the sensation. "Mmm... feels good."
"If it helps... I could ask my father if he could get you a job at the hospital. You could make money and get experience for school," Sherlock said and rubbed his hands along John's lower back, unable to stop touching him for even a moment.
John could barely think by the time it was over, and only just registered that Sherlock was licking his hand clean. He pulled his fingers out of himself and laid back with a groan. "God...That was incredible..."
Sherlock jerked as he felt the touch to his shoulder, expecting it to be another punch. He relaxed once he heard John's voice and opened his eyes, looking at the other boy's face for the first time. He was quite handsome, with his dark blue eyes and short dirty blonde hair. He was definitely an athlete with his broad shoulders and slightly muscular frame making up for his lack of height. "F-fine... I'm fine," he lied, his voice strained and shaking. He winced as another pulse of pain shot through his nose and he reached up to wipe the blood away with the back of his hand.
John let out little cries of pleasure as Sherlock fingered him. He swore, he could get off with those fingers alone, they were so long and talented. "Ah...oh, Sherlock...Dear, God." He scraped his fingers down Sherlock's back again, the only thing that he could do in his current state of complete madness. Sherlock reduced him nearly to a puddle.
John shook his head. "I hadn't even been going to the school that long before the first attack. Maybe a week."
John slowly moved downward, taking in more and more until he was halfway. Part of him was chuckling on the inside. He'd always been the one getting, not giving. It was so different, and yet now he found he could give to Sherlock exactly what he'd want done to him.
John grinned. "Good. That's all I want." He gave Sherlock a quick squeeze and then finished getting into his swim shorts.
Hamish ran up to the table with the Holmeses right behind and he hugged both of the boys at once. "You did well, lads. You did well." He turned to Ms. Rodin and shook her hand. "Thank you so much, for everything."
John was up much earlier than usual Monday morning. He sped on his bike all the way, swerving between cars and getting honked at by quite a few cars. He finally made it and parked out on the edge of the lot, then sprinted towards the entrance of the school. He could see Sherlock on the steps and his heart leaped in joy. "Sherlock!" he called, waving his arm in the air as he approached.
"As are you," John murmured against his lips, feeling content in Sherlock's embrace.
Sherlock smiled and held John close, sleeping more soundly that night than he ever had before. The next morning, he awoke with John still sleeping on top of him and he kissed his temple, smoothing his hands up and down his bare back, trying to wake him softly.
John let out a soft sound of content as he kissed Sherlock back. He smiled a little sadly at him. "I just wish that you had been my first too. My first time was really awful." He grimaced at the memory.
Sherlock smiled brightly and with his heart fluttering, he leaned down to press a kiss to John's forehead. He closed his eyes and held his lips there for a few moments before pulling away and looking into John's eyes, "thank you," he whispered. He loved the feel of John wrapped around him and knew that he could stay this way forever if their bodies allowed them to.
Sherlock had a feeling he knew what was coming next. He laced their fingers together and squeezed him once. Then he lifted his head to place a kiss on the side of John's neck, trying to comfort him.
Sherlock groaned and instantly wrapped his arms around his lover. He smiled up at him, "I have no idea, love... Why don't you tell me what
Sherlock's suit was cut just for him, and it accented the best features of his body perfectly. The purple of the tie contrasted beautifully with the pale skin of his long neck, and John licked his lips. "If we didn't have somewhere to be, I would rip that suit off of you and fuck you senseless."
Sherlock slept soundly knowing that John was safe in his arms. He felt a touch on his arm and hummed sleepily, rearranging his head and keeping his eyes closed.
Sherlock felt his heart pounding, wanting so very badly to take things farther but he didn't want to hurt John. He got an idea and pressed forward until John was laying on his back. He released his boyfriend's lips and pulled away far enough to look into his eyes. "I want to try something... Will you let me?" he whispered and searched John's face.
, I wish you could see yourself right now."
John groaned into the kiss, nibbling at his lower lip and sucking on Sherlock's tongue as it invaded his mouth. He pulled Sherlock's hand off of his cock and let go of his lover's so that they could grind together. This left both his hands free to reach behind Sherlock and peel his cheeks apart, teasing at his entrance with a few fingers.
John's eyes widened just a bit. Moran had put him in the hospital last time? Well, that was it. He was going to have to make sure that Sebastian Moran never laid another finger on Sherlock. He was a bit surprised when Sherlock took his hand, but he smiled and squeezed back. "You're very welcome." John bit his lip. Sure, he wanted to protect Sherlock, but that would be strange if they weren't friends. So he supposed that was the next step. "So, um...Are you doing anything today?"
Sherlock groaned and clung tightly to the other boy on the ride to his flat. He was close to nipping John's earlobe, but thought better of it. When they arrived, he stepped off the motorbike and waited for his fiancé to prop it up before smacking his arse. "Let's go upstairs then, love," he said cheekily.
John slowly became more comfortable with talking to Mrs. Holmes as he saw how sweet and kind she was. And the food got better with each bite he took. They never ate anything this good at home. Some days they didn't eat at all. It was nice to have a full stomach for once. Slowly but surely John was feeling more and more at home.
John looked up when Sherlock said that he hadn't eaten since Tuesday. It was Friday. "Sherlock, that's not-...not..." His spoon dropped into the bowl as his mouth dropped open. Sherlock was- "Gorgeous..." John blushed as he realised that he had said that out loud, but he couldn't have stopped it if he tried. Sherlock's skin was all pale and smooth, and for someone so skinny he certainly had some toning. Not to mention that without his trousers, John got a much better look at his arse.
John grinned, kissing him back and cupping his cheek. "I love you, too," he said, pressing his forehead to Sherlock's. "Now, you have to pick out something to wear for yourself."
Sherlock smiled gratefully at John and clinked their glasses together. He raised his glass to his lips and taking a sip. The driver turned to let them know they would be arriving soon and Sherlock took another drink and sat his glass in the holder in front of him. "Ready?" he said and smiled at John, grasping his hand and squeezing.
"I pushed her away and told her that I was with Sherlock, but she didn't say anything, just kind of smirked. And then I realised that something wasn't right. I ran back to where I had left Sherlock and could hear him calling my name as I got closer. The whole team had surrounded him again and were attacking him." He held back a shiver as he remembered. That was only the first time that he had been terrified of losing his fiance.
Sherlock groaned softly and bit his lip, trying to keep as quiet as possible. He braced one hand back on the bed and reached his other one forward to run his fingers through John's short, blonde hair. "Please..." he whispered and closed his eyes.
"Watch all you want, Mycroft," John said, taking his hand to shake it. "But I love Sherlock, with all that I am. I won't let him down."
John leaned back against Sherlock. "I love you, too," he said softly before starting the bike. He turned it around and started off for Sherlock's house again. He glanced back at his flat before they turned the corner, just a bit of longing in his eyes, and he sighed, facing forward again. Maybe Sherlock was right. Maybe it would just take time before his father was alright. At least, he hoped.
Sherlock smiled, glad to see John liked it. He walked over and stood beside the other boy at the game. "Hmm... you bet me, huh? What are the stakes, then?" He grinned and raised an eyebrow, this could definitely get interesting.
Sherlock got lost in the music for several moments, closing his eyes and continuing to move to the beat. After a while he opened them to smile at John, but it dropped from his face when he didn't see him anywhere. "John?" be called, trying to make his voice loud enough to carry over the music.
John shivered a little, hiking the blanket up so it created a shield. "F-fuck..." he stuttered out, trying so hard not to let his hips go wild. Sherlock always knew just how to drive him crazy. "More, please," he begged.
Sherlock smirked for a second before he straightened his face and got down on his knees in front of John, bowing his head. "Yes master," he said in a low voice.
"No, it's not," John sighed, putting his hands over where Sherlock's rested on his stomach. "The next part is just the harder part." He paused, gathering his thoughts, and then went on. "Somehow Harry fell into a bad crowd, and she started drinking. I think deep down she wanted to anyway because of all the stress. She'd come home almost every night completely sloshed. Da was furious. He kept telling her that she was a bad influence on me, but she didn't seem to think so. He threatened to take away her car if she didn't stop. I wish he had..." He swallowed. The worst part was just around the corner.
Sherlock didn't take John's shirt off, he just slid his hands up underneath it and lightly scratched his nails along his lover's stomach. He continued to suck and lick at the other boy's neck as his hands moved lower to work on undoing his trousers.
Once they were finished, Sherlock asked if he could bring their dessert to his room with them and his mother agreed to let them, saying she would have it brought to his room later. Sherlock hugged his mother good night and gave her a kiss on the cheek, whispering in her ear, "thank you, mum." Mrs. Holmes smiled and patted Sherlock's hand, "Of course, dear. Keep hold of this one, you seem so happy with him," she said quietly enough for just Sherlock to hear and winked at him, making him blush.
moment. "He f-fired and...Sherlock pushed m-me out of the way..." The tears fell one by one and he wiped his eyes furiously trying to stop them.
Sherlock pulled back and smiled softly at John, "I love you." He snuggled closer to the other boy and fell back asleep quickly.
yours." He came a little closer so he was standing directly in front of the other boy and turned around so his arse was facing him.
Mycroft nodded, "exactly. So, that's why it's so important that you follow my directions. I'm sure you probably understand now." He smiled warily at John and then back over at Sherlock. "I do care for my brother... and I understand him because I've been there. Of course, I never had to deal with quite as... damaging situations, but I did have my own."
John cried out, almost a scream, as Sherlock started aiming for the bundle of nerves. He couldn't even speak, he was so lost in the sensations, so he just clung more tightly to the ottoman and watched as he was thoroughly shagged, making desperate sounds.
Sherlock bit back a moan and shifted in his seat, feeling himself harden at the touches of his husband's wonderful mouth. He craned his neck to the side, trying to make it look like he was just stretching it out.
This was absolutely amazing. He was falling more in love with John every second and he felt like every nerve in his body came to life as John touched it with his fingers or lips. He was reduced to whimpers within moments and grabbed at the back of John's head, pulling him until they were face to face again. "Make love to me, John..." he whispered against his boyfriend's lips and pulled him closer for another deep, passionate kiss.
When they finally arrived, they dropped John's bag off in his bedroom before walking together to his father's home office where they would be meeting with the lawyer. Sherlock opened the door and found his father sitting on his desk, talking to a woman wearing two piece suit who was sitting in one of the chairs with a briefcase by her feet. They both stood as the boys entered.
Sherlock continued to kiss John as the song played, softly stroking his skin and keeping his movements slow.
John took a deep breath, trying hard not to bark at her to leave. Swiveling his stool around he grabbed Sherlock's hand while at the same time putting his free one out to shake Irene's. The hand with the ring of course. "John Watson," he said with an overly-bright smile. "Fiance is the correct term actually." He couldn't help lifting his chin a little in pride at his ability to use the word, especially to deter this girl from touching his Sherlock.
John sped home, parking his bike outside on the street before climbing up the stairs to his flat. He unlocked the door and stepped inside. "Da! I'm home!" he called. His father was lying on the couch, sleeping. John sighed and draped the blanket over him from the back of the couch before heading to his room. He laid on the bed staring up at the ceiling and holding his phone to his chest. He wondered if he should tell his father that he was falling in love with a boy. Some part of him was afraid. Sometimes his father blamed Harry and her homosexuality for their mother leaving. If John turned out the same...that would probably break him.
John nodded firmly. "I understand." He kept a tight hold on Sherlock's hand, though. That was one thing he was going to miss during the trial.
Sherlock moaned softly and continued to kiss John, caressing the other boy's tongue with his own. He pulled away to place kisses to the bruises on his face and neck, then placed one on his nose. "I love you," he whispered and closed his eyes, resting their foreheads together.
After several moments, Sherlock pulled away. He placed a final kiss to his lover's entrance and slipped a finger inside of him, the wetness from his tongue making it slide in easily.
John let out a cry as Sherlock's extra movement caused a hit on his prostate. He bent over, putting his hands on his lover's chest as he continued to move. "I...Yes, Sherlock, only for you...Fuck..." He bowed his head, fingers curling on Sherlock's skin.
John raised his eyebrows in surprise. He remembered asking Sherlock when he came back to sit down if anything had happened, but now it seemed that he had lied. "Sherlock, why didn't you say anything?" he asked, putting a hand on his shoulder.
John hummed softly, holding onto Sherlock as the other boy kissed his neck. He let his eyes flutter shut, just listening to that beautiful deep voice. "I don't know. We can do anything really. Just as long as I'm with you." He rested his cheek in Sherlock's hair, loving how soft and silky his curls were.
Sherlock chuckled, "okay then, but I get to choose this time." He led John over to the huge leather sofa in front of the telly and grabbed a couple of controllers. He held one out for the other boy to take. "Here... You may have me whipped at that fighting game nonsense, but I am the
"Yes... Oh
He ducked his head and blushed, extremely embarrassed over the entire display. When dinner was finally served, he relaxed a bit, taking a few bites before just pushing the rest of the food around on his plate.
John grinned back, happy at the prospect of Sherlock finally going back to school with him. "Yes, and then maybe our crazy classmates will stop thinking that I killed you or something." It would be very nice to get rid of the various stares and whispers of his peers and show them that Sherlock was alive and well.
John took the invitation and pressed a trail of kisses along the sharp line of Sherlock's jaw as he spoke. He liked the way that Sherlock's deep voice vibrated under his lips as he kissed him. When Sherlock looked back into his eyes, he smiled and put his hand over his fiance's. "Everyone who called you that just doesn't understand. Yeah, it's kind of bizarre when your whole life comes out of the mouth of a stranger, but it's also really fantastic. It's like magic."
John moaned more loudly and reached up to wrap his arms around Sherlock's neck. He was nearly there and he bucked into Sherlock's hand easily with the natural lubricant. "S-so close..." he whimpered, clinging tightly to his lover.
Sherlock hissed in pleasure as he felt John's fingers on his skin and he reached down to take his own trousers and pants off with shaking hands. Once he was fully nude, he laid on top of his boyfriend and ground their erections side by side, moaning and panting.
Mr. Watson hadn't even noticed that he still had a hold of Ms. Rodin's hand until she pulled away. He cleared his throat and put the hand she had been holding to the back of his neck. "Not a problem. Really..." He looked off awkwardly in another direction.
John nodded slowly, confused. "Yes...But I don't understand what you're getting at." He smoothed his thumb over Sherlock's cheekbone, seeing that the topic was hard for him to discuss and wanting to offer some comfort.
"Mmm... I agree," Sherlock murmured and wrapped his arms around the other boy. "I love you, John," he whispered and kissed the top of his head.
"Uh, yeah. Good guess."
Sherlock took the lead and soon had them gliding across the dance floor. He looked deeply into John's eyes and smiled. He was so in love with this boy it scared him. Sherlock found himself thinking about all the things that tried to tear them apart and they had made it through each and every one of them. Every difficulty only brought them closer and he wouldn't trade any moment for anything.
"I am happy, because I have you. You can't blame yourself for my father's actions; he would have done that with any boy. And even if he doesn't ever want to speak to me again, it's worth it because I know that you're the one person that I need in my life. I love you, Sherlock Holmes. You complete me." He smiled at the other boy, trying to show him that every word was true.
John's eyes screwed shut as he was attacked with the dessert, and he gave Sherlock an evil smirk. "That's how you want to play, then?" He pressed his plate into Sherlock's face, moving it around to make sure he was evenly covered. He peeled the plate away and let his tongue trail over his cheek. "It is pretty good."
Sherlock walked slowly to the edge of the bed and took his shirt off, tossing it aside. He smiled lovingly at John and unbuttoned his trousers, leaving them hanging from his hips as he climbed on the bed and straddled his lover, kissing him softly and starting to remove his clothing too.
... Sherlock..." This was certainly never something he would have thought could be so amazing, but it was. It
Sherlock grinned, "yes,
Sherlock moaned loudly at all the combined touches. His entire being was focused on how good his lover was making him feel and he could sense himself getting closer to the edge with each thrust. All he needed was that one extra something to push him over.
"Oh God,
, he kept repeating in his head and took controlled breaths. He tried not to show any weakness to show John that what he was doing was working.
John looked up at Sherlock confused. "Mycroft? What would Mycroft say?" He hadn't thought that Mycroft would have an issue, especially after all the events of the past few weeks. But John wasn't too worried. If Mycroft felt the need to interrogate him or even battle him to win the right to marry Sherlock, he would do it.
John was so caught up in Sherlock that he had almost forgotten that his father was there. He looked at him and then at what he was staring at, and he flushed. "Oh. Um...Sh-Sherlock gave it to me..."
"Good morning," Sherlock murmured and snuggled closer to John, "I hope you slept well." He kissed John on the temple and swiftly turned them over so he was hovering over his boyfriend, "because we have to get up now... Mum and dad are out for the day and we have the whole house to ourselves. I want to show you around," he said and smiled.
Sherlock added another finger and started stretching John out, scissoring them as he pumped in and out. He placed open mouth kisses all along his lover's throat and down across his collarbone.
"You don't have to, darling... Calm down and listen to me, okay? I need you to come talk to your father with me." Sherlock murmured soothingly and stroked the back of his fiance's head.
Sherlock's brow furrowed and he grabbed John's face in both of his hands, "Now listen here, John Watson. You did absolutely nothing wrong and it is
John nipped Sherlock's ear lobe and tugged. "You are. No one could ever pleasure me like you do." He squeezed Sherlock's cock and started moving at an erratic pace. "Fuck...I'm getting close..." he warned, trying to angle to Sherlock's sweet spot before he came.
John copied the stance and said, "I swear by God that the evidence I shall give shall be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth." He removed his hand and took his seat, waiting for Ms. Rodin to come up and question him.
John gladly kissed the full expanse of Sherlock's neck, continuing to thrust into his lover. "God, yes...You're so tight...You're so perfect..." He groaned and nipped at his skin, wanting to start a new mark. "I love...doing this for you...I love showing you my love like this."
Sherlock made quick work of John's trousers and pants, yanking them off and tossing them away. He needed more of his lover's skin available to his touch and he wanted so very badly to hear his voice crying out in lust.
Sherlock chuckled, "that's only because I have such a great student. This wouldn't be nearly as easy if you weren't so good." He smiled and continued to rotate the beaker. After a few moments, he leaned down to whisper in John's ear. "Now... there are a lot of other things I could teach you that aren't at all appropriate in a classroom setting," he said with a smirk and nipped at John's earlobe.
Sherlock groaned and grabbed onto John's hips, guiding him down onto his cock. He threw his head back, panting and trying to calm himself down. "
Sherlock squeezed John's hand, "I know... I'm sorry." He felt tears coming to his eyes, guilt pooling in his stomach. If he had told John the truth that day, none of this might have happened.
"We can talk," John suggested. He paused for a moment to think of what they might talk about. One idea popped into his head. "We're graduating this year," he said. "What are you going to do afterward?"
Sherlock felt tears come to his own eyes as he returned John's embrace. "I am so incredibly happy you found me, love. I can't imagine my life without you in it." He pulled away and kissed John on the
day, and they have not been very innocent thoughts." He smirked at the other boy before capturing his lips in a passionate kiss. After lingering long enough for them both to be breathless, he pulled back just barely and moved his head so he was speaking directly into John's ear. "Would you like to hear them?"
, John!" He groaned and rocked harder up into his lover.
Mycroft held his hands out, "none at all, little brother. Just be careful, I don't want to have to secretly drag you to the hospital again because you've gotten beaten up for your... choices." Sherlock only glared at Mycroft and headed up the stairs. Mycroft shook his head and sighed, "I hope that boy knows what he's doing," he said quietly and turned to leave.
John smiled up at Sherlock and nodded. "Yes, see you then." He gave Sherlock one last kiss, wishing that he didn't have to let go. But he forced himself to pull back, hand trailing down Sherlock's arm to give his hand a squeeze as he fully pulled away. Then he got onto his motorbike and started it, smiling at Sherlock charmingly as he zoomed out of the drive back to his own flat.
trust you, I just..." he bit his lip and looked down at the ground, "It's hard to understand sometimes, you know? That you would... love someone like me. Someone so messed up..." he felt tears coming to his eyes again and squeezed his eyes shut. "I trust you, John. I believe in you, I believe in
John kissed Sherlock back, relaxing. He was right, everything would be perfect. Besides that, they still had time before they had to face that obstacle. And it would be even easier because they would be together. "So do I. No more distance between us." He gave Sherlock another kiss, smiling.
"Because I think I just heard your bedroom door open and close," Sherlock replied quietly. He stayed still and kept his ears open for any other noises. Footsteps started making their way closer and he buried his face in John's neck. "Shit..." Sherlock breathed, not moving an inch.
John let out a soft hum and draped his arms over Sherlock's shoulders, mimicking his movements. "Natural rhythm and two left feet. You're all graceful and whatnot." He was trying very hard not to let himself get aroused when they hadn't even been dancing that long. He was not having much luck.
Sherlock chuckled breathlessly, "you mean you wouldn't have enjoyed it this much or you wouldn't have enjoyed the way we did it?" He turned his head and kissed John on the temple.
Sherlock laughed, "wouldn't that make for the talk of all of London?" he said playfully and winked at John. He finally relented and ate most of his meal, even stealing a couple of bites of John's dessert when it came. As they finished up, a slower song came on the radio and he smiled, standing and holding out his hand. "May I have this dance?" He grinned down at John, hoping he would accept.
Sherlock groaned, "
, John... That's good," Sherlock breathed. By now, he was in danger of biting a hole in his lip from how hard his teeth were clamping into it. He whimpered and his leg twitched as he endured the sweet torture.
"Then you can do the same to me," John said with a wink. He then turned back to the game and started it up. It was a classic fighting game. John picked a character and then watched Sherlock with a grin.
Ms. Rodin gave John a look, trying to let him know it was okay, they just needed to know. "All right, so then what happened?"
John leaned into the touch, smiling softly. "Please, don't stop." He wrapped his arms around Sherlock, hands landing on the small of his back. "I love you, too. I never imagined that I could be this happy."
"I'm cold too. I miss my personal space heater," John said with a smirk. "But really, we need to move in together. I hate being away from you."
John was sad that this would be his last night with Sherlock for the week, but he knew that Sherlock would certainly have something planned for that night. And he wasn't disappointed when his fiancé pulled him in once they were back in his room. He licked his lips, looking up at him with a smirk. "Anything you want, love. I'm game."
John lifted his head and locked eyes with Sherlock. "Hi...How do you feel?" he asked quietly, keeping his hands in his lap.
Sherlock chuckled, "yes... we have a home theatre. I actually spend a lot of time there. I really enjoy watching films." Once John was ready, Sherlock led him to the hall and down the stairs to the lower level. He took him through a large, padded door and turned on the lights, revealing the theatre.
Sherlock shrugged and smiled at the other man, "Dad bought this house about ten years ago, seemed a shame to waste money on a hotel." He got out of the cab and walked around to open the door for John. "After you, mon cheri," he said and grinned.
John panted, slumping backwards as he tried to collect himself. He kissed Sherlock back, able to taste himself on those lips. When Sherlock pulled away, John wrapped his arms around the other boy and held him close. "Shit, Sherlock. You are amazing."
Sherlock was silent for a moment, thinking before he spoke. "Yeah... I think so. As long as you and dad are there with me. He already knows I won't testify unless it's absolutely necessary."
Sherlock hummed in content and leaned into John's touch, "I'll have to give you a private dance later... I was thinking about it while I was on the dance floor." He closed his eyes and sighed, "I love you, John."
Helen smiled reassuringly at John and reached out to pat his hand, "you did good, John. That will be all." She motioned for Sherlock to bring his chair over to the table, which he did as fast as he could. He sat down and hugged John before turning back to Ms. Rodin, grabbing the other boy's hand and lacing their fingers together.
The usher nodded and held the bible out in front of John, placing his left hand on it and raising his right one. "Repeat after me: I swear by God that the evidence I shall give shall be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth."
Sherlock hummed around John's length as he thrust. He'd been thinking about him fucking his mouth ever since his lover mentioned it last night and he thought this was the perfect opportunity to make it happen. He inhaled deeply and relaxed his throat completely, sliding his tongue along the underside of John's cock.
John let out a sigh of relief when Sherlock seemed to realise that he was gone, but in the next moment he was pushing his way through the opposite side of the circle, and leaving John to be closed into a large crowd as the circle morphed back into a lump. "Shit. Sherlock!" He tried to push towards where he was going, but someone grabbed him and spun him around, making him lose his direction.
"That would be incredible of him." John said and blushed a little at the praise. "I don't know how great I'll be. I'm not the brightest student in the school."
John felt a bit better when he saw Sherlock smiling. At least he didn't seem too upset about John's stupidity before. He followed Ms. Rodin out of the room, immediately reaching out for Sherlock's hand as he was afraid he was in for an earful. When they got to the room, he flinched at the yell and flushed again in guilt. "I was under oath. I couldn't lie." He looked down at the floor, feeling ashamed.
," he whined and smoothed his hands down the front of John's torso.
John enjoyed all the speeches, his heart warming and happiness bubbling inside. By the time they got to dance, John had a healthy blush. He leaned in close to Sherlock, resting his head on the other man's chest. When he heard the song, however, he looked up at him smiling. "My talented husband."
He dashed out to the car park but then realized that he couldn't take Sherlock to the hospital on a bike. What could he do before the rugby players regained themselves and gave chase?
John swallowed and nodded. There was no way that they could just stop and hope that their erections went away, not after practically having clothed-sex on the dance floor. "Lead the way."
John followed Sherlock, working hard to keep up with his long strides. When they finally made it to the bathroom, John shut the door behind them and pushed Sherlock against it, trapping him. He started biting down Sherlock's neck as his hands worked Sherlock's shirt open. They slid up from his stomach, over his chest to his shoulders, where he pushed both the shirt and jacket off to the floor.
John's heart broke. He had made Sherlock cry again. Leaning forward, he kissed him softly. "I know. And it would kill me to be apart from you for so long. But I can't accept money from you, not that kind of money." He rubbed a hand over his face. "I'll just have to figure something else out."
John waited until all the boys had turned the corner, keeping a stern eye on them, before bending down next to the boy. He could see his body trembling and felt even more angry at the boys for their behaviour, but pushed it away. He needed to help this kid, whoever he was. "Hey," he said quietly, and gingerly rested his hand on the boy's shoulder. "Are you alright?" He seemed so helpless, the way he had laid there and accepted the beating. There was no way that he had done anything more than be in the wrong place at the wrong time.
. He grasped at the back of John's head, scratching his nails lightly along his scalp. He could feel himself hardening, but kept himself in check, biting his lip, not wanting to take things too far just yet.
John blushed a little and scratched the back of his neck. That was something he was going to have to get used to. He grinned as Sherlock kissed him, and gave him one back before stepping into his first class of the day.
He slowly descended back into his seat as Mr. Tabling said no further questions, and he looked over to Sherlock again, seeing his face enough to calm him some. He had done well, and he was so proud of him.
a female version of Sherlock. Because even if you look similar, and even if you're clever, Sherlock has a good heart. He would never have done something like this." Shaking his head, John sprinted inside, calling out for Sherlock to try to get him to stop.
Mycroft drove as fast as he could to the hospital and pulled the car in front of the door to the A & E. He got out and opened the door for John so he could carry Sherlock inside. "Take him in, I'm going to park the car and I'll be there to fill out the papers," he said sternly to John and got back in the car.
John didn't have time to react before Sherlock was upon him and kissing him. He kissed back with fervor, his arousal already working up just with that. A moan escaped him and he tilted his head to give Sherlock more skin. As Sherlock moved to his nipple he arched up. "Oh, Sherlock..." He could only imagine what Sherlock had in mind when he hid under the duvet, but he had an idea. And his cock twitched in anticipation.
After a while, Sherlock let his head fall back onto the pillow. He gasped for breath and let out a shaky moan. "I love you so much, John Holmes-Watson," he breathed.
"Oh yeah." John pulled out his mobile and dialed his house. After a few rings the machine picked up. "Hi da, it's me. I'm um, staying with a friend tonight. Don't worry about clothes, I'm going to borrow some. I'll see you tomorrow!" He hung up and then snuggled against Sherlock again. "There. All taken care of."
"Don't apologise, I know how they can be, trust me." Sherlock smiled reassuringly at John, "is there anything I can do to help?" he asked and brushed a few stray hairs away from his boyfriend's face.
John tangled his fingers in Sherlock's hair, pushing him lower, getting him closer. There was always too much space between them.
"Those boys had better be expelled for this," Mr. Watson said, tone fierce. "They shouldn't be allowed to terrorize students this way."
They ran up the stairs and one of the police tried to pull John away from Sherlock. He screamed and struggled, trying to get back to his boyfriend, to the other half of his very
Sherlock lifted his head and removed one of his arms to start stroking John's forehead as he spoke. "Well, Dad said Ms. Rodin should be here around three this afternoon. I still wanted to show you the rest of the house, did you bring your swimming trunks like I told you to?"
John had a healthy blush plastered to his face as Sherlock continually called him his fiance to all of the guests that they spoke to. He tried to be as polite as possible, wanting to impress them and show that he wasn't just some common boy. So far, it seemed like no one really noticed. He gladly took the chair Sherlock pulled for him and slid into the table. As soon as Sherlock had sat down, he grabbed his hand again and laced their fingers.
John smiled as he left the dining hall with Sherlock, but it dropped from his face as they met Sherlock's brother in the doorway. He could only stare up at the older boy, swallowing thickly as his gaze traveled over him. It was like Mycroft had x-ray vision, he felt so vulnerable. When Mycroft finally passed by, John let out a breath he hadn't realised he was holding. Sherlock's embrace a moment later helped to calm him down. He looked up at the taller boy and turned pink at the suggestion of kissing like they had before. "Sounds good to me." With a grin, he hooked arms with Sherlock as they went back up the stairs to his room.
John felt Sherlock coming apart beneath him and it brought him that much closer to finishing. But what really set him over the edge was Sherlock speaking in that low tone right in his ear. He bucked hard into Sherlock's hand, crying out loudly. "Oh, fuck, Sherlock!" With one more thrust he cried out and came, riding through the most powerful orgasm he'd ever had.
John grinned at this new style of dancing and he buried his face in the back of Sherlock's neck, kissing him there as they continued to grind. He wondered distantly what everyone else must be thinking, seeing two boys dance so intimately. After all, just because Sherlock's family accepted it, didn't mean all his guests did. Then again, John couldn't be bothered to care. He was enjoying himself with the boy he loved.
"Well... the defence is trying to get the judge to change the charges," she said and sighed. Sherlock shook his head, "to what?" She sat down and looked at the ground, "they want them to drop the attempted murder charge completely."
John followed Sherlock inside and up to his room, then through to the adjoining bathroom. He slipped out of his trunks and stepped into the shower with Sherlock.
When Sherlock felt that his lover was stretched enough, he spit into his hand and slicked up his cock. He decided to tease John a little and just rubbed his erection in between the other boy's arse cheeks.
John was busily sucking a mark onto Sherlock when he felt the grip on his backside. He jumped and pulled away to look up at his boyfriend. "You little brat." He sat up and rolled off of Sherlock, poking his tongue out at him.
John took the clothes and smirked a little. "Be right back." He went over to the mirrors and found the changing room, a small space with a chair and some hooks to hang clothes on. He slipped into the outfit Sherlock gave him, making sure to leave the top few buttons open on the shirt, and then stepped out. Leaning against the edge of a mirror with his arms crossed, he gave Sherlock a sly grin. "Well?"
Mr. Tabling nodded, "that's certainly true. I have another question for you." Sherlock clasped his hands together and waited. "Have you ever done any recreational drugs?" Sherlock cleared his throat and nodded, "yes... I have." The defence lawyer stood and walked towards the stand, "so, it's entirely possible... that you may have been hallucinating when this so called 'attack' happened. In fact, it may not have ever happened at all... there are no witnesses. Are we just supposed to take the word of a druggie?"
John moaned and tightened his legs around Sherlock, his arms around the other boy's neck. He liked Sherlock getting rough with him and he moaned again more loudly as the other boy's hips found his. Laying back with his arms splayed, John arched into Sherlock's mouth as it set fire to his skin. He was glad his injuries had all healed. He wanted full enjoyment out of this.
John just couldn't hold back anymore and his hips bucked once hard into Sherlock's hand. He immediately opened his eyes to see if anyone had been watching, but everyone in the nearby seats was distracted by one thing or another. He dared to let himself do it again, and again, keeping a close eye for any passengers turning their heads. Finally, with a soft cry of his lover's name, he was spilling out his release, eyes squeezed shut once more in pure pleasure.
Sherlock brought a hand up and stroked John's hair, kissing him on the forehead. "You always make me feel special," he murmured and hugged the other boy tighter.
Sherlock nodded, "yeah, I um... just had a little trouble sleeping last night," he said and yawned. He looked over John, "looks like you did too, yeah?" He said and kissed his fiancé on the forehead.
Sherlock watched as John walked over to the witness stand and kept his gaze on him as he stood in the witness box. The usher walked up to John with a bible in his hand, "do you wish to take an oath or make an affirmation that your evidence is true?" he asked.
Ms. Rodin nodded for Sherlock to continue. "One day, after gym..." he looked over at John and swallowed thickly, keeping eye contact with him as he spoke. "Moran approached me in the showers. He had a few of the other rugby players with him." Sherlock closed his eyes for a moment, calming himself before he continued on with the story.
Sherloc snapped his hips up faster and smacked his lover's arse again. He groaned and could feel his legs shaking as he continued to pound up into him. "Ohhh,
"Mmm..." John paused for a moment, thinking about the party about the fact that people would be drinking. "Sherlock," he said looking up. "I never did get a chance to tell you about my sister." He wanted Sherlock to know, especially after yesterday.
"Now, John... I can't have you going to prison for assault. How would I live without you for that long?" Sherlock said firmly. "I know it will be hard, trust me... but you'll have to try and contain yourself."
Sherlock blushed as John kissed his cheek and took the gift from his fiancé. "John... I told you not to make a fuss," he murmured and smiled down at him. He led the other boy down the stairs and to the limo where the driver was waiting to open the door for them.
John gasped, clutching at Sherlock. "Oh...oh God..." He rocked forward into his fiance's hand. "Are you sure...this is a good idea?"
It was nice to finally be back in Sherlock's room, in his bed where they could have some peace away from the atmosphere of the hospital. He could finally relax and stop worrying that something else was going to happen. Sherlock being home meant that he was all right, and he was going to stay that way. John took both of Sherlock's hands, slipping his fingers through the other boy's, wanting to feel as connected as possible.
John shook his head, hating to think about it. He brought one of his hands up to Sherlock's chest and put it over his beating heart, needing to feel the pumping muscle. "I was so scared..." he said softly. "When they carried you out, I really thought I had lost you. I'm grateful everyday to even hear you breathe."
John swallowed and nodded, squeezing Mary's hand before he had to let go for the doors to be closed. She really was a nice girl. If Sherlock had never come into his life, he might have found himself with her instead. He kept Sherlock's hand as they rode to the hospital, focusing on the steady beat of his heart under the tip of his finger. With his free hand he called Mr. and Mrs. Holmes, letting them know what was going on.
John's cheeks only became more red and he felt terribly guilty. He barely remembered saying these things, especially because any of his previous feelings about homosexuality had changed now that he was with Sherlock. "I was being stupid," he said softly, but then his voice picked up volume. "But I obviously didn't do that since a gay person did hit on me, and now we're engaged." He held up his left hand to show his ring.
John looked up at him, eyes still a little watery. "You know that I wouldn't unless I absolutely had to," he said softly. "I never want to be away from you." He reached over for one of Sherlock's hands, twining their fingers together.
Sherlock wrapped his arms around John, "Mmm... Yes, I'm gaining weight too. Soon you won't be able to put your arms around me." He kissed the top of the other boy's head.
Ms. Rodin looked up and nodded, "well, yeah... that would certainly help."
"Sherlock, listen, please," he said right in his ear. "It's John. It's just me and no one else. You're safe, you're here with me. I love you." He tried to hug him, afraid that Sherlock would shake him off again.
Sherlock pulled away after a while and leaned in to whisper huskily in John's ear. "Je t'aime tellement, mon merveilleux mari." He started kissing along his husband's jaw and down his neck. "Tu es si merveilleux..." he placed an open mouthed kiss on the other man's Adam's apple, "tellement incroyable..."
Sherlock smiled reassuringly at John, knowing he concerned he was about what Mycroft thought. He seemed impassive however and didn't make any comments about his boyfriend's living conditions, for which Sherlock was very grateful. He helped John out of the car and up the stairs, keeping a hand at the small of his back as he unlocked the door.
Sherlock just continued to look forward with a straight face as his hand continued to move. He reached over and lightly grasped John's crotch through his trousers, sliding his hand up and down it.
think we should ring someone."
John returned the kiss happily. "You're very welcome. Now smile for me, I don't like it when you cry." He caressed Sherlock's cheek, thumb running over his prominent cheekbone.
bastard!" he screamed. The only thing stopping him from running over was the guard next to Sebastian who had stepped in his way. "You'll get yours...You'll get exactly what you deserve!" He couldn't stand anymore, slumping down into a seat and crying.
John cried out again and again as he felt himself spill over the edge. He kissed Sherlock fiercely as he came, hips moving sporadically against Sherlock's as he rode through the pleasure. He finally broke away, panting as he fell backwards into the bed, trying to regain his senses.
Sherlock smiled and ran the backs of his fingers across John's cheek, "you're quite welcome, my love. Anytime you need me, I'm here." He leaned in to capture the other boy's lips in a sweet kiss before pulling back and resting their foreheads together. "Now we have to figure out what to wear..." he said and grinned.
Sherlock just laughed and carried John up the stairs, grinning the whole way there. He pushed his bedroom door open with his foot and shut it behind them. He plopped his fiancé down on the bed and straddled his hips.
John was getting close as well, the feeling of being this way with Sherlock was so overwhelming. Even just Sherlock's words were enough to make him groan and choke out, "Yes,
"Good night, my beautiful John. I love you more than anything," Sherlock said and placed another kiss on the mobile. "I will see you in the morning."
Sherlock looked back down at John, "Come on, we'll be late for our first class," he said and twined their fingers together as he led them inside.
have in mind?" He took his index finger and slid it down the front of John's torso, stopping at his hipbone.
Sherlock cleared his throat, "Um... Mr. Watson? May I speak with you for a moment?" He took the envelope out of his pocket and held it in both of his hands.
Sherlock hummed and gave John a quick peck on the lips. "I'm really curious... What was your first impression of me?" He asked and ran his fingers through the other boy's hair.
"Me?" John couldn't help it, he got angry. Did Sherlock really have so little faith in him to think that he would betray him that way? He let go of him and stood. "You honestly think that after everything we've been through that I would blow it all by doing something stupid like that? In case you didn't notice, that girl is insane!
Sherlock felt a little better at the touch to his knee and relaxed, starting to eat. When John's father spoke again, he looked up at him and shook his head. "You don't owe me anything. I just did what I had to in order to protect John and yourself. It was honestly the least I could do since I'm the reason he got attacked in the first place." He gave a sad smile and squeezed his lover's hand under the table.
The two boys stood by the exit door and said their goodbyes and thank you's to everyone as they left and his mother came over to give them one last hug and kiss before sending them off to go back to the house. Sherlock led John towards the limo, arm in arm, just as they had arrived.
Sherlock scooped John up in his arms and carried him over to the bed, laying him down gently. He straddled his lover's hips and took his own shirt off. Then he leaned down and started placing kisses on his fiancé's torso again.
Sherlock groaned, everything seeming to crash down on him all at once. He held on as long as he could until he came with a gasp, his whole body jerking with the force of his orgasm. He leaned in to whisper in John's ear, "finish for me, love... that's it... just let go, let me feel you... let me hear you."
Sherlock groaned and hitched one of John's legs up, wrapping it around his waist. He pressed his lover against the mirror and kissed all along his throat, moving up the other side and nipping his earlobe.
Sherlock nodded and squirted some lube out onto his fingers, then placed the bottle to the side. He grabbed hold of John's knee with his clean hand and pressed one of his slick digits against his lover's entrance, massaging the muscle until it gave way and he could finally slide his finger inside.
"Unngh, oh fuck... C-close, John," Sherlock breathed. He bucked his hips up once and moaned softly. He was so close, just needing that little bit more to push him over.
Sherlock closed his eyes, a few tears falling and he sighed raggedly. "I'm so sorry for not telling you," he whispered.
"Well, it all started when I became public about my sexuality. Moran always hated homosexuals and he started teasing me, calling me names like faggot and queer."
Sherlock leaned his head back and closed his eyes, "at one point mum wanted to have a bed and breakfast, but dad doesn't like the idea of having complete strangers in the house." He scooted closer to John and put his arm on the back of the bench behind the other boy.
He squeezed Sherlock's hands, breaking the kiss to drop his head down and start sucking on his pale skin again, to finish the mark that he had started.
"Sherlock Holmes," Sherlock said, following John down the hall. He easily fell into step with the shorter boy, their arms brushing occasionally as they walked. "Your name is John... Watson, right?" he asked, his head tilting a little. He still felt nervous, not knowing how observant John was and trying to keep his thoughts in check, though he still maintained steady eye contact with him.
Sherlock frowned, the word 'overdose' bringing back memories of his past habits, but he tried his best to push them away. He didn't do that anymore and he needed to move on. He squirmed, but otherwise stayed still. Sighing, he closed his eyes tightly and tried to focus again on John's mouth.
The room was filled with murmurs as an officer brought in Moran. He was handcuffed and wearing a prison outfit, head down as he walked. When he was seated, he looked over at Sherlock and John with an evil grin and winked at them.
John smiled a little. "Well, yes, that is true. And I certainly had never had anything up my arse before you." He put a hand over his heart, feigning shock. "Oh, Mr. Holmes. You stole my virginity!"
Sherlock laughed, "yes I do." He kissed John again and winked, "and none of them are innocent." He pulled John close to him and sighed happily, "I love you, John."
Sherlock waited until John was finished cleaning his hand and then he pulled him closer by the back of his head, locking their lips together. He hummed into the kiss as their tongues slid together. When he pulled back he had a smile on his face. "I never expected to enjoy that taste, but I really do."
John stayed in the hospital as much as he could, but his father wanted him to go to school, so he did grudgingly. All of his free time was spent with Sherlock, making sure that he was comfortable until they would let him go home. He of course was completely on board for going home with Sherlock over the weekend and his father relented, just reminding him to take it easy on the boy. But John had no intentions of doing anything with Sherlock, not until he was ready. Even then, he would be careful with him.
John felt guilty for having said that in the first place, and now he felt even worse for having made Sherlock cry. "No, Sherlock. I didn't say that because I don't want to tell him. I really do. It's just..." He sighed and rubbed a hand over his face. "Sometimes my father gets angry with our whole situation. And sometimes he takes it out on Harry for being a lesbian and making Mum leave. I'm just a little afraid of how he's going to react when his second child turns out not to be straight. It's not you." John smoothed back Sherlock's hair and kissed his forehead. "You're perfect. Any person, boy or girl, would be lucky to take you home to their parents."
talk about it. I just had a little...
Sherlock laughed, "oh don't worry, love... I plan to do just that once we revive ourselves." He wiped himself off and pulled his pants and trousers back up, fastening them. Then he crawled over to John and kissed him softly on the lips as he wiped away the cum dripping from his used entrance. "We'll have to at least get semi-decent. It just occurred to me they still haven't brought out my cake yet." He grinned, "oh... and I haven't opened your present to me either."
Sherlock kissed John's fingers, reaching up to take his hand in his own. "I have a few things for us to use... In the small red satchel by the door. Go get it, please," he murmured.
John let Sherlock carry him, glad to be on the bed because he didn't know how much longer he could last without getting weak in the knees. He arched up towards Sherlock's lips, moaning out his name as he hit a spot that sent electric shocks downwards.
"So... After you stopped Sebastian from attacking Sherlock on Friday... It didn't occur to you that he may try again? You just... left Sherlock there, unprotected." She was being relentless now and Sherlock gripped tighter to John's hand.
John groaned just from the way Sherlock was looking at him, and he pulled out his fingers. He reached for the lube again, slicking his cock, moving to position himself. He pushed in and groaned again, bending to kiss him hungrily.
John could tell Sherlock was getting desperate and he smirked, finally moving his mouth to his throbbing cock. He took just the head into his mouth, sucking lightly. He knew it would drive Sherlock crazy, but he wanted to see how long Sherlock could last like this.
..." he groaned against the other boy's lips before capturing them in another heated kiss.
John sat up on the edge of the bed when Sherlock got up and his mouth watered as dessert was brought in. "Don't mind if I do." He got up and grabbed a bowl, thanking the butler before taking a bite. The brownie was warm and gooey and the cold of the ice cream juxtaposed with the warmth was perfect in his mouth. "Oh God...Do you always eat like this?" he asked Sherlock.
John swallowed, because the idea was incredibly arousing, but he couldn't be late for school. He grabbed the shampoo while Sherlock rinsed and lathered his own hair. "Don't worry. Next time I sleep over, I promise we'll do whatever you like." He smirked a little and reached out to grope Sherlock's arse for just a split second before going back to washing his hair innocetly.
Sherlock blushed, "really? Well... I have to say that I think you are quite fantastic yourself, I've never felt so... pleasured before." He hugged John tightly to him and sighed happily. "Mmm... I think I will have no trouble sleeping all night after that," he said and chuckled.
John jumped when Moran's fist whizzed past him and hit the boy in the face. He knelt down next to him as he fell.
!" With one last hit on his sweet spot, John was coming, spilling out all over his hand and the sheets beneath him.
"John..." Sherlock said softly, his heart breaking at John's defeated tone of voice. He wanted nothing more than to erase his fears of rejection, knowing how it could feel. He pulled John close to him and hugged him, unable to think of anything else to do. "I don't care," he said firmly and released him, grabbing his face and turning his head to force him to look him in the eyes, "you are the first person to even want to spend time with me. All the others mock and tease me, beat me up and send me to the hospital with several broken bones and a concussion... You were the first to show any kindness towards me and I am grateful for that. How much money you have doesn't matter to me in the least. Please don't worry about that." He spoke softly, but determinedly, trying to convince John that there was nothing that would make him ask him to leave. He'd only known John for a short time, but he already felt such a connection to him that he knew he would always want him in his life, no matter what.
He pulled away just far enough to breathe, panting out against his lover's lips as he thrust in and out. The love and tenderness in this particular bout of lovemaking brought tears to Sherlock's eyes and he whimpered every so often as John's cock hit his prostate.
, I love you so much." He moaned loudly and threw his head back, pounding into his lover and gripping his hips so hard he was sure to leave marks.
Sherlock leaned up to press a kiss on the back of John's neck, "you are so amazing, I love you so much," he whispered and slipped a second finger inside of his lover. He began scissoring them as he nipped at the other boy's earlobe, breathing heavily against it.
John added a second finger, scissoring to stretch, and then added a third. He thrust them a few times, making Sherlock was well prepared before pulling out. He took the lube and slathered his cock with it, moving to hover over Sherlock. He pushed in slowly, enjoying the tight heat of his lover.
John parked his bike outside and went up the stairs into the flat. "Da?" Mr. Watson was sitting in the living room, on the couch with his face in his hands. He looked up and sighed. "Come here, lad."
He took a deep breath and began. "Harry came out to our parents when she was seventeen. You know what happened then. Mum picked up and left, and the divorce was final within a few months. Da was really upset because he loved Mum a lot, but he loved Harry too, and wanted to support her. I was upset too, but I was seven so I didn't even fully understand. Harry didn't seem that bothered. At first."
He turned Sherlock's face to look him in the eyes. "I love
John shuddered and turned to catch Sherlock's lips in a firm kiss before turning the bike on. "Don't distract me while I'm driving, darling," he said and winked at him. Facing forward, he pulled away from the curb and drove off.
"John..." Sherlock whispered and bit his lip as he kept moving, "I wouldn't be nearly as great without you. I... I probably wouldn't even-
Sherlock smiled and blushed as John introduced himself.
"Mmm... does it matter?" Sherlock whispered and pressed his lips against John's, keeping the kisses soft and slow. He stroked his fingers across his boyfriend's side, being as gentle as possible. Sherlock knew how sore John probably was, having gone through the same pain himself a couple days before.
Sherlock grabbed John's hand as they went down the stairs towards his motorbike. "So... your father knows we're already having sex?" He said, eyes twinkling as he tried not to laugh.
After lunch, the rest of their classes went by fairly easy. When the last bell rang, Sherlock held tightly to John, loathe to let him go home after his nightmares the evening before. "Could I... maybe spend the night with you tonight? After today I just... I don't know if I could sleep alone," he said quietly and stroked his thumbs along his fiance's back.
Sherlock smiled and pulled John closer until they were flush against each other, "Mmm... only because you make me that way. You bring out the best in me, love," he murmured and kissed John softly again.
Sherlock smiled up at John with tears in his own eyes and pulled him in for another kiss. "And you're mine," he whispered and kissed him again. He grabbed John by the waist and pulled him down on top of him so he was straddling his hips. He kept their lips connected, swiping his tongue along the other boy's bottom lip.
The defence lawyer relented and decided to pursue another angle. "In the short time you'd known my client, you had a few opportunities to have some conversations with him... Is it not true that at one point, you said that gay males 'freaked you out'?" He again glanced over to the rugby players, silently pointing out that he again had witnesses to the fact.
Sherlock hummed in content and kissed his boyfriend lazily. "I'm head over heels for you too, love," he murmured and chuckled. "No matter what, I'm always going to love you. I want you to know that," he whispered, wrapping his arms around him and stroking John's back.
John sighed and laid back as he waited for Sherlock to return. His hand was still covered in his own cum and there was some on his stomach as well. He was glad Sherlock was at least able to get up because he was certainly not moving for a good twelve hours at least.
wouldn't appreciate that in public.
Sherlock gave the cabbie the address of the house that they would be staying in, speaking perfect French. John didn't know they wouldn't be staying in a hotel and he smiled mischievously over at his husband as they drove off.
He paused and looked down at his feet, "he loves you and I know he cares what you think about us being together. I hope... I hope you can accept him, because I love him and I wouldn't want to see him hurt by not having his father's support."
! Ohhh God, again... More,
John's breath hitched and then he was crying out as he felt both Sherlock coming against him and his fingers inside. He too orgasmed, pleasure rushing through him as their cum mixed together between them. Body still shaking, John slumped forward, pushing Sherlock back until he was against the wall and stayed there, trying to catch his breath.
John smoothed his hands over Sherlock's back, trying to keep him calm. "It's alright, love. I'm sure if at least one of us testifies that will be more than enough to get him a sentence." He moved closer to kiss Sherlock tenderly. Sherlock had already told him that the memories of Sebastian's earlier bullying had been enough to put him on drugs. John didn't want Sherlock to force himself to think about those times again and possibly have a relapse.
John shook his head again, panicking. "It's fine, I've done this before," he said to Mary voice a higher pitch than a moment before. "Sherlock, wake
"Never enough time, John...quickly! We have to get to Paris so we can spend some...
right. You do look dashing without a shirt."
Sherlock smiled and lifted John's shirt up, taking it off slowly and gently so he wouldn't risk hurting him. He tossed it away and slid his hands down his boyfriend's sides, settling them on either side of his waist. Slowly, he leaned towards John's torso and let his lips ghost over every bruise and cut, breathing out softly and looking up at John for any signs of discomfort.
Sherlock nodded and frowned. "About the attacks... From before I met you." He held John tighter and rested his cheek on the top of his head. "It was awful..." he whispered and shivered.
"That sounds nice... Mycroft never played with me," Sherlock murmured and kissed John's cheek again. "So what happened after that? I know that's not all to the story..." he tilted his head until his cheek was now resting on John's shoulder and raised an eyebrow at him.
John spent his Sunday doing chores around the flat and laughing at the various texts that Sherlock sent him about the guests at the brunch. He couldn't help the feeling of inferiority setting in again. Sherlock was at the same table with the PM, and John wasn't going to even have dinner tonight. He sighed as he vacuumed the flat, his last chore for the day.
When they got to the hospital, the nurse took Sherlock away for them to run a few tests before they got him settled in a room. Sherlock's parents were out of the country for a long weekend, so Mycroft was going to be there at the hospital as soon as he could. John was led back to Sherlock's room a couple hours later, where he was sleeping. The doctor had given him a sedative after all the shock his brain had gone through.
Sherlock smiled at everyone who greeted them, only knowing about half of the people they talked to. He led John over to the table at the head of the dining area and pulled the chair out for him, sitting down after he did. He grabbed John's hand, twining their fingers together and bringing the back of his husband's hand to his lips to kiss it.
Sherlock's mother looked at her husband and laughed, "my! It's about time you told us!" Before Sherlock could say anything, his father raised his hand, "honestly, Sherlock, you underestimate us. It's kind of hard not to notice the ring John's wearing." He nodded towards the boy's left hand.
Sherlock laughed at the figures on top of the cake, shoving John's down just a little further, claiming he did it to make it more 'anatomically correct'. He smirked at his new husband and they grabbed the cake knife, cutting the cake together as the photographer snapped about a million photos.
John smiled and buried his face in Sherlock's neck. "I do know that. And I feel the same. I'll always be here with you." He closed his eyes, breathing steady and matched with Sherlock's rhythm. This moment was so perfect, nothing could ruin it. Not his father, not the kids at school. It was just him and Sherlock and perfect bliss.
Sherlock scoffed, "typical doctors. I'm a little thirsty," he said, looking around to see if there was any water nearby. "John? Could you get me a glass of water, please, love?" he said and pointed over to the cup on the food tray next to the pitcher.
Sherlock moaned against his lover's lips and took one arse cheek in each hand, pulling him into a steady rocking rhythm. "
Sherlock sat up, pulling John with him and settling the other boy between his legs so that his back was pressed to Sherlock's chest. He wrapped his arms around his fiancé and settled his head on his shoulder. "Okay... Now I'm ready," he kissed John's cheek, "tell me."
Then John looked back to Sherlock and he smiled, tears welling again in his eyes. He turned into him and wrapped his arms around his fiance. "I love you. I love you, so much."
"Yes, but I wanted to get settled in with our blanket since you get so
As soon as John's lips met Sherlock's again, he kissed him desperately, channeling all his feelings into it. He let out a soft whimper and rocked his hips back onto his lover's fingers.
, that feels good," he mumbled and tightened his thighs around John's head.
Sherlock would like to say he wasn't scared, but he was terrified. Sebastian chuckled, "well, well... It's my favorite freak. Where's your boyfriend, hmm?" the other players laughed.
John chuckled just a little, giving Sherlock a loving kiss before sitting up so he could reach the table. He opened the drawer and found the box and bottle he was looking for. Pulling one condom out, he put the box back.
"It is imperative that no one mention the episode, so anyone you know who may have seen him and will have contact with him later... you need to let them know. For all he knows, he passed out on the dance floor and you called an ambulance," Mycroft whispered.
John let out a whimper, trying so hard not to be completely turned on by what his fiance was saying. He swallowed again, with more difficulty this time. "Sherlock..." But in another moment he had went back to what he was doing, leaving John in a half-aroused daze. He shook his head and rinsed himself completely before joining Sherlock outside of the shower to dry off.
"No," John said, shaking his head. "Neither of us touched him, or moved. I pushed Sherlock behind me and that was it." That much at least would prove that Sebastian was the one who struck first.
Sherlock frowned, "why are you here? Did Mary decide she was done with you?" he said, bitterness creeping into his voice and tears beginning to fall down his cheeks. He looked away, not wanting to look into John's eyes as he rejected him.
John made a soft sound as Sherlock moved to straddle him. For someone who had recently been beaten by a team of burly teenagers, he was in good shape. He wrapped his arms around Sherlock's neck, holding him close even as they both gasped for air. He looked up into Sherlock's face and he could read it, the desire. He could also feel it poking against his own. Were they ready for this? They did love each other. It wasn't meaningless...
Sherlock sighed in relief, "Good... that's good." He pulled John closer to him so their fronts were pressed together. "I love you, John. I'm so glad that you're safe."
John's eyes were also glistening with tears and he swallowed the lump in his throat to try to make himself more able to speak. He took a deep breath and concentrated on Sherlock and Sherlock alone.
Sherlock smiled, oh if only he knew his plans... "I have some ideas... probably going to uni for forensics, I've always been fascinated by solving crimes," he said and shrugged. "What about you?"
John felt his heart warm at the sight of his fiance, snug in his arms and so adorable. He laughed a little and held more tightly to Sherlock. "This isn't the first time I've carried you. Though the situation wasn't very romantic." He stepped into Sherlock's room and laid him down on the bed, climbing in with him.
- be here if it weren't for you." He let out a loud moan and kissed his lover's shoulder softly.
"I'm the lucky one," Sherlock said and stroked the back of John's head, placing a kiss to the top of it before pulling away and laying down on the bed. "Finish getting dressed and we'll lay here for a while and talk before we sleep. I want to try and spend as much time as I can with you tomorrow." He pulled the covers down and settled under them, waiting for John to join him.
Sherlock chuckled and looked at John, "took them long enough to realise it, yeah?" He said and winked at his fiancé, leaning down to peck him on the cheek. He walked John to his first class and walked away towards his own.
Sherlock moaned, "John... Get the rest of these clothes out of the way as soon as possible before I rip them off of us." He tightened his grip on John's back. His self control was very thin and he didn't want to ruin such lovely suits in his enthusiasm.
Sherlock chuckled and kissed his lover's nose, "hence why we're the most attractive couple at school." He grinned and wrapped his arms tightly around John, pulling him into a hug. "I can't believe how lucky I am. You're the most kind, handsome, perfect person I have ever met. Every day I thank whoever's out there watching over us that you were brought to me." He pulled back and cupped his fiance's cheek again, "It blows my mind that someone like you could ever love me as much as I love you."
John flushed in embarrassment when Sherlock had begun, but as he continued the redness slowly faded and a smile grew in its place. He kissed Sherlock back, chest swelling in happiness. "I couldn't have said it better myself," he whispered against Sherlock's lips. "I just wish there was a way to express exactly how strongly I feel for you."
John arched into Sherlock, eyes darkened with lust as he bucked up to get more of him. "Yes...please fuck me, Sherlock. Make me yours." He laid back and pulled Sherlock on top of him, groping his backside as he ground up into his lover. "I want to feel you filling me up, using me to make you feel good. Please..."
Sherlock removed his fingers once the were wet enough and brought his hand back behind his lover, pushing one inside his entrance. "I love the way you feel inside, so hot and tight..." he whispered huskily against John's lips. "You like having my cock in you, don't you? Tell me... tell me how much you want it."
John swallowed and nodded, melting under Sherlock's gaze. He knew he could, it would just take a little longer. And why not enjoy it for as long as possible. He still felt close, however, now that he had touched himself a little, and he slowed just enough to calm down again.
John groaned around Sherlock, swallowing to add to the effect. His finger pumped and twisted inside of Sherlock, reaching his prostate and stroking it.
He looked down at his crying mess of a fiance and just wanted to hold him and apologise and make everything better, but he couldn't let this go. "Sherlock... if you can't trust me, this isn't going to work. You have to believe in me. Like I believe in you."
John gasped and then cried out as Sherlock was suddenly on top of him. "Ohh, fuck. Yes!" He started sucking right on Sherlock's pulse, enjoying the speeding beats that he knew were because of him.
Sherlock walked them through the door and released John's arm. He sauntered slowly and deliberately over to the bed and laid down, spreading himself out and smiling over at John. He patted the bed next to him, "care to join?" he said huskily.
"I love you, too, Sherlock." John tucked Sherlock back into his trousers before closing his eyes and letting himself drift off. A few hours later, an announcement was made for the landing in Paris. John woke first and nudged his husband. "We're here, love."
"Hey," Sherlock said softly and tilted John's head up, "no one is ever going to take you away from me, okay? I won't let it happen. I told you I promised to be here for you and I intend to keep that promise. I will fight for you, no matter who tries to tear us apart." He smiled lovingly at his boyfriend and kissed him on the forehead.
John swallowed.
"I see..." Helen took out a notebook from her briefcase and scribbled notes in it while John talked. "And did he say why they had ganged up on Sherlock?"
John rode to school alone on his bike, already wishing the school day was over. At least there were only a few days til the weekend, and he could spend the whole two days with Sherlock. Though he did sort of hope his father would call soon. It wasn't that he didn't like living with Sherlock, it was fabulous. But he wanted to make amends, and he really wanted his father to get to know the boy he loved.
John waited, wanting to make sure Sherlock was alright first before he moved. He returned the kiss, gently starting to thrust as he did so. "I love you, too," he whispered against Sherlock's lips and kissed him again.
All Sherlock could manage was a groan as he let his arms drop to the bed when John untied them. He was still shaking slightly from the exertion and his heart was pounding in his ears. His eyes opened and he smiled over at his lover, lifting his arm to pull him into a kiss.
"Then what happened?" Helen asked and continued to pace. Sherlock was wringing his hands together and kept eye contact with John, trying to offer any comfort he could with his look.
"Finally completely connected," Sherlock whispered, bringing up his hand with the ring on it and brushing a few stray hairs from John's forehead. He beamed at his husband and leaned down to connect their lips in a long, sweet kiss. He closed his eyes into it, focusing on nothing but the feel of his husband's lips beneath his.
... John! You're so good... s-so incredible." Sherlock groaned and arched his back into his lover, starting to rock his own hips to meet his husband's thrusts.
, he cursed himself and walked with John to his car. He shot a quick text to his brother Mycroft to let him know he was bringing a friend home for dinner and to try not to run him off with his bluntness. As they approached the lot, Sherlock spoke again, side by side with John, "So, what brought you to London?" he asked, wanting to learn as much as he could about the other boy.
John got shivers down his spine and flushed again as Sherlock's lips found his neck. He brought his hands back up, bringing them up to Sherlock's hair and threading through his curls. He gently massaged his fiance's scalp, knowing that it would feel good in his sensitive skin.
Sherlock squeezed John's hand and smiled, "Good." He led them down to the dining hall where breakfast was waiting. His mother and father were sitting at the table eating. "Good morning, boys! I trust you slept well?" Mrs. Holmes greeted them and smiled.
"Well it's not like I saw Moran and then left. I had no idea that he and Mary even talked," John said, feeling a bit defensive, and more guilty. He had been stupid to leave Sherlock like that.
Sherlock gasped when he felt John's wet fingers on his arse and he bit his lip against a groan.
John stood face to face with Sherlock, moving up a few steps so they were at eye level. "Hey," he said with a grin. He had thought that Sherlock would have swept him up and kissed him by now. But then he noticed the slight tenseness to his posture and he rolled his eyes fondly. "Come here, you." He pulled Sherlock into his arms and kissed him hard. He couldn't do this at home but he didn't give a damn what the people thought at school.
John kept up with Sherlock, his cock aching painfully between his legs as they went out to the limo. Once they were finally inside he closed the door behind him and pounced on Sherlock, pushing him onto his back on the seat and kissing him firmly. Then he pulled back and looked down at his lover with lust-darkened eyes. "I promised you whatever you want. Any requests?"
Sherlock leaned into the touch to his cheek and swallowed thickly before speaking. "Do you remember when I told you I could erase my memories? That sometimes... just locking them away didn't work?" He looked deep into his boyfriend's eyes as he spoke, trying to assess his reaction.
John had to force himself not to jump when Sherlock grabbed him, and just continued, red-faced, until he found his seat. He sat near the window, and it was a good thing too, because not even a moment after the plane was in the air, a long-fingered hand was traveling up his leg. "Sherlock..." He looked over at him, his cheeks still on fire.
Sherlock grinned and handed the envelope to Mr. Watson, "You'll find in that envelope your last two weeks pay, along with a notice of your advancement. You start your new position tomorrow."
! His head fell back with a moan and he bucked up into Sherlock's mouth. For someone inexperienced he was incredible at this.
He pulled away and stripped off his lover's shirt, tossing it away before working on the buttons of his own. Once he shrugged it off, he leaned back in to press their lips together and rocked his hips forward once. "I've also been thinking about how wonderful it felt to have my fingers inside of you the other day. How tight and hot you were. I couldn't help but let my mind wander to how amazing you would feel around my cock."
John grinned back, feeling better, "good." He kissed him again, slower this time, but with the same feeling. Sherlock was so precious to him, he hated to think of how many things might have prevented them from meeting. He wrapped his arms around his lover's neck to hold him close, wanting him to know that nothing could ever make John change his mind about those three little words.
! Please!" He felt tears welling in his eyes as he watched his fiance stare blankly past them. He could hardly even see him breathing, his blinking becoming slower and slower, and for a moment, John was afraid he...No, no, no, this couldn't be happening. "Sherlock, I'm begging you! Don't do this to me!
Sherlock gasped and bucked his hips up at the bite and hummed in content when his lover laved his tongue over it. When John licked at his arsehole again, he moaned and tried to push his hips down onto his face.
Sherlock let the corners of his mouth quirk into a smile briefly before going serious again. He gripped John a little tighter, still staying outside of his trousers. He'd been John's lover for about seven years now and knew every little way to touch him to get him aroused.
"I love you, too, Sherlock," he said, voice deep but quiet. He slowly thrust into Sherlock, not wanting to go too hard as he knew it would probably hurt being this was the first time.
John immediately snuggled back into Sherlock's arms when he returned and smiled up at him. "That would be very nice. I feel like you already have some ideas in mind," he teased, poking Sherlock in the nose. He tucked his head under Sherlock's chin and closed his eyes. He was so happy with him.
John took a wary sip and then made a face. He didn't know why Harry had liked alcohol so much, it was rough to get down. He took another sip just to be polite, glad that they pulled up on to the curb a moment later. He sighed and nodded a little, smiling back at Sherlock. "Yes. I'm ready."
good thing." He smiled and kissed his boyfriend's neck, too tired to move and kiss his lips.
Sherlock lead them through the foyer to the side dining room. It was smaller than the dining hall where they had dinner the other night and was reserved for more intimate dinners like this one. He pulled out a chair for John, "Mother and father will be joining us any moment," he said and took his seat next to his boyfriend.
John chuckled, and shook his head. "Sherlock Holmes, you are still as insatiable as when we first met." He pulled his husband (oh, he loved that word) into his lap and wrapped his arms around his waist. "But we're not doing anything. I want to save it all for tonight."
"I would have to agree with you on that," Sherlock said and kissed him quickly again before moving off of his hips. "I've gotten some clothes together for you," he nodded towards the end of the bed, "you can grab some breakfast before we head out, I think I smelled french toast cooking after I got out of the shower, I'm sure you'll enjoy it."
Mr. Watson looked at Sherlock for the first time then. "Oh. Hello, son." He put out a hand to shake.
good had come out of his mistakes. He smiled a little and shook his head. "I didn't. You've always had it. You just didn't realise."
John swallowed again and again, the taste of Sherlock filling him. He pulled his finger out and pulled off of Sherlock, licking him clean. He crawled back up the bed and kissed his boyfriend. "You are gorgeous, you know."
shouldn't have done that," he growled. He gave a quick look to the other players and they pushed John onto his back, holding his arms out and putting their knees on his elbows to keep him from being able to move them.
Sherlock bit his lip, trying to ride through the initial pain, but then John rolled his hips and thrust into him and the pain gradually started to dull. He looked deep into his boyfriend's eyes as he continued to thrust into him and he moaned softly. He could stay like this forever if their bodies would allow them to, being this way with John was
. He moaned softly and grabbed onto his boyfriend's shoulders to ground himself in this moment.
John smiled wide at the sight and tossed his towel next to Sherlock's, running straight for the diving board. He bounced a few times, then jumped in, bringing his knees up in a 'cannonball' at the last second. He surfaced again a moment later and swam over to Sherlock in the shallow end.
John was glad to see the smiling face of Ms. Rodin on the other side of the stand, and he felt himself calm a bit more. He took a deep breath and began. "It was a Friday," he started, deciding to be as detailed as possible. "I had just moved into town a week before and I had joined the school rugby team. I was walking down the hall after class had let out and I saw the boys surrounding someone, so I went over to see what was going on."
Sherlock pressed his lips to John's forehead, "and thank you... for loving me," he whispered softly.
Sherlock paled when John's father noticed the ring, almost panicked when he started speaking, but when he finished, he smiled. "I was going to wait until after graduation... so I could ask your blessing first, but..." He bit his lip and looked at the floor, "after coming so close to not being here... I just couldn't wait."
When John mentioned the word 'in-laws' he smiled, being married to John was definitely something he could see happening. He really did love him more than anything. Maybe he'd have to propose once they graduated. It would only be a few months from now...
... you make me feel so good," he breathed. "You feel... so amazing inside of me."
John's breathing was laboured as Sherlock finished preparing him. When the other boy spoke he whined and nodded. "Yes, please!" He spread his legs even more, feeling desperate.
"That time already?" Sherlock whined and nuzzled his face in John's shoulder. "I think we should skip out today... Your bed is rather comfy," he murmured into his lover's neck, giving it a kiss.
John kept thrust up to meet Sherlock coming down, and he moved his lips right next to Sherlock's ear. "You're so fucking hot like this," he breathed, knowing that Sherlock liked it when he talked during sex. "I love feeling you clenching around me. I love the way you say my name." He reached down to tug on Sherlock's cock, swiping his thumb over the slit.
John smiled at Sherlock, squeezing his hand. "Don't worry about me, I'll be alright." He started to eat, then looked back at Sherlock, wanting him to eat something as well.
John was very much enjoying Sherlock's reactions and he dared a peek at the nearby passengers to see if they noticed. One person had a funny look on his face but other than that, they were all distracted. John used both hands to push away the elastic of Sherlock's pants and pulled out his cock, wrapping his fingers around and stroking.
John hummed, all the tension disappearing from his shoulders. "You have magic fingers, my love," he said, glancing back at Sherlock.
The smile quickly dropped from Moran's face and he furrowed his brow in anger at John, "Fine. Whatever," he retorted and spit in Sherlock's direction before turning to walk away. "Later, freak... C'mon boys, let's go." He walked away with his fists clenched at his sides and the other players followed. Meanwhile, Sherlock was running through the periodic table in his mind for the fourth time, shaking and waiting for the next punch or kick to come.
The weekend went by faster than either boy wanted it to and on Sunday evening Sherlock was in a chair in the sitting room, burying his face in his hands as his mother pulled out old photo albums and showed John pictures of Sherlock and Mycroft growing up.
, John... C-close," Sherlock whimpered and rolled his hips in time with the other boy's. He swiped his thumb across both of their slits and his breath hitched at the feeling.
The week went by quickly, even though John was by himself at school for the entirety of it. But he was in a great mood. His father had calculated that they would have more than double the money that he had been making with the two old jobs combined, and when John mentioned that Sherlock's birthday was coming, he spotted him a bit of money to get him something.
"I know, love... I know," Sherlock said softly and sighed. Whatever John decided, he would be there for him any way he could. They talked some more into the afternoon and Sherlock hummed his song again, lulling John to sleep because he knew he needed the rest.
John shuddered as Sherlock's fingers trailed down his body and he made a choked sound when Sherlock's hips rubbed up against his. Alright, he was definitely at least bisexual, because he had absolutely no problem with the growing bulge he could feel in Sherlock's trousers. He let himself be pulled down and licked his lips before capturing Sherlock's, rocking his hips forward.
Sherlock hid his face in John's shoulder and closed his eyes, jumping at a touch to his shoulder. "Hello, Sherlock!" Sherlock sighed and lifted his head, turning around slowly. "Hello, Irene," he grumbled and plastered on a smile. "Who's your friend?" She said and looked John up and down, nose turned up.
Sherlock smirked and reached a hand down to stroke his lover's thigh. "Come on, love. Finish for me, I want to hear you shout my name when you come." He leaned in and started nibbling on John's ear, breathing hotly against it.
"I love you, too John." Sherlock helped the other boy finish washing and once they were both clean, he stepped out of the shower and grabbed them some towels. As they were getting dressed, he turned to John and hugged him tightly. "Thank you..." he whispered and kept his hold on the other boy.
"Not at all," Sherlock said, "I quite like the idea of you using my shower... it's a pity I've taken mine already or I would join you," he said and winked as John passed by.
, Sherlock...I'm yours..." He carded one hand through Sherlock's hair, bringing it to the back of his neck. He bent low to kiss Sherlock's jaw, moving from there to his neck. His other hand went to Sherlock's on his hip, grabbing it and threading their fingers together as he started to teeter over.
Sherlock smirked and moved closer, putting his mouth next to the other boy's ear. "I want you to stroke yourself... slowly and not too hard," he purred.
"Sh-Sherlock!" John said, a little more firmly. Oh, God, his husband was going to get him off in a plane. In front of all these people. He swallowed and closed his eyes, trying to focus on something else and force his body not to react.
Sherlock nuzzled into John's neck, "You're not stupid, I am. I should have told you. If I had said something... none of this would have happened." He shut his eyes tighter as tears started running down his face.
John pulled Sherlock down closer, enjoying the touch of their tongues. If they hadn't just done something, he would already be half hard just from that.
John felt guilty for not remembering these things, but he was certain that that was the last of the evidence that would make John look like the one who started it. "Then they all jumped on me and beat me unconscious."
"Mmm... But do you like the idea of me walking around
"Mmm... So are you," Sherlock replied and leaned down to kiss John on the temple. "Somehow we're going to have to clean this up," he murmured, looking down at the water.
Sherlock chased John around the pool until he cornered him in the shallow end, pinning his wrists to the wall. "Alright... Surrender now, or else," he said breathlessly.
John groaned again, the sound coming from deep in his chest. This new angle was perfect. He thrust down into Sherlock's mouth, knowing that it wouldn't be long before he couldn't hold on anymore. As it was, Sherlock's movements, however small, were enough to add extra electric shocks to what was already rocking through him. "C-close, Sherlock..." he warned softly, ending in a whimper.
Mr. Holmes sighed and rubbed a hand across his face, "we should have been there," he whispered. Mrs. Holmes went to his side and hugged him close. Siger instantly wrapped his arms around her and placed a kiss to the top of her head. He looked up at John, "You can go in and see him, I've informed the staff that you are to have full access to his room and that they are to answer any of your questions about his condition."
Helen smiled and nodded, "thank you, Sherlock," she said softly before walking out the door.
The sounds of John coming apart brought Sherlock to his own release, his hips jerking sporadically through it. After he was finally finished, he released his lover's leg and collapsed on top of him, breathing hard and heart pounding. "Holy shit..." he mumbled into John's neck, still panting.
"Oh, love..." Sherlock soothed and pressed a kiss to John's forehead. He ran his fingers through the other boy's hair and kept him close.
John gasped at the hot sensation of Sherlock filling him. He finally slumped forward, slipping off of his lover to splay on top of him. "Dear God...I swear, anyone else and I probably wouldn't have enjoyed sex like this."
"Nor I without you," Sherlock said softly and kissed the top of his fiancé's head, embracing him tightly. He pulled away after a while and looked down at John, smiling widely. There was so much he wanted to say to him, but he just couldn't find the proper words to express how incredibly happy and loved he made him feel.
John shook his head. This sounded perilously like a goodbye speech. "I love you, too. God, Sherlock, please don't go. Don't leave me..." He bent down as his tears became too much and he had to close his eyes, just repeating 'Please, please' again and again.
"Mmm, well I'm really not. But I do have a tendency to spout off deductions that leave people rather upset with me." Sherlock craned his head back To give John more skin to kiss. "That's why I normally don't deduce people... I was so afraid that even though you asked for me to deduce you, that you would call me a freak like all the others." Sherlock turned his head back down to look the other boy in the eyes and lifted his hand to stroke his cheek, "I'm so glad I was wrong," he murmured.
John laughed a little. "I'm glad you enjoyed it." He stayed still in Sherlock's arms, just enjoying the closeness in their post-orgasm bliss. When Sherlock mentioned about meeting his father, he couldn't help but think about his own father. Could he ever even introduce Sherlock to his father? And then-
parents, they probably already have some idea that this was going to happen." He smiled and kissed John on the temple. "What about your father? I mean, I know he's okay with us dating now, but how do you think he'll react to us being engaged to be married?"
"Love... Don't worry, okay? You're my only friend, who else would I talk to and dance with but you?" Sherlock kissed John on the forehead and squeezed him tightly.
Sherlock moaned freely now and nearly bit a hole in his lip. He obeyed and lifted his hips up, curious to see what his lover was planning next.
Sherlock smiled and kissed John quickly on the lips before pulling away. "Stay right here, I'm going to grab a couple of glasses of sparkling grape juice so we can have a proper toast." He squeezed John's hands before dropping them and walking back inside.
Sherlock wrapped his arms around John's waist and kissed him back tenderly. He smiled as he pulled away, "I wrote it for you..." he said softly and blushed. "You're such a wonderful person, so... beautiful. I just had to write a song to show you exactly what I feel for you. Words just aren't enough."
John knew he must be getting Sherlock's sweet spot by his reaction, so he didn't dare stop. He had never felt such a combination of pleasure and passion. Even their first time together was more love with sex. This time it was sex with love, and there was a difference.
He shook his head and sighed, he really needed to stop this, it was getting ridiculous. He was acting like a girl. Later that afternoon while lying on the ground, looking up at the clouds, he found himself dozing off and fell into a deep sleep rather quickly, dreaming of his and John's future.
John moved from Sherlock's chest to his stomach, down to his hips. But he passed over Sherlock's crotch and went to his legs, teasing them open. He placed soft kisses to the inside of one of Sherlock's thighs, hand smoothing over the skin of the other.
John tried to move but that was far too painful. So he lifted his hand and stroked Sherlock's hair. "Sherlock, stop. It's not your fault, love." He flushed a little using the term in front of his father, but he needed to comfort Sherlock. "There was nothing that you could have done. They would have gotten you too."
"It was to the sound of police sirens...I was aching all over and bleeding and Harry was...laying across my lap." He turned a little, trying to press his face to Sherlock's neck. "They said that she must have had a moment of sobriety...and she threw herself in front of me." He hadn't even realised until this moment as he spoke it that it was almost like the way Sherlock had saved him from the bullet, a fact that only increased his welling tears.
"Sebastian Moran! Stop that right this instant!" Sebastian stopped and looked back at the commanding voice. It was one of the professors, Mr. Lestrade. He panicked and got up, running away with the other players not far behind.
As soon as they pulled into his driveway, Sherlock jumped off the bike and when John was done shutting it off and putting up the kickstand, he grinned deviously at him and picked him up, throwing him over his shoulder and heading inside the door.
The next morning, John woke before Sherlock, smiling when he remembered all the best parts of the day before. He started kissing Sherlock's neck slowly, letting his lips linger for long periods in one place before moving.
Sherlock chuckled and nudged John's shoulder, trying to get him to look at him. "Really? Why did it scare you?" he asked, genuinely curious.
Sherlock hummed sleepily and pulled out of John, plopping down on the bed beside him. "I think... your father may have heard that," he said and chuckled.
Sherlock came at the same moment that John reached his orgasm and he closed his eyes to focus on breathing properly again. He panted for several minutes and pulled John fully on top of him. "Christ..." he breathed and rubbed his hands softly up and down his lover's back.
"This morning, when you told your father you were staying with... a friend. I just... I have to admit, it hurt. I know that you probably think that I'm stupid for thinking this, but there's still that doubt inside of me that you'll stay no matter what. I'm afraid that if you are that ashamed of telling your father about us, that you'll eventually leave me because you don't want to lie to him anymore." He held his breath after he finished what he had to say and looked up at John, helplessness written across his face.
The next day went by quickly, far too quickly if you asked Sherlock. He was enjoying spending time with his new fiance, talking and laughing, spending most of their time in bed. Sherlock still didn't feel up to doing much other than snogging and giving each other hand jobs, but by Sunday afternoon he felt well enough to ask John to try something new with him. "Please?" he pouted, looking up at the other boy with wide eyes, "I promise I'm well enough to do this... I wouldn't ask if I wasn't."
"Mm," John hummed. "Very well." He smiled and tucked Sherlock's head under his chin, tangling their legs, wanting to stay as close together as they could.
John giggled a little and winked at Sherlock. "No, I don't. But it's still fun to tease you." He grinned and then turned back to the film, settling comfortably with Sherlock.
Sherlock watched in awe as John's cock twitched between them and come spurted from it. The feeling of his lover's muscles clenching around him and the sound of him orgasming brought him to his own release. "
John smiled seeing Sherlock and his father hugging and could just hear what he was saying to him. As soon as Sherlock came closer, he wrapped his arms around the other boy's waist and snuggled into his chest. "He's right, you know. You're my everything. I can't live without you anymore."
John growled and shoved his fingers inside of Sherlock, scissoring them. He pulled back from the kiss to bite Sherlock's neck again. "I can tell you're going to be tight. You always feel so good." He curled the digits, searching for Sherlock's prostate.
Sherlock smiled and pulled John in for a kiss, "I'm sorry for scaring you, I must have gotten dehydrated with all the dancing." He smirked and winked at the other boy, pulling him down so he was sitting on the edge of the bed.
Part of John was still surprised not only by Sherlock's eagerness to full on snog, but his talent for it. The other part of him was completely lost in the sensation as he sucked on Sherlock's tongue, even going so far as to gently nip it. His hips continued to roll against Sherlock's, trying to get friction between them, and his hands moved to his chest, smoothing up to his shoulders, then down his body, over to his sides.
Sherlock sped up his strokes, flicking his wrist faster as John thrust into him faster. His orgasm approached quickly and intensely, his whole body convulsing and his vision whiting out with the overwhelming sensations. He moaned and whimpered as he came, clinging onto John.
Je t'aime tellement, mon merveilleux mari. - "I love you so much, my beautiful husband"
John was having a great time, glad to see that his father and Sherlock's getting along so great. He really liked Sherlock's parents a lot. He wondered in the back of his mind where Mycroft was, but the elder Holmes boy seemed to be aloof at times, so maybe this sort of dinner wasn't ideal for him.
John smiled and laughed a little bit, "good to know." He pressed a few more kisses to Sherlock's lips, soft and gentle, showing just how scared he had been that he would never get to do this again. "God, Sherlock...I love you so, so much. I don't know if I could have lasted another day."
John moaned softly and let Sherlock work his magic. His mouth was so talented, it was a shock that his first experience was with John only a few days ago. He slipped his legs between Sherlock's so they were loosely tangled together.
, John... please," he whimpered and thrust his hips forward into his mouth.
There were eight big leather chairs with leather footstools arranged in rows in front of a six meter high, seven meter wide screen. There were speakers all along the walls and a projector hanging from the ceiling. Off to the side there was a popcorn maker and a fridge with drinks, along with a cart filled with boxes of candy.
Sherlock faintly heard another voice joining in with the others, but this one was different, soothing... "
John looked up at Ms. Rodin when she came over, and then back down at Sherlock curled in his arms. He tilted his fiance's face up to kiss him a few times. "This is it, love. All this just has to be worth it," he said softly, desperately hoping that he was right. He ran a hand through Sherlock's tousseled curls. "Are you ready?"
"It's a pleasure to meet you, sir. John speaks very well of you," Sherlock said, taking his hand in a firm grip before releasing it and smiling nervously at him. He looked at the boy beside him and put his hand on the small of John's back in a comforting gesture. He smiled in encouragement, waiting for John to tell his father the news.
John led Sherlock up to the flat and when they got in, he called out for his father. "Hey, Da, Sherlock's here." Hamish popped his head out from the kitchen.
Sebastian laughed, "ooooh, we're so scared!" he shoved John against the wall, "look, you're still new here, so we're going to go easy on you this time..." he said and turned away slightly before rearing his fist back and punching John in the gut.
Sherlock felt John shifting in his arms and he realised he must be having another bad dream. "John? Love, it's me..." He started placing kisses on his face, trying to wake him.
much planned for John and he wanted to be able to enjoy it fully without worrying about tearing his wound back open.
John smirked and kissed along Sherlock's cock from base to tip. When he reached the end, he took it into his mouth, sucking lightly.
Sherlock groaned and narrowed his eyes, "bloody tease," he mumbled. He cracked a mischievous smile and grabbed onto John's hips. He swiftly stood and wrapped John's legs around his waist, then started spinning in the middle of the field, laughing loudly and smiling wider than he ever remembered doing before. This was just perfect.
Sherlock sighed and nuzzled into John's neck, "you do enough by being here... and loving me. It's not your fault I can't forget." He kissed the side of John's face and closed his eyes, trying to get back to sleep.
By lunch he was pretty hungry and he grabbed a tray, sitting down with Sherlock when he found him. "You really need to eat more than that," he said at the sight of the apple. "Have some chips at least, they made them pretty well today." He passed his tray halfway to Sherlock. "How was class?"
Sherlock panted, his mouth wide open as his strokes grew frantic. Within seconds he was coming, his back arched clear off the mattress. "J-John!" he screamed at the top of his voice and collapsed on the bed, heaving breath into his lungs and focusing on slowing his racing heartbeat.
Once they were back at Sherlock's house, he led John up to his bedroom and sat on the bed. He pulled John in between his legs and grabbed both his hands, twining their fingers together.
Sherlock held John and was silent, thinking about the whole situation with his boyfriend's father. He couldn't help but feel a little guilty about it, because Sebastian was right. John wasn't like him. He had never been with another boy before and had they never met, he would be going after some girl.
John couldn't believe it. Finally they were married, finally they were husband and...husband, and it was perfect. Everyone watching was teary-eyed, even Hamish who had his arm around Helen Rodin Watson. When they finally pulled apart, John smirked wickedly and scooped Sherlock up to carry him down the aisle and outside to their waiting limo, cheers and applause following behind.
Sherlock groaned and felt his cock twitch at the teasing touches and suddenly he couldn't take it anymore. He got an idea and reached down with his soap slicked hand, wrapping his fingers around himself and started stroking. He turned around, head leaned back and eyes closed as he continued to move his hand.
Sherlock sighed in relief and slumped against John. In a way he was glad it was his fiance's father, but he wasn't too fond of the idea of him possibly finding them in the shower together.
Sherlock shrugged, "I suppose me calling him out on cheating or picking on other students could be considered as provoking, but he didn't have to act on any of it. Besides, that's not what caused him to attack me. He... didn't like my choice in sexual partners."
John looked up at him with a tear-stained face. "What?... But you don't even know what happened," he said, calming a little. He wiped his face furiously and sat up.
. John bit his lip against a groan bubbling in his chest as he watched Sherlock finger himself, and his cock gave an aching throb.
Sherlock tilted his head to place kisses on John's jaw and he moved his hips so the other boy's cock got friction as it was caught between their abdomens. "There we go, love... Almost there... want you to come with me," he murmured against his lover's skin.
He was about to go off after him, but turned back to the girl, his anger clearly written on his face. "You are
John's eyes widened as he watched Sherlock's skilled mouth undo his trousers. "Oh, fuck..." He pushed his hips up, that last display of talent making him fully hard in an instant. "Please, Sherlock..."
Sherlock smiled as tears came to his own eyes. He held John close and gave him soft kisses on the lips, running his hands gently up and down his back.
John took Sherlock's wrist in hand, holding it there so he could turn to kiss the palm of his hand. "You aren't a coward. There's nothing wrong with not wanting to talk about something that scarred you like that." He looked up at Sherlock and smiled, sliding his hand up to lace their fingers. "I'll be fine tomorrow. As long as you're there."
John smiled as Sherlock's chin found its way to his shoulder. This was the closest he'd ever been to another boy before, and he had only known Sherlock for less than an hour. He leant back a little, pressing into Sherlock's chest. He wasn't gay... but he could certainly get used to this.
"Oh, God...
John flushed a little as Sherlock's piercing eyes studied him, and it only increased at the shower of kisses. Finally John grabbed his face. "Sherlock..." He giggled and shook his head. "You're such a sap." He held Sherlock in place, kissing his high cheekbones, his bright blue eyes, his full cupid's bow lips, and every other part of his pale, gorgeous face.
John leaned back, waiting for Sherlock to come back. And when he did, he couldn't help his mouth falling open. "Wow...I mean...wow." He walked over to the other boy and circled him, eyes grazing him up and down. "You certainly do know how to dress. And I am fighting the urge to undress you again."
"Oh God..." Sherlock groaned and grabbed onto John's hips, pulling him closer against him. He pressed their lips together for another sloppy kiss before reaching down to grab onto John's cock, pumping it a few times before wrapping his hand around both of them. He had read about this before, but he had no idea how pleasurable it could be. He moaned loudly and threw his head back, not caring how much noise he made anymore.
"It's alright, love, I've got you. Nothing's going to hurt you anymore." John held him tightly and gave him soft kisses on the side of his face. It was this sort of thing that only made his desire to see Moran behind bars that much stronger.
