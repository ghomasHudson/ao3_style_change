"So what do we-"
"Thank you Dean." Cas bit into his sandwich despite not really being hungry. "You are a formidable cook."
It was another few hours before Dean saw the tome slip from Cas' hands.
The angel hurried after Dean, expecting to catch up with him just outside the party, but the hunter was nowhere to be found. He kept his concern in check, quickening his pace and making sure he was thoroughly checking anywhere Dean could have gotten to.
Sam opted to just send a text to Kevin, not wanting to waste precious minutes finding and informing the prophet. At least partially because he was fairly certain Dean would just leave without him.
"Thanks." Dean replied flatly. But he couldn't help a smile returning to his face. He nodded as Cas returned. He had managed to clean most of the blood off himself, in an attempt to not distress Liam even more. "Let's get you home."
He felt a brief stirring in his chest, wondering if that could provide an opening. If he could convince Dean to come back with him. To let Sam cure him. To let them help him at last.
When the morning chill had dissipated, Castiel spared another glance over to the hunter resting beside him. Dean's eyes were glazed over, his mind clearly lost in thought. The angel sighed internally, trying to decide the best course of action. He stood, walking to stand before Dean. He offered a hand, pulling him up from leaning back against the hood of the car.
He felt the angel turn him, pushing him back with such force it cracked the drywall. He allowed the angel to pin him for just a moment before he threw Cas sideways into the window pane, coming up on him again, pressing his mouth into the side of Cas' neck, running his tongue up to flick over the sharp edge of the angel's jaw.
"No."
When morning arrived, Dean fell into his normal routine of shower, clothes, then caffeine. He wasn't surprised to find Cas sitting in the kitchen. He started a pot of coffee before turning around and looking at the former angel more closely. "That all you gonna eat?" He gestured at the bowl of milk-less cereal Cas was currently eating with his fingers.
"It look like someone went through it?" Sam pressed.
The car ride home was tense. No one wanted to speak, for fear of whatever fight might follow. Dean had been on a particularly short fuse as of late, and both of them knew it wasn't worth the argument. Nothing would change.
Dean snorted a humorless laugh. "Yeah. Barely. I got myself to that portal because I knew it was the only way out for Benny and You. I had people to worry about. That's all that's ever kept my shit together."
"Shit… I left the tubes… Cas, you see what I'm doing?" Sam waited for a nod. "I need you to take over, I have to get the tubes, for the canister." Dean needed oxygen hooked up to this.
Whatever medications they added had the former angel falling in and out of consciousness through a series of tests. He was relieved when the mood in the room shifted, slowing down. The collar was removed, and they rolled him off the firm backboard at last, letting him sink into the comforting mattress, allowing him to move a bit.
bring him back."
Cas opened his eyes, still laying on the bed in Dean's room. His eyes watched Dean intently as his eyelids just started to flutter.
Gadreel dipped his head in agreement. "It would seem so."
"Well I'm glad you didn't." Dean said seriously.
"Dreaming. I know how sleep is for you." Cas replied, seeming somewhat nonchalant about his current injury.
Sam's half glaring expression told Dean his argument had fallen flat, but he wasn't about to back down now. "I'll offer it." he finally said, his voice dropping into that gruff tone that told his brother he wasn't going to argue about it anymore.
"We can and we are."
There was a lengthy pause before Cas' posture deflated slightly. "I don't know." He admitted, feeling a slight twinge of relief at having someone to share some of this burden. "I'd like to think so but…"
Castiel walked the few blocks, taking in the silence of the small sleepy town of Lebanon, Kansas. There wasn't a whole lot to it. With less than 250 people living there, "town" consisted of just a handful of buildings, and only one bar, which, by Cas' estimate of time, had closed probably a half hour before Dean bothered to pray to him.
Dean looked sideways at him and then blinked a few times, and Sam was impressed he could actually see in somewhat real time as Dean tried to supply excuses to cover up the truth. "Yeah, I saw that this morning. Must've been out already."
Cas sat up when the hunter walked back into the room.
"Yes." Cas narrowed his eyes, studying Dean's face for any hint about who he was at the moment. He stood up from the bed, walking across the room, still unsure.
"It will work."
"Cas suggested you two were in a romantic relationship." He smiled when he heard the wrench clatter to the ground as Dean fumbled with it. "So that's a yes then, huh?"
Cas just sent another glare in his direction.
The case was a werewolf couple, on a well organized rampage through the elite of Kansas City.
Sam. He still cannot kill
"I do not believe Sam would be willing to bring any of those."
"Tsk tsk. Castiel, you know lying is a sin."
Dean gave a small sarcastic bow. "Why thank you." He walked out into the center of the main room, turning around and appraising the structure. Eyes still on the rafters, he spoke again. "So, we gonna fuck hard enough we break the walls this time too?"
The former angel tried to pull himself to his feet, but his motions were shaky, and the world tilted around him as he managed. His stomach rolled again, but it passed and Cas was able to slowly force his body towards the door. He frowned, walking down the hallway, gripping the wall to keep himself upright as he tried to find his way to Dean.
Cas hesitated, but he settled tentatively back in place.
Cas seemed to consider this for a moment. "No. I would be in heaven, watching over the burnt husk of the world post apocalypse." Cas shook his head. "There hasn't been a single day of my life I have regretted siding with you. And everything that has happened since, none of it is your fault. You didn't make the angels fall, you didn't steal my grace, you didn't even set off the spell that caused the car to crash…" Cas locked eyes with him. "Dean… you have to learn not to shoulder blame that you don't deserve."
"Sorry babe. Don't feel like it." He let his hands drop to his sides, feeling himself start to let go of the pain, of the doubt and uncertainty that plagued him constantly his entire life. He let himself start to embrace the side of him that wanted freedom. Wanted to live a little. His demon half.
"Sam, I'll be fine. You gotta stay close by in case Cas needs help."
Dean gave his weak obviously-fake grin. "Yeah, of course man."
Kevin on the other hand had just been sitting and waiting for them to come back. "Do you think this demon cure will work on him?" He asked, breaking the tense silence.
"Oh cut the crap, Cas." Dean snapped. "If you thought that I was broken before, what the fuck do you think will happen if I return with all this fresh blood on my hands?"
"He'll be back. He always comes back." Sam tried to be reassuring, not sure exactly what was going on, but wanting to give some sort of comfort if he could. "How are
Castiel sighed, composing himself for a moment before walking back into the room where the hunter sat. "Eight more hours and you'll be back to normal."
"Yeah…" Sam breathed. He closed his eyes, rubbing his hands over his face. "We have an entire library of occult knowledge, something here has to be able to help."
"Sure." Sam handed him a small stack of books, throwing him a lifeline to ignore his burdens for a little while.
Cas was apprehensive when Dean settled down across from him at the table to eat. It took a moment for him to sort of shove that aside and let himself enjoy his food. They sat in silence for a few minutes, each lost in their own thoughts.
He followed the angel to a clearing overlooking a small lake. When Cas sat, he settled onto the grass beside him.
Sam let the tension out of his shoulders with a gentle laugh. "Alright, fine." He relented.
Cas shook his head, his eyes looking up at Sam, trying to express what he wanted. "He's gone." He closed his eyes, feeling the world shifting around him. Breathing was optional for a celestial being, but in his weakened state he was finding himself needing air more and more often. Unfortunate, he thought, that his body would choose now to betray him in this fashion.
Cas smiled, glad his attempt at humor had landed well. He shrugged his coat over his shoulders and headed towards the door, leaving Dean alone with his thoughts.
The older hunter looked up at Sam. He struggled to get his words out, but he needed to say it. In case it was the last time he ever would... "I love you both." He looked back up at Cas, tears finally welling in his own eyes and spilling over his cheeks. "
"We're going to get you out of here as soon as we can, okay buddy?"
"It's on the counter." Cas said. He nodded towards the forgotten jar. "In front of you."
"No."
Castiel was silent for a moment, overcoming his own emotions to try to lend the hunter the assurance he needed at the moment. "I won't let you become a demon again." He repeated his earlier promise, trying to put a bit more conviction into it than before.
Still, the next time Dean awoke it was the same. Cas tried to pay attention, to really observe the details of the hunter's waking. He anticipated Dean was entirely unaware that anyone was in the room with him. Unaware of even where he was. Castiel let it go longer this time, hoping in vain that the episode passed, that Dean would rally and come through. No such luck.
"Ezekiel could heal him, while healing himself. But he'd have to possess Sam. I saw inside Sam's mind, he was already talking to Death. I tricked him into saying yes. But Zeek said if Sam ejected him before he was done, Sam was a goner."
"Yeah, he also spent the better part of the last two years out of his mind after he trusted Crowley, cracked purgatory, and exploded." Sam shot back.
Dean held his gaze, that smile still in place as he flipped the blade around and neatly plunged it right through Hannah's chest without looking back.
"I did."
Sam sighed. "Cas, we should all get back to the bunker. Why don't I take Gadreel in your car, and you and Dean can head back together." He spared a glance back towards the motel. "Can you two do a quick pass over the room, make sure we didn't leave anything too incriminating?"
"I don't-"
Charlie threw him a bit of a glare. Cas did as well.
"Metatron, no. But destroying Abaddon. That I may be able to help with."
"You have to promise me. Do whatever it takes to take me out before that happens."
Charlie leaned back. "We got to thinking that maybe that was the missing link. We started looking for any books the men of letters had on binding the old gods."
Cas twisted his hand slightly, taking Dean’s hand in his own. He was mildly surprised. Dean was usually conservative with displays of affection, and never in a public setting. He distractedly rubbed his thumb back and forth across Dean’s knuckles, thinking of everything that had just happened.
But Cas didn't seem upset… apprehensive maybe. "Can you hear my thoughts as well?" He asked, curious.
"Sure… you enacted a spell that sent every angel tumbling out of heaven, but you know
"We just passed South Bend." The angel informed him, providing no further information on why.
Cas shifted slightly, something he learned to do years ago to try and put Dean at ease. The hunter had expressed that it was just weird how he never moved 'just because'. Now for the first time he had the context needed to understand why. As a human fidgeting was largely unconscious. Vague discomfort seemed to be an unrelenting factor of having a mortal body, and small adjustments to its position was the natural outcome. With his angelic form restored, he no longer felt those aches, but absolute stillness was such an obvious beacon of his inhumanity.
Sam's voice sounded from the doorway. "Well, we'll see."
"How the hell did he even get out to begin with?" Sam asked breathlessly, his legs shaky as he walked to the side of the room, readying some more heavy duty shackles.
Cas?"
"Wow." the kid whispered.
Of course, the first night as Cas slept on the air mattress Paka managed to put more than a few holes in the vinyl. Cas woke up on the ground. After almost an hour arguing who would sleep on the couch, they decided to just both sleep on the bed.
He knew Dean was only still upright because of the mark, and he knew the mark was burning him out in trade.
"I can't quite heal it yet… I will need a little time." He withdrew his hand, using it to instead steady himself. He settled down further, letting a little more of his weight be supported by the ground below.
"Okay."
, I can do."
"It's not like I had a choice."
Dean started forward, giving a quick percussive knock to warn Sam it was just him before opening the door. He noted the intact salt line and repaired devils trap. Crowley hadn't been wrong. Bracing himself against what he was sure was inevitable rage, he kept moving forward. "Sam-"
Cas let a small smile slip past his defenses in spite of himself, and a little of the tension worked its way out of his shoulders.
"Sam has an angel riding co-pilot." Dean spat, keeping his gaze steady.
Cas sighed. "He'll be trapped by the warding… We can figure out what to do from there."
"Angelic for the most part." Kevin nodded. "Twisted and darkened, but still."
"It is going to be okay." He repeated firmly. He gave Cas' hand a small reassuring squeeze.
"Quiet. He finished fixing the impala." Cas turned his mug in his hands. He hesitated. "He asked me what the numbers were for Eastham. He almost looked it up himself."
Castiel slipped his hands beneath Dean's t-shirt, his hands brushing by his ribs, causing the demon to shudder involuntarily before he lifted his arms and allowed the fabric to slip loose. He reached down with the intent to undo the first button of Castiel's shirt, but the movement was too delicate for how his body shook. After mere seconds he gave up, instead ripping through the shirt in one fluid tug, the button snapping free under the rough attack. Cas leaned back just enough to yank the sleeves off his arms.
Cas sighed. "You're still in shock. Sam says it will pass."
Theo stepped forward and threw his fist into Castiel's stomach, causing him to double over as far as the chains would allow. A second fist flew upwards, catching Cas right in the lip, splitting it instantly, the blood splashing back into his mouth. He turned, spitting it out.
"Oh don't
Cas gestured to the chair near the desk, aware that angels did not need to sit. Gadreel did anyway. "What can I do for you?"
Dean looked past Cas, and around the surrounding road briefly. "No Sam?"
" Now it
Dean had insisted they look at the body before they left. He found himself in the small police morgue, looking over the grizzly remains of one Tom Gray. He frowned, poking the tip of a pen into the wounds, taking vague measurements and making note of the flesh that was missing.
Cas looked wistfully at his plate. "I no longer seem able to appreciate the whole of food. It tastes like… molecules."
"I don't know!" Dean cut him off. He turned away from the pair watching him, hands coming up to scruff through his hair as he tried to think. His voice softened, faltering slightly. "I don't know." There was a moment of calm before he snapped, reaching down and upending the motel table, violently throwing its contents and breaking the legs. He braced himself on one of the chairs, taking a few rapid breaths to try and calm himself.
"So what does that mean?" Sam pressed.
Dean whipped his head around, squinting to look outside the car at their surroundings. “Dude… you’ve been driving for like 26 hours straight.”
"Yeah. Anything else?"
Dean looked up, scowling. "We were hunting, Cas. Shit happens."
Bread, peanut butter, and jelly.
Castiel didn't think he'd ever really get used to waking up. When you're an unsleeping angel, every time you regain consciousness, something terrible has happened to your vessel. It had only ever happened a handful of times. So the days since the fall represented fresh sudden panic each day.
Cas shook his head slowly. "I am not sure."
Sam came out behind him and laughed. The cat was settled in front of a large mixing bowl and saucepan, both larger than her. One full of cat food, and one of water. "At least the cat will be okay."
"No. I wouldn't. I'm here and saying don't do it."
There was a split second when the room stilled. Castiel watched with a growing sense of dread as neither brother backed down. He saw the tension snap and Dean moved faster than he'd ever seen. In a second Sam was reeling back from the fist to his face. Dean threw another for good measure, and Sam stumbled back, giving the older hunter the path towards the exit he had wanted.
"Did Crowley manage to get you guys out?"
"And Sam?"
Dean cracked almost immediately, never able to keep from laughing at his own declared hilarity.
Castiel reluctantly put an arm around Dean's battered torso and pulled him from the splinters and dust, carrying him back towards the devils trap.
They pushed off, heading back along their route towards the closest elevator, reaching it without resistance. At least it seemed they got rid of the demons who knew where they were. As they approached the ambulance entrance to the ER, Sam was just starting to gain hope that maybe the three they got outside their room were the last of them. Then he spotted the two guarding the exit. Or rather, they spotted them.
Cas stared at him for a moment, annoyed.
"Well, technically you could. I'm not up for a car trip like that just yet."
Sam stared at his brother, his heart racing. "So that was what… a… a panic attack?" He looked up at the angel, hoping for some sort of reassurance. He thought back to Cas' episode when Dean became a demon and left. "When you uh… when he left you didn't… you couldn't breathe and you passed out."
"That seems unwise given your profession."
Sam spared one last pained glance at his brother, feeling a twinge of guilt for leaving, but he knew Kevin needed him.
Cas lifted a hand, touching two fingers to the hunter's forehead and sending him into a deep sleep. He let his hand come to rest on the hunter's shoulder, taking a deep breath and trying to process the conversation they just had.
"He's doing okay. Or at least he's covering well. Cas still doesn't think he's really processed it yet."
"Cas, you gotta promise me. If this whole grace thing gets worse, or if it gets too much.
Cas simply gave a single nod. The angel took a moment to place the other snacks on the back seat, laying the water bottle down between them. He let the silence stretch on for a few moments while Dean reluctantly finished eating. He tried to take in Dean's demeanor. He was definitely drunk, but Cas hadn't expected anything else. His body language was tense, somewhat hostile even. And it seemed that his presence had only made it worse.
"Oh yeah." Dean narrowed his eyes. "I know."
"Cas if he lost it yesterday, we can't put the blade in his hands today."
The angel stood, walking around the table, reaching a hand out to place on his shoulder, stopping him from leaving.
"Yeah well… sounds about right." They both stopped, looking up as they heard the sound of Sam's door close. Dean counted the minutes before hearing the distant clang of the outer door sound, signalling his brother was out on his morning jog. He took a deep breath. "Cas-"
"Yeah, well I did it for your own good."
He faintly heard one of the angels, Hannah maybe, asking him again what to do with Metatron. He felt the words form on his lips,
"For what it's worth, I got your blood type."
"I have my angel blade. And the fuel gauge is reading half."
"Sounds good to me. And Sam-"
"The demons seem to have staged the whole plan."
"Whatever. Yes, I'll call you tonight Samantha, don't get your panties in a twist."
"Yeah." Dean replied weakly, feeling that creeping sense of fight-or-flight kick in, but not being able to act on it while they were driving. He gripped the steering wheel tighter.
He didn't focus on the voices talking to him just yet though, and he strained against a firm hand on his shoulder trying to keep him from moving as he peered out the open back doors, waiting for a glimpse of Dean. He was relieved when not two minutes later a second stretcher was brought up and loaded into the same ambulance, the door shutting behind him. He let himself sink back against the stretcher, hearing the paramedic give a brief summary to what he assumed was the hospital they were heading towards.
"Dean-"
"I never do anything halfway." Dean managed to whisper over the flow of air.
"Dean, let Kevin go." Sam repeated.
The waiting was the worst part. The slow crawl of minutes felt both like decades and mere seconds. No one spoke again. The stillness of the warehouse was only broken up with the sounds of their own sorrow.
"The state of her fur implies it is far more likely she was abandoned." Cas replied.
"Cas, that is a terrible idea."
"It wasn't like-"
Dean looked around himself, still in a daze, but Cas could see when his memories started to quickly flood back.
"I would not leave you alone here."
He grinned and gave a slight nod.
"Much." Cas agreed.
Sam let out a couple more curses, looking around him and then behind him out of the room. "Dean hold on-" He ran from the room, returning a second later with a canvas bag he had packed last night.
Castiel hesitated. "Dean, are you sure?"
"Was he okay?"
"I'll be careful, pinky swear."
"Cas-"
Dean pulled back his shirt to show the unmarred skin. "Healed." He reassured him.
But Cas didn't indicate it if he noticed. He studied Dean for a moment, and knew instinctively that the hunter needed his space. He was doing his best to cover for it, but Dean felt like he was cornered. Cas had seen the amount of hurt and fear in his mind. It didn't cancel out the love, but it was not something to ignore. He let his breath out, shifting he weight towards the edge of the bed. "I must attend to Paka. I am afraid I forgot to feed her last night."
take this crap off my arm. Or another dead end."
"Then we can use it on Crowley right after. I know.
The angel was impressed with how long it was before Dean seemed to notice the direction they were heading. It wasn't until they crossed state lines that he looked up at Cas. "Where-?"
Cas watched from the corner of his eye as he split the chicken into filets.
"What did-"
"Okay. You keep in touch."
"Anything?" Dean asked, also already knowing the answer.
"Yeah."
"Didn't expect to see you conscious." Sam admitted. He tried to hide the concern and fear that he had felt the entire journey to the hospital from Kansas, but it was hard to completely mask.
little twitch, every tiny movement.
When Cas pressed back into his arms, Dean couldn't help a hum of pleasure feeling the electricity surge through every contact point with his skin. His hand slid down the angel's side, fingers brushing just beneath the hem of his pants. He reveled in the noise he got in return.
"Yeah." Dean said simply. He turned back to stare at the angel again, searching his blue eyes for something that would tell him something about what the angel was thinking. "God Cas, do you even feel
"You have people now. Who worry about
The hunter did not look up. "Sam tell you Crowley has the blade?" Dean grunted, finally moving to sand the front door too.
Dean turned his head to also look out at the abandoned town. With the businesses closed down for the night, the town itself was deserted. "I don't know."
Cas stared between the glasses. Hesitantly, he lifted the rum and emptied it in one quick motion. He tilted his head back, surprised by the physical sensation of burning, and not enjoying it. He coughed involuntarily.
for you, and you what, shed a tear when I told you? Then moved on?"
They were just entering the lobby when they heard the officer assuring a woman that it was unlikely her family were actually missing. She started towards the door, her expression crushed as she was turned away from help. Dean quickened his step, gently touching her on the shoulder, already pulling his badge out to show her. "Sorry Ma'am, What's wrong?"
Cas just shifted uncomfortably. He had been monitoring his progress in healing, but he still had been anxious to see Dean move.
"Whatever."
stuck somewhere away. The hunter tried to pass time by talking through the details of the case, but it wasn't long before he ran out of things to say about that. When he finally trailed off they sat in silence for a few moments.
"No." Sam agreed.
There was a brief window where it looked like the other shoe might just hold off on dropping. Sam and Cas watched carefully for signs Dean's behavior had altered, but it was a little slower on the hunting front, and Dean seemed more or less normal. Sam had told Cas about how quick he had been to accuse Gadreel when Metatron took him, and how close he seemed to actually killing the angel. They both had uneasily chalked it up to worry, and hoped it was a fluke. Weeks stretched on though, and with each case, he seemed just a little closer to snapping.
"I was just thinking. That kid, Jesse. He was so powerful, and you talked about nephilim. I was wondering what happened when those combined. Wouldn't it basically be a god? I mean, if it worked."
Dean watched as the stiff posture of the angel fell away into Sam's more relaxed form. The older hunter's chest clenched as he watched the confusion melt away into a stern anger as his eyes met Dean's.
Cas was once again impressed by how quickly they were unloaded and whisked into the emergency department. What he wasn't prepared for was to end up in a room all his own, Dean nowhere in sight. He remained calm though, reasoning that Dean needed far different care than he did.
CW: VERY mild smut.
Liam nodded again, slowly uncurling his arms so Dean could pull the coat over his shoulders. The green army jacket looked ridiculously large on him, but Liam just pulled it closer, clearly comforted by it's warmth.
Sam and Kevin were not surprised when the demon doubled back on permissions. He was compliant one moment, and the next he was furious Crowley wouldn't call and then would just let one of his long kept victims out. Sam
"Of course, I can think of
Cas' expression softened, and he managed a small sad smile. "Of course Dean."
"Without full powers I will be able to do little to assist should the need arise."
"Most people shake hands with their right." Dean further explained. He went into his closet, pulling a garment bag from the back and laying it down across the bed. "Excited to see you in proper formal wear."
"I thought we agreed
It was early that evening when Sam came out to the garage, interrupting Dean's work. He was amused to see Dean in the welders mask with Cas just staring at the process as is. "Hey."
"Cas and I were thinking Chinese for dinner. Why don't you ask Kevin what he wants." Dean called over his shoulder as he left, not deterred at all by Sam's insistence.
"Yes. I believe they are after your brother for the location of Crowley. They believe he has completed the purification ritual and Crowley is human."
A pause. "Read it."
Sam opened the door slowly, peeking his head in before entering. "Hey. Figured both of you were overdue for some pain medicine."
Dean rummaged through his stuff, pulling out a probably too-small pair of shears, and getting them ready. He held out the towel just in time for Cas to return with the cat and place it in his arms. Dean carefully swaddled the cat as if it were a baby in a straight jacket, leaving just the back of her shoulders uncovered to begin there. He handled the bundle to Cas, instructing him how to hold the cat so he could work.
"You hurt him, but he is fine. I healed him."
Dean waited until he heard his door shut before he leaned back against the headboard, arms crossing over his chest, the defensive mask he wore snapping back into place. He could hear his pulse creeping up in speed, hear it echoing in his ears. He sat up again, this time rising to his feet, considering getting washed up and changed. But honestly, that felt like too much time to think. Think about Cas being an angel. Think about letting Cas see his thoughts last night. Think about what these feelings even meant.
Dean just rolled his eyes when Cas took him seriously. He didn't move from where he himself was leaning on his elbows. "Please tell me you have a plan for today?"
There was an anxious moment, no one knowing how to speak or what to say.
"Hey."
"Sam, I
Dean closed his eyes for a moment, his face tight in pain, both physical and emotional. Fear was reflected in his expression when he relaxed it slightly. "Fine." He grunted, knowing the false bravado was ruined by the waver in his voice.
"You mean, do I want to shoot myself?"
"You mean you're worried I'll plunge this jawbone right where your heart should have been."
Dean looked over the angel for another minute. "When your grace isn't on it's last legs, I can see your wings." He observed flatly. "When I first woke up, nothing, but now. In the right light." He imagined it wasn't truly seeing the wings themselves. But he could see glimpses of the shadow of them behind him, like Cas manifested on occasion. Though where the shadow had once been full and robust, they were now a mere fraction of their former glory. They stood in tatters behind him.
Castiel was passively aware of the landscape shifting around them, but his mind was focused wholly on Dean. Their surroundings morphed into that of a disused ballroom. He felt himself smash backwards through a dusty piano, the sound both deafening and somehow amusing. He let himself be fully supported by the demon. Three more times they'd jump. The lobby. A drained and abandoned pool. Another disused suite.
." Sam pressed, tone mocking the direct quote from Cas.
"I see that now." Gadreel said softly. "For that, I am sorry."
Dean's expression was unamused as he straightened up and turned to look at Sam.
"I don't know. Eight I think? First one was an accident. Something followed Dad home. After that I guess he figured I was ready."
"Torture and subsequent death is likely the worst outcome."
"Yes yes, fine, whatever." Dean said, unwrapping the cereal bar and taking a bit in front of Sam with an annoyed expression painted across his face.
"Dean."
Dean gave a muffled cough, flipping his middle finger at his younger brother. Sam looked away, but he still saw the flash of blue in his eyes as his angel co-pilot took over.
"There's some pie in the fridge."
Dean furrowed his brows. "Tonopah…" He muttered, trying to think of why that name sounded familiar.
Cas pulled an unreadable face. He considered it for a minute before he settled into a chair next to the younger hunter. "May I assist in the research?"
Cas lowered his voice, in the vain hope that Dean couldn't hear him. "Sam, I'm not sure he
Sam shrugged. "Honestly, still don't really know." He admitted. "Never seen anything like it before."
"Still hurts like a bitch but…" Dean tested a slightly deeper breath. "I can take a bit of a deeper breath now."
Sam immediately tensed, snapping back to acknowledge the circumstances at play here. "What."
Castiel stopped, letting that information hit him and sink in.
Cas walked to the passenger side as Sam climbed out the other side. He met Sam's eyes, taking in his expression and giving a small nod. He reached Dean just as he had opened the door, stopping in place for a second. He reeled, seeing just the
Dean craned his neck to try and see what they were pulling out. "You get everything on the list?"
Cas looked at him. "I'll forward your request."
"I don't know… we keep an eye on him." Cas said gravely. "This first blade, he has it?"
Nothing.
"God no." Dean laughed. "Bobby would have killed him sooner than help him towards the end there… difference in opinion." He frowned, the gears in his head turning. "Dad's place got broken into too…"
"Yeah, you didn't have a choice. Or. Or you didn't think it through. Or whatever other bullshit excuse you have prepared this time. Save it." He slammed the books he was carrying down on the map table.
Dean turned his attention back to Gadreel. "So he told you to kill Kevin and take the tablet and then… what, you get to be his new butt buddy?"
Dean looked at Cas, watching him crumble, and turned in his seat. In a role reversal from months ago he pulled the angel against him, resting him onto his own chest and wrapping an arm around him. "Talk to me."
The hunter took a second, trying to let Cas' words sink in and connect. Not Ezekiel. The angel was not Ezekiel. The angel he allowed to take over Sam was not Ezekiel.
"No, not really." Dean sighed. "Look man. I appreciate you flying out here, and you really saved our asses. And mine again last night. But I can breathe now, so my lungs aren't going to collapse again, right?"
"Yeah… sure. I'll get right on that." Dean turned his attention to watch as Cas put aside his plate and followed up with the offered meds.
"That isn't really helping your case."
"But Sam returned."
risking Dean's life for your own happiness? Even more accurate, was it worth potentially being able to simply help Dean less? To help Sam less?
Cas pulled his own gun out, feeling strange holding the new weapon. He had fired a shotgun a handful of times, usually when his grace was on its last legs, but never a handgun, and never when he was at full power. Still, Dean was right. The advantage of a ranged weapon was clear.
Pain reflected across the former angel's eyes. Dean would bear these scars forever. "I didn't want you to get hurt."
"I'm just glad we're both still in more or less one piece." Dean said firmly. He scanned Cas over again, seemingly trying to confirm for himself Cas really was okay. Once he seemed satisfied, he relaxed.
Dean meanwhile scrubbed his hand over his face, blinking a few more times to shake the last tendrils of tiredness. He absently ghosted his hand over his ribs, sore from the rapid breaths from earlier. He looked up, studying the former servant of heaven and frowned. "It's not your fault, you know."
"Sorry." Dean muttered, pulling his hand back and moving to stand, heading towards the motel bathroom.
"I'm fine, Cas."
Castiel was surprised when Dean turned into a motel parking lot somewhere in Louisiana. “I could take over driving if you’d like.”
When Dean was human, he supposed that sort of thing might've driven him half insane. As it was, it was certainly annoying, but it really gave him time to study the situation, take in details he would never have pulled together otherwise.
"I will Sam."
"You two going to be okay?"
Cas set his mouth again, feeling a renewed flash of guilt.
"I'm not going to sit around and wait to suffer some painful terrible fate. I'm going to leave. Listen guys, I'm even willing to deal. You want to keep the first blade? Fair compromise. Less temptation, less damage, right?" He shook his head slowly. "I promise to be good. If the father of murder can settle down than why not let me?"
"Great. Just fantastic."
Cas snatched his hand, yanking it down and pushing his sleeve back to reveal the mark. Sam noticed both Cas and Gadreel tense at once. "What have you done?"
Silence again.
"This time." Dean pulled a face. "But seriously… how bad is it?"
Dean watched in silence for a few minutes as the boy's tremors of fear morphed into the shiver of cold. He slipped his jacket off, kneeling next to the kid and holding it up. "I'm just going to put this on you, okay?" He waited for permission before he made any move closer to him.
"Yeah. We will. I'll let you know if we have any breakthroughs."
"If you have heard of me, you know I'm not much of an angel."
the pull of Dean's soul.
Sam's expression turned immediately to concern at the drop in Dean's voice. "What's wrong?" He asked, his head going through the list of possibly post-op complications.
He staggered slightly when the sigil closed, but pressed onward, heading back towards the one separate bedroom. He silently thanked Bobby for the intentional gap under the door, allowing him to lay down a thick salt line, creating a safe space away from Dean to store things. He threw his bags just inside the room, leaving them for later.
"She was meowing at the door this morning." Cas said simply, as if were obvious.
Sam nodded. "Then it's settled."
"Really man, I'm right in the middle of fixing her up. Not now."
Cas nodded in confirmation.
Castiel did his best to tune out the half-restrained screams that issued from the hunter. He couldn't help but watch though, trying to catch Dean's eyes, trying to impart any small comfort he could. He felt his heart clench as the hunter managed to make eye contact, his brows set in what Cas could only interpret as sympathy. As if even in all this, Dean was trying to comfort
"No problem." Dean dismissed.
Dean had managed to put off talking to Cas for an impressive amount of time. He spent most of it in the garage assessing the damage done to his baby, working on what he could get started on, and writing up a parts list for what he'd need. He accepted Kevin's sandwich delivery with slightly more enthusiasm than breakfast, but still, like earlier, he only got through a couple bites before he just couldn't stomach it anymore.
"Dean?"
"Dean." Sam's voice instantly put Dean on edge, and he moved to the edge of the couch, straightening his shoulders.
is he?"
"Dean-"
Sam half collapsed with relief, hardly noticing as the angel laid a hand on his shoulder and his chest wound sealed shut. After a moment he tensed, his brain catching up. He looked back at Dean.
Cas was left standing alone, his heart pounding in his chest, trying in vain to process what just happened.
Cas nodded, still focusing on his heart rate. "Of course." He replied softly. He watched as Dean's eyes started to blink for longer and longer lengths of time. "You can sleep. I will be monitoring your rest."
start." Dean put the phone down for a quick second, pulling two new socks on with an embarrassing amount of difficulty before picking it back up again. "We're not keeping the fucking cat."
Sam put a hand on his brother's shoulder and squeezed. "Dean
Sam laughed, going and grabbing himself a cup of coffee while Dean tried to pick his dignity up off the floor. He came to sit next to Dean at the table. "Seriously though, you broke his nose?"
"You okay?"
With this in mind, without saying anything, Dean began looking for a motel to call it a night. Finding one, he pulled in, cutting the engine, and froze when he saw Cas' face. "We can continue on." He had picked up on the fact it was unusual for Dean to call it quits less than 12 or 13 hours into a trip.
The demon wished for the distraction of a fire in the hearth, feeling somewhat out of place in the early January Iowa weather without one.
"Bite me." Came the gruff reply. Dean shook his head, leaning over to grab his dropped wrench and going back to work loosening the bolts.
"Yeah. Why not?" Dean tried to brush off, trying to sound natural about it.
Dean allowed himself to close the distance, allowing himself to get lost in the embrace, even if only for a moment. Even then his mind screamed at him to let go and put those walls back in place, but he fought those thoughts with everything he had left in his tired soul. "I don't know how to say what I mean…" he muttered, his voice muffled as his face was obscured by Cas' shoulder.
"You had that look… the look that you get when you're feeling guilty about something." Cas explained. "And I'm here to tell you, it's not your fault."
Dean nodded, pulling out his phone. It was getting to be early evening now, time for another check in with Sam.
"You were going to leave when you thought you could lock the angels upstairs. Hell, You wouldn't even be here if Naomi hadn't dragged your ass out of purgatory. You left me for good, remember? So don't tell me you wouldn't."
"Did you see the x-rays?"
horrific thing I ever lowered myself to. But you got fed, who cares where it came from." He shook his head. "Sam, I went to hell, for
By the time the sun was setting, the mood had lightened considerably. Castiel spared a glance back over towards the hunter, relieved to find Dean seemed relatively at ease.
"I trust you." Dean said softly, though Cas could tell he was fighting a war with himself to say that. It wasn't a question of trust, though Dean clearly thought this was a bad idea. But with this blessing, Cas' last doubts evaporated. "What can I do to help?"
Cain!?"
He became aware of Sam screaming something back at him. "He's still alive." He finally managed to answer, surprised since he hadn't fully processed what Sam had been asking.
"That's not-" Dean stammered. "Cas, turn around."
Cas was about to say something when he watched Dean debate himself before speaking again.
"Before this mark, I was barely avoiding being crushed by everything that's ever happened my entire life." Dean glared as he didn't slow down. "
"Well, I am glad to offer any assistance I may provide anyway."
The angel let out his breath, sinking back against the opposite table.
Buffalo."
"Dean, if he hadn't, it wouldn't have just been you. Theo would have killed
"My grace is slow to heal me. I'm afraid I am still injured."
Dean was back in his room, just finishing getting dressed after cleaning up, when he heard the knock. "Yeah." He invited.
Castiel watched after where he had disappeared from. He staggered backwards, the conviction fading and leaving him shaky in its wake. He leaned back against that support column again, this time letting himself sink to the ground. He took a deep breath and leaned his head back, trying his best to ignore what just happened.
Their trip so far had been fairly uninterrupted. Save for a few brief stops, they had simply kept moving. Without interruptions, they were making excellent time, though towards what, he didn't know. Cas was a little surprised Dean never demanded to take the wheel back, but also more than a little thankful. He didn't really think Dean should be driving at the moment.
"Angels… has any angel ever… you know… had a thing or whatever with a human before?"
Castiel looked up, somewhat embarrassed. He turned the wheelchair, climbing up on to sit on the bed. He twisted, handing Dean the sling.
Cas set aside the other outfits, and carefully took the coat from Dean. He didn't hesitate, slipping it on over his sweatshirt. It felt… right.
"Woah woah woah-" Dean objected.
Cas put his hand on Dean's shoulder. "It's okay."
Cas should have
start." Dean put the phone down for a quick second, pulling two new socks on with an embarrassing amount of difficulty before picking it back up again. "We're not keeping the fucking cat."
The angel held firm. "That isn't true."
Dean had been worried about Sam splitting off on his own, but it was Cas and him who ended up walking into the ambush. Add to that, the group of demons they were tracking turned out to be a group of angels, and Dean knew they were in trouble.
"Kansas actually. Almost the exact same distance the opposite direction."
Dean turned and dove for a moderately sized branch at the edge of the clearing, throwing his bag to the ground, pulling things out as fast as he could. He quickly wrapped it in an old grease-rag t-shirt and tied it off. He soaked the end in lighter fluid, reaching into his pocket for his lighter. He didn't see the approach, but before he could flick the lighter he felt the tear through his flesh from the claws of the creature that was suddenly upon him. At the last second he managed to set the makeshift torch alight and he heard the creature shriek and withdraw it's claws from his arm. "
"With pleasure."
"Oh sure, you want to help now."
Dean let go and used the excuse of grabbing his bag as one last card he could play to delay the inevitable.
Dean finally got a tentative control of his emotions, forcing them back down into a box and catching his breath. His mind snapped back to the present, back to the situation at hand, and more importantly, Liam. He felt Cas release his grip.
Dean pulled a face at him before rolling his eyes. "Yeah whatever." He paused, his brain mulling through the problem.
Cas stood, gathering Dean in his arms and lifting him again. "Hopefully." He said softly, heading out of 7b and towards the hunter's room. Sam moved ahead, getting the doors. He helped pull back the covers, watching Cas settle him down.
Charlie retreated to be closer to Sam, being entirely unarmed. Sam didn't stand down, his face still set in anger. "And?"
"I don't know."
"No." Dean insisted. "I gotta get out of here. I feel like the walls are closing in on me, it'd be nice to take Baby out for some air."
Almost an hour later, the sun had well cleared the horizon, shining down on the black car and the figures now leaning back against the hood. The morning breeze ran over them, bringing just a touch of chill to the warm sunlight. They both sat apart, their eyes searching the field in front of them for something, anything to take their focus.
"All of them?"
"I don't know."
"Helen did not possess a coat, no."
Tom beckoned both of them to follow him back towards the office. "Hey, that crusty son of a bitch have a new number or something? I got a pile of truck parts seem right up his alley, can't get a hold of him. Ain't seen hide nor hair of him just as long as you."
"Huh." Dean said thoughtfully, silence creeping in as they took a moment to let this news sink in. He flicked his eyes up at Gadreel. "You think about listening to him?"
"Yeah, not
Dean watched in silence for a few minutes as the boy's tremors of fear morphed into the shiver of cold. He slipped his jacket off, kneeling next to the kid and holding it up. "I'm just going to put this on you, okay?" He waited for permission before he made any move closer to him.
Cas froze, looking up at Dean with wide eyes.
the hunter. Now?
"I just cleared the hallway. I will return your brother to you, and he can help from there."
He looked up to catch Sam's amused smirk. "What?" Dean asked, voice flat.
"Yes mom." Dean grumbled. He waited for the door to shut again before relaxing fully against the mound of pillows.
Cas tilted his head, his eyes narrowing as he tried to figure out what Dean wanted. "It's…broken."
"I don't-"
"I know." Cas took another deep shaky breath. He managed a weak smile. "I'm sorry for…" He paused, recalling the exact phrase. "cold-cocking you after sex."
"That's not a lot to go on." Sam sighed.
He would only have to quiet the hunter's dreams once that day.
"Oh." Cas said simply. "When the angels left?"
"Perhaps we should call your brother to assist in returning to the bunker."
He knew the chance to change plans was behind him, and this concern he had now was not going to stop him. He knew how to push through and past fear. He had led an assault on hell when she was at her most guarded. The only person who could talk him out of it was kept out of the loop exactly for this reason.
"Dean?"
Cas half woke up, lazily attempting to push Dean away. But when Dean just looped an arm across his chest, he gave up, instead letting himself fall back asleep.
"Dean, you've always been stronger than you give yourself credit for."
"You two scared the crap out of me. I get a pic of Cas in a Duff's hat, and then all of the sudden I'm getting a phone call that my brother and his 'partner' have been in a rollover accident and have been airlifted to Rochester." Sam scrunched his brow together. "I thought…"
He was almost asleep when he felt the bed depress behind him and a warm arm reach up over his side. It took a moment for his sleep laden mind to register what was happening, but his spine jerked to the side. He whipped himself around, throwing himself back at the same time, half falling off the edge of the bed.
"Good morning Dean."
"Yeah, I
was now as sharp as being stabbed. He was unable to think of the events without feeling it so completely that it overwhelmed him. "And sorry as well for leaving you after. I didn't want to hurt you further. After leaving you so abruptly in Purgatory, after refusing to return with you, after-"
The hunter was silent for a while, considering if he was willing to talk at all. His instinct was to bury this under layers of denial and whiskey, but he had been trying to do better. To trust Cas. To allow himself to open up to someone. "I didn't expect to care about you."
Dean gave a slight chuckle, shaking his head. "At least they had the good manners to wait until
"Will it work?" Dean interrupted, looking up at Gadreel.
Dean was well acquainted with the concept of dreaming. His entire life had been awash with nightmares about every sequential trauma he'd experienced. The few rare good dreams he managed were always the same. A summer at Bobby's or a normal life with Sam and Dad.
"We could always return to hell, avoid any and all possibility of an unhappy reunion-"
He slipped behind the wheel, his heart pounding in his chest, feeling utterly disoriented by what happened. He wasn't sure what had chipped away at his carefully crafted armor, but he wasn't going to let it happen again.
"Yeah, me either."
Cas looked distressed, taking in the scene around him. The smell of the extinguished holy oil. The haphazardly parked station wagon. The blood running down Gadreel's shoulder. He turned to look at Dean directly, his brain catching up to everything. "Yes."
The hunter managed a weak smile. "I'm getting blood all over your suit."
"No but-"
Cas gave a soft chuckle and the warmth in his chest strengthened.
Dean felt a stirring of
"Sounds like a lot of us then." Kevin admitted, digging into his own plate without any hesitation.
Just past the four hour mark, Cas had the passive thought that perhaps Dean had left for good, leaving him to rot here in this prison. He couldn't decide if that would be better or worse. However before eight hours had passed, Dean blinked back into the room, staggering slightly but managing to stay on his feet as he landed. He walked towards one of the work tables, casually tossing the first blade onto it. Cas bit back a reaction, watching the hunter walk into the harsh light.
He was so focused on the mission he almost missed the small sniffling sound echoing from around the bend. He froze, glancing at Cas before gesturing and moving forward with him. He rounded the corner with his gun up and found the source of the sound. He immediately lowered his gun before dropping his flashlight slightly, allowing it to illuminate the space indirectly.
Liam looked out from around his arms, his eyes wide to see the hunter. He scrambled up and threw himself at Dean who easily caught him and picked him up.
"Attending to a few matters outside of the cabin. Gathering supplies and seeing to the Impala."
"Come on." Dean said, not letting him argue further. He headed towards the building.
Dean looked up at them, his expression only slightly hostile. "Please. I'm
Cas felt entirely inadequate at the moment. Dean was already under every blanket in the cabin, and Sam had started a fire in the fireplace that was doing it's best to warm the space. "I don't know how to help, Dean." He apologized. "I can't do anything."
The angel turned slightly in his seat, looking out at the street. "We will have to involve your brother when you wish to return to the bunker. I am afraid I still do not understand how to operate a vehicle, and you are unfit to drive."
Cas' statement was met with a rolling of eyes. "Yeah, well your google level understanding of car buying leaves a little to be desired. I've driven in much worse than this before."
Cas had stepped out for a moment to clear his head when Dean next woke. Sam was in the chair beside him, and had caught the older hunter's eyes for just a second before the scene repeated itself. Sam found himself calling for Cas who came running into the room, his heart sinking as he saw Dean yet again trapped in a blind terror, unable to take in any air.
Cas brought his gaze up to meet Dean's green eyes, surprised by the unhidden sincerity in his expression. He felt the grip on his arm leave, and watched Dean grab two bottles of pills he didn't notice earlier from his nightstand. He accepted and took the offered medications without question, gratefully accepting the water he was handed next.
"Yeah, we'll be two semi-mobile people when you pick us up."
"Ring's supposed to go on your right hand."
Sam let out a couple more curses, looking around him and then behind him out of the room. "Dean hold on-" He ran from the room, returning a second later with a canvas bag he had packed last night.
. It had only gotten worse from there.
Dean stepped back, simply pulling on his jeans where he stood. He threw the shirts over the back of the chair, opting to sit back down without putting them on.
"If only it were that simple."
Cas paused outside his door, noticing it open wider than he remembered leaving it. Inside, half lit from the hallway he could just make out the figure of the older hunter. He turned on the light, watching as Dean blinked at the sudden brightness. Dean was sitting on the ground, back to the tile wall, Paka curled on his lap. He looked up at Cas and then away again, shifting slightly in discomfort at being found. Not that he was exactly hiding.
"Dean-"
"Rabbit food, you bet."
"A crappy temp agent. Who cares? Are you going to honor the agreement or not?"
Dean staggered inside and collapsed back against the wall of the shed, hissing with pain, still clutching the angel blade in his torn arm. He braced himself for a moment before turning to quickly look over the kid. The boy was curled against the wall, head buried in his arms and shaking but physically unhurt. Dean grunted, letting himself finally react to the pain now that they were tentatively safe.
Dean nodded, but it was clear he hadn't actually processed the information. "How long was I asleep?"
"This is difficult."
Sam poked his head in. "You two ready?"
"Want Cas and I to suit up?"
"Dean… Please… go home.
"Oh. Hey." He switched the phone on speaker phone. "Gadreel, what's happening?"
"Hey. You two got everything you need? Did you make sure the car has gas?"
Castiel nodded. "What parts do you require to fix the impala this time?"
"Be careful Sam."
It took about an hour before Liam slowly drifted off, his breathing evening out completely in sleep.
The hunter was quiet. He wanted to argue, but he knew it was pointless. He sighed, his posture deflating slightly. He headed back towards the black muscle car, sinking back against the hood. He knew they should probably get back to driving with such a long trip ahead of them, but he couldn't bring himself to leave just yet.
Castiel sighed, composing himself for a moment before walking back into the room where the hunter sat. "Eight more hours and you'll be back to normal."
"He wished for me to bring him the tablet."
"I'm sorry."
"Cas." The younger hunter greeted. "How are you holding up?"
"Will I?"
"And? You can change that sigil so it doesn't nab the one with their hand on the blood..." He stopped, reading the hunter's face. "Unless of course our dear Moose didn't
"Yeah." Dean sighed, feeling utterly drained and more than a little embarrassed at his over-sharing. He let the seconds roll into minutes, determined not to speak again, fearful of entering true chick-flick territory.
"Whatever. Yes, I'll call you tonight Samantha, don't get your panties in a twist."
Her face fell, waiting for the explanation.
"You have such a capacity for forgiveness, can you not spare any for yourself?"
"We are looking into ways to use that to lock you down if-"
Sam looked after them, dazed and disoriented from the head wound, but his expression betrayed the pain, not from his injury, but rather
Liam finally pulled his arms down to wrap around his knees. He nodded again, shifting his eyes up to look at Cas who gave a small awkward smile.
"Why?"
Dean blinked in mild surprise, his eyes snapping back green again. "Cas?" He asked, hesitant to know why Cas was using that tone with him. He took a half step back. "What did he do?" He tried to read the angel's expression. He noted that Cas' hand was partly raised, as if ready to attack. To attack
Dean opened and then shut his mouth, staring at the kid and feeling his face grow warm. "Uh-"
Sam settled the last of the pile of books on the table. He sat down and took a drink from the beer his brother had slid in front of him earlier. "Kevin just got the angel tablet together finally. We're looking through that and everything we got for sigils to help power down an angel."
"For what-"
"Right." Sam agreed, slowly.
"It doesn't appear as if anything was taken." Cas mused, looking around.
Sam looked back towards the door. "Next dose is in an hour. We shouldn't leave him alone."
The angel shook his head. "Hope that next time is better."
He let his head roll back slightly, looking up in an attempt to gain control of the tears. "I'm glad the last time I got to talk to you we didn't say goodbye." He remarked bitterly. Cas felt like in that moment, he sounded more like Dean than himself. "Not that you were even really you." He closed his eyes. "Maybe this really
When Sam returned to the cabin it was just getting dark. He slipped in quietly, hoping that Cas might have found some sort of rest. He hadn't received any calls, so he was tentatively confident that Dean was at least doing the same, if not improved. He cracked open the door to the bedroom, looking in to see if the former angel was awake.
"You two okay? Did you find her?"
Malachi grinned, looking the angel up and down. "Theo and I had bets on whether or not the Winchester would give you up." He looked to the other angel and then back to Cas. "We've heard all sorts of rumors about you and Dean, but I guess they just don't quite hold a candle to family."
Dean pushed forward before his brain could think himself out of it, bridging the gap and allowing their lips to meet.
Castiel spared one last long look at the hunter's face before he dropped his head to his arms. "I'm sorry." He muttered, though for what he wasn't sure.
"That wasn't what it was like with Crowley?"
"He'll be on the first plane over here. Again." Dean sighed, seeing that Cas did not look convinced at all. "Hey… last night sucked, I'm not gonna lie, but it's over. I'm fine."
"It won't come to that."
"Humor me."
Dean started to properly wake up and take stock of himself and everything after a cup of coffee in the small diner off the highway. He looked at Cas who was absently watching the silent weather report in the corner television and took a second to appreciate what he was doing for him. The drive was helping his mind clear, or at the very least helping distract him.
Cas smiled gently when he heard the hunter's breath even out, the familiar surroundings combined with fatigue from the hunt coaxing him to sleep far more effectively than anything else could. Cas let his head fall back against the frame and let himself hope that this fragile peace and control lasted.
"No."
Dean whipped his head up, but the verbal lashing he had intended to deliver died as quickly as it came. Cas' normally stoic expression was replaced with one of concern. It was… disarming. He sighed, having trouble keeping hold of his anger, yet feeling lost without it. "No. I'm not." He replied lamely, swinging his feet over the edge of the bed, levering himself into a slightly more grounded sitting position. If he couldn't maintain the feeling of control with anger, he could at least pretend with physical stability.
Liam widened his eyes, looking up from the hunter at the angel, who glanced back at him.
Dean looked up, surprised, having expected Sam to have left, or at the very least be ignoring him.
cost."
Silence stretched between them as seconds turned to minutes. At some point Sam and Cas began taking turns, giving each a moment to smooth the cramps from their tired hands, getting ready to continue, just hoping that at some point Dean's lungs allowed him to begin breathing on his own again.
Dean closed his eyes, pain still reflecting in his eyes. "Alright." He said softly.
After a moment Castiel gave a small sad smile. "Benny believed if you knew I intended to stay you really would refuse to go through the portal."
The other angel bowed his head in agreement.
"Shower."
"So, Demons." Dean broke the silence, nodding. "Fuck."
Cas looked up, turning his attention to the mild discomfort in his left wing. He sort of shook it out, the feathers laying back into a more comfortable position, the sensation fading.
"We'll figure it out." Cas stood, pulling Dean to stand shakily on his feet. He took the hunter's hands in his own. "Please."
"You mean stopping me from going dark side?" Dean sighed. He watched the angel nod, and he let his gaze slip off to the side. "Still helps. Having you around. You and Sam… help to keep me grounded."
"Hard to remember when it's Dean who is saying it?" Cas frowned. "I know."
Castiel shrugged, coming to sit at his spot and finally take a rest. Dean didn't miss the small twitch at the corner of his lips and he was taken off guard for a minute.
Gadreel met Sam's eyes, unwilling to sell out the hunter, but Sam answered for him. "Dean thought Gadreel had a hand in your capture."
decided not to fight it." Cas pointed out.
Dean managed to plaster on a weak grin. "Yeah," he patted Cas on the shoulder. "I'm fine."
"Charlie, Cas. Cas, Charlie." Sam introduced.
Metatron just laughed. "Yeah, no. Sorry cupcake, not going to work." Holding the tablet close he simply took a deep breath and extinguished the fire. Grinning, he backed up, a car pulling behind him. Two angels exited, before a bound and gagged Cas was being pulled from the car after them. "Well, a deal
"I still remember dying." Dean said, his tone somewhat far off. "I remember promising to try."
Dean's voice startled him and Castiel's eyes snapped up. He set his mouth in a line. "I wasn't."
"But there
Cas nodded. "And we are driving back to Kansas?"
"I did not say it would be easy. Merely that it is necessary."
A roll of the eyes greeted Castiel. "I'm fine, Cas. Today was just a long day. Sam got knocked out, you died. Give me a minute to catch my breath, but I'm good."
it?" He asked, desperate to know the answer, hoping it would somehow be reassuring. He was aware of Cas lifting his blade, though Dean wasn't willing to let himself think about it being used on his brother.
"Loosen up, Castiel."
The hunter leaned forward, resting his elbows on top of his knees, letting his mind turn over what was happening.
"Alright." the angel replied softly.
"I feel that now… this thing on my arm… it's like every time I hunt, I'm back riding that high in purgatory, or slicing into a fresh soul on the rack. And I don't
"How do you burn… whatever." Dean sighed, trying to wrap up the conversation so he could attempt the next part without Sam catching on. "Well, breakfast smells just about as over-ready as it can be so I'm gonna get off."
." He waited patiently as Cas moved carefully to avoid aggravating his wounds. He was grateful since he too felt the pains.
Cas didn't answer, keeping his focus on the road. He attempted to tune the hunter out as he continued to hound him with questions and snide remarks.
"I'll be fine." Cas hesitated before he reached up and wrapped his hand around Dean's. The hunter had withdrawn somewhat from displays of affection after that vulnerable night he held the blade. The angel looked over his pale features, thinking not for the first time about how young Dean looked…
Sam watched him leave, turning back to find Dean rolling his eyes again. "So he almost died?"
"That's being human. Or at least that's being us. You see that much fucked up shit, it's bound to give you a few nightmares."
Dean pulled a face at Cas' bluntness. "A bottle of jack and some decent luck?" He gave a weak laugh, but frowned as Cas continued to look at him imploringly. "Honestly, there isn't much." He shook his head. "Some nights you just don't win that battle no matter what you do."
Tom beckoned both of them to follow him back towards the office. "Hey, that crusty son of a bitch have a new number or something? I got a pile of truck parts seem right up his alley, can't get a hold of him. Ain't seen hide nor hair of him just as long as you."
"Attending to a few matters outside of the cabin. Gathering supplies and seeing to the Impala."
Dean muttered something Sam didn't quite catch before storming off towards the garage.
"Yeah, I'm pretty sure he's in shock." Sam set down the canvas bag next to the bed. "This was a lot for him being just out of surgery." He unzipped the bag and tossed Cas a too-large hoodie, which the former angel gratefully pulled on. Sam set to work exposing the bandages across Dean's chest and let out a quiet curse, seeing the bloom of red across the stark white surface. He grabbed a pair of trauma shears stolen from the ambulance, opting to cut away the gauze rather than unwind it.
"You can read my mind, right? You can see my thoughts? Take them." He tried to convince himself he wasn't pleading.
He recognized the feeling.
Sam nodded absently, pulling another book down. "He's at the bar then." He gave a small smile when Cas looked confused. "He does this. Whenever he's giving some final push to ignore dealing with his feelings, he drops all possible ways for anyone to reach him and seeks out the closest bar."
The sun's first lazy rays began to filter through the station wagon's windows, and the hunter stirred, opening his eyes before hastily pressing them shut again, even against the modest brightness. He froze as he felt the figure he was leaning up against shift slightly, but forced himself to relax as he remembered it was only Cas. Cas whose chest he was leaning against. Cas whose arm was wrapped around him. Cas who… Dean forced his brain out of that spiral of thought before it could get any worse. Right now it was nice…
"What exactly do you think you have to offer?"
Cas' expression fell back into a bored annoyance. "We already have a
The angel replaced his arm on Dean's shoulder, trying to offer some small grounding comfort.
