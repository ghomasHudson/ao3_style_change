Castiel felt Dean brush his side and grumbled as he moved over.  Dean laughed good naturedly.  Wait, when had Dean taken his shirt and pants off?  Why was he only in his underwear?
“You want the whole hand?  I'll keep it in as long as you need...  Whatever you need…”
Cas shot him a haughty look.  Cas’s chest was pressed to the mattress and his little ass was up in the air.  He had his knees planted wide.  He glowered at Dean from that provocative position.  It was almost comical.
Unbeta-ed
“We had to mate without ‘protection,’ as you and Dean are so fond of calling it.”
Dean’s jaw is set in a dangerous way.  Castiel has seen it that way before.  Castiel remembers seeing Dean’s face like that before he beat Castiel to a pulp in the library.
“It sucks to have cum all over you.”
Dean bit his shoulder gently and wound his hands around Cas’s descended belly.  Cas was mated and pregnant and marked up.  Dean had done that.  He was in Dean’s nest.  Cas had told Dean to take him here.  He was so full of cum already, but he just needed more of Dean’s cock.  Dean growled at that thought.  If Cas weren’t already pregnant, Dean would be pushing his seed so deep, that Cas’s womb would have no choice.  Dean’s cum was just that good. Dean pushed his knot in, locking his seed inside.  Dean touched Cas’s cock lazily.  Cas told Dean that he was good.  That Dean could cum if he wanted.  Dean came then, because Cas said he could. Cas turned his head, giving him gentle kisses as he rode out the orgasm. Dean took his hand off of Cas’s belly to play with his nipple.  That seemed to be enough to send Cas over the edge.  Cas opened his mouth in a silent scream and filled Dean’s hand.  Dean nibbled behind Cas’s ear.
“Why did you leave me Cas?  Why do you always leave?”
“Where is Castiel?  He said he’d come back for me.”
“I don’t know.  I could maybe check the cameras?”
Cas pushed Dean away far enough so that he could get onto his elbows and knees.  Cas’s ass was in the air, dripping with slick.  Dean inhaled sharply and scrambled to position himself behind Cas. He sunk two fingers in at once, savoring the feel of Cas’s insides.  Cas’s back bowed luxuriously.  Dean rolled the condom on as he pumped his fingers in and out of Cas.  Cas didn’t need stretching.  His hole was pink and stretched open.  Dean just wanted to savor this while he could.  He was not actually sure that Cas would want him after his heat was over.  Dean eased in, allowing momentum to do the work for him, then he thrust in quickly.  He growled behind Cas’s ear, right up against one of his scent glands.  Cas pushed his hips back, as if this would somehow get more of Dean inside of him.  Dean had already bottomed out, but Cas’s body clearly needed more.
Cas’s eyes darted to the floor and back up.
His grace began to leak from his mouth, so he shut it.  Dean gave his hand a squeeze and took off.  Sam gave him a quick, one armed hug and an unconvincing smile before he ran after Dean.  Castiel had exploded before.  He had exploded more than once.  Giving birth was apparently a similar sensation.  The nephilim was like fire and grace bulging and ripping from his insides.  It was as if he had to destroy a part of himself in order for he and Dean to create this being.  It was beautiful and sweet and sad and father almighty it hurt.  He was both mournful that the Winchesters were not here and glad that they were not here in case he accidentally used his true voice during labor.  The nauseating pain came in rolling waves, reducing him to a mess.  He screamed in his true voice repeatedly, unable to control himself.  This was truly awful, but he wanted Jack to be free.  He wanted Jack to meet Dean and Sam.  Castiel knew that he would be dead if he were a human. There was too much blood.  He wasn’t human, but he was unnerved by the amount on the floor.  It was as if he had hemorrhaged from the womb.  The stuff was still trickling down his legs.  Jack was clean when they freed themselves.  Their power allowed them to be clean with a thought.  Castiel’s thoughts turned to the threat to Jack just outside the bunker.
Sam could see something dangerous and self destructive in Dean’s face as they prepared for Cas’s funeral.  It was a look Dean sometimes got when he was about ready to do something reckless.  It was the look he got when all hope was gone and he wasn’t sure he wanted to stick around and see what happened next.  Sam would probably have to force him to talk about his feelings later.  Right now, he was stepping up and explaining what you do at a funeral to Jack.  It was so unfair.  Jack wasn’t even a Day old and they were attending one of their parents’ funerals. Dean should be doing this, but Dean hadn’t so much as touched Jack.  He had barely even looked at the kid.  Cas would not put up with this garbage.  He’d let Dean step all over him, but Cas had loved Jack.  Cas’s love had been fierce and unconditional.  Sam’s eyes burned.  He could really use Cas’s help right now.  Sam cried a few silent tears with his arm around Jack.  Dean stood a couple of paces away.  He said nothing.  He didn’t move.  Dean just let one tear leak out.
“Dean, there has been enough death and sadness.  If we were to make something together, I would not want it to wield the destructive power of the nephilim.  You weren’t there.  You didn’t see what it was like.”
“Did they show you something?  They show me things sometimes.”
Cas sighed shakily.
Dean practically sat on Castiel, who rolled his eyes.  Dean opened his beer and opened Castiel’s without being asked.  Sam raised his eyebrows as he sat down.  His eyes twinkled.  Dean took a big gulp of his beer.   His ears turned a lovely shade of pink.  Cas took the bottle from Dean.  His blue eyes were fond and smiling.  The angelic voices came out of nowhere.  Cas groaned and leaned against the kitchen table.  His hand went to his temple.  His eyes shut tight.
“I don’t know Cas.”
“Dean…”
Cas groaned.
Cas sat next to Dean in a backwoods bar, looking for the Cupid.  Dean had had just enough beer to just watch and appreciate Castiel’s masculine jaw, his broad shoulders, his tuggable looking hair…  Dean would have liked the Cupid to come over and touch the two of them.  He would have liked that a lot.
“Smells like plastic…”
Dean leaned in.  He wanted to make it extra nice for Cas.  Dean rested his nose at the base, scenting the stronger, more potent scent there.  Cas’s wiry pubic hairs tickled his cheek.  Dean’s tongue snaked out and tasted the shaft.  He could feel Cas watching him as he licked from shaft to tip and back down to the base.  Cas’s precum was better than pie.  Dean was addicted.  He wanted all of it.  Dean sucked the tip between his lips and slurped greedily.  Cas let out a surprised “oh!”  Dean smiled, with the cock still in his mouth.  He teased the hole with his tongue, pulling more precome from Cas, who wined.  Dean felt pride bloom in his chest.  He let his tongue circle Cas’s cockhead, getting to know it better.  He liked the shape of the head.  He was sure it was small enough to fit almost entirely in his throat without making him gag, but big enough to cut off some of his air supply.  Dean bobbed just a bit, knowing that Cas may just cum now.  Cas hadn’t had a blow job yet.  Judging from the look on his face, it was rocking his world.  Dean pulled off with a soft pop.  A string of saliva connected his lips with Cas’s cock.  Cas gazed down at him with something akin to wonder.
At Dean’s look of alarm, Castiel, shook his head.
“I haven’t even tried…”
Castiel nodded, making that face that he reserved for Dean as he gazed at him.
“Now touch yourself…”
“Dean?”
Dean had explained when the tattoo artist looked unsure.  Jack opened their mouth to protest.  They weren’t a boy.  Sam spoke first.
Sam shook him a little.
He had said.  Then they had locked eyes.
“I’m getting some shut eye, okay?”
Castiel went to what the Winchesters called ‘Cas’s room,’ to spend time with the stranger to whom he was playing host.
Dean asked.  He found himself putting pressure on the wound to stop the bleeding, as if that would work.
Cas shook his head and faced the wall.  He mumbled something that Dean didn’t even think was english.
“No. I mean it…  I am so very sorry…”
“I…  I can’t…  It feels so good but…  I can't…”
Castiel was slumped in his seat across from Sam, looking grumpy.
“What do you mean Cas?”
He asked, to chickenshit to say it back.
Castiel only remembered this after Naomi’s death.  He did not remember any of his near death experience or the ritual until his memories came back as they were triggered. Castiel had thought that he had gone to that gas station upon receiving orders from Heaven.  He thought that the pain had been from old battle wounds. Naomi had taken so much from him.  So many of his memories were lies. His real memories played out over and over as he struggled with the attack dog curse.   Castiel thought of how his strand of grace must not hold Dean together anymore.  He simply held that part of Cas inside himself.  After all they had been through now, Castiel knew how much he loved Dean.  He selfishly coveted the knowledge that they were partially bonded.  As he sat in the bunker, watching “Netflix.” He felt that old wound open and began to seep again.  He couldn’t go to heaven for medicine now.  Many of the angels would let him die if they know.  At least it was a slow bleed this time. He had time to think of what to say to the Winchesters.  He had time to plan how he was going to say what he needed to say.  He thought of returning Sam’s calls, but picking up the phone was simply too much effort.  When Dean buzzed him, he mustered up the energy to pick it up.
Sam swallowed.  Maybe it would be good for the grieving process.
“I always come when you call.”
Jack didn’t even have to think.  Sam and Dean shrugged at each other.  Jack continued to copy Dean.  He swigged his beer, Jack swigged their beer.  Dean wiped his mouth, Jack wiped their mouth.
“Why are we burning him?”
“Then let's finish it.”
“Hang in there, okay?”
“Um…  Jack…  Castiel is dead…”
“I don’t understand.”
“You need to drink that.  We don’t know how your needs have changed.  Call if you need me okay?”
“Jack? It is Jack, right?”
“We are not Lucifer.”
Finally, Cas dissolved into helpless, happy little sounds.  He pressed his firm body close to Dean.  Dean grabbed for the other washcloth.  Clearly Cas was in the mood for grooming.  Dean could get on board with that. He took his time.  He shampooed Cas’s hair, even though Cas made a weak attempt at telling him that Dean needn’t do that.  Cas could use his powers.  Dean sudsed him up all over and rinsed him down. He checked Cas’s hole out of old habit.  His finger pushed in and felt for damage. He leaned in close.  It wasn’t sore looking any more and it was so tight.  Cas hissed a little.
Castiel’s breath caught in his chest.  His ribs were painfully tight, like a cage.  A wretched sob welled up in his throat.  He and Sam clung together, holding each other in their grief.  His sadness was all encompassing.  Now that his father was gone, his brother was gone, and Dean was gone...  It threatened to overwhelm him.  He didn’t see what was left to live for.  Sam was his friend.  He could mourn with Sam…  The hurt was deeper than that, however.  It was as if something had been scooped out of him.  It was as if someone had cut him open and gracelessly dislodged something inside before tearing it out.  Not just Lucifer but something more.  He felt a gaping hole where Dean had been.  Cas’s face felt too hot.  He ached with pure sadness. He pulled away from Sam with some effort.  Sam’s hold was grounding.  Castiel went to Dean’s room.  He laid down in Dean’s freshly made Bed.  Dean had not slept here for some time. Castiel could still smell him.  He baptised the sheets with his fresh tears.  Castiel had wept as a human, but never like this.  As a human, it was messy and wet.  He did not care much for it.  These tears were a blessing.  If they did not come out, he may simply explode with feeling.  There wasn’t enough Dean smell, but Dean would not be back to bring more.  He felt as if he was anointing himself in Dean's smell.   Cas wondered if this grief caused everyone to think so irrationally.
“You may be correct.  Even though Angels are steryl unpresented, I may be in heat.”
“Cas…  You good?”
“I like it!”
“Protection…”
“And I you Dean.  Eat.”
True Colors - Cyndi Lauper
“Cas please-”
Castiel wrote down the enochian that Dean needed to say and the sigils that they needed to paint on each other before they got started. The three of them gathered in the basement. Sam brought the holy oil and Dean told him to shut up for some reason.  Castiel wasn’t sure it was warranted.  Sam hadn’t been saying anything.  Sam insisted upon staying.  Castiel told him he wasn’t sure that that was for the best.  Souls were highly combustible, after all.  Sam told Dean, with a twinkle in his eye, that Cas would be gentle.  Dean proceeded to call Sam a bitch.
“You wanna run that by me again?”
Dean wasn’t having this shit.  He squeezed Cas so tightly that it would have hurt a human.  This whole thing was giving him flashbacks of that time Cas had started using phrases like ‘kill myself.’  He was so glad Cas had asked for help at all.  The realization that he could have arrived back from a hunt to find a dead angel was upsetting, but not surprising.  Cas had a tendency to feel like he was “bothering” him or Sam when he asked for help.
Dean was halfway down the stairs when he finally looked back.
Castiel whispered.
“I’m not sure how it works…  I do know that your body doesn't open the way mine does. I must say, I am surprised…”
Cas was giving him big sad eyes.
“When I said “yes,”  I thought that it would be the only way that I could help you.  I thought that you didn’t need me.  I had decided that  I was of no use.  My body could be used for something that could save you and Sam.”
Dean plopped down next to Cas in nothing but a pair of boxer briefs.  He couldn’t seem to look Cas in the face.
His eyes softened.
Dean tried to explain that if Cas didn’t let him go, he’d knot Cas’s mouth.  That was good for porn, but Dean wasn’t sure that Cas would like it.  He stopped trying to try to talk when Cas found his prostate.  Dean bent forward and moaned helplessly, fisting a hand in Cas’s hair.  Cas hummed around his Cock and proceeded to rub against it over and over.  Dean stopped thinking.  His hips thrust helplessly. Cas’s mouth was so good and wet and warm.  Then, his knot popped behind his lips, behind his teeth.  He was cumming, hard down Cas’s throat.  Dean couldn’t help but stare down at Cas as he swallowed over and over.  The feeling pulled more helpless whimpers from Dean and more spurts of cum. Cas just blinked up at him.  Dean’s thighs trembled and he finally had to sit.  Cas’s lips were stretched wide around his knot.  The teeth kind of hurt, but not enough to cause Dean to want to risk injury by pulling out.  It was just the right kind of pain.  He was safe inside Cas.  Cas sucked a little, pulling one last drop of cum from Dean.  Dean’s breath caught for a moment.  He really did feel nice and snug and safe inside of Cas like this.  He let his gaze drift down to Cas’s face.  His eyes were half lidded and his mouth was swollen red.  Dean allowed one of his hands to pet and stroke his sex mussed hair.  This almost felt more intimate than a regular knotting.  One of Cas’s hands stroked up Dean’s lower back, down his backside and rubbed  into his thigh.  He let it rest at the back of Dean’s thigh, rubbing soothing circles into the skin with his thumb. Cas pulled his finger free of Dean’s ass, causing Dean to twitch in surprise.  He had almost forgotten that Cas was still inside of him like that.  The scent of Cas’s slick and cum was thick and fresh as it trickled out of him.  Cas just wrapped that arm around Dean’s middle so that his wet hand clasped his hip.  This was nice.  Their post orgasm scents mingled pleasantly in the air.  Cas smelled happy down there.  Dean could feel gentle puffs of air from his nose against his belly as Cas relaxed.  Dean knew he was staring down at Cas.  He knew that he was grinning like an idiot.  He just sat up there, playing with Cas’s hair and letting the feeling of his mouth and throat fill his senses.
“I was sure that, once the heat broke, that you would not want me to touch you anymore.”
Dean barked out a laugh.  He held Cas around the chest, squeezing him so hard that it would have hurt a human. He could imagine Cas smirking and wished, for a moment, that he could see his face, kiss his mouth, lick all that cooling cum up off of his body.  Dean cleared his throat.
“It…  It isn’t working…”
“Do I have your permission to hold you and touch you then?”
“No.”
“I will stay.  I will even hold you as you sleep if you like.”
The warmth and love pulsed through him with strength.   It was so cleansing.  The blackness and pain faded as the energy spread through him.    All he could see was gold.  He knew the child was good at that moment. They were good and pure.  Their human soul…  It took after Dean’s.  It was so bright and warm and new.  Castiel wanted them to live.  Castiel wanted Dean to know about them.  They were too beautiful to hide.
“I am. I’m resting now.”
Castiel gazed upon Dean’s shoulder.  He had almost forgotten about the fresh brand on Dean’s shoulder.  It was identical to the one he had given Dean when he had initiated the ritual all of those years ago.  Both he and Dean inspected it for a moment before Dean met his gaze.  Dean’s eyes were wet.  Castiel reached out a hand and grazed the brand with a feather light touch.  Dean’s breath faltered for a moment.  His eyes threatened to roll back.
Dean cooked them all a large meal of hamburger steak and eggs with shredded potatoes.  The eggs were supposedly out of date, but they hadn’t gone bad yet.  The hashbrowns and meat had been in the freezer.  Cas stood, leaning against the counter, watching him silently.  The smell of Cas, newly mated, mixed with the breakfast food made his mouth water.  Dean dished out three heaping portions, despite Cas’s insistence that he did not need to eat.  Dean raised his eyebrows at him.
Cas moaned.
Cas took the water and drank most of it in one go.  He came away panting.  Dean tried and failed not to watch him.  His throat was exposed and water dripped down his chin.
“My point is that I should have just asked.”
My intent is to be bound to you.  I consent to this bondage. With this part of myself, I promise to never let harm come to you.  I will protect you as you protect me.  My life is yours, as your life is mine.  Let our love shine as a beacon from heaven.  We are one.”
He had just died.  He was dead, but now he wasn’t.  Something warm, good, and powerful pulsed through Castiel.
He had a partially formed plan.  Castiel started to explain.
“Whatever you need.”
Castiel was surprised to hear himself sob.  He didn’t think it was really that bad.  He tried to care about the scent of Dean’s low grade hurt.
Dean allowed Cas’s words and warm scent wash over him.  He was pretty drowsy.  It wouldn’t do to be too tired.  He wouldn’t be able to take care of Cas’s heat half asleep.  He grinned into Cas’s skin, remembering how little he had had to do the first two times they had knotted.  Maybe it would be fine if he were practically asleep, but he was a giver.  He wanted to lavish Cas with attention.  He fell asleep to the memory of Cas’s cock warm in his hand.
“Cas?”
Cas seemed to be enjoying the attention.  He hummed happilly and fucked himself on Dean’s fingers.  Dean’s hand was getting soar, but Cas didn’t seem to be getting any closer.  He thought he knew what would help.  He had done it in his twenties for some of his cliants who had been nervous about taking an actual knot and getting stuck.  Most times it worked.
“You aren’t?  Huh…”
“Undershirt. Focus.”
Dean’s soul in true Dean fashion, tore itself asunder without question in order to mend his wounds.  The strand of Castiel’s grace, still left from when the ritual started, fit itself over the wound in Dean’s soul.  It was as if Castiel’s need to protect Dean even extended to that torn part of himself. Castiel brushed Dean’s soul one last time before leaving.  As his grace pulled back, Dean’s soul reached for it.  It didn’t latch on, but extended itself, as if it longed for more contact.  Castiel knew that that would be dangerous, but all he wanted to do was turn around and envelop himself in warm light.
“I’ve also never done any angel bonding rituals. It's a first for everybody.”
“Seriously Cas…  Your so…”
That was what he was thinking when the Lance of Michael buried itself inside of his soft abdomen.
“I want to hold you.”
Sam stared at his lap top for a moment, looking sad, then he raised his eyes back to Dean.
Cas and Dean said nothing.  Castiel simply took Dean’s hand and held it.  He sipped his coffee and played with the rings on Dean’s fingers.  Maybe this was what Dean’s life had needed most. Maybe the three of them with their weird little family could find some kind of happiness.
Sam gave Cas a friendly squeeze when he saw him.
“What was that…  It was like a rip in the world.”
“You are going to rut again soon.  I can sense it.”
Cas growled in a commanding angel voice.
“I told you to be careful…”
Castiel hummed.  He gently pulled his own boxers down to his thighs.  Then, Castiel ran his hands down Dean’s back and pulled his underwear down off of his backside.  Castiel moved slowly, not wanting to disturb Dean’s rest.  He was having such a good dream.  It would be a shame to cut it short.  Dean sighed happily at the feeling of skin on skin.  Castiel felt his cock react to that sound immediately.  Cas grabbed hold of Dean’s backside.
Jack looked back at Sam with wide alien eyes.
Dean scented him steadily until his breath evened out and his form relaxed.  Castiel stared at the ceiling.  He would have found this boring except for the fact that this was Dean.  Dean was never boring.  He savored Dean’s warm humanity, his scent.  He really was quite beautiful.  Unconscious Dean was one of his favorite states of Dean’s being.  It made him so, so very happy that Dean could rest and that Castiel could help him have good dreams.  There was something else as well.  It was decidedly less innocent.  It was the way Dean’s muscles rippled as he turned over.  It was the softness of his breathing and the pliability of his limbs.  It was the way that his knot would engorge in the early hours.  The scent of Dean, arousal, and sleep mixing together were incredibly tempting.  Dean had seemed perfectly happy to have Castiel lick him awake the other day, but would he be alright with something like that now?  Dean had given his consent, so maybe… Speaking of-
Cas’s whistling snore interrupted Dean’s spiraling thoughts.  Cas shouldn’t have to sleep, but he must be pretty torn up after that Attack Dog spell, and he had lost a lot of…  well, angel blood.  Dean made a mental note to get him a gatorade or something and make him something to eat later just in case.  He did really have to admit that sleeping Cas was a pretty funny and adorable concept.  Last time he had commented on it, Sam had shot him down with a big old “angels don’t sleep.”  Here Cas was, snoozing away.  His cheek was pillowed on Dean’s shoulder, the one with the fresh ritual brand.  Dean just kind of held Cas and waited for the other shoe to drop. Dean wasn’t going to get to just have this.  There was going to be a catch.  When Sam called, Dean was able to fish his phone out of his discarded pants pocket.  Cas grumbled.
“Because what’s burned stays dead.”
Castiel felt sleepy and mellow.
Cas had begun to shift distractedly. Dean could now see his flushed cock and began to salivate.  He’d always had a bit of a thing for omega cocks.  Cas’s was bigger than average and it was rosie with blood.  He really wanted to find out what it tasted like.  Cas was his friend.  Cas was his friend and he deserved better.  Cas deserved a compassionate alpha who would suck his cock and then take him slow, preferably with Cas on top so as not to hurt him.  Dean loved that image.  Cas’s chest and cheeks all flushed as he slowly slid down a nice big cock.  Dean was betting he purred.  He bet Cas made lots of happy throat noises while he took what he wanted. Dean caught himself in the middle of his fantasy and mentaly slapped himself. He tore his eyes away from Cas, even though he looked delicious.  Dean was disgusted by his own smell.  He smelled all hot and worked up.  Cas gazed at him with glassy eyes.  Dean tried again.
Castiel opened the water for Dean and held it out to him.
“Hey…”
Sam tried again. Castiel and Dean both said “no” simultaneously.
Dean’s eyes darted down and he licked his lips.
Cas hummed around the balls that were comfortably seated inside of his mouth.  Dean gestured to his bedside cabinet.  Cas knew what that meant. Condoms? Cas pulled his face out from between Dean’s legs with a soft pop.
Castiel was not completely delusional.  In order to help Sam and Dean, he had betrayed them deeply by letting Lucifer use him as a puppet.  He had used his mind bunker as a safe place.  A place that held the memory of their scent and kindness.  He knew that Dean would be angry with him.  He knew that, even with all of the bonding and mating, Dean would resent him.  Sam would never trust him again.  Of this, Castiel was sure.  It broke his heart.  Sam was a dear friend to him.  He was the most precious person in the world to Dean.  Dean was everything to Castiel.  It was a vicious circle.  Castiel held Dean tighter to his chest, kissing the top of his head.  He loved Dean so much that it hurt.  He had a feeling that, when it came time to leave this room, Dean would want to go back to normal.  Castiel would go, but he would go with an aching chasm where Dean used to be.
Sam had thought that Dean was with them, but when he looked up, Dean wasn’t there.
“Could you keep me in the loop here please?”
“So the bleeding stopped.  Anything else we can do to help him heal?”
“I understand.  They would like to meet you soon. I do not wish for my selfishness to punish them.”
“What is it Sam?”
“I've got some fake slick to ease the way…  You know how I opened you up during your heat?... With my hand?...”
Dean glanced from Cas, who was RIGHT THERE, to Sam, and back.
Dean chugged his water.
“Angels don’t have heats.  Don’t be ridiculous.”
Castiel whispered to him.  He was beginning to harden himself.
“Shit, that was you.  That was you, wasn’t it Cas?”
“And you are my human.”
“Okay, knock it off.”
Dean had seen that face before.  It was the face Cas had made when he was trying to understand Dean’s porn.
Now that Dean knew, Cas smelled pregnant too.  It was a smell that made him want to get Cas in his bed so that Dean could really mark him…  Be marked by him…  He wished he had smelled it before.
“There is no need. You will not get pregnant.  I will not give you any diseases.  I wish to be inside you…”
Dean’s voice broke.
Cas was giving him one of those smiles.  The smiles where he wrinkled his nose and squinted his eyes that made Dean’s stomach jump around.
“Let's do it.”
“You need to come Cas.  You'll feel better if you come.”
“Yes.  I let fear control my actions.”
“It’s um…”
Cas gave him the sad eyes again.
“When not talking caused me to assume that you didn’t want me to stay.  I assumed that you would ask me to leave.  You did it before. Don’t Dean, I don’t blame you.”
Dean grunted, pushing Cas’s legs open.  God he could see everything from this angle.  He could even smell Cas.  Cas had no business smelling this nice.  Dean squeezed a little lube into his hand.  Cas reached out for him and caressed his cheek.  The touch of his hand was very much like his the way his grace had brushed against Dean’s soul.  This was Cas.  Perhaps that is what gave Dean the courage to lean forward and take his cock in his hand.  Cas made a sound that he liked a lot.  It was surprised, breathy, and downright reverent. It lent him courage.  Cas liked being touched.  Cas was slowly hardening.  Dean tightened his grip and gave Cas’s cock a few strokes.
“I should have felt its present.  I should want to destroy it.”
“My grace is bleeding out slowly.  If I had a medic in heaven, they could help.  I can’t exactly do that now.”
Dean pushed him away, causing him to grunt a little.  Dean held him out at arm’s length, looking into his face.
“I’m going to make it even better for you Dean…”
“And here you are letting me use your body because you know it will ease my discomfort...  I may be able to deal with this on my own, but you’re here...   You are so good to me, and yet I failed you once again.  Dean I-”
“Dean, how long have you been on those suppressants?”
Dean was kicking himself.  He didn’t like to ask for things in bed.  He should just do whatever Cas wants.
Dean could practically hear Cas rolling his eyes.
“Think you’ve done enough Cas.”
Dean chuckled and plucked one from the pile anyway.
“You need it again?
“How you doing Cas?”
A strong energy shot through his grace.  It was pure power.  He was so weak.  Castiel closed his eyes.
“No.”
“I’m pregnant with a half human, Dean.  Occasionally, I need a nap and a snack.”
“Dean-”
“Dean…”
Castiel’s grace pulse pulsed with love and longing for Dean.  it stretched out, reaching for him.  The sensation of Dean’s rough hand on his penis was a pleasurable edge.  Castiel was lost in a warm feeling of Dean’s soul, just out of reach, the teasing of his hand, and Dean’s eye’s. The cold, wet finger against his hole startled him out of his trance.  Castiel felt his body jump involuntarily.  His muscles clenched. Dean’s eyes went wide and he pulled away.  Both of his slick hands went to Castiel’s thighs and he stroked them.
Cas whispered.  Cas really did have the perfect voice for phone sex.
Cas nodded.
“Mate me Dean…  I want you to…”
“Dean I…”
The way Cas was running his finger tips over his face was so tender that it almost hurt.
Dean chuckled in a naked sort of way.
Cas’s eyes were soft and his scent was laced with contented omega, pleasure, and something Dean didn’t know.  It was familiar, but hard to identify.  He had smelled it on Cas before, when Cas was digging into food Dean had made for him, or when Dean woke up and Cas was sitting next to him.  He had smelled it on Cas when they went for a drive.  The connotations made him uneasy.  Dean pulled his hand away. He handed Cas another water.
They were clumsy and awkward, but they made it up stairs.  Cas flopped down onto Dean’s bed.  His chest still glistened with holy oil.  Dean’s dick seemed to find that interesting.  While he was busy getting the lube, Cas was busy ridding himself of pants and drawers and oh wow that was a dick.  Dean was ready to have a freak out.  He usually did, right before messing around with a man, but that didn’t really happen.  Cas was really just Cas.  Dean had let him touch his soul, for crying out loud.  As if reading his mind, Cas spoke.
Cas stood up and began to wash Dean’s belly.  He acted as if there was no place that he would rather be.  His eyes were naked in their longing.  Dean tried to swallow the lump in his throat.  Why was Cas talking so much?
“Angels don’t think of gender the same way you do Dean.  I know our child’s sex, but they have not presented a gender as of yet.  I doubt they will for some time yet.”
“Grooming…"
“Dean…  You burned yourself…”
Sam gestured to the tablet.  Sam was apparently reading an article, but there was a picture above the article.  It depicted two tiny pale, thin, humans with creamy complections and looks of idiot wonder on their faces as they gazed at  a giant of 20 or 30 feet in height.  His skin was leathery and deeply tanned.  He dragged a club that had, presumably, been fashioned from the entire trunk of a tree.  His face was long and gaunt.  He looked wrathful and unkind down to his bones.  He was naked but for a necklace of bone and a loincloth.  Sam gestured to the giant.
“You are insufferable.”
He paused.
“Beloved…”
Then, in a long ago room, Zachariah was trying to get Dean out of the way.  Cas had appeared to help him.  He had been so close, with his hand on Dean’s mouth.  Then Cas had activated the angelic banishing sigil, and he was gone.
“Dean… Go to him.”
“Did you have nice dreams?”
Dean leaned back, stroking his back.  It soothed the fever a little.  Castiel told Dean that a knot wasn’t enough.  This heat needed something else if they were to quench the fires.  Dean’s hands faltered when Castiel tried to explain.
This was the exact reason why Castiel had hidden it from Dean.
Dean found himself scratching the back of his head.  The tips of his ears down to his chest burned pink.  For once, Cas wasn’t giving him sad eyes.  Cas was smiling.  Cas had really nice gummy awkward smiles that made Dean’s chest feel weird.
“No!  You can’t just die on me!”
Dean left, chasing Sam and bellowing at him playfully.
What had those little girls said?  Destiel?  That was dumb.  Sam was probably going to start making Deastiel jokes now.  They didn’t need a couple names.  They could have some kind of happiness together.  Cas and Sam were his family.  He had them both, so everything was going to be fine.
“When have you ever indicated that you may be interested in me romantically Dean?  I bound myself to you through my actions, but…”
Sam’s shoulders slumped.  He could still see a tear drying on Dean’s cheek.  Dean’s face set into an expression that gave nothing away.  He said nothing, so Sam spoke.
Jack did an honest to god perfect squint and head tilt.  The kind that Cas always did.
The corner of Cas’s lip quirked up.  He gazed upon Sam with fondness.
“You can…  be a little more involved…  If you want…”
They looked up at Sam.  Their eyes were now human looking, and stunningly blue.
Dean was glad that the water was hot.  Cas wouldn't feel his tears.  It would mix right in.  Dean didn’t speak.  He was worried that his voice would give him away.
“That knot up inside you?”
Cas finished.  He was now panting.  Dean ached for him, but he felt queasy.  What if the line had to be crossed?  A voice deep in his mind chimed in. The line was crossed when you stuck your hand up inside of him.  The line was crossed when you took that hand and jacked off into it.  Suck it up Winchester.  He’s hurting and you know what needs to be done. Dean bit back a mewling sound that threatened to bubble up from his throat.  He was incredibly uncomfortable with what he was about to do.  Hopefully Cas wouldn’t hate him after this.
Dean supplied uselessly.  He turned his head so as to get a good view.  Cas was watching him intently.  Of course he was.  His blue eyes were sharp and dark.  Dean smelled his pleasure.  He smelled like a low grade heat.  Cas mostly smelled of arousal, happy omega, satisfaction, and that Cas smell that Dean knew very well.
Castiel felt his face split into a grin.  He was in a lot of pain, but it was always good to hear Dean’s voice.
“Castiel has a weakness.  He likes you.”
Castiel could smell holy oil on Dean’s hands.  He supposed he must have been further gone than he had initially thought.  He simply locked eyes with Dean.  Knowing that Dean would need verbal reassurance, he said.
“He’s good.  We just had to complete the ritual.  I think he’s gonna need a lot of rest.
Cas was trying to push Dean’s hand further in.
“Cas!  What that hell?!”
Castiel felt his face heat up even more.  He had not been sure that that had been a possibility.  So that is what Sam and Dean had meant.  Castiel still wanted Dean’s dick very much.  He wasted no time in climbing over Dean’s vulnerable body and scenting him.  He honestly needed the scent.  His body was already beginning to relax.  Cas buried his face in Dean’s neck and nibbled at it.  Dean made lovely noises.  Little gasps that made Cas grin and grind their cocks together. It wasn’t enough for his body though.  Cas found himself curled around Dean’s torso, whimpering. It disturbed him that a physical pain could affect him like this.
“Soon as my knot goes down, we’ll make a plan.”
Cas made a humming sound.
“You know, ever since we met, ever since I pulled you out of hell…  Knowing you has changed me…  Because you care, I care. I care about you, I care about Sam, I care about the whole world because of you.  You changed me Dean.”
“Well, get this,”
“Cas are you okay?”
“Nephilim?”
“Actually Cas, We’re ma-mated now.  If you have another heat or…  um…  just want to do that again sometime…  There would be…”
“You two smell mated Dean.  I don’t know what to tell you.”
There was a pause.
“I’ll be right back for you Jack.  Don’t go anywhere…”
Dean was silent.  They had never mated.  They weren’t even fully mated now, not technically anyway.
The scent of Cas’s arousal spiked and a fat bead of precome driped into Dean’s thumb.
“Didn’t it work?”
“If I thought…”
“Come on man.  I gotta talk to you.  You don’t have to do this by yourself.”
“Dean.  Dean, please do not hide from me.”
“Someone likes kissing.”
“Not to say I told you so but…  you know…”
Dean smiled down at him.  He had the best human face, even when his eyes were swimming with tears.
“What can Sam and me do?”
It was Dean’s turn to hide in the library.  Cas had given him a lot to think about.  Sam and Cas sat together in the war room while Cas tried to get him up to speed.
“Destroying Michael’s lance may work.  It may not...  Ramiel is more focussed on you”
He grumbled.  Then he gingerly took Dean into his arms and flung him onto Dean’s memory foam mattress.  Dean whined, missing Cas’s scent and heat.  Cas was so mean.  He blinked up at Cas who had disrobed quickly.
Cas stroked Dean’s hands where they rested against his skin.  Cas licked the cum from his palm.
Castiel pursed his lips and blinked slowly. Sam urged him to keep fighting with wide eyes.
The two of them just kind of stood out in the hall, looking at each other.  It felt natural, and super weird.
“Dean?...  What are you doing?”
“It’s like…  A tear in the world?”
Sam had his laptop open to ‘unisex baby names on.’
Cas whined, long and loud.  Dean could hear it in real time.
“It wasn’t a given Dean.  If you had wanted me to leave, I would have left.”
Dean teased, mostly to annoy Sam.
Dean took a steadying breath, which he shouldn’t have done.  The scent went straight to his cock.  Still, he picked up a water and made his way over to his bed.  Cas looked real pretty in his bed…
“Here's Dean.”
He interrupted.  Cas cast a grumpy eye over the pile of condoms.
“They wanted to meet you.  I told them about you…  That we share a special connection…  I told them to trust Dean and Sam.”
Time after time, Dean experienced memories of Cas’s gentle healing touch.
“I want you to know that I was coming right back, alright?”
“Me and Sam are here man.  What can we do?”
The muscles of Castiel’s thighs loosened.  He was so tired.  His grace was beginning to slip away again.  They were wasting time.  Dean was taking such care.  He longed to touch Dean’s soul again, to curl around it, to burrow into it and snuggle in. Guilt lodged in his throat.
Dean shook his head.  Sam said he liked the name Elliot. Nobody liked that name, except for Sam.  Dean also like the names Kurtis, Stephen, Robert, and Sam.  Sam refused to let Dean name the child after him, even though the kid didn’t seem to mind.  Cas shot down naming his child after any rock and rollers, which made Dean pout.
“No. I’m here.”
It didn’t take long for Castiel’s body to quiet.  He was comfortable, wrapped around Dean’s knot.  Dean’s scent was happy, and sleepy. Castiel couldn’t think of anything that smelled better.  He wrapped his arms around Dean and savored the warmth of his body, the tickle of his stubble, the fullness of his cock.
“I think I shouldn’t go into battle for some time.  My grace will need time to replenish.  Systaining my body may require the occasional meal, glass of water, and nap while I am depleted.  Dean, stay close.  It may help if you are near.  My grace is more at ease with you because of the bond.  It may heal more quickly while I’m in your company.”
“I uh-I guess you can.”
“Monsters.  Half angel, half human hybrids.”
“So you gonna help him with it?”
His tone was so earnest, that Dean could do nothing but stare at him.
Cas took Dean’s hands and Dean followed his lead.  Cas let go, but Dean whined and latched onto his back.  He buried his nose in the back of Cas’s neck, scenting him.  It was grounding.  He honed in on Cas’s voice.
Dean breathed.
Chicken. Dean was chicken
“You’re burning up.”
Dean watched Cas’s abdominal muscles flex and his calves bunch up.  The tug at his knot was maddening, but it told him that Cas was trying to push up into his hand.
It seemed Sam had to look after Jack for the time being. He’d already developed a bond with Jack in the womb.  Castiel had allowed Sam to ask as many questions as he wanted. Jack had even supplied some answers through Castiel.  They had asked Sam some of their own questions. They seemed hungry to know the world; eager to live.  They had sent Sam a burst of emotion that they felt for their family.  He’d felt Jack kick, listened to their human heart beat.  It hurt to see Dean withdraw from the child like this.  Cas had once confided in Sam that Dean was having some trouble forming a bond with Jack. Cas had been sure that, once Dean met Jack, Dean would bond with and love them. Sam understood why connecting was hard in this case. The Cas never got an ultrasound.  Dean never got to see Jack grow inside Cas other that Cas’s bump.  Cas insisted that Dean was empathetic.  He felt the full extent of human emotion.  Once Jack was born, Dean would love them.  Sam was not seeing evidence of that.  He’d need to talk to Dean. Sam would probably have to give Jack whatever love Dean couldn’t while Dean grieved.  Then it hit Sam that Cas was dead.  The wing prints outside weren’t from some other angel.  Those were Cas’s wings.  They would have to burn Cas.  Tears pricked at the corners of Sam’s eyes as he rummaged through their cereal stash.  Jack waited dutifully, too close to his elbow.  When he came up with Crunch Cookie Crunch and Cheerios, he resolved to mix them. Jack’s face upon trying the cereal was like a light turning on.
Dean chuckled.
Dean hid his eyes in the back of Cas’s shoulder.
“How?”
“More.”
“Either is fine, but a little rubbing is faster, which is what we need.”
The Nephilim’s voice was clear and authoritative, yet still uncertain. Sam’s stomach lurched.
Dean stood and unbuckled his belt, letting his pants puddle on the floor.
“Don’t scare me like that Cas…”
“That’s good Dean.  Let me take care of you.”
Kiss Kiss.
“I’m just gonna…”
Dean grumbled.
“I’ve got to hit the head.  Don’t go anywhere.”
Dean inhaled, Cas’s scent centered his racing mind.  Cas’s toes were rubbing along the tops of his.  It was actually really sweet.
“Right. Sorry.  Gotta get used to that.  So your name is Jack?”
“Don’t be.”
“I’m a fan of snuggling as much as the next person, but the ritual isn’t over.”
“It's gonna be a tight fit.”
Dean’s erection had flagged dramatically.
“Not that I object Dean, but you’ve already…”
“Humans cannot survive the birth of a nephilim.  The sheer power entering the world is too much.  I should be fine.  I may be weakened, but it will not kill me.  Even if I became human tomorrow and their birth was no longer something that I could survive, I would still go through with it.”
“You can bite me…  I want you to...”
“What? No.”
“You were dead…  As good as dead and I was gone…  Shit…”
Castiel growled.  Dean whined and rolled his hips.  He set a luxurious pace, whining helplessly.  Castiel was breathless.  The pads of his fingers stroked Dean’s cheekbones. Dean’s eyes were wet, but he never looked away, continuing the sinuous roll of his hips.  A few tears fell onto Castiel’s face. They tasted salty.  Castiel cherished them.  He watched Dean’s pupils open wide with arousal.  One of Dean’s hands held Castiel’s hip while the other wondered.  It ran up his abs, pinched at his nipples, and closed around his throat for a moment of pressure.  Then it traveled back down to massage Castiel’s balls.  They felt warm and secure when Dean cupped them in his palm.  Dean grinned a little shyly before taking Cas’s dick in his hand. Castiel blinked, but did not look away from Dean’s face.  Dean’s hand was rough and too dry, but it belonged to Dean. He welcomed the pleasure-pain.  He tilted his hips to meet Dean’s.  Dean’s hips stuttered.
Was all he wanted to say.  Cas rose up again and then pushed back down.  He allowed himself to cry out.  The cry this time was of pleasure. Dean watched him with both hands braced on his hips.  He had a musing, wonderous expression on his face and his eyes were shiny.  When Castiel ground down for a second time, Dean moaned low in his throat.  Castiel fell forward nipping at his stubbled chin, licking at his nipples, scent marking Dean wherever he could.  Dean was entirely receptiv and pliant to Castiel’s whims.  He sucked in air through his teeth when Cas  attached himself to his nipples and tilted his head when Cas wanted at his neck and chin.  Castiel worked him thoroughly.
“The Nephilim.  It seems that you were right.  We were responsible for its creation.  I died, but the child healed me.”
“Then sleep again.”
“What?”
“Hello.”
“Get some slick. Ease the way.  You can do it.”
“That’s good Cas…  You look really good like that… Fuck yes…”
“Helping.”
Dean was embarrassed by the whining sound he made.  His tongue pushed through Dean’s clenching channel easily.  Cas’s mouth was so strong.  Dean reached down blindly and wound his fingers into Cas’s thick hair.  He tugged gently, leading Cas away from his hole.  Cas followed his lead, but continued to suckle and lick the skin around the entrance.  Dean whined and tugged again.
“Hello Dean…”
“Dean! Are you even paying attention?”
Dean smelled another wave of Cas’s heat.  It was at a low simmer, but soon, Cas would be a begging wreck again.  Dean was glad that he was already hard from having Cas’s cock in his mouth, from hearing Cas as he came.  He was already excited.
“And Dean…  I love you too.”
He could feel Cas’s hand smooth over his back as he removed his socks.
“Cas…  I’m ticked yeah… But when I did this as a living back in the day…  Lets just say none of my clients need it as often as you do.  As soon as my knot goes down, your body starts freaking out.  I don’t want you boiling in your skin because you’re my friend and friends don’t knot each other.  I’ve had to be more than one omega’s ride to the ER. We can’t do that with you, but…  I can give you some relief...”
“Quit moving.  I can’t get the thumb in if you keep wiggling.”
“Dean…  please...”
The two of them jumped.  Castiel had almost forgotten Sam was there.
“Jesus Cas…”
“That’s better…”
“You shoulda thought of that before you did it.”
“Wow.”
“I performed the first part of the ritual on Dean’s soul.  It was a bonding ritual, meant for angels.  His soul was far too injured to be inside his body.  I had to use a strand of my grace to hold him together.”
Dean blinked a couple of times.  Sam cleared his throat.
When Dean was dressed, he ran into Sam in the hall.
Dean chuckled and blushed.
“Those won’t work Dean.”
“Dean, you’re alive?”
That first time, when Dean had surprised him by pinning him down and snarling at him.  Castiel could have thrown him off if he had wanted to, but he sensed Dean’s pain.  Dean was clingy and wide eyed and tearful.  Dean snuggled in closer to Castiel that he normally would. Dean tended to pout and tell Castiel how he didn’t cuddle.  Castiel was happy to let Dean hold him as long as he needed.  Dean really seemed to need to touch him.  Even after his knot went down, he would press close and wind his arms around Cas, pulling him close.  Castiel was not sure that Dean knew what he was saying out loud.  Half way through the first day, Dean had gazed up at him with naked eyes and told him he loved him.  Frankly, it was more than Castiel could hope for.  Castiel had simply kissed him and they had napped together.  Once the rut wound down, Dean had declared that he needed to get different suppressants and a cheeseburger ASAP.
Dean stood up and noticed that the bites had not healed.  His eyes stayed on them as he reached over to shut the water off.
Something flashed across Dean’s face.
“You're such a freak…”
Dean was breathless.  Cas had the best voice for dirty talk.
He could smell the hurt come pouring off of Dean.
“I’ll help.”
“And you knotted-”
“God Cas, how are you this hot?”
Apparently, Crowley had broken the Lance of Michael.  The Winchesters understood that it was he who saved Castiel.  Cas intended to set that straight. He didn’t get much of a chance. Dean practically pounced on him when they got to the bunker.  His mouth was insistent and hungry.  He acted as if he may die if Castiel did not kiss him right this second.  Castiel was happy to let Dean nip, kiss, and lick into his mouth as much as he needed.
Dean nipped at his earlobe.  Cas’s breath hitched.
Sam chuckled.  It was good to hear him laugh.  Cas insisted that Sam needn’t do that.  He had found his own food as a human.  Sam and Dean both shot him down.
Sam stopped mid way up the stairs.
“And I told them that humans did not like it when we went through their memories.  They may have thought sending a vision was something different.  I will explain.”
Dean tackled Cas to the mattress, disgusted to find that Cas was only wearing his robe.  He pulled it open and yanked it aside before plunging in.  His teeth found Cas’s neck and locked onto it.
“Lie on your back.”
Castiel was actually kneeling down and washing his thighs.  It was weird and wonderful and if they just hadn’t spent hours satiating a heat, Dean’s dick would have kind of enjoyed it too.
“No bible names.”
Cas buried his face in the space between Dean’s ear and shoulder.  It made him giggle.
Cas purred in response.  Dean was in love with that sound.
“I’ve always loved watching, but I wanted to do more than watch this time...  Wanted to know what you taste like...”
Sam was making one of those ‘don’t talk about your weird cowboy fettish in front of me’ faces.
Cas was silent.
Castiel watched as Dean’s ears and neck turned pink and he made grumbling sounds.  Then Dean looked up with a gaze that was almost pleading.
“You gotta come see this.”
“Hm?  Oh…”
Dean’s voice sounded deep in his own ears.  The rational part of his mind knew that he didn’t normally act like this, not even during his medicated ruts.  Something was wrong. The alarm bells were going off, but his animal instincts were louder.  They told him to mate Cas.  Mark him up.  Make it so good, that he won’t want to leave ever again.  Make him stay in Dean’s nest.  He took Cas by the hand and led him to Dean’s room.  Cas encouraged him with whispered praise.  He told Dean that he was doing a good job, that Dean shouldn’t worry, because Cas would take care of him.  Dean slammed the door with his foot and firmly planted his nose into Cas’s scent gland.
“Don’t talk about Sam while I’m inside you.”
Dean swallowed back a groan.  Cas had the best voice for sexy moaning.  His name sounded perfect coming out of Cas’s mouth like that.  He was breathing hard and the wet sounds his fingers made as he pumped them were making him all hot.  He was sure that Cas could smell how aroused he was.
“I had come to terms that happiness was not in the having for me.”
Castiel hummed. Dean’s lips were pillowy and plush.  Castiel enjoyed learning the cellular structure of Dean’s mouth.  Tasting him down to the molecules. Communicating without words that Castiel loved him.
“Come sit here.  Let me take care of you.”
“Oh for crying out loud…”
“Mm-hm…”
“Jack-”
Cas professed with such sincerity, that Dean felt a flutter in his stomach. Dean inhaled Castiel’s scent feeling home and family and love wash over him.
“I believe the wording is ‘an act of love.’”
“Please Dean…  I just need…  A little more…”
Dean stated before lying down on his back.  He closed his eyes and breathed in deeply as he situated something around his rather large erection.  Castiel glared at the rubber thing around Dean’s penis as if it had called him a series of rude names.  Dean cleared his throat.
Sam gave him a friendly pat on the back.
“You don’t have to say it…”
Dean’s face burst into a wide smile.
Dean made a sweet rumble in his chest and made Castiel into his mattress. Castiel pulled the blankets over him and ran gentle hands over his back.  Dean really was beautiful when he slept.  He slept so little.  Castiel wanted to savor this.  Maybe, if he was lucky, Dean would let Castiel touch him in his sleep again.  Maybe someday they would touch each other again.  They would kiss and hold each other.  Maybe Dean would let him put his penis in his mouth. Castiel was allowed to think about it.  He didn’t think it likely, however.
He began to scrub Dean’s back in a dreamy sort of way.
“I don’t get it, but okay. I’m just trying to figure names out, you know?”
“You're staying right?”
Cas hummed contentedly, stretching sinuously.
“It's alright.”
“At least I don’t have to worry about molesting you then…”
“Please…”
Dean blinked.  His mouth was very dry.
“Don’t be.”
He grumbled.  Cas made a face that made it clear that his love for humanity did not exceed his tolerance for bullshit.
Dean didn’t want to admit that his big puppy dog of a brother was right.  Cas had been so wide eyed and insistent.   Then he had been all ‘oh Dean, you are right.  I am terrible.  I shall go pout now.  Have good dreams while you sleep alone. I hate myself.’
As charming as Sam and Dean usually were, Castiel was beginning to feel a little light headed.  He knelt beside the jug of holy oil and raised an eyebrow.  Dean knelt beside him and held out a hand. Castiel wordlessly poured a small amount into Dean’s palm before shrugging off his coat and blazer.  He fumbled with the buttons of his shirt, before stripping out of it.  He wordlessly allowed Dean to paint the enochian bonding sigil over his chest in holy oil, something that could really hurt him if it caught on fire. He took care as he did the same for Dean.  The warmth of Dean’s skin and the slide of the oil made him feel pleasantly tingly.  The lightheadedness doubled when Dean read out the bonding words.  They made his heart ache.  If Dean knew what they meant, he would never read them to him.  They were words that Castiel knew he, himself meant down to the core.  But Dean saw him as a friend.  Moreover, Dean was much more hung up on the physical things like gender presentation.  Frankly, Castiel would love Dean if Dean were four feet tall with no genitals and purple skin.  Castiel was glad that Dean’s body looked the way it did.  It suited him.
Dean laughed breathlessly.
Cas nodded, so Dean ran to the bathroom in his bathrobe and bare feet.  Sam could shut his mouth.  Dean really really had to pee.
The hollow Cas-thing had him by the collar.  It was going to stab him.
“I tried to take the edge off…  It hurts…  I…  I’m sorry…   This must be awkward...”
Dean huffed.  Castiel twitched and the two of them made eye contact.
“I like the name Julien.”
“You like it?”
“No…  I’m unwell…”
Dean was still dripping wet and as naked as the day he was born. He made his way around Cas and kissed the bites one at a time.  It was weirdly intimate, having Cas just bare the back of his neck to him like that.  Cas sighed.  Cas abruptly walked away, leaving Dean naked, dripping, and blinking.  He reappeared with Dean’s robe and draped it over him.  Then it was Cas’s turn to kiss him.  There was nothing insistent or urgant about it, but it felt right.  It felt like coming home.  Dean thought that maybe bonded pairs kissed this way after they had been together for a long time.  He and Cas had kinda been this way for a while hadn’t they?
“So are you saying like the princess kissing the frog?”
Dean pulled back and ran his other hand over Cas’s thigh.  Cas let out a chuckle.
“I think we may have scent bonded at some point.  Not on purpose…  We do share a profound bond…”
Dean picked up speed again.
Dean smiled in a way that suggested that he was surprised, pleased, and affectionate.  He took Cas’s Cock in his hand and kissed his neck.  Castiel surprised at first, but then he dissolved into a whimpering mess.  Dean swallowed his cry as he came all over his chest and stomach.  Castiel kissed Dean.  Kissing was something he knew well. He wished to show Dean that he appreciated and loved him.  Cas hadn’t really been planning on getting off.  He had just been really enjoying watching Dean enjoy himself.  He kissed and licked his way down, cleaning his come up off of Dean.  Dean had done that to him before.  It had felt very nice.  Castiel wanted Dean to feel nice things.  Dean watched him through his lashes.  He hissed when Castiel licked up the cum that was still all over his cock.  Dean’s eyes went wide and he yanked Castiel up by the hair.  Castiel went.  Dean wanted another kiss. Something sweet and chaste this time. Castiel was just starting to get a rhythm on what to do when Dean climbed on top of him.
Dean grumbled but laced Cas’s fingers with his.
“I'm not in heat.”
Castiel knew that Dean would be hard pressed to say anything like that out loud.  Castiel himself had been pressing gentle sentiments of love and devotion.  Dean helped him back into bed.  Castiel was speechless.  Dean was so good.  Castiel felt raw and a little sore, but it was right.  He pulled Dean down until Dean let himself be kissed, coming away breathless.  Dean was smiling down at him, in disbelief.
Sam tucked his hair behind his ears.
“Okay guys, don’t you guys have any ideas?”
“Oh thank you…”
“It isn’t a big deal Dean.  They do it alot these days.”
“So, this is all just in case right?  Just knock if you need to come in and we’ll open the ward for you.”
“I love you.  I love you both.  You are my family.  You need to keep fighting.  I’ll hold Ramiel off for a while.”
“Cas, you smell different.  Why do you smell different?”
“Cas are you hearing me?”
Cas stopped moving, but he was still tense. Dean stroked him at a relaxed pace.  Cas made a frustrated sound in his throat.
“Sam is getting you the rest of what you need.  It isn’t ideal, but you’ll feel a whole lot better.  How you feeling?”
“You come?”
“My room.”
“These beings have the power to do everything that angels can do, but they feel the way humans do.  They have hormones and mood swings and tantrums like humans, but with angelic power to back their whims…”
“I like it here.  It's like he’s here.”
By the time Dean got back, Cas’s eyes were flickering with bright white light and he had burned through his sweat.  It burned to touch him, but Dean did it anyway.  He ran to Cas, calling his name.  Cas turned his head, but made no other reply.  Dean frantically undressed and pressed himself down against Cas, grimacing at the burns.  He parted Cas’s legs, in order to get closer.
“I’ll just…  Yeah…”
“Thank you Dean…  That is so much better… Your scent is so nice…  Rest now…”
Cas stood up and crossed his arms.
Dean wondered why that was his only issue here.  He did not want to talk about this.  Not when his knot was so warm inside of Cas.  Not while he felt safe with Cas winding his fingers through his hair like that.
“I’ve never been with a male human before.  I’ve also never been with someone I care for.”
“Okay.  I’m gonna make an executive decision and say I’m topping.  You're hurting.  Just lie there and tell me if anything feels off to you.”
“I don’t know if this’ll help or not.”
“What are the other parts Cas?”
“Romantic.”
Castiel had wandered into Dean’s room.  Dean’s stomach clenched again.  If Cas were a normal human omega, then he would be able to get through a heat on his own.  Mated omegas had an easier time of it when their mates were there to help.  Under the heat smell, Dean could detect Cas’s other emotions.  He had been incredibly sad.  Dean could smell his tears and the bitter hint of physical pain.  Confusion was woven through all of that like fine thread. Confusion and distress.
Sam left the two of them sitting on Cas’s bed with Dean holding Cas’s bleeding arm.  Cas told him that he didn’t have to do this.  Dean knew that, if he could save Cas, that he did have to.
“Please…”
Dean did as he was told and sighed  as the pressure on his cock eased somewhat.  When he looked up, Cas was in his space, squinting at him.  Cas tore his shirt open, effectively ruining it.  Dean’s breath caught in his chest.  Cas was so hot.  Dean allowed his hands to wander over his chest and belly.  He liked the feel of the stretched skin.  He’d put a baby in there without even trying.  Dean was awesome.
“Dean, I wanted to talk to you while I am of sound mind.  Please do not come in while we are talking.  I am not sure what I may do.”
Dean snorted.
“Jack means God is Gracious and it tends to be used as a nickname for people named John.  We could actually consider it a family name.  They could even change their preference to: Jay or Jackie or something later if they want.”
Dean had watched a lot of porn.  He knew that some of those Alphas could supposedly knot on command.  He’d thought the whole thing was pretty hot.  There were whole websites dedicated to submissive Alphas.  He’d never been sure that they could actually pop a knot on command.  He wasn’t sure anyone could until Cas told him to.  His body responded without question.  Blood rushed dizzyingly down to his knot and Cas took it, made it his.
“No.”
Kiss.
Cas maintained eye contact as Dean backed out of his own room.  The corner of Cas’s mouth was wrinkled up.  The corners of his baby blues crinkled and he was all doh eyed.  His body was lax and he looked comfortable in Dean’s bed.  Dean’s knot throbed.
“Hm?”
“The fake knot…  There should be a place to twist it open...”
Dean frowned deeply. Sam shrugged. He figured he needed to change the subject
Dean set the beer down and gave Jack a stern look.
Dean felt that weird swoop in his stomach.  That stupid ache in his chest.
Uriel, the dickless wonder, appearing and saying.
‘It's dangerous out here.  That you have to suffer isn’t fair.’
“Here you go.  It's cereal. You mix it with milk and eat it with a spoon.  The cookie one really isn’t good for you.”
“Hm?”
Castiel whispered to the brothers.
Dean climbed up his body, he pressed his full weight down on Cas and kissed him.  It was like Dean was trying to learn his mouth.  Like he was trying to memorize it.   Castiel went pliant, allowing his legs to open and letting Dean’s warm, human weight press him into the memory foam. He touched Dean’s face, his hair, his shoulders.  Dean hissed and pulled back.  Castiel let go of him.
“Feels so hot and wet and tight inside… Want you to know what this feels like…  Bet you'd like that…”
Sam coughed and aggressively rubbed his face.  Dean couldn’t think about numbers and dates.  It was really hard to focus.
Dean thrust upward with his hips.  A little choking was fine here and there, but gagging made him feel gross.
“Sam wanted to check on you.  I wanted to make sure that he made you a kit like you made me for my heat.”
Dean placed a hand to Castiel’s forehead.  It was a balm to the heat that was slowly cooking him.  Then Dean was gone.  Cas was not fully aware of the unhappy noise he had made until Dean laughed and told him not to worry in a gentle voice.
“Dean…  You don’t mean…”
No damage…  good…
“That's all the knot I got…  What else do you need?  I wanna help you man…”
“I sense his presence.  Go, call Crowley.  I’ll-”
Dean insisted.  Cas gave him sad eyes.  He Cas gave him sad eyes.  When Cas gave him sad eyes, it was usually his fault.
The first time Cas had ever lied to Dean.  It had spiraled out of control.  Dean had felt so sick about it because Sam and Bobby could see through it.  Why couldn’t Dean.  Then they had caught him and he had looked so small.
“Damn…”
Sam said nothing.  He just patted Cas’s arm.
“Cas, Dean, he’s going to need a knot to help him through his first heat.  Unless you want me to drive forty five minutes to the nearest store, we don’t have any knots just lying around.”
All Out of Love - Air Supply
“Just like that…”
“Pretty cock…”
“Take my hand.”
“Cas?”
Sam asked as he crossed his arms and leaned forward.
“If there is a nephilim here, which there isn’t, I should be minimally affected.  The nephilim grow their own vessel.  That humanity should, in theory, trick angel wards.  I suppose it may sting, but that is all.”
“How long have you known?”
“I’ll hold you down if you want, but I know you're stronger than me.  If you wanna…”
“You are going to put the fake knot inside of you.  Go slow.  Don’t force it.”
“That doesn’t make it ours Dean.”
“You felt it right?  I felt yours.  When I touched your grace?  You know I uh…  That I love you too Cas.  You know that right?”
“Yes.”
“Kay, let's stop talking about our kid watching.  It's giving me whiskey dick over here.”
“I thought that you told Damien not to mind meld any more.”
It took a moment for Sam to coax the spooked nephilim back to the bunker.
“Guys.”
“The enochian, from the ritual. You were super fixated on it.  What was I saying?”
Cas compiled without speaking.
Dean’s tone changed.
Dean let out an explosive sigh.  Castiel’s hands shook as he took the paper from Dean and read from it.  He did his best to pour himself into the words, to let Dean know he meant them.
“Sex magic is very powerful Dean.”
Castiel wanted to tell Dean about the child, their child.  He wanted Dean to know how good and bright and righteous they were.  He wanted Dean to know.
Dean rubbed his forehead as he replaced the coffee pot.
“Our child is a They/Them Dean.”
Dean ducked his head, a blush visible on his cheeks.  He cleared his throat.
“I have some here.”
“I’m touching you.  Why wouldn’t I like it?”
Dean licked his lips.
That was how the three of them picked Jack’s name.  Sam even chimed in later, telling them that it was some people’s nickname for John, which made it a family name.  Jack seemed interested in the concept of a ‘family name.’  Castiel was always answering questions.  Jack was a bright inquisitive child.  He was starting to get impatient for the brothers to formally meet them.
“He’s my friend too.  Also, let's be real, you two have been making googly eyes at each other for years.”
Cas sighed heavily.
Dean’t face heated up again and he hid it in the back of Cas’s neck.  His scent was dense there.  Dean gulped it in greedily.
Dean couldn’t quite shake the image of Cas begging for one.  What would it sound like if Cas said that word?  Noooope…  Sam gave him a withering look
“Father?”
He felt cold and was getting a bit dizzy.  He had to blink to see clearly.   That wasn’t good.  Castiel could feel their grace, the Nephilim’s.  They were confused and alarmed.  An infection flooded his veins.
Cas sighed, smiling into his skin.  Dean's heart ached.  He knew Cas loved him, felt it in his grace.  It felt different hearing it, like a flood gate was open and Cas was free.  Cas was kissing him all over the face.
“What?”
Jack squinted in that way that made Sam’s chest constrict.  They must have picked that one up from Cas.
Cas prattling on about animal testing and bumble bees while he wore scrubs from the mental hospital.  He had taken Sam’s burden onto himself.  He had given Dean a wide eyed, glassy look and claimed that he was ‘cursed.’  The Winchesters should not want him around.  Dean’s throat tightened.  He remembered what he had said next.
“You're so lovely…”
It wasn’t a question.  Dean stayed quiet.
“Cas…  Seriously, should we ward the place, just in case?  If you felt it, that means the other angels did too right?  I mean, just on the off chance.”
Dean and Sam raided the medical supply closet and the cupboards for aspirin, water, and snacks. They weren't even sure if Cas would need them.  Being around his brother was nice.  It kept him busy.  He couldn’t get too excited with Sam smell up his nose.
“I thought I was staying in here.”
Dean found himself smiling.  He huffed.
Cas took the hint and crawled up Dean’s back, toward his face.  Cas stopped now and then to give Dean’s neck some attention, or nibble his ear.  His cock pressed cheerfully against the cleft of Dean’s ass  Dean was achingly hard, but Cas seemed to be only semi hard.  His body temperature didn’t burn like it had before.  Cas covered him with his own body, pressing him down into the mattress as he sucked at Dean’s scent gland.  Dean thought, again, of how nice it would be to have Cas fuck him just like this.  Cas pulled back from his neck with shiny eyes.  With one hand, he rolled Dean onto his back.  Dean yelped, causing his face and neck to burn with embarrassment.  Then Cas was kissing him, hard, on the mouth, so that was okay.  The kiss stole his breath.  It was messy and unpracticed.  Cas’s mouth tasted like his own ass.  He hadn’t thought that that would be a turn on for him.  As it turned out, it was.  Dean clung to Cas’s shoulders, licking the taste of himself out of Cas’s mouth until it was gone.  Cas nipped at his lips, growling.  Cas’s heat still hadn’t flared back up.
“I’d rather have you, Cursed or not.”
Dean scratched the back of his neck, looking sweet and bashful.
“Like I said…  What?”
Castiel told Dean that he needed to be mated.  Dean was his mate.  His body needed Dean to completely mate him. Dean had not finished the job yet.
Dean wished his knot would go down faster, so he could get away from Cas.  Cas had this thing that could just, meld with your mind.
Dean was a sexual giver.  He enjoyed pleasing others, but right now, all he wanted was Cas’s cock in his mouth.
“Dean…  More…”
“Shut up.”
“Where is Jack?!”
“I’m sorry.”
“Go ahead Dean…  This feels like a sweet dream...”
Cas pulled Dean back down so that he could scent his neck and purred.
When he returned from his mission, he had to go to Heaven’s medics immediately.  What he’d had to do in order to hold the Dean’s soul, patch it up, and return it to its body had hurt him deeply.  He still felt the ache sometimes, deep in his grace, when he was with Dean Winchester.  The thing that Castiel had had to do was trigger magic from an ancient Enochian mating ritual.  Dean’s soul had been horribly damaged.  To return it to his body now would break him.  The ritual was quite simple, Castiel would amputate a part of his grace and leave it in Dean’s care.  This would act as stitches for Dean’s soul.  Dean would then leave a shard of his fractured soul with Castiel.  Castiel never thought to take any of it for himself.  Dean’s soul must be whole.  He knew this instinctively as soon as he wrapped himself around the thrashing thing.  It was too good, too righteous, for him to keep a piece of it without Dean’s express consent.  The magic surrounding the ritual dictates that the ritual must be completed.  If not, the incomplete partner shall suffer. Castiel didn’t know the specifics on what that meant, but upon his return to heaven, medics had been dispatched in order to repair his wounded grace and hopefully perform some sort of meracle. His grace contorted and bled on the floor of heaven’s medical offices. He had come close to death more than once since his arrival.   The medical officers hadn’t thought that he would have the strength to fly away, to contact Dean.  His whole being needed to be near him.  It needed to be near his soul. He didn’t want to complete the ritual.  There Dean was too fragile and precious for that.  Not to mention, heaven did not want him forming emotional bonds. He just wanted Dean to know that he was Castiel.  They had met in hell.  Castiel had pulled him from perdition.  Castiel literally held his soul together now as it healed.  He had hoped that maybe Dean, as a vessel, would be able to hear him, see him… When Dean had screamed and covered his ears, Castiel had let himself drift back to heaven.  His grace hemorrhaging out on the floor once again.
Castiel was listening, but only by half.  He was much more interested in alleviating his heat by riding Dean like a pony.  Dean loved the animal intensity of it mixed with Cas’s tenderness.  Cas’s hands and lips would latch on and kneed but also caress and nibble sweetly.  One of Cas’s hands had grabbed hold of Dean’s shoulder for leverage while the other hand swiped up and down his chest like he was petting Dean’s beating heart or something sappy like that.  When Cas began to feel the swelling of Dean’s knot, he picked up the pace.  Dean wasn’t sure he had ever been ridden so hard.  Cas was thorough in the way he claimed his pleasure from Dean.  He had a hand around Dean’s neck, just to have something to hold onto.  Dean knew that Cas could snap it in less than a second if he wanted to.  He also found that he didn’t care that much.  Cas wouldn’t hurt him.  The trust was so freeing.  On the next downward thrust, his knot popped and Cas came.  Cas collapsed on top of him, shaking in relief and pleasure. The hard muscle spasms were too much, and Dean came.  He was surprised that he had lasted that long to be honest. Cas’s chest vibrated as he purred, his face pressed up to Dean’s scent gland.  Dean could feel him smiling against his neck. Dean was feeling drowsy from his recent orgasm.  He knew that falling asleep in the nest together would be a mistake.  He had not actually meant to knot Cas.  He had merely meant to fuck him and hold his knot outside of Cas’s body, but then Cas had gone and been spectacularly hot and dominant.  Dean had gone all pliable for him like a damn ragdoll.  His knot couldn’t wait to be inside Cas, who was Dean kidding.  Now they had to wait until it went down.  Damn, it felt nice and snug and safe inside of Cas.
“Hey, What did it mean?”
Cas sounded like he was explaining something to a small child.
“You stay away from my family!”
“Dude, your eyes are gold…”
Castiel’s grace trembled.  He faltered.
Dean sat down next to him, taking the hand without thinking. The wound reminded him of the times they cut themselves to perform rituals.  Cas let out a little sigh.
He waited at the door and let Cas in.  If he squinted, and looked at Cas really hard, he could see where their kid was growing, stretching Cas out like he had swallowed a melon.  It made Dean’s cheeks all hot and he rubbed his neck.
Dean forgot that he didn’t cuddle and let a very vulnerable looking Cas cling to him.  Cas was making this humming sound.  They were both shaking and Cas’s eyes were wet.   Dean had to kiss him.  What else was there for it?  He’d felt Cas, down to his grace.  It had been pretty scary, but Cas loved him.  He was purely devoted, utterly lost, and it made sense.  Maybe Dean hadn’t seen it before because he didn’t want to.  Maybe he had seen it, but was too chickenshit to admit that he knew what it was.  A lot of stuff Cas said and did were making even more sense now.  Cas had thrown his family away, given up an army, and cured Dean from being a demon with Sam.  Cas had been about to kill him, but his declarations of need had been enough to bring Cas out of the trance.  Dean had been about to confess his love.  If Cas really did kill him, then he didn’t want anything left unsaid.  Dean had choked and said “need” instead, which had been enough.  Not to mention the way Cas looked at him, like he saw someone worth living for.  His eyes said; you are worth my time, you're worth everything I do for you, and so much more.  The ‘I love you you silly human’ was there too, but Dean had chalked it up to Cas being Cas.  Cas was a weird, dorky guy.  How was Dean supposed to know what he was thinking?  The problem with that was that Dean could read Cas.  Cas wasn’t when compared to humans, but he had a subtle way of holding his weight, moving his shoulders, using his eyes to talk without saying anything.  Dean knew exactly what Cas was telling him through long, heated glances, and just swallowed it with bottle after bottle of booze. Dean hadn’t wanted Cas to return his affection, because that meant losing more if he lost Cas.  Dean loved the feathery bastard.  His soul had probably been all over Cas.  How embarrassing.
“This injury is to my grace, not my vessel.  Moreover, it was inflicted in the midst of a ritual that was not finished.  Finishing the ritual would, in effect, staunch the bleeding.”
There was a beat in which Sam stared at Dean expectantly.
“Um…”
Dean asked a blissed out looking Cas as he dried him with a fresh towel.
“Of course.”
“Cas?”
“If I thought I could make it go away on my own…  I would…”
Dean asked, shyly, through golden lashes, if Cas would please stay.
Dean kept having to check that Cas was still there.  Somewhere inside, he was still worried that Cas would disappear.  That perhaps he would fly away or tell Dean that he had to leave and abandon him.  Cas did not leave him.  He sat where Dean set his plate and silverware.  He even wound his foot around Dean’s bear ankle.  Dean honed in on that feeling.  He didn’t want to take it for granted, in case Cas had to go.
Dean could see why Cas, who could really be a big girl sometimes, had gotten all choked up about that.  It did seem pretty angelic.  The whole ‘I consent’ thing with shining beacons.  Still, it was nice.
Dean could hear Sam typing away on his keyboard
“It should have some alpha pheromones in it. They come in little packets.”
His voice was hoarse from sleep.  He sounded fucked out.  There was some truth to that.
Dean grazed Cas’s ear with his teeth.  Cas stayed very still.
When Dean heard him, he came inside quickly and closed the door.  He made Castiel take more useless aspirin and drink more pointless water.
Dean hadn’t had a real rut since he had gotten on the really heavy suppressants at maybe twenty.  He’d have a day or two in the winter time when he just needed to have as much sex as possible, or he felt like he was going to go insane.  Dad had learned from his mistake with Dean and gotten Sam on the same Alpha suppressants just as soon as Sam popped his first knot. It wouldn’t do to have his Alpha boys going into a rut in the middle of a hunt.  They would be unable to think.  John Winchester needed clear headed warriors.  Dean straight up forgot his rut always happened right around this time every year.  He’d just been talking to Sam and Cas about some case, but all he could think about was how he wasn’t touching Cas and how screwed up that was.  Cas was right there; with his stupid deep voise and bed head and thick pregnant scent.  Dean ended up standing right in his space, kind of just, bumping shoulders with him.  Sam was explaining some of the crime scene details and handing Cas the photos.  Dean pretended to lean over and look at them, but all he was doing was scenting Cas.  He couldn’t seem to get enough.  His instincts were yelping for more, please more!”
Cas’s scent was helping clear his head and ease his anxiety.  He all but had Cas pinned to the mattress so that he couldn’t leave.  Dean shifted his weight a little and helped Cas plant his knees.  He didn’t want to squish the baby.  Dean drove in in long, slow strokes, determined to make it so good, that Cas wouldn’t want to leave him again.   Cas kept telling him that he had him, that it was alright.  Then he’d sigh and his back would arch.  Dean bit him over and over again to reassure himself that Cas was mated to him.  When his knot finally popped, he purred into Cas’s ear and gave him a luxurious hand job.  He really took his time, kissing his neck and whispering sweet nothings into his ear.  Dean must have been really out of it.  He wasn’t sure what he said.  Cas seemed to get off on the dirty talk, because he hissed and leaked a small amount of cum into Dean’s hand.  Dean nibbled behind his ear, enjoying the bonding hormones.  The two of them lie there panting for a moment before Cas started to talk.  Cas was always talking.
Cas gave him the sad eyes again.
Castiel watched as Dean shoved a pillow under his hips.  Dean rose to his knees, looking picturesque.  Dean locked eyes with Castiel and his cock brushed Cas’s hole.  It was then that Castiel realised that Dean’t cock was naked.  Before Castiel could think too long, or react, Dean was pushing inside.  Dean held eye contact as he bottomed out.  They both groaned at the feel of it.  Castiel couldn’t believe how much better this was.  It was amazing how Dean was mixing with him so deeply and completely.  He looked into Dean’s eyes.  It was satisfying to see that Dean was struggling not to roll his eyes back.  Dean stayed like that for a while. Panting and letting the occasional keen slip out.  Castiel found himself grinning.  He was perfect.
“Cas?”
Dean answered the phone he whispered.  Cas pressed closer, sighing.
“Dean…”
“What are you-?”
“Good.  I was worried I’d break you, just like I break everything else.”
“If it's painful, Cas.  It's not really supposed to hurt your asshole, okay?  It's only supposed to burn in the beginning when I stretch your muscles out.”
“Aw you just like having me around, you big softy.”
“Everything you are angry at yourself for, everything you have ever felt guilty about, I have already forgiven.”
Sam’s face faded into a thoughtful blank.
“I mean, that is how team Winchester does things isn’t it?  Hide the facts we find inconvenient and hope they go away?  Cas is part of the family.  The behaviour makes sense.”
“Hey…  Thats all I got…”
Dean heard a rustling sound, and a long muffled groan.  Cas panted heavily.
Jack sagged.  They had felt like they were bonding with Dean.  His thoughts had not been quite so black and stormy.  Even while they had been living inside of Castiel, Dean had seemed to have a hard time connecting with Jack.  Every time Jack had reached out to him, hoping to learn and know him better, Dean had become alarmed.  Dean had become distressed and pulled away from Castiel, cutting himself off from Jack.  Castiel told Jack that it was a human thing.  Humans don’t like having their memories looked at.  Humans don’t like it when you send them pulses of energy which they don’t understand.  Humans don’t seem to like much.  What do humans like?  Jack wanted to know so that they could do it.  For a moment, Jack had been hopeful.  They could figure it out.  They had time.  They would find another way.
“They don’t like that one.”
Cas just stared at him with big golden eyes and a vacant expression.
“Yes...  Every time we mated.”
Dean interrupted.  Castiel’s lips made a thin line.  The look on his face clearly communicated that Dean was lucky he was pregnant because Castiel was done with his nonsense.  Sam didn’t much like Cas’s plan either.
But Cas’s eyes were sparkling as he made to stand up.  Dean had to catch him as he stumbled.
“I don’t know much about human cycles, but I know enough to know that that isn’t healthy.  We’re probably going to be in here for a while if it has been that long since you had a proper rut.”
Emerging from this state was like coming back to life.  It was sharp, cold, and disorienting. His shoulders burned where Dean clutched him.  Dean was there. Tremors rolled through his frame.  He still had his face pressed into Castiel’s neck.  His eyes were wet.  Castiel could feel the heat in his own hands.  The hand he had not used to contact Dean’s soul had burned Dean’s skin.
Sam made a face at Dean.
Dean abruptly rolled them onto their sides, causing Cas to yelp in surprise
“Yeah…  I actually kinda enjoyed it…  You of all people know that I don’t like being woken up…  But I don’t know…  waking up like that wasn’t so bad?”
Dean whined in his throat and his knot popped at the thought.  Cas stroked his back through his orgasm.  He whimpered and bit down just a bit more so that his canines pierced skin. Dean immediately scented a change.  Cas purred with contentment.  His scent was filled with relief and mellow bonding hormones.  Dean would be lying if he said he hadn’t been anxious about those.  Now, he couldn’t imagine why.  He unlatched his jaw and buried his face down behind Cas’s ear, snuffling at the scent gland.  Cas seemed perfectly content to just hold him, to pet his hair, to intertwine his fingers with Dean’s, to kiss his knuckles.  Dean snuffed at Cas’s scent gland.  His head was cloudy from the bonding hormones and post orgasmic fatigue.
