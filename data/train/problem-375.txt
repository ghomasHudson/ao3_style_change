Sherlock sighed. “It does, but if you're the next target, the killer knows your movements. We need to know your routine, in detail, to prevent your murder.”
“Sherlock, check the kitchen cabinets for a vial of Versed, quickly!” John set the timer on his phone while Sherlock found the Versed. “Good, hold her head still as gently as possible. I’m going to try to get this into her.” He scanned the instructions on the vial and pulled the medication into the dropper. He slid it between her lips and teeth and forced the liquid into her mouth. John massaged her throat a few times, hoping to get the drug into her system. “All right, let go. Now we just have to wait,” he said, rolling Lio onto her side.
“You’ll end up killing her before she answers any more questions,” Sherlock said.
“When I was traveling, I was alone for most of it. I talked to you. We would have full conversations. Sometimes I would forget you weren't really there, but it didn't matter. Just having the ghost of you in my head was enough. I realized that I...needed you more than I let myself believe. Since my return and the whole thing with Moran, you've never once turned your back on me. Despite your initial anger, you've been there. I...don't know how to repay that loyalty. I want...”
John nodded. “No need to bother her with the noise. And Mycroft. We should visit Lio tomorrow afternoon, but after that, I would welcome a quiet night at home.”
“I have to make a small investment.” Sherlock-speak for bribing the homeless network. Once that was taken care of, they headed to Westminster to check out the crime scenes.
“Yeah, Sherlock, I'm here, safe, in London. So are you. Molly and Lestrade are here. We're in St Bart's, you know I don't like Bart's Sherlock.”
Lestrade cleared his throat. “Shall we go then, John?” He nodded grudgingly and the two left. Ms Monroe also excused herself to the loo and to gather up some of her things, leaving Mycroft and Sherlock alone.
John let out a slow breath. “I know. And I've forgiven you for jumping. I just hope you can forgive me for hating you.”
Sherlock didn't know how long they sat there before he felt John's heart rate slowly come down to a more normal level and his breathing was deep and regular. The storm, both of them, had passed.
“Perhaps you should take a hint.”
“No!” Sherlock ordered and pushed back. He still had an erection.
John looked at Sherlock to their hands and back to Sherlock. His eyes widened slightly. “Are-are we on a date?” Sherlock's mouth twitched, fighting off a smile and didn't answer, watching John process the information. “Oh. This is...this is great. That explains the candle then. Who would have thought, Sherlock Holmes on a date. You big softy,” John teased with a gentle smile, tightening his fingers around Sherlock's.
Sherlock sighed, and glared at Lestrade as if he were dealing with a child. “Reynolds is a big man, 225 pounds, 6 feet tall. Whoever moved him is also a man. Statistically speaking, men don't typically poison their victims. They use other methods.”
John frowned. They were on the roof across the street from the restaurant, having used Mycroft’s surveillance to track her here. Sherlock was scanning the area, watching for Lio’s contact, and John was keeping an eye on Lio herself, who was sitting on a bench in front of the restaurant. The two men were relatively inconspicuous against the darkening sky and they had enough cover on the rooftop to duck behind if necessary. They waited only a few minutes before Sherlock whapped John on the arm and pointed.
“You don’t believe in coincidences.”
“So he doesn't like Parliament; that was fairly obvious from the beginning. But why these four and what's the significance of the symbol?”
/*/*/*/
“Can you stop that?” he panted, hands on knees.
“Go ahead. Hurry back.” She darted away. “You hear that, Sherlock, John's on his way. He'll get you sorted.”
“Well, um, all the bodies had a mark. The same mark, but in different places. I took pictures, so they're in the file, but maybe you want to see them now?”
They arrived near Westminster Station in the late afternoon, and met up with one of the Network, a shaggy blonde boy that couldn't have been older than seventeen
“All of them? This same combination? Heroin, fentanyl, and 25I?” Sherlock's voice shook slightly.
/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/
“That was the plan.”
/*/*/*/*/*/*
“Something special!” one man exclaimed, far too close to his ear and Sherlock flinched away. There was laughter and a slamming door, then nothing.
“He'd be a younger man, late twenties or early thirties, and well built,” Sherlock added.
“Can I take them off? I miss being able to see your eyes.”
“I'm not doing anything I don't want to do. This is...
John woke to a body pressing him to the bed. He yawned and opened his eyes, but wasn't even able to close his mouth before Sherlock clamped his lips over it. Their tongues battled for a moment before John pushed him back by the shoulders.
John spread a few towels on the bed before Sherlock laid down. He covered Sherlock's body with his own, kissing down his jaw to his nipples and taking one into his mouth and sucking.
Sherlock did back off, but only just out of range.
She reached for him, ruthlessly pushing through the self-condemnation. “Now is your chance. Now we’re just Sergei and Lio. Now I won’t break. Now I’m
Suddenly their phones buzzed with a text from Lestrade: “Incoming”
John shrugged. “I don’t know; it just doesn’t seem like something you’d typically do. At least not for anyone but Sherlock,” he added hastily.
“Do calm down, John. For one thing, I don't threaten. For another, you know as well as I do that if this doesn't work, it will destroy you. Both of you.”
“We’ll have to at some point. Either that or wait for Mrs Hudson to come home so she can hose us down.”
At the very nice opening Sherlock gave him, John took the plunge, turning slightly pink as he spoke. “About that. How...experienced...are you? I know what Mycroft implied, but...”
“I'm sorry, I didn't mean to hurt you,” Sherlock said quickly.
“That would be great, yeah.”
John puttered around in the kitchen, making tea and toast. His nerves weren't going to allow him to eat anything heavier. He scrubbed a hand over his face. It was one thing to decide to take things as they came and quite another to put into practice. This was moving too fast. Well, if he thought about it, not really. They'd been living together for two years, and then Sherlock was away for another two and a half, and now they'd been together again for three months. It wasn't as if this was a whirlwind romance. Romance. Was he really going to start a romance with Sherlock?
Lio shook her head. “It’s fine. I get it. This comes back to haunt him and I’m the most sensible target. What’s going on?” she asked again.
“Just listen to my voice, Sherlock, and look around. You're safe. I'm safe. No one here is going to hurt you. Or me. This is St Bart's hospital in London. Why don't you let go of Greg's arm? He's our friend, he's not going to hurt you. We're safe.” He reached out slowly to run his fingers through the hair at the back of Sherlock's neck. “Easy, easy.”
John pinched the bridge of his nose between thumb and forefinger and sighed. “I don’t know what this makes me. I’m too old for a sexuality crisis. I’m trying not to worry about it right now.” His hand dropped. “And what about you?”
John shrugged and winced. “It’s only a few sore muscles. Nothing a little time and rest won’t take care of.”
“Lube, John, grab the lube,” Sherlock said, scissoring his fingers a bit as John twisted to the bedside drawer. He retrieved the bottle and tossed it to Sherlock. “You’re sure?” Sherlock asked, the playfulness from earlier replaced by seriousness.
Sherlock blinked several times and frowned deeply, trying to focus on John.
John met his glare. “Yes. You're a former addict--”
“Mmm,” was all Sherlock said. Menus, a bottle of wine, and a candle appeared moments later.
Sherlock flipped John onto his back, straddled him, lubed up his cock, and lowered himself onto it. Of course John was right and he wasn't stretched quite enough, but he didn't care. He barely let himself get acclimated before he began to rock, wincing slightly.
The door swung open and John jumped. “Good morning, gentlemen. Well, you're not dead so there's no reason for you to be ignoring my calls, Sherlock.”
Sergei was never particularly subtle about his affection for her, but due to their line of work and her position as his superior officer, nothing ever came of it. Lio found him attractive back then and assumed not much had changed his looks, though it would be hard to tell without a more “hands on inspection.” She came to the hotel tonight knowing this was the direction things would likely go, and while she hoped she would be able to get him to talk without sex, that didn’t seem to be where they were heading. Sex was Plan B, and she’d have to wear him out.
Sherlock turned to Lio. “Have they?”
Sherlock slid in behind John, noting that while his eyes were still wide and fearful, the corners were pinched in pain. He was hurting himself. Sherlock wrapped his right arm around John's chest and pulled him back into his own. He kept his arm there and said, “All right, follow my breaths. Slow and steady.”
Having expected that question sooner or later, John had done a little investigating of his own. “Maybe thirty-six hours.”
There was a beat of silence. “It was just a graze! What about when I suggested to the General-Major that you should take his son to the formal? I talked you up to him for weeks, trying to get you into his good graces, maybe get you a promotion, and when he finally agreed, what did you do?”
“Mycroft?”
Lestrade found John in the waiting room, impatiently pacing while Sherlock was still in surgery. He handed the other man a cup of coffee.
John smiled faintly, not meeting Sherlock's eyes. “Later, it just...never came up. So we didn't talk about it. After you...left, I felt guilty. There was so much we missed out on, so much unspoken. You were—are—my best friend, and there were so many things we didn't know about each other. When we met, you reminded me there was still something for me in this world, a purpose. When you were gone, that purpose was gone. I didn't have anything. Or I thought I didn't. I was so…pissed...at you for leaving, I hated you, and then I felt guilty about being angry. Rather than feel that constant guilt and anger...” he paused and finally met Sherlock’s eyes, left hand trembling, “I sat on the edge of the tub and put my gun in my mouth.”
“Yeah. Do you have some time? Can I come in?”
“What? How do you recognize--?” John began.
They sat in silence for several minutes, avoiding the elephant in the room. Or waiting to see who would break first.
know.”
Sherlock looked at John as if he should already know the answer, but still replied, “No. No one else was interesting either. Until you. But I understand the mechanics of gay sex, and I assume you do as well.”
John almost choked on the forkful of pad Thai he’d shoveled into his mouth.
John frowned. “You know that's not healthy.”
, but this place is clean. Even in my drug-addled mind, I knew it was too clean. This wasn’t something that was used repeatedly, this house was used once, to hold one person: me. It was abandoned afterward. Too risky to keep using.” He stopped and faced them, breathing heavily. “I was supposed to die there or be too high to remember anything.”
“I know. I need to though. I realized today that I tell my physical therapist more about my nightmares than I tell my flatmate. I...don't like the way that makes me feel. Like I'm hiding something.”
“Come in me, Sherlock,” John whispered, pulling two fingers through the mess on his chest and circling his nipples. He whined at the over sensitivity.
“With lungs full of the Thames. He was pulled out of the water by pier workers early Sunday morning. He was most likely killed elsewhere along the river and brought here, where he'd be quickly found.” Sherlock turned and looked up at Westminster Bridge. They were standing below the Boudicca statue and had a view of the entire north side of the bridge. Sherlock looked at the crime scene photos for Moira's death. “Come on, up here,” he said, and took off.
“Right, the body was left here for a reason. A warning. Something to do with that symbol presumably. Stephen's was on the bottom of his foot, which means the killer took the time to carve it then put his sock and shoe back on. He was strangled manually, meaning he's a strong man.”
He let himself in. “We both know you wouldn't have opened the door. I brought Chinese. Have you eaten?”
“Ta.”
It didn't take long. John spilled down Sherlock's throat with a shout and a jerk, knocking his head against the headboard. Sherlock was still laying between John's legs, breathing deeply and waiting for him to come down.
“Sherlock, sit back down. Now listen, you don't consider me...lesser...for having feelings, do you?”
“C’mon, Sherlock, you don’t know that.”
“Okay. Let's go. I'll talk with Molly and see what the autopsies uncovered.”

Sherlock rolled his eyes. “Yes, thank you Mycroft. Come along, Ms Monroe. Let's flush out our murderer.”
“Absolutely not. I had them questioned. The notes are in the file I gave you. You will not be interviewing anyone or setting foot in Westminster Palace,” Mycroft told Sherlock over the phone later that evening.
“Mycroft, you have a phone and know how to use it. I don’t understand why you insist on ‘dropping by’ as if you’re making a social call,” Sherlock snapped.
.” He was flushed, his bottom lip was a little swollen as if he’d been biting it, and he was nearly panting. Sherlock’s pupils were blown wide, the irises resembling eclipsed suns.
Sherlock took a deep breath and sat back down on the bed. He reached for John and buried his head in John’s stomach. “I’m sorry. I...I just...I don’t like this. There’s too many unknowns.”
“John,” Sherlock tried again.
Lestrade stood. “All right. I'm gonna do a little digging. I'll let you know if I find anything. Take it easy in the meantime and take care of yourself, Sherlock.” With a nod to both of them, he left.
“I'll need the detailed reports.”
John twisted to look back just as Sherlock dipped his head down and licked a wet stripe from his balls to his hole. “Jesus!” he gasped. Sherlock went down again, sucking and licking his balls. “Wait!” John called, breathless. He shoved a pillow under his stomach, below his navel. “Should be a better angle.”
“Yes? You afraid you won’t be good enough for another round?” Lio taunted with a smirk. Sergei growled, and with the hand that was still on her head, pulled her forward. “Thought so,” she muttered before taking him back in.
Sherlock leaned forward and began kissing John’s back. His hands trailed down John’s arms, performing a cursory massage on his biceps, before tangling their fingers together. Sherlock rocked against John, his cock slotted in John’s cleft.
John grabbed his arms and forced him to sit. “I need you to breathe, Sherlock. It doesn’t matter that you missed it. We know now. We need to find out what he’s doing here. And we need to warn Lio. He’s more involved than she realizes.”
is visible, barely, in the corner of the frame. Sergei captioned it as a ‘drug den’ but the house is empty. Drug dens have paraphernalia scattered about, they have evidence of squatters, there’s old clothes, old food containers, old furniture,
They sat at the kitchen table a short while later, John having prepared a nice fry-up. Sherlock's phone started buzzing, which he initially ignored, but when it became incessant, he finally looked at it.
Sherlock perked up a bit. “What kind of mark?”
John shook his head. “Of course not. I’m glad I was able to be there when you needed me.” His brow creased thoughtfully. “Can we talk about what happened? What you saw? Even before we went to bed, you were a bit manic. I know this isn’t something that comes easily for you, but I want to understand, I want to help. Can you tell me?”
“I'll take you,” Lestrade offered, feeling a little guilty. After all, he was the one that put Sherlock in this position and based on the look he was being given, John knew it.
Molly sniffled and picked up the phone. “Oh thank God. John says he's here and on his way down. I'll go meet him. You'll be okay?”
“Of course. Why wouldn’t I?”
Sherlock frowned and looked at his watch. “It's 5pm now. Lestrade, you and John head to Caffe Nero. John, go inside and wait. Lestrade, keep watch outside. I'll wait here with Ms Monroe and go with her to Nero. We'll walk.”
John's hands were still on his arse, and Sherlock tried the same, massaging and kneading and spreading while he kissed and nipped and licked down John's chest. His tongue flicked at a nipple, which pulled a breathy “fuck” from John and brought one of his hands to his straining erection, giving it a few quick jerks before reaching for Sherlock's cock. Sherlock slid to his knees before John could wrap his fingers around it. He pulled at it himself instead, trying to relieve some of the pressure but only ended up making it worse. He took his hands away and looked up at John as he lapped at the head of his cock before taking it fully into his mouth. John collapsed against the cool tile of the shower as Sherlock's hot mouth enveloped his cock. While he was down here, Sherlock tilted his lower body toward the shower spray and spread himself. If they were going to have sex, he wanted to be as clean as possible. This wasn't perfect, but it would have to do.
“Sherlock! Stop. You’re jumping to way too many conclusions. That’s not like you. It’s getting late; tomorrow we’ll go down and talk to Lio and see if we can straighten some of this out. You don’t have all the data yet. Until then, I need you to relax.”
John bit his lip to keep from shouting; a growl was trapped in his chest instead, and came down Sherlock's throat for several seconds before the other man needed to breathe and pulled off John's still-leaking member. John didn't say anything, only hauled him to his feet, kissed him roughly, and spun him around so his back was against the tile. He dropped quickly to his knees and damn near inhaled Sherlock's cock as deep as he could, using one hand for what his mouth couldn't reach. The other rolled Sherlock's balls and occasionally went further back to stroke his cleft.
“Not at all, Miss Verednikova. Your eyes may not be focusing, but I know your attention is. It's that attention I have need of at the moment.”
Lio sought out his hand and held it gently, a concerned frown marring her features.
Lestrade shook his head and shot John a long-suffering glance, who shrugged helplessly. Lestrade let them be and joined the forensic team in the kitchen.
“All right, all right. You remember the case before the whole Parliament killer? Jason Reynolds, overdosed and posed after the fact?”
Lio stood. “I’ll be fine,” she said again, making her way to the door. She turned before heading back down to her flat. “Completely unrelated. You two might want to invest in noise canceling panels or something.” She chuckled as she left, hearing John splutter in embarrassment.
“But then you'd be bored.”
“Huh. Little creepy, that.”
“She has saved both your lives twice now. I believe she’s entitled to a brief hospital visit.”
“John, John, John, stop!” John jerked his fingers out, thinking he had hurt Sherlock, causing the other man to squawk in discomfort at the sudden withdrawal. Sherlock flopped over onto his back, not noticing or caring that he was laying in the come from his previous orgasm. “I think I was going to come again,” he gasped. His cock was purple and throbbing against his belly. “Please John.” He raised his knees and grasped the back of his thighs, spreading himself as wide as possible.
“They'll hurt him.”
John kept up this time, and they came to a stop in the center of the bridge, facing south, under a set of street lights. Moira's body had been propped up here.
Sherlock continued along his shoulders and upper back, working his long fingers into the knotted muscles, spending most of his time on John’s damaged left shoulder, tracing the scarring softly at first, then gradually increasing the press and pull of his hands until John was moaning as the tension was worked out by Sherlock’s expert ministrations. Sherlock added a little more lotion as he moved down to the middle of John’s back, sliding his palms against slightly bruised ribs before returning to John’s spine. John released a long keening groan as a particularly painful knot was released. Sherlock shifted a little so he could more easily reach John’s lower back, and began again, kneading and caressing the sore muscles at his waist.
“K-kitch-kk--” The seizure took her before she could get the word out.
“No. This is all very...I don't know. I've always been secure enough to recognize when a man is handsome. I don't have a problem saying you're handsome. I never wanted to try anything with a man, though. But it's you, so touching is...okay? Kissing you this morning, also okay. More...I don't know right now. I'm open to...other things, I think...” John trailed off, frowning deeply and not looking at Sherlock.
John looked a bit devious, grabbing Sherlock's hands and pinning them against his body as he rubbed his chin and cheeks across both nipples. “Oh, that's interesting,” John said, switching between licking and rubbing. Sherlock's nipples were red and raised and John could feel Sherlock's erection coming back to life between their bodies. John wasn't quite there himself, but he had an idea. Abandoning his nipples, John dragged his face down Sherlock's abdomen, kissing and nipping here and there as he went lower. He avoided the hardening cock completely. “Sherlock, put a pillow under your hips.” Sherlock did as he was asked, albeit with a slightly suspicious expression. With Sherlock's pelvis tilted toward him, John lowered his mouth to Sherlock's inner thighs. He'd done this before, but this time made sure to scrape his cheeks against the sensitive skin. Sherlock keened and his cock twitched. John moved his mouth to Sherlock's balls, licking lightly. He hesitated only a moment before dipping his tongue to Sherlock's entrance and circling it.
His back was on fire and there was no comfortable position he could find that allowed him to sleep. The cuts he'd sustained from escaping under the barbed wire at the military base in Aktobe, Kazakhstan the week before were still weeping blood. They opened every time he moved.
“Mmm, please.”
raise your voice to me like that again. I know you’re frustrated and angry, but that doesn’t give you the right to take it out on me. Now, I’m going to make tea, then you and I are going to have a calm, rational discussion like the calm, rational adults we are, okay?”
“All right?” John prompted, growing a little concerned at Sherlock's continued silence. The man still seemed to be struggling in expressing his feelings.
“It’s all in Russian. Didn’t Mycroft say you had an issue with Cyrillic?”
“John!” Sherlock warned, and tugged at his hair, but John stayed where he was, swallowing Sherlock's orgasm.
They sat at their usual places; Mycroft in John’s chair, John and Sherlock next to each other on the couch, and Lio taking the remaining spot to Sherlock’s right. Sherlock’s laptop, with the thumb drive, and Mycroft’s files were on the coffee table.
“Sherlock, I was thinking. Maybe we should switch rooms, at least until I have one fully functioning leg again. You can take my room. I'm positively exhausted; I was planning to go to bed now, actually.”
“Ah.” Mycroft was silent for a moment. “Tomorrow then, Miss Verednikova.”
Sergei barked a laugh. “You? I’m not here for you. What’s so important about you? Once you escaped, we washed our hands of you, hoping you’d died out in the cold. I didn’t ‘use’ Lio for anything. In fact, she used me.”
“Indeed. His mark was on his chest, so the killer didn't have time after the train struck him to hide it like he did the other three. The train operator knew he hit something and called it in right away.” He hauled himself back onto the platform and helped John up before taking off.
“Can you give her another dose?” Sherlock asked, walking over. He stopped next to Lestrade who was crouched next to Sergei, taking notes.
Sherlock shoved a fifty pound note into the boy's pocket. “Make sure you share with Evie and Jamie.”
“It's part of you, just like this one,” Sherlock said, and spread his palm over the scar Moran left on his abdomen, feeling the muscles jump under his hand. He pressed another light kiss to John's shoulder. “This one's almost gone,” he said, tracing the other cut Moran left, the fading stripe that started at the hollow of John's throat and ended at his navel. “They prove you're a survivor. You're strong, indomitable, and I wouldn't have you any other way.”
“It's good.”
Oh hey, it's a plot. Chapter title from "Messenger" off Polaris by Tesseract
“You're not gay.”
“Holy shit.”
Sherlock only grinned a little ferally at him, grasped the waistband of his pajamas, and yanked them down, sliding his body down with them. John pushed himself up onto his elbows in time to watch Sherlock swallow his cock down to the root before gagging and pulling back, leaving about an inch which he wrapped his long fingers around. He tried a few more times to deep-throat John but kept gagging.
Sherlock whirled to John. “How long has he been dead?”
Sherlock, now settled between John’s legs, smiled and leaned forward to kiss him on the mouth, but abruptly changed course to his jaw. He continued up behind John’s ear, nipping a little as he went. John liked this better; he was able to touch now, and ran a hand through Sherlock’s hair before bringing his mouth down to Sherlock’s throat and sucking.
“Miss Verednikova,” Mycroft's tone darkened. “This involves my brother. I will do whatever is necessary to protect him.”
“I'd be offended if I wasn't so tired. Sorry Sherlock, I guess I have to build up my stamina. I'm not used to chasing you all over London. It was good, though, being out there with you again.” John stood and stretched, then leaned down and kissed Sherlock. Sherlock's eyes slid closed as he arched into the kiss. Their tongues tangled together for a few moments before John pulled away. “I'll let you work. Before this goes too far.” He yawned again. “Or I fall asleep.” He disappeared into Sherlock's bedroom. Or was it their bedroom now? Sherlock shook his head and went to the bookshelf, picking out a few symbol dictionaries. He flipped between the books and the internet, finding a few things that were close, but no exact matches.
“From killing a couple of Parliamentary staff members? Are you an idiot? What was that going to do, other than create some job openings?”
“No sir, we eat lunch here. Sometimes I take a lap of the interior if it's been an extra stressful day, but I stay inside. Too many distractions outside.”
“Lio, he remembers seeing Sergei inside the house. Sergei was there, and watched Sherlock get drugged.”
Sherlock whirled on him, but before he could retort, there was a quiet “I wouldn't be too sure about that,” from John, who was kneeling on the floor. He had Reynolds' sock off and was holding his foot, pointing at the scarring visible on the dead man's ankle. “He injected it in his feet.” John pulled off the other sock. “Ah, here's the one that killed him, near the ball of the ankle. It's the freshest.”
John winced. “Greg...”
Her head tilted in the speaker’s direction as she processed the voice. Her face split into a grin and she jumped to her feet, laughing and throwing her arms open. The man took a small step into them and the two seeming strangers hugged tightly.
“Overruled by your loving partner!” Sherlock called after him.
The murderer froze for a second before taking off, Sherlock hot on his heels and John behind him. He was surprisingly quick and agile for a big man, and it was all they could do to keep him in their sights. They chased him through St John's Garden where he turned back toward the cafe. Lestrade chose that moment to catch up to them, and managed to cut the murderer off, forcing him behind Home Office, allowing Sherlock and John to close in.
Lio brought the drive up to 221B early the following morning after making a copy for herself. By the time they reconvened after dinner, they’d been able to go over the information. Mycroft was already there nursing a tumbler of brandy when Lio arrived. John offered her some out of politeness, but Lio turned him down, the occasional shot of vodka all the alcohol she could handle.
“Yes there are, you just haven't found them yet. The murder weapon is also most likely in this house.” Sherlock crouched down again and began searching under the rest of the furniture.
“Three inch-long diagonal lines. A symbol, but of what? For whom?” Sherlock stood for a moment before sweeping out of the morgue.
“Yeah, a total of eight deaths and when I checked at the other hospitals to see if there had been any non-fatal overdoses with the same cocktail, there were seven more.” Molly frowned at him and moved closer. “Are you sure you're all right? You look awfully peaky. Do you want to sit down?”
“I...I want...I want to show you how much I...” He suddenly took a deep breath and lunged forward, planting a kiss square on John's mouth. It was quick and dry and lips only. He leaned back almost immediately, staring fearfully into John's wide eyes.
“What--?” he started, and tried to focus. There were three...no four men in this room. His head lolled backward and he forced himself to hold it steady. “What did you give me?” he tried again in Russian.
“Sherlock!”
/*//*/*//*/****/*/
“You don’t want to hang around and go again?”
“Yes.”
John shook his head. “They're not a weakness. You wouldn't tell me my sentiments or what-have-you are weaknesses, so why are yours different?”
He paused at a bench. “This is where I came across Mike, and he took me to Bart's to introduce us.” He smiled fondly. “Had someone told me that I'd end up living with a mad genius detective who plays violin and borrows items from morgues, I would've had them committed.” The smile dropped. “I almost didn't stop when Mike called to me. I had checked out, wanted nothing to do with the world.” He looked up at Sherlock. “If I hadn't met you, I wouldn't be here.”
John learns how much he means to Sherlock.
“I need to gather data, Mycroft. I can't do that if I can't interview witnesses.”
Lestrade rolled his eyes. “Right, well, I have procedures to follow. Anyway, parents have been dead a few years, has two younger sisters that live in Edinburgh. We're trying to get a hold of them. Never married, no kids. Wasn't dating anyone recently according to the staff.”
Lestrade had Sherlock's undivided attention. Sherlock had been without a solid case for nearly three weeks and he was ready to take whatever the DI had. “I assume you shouldn't tell me anything about your cases, but you do anyway because you always need my help, and my reactions have nothing to do with my ability to solve a case.”
Sherlock sighed. “Fine, let's get this over with.”
“Just like the first time we were here,” Sherlock repeated and placed his order, “I thought I would recreate the night of our first case.”
“This is okay, Sherlock. I know what I want.”
Sherlock dropped to the floor. “Fuck.” He hastily cleaned himself up and wiped haphazardly at the floor. Quickly throwing on pajamas, he joined John in bed, taking care not to jar him too much. He curled around John, drawing a contented sigh from the shorter man before he resumed snoring lightly. Obviously he hadn't heard Sherlock's extremely successful experiment.
While they were waiting for their food, Sergei put a thumb drive on the table. “Everything I’ve got. I assumed you wouldn’t be the only one looking at it, so there are a few pictures, but mostly it’s documentation. Where it started and how it spread.”
His eyes were pinched closed in discomfort. It wasn’t painful, since he’d been pretty well prepared, but he was definitely uncomfortable with Sherlock inside him. John took a few moments to get used to it, then broke their kiss. “All right, Sherlock, you can move.” Sherlock looked like he’d been told there was a locked-room murder for him to solve as he rocked back and thrust forward gently and deeper. He took hold of John’s softened cock and began jerking it in time to his thrusts. Each time he moved, Sherlock went deeper until he finally hit that magic organ.
Sherlock couldn't take it because John might be turning purple, “John, stop. There doesn't have to be 'other things' yet. This is different for me too, so this, what we have now, is fine.”
The rest of dinner was spent in silence as they ate, even Sherlock cleaned his plate. John insisted on helping put away the dishes afterward with the excuse that he needed to move a little or he would stiffen up. Sherlock allowed it, but the washing up was finished in record time. They both retired to the living room afterward. Sherlock picked up the violin.
The prostate is a magical organ, John thought absurdly as he brushed against it. A little
Mycroft took a deep breath through his nose. “Correct. A choice I regret, as it’s a mistake that’s now come back to haunt us.”
John nodded silently, flushed bright red and eyes squinted shut.
The other eyebrow joined the first and they climbed toward his hairline. “Sherlock. Are you sure? You just came out of hospital. I don't know if we have...” John was pink all over.
“Well.”
“Ugh,” she said again, and shivered.
Sherlock took John's hands and placed them on his hips. He was on his knees and slowly lifting himself and letting himself fall, grunting as he did so.
John shook his head. “No. You needed me.”
Sherlock mimicked his position. “I feel...I don't know what...this is not what I...”
“In Westminster Station?” Sherlock prodded.
“He’s going to kill me for telling you. He had nightmares. All night. Sometimes it took him a while to recognize me.” John closed his eyes and rested his head against the couch, Sherlock’s terrified expression flitting through his mind. He opened his eyes. “He dreamed of the house. They had him restrained, tied to a chair, and they drugged him repeatedly with that freakish combination. He hallucinated. I think he hallucinated last night too, he was having multiple flashbacks. I don’t think he slept at all.” John ran a hand down his face. “I didn’t.”
“I'm glad I came home when I did. I'm sorry it wasn't sooner.”
John, Sherlock, Mycroft, and Lio try to figure out wtf is going on and who's involved in it.
Sherlock hummed skeptically. “You're still not 100%. What if--”
It was John’s turn. “Lio, there’s no reason a Russian agent should be in London. At least one of us should go with you.”
“Up until he pinned her to the floor.”
John took in a breath, as if preparing himself for something unsavory. Sherlock paused and watched him.
Mycroft narrowed his eyes at them.
“I know what heroin and fentanyl are, haven’t heard of 25I. I assume it’s why Golov mentioned club kids; but this is way too sophisticated.”
*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/
Ms Monroe puffed herself up a bit. “I take pride in my work with Lord Denton and the Security Committee.”
He never finished; suddenly the man charged with a primal scream. John was on Sherlock's right, and he had the wind briefly knocked out of him as Sherlock shoved him into a wall. He heard a pained gasp from Sherlock as both he and the murderer went down in a tangle. John recovered himself and hauled the larger man off Sherlock with an arm around his neck and spun him around before landing a right hook in the big man's solar plexus, doubling him over. John took advantage of the face that was now at a perfect height to drive a knee into, sending him sprawling to the ground, unconscious. The knife clattered away.
“You're going rather willingly,” John said as the bathroom door closed.
“If the same man killed all four, how has he subdued them? There weren't any drugs in their systems and there weren't any other signs of intoxication.”
“Goodnight John.” Sherlock said, shaking his head. He went back to the living room and took out his violin. He hadn't played since he'd been back; he'd tuned the instrument and cleaned it, but hadn't taken the time to truly play. He'd been too preoccupied with making sure John was healing properly and making his physical therapy appointments. He took the time now, feeling they could both use its calming effect.
and came hard, spilling over John's hand and triggering John's own orgasm.
“What does--”
“Whatever happened to ‘Captain Watson,’ second in command?” John chuckled as he headed to the bath.
Making a decision, he flipped them so Sherlock had his back on the bed. Sherlock let out a huff of annoyance at being moved so roughly but it turned into a moan as John palmed him through his pajamas. He pulled them down, freeing Sherlock's cock. It was longer and thinner than John's; of course, everything about Sherlock was long and thin and even though John was feeling brave, there was no way he was going to get that all in his mouth.
“What? Lio, what’s wrong?”
“Then what about the time I tried to make you a trainer? You were supposed to help my son pass his firearms qualifications but he still failed!”
John turned to Mycroft. “How the hell are you keeping this out of the media? Four brutal murders around Parliament and no one's said or seen anything? I don't know whether to be impressed or scared.”
/*/*/*/*/*/
“My routine, sir? I don't understand, I thought this had to do with our work.”
“Yeah, I did. After, well after everything, I stepped away. Couldn’t stay idle long though, and started consulting for Alpha Group and the FSB. Do some training too, and I work with Golov quite a bit. He talked me into coming back after you left Russia.”
“I believe that's an insult to troglodytes.”
John's expression darkened a bit and his hand stopped moving in Sherlock's hair. Sherlock moved to sit up, but John put his other hand on his shoulder, holding him down. “It's nothing. At first I thought he was threatening me, y'know, the whole 'break his heart and I'll break your neck' thing that older brothers do, but I think he was making sure I was serious. And to wish us luck.”
Sherlock solved it for him by stepping in front of him and shoving his head through the shirt. John was able to raise his right arm to get it though the armhole, but his left was essentially non-functional. Sherlock gently guided it through, only causing John to inhale sharply in pain twice. They stopped before tackling the pants, John's shirt not quite settled and showing the long horizontal slash Moran left on his belly. Sherlock looked at it and grimaced.
The kettle boiled and Lio brought Sergei his tea and sat next to him on the couch with her own. “Strange that it would end up in London. You know more about it than I was expecting. The drug, I mean.”
“You’ve got two fingers buried in me. I just gave you lube. Yes, I’m sure.
“Everything will remain where you left it,” Sherlock assured her.
She heard the sincerity in his voice and the guilty feeling grew. “I hope it doesn’t...bother you.”
Mycroft raised an eyebrow. “I’d say you were a bad influence on him, John, but he’s always had a bit of a temper. I wish you luck.” He left as well, though with less door slamming.
It wasn’t too much longer before he had to warn her. “Lio!” She ignored the warning, only bobbing her head faster and rocking on her fingers harder. The first shot hit the back of her throat and she swallowed automatically, the rest hitting her tongue and pooling in her mouth before she swallowed. She came on her fingers immediately after, clenching around the digits before she pulled them out. He grabbed her hand and licked her fingers noisily.
“I need my dear brother to solve a murder. Or four.”
“Mmm. No, thank you,” he smiled sleepily. “Such an attentive lover.”
Sherlock rested his hands on John's head, gripping his hair lightly. That wrenched a moan from John and he bobbed his head faster, going deeper each time, but still not able to get it all in. He inserted a finger into Sherlock.
“No hold on. You think I'm upset about the assistants being so easily replaced. Well I am, but I know that's reality. I don't like it, but I know that's how it works.”
“Already did. Texted him.” He knew what this was now, he'd seen John have them often enough. His heart was racing and he was having trouble controlling his breathing. God, is this what John went through every time? His throat felt like it was closing and he tried to clear it. Something was very wrong. He was at Bart's, or he had been, and then it turned very cold, colder than the morgue should have been. Morgue? Right, he was at the morgue with...Molly? And Lestrade? No, no, they shouldn't be here. He was alone. Outside, where there was a lot of snow, that's why it was so cold. He had to contact Mycroft. Mycroft would get him...get him what? His back hurt, but he couldn't remember why. He tried to clear his throat again.
“Like I've been stabbed. When are they taking these out?” Sherlock asked, motioning to the chest tubes.
“He was after Lio, not me.”
Sherlock scoffed skeptically and began poking at a nearby bookcase, rifling through the books looking for a hidden compartment. Finding nothing, he moved on to the desk, opening all the drawers and searching those for secret hiding places as well. He kicked a lower drawer shut in frustration when he didn't find anything there either.
“Jesus Christ, make some noise!”
“No...just this.” Sherlock reached across the table and put his hand on John's, which was still holding the stem of the wine glass.
Sherlock's heels pressed into John's lower back. “Fuck me, John.”
She nodded eagerly. “Don’t need to tell me twice.”
Sherlock finished with John's buttons first and swept the shirt off his shoulders, exposing the newly healed pink surgical scars on his left shoulder as well as the solar flare of the original bullet wound. He touched it gently, watching John's face for any sign of discomfort. He lowered his mouth to it and kissed it reverently, feeling the rubbery scar tissue under his lips. John sucked in a breath and stepped back.
“Da. No lasting damage. I’ve been told it’s a nice straight scar.”
“Jesus he's got an iron grip. Sherlock, mate, listen. You're safe. It's just me and Molly. We're not going to hurt you.”
Sherlock cut Lestrade off with tired wave of his hand. “You couldn't have known.”
John stopped pacing and looked at Lestrade. “What?”
“There’s a photo. I recognize where it was taken.”
“No!” Sherlock barked and came off the couch all at once and began pacing.
They talked a bit more, Lio discovered Sergei was staying in a very fancy hotel for a seemingly unlimited amount of time. He invited her over the day after tomorrow, after she gave Sherlock and John the thumb drive. She readily agreed. Though she honestly wanted to spend more time with an old friend, something wasn’t adding up here. This wasn’t right, and the last time she ignored her instincts, three of her men had been killed.
John whirled to Sherlock, who was sitting against the wall. “Sherlock, Jesus, are you—oh God,” he said as he registered the dark blood on Sherlock's shirt. He knelt and put pressure on the wound, causing Sherlock to grunt.
It was still dark when he awoke again, feeling eyes on him. John went completely still and cracked his eyes open, startled to see Sherlock wide awake and watching him. He didn't have his arm around John anymore, but they were still quite close.
“God, yes. More.”
John scrubbed at his face. “All right. How…?”
“Probably best for you to stay out of it from here.”
Sherlock scoffed then winced. “Who bet against us?”
Sherlock's breathing hitched and his eyes snapped open, unseeing at first. “Easy, Sherlock. It's John. You're safe.” John was still carding his fingers through Sherlock's hair gently. Sherlock uncoiled from his tense posture and rolled onto his back, taking careful, measured breaths. John's hand dropped and he sat on the edge of the bed. “Sherlock? All right?”
Sherlock didn't know how long he'd been trapped here before the bonds on his wrists gave way and he was finally able to stumble blindly out of the house. Adrenaline poured through him and he found the strength to run. He didn't stop until he reached the outskirts of the city. He didn't dare go back to his safe house to collect his meager belongings, and spent the night huddled next to the generator of a restaurant. It kept him from freezing to death. He would have to contact Mycroft somehow in the morning. He put his back against the brick of the building, not caring how much it stung, and drew his knees to his chest, dropping his head wearily onto them. For the first time since leaving London, he felt the burn of tears at his eyes. He sniffed and willed them away, and shivered the whole night through.
“No. That means he’s using her for something, but what? She’s twelve years out of the service, is blind, and lives in a foreign country. What use could he possibly gain from that? Unless he’s using her to get closer to me. I got away from Volgograd. I know what these ‘dealers’ look like.” Sherlock suddenly froze. He shot to his feet and ran to the bedroom, where he jerked open his desk drawer and pulled out a file. He rifled through it frantically.
He ignored her sarcasm. “Would you open the door please?”
“You should go to bed. You're obviously exhausted. You'll be useless like this.”
He squeezed a generous amount of lubricant onto the fingers of his right hand and spread it around a bit. Planting his feet flat on the floor, he sank down off the couch so he ended up in a squat, knees spread widely. He transferred a bit of lubricant to his left hand and gave his cock a few quick jerks. Seeking the opening, he snaked his right hand between his legs. Gasping as his fingers made contact, he circled the entrance gently, not applying too much pressure yet. Sherlock continued slowly pulling at his cock. After several minutes, and a bit more lubrication, he pushed his middle finger against the tight ring, breaching himself. He had to bite down hard on the inside of his cheek to keep from crying out. Panting heavily, he pushed the finger in further and began tugging his cock faster. He thrust his finger in and out a few times, trying different angles before finally hitting his prostate. He slammed his head back onto the couch, mouth open in a silent howl as his orgasm tore through him. His chest and belly were splattered with semen, and as he pulled his finger from his arse, his cock gave another weak pulse and dripped over his hand.
“John!” Sherlock roared and bent double as emptied himself into John. John grabbed the back of his neck and brought him down for a searing kiss.
“Lay back,” he ordered, and as she did, she heard the telltale rustling of a condom packet being opened. A few moments later, the bed tipped as he climbed between her legs again. Sergei put the tip of his cock against her pussy and ran it up and down a few times, gathering the wetness. “Ready?” he asked and positioned himself at her entrance.
Sergei tugged on her hair and she moved away. “What?”
He stood and went to his coat, digging into an inner pocket. He'd swiped the medical grade lubricant from Bart's this morning specifically for this purpose. Stripping off his shirt, trousers, and underwear, leaving a trail as he made his way back to the couch, he plopped down, legs spread. He ran a hand across his chest, tweaking both nipples as he went. Discovering how sensitive they were came as a bit of shock last night; he brought both hands up and rolled and pinched at them, biting his lip to stifle a loud moan.
“Okay?”
“Yeah, definitely going back to sleep.” He burrowed a little under the covers and sighed contentedly, drifting off again.
John nodded and took a gulp of tea against the dryness in his throat. “So, have you had sex with men?”
John was silent for several moments. “Sherlock...” he started slowly, “That’s all...creepily romantic, and I’m flattered that you want to protect me, and if I’m ever in that kind of trouble, please feel free to come to my rescue, but...I don’t want you to lose yourself in me. I need you to be able to focus and protect yourself, Sherlock, because the alternative...” his breath hitched a little as he remembered the fall, “The alternative is unthinkable.”
John put a hand on her knee and felt her tense slightly before relaxing. “I know exactly how you feel, Lio. Sherlock brought me out of that same place after I came back from Afghanistan. He seems to bring out the best in people.” He sent a fond glance to Sherlock, and caught Mycroft’s face out of the corner of his eye. He looked like he’d bitten into a lemon.
Sherlock hummed and looked up at John. “I should hope so; he saw me kiss you. Does that bother you?”
“I still don’t like it,” John said.
“I’d rather not. It might depress her respiratory system too much and we certainly can’t handle both at once.”
“Lestrade knows.”
She nodded. “I know, there were three pairs of feet. The third could have been Lestrade, but his steps are more forceful and louder.”
So ends part one, and the boys take us out with a bang. Chapter title from "Mirror Image" off Sonder by Tesseract
Lio woke some time in the late morning hours and grabbed her phone from her bag, which thankfully hadn’t been lost in the marathon sex. She listened to Sergei’s heavy breathing from the bed and smirked; she had indeed worn him out, though she was a little sore herself. Lio started hunting for his phone. His computer would likely be far too protected for her to get any information out of, and it would definitely be noticed if it was missing, so taking it was out of the question. Plan B involved getting all the data off his phone, which wouldn’t be as protected.
“I didn’t think either of us would want a large meal. We do have some tins of soup, though, we could warm that up.”
“I do like it, though. Grandma made it every Sunday.”
Sherlock started pacing the bedroom. “Yes! I was more focused on Lio when I looked at that file the first time so I
The four bodies lay side by side on autopsy slabs. “What's their causes of death?” Sherlock said without any greeting.
“I wouldn't expect you to do anything you're not ready for, so don't feel obligated to perform fellatio,” he said without opening his eyes.
Sherlock slid his hand back to John's groin. “Seems plenty awake.” Sherlock straightened, straddling John's hips and rocking gently.
Mycroft raised an eyebrow. “He hasn't told you? Interesting.”
As the three of them had dinner together, they talked about why Sherlock had been gone. Noticing that John's eyes tightened at the corners and they lost some of their warmth, Sherlock steered the conversation toward current events, assuring Mrs Hudson that with Moran gone, there was no more danger from Moriarty. He spoke briefly of his time with Lio and promised they would be introduced soon.
“Sherlock and John are perfectly capable, Detective Inspector.”
Sherlock scowled. He would do whatever he could to protect John from going through that kind of distress again.
“Yeah, fine,” he said, clenching his fists to keep his hands from shaking.
“Good?” Sherlock asked, and John could hear the smirk.
“John,” she started, taking a deep breath. She ran her free hand through her hair before finally releasing John’s. “I read Mycroft’s file on me. It had the most recent information on all my former associates, from me up through the general of the army. Everyone’s retired except Lieutenant Colonel Kedrov and Colonel Golov. Kedrov’s now a colonel in a different branch of the army and doesn’t work with the Alpha Group anymore. I also did some discreet checking on my own, just in case Mycroft’s people missed something. Unlikely, I know, but I had to make sure his information was accurate.”
you may have noticed, but i really like the band Tesseract. djent/prog rock is my jam. if anyone is interested, most of this was written to tesseract, karnivool, butterfly effect, acroma, thrice, starset, red sun rising, katatonia, rishloo, caligula's horse, and a shit ton of others.
“I didn't think...” Sherlock trailed off. “Thank you. For staying.”
“Right, you said he took the pictures.”
“You don’t have to talk about the house, at least not in detail. I know enough of what happened. Unless there’s something you want to add, we can avoid it.”
“Yes.”
“Ohhhhhh,” John moaned, then bucked as Sherlock’s fingertip hit his prostate. “Oh fuck!”
i do have an idea for a part three, and also maybe a prequel focusing on john while sherlock was away, because we all have to do one of those.
Both men were instantly on alert as a large man entered. He was easily taller than Sherlock and sturdily built. He wore a baseball cap low over his eyes, which hid most of his face. He sat down at a corner table without ordering anything.
John kissed him, gently this time.
“I...no one's cared like that...about me...before.”
“We had him autopsied, of course, to find out what kind of drugs he'd taken. Turns out Molly had seen that particular cocktail before, in seven other overdose deaths over the past few months. It's also shown up a few times at various A&Es around the city. Which means--”
“Absolutely not. If he sees I’ve been followed or have back up, it might spook him and then we get nothing. And there’s plenty of reasons why he would be here, just nothing that makes sense for Golov to be involved in. Or why he would agree to meet me.”
Sherlock relaxed slightly at John's refusal to leave. “I think I understand. Sitting in bed next to each other and occasionally touching each other isn't the same as kissing. Or sex.”
“I'm not in shock,” he protested, and tried to pull it off before being overcome with wracking coughs. Blood trickled from his mouth.
He didn’t get a verbal response from Sherlock, who had a look on his face similar to a kicked puppy, so John proceeded with tea. He set Sherlock’s cup in front of him when it was finished. The other man was on the couch with his head bowed and his hands dangling between his knees, a very un-Sherlock-like posture.
The case Lestrade dragged him to was hardly a 4, but John was right, he needed to get out. It was clear on the other side of London and took almost 45 minutes to arrive. As they pulled up to the crime scene, a little thrill of anticipation shivered down his spine. It felt good to be back.
“Are you asking if I'm a virgin? The answer is no, though it wasn't an especially pleasurable experience for either party. Neither of us reached orgasm and she went on to...well, she made sure no one else wanted me.”
John was thankful she couldn’t see the look of sympathy on his face. He understood why she wore the glasses. “Shall I get tea ready then? I assume you’re here to talk about Volgograd.”
After he left, Lio opened the file Mycroft left and slid the papers into her scanner. She'd spent a considerable amount of money upgrading her technology: new computer, new audio set up, text to speech software, anything that would be helpful. She listened to what Mycroft had and made some edits, cutting out what she deemed unimportant. It wasn't necessary to let anyone know who this was all regarding or on who's behalf she was asking for information. A friend would suffice. She sent the redacted information to her former commander, then made a phone call.
Sherlock essentially ignored Molly and read through the report, freezing as he got to the type of drugs found in Reynolds' system. He set the report down after a moment and sent two texts, first to John and then to Mycroft.
“They ain't exactly officers!”
John returned home later that evening. Sherlock had warmed up leftovers waiting for him, which he devoured sitting in his chair in front of the telly. “I see the door to Lio’s flat is back up,” he said through a mouthful. He lifted his fork in cheers. “Thanks for this, by the way, I’m absolutely starving. Hospital biscuits and coffee only do so much.”
“Ah, John!” Sherlock cried. He pulled back a little, and before John could go in again, Sherlock shoved two fingers in his mouth. “Suck.” John’s eyes widened and his cock throbbed at the order. “These are going in you, so make them nice and wet.” John gathered saliva and worked his tongue around Sherlock’s fingers, imagining they were Sherlock’s cock. Sherlock was panting as he withdrew, and slid his dripping fingers between John’s legs. Already softened from the rimming earlier, the first finger slid in easily.
Mycroft sighed. “There was...an incident shortly before Sherlock returned to London. He was abducted and drugged for two days before he was able to escape. I was unable to find any connection to Moran or Moriarty, so, regretfully, I let it go. The drugs that were used in that incident have now appeared in London. I've retraced my investigation and have come up against some red tape. My government contacts aren't getting results or aren't working fast enough.”
as fuck? Back off, Sherlock, or I will kick you in the
“You asking me to fuck you? Yeah, a little bit.” Now John was blushing.
“She won’t. Are you forgetting she’s blind, John? We would literally have to announce ourselves.”
“I stole some lubricant from Bart's. We shouldn't need condoms. I know we're both clean; you're a doctor, you get tested regularly, and I was tested just before returning to London. I want this. I want you.”
“I’ve brushed up on it since then.”
At his wits' end, John sent Lestrade a text, begging him to get Sherlock out of the flat for a few hours.
He cut off a loud moan, slapping a hand over his mouth to stifle it and knees nearly buckling as Sherlock took him into his mouth. He rested his other hand on Sherlock's head, tangling his fingers in the curls. John was going to last an embarrassingly short time, but he managed to hold out until one of Sherlock's hands, which had been gripping his hips, started fondling his balls.
John swept an arm out. “This place is a tourist trap. No way someone didn't see a murder; there's thousands of people here.”
“Hmm, I usually am. I want it to work, John. Now, why don't you go home, shower, change and bring a change of clothes for Sherlock. I'll wait here with him.”
John stroked his head. “I know.” They stayed like that for a few moments before John said “We’re already in here; let’s go to bed. We’ll figure this out in the morning.”
“Anything and everything you're willing to give me, John.”
John also began looking around, but he didn't really know what he was looking for. Until he found it. Snatching a glove from a passing tech, he gingerly picked the item up. “Sherlock.”
“Oooh fuck. Sherlock, you--”
“Sergei figured the runner was just a stupid kid who went clubbing the night before and when he sampled the product, the combination killed him. And I’m not going to ask why or how you know that’s Sergei.” Lio said, shaking her head.
John's brain ground to a halt again. Did Sherlock just proposition him?
Lio's back! Hey guess what song the chapter title is from
Ignoring both John and Sherlock, Mycroft said, “I asked for Miss Verednikova’s assistance, counting on her military contacts to be able to work around the bureaucracy.”
Mycroft tutted. “No need to worry John. It's all well in hand.”
Sherlock felt the blood drain from his face and his stomach do a strange little flip. Not knowing what else to do but follow his instincts, he slid off the couch and knelt next to John's chair and grabbed his hand. John's gaze jerked down in surprise, then back up to Sherlock's pained face.
“Mycroft said you were the one who wanted to be a pirate, don't try and live your fantasies through me!”
Sherlock nodded. “Let's head back to Westminster. The Network should have some news.”
“Right, okay. Um, I get off at Westminster Station around 7am, and walk to the Palace. I get buzzed in by security by 7:30. I don't leave the Palace until 5:30 or 6.”
John still had his eyes closed. “You were hot and uncomfortable and wanted me to move my arm.”
“I—yes, fine.” Turning to Molly, he said, “Lestrade said there have been others?” Sherlock placed one hand nonchalantly on the counter, bracing himself as his knees suddenly threatened to buckle.
“Okay, why are you here and plying me with food?”
John looked carefully at Sherlock, trying to make out his features in the dark. Sherlock was on his side, curled up in the fetal position and...crying? John stood slowly and turned the desk lamp on, aiming it away from them. The diffuse glow allowed him to see a little better without being blinding, and it wouldn't blind Sherlock if he woke up. John leaned over. Sherlock was shaking and seemed to be sniffling, but there were no tears.
They ended up at a table in the courtyard of the hospital with coffees and pastries. John waited for the hammer to fall.
John bucked back against Sherlock, and he moaned openly. “You’re not finished with the massage, are you?” John asked with a sultry smirk and a raised eyebrow.
“This won't accomplish anything in the long run, you know that. There may be a few more corpses, but the work itself won't suffer. These people will be replaced, and the general public will carry on in ignorance.” Sherlock looked up at the silence from John, who was frowning at him unblinkingly. He sighed. “John...”
Sherlock snorted lightly. He leaned into John. “I know she didn’t have anything to do with Volgograd, but it can’t be a coincidence that Sergei has all this information and was one of her teammates.”
They arrived at the cafe without incident and without Sherlock seeing anyone suspicious. He sat down at John's table while Ms Monroe ordered.
Some M/F het sex between Lio and Sergei.
“John...I'm close.”
“From...the beginning…It was off...something...wasn’t...right. Sergei...please...don’t do this.”
Sherlock only raised an eyebrow. “You were the one who proclaimed yourself fit for duty.”
After a quick shower, Lio plugged her phone into her computer and downloaded what she took from Sergei’s phone. She was stuffing her face with a muffin when there was a knock on the door. She unlocked it and let Sherlock and John in.
“Ostanovit yego. I’m not defenseless. I’ll be fine.”
John leaned forward and planted open-mouthed kisses on each one. “These are part of you too. They prove that Moriarty couldn't beat you. That.you.would.come.back.to.me.” he said, punctuating each word with a kiss across Sherlock's back. He reached around and splayed his hand across Sherlock's lower abdomen, dragging his fingertips through pubic hair to Sherlock's hardening cock. Sherlock whined low in his throat and leaned back against John. “Turn around,” John said, grabbing Sherlock's fancy body wash. He poured some into his hand and wrapped it around both their members, jerking slowly.
John took in a surprised breath. “I admit, Sherlock, I didn't see this coming from you, 'Mr self-professed sociopath.' I never believed that, but you never seemed...interested...in a relationship, of any kind, before. Why now?”
Sherlock grimaced.
He pulled the glasses off and paused before saying, “I’ve heard that can happen. I’m sorry.”
They stood for a few moments, catching their breath and letting the remnants swirl down the drain.
Sherlock wanted more.
Sherlock straightened from where he was looking under the couch. “First of all, it's Anderson. Anything he does is bound to be useless. Second of all, the body was posed like this. He didn't just sit down and die naturally in this position. Rigor had already started to set in when the body was moved.”
“Thank you, John.” He took a seat in John's chair while Sherlock and John sat on the couch.
Lestrade greeted them. “Hey John, good to have you back.”
“That I haven’t figured out yet. I’m still going to Sergei’s hotel tonight; I’ll get more information then.”
“Never. I have you.” He reached up and brought John's head down with a hand on the back of his neck. It was an awkward position, especially for John, so the kiss didn't last long. John was smiling like an idiot through it and when he pulled away the expression was still there. Sherlock grinned back, and relaxed into John's lap.
“Ah, fuck,” John moaned and jolted up into Sherlock, dragging a whimper from the man.
“Hmm. It's softer than I expected. It's very...you. I can't picture you with any other hair. Don't tell me you had a Mohawk in your rebellious teen years.”
“Yes, that was my reaction as well. I advised him it wasn’t necessary, that we could be certain no additional Russian mercenaries would be coming for Lio as she was out of teammates. I don’t believe he listened, so I suspect the camera will be installed tomorrow with the door.”
She inhaled deeply. “No, I haven't eaten, thank you.” They sat at the table and Mycroft distributed the cartons of food as well as a thermos of tea. They ate in silence. Lio was determined to wait him out, but Mycroft had infinite amounts of patience. Lio's was bordering on non-existent.
There was a sharp intake of breath from John, but he didn't say anything.
She blinked a few times. “My—my ear?” she reached up to touch it and her hand came away wet.
John stood from his chair and went to him, grabbing his upper arms gently. “Hey, it's all right,” he said again. “I've got you. Whenever you feel like this, come to me. We'll work through it together. I can't play the violin, so what can I do for you to take your mind off it? Do you want to try to sleep?”
“Lestrade!” John called. The DI rejoined them in the living room, looking askance at John, who showed him the needle. He immediately had it collected into evidence. “Have your people found anything that would point to Reynolds being diabetic? Test strips? More needles? Glucose?”
“Lio, good to see you awake,” John said as they sat, “Sherlock and Mycroft are here too.”
“Good morning. I tried to wake you up, but you were dead to the world. You must've worked pretty hard last night; did you find anything?”
“Sham—oh. Oh.” She rubbed her face. “Sorry about that.”
The Colonel howled with laughter, “Ah, Liolya it's always good to hear from you. We need to talk more often. So many good memories. I don't think I have much of anything for you now, but I've got someone nearby that can get more. Give him 48 hours or so, I'll give him your contact info and have him set up a meeting.”
“Oh, don't, hearing those words come out of that mouth in your voice is...well.”

Sherlock’s eyebrows raised. “You’re sure?”
“Haaaahhh,” John breathed. He may be drooling; he didn’t care, he was so relaxed. Sherlock was doing absolutely heinous things with those hands and violinist fingers. “Hmmm,” he hummed in pleasure as Sherlock undid the tension at the base of his spine. He arched a bit, seeking more contact.
John let out a breath and visibly relaxed.
John did an admirable job of ignoring him and continued, “About last night. I know we've never...talked about my...issues...before.”
John nodded a bit grimly. “Six minutes and counting.”
Lio waited impatiently for several minutes, all the while keeping an ear out for Sergei in case he woke. After the longest seven minutes of her life, the download completed. She disconnected everything, and before leaving the bathroom, sent a text to Sherlock and John to meet her at her apartment in two hours. That should give her enough time to leave without being too suspicious. She left the bathroom, put Sergei’s phone back in his pants and kicked them under the bed, and put the cable, headphones and phone back in her bag.
Sherlock looked at John and seemed to take his measure. John frowned. “What's that for? If you're worried about me, don't be. I am perfectly fine. I have a clean bill of health and I'm free to go traipsing across London hunting down serial killers again.”
“Okay, so he was out of view of the cameras, surely someone would've seen him.”
“The dark glasses are hiding the nystagmus,” Sherlock said. “You don’t have to do that around us.”
Sherlock complied and as John lathered up his hair, remarked, “You seem very attached to my hair.”
John's exuberance was infectious; Sherlock grinned and said, “Perfect timing. Lestrade just called with a case: dead man with no sign of foul play, but young enough that it's unlikely natural causes. Usually below my notice, but you wanted us to get out. I promise no rooftop chasing required.”
