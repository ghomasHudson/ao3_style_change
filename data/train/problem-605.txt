"No. I mean," John smiled, having actually thought he would like to leave a mark someday, somewhere hidden. "I guess it can be if you want."
"What is that?" he asked, stretching out a hand toward it, but Sherlock drew it back out of his reach.
She smiles again, gestures to the monitor. "He knows you're here. And he likes that," she says, pointing to where John has placed his hand over Sherlock's, is holding lightly, just resting over the back of it. "Heart rate dropped about ten beats a minute when you sat down."
they are referring to. It sounds surreal, a contrived nightmare, fictional. He can well recall many soldiers, patients over the years, and the unsuccessful attempts at treating pulmonary embolism. Denial, his mind supplies.
"We would of course try not to intubate, particularly given that he just came off the vent, what, yesterday. It's a sixty to ninety minute procedure, and all of it with anaesthesia present. Local plus sedation should be all he needs." Kathy smiles at him, a sad smile that kind of sums it up, the hard spot they are in.
The milestone is linked with further progress between the men who sleep downstairs, too, although it was not necessarily discussed or planned.
"You don't understand." Sherlock's frustration, his restless energy, kept him from meeting John's gaze, his raised browed look of annoyance.
"Give me three good reasons why I shouldn't." The voice was rough, raspy. Male speaker, young adult. There was some vibrato in the tone and John suspected that stress made the vocal range and pitch a bit higher than normal. All of his hackles continued to rise as he could just intuit that this one meant business.
The smile was genuine and broad. These days, the critical care staff needed more of it, the celebrations, the victories, the ease. "Great. Soon?"
With a sigh, John pressed his forehead to Sherlock's jawline, muttered quietly, "Timing." When he moved to draw away, as they usually did just out of a sense of privacy, Sherlock halted him with a low protesting groan and a tightening of his arms behind John's back. Their recent conversation still quite on John's mind, he couldn't help but bristle at the idea of even this very mild public display of affection. He was not looking to draw any additional attention to their lifestyle as Sameer got used to the idea. He tried to pull away, but Sherlock held him fast. There was a shushing sound, a reassuring pat of Sherlock's hand behind John's waist.
"Damaged. Wet. That front corner room is ... a disaster. We had to carry him to the ambulance. Downed trees over the drive and such." A nurse came in then, checked on Sherlock's leg and IV pump, made a few notations, asked about his pain level, and left again. "Hopefully, in both cases, nothing permanent that can't be repaired."
"This is ridiculous. I shouldn't need to keep the IV site in. It's fine. And the heart monitor, also unnecessary. I'll feel it, and it's normal anyway. There's no reason I should even be in this building. My breathing is fine. I'm calling Mycroft, he'll get things done here, what good is he if he can't make himself useful." John hesitated, having already answered all of these complaints and had no power to actually fix anything anyway. "I swear, I'll give them five minutes - which is too generous as it is - and if no one's here by then, I'm ripping all this stuff out and
John wasn't having it, reaching out to carefully remove the cup from Sherlock's reach before Sherlock could pick it up, and was met with something of a glare. "You should have asked first. You are certainly capable of making your own."
The song obviously hit home with the patient too - given that he was also surprised, eyes wide. And then there were tears coursing down his flushed, emotional cheeks.
surprise here." Under his breath although fully intending John to hear, he muttered, "He just might be smarter than you are."
The nurse pressed a few buttons, cycled another blood pressure, while John tried to suppress visibly acting relieved. But relieved, he was. The monitor now showed a normal, regular, sinus rhythm, with a corresponding heart rate in the seventies. It was, he knew as he stared, beautiful.
A finger had pressed onto his lip. "Do not think for a moment that you have anything to feel remorseful about. We've come a long way since then." Sherlock had leaned in, pressed soft lips to his forehead, an atypical very uncharacteristic gesture of ... emotion, of sentiment. John kept quiet save for his loud swallowing, his breathing, his disagreement nearly palpable in the rigidity of his shoulders, his whole body.
Sherlock's eyes are closed when John goes back in. The monitor, his position, his colour, all looks okay. He is still breathing fairly quickly, his oxygen actually at eight liters now, bubbling through a bottle of sterile water, and his oximetry readings hovering at ninety. John hopes that this is just a result of the activity, the transport, all the moving in these early morning hours.
"I don't remember the breathing tube, not really. Not until they were telling me to cough and then it was out. Although I seem to recall listening to music.‚Äù For that, John is grateful. He had played some music for him while he was mostly awake and before the breathing tube had been removed. The furrow turns to an outright frown. "What day is it?"
Just as I haven't cared for the term stepbrother, or stepfather, I also don't see my family as anything other than regular. I remember nothing else, and family is family. I can call them annoying but you all can't. And I'll defend every one of them to the death, and that is inherited from my genetics as well as my environment. Consider yourselves all warned!
And the procedure goes off without a hitch, with the only exception being that the coffee in the paper cup is actually almost hot enough to nearly burn the inside of John's mouth in the waiting room. They are home by lunchtime, and Sherlock finds a few hours to sleep off the mild sedation, on the couch while Rosie naps upstairs.
"Much improved." She smiles and relief descends on John, on his troubled mind, a loosening of the anxiety-induced muscle tension in his shoulders, the center of his chest. "Much."
Mycroft wouldn't have known the term in his youth, but he understood enough about it to recognise the uniqueness that he shared with his younger brother Sherlock. Of their relationship, their commonalities, their gifts. Blessed at birth with parents of unusual genetics - intelligence, wisdom, and the ability to embrace their children's needs - all he needed to do on some of those childhood days was to look at Sherlock, to see limitless potential in the eyes of his brother. They played, they fussed, they argued as they grew, and yet Mycroft was the only one who really understood Sherlock's frustration, his railing at the limitations of his youth or of his social ineptness. Of his being continually, pervasively misunderstood.
No further texts arrived for a while, and John gave up on the flat, choosing a book to crawl into bed with.
As we've already mentioned, patients who are recovering can get extremely irritable as they start to feel better. They may be slightly more cooperative for the staff and really let their family members have the full brunt of the frustration.
"I had my appendix out when I was seventeen." Sherlock stared back, puzzled, not following why John was speaking. "Concussion in college. Rugby."
"Please?" There was a very rarely seen, playful tone to Mycroft's voice, which made John laugh harder. "Oh, all right. I'll see. But you're asking a lot."
me with her? When you all ambushed me?" Sherlock gestured broadly with his hands, and then Mycroft and Sherlock engaged in a stare-down. "Turnabouts," he uttered quietly, fiercely.
"Of course I do." Sherlock's words were low and quiet, and as he finished them, he shrugged his long arms into the coat, tucking it neatly around him, adjusting the lapels and the placket and the buttons. The brothers met eyes again for a few moments, Mycroft's smile actually warmer and Sherlock's softly benign. Slowly, he searched the pockets, and withdrew an item, holding it loosely in his hand. "His?"
"So I can stay up later now, find something to talk about, go to bed later ...?" He was trying hard to be serious, but the giggles overtook him as he considered how much trouble John already had getting Rosie to bed some evenings, and that Sherlock often had bizarre sleep habits. John worked hard not to make it a battle most of the time, but it did seem that everyone's sleep patterns had some peculiarities already.
"Mycroft, I swear --" Sherlock sneered at his brother. "No one's even here yet, just your hired help and your office minions and --"
.  The article ends with this sentence:  The brain calls from our depths, from the subterranean recesses of our mind.
"Fine," he seethed in a quiet whisper, rising to procure the bag as Mycroft waited in the doorway. From within it, he lifted out a large folded bundle of wool, and held one end while the rest unfurled. He turned the item as it was revealed, a long, well-made wool coat, buttons and accented buttonholes with a flared line to it. Sherlock managed to breathe an unmistakable compliment. "Oh."
"No," John assured him. "Not real, but I didn't invent it. Soon as we get home, though, I have a movie that we absolutely have to watch."
After a bit she scampers off, and Greg asks them about helping with the case. It is John who says they'll be back in town in a couple of days, and that they will be glad to take a look then.
Sherlock's brow raised only slightly, and he didn't focus on John's words yet, answering Sameer again, gently. "We'll go get something to eat, find a little cafe close by, go for a walk, and come back."
Pale blue eyes reconnected with his, and despite his earlier feisty statement, he did nod just a little, the worry showing back through.
John is standing close enough to hear Sherlock's question. "Is it another clot?" Functioning on all cylinders, based on the logic.
"Oh, I don't know, perhaps a little visit to Cereal Killer Cafe?" The gleam in his eye was back, followed by an unparalleled, swallowed-a-canary look. And he positively assumed a quiet gloat, pleased with himself, his pale eyes twinkling as he waited for John to react.
She didn't belabour the point, particularly given Sameer's already nervous behaviour as if he were awaiting unpleasantness. With a direct approach and kindness in her voice, she began.¬†"Last week we talked about taking small steps, making little choices, and being brave as you can while you all get used to this." Sameer fiddled with his watch strap. "Do you remember that?"
His protest was largely ignored. "I'm not kidding." She was sort of amused in a serious way, then pointed at his hips. "Off."
A few hours of sleep and things look well not quite as bad. Rosie should be back today and maybe it will be better this time.
He squelches it, keeping his face neutral as the doctor continues. The science, the explanation, the reasons, all make perfect sense. John just hadn't realised it.
Some of the paperwork, though, a couple of photographs, a few documents, gave him pause, and he reflected on not only how the papers came to be on their desk, but the meaning behind each one.
"They're just such idiots!" Sherlock all but collapsed into the chair, and then slunk deeper in it, ready to launch into more explanations of how they were indeed lucky to have him assisting them, although he wished for some real, challenging issues.
"So can I tell him you'll come get him?" She sounded inpatient and they both knew she had other things to do. "He seems rather contrite."
"Yes I see what you mean that nothing will change. Contradicting each other, making assumptions, and then one of you trying to keep peace while ..."
Sherlock leaned in, closer and closer, until his forehead rested against Sam's. "You'll never, never get away with it." Both of them were chuckling, for different reasons, and John knew that each was issuing a challenge in their own way. It made him more than a small amount nervous.
"Oh I want it. I'm just frustrated that people - you particularly - aren't acknowledging that the safety you seem to be promoting isn't really quite as safe as it could be."
Well-cared for, nails kept short and purposefully smooth, clean, capable. There had been the tiny, healed scarring from a childhood injury perhaps, the calluses on his left fingertips from violin strings, the small indent of the way his fingernail of his pinkie finger grew. These hands, too, had held their share of items, of books, of various and sundry pieces of equipment. More recently, had held John's hands in the sitting room. They'd snuggled Rosie when she was upset. They'd carried Mrs. Hudson's biscuits from the tin to his mouth. Those delightful fingers, a pleasure to watch, a dance of grace and supple movement, could work straining buttons, microscope knobs, send mobile texts, and oh, so much more.
"No." He seems a little mentally clearer, for the moment and the glaze is gone from his eyes. "I can wait."
"Pretty brutal. Some of the nurses were crying, the anaesthesiologist was there, and I was ... okay. It was hard, but the patient needed me to lead them through it. I chatted with his wife, too, briefly. So of course, it's soldier up. Told her we'd take care of him the best we knew to do and keep him comfortably sedated." His puff of air was resolved, a sigh of resignation. "Tried to keep it upbeat, positive."
They'd taken a cab rather than walked on one of their usual errands. That excuse, he'd snarkily pinned on John's advanced age and then abruptly changed the subject to something even more distracting. A red herring - and John had taken the piss. And although John couldn't recall it precisely, he was fairly certain it had involved food.
especially was trying to figure out her request. She'd been planning this, not necessarily as a serious request (although she thought it would be great if they could work it out somehow), but a moment that should take them by surprise anyway. Moreso than the candle situation. "I'd really, really,
For a moment, John watched the rise and fall of Sherlock's chest, subconsciously counting it off, seeing that Sherlock was quite fully comfortable, resting, breathing easily. Movement from behind his eyelids let John know that he was very much still awake and alert, listening and feeling. Sliding toward the end of the bed, he uncovered a leg, removed another cloth, and washed the long, toned leg from thigh to foot and every area in between. He paused at the toes, long, the faint tracing of a few hairs, lightly, gently running the cloth in and between. There was a sharp inhale, a twitching of Sherlock's leg, a pulling away of his feet. He hissed, leg tense, and was prepared to sit up.
Sherlock smiled a bit, the frown between his eyebrows flickering like a beacon. Off. On. Off. On. Waiting until Sherlock's exhale seemed a little more full, John could see the very moment that he figured it out and was ready for more, and let the blanket roll gradually down onto Sherlock's legs, slowly, a sensual pace, settling over shins, knees, stopping at mid-thigh. He folded the blanket then, letting it be doubled over areas already covered, while he used a nearby towel to quickly wipe off body fluids that were already growing sticky. Once he knew the blanket would be safe, he moved it again, slowly, taking his time, until it was up and over Sherlock's waist, covering his hands where they rested.
Absently, John nods and can feel his heart pounding at the thought of leaving the room, leaving the building.
From the opposite pillow, John could almost hear Sherlock rolling his eyes, and there was a mild huff that accompanied it.
John filled out the requisite post-call form, noting some of the phrases the caller had used, the pressured speech, the despair, the mention of a brother and left it in the log book where all the counselors at least looked at the beginning of their shift for unfinished or open calls deemed high risk.
Molly nodded. Although she was not unhappy alone, some company from time to time throughout the day was also a nice distraction.
Rosie found her mobile, tucked one headphone in, settled into a seat close to the fire. When Sherlock also sat down, John closed the book, set it aside. "This was a good idea."
For almost thirty seconds, John is frozen, heart pounding emphatically, wondering exactly which family member he should be more worried about at the moment.
John's mobile buzzed him out of a deep sleep, an odd dream instantly forgotten, into a mildly alarmed state given the late - or depending on perspective, early - hour.
John is kind of zoned out, relaxing in the tall-backed chair at Sherlock's bedside, when he hears footsteps behind him, the greeting of a long-haired woman. "You must be Dr. John Watson. I am Dr. Williams. Marjorie, though, please. I'm with the cardiology group here at UCL."¬†Her hand is long-fingered and cool, her grip confident, both her smile and her eyes bright.
"It doesn't mean it's not either." Dean, the vascular surgeon, speaks quietly. "It might not, you're right. But if I were a wagering man ..."
"Maybe at least more awake, sitting up? Which is why I woke you a bit early. And...." John considers the closet, the bag he'd brought, "I have something I think you'll like."
It is sometimes an unlikely relationship and an unusual combination of instinct and empathy on the part of the caregiver.
John couldn't stop the sigh and the unconscious way his head fell back against the wall with a thunk, eyes closed. Even though he agreed with Sherlock, he felt the need to explain further.¬†"Idiot is another rude word, actually. So take that under advisement that it - either of those words, actually - aren't words any of us should really use."
"Both of them," John adds as he narrows one eye at him, and the nurses comment to each other about something unrelated as they leave the room.
"I would give them a break. Tell them not to be so hard on themselves." Ella's kind smile had been quick and she let John continue with his spot-on self-analysis. "Obviously I'm not interested in cutting myself some slack, or giving myself a break."
Sherlock considered John's proximity, his bearing, his kindness. "Maybe," he said noncommittedly, then belied the statement as he wound the scarf around John's neck and dragged him close.
Rosie, however, is thrilled that they are home, all of them together, and while Sherlock does finally sip at his tea and play with a triangle of buttered toast with marmalade John fixes him, they discuss what the day holds. Rather, John discusses and Sherlock listens. Or pretends to. A home health visitor is confirmed for lunchtime, and Lydia offers to occupy Rosie until naptime with a few outside opportunities - the library, a walk, the park - to give them time on their own.
Made a list for Aunt Olivia, the bedtime ritual. It doesn't seem a problem for me, I don't mind (and I'm used to it), she needs the routine, but writing it all down seemed a little ... I don't know, excessive.
"Wise man," John assured him, still puzzled over his earlier behaviour, but ready to move forward. "I happen to be worth it." He could feel the entirety of his own face respond, giving Sherlock what he knew was a sparkling impish look.
Sherlock was standing, one-legged like a gangly, injured stork, his casted leg stretched out for balance while he perched on the arm of the overstuffed chair, reaching toward something on the top bookshelf. The off-balance bobble was quickly remedied - and steadied - as John crossed the room in record time to grab him about the legs until he had regained his precarious footing. "I'm fine," came the protest but it was a horrific and obvious lie.
Go away covid. The vaccine should be helping decrease numbers but it is NOT and I'm so fed up with it. Please be well, dear readers (if anyone is still there). Be safe, be careful, get vaccinated if you can, protect the vulnerable, and if you're interested, pay it forward with a Random Act of Kindness.
They pass a little bit of time discussing the visit from the interventional cardiologist, that John hadn't been present for, and that there was nothing further that was going to require their attention. Sherlock's oxygen level stays high, but he looks a bit more exhausted sitting out of bed. On a routine check in with Sheila, John mentions that he was probably going to step out for a little walk. "And I think he was looking to get back in bed when you have a moment."
The next few days, John had some serious studying to accomplish for finals coming up, and Sherlock continued to whinge about the discomfort in his calf, about the need for the cane the doctor had insisted upon, and about John being unable/unwilling to entertain him.
The evening found them just companionable, sharing a meal, taking a walk after, and it was along the way back to the flat when inspiration struck John. An item, an errand, a surprise.
Ah yes, the dreaded box of notecards, small ziplock bags, scissors, yarn, sample sentiments, inkpad, and envelopes.  I can only trust that it is a nice memento for families.  [I would have
, John thought, knowing he needed to intervene before anything got out of hand. "Stop it." John wrestled the lighter from Mycroft's hand then lit the candles. Time to redirect things here. "As our first gift to you, we're not going to sing." He slid the cake toward Rosie, grateful that this time he was successful in thwarting the argument. "But happy birthday, sweetheart. I can't believe you're ten!"
His nurse, Ashley, chuckled and swooped in again to rescue the moment. "All right, you slacker, enough lounging about. Your family's waiting for you at home. I hope they don't pounce on the ambulance or anything. Go home, be well, we'll never forget you!"
And as a child, he would not have known the word - but he certainly could grasp the concept, how the little beads of mercury were assimilated, quite attached to itself, drawn tight in attraction. The element was most stable when it was one large conglomeration.
"Okay," Sam wiped his sweaty hands on his knees. "Well, I was wondering if you could help me set up a meeting with Uncle Mycroft."
With a nod, John felt that the little walk had been good. And necessary. A chance for them to speak without Rosie's intrusiveness and Sherlock's occasional restlessness. Or his occasional unwanted commentary. On a whim, John thought of something else related, and asked, "Do you know what any of your names mean?"
So congrats to all who figured out the PFO - patent foramen ovale. It isn‚Äôt official yet, by the way, pending diagnosis through the additional testing. But it is a type of atrial septal defect. All PFOs are ASDs but not all ASDs are PFOs. [Try saying that five times fast]. And yes, it does run in families (apparently more in women in families) so ... well, let's just say that we might need to ambush Mycroft with that in a future chapter.
[And not to be too silly, but ... If only I could work in my all time favourite fandom line - "come on cowboy, let's see what you're packing." Maybe another time then.]
"Well, when I say friend." Chuckling, he positioned a quite realistic appearing human skull at a jaunty angle. "I think it looks ..."
John watched Sherlock blink once, frown, the left eyebrow slightly more furrowed. He blinked again, his head cocked to the side - just like his brother did, but he kept that to himself, remembering that it hadn't gone over well in the past, when he'd pointed that out - in that apparently Holmes' familiarity of an "I'm figuring things out" posture.
Sherlock listened intently as John's footsteps, soft on the carpet and then muffled in the hallway, faded from his hearing. He opened both eyes though he didn't move. The litany John had explained, the counted inhale the slower exhale, were already in progress. Under the weight of the blanket -
"Yes." Smile lines appear, deep and fond, sincere and honest as Sherlock grins down at him. The smile gets a little softer as he adds, "And Mycroft."
Post op was only supposed to be a few hours, to stabilise, wake up from anaesthesia, receive pain meds if needed, to meet certain goals, and be sent to another ward. John's post op experience was typical - "take some deep breaths now" and "this pain medicine might make you a wee groggy" - and he moved through the process without incident.
"Idiots," Sherlock echoed. "Let's be wise, then, in our own little haven, here with Rosie. Ride it out here."
In the past, when John had taken Sherlock to task about the word idiot, usually Rosie picked right up on it and repeated it until bedtime. Tonight, John felt cautiously optimistic.¬†Rosie hadn't been paying too much attention, or so John thought. At the lull in the conversation, when they'd finished and moved on to other things, she raised her hand as if mimicking polite behaviour in school and waiting to be called on, recognised.
John pictured their closets back at the flat, the abundance of shoes, and could easily recall the number of pairs that Sherlock would discard if they were slightly worn, scuffed, or had the audacity to be boring to him.
"I know it was rough," John said quietly, trying not to panic. "All I had with me was a little lidocaine, and a number thirteen scalpel. But the pain was ..."
The shoe selection had been overwhelming, and Sameer had tried on a few pairs, but each time John asked if he liked them, if those were the ones they should buy, he would hesitate, and then slowly shake his head no.
Unlikely Friendships is a book by J. Holland (2011) that cites examples of animals adopting, nurturing, caring, and parenting other animal species. There are multiple examples - apes, cats, dogs, owls, squirrels, whales, and dolphins. The stories are touching; the photos, heartwarming. Sometimes a drastic need (such as being orphaned, injured, or neglected) triggers the behavior, the drive - the affinity, if you will - to nurture, to nourish, to oversee, to adopt. Sometimes just to
"Oh please," she said quietly with a quiet but amused voice. "Rest assured that I give every job my full and undivided attention." She gave him another look, then, one of competence and a strong disposition. "I realise you haven't named your client, but I know who you are, of course. And I know your brother, by reputation anyway, and that he has been a previous target. As have those close to him. I have had high profile clients before, and I have to tell you that if you hire me and, just as a theoretical situation, if I were to find that you are a threat to him, I will find a careful intervention to neutralise
"Include that on the bill. I'll forward it to our chief financial officer over at the hospital. I'm sure they'll get right on that." A gleam in Sherlock's eye, John found mildly concerning, and he studied him a moment with a little more solemnity. "You may not submit it to the British Government either."
John doffed his mask for the final time that shift, placed it using gloved hands into the paper bag then into the bin for resterilisation. Hand gel, a scrub, a replacement of his procedure mask, and another final round of the ICU. It was his usual practice prior to turning toward home. It no longer struck him how many of the patients, on ventilators or not, were on their bellies - proned - as he did so. With no visitors, the curtains were almost always left open so they could see in and out of the glass, determine quickly if something was going on. The patients were most often at least covered in a sheet. But even the ones that weren't didn't even strike him as unusual.
Sherlock stared hard at John, his eye narrowed, but John could see some trace albeit reluctant admiration for what he had in fact managed to pack. The tide of speculation was changing in his favour. With another raise of the brow, his eyes flicked to John's waist, lower, the faintest smile of anticipation on his face. "What about --?"
"Hey," John said, calmly as he addressed the surly detective. "Clearly Rosie and I didn't do this. Greg, neither. So do the responsible thing and take care of your mess."
"Obviously." Shaking his head, John headed down the hall, failing to take Sherlock's hand or even invite him along.¬†"Bed. I'm ready. Sleep, and maybe sleeping in? I‚Äôm off tomorrow.‚Äù
"I want to thoak my feet firtht!" When hyper-excited, the lisp was occasionally pronounced. John loved it; Sherlock not so much. All of them knew but didn't talk about why - that he'd been plagued with one as a child too, and the associations were most decidedly not all pleasant. John still hoped to see video proof of it one day.
Meanwhile, Greg slips the microphone back into the stand, knowing the moment needs no further narration, and adjusts the hat perched on his head as John watches. John picks up his water glass from the table, and Greg does the same as they clink glasses to toast the still smiling photo of Sherlock on the front screen. John resists the urge to check the back wall again.
Rosie is at home, and Molly - with some carefully orchestrated help from their friends and family along the way - is spending the week with her. With Molly's assistance, she calls John on his mobile every night. "Pa, I went to the park, Pa, we ..."
In the end, John dims the light, then fetches his laptop again to put a movie on. "Might as well, I suppose," he starts, leaving out the reason. They both too keyed up to sleep. He chooses one that they haven't seen before, something benign with action and adventure but no gore. "You'll let me know if that feels off again?" John says at one point, a slower scene of the movie. "Sometimes the leak is slow, so you might not notice right away."
, John corrected himself mentally again - listened intently, the question unspoken on his face as he sought clarification. "I have three names, John Hamish Watson. Sherlock has four - William Sherlock Scott Holmes. Rosie has three, Rosamund Mary Watson. It's good either way, and especially for you because you can keep all three of yours."
"That's fine," John said, pocketing his phone as Sherlock came back out, pushing the IV pole awkwardly with one hand while the other reached around behind him to hold the gown closed.
"Oh, yes, silly me. Lucky, lucky me. Collapsed, clot in the lung, clot in the arm, bloody breathing tube, bloody hole in the heart, all of you and your control issues, these ridiculous medications, imprisoned --"
"Oh stop it. You don't need to be a big tough army surgeon right now, do you?" Another moment and John is ready to protest again. "Actually, I don't want to hear your argument. They're going to be a little while then I think they're going to restudy the PE too while they're all there and assembled. There's been discussion of perhaps using some mechanical ultrasound, bit of direct flushes into the clot, see if we can disrupt the fibrin, and
"Here's the form to indicate where to send your pension checks. Sign here on this honourable medical discharge form."
He composed several texts to Sherlock, revised them, never sent even one, and then squandered some time wondering if he was all right, if he was terrorising the staff, if he was going to be okay, if someone was checking in on him. Aimless, wanting to check in by text but indecisive in the manner, and was still floundering restlessly when his mobile buzzed with an incoming text from his hospitalised flatmate.
Sherlock waited, and when several minutes had passed with nothing further being spoken, he did then answer. "I know you do." He spoke quietly, slowly, allowing John a few moments if he chose to speak. "I do too, but it's not breathing down my neck like it is yours."
being the worst parent ever." Sherlock was looking over at them, really enjoying their happiness, the whole manner they were living in the moment.
Mrs. Hudson glares through her minimally-open door, her threat to his well-being as obvious as Mycroft's would have been and the protective nature all but stated. The seventeen steps are an Everest, an arduous journey, and he hopes to once-and-for-all apologise, leave the guilt and the burden and the weight behind. He is no longer able to carry it. This journey to Baker Street, his own Pilgrim's Progress, and it must be done.
Someone draws apart then, or perhaps it is mutual, and before they separate completely, Molly lets her hand come up on the side of Sameer's face, leaving them eye to eye. She cups his cheeks fondly and intently as she holds his focus. They are hand-to-cheek and nose-to-nose, and Molly smiles at him so genuinely and then ruffles his hair a bit as she whispers something else, sighs a little and eases back. Sameer watches her, clinging still with his eyes, as she begins to stand up. After so long on her knees, though, she is stiff and a moment later she chuckles at herself and groans then holds out a hand to him for assistance. Grateful for the distraction, he grins easily back at her as he offers his hand.
Vividly he could recall the text messages he'd exchanged with Sherlock, those terrible moments from Bart's rooftop, the Lazarus reference, the things set in motion by decisions made urgently. Hard decisions, he knew, and this was no exception.
"You. Rosie. Sherlock." John rolled his hands around each other, encouraging Sam to continue. "My family."
John is just clearing up Rosie's dinner of some finely chopped chicken, squash, rice. He has taken to giving her a self-feeder, too, in which he can place various soft foods and she can gnaw on them through the large holes of the finely woven silicone pouch. It keeps her hands busy and takes the stress off him to be everywhere in keeping her hands away from her feeding spoon or sippy cup. For himself, he simply found the oldest takeaway still in the refrigerator that was still safe for human consumption and ate in between talking with Rosie and listening to her ever increasing plethora of sounds and vocal experimentation. Mrs. Hudson has told him previously that Rosie at times sounds like one of those exotic bird exhibits at the zoo with all her sounds, and she serenades him for the sole purpose of getting a reaction.
I think I'm hanging up my writing shingle for a while. An interlude is much needed. (Oh oops, I have one more nearly finished chapter on an existing series.) It's been a great run, a needed escape, and therapeutic. But I'm ready to circle the wagons, lick my wounds for a while, and enjoy reading all the fanfic I have "Marked for Later."
"I know." Mycroft's affect was somewhat quiet. "I came to talk to you." John stepped aside, closed the door behind Sherlock's brother.
"Enough, you," he says when her other hand sneaks up in determination to remove Sherlock's oxygen, and picks her off Sherlock's lap. "Maybe some lunch?"
He certainly can't say since coming home from the hospital, because it started long before that. Since before the breathing tube, the ventilator, the ICU days. John takes a deep breath, cautioning himself that it‚Äôs fine, that things are better, and yet ... "Okay," he finally says with reluctance. "I'll leave you to it."
John rubbed over the palms, pressing lightly into the fleshy vee between thumb and index finger, gently. In this setting, he knew to use varying degrees of pressure, considered that he had very close, in the nightstand, some massage oil, chose not to get it, did not want to interrupt the continual sensations, the tactile stimulation, the attention. Their hands, together, were warm, connected, more than just two skin-covered body parts that touched. It was respect, and commitment. Sherlock's hands - light, refined, graceful - deserved a few moments of care.
office, and you're being gifted a forty-five minute nap here in the luxury accommodations of my couch. We do that from time to time, no worries, okay?" His smile was sad, exhausted. "Right after, I'll be back, we'll finish up here, and make another appointment." John's eyes were already closed, and from somewhere, Ella produced a throw to tuck over him, letting her hand rest lightly over his arm for a moment. He nuzzled into the sensation of the blanket under his chin, the warmth at his neck insular over him, comforting and tender. She dimmed the lights, and ghosted away.
Rosie moves a bit, interrupting, and a noise comes from her as she gets more comfortable but does not fully awaken. It is not a sound of distress, but Mycroft makes a silent gesture to remind Sherlock to be in touch, then leaves.
"Partner," Sherlock clarified, a brow raised and his tone tight. John wasn't sure if he was daring John to contradict him or daring the physician to comment on it.
Allison and John exchanged glances, mostly each querying the other if intervention was needed. John shook his head, knowing Sherlock needed mostly to vent about it. And to put some distance between himself and the hospital as soon as they could manage it. "I'll see you in two weeks. You'll call for any questions?" The question she directed at Sherlock initially, who - as expected - rolled his eyes and looked away. Meanwhile, John murmured in the affirmative.
"Kabul, yes." John said slowly, completely and totally ignoring - but feeling - Sherlock's gaze on him. Instead, he watched Sameer's eyes perk up, curious, as he listened. John continued, "I served a few years in the country myself. And Sameer was born there."
John thanks him for the update and tries to steady himself, prepare himself for more waiting. As the physician smiles and begins to walk away, John catches sight of some ink on his upper left arm. It is military and John notes the man's age, bearing, and makes a connection. "Army doc?"
"I didn't print them out. And ..." he gestured at his mobile," ... I can't exactly show you, but trust me, rule one is no smoking." At the man's puzzled expression, John elaborated. "No shoes, no outside guests was also included. But never-the-less, smoking's ... bad for you."
"... there are groups working there in the country, and making a difference. They fund-raise and provide basics like clean water, healthcare, humanitarian aid, things like that." Sherlock shrugged. "It makes more sense to join a group that's already connected, already there." He tapped at his mobile again. "There are some options. There's still a military presence there. Looks like they mostly want monetary donations."
"She's fine." Sherlock turned the light off, joining John on the bed. "But I think by morning, she's going to have a complete and total redecorating plan for that bedroom."
Inhalation is a very effective means to quickly and rapidly disperse a substance into the body. Large airways transport oxygen along with inspired air, where they split into smaller airways, again and again, each airway becoming smaller. The terminal, functional unit of the lung structure is the alveoli, a bubble-shaped air sac with an incredible representation of surface area which contains a vast amount of capillaries. The alveolar capillary membrane, aided by surfactant and moderated by surface tension, is where oxygen and carbon dioxide are exchanged, all without conscious effort. Higher pressure to lower pressure, higher concentration to lower, the exchange is automatic.
"No, no one will come and take me away. Or take Sherlock away. We are all safe here." He lay quiet, but turned his head so that he could see John's profile in the mostly dark room. He was doing nothing but blinking - and searching for reassurance. "I promise you that." When Sameer was still silent, John asked, "Do you understand?"
"No." Sherlock made a threatening noise in his throat. "No, seriously. I worked all day, then came home to get dinner together, and --"
A few eyes turned toward them as they entered, and immediately John could tell that something had gone on, that there had been some drama or event there that they had missed. Damage control, then. One of the officers looked at him with a faint amount of reproach, as if John could ever truly wrangle Sherlock into changed behaviour or into doing something he didn't want to.
Had John been asked to explain the hesitation, he would have been unable. "I dunno, I just feel kind of bad going out without you ..."
"If he needs it, wouldn't it be safer to simply place the tube and support him? Wouldn't more oxygen be better?"
"Thank you for your service in Afghanistan, by the way, Captain." John could feel his jaw clench, and he swallowed tightly. "Your service record, spotless. Your post-traumatic stress, resolving, or so believes Ms. Thompson, doesn't she?" He raised a brow, glared, and maintained silence. "I do believe that you're improving. In fact, she seems to feel deep down that you're not haunted by the war, you miss it."
It is an unplanned deviation, but Greg hesitantly gets to his feet, takes those few steps, comes to stand beside John who bends to retrieve a small, non-descript bag from the table. Wordless, he offers it out, gesturing that Greg should proceed.
"Oh please." Rosie certainly didn't seem particularly upset; her voice was low. "... and if he went out, his mobile's gone but his jacket is here ..."
John refrained from pinching the bridge of his nose, trying to keep his frustration invisible and his answer something Sherlock might listen to. "All right, worst case scenario? You might haemorrhage to death because you were too lazy to hold pressure on your IV sites, you go back into afib, develop a clot, have a stroke, collapse, unable to move or speak, and end up locked in. That's where your body doesn't respond but your brain is wide awake and functional."
Getting up the steps was ridiculous and by the time everyone was standing around like waiting for me to do a trick or something I couldn't explain it other than that I was very overwhelmed and exhausted and hurting and ready to get emotional. But thankfully Sherlock noticed and threw everyone out and let me calm myself. Okay he sat with me and stayed very close, offered some distraction with Rosie. More, he held my hand while I nearly lost it. But there it is.
And only known by a few, including one John Watson, who had managed to unexpectedly catch her, put the pieces together, and then guard her secret as carefully as he'd ever guarded any other secret.
"Her, by the way, as you are well aware. You mean Sam and Rosie's fur-sibling?" Sherlock teased, laying it on thick. "Remember when you insisted on being present when ... they
"Oh god," began the clerk who'd taken the call. "They were only playing football, an abandoned field." The set-up unfortunate, paving the way for the bad news. "Landmines. Couple dead. Heard Miller ..." the words trailed off, and any way of finishing that sentence was awful. John could feel the first twinges of nausea at that thought, quite unpleasant indeed.
"Just stop it." John crosses to Sherlock's bedside, takes Sherlock's index finger firmly and places the still offered oximeter probe on it. "We'll never know about weaning the damned oxygen if you don't bloody cooperate."
He describes the small hole succinctly, factually, citing some brief statistics as well as prevalence. He explains the dangers of leaving it untreated now that they know it's there. "I would be making the assumption that you do want it fixed, Mr. Holmes. I mean, correct me if I'm wrong, but your livelihood depends on a significant intellectual advantage." Sherlock glances at John then back at the doctor. "Yes, I know who you are. Read about your ... adventures a few years back. Follow the blog. I would hate for you to risk having an actual stroke, for someone so brilliant and so young, am I right?"
This time, John could see the faint smirk, the pleasure, the satisfaction just begin to play around the set of Sherlock's mouth.
"Yes." Another few minutes passed, and John closed his eyes, aware of the warmth and the lateness of the hour. Their hands, still very lightly clasped, were relaxed and comfortable, with one or the other very slightly moving, shifting, squeezing just a little.
The sigh evidenced by substantial movement over where Sherlock's chest lay under the blanket was not quite audible.
Sherlock leaned close, pressed the back of his hand to John's forehead, then over his ear, then into the side of his not-quite-all-buttoned up shirt collar. John pulled away abruptly when Sherlock's hand touched his neck. "My mum used to at least kiss the side of my head, when she was checking for fever." They met eyes, holding. "I don't have a fever."
Momentarily, John considered their paths - Sherlock with his substances and brushes with overdosing, his with vocation changes and unexpected depression - and that things were just so much better. They were healthy, they were improving, and there was hope for bright tomorrows.
Moments later, the tube is out, the face mask is elasticked behind Sherlock's head. They watch closely, those first breaths without machine assistance, listening for wheezing and stridor, thankfully hearing none. "Tell me your name," the respiratory therapist says to him, which is almost industry standard to assess vocal cord function after tube removal.
Their knuckles brush, and this time, his fingers seek hers, rolling, familiar after many years of this very position, this intimacy. His ankle is stiff, an old injury, shoes worn thin, exchanging the ties for slip-ons, still leather because he prefers it, his cardigan buttoned up, and they watch a family, a dog, a runaway toddler, London life. So many changes, traditional to modern, expensive to exorbitant, staunch to tolerant. A couple of bright-eyed tourists, backpacks overfilled, stand to look at the central fountain, old concrete stained with the years and the weather and the erosion of limestone, water, elements, and wind. Their steps slow on the path, listening to the other people comment on the beautiful walled-in park tucked away, how old things look, how they were so pleased the rustic, aged,
By this time, John can see them, and Sherlock is sitting up in the bed, his head on a pillow, gesturing with both hands. He is wearing an oxygen mask again, but his colour is good. John meets them in the hallway, relieved, his hands coming up to one of the siderails, claiming his territory, or helping perhaps. Rob has one eye on the portable monitor, which John can't see, and he finishes pushing the bed into the room.
"I'll go with you." John makes a face. "I'll come back with you too. Promise." John tilts his head, narrows an eye, knowing that to be a lie. "Well, maybe." He tries another tack. "Rosie needs me, I'll cheer her up."
John smiles more broadly into the darkness, looking forward to what he thinks should give Sherlock some much needed relief. "Turn," he says quietly, pushing very slightly against Sherlock's arm, guiding him over on his side facing away. He tucks his own pillow a bit higher, slides just a little closer before working his fingers just faintly on Sherlock's neck. His fingertips are exquisitely gentle, simply using light touch on his neck, then moving slowly, massaging in drawn out circles, working the smallest bit at a time. His shoulders are not as tense as John is expecting, and there is the faintest humm of approval deep in Sherlock's throat, however, an indication that he likes it, and perhaps is agreeable to more.
"Well, that was unexpected," Mycroft said, a touch amused and entertained, particularly at Sherlock's little mishap, where a bit of melting candle wax did drip into his finger. It was in his mouth in a probably vain attempt to cool it down. "Serves you right, I'm sure," he muttered. "For all your brotherly concern and your threats and your being a terrible role model." Despite the juvenile barbs he tossed out, he seemed quite righteous.
This from the man who just yesterday was winded in the hallway, but John doesn't remind him. "No." John folds the gauze again, presses hard, with his thumb this time, trying to get more comfortable. "Next demand?"
His eyes rest closed, his face mostly relaxed unless someone is rendering care or doing something. His lower cheeks, his jaws, are mostly obscured by an endotracheal tube holder that adheres over his upper lip and is velcroed in place, secured around the back of his head. His mouth is unable to close, and his lips are dry except for the occasional bit of saliva that pools at the corner of his mouth opposite the breathing tube until one of the staff members suctions it gently. There is a piece of flesh-coloured fabric adhesive wrapped around the base of his earlobe with a glowing red light underneath, measuring pulse oximetry levels. Ear lobe, John figures, because one of his hands has no pulse, no arterial signal at all, and the other can be kept free for ... everything else. The reading, his oxygen level, is barely ninety, which is better than it had been, but should be greatly higher than that.
So does that mean you are willing to risk getting a virus? Of which we know very little about the long-term effects and potential future health issues. And we're just talking about the survivors here, the fortunate ones. We do already know that some are long-haulers and even months afterward, are suffering from permanent, debilitating lung damage. Of psychological issues from stress of disease and isolation. We know there is heart damage, stroke, increased clotting problems. But for a virus that has been around probably slightly more than 13 months, we just don't know. So if you claim that risk from the vaccine is why you're not going to get it, at least acknowledge that by doing so, you are indeed risking something that almost certainly
"Feel." John held out his wrist, waited for Sherlock to catch on. Once Sherlock had reached out for his wrist, located his pulse point, John lowered both of their arms so that they were relaxed by Sherlock's side, resting on the bed.
"Little sleepy." They both stared at the monitor, seeing Sherlock's respiratory waveform grow shallow and then stop. John gave his elbow another slight shake, and Sherlock took a mildly deeper inhale and then grew shallow again. "I would hate to reverse this."
John couldn't resist, as the car pulled up alongside the kerb, picking at the scab just a little more. "Although, come to think of it, Mycroft might like the performance. Maybe we could add another ticket for your br --?"
The week is getting away from me, and next week ...well, already looking like it's going to be a mite overwhelming.  Hope this isn't too rough. But it's now or never. Or so it feels.  Thanks for not giving up on this story and for reading along - you're all just so wonderful.  Thanks to those who so gently point out something that slipped by me - and as usual, please let me know if I need to clarify something.
They continued needling each other for a few moments, and John made a valiant although only partially successful attempt to tune them out.
He glanced around their newly leased flat, which was still full of boxes, half-completed moving in, but it had only been a couple of days. It was in prime location central London, secured by Sherlock's brother and lovingly attended by the landlady downstairs. The whole landlady dynamic was still a mystery, she spent much of their first few days meeting with barristers, once with both Mycroft and Sherlock reviewing something or other that John was very much excluded from, and this was the first day she was home. Given that she hadn't really stopped whistling, humming, or singing, John figured that whatever meetings had ended in a spectacularly positive outcome. And she was occasionally singing loudly enough to be heard over the hoovering, so clearly it had been good news indeed.
John immediately begins to tick off diagnoses, from Factor deficiencies to blood dyscrasias to leukemia or something else entirely with oncologic origins. He knows that haematologists are almost always also oncologists and finds it distracting that the doctor only identifies one speciality.
"Nope." John wonders at the triple therapy, all of them necessary, and knows they will make a phone call to Sherlock's physician in the morning. "Not without blessing of someone with more authority than me. But I seriously doubt you'll be taken off them completely. They all work in different aspects --"
John drew back just slightly, feeling Sherlock do the same, and his hand slid up along Sherlock's jaw, holding, enjoying the closeness and the moment and the realisation that things were changing. His eyes drifted down, seeing Sherlock's hand and his wrist - and the bandaid and the bruising from IV sticks and lab draws. It sobered him up, more aware of the timing and what Sherlock (and what they both) had just been through.
John leaned in, ready to take this to a personal level. "I would have been thanking my lucky stars for my injury to only have been temporary."
John entered their bedroom, expecting to find a disastrous mess, something very amiss, but the room was clutter-free and not the fallout zone he was expecting. A decoy, then, John realised and he'd taken no more than one step into the room when a warm body pressed against him from the back and soft lips nipped at his ear. "Thank god. I thought she'd never leave."
She pushed past the attitude. "If you're interested, there's also some wearable devices that track atrial fibrillation. Apple makes a watch, but there are others if ..."
John doesn't want to answer out loud, feeling that the quaver in his voice will totally betray how terrible this is to watch, and not just the procedure, but with Sherlock in such grave condition.. He nods and forces himself to look away from Sherlock and over at the kind nurse who was there not only to watch as he had claimed, but to support him. A small smile of gratitude passes between John and Rob, and they both turn to look then at something Marjorie is pointing out, an incidental comment on one of the images. After she withdraws the scope, and at this point Rob comes close to suction Sherlock's mouth, anaesthesia disconnects their IV line, respiratory does a vent check, and the pillow is removed that had been log-rolling Sherlock into position.
John couldn't quite stop the slight twitch of his mouth as he tried not to laugh, confirm, or deny. Instead, he offered a diversionary sentence,¬†"It was a nice afternoon." Sherlock had apparently wanted a confession, so John suppressed a grin and added, "Sameer enjoyed that very much I think."
Dinner was served al fresco, by the fire, interspersed with laughter, and music, and silliness until finally, as they'd done every year, John dug out toasting glasses, sparkling cider for Rosie, prosecco for he and Sherlock. They knew, as was also the usual, that he would have something to say, and so Rosie sat back, her eyes bright and big. Sherlock also watched, patiently waiting, an eye on his beloved family. And probably something still smouldering curiously in the glowing ashes.
"Tomorrow." The doctor could tell that Sherlock wasn't prepared - at all - for that news. "Maybe. Provided he's stable. And that the head injury, the dehydration has resolved."
The marriage certificate had been all duly signed, registered, witnessed. Rosie and Sameer had signed it during the ceremony too, underneath the actual legal witnesses. John smiled at these papers, remembering, enjoying what the paper represented. He and Sherlock, with their own twisted histories together, had also journeyed a few challenges along the way as Sameer got used to the idea, and although they'd tried to keep the ceremony and celebration low-key, for the sake of both kids and their small circle of very important friends, it had grown a little bigger than intended. A little party, dinner and cake. Mrs. Hudson clinking on a glass with a spoon to make them kiss. Exchanging rings. Molly and Greg having a debate on who knew about it first. Mycroft gifting them a honeymoon getaway trip. Rosie in her bright blue dress. Sameer looking dashing in a suit that Sherlock helped him pick out. They had come a long way, all of them.
Sam smiled again, broader, an excited expression. "Yeah?" His mobile buzzed then from his pocket, and he removed it to check the screen for the incoming call.
"I'll tell you when you're more awake, otherwise, it's just repetitive and I'll have to keep on telling you."
"... to witness this. Your undoing, brother mine. Your comeuppance." Mycroft leaned back, hands in his pockets, completely entertained. "I wouldn't have missed
"I know you're awake," Sherlock's whisper is low, a little gruff, his voice rough from nighttime underuse.
"Remarkably well, yes." His long fingers traced the edge of the tea mug, idly, his attention vacillating between the tea, John, and the candle-flame that pointed steadily upright. "I ... it's been a rather long time since ..."
"Still, you could have unleashed the beast of Sherlock Holmes on him, on all of them actually, and you didn't."
"I guess, yeah." His brow was still a little furrowed, but he made an attempt to restate the meaning. "One only helps for a little while. The other, for longer."
The IV nurse arrives, pushing a small wheeled cart with supplies on it, and labours a bit finding a suitable vein to replace the IV site, which she agrees with the primary nurse that it isn't going to last much longer. "Hopefully," she says once she's finished, the dressing marked, a stretchy white tube placed overtop all of it, "this will be the last site you'll need before getting sprung."
Time passes slowly, with neither of them speaking overly much, and the nurse calls report and then shortly after that, John follows the staff pushing Sherlock's bed, delivering him back to the ICU. There is another hand-off, the dressing is checked along with pulses of his feet, and a targeted neuro exam. As has been the case previously, Sherlock's nurse performs a thorough assessment including the neuro exam that Sherlock had fussed about so much previously, although this time he is mostly just flat and a bit caustic. She pulls a computer to the doorway so she can fill them in on the expectations for the rest of the afternoon and evening, reviewing post-procedural orders with them. "No stress on the groin puncture site. Bedrest, with the head of the bed elevation no more than thirty degrees, which it's at now, after four hours, you can sit up more. Perhaps, as long as six hours have passed and the site is okay, if you're feeling adventurous, you could get into a chair around dinnertime."
PAPR - powered air purifying respirator.  It's a self-contained air pump with a filter that keeps clean air flowing under a hood (either a helmet type or a whole upper body type).  It's suitable when the risk of droplet contamination is high, like intubating or bronching a patient.
The other day, he'd wiped them down and worn them home by accident. Oddly enough, Sherlock hadn't mocked him about it.
"Exactly, because explaining something to you is more important than winning this battle between Sherlock and me."
The eyes are still watching him when he checks again, and although the anaesthesia apparatus obscures some of his vision, the comforting competence of the eyes stay on him.
His attitude spurred John to a blunt statement. "You have two legs and I presume you'd like to keep both?"
"Tomorrow morning. Discharge criteria. You had a tube down your throat a few hours ago, two procedures, and quite a bit of sedation. It's another way we can be sure it's safe."
He got up, his bare feet cool on the threadbare carpet. The desk loomed, his skin tingled as he got closer, and from the desktop he picked up the business card Ella'd pressed into his hand -
"Depends on what they find. And the vascular surgeon will be out to talk to you, or if the a-gram is soon, he'll see you in the department. But a plan is going to have to wait until they see where the blockage is. And how extensive it is." Rob goes on to explain that sometimes the clot can be retrieved, or they can place a stent if the artery is narrow, and sometimes a combination of both, again, determined by the findings of the imaging studies.
In an attempt to clear the obvious fog of sedation, Sherlock blinked a few times, slowly. "No, actually, I'm fine. Take me home now."
"It's not bad. Touch of ... I don't know. Probably aggravated because I'm wearing a mask - and an N95 much of the day - for my entire shift over there."
"Nothing." Sherlock's deep sigh was punctuated by his leaning his head as far back as possible and closing his eyes. "They took me off the monitors early, hoping to get rid of me I'm certain."
piss off." John rolls his own eyes at his own terribly lame, unoriginal banter, presses onward before Sherlock retaliates. "Stop. So, there's a reason you know. Blood pools dependent as you're laying," John stands up in front of him, trying to be casual, truthful, and explanatory. "So changing position'll take a few minutes for your lungs to figure it out. Equilibrate, or compensate, as things shift around in your chest." Questioning pale eyes seek John's face, probably looking to determine the extent - and the truth - of how much John is disclosing, and John can't help the smile. "Give yourself a minute, it'll get better, and some light activity should help," he says quietly, his encouragement stretching into stillness, waiting, watching, the togetherness helpful. Sherlock's breathing does actually settle down, become a little easier and more relaxed. John is struck again:
A/N: As a frontline Covid ICU nurse, I signed up reluctantly to help with our vaccine program and I'm so glad I did. It is both hopeful and satisfying. I know we will be seeing the virus for months yet, but this really does feel like the beginning of the end. It is good - and settling - to be an active part of the solution.
For a few moments, there was quiet, and then Sherlock said softly, "The transport is not supposed to fail. Not like this. External forces, maybe. But not ... just decaying."
"No, it's okay. I don't really need them." Looking down at his own trainers, just regular court shoes and wriggling his feet inside of them, Sameer asked with a curious expression.¬† "These are all right."¬†John watched Sameer's eyes flick between them and then to the bright red sales price tag before shaking his head. And something occurred to him, and he realised a possible reason why Sameer was being so reluctant.
"I don't suppose I'll be chasing you, or running off, if that's what you mean." In the flickering light of the candles, John watched the man, seeing signs of impending shock just given his colour, the obvious blood loss (which had slowed quite substantially, thankfully), and overall demeanor. The tone he used was weaker, somewhat flat, despite the attempts at humour. "Pain meds in your kit?"
A chuckle, a sigh, a moan, a whispered breathy 'yes,' and moments later the snick of a bottle, heavier breathing, and the rustle of the mattress as they moved together. Muscles flexed, the slip and slide of skin on skin, interspersed with the occasional snog, an encouragement, a responsive moan of pleasure. A little later, Sherlock stretched one arm up over his head, his back arching as he watched John get dressed - again - his body sated and relaxed. With shining appreciative eyes, he tucked the duvet up under his chin, blinking slowly, as John returned to him for a soft kiss against his temple, his curls. His eyes drifted closed but the smile remained.
And not that it matters too much, but David Garrett is a real musician (violinist) and is indeed quite handsome.
"You got checked off on central lines?" The doc was asking, and John nodded, the itch under his skin of knowing his role, helping. He knew that his muscle memory, the technical skill learned in medical units in Afghanistan, the hospitals before and after, where he'd risen to the occasion. This first several would be very intentional, a by the book recall of procedure, of detail, deliberate and methodical; subsequent ones, also by the book of course, but more natural. "Triple lumen kit's on the counter, if you're interested. IJ or femoral, your preference." At his nod again, the tech arrived at his elbow, N95s in hand, holding out each box for him to choose his size. He waited at the doorway, knowing that while the line was important, the airway trumped all of it.
John knows what he needs to do, and makes a self-deprecating noise, puts his face in his hands briefly. "I think," he begins, with an attitude as if he's just now realising, "I may head back over to the hospital for a little. Watch a movie or something with him. He's terrible company right now, but, well, I guess so am I."
"Yes. And there can be a car seat for Rosie, as we had already discussed." Mycroft, while they had been in the waiting room, had asked John for permission to arrange for a short term, temporary au pair that would care for things, keeping Rosie at her own home on Baker Street and be available to free up John to be in the hospital if needed. They hadn't reached a decision earlier, so Mycroft reminds him, "Just say the word, and I can ..."
I understand the valid concern that the vaccine hasn't been tested in the usual way over many years. But the two largest Pharma companies in the US have a combined total of over 74000 patients. Not one death. Extremely high protection. A very small number who got a mild case of the virus (not from the vaccine).
Sameer gathered himself, and John could see the hard swallow, the anxiety in his countenance. His eyes glittered, wide and worried. His frown deepened. "Will someone come here, and take you away too?"
Oh the frustration level, the impatience, waiting for progress, longing for something (and someone) that is (momentarily) out of your reach.
here." With a roll of his eyes, Sherlock made a face but didn't respond. "How is that job coming along?"
John answered the knock on the door. Rosie and Sam were still seated at the table, finishing lunch. Sherlock was out. "Yes?" he said, still in the process of wiping his own mouth on a napkin, getting rid of the remnants of his own meal. He opened the door more fully to find two visitors, a woman standing there, a man next to her. She was older, trim, and stood boldly. She wore a long skirt in dark brown with a matching long-sleeved jacket, a head scarf, understated but elegant jewelry. The attire and skin tone, that of a Middle Eastern complexion, with dark hair pulled back.
John opted to end the stand-off. "It's probably got something to do with y-site compatibility, likely the pH of either or both medications, sometimes it can form some precipitate and then won't work as well at the cellular level."
"You mentioned this, all the things we can't do regularly. So given the lack of children present, I could also tell you that once we're away from all this traffic, if we were to find, for example, that the roads are mostly deserted." Sherlock hesitated, watching John swallow, his expression sort of amused, kind of pained, and very interested. "No one will notice if my head were to disappear from view."
But he'd missed it and entered the room to find something of a surprise. Inside, laid out across the conference room table, were large bins, decoratively wrapped. On the front, each of the Covid Units were clearly and professionally printed in bright colours. Across the top edge, the simple words, 'THANK YOU!'¬† Inside were small gifts, hand lotions, water bottles, socks, trinkets, notecards, chapsticks, and in one, an assortment of various leggings. Everything was individually wrapped in original packing. Behind each tagged bin were other boxes:¬† food, snacks, gift cards, beverages, crackers, cookies. On the far wall, a list of hot meals, cold treats, baked goods that listed the donor, target unit, as well as date and time of delivery. At first blush, there were two weeks at least represented there. Molly's eyes were wide as she looked back at him. Perhaps it was the clandestine nature of what she was doing or the look of concern, but John connected the dots immediately and gestured reassuringly.
" ... and once we released the clamps - you know, we place them so the patient doesn't bleed to death - and the blood flow was restored, there was not even a speck of leaking. And the liver pinked up right away, it felt ..." John was relating a small piece of his day; Sherlock was oblivious. "Are you even listening?"
Sherlock's voice was very calm, matter-of-fact. "I asked you something. I asked you not to touch. It's not okay for you to keep doing that."
- his last vision tunneling the oxygen mask, the aseptic ceiling, the capped and masked personnel, the cold scrub on the skin of his upper chest and shoulder, the activity on surgical fields being prepared.
John is holding his breath just a little when Molly presses up to a kneeling position and her hands draw Sameer up to his feet and then into her arms. Even from across the room, the men can see that Molly is being so cautious, tentative, and gentle as she leads Sameer into her hug. Slowly, she adjusts her hands, tucking Sameer's head into the warm place under her chin and he just melts against her. His arms are tight, and the seconds tick into minutes. And then they just sort of suspend, comfortable, unrushed, peaceful.
"So," John began, "we're going to take a little drive over to the hospital, so they can take a look at your stomach. See what's going on. Get you feeling better."
Mycroft finds something interesting on the floor to study, then, and John knows he needs to speak up. He makes sure his tone is soft, genuine. "It must have been awful, before." He considers the timing of this last relapse, with Culverton Smith and the downward spiral that Sherlock had been in. "I'm sorry I wasn't more involved then." That time had been a dark place for John then, too, his own struggles as a newly widowed, single parent, his guilt. "But we are on it. I'm not going anywhere." Sherlock's eyes turn questioningly toward John, and they hold for a few seconds. "I'm rather invested."
John hedged, the room light enough to make out Sherlock's gaze, his eyes open, blinking, the silhouette of his head against the pillow. "Have you been awake long, wondering about this?" It seemed to John an odd thing to be focused on. "Because going on holiday sounds ... nice, actually, if it's something you'd like."
John's first thought was slightly troublesome, wondering if he'd been in contact with Dan over the past week or so that would elevate his own risk. Quickly, he tabled that thought.
carrier can be and the exact mechanisms of asymptomatic transmission, but we do know that it happens before anyone starts feeling poorly.
He wouldn't tolerate the turn, the activity. And it would actually be quite detrimental at this point. Sherlock has already depleted most of his oxygen reserve.
While John did miss her, he also enjoyed not having to share the room with her, not that she was a problem, but it was a nice change. They'd erected a divider of sorts, two dressers down the room center which effectively split it, and they'd grown quite accustomed to co-habitating. It had worked for so long that neither of them minded it. It just was.
The moment drew out and as John's own pulse rate slowed, he could sense the need to move on. "I'll see you in a couple of hours, yeah?"
"Better, I hear." As she had done the previous day, she takes a thorough tour of the room, the IV pumps, the ventilator, the monitor, and then turns to assess Sherlock, listening, feeling, and watching. "So."
The monitor alarmed all over the place, heart rate high, blood pressure in the sixties, oxygen level finally approaching 90. "Hold still, need to get another IV in." A little later, "Great, we're in, grabbing some lab work. Recent travel?"
Sherlock's gaze snapped instantly on John, who could feel the defensiveness rise. "I was going to tell you. It's not official, yet."
"Went to get him." She tapped the paperwork in her hand. "Room was empty. I rather thought he'd come to find you."
On his feet instantly, John helped him untangle, pulling up the covers for him and freeing the IV from where it had snagged in Sherlock's patient trappings. From there, he eyed up the heart monitor, telling Sherlock that some improvements had been made in rate, but that it was still irregular. He was just relating that his blood pressure was up in part because the rate had slowed and the fluids had infused when Sherlock held up an annoyed hand.
"I think they were going to consult cardiology. And yesterday Kathy, Dr. Nguyen, said she was contacting a haematologist?"
Sherlock had his mobile out, the app open, and he flashed the screen at John so he could see. "There's an Uber driver only a block away and available. Okay?"
"Home. He and Greg are reviewing some miscellaneous things. He's fine." John frowned just a little at the slightly altered truth. "Well, getting there. Still some, you know, breathlessness at times. Especially with exertion, climbing the stairs. But improving."
The previous evening, after Sherlock's meltdown of sorts and John's return to his room to say a more proper goodbye with his lips, his touch, John leaves the hospital with the distinct knowledge that he will be so relieved not to have Sherlock here any longer, that he is medically endorsed as well enough to be home. With him, and Rosie, as he continues to recover.
Which was why, when John rose slowly to the surface of wakefulness and tossed back the duvet, Sherlock clamped a restraining hand on his arm. "You don't have to get up, you know."
"You were aware of it last time, over the last ... what, weeks? You felt being out of rhythm." Unrushed, John waited a little before continuing. "I think it's only natural to be a little concerned. A little ... expecting it to recur. Time will help. But I don't think you need to be focused on it. If it happens, you'll feel it."
Funny couple of things, recently. We went for a walk, he and I while Rosie was at playgroup or something, ended up passing an artists shop. We were in the middle of a conversation about something that now doesn't matter, but apparently both of us noticed something in the window, what I thought was a mosaic bowl etched in gold. We both remembered it and ended up talking about it later, how it just sort of reached out and grabbed both of our attentions. So a day or so later, we took Rosie in her pushchair and went back. I was a little nervous it would be gone but there it was still in the window.
"Damn." Sherlock nearly grits his teeth, glares at John, who looks back questioningly and very intentionally, daringly silent. Sherlock seethes, stubborn, and a few moments go by before he finally surrenders. "I ... Can you --?"
pulmonary embolism; massive saddle pulmonary embolism with cardiovascular compromise, cardiovascular collapse, and right ventricular strain,
"Of course not," he blurted although John considered that he was likely lying. "This happens to other people. To the common. Not to me. Not like this."
Sherlock is very quiet, thinking, his body still, his breathing mostly steady and even if still somewhat fast. "Earlier today, the nurse said something about other people with this ... event, the clot ... not having good outcomes."
It is a well-orchestrated travel by bed, with the vent, the monitor, the pressure line, all the IV infusions, and the rest of the equipment. They have tucked more things on Sherlock's bed again - an ambu bag, an extra oxygen tank, emergency meds, and Dawn pats her scrub top pocket. "And I have pain meds in case he needs them. I strongly believe in traveling prepared." She indicates the bed, the staff, the almost sense that they are a portable ICU in some respects.
Convalescent plasma. It's a blood product. While the risk of transfusion reaction is small, it can be deadly. Transmission of other diseases is unlikely but it can certainly give you a few days of worry. And the technology of convalescent plasma is not quantitative - meaning one unit can give you a lot of antibodies or a little. Measuring it at this time is not widely possible.
The shower shut off, some hustling about in the bathroom, and footsteps pounding upstairs and then back down. Sam, dressed in his pyjamas and sparkling clean from the shower, came out to the kitchen to tell John and Sherlock goodnight. He found them both seated at the table, his backpack there and open, and both papers just sitting there waiting to be explained.
Trailing behind her was a tattered blanket and her stuffed bunny. The door downstairs was easy to open, hinges squeaking faintly, and she approached John's side of the bed as almost right on cue there was another thunderclap. Half awake already, he breathed deep, rolling over. He gave her a little hug, murmuring something about the storm and that she can stay for a little while. He turned, sliding Rosie, blanket and bunny overtop of him. Sameer stayed in the doorway, and just stared and stared.
The afternoon passes, no further coughing, no blood of any kind, and by lunchtime, Sherlock's oxygen demands lessen. John can see that he is a little fearful of using the incentive spirometre, but assures him that there is no possible way that the remaining clot in the lung can be remotely affected by that breathing exercise. Things seem to be progressing, and Dr. Benton comes back to the room to discuss the plans for being downgraded. By the middle of the afternoon, transfer orders are written for out of the ICU, and the nurse comes back to let them know that there isn't a bed yet, that sometimes it doesn't happen until the following day depending on hospital census. John wonders at the emotional toll of either option. He and Sherlock are both very comfortable with the staff and the level of attention here in the ICU, so staying had its merits. Escaping the critical environment, though, means that Sherlock is getting better and no longer needs the close monitoring. Deep down, while John would like to stay, he hopes for a room reassignment.
Rosie makes a bit of mess, the unwanted and uneaten dinner finding its way to the edge of the floor and Molly rescues it before it becomes a bigger mess.
To the therapist, he apologises. "Sorry. If you're okay if we titrate by those parameters, I'm fine. If you prefer that we call you, I --"
"I can think of a few things. Shall I start naming them?" she replied with animated exuberance. "Keep in mind that I could probably gross you out, considering that I've grown up with all kinds of medical descriptions, not to mention all of the other things in our refrigerator from time to time, and topics that get talked ab--"
The monitoring leads are unchanged but still snake out from the neckline of the ugly-print patient gown, which snaps over the arms. Untied, it hangs low around his shoulders. The cooler arm is still wrapped in a blanket and the white straps of wrist restraints are tight enough to keep Sherlock from lunging for his breathing tube if he were to be that awake.¬† There is a new apparatus on his warmer arm, from knuckles to up over his wrist. Wide tape secures the back of his hand and the middle of his forearm to a padded, seafoam green stabiliser board. Pressure tubing connects from the plastic catheter in Sherlock's radial artery to a manifold, pressure bag, and the entire tubing is transduced to the bedside monitor. The red wave form - systole, dicrotic notch, diastole - blips on the monitor in real time. It is secure, and for the moment, the numbers are within normal range.
He nods at the support, permission, and settles into the raised, tall chair that is brought in and placed out of the way, the opposite side of where the echosonographer and ultrasound equipment will be. "Thanks."
Mutually, they nodded, pressed foreheads together, touching at the temples briefly, let their breathing and their wants settle back down to just simmering.
And then, Rosie was just showing the first signs of beginning to get well, sleeping, her personality re-emerging, and there was a sudden wrench thrown into the works.
She wanted to call. She didn't want to call. She felt obligated - but she didn't reach for the phone, choosing instead to tidy the kitchen as a means to distract her guilty thoughts.
There is another faint nod and the heart monitor alarms again, high respiratory rate, which Rob silences and adjusts.
It changed the direction of John's efforts. "She had dinner?" He managed to ask in between Rosie's bleating.
Sherlock complies, and Kathy removes her hands after a few moments. "Equal," she murmurs, then repeats the process on Sherlock's ankles. She gestures with her fingers to her own wide smile then to Sherlock, who - surprisingly cooperatively - mimics her expression. Kathy then looks to Rob for the answer to her question.
They meet eyes, John's concerned and Sherlock's a bit agitated, but neither speaks about it. "Maybe some tea in the kitchen?"
John knew he was kidding, mostly, but he opted to play along. "Because keeping score is something that's so mature. Good idea." Their smiles flickered briefly, and Sherlock set the warmed up dinner in front of him. "For what, exactly, am I being charged?"
John gestures at where his foot is tapping, his leg quivering, his breathing markedly exaggerated as he just needed to move. "It's like you're a kid with ADHD."
John puts two and two together and finds that it equals the nurse having called Mycroft anyway, even though he'd claimed it was unnecessary. "I'm glad to see you. But they needn't have called you, and ..." he gestures toward the desk, conveying that he wants and needs to stay close by.
"Trust me," Sherlock said, shifting and reaching a long arm behind him to turn out the lamp. "As much as this was, they'll notice."
"Concentrator, instructions, cannula, tubing, monitoring equipment - a pulse oximeter, usually - and a portable tank. Actually, looks like I should be able to have the portable tank delivered right to the hospital so you can go home with it directly from here."
"That'll be ..." and John's words sound thick so he doesn't finish the sentence. Lydia nods, a knowing smile about her. "I should call for a ride, I guess."
There was a burst of nerves in John's gut, but he approached the bed, took Sherlock's hand. "See you in a little bit. I'll be right here."
There was a quick rap of the knuckles, and when Sherlock didn't move, John answered the door to admit one Mycroft Holmes, carrying an oversized bag, with handles.
John figured the question was more tame than it could have been. "Depends. Someone sick as he was, probably not too long." He gestured a bit toward Carrie, if she wanted to clarify.
There is a bit of movement at the doorway and a technician comes in with a portable blood pressure machine, and there is stony silence from Sherlock despite her attempts to engage him. After finding his temperature, blood pressure, and heart rate normal, she holds out the pulse oximeter clip, which he stares at for a quick moment, then blatantly ignores.
He finally settles into bed, the environment initially is a little frightening given that there is no bedside monitor to watch. John finds that he can tell just as much by studying Sherlock, his colour, his skin, his work of breathing, and by the time he is ready to go home, Sherlock is worn out too.
"So," John began, helping Rosie down - also done - and wiping her hands before letting her scamper off leaving only John and Sam still sitting. He sighed, took a relaxing moment to diffuse his annoyance, a few deep breaths before speaking to Sam. "What's troubling you? Anything I can help with?"
Cases pile up and because John has landed a per diem position that grants him flexibility in scheduling, he is able to join sometimes. It is one of the late ones, where Molly has brought Rosie back to Baker Street, that finds John holding a sleeping toddler while Sherlock asks a question. He is leaning back into the couch, unwilling to move, unwilling to disturb Rosie at the moment. She is a heavy sleeper against him, snuggly and warm, and Baker Street is oh-so-comfortable, and his flat is terribly far away, a couple of tube stations with a potentially grouchy, overtired little girl.
- until another annoying, downright obnoxious coughing spasm interrupts his deductions. His ribs hurt, in the front, in the back, from coughing and it is acute, exquisite pain at the height of inspiration. When his keeps his breaths shallow and light, the pain is minimised.
"Do you think we can try it?" Her words were carefully inflected, casual but direct. "We'll ask your papa and Mr. Holmes to step out for the first part of our meeting, and then they'll come back in at the end?"
"Yoo hoo, boys?" There were a few taps on the door. "I have dessert for you, made this just this morning..."
"He is." Rob looks between them. "We tell people every day, to take one day at a time. Sometimes, one hour at a time. Not to borrow trouble. So for the moment, we're treating what we can, supporting the rest, and planning to get the rest of the information to make treatment decisions. But he looks more stable now, while we wait." John is pleased that he speaks slowly, as if this conversation, this moment they have in the waiting room, matters. Time is a luxury, John knows, specifically time with Sherlock, and he will never take that lightly again. Rob glances at his watch, at the door, but before standing up, he considers them both again. "What questions do you have for me?"
Later, after they returned home to London, and even for a long time after that, when someone would ask about holiday, or about getting away from it all, mention family demands, both John and Sherlock would smile a very small, secretive smile. Most times, they would exchange a small "look" between them, a query,
John's interjection and the inflection that he does indeed mean it, does stop Sherlock's complaint. "For doing that very hard thing."
One corner of Sherlock's mouth twitched, the faint echo of beginnings of a smile, and he let that convey his answer, his affirmation.
"I'll be fine here, then."¬†John watches them, nearly ready, paying close attention to the arterial line, and finish the task that will connect the portable ventilator, unlock the bed, and all the rest. Sherlock looks the same, perhaps a bit haggard now, his chin much more stubbley than he ever lets it get, but his colour is good and he is well-medicated, relaxed. Speaking quietly to Sherlock, John leans closer, "See you soon." He squeezes the hand he is still holding, smooths the blanket back in place, and watches them make the familiar trip back to the other department.
"And we still have the flat to ourselves." Their eyes met, held. "We can absolutely move forward. Make this evening quite ... special."
"Hurts. Just take it out. Aren't you supposed to be in med school? Any idiot knows, just take it out, hold pressure."
"Maybe I just wanted this call on my history so that my brother will think that I was making an effort."
With an impressed nod, an inhale of being caught off guard, Sherlock read quickly. "An executed agreement of sale for this place. I suppose that answers that, then." Just the other evening, they'd been discussing what their futures, their retirement options, might look like. Sherlock considered now, slightly unhappily, that he'd been set up. And unaware. "Interesting," he noted, with a tilt of his head. "I'm impressed."
"Right, I understand all that. But, what about ... the rest." Molly's smile faltered just a little. "It sounds simple enough, truly. But." She sighed, looked away, awkward. "What if ... I don't want to upset him." Molly had just named her fear, and her eyes snapped back and bore into John's, pleading with him to understand. "What if I upset him?"
"Oh look, Mrs. Hudson fixed that baked chicken dish and that creepy green stuff." Although he didn't take a bite, he held his plate and stabbed at the green stalks with a fork.
Sighing just a little, John realised he was all right, and as he became cognisant of his own smile, his mobile buzzed again as a few more complaints trickled in.
London seems an eternity away. Night sky very different from up here, clearer, more stars it seems. And cooler. Remembering how the night sky looked from the cemetery. And all the coldness and empty ... longing. Funny, it's like seeing that rental agreement, his name there, that he was my alternate contact, has just triggered so much. Wonder what he's doing tonight. Not that I would have invited him (he'd have said no anyway).
"That they do," John said, then, moving a few steps toward the door, he hesitated. "You did a nice job today."
He blinked a few times, wondering what this was all about, a little concerned. Wary. "It depends." At the man's amusement, Greg grew a little bolder. "And what did you say your connection to the company was?"
This patient, Dan, was one of their own. One of the nurses. And John, who'd come to the frontline hospital trenches to help out as the coronavirus was drastically altering the landscape of medicine, answer the call for assistance, was one of the first to find out about it.
Which he does, in spades. With words like haemorrhage, filter mishap, filter rupture, perforation, risks from anticoagulation therapy, risk of additional thrombus ...
"I know. Just ... shut up." There is less energy in his voice, less caring, less ... life. While John watches, Sherlock slides his hand up onto his forehead, makes a face of disgust, and lets his arms fall to his side. "And just ... go away."
"It's still a dark thing to do."¬†Despite his negative statement, he is obviously intrigued. "I want to see them."
For some reason, he was drawn into the mystery, the ... deception. He listened quietly as the nurse shrugged, knowing that the final signature on the discharge papers wasn't mission critical. Greg concurred, commenting that he had just wanted to make sure the man was all right and going to link up with some professional help after a situation like this. "If he rings back," John began and then shrugged as the others listened, "is there a message?"
They watch the kids at the ever-interesting rock wall, the perpetual crumbling and restacking, the dynamic project over the years, and even now, as adults, the old stone wall still draws them in.
"I just called anaesthesia to intubate this one. ABG is shitty, labouring. X-ray the same hell as the others, damned bilateral diffuse infiltrates, whited out entirely."
"What?" Sameer had heard Sherlock do that a few times to other people but hadn't been on the receiving end himself.
John purposefully - and with great difficulty - did not engage. Time passed, his stern expression finally making Sherlock uncomfortable enough (or perhaps, John realised, just bored enough) to look away.
"That won't happen here." John kept his tone even and light.¬†"No. Here in London, in many places now, all over the world, it's not like that. People are ..." John stopped. He did not want to be critical of the viewpoints of countries like Afghanistan and was wishing he'd had a bit more time to suss out how to explain this. "It's different here, in this place and this time. Some families, some kids only have a mama, like yours used to be. Some parents get divorced, or separated, and there are two homes. Some children live with extended families like grandparents. And then, some families have two mamas, or two papas."
"I know," John cannot resist brushing Sherlock's fringe off his face, adjusting the nasal cannula that is tight against his cheeks. "Rest if you can."
"Tomorrow morning. When we've monitored you overnight, ensured the meds are well tolerated, kept you in sinus rhythm. And by then you'll have slept off this sedation."
There was continuing discussion of provider preference of medications, from hydroxychloroquine to supplements such as quercetin and vitamins including C, D, and Zinc. Most of the staff rolled their eyes as political leaders offered unfounded, untried, unproven, and questionable medical advice, particularly in the news that kept coming from America. John and most of the physicians he worked alongside tended to suggest that vitamins, supplements, and the like fell into the "not harmful and possibly helpful" category. All the staff knew that the virus would be studied until the end of time, collated into large groups as research was assimilated, processed, and analysed.
There is a pooling of saliva again, and John takes and slides the suction catheter into Sherlock's mouth, where Sherlock twists his head again, reflexively trying to avoid it, and he makes a loud swallowing noise that is uncomfortable, air rattling, his lips unable to close, the ventilator circuit and the holder keeping the tube secure. "Hang in there, okay? You're doing great."
The puff through pursed lips was rather dismissive. But as John continued to glare, he did huff again, annoyed, and extinguished the cigarette in the nearest sink then binned it.
The giggle in Sherlock's chest rumbled and vibrated as he pressed his body back toward John, getting closer, his intention obvious as his hand went snaking around behind him, also unhurried into the warm spaces between them, seeking, finding, closing, stroking. "Or something, yes."
"No, not necessarily. Getting rid of that ... " John aims for as reassuring as he can be, " ... is probably a very good thing. It's not fresh, not bright red."
I'm really glad I came up. So far anyway, fingers crossed. Hanging out for another few days, some other people to see lined up, left it all kind of loose but that might be fun while we're here.
Over the years, the notifications came sometimes from a hospital A&E:¬† we have your brother here, he's not well.
John's usual litany of greeting her, asking about her day, was interrupted slightly and derailed a little as he caught sight of Sameer's expression.
." The fact that John did sometimes seem to have to parent three children was not lost on him, again - some days it was worse than others - but Sherlock was by far the most skilled at pushing his buttons, getting a rise out of him, and occasionally being too cute and clever to reprimand too severely. Although Rosie and Sameer mostly wanted to do the right thing, to please John, Sherlock on the other hand, enjoyed being blatantly defiant some of the time.
"No, you're okay. Don't pull," John says, catching Sherlock's hand that is again fussing, trying to get at the breathing tube, reaching for his face. "Hang in there." One song turns into another, and for a few moments, John can feel Sherlock's hand squeezing to the beat, his fingers moving in time with the beat, and John wonders if he's working on figuring out the fingering, what he would be playing on the violin if he had it with him. Unfortunately, though, the respite is brief, and he is moving again, and now he is faintly diaphoretic, too. There is a desperation to him now that he is more awake.
He gathers his mental battle gear, the knowledge that today is going to be more exhausting than yesterday, and strides into the room. "Morning sunshine." Both the nurse and Sherlock draw up short at his greeting. The nurse's face is flushed but not cringing at all, for which John is glad, and Sherlock's is smug, although John gets the impression that the nurse is about to change the tides of the battle. "Glad to hear you're being so reasonable, compliant, and good natured about all of this." John sets down the backpack he's brought on the counter across from Sherlock's bed, loaded with a few things that are now going to be used as motivation, reward, and ammunition if necessary, turns to the nurse with a pasted on smile with undertones of apology. "Can you give us a moment please?"
Sam was nodding. "So, yeah, I know this is not what anyone usually does. It hasn't actually been done yet." He could see both of them with some hesitation. "But they didn't say no, the coordinator at school." Sam looked steadily at each of them in turn. "And I should point out, neither did you."
And I hope I'm not reading into things but it certainly seems that there is some I don't know chemistry between us now. When he looks at me, there's something else now. Affection maybe. I think that I almost lost him again and I want. I want. I just I don't know how to say it I want.
"Come here," he said quietly, an arm outreached. He pulled her close, gave her a close hug. "I'm not disappointed at all. This was your first year." When she nodded, he spoke again. "You competed with students who have been there many years, are probably a lot older?" Not waiting for her to confirm when they already knew, he went on. "I'm proud of you. For you. Not because of what you do."
"I think I've already said this to you, but it bears repeating, and then we have to move forward." He glanced at the line, never-ending, eager, socially distanced in their surroundings. A few of the other volunteers, patients, and even coordinators were keeping an ear tuned to their conversation, the uncharacteristic delay at John's station piquing their interest. "I chose to get the jab because I am at more risk from this novel virus than from the few unknowns about this new vaccine. Every one gets to make up their own mind about it." Their eyes met across the table, blue into blue, serious and momentarily unrushed. "So, what will it be?"
Judging by the look of displeasure on Sherlock's face, John hoped that he would be far away from Sherlock when the cast finally came off and he was making up for these perceived hardships and hobbling about. Hopefully.
, the line in the sand of coronavirus, the distinction of COVID19, of the way each hospital prepared for and felt the surge, and then recovered from it, that will never again go away.¬†He clicks one last time, ends on the photo someone had taken of the hospital, the bright yellow lettering signs that someone had done, "Heroes Work Here." It is a fitting final slide, and he leaves it up. The photo is not distracting but symbolises the crux of what they are doing, their commonality, their bond.
I'm sure this has done nothing to change your mind, but I needed to say it to you anyway.¬†So don't be angry with me, we can have different opinions and still be okay.
"I like it a lot," John tried it out a few times, then chuckled, "How does this sound: Sam, clean up your dishes, Sam, hang up your coat, Sam, get your shoes on and get your backpack, hurry, Sam, we're going to be late for school."
"It's fine." There was some relief evident in Sherlock's voice, and John knew that he was anxious too. "And you probably shouldn't kick me at all, I‚Äôm on blood thinners."
"No." He breathes in, wishing he can ease the burden again, make this all go away, or at least make it better. "So?"
From the side of the lobby, Sherlock sips at his glass of ice water as he watches John. There is accolade after accolade, persons who wanted to say a face-to-face thanks, share a memory, or simply approach only to have tears well up -
It changes when John believes that his neck is relaxed enough and just barely works his fingers into the back of Sherlock's head, into the curls.
Soon after Sherlock was seated, John wandered into the kitchen, assembled two sandwiches, and carried them back to the sitting room, where he'd been planning on them eating lunch together in an attempt to keep Sherlock off his tendency toward self-neglect. "Here's lunch --" he began, only to stop almost immediately.
6. Substance use and abuse prevention - Although I will not be disclosing any specifics, keep in mind that there may have been addictive substances in his history and this is not to be tolerated under any circumstance.
The room was already dark, but Sherlock could see enough, and he pressed up on an elbow, coming closer, pressing his lips over John's, teasing with his tongue, guiding with a hand over the angle of John's chin, his foot hooking about to draw John's knee closer. There was great, favourable response to the kiss, as bodies and breathing and hands went seeking and finding and desiring. "Liar."
Later, ensconced with ice cream in large bowls, she regaled Sherlock too with some of the projects, and the only dim moment of the evening was her showing the award she'd won, when her smile faded a little and her carriage seemed tense.
Ryan had been one of the corpsmen in his unit, a hard worker, known and loved by everyone. He'd had his own struggles with mental health, living large, living loud, who occasionally alternated with bouts of down days, of depression. They'd ended up shipping him out of the combat zone, and John'd lost touch. The obituary vaguely cited his inner battle with depression, made a reference to a car accident, and asked for donations in his honour to the Wounded Warrior Project.
John nodded, his smile sad and bittersweet, anxious and relieved at the same time. "Last patient discharged this afternoon. Took one off the vent this morning. There are now officially no more coronavirus patients at the hospital." He could have mentioned the mortality rates, the age associated complications, but didn‚Äôt. They‚Äôd talked about that ad nauseum since it began.
He removes his surgical cap, pulls John's from his head while he's at it, bins them both. He leads him back the way they came not stopping until they are in a small consultation room. Dean pulls back a chair, gestures for John to do the same. "Are you all right?"
"No one will miss me, in fact, getting me out of the picture will make things much better for almost everyone."
"Don't leave me here," the unshaven addict says from his knees, where he has fallen, where towering over him is his well dressed, cross-armed brother.
"This time, yes, I do." He was shown quickly inside, and they took chairs at the plain table in the eating area.¬†"The boy was taken to London a few years back, after Laila passed. The Military Liaison thought he'd been reunited with his birth father, Captain John Watson."
"You're brutal." Sideways, Sherlock's eyes pin onto John, and he launches another volley, one that is more hurtful. "You're
He nods again, clicks the remote in his hand, and there are a few photos. Nearly unrecognisable staff in the ICU, fully donned in PPE. One photo, carefully taken with great protectiveness, of the IV pumps outside the doors, of the ventilator panel, of the blurry, anonymous, unrecognisable patient with lines, wires, pressure lines, tubes, lying proned on a bed under a sheet. He presses the remote again, and there is another photo, this one much more poignant, of a solo staff member taken from the back, surgical cap covering hair, the back of the scrubs giving anonymity, standing near the hospital entrance. The despair and fatigue is somehow fully communicated in the set of the shoulder and the solemnity of the pose. There is a vacant view in front, a mostly deserted street and a palette of gray that unfolds. John remembers the split-second moment when he was compelled to take the photo then approach the nurse, concerned. He doesn't share any of the story nor the way social distancing rules went out the window as she cried over the despair and the loss of one patient compounded by the loss in her own family, the seemingly never-ending patients. They'd talked about staff getting sick but he doesn't mention that here either. He recalls showing her the photo and requesting permission to use it, to safeguard all the details, and only proceeds when she agrees that it truly could have been any one of them in their more honest moments, and that although she is faceless, nameless, she will never forget the kindness of human touch, the way he'd cared, nor the way that connection
Sherlock lets out a bark of disbelief. "If you have concerns, Mycroft, please do not feel the need to go out and consult in the hallway as if I have no clue what you're discussing."
"Suit yourself." John raised a brow as he shook the tissues at Sherlock's mouth again. "But vomiting up the blood you're swallowing doesn't sound like a good time either."
"You'll miss out, then, on the new nail polish I brought." Her voice was full of anticipation and did in fact grab Rosie's attention.¬†Molly held a small bottle of purple sparkley glitter in her hand, and she shook it, rattling the little metal beads inside as they clicked against the glass.
"He's going to be a very popular patient today." They round into his room again, and repeat the process of reconnecting his monitor, switching from the portable/transport ventilator, sliding the IV pumps back into place, plugging everything in, turning the foot pumps back on. Dawn takes a hard look at the arterial line, the IV sites, the infusion site, dressing, and tubings that are still taped securely to Sherlock's right leg. With her fingers and then a doppler and gel, she confirms the lovely turbulent pulse over his left radial and ulnar arteries. John and Greg stand there, trying to stay out of the way, and eventually the nurses are all satisfied and leave the room, clearing a space for John to get close again.
There was a crackling that rolled through and the lights quickly flickered on, waving in intensity, brighter, brighter, too bright - an unstable return then. It was followed by a few rolls of thunder from what seemed all directions. John's eyes flicked over to where the landline hung, where it might be working - at least temporarily. "You really aren't supposed to be here." Raindrops sounded louder, whipping winds outside striking the house with larger and larger pelts, and John wouldn't have been surprised if there'd been some hail mixed in. "If - when - this breaks, you really need to leave."
"Yeah, okay." He chuckles himself, leaning into Sherlock a bit, "Nothing personal, you know. We didn't want a fuss."
Go away, coronavirus. We are tired of your exhausting presence and the pall you have cast over all aspects of our lives.
In the soft lighting, Sherlock's eyes were open, bright, watching his movements with a curiosity, an intensity.
"I don't see why you couldn't go. But I'm not saying yes yet. It'll depend on your grades, and your attitude ..."
John was composing his response when his mobile buzzed again, another text demanding to be collected immediately. He opted for a more prompt response, and dialed.
"In the meantime, the plan is the plan. Wean the oxygen. Out of ICU later." Dr. Benton taps the incentive spirometre. "This will help. Gently, every hour if you can."
Edited 1/6/21 to be stronger and louder for the people in the back:  if you are sick, feverish, coughing, have altered smell/taste, do not under any circumstances go to work, go to the store, or irresponsibly expose any other people to a potentially deadly virus.
The brush of toes on his calf is not the first time he's been subjected to this type of study in the wee hours of the night. Sometimes it is the faint sensation of being sniffed, just lightly, that deep inhale of curiosity, of appreciation. Occasionally it is tasting, the faint warmth of tongue that John only becomes aware of as it cools once he's done being sampled. One time it was quite too much, unexpected, the sudden and too-aggressive suction of Sherlock's mouth over John's pectoral muscle, his nipple. Whilst asleep. The startled and defensive awakening then had surprised them both.
'Soon' ended up being complicated by Rosie getting a cold, during which time all the sweet goodness went right out the bloody window and she was positively miserable. Didn't sleep, didn't eat, didn't want to be held, didn't want to be put down. Hated the violin, hated when it stopped. Hated the cold medicine John brought home, spitting and spluttering it all over both of them when John tried to give it, even using all of his med school paeds rotation tricks. He tried mixing it in with food, oatmeal, jello, applesauce, and once despite all rational thinking that he shouldn't do it, plain sugar for cripes sake, but she was on to him.
"It's cashmere-lambswool blend." The colour was somewhere between midnight and blue heather, and it was particularly complimentary, John thought, to Sherlock's eyes just as much as the coat. "It's okay if you don't want --"
Sherlock growls as soon as he realises what is going on. "If you ask me my name, my age, and what month it is, one more time, I swear I'm going to lose it."
At the apparently not-abandoned building, the scene devolved, deteriorated due to an unknown variable, an assailant, and within a few minutes time there was danger, a chase, a call for assistance. John's knee-jerk response to attempt to render aid, provide help. He'd been close on the heels of one of the officers, neither of whom saw the weakened structures in the decrepit building until it was too late. The floor gave way; they both went down. The first officer suffered internal injuries and already was having a compound fracture of his leg set in the surgical theatre. John had hit his head on one of the floor supports as he fell, plummeting down with a shout. He'd been found unconscious, bleeding from his scalp, his body eerily and alarmingly still.
Squint at whatever details you need to. Be informed when you're ready to make your own choice. Be tolerant of those who believe differently than you but do not let them hurt you. Speak up when necessary. Store employees or shoppers without masks? Walk out. Stay home. If in person meetings are required, insist that everyone wear a mask.
"Rosie's asleep upstairs," she updates him. "Exhausted, mostly carried her right past you." On the little end table sits the baby monitor, the gray video showing Rosie in her cot, her blanket. Rosie is sleeping. Molly‚Äôs eyes cloud with worry. "How's Sherlock?"
Sam had opted to rest instead of coming to the dinner table, claiming his stomach was hurting and that he was feeling queasy. John couldn't think of a time since Sam's arrival on Baker Street that he'd chosen laying in bed instead of joining them for dinnertime.
Full. John considers the word choice, the various causes, the possibilities. He knows for a fact that Sherlock is not hydrating adequately, that his activity levels are way down, that his stress levels are high. "Okay, so, full. Does that mean that things aren't ...
, he reminded himself - held a position in the British Government and that John should make sure to document carefully, take photographs if needed, and to mind both his manners and his steps. The client had refused any sort of video monitoring system, citing vulnerability to security and some sort of reference to an unstable-somewhat-volatile family situation, but had agreed to a few very high-tech, nearly invisible motion detectors. He‚Äôd paid for this private firm, of which John Watson was now a few months‚Äô employee, to keep an eye on things, respond to any sort of activity, and be overall discreet.
A few sentences exchanged, the delving into his pockets, the transfer of his last remaining money for product, and he nearly broke into a run in an effort to flee the elements, get out of the wind, and indulge himself. He would find somewhere private, where no one would bother him with judging eyes, poking their nose into his business.
Glancing over, John recalls that he'd been on one hundred percent, and that the current setting is down to eighty, which is still very high but he supposes the little improvement is better than nothing.
"Look what I found! Why does it look like this?" she says, pointing to a tree with almost a ninety-degree angle in its trunk, several meters of the base part laying almost flat on the ground, the roots having adjusted to a new angle of being tipped over many years ago, the ground quite mounded, and a new trunk angle grows straight up. "It's funny." She stands on the lowest part, her hands holding the upright section of trunk. She looks straight up the trunk, her one long ponytail hanging down low and wafting in the breeze. With both hands, she shakes at the tree, jostles it only enough to very faintly make the leaves above her quiver.
"Give up?" Ella asked gently, sensing that the phrase choice was deliberate. "I don't think that would be a very good trait for anyone in this profession, do you?" In wordless avoidance, John's eyes closed. "Or for you either."
"This is great. My feeling your pulse rate is going to be ever so helpful in detecting it in myself. You don't have a dysrhythmia, so this is pointless."
"So the requirement is community service. Of course, you've picked a community 7000 plus kilometers away?"
Sam shrugged, then his eyes opened wide as he thought of something. "She's not here to -- I don't want to -- you're not --?"
Greg keeps wisely silent as he watches John. And then he mentions, "I can get you back here pretty quickly. If needed."
In the hallway alcove quite close to where they'd entered was a bulletin board, newly constructed, entitled "Heroes Work Here." There were news clippings, positive statements, thank you notes, and some statistics about survival, patients liberated from the ventilator, and a couple of interview write ups featuring local providers and patients. At the far right of the board were photos of the few staff members who'd become sick with coronavirus, those who had succumbed.
, he almost said but the joke wouldn't have been understood at all. "... get into mischief unattended."
He heard someone say, 'now, go ahead,' and it became apparent why they wanted him specifically to come witness this.
Frowning, John hesitated, turning Sherlock's words about. Plans? Warily, he then replied, "What do you mean? I'm not planning on going anywhere. Unless you ..." The epiphany struck hard - Sherlock's tone, his non-verbal body language, connecting dots and jumping to the worst case scenario in his mind. "Oh god, that's it, isn't it? You want us, Rosie and I, to move out, don't you. You wanted to talk to me about it while she was away, give us time to plan ..." He recalled what he'd thought
"Oh god, really?" John whispered quietly as Sherlock gestured to his calf as if hiding something there. The word 'madman' threatened to come out and John held his lips together.
They share a small smile, an acknowledgement of several things all at once:¬† Sherlock was miserable, at least some of the time. And Sherlock was worthy of their concern. Both of them would take Sherlock's demeanour as it was as opposed to ... well, not having Sherlock's demeanor at all.
John said it first, identifying the rhythm that he'd suspected, but there was no satisfaction in being right. "Atrial fib." John was somewhat reassured - only a little - that it was indeed narrow complexed and not ventricular in origin. John knew that it was fast. Really fast. No wonder Sherlock wasn't feeling well, had no energy, and couldn't catch his breath.
"I thought you ... were coming in ... to fuss at me." The patient had been warned the nurses were sending the doc in, and that if he wouldn't listen to them, perhaps he would if it came from a physician.
"I know." John considered the rest of their schedule for the week, wondering about revoking privileges or adding chores as appropriate consequences for this rather slight offense. "So I think tomorrow, after your detention, you'll need to call your football coach and explain why you'll be missing practice on Thursday this week."
"What would be your best estimate of the minimum distance required to fall that would result in a greater than 90% probability of dying on impact?"
Fifteen minutes after that, Rosie is cruising the room again, orbiting around John, and another few texts come through.
There were other times he'd studied Sherlock's face, his chest, his breathing, his body in close proximity. At Angelos, that first night. At various press conferences. In their flat, particularly when he realised something or was ready to launch an insult at someone. The face, the cheekbones, the faint nostril flare with his breathing.
"What's gotten into you?" He spoke quietly, knowing Sameer and Rosie were still watching them. "What is the problem with going to this ... get-together or whatever?"
John pressed his arms away enough that he could see Sam's face, looking intently into his bright, still somewhat tearful eyes. And very slowly, although he was still shaky, Sam nodded.
John contacted Mycroft immediately, relayed all the information that he and Sherlock had available, requesting an update. He extended an offer of medical help if remotely possible. He waited only a day before getting any feedback from his brother-in-law. Although he had indeed found Sonya, it had been unfortunately too late. She had passed very peacefully in her sleep a few days previously.
When he tries, it uncomfortably leads to frustration, with what-ifs, with wishing to turn back time. He is all five stages of grief - shock, denial, bargaining, but very little acceptance, and anger holding it all together. The tube fiasco, the stag-do, the pain, all goes undiscussed. The anger fades under numb scars and they move past; wedding plans and such carry them along under an avalanche of business.
"They should be about done, and then yes of course." He gives John a hard look. "I do recommend though that you carve out time to go home, get a shower. Eat. Catch a nap. And didn't you say you have a little girl? I know it's a cliche, but it's true that this is a marathon not a sprint. And you are exhausted." Mycroft is still quiet when Rob glances over at him. "Please make sure that he follows at least a few of those directions?"
The unit where John'd been working was in flux again. Rooms had been stripped, cleaned, sanitised, cleaned again, from top to bottom, equipment removed, wiped, sterilised, zapped with ultraviolet lights, and was shifting back to care for regular ICU patients. There were some patients already trickling in, filling from the cleanest areas, those that had been empty the longest. Nurses still wore masks but no longer had to don full PPE. There hadn't been a positive coronavirus test result in over fifteen days, and although they were still prepared if one should arrive, the threat was less, the area and community cases nearly non-existent. He rounded on the few patients that were there as he worked, tried to catch his breath, handled some situations, wrote admission orders on another patient, and functioned as he had been for his time there, an integral part of the team.
And he could still remember those breaths of relief, even in the unfortunate event that Sherlock had reinserted himself into John's life, and how different it felt.
John had already scrolled through the console in front of him to find that the incoming number was blocked, not a surprise. "I would like to address your question, though, when you asked for three good reasons --"
John sipped from his own mug and acknowledged, "This is good, but you make a pretty good cup of tea, too." He preened under John's compliment, knowing that Sherlock made a spectacularly lousy cup most of the time (which John thought was entirely intentional), and that Sherlock seemed quite inclined to exalt John's tea-making ability to somewhere between sovereign and miraculous. "Promise not to ask you too often."
"No. Coming back here. Thought you might need your beauty sleep." A wrinkle appears over his nose, then changes into laugh lines at his eyes and mouth as he adds, "I see it didn't help," and he meets John's questioning gaze. "And I did make you a promise."
"As usual, John, yes it was a surprise. But I don't think you realise exactly why. It's not for the reason you think."
Now, Sherlock was all right, having a bit of twilight sleep. But he was okay, and John ran the clinical picture again. Pulse, breathing, yes, we're good.
John startled when Sherlock's fingertips touched his elbow then traced lightly down his arm toward his hand. The sensation was light and tentative.
"He goes by Sam now." For a brief moment, John toyed with the notion of using Sam's full name, as Sam Watson, but didn't. "He's ten."
With a sense of trepidation, John readied himself for a few hours of unhappy flatmate, and was pleasantly surprised that, when he reached out for Sherlock's hand - boldly and confidently - Sherlock didn't complain.
John huffed, checked out Rosie's pink bunny, the packaging, the note, the envelope, and the letters. Coming up with nothing, he gestured back to Sherlock. "What?"
"Long as you need me," she nods, her attention then over on Rosie who is getting into something across the room. John turns back to his tea, enjoying the way Rosie is engaged and entertained.
John sighed, smiled, and then without a word, nodded at her. What he wanted, though, was to hug her for the effort.
John'd never had a hand massage, never a manicure, not in all his years, so he had little to compare it to, but the experience was ... nearly spiritual in nature, leaving him feeling remarkably taken care of, and feeling particularly cherished.
"You aren't alone any more. And you won't be again." John scrolled with his finger on the screen, again. "Khalil in English has a different meaning: friend. You know, a mate. I like that, too."
"Soon as we get another line in, get your blood pressure up with some IV fluids, we'll be sending you for a CAT scan, Mr. Holmes." He explained briefly what his findings were, giving some directions to one of the nurses as well regarding medications, labs, and ordering an electrocardiogram.
"Oh please, your scrub top has a cat pattern on it, you're wearing cat socks. Some cat scratches on your arms, clearly made by two different cats, but you're thinking of rescuing another one." He glances at her pocket, where there is a hand-made flyer, a save the kitty, call for more info variety. "Don't. Two is enough with your long workdays and your going back to school."
Baker Street is oddly alien, too. The familiarity of furniture and scent. Sherlock, guarded, distanced in a manner far exceeding the length of the room. The staggering heaviness of his spoken confession - the near affair, seeing Mary, the oppressive guilt of all of it - surviving, cheating, not intervening, watching in helpless horror. His own abominable behaviour. Yet everything is different, feels wrong, wrong,
"Well, not to make too much of it, but since you left, his Fio2 is down to forty percent. And his sats are in the mid nineties now." She refers to how much oxygen is being delivered through the ventilator, which had been fairly high for a long time, and his saturations measured by pulse oximetry, are now within acceptable norms.
"Long as that's okay with you, yes. I won't be in the way?" he asks, and she assures him with a kind shake of her head that this is fine. John stretches out in the uncomfortable though padded chair, gathers his feet under him. "Haven't seen a bubble study since residency."
"I can't speak for either of them. But I got the impression that Sherlock was miserable company earlier. John came home, made dinner, spent some nice time this evening with Rosie, and then ... well, he started getting all mopey himself, so I may have planted the seed, encouraged him to return."
She smiles, and it is a fond, compassionate smile, as if she can see and sense his fear. "One hurdle at a time."
"Please don't." John's words are unclear, but he knows Greg understands, and tries to will his body to relax.
John was reassuring. "But still solved." Sherlock had pursed his lips, annoyed now that it settled around them both, wishing it had been ... just ...
The question is soft and quiet and sudden. "You've seen a fair number of men die? Not just in combat."
It was all sobering, this ridiculous musing about a personal connection that wasn't going to happen. He imagined several fictional responses. "So sad." Or maybe "He never recovered, did he?" Or worse, "The name is familiar, but I can't place him." "I heard he was alone."
"He charmed you, tricked you, mustered up these false tells." His annoyance, his ire, is palpable. "Just go home."
With jaw-clenching reluctance, Sherlock seemed to surrender, "Not pain exactly." With a sheepish glance at the room before looking down at his hands, he added, "Pressure."
I absolutely do not advocate bringing in alcohol for patients. I do cautiously advocate for the occasional rule breaking provided there is no harm.
Sam's brow was sweaty as John eased him onto the cushions. "I'm hot," he whispered. "And my ..." his hands were lightly protective over his abdomen, " ... stomach hurts."
"Thought I'd say good night to you this way," John reasoned calmly, a little aristocratically, "before shutting my mobile off for the night."
John nodded, grateful for the bit of disruption. "I was going to ring you later." His whisper was even quieter than Mycroft's, which Mycroft wordlessly acknowledged with a tilt of his head.
Opthalmologist evaluation:¬† Due to the nature of small clots that can be clinically asymptomatic, it is recommended that you take special care to have your retinas examined by a professional at your earliest convenience.
She trips over whatever words she was intending to say, and John thinks that perhaps some early intervention is wise. He stands up, slowly, working the kinks out of his back, his neck, and, placing a hand on Sherlock's arm, says, "It'll be fine." His knees give a faint crack and he tries to stifle the groan that he knows Sherlock will only mock him for.
have been flirting, or being interested, but thought that perhaps it had been Sherlock's misguided social cues, his somewhat strange attempt at trying to be gentle before breaking bad news to him. The disorientation of the strange situation, the fact that he was apparently unwanted in Sherlock's bed ...
"Sherlock," John groaned, looking apologetically at Mrs. Hudson, who was smiling fondly and shaking her head at the both of them.
He wouldn't rush. Savouring each part, of the earlier piece of the evening already, the release, the connection, was only beginning. It suited him, more than just another way to feel close. To share something that no one else did, nor ever had, nor ever would.
"Usually the physician will update family in the cath lab waiting room, so you should head over and wait there. That's best," the nurse told John as they waited for Sherlock to re-emerge from the bathroom. It was an inside room, so John wasn't specifically concerned that Sherlock would escape through a window or anything. "It'll save them the trouble of tracking you down somewhere else."
"An ashtray." John couldn't stop the small giggle, and he shook his head. "There isn't one." They exchanged smiles then enjoyed a few minutes of silence. After a bit, they could hear Sameer‚Äôs muffled voice and laughter coming from inside the office. It was a very satisfying sound.
"Not really," and Sherlock shrugs while John fills and sets aside a sippy cup for Rosie, who invariably will want something to drink when she sees the men with tea. "You?"
"What is it?" Rosie demanded as Sherlock unfolded the papers, freeing several other small items. In one hand, three separate keyrings, three keys.
A few questions, a gentle exploring and teasing of details, and Sameer finally admitted, "Mama always said, one pair of shoes. That we never needed more. And I already have these
Shamelessly, John took advantage of Sherlock's shortness of breath and turned his back while he'd spoken to the dispatch, explained the symptoms, given their address.
"Garbed, obviously. An outdoors visit, actually." An outward gesture from Sherlock's elegant hands, very much a get on with it, and John smiled. "To see that nurse, the one who'd been so sick. He's in a rehab, and they're cautiously allowing short, scheduled visits. I think it'd be a good idea. I tentatively set it up for tomorrow. They'll allow us both, but you don't have to. We'd need to be screened of course. I asked Mrs. Hudson if she'd --"
"See, was that so difficult?" John's words were fond and affirming as he opened, drizzled, applied, and set the bottle aside. "We deserve this, the feeling good, you and I." His hand, warm and slick, reached to himself first and then up against Sherlock's body, his fingers paying careful attention, his touch unhurried and thorough. "You ready?"
I assure you, John will have stern words for Sherlock for his absconding without permission from the A&E. And he will be questioning the wisdom of his own complicity.
both did."¬†Mrs. Hudson stood up, smiled at her Baker Street boys, and tried to ignore the impish look that - even in their exhausted states - they gave each other.¬†"Now, off to bed with you. Before you do something that embarrasses me," she said, pecking one and then the other on the cheek. Her hand clung just the faintest bit too long on John's neck.
Mycroft smiled a half smile, glancing at John. "I suppose the doctor spoke with you, explained why you'll be discharged tomorrow?"
John had not ventured into this particular hall, had not seen the board nor the photos, but understood immediately that the cost in truth was immeasurable.
"Kissing." Mycroft stated the word, waited a few seconds, said it again. "Kissing. Talk about bacterial exchange being gross." This, he directed in John and Sherlock's direction, and although they were behaving quite properly at the moment, certainly they had been known to participate in that activity.
She keeps step with him as they turn and leave under somber, gray skies so fitting for their visit: goodbye. The trees and open rolling field watch silently as the people walk. None notice the dark figure out of sight.
He ran a hand through his hair, animatedly, his heart racing as his mind played out scenario after scenario - all of them ... "You're telling me at least
"Okay," Sherlock breathed eventually, then said it again, "All right," in a more settled tone. "If the tables were turned, you would be okay with me helping."
"Patience." He spoke quietly, a guided non-answer. "In good time." He settled himself, not rushing, his voice and cadence, slow.¬†"Deep breath." John returned to his side, the item in his arms. "Eyes closed." His words were slow, deep, and quiet. "Just feel."
"Gotcha day." He couldn't resist throwing the phrase in one last time before moving ahead. "We'll have a special lunch, I think, and maybe go out afterward for something special." He leaned down to pick up Rosie and set her on his knee. "And I was thinking you, young lady, could help with decorations."
John watched Sherlock's silhouette, which didn't change. He felt compelled to at least be polite. "Okay, thanks."
"Not your fault." For a few moments, John swapped out the bloody tissues for clean ones, and then using one hand to wet a flannel to clean Sherlock's face, hand, and then his own. The bathroom could wait. "There. You look a little better." His fingers pressed lightly over the base of Sherlock's thumb. "Still regular," he said after a moment of checking. "Little faster, obviously you're upset."
He glanced at his watch. He was hopeful to finish patient rounds, stomping out fires. He hoped to actually get something for lunch, check in with Sherlock, chat with Rosie before she went in for her nap. "I'll try."
Rob comes back to the room, pokes his head in. "Echo's on their way up. And I have a couple of medications, something scheduled around the clock, a mild pain med to take the edge off, a proton pump inhibitor, prevents reflux and gastritis while he's gotta stay flat." Rob is directing his words to John, to both of them.
"That should do it," Allison stepped back while the nurse removed some of the monitoring, leaving the pads in place. "Get a twelve lead in five or ten minutes."
Upending the bag, contents dripping out, Sherlock stared at the pile of woven blue in front of him, the small envelope stuck at an odd angle. He picked up the envelope first. Inside John had placed two tickets to a LSO matinee featuring one of their string ensembles, that John added on a whim. The other item was the impetus for it, his main idea.
In Sherlock's voice, in his mind, he hears the fondly spoken 'my idiot' and answers back in silent communion 'my genius.'
"Must be the truth, yeah," he utters, feeling the strong muscles of Sherlock's arms again, the vigor, the understated health and strength. "I've missed this." Laughter bubbles out of him at the sheer joy of reunion, of rightness. "Missed you."
The pounding inside John's head was baseline staticky and driving the beat terribly, and the speaking grated on his headache, on his nausea, on even his hair follicles. The sutures felt raw, the area behind his eyes was vibrating, and he wanted,
"Sounds delightful. I think I saw a shovel out back, and perhaps we can go dig someone up, show them a good time."
That demand, John thinks can be arranged. "In the morning, okay." Watching Sherlock breathe, John is quite aware of how comfortable his own breathing is, the deep breath, the lack of pain, the satisfactory oxygenation, the relaxed inhale/exhale pattern. The involuntary reflex complete taken for granted until ... until it isn't. Sherlock's is the opposite - he is tight, laboured, and air hungry.
For a moment, Sherlock watched John look back at him steadily, wondering at the more invasive than usual question and he thought perhaps he would deflect. Instead, his brow furrowed a little. "It's bad." He could have elaborated about any number of things - the daily consideration of ECMO, the refractory hypoxia, the terrible phone updates with Dan's wife, the conversations and more frequent tears from the nurses, the bleak expressions on some of their faces at the suspicion that they were beginning to fight a losing battle. But bad summed it up. "It's going to be hard if ..."
He steps out to the waiting room, gets the full story, and truly it sounds as though there wasn't much more to it, but that Rosie just seems a little unsettled, and Lydia wanted to make sure that John was full aware, give him the option to come home if he is able.
"Are you all right?" John sighed loudly himself and sat up straighter, hoping that Sherlock would be able to tell, to sense the urgency. "Look, I didn't mean to upset you. You're not ... Nothing's going to happen to you, but you know you need to stay?"
"I know. Just --" Sherlock begins and then changes his mind. His frustration, annoyance, and ... something close to despair is apparent.
John's quiet voice was soft, low, and reflective as he answered, "Yes, from the doorway. I can't specifically add anything by being at the bedside." In the dark room, there was comfort and connection in their embrace, and despite the way they were touching, John still felt cold. "And of course he's on his stomach." Sherlock nodded. "So there's a little anecdotal evidence about doing chest compressions while they're prone. In this case, it wouldn't have mattered either way. So we do a little, give a few meds. There's no rescue breathing because that involves taking him off the vent, aerosolising the virus. I had just picked up the phone to notify his wife when they told me she was already on the line. And of course we stopped."
"What do you mean?" He would later pride himself at not overreacting to Sherlock's statement, which had obviously meant to incite him.
"They're still imaging, but I wanted to touch base with you while we wait." He glances around. "Actually, did you want to come to the control room, watch?"
"If Rosie wants bloody noses, I'm growing inclined to give in to that request," John told the room. "Starting with yours," he directed this at Sherlock.
"Most of all, no lying or exaggerating," John added, his contribution just as ridiculous as Sherlock's untruthful diatribe. "Like I've told you a million times." The eye-roll was predictable and giggles were brewing.
John's sleep is again quite light, hearing Sherlock occasionally clearing his throat, coughing a few times, tossing his legs restlessly, or Rosie through the monitor rolling about or sighing. John has no idea what time it is, however, when he is awakened as the mattress jolts suddenly. Startled, he hears a few raspy, wheezy breaths and knows Sherlock is sitting upright. His eyes are wide even in the dark room and he is coughing. The mild coughing from the day before into the evening pales in comparison to this full body heaving, his lungs in spasm, his whole body and chest working hard to breathe, to clear irritated airways.
One of the techs on the floor brings John a cup of water with a straw, and he is ready to review Sherlock's history with the physician, who asks one question and then interrupts John's first answer with another question. "What kind of healthcare provider are you?" Had it been another setting, John might've chuckled - he knows they all speak a different language and of course, here, with Sherlock unstable and tenuous, John is certainly not about to turn that part off.
There are so many things in this chapter that just scream BAD IDEA but ... fiction. And an exhausted author. [Who is again staring effing COVID right between the eyes. Again. Please be safe, and remember those on the front lines. We are losing heart. The suffering is unfathomable and there is a lot of frustration - sometimes downright anger - at those who staunchly refuse the vaccine then demand every experimental med and treatment available. Some of the suffering is preventable. If I were Irene Adler, I'd be begging twice, to please get vaccinated if you are able. And a billion, heartfelt thanks to those who have!]
When Sherlock didn't move toward the bag, John cleared his throat but Sherlock stubbornly remained still.
Her words echoed in his head as he did in fact do a little shopping on the way home. Later, he ate a small lunch while looking at the new accessory to his small table:¬† a ridiculous statue of an upright, leggy frog playing the violin.
Sherlock still needed a bit of convincing, but he did follow John to the door before speaking again. "Are you sure? We haven't left them like this, and ..."
And, given his hypoxia and confusion, ineffective in cerebral oxygen delivery. He and Kathy exchange looks. Unless something changes quickly, they are probably looking at more invasive therapy.
John slides the clip off, hands it back to the technician, who gives him a helpless shrug of an apologetic smile. As she leaves, John takes a step closer to the head of the bed to check the oxygen flowmeter. Still set at four liters, which completely explains Sherlock's discouragement.
John squeezes his fingers, relaxes, but a reminder of where they are, that John is present and not looking to go anywhere. "God no. You?"
The top of the pile was fairly benign, but made him smile at how important it had been at the time, none-the-less.
The first ring barely completes before John answers.¬†"Yes?" John has already realised that something is awry and doesn't mess around with unnecessary pleasantries or platitudes.
The scare has all of them rattled. Rosie, John, and Sherlock, separated by a NHS stickler on next of kin and person to notify and Sherlock's honest disclosure when they'd arrived, no I'm not her biological parent, he's hopefully en route. Rosie's fever is abating, the IV fluids infused and meds kicking in, and her flushed cheeks are less frightening, now that her crying jag is over. They are finally together in the A&E cubicle and the words tumble together.
Both of them watch the slow drip of blood, and then John gives in and reneges with a fresh gauze, his thumb pressing firmly and his hand wrapped around Sherlock's forearm.
The long-haulers who might make it home only to come back with more profound symptoms, with clot, or stroke, or fibrosis. Pancreatitis a few times. GI bleeding. Cardiomyopathy. Shortness of breath was the worst. And god they were miserable and some knew they were dying. Drowning, gasping, suffocating - and no relief in sight.
"Okay," John began, wondering exactly what that meant tonight. "I'll just ..." and he disappeared for the first turn in the loo. He was brushing his teeth when the hair on the back of his neck prickled, and he turned to find Sherlock watching him. "I'll be right out," he murmured around a mouthful of toothpaste, then spoke it again more clearly when his mouth was empty.
John tried to still his mind a bit, be patient, although part of him wanted to pull away in frustration, and he forced his words to be quiet, flat, and emotion-less. "I understand all that." It was why he heard from his co-workers that they didn't often share much at home. Unless you were actually looking at it, living it, shift in and shift out, it was hard to get your head around, the moral distress, the absolute horror of not only the disease but the situation - that the patients were alone and terrified, that the families were home, worried. That even though the statistics and the PPE and the procedures should protect them, the threat still niggled at all of them.
We both lost our mothers. And only people who have had that happen when they were young know what that's like. It's a terrible club with a very high cost of admission. I don‚Äôt say that to be sad but to remind us all that life is precious and things do happen for a reason. And it‚Äôs okay. I really think we've turned all right, not in spite of the circumstances but because of them. Because we have each other. All of the things we go through serve to make us stronger, am I right?
There are a few moments of silence before Sherlock's eyes finally open to find where John is seated, the mug of tea, the room. He inhales, taking it all in, and John watches him carefully as his shoulders ultimately relax, some of the tension leaving, just from his new surroundings.
"I'll ... uh ... be right back. Bringing a candle closer. Unless you know where I could find a torch?"
Dr. Richards looked back and forth between them. "So, we were talking about if there is a clot," and she waited until they both nodded, back on track in the discussion, "we keep the heparin on for another day while we start one of the oral meds, then if you stay in afib, we bring you back in thirty days and do another endoscopy and cardioversion then."
Although both of them think about chuckling, and in a previous moment may have actually managed it, the situation is too sobering, and time passes slowly until John very faintly lightens his touch. Over the course of the next half hour or so, there is no further increase in the size of the swelling, and the shaking subsides. He places a few pieces of gauze overtop of the area, adding a little pressure just in case, secures it with paper tape even as he apologises. "So I'm going to keep an eye on this, next few hours, and ..."
The kid was being detained by the uniforms and struggling now, trying to pull away, to run off, his speech pressured and the faintest bit panicky. He heard a few vague words from his co-workers, something about notifying family, about drug testing, about hauling his sorry arse off to jail if he didn't come clean with how he could possibly have known these things, unless he too had been in on it.
"This isn't fixed overnight. There's still clot dissolving. And clots to be prevented." There is an irked huff of discouragement. John wants to reach out for Sherlock's hand, knows it will not be well received. Not yet. He reminds him, "It's going okay, you know. A week ago, you were on the ventilator."
Later that night, John checked on the children a final time before climbing into bed himself. Rosie, as usual, was all askew in the sheets, her mouth open, her blond curls framing her sweet face. Tucked underneath her chin was the pink bunny, and the soft plush fur moved very slightly in time with her breathing. Quietly, John pulled the door a little more closed before going to check on Sameer. He lay on his side, eyes closed, those long eyelashes catching the faint¬†hallway nightlight. As also was his usual, he had the covers pulled up to his neck and slept without toys in the bed with him. Next to his bed, though, the bedside table had his usual prized possessions:¬† his watch from Uncle Mycroft (complete with some sort of tracking device, John knew but didn't talk about), the photo of Laila, and now, right next to these, sat the blue bunny. It had been carefully arranged, legs and paws neatly in order, ears resting without wrinkle. And out of the corner of his eye as John began to turn from the room, he could have almost sworn that the bunny winked at him. He blinked once, the room remained quiet and still, and he mentally shook his head at his own imaginings. Sameer's door, he also pulled nearly shut as he left, keeping his own bare feet quiet on the carpet and then tiptoeing softly down the steps.
"Quick, go get my meds, I can fix that." There is the faintest glimmer of humour returning, and despite the darkness of it, John is a little more relieved. Again.
Pain, no. Numbness, sort of. Alteration in sensation, yes. Feeling cold, whole body is cold. She runs him through some basic movement tests, fingers and wrist and hand.
From down the hall came the low murmuring of voices. Uh oh, he contemplated, he'd intended to go upstairs. Not Rosie, too early. Perhaps Mycroft? Mrs. Hudson? Greg with a case? He couldn't identify who the other speaker was. Shrugging into his dressing gown and slippers, he checked the time - middle of the night - and soundlessly stepped into the hall.
It was at the beginning of his next scheduled shift that there were a few addendums to the log with question marks. One worker noted that he had several hang-ups in a row and then another call right afterward asking if John was working. A call the next day was similar, in which the caller requested to know when John's next shift was scheduled. Company policy was never to disclose this of course, and John wondered (if it was that particular caller) if the man would call back. Or worse, if it was too late.
John's breathing pattern changed as he awakened, his body stretching and the sheet bunching up as he moved. There was a groan and then faint murmuring of one-syllable answers in response to her questions, and his voice was low and tired and slower in cadence than Sherlock had heard in a long while. He didn't sound like himself.
Her smile is quick and appreciative. "So yes. Agitated saline transthoracic contrast echocardiography is the phrase that we're supposed to use." She gives him a conspiratory grin, "Although that sounds even more frightening to me."
"Oh god," Sherlock breathed, an exhaled whisper of actual shock. There were a million questions, how did he get there, had he nicked an Oyster card, or walked? Did the hospital staff try to stop him, why didn't John himself call? How long did it take him, was he crying, how did Sherlock manage to miss the noise let alone the intent of him leaving? "Is he ... are they ...?"
Hoping to be discreet, impressed with her engagement, John brushed a hand over his chin to hide the small smirk. Sherlock's eye narrowed in concentration as he searched for a knowledgeable answer. "Too fast. Poor cardiac output. Activity intolerance." He kept his phrases brief as his mind kept moving, offering other suggestions when she didn't commend him for his brilliance. "Oxygen delivery."
John can't stop the chuckle, and he tunes them out as Sherlock continues to be brilliant a little bit concerningly charming, while moving Sherlock's belongings, getting them unpacked, emptying the wheelchair of everything but the patient.
For all the times John has overlooked Sherlock's comments, he wonders about this time and chooses what he hopes will be gently delivered. "I won't argue that, of course. But it is happening to us. And, well, I'm choosing to remind you that I'm here with you, that I want only whatever we have because we're together. And I know that it might not be easy, but it is
