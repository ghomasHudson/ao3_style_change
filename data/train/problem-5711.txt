Steve's eyes rolled back into his head as he came, and Tony knew he was close too. He thrust himself a few more times, before finally coming himself. He pulled out of Steve, and fell over to the side. Their panting was now the only sound in the empty room. Steve looked over at Tony, and they simply lay there, enjoying the utter bliss. "Thank you." Steve whispered, and kissed Tony, who smiled. Tony curled up beside him. "No need to thank me." he whispered and fell asleep. Steve chuckled, and nodded off.
The pair stared at each other in awe, and jumped for joy. "We did it Stark! We really did it!" Bruce hi-fived Tony and they marveled at their work. "We've done well." Bruce said proudly. "Hey, how about we celebrate? I know this great little café that has the best coffee." Tony offered, grabbing his jacket off the hook. Bruce followed after, excited for their work. But something in the back of his mind nagged him about that little emblem that Tony had tried so hard to hide.
"Steve? Are you okay? You seem... Distant." Steve looked up from his coffee to see Ashley staring quietly, obviously concerned. "Uh, yeah. I'm fine. I just... have a lot on my mind." He didn't meet her eyes, and instead looked at the cup in front of him. He hadn't been able to focus much on the movie. He had come back into it here and there, but he had been too focused on analyzing the night he and Tony had shared, the moment on the rooftop.
“Don’t break him Thor.” Jane laughed, patting the seat next to her. Thor joined her eagerly, causing her to bounce with the force. “So you’re Jane, it’s nice to finally meet you.” Steve greeted and offered her a hand. She took it with a smile. “Alright! All the guests are here, so why don’t we head into the dining room and enjoy ourselves a nice Christmas dinner?” Pepper suggested, Tony hanging on her waist. Steve swallowed hard, that jealous feeling rising in him once again. “Hell yeah! I’m starving!” Clint cheered as he headed into the dining room, Bruce and Natasha following after.  “I’ll be there in a sec. You all go ahead.” Steve mumbled, jerking his thumb in the direction of the bathroom. Everyone else nodded; Thor and Jane got up from the couch and followed the other couple into the dining room.
Ashley pulled Steve close, nestling her head in his chest, listening to his heartbeat. Steve looked over her, and spotted Tony sitting at the bar, watching them dance. The blond felt his heart break, and shook his head quickly. "I'm sorry Ashley, I can't do this anymore." Steve removed Ashley's arms from around his neck, and avoided eye contact. "I can't keep leading you on like this. I'm sorry."
Both shook their heads. Steve headed inside and walked into the earth-toned room, glad to get away from the couple. He was happy for them, but he was sick of being reminded of what he never had. The sound of jeans dragging against hardwood caused him to look over, and he saw an aggravated Tony standing by the coffee maker.
"Keep telling yourself that. So? Do you or don't you?" Tony asked as he sat down across from him. "I can't, I have a date with Christine later." Steve answered quietly, not looking up. "Oh, okay. Another time then." The brunette said, trying to hide the obvious fact of his disappointment. "Maybe tomorrow night?" The solider offered, and the other man looked up, smiling softly. "Sure, sounds good to me. The Silver Celtics?"
Their kisses became even more passionate, their breathing even harder. "Tony..." Steve gasped, and Tony pushed himself off the door, causing their bodies to fly forward. Steve caught his balance, and they just stood there for a moment, panting, but not moving back from the kiss
"Well, what do you think?" Tony looked up to see a very handsome Steve Rogers in a navy blue suit, which complimented his cerulean blue eyes. Tony tried to keep his jaw shut, not wanting to embarrass himself. Steve's hair was swept back, his hair looking perfect as always. Tony felt a bit, how do you say, under-dressed, compared to the other man. Tony wore a simple black suit, and a red tie. It was Pepper's favorite tie on him.
He pulled out his phone, dialing up the number. A young woman's voice answered, sexy and expecting. "Hello Tony, I suspect you got my message? Or were you just looking for another good time?" Christine asked, smirking. "Shut up bitch. I thought I should let you know that there isn't anything for you to know anymore. Whatever you saw is over now." Tony growled. "Ooh Tony, you should know better than to speak to a woman like that." she said, keeping her voice light. "And may I ask what you mean?"
Tony became lost in his thoughts, simply staring at nothing. Steve looked up and chuckled. That man amazed, and annoyed him. Something in him stirred, something he hadn't felt since... He shook the thought of her from his mind. No reason to get upset about her now. He grabbed Tony's toast and put it on a plate, feeling nice. He sighed, and cast one last look at the man, before shaking his head in amusement and walking out to the balcony.
“Heard you and Tony yelling last night, what the hell happened?” Clint asked, early the next morning. Steve looked up from his plate of eggs and French toast, only half eaten. “For your safety and mental health, it’s better if you don’t know.” the blond muttered, moving his eggs around on his plate. Clint decided not to push the topic, seeing the tired look in Steve's eyes. He simply sighed and took a bite of his chocolate doughnut, admiring the view.
"Know what? You guys go have fun. I'll be back at Stark Towers." Tony growled, slamming the bottle down on the counter near Steve's hand, and storming off. The soldier knew he would need to apologize for that little remark, but he wasn't going to be doing it now. He pushed down his guilt, and returned the bottle to its rightful place, and followed out after the others.
"Nope. Not until we get you in your own room." Steve said, his tone serious. Tony sighed, and waited as the soldier pulled out the extra room key, and opened the door. Steve walked over to the couch, and threw Tony onto it. He groaned with delight, happy to be on a soft surface. He looked out to the balcony window, the night lighting up only part of the room. Tony lifted his head to find Steve cleaning up the table, slamming plates, an angry look on his face.
"You're going to be getting a lot more than a bruise if you keep this up!" Natasha's voice rose, but she quickly caught herself. "Okay, please explain to me what I'm doing wrong!" Tony requested, giving her a bored look. "You and Rogers!" She quietly yelled.
“Yeah, I do.” he mumbled, and continued walking towards Natasha. She tried to hide the amused look on her face; even more so when Tony shot her the dirtiest look he could muster up. She looked at Steve, who gave her a soft smile, and shrugged his shoulders as if to say, W
“What’s this?” Peter asked, looking it over with a confused look. “I don’t know, Pepper told me Tony wanted us to have these.” Steve said quietly. He looked over his son. “It’s late, you should get some rest.” he said, hugging Peter. The boy held back sobs, and nodded. “If you need to stay in my bed tonight, you know where I am.” Steve muttered into his son’s hair. Again, Peter nodded.
"I um, so what kind of movies do you like?" Ashley asked, So far, the conversation had been going well, the topics had been keeping away from more modern day topics, that is, until now. Steve ran a hand through his blond hair; trying to think of the most recent movie he had seen. "Um, I'm a real big fan of war movies. That new movie that's out, Argo? It seems really cool. I've been waiting to go see it but-" "But you haven't had anyone to go with you?" Ashley asked tilting her head. Steve was caught off guard.
"You seem like you're in a better mood lately, what happened?" Bruce asked, and Tony looked up from the latest project of his. "Nothing, just," He smiled, and looked back down at his project. "Me and Cap are friends again, I'm glad to be talking to him again." He muttered, and he could hear Bruce chuckle. "Is that all? When are you finally going to break it off with Pepper and just finally be with the man already? He's seriously the only thing that can make you smile like that anymore." The other man pointed out, and Tony shook his head sadly. "I don't think that's going to happen." Not with Christine still in the picture, or rather, with the pictures... "Look, if you think he's still upset at you, I think you're wrong. You two need to-" Bruce started, but Tony put up his hand to stop him.
He knew how much Steve hated people seeing him cry, seeing how weak he was on the inside. He was Captain America, super soldier, the first avenger. He was supposed to be invincible, and the thought of someone seeing him cry really scared him. It was a male pride thing. So they simply sat there, Steve holding back tears, and Tony holding him, not saying a word.
The small object began to beep, and Bruce's face lit up. "Tony, you gotta come see this!" Tony rushed over, and watched as the object floated up, over to a trash bin, and lifted it into it. The sound of paper shredding filled the room, and the object floated over to the table, and landed itself back in front of them.
"Where are the others?" Steve asked, buttoning his jacket, trying to avoid any eye contact with the handsome man before him. Tony shifted uncomfortably. "They couldn't make it." he lied, not meeting Steve's eyes. Actually, he hadn't even asked any of the others. He wanted to have Steve to himself tonight, so they could have a talk
"I don't think, I know. How could you do this to all of us? Do you understand what could happen if this all goes wrong?"
Bruce wondered, but shook his head. "Come on Barton, I need to get back to my lab. That was probably the most painful thing I had to do." He sighed as they began to head to the vehicles. "You're a good man Bruce." Clint said, patting the man on the back and laughing.
. Steve ran a hand through his blond hair, and decided to change out of his sweats. He had just come back from a long needed work out, and his body was unwound. His nerves felt relaxed.
"So what are you saying? You want to leave us? You want to just disappear and never come back? Haven't you done that already?" Tony clamped a hand over his mouth after he realized what he said.  His eyes got big, and he opened his mouth to apologize, but Steve's fist beat him to it. It was a quick punch to the jaw, enough to cause the smaller man to fly into the wall, hurt turning into frustration and anger. Steve stayed where he was, blinking back his own tears. He couldn't believe Tony would really say that to him, even if he wasn't aware of what today was, that was completely uncalled for. Tony wiped blood out of the corner of his mouth.
"Hurry up with that coffee. I don't know if you forgot, but we need to meet with Fury in less than an hour, and," Steve paused as he looked over Tony's undergarments. "I don't think you want to go looking like that." The brunette scowled, and sipped his coffee. "Like you're any better off. Is that my shirt?" he questioned, recognizing the large brown grease stain against the purple fabric. "Oh, yeah I-"
"It's so great to see you. I missed you, and I couldn't stop thinking about you." Ashley babbled on, and Steve tried to listen politely. He showed her to a table, and she continued with her conversation. Steve couldn't have been more uninterested. He wanted to leave, but he knew he couldn't be rude. Damn his politeness. Tony chuckled as he ordered another drink, hoping to get as drunk as possible.
Steve finally decided to loosen up a bit, and with a bit more direction, he actually was pretty good at it. Or maybe Tony was just that drunk. Either way, they were getting it on on the dance floor, and Steve couldn't get enough. The song ended, but neither made a move to separate themselves.
Tony Stark has had to settle in a hotel for now, due to the destruction of Stark Towers. All the Avengers had joined him, they had become close, well, most of them...
Steve spotted Bruce standing shyly in a corner, a drink in his hand, eyes locked on the ground. "I'll be back, Bruce is looking pretty lonely." he said as he began to back away. The other two nodded, and resumed their conversation. "Hey Banner." he muttered as he reached the shy man. "Hey Rogers. Enjoying yourself?" Bruce asked, perking up a bit. "I guess you could say that. I never really was one for winter." He gave a half smile, and the brunette returned it.
"Glad to see you came." Steve's voice sent chills down Tony's spine, and he turned around slowly. Steve stood dressed in uniform, and the brunette smiled. "What are the chances that we both come to the same restaurant?" The soldier laughed. Tony laughed with him, running a hand through his dark hair. "Yeah what are the odds?" Steve looked down at the other man, waiting for more of a conversation. A silence passed, and Tony cleared his throat. "Is now really the best time to be talking about this?" he muttered, shoving his hands in his pants pockets.
Bruce walked in, tablet in hand. He was scrolling through some type of blue print, his face twisted in deep concentration. "Hey Tony, so I was thinking about that project that you wanted to start and I-" He stopped himself when he noticed Steve was in the room, and smiled. "Hey Steve, am I- uh-am I interrupting something?" Bruce asked, moving his hands in an awkward gesture.
"Steve? Steve wake up!" Bruce shook the soldier hard, and he jolted awake. "Wh-what?" He rubbed his eyes, and checked the clock. Ten a.m. "You were screaming in your sleep again," Bruce muttered. "Sorry," Steve sighed, and quickly wiped a tear away.
"No, but, I just want you to be careful Tony, you're playing with fire. We're not talking about an experiment; we're talking about Steve Rogers, Captain America, our leader." The woman turned, and begun walking back towards the elevators. "I don't want this to break us all apart because you had a change of heart." Tony watched as the elevator doors shut, and he rubbed his eyes. "Oh, God, what am I doing?"
They fell asleep in each other's arms, wrapped in a loving embrace, and cake crumbs littering the bed almost like rose petals.
Ashley waved at Steve as he came back over, and sat across from her. "Glad to see you came back, I thought you had left." she muttered, smiling down at her dinner. "Nah, I just had to do something real quick." The blond looked over Ashley's shoulder once more, and saw Tony wink in the mirror.
Steve sighed as he woke up, hating the sun as it spilled through the curtains of Tony's bedroom, shedding light on the scene of the crime, crumpled bed sheets, Tony's arms wrapped around the soldier’s neck, legs entwined with the bed, his breathing soft and in tune with his chest rising and falling. Steve smiled, kissing the smaller man's forehead, causing him to scowl and turn over, turning his back to the invading sunlight. The blond chuckled lightly, and got up. He threw on his boxers and his jeans, not bothering with his shirt. He glanced at himself in the mirror, hair all over the place, and a stupid grin on his face.
Steve was left standing in the middle of the room, alone. He eyed the Christmas tree one more time, before heading towards the bathroom. He locked the door behind him, splashing some cool water on his face. “Relax Steve; you can make it through a simple dinner. Just,” He paused, thinking he heard footsteps.  “Just fake it.” He turned off the water, and dried his face with a towel.  He came out of the bathroom, and the smell of a Christmas ham wafted over to him.
“Hello American man! It is nice to see you could join us.” Thor laughed, wrapping the soldier in a hug. Clint and Natasha quickly stole the presents from Steve’s arms, before he could crush them. “Thor! What are you doing back so soon?” Steve asked, struggling to breathe.  “My father let me back for a day. I’m not staying, but he said the King of Asgard should spend his days as he pleases.” Thor grinned as he placed his friend back on solid ground.
"Because I left them on." The larger man retaliated, removing Tony's hands from his body. "If we're gonna do this," He went onto his knees, his blue eyes sparkling with mischief, and his lips red from the feverish kissing that he had just removed himself from. "We're gonna do it right."
"I-I can handle this." The blond muttered, averting his eyes, and replacing Tony's hands on the buttons. "S-sure, sorry." The other man said quickly, and pulled his hands away, before moving around Steve. "Have fun on your date." He muttered, trying to hide the pain in his voice. "Thanks..." The soldier called after him, trying to swallow what he had heard. He still loves me... Damn it Stark! Why do you always have to make things harder than they already are? He groaned softly as he finished up his buttons, and headed off to pick up Christine for their date.
He paused a moment, and a silence passed between the two. "Tony?" The blond practically whispered, and the smaller man looked up, a blush flooding his face. He noticed the red tint to Steve's cheeks, and the way his lips were slightly parted, like he was going to say something, or better yet, do something....
"Tony, if you don't get down from there right now I swear to God I'm coming up there and killing you myself." Steve threatened calling up to Tony. The man simply laughed, and continued to dance close to the edge of the roof. "Come on Cap! Lighten up! Have a drink!" he called down, tossing a bottle of whiskey down. It fell into the snow, unscathed from the five story fall. "Come on Stark! We're freezing down here! Get down before you hurt yourself!" Clint complained, rubbing his arms to keep warm from the chilly wind.
“Are we talking about dinner or Tony?” Steve joked, and Natasha almost fell out of her chair laughing.
"I don't think I do Tony." Steve said, not meeting Tony's eyes. "Don't lie to me Steve, I can't take any more lies, you were the one who was supposed to never lie to me," Tony whispered, voice faltering.
The room fell silent, watching to see what would conspire. Silence passed for about a minute, before a loud thunder broke in. Everyone but Tony and Steve looked up, and Bruce gasped. He ran out the sliding glass door, onto the patio.
Steve laughed, continuing to dance. He wrapped his arms around Tony's waist, forgetting everything and everyone around them. He was with the man he loved, and no one was going to ruin his good time. Tony listened to his sweet laugh, that laugh he never thought he would hear again.
"Even when his reputation is in danger the man is still a gentleman." Christine noticed, walking in. "It's not my reputation I'm worried about." Steve muttered, and the woman saw her opening. "So you're not worried about everyone knowing that the great Captain America is gay?" She lowered her voice as they sat at a table.
"No, stop." He said, feeling her lips move from his and down his neck. "Why? Don't you like me Steve?" she teased, running a hand up his front. He sucked in a breath as she bit gently on his neck, causing him to moan a bit. Another giggle, and she kissed his neck. "Come on Captain, why don't you show me what you can do?" "I said stop!" He said a little louder, and he felt her remove her hands from his body. She moved back, a mix of hurt and anger apparent on her face. "Fine, I get it. You don't want to do it here. I'll see you at seven." Christine said, stepping out and dressing.
Steve stood outside in the cold air, rubbing his hands together. “Aw, you cold my little super soldier?” Tony teased, wrapping his arms around Steve’s torso. Steve laughed, and turned so he know faced the shorter man. His eyes shone with the street light, and falling snow flakes stuck themselves to his eye lashes. “I won’t be in a minute.” Steve muttered, leaning down and meeting Tony’s lips. The two kissed, and their bodies immediately ignited with an internal flame. Tony stood on his tip toes, trying to get better access to Steve’s hot lips. He pulled away and began to kiss Steve’s jaw, down his neck. He flicked his tongue across Steve’s sweet spot, causing him to utter a small giggle.
Tony rubbed his temple with his free hand, the noise of the city construction not helping his severe hangover. He went back inside, slowly sipping his coffee as he tried to remember any more of the night. Nothing came to him. He'd have to talk to Steve after breakfast. But first, he ran into the bathroom and puked his brains out. Never again, never! "God damn super soldier." the brunette growled under his breath, wiping his mouth with a wet towel. What had he been thinking anyways? Why was it so important to prove himself to the other man?
"What?" Steve choked out, his heart shattering in his chest. "I'm sorry, it's just, I can't do this anymore. I just, I don't love you anymore." Tony admitted, still not looking at Steve. "How can you just do this? How can you just tear this family apart as if it was nothing? How can you be so selfish?" Steve scoffed, glaring at his husband. "Have you even thought about what this is going to do to Peter?"
"Oh, that? You're right Steve, we did have a deal, but I figured if you can't keep up with your end, why should I?" Christine said, shrugging a bit. "What the hell are you talking about?" he growled. "You and I both know you and Tony reconciled last night." she smirked. "Have you been spying on me?" The soldier asked, a bit creeped out. "Me specifically no. But I have my spies sweetheart. And even they aren't aware. You remember Ashley don't you?" The woman cackled. "You hurt her pretty bad there Steve, she needed a shoulder to cry on. And she told me all about how she saw you last night at the bar, with a Mr. Tony Stark."
He clicked the button, and the camera shut off. "Hope I can finally make you proud dad." His finger began to squeeze down on the trigger, but a loud crashing that sounded like a door being broken door stopped him. "Tony?" Steve's voice was concerned, he was searching for him. Do it now. Do it before he can try to stop you. Tony's hand began to shake, and he he dropped the gun. Shit. Steve's footsteps became louder as he approached the door where Tony was holed away. He scrambled for the gun, but he was shaking so bad his hands fumbled. Steve bashed the door in, and tackled Tony. "No, get away from me! Let me die!" he screamed, and Steve held him down. "Tony! Tony look at me!" Steve tried to stay calm, but the thought of Tony actually doing it made him just as scared. Tony looked up, eyes full of tears. "I'm here Tony." Steve said, his voice soothing. Tears began to stream down Tony's face, and his body began to shake. Not with fear, but with sobs, with gratitude.
"You knew they were going to be here." Steve muttered, sipping at his water. "Pure coincidence darling." Christine smirked. Steve noticed movement out of the corner of his eye. He glanced over to see Tony and Pepper holding hands.
Stephanie glared at the brunette before her. "A liar, then? And what happened Ms. Stark? I thought you felt quite strongly against me and you having any form of a relationship, and yet here you are saying that me holding something back would threaten that?"
Natasha reached out and placed a hand upon his bare, highly muscular forearm. “I would not request anything of you such as this if I had not a good reason. I ask only that you listen to my own suit, in this matter.”
Once Tony was lying on his back, splayed haphazardly over the flagstones, Obadiah removed the hand he’d been pressing against Tony’s chest, which revealed a small dagger enveloped by Tony’s body up to the hilt. He gaped at it for a moment, and his hand came up instinctively to pull it out of his chest.
Tony noticed, and lifted his eyes to Steve’s. “Don’t,” he said, his voice gravelly. “Don’t… over-think this.”
Maria had Jarvis drive her to the hospital especially for the occasion. She had put on a dress and a nice pair of shoes, and put her hair up in a ponytail.
Steve stood outside the cafe, eyes darting around, foot tapping with nervousness. "Hello Captain." An icy voice said, and Steve's eyes fell upon Christine Everhart. "I'm glad you took my offer to meet me." She smiled, and Steve snorted as he looked away. "Of course." he muttered, and got the door to the cafe for her.
This was it. This was her chance. No one was going to believe it. She pulled out her iPhone, but stopped. “No, I have to get more proof. Maybe I can use this to my advantage.” She sneered, and headed inside.
Steve broke the kiss to see Tony in front of him. Something was hidden behind his back, but the soldier couldn't tell what. "What is it Stark?" he asked, a cold chill to his words. The brunette's look of hurt quickly changed to one of annoyance. "I came to apologize, but now, you can just forget it." he spat angrily, storming off. Steve let out a breath, and removed Christine's hands from around his neck. "Listen, why don't you just, go back to your place? I'll meet you there, and we can have dinner." he said, and Christine nodded. "Sure, I'll meet you at my place." She was obviously annoyed that her and Steve's little moment had been broken up, but she left all the same. Steve pressed back the urge to go and chase after Tony.
"You guys go ahead. I need to keep an eye on this guy." Steve told the gang, cocking his head towards the brunette. Tony stole the bottle right out of the blond's hand, and took a swig. "Don't have to tell me twice!" Bruce practically skipped out of the room, and Natasha took Clint's hand as they followed after him.
"It's looking great. Everything still stable?" Bruce asked, picking up a complex tool, and going at the little object. Tony nodded with approval. "If everything goes well, we should have this baby up and running in no time, and we can save a lot of time cleaning up around the lab." He chuckled, and Bruce laughed with him. He enjoyed Tony's company; it kept his mind occupied.
Maybe it was the atmosphere, or maybe it was the way Tony looked with his hair pushed back off his face, matted to his head with sweat. The blond didn't care, he placed one hand behind Tony's neck, the other on his lower back pushing them even closer together, and he ran his tongue up the brunet's neck, taking in all that was there: Tony's sweat, the faint taste of a cologne that had long worn off, the taste of a woman's lipstick.
Tony tinkered with the large object in front of him, pulling up the designs on the screen next to him. "Dammit, why can't I get this right?" he groaned in anger, looking over the plans again and again. "If I may add some input sir?" Jarvis asked quietly, and moving images on the screen. Tony studied the changes thoroughly, and smiled. "Nice work Jarvis." The man added the adjustments, and smiled at his project. It was a present for Steve, just a little something to remind him of the good days.
She pushed the curtain back again, and wrapped her arms around herself, all the hairs on her body sticking out at once. She could feel her skin puckering with goosebumps, feel her nipples harden to taut points beneath her shirt, ticklish against the cotton.
Nia swallowed. “What?” she asked. Her voice was too quiet, her heart was beating too quickly, her breath was too shallow. “What was the project?”
Nia followed Howard into his hotel room, which was like a mirror image of her hotel room, almost identical, but flip-flopped, with the bed and the bathroom on opposite walls. Howard sat down on the edge of the foot of his bed, and rubbed his hand over his forehead, sighing helplessly.
Captain-America-like today, in his freshly-pressed uniform, the blank star-shaped space over his heart waiting, like all of them, for the silver stars that would mean they were Graduates.
“I hear the young squire’s arms are to be a swan,” the Asgardian continued, peering at Tony. “For his terrible temper, perhaps?”
Sam practically snorted. “Tony doesn't care. You know he doesn't care. This is about his marriage, not his status.”
With his heart feeling as though a cold hand were squeezing around it, Steve finally managed to break through his shock and swing down from his mare’s back. Sam was already dismounted, striding cautiously towards the flurried mud at the edge of the road.
.”  But her stomach was growling, and there was a lump in her chest. She clenched her hands into fists, focusing on the pressure of her fingers against her palms, as she walked down the hall from her bedroom to the balcony, down the stairs, and into the dining room, where her parents had agreed, for the special occasion, to meet her together.
Tony knew better than to comment on that, as he’d already learned that the topic of Steve’s absent best friend was to be left alone as much as humanly possible. With a veritable petting zoo of triggers and anxieties of his own, Tony readily let Steve have his privacy there.
“My friend!” he exclaimed as they rounded another corner. “How is it you have survived so long as a warrior without armor?”
A throat was cleared unceremoniously behind her, and she turned to look back at the two boys in exasperation. The blond boy looked like he had a bee in his mouth.
Which meant there had been more to his imprisonment than just what they had seen – the thought made him grind his teeth in fury.
With all eyes suddenly on him, Tony did his best to read Natasha’s mind. “I suppose, she's referring to the children’s story, about the ugly duckling.”
Tony gaped at the guy who was standing in front of him with his arms also raised. Only instead of looking aggressive, he looked like he was trying to placate Tony.
Finally, Steve drew abreast of Sam, as close to the edge as they dared, and they peered over together into the ravine.
Tony stares at him for a little while in silence, wondering how they had gotten to this point so quickly and so easily. For him, it was just about unheard-of. It must all be Steve.
Steve sighed and pushed the door open. Tony was over by the lit fireplace, pinning up sodden pieces of paper on a string stretched in front of it. When Tony saw who it was at the door, Steve prepared himself for yelling, for things being thrown, for anger of any kind – but instead, Tony hunched in on himself and gave his back to Steve.
Her shoulders twitched, and then she shivered, and let out a little moan, inadvertently, and nibbled at his lower lip. His other hand drifted down, unbuttoning her jeans, fingers sliding beneath her waistband, catching at the elastic of her panties.
“Oh, your parents,” the man said, taking yet another step closer, so that he hovered over Tony. With a dramatic flick of his heavy cloak, the man dropped into a crouch before the ratty cot and the rattled prince upon it. The man’s face could have been kind, could have been handsome; but instead Tony saw only a serpent in his deep-set eyes and his teeth bared in a cruel smile. He was older than Tony by at least a decade or two, judging by the lines of his face, and his eyes were icy. “Your mother is dead, Stark. Your father too. Long live the king.”
“N--”  Nia started to say, and  then realized she hadn’t shed the jacket she had worn into Steve’s room. “Uh. Yeah,” she said, tugging at the lapels. “Uh. I couldn’t sleep. I wanted to check out his vitals, you know, uh...familiarize myself with the case?”
Then, without a word, Thor grabbed the knife buried in Tony’s chest in one hand and the amulet in the other. Before anyone could protest, he had pulled the knife from between Tony’s ribs with a terrible sucking noise, and pressed the gold amulet over the wound.
Slowly—very slowly—but surely, he had created a comprehensive map in his own mind of the grounds, though he was not nearly familiar enough with Natasha’s kingdom to fathom where in it he might be. The only reason he was certain he
There were no witnesses to judge him for plunging his face forward into Steve’s furred chest, or for bringing his hands up under Steve’s cape to wrap around his back. Of course, Steve was so big around that Tony’s hands didn’t even come close to meeting in the middle, but that was okay. He was warm and fluffy, he smelled safe and familiar, and his heart beat in a solid, comforting drum against Tony’s cheek. Steve’s hands slipped down to hug Tony back, and it was great. So great.
… And then his face fell. Steve’s heart beat double for one short moment as disappointment and confusion flooded Tony’s expression. The hand held between his felt suddenly cold, and the comfort Steve had been drawing from the contact disappeared in an instant. It was no matter, as Tony wrenched his hand away a moment later anyway. As Steve stayed frozen in place on his knees, Tony jumped up and strode away, freezing, muttering something to himself, then patting his hands frantically down his front.
Steve’s stomach clenched, but he refused to be afraid and nodded determinedly, returning Tony’s gaze. It was Tony who dragged his eyes away after a long moment, looking down at his lap, then bringing up a hand and pressing it forcefully against his own chest.
“James and I have decided,” she told him seriously, belayed only by the light of amusement in her eyes. “That my first child should never have difficulty claiming the throne, so it must be Tony’s.”
The last conversation he’d had with Tony echoed in his mind, louder and louder with every step he took. He had thrown Tony’s confession in his face - carelessly rejected his brave admission of love. That… that simply could not be the final time they spoke. He refused to allow those fearful,
gorgeous Steve want his reclusive, staring, barely-functional neighbor to hang around in his apartment now that he’s done as asked and slain the heinous beast? Steve had probably thought he was joking about the coffee fee.
“No guards,” Natasha’s voice came suddenly from behind him, and it took an enormous effort not to spin around with a great clattering of armor and weaponry. The only person who didn’t startle was Clint.
Nia went stiff, her shoulders twitching. She shuffled her way back to the sofa, her feet feeling like lead weights.
She winced at the reminder, though she knew Howard meant well by it, and walked out, back into the dining room, and turned around to eye the bookcase. “How do I get back in?”
Natasha’s twelfth birthday had come and gone last year, which meant she was of legal marrying age in their kingdom. Tony had been of age for over a year, but even so Lord Fury had agreed with King Howard that it was not the right time for a royal wedding between their kingdoms, considering the worrisome news coming out of Asgard, on the broad side of the Midgardian Sea, what felt like every day in the four years since Tony’s friends had visited.
“I love you,” Steve said solemnly, saying the words like he would say a vow. His hands came up and wrapped themselves around the one Tony had resting upon his own knee. “Tony, I do. I love you.”
Steve’s heart throbbed in shock and hurt, but Natasha leaned forward so that her unbound hair trailed over Bucky’s chest. “Shh, shh,” she soothed. “You're safe, you’ve been asleep. Don't try to move.”
Howard pursed his lips, looking all too serious. “Change of plans,” he said. “Pack a bag, for a week. Uniforms, business attire, cocktail dresses.”
“It’s true!” Hammer whined from where Thor was doing his best to restrain him without breaking any of his bones. “I would pose as King Anthony while Stane ruled from the shadows! Don’t you see? He used me! It’s not my fault! I—”
Someone, somewhere, snapped a photograph, and she swore under her breath. She straightened up again, tried not to let the confusion show on her face, tried to look serene.
For a moment, she was somewhere else. She was in pain; she saw blurry faces hovering over her, and they were talking about something...she made out a few words, made out the phrase, “madman,” followed by, “what have you
It was just a swan, just like all the others. It was white, with an orange bill and black masked markings on its face. It was not the largest swan on the lake, nor the smallest. There was nothing noteworthy about it except for the fact that it was staring at them like that.
She gritted her teeth, squeezed her eyes shut, and slipped a hand between her thighs, brushing a single fingertip against her clit, hoping maybe she could masturbate her way to sleep, but now all she could see was Ty, and it made her shudder, made her stomach turn, until she felt repulsed and snatched her fingers away.
For the next endless week, Steve had to be forcibly prised from Bucky’s bedside by an increasingly determined schedule of people to sleep, eat, and bathe or change clothes from time to time.
“I don’t know,” she replied in frustration. “But I imagine they would not be happy to learn that we have found you, Tony.”
“The serum,” Maria answered. “It prevents aging; the high healing factor slows him down, so to speak.”
Now the guy was definitely grinning. “Actually, the spell would only be broken if someone told me they loved me and
, traitor. I don't know what you want from me, but I promise you this—” He gasped in a deep breath as best he could. “—I will never agree of my own free will. That will
Maria shook her head, pinched the bridge of her nose. “You are more than ready,” she said. “It isn’t you.”  She sighed, then got up from her chair. “Come on, love,” she said. “You must be starving. Let’s go fix a sandwich.”
. Bucky darted forward and grabbed Steve’s elbow in a painful grip, as all four of them watched a golden light diffuse out from where the swan was floating on the water. The swan had stopped fluttering its wings, and was peering at the glow beneath its body as if judging it for something.
“Who lives here?” Nia asked, marveling at brick-walled estates grander than her family’s home, and wincing at the proximity to the slums.
She locked her arm through Ty’s and forcibly dragged him toward their seats, him stumbling in her wake, in spite of the fact that he was larger and stronger.
The crowd went silent for a moment, before a murmur ran through the people who were still standing, watching. They didn’t stop snapping photos, but now they were snapping photos of both of them, of Ty and Nia, and Nia wanted to sink into the ground.
She willed herself to stop now, looking back into the mirror. She didn't look old. She didn't feel old. She felt like the same
“You going to make a habit out of greeting me every morning in a towel?” Tony teases, raising his cup to his lips.
The man in question stepped forward, past the sheet. He was dressed in surgical scrubs, rubber gloves on his hands, and she supposed she should be relieved that the conditions were at least sanitary, but he wore a plastic cap over his hair, and a surgical mask and pair of sunglasses obscured his face, and even as her vision was slowly improving, the only things she could identify about him were that he was tall, and white.
The city they drove through was startling. She knew that her family was wealthy, but her own scope of reference had always been seeing the civilians who lived in little brick townhouses, with postage-stamp yards only large enough for a few flower bushes. It had been seeing people leaving fast food stands with paper sacks in their hands on her way to the sit-down restaurants her family frequented with their white tablecloths and fine china.
Then they heard someone else approaching through the woods—Natasha, her voice low but cheerful—and Steve smiled with joy. But then he heard someone else’s laugh, and he knew who that was.
The quiet was not unexpected, though it was of course unwelcome. For over half a year, Steve had fallen asleep with the memory of Tony’s voice in his mind, and woken with it upon the cusp of his dreams; to lack it now was more painful than he would have expected. But Tony spoke sparingly, even haltingly – and that was perhaps worse than the silences. He seemed disconnected from the rest of them, as if he did not know how to respond to their questions or their jokes. As if they were strangers to him. He seemed confused when Sam tried to talk to him about Redwing’s healing leg, and downright startled when Clint performed one of his classic gymnastic tricks upon his long-suffering gelding’s back. Steve certainly had very little by way of comparison, but he could not have imagined that even seven months would have eroded Tony’s memory so drastically.
Nia washed the dishes-- a task usually left for Jarvis, but she was feeling jumpy-- and went upstairs to her room. She took a long shower, hoping the hot water would make her feel better, but it just made her feel overheated and a little bit raw as she sloughed off old skin. She twisted her hair to wring it out and tied it up into a knot before climbing into her pajamas.
Since the princess was yet far too young to rule, a regent was set on the throne in her place, a man eminently loyal to the Crown and to his young charge. Lord Nicholas Fury, the late king’s most trusted cabinet adviser, took control of the kingdom during a turbulent and frightening time. Though their crops were plentiful, their rivers and pastures replete, and their towns magnificently built, the land had suffered a heavy loss of the citizens needed to work and fill them.
And then there was the new variable of Sharon Carter, granddaughter of Natasha’s castle steward. She seemed to be willing to play with the others for one reason and one reason alone – Steve fawned over her at every available opportunity. Who would not want to be treated so royally? Tony could not tell if she actually liked Steve as much as he clearly liked her, but he figured it was not his place to ask or worry. Tony saw very little of Steve that summer, as a result, and wondered if Steve was not deliberately ignoring him once again.
A few muted whoops sounded, while Tony just sighed and relaxed into Steve’s chest a little more. He didn’t have an 8AM lecture like Jan (was she nuts?), but he did have a first draft of his mechatronics project due at the end of the week, and he wasn’t even close to happy with it yet. It was barely past midnight but he’d still be okay with leaving once the prizes were all doled out.
“They all look the same!” Steve snarled in frustration, leaping back from the angry pecking of another swan he’d gotten far too close to. “How are we supp—”
Tony stared him down, but Steve found himself looking anywhere other than at him, embarrassed and a little afraid of his own thoughts. He spoke again after a moment of silence. “Was it…” He shook himself off a little. “Did you lose anything…”
Tony forced his body forward into Steve’s with more strength than Steve could muster in response, and the two of them collapsed backwards onto the chaise in a bit of an undignified pile. Once they had settled, Tony pulled back and stared down at Steve, half his weight on the floor and the other half sending shocks of pleasure through Steve’s entire body from where it pressed down along his stomach, and from Tony’s knee not quite touching in between his thighs. Tony’s mouth was flushed, wet from Steve’s questing tongue. His cheeks were dark, and his eyes darker still. Steve’s fingers had made a riot of his hair, and he was breathing heavily, almost a pant.
There was a long silence. Steve felt it stretching out, unable to think of anything appropriate to say. Tony allowed the silence, though he was fidgeting almost instantly. He was never still, always in motion, dancing through his life. Steve was weak already, and Tony was standing right there, calling out to him with luminous brown eyes.
Oh, Steve didn’t like that at all. His chest rumbled with a displeased growl and his hands clamped around Tony’s waist. “We should go.”
“Now he has awoken, I feel more comfortable giving him medications,” the doctor explained a little while later, fussing over Bucky’s bandaged shoulder. “This is going to be… painful. Very painful. He will need to be on nerve sedatives for many weeks, perhaps months. I'm not – not really a surgeon, I have not treated a wound this severe before,” he admitted.
He was just beginning to make progress with Steve, too. Or at least he thought he was. The boy had been in a permanent sulk for at least the first week of Tony’s stay at the castle. When he wasn’t sulking he was angry, and when he wasn’t sulking
And yet, despite knowing that Tony would always be in his life here, something within Steve cried that it was not enough. Cried for more. Cried to lay his hands on Tony’s shoulders, or his head on Tony’s chest, listen to his heart and listen to his wild schemes; to run his fingers through Tony’s dark hair and trace the shape of his beard. Steve was so weak – a fool for ruin. He could not do this to Natasha nor Tony, nor to himself.
"She deserves to know," Maria had fired back, and Nia had heard the anger in her voice-- the passionate, burning tone that Maria used when she was fiercely angry.
She slid her hands around his neck, pulling him down to her height to kiss him more deeply, and he teased at her nipple with his thumb.
Ty looked back at Obie with a clear, guileless expression. “Sir?” he asked, lifting his head as if all he wanted was to help.
She drummed her fingers on the table. “And then it turned out I was working for nothing. And it’s never going to happen.”
She heard a loud crack-- and then saw glimmering colored lights in the sky above the water. Fireworks. She hastened her footsteps as she neared the beach, saw the bright, dancing flames of a bonfire and the shadowy silhouettes of teenagers drinking contraband beer from glass bottles and roasting marshmallows.
For a moment, Thor looked between her and Clint as though they were no longer speaking in a human tongue. Then, after a few moments of silence, he grew implausibly even paler with shock. “That cannot be,” he said softly, but he was clearly not addressing the pair before him. The words were directed inward, in horror and disbelief. “Has…” Thor swallowed and recovered some of his composure. “Has the prince not been confirmed dead?”
Tony swallowed his own heart-pounding panic, peeled off his fangs, and flashed him a roguish grin. “Told you so.”
. And since Loki did honestly seem to require the blood given freely, of Tony’s own will, he kept asking as politely as he seemed to be able to manage. Tony was not sure at what point the bounds of
there why bother planting someone to throw us off the trail? I mean, maybe the impostor was the plan all along, but why wait almost seven months when we’ve been looking for him all that time? Why now?”
the neighbors think?” Tony winks, finally taking a drink of his coffee and reveling for a minute in the experience. He knows it’s largely in his head—take that, Colonel Reason—but he still enjoys the phantom sensation of waking up for real when the coffee hits his cells.
The sun was about to set, and Tony was preemptively floating upon the glimmering surface of the lake. It was, at least, a beautiful prison he had been given. The lake was enormous, large enough to host several different nests with ample space between them, and so had been taken up by a fair-sized colony of swans. Tony, naturally, was not welcome among them. Whenever he tried to go anywhere near any of the other birds, he was hissed and spat at, pecked at viciously, and even bludgeoned with surprisingly powerful wings. He took their message and stayed well away. Especially when the eggs arrived.
the press; there’s no one who knows how news works like you do. There’s not a single person here who doesn’t already know you’re going to get an assignment in journalism. Bullshit, you didn’t think about it.”
As the music began to draw to a close, the lute soon becoming the only instrument singing out in the echoing room, Tony and Natasha reached the shallow platform set up before the throne dais. Lord Fury bowed deeply to his princess as Lord Stane did the same to Tony, ceremonially leaving their duty of care in the hands of the other soon-to-be spouse.
He had a working prototype of web fluid, he and Tony had gone through many compounds before they had finally found something that would work. It wasn’t exactly like spider silk, it was more like silly string in a way, but it was far stickier and could hold a lot of weight.
Zach’s eyes sparked with excitement and he scurried off to bed, snuggling down under the covers and propped his book up on his lap to look at the colourful pictures and read the large printed words, saying them aloud with Jarvis’ help.
As much as Tony found this sweet and appreciated it, appreciated Steve respecting him and wanting for them to take things slow, it did make this situation difficult, because he would rather have had them already have been physical before his heat, then he wouldn’t have felt so embarrassed when it came to talking to Steve about it.
Peter’s guilt was like acid heartburn. It churned in his stomach, climbed up his gullet and burned at the back of his throat, coating his tongue in a bitter layer and made his jaw ache.
“You can’t do this Tony!” Steve shouted, staggering to his feet, clutching his profusely bleeding nose. “They’ll kill Bucky, he’s innocent!”
“Fine.” Tony sighed, his cheeks flushing and he scowled at his useless legs, well at least he’d got them separated even though it looked more like an inelegant sprawl rather than a come hither pose.
Biting down onto Steve’s bottom lip, just enough to nip him, Tony breathed huskily into the other man, “I won’t break.”
“Actually we were going to try and keep the trip there as secret as possible.” Steve said, not imagining that Thor could do covert or quiet, he always seemed to be loud and boisterous.
Speaking of unfair, Shields assessment on him was not exactly fair considering it was done while he was dying and by a sociopath.
“Not as much as I want to put on some clothes that fit.” Bruce said, he gave Steve an apologetic smile, “No offence, Captain, but you’re not my type.”
“Hey, Pete, Zach. I hope you two are behaving for your Uncle Happy, I want you to be very good boys for him, and very brave too.” It was difficult to keep his voice steady and tears were rolling down his cheeks.
“That’s smart.” MJ agreed, “We need to know more about their security before you try and get into the buildings Osborn owns anyway.”
“And I am not swimming in that lake, because there are probably mutant piranha in there, or a shark, or a giant crocodile that will eat me. So you’ll have to put up with me being filthy.”
“Zach, baby, please!” Steve cried trying to approach him but couldn’t get closer than a few feet, the heat blistering the skin on his hands and wrists as he tried to reach out for Zach.
“Hmm, his hair is like burnished gold in candle light, and all light and glowy in sunlight, and how is it possible for his lips to be that pouty and kissable all the time?”
“Is that a fact or a promise?” Tony flirted, having to pinch himself for the fact that he was flirting with Captain America who was not only flirting back with him, had been the one to initiate the flirtation to begin with! He inhaled sharply as Steve leaned closer to him, their shoulders brushing together and dark blue eyes locked onto him and seemingly pinned him into his place.
Steve, who had been shaking hands with Sam, beamed with pride, “Yeah, I’m his Daddy.” It was only thanks to the serum that he didn’t double over as Clint slapped him on the back.
Curien laughed, “He already has started.” He sneered at Steve, “Do you think I was the only Doctor on the payroll, the only one performing experiments? There are others and those facilities are still hidden, tests still on going.” He smirked at the two avengers, “You spend all your time worrying about Hydra, about aliens, about monster, you never stopped to think that the real danger might be closer to home and that a war had already been declared on you without you even knowing.”
“Sorry Steve.” Bruce apologised, “The human brain, any brain for that matter gives different readings during sleep, especially in REM sleep.”
Steve let out a deep sigh and looked heavenward, “Why can’t you talk to me about these things instead of trying go about them on your own?” he asked, whether or not he was asking God or Tony wasn’t entirely clear and Tony shrugged, looking down at his hands.
“I think so.” Tony said, he wasn’t looking forward to drinking instant coffee on this trip, but it was all they had so he’d have to put up with it or go without. He took Peter and Zach’s rucksacks from the car and set them up in their tent, snorting as he opened them and found that both contained a large supply of chocolate bars, crisps, and other snacks.
Curien lunged off the seat just as Norman fired again; the bullet went into the upholstery and Norman cursed while Curien reached back with his good arm, he grabbed the door handle and pulled on it throwing himself out of the car and into the road.
There was no chance between him and Steve, he knew that. He was years older than Steve, widowed, a single Mother, and a fucking mess of emotional problems and mental health issues.
Two boots were suddenly stood before Tony and he looked up to see Steve standing over him, but it wasn’t Steve, not his Steve, this was a dead body standing over him.
"Completely, nothing shall make us bend," Tony yelped and giggled as Steve lifted his hips to gain more leverage and a deeper thrust, "No matter how hard you batter us or how large your cannons are we shall not give in."
For once Tony didn’t have an answer and Steve moved in once again, this time checking with Tony before he placed a lingering kiss on his lips.
“We need an early warning system to tell us about Lord of the Rings Characters going batshit in London?” Clint asked not bothering to duck when Natasha slapped the back of his head.
“It is not close to civilian population either, and it is also a place that could be made strategic.”
Wanda’s scowl morphed into an expression of distress, and she let out a sharp cry as if Steve had struck her!
Meanwhile, Natasha went back up the rocks a little way and performed a perfect dive off one of them, surfacing and urging the others to hurry up.
Steve rolled back onto his back and stared at their ceiling. Once he had Bucky back he’d set about exposing Stark for what he was. Make the world see him in his true colours, show them that The Merchant of Death had not changed and that Iron Man was just another ego trip for him.
“We have to get the glove off him.” Tony said, “We combine our power, severe his arm at the shoulder.”
“Perception is everything.” Norman agreed, “And I need people to perceive me as innocent in this business.”
“Um weren’t you just bitching me out for practicing unsafe weight lifting experiments with him?” Steve asked Tony.
“And a lovely speed boat!” Trevor said as he awoke again, “The thing was, he needed someone. To take credit for some “Accidental explosions”
“Well that’s good, because if I’m family then I’d have to work out if fucking you would be like fucking my brother or my mother!”
Half an hour later the tents were finished and everyone was enjoying their ice creams and listening to Zach telling them all about the weird things he’d seen in the rock pools.
How anyone could have done that to someone Steve had no idea. He knew it was done to corpses to determine cause of death and to teach medical students, but to do it to the living, to a child? The person had to have no conscience or morals at all.
Not entirely used to making choices like that Bucky shrugged, “Well think about it over breakfast.” Tony said, “And order anything you want, hell order the entire menu if you want!”
It worked, Steve was agreeing in a second, and hurried into the compound with Wanda to pack. Sam on the other hand, kicked at the ground.
“That ain’t never happenin’” came a drawl from the side. Both mean turned to look and Wade shrieked,
“Yeah, I love you guys too.” Tony said, patting Dumm-E’s claw. He drew in a big shuddering breath and straightened up. “I guess I should call the Police.” He looked to Steve frowning, “Should I? It was a long time ago, and… it was the Winter Soldier. Barnes was like a puppet under their control. He can’t be held accountable for anything they made him do. But the Police might not care, and he might go to court and end up facing an unsympathetic judge who’ll sentence him to like three hundred years, and then he’ll fall apart and hang himself in his cell or something, and Rogers will hate me even more than he already does, because I’ll have killed his best friend, and…”
Tony shrugged, “Practice, and not giving a fuck.” He grinned, “Sam was just teasing, and I really don’t care if they think we’re having sex or not, it doesn’t matter, we’re consenting adults, we’re both single, so why should it be an issue.”
“Your Mother isn’t here, is he?” He said to Peter and placed the tip of the scalpel at the top of Peter’s breastbone, “He’d have to find me before he could do anything to me, and there is so much I can do to you before that happens.”
Clint was not much of a cook. Not in the conventional sense of the word. But he did know how to make a handful of dishes and could make them excellent.
“94.” Tony corrected, “She had a mild stroke and finally agreed to retire. So yes, she was still running things at Shield with… Fury.” His face hardened. “He knew. That bastard knew, there is no way he didn’t know about this and like everything else he kept it from me.”
“Family time is very important to the Avengers, and is comprised of team meals taken together. Helping Peter Parker Stark with his homework. Playing with Zachary Stark. Having movie nights, and other relaxing activities.”
Closing his eyes Tony lay his head on Steve’s chest, “What did I do to deserve an Alpha like you?” He asked snuggling into Steve’s broad torso.
“That explains the super healthy body-builder lunches you’ve been having.” MJ said. She wiped her fingers on kitchen towel, “So are you really going to wait until after college to start being a superhero?”
“Have I ever told you how grateful I am that we met?” He asked Tony, tugging the Billionaire closer, “I don’t think I could survived this world without you, and I don’t think I have ever been happier than I am now I’ve got you and the boys.”
“But he is here.” Steve bit his bottom lip and shifted uncomfortably, “We even worked with Deadpool once!”
The complete download took nearly an hour, both to download from the servers and to them get used to using a body. Coordinating limbs was not something Jarvis had ever done and it took him time to get used to moving them, standing upright and walking.
After dessert they lingered over coffee, their fingers intwined across the table and their eyes darting nervously as they spoke, they neither of them wanted the date to end, partly because they were enjoying themselves so much and also because they both knew what the end of the date could mean; Sex. They were not really ready to take their relationship to a physical level, they still needed to get to know each-other better, grow more comfortable with each-other before going beyond kissing.
“Peter looks good.” Rhodey observed, “He’s gotten over what happened I take it, physically at least?”
Natasha and Clint easily took down the guards hardly making a sound as they swiftly and expertly dealt with them, while Tony entered the property and followed the scent of sex, stale alcohol, pot, and bad plumbing.
Steve scratched his head and squinted at the impossible amount of poles and pegs that were laying on the sand besides the tent material. In his day tents had been simple things, a few poles, a few pegs, put the tent over it and there you go. Not it seemed that you needed a degree in mechanics to get these things put up.
That was what everyone wanted wasn’t it? That was what Star Trek had been promoting, the utopian race where war, disease, deformity, and everything humanity struggled with right now was gone.
As Tony took to the air Rhodey joined him and between them they rained down repulsor blasts on Killian until he was face down on the ground as Zach had stepped away giving them the chance to go in low and finish him. They continued firing until there was nothing but charred piles of smoking flash and bone left which Natasha took pleasure in kicking into the wind.
“Right I’m not.” Peter agreed thankful there was someone on his side even if it was a vicious teenage girl who was terrifying, maybe she was taking lessons of Natasha….
“Cool, although not the junk food part, at least not for me.” Tony said, “Not all of us have enhanced metabolisms and at my age everything goes to my ass already.”
“They’re fine, they’re right here.” Steve said helping Tony to sit up, he supported him as Tony was still pretty shaky but he managed a smile and held out his arms for the boys, who ran to him right away, throwing themselves into his arms and burying their faces against his neck and chest.
“Fuck.” MJ breathed, running her hands through her hair. By now a crowd had gathered to watch the fight, several kids were recording it on their phones and were cheering the boys on.
Steve snorted and tried to hide his laughter while Tony huffed, “Just because I like scientific movies to have at least some facts to make them believable.”
God it made his heart ache to think of it, to see how easily Tony interacted with his Son. He couldn’t imagine Howard being welcoming to a child interrupting him during a serious discussion, or having a child on his lap the way Tony happily did.
“Anemones.” Tony corrected while Peter snorted with laughter over Zach calling them enemas. Even Bruce’s lips were twitching at the mistake.
“No.” Peter whispered swaying dangerously as the Doctor stood up, he tried to coordinate his limbs, tried to stop the guards from taking hold of him, but everything was becoming fuzzy and he was so tired…. “Mmm’sorry Mamma.” He slurred as he was roughly dropped onto a gurney and strapped down, “So sorry.”
Finally Thursday evening rolled around and the family all piled into the Quinjet which was stuffed with their belongings, food, drink, and toys, plus camping equipment so Peter and Zach could camp on the beach.
Steve was the first out and they both raced over to the boys tent where they found Zach screaming at the tiniest lizard either of them had ever seen.
Having no way of dealing with this himself since he was wheelchair bound and wasn’t going to dump all of this on Spider Man’s shoulders, Rhodey swallowed his pride, his anger, and called Steve Rogers and the Rogues, getting them back to America and the compound on a stealth jet.
Stark’s dark eyes were on him again, “What makes you think I’m not?” He shot back, and soon revealed that he had a program or something “Hacking” Shield’s files because he didn’t trust Fury to be telling the truth, which, Steve had to admit, he was questioning himself.
Once the emergency services arrived on the scene they began to take over the rescue effort, the fire department got to work on putting the fires out while the Police too brief statements and rounded up the workers for further questioning, they took statements from the avengers too, but allowed them to keep on working, the medical services took away the first woman to be pulled out of the debris and soon had several other people to care for, all suffering burns, smoke inhalation, blast wounds, and crush injuries, that would likely prove fatal even with medical intervention.
He thought back, trying to push away the thoughts of his nightmare, but that had been going on for so long, had been replaying in his mind since….the base, Struckers base. Yes, he’d been in Struckers base and he’d been…., hurt, he remembered pain, remembered blood, he’d been hurt, he’d been shot.
Tears blurred Zach’s eyes as he turned and fled, pushing past Peter and ran for his bedroom, shutting the door and ran to his bed to grab his favourite cuddly toy, before he scrambled under the bed and curled up in a ball, crying into his toy.
Steve called ahead to the Compound, alerting Natasha to the situation regarding Wanda. He didn’t use the open line as he didn’t want to spook the Sokovian, so he called Natasha’s mobile, speaking to her privately.
“Unfortunate?” Norman laughed, “I would call this criminal assault.” He looked at Tony challengingly, “You are lucky I am not pursing criminal charges against your brat.”
“If we can put aside our team mates bedroom activities, can we get onto talking about why we’re here?” Bruce asked. He had an experiment back in his lab that he wanted to get back to. He was in one of his flustered and preoccupied states, where he had an ink smudge on his cheek, his shirt untucked, a couple of buttons done up in the wrong holes, and his hair was sticking up all over the place.
After a few minutes of cuddles, apologies, and assurances, Tony managed to get Zach on his hip and Peter at his side, leading the way to the family room with the team following, where Happy was waiting apparently on the phone with both Rhodey and Pepper, who both yelled at Tony for scaring them half to death and told (Threatened) him that they were on their way over.
Zach giggled into Tony’s side and slowly lifted his head to look up at Tony, “I need you to keep an eye on those three menaces and stop this evil AI scheme from becoming a reality.”
Fortunately Thor proved to be on their side and after a brief skirmish that flattered half a forest they were able to be on their way once again, arrived back a Shield where Loki was put in containment while the rest of them sat around a conference table discussing the situation which led to Stark and Banner going off to the labs to try and find the tesseract.
Steve sighed heavily from where he was sat besides Tony in the lab on the dilapidated couch as Dumm-E, You, and Butterfingers dithered nearby, concerned with their creators wellbeing.
The alpha in him longed to shove himself between Tony and those interlopers and start snarling and stake his claim so that all of them would know who they would be challenging if they dared to try and take Tony for themselves.
SI PR deemed it a success and the team enjoyed that brief moment of peace, then they had practical back to back missions as they found Hydra bases they had to go and take care of. Three in the space of one month, and if that was not enough, Dr Doom, or rather Dr Dumbass as Tony insisted on calling him, decided to launch an attack on New York to call out Reed Richards and the Fantastic Four, thus ending the partial anonymity they had enjoyed prior to the exposure.
Sam immediately began to protest, offering Steve his own bed while Tony scoffed at Steve’s chivalry,
“It’s true!” Steve persisted, “My hands no longer have a will of their own, they are captives of your ass!”
“Well we can keep it simple.” Tony said, “We don’t have to go extravagant. We can just go to the court house with our friends and then have a reception here.”
“Friend Darcy wished to try Asgardian Mead and my dearest Jane had a glass too. It made them both very merry and they wished to give me a makeover.” Thor replied. Spying Clint’s breakfast he slapped the archer on the back almost hard enough to knock him right through the table, “Friend Hawk, soon you will be the size of Volstagg!”
“I’ll help him dispose of your body.” Natasha said her voice devoid of any emotion as she stared at Killian, “Acid should do the trick, right Clint?”
Tony sniffed at Steve’s retort, “Anywhere you are being held against your will is a prison,” he stated, “I am right aren’t I Jay?” He looked to the android expectantly,
“What happened?” He asked, trying to wet his lips but his tongue was dry until Bruce moved a cup with a straw to his lips and he was able to drink down water.
“Oh shit, oh shit, shit, shit!” Peter cursed, he hurriedly broke the restraints on the tentacle guy and put his arms around him to help him sit up, grimacing as the guy puked up black goo and groaned, “C’mon man, we’ve gotta find a way out of here.” Peter urged him, trying to get him to move.
Of all the people Tony had expected to find inside the mansion that he, Clint, and Natasha broke into, a drunken, drug addled, lecher was not one of them.
Tony sniffed and wiped at his face, “Why can’t kids remain cute and innocent, why do they have to become teenagers? Its like they become demonically possessed the second hormones hit their blood.”
“Well giddy up cowboy, I’m fully prepared to have a little death with you!” Deadpool leaned forward and stage whispered, “My pants have Velcro seems for easy access to my ass-ets!”
It really should have been a simple matter of taking Loki into custody and securing the Tesseract and Sceptre, but of course nothing was ever simple as Pierce showed up demanding that the Tesseract be turned over to the WSC and Tony’s already damaged Arc reactor decided to fail. Thor managed to kick start it again, but while everyone’s attention was on him as he went into cardiac arrythmia on the floor, the tesseract got knocked across the floor and Loki took the opportunity to grab it and use it to escape.
Meanwhile Peter and Zach would be growing up with strangers, possibly abusive strangers, or those who didn’t care about them so they were neglected.
“The Scavengers,” Tony snorted at the name that Pepper had taken to calling the Avengers since the fight with Rogers. “I have had Rogers on the phone more than a dozen times. Even threats of having the law involved aren’t helping, and if it’s not him calling, it’s Romanoff, and that bitch knows how to bypass call blocks, or she knows someone who can do it for her.”
Your Uncle Happy might one day grow a pair and ask your Auntie Pepper out on a date, maybe you’ll get to see them get together at last. Maybe they’ll give you a little brother or sister to play with.” He kissed Zach’s forehead and smiled through his tears at the innocent oblivious baby, “I really wish I could see you grow up, because you are going to be so special and so perfect, the best Stark the world has ever seen.”
“Miss Potts wants confirmation that you are cancelling the party.” Natalie said eyeing the blackened veins on Tony’s neck.
“When we get there let me get out of the car first.” Tony said, “That way I can distract the Paps and you can each take a moment to get yourselves ready.”
Zach shrugged, “Never had a Daddy, fink it be nice though, Steef be a nice Daddy.” He looked up at Peter, “Was your Daddy nice?” he asked.
“What have you just said, my Omega?” Steve asked in a husky voice, the words roughened at the end. The next growl reverberated through the Alpha’s chest and made his entire body shivered in expectation.
Steve’s smile was soft then, sweetened by Tony’s cute expression and loud purrs. “You okay sweet thing?” He asked softly, bumping their noses together affectionately.
«I’ve got you, my love, I’ve got you.» He said, very fondly. Seeing Steve like that hurted him every single time: he was supposed to be the strongest and the bravest of them all, not vulnerable… not scared, and certainly not shaken and anxious. However, Tony was fully aware that nobody had to be nothing but theirselves, and he loved Steve completely, even when he was afraid. He just would have preferred him to be always happy, satisfied and protected.
Tony offered him to live in the Tower as well, and of course the genius tried to act like it wasn’t a big deal. He still thought that buying a whole new wardrobe, providing Bucky with the newest Stark Industries’ technologies and improving his artificial arm was something normal, because he was a nice host. Steve knew better, and he showed gratitude tp Tony also from his best friend,
Standing in the middle of the room, Steve was rocking their son, murmuring shh, praying him to stay calm, to stop yelling, and even in the dim lights Tony noticed big teardrops falling from their eyes.
Forgetting everything Sam said only half an hour earlier, Steve stood up carefully, without meaning to appear authoritative. He unbuttoned the three buttons of his gray Henley shirt, after which he removed it in a slow motion. Tony and his growls froze, and it was his turn to look stunned and bewildered.
In the meantime, Natasha had just pointed her phone’s camera one them, very discreetly. Any time was a good time to get blackmailing and compromising material on his friends.
Both of them turned their heads to the little Omega who was scrunching his nose, looking at them basically disgusted. That was still a good reaction at least: the first time Mary caught them making out, her Alpha instincts made her try to assault Steve as if he was hurting her Omega parent. Then, for a week, she drew her family putting the big Alpha in the very corner of the papers, far away from the two Omegas he had to protect.
Steve roared from the depths of his throat, and Tony could have sworn that the whole Tower trembled by the power of that sound. Natasha and Clint chose to leave in that moment, covered by the sound of the Starkphone hitting the floor. Tony barely had time to realize what was happening, that he had Steve on him, and his strong scent all around him. He felt his mouth dry and his eyes spreading.
“Then what did you guys do?” For the sake of his marriage, Steve followed his instincts and didn’t press more on the other topic.
He felt his husband sighing before hearing him, his chest raised and lowered a few times before he answered. “It was war,” he started, voicedeep, low enough to not wake Peter up again. A muscle of his jaw twitched, while sadness crossed Tony’s face.
. I love the name,” He announced while throwing himself at Steve, as much as his big belly allowed him, without lifting up from the chair. Steve turned to catch him instinctively, and he circled his body with both arms, hugging tightly. Tears filled the Omega’s eyes, but he hid them burying his face in Steve’s neck and hugging back with the same strength.
,” he exaggerated, stretching the words to emphasize them, and Peter chuckled a little. Steve murmured something like: “I’m barely a hundred”, but they ignored him.
Steve’s big hand circled around the base of Tony’s neck guiding him closer, tilting his head so Tony could scent him, until his face filled the space between the Alpha’s neck and shoulder. The Omega gulped as he buried his fingers in Steve’s shirt, holding onto him as if he was the only thing keeping him together.
Tony’s hazel eyes were wide open, liquid and wet at the edges. He wasn’t pouting anymore but his lips were still curled, as if he was keeping them still. He was. Tony’s lips always trembled a little when he was emotional, and it was another detail Steve loved about him.
“Nothing’s fine, you let your hair grow and I’ve warned you I’d want to style them, and now they are just–Ugh, they don’t wanna cooperate. They’re doing it on purpose to provoke me!”
“It reminded him that he’s pregnant, he has to avoid certain things and he can’t call Jason Momoa. Otherwise, this waffle will take him to the hospital and ask the doctor to put him on bed rest for the remainder of the pregnancy”
Tony’s heart melted at the promise, as he tried to blend into his Alpha’s chest, a place where he knew he’d no longer fear anything else. He could protect himself, Peter, and Steve too, but his Omega were fervent by hearing his Alpha vowing to take there of him.
“Alpha?” He called in a whisper. Steve turned his head and Tony knew he did just by instinct because his eyes weren’t focused completely on him. He was thinking to something else. “Everything’s fine?”
“Me too, Alpha” Tony answered out of breath, panting heavily, his legs going around Steve’s waist automatically and a rush of wet coating his tights.
, because Steve saw him like that, and Steve was right, he had the ability to look directly at his soul.
“Hi there, miss scientist,” he greeted Mary, scooping her up as she left her spot on the couch to throw herself at him. “Morning baby boy,” he said to Peter, who circled his waist with his arms and pressed his chin against his stomach, looking up first with a sunny smile, that was all Tony’s, then it became a little pout with a frown. Most of his facial expressions were all Tony’s, really.
Tony was still calling him, and Steve knew he should’ve listened to, there was something important on which he wasn’t able to focus in that moment, even if he should’ve paid attention. His mouth crushed on Tony’s with a rough motion that made him whimper, and he took full advantage of his sharp gasp to slid again his tongue inside the Omega’s mouth. Boiling, throbbing waves worked their way down his groin, and he jerked his hips forward, rocking against Tony again.
«When I didn’t see the light, I thought… Thought that you were in danger.» Steve sighed and reached for Tony’s hand, to interlace their fingers.
, if you didn’t want to hear a never-ending scolding, by a very growling and very disgruntled Omega.
“And after seventy years, I’m still ignoring you,” he answered, very mature. His best friend had the ability to make him sound like a sixteen-year-old again.
“Clint said you didn’t say a word to him when he was here earlier, and something about killer vibes,”
voice? The same voice he used for those stupid videos the government asked Captain America to play. Wade didn’t laugh, so there were still chances they didn’t watch those videos at Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters.
When they fell in love, Steve’s nights became a beautiful place where to find safety, because he was able to fall asleep in Tony’s arms, or with him in his own. He started to have good dreams instead of bad, even when his boyfriend spent the whole nights in the workshop.
He didn’t really know what kind of sessions Tony had; he didn’t even know who the therapist was. However, he saw his improvements, he saw and supported his Omega dealing with his past, slowly letting go of his desire of total control, accepting his own PTSD, that the armors he created without sleeping or eating for days were the mirror of his protective nature gone too extreme. He saw him stopping from trying to fix his mental health by building armors to deal with his fears and dealing with them in a more vulnerable, exposed way. He also accepted to be Steve’s Omega; a step so big it still amazed both of them sometime. And then, his armors became a shield to the world, and he became the Earth’s best protector.
It didn’t happen a lot anymore, because they went in therapy, the Alpha to his group sessions, the Omega in private. They worked really hard, and their first big result turned 9 years old that year.
Tony didn’t know why he started thinking of him as Cap, they spent so many years together it was natural for him to recognize when Steve switched on the Captain America button. It was all about the rich timbre of his voice, firm and powerful, and the way he moved and dealt with people.
Tony nodded, and Steve saw the shadow of a smile forming on his curled lips when their gaze met. The Omega cupped Steve’s face with both hands and leaned up on his tiptoes, pressing their mouth together.
The Alpha couldn’t tolerate that behavior. It didn’t happen a lot anymore, Tony shutting himself in, thinking his problems weren’t as relevant as anybody else’s. Tony underestimating his issues, thinking they weren’t worth the bother…that he wasn’t worth it. Tony thinking he was too handful and not fucking worth it. He had his money, he had his brain, so what if that beautiful, brilliant and intricate citadel that was his mind was constantly under attack by a critical amount of stress, panic, anxiety, a great sense of guilt and so many other terrible things?
At the start of the pregnancy, Tony hated everyone who had dared to think he had become suddenly incapable to take care of himself... More than usual. Then, he experienced extreme tiredness, unexpected irritation and he found very satisfying looking at people do things for him: it was like he was in command again. After Pepper became CEO of his company, and since Steve was the Captain of the Avengers, all that remained to him were insubordinate bots and a sassy A.I.
Steve restrained a chuckle, but did as Tony ordered, gradually unzipping the suit from the back. It was very innocent considering the things they did together… or to each other, but the Alpha’s chest raised with pride in being desired by his beloved Omega, and he released a low, deep rumble.
He was about to dozing off too, his head was swinging in sync with the sweet lullaby, but a notification on his sunglasses made him fully awake again. He was about to ask JARVIS if he was joking, with a more colorful language - Peter was still too little to register bad words - but the steps he heard down the aisle of their bedroom were enough for an answer.
“I said- Last week I said I was okay, with Peter being a friend with an Alpha. I am. I’m glad he has friends, it’s what we want for him: a normal childhood. He’s young, too young even to think about bonding, and even with Alpha friends or not, he will be the one choosing if to bond and with whom. It’s logical, I work- I’m great with logical, logic keeps my world quiet. You know how noisy my head is, how… And what I feel…”
Last night, the Omega caught him off guards: he didn’t expect to be accused of losing interest in the most brilliant, breathtaking, handsome man on the entire planet. The thought kept him awake all night, and he hoped breakfast would’ve been a chance to clarify, to remember Tony he loved him above anything else.
It was one of his most powerful moves, used only for emergencies: Captain America’s suit was comfortable enough, Tony made it after all, but wearing it to make love to his mate was… highly inappropriate. If it were for Tony, he would wear the suit to celebrate every anniversary, even the ones not related to their relationship. He was such a fanboy, and that’s exactly why he used carefully that powerful trump card, which worked every time.
“I left as soon as the backup from Wakanda arrived. They can handle it, and the Avengers are fully prepared to fight without me and you. I’m sorry-”
«I know, but, uhm…. You got used to its light. I’ll think about something to help, ‘kay?» Tony slurred the last word.
Slowly, they brush also their lips together, not really kissing, just to feel the closeness of each other. Their eyes were open, clear sky-blue mirroring into caramel brown, communicating in a way only they could understand.
He wasn’t leaking anymore, but he could still feel the fluid warming his left tight. It shouldn’t be possible to scent it behind his clothes and outdoor, unless the super-soldier serum, or a mutation that made you more animal than human enhanced you. He would laugh at that coincidence, making a joke even, if he wasn’t focusing too hard on suppressing the humiliation.
«Your- Your arc reactor,» Steve’s dry throat made him sound even more exposed. «It’s gone.» He whispered, lowering his gaze.
Steve’s eyes widened in surprise, and a strong sense of guilt made the last bite more difficult to swallow. His rumbles eased, becoming a background noise.
Tony narrowed his eyes, while his arms circled automatically around Steve’s waist, bringing them closer, chest to chest. He had to bend his head backward, and Steve’s fingers spasmed and clenched around his neck, sending shivers down to his spine.
“You,” he said hoarsely, more of a growl than anything. “Pretty Omega, I’m gonna eat you out so well you’ll forget what day it is.”
It has been so easy to slide every doubt away, while Steve’s embrace warmed him. That was the magic place where all the worries had to stay far, far away, where he felt protected, and secure. His Alpha took care of everything that annoyed him, while whispering sweet swords, and committing to his Omega one kiss after the other. Steve looked at him as if he was the most precious and mysterious Omega in the world, and
It felt like heaven, Tony’s lips were warm, soft and pliant. They were coordinated, the Omega offered, and the Alpha took, Steve applied pressure and Tony angled his head giving him access, opening his mouth and accepting submissive Steve’s tongue. Steve growled in satisfaction at his Omega’s acceptance, swept his tongue deeper, sliding along Tony’s own, and curled them together.
, with dark and possessive eyes. On the other hand, he reduced Tony as an exquisite, lustful mess, at the mercy of his Alpha’s delight. as an exquisite, lustful mess, at the mercy of his Alpha’s delight.
“You aren't going anywhere,” Steve repeated, stressing the phrase with a possessive growl that had Tony whimpering. “I’ll protect you,”
Thrilled by Steve’s possible idea, he dotted kissed long his jawline, growling happily and making his mate chuckling. Everybody thought he had the cutest growl and it was true, either when he was upset or delighted. He only hoped that the idea wouldn’t have required himself on his knees, because frankly, that would have been beyond his current physical abilities. But he would’ve totally agreed to lie down on the bed, both Steve and him on one side, his hot mouth wrapped around the Alpha’s big cock-
Because he’s proud, Tony’s mind suggested, Captain America’s a showoff, and there’re high chances that’s all because of me. Well, he gladly took all the credit, ignoring that he was being objectified. Just for once, he promised to whom, he didn’t know, but it seemed an important thing to do. Steve knew too well how to mess up with his brain.
There he was, in his and Steve’s bedroom - Peter’s crib would’ve been there for a long time - hugging the most stunning, curious and incredible creature in the world. Hugging Peter brought him joy, and set his mind at ease, a hard work that, before he had a son, only one other person could do.
“Are you gonna proposing again?” Tony’s throat sounded dry. Typical of him, joking at the worst possible time.
“The baby gets all your attention, you never look at me anymore. You- You’ll grow tired of me, bored.”
To keep himself awake, his slid his fingers through Steve’s hair, playing with them. “Tell me what’s botherin’you first,” he slurred a little, collapsing with his head on Steve’s shoulder.
Steve rolled his eyes but stopped, for the moment, to undress from his work suit. Tony loved his furniture.
“There, there, everything’s fine my little prince. You’re just scared, aren’t you? Papa didn’t wanna frighten you, you’ve heard him. Come on baby, daddy’s got you.
Tony’s eyes widened as his own narrowed. It was difficult for both of them letting go of each other. Steve knew how he looked from the Omega’s view: big, powerful,
Right, he has told Steve to hold that thought, didn’t he? First Peter’s and almost certainty Mary’s bedtime story, then sweet, sweet time for him with the big Alpha.
“Go with your sister in the kitchen and get the ingredients for pancakes, we’ll be there in a moment,” Steve instructed them, putting Mary on the ground.
“Shouldn’t I tell you so, Omega?” His blue eyes sparkled with such a piercing ecstasy Tony felt his heart pumping faster, and shivers of arousal made him twitch between his legs. Steve read the excitement on his body, and responded with a long, deep growl from his throat.
Tony looked back at him, his brown eyes sparkled when he saw the Alpha. He couldn’t get up though, his movements were limited by a blonde head resting on his lap, and by another bigger body curled around his sister and half pressed against Tony’s side. Their children were sleeping on him, wearing their favorite Captain Marvel and War Machine footie pajamas.
“Hey Omega. What’s happening here?” He kept his voice down too, looking sweetly at their two sleepy children. The more they grew, the more their sleep became light, just like the both of them. Steve was sure his Omega was holding his charming purrs to avoid waking them up.
“You’re a f- OH, HILARIOUS, AND HERE I THOUGHT THAT’S MY PLANE!” He speeded up anyway, bordering on running. Half of the jet belonged to Steve, his mind recalled, and he promptly removed that thought. What’s mine is mine, and what’s Steve’s is mine too, so. Whatever, He was aching, because his Alpha was a fucking tease and he could blame only himself really, he’s been the bad influence in that sense, all over the years.
Steve was standing exactly in between him and Logan, so that the other Alpha could see Tony only over Steve’s shoulder, while if he had been shorter, he wouldn’t have seen the Omega at all. A small, remarkably logic thing, that his Alpha did to protect him. Steve knew he wasn’t the only one aware of his Omega’s arousal, but expect for his position, and how he instructed him not to get near Logan, there weren’t any other signs he was guarding Tony.
He left to return in their bedroom, where he changed his shirt in favor of one of Steve’s big hoodies - big for
Bucky’s eyebrows were furrowed, mouth set in an unimpressed line. “I’ll just pretend to understand and that ya gonna be totally normal parents for Peter”
He tried to focus on the children, while playing with his hands, just to do something. Mary was talking, moving the action figure in the air, and the attention was all on her. Although she was the smallest, and the youngest of the group, she took the charisma after Tony: she made people listen to her, and laugh, and think, and dream, more easily than a kid of her age – and even people of Tony’s age – will ever do.
, and I can’t wait your next heat for having you all to myself. Consider this trip as a break, and when we’ll be back, I’m planning to keep you in our bed, in my arms, purring for me, so satisfied and trembling you’ll forget what day it is and how many times I made you come”
“He won’t stop crying,” Steve said, voice broken, vulnerable like Tony hardly remember having ever heard. It made his heart hurting more, seeing his husband in that condition: messy hair, with puffy red eyes and the most wet-puppy expression that would’ve melt the coldest soul. “I didn’t mean- I had to make sure he was fine, I didn’t want to wake him up, and now, now he just-”
He felt Tony squirming, grasping for hair, his fingers in Steve’s hair, unsure if pulling him away to catch a breath, or to press him closer to be completely at his mercy. One of Steve’s hand spread wide behind his mate’s back, so that the border of the shelf couldn’t hurt him, and the Alpha could lean over making the Omega arching back under his weight.
When Tony was feeling anxious or overwhelmed, he didn’t hide anymore in his lab for days, building protections for himself and for all the people he loved.
“Oh, can I date him when we grow up?” Wade asked, stopping right before entering the jet, at a safe distance from them.
He didn’t look upset anymore, and that was very positive, therefore Steve decided to use that as an opportunity to make peace. Since Tony was remaining still, except for his hands and mouth, he closed the distance and took Tony’s wrists, yanking slightly to make his Omega pressing his fingers against his own chest.
He wasn’t that person anymore though. Steve made him…reevaluate and appreciate many things during the years together, including his gender. More than a decade, he thought cheerfully.  The Alpha really took care of him, and in exchange, he’s been the one who needed to be taken care of. When the Alpha’s instinct requested a mate to protect, Tony sought for protection. That was right, that was correct. It was the nature taking its course, and more importantly, it was Tony not going against the tide.
“Yeah, he figured. What’s going on Stevie?” Bucky had an inquisitor gaze, the kind that brought Steve’s memory back of almost a century.
Not finding his Alpha, combined with screams of their six-months-old baby, was the perfect mix for a panic attack. He stumbled leaving the bed; it was 3:28 in the fucking morning which meant he slept for barely two hours, but he had to be ready to deal with anything.
hoarse, his body lit up with sparks, and he was getting wet where Steve’s hands were rubbing, spreading his cheeks still above the under-suit’s skintight pants.
“What’s going on?” The Omega asked, while their bodies moved together, as if they were only one: Steve sat on the sofa and carried Tony down with him, who pressed his knees on both the Alpha’s sides. Tony circled his neck with both arms, and relaxed against his chest, while Steve wrapped him and brought him closer. Every movement was fluid, a dance they repeated many times through the years of their relationship.
“What if, sweetheart-” he swallowed, voice low and rough as he guided Tony’s face at his own throat again, but that time he leaned his own forward enough to breathe the Omega’s sweet scent as deep as he could, and then groaned. It was addicting enough to make him feel dazed, and disobeying his previous thoughts, his hand curled around his neck in a possessive hold. “What if I wear my suit for you tonight? Will you let me take care of you in our bed, beautiful Omega?” The words were so low and hoarse only Tony heard them.
“This is my I-miss-you-beard,” Steve explained, kissing him on the cheek and resting his lips there. “I grow it longer now that I have two of you”
Steve found himself wrapped in the Omega’s arm a few moments later and didn’t wince at all, even if Tony tried to sneak up on him. As if he couldn’t recognize Tony’s scent when he entered the kitchen.
“Wait, Omega wait. Of course I wasn’t trying to poison you. Since when you don’t like mangoes? You made me buy one just the other day,” it wasn’t the first time Tony was being unreasonable, and his pregnancy hormones made it worse.
They separated only for the time of a breath, diving back in the second after. That time though, Steve’s hands went down and
“I’m not holding anything against you, I didn’t even bring it up! Why do you think everything I say is only about our child?” He resisted the urge to stand up and to physically make Tony listen to him. He would never hurt his Omega, but someone needed to get him out from his own head.
His expression hardened, feeling on the verge of an explosion: what the fuck was Steve thinking? Since when he decided to whom Tony was allowed to get close? A growl threatened to leave his throat. Tony never gave him such decisional power on
“I’m sorry - I’m sorry Steve, Alpha,” He cried in another sudden change of heart, then stood on his toes to kiss him lovingly with a touch of anxiety. Steve promptly hugged him tightly, paying attention to his strength to not hurt Tony and the baby. Always so caring, his Alpha. “I’m all yours, we are - Alpha, I need -”
He knew that Tony was a heavy sleeper, but he was too nervous to remember it. The blue glow was off, and it was that light that kept him alive. Without the arc reactor, the shrapnel shards would have reached his heart and killed him.
When he understood the cause, he had to take a nice long bath in order to keep calm. Godfrey vaguely sounded like
Tony promptly followed his son, with a smirk on his lips that made Steve raise a quizzical brow. The Alpha lifted Peter up with his free arm, while Tony stepped in his husband’s space and pressed their mouth together, making Steve feel more his smile.
Steve was so used to it, that when he didn’t find anything, he didn’t realize the weight of Tony on the mattress, he just thought that probably he was still in the lab.
pleased. In fact, he was the least satisfied man in the entire universe, and he totally blamed Steve for that. His boyfriend knew that Tony was in a unique status and he needed more attention than anybody else, all his urges to be satisfied, and all his wishes to be granted.
The Omega could tell his Alpha was content too, from the deep rumbling noise coming from his chest, vibrating in Tony’s own. Steve leaned down more and angled his head to place a stream of adoring kisses to his jawline and then down his throat, nipping lightly, then sucking the same spot just enough to make it redden a little, knowing the color would return to normal a few moments later.
“Don’t be,” Tony cut Steve off, shaking his head. He wasn’t really angry; he was sad and out of sorts, but they had enormous responsibilities towards the World, and sacrifices were the norm.
“Alpha,” he whined, but doing as his Alpha commanded, pressing his forehead against Steve’s shoulder. They both huffed and sighed, but there weren’t much they could do.
“Let’s go,” he said after a beat, instead of answering. The tinted sunglasses took their places, and he turned to Steve just to take Mary from his arms, before following Peter and Ned, who were already running toward the incoming car. They’ve being standing near the private jet until that moment.
“Why are you saying…” Steve shushed him sweetly, before he finished talking. The Omega tighten his grip, and Steve’s arm wrapped around his waist, while the other hand found his place into Tony’s hair.
“Wade!” Steve shouted, “Wait a minute before you go in,” the kids were probably on the airstair already, but it didn’t matter to Tony, because his Alpha’s eyes weren’t on him, and that thought made everything else insignificant.
“He said when we grow up, he’s gonna be Ned’s Alpha and mine,” his face became bright red, but he let his words out with no embarrassment. He sounded quite proud actually, and Tony recognized when Steve’s Alpha instincts kicked in, by the way he was looking at Peter.
Tony bit his bottom lip suppressing a moan, but he also showed his neck, submitting to the Alpha’s attention. Mary gave him a quizzical look, tilting her head and resting a cheek against his Pops’ collarbone. He reassured her with a smile, releasing his bottom lip but still keeping them sealed. Steve’s hand on his hip abandoned the place in favor of a more pleasurable one, it cupped one of his soft globes, squeezed, then massaged the flesh, and Tony had to hide his face against Steve’s shoulder to not let their daughter see his heated expression.
“Hey miss Potts, why you didn’t answer by the first ring? I don’t care that you were on a meeting, listen to me - Yes, you aren’t my assistant anymore, but that doesn’t mean - No, I can’t tell you what I want, because you won’t let me finish talking!” There were screaming on both sides of the line, as usual.
That was the only sound in the room; Steve could hear the background electromagnetic vibrations, even the fridge light if he focused enough, but that was just him, his super hearing. He was quite used to all the background noises, the ones every other human didn’t even know were there. Well, sure Tony knew they existed, everything had a sound, but in that moment, Steve was certain his Omega could hear only his growling. That was all what he wanted, Tony listening to him only, but his lack of purr was making Steve’s concern grow more.
“Good morning,” Bucky yawned as he entered the kitchen of the communal floor. If Steve wasn’t busy glaring at his pancakes, he would’ve told Bucky to cover his damn mouth. He growled thought, a deep sound that would’ve made anyone else turning back on the spot.
“What else was I supposed to do Omega–tell him no? That he could invite only one friend, and that friend should’ve been Ned?” He sounded sourer than he wanted, but it was too late to go back on his words.
"Come on Tony; let's let the two love birds have some fun." Steve flipped out the ring, and Tony followed after. The two laughed at nothing, and Natasha watched with curiosity. "I wonder what's gotten into them?" Clint asked, stretching his arms. The woman shrugged. A thought passed through her mind, and she shuddered. Just don't let it be what I think it is.
"Keep doing that and we're both going to drown." Tony warned, not wanting him to stop. "It'd be worth it." the blond whispered, before letting go of Tony. The brunette turned around, confused. "Where'd you go?" he called, not seeing Steve at the surface. He felt a light tug on his foot, and he held his breath as he was pulled down into the blue water, his lips being met with Steve's.
! He wished he could say he wasn't, but he didn't like to lie. He relaxed in his arm chair, picking up his favorite book,
He didn't bother to turn on the light, considering it better for both of them to leave it off. Steve finally reached the bed, but as he was about to toss Tony onto it, the brunette wrapped his arms around the blond and fell on him. The bed creaked under their combined weight, and it was too comfortable for Steve to even try and get up. Tony's breathing slowed, and the blond could tell he was asleep.
He reached a quarter ways through the bottle, and he wasn't feeling any better. He groaned, and lifted himself up. His better half finally won, and he decided to go see what was up with Steve. He quickly dressed, throwing on a long sleeve that Steve had gotten him, and some jeans. The tile of the hallway was cold beneath his feet as he walked towards the elevators. He hesitated for a moment, finger almost touching the down button. What if he doesn't want to talk to me? Tony felt his hand lower a bit. Maybe I should just leave him alone for now... He began to walk away, but the aching feeling in him told him that Steve was upset about something, and he might just want to talk about it. Tony turned around, pressing the call button, and going to Steve's floor.
"Come on Cap, let me go. I don't want your damn jacket." Tony tried to shrug the coat off, but Steve still held it in place. He began to laugh as Tony struggled, and the man smashed himself into the super soldier. Steve was expecting the attack, and caught him, wrapping his arms tight around the brunette. The two suddenly fell silent, their laughing ceased, and they looked into each other’s eyes.
. He sighed, and decided a nice soak would do him some good. The soldier flipped on his radio, a simple stereo, and tuned into a 50's station. Buddy Holly sang "Early in the Morning." It was just right.
Steve stood at the door, still dressed in uniform. "Hey, you ready to go for that little walk?" Tony nodded, and removed his robe. He was dressed in a fine suit, and Steve laughed. "Is that what you're wearing?" The brunette scowled. "I like my suits. Get off my back." He gently closed the door behind them, and placed the room key in his pocket.
"Up and at em boys! It's going on noon and Fury needs us to meet with him!" Natasha's voice filled the room, and Steve woke up with a start. He had slept on Tony's couch, wanting to make sure Tony didn't fall out of bed, or something worse. He rubbed his eyes, looking at the clock below the T.V, groaning. "Come on Natasha, five more minutes!" The soldier grumbled, flipping over onto his side. The female assassin smiled, and walked over to the closed curtain.
"I'm a, police officer." The blonde said, keeping her eyes locked on her menu. "What kind of weapons did you say you made?"
Tony tried to stop his leg from shaking, he was nervous. Pepper had completely sprung this on him, not telling him until she had him sit down that she wouldn't be joining him, but instead Steve would.
Steve sighed, and lay back in the bed, pushing the sheet away from his face. He looked out the bedroom window of Stark Towers; now renamed Avengers Tower after it had been fully remodeled. A light snow had begun to fall, sticking to the glass. Today wasn't exactly the best day for Steve to be out. He wanted to just stay in bed, and not deal with the world outside. Not deal with the fact that today was the day he had lost his best friend.
The clock chimed eight, and everyone gathered around the fireplace to watch old Christmas movies. They started off with A Christmas Carol, the oldest version Tony could get a hold of. He and Steve sat close on the couch, not close enough to raise suspicion, but still close enough to where they could whisper playful remarks without disturbing the others. “Thanks again Tony.” Steve muttered, the credits beginning to roll. “Anytime Cap.” Tony whispered back, taking his hand for a short second. They smiled, but quickly let go as Pepper shifted herself against Tony's side. Steve cast a longing look at his love, and tried to turn his attention back to the movie.
A few months had passed since the incident. New York City still has a long way to go until it would ever be close to being the same, but everyone is helping out. The Avengers have become very popular in the eyes of the citizens. The destruction of the city paid little heed to the saving of their lives.
Bruce in this fic is female. However, I don't lke calling her Brenda, so I feel better keeping her name Bruce.
Steve’s lips twitched; and he looked down at his hands. “I hate this.” He muttered to himself. “What?” Tony asked, focusing his attention on Steve. “This. I finally find the love of my life, and I don’t even get to hold his damn hand.” Tony pursed his lips, and placed his hand beneath the table, placing it on Steve's knee. The blond smiled, and placed one of his hands beneath the table as well.
Tony smiled at his plate, loaded with chicken, red potatoes, and green beans. "Yeah, I'll be waiting here." Tony mumbled as he pushed his food around on his plate. Steve got up quickly and fast walked out the door, eager to continue the dinner. Tony sighed as soon as the blond walked out the door, putting his hands behind his head and staring at the ceiling.
He inhaled one last time, and opened the door. Steve cried out in fear as he say a naked Stark before him. The other man screamed with him, surprised by his sudden arrival. "The hell Cap? Don't you knock?" Tony practically screamed. "You told me to come in I didn't know you would be naked!" The two stared at each other, wide eyed. "Just, hand me that towel and get out!" The brunette ordered. Steve was quick to comply, and shut the door behind himself. Natasha walked in with Clint just in time to see the soldier walking away quickly from the door.
"Oh my God... I'm the worst person on the planet..." he muttered, and Clint let go, placing a hand on Tony's shoulder instead. "I said all those things to him, God he probably hates me right now!" He shrugged off Clint's hand, and stood. "I'll be in the lab." he muttered, taking the stairs, and letting his tears finally fall.
"I'm saying that every time we try to get together something gets in the way! We're not meant to be together!"
Dinner went by smoothly, and the time passed by so quickly that by the time they finished eating, it was already nine o' clock. They had begun at six. An annoying buzz snapped the two out of their fantastic mood, and they looked to the counter to see Tony's phone buzzing across the counter. Tony sighed, and got up from his comfortable seat.
"So what are you thinking of getting?" Tony asked, staring daggers at his menu. Pepper pursed her lips in thought. "I don't know, what do you-" Pepper looked up, to see Tony was gone. She looked around confused, wondering where he could've run off to. She sighed and drank more of the schnapps, listening to the smooth jazz that played from the live band.
"No you listen. I went to a whole lot of trouble planning this damn thing out, and you two are going to sit down and talk this thing out like two civilized adults. Is that clear Captain?" Pepper said, voice demanding. Steve couldn't help but laugh. "I'll take that as a yes. Get dressed soldier, you have to be there in an hour." She hung up before the soldier could protest. He sat up, looking at the clock; it was only 12:30, way too early for him to be dealing with this. Nonetheless, he got up and got into the shower. Part of him, a part that he had been hiding for a very long time, was happy to be seeing Tony again. Maybe, this would be a chance to get them back together.
"We've already discussed it, we're not going to get back together, we both agreed." He sighed, not looking up at his friend. "It's too difficult to try and hide it from everyone."
"I-uh-I-" he stuttered, not sure what to say. "What am I saying? God, sorry Tony, we can just go eat, ignore me." Steve said, waving his hand and ears turning red. "Besides, I'm starving, I didn't eat breakfast so," He smiled softly, and began walking towards the table.
"Hey, where's Steve?" Bruce whispered to Tony. The man looked around, noticing everyone was distracted, and Steve must've slipped out. "I don't know, I'll try to go find him. Make sure everyone keeps having a good time, I'll be back in a sec." Tony quickly mumbled to Bruce, who nodded, and grabbed a bottle from the fridge. "Who's up for some drinks?" The whole room cheered, and Tony made his exit.
“So Steve, where do you train?” Ashley asked. “Oh, um, here in New York, but they had us move around a bit.” Steve said, pushing the food around with his fork. “Really? I don’t think I’ve seen a camp around here for a while.” Ashley said, trying to keep the conversation alive. “Well, that means they’ve been doing their job.” Steve mumbled.
He sighed. "Fine. I'll do it." he muttered, closing his eyes. "Great. I'll see you later then." She smiled, and walked out alone. Steve's phone buzzed, and he pulled it out to see who it was.
He ran a hand over his face, trying to hold back tears. His phone rang, and he answered without seeing who it was. "Hey handsome, you think you're up for dinner tonight? I'm coming back to New York for a few days, and figured we could celebrate." Pepper offered happily. "Hey, yeah. Sounds great. I'll talk to you later Pep." Tony said, hiding the shaking in his voice.
They ordered their drinks, and headed to a table in the back of the cafe. Steve held his black coffee, trying to find some feeling in them. Tony did the same. He didn't like his coffee too hot anyways. The two stared at each other, and Tony began to laugh.
"Kiss me." Tony demanded. "Kiss me, and I'll know you're real." He felt a tear work it's way down his cheek, but a swift hand came up and wiped it away, before moving itself down to Tony's chin, and tilt his face upwards. He took in a breath before Steve's warm, soft lips pressed against his own. The super solider wrapped an arm around the smaller man's waist, placing the other in between his shoulder blades, deepening the kiss. Tony wrapped his arms around Steve's neck, tears working their way out of his eyes. "It is you, oh God it really is you." Tony gasped, pulling away from the kiss and pressing their foreheads together. "I can't believe it's you, I can't believe it's you Steve-"
Bruce passed on the drinks, wanting to be sure he was in full control of himself at all times. He sipped lightly on his iced tea, laughing at Clint, who looked on the verge of passing out. His eyes were blood shot, probably from having downed five shots and chasing it with vodka. Tony of course was still fine, having built up an unhealthy tolerance to the drink. Steve turned down the alcohol. He wasn't too keen on drinking, even if it didn't affect him.
After the fight, they began cleaning up, as the cake had gotten just about everywhere. Tony poured drinks; he had bought Steve's favorite, blueberry schnapps. "To Captain America, the best and only super soldier I've ever known." He raised a glass, and all joined him in the toast. "Speech! Speech!" Clint said under a cupped hand. Steve smiled and got up from his spot on the couch. "Well, what is there to say except, thank you. You guys have made life so great, and," Steve paused, looking around the room, before his eyes fell on the brunette that he had been fighting with so often.
. He knew the chemical would explode at any moment, and if Bruce had done it right, the whole compound would be destroyed. Tony reached the man, and untangled the soldier's leg from the snare. A muffled explosion could be heard, and Tony wasted no time. He quickly grabbed the Captain, and flew them quickly towards the doors. The building went up just seconds after they made it out.
him already. He kissed the place he had nipped at, before biting down again, harder this time, and letting his tongue slide over it. Tony couldn't take much more. The soldier pulled himself off, and looked at Tony. He licked his lips, hungry for more. The brunette sat up, and crawled his way across the covers. Satin sheets caused him to lose his balance the slightest bit, but he gracefully caught himself, and he heard Steve giggle at him, before taking his chin in his hand. Steve was perched before him, on the edge of the bed. His smile, his eyes, all screamed for Tony. He reached the super soldier, and pressed himself against Steve's overly fit body.
He sighed, and picked her up. She nestled her head against his chest, the soft silk robe rubbing against her smooth skin. Tony placed her gently in their bed, and kissed her forehead. A knock at the door grabbed his attention, and he had to slow his pace he was so excited.
He wanted his old life back; he wanted to turn back time so that none of this had ever happened. He wanted to see his beloved Peggy, even just for a moment. But he couldn't. She was probably dead by now, as was Bucky. Steve knew he would have to move on, and let go of the past.
"We're welcome to bring guests, so if you wanted to..." the quiet man hinted and Tony nodded to show he understood. He would ask Steve later, after what happened that morning; he knew the blond wasn't up for questions. Steve was quiet for most of the meal, and finally Tony couldn't take it anymore. He leaned in to whisper in Steve's ear, muttering low so no one else heard. "What's wrong?" Steve simply pulled away, and gave Tony a dirty look. "I told you I didn't want to talk about it, now would you please drop it?" he hissed. Tony lips turned up in a snarl. "Well it's pretty hard to do that when you look like you just got his by a train!" Steve shoved the table back so hard drinks spilled onto the table top. He stormed out, and Clint went to get up to see what the hell was wrong, but Natasha stopped him.
"I mean neither. You're going to destroy the pictures, and I'm gonna do what I need to do." Steve said, eyes dark. "And how are you going to-" "Either you destroy the pictures," His voice deepened, "Or I tell everyone myself. And completely destroy your little story, and you become a laughing stock for trying to hook up with someone who doesn't even like you, or what you have."
"Natasha wasn't feeling well, so I offered to drive her back to the hotel. I figured I should stop by, make sure you were okay." Steve said as he stepped into the lab, his usually cold stare replaced by one of worry and a bit of guilt. "I'm fine. Get out." Tony said angrily, not taking his eyes off the other man. "I think I should apologize first. What I said earlier, it was way out of line," Steve said gently, walking slowly towards the brunette, whose expression only hardened. "Yeah. It was. Now get out. I don't need your stupid apology." The man said through clenched teeth, anger rising with each step that the soldier took.
“They're outta coffee.” The man mumbled, rubbing his tired eyes. He had stayed up late, working on one of his projects for Pepper to show off in whatever country she would be in. Steve clenched his fists, trying to keep calm. “Typical Tony.” he growled. The brunette swept a hand through his dark hair and turned around slowly. “Good morning to you too sunshine.” He smirked, but the soldier wasn’t in the mood for his jokes. He had more important things on his mind that he would rather try to ignore.
"Yes we are! Stop trying to say we're not! You and I both know, this is the happiest we've been in a long time!" Tony defended, but he knew he was losing; Steve was right, this wasn't working out, after they come out to the public, who knew how things would go? The press would be in their business all the time, it would be impossible to be alone... It would drive them apart just like they we're being driven apart now, and they were hiding it.
afraid to say? You're the one who constantly keeps to himself! The one who always has to be the tough guy! You never let anyone in!" he argued, his voice rising with each sentence.
Steve felt a hand grab his, and he looked up to see Ashley intertwining her fingers with his. He gave her an awkward smile, feigning embarrassment. The door to the cafe jingled open, and the soldier heard an all too familiar laugh. "Alright, I'll pay this time, but only because you actually got it to work." Tony chuckled as he and Bruce entered the cafe. Ashley was about to look over before he took her face in his hands, causing them both to blush.
Steve blushed bright red, watching as Tony moved in front of him, and he found himself being pulled into the music. He moved with Tony, following his steps. "This isn't awkward or anything." Steve laughed, and Tony laughed with him. "Only awkward if you make it that way." he said, and playfully pushed himself against the blond. Steve turned a deeper red as Tony began to dance, pulling him close and lip syncing the lyrics. The blond rolled his eyes and began to do the same.
“Tony? Steve?” Natasha called out into the empty hall, looking for the two lovers. She adjusted her blue dress, the tight fabric constricting her. “Where the hell are you two? Everyone is waiting!” she called out, louder this time. “We’re coming, we’re coming.” Tony muttered, a fussy Steve following behind him. “Steve, stop touching my damn hair.” he growled, causing the blond to smile. “You want to look good don’t you?” He tried to fix a strand that hung in the man’s beautiful face, but Tony swatted him away.
Steve looked up at her. "Excuse me?" "You heard me quite well. I want you. And if you don't accept my offer, these photos get leaked." Christine threatened, and Steve stiffened.
Steve immediately tensed, and glanced at Bruce, who now leaned on the counter casually. "I'm sorry?"
The blond began to fumble with his own pants, struggling with the stubborn belt as he fought to relieve himself from the agonizing pain that he could no longer ignore. Tony continued his rhythm, picking up some slight speed as he reached down to palm himself. Steve felt a moan escape his own lips as he was finally able to grab hold of himself and start pumping.
"I knew you'd like it." The brunette muttered as he kissed some frosting off his lover's lips. Steve kissed back, dipping his finger into the cake as well, and spreading it along Tony's jaw, making a trail for his lips to follow. The smaller man smirked as he realized what was happening, and began to spread some of the cake over his half naked body, giving the soldier a sweet surprise. The blond smiled, and sucked some frosting off Tony's neck before moving down to lick the crumbs off the other man's torso, dragging his tongue along the contours, and listening to his lover moan beneath him.
"Right. Bye Bruce. You two have fun." Steve stormed out, not looking back once. Bruce was left in confusion, shaking his head lightly. "So you were talking about that project?" Tony asked, heading to where his friend stood, pushing Steve out of his mind.
"Your girl's here, better snatch her before someone else does." Tony called back over his shoulder. Steve turned around to see Ashley entering the bar, a nervous look on her face. She spotted the soldier and her face lit up. Steve waved as he headed over to greet her. Ashley wrapped her arms around his neck and pecked him on the lips.
Tony and Steve groaned in unison, not happy to be getting up at such an early hour after a late night. Steve pushed himself off the couch, and walked to the coffee maker. "Ugh, you want a cup Stark?" he asked as he filled the pot. "When do I not?" Tony muttered, hiding behind the half wall that separated him from the burning sun, and the handsome soldier.
A blush rushed up to Steve's face, and he looked away, desperately trying to keep his feelings hidden.
His intense concentration was broken by the bathroom door slamming, leaving the soldier alone with his thoughts. Tony's retching caused Steve's blush to retreat, and he turned back to the coffee maker.
Steve watched her as she left, a feeling of relief flooding through him. He looked down, groaning. Damn broad. He thought sourly, and went about handling his new problem.
Steve looked at him, a boyish grin on his face, making his eyes crinkle up. Tony couldn't help but smile back. "Well, what do you already know?" The blond asked. Tony quickly told him the memories he had of last night, and the soldier laughed. "Aw Stark, you missed all the best parts."
Steve smiled, not sure of what to say. "Thanks guys, this means a lot to me." he said quietly, not meeting their eyes. Natasha peered at him questioningly, wondering what was bothering him. "So who wants cake?" Clint clapped his hands loudly, and everyone broke away to the large table. Steve looked at the cake, and laughed.
He got up from his comfortable position and walked out into the hall way. The corridor was empty, but the sound was much quieter. He banged on Tony's door, hoping he'd get the message. The brunette opened the door, his wet hair combed back. He was dressed in one of his fine silk robes, the front open. "Geeze Stark! Don't you have any decency?" Steve scrunched his face in disgust and put his hand up.
He heard Steve sniffle, and the blue-eyed man turned around to meet his gaze. "Have you been crying?" Tony groaned, not in the mood to deal with an upset super soldier. "What if I have been? Why are you even up here Stark?" The blond snapped; turning his head back towards the city.
The words repeated over and over in Tony's head, and his anger only worsened. He tightened a bolt on the large machine he was working on, making a little too tight and hearing the piece break. "Son of a bitch!" he yelled, and threw the tool across the lab, barely missing one of his more important projects. He held his breath as the tool bounced on the floor, cracking into pieces and scattering. He exhaled, and kicked the machine he had been previously working on. It was something for Pepper, it would help in the process of making car engines, make it a cleaner process. But at the moment, he could care less.
Steve watched as the two walked out the door, and Tony entered the room, looking as if nothing had happened. "Enjoy the show Captain?" he asked nonchalantly, and the blond glared at him. "Next time, how bout a little warning that you like to do your puking naked." retorted Steve. Tony laughed, taking a cup of coffee off the counter.
Steve couldn't look at him. "I never wanted us to end. I really didn't." he whispered. "Then don't let us, we can still be together! We can just, keep it a secret for a little longer..." Tony whispered back, holding onto the soldier's hand, choking back tears. "I can't do that Tony, I'm sick of hiding, and we both know we can't handle coming out, not yet. I need to leave, figure things out." The blond whispered. "Promise me," The other man whispered, "Promise me you'll come back, if you want to give this another try."
“I’m not stupid; I know exactly who you are.” He smiled, and leaned in close enough so their faces were only inches apart. “And also, I’m not into blondes.” Steve straightened, gave her a small nod, and walked away, leaving Christine open mouthed and pissed.
The next morning, he was awoken by the sound of the phone ringing. He rubbed the sleep from his eyes, yawning a hello into the phone. But sleep was quickly dashed away once he heard the voice on the other end. "Hello Captain, enjoy the show?"
The Captain America symbol had been drawn on it, and a picture of a young Steve sat in the middle where the star would usually be. "Where'd you guys find this?" he questioned, a tear trying to escape his eye. It really meant a lot to him that they had done this. "Natasha found it of course." Bruce laughed, and received a playful punch from the red head. Bruce tried to look amused, but when everyone had focused on Thor, he gently rubbed his arm.
"Fine." he said, and stuck out a hand. As he thought, Tony quickly pulled him into the pool, and he landed on top of the small brunette. They raced to the surface, laughing. "I would kill you if this water didn't feel so nice." Steve said, wiping water off his face. "But it does. You're welcome." Tony chuckled as he began to swim towards the edge of the pool. Steve pulled him back by his swim trunks. "Where do you think you're going?" Steve purred, pulling him back and against his chest. He nibbled gently on his ear, and Tony bit back a moan.
Steve clenched his teeth, his thoughts running wild, he couldn't think straight. He loved the surprise that Tony ensued, he never knew, -
Tony felt a hand turn him around briskly, and his eyes were met by a pair of blue ones. They studied him, looking over him, trying to look through him. But they couldn't. Tony's bloodshot eyes kept them from truly seeing what was wrong. Steve dropped his hands, but his eyes remained locked on Tony's. "Why won't you talk to me?" Steve questioned, his face stern.
Tony looked at a nearby pillar, covered in mirrors, and gasped. Two blue eyes stared back at him, full of recognition. He quickly looked over to Pepper, who gave him a confused look. "Alright, which ex did you see?" She joked. Tony laughed with her, trying to avoid looking at the mirrors. "No, it was nothing. Thought I saw someone, probably just a figment of my imagination." A waiter walked over to their table, holding a tray of drinks. "Here you are. Compliments of the couple at table twenty three." The waiter set down two glasses and a note.
Tony smiled humourlessly and tried to sound casual, “Yeah, well, you know how it is these days, then camera adds ten pounds and if I’m not careful middle age with start spreading…”
Natasha had brought them down outside of the city and away from the population so they could avoid contact with the locals. News of the Stark’s murder may not have made it into Europe yet, but it would soon, as would their own flight from America, so it was best to keep a low profile. At least that was what Natasha said.
“About that.” Pepper sighed, “We are going to have to tell them about this at some point, we can’t keep fobbing them off with serious but stable.”
They’d all known some of the story of course, the parts that had been made Public, Rhodey was probably the only one who’d known it all, except Tony had never before admitted to everything that had happened to him while he was in Afghanistan, not the full extent of what he’d gone through, certainly not the rape.
“No!” Zach yelled whirling around and shot his nerf gun at Clint, Dumm-E attempted to copy him, firing his extinguisher which sprayed Zach and the work station as he lifted it up to Clint’s grinning face, Dumm-E also misjudged the space and bumped into Zach knocking him over onto the foam slick floor, Zach skidded along on his bottom and came to a stop against Tony’s shins as he came in from the lift.
“I thought we’d sorted this out at the hospital.” Steve said, “You don’t have to prove anything to me, I’m not going anywhere, I love you regardless of whether or not we have an active sex life.”
Steve stroked Tony’s hair back from his face, “It says that your relationship with her was troubled, that you were not as close with her as you are with your sons. Which was her loss, her mistake for not being as devoted a Mother as you are.”
“They are adorable.” Steve laughed, “Especially little Zach, how do you keep from melting with those eyes?”
Within ten minutes of getting back to the tower Tony was in his under-suit and ready to go, joining the others on the quinjet and strapping in while Clint took them into the air and got them to cruising altitude at which point they could move around freely.
“I’ve heard of kids bouncing off the walls but sticking to them sounds a little extreme!” The host chuckled, “And you and Mr Stark decided to keep the enhancements private for the time being.”
By the end of the explanation Sam had not only poured them all a glass of scotch each, which Tony pushed away, he hadn’t had a drink since before Zach was born and he wasn’t going to start again now. But Sam also got the ben and jerry’s out of the freezer and a couple of spoons from the draw saying that this called for comfort food and alcohol.
Chuckling Rhodey set Zach down and he and Peter headed for their respective bedrooms squabbling as they went.
“How dare you say such a thing?” he asked of her, securing Lily better in his arms, “Tony has been nothing but welcoming and generous to me and Lily, and looks to have been to all of you too, not that you’d know it by the “Abundance of gratitude” you’re showing him,” His voice dripped with sarcasm and his generous mouth was pulled into a sneer,
When he turned he saw Steve standing in the doorway, grinning at him, “What?” He asked, bringing Lily back down to his chest,
Tony looked at him incredulous, “You think I’m sitting this out?” He scoffed, “Fuck that, Rogers. I’m coming with you. I want to know what’s going on at that camp too, so go and get some shut eye so you can be bright eyed and bushy tailed for a road trip.”
Tony held up his hand, “I won’t harm him. You can be outside the door. All I want to do is put the fear of…well me into him, and let him know exactly what will happen to him if he ever tries to leave whatever backwater witness protection drop him into.”
Steve calling the Chitauri ugly asses startled a laugh from Tony, he actually ended up feeling a little less terrified, a little more like they might have a hope after all.
Killian watched Tony’s escape onto the Catwalk and roared in fury letting loose a massive wave of fire that engulfed all of the stocks around him burning them to cinders and igniting further fires about the facility that were rapidly spreading as the flames came into contact with flammable substances to burn through.
“So… moving on, The Tower has actually survived pretty well, mostly only superficial damage that won’t take overly long clearing up. I should be able to have you, Bruce, and Thor moved in by the end of next week. I can even show you, your floor right now.”
“Go.” Steve ordered, as Lily gave a cry of distress obviously sensing the tension in the air and expressing her upset the only way that she could.
Steve wanted to comfort him, to tell him that Sharon was wrong in saying what she did but his mind was reeling over her having been spying on him, the fact she was Peggy’s niece, and the painful reminder of Peggy’s wandering fragmented mind.
“I’ll get him out of the hospital.” Thor said, he alone could approach Zach and withstand the heat coming from the Pup. Steve grabbed the Gods arm,
“You should have had him shot and thrown into the incinerator, not waited around for his fucking Mother to show up in that God forsaken armour of his, with his merry band of freaks right behind him!” Norman sounded on the verge of hysteria, his voice was shrill and Curien could make out the shaking of his body in the shadows of the car.
Peter pursed his lips as he considered this, it was possible Tony and Steve hadn’t mentioned Osborn’s more serious criminal activities, but Peter was pretty sure he’d have overheard something being said if they knew, it wasn’t like his hearing could miss anything now, not even when he wished it could. Hearing his parents having sex was seriously traumatizing.
How they could have been so distant to their only child Tony didn’t know. He adored spending time with Zach and Peter, even more so now that Zach was becoming more active and starting to move around, although he was dreading it when the Pup began walking, he’d be screwed trying to keep him out of trouble then.
“Now don’t worry Mr Stark.” Steve said in his Captain America voice, which had Tony burying his face into the pillows laughing, “Everything will be fine, this strange witchery that your ass possess will not be held against you and I shall do everything in my power to get you off….”
He took his hands away from his ears and gazed at the dead, decaying bodies of his family and friends, pleading with them to stop blaming him, “I’m sorry.” He whispered, “I did everything I could.”
“The signal must be blocked.” Tony said trying to shift as best he could beneath Steve’s weight and the weight of whatever was on top of them. “Shit, without it the suit can’t lock onto the bracelets.”
Tony wasn’t sure what he hated more, the pelvic examination he had endured at the doctors, or Norman Osborn.
“Shit.” Ned looked to Peter, “Do you think the investigation would have found out about it?” He asked, “Your Mamma’s investigation?”
Tony was released from medical in a wheelchair a few days later and went back to the tower, where he was allowed on crutches a week after that, and an air cast a week later, within the month his bones were completely healed and he was moving as easily as if he had never been injured at all.
With an undignified noise Peter slammed the stall door again and refused to come back out until MJ promised not to try and measure him, or make him wear leather or spandex. In fact it too Ned promising to share his Mum’s peanut-butter and chocolate chip brownies with him for Peter to leave the stall and venture back out into the school again.
He ended up walking for two miles before he found an open garage, there was a couch inside, patched and worn much like the dilapidated thing he kept in his workshop, he immediately took refuge upon it, sitting the suit besides himself and left his body rest for several minutes.
“My team is here.” Tony laughed even as more pain hit, “You are a screwed now, so screwed.” He grunted as the pressure in his pelvis increased. Blood flowed out of him, soaking into the bedsheet as the birth canal widened.
Natasha hissed something vitriolic in Russian at the TV and then scowled as a sticky arrow was fired at the screen courtesy of Clint. The two of them were watched a publicized debate between Pro-Ironman congressman Reynolds and Senator Stern, or Senator Assclown as Tony had called him several years earlier.
Tony rose and eyebrow at the Demi-God who grinned at Zach, apparently not minding the way he was pronouncing his name.
“Alright,” Steve agreed, frowning at the tremor in Tony’s hands as they gripped the wheel. There was not much he could do to repay Tony’s generosity and kindness to him, but he could look out for him, keep those sorry excuses for Avengers from hurting him anymore than they already had, and he made a promise to himself, to his lost husband, that he would do so.
“We’ll do the talking part later.” Tony said, moving to straddle Steve, “Make up sex now, followed by celebrating making up Sex, then post-celebrating making up sex, and finally practice Sex.”
“No.” Curien said, “What they both hate is not being able to control super soldiers, vigilantes, superheroes and mutants. They fear being powerless against you people, being undermined. Now if they could control super soldiers and mutants, have say an army of them at their beck and call, ready to do their every whim….” He trailed off with a small smile, as Tony and Steve quickly cottoned on to what he was saying.
“If you ever even contemplate touching Peter at any age, even if he is 103, then I swear I was hack all your limbs off, rip out all your intestines, boil your carcass in oil, and toss whatever is left into an active volcano!”
All in all it was a thoroughly enjoyable week for the film crew and a completely normal week for the Avengers when they weren’t dealing with super-villains or crises.
“Getting back to Hydra.” Steve said, “I don’t even know where to start. Zola said they’ve infiltrated Shield, so does that mean everyone is involved or just a few?”
“Pete.” Tony shook his head and nodded to Zach, urging Peter to stop since Zach was getting so upset.
“It had to have been done when Jarvis’ systems were down.” Tony said with tired finality. “Someone saw an opportunity and took advantage of it.”
“Tin Man.” Hulk bellowed leaping down onto the street to protect Iron Man, snarling at the bots who came close to him.
She had allowed the small display of Zach’s powers but didn’t want him to be constantly dealing with demands by the kids to show what he could do. He might have a good handle on his powers but accidents could still happen and if one of the kids got hurt then no matter what Tony said or did that would be the end of Zach’s schooling.
“We’ll be alright, thank you.” Steve said, “Although if you have something we can make a splint with for Tony’s wrist?”
Steve’s eyebrows rose and he opened his mouth in bewilderment while Bruce snorted, “Do you have any dignity left to loose at this point?” he asked Tony, who shrugged.
It had been Clint, unsurprisingly, who had come up with these titles, taking great pleasure in calling Tony Iron-Mom! The pillow fight/fist fight that had followed had been ridiculous to say the least.
Even Howard was dead, killed in a car accident with his wife twenty one years before Steve had been found. They did have a single Pup though, an Omega by the name of Anthony.
Tony groaned as the metal twisted and began to pinch, threatening to crush his foot, his ankle protesting when he tried to twist free.
“Yes.” Steve said his smile growing even more, “After the battle of New York, Tony welcomed me into his home and I became a part of the family, which expanded to include the whole team.” He chuckled, “It’s a little crazy at times, with a lot of different personalities, there is never a dull moment, what with Clint’s YouTube videos, Thor’s Pop Tart addictions, and of course supervillain attacks.”
Natasha, having spoken with Tony when she’d heard about him enrolling Zach in a martial arts school, had bought him a karate suit.
“You sure man?” Sam asked, “That head injury looks nasty,” He squinted at the cut on Steve’s head, “You sure you don’t need the hospital, either of you?” He looked back to Tony, making the effort to keep his eyes on Tony’s face not going any lower, a gesture Tony appreciated.
She was a young woman of perhaps thirty, she had a baby strapped to her chest in a papoose and a toddler at her side holding her hand. “What have I told you about watching where you’re running?” She scolded Robbie.
So they did. Dressed in traditional Wakandan garb, they were wed by a Wakandan priest with every superhero on Earth as witness as they exchanged vows.
“Good.” Rhodey said tipping his head back and closing his eyes, he could go to his own room to sleep but moving right now seemed like far too much effort, “With any luck we’ll have the answer we want and we can go home.”
“Jay, if you take over the world will you be kind to me?” Tony asked using damp fingers brush back his hair.
MJ shrugged, “You’re my friend, so long as you don’t become a psychopathic murderer I’m cool with you doing anything.” Peter grinned and made a move to hug her but MJ held her hands up, “I don’t hug, dork.”
“Who said they’d be indecent.” Tony replied with a shrug, “They could be very decent acts, I wasn’t suggesting we do anything really kinky, I was gonna leave tying you up to the privacy of our bedroom!”
Why would a man who could afford to dine at five star restaurants and order the most costly items on menus without making a dent in his petty cash chose to eat at fast food joints?
“Oh like you do the suits, opening expos and getting donuts in them!” Peter shot back, “As for you being scared, how about how me and Zach felt when you decided to challenge the fucking Mandarin on national TV?”
Leaving Steve to deal with the exhausting lunacy that was Deadpool, and praying that no one got turned into a kabob while the masked Merc with a mouth was on his premises. Tony finished making upgrades to his suit and began to go through the files he had salvaged from the Data Dump.
For the next ninety minutes he lay in bed waiting for his parents to go to bed. He already knew there was no way he could leave the tower via the lift or the stairs, Jarvis would alert Tony if he tried that, so there was only one possible route he could take that he wouldn’t be caught. Out of his bedroom window.
“Oh so this is my fault?” Curien cried, “Let me remind you, that you came to me, you wanted me to do those experiments, you knew the risk we were taking and you were the one who insisted on a self-destruct, not me.” He sneered into the gloom hoping Norman could see his face, “It’s not my fault that you trusted Hammer tech and it backfired, any idiot could have told you that anying he makes isn’t worth the money you spend on it.”
“Jarvis can’t get through, the explosion must have shorted out Tony and Steve’s Com.” At least that was what Rhodey was telling himself, refusing to believe that it was anything other than a malfunction of tech. He wouldn’t believe it was anything else, not until he was confronted with a body.
They were across the city within moments with Clint setting the jet down in the car park where people were running out of the factory. The entrance was a smoking ruin and alarms were blaring loudly as the Avengers disembarked the jet.
The other side of the Island, as Tony had said was all rocky cliff face with some sand on the top most rocks and view down into the crystal clear water below.
“I’d like to see the rest of the island actually.” Steve said, “I wouldn’t mind hiking around to take a look everywhere.”
He could of course just do as he always did, only this time have Steve baby sit while he got through it alone, but the truth was, Tony didn’t want to go through it alone, he wanted to share this with Steve, to enjoy his heat; not because he wanted to get pregnant, he didn’t, between Zach, Peter, and the Avengers he had more than enough going on without adding a baby to the mix, nor were he and Steve remotely ready for having a Pup of their own, maybe in a few years, but not yet.
The vegies were brought in, even the complained about brussels sprouts. Pounds of potatoes were carried in as well as the ingredients to make Christmas pudding, stuffing, brandy sauce, and a couple of packets of instant custard because no one could be arsed to make that from scratch.
Jarvis tilted his head to the side as much as the Vision armour would allow, “It is possible.” He said slowly, “It would have to be done with the greatest of care and you would probably need a support brace for your back, but I believe it is possible.”
Security was keeping the fuckwits away from the hospital, but they were in the car park, outside of the tower, chanting their bigoted bullshit and waving their signs.
“But you have coffee every day, and Daddy goes running every day, so why can’t I have pancakes every day?”
“Friday, I am the female sibling of Jarvis, made to replace Jarvis in the event of Sir’s death or incapacity, during which time Jarvis will have other duties to attend.”
He struck her with the power of the mind stone, knocking her away from Tony and freeing him from her hold.
“Hydra doesn’t do fair fights.” Steve said his expression dropping, “None of this is fair, not to you, to Bucky, none of it.” Tony stopped examining the wires and reached out, taking Steve’s hand and squeezed it.
“What’s this about pants?” Tony asked coming into the kitchen with Peter, “You got your homework and PE kit?” he asked Peter.
He'd had a heat after returning from Afghanistan, had spent it with Obie and taken his pills as always, only this time they had failed, as was a risk, only being 97 percent effective.
The memories were as haunting as a ghost, and while Steve knew, that in time they would bring him solace, that he would remember these things with a smile and take pleasure in them, right now his grief was still to raw, the loss to fresh in his mind for him to find anything by sorrow.
“Because they like each-other.” Peter said, “They like each-other a lot, but they haven’t figured out how to tell each-other yet.”
Sam, Tony, and Thor flew ahead of the others once they reached Sokovia, getting an arial view of the base from high enough that they were not noticed by Struckers troops.
Wanda screamed and flailed, she batted at Vision, trying to break free, but couldn’t escape his hold as her power was taken from her. As the Mind Stone reclaimed the magic Wanda fell to the ground in a boneless heap, her eyes glazed and expression blank, not only had the magic been taken from her, but her mind had gone with it leaving her as little more than a vegetable.
“Not yet, there is another lab I need to get into.” Peter said, “I need to break open the doors, can you cut the alarm?”
“Thanks Friday.” He said opening the door to the stair way and began to make his way down, shooting dead soldiers as he went. Save for one whom he slammed against a wall, “Wheres Tony?” He bellowed into the man’s face.
“Well, lets hope we never have to use these plans, but if we do, then Thank God for Tony’s OCD need to protect his loved ones.” Clint said.
While Jarvis had kept silent about the 800lbs he did alert Tony to this, which was how Tony came to find his teenage Son holding his porches over his head.
Steve went and joined the other avengers around the TV where Clint and Sam were arm wrestling to decide who got to pick the movie of choice while Natasha cat called them and Bruce flipped through a science journal, only Thor was not seated and appeared troubled.
Clint grinned, “Lets put that to the test.” He moved to strike the Skrull but Natasha held out her arm, preventing him from advancing further.
“Come in.” Steve softly called out, thankful that the bed covers and Tony’s body were managing to hide his burgeoning erection from view, although, Sam was military, he’d have shared quarters with plenty of Male Alphas and Betas, morning erections were such a common occurrence that no one mentioned them anymore than they did the freezing cold floors beneath bare feet.
“It’s okay, you were asleep,” Tony reassuringly said, he made to move and regretted it as his erection thumped into Steve, the larger Man blinking in surprise and suddenly becoming aware of his own erection rubbing against Tony’s thigh.
Vision didn’t move, “You would not kill her when you have gone to so much trouble to get her into your clutches. So I say again, hand her over.”
“Bitch shut up!” Harry yelled whirling back around to face her, sadly he had his hands up at the time and his fingers caught MJ’s cheek slapping her with enough force to make her yelp.
For all that Obie had been an evil bastard, he had not been abusive to Tony sexually, nor physically until the end, his abuse had been more subtle, verbal and emotional, using manipulation rather than his fists to get what he wanted.
It was on the tip of Tony’s tongue to say something insulting about their Steve, but he was beaten to it by this new Steve.
“Go and take care of a few chitauri.” Bucky grumbled, pulling the staff free, “And get your tongue cut out while you’re at it!”
This startled a laugh out of Tony and reached up to wipe stray tears from his cheeks, “I don’t want you to resent me.” He whispered,
It was Pepper who vetoed a suit, saying that it would look to businessy and that smart casual would read better with the general public. These days unless they were white collar workers people didn’t wear suits, business casual was considered acceptable for most work places, only very upper end jobs required a fully tailored business suit.
He bid a silent and sorrowful farewell to the old lady and her pastries as he fled into the night, leaping off a roof and landing on the back of a lorry to get out of the city. By luck the Lorry was making a delivery in Hungry, so Bucky hid himself in the hold, among the canned goods and waited out the long drive out of Romania.
