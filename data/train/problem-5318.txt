Tony is anxious for Steve to wake up. He wants to see Steve’s blue eyes again. Glittering brightly in the sun. Those blue eyes that when he first met them was full of pain and anguish, mourning for times lost. These days, those blue eyes can shine with happiness too, full of curiosity and wonder for what this new time has to offer. Tony knows Steve has a notebook where he writes down every single thing he feels he needs to catch up on. Tony himself has added suggestions to that growing list of things and enjoys when Steve calls him up and chats about new things he learns in this new century he was acclimatizing himself with.
“What are you thinking?” Steve asked, for once not really needing to know what was in Tony’s head but needing to hear his voice.
And Steve, well he made it his new life’s mission to ensure Tony’s health and safety. He hardly left Tony’s side, aside from unavoidable engagements. He stopped doing missions, choosing to delegate them to Bucky or Sam in his stead. Tony had no complaints, he was more than happy to be able to spend each of his waking moments with Steve even if all they could do was count down the minutes before Tony get to turn to his left side after ten minutes lying on his right side.
Anthony’s words rattled around in Steven’s brains. Steven stared blankly at the prince in his arms, fitting so snugly and perfectly there, with Anthony’s arms around his neck and Steven could see flecks of gold in Anthony’s eyes. If anyone was to have the son of God moniker, it should have been Anthony. Steven had never seen someone so brave and reckless, willing to face a monster yet armed only with a small knife; so generous and kind hearted that he willingly sacrifice himself for the sake of his people; and so beautiful, unlike anybody Steven had ever seen before.
“I love you,” Tony whispered to Steve. He moved closer to his family, wrapping his arms around Steve and the boys, he kissed Steve once more. Then for his boys’ benefits kissed each of them on the cheek, “And I love you, my boys.”
“Last night, I went home a little before 3,” Thor started his report by opening the back door of the bar. He had pulled Steve aside to talk to him about what happened last night at the bar. The two Alphas were sequestered away from the rest of the bar. Steve sat astride Tony’s Audi as Thor went through recounting the events of last night.
Joe turned an interesting shade of red at the reminder that he had been outed by Peter in his desperate attempt to shift attention away from his supersecret identity. “You know, we don’t have to talk about it. Peter’s secret identity as Spiderman clearly takes precedence here.”
“No I am definitely not James Buchanan Barnes of Pensacola, Florida! And definitely not an iguana smuggler!” Bucky insisted.
With one last glance at the arc reactor, Tony promised himself that he would perfect the arc reactor technology design. It would be part of his legacy, this unfinished technology of his father. If Obie thought the only thing he was good at was making things go boom, or making things go boom smarter, then Tony would show him that he was much more than a weapons guy. Stark Industries was his, dammit, and the way things were done around would change. Starting with the arc reactor. Tony would make Stark Industries bigger and better than it was under Howard’s leadership. It wouldn’t be the first time he would have to fix Howard’s mistakes and shortcomings after all.
“Tony and Clint were fighting again?” Steve questioned. His mate and Clint was always getting into feuds and bets about silly thing, “What is it about this time?”
Tony turned around from his position at the holo-deck, manipulating what looked to be a 3D projection of Clint’s bow. Steve’s face must have looked a sight, as Tony looked alarmed at his entrance.
Although that depended on whose perspective or opinion you ask. Ask any average Joe on the street and you’d find that there’s nothing ordinary about Peter Rogers. From the peculiar circumstances of his birth at the lobby of Avengers Tower to the family he was born into, Peter seemed to have hit every single one of the “extraordinary” jackpot.
Now that was an interesting point that Anthony raised. A coincidence? The things that have to happen for Anthony and Steven to meet included, but was not limited to, Alexander showing up at his house harassing his parents. It was mid morning, Steven would have been at sea. If Clint and Natasha weren’t there in his boat with him, he wouldn’t have known anything was happening back in the shore. Clint having a vision at just the right time, teleporting him back home just in time for Alexander to issue his challenge. Maria and Sam lending him her shield and his boots, the helmet of invisibility courtesy of Hades. And on the other side of the world, Anthony’s father just happened to make a flippant comment about his beauty and enraging the Nereids and Poseidon. Anthony’s father just happened to consult Clint’s oracles and Steven just happened to chose that particular coastline to land on to afford Groot some rest and came upon Anthony chained to the rock on his way back to Seriphos.
Anthony looked at him puzzled. What was he asking? Was he asking for a kiss from him? Well in that case, “Please.” Anthony answered, tilting his head up, eyes closing and lips puckering up to receive the kiss of a lifetime from Adonis when a wrecking sound reached his ears and the heaviness of the chain around his torso disappeared. When Anthony opened his eyes, it was to the sight of his metal chains in disarray, pieces of metal laid on the sand for Adonis had shred them to pieces with his bare hand. “Oh my Zeus, who are you?” Anthony gasped out.
“Look I’ve been here before. Okay? The place becomes a gang hangout. East Coast meets West Coast. Somebody gets popped.”
with. Pepper wouldn’t understand, she’s a civilian and anyway, she has more than enough on her plate. She was now CEO of Stark Industries and she and Happy had just started dating. Pepper’s life was finally not one giant circus-show courtesy of Tony and Tony wasn’t about to rain on her parade by talking to her about his stupid problems.
To pull off two weeks vacation, Tony had to work well into the night and sometimes into the morning, taking care of loose ends in the twenty five year model of the arc reactor project. Not to mention he had to debug some of the codes for the software used in the medical devices produced by Stark Med Tech. On top of that, Maria brought up some security concerns for the Avengers facility, so Tony had to upgrade the encryptions for the security system. All in all, the week before their vacation he was firmly ensconced in the workshop. He barely saw Steve or any of his children, other than when Steve or Ulysses would go down and retrieve him for dinner or to bring him some snacks or a cup of coffee. Joe sometimes came down too, asking him advices for a new cochlear implant he was working on. The boy was probably the single leading authority in auditory systems by this point, even more so than practicing ENTs. Tony was seriously so proud of Joe. He was so kind and generous and selfless. Ever since he found out of Clint’s hearing impediment, the boy seemed to have made it his life’s mission to ease his godfather’s woes by inventing better devices to help him hear.
“Where the hell have you guys been?” Bucky asked them when they got home later that night, Tony exhausted beyond belief that he had been allowing Steve to carry him from the car up to the Penthouse in a bridal carry much to Steve’s delight. Thor looked fresh as a daisy after their battle, not a trace of sadness on his face.
The younger soldier, sitting next to him timidly raised his hand, like a schoolkid wanting to ask his teacher a question. “You’re kidding me with the hand up, right?”
All of this lead to him being sleep deprived and tired. So on the day of their departure, he had a massive headache and spent the first leg of their journey sleeping in the jet. They had to transit at LAX to refuel the jet which was where everything went downhill. Because no matter how much money Tony seemed to have and how many times the Avengers might have saved the planet from alien invasions, they still have to go through airport security checks just like everyone else.
“Okay, babe. I’ll take care of it.” Steve flagged down their waiter and asked him to wrap up the meatball to go. Once the meatball was out of sight, Tony looked better and was finally able to eat.
The boys just started school again after a long summer break. Needless to say, everybody was busy and the subtle change of Tony’s scent went unnoticed. If Ulysses sometimes gave his Babbo a strange look when he passed by, that was easily explained by telling them Babbo changed his aftershave.
Tony held up his hand to halt Steve’s words. Apologies and consolations were the last things he wanted to hear from Steve, “I don’t need anymore apologies, Steve. But I do have some things I want to say to you.” Tony braced himself, taking a deep breath before starting again, “Thank you for telling me about my parents. It hurts, but it’s better to hurt now than let it fester until it becomes something unsalvageable. Until you lose all courage to tell the truth and it ends up breaking us apart.”
After Pepper and Rhodey left to go back to the mainland, Tony decided he needed to buckle down and get out of this funk he’s been wallowing in. He decided to come back to the his previous efforts in revamping the arc reactor technologies. He wasn’t ready to tell anyone his hypothesis, at least not until he has proof-of-concept for his newest idea. Because running simulation with JARVIS is one thing, but actually proving the concept works in the real world is another thing.
Steve closed his eyes, resigning himself to a temporary fate of paralysis, counting on Tony for every single thing he would need. It gnawed at him, being helpless again. The serum should have taken care of that, should have spared him the indignity of being an invalid again. Now, he was just a burden on Tony, on their family, when he was supposed to be the Alpha, the pack leader. The one to carry the burden, not being one.
Bucky seemed placated with Bruce’s explanation. Tony kept his gaze trained on the operating room below them. The surgeons have started rolling out a sheet of clear membrane, almost like plastic, and wrapped them around Steve’s rehydrated torso. The blood and sinew that were covering Steve had been flushed away, leaving his flesh exposed to the environment. Someone had shaved his head, his intact blond hair on the other side of his head gone to match the other side where all the hair was burned off in the explosion. Tony watched as they slowly covered Steve’s body with the skin grafts. Little by little, Steve’s exposed flesh was covered by the graft. Tony didn’t know he was holding his breath as he watched the surgeons finalized the graft placement. Only when they declared that the graft has been absorbed and incorporated by the serum as part of foundation to reconstruct Steve’s new skin did they breathed a collective sigh of relief.
“Yes. Congratulations, guys. He’s a bit on the small side, for now. But I’m confident we won’t have to deliver him early if Tony’s blood pressure stays under control like it is now.”
“We can call it whatever you want as long as you come back down here and give me some more of that to wake me up.”
“I don’t think I can live with this.” Steve sighed, despairingly taking another drink from the whiskey bottle. He really wished he could just drink himself to a stupor. Tony’s willingness to look the other way in the face of Bucky being a murderer was alarming to say the least. Steve was so tempted to look the other way too, because Bucky did save Tony’s life and that wasn’t something Steve could just brush off. Bucky saved Tony, which meant he indirectly saved Steve from living a life without Tony. And that wasn’t something he could survive. But his conscience was a stubborn thing and refused to be ignored.
“And how would you know that?” Joe asked him, eyebrow quirked up curiously as he realized what Jamie’s words implied.
“Don’t get so mad, sweetheart. He could be wrong.” Tony tried to placate his mate who was still fuming in silent.
Steven the mysterious demigod was also intelligent. His strategy to disorient the sea serpent to make him vulnerable was working. What the sea serpent lack in mobility and speed, Steven and his flying horse had in spades. They flew back and forth from one side to the next, as quick as a lightning strike, confusing and enraging Cetus who wasn’t used to having a moving target.
“Sorry,” he said sheepishly, “that’s one of my bad traits. My brain works faster than my mouth, so I compensate with talking too much. And not letting anyone getting a word in.”
So Steve went to California with Tony. Tony’s Malibu mansion was a wonder, and frankly, it suited Tony to the tee. It’s as if the architect took every aspect of Tony’s personality and created a building out of it. When Steve imagined how people would live in the future, Tony’s Malibu mansion was what he envisioned. The clean, simplistic style with ample lighting and understated luxury screamed future, technological advancement and progress. In short, it was a beautiful house, an extension of Tony and it was clear that Tony loved the house which only made Steve adored the house even more.
“Maybe,” Joe sighed, “but I just have this hunch that something else is going on here.” Joe tapped his phone to unlock it, swiping to the app he had made in the event something like this happened. He tapped a few things to activate it, the phone screen switched to display the interface for the tracking device that he had placed in Peter’s suit.
“‘Kay. Will you bring me back a souvenir?” Ulysses grinned, excited at the prospect of getting a present from his Papa.
“Awesome. Only 1 in 100 chance of creating a Supernova on earth. I like my odds.” Tony grinned, walking towards the helper bots.
Papa’s face turned from concerned to understanding,“Well, I hope you’ll feel better soon, buddy. It always saddens me whenever you or one of your brothers get sick.”
Sarah passed away the week before Steve graduated high school. They buried her in a cemetery overlooking the blue Hawai’ian ocean because they wanted her to have something beautiful to look at. Sarah was gone, and she took all the light and joy with her. Joe was ashamed to admit it, but he wasn’t the best father to Steve in the months leading up to Sarah’s death and after she was gone. He was absent minded on the best of days. He stopped going to church because he was angry at the God who dared took his wife away from him, and he went deep inside the bottle for days on end.
“And how much do we really know about how the human brain works, huh?” Rhodey interjected, “you can’t tell me that all the possible ways the brain works have been studied and discovered. The brain works in mysterious ways, Tony.” Tony was silent for a while. What Rhodey was saying did cross his mind one time, but Dr. Erskine completely shot that theory down before it could be tested and dashing all of Tony’s hopes in having Steve remember him, however fleeting it was.
“Stay down!” Jimmy pulled him down, out of sight and almost flat to the floor of the vehicle when the other soldier was shot down as soon as he stepped out.
“We shouldn’t be doing this in the first place. We’re in over our heads, we don’t know what we’re doing. Playing superheroes and thinking everything’s going to be peachy keen since we’re helping people. We should have known better. We’re raised by superheroes, for god’s sakes. If anybody knew the risks that come with this lifestyle, it was us. There was always a chance for injuries, for things going wrong no matter what precautions you take.”
Tony tried to run away, but he didn’t make it in time. The bomb exploded, catapulting a few yards back on to the sand, landing painfully on his back, taking the air right out of his lungs. His chest started to hurt and Tony knew, the shrapnels have been embedded within him. He was proven correct as pools of blood started to appear in various areas of his chest.
murder someone for me. And that you’d lie to me about it to spare me from the burden of knowing you killed someone.” after all these years and somehow Tony could still render Steve speechless with his insights to Steve’s psyche.
“Peter!” he belatedly realized that he just gave Spiderman’s secret identity away, but at the moment it was the last thing on his mind, “
Rhodey...would understand. He’s a soldier, he’s seen war. He would rightfully pinpoint what Tony’s experiencing as PTSD. His best friend had been trying to get Tony to talk to someone, a psychiatrist, a trained professional well equipped to deal with issues like these but the thought of baring his soul to some stranger was just overwhelming for Tony. It would make him too vulnerable, and he wasn’t about to become vulnerable in front of some stranger. There’s a reason why he built himself a suit of armor after Afghanistan and redemption was just one of them.
“I got it, sweetheart,” Steve knelt in front of him, gently rubbing his hands up and down Tony’s arms in an attempt to comfort him, “I’ll help you clean up. I’ve run a warm bath for you. Why don’t you hop in while I clean everything up, okay?”
“What?” Tony patted his hands down his pants, before realizing that he left his phone in the workshop in his haste to pick up Ulysses from school, “I left my phone down at the workshop. Sorry, guys. What is it? Why does everyone looked like they just found out that they have zero chance of being Nat’s mate?” Tony laughed at his own joke. It’s funny ‘cause it’s true.
Joe’s spine stiffened at Jamie’s words. What did he just imply? Could it be that he figured out Peter’s big secret?
“Oh you know how it is: drunk father committed hubris, and boasted about how his son was more beautiful than the Nereids which of course angered the Nereids, who then told their father, in this case Poseidon, who then sent Big and Ugly over there to ravage my country’s coastline and terrorize my citizens unless my parents sacrifice me to the sea for the sins my father committed.” Anthony said flippantly, his tone light but underscoring the gravity of his situation.
Tony shot him a look, “I’m gonna ignore that, sourpuss. My kid just talked at nine months. He’s leaps and bounds over other babies!”
Tony shook his head, burying it in Steve’s chest, unwilling to speak more about the nightmare that has been haunting him, “Shh, shh,” Steve soothed, “It’s okay. You don’t have to tell me now, but when you’re ready, I’m here for you. Alright?” He felt Tony nodded in assent, still hiding his face in Steve’s chest. Steve carded his strong fingers through his messy mop, offering comfort and companionship to Tony.
“Falcon,” It was Jarvis’ turn to be interrogated, “Yeah, he’s uh, he’s alright, I guess. His right hand has some talent, and his left hand is full of street cred. Due to the fact that his brother is a big time gangsta.” the man chuckled nervously.
It was planned to be a subtle and clandestine mission, hence the use of the stealth suit. And they didn’t expect it to be a long mission. Steve loathed to be away from Tony’s side on any normal day, but when Tony was pregnant with their third child, it felt wrong to be away from him for any reason at all. It was taking all of his will and conviction not to just leave the mission in Maria’s capable hand. Steve knew how important taking care of AIM and their twisted philosophy in scientific research and making sure they never experimented on anyone ever again was to Tony. And he was doing on behalf of his mate. If they had to separate for a little while, that was a price both of them were willing to pay no matter how much it grated on their instincts to stay close together.
“I can’t believe it.” Steve exclaimed, walking to the stairs, “Bruce Willis was a ghost. This whole time, he was the ghost. I didn’t see it coming. Did you…?”
, I was there when it happened.” Tony chuckled nervously, “what I meant was I didn’t know how it’s possible for us to get pregnant again with me, like this, you know?”
He didn’t notice it at first, just chalked it up to one of those things that happened with pregnant people. Tony walked into the lounge at lunch time, starving after a full morning of meetings with SI’s board members. Steve, Natasha and Sam were gathered around the island in the kitchen eating lunch. Steve looked up from his lunch as he sensed Tony entering the kitchen and smiled brightly at his mate.
“You’re sighing again,” a voice from his left pulled his attention away from Joe and Peter. Jamie’s best friend and fellow football player Aaron Stevenson was next to him, arms crossed in front of his chest and leaning against the closed lockers next to Jamie’s opened one, “I recognize that as your ‘Joe Rogers’ sigh. Why can’t you just go up to him and tell him you like him, man? What’s the worst that could happen?”
Natasha sighed in relief, “Right. That’s good. We need to radio in. Steve won’t last long even with the serum.”
“Peter, why do you have the Spiderman suit on? Please tell me that’s going to be your halloween costume and not what I think it is.” Babbo said faintly.
“Huh.” Thor tilted his head to the side, not unlike a confused puppy, “Tony, did you just wet yourself?”
Just as he was debating on whether or not he should call Steve and inform him about Tony’s situation, the elevator opened and from it, Steve and Sam emerged. Sam immediately made a beeline to the fridge for a drink of water, while Steve, looking for all the world as if hasn’t  ran 10 miles, spotted his husband and Clint at the living room and walked over to join them.
.” Tony obligingly unclasped Joe from the stroller and lift him up so he could be closer to eye level with the Captain America statue.
“I keep getting nauseated whenever I look at the counter.” Tony explained, “something’s not right up here.”
A sound of a camera clicking and snapping a picture drew their attention from Ulysses and to Clint who was grinning madly from his position on the floor, the polaroid camera that he got from Natasha for Christmas in his hand. The camera spat out the paper and Clint snapped it and started to waved it to develop the film. After he was satisfied with the result, he gave the polaroid picture to Tony, winking, “You’re welcome.”
A guest seemed to be joining them this morning. Tony came in to the room, carrying baby Ulysses in his arms, followed by a tall and lean African American man Bucky had never seen before, but he could guess it was probably James Rhodes, Stark’s best friend and the other namesake for Ulysses.
Steve walked down the steps leading to Tony’s workshop intending to fetch his mate for the night. Tony had been working since they’ve finished dinner. It was now almost midnight and Steve thought it was time to take a break because lately Tony seemed to be putting more hours in the workshop and in the offices down stairs. Whatever cutting edge, earth shattering, groundbreaking invention he was working could wait until tomorrow.
The Avengers fought seamlessly with each other. At the beginning, they were still fighting separately, as they were wont to do. But after Bruce’s arrival (on a scooter of all things), Steve started calling the shots. Now, he, Natasha and Bruce as the Hulk were working on containing the damage on the ground while Tony, Thor and Clint were up high, trying to bottleneck the portal that was funneling the Chitauri to Earth.
“Tony,” Steve sighed longsufferingly, a small smile gracing his lips, “Bonding with you is the greatest pleasure in my life.”
“Oh, uh,” Thor stammered, eyes widening imperceptibly, “I thought you’d be having lunch with Steve today. Like you always do,” he said charmingly.
Steve sighed, “You’re not satisfied until you give me a heart attack, are you?” his tone was disapproving, but the light kiss he pressed to Tony’s pouting lips said otherwise.
“Which proves he was here. Why didn’t you tell the police you saw Rumlow?” Steve addressed Clint who was standing by the door behind them.
“See, I told you, you just had to take a leap. He totally likes you too, there was a zero to none chance of you being rejected by Jamie. Am I good on the matters of the heart, or am I good?”
Tony gently placed his hand on his flat stomach, aware that the new baby was still a clump of rapidly dividing cells somewhere in his fallopian tube, yet he swore he could feel something changing within him. Something he felt when he was pregnant with the boys all those years ago.
They were both silent for awhile trying to process the information Dr. Rosenberg was piling on them.
“What does that mean, doctor?” Steve asked him. Tony was speechless. Out of all the things that could occur to him, this was the last thing he ever expected to happen.
“Well,” Tony cleared his throat, “have a good breakfast, Steve.” he let go of Steve’s hand -Steve’s warm and huge hand- and retreated back to his booth.
The news of Tony’s pregnancy spread like wildfire through the rest of the people living in the Tower. All it took was Natasha noticing that Tony had been forgoing his nightly two fingers of scotch during one of the movie nights.
He has been a burden to his dad and Bucky for long enough. It wasn’t fair on them. He wouldn’t impose on them any longer. With Steve gone, Bucky would be free to focus on his recuperation, he’d be free to go to the VA for his counseling sessions, and Dad would have more time to dedicate to fixing up the old beat up Mercury he had been meaning to do once he retired. Hell, his dad can retire now, and he won’t have to spend his days holding Steve’s hand, catering to him. His Dad would even be free to start dating again, if he wanted. God knew he needed some company now that Steve would be leaving. He decided he would bring it up tonight, during dinner time. He knew his dad and brother wouldn’t exactly be thrilled by it, but they would respect his decision. Steve needed to stand up on his own two feet and start being a functioning member of society again. He needed to be useful and do what’s right for his family and himself. He needed to start to live again.
But Bucky being here now presented a new opportunity, a new chance to start over for them, and for the family he dreamt of in the aftermath of SHIELD’s downfall. Bracing himself for what came next, Steve nodded. “I’ll be back.” he told Tony, caressing the omega’s cheek and Ulysses’ back to soothe him.
“It wouldn’t be too far fetched to think I was having an affair with him. I mean, he’s very handsome.” Tony said teasingly.
Tony stiffened, his cover completely blown. Ugh why the hell did hell did he think he could pull this off. It must be his Van Dyke giving him away, or maybe the incessant way he kept talking about his daddy issues. Stupid Tony!
Evening dawned, and with it Steve’s plans for a romantic dinner for two with Tony. He had confirmed everything with their guest ambassador, Kiani, that everything Steve ordered was all set for tonight. Once the sun set, Steve was ready for the night to start, room service should be arriving with their food soon. Tony, Peter and Joe were playing the Wii in the living room and Ulysses was down in the lobby. He had spotted a grand piano there and when he asked the staff if guests were allowed to play it and they said yes, he immediately leapt on the chance to play. Steve watched him play for a couple minutes, he was still amazed at how skilled his son was with the piano. Gentle lilting melody or fast paced jazz tunes, any type of compositions Ulysses would play Steve enjoyed them all.
As Tony climbed up the stairs to his room, a stray thought entered his head. That dream he saw when he fell asleep in the workshop, was that dream about his Dad? It was so odd to see his father as a young man. That mustache was atrocious, and the flying car design even more so. Dad should have listened to me, was the last thing Tony thought about before he drifted off to sleep once more.
Anthony returned the smile with his own, “Then do you mind getting us somewhere else more suitable than a beach with a rotting carcass to spend more time together?”
They all ended up sleeping in the master bedroom, curled up around each other just the way they used to when the boys were still young and prone to nightmares. It was the best sleep Steve had had in years.
Ten months after Ulysses’ birth, Tony’s body was starting to go back to the way it was before the pregnancy. Mostly anyway. His stomach was starting to go back to the flat stomach he had before the pregnancy although all of the muscle definition in his core that he had before from piloting the suit was abysmally decimated by the amount of fat that replaced said muscles. His hips became more prominent now with the pelvic muscles stretched out after the birth and more importantly his previously amazing ass that had websites dedicated to it became even rounder and more plump. Clint called it a “duckbutt ass” and said that there would be even more websites dedicated to his as now. All in all, he was curvier than he was before Ulysses and he wasn’t unsure if he liked it or not.
Steve lived and thrived under their care despite his health troubles. He was small compared to his peers, and his ailments made him unable to be as carefree as a toddler should be. He stayed at home more than he ventured outside, and as a result he was exceptionally close to his parents. When his contract was almost up, Joe decided to asked for an extension so he could remain in the Marines. Steve may not be at death’s door, like he was a few years ago, but the Marine took care of their own and Steve’s medicines was one of the things they would take care.
Steve laughed at Tony’s whining, “I’m sorry, sweetheart. Diaper duty’s on me for the foreseeable future.”
Once Dr. Rosenberg confirmed what all six home pregnancy tests told them, and told them that the pregnancy was five weeks along, they had a little celebration by having home cooked meal courtesy of Steve and Bruce. They skyped with Rhodey who was on tour overseas to tell him the good news and Pepper dropped by for dinner with them. Wine and Asgardian mead was free-flowing, and by the end of the night everyone was either face planting on the couch or in their meals. Everybody, except Steve and Tony, who still had to put the actual baby in the family to bed and was banned from imbibing on said beverages.
“I’m sure you will,” Steve murmured, kissing Tony again, enjoying the closeness of his mate, the scent of their bond in his nose and the feel of Tony’s body against his. Steve deepened the kiss, wrapping his free hand around Tony’s waist, pulling Tony closer. He felt Tony’s lips opened under his, so pliant and receptive to his touches. His mate, his life, the reason for Steve’s existence.
Jamie just hoped that it wouldn’t end in heartbreak. He had a feeling Joe Rogers would be a tough act for anyone to follow.
“And I’m sorry for the harsh talk this morning, but I’ve come to know you, Tony. And I know that you’re lonely. Sure, you have Clint, the kids, Happy, Pepper, Rhodey and me. But when we go home, who’s there for you?”
Tony looked up from the drawing he was studying to leer at Steve. “Why?” The suggestive tone in his voice seeping, “do you just want to kiss up, rub up and feel up on me all night?”
Tony looked up at Steve slightly before turning away somewhat. He gathered himself before pointing aimlessly at a console in the middle of their space.
The voice on the other side of the receiver rose in earnest which twisted Obadiah’s face into irritation. He nodded his head emphatically as he prevented himself from sighing with frustration.
“Steve!” Steve smiled as soon as he heard Peter shout his name down the street. He could see Peter getting out of a car with Tony closely behind.
Along with her own advice, Tony immediately recognized the words Rhodey had offered him a while back.
Later in the evening after work, Steve and Bucky had walked together to the local drug store. As soon as they entered, Steve quickly headed toward the back of the store.
Steve yanked away from Tony, feeling himself losing his temper as he tried to get out of the shower. He felt Tony grab his arm, but Steve yanked away from him again, angry with himself and Tony.
However, the crowd cheered even louder as soon as he finished his first set of lines. Steve was amazed that no one seemed to care that he looked and sounded incredibly nervous.
The door creaked open slowly, first showing a tiny hand before the rest of Peter emerged from the hallway.
“…would you like to get lunch tomorrow? Like with me, I mean. I’ll treat ya…” Tony was crossing his arms again; his expression was sheepish which caught Steve off guard.
kidding me?” His heart started beating with the hugest wave of embarrassment. It was already bad enough that he humiliated himself on the regular, but now his friends were, too?
Loki grinned as he tried to face Steve. “And then get the shit kicked out of me by my dear brother? Not a chance!”
Peter let out a whiny noise before continuing, and Steve had to prevent himself from grinning so hard.
Steve waited before limping to the island. He rested a hand on Tony’s shoulder before rubbing it gently.
Tony nodded for Bruce to continue and Bruce nodded back emphatically. “…turns out that if we construct a mini reactor, we could use it to help the queue in the device.” He tapped a few times on a tablet he was holding to show Tony what was he was referring to.
Tony waved the computer off as he watched the intruder slowly turn around, immediately recognizing the mechanical engineering undergrad he had met at Steve’s graduation from a while back.
Steve winced; he hadn’t expected Tony and Peter to involve him in their project. He also wasn’t sure how he would be able to contribute.
The arena transformed into a two-story suburban house. Natasha and Clint appeared near the front door, while Steve could see Thor and Bruce standing in the kitchen. He looked around him to see that he and Tony were standing in the living room.
Ever since he received the letter, Tony had convinced himself that Steve should have called him to apologize.
Tony winced as he fumbled, trying to fish his phone out of his pocket to see that Rhodey was calling him. He glanced shyly over at Steve before sprinting out of the lab to answer the call.
Steve laughed quietly. “I meant that mostly for myself…” He turned the device around and around in his hand before feeling his face as if it had already transformed.
Steve leaned closer as he left Tony wrap a hand around his waist. Steve thought back to the strange encounter the day they found out about Clint’s assault when he witnessed Dr. Selvig marching out of Loki’s lab. Steve felt compelled to mention something to Tony, but figured he should wait until Natasha found something with the tapes.
As with his comment about how great Steve’s massages felt, Tony felt comfortable enough in their relationship to make such an off-color joke.
Steve let out a gasp as the finger entered further, eventually hitting a spot he had never felt before and it sent a rush throughout his body.
Bucky slowly acknowledged Steve. “I agree with Sam…you should be able to do what you want, Cap…if you want to bring Tony, you should be able to do that.”
The team was standing in a suite Tony had created to test out simulations. Fury was above them on a landing, while they positioned themselves in arena-like area below, with Fury leaning against the railing to look downward at the team. Steve was standing near Tony, while everyone else, in their pairs, was huddled at the other end of the arena.
Tony smiled as he waited a moment, thankful that he had found someone like Steve. “Yeah, I suppose you’re right.” He teased as he rejoined Steve in the bed with the sheet of paper.
“…I should have had you in there with me during that meeting…just to collaborate whether I sound paranoid…” Tony finally volunteered slowly.
Steve sighed as he slowly walked into Stark Enterprises, making his way to the main space to find Bruce working alone. Steve walked ahead to the space he shared with Tony, but it was empty. Steve glanced at his wristwatch before he looked around, turning to walk back to the main space.
Tony’s eyes widened even more as he felt like his brain and heart were about to explode. “Uh, well…are you sure…?”
Tony quickly shook his head. “No can do; breakfast is the only thing I’m good at. Why don’t you pop a squat in the dining room? I’m almost finished.”
“…but I’ll touch you after you get use to me…” Tony whispered into Steve’s ear. Steve moaned just from the feeling of Tony rubbing his hips and the tone in his voice.
“That fucking tech conference.” Tony said out loud and really to no one as he proceeded back to the command center.
Tony kept his head in his hands as he heard the door to the room shut quietly. He wiped his face before looking up at Steve, taking a hold of his hand before rubbing it, thinking back to the last time they had spoken to each other.
Tony let go off Steve before turning around to lead them into the main area. They found a spot near the bar counter to settle, patiently waiting for the buyers to summon Tony. After a half an hour, Tony could feel himself becoming fidgety and impatient while Steve seemed relatively calm.
Tony thought to himself as he followed Steve inside. Surprisingly, something about the thought didn’t freak Tony out this time; having Steve over the last week or so had been easy and wonderful. It felt like the three of them were really a family.
Tony nodded, clenching his chest, counting to himself to calm down until the pain seemingly subsided. Steve held onto him, which appeared to ease his body somewhat. After a moment, Tony finally calmed down enough to sleep with Steve still holding him.
They continued grinding up against each other, their cocks twitching from the movement between them. Steve placed both hands on either side of Tony, sliding his cock against Tony’s before placing one hand on Tony’s chest. Steve leaned downward to suck Tony’s nipples before resting on top of him again to grind against his body more directly.
“I’m trying to be that older, wiser friend…” Tony let go of Steve to wave his free hand around as he laughed nervously, “well, maybe not so much the wiser part…actually could we forget I said anything about the older part as well?”
Steve stood still, looking around the kitchen before looking back at Tony. “Uh, Tony…I can make breakfast…why don’t you relax?” He was confused by Tony’s current state which was the exact opposite of earlier that morning.
Steve nodded. “Love you too, Buck.” He then watched Bucky take a moment before walking back into his suite.
Somewhat stunned at first, Tony immediately regrouped; after all, they were pretending to be married.
Peter began detailing another one of his adventures with Ned until Tony found a moment to talk about the upcoming promotional tour.
They said goodbye to everyone before walking back to their suite. And although Steve finally had the alone time he had desperately needed to talk to Tony, he found himself unable to bring up anything serious as he and Tony talked about their day on T’Challa’s yacht.
Tony sighed. “Pepper told me once that I was attentive and caring when she and I first started dating. I feel—felt closer to you…and I even told you about my relationship with my dad…” he sniffled, “but then I accused you of sleeping around with your best friend…I yelled at you over my dad’s diary…I’m not secure enough to have a honest conservation with you…of course, we were never going to work…”
Tony watched Steve take his time before answering.  “Aren’t you the one who came up with the pretending to be married plan? I only acted how I would if I were…”
“He has a son—well, he’s adopted, but it’s the same nevertheless.” Steve coolly explained to Sam as his friend only nodded back as he took a sip of beer.
Steve sighed before leaning back into his chair. He shrugged. “I guess, but I don’t feel like I got any attention until I was in college. And still, it feels strange to me. I used to be a lot scrawnier when I was kid…”
“Tony, I don’t want to make assumptions about your relationship with Steve, but you have no idea that’ll happen.” Tony could sense the sincerity in his friend’s voice, but it didn’t help.
Steve smiled slightly before breaking out into a restrained laugh. Tony stared at him until he started laughing along. Steve stopped laughing to smile as he looked back at the inside of the mansion.
As soon as they were left alone in the room, both Tony and Pepper met at the breakfast table. Tony lingered near Pepper who was still smiling at him. She then reached over to pull him into a hug.
The board member complimented both Steve and Bucky again before announcing that she needed to mingle with some potential investors. Steve turned to face Bucky with a goofy grin just as the board member walked away.
Tony nodded, pausing before continuing. “…it’s been in my family for so long, but I never really thought about it before seeing you wear it…” Tony inhaled then exhaled deeply, opening the box to reveal his mother’s ring that had belonged to his grandfather.
“Nothing.” Bucky shrugged again, his expression turning cheerful suddenly. He swiftly grabbed an appetizer from a server passing trays before making a move to walk away.
“Steve, stop. I’m sorry, but please stop.” Tony shook his head as he turned around to walk to the front door.
“Tony? You…can’t be serious…” Tony felt Steve yank his hand away from his grip. He finally opened his eyes to see Steve sitting up straight in his chair with his hands on his thighs. He locked eyes with Steve and couldn’t look away; Steve’s gaze was intense and captivating, although it hurt to experience it.
“He was older than you,” Steve says for no reason he himself can identify other than being a complete masochist who can never leave anything alone.
Tony goes back to what he was doing, “Well it’s not like I can wipe it off and show you,” he grunts.
He wasn’t an idiot. He knew that once a month he spent a week being irritable and snappy and avoiding mirrors because his body still thought he should be doing that very specific
. That alone is heart breaking, knowing he’s had to miss out on an entire beautiful life, that everything he’s ever loved is well and truly buried without him.
It would have been hilarious if it hadn’t also been so frustrating. He had almost wanted to tell the team, but he was afraid—it wasn’t like those with his prior designation were the most respected people in the world, even now. Society was filled with stigma and stereotypes that could call Steve’s command into question.
But they weren’t red, so Tony invited Steve into the workshop. Ushered him to the couch in the corner where Tony often slept. Where his scent was the strongest in the Tower.
“Steve… Steve… shh, it’s okay. I’m alright, I’m here,” Tony whispers, weak trembling fingers card through Steve’s overgrown hair.
“I keep thinking about what that must have been like,” Steve tells him, “I shouldn’t, I don’t want to, but I can’t help it. You must have felt so… alone,” he says.
Steve kept waiting for Tony to say it. To drop a hint to the rest of the team. For Natasha to finally see it.
Not just any tattoos of course. Steve was aware that the act of tattooing the skin was an important part of many cultures, and he had no qualms with any form of art, really.
Bucky shook his head, bringing his hand forward, “Don’t got one, sir,” he rushed, then cringed at his own use of formality, “I—” he started, “I uh, nothin’, I wasn’t doin’ anythin’” he mumbled.
Steve’s expression is pinched, to say the least, but his mouth quirks up just a little, “Language,” he says on a slow exhale.
Steve had always been reckless. Tony found himself sending his condolences to all those who had ever had to deal with Steve Rogers when he was small and asthmatic a lot over the weeks following his return from DC.
Steve sighs, “Clint says you’re just bitter because you don’t have one,” Steve says without guilt, “He was actually less sensitive than that,” he adds, and Tony snorts a laugh.
Thanks for reading!!! Still hoping I'm managing to portray the trials and tribulations of asexuality okay, considering the spectrum of it all. Sorry about the angst! We can't let Bucky have everything figured out though!! but he still has his shit more together than he does in canon for sure.
The worst thing was that Steve knew it was nothing but the alpha hormones. He knew this defensive-offensive game wasn’t really who Steve was, he knew it was all the Alpha in him and he really started to hate it.
He didn’t wait to see Steve’s face. Didn’t really want Steve to see his, so he slid out of the bed and went to the dresser to find pajama pants. He’d go down to the workshop, maybe get some stuff for SI done after working on AASS—give Pepper something to use against the board. With a glance over at Bucky, Tony grabbed a second pair and tossed them on the bed. It wouldn’t be the first time Bucky borrowed Tony’s clothes. The soldier was surprisingly slight compared to Steve, now without the steroid cocktail Hydra had been giving to boost their bastard serum in his system, he was closer to Tony’s weight category, if a little (lot) taller.
Clint’s eyebrows rose, “Tony and Steve… let you sleep in their room? Where did they… wait,” he said with realization.
, Tony,” and he grips Tony’s other hand tight to his chest. Can’t bring his face up to look at him now, though he’s spent the last six months wishing only to see Tony’s eyes again.
It was reasonable that Bucky was clinging to similar things with Steve… the familiarity, structure, and authority, and in a way, it made sense that Bucky was clinging to some things with Tony, too –Tony had confidence and competence in abundance enough to combat Bucky’s confusion.
After the initial anger had worn off, and Bucky was feeling better (and developed a liking for popsicles, if and only if, they were presented by Tony,) Steve started to blame himself, for the team’s reaction.
That perfectly balanced, perfectly curved piece of metal. Symbolic of freedom. Symbolic of a country, and values, and a time that doesn’t exist to anyone except the star spangled man who wields it.
When Steve shares his new, slightly more pessimistic view on soulmates, Natasha looks immediately to Tony as if he alone is responsible.
Steve gave in to helplessness that night though. Gave in and let Tony turn that awful feeling into pleasure.
Steve is nearly draped over Barnes. Nat and Sam have made a home on the floor leaning on the couch on either side of the other beta’s legs. Steve’s are tucked under himself. The rest of the team are there, Tony’s sure. He doesn’t notice them though.
Tony can’t help but want to laugh, but instead he throws Steve over the arm of the couch and licks into his dripping cunt while he gets himself off a second time listening to Steve’s high pitched moans of ‘Alpha’ and the taste of that burning sweet peppermint on his tongue.
Having Steve in the lab like this feels surreal somehow. He can’t help but glance over at the couch in the corner. The place he had Steve laid out and moaning under him, wishing the whole time for Steve to look and smell just the way he does right now.
It’s paused, a freeze frame of the lucky shot. They’ve edited it, blown it up and traced the outline to make it all the more clear to the viewers.
Steve inclines his head, looks up at Tony’s face and finds him biting his lip. Steve doesn’t think about kissing him for very long, he’s too melancholy.
He still wanted to kill Sam the day he tried to tell Bucky he needed to eat solid food and had given him a grilled cheese sandwich, though.
He was about to break the door down, when Steve’s voice cracked on another low moan and, “please, Tony, let me come in you, please, please, I can’t—” came the broken off sob.
Tony knew that an alpha would have bristled at the statement, but he can’t say he was surprised when Steve’s shoulders slumped for a second, as if in relief, before his hackles rose again to tell Tony to fuck off.
Steve supposes Tony has him there. Has knowing their alive really proved anything besides the fact that the fates are cruel?
Blurs like the tears he pretends are not there falling down the drain, invisible in the stream of water and
Steve goes boneless when Tony presses him down into the fabric of the den. He groans out something that sounds a lot like Alpha.
When Steve, still sitting on the edge of their bed, pulled Bucky closer, the man came willingly. Standing in the v of Steve’s spread legs, it was as if his strings had been cut, his legs folding under his own weight, Bucky collapsed.
He keeps Steve’s t-shirt balled up under his pillow in the lab and refuses to think about how he sometimes finds himself looking forward to falling asleep knowing that it’s there.
“My soulmate, Steve,” Tony starts, “he was an incredible man that everyone loved and who I could never measure up to,” he admits in a rough voice, “and so all this time I blamed myself for his death because if he hadn’t been a part of me, then maybe he would have had a longer life, a happier life,” he says, “I know that’s conceded as hell, but I… I don’t know, I thought I was his curse, you know?” Tony admits and its justification that Steve doesn’t need.
“Honestly, he’s doing pretty well considering what you told me,” Sam had said, “he might just need to work on getting his bearings a bit more before we try subjecting him to the team,” Sam advised, “He’s doing really well with Tony, probably because it was just the two of you with him for the first few days, best not to swamp him anymore,” Sam had said.
He just files that next to died young in the military, and a hell of a lot older than Tony in his mental box of information about Tony’s soulmate. The box he only really has to glance at to get his heart pounding in his chest these last few days. Maybe longer than that.
Tony gave a tight smile that looked incredibly forced, but his tone was calm, if a little sad, “Yeah, he is,” Tony admits and turns slightly away from the prying eyes of the jet.
That Steve is exactly the same in this body as he is in the one that will never let them be together.
Tony’s hand looks rough and large on Steve’s skinny ankle. Pale, with fuzzy blonde hairs that tickle as he rubs his thumb back and forth above the hem of too long sleep pants.
His throat felt raw and there was blood, a lot of blood, by the time his stomach stopped convulsing.
“Soulmates are meaningless, Steve. Loveless,” Tony sighed, rolling his neck and stretching out languid and relaxed. At least that’s what he wanted to portray.
That horrible, muted, sour version of Steve’s scent stays with him though. Twists him up inside and makes him sick.
Steve didn’t move again, just continued to whisper assurance until Bucky’s face relaxed and he was no longer braced for pain.
“I think it’s why I just… I didn’t like you at first,” he said instead, “but I liked you fine even after that, even before I saw it,” Steve admits, “but when I did see it the first time…” Steve trailed off.
“Steve,” Dr. Cho had called his name a few times over the last few days. Telling Steve he needed to leave the hospital wing, sleep, eat, shower. Move.
Sam frowned, gave his shoulder a comforting squeeze, “I know,” he said, “you’re doing fine,” he assured, “Just keep working on getting him talking, then we can get him into therapy and they’ll help you,” Sam told him.
It isn’t new. He’s woken up alone to cold sheets and Steve no where to be found before. It is far from the first time. It is far from the last.
That was the opposite of why Tony had avoided her and Sam as much as he could reasonably get away with.
They sit in the quiet for a while before Steve speaks up again, “How come you never looked it up?” he asks, since Natasha hadn’t seen it as a line.
And he’s pretty sure he wails, the heart broken sound crawling desperately from the deepest pits of his soul.
Tony is laying out across a reclining lawn chair, soaking up the remaining rays of sunlight in his grease-stained jeans and long-sleeved shirt. Steve himself was leaning against the railing, looking out over the skyline as the sun set. It was the height of summer, the nights refusing to dim until nearly nine now. It was Steve’s favourite light to sketch in, yet he hadn’t been able to make himself draw the city when he came out to find Tony relaxing in his chair.
With Sam… it was different. He knew, for the most part, that Sam was good. He was safe. He was a friend. All the Avengers were friends and no one had hurt him since he arrived, but Sam had come the closest with the ‘incident’. He knew, objectively that Sam hadn’t meant to hurt him, had been trying to help by giving him food… It was just hard to get that fact to the forefront of his thoughts when he saw the man.
And Steve still forgets about Captain America, even as it’s that red, white, and blue spangled shield that comes down over and over on Aldrich
, but it was still less rest than he had been getting. Tony couldn’t figure out what was going on, but Bucky hadn’t even attempted sleep in days.
He’d worried about tipping the team off about the differences between Steve and Tony though, so he’d locked himself away in the workshop the best he could.
Should I trigger warning the second-hand embarrassment that you will inevitably get from this? Consider that it.
He almost kills them both, but Bucky can hold his breath even longer than Steve, apparently. Or maybe he just remembered to drag air into his lungs before diving into the river.
But of course, Tony likes the guy. He’s perfect, but what did he expect? Barnes belongs to Steve, of course he’s perfect. Sassy and deadly just like Sam and Nat and Steve himself.
But then there was Steve. And then there was the team and then there was Bucky and Sam and Nat but before that… before that it was just Steve.
Tony turned to Bucky, who shrugged and crawled over Tony to slot himself down in the six inches of space between Steve and Tony.
Steve’s heart dropped. He stilled completely, “Bucky,” Steve whispered, “it’s okay, it’s just me, just Steve” he assured, “I’m not going to hurt you, princess” he tried.
“That’s not enough! That isn’t proof and you know it! Unless you have his soulmate hiding around that corner, you’re lying to him,” Tony spits venom.
At first it had been great. He had felt rested and energized in a way he hadn’t for as long as he could remember. Two months later, it wasn’t really sufficient anymore.
It’s not a deep claiming bite a mate would leave. Lacks the width and raised characteristics of an Alpha’s mating bite.
Tony shrugs one shoulder and drops his sunglasses back over his eyes, “Weirder things have happened,” he says.
Familiar like the shield, familiar like the strength that Tony has always carried. That he builds and nurtures in those around him.
The bright, lively, active, brilliant genius that kept Steve in line, who Steve loved and worshiped with every fiber of his being.
Steve was surprised, how much of his old friend was still in there. He’d expected Bucky to be nothing like his old self. There were a lot of differences, sure, but the sass, the princess attitude, oh man, was it ever Bucky from before the war.
It takes exactly one Avengers mission where Steve stays home and barks orders that Tony doesn’t follow through the comms before he demands to be let out on the field again, small and everything.
“I don’t know that that’s true,” Tony says, “Karma, wasn’t it?” he says, but he doesn’t look at Steve when he says it even though it’s stealing away Steve’s plausible deniability, and Tony should be able to meet his eye when he does things like that.
Steve reaches out, tucking locks of hair away from his face. Tony brings Steve’s hand to his mouth and kisses his knuckles.
Natasha finds him later when he thinks he must be out of tears. She enters heedless of what the nurses must have told her about Steve’s behaviour towards them and their attempts at small talk. Up until that point Steve maintained a certain amount of composure, of levelheadedness. Of his usual stable stubbornness. He’s not sure he’s going to get it back
It isn’t new. He’s woken up alone to cold sheets and Steve no where to be found before. It is far from the first time. It is far from the last.
Hey, so I know I promised to focus on Bad At What We Do, but I haven't been able to write much lately, and this one is practically done, so it's just a little something to keep the content coming I guess.
“And he just showed it to you?” Steve asked. Maybe Tony had peeked where he shouldn’t have or something.
Look at bucky go! Figuring himself out and stuff. We're starting to tackle Bucky's asexuality too, so I think it's important that I give the reminder that Bucky not being interested in sex is NOT trauma related, but that to other characters it might seem that way as it's often people's knee jerk reaction to asexuality. The way other people perceive asexuality is also going to come up the next time we visit Bucky's POV and it gets pretty messy for him, but it all works out!
The memories of having Steve in both his bed and his den seem to fuse and overlap in his mind. Steve in both bodies, both places. It all gets shuffled together.
“Buck?” Steve said, sounding still half asleep but far more alert than he usually was upon waking up in his own bed.
It’s not something they did before. Tony’s pretty sure that Steve couldn’t assume that angry red hue to his eyes before, and Tony never dared in case that was true.
“Suck on that for a little while,” he winked, “don’t let him eat more than half, the sugar will make him sick again,” Tony added to Natalia and walked away.
His scent is what really hits Tony like a wall, but that is coupled with the weight of Steve’s status.
Tony has a fleeting thought when Steve gags and coughs and chokes himself over and over, that Steve has never done this before.
Not the lab. He couldn’t handle the image of the couch where he had Steve laid out underneath him, not when he now had the image of Steve as he was just then in the quinjet burned into his brain.
Everything had felt like a dream up until the moment Tony’s eyes land on that spot on Steve’s shoulder and suddenly reality warps and changes and bends to accommodate this new world he finds himself in with Tony.
Something about how Tony always seemed to get Steve when it had come to his soulmate, and the rejection of this possibility felt important some how.
Even more predictably, Steve’s eyes flew open, “Wha?” he said, sitting up quickly and looking around.
The song doesn’t proceed into the second verse before Tony turns away, “Actually Jay, mute,” he says, “Forgot, song’s actually about blasphemy, who’d have figured?” he laughs.
Steve gave him a gentle but pointed look, kept his tone even, “Bucky, you had something in your mouth,” Steve said.
on. “As sexy as being the filling of a super-soldier sandwich could be, I’m way too toppy and it’s way too hot in here,” he said, “someone switch with me,” he demanded.
Steve hits the elevator button for the workshop by mistake when they all make their way back to their own quarters. Barnes has to correct him.
Not when the haze had cleared and the body occupying the Captain America suit had not been the same one there a moment ago.
Steve offers a small smile at the beginnings of the soft guitar intro. It’s tense, that smile, and it doesn’t take a PhD to see that.
The argue back and forth, but eventually Pepper comes and sits at Tony’s other side, and Steve knows he’s lost.
Tony probably got the news from Jarvis, Steve knows, or even the colours of his uniform giving it away in the grainy photo, but that isn’t what Tony answers.
He’s still in pre-heat, surrounding himself in blankets and people he likes. Not yet irritable. Not yet horny.
By month five Steve doesn’t respond to Fury’s calls. Won’t stray from the tower, from Tony for less than the call to assemble.
He comes to New York alone the next time it comes up. There’s more romance in a few days long distance than in separate hotels rooms.
Tony caught it from messing up the settings and found it wet. He reluctantly put the screen away at Bucky’s glare, and then wiped his hand off on Bucky’s shirt. “We should get you a pacifier,” he muttered, peeved at being denied his late night work. Tony’s pretty sure he had one, though he couldn’t remember if it doubled as a gag or not. It had been a while since he played ‘daddy’ for anyone.
Tony’s voice snaps him out of it as he swans into the room, later then the rest of the team since he was escorting the Shield van with the mission’s prisoner. “You know Steve, most people make an online dating profile”.
“Yeah, Shield didn’t have much of a chance,” Tony laughs, “only had a twenty-four-hour window and all”.
Tony’s hand comes up and he doesn’t even look, just maintains a searching sort of eye-contact with Steve when his hand covers over Steve’s soulmark.
Get Tony in a room full of new and powerful people, he stands at the highest point and mocks the leader. He was over-compensating.
“Bucky, you need to shower more often, this is…” he sighed, “have you showered in the month since you got here?” he asked.
“Just sign at a camera, Elsa,” Tony had said, “then Jarvis’ll tell us what you’re saying,” Steve’s boyfriend smiled.
He thinks he hears Steve say something else, but he waves goodnight over his shoulder and walks away.
Steve never hated his prior designation, exactly. He had hated getting sick and being considered a commodity, yes, but never did feel wrong in his body.
Showing Bucky, turned into bathing Bucky, because he’d forgotten about taking off his gear, and that soap was a necessity. Hydra usually stripped him and hosed him down and sometimes left him in his clothes, if they were bloody too.
Bruce had been kind, if a little awkward. More awkward than he was with the others, which was saying something. He was charged with ensuring Bucky was actually able to survive off of his plant drinks and Tony’s frozen treats and had to take a blood sample.
Tony designs a new uniform for Steve that hides his face and scent glands without compromising Steve’s own sense of smell because that is how Steve in this body senses danger, and he is so damn good at it that it makes Tony want to go back in time and tear the heads off every alpha that Steve ever had to fight off.
He could feel it when he stood. The way his body had changed. He was not only smaller, but he could feel all the equipment that comes with having a duel reproductive system and he cringed at the wave of vertigo that was swiftly followed by déjà vu.
Tony was restless all throughout dinner, yet when Steve asked, Tony swore he wasn’t going to disappear back into the lab.
“Come on, Buck,” Steve called, gentle, “just lay down, okay?” he said, pointedly not looking at Tony.
The shield stays hidden somewhere, and instead Tony designs a lightweight carbon fiber version that comes to a devastating point for both offensive and defensive use. It stays firmly attached to his person instead of being tossed around like a frisbee.
“Someone should always be questioning your motivations, Fury, but you can’t prove they’re thirty any more than I can prove they’re ninety,” Tony argued.
He thinks about what Tony said, and he feels dread well up because he doesn’t know, not like Tony said he knew, and that isn’t a whole lot better.
It was no surprise that Steve was the person Bucky liked to listen to. That was expected. What wasn’t expected, was Bucky listening to Tony.
of the box since Natasha gave him the bag of Tony’s things, though his memory prevents him from forgetting what awaits him.
Bucky had witnessed Tony’s truly startling love of public displays of ‘affection’ (read: raunchiness) and had giggled quietly at Steve’s face turning all kinds of red.
Steve also starts mumbling about the mess and cleaning up as he goes, and that’s not a sight Tony’s seen from him in months so he tries not to stare.
Tony took the opportunity to lean across the bed and give Steve a quick kiss and a fake smile, then was moving to the door.
So, Tony strips a layer, rolls up the sleeves of his black long-sleeve and Steve unbuttons a couple of buttons from his own shirt. His scent is everywhere now, released from the stifling collar of his shirt. Steve’s got an undershirt on which is Tony’s saving grace really.
He knows it’s not like that now though. People who aren’t soulmates are allowed to marry now, and tradition has changed.
He knew a part of the trust the Soldier had had in his Handler’s was brainwashing and orders, he knew that he had been forced to believe that a Handler’s word was law… but when it came to Steve and Tony… Well, if their word was law, Bucky was more than happy to treat that law like a religion.
Bucky seemed to relax completely, and without missing a beat, he had his flesh thumb in his mouth again.
Right away Steve knows that this is more information than Tony has ever given on the topic, and despite how many other people are in the room, it’s Steve who Tony stared back at, as if he’s speaking only to Steve, like the others aren’t there at all.
Steve has an eidetic memory, has since the serum. Still, when he replays that night in his head, he cannot tell the truth of events from what is Steve’s own love drunk and rose-tinted glasses skewing things out of proportion.
“Shit,” Tony cursed softly. One of those days. Also happening more often, and probably connected to the lack of sleep. These were the days Tony hated to love, if that made any sense.
“Adorable,” Steve mumbled, rolling his eyes, because if Tony did that, it meant something entirely different.
He should have made sure Tony was ready, that whatever was driving that restless leg at the dinner table wasn’t going to get in the way of the battle.
Tony’s seen the glowing blue before though, under different circumstances, silk sheets, and the New York city lights.
Sam had felt really bad about what happened with the solid food ordeal, and then admitted to overstepping a second time when he found Bucky sleeping under the table.
He’s had a fair few drags himself, though he knows it never lasts more than a couple of minutes in his system, but he can’t help the turn his thoughts take when Tony’s restless fingers are tapping out a beat against his own chest, right where Steve’s soulmark rests on his chest.
An alpha would never, ever close their eyes with another alpha crowding them like this. Tony knew that much.
Steve laughs, “No, no you’re right,” he grins but if falls from his face a moment later when he goes on, “I keep thinking about whoever my soulmate was,” he’s looking into the fire and blaming the heat for the way his eyes sting, “How their thinking must have had to be similar to yours,” he can’t really look at Tony, but goes on, “I hope it was,” he admits. “My mark wasn’t added to the public databases,” he says, “They must have thought I didn’t want them, we never met,” he mumbles but then he glances at Tony, “I hope they learned that soulmates aren’t everything” a pause, “I hope they still let themselves be happy” he finishes.
Tony gives it to Hill and tells her it came from one of their old shield scientists that Tony’s been in contact with.
“Maybe this is karma,” Steve laughs at himself, “for putting them through that. It’s my turn to suffer,” he says with a chuckle.
He wished he could take the words back the moment he said them out loud, as his voice prompted the room to follow Steve’s line of sight to stare directly at Tony.
that gained Bucky’s trust, or respect, or whatever it was that made him look at Tony and Steve like they hung the god damn stars.
She nods at Tony’s prone form, “stuff from his pockets,” she murmurs, soft despite the set of her jaw.
things. He tried to not think about it. Bucky would talk about it if he needed to. He repeated it like a mantra until he was able to go back to reading his book, which is what he had been doing prior to Tony’s departure, and a while later, having lost himself in the text, Steve remembered to look up and check on Bucky.
He felt beautiful somehow when Tony was inside him. Felt like Tony’s beauty had reached inside of him the same way Tony was with his tongue and fingers and cock.
“We know they are not in any recorded database for the dead, we know they are not in any seniors home, we know that no one has come forward to have known someone from that era who had that mark and it’s been streaming all over the planet for days now,” Fury combats, “The only people coming forward are in their twenties and thirties”.
Natalia had been afraid but played it off as silent solidarity. That lasted until she witnessed her former trainer on his knees vomiting for what felt like hours because
The empty ring box still sits on Tony’s bedside table, though it was shifted slightly. Pepper hadn’t met Steve’s eye as she left, quiet. He assumes it was her.
For a few minutes things feel so domestically normal that he forgets that Steve isn’t an alpha anymore.
In the end though, Steve breaks down and admits it himself. He wishes he could say it wasn’t because he was being a coward anymore, but it was rather the opposite.
He’s still so gentle when he takes Tony’s hand in his, peppers kisses all over the cool flesh. Each scar and divot, every callous and vein. Kisses and kisses and cries all the while, sobbing quietly now, and
They were finishing up the debrief on their last mission when Fury requested Steve stay a moment after the group cleared out, but Tony had this sharp gleam in his eye and refused to leave, stayed seated and gave Fury that infuriating look that meant he knew the steps in whatever dance this was better then Fury himself and demanded Fury go on with him present.
He also knew Steve had been steadily relaxing into Tony’s scent, as fifteen minutes after Steve had curled up in a little ball, he had his face pressed into Tony’s pillow and barely had his eyes open.
Now, asking if he’d like orange or apple juice was met with a bratty scoff, and a “You know what I like,” which sounded flirty, sounded a lot like
Steve doesn’t go to church anymore. Not since New York. Not since he started staying at the Tower when he was in the city.
Bruce’s face scrunched up but he didn’t say anything until he was wiping a spot on the crease of Bucky’s arm with alcohol and a cotton ball, which turned into four cotton balls before the crease of his arm was considered sterile enough.
Tony doesn’t look at him, just nods at the skyline and says, “It must have been hard,” like Steve wasn’t just explaining a version of Tony’s own misery.
Tony really needs to hang on to those things. The realness of Steve when he does what’s been begged of him.
to move past Hydra, to get himself together. He kept pushing himself, even when he got frustrated, even when there were things that were just too much. He didn’t give up.
Natasha comes down hard on Tony, asks why Tony can’t just be happy for Steve, and Tony makes some snide remark that’s more defense mechanism than answer and they all know it.
It takes two minutes for Jarvis to report that Tony is unresponsive. That he cannot override the suit’s flight systems. That Tony has sustained a
It doesn’t matter though because a few days later Tony’s hand twitches against Steve’s and he once again can barely breathe.
“You can’t prove that they’re a senior citizen, and that’s to say nothing of the fact you shouldn’t be questioning my motivations,” Fury said.
“Oh,” Steve said a little shocked, “Well that’s okay, as long as you’re not biting,” he said, “can I see your hand?” he asked.
Understands why Tony had looked and felt so alive with nervous energy that night before the call came.
But then Steve recalled the other reason why Tony might have had that cringing expression on his face when he squared his shoulders and peeled off the top half of the flightsuit in anticipation for his turn in the shower stall.
It takes a few days, or maybe it was weeks, for Steve to discover that it was not in fact his love for Tony, nor the contrast of the sterile bland hospital and fluorescent lights that washed out Tony’s skin that had made his last good memory of his love seem so… so excited, so nervous, so energetic, bright,
He posed on the covers of magazines, topless and with his tattoo on display, for the first time at eighteen years old, so Shield hadn’t been able to catch Tony’s soulmark on camera in the three years before the young billionaire had it covered. Shield had reason to believe he got the tattoo long before that scandalous photoshoot too, if their reports were anything to go off of.
On days like this, Bucky was soft and gentle, a little scared, a little nervous, a little bratty, and very, very orally fixated, and Steve was always ‘Stevie’.
It probably said more about Tony than about Bucky, but damn, was Tony ever a sucker for super-soldiers with a sob story.
Heads up, Bucky's asexuality has nothing to do with what Hydra did - Bucky will explore his sexuality later and in his own POV
Steve was quiet a while longer, “I don’t know if I want to,” he admitted, “I want to believe the universe just messed up, that it was some cosmic fluke, because I think…” he trailed off and then took a breath, “I think if I don’t think that, then I’m just a selfish man who left his soulmate suffering, hurt, and alone all this time,” he whispers.
The women who cursed Steve isn’t talking, so says Thor on Asgard. The only other sorcerer they know on earth is an entitled alpha douchebag, so it’s nothing but a waiting game.
He wasn’t sure what was making Bucky start to panic, colour pinking his cheeks with shame as he slowly moved away from Steve, shaking his head. He didn’t look like he was having a flashback, his eyes, though refusing to meet Steve’s and skittering around the room, were clear, if a little watery.
Right now, Steve is looking at the hybrid expression of those two distinct Tony Stark looks ™. Wise beyond his years, and arrogant know-it-all wrapped up into one.
Barnes is obviously aware of that when he barges into Tony’s workshop a few hours later. It’s nearly three in the morning.
He knew Steve smelt nothing like an alpha and nothing like a beta, but that he instead smelt so very, very faintly s
“I’m sorry,” Steve says despite the joke in Tony’s tone, “It just seems weird, you seeing it before we met,” he says, “You saw it before I was—when I was still in the ice”.
He just sits there for hours, and then later for days as he goes through the routine of his life. He just thinks about what that must have been like for Tony as a young man.
He was not only a big baby when he was tired. That was just when he couldn’t help but let his guard down.
Tony warred with himself for some time, wondering if he should bother. Wondering if that would have only made it worse.
In the weeks following that discussion she spends far more time than Steve is really comfortable with trying to find him a date. When none of it works, she challenges him on his pessimistic attitude. She swears Steve’s still an optimist at heart, and Steve thinks that’s incredibly kind of her, but to prove her point, she goes ahead and looks up Steve’s mark.
“His office, all destroyed now, not that it’s much secret these days” Tony replied, glancing up from the circuit bored in his hands. They were in the lab now, the wind far too cold to justify standing outside in it.
Tony has always known about this part of Steve. He just never thought he would see it. That it would be real some day.
He knows what he’s expecting when buttons are undone and eyes are left lingering, but that’s too many drinks in and Steve can’t say what his original plan had been with any certainty.
The wound that did this to Tony has closed and begun to scab. His hair is growing back where it was shaved away for surgery, though it is uneven and Pepper makes idle comments about trimming it.
This at least, gave way to the growing of Steve’s friendship with Natasha into a kind of companionship that had felt bittersweet to Steve.
Feeling companionship with Nat and Sam was one thing, but Steve as an alpha was incapable of forming a pack of his own and thus the memory of the pack he once had with Bucky remained honoured in Steve’s mind.
Tony hadn’t met many people that weren’t betas at the time. But he could still have said he’d met more than the average alpha, thanks to his lifestyle.
. He just hadn’t ever seen it. Shield kept soulmarks in their records, as did the army. Shield kept records of the soulmarks of more than just their employees though. They liked to have the marks of some of their targets and people of interest too, which has unsettled Steve a bit. Tony Stark’s soulmark, even though he was incredibly famous, had always alluded Shield.
Bucky whimpered, loudly. More of a high-pitched whine, really. Something hurt and confused like when you step on your dog’s tail by mistake.
“Communal showers,” Steve says, shaking his head ruefully, “Some things haven’t changed,” he chuckles.
Steve had slipped into another reality when he had slipped into Tony’s lap. When his shirt had slipped from his shoulders.
He feels Tony go tense under him, then he’s being held tighter to Tony’s chest by the hand in his hair. He knows Tony’s figured it out.
Without Tony, there doesn’t seem to be any version of Steve left. He is nothing but the shell of a man.
“Come on, Cap,” Tony smiles, “This is Nirvana, it’s practically a classic at this point,” the genius waves a screwdriver at the wincing man.
It’s not long before Tony makes up an extravagant excuse to leave that Steve can’t tell if he’s lying about or not, and they don’t bring up soulmates the next time it’s just the two of them, but Steve’s gets brought up the next time there’s a mission and the team all have breakfast together the next day.
Steve looks in a way that would see him in confession on Sunday if he knew that it would help. Unfortunately, Steve knows that no number of hail Mary’s will purify his thoughts. Or stop his sketchbooks from filling with images of Tony’s profile.
“I mean, Nat’s done it, too, slept in my bed a few times when she can’t let her guard down and whatever,” Clint disclosed, “Just figured Tony would maybe… you know, since you and Steve used to…” he left the sentence open ended.
Tony looks at Steve then, “Are you?” he asks, “Suffering, Steve?” and there’s something sharp in his voice, something urgent but nervous that Steve can’t begin to understand.
That was his best friend. That was his teammate. That was the guy he rutted up against and who rolls around in Tony’s den and…
This is almost entirely slice of life, but there is a part two that involves the multiverse and quite a bit of angst. If enough people enjoy these characters maybe I'll continue with it too.
Sometime in the last month, Steve has forgotten that he is Captain America. The pretense has dropped so completely and thoroughly.
They made it beautiful together when Tony’s lips had pressed to his. When Tony’s body had slipped into his.
So, Steve over-compensated. Wondered how long it would take before Tony broke down and called him on it.
He didn’t know what to think about Bucky’s revelation around his current progress in sexuality, though. He was almost afraid to check the files they had found for information on what might have been done to
that just slipped out, almost meaningless on his tongue but for the way that it was more meaningful than Steve or Tony could ever truly understand. It was the kind of
Steve knows that is without a doubt what Tony probably thought. And many things that are much, much worse.
Steve hasn’t been in denial. He’s known since Dr. Cho broke the news that Tony… That this is life now.
“Can you tell me what you were doing?” he asked, knowing Bucky would probably struggle to talk for a few hours.
Steve speaks up again half way through a movie Tony can’t even recall the name of, let alone the plot.
He keeps the box on his chest or on the table by Tony’s bed every night. Takes it with him everywhere.
The dependence started… a long time ago. A few months, right before he’d started therapy, when Steve had caught him with his thumb in his mouth and told him it was
Tony could admit, when he told Steve to bring his POW ex-boyfriend in from the cold, the genius had no idea what to expect.
His therapist said it was less good that he wanted to form a dependence on people, but that recognizing he had a choice in whether he wanted to be dependent or independent was a good thing. As long as Bucky was choosing this, and not feeling like he needed to be, or worse, forgetting that he didn’t need to be, it was okay to want Tony to feed him his popsicles, and for Steve to mix his protein drinks for him.
