"Anything at all. Suck me, fuck me... Hurt me..." Gabe whispers urgently, his breath hot on John’s lips. "I'll suck you... eat your ass... anything."
He retrieves his pyjama pants from where they lie, discarded on the floor in the heat of passion the night before, and steps into them. He finds his t-shirt draped over his knocked-over bedside lamp and pulls it on over his head as he exits his bedroom.
He lifts Sherlock gently, then pulls him back down on his cock. John is surprised at the guttural moan which tears itself from his throat. Sherlock is staring down into John’s eyes, still taking a passive role despite his position.
He falls asleep on the second night, on the couch, with his phone still clutched in his hand, the message unsent. He wakes up the next morning with his phone gently cradled against his cricked neck and Mycroft Holmes regarding him coolly from the armchair across the room.
John glances at his office door and rubs the heel of his free hand against the bulge in his trousers.
Sherlock opened the door to the street and stepped outside into the cool night. John was standing by the doorstep, his hands in his pockets, looking across the street. Sherlock moved to stand at his side, listening to the violin drifting down from the windows upstairs.
The unspoken question hung between them. Would John be returning to Baker Street? John didn't answer for a long time. When Sherlock finally dared to look at John, the soft expression on his face near took his breath away.
John jolts a moment later as he thinks he hears a dull thud in the hall outside his bedroom door. He freezes, hand still on his cock, heart still racing from his orgasm, eyes wide in the darkness as he listens.
Mara could understand the attraction to this type of Reverie. She'd always loved detective stories as a child, in fact, it was part of the reason she'd taken such an interest in psychology and its applications in law enforcement. She could understand wanting to play the lead role, the hero—she'd seen it hundreds of times in every variation of James Bond or Poirot fantasy.
" John scoffs, hands on his hips, "Sherlock bloody Holmes, unique in all the world, superior to the rest of us mere mortals,
After a few long, silent moments, John slowly sides the drawer open again. He stares at the dildo and his first, honest thought is,
The case is solved by the time they leave the crime scene, Sherlock making wild deductive leaps, even wilder hand gestures and generally being brilliant and sexy- err. Being brilliant. Just brilliant.
"True," Sherlock says. "I've had no auditory... inspiration for what feels like an eternity. I liked coming every night, with your orgasm ringing in my ears..."
The moan that escapes his lips as he takes hold of his rock-hard cock is purely coincidental too, of course. Just a physical reaction to pleasure. Nothing to do with the fact that he's imagining Sherlock lying down on his bed and doing the same thing.
Those are the last coherent words John manages to get out for a while. Sherlock is tight and hot and responsive and before long, John has managed to sit up, has wrapped his arms around Sherlock’s thin-but-strong body, has hooked his hands over Sherlock’s shoulders and is pulling him down hard onto his dick. Sherlock has dropped his head to kiss John, a constant, demanding kiss, both men groaning into it as they move together. Sherlock’s thigh muscles tremble as he rides John’s cock, resisting John’s strength as the shorter man drags him down, forces him to take his thick, hard dick inside him over and over and over.
John slid up closer to Sherlock's side and breached his hole with one fingertip. He kissed Sherlock's moist cheekbone softly, then breathed in his ear, "This night could never be long enough for all the things I want to do to you, Sherlock."
After the failed extraction attempt Mara convened with Alexis Barrett, tech genius and founder of Onira-Tech, Paul Hammond, Chief Oneirologist with the company, and Charlie Ventana, head of security. Alexis was tapping away at a tablet containing a diagnostic report on the Reverie session.
John stops and rubs his forehead tiredly. "Yeah, she did," he mutters, not even bothering to ask him how he knew.
. If this is the only time someone has me like this, I want it to be..." Sherlock whispered, his eyes wide and pleading, his voice shaking. He mouthed the word, too ashamed to say it.
Sherlock breaks the kiss and pulls back, John giving a small, bereft moan. He quickly moves to stand beside the bed and pulls the covers down violently, freeing John. His eyes rake down the doctor's prone form and rest for a moment on the erection tenting his pyjama bottoms. John shifts slightly on the bed, suddenly feeling self-conscious and exposed.
"All right," John said, and abruptly walked across the road, straight to the mandala, touched it and disappeared.
"Moriarty could have had you! Anything could have happened! Do you have any idea the things that have been going through my head?"
Reverie Sherlock looked at Real World Sherlock, held his gaze for a long moment, then looked away again before speaking.
Sherlock's eyes roamed all over John's body, taking in the play of flickering firelight and shadow, the creases of his brow. As he watched, John reached up, grabbing at the leg of the desk, and pushed down, taking Sherlock's cock to the hilt with a long low groan.
"If you hated me, I couldn’t bear it," Sherlock murmurs, avoiding John’s eyes. "I couldn’t function. I wouldn’t survive it."
"I didn't. I didn't know if I'd survive unravelling Moriarty's web. Sometimes I didn't know if I'd even survive the night. I almost died on several occasions. I ended up in hospital twice. Each time, I woke up looking for you, asking for you. Each time, I hoped you'd have found me and would be sitting at my bedside, waiting to tell me what an idiot I'd been," Sherlock speaks, getting more and more worked up with each word. "But I was too clever for my own good. Too convincing. My deception of you was so complete that-"
John holds Sherlock until his breathing gentles, until he can feel the man pulling himself together, bracing himself.
It was a slow process, and it hurt worse the deeper John got, but once he was fully seated and had given Sherlock time to adjust, it started to feel more enjoyable. It still wasn't the most comfortable thing, but it wasn't unbearable.
He gasped when what felt like a dozen fingers started caressing his body, seeming to touch every single one of his erogenous zones at once with a crackling electricity. His back arched and his eyes flew open as he writhed against the onslaught of feelings.
He couldn't stop looking at John. The guilt at having left him alone for so long was in no way outweighed by his anger at the incompetents Mycroft called 'handlers'. The bottom line was that if he hadn't left, John would not be in hospital.
In the late afternoon John heads out, taking a walking tour of all of their regular haunts, but fails to locate Sherlock. Angelo hasn't seen him, neither has Rosemary at the local Chinese restaurant. He goes further afield, to Bart's and the Yard, but there's no sign of Sherlock there either. Finally, he reluctantly goes to the pool where they met Moriarty for the second time. There is no sign of Sherlock and the place still gives him the willies so John leaves as quickly as he can. On his way home, the local Big Issue sellers haven't seen their mysterious benefactor, or if they have, they aren't speaking up. John returns to the flat just on dusk, favouring his right leg slightly.
"The issue is... is... I told you this would make things weird. I fucking told you. But, ohh no, I'm the Great Sherlock Holmes, I know everything!"
Sherlock smiles an unguarded, slightly goofy smile and kisses John's cheek quickly before walking to the curb, arm already raised to hail a cab, which, of course, appears from nowhere and stops for him. He's got one leg in the open door of the cab when he pauses to look back at John.
“Seven percent.” Sherlock’s voice came from the doorway, causing John to jump. “That was my solution. Just enough to stop my mind, but not enough to do any major physical damage.” A weight fell over John’s heart as he watched Sherlock rub at his forearm.
"I don't want to hurt you." John whispered, his voice so soft and unsure it made Sherlock's heart swell. He leaned in again, this time John let him, and kissed his boyfriend, soft and sweet.
John prepared Sherlock's body to accept him with ease, the process easier than it had ever been, and within minutes, he was rising to his feet, Sherlock's legs hooked over his elbows as he lined himself up and pressed in.
"Hmm, nope, I don't think so." John laughed against his neck, now using his hands to tickle Sherlock's sides as well.
The air around John was filled with an unmistakable energy, Sherlock’s breath becoming visible as the temperature dropped.
"That's right. Now, enough talk." John threaded his fingers in Sherlock's hair and tugged, making Sherlock gasp and turn his head. "Fuck me." Sherlock chuckled catching John's lips in another bruising kiss and pulling him off the wall. They stumbled down the hall, tugging at each other's clothes and sharing rough, urgent kisses.
Sherlock spent many days trying to rebuild his mind palace since moving back into Baker Street. He would sit on the sofa and stare endlessly at the walls, ignoring John’s pleas for him to eat or sleep.
“No.” Sherlock’s vision turned red as the palace crumbled around them. He swung, catching his double in the chin, sending him flying.
“You don’t.” Geoff pushed himself to his feet, reaching down and offering his hand to Sherlock. “I do.” Sherlock solidified his hand and allowed himself to be pulled to his feet.
“Mr. Watson, please, take a seat.” John nodded and sat, fidgeting uncomfortably in the high-backed leather chair. Mycroft smirked smugly at him, causing is discomfort to rise in his chest. “Pleasure to see you again.”
“Y-Yes.” John whispered, nearly whimpering as Sherlock pulled away. The Siren’s eye glinted, danger with the slightest hint of nervousness as he swam onto the boat. He sat on the floor and pulled John onto his lap, cupping his cheek and bringing him in for a soft kiss.
"Fine." John sighed dramatically, sitting back and stretching, sending fire through Sherlock's body. "What time are you dancing tomorrow?"
“Yeah, sorry about that. I just realized something that I had been trying to avoid.” The band started to play, a soft, sweet song. Perfect to dance to, of course. Sherlock flushed as the music started, and John felt a swell of affection for the other man.
It had only been an hour since John left, so when Sherlock felt the phone in his pocket start to vibrate, he scrambled to answer. Maybe John had changed his mind.
"So, is that a yes?" John laughed and leaned up, pressing a soft kiss to one of Sherlock's ridiculous cheekbones. "Oh." Sherlock gasped, pulling another laugh from John.
“Come now John, like Sherlock would even consider dating a slag like me.” Mike winked at Sherlock and giggled when Sherlock blushed. “I’ve got to be getting back to the lab. Let’s go gather your samples eh?”
“I ran because of Moriarty. Not John. It was a mistake and I was planning to return in the morning. I-I-” Sherlock hesitated, feeling the words catch in his throat. “If I say it, John will be freed, correct?”
“No. I don’t believe that.” John leaned back, taking Sherlock’s face in his hands and looking into the pale eyes he loved so much. “I’ve seen this before. Whoever did this to you, whoever told you these things, they’re wrong Love. They’re so incredibly wrong. I’ve seen you, the real you, and I know that this is not who you are.” He pulled Sherlock’s face to his and kissed him, softly and lovingly, trying to convey everything he was feeling. Sherlock didn’t respond at first, merely letting John kiss him.
“Well, that was-” John’s words were cut off by a flash of light and a giant puff of smoke filling the air between them.
John's hands wound around his shoulders, pulling himself up on his toes to deepen the kiss further. Sherlock's hands landed on John's hips and he tugged the boy closer, whimpering as John bit down on his bottom lip and sucked gently.
“More than anything.” The Enchantress smiled, dropping his hands and stepping back towards the dome that held the rose.
“Don’t you dare.” John whispered before closing the gap between them and finally kissing the man he had loved for so long.
John screamed as he watched another blade pierce Sherlock's chest and exit his back, his face going slack and his body collapsing with Moriarty's.
"Perhaps if you idiots had a collective IQ higher than-" John stood, grabbing the taller man's elbow and dragging him away, ignoring his protests and offering Lestrade an apologetic smile as he hauled the squirming man into his bedroom. "John, what the-" John closed the door and shoved Sherlock back against the door, glaring at him just long enough to make the genius blush and fidget uncomfortably. "John-"
The Siren was stunning, twisting and moving gracefully through the waves of energy surrounding him. He grinned when the creature stopped, his tail hidden behind a cluster of stars, giving him the appearance that he was one with the sky.
"Maybe I don't want to be friends with you." The hurt and understanding in the taller boy's face nearly broke John's heart. "Maybe I want to date you." Sherlock blinked down at John, nearly frozen in shock.
John waited until Sherlock's breathing had evened out before shifting, sliding an arm under his legs and lifting him off his feet.
"No, you're just going to take off to some God-forsaken desert to get shot at." John dropped his hand, blinking rapidly as Sherlock glared down at the ground. "I-I- John-" John reached into his pocket, pulling out the small, velvet box he had been carrying with him. He heard his boyfriend's breath stutter and sniffed, smiling sadly at the box he was turning over in his hands. "J-John-"
"So you would be totally fine with sleeping alone at night, knowing that John is off somewhere, fucking some random woman, instead of lying next to you?" Nausea swept through Sherlock's body and he shifted uncomfortably, not wanting to think about that.
"No, Silly Git." He said fondly, running a hand through his hair and grinning. "I mean, I like watching you dance." Sherlock blushed again and shifted against the headboard, not missing the way John's eyes darkened at his reaction.
“Yeah Mate, your heart stopped. You’ve been out for almost a week.” John felt his chest tighten. He shook his head, breathing in shakily and feeling an uncomfortable weight on his lungs.
"N-No, I- I want to, just- just not on the floor." John laughed, kissing Sherlock deeply before pushing himself to his feet, pulling Sherlock along with him.
Once they were ready, Mr. Holmes led them into the house, chattering away about how glad he was that the boys could join them for dinner. John leaned in close to Sherlock, a gentle grin tugging at his lips.
"Yours actually. It's not easy to focus on chemistry when you've got a gorgeous mouth wrapped around your-"
The first several performances were the younger kids, stumbling through their routines awkwardly. It was cute, but John was unbelievably bored.
"- Shut up now," John says, shaking his head and grinning despite himself. "You never know when to just... stop."
The first thing he noticed was that there was a playpen in the corner. Children's toys were scattered around the sitting room. He frowned slightly, not understanding. No child was present.
Sherlock Holmes stepped off the private jet, not even taking a moment to breathe in the London-ness of the Heathrow air before sliding into a dark silver Jaguar. Such was his concern for John that he didn't exchange customary unpleasantries with Mycroft upon seeing him. Mycroft wordlessly handed Sherlock a file, which Sherlock flipped through before speaking.
Sherlock frowned slightly but nodded and walked into the kitchen. He focussed on the low murmur of voices coming from the sitting room but was unable to discern what was being said. When he glanced back at the chair, what he saw made him breathe in quickly.
"I’ll do anything you want," Gabe whispers, brushing his lips against John’s again. "You can do anything you want to me..."
Sherlock is stunned. This contingency clearly hadn't occurred to him. It shows on his face and John shakes his head, almost sadly.
John Watson was fucking him with his tongue and Sherlock Holmes was sure this was how he was going to die. He could see it clearly in his mind: stiff, formal, dignified Mycroft Holmes ordering a headstone engraved "Here lies Sherlock Holmes, killed by anilingus".
She followed the duo through the night, watching as they kicked in doors, examined clues and restrained suspects. The pair seemed to move as a cohesive unit, instinctively covering each other and playing off one another's strengths. She found herself marvelling at the amazing system Onira-Tech had created and the way it had fleshed out the fantasy of its user.
Sherlock slipped into the bed beside John, their two bodies fitting together in an embrace like puzzle pieces slotting together.
John wonders if perhaps Sherlock is thinking about him, after all, he seems to be doing that a lot lately. It then occurs to John to wonder just when he started wondering about Sherlock like this. He frowns as he rolls onto his back, staring up at the darkened ceiling.
“What’s wrong?” Sherlock ignored him and grabbed his Star Guide, handing it to John with a serious expression on his beautiful features.
"Where do you think you're going Love?" Sherlock gasped as he felt John's lips brush against his ear.
“Thank you for the generous offer Mrs. Holmes, but there are some things I left back at my place that Sherlock needs. You know, medication and the like.” John said, feeling Mycroft’s gaze fall heavily on him and fighting back a blush.
"You threatened to let your men rape me if I didn't speak, why should I believe that I'm safe now?" John chuckled, leaning back in his chair taking a swig of the whiskey.
"Yeah, because you woke me up at three in the morning to ask if I was happy." Sherlock blushed, avoiding John's gaze and picking at the edge of his blanket. "Babe, what's wrong?"
"Uh, Sherlock?" John asked, startling the boy. Sherlock shot upright, scrambling to his feet. As soon as he put pressure on his feet, the boy yelped and crumbled to the floor. "Jesus, what the-" John hurried to Sherlock's side, kneeling beside him and helping him to a sitting position. "Are you okay?" Sherlock nodded, wincing as he rubbed his feet.
"You want sex." John choked on his drink at Sherlock's words, coughing violently and blushing. He finally managed to clear his airway, glancing around the nearly empty café before turning back to his boyfriend.
“You dated him for three months, you would go to coffee shops, and the library. You hunted for a way to bring him back, then when you finally figured it out, you wound up with me and I broke your heart.” John sighed, Sherlock knew the memories, but didn’t have the emotions that went with them. At least he remembered who John was.
“Sherlock, they won’t hold. And I would rather not have to hold back with you.” Sherlock let out a needy sound and kissed him again, biting at his bottom lip and sucking gently. John could feel his self control slipping with each move the younger man made. Sherlock made a noise of frustration and pushed back, sitting on his heels and tugging at his hair. He looked thoroughly dishevelled, even though nothing had happened yet.
“Well I did. People thought I was crazy, talking about this mysterious ‘Sherlock’ and whatnot. Even Greg and Mouse thought I had lost it. Hell, I thought I had lost it for the longest time. Until I was shot. Then I met this really unpleasant man that started talking about how it figured that he would be the one to go claim the soul of the man that hurt his brother so much.”
“Please, John wouldn’t- I-I trust him.” She smiled softly at Sherlock, seeming to see just how much he was hurting. She stepped closer and placed a soft hand on Sherlock’s cheek.
“Sherlock? What’s wrong darling?” Victor asked, placing a hand on his shoulder and watching him with concern. “Are you- are you, high?”
"That's it Baby, come for Daddy. Let me feel you." It only took a handful of thrust to finally push Sherlock over the edge, his orgasm pulling a loud cry,
He slid a hand between them after several minutes, gripping Sherlock's leaking erection and stroking him in time with his hips.
“Nope, I’m head of a security force now. Some posh Prince who pissed of the wrong people. Not that I’m surprised, this guy is a right ass. Hot as Hell though.” Sherlock fought back a chill at the memory of his brother and the Head of Security flirting aggressively. “I can still get you onto E6’s Med Bay from here though. Why do you need it?”
“Buddy of mine has a scar that is tainted and I’m trying to help him get rid of it.” John spun the camera to face Sherlock, clearly missing the terror on the Siren’s face. Sherlock had yet to change back to his Siren form, but he saw the recognition cross the other man’s face instantly. “This is-”
“Oh, calm yourself, you big baby. He was under the impression that he wasn’t allowed up here so I told him to meet you down there.”
"Sherlock? Please tell me you cleared off the counter like I asked-" John froze in the doorway, forcing a polite smile on his face as his eyes landed on the woman sitting across from Sherlock. "Oh, you didn't tell me we had a client." The woman ran her eyes over John's body, causing a flush to rise along his chest and neck.
"I can protect you-" Sherlock gripped the boy's elbow trying desperately to pull him back into the shadows, away from prying eyes. Pain echoed through his head as a fist connected with his jaw, sending him reeling back.
It took Sherlock nearly a week of searching to find another lead. The ring he was tracking was well-organized and efficient, every time he got close, they would disappear, leaving at least one of the boys to freeze to death in the streets.
John laughed at something Margret said and Sherlock felt a wave of hurt and irritation crash over him as she giggled squeakily and gripped his boyfriend's elbow.
"Nothing for you to be sorry for Love, just promise you'll talk to me next time, yeah?" Sherlock smiled shyly, nodding timidly before pushing at his boyfriend's shoulders. "Alright, calm down there, Tiny Dancer."
“There is no time. Everything you need to know about the tissues is on this data stick, but you need to get as far away from E2 as you can.” Mike shoved a small object into John’s hand before pulling him in for a hug. “Be careful. I’ve explained everything on the Data Stick. Just go, now.” He pulled back slightly and pressed a gentle kiss to John’s lips before pushing him away.
“He was your first kill.” John nodded, running his hand through his hair and sighing. “It wasn’t your fault John.”
John was leaning against a wall, talking with one of the cheerleaders, Martha? Mary? Sherlock didn't remember what her name was, all he knew was that she was standing way too close and kept touching John's arm.
"He's in the hospital, Sherlock." Dread settled in the pit of his stomach. "A couple officers found him down by the docks around midnight. Looks like he was pumped full of heroin and thrown out of a moving car, same as the others."
Sherlock had a concussion, three cracked ribs and a laceration on his stomach that required stitches. It also turned out that the great Mr. Sherlock Holmes was one of the worst patients John had ever seen. Once he woke up, he immediately started whining and throwing a tantrum of epic proportions.
Sherlock groaned, dropping his head back against the pillows. Since waking up, a voice kept speaking up from the back of his mind, talking endlessly about some mysterious man named John Watson that he supposedly loved.
“Hang on Sherlock.” John reached into the bowl and pulled out a handful of ashes, packing them into the wound on Sherlock’s chest. He fought to hold the man down as he writhed and screamed in pain. John watched as the bullet slid out of his chest and rolled to the ground. He packed more ashes into the wound and sat back, praying that would be enough.
John had set up the T.V. so that they could sit on the bed, curled under the blankets while propped against the wall.
“Stop with the attitude or I will leave you out here to freeze.” Mrs. Hudson finally seemed to notice John, waving the boys in and leading them up the stairs. “Good to finally meet you Captain.” John flushed darkly as he realized that the lady knew who he was.
John smiled brightly up at him, taking his hand and leading him out of the washroom. Greg was propped up against the wall across from the door, cocking his eyebrow at them as they passed.
“You have nothing to be sorry for Love. Now, can we please get a cab? I can’t feel my fingers.” Sherlock chuckled softly, even the tiny smile lighting up his eyes. “There’s that smile I love seeing.” John kissed him softly once more before pulling the taller man to his feet and stepping to the curb to hail a cab.
As they ate, John once again glanced around at his family, his eyes landing on his boyfriend. Harry had seated herself across from Sherlock and was bugging him, as usual, by sneaking little chunks of cranberry sauce into his mashed potatoes when he wasn't looking.
“Exactly. Now, please let me help you. You are losing blood and I’m really concerned about your wrist. I’m going to let you go now, will you behave long enough for me to fix you up?” Sherlock nodded, breathing a sigh of relief as the weight disappeared from his chest. The Beast nodded and placed the case on the bed next to Sherlock’s head, pulling it open and rifling through.
"Right, Gavin's house party or something, right?" John laughed, a more full sound that sent a flare of warmth through Sherlock's chest. He quickly tamped down on the feeling, not willing to let his heart get involved this time.
John's lips pressed against his own and he felt himself relaxing almost instantly, sighing into the kiss as John traced his sides softly.
"Hey Tiny Dancer." Sherlock felt his pulse stutter as the last boy, the one he wanted to see the most, stopped before him, a wide grin on his face.
"Are you mad?" Sherlock snatched the biscuit out of John's hand just as he was about to feed it to Rosie. "She has already had one today, that is more than enough." John rolled his eyes and laughed, pulling another sweet out of the box.
“Precision, an Energy Bow, and a hell of a lot of luck.” Sherlock chuckled. “That Hope, I’m pretty sure it belonged to a Bounty Hunter called the Spider.” Sherlock’s eyes landed on John, sharp and dangerous.
“For the most part. It had a massive red spider branded onto it’s middle. I’ve only ever seen that mark on Spider’s ships.”
John broke the kiss, dropping his head back against the wall and struggling to regain his breath. Sherlock kept pressing soft kisses to his neck and what little skin he could reach on his shoulders.
"Fuck-" the boy cursed as he peeled at the bandages on his ribs, whimpering as the torn skin caught on the cotton. He dropped his head back against the wall, fighting back a pained sob as his body began shaking violently.
John was attracted to him. He didn't mind that Sherlock was a little strange, that he was obsessed with bees and liked getting his hair tugged. He didn't care that Sherlock had a nasty ex that had hurt him so thoroughly that it would probably take him years to mend his heart.
“Then fuck yes.” John laughed against Sherlock’s shoulder, sucking his own mark into the pale skin there. “Looks like I managed the impossible.”
There should have been a flash of panic, cold terror washing over him, but instead, as he looked into the dead eyes of his captor, all he felt was emptiness. He grinned at the man before him, knowing how horrific he must look. He could feel the blood and torn skin pulling as he grinned.
“Ah, much better!” The young man grinned, dusting off his shoulders and stretching his long, thin frame. He was tall, too thin, and unnaturally pale. His cheekbones were sharp and high-set, making him look less than human. He was gorgeous and John couldn’t help feeling a little self-conscious.
Sherlock jumped as he felt a pair of hands grip his hips, startling him out of his thoughts. He tried to squirm away, nearly panicking until he felt the familiar press of lips against his neck.
He silently climbed out of bed, wincing slightly as his wounds ached. His legs felt weak due to inactivity and he stumbled, catching himself on the bed before he fell.
“Damn. I’ll just have to try harder next time.” Sherlock helped his double to his feet, supporting the weak man.
"That's amazing." Sherlock blinked rapidly, unsure how to process the conversation. Even his conversations with Victor in the beginning hadn't gone like this.
Sherlock finally looks up, meeting John’s eyes. He stands and moves over to the table, settling into the chair opposite John. His voice is a low rumble when he speaks again.
"There's nothing out there for me, Sherlock. My life... if I hadn't met you, my life would have ended in months. I want to stay here with you."
"I can't wait any longer, John," Sherlock breathed, shuffling forward and replacing his finger with his cock, pushing gently at John's entrance.
There's about a minute of silence, broken only by the occasional bang of John depositing the shopping in any non-contaminated, available cupboards he can find.
when I'm with you. The person I am now has had eighteen months' experience in missing you, and appreciates you all the more for it. The Sherlock in Reverie... I expect he reacted the way you believed he would and I'm sorry you thought I felt less for you than I do."
It’s when John notices that Sherlock’s started avoiding even looking at him that he starts to worry.
"You're so sensitive, aren't you?" John mused, watching his fingertips dance slowly down Sherlock's pectoral muscle, narrowly missing his nipple, then trail down the side of his ribcage. "Has anyone ever touched you like this before?"
"I'll be right back, are you okay here with her?" Lestrade asked, heading off to talk to a uniformed officer when John nodded.
John's eyes are squeezed closed and his voice is low and harsh as he breathes into the phone, "I'm so hard for you, Sherlock.
"No," Sherlock says simply, then kisses John until he’s on his back, breathless and clinging to him and unable to argue.
Sherlock clenched around John's cock, drawing a groan from him. He grinned to himself, closing his eyes, memorising and cataloguing the feeling of John's hard, girthy cock deep inside him, slick with come, the sounds he made, the feeling of his arms around Sherlock's body, the feeling of completeness in the heart Sherlock had always claimed he didn't have.
John curled his fingers again and rubbed his fingertips in small circles inside Sherlock, finding his sweet spot with unerring doctorly accuracy.
John pushed Sherlock's thighs up, folding him in half. Sherlock flushed, a little horrified at how exposed this new position left him. John let out a long, blowing breath, the cool air chilling the sweaty skin between Sherlock's legs. Sherlock looked down at him and John met his eye.
As suddenly as it had started, Sherlock is gone, leaving John alone in the kitchen, his hands clutching at the countertop, gooseflesh all down his right side and his cock throbbing and hard in his trousers.
John is straight, after all, and certainly not attracted to his (amazing, gorgeous, dazzling) flatmate. He's definitely not considering sliding a little closer to Sherlock on the cab seat so that their thighs will touch. Not even for a second. He's not filled with anticipation, excited by the possibility of contact, thrilled by the knowledge that Sherlock would not pull away.
Being around Sherlock throws him off-balance. The protective instinct he’s always had toward the man has evolved into something more, much more, but it’s obvious that John is nothing more to Sherlock than a hired gun without the pay, a sounding board for his deductions, comfort and tea and convenience and... property.
Sherlock was incapable of speech as John wrapped his fingers around his shaft in an overhand grip and started slowly stroking him. Sherlock's hips automatically started to thrust, instinctively seeking more friction, more
Sherlock slowly pulled back, then thrust forward, filling John, staring at his face to watch the flickering pain/pleasure playing out on his expressive features.
John imagines Sherlock slowly stroking his cock, his other hand roaming slowly over his torso, up his chest, tweaking a nipple a little more roughly than John would do to himself. He imagines Sherlock jerking his dick more roughly than John does to himself too. Somehow it seems right. The expression on imaginary-Sherlock's face is very right, quietly delighted, the way he looks when he knows something Lestrade doesn't. The way he looks when John exceeds his expectations. The way he looked at John over the body at that crime scene, earlier.
John cuts off Sherlock’s explanation with another long, thorough, unhurried kiss, a smile on his face.
Sherlock glances at John for a moment like he’s about to speak, then shakes his head and returns his attention to his mobile. John is too busy clenching his jaw and staring out the cab window to notice anyway.
The intubation stayed in place for the first day. John's first words to Sherlock after the initial joy of reunion were spelt out by painstakingly writing the individual letters on the palm of Sherlock's hand with a shaking fingertip.
get turned, though," John admits. He smiles a little, a teasing tone to his voice as he continues, "I'm surprised you hadn't noticed, brilliant detective like you."
"I can't see anyone getting through to a man that stubborn," Mara said. "Whoever it is, I wish them luck."
"I'm not some blushing virgin, John. The fact that I don't generally indulge in sex doesn't mean I haven't."
Sherlock reached for John, his fingers running through his hair, pushing it back from his forehead. John looked up at Sherlock as he slowly stretched the waistband of the shorts out, over, down and off, grinning as Sherlock half-helped, half-hindered, his long, usually-graceful legs ungainly in that situation. Sherlock's heart pounded double-time as the cool bedroom air hit the superheated skin of his eager cock. John looked down at it and licked his lips, and Sherlock had to shove the heel of his left hand into his mouth to keep from begging.
"Quite all right," Sherlock said, similarly out of breath. He licked his lips reflexively, his gaze trained on John's mouth.
"You were dressing to the right as usual when you left the house," Sherlock says, nodding toward John's groin. "You're more to the left now. That doesn't generally happen when you visit the gents', which means an outside influence caused it. He
Mara shivered, finding herself on a cold, darkened London street. She took a moment to get her bearings, the misty rain starting to soak her light jacket. She scurried into a doorway to take shelter and saw two figures run past, one tall and in a long coat, one shorter and carrying a gun.
"Sherlock," John says, pinching the bridge of his nose and breathing out very slowly, his face heating as he refuses to ask just why Sherlock has apparently been paying so much attention to his groin. "Enough."
Before he’s really aware of what he’s doing, John is sliding down the bed, dragging his lips down Sherlock’s pale chest and abdomen. Sherlock gasps noisily and starts to protest, but that’s when John’s lips reach his dick. He presses a gentle, almost chaste kiss to the underside of the head and all objections die on Sherlock’s lips.
He heard John’s sharp intake of breath and paused for a moment before looking at him. John’s expression was unreadable, his face closed-off.
"Are you going to take me home, then?" Sherlock said, smoothing his hands down the front of John's shirt.
"That's exactly the way I thought you meant, actually," John says, frowning deeply. "I thought we were a team. I thought... I don't know what I thought anymore."
"Oh John," Sherlock said with a small, dirty smile, grinding his hips against John's as he shrugged out of his ruined shirt. "You got some things about me so... very... wrong. As ever, you see but do not observe."
"John, you're being deliberately difficult now. If I wanted ridiculous histrionics, I’d be chasing women," Sherlock sniffs. "I thought you were better than this."
"Right. Okay. But even before your big disappearing act, before we... slept together... You took a case and it was like you went off me completely. You went cold."
"There aren't any words for the ache inside, mourning the loss of even the possibility of something more with you. For the absolute emotional devastation of knowing that even if I could come back to you, you might not want to know me anymore."
Gabe’s hand has strayed down to John’s crotch, gently exploring the hard cock it’s encountered there. He pulls back slightly and takes John’s lips again, kissing him breathless until John pulls away with a quiet groan.
Sherlock's hands were in his own hair, fists gripping and pulling as his body writhed. John looked up at Sherlock as he licked a long stripe up the underside of Sherlock's still-hard cock.
"I'm using your fleshlight again. It's a wonderful little contraption, isn't it?" Sherlock murmurs, clearly fascinated with John's sex toy. "The vacuum effect is really something else..."
John moved stiffly back to the bed, pausing on his way to move the visitor chair closer. He slowly got back into the bed without looking at Sherlock again.
John froze, looking up at Sherlock, a frown creasing his brow in a way Sherlock found endearing, despite his desperate frustration and need.
Sherlock doesn't mention it again for a few days. Things have mercifully gone back to the way they were, with Sherlock silently observing John a lot of the time, but making no sexual overtures whatsoever.
Sherlock shivered and cursed the thoroughness of Onira-Tech's device and its nervous system feedback.
John is shaking as he berates Sherlock. Sherlock watches him with a confused look on his face, clearly not knowing how to react to the situation.
when he wants to be, but when it no longer suits his purposes to be so, he can turn it off in an instant. For a bloke he's quite attractive, with high cheekbones and a tall, slim body. And those eyes. They're engaging. He can see why Molly is so smitten with him, why practically everyone Sherlock comes into contact with seems to fall under his spell.
" John hisses, flicking his eyes to the closed door, not really believing what he's saying even as he says it.
Sherlock proceeds to detail all the things John missed in his examination of the body, and a few John couldn’t possibly have known besides. John hangs back for the rest of the half-hour they spend at the crime scene, and they don’t speak again until they’re in the cab, on the way home.
"It's all right, John, you're all right," Sherlock breathed as he rolled his hips, very slowly, incrementally pushing further inside. "You're so tight for me, John. So tight I can barely stay inside you. So hot for me, so
John returns home after a long, boring day of Locum work at the Practice to find a lanky, self-styled sociopath languishing on the sofa, shirtless. He pushes down the unexplained butterflies in his stomach and pauses just inside the sitting room doorway, looking at Sherlock's back, which is turned toward the door. He tries not to focus on the way his thin pyjama bottoms barely cling to his skinny, pale hips.
," Sherlock makes a frustrated, expansive gesture which John supposes is meant to encompass the whole awkward current situation.
Sherlock gapes for a moment, then stammers out, "But... you don't date men! Not once, in our acquaintance, have I known you to pursue a man."
Sherlock shuffles up and reaches across to the bedside table to pick up a pump bottle of lube which wasn’t there when John went to bed. John is too distracted to notice this, however, because Sherlock’s cock is busy waving itself enticingly in his face as he straddles his tummy. He lifts his head, trying to lick it, but he can’t quite reach. Sherlock pumps lube into the palm of his hand, drops the lube carelessly off the side of the bed, then reaches behind himself and takes hold of John’s cock, stroking slickness onto his shaft.
"I want whatever you want," Sherlock breathed, then licked the side of John's neck, groaning at the taste of his skin.
"I can't, I have to work," she found herself saying, wondering even as the words were leaving her lips why she was bothering to apologise to a simulated man.
"God, no," John groaned as Sherlock dipped his head to lick at the skin exposed by his hand dragging John's zip slowly down.
Their attraction to one other was undeniable, but would John want anything with Sherlock like he'd had in that perfect world?
when you're bored. I'm not a plaything. I'm your friend. You seem to have forgotten that," John says, frowning at Sherlock's silence.
He was trying for 'commanding' but it came out as needy. Scared. It made John want to destroy him, want to shatter him apart with pleasure. Keep rubbing and rubbing until Sherlock came with his cock untouched, writhing and fucking himself on John's fingers.
"So, I know how this works. The snipers were taken from the blog entry on the pool, the rest could be extrapolated from news sources," John said. "This is all very clever. Onira-Tech have really done their research."
Sherlock gave the doctor a withering look but said nothing. He heard Mycroft cough politely over his shoulder.
Sherlock grunted quietly in response, still panting, then laughed softly. John buried his grin against the inside of Sherlock's thigh, hiding it with a soft kiss.
Yet? John mentally chides himself. Talk about putting the horse before the cart. He's not even sure he wants that with Sherlock.
Sherlock licked his lips quickly, his eyes lingering on John's toned torso, then shook his head once. John's eyes narrowed as he looked at Sherlock's face, really looked. Sherlock felt more than a little flayed open by John's examination of him. The thought passed through his mind that this must be how others feel when he observes them. He allowed the scrutiny, wanting John to see it all.
He wants Sherlock in every way imaginable, and he's sure Sherlock could come up with a few ways beyond that.
He suspected that Mycroft viewed it as a sort of 'gap year', thinking Sherlock was having a whale of a time, travelling the world, plucking down the strands of Moriarty's web. The truth was far more lonely and less glamorous. He couldn't count the number of times he'd almost caved and contacted John over the eighteen months he'd been away. The only thing that had stopped him was Mycroft's assurance that John would be looked after.
"I'm not a bloody invalid," John said lightly. "I'm capable of spreading jam on toast. Plus I've never actually seen you cook anything and the very idea is mildly terrifying."
"You- what?" John blurts out, his brow creasing, cup of tea paused and forgotten, halfway to his mouth.
Sherlock pauses, trying to get his cracking voice under control, scrubbing one hand through his hair. He finally looks at John.
"Then I’m sure he’ll be home soon," Mycroft says with finality, as though he's just solved the problem.
Sherlock's hands moved to John's hips, taking hold, thrusting deeper, still slowly. John whimpered as he blindly covered Sherlock's hands with his own, his eyes squeezed closed, his angry-hard cock forgotten for the moment, leaking on his flat tummy.
Sherlock smiles, a wicked, delighted little smile and John can hear it over the miles between them, he can almost see it.
John flattens his tongue against the underside of Sherlock's dick and takes him deeper. Sherlock tastes salty and a little sour on his tongue. John had expected the taste to be a turn-off, but the texture of the velvety head against his tongue combines with the taste, makes him feel lightheaded and makes his mouth water even more. The smell of Sherlock’s sex fills his nostrils as he breathes in through his nose. John doesn’t mean to, but he groans loudly around his mouthful as he takes Sherlock cautiously deeper still.
He turns his head to the side and catches a whiff of the scent of Sherlock's hair. The smell of the man jerks something inside him with a strong sense of longing. He wishes Sherlock was still with him and wonders where he might be. He catches himself thinking this and frowns at himself.
John watched Sherlock through half-lidded eyes as his fingertips trailed over his arse cheek. Sherlock paused, speechless and mesmerised, watching John. John rubbed two fingertips against his perineum, then started trailing slowly down.
Sherlock looked down at John helplessly. He was shaking like a leaf; his teeth chattering, his hair almost as wild as his eyes. He grabbed at the pillow with both hands, white-knuckled, almost folding it around his head.
Sherlock looked at John, taking in his tense posture, his jiggling right knee. He hesitated for a moment before moving to the chair.
"Don't be like that, John," Sherlock murmurs, then he pulls his thin inside-out t-shirt up and over his head, dropping it on John's bedroom floor. He looks down, a slight smile quirking his lips as John looks him up and down, taking in the expanse of pale skin over toned but lean muscles. His eyes rest on Sherlock's own trouser-tent.
He moves to the wall his bedroom shares with the bathroom and presses his ear against it, listening intently as he resumes stroking his cock, faster than before. All he can hear is laboured breathing and the occasional moan, echoing around the tiled walls and floor in the next room. Sherlock would have to know John could hear him from his bedroom. He’s probably done experiments with decibel meters and calculated the exact volume he’d need to achieve to be heard, or something equally ridiculous.
This was his fault. He should have been more careful, taken the boy to some seedy hotel before telling him. He should have made sure that the boy was safe.
"Sorry, that was Mum. I've uh- I've got to go. My brother came by for a visit and I need to pick him up at the airport." Greg rolled his eyes, catching the confusion on Sherlock's face.
“God I love you.” He whispered, grinning as Sherlock whimpered and kissed him, sucking on his bottom lip gently.
His knees hit the deck as a harsh note pierced his skull, pulling a scream from his throat and filling his body with pain.
“I figured it would work if I put the ingredients into a bullet. The spark from the firing pin ignites the spell, by the time it reaches its destination the spell is activated.” John felt a blush creeping over his cheeks as Sherlock listened to him.
John whimpered when Sherlock started moving, the song still making his Life Force sing and enhancing every sensation. He sobbed at the overwhelming electricity that lanced along his spine when Sherlock found his prostate.
The sounds that fell from Sherlock's mouth were against his control, short whimpers and cries as John's length repeatedly brushed against his prostate.
“John! Thank heavens! You were a doctor in the army, correct?” John felt his throat close in fear at those words. Sherlock sounded strained and breathless.
"The boy who has it is in danger and I need to find him. He needs medical attention and protection-"
"His name is Greg, and don't you dare finish that sentence." Sherlock laughed and hurried into his brother's old room, digging through the drawers until he found a shirt that would still fit his brother. He made his way back into his room and threw the shirt at Mycroft.
John broke the kiss after a few moments, keeping Sherlock pinned to the wall with a hand on his chest.
Sherlock prepared him as thoroughly and as quickly as he could, and John loved every second of it. Sherlock’s bony fingers were long enough to reach his prostate with ease, gently teasing over the bundle of nerves until John was trembling beneath him.
“Please stop. Y-You’re dead, you’re not real.” He felt a cool hand on his cheek and looked up to see the ghost of his friend kneeling before him, his pale eyes searching John’s face. “I-I’m so sorry Sherlock.” He whispered, deciding to lose himself in his insanity.
“Please, just let us go. I’m not causing any harm, and I haven’t returned to your precious kingdom since you banished me. Please Mycroft, no rules have been broken-”
Fate was lying on the ground writhing in pain as she clutched her chest. The air was crackling with a red energy and Sherlock could feel a dreadfully familiar presence. John still stood where Sherlock had been thrown from, his gun now aimed at a different corner of the room. Sherlock glanced back at Fate and noticed the wound in her chest. That wasn’t right, John’s gun shouldn’t have done more than knock her back slightly.
"He can't speak to you like that." John pulled him away, leading him down the hall and into the bathroom. "John-"
"I'm the Captain here, and you are my prisoner. I will go at my own pace, and you will love every. Fucking. Second. Understand?" Sherlock whimpered and nodded, the tension in his body falling away as John released his hair. "Perfect." John pulled Sherlock's hips forward and pushed the younger man's upper body back against the desk.
Sherlock pushed the horse more than he probably should have, but Redbeard was a powerful beast and never hesitated under Sherlock’s panic. He allowed himself to be carried through the unfamiliar forest, uncaring if he got lost. He was aware of how to survive in the wild.
He had almost forgotten how good the other man was at kissing. He was just about to lose himself in the feel of Sherlock when his mind was snapped back to reality as his fingers caught on the bandages covering the pale, broken ribs. He forced Sherlock off him, holding him at arms length while he fought to catch his breath.
He climbed back on Redbeard and steered the animal down the new trail, keeping the pace at a gentle walk. His wrist ached worse than any pain he could remember, he was certain he had broken it.
He was changing back into his street clothes when he caught sight of Sherlock in the mirror behind him. He quickly did up his trousers, blushing deeply and grabbing for his shirt.
Sherlock was forced to spend the next three days trapped in his room, only allowed to leave the bed to use the bathroom. John never stayed for long when he would check in on him, only long enough to ask how he was feeling and if he needed anything.
“He’ll kill you?” Sherlock shook his head, leaning back and resting against the edge of the boat, looking incredibly tired.
“Oh, I don’t want anything. I’m just here for the human.” Sherlock felt his stomach tighten. He felt something connect with his side, his body getting thrown across the room where it connected violently with the wall. Someone was screaming, but Sherlock couldn’t focus. His head had struck the wall, leaving him dizzy and in pain. As the fog cleared, Sherlock became aware of the screaming again. He looked back to see chaos where he had once stood.
“I-I- I apologize for my behaviour, Captain Watson.” Sherlock seemed to stumble over his words, looking incredibly embarrassed. John smirked and shook his head, reaching his hand out towards the taller man.
"Hmm, Sherlock, I like that." The boy flashed him a grin, one that made him look much younger than it should have, and leaned in close, not touching, but effectively pinning the detective to the cold brick. "What do you want, Sherlock? Name it and I'll give you a price-"
"I know babe, I missed you too. But hey, how about I pick you up tomorrow when you get back and we'll go get milkshakes or something? Sound good?" Sherlock smiled sadly and nodded, kissing his boyfriend again. "Oh, I almost forgot!" John reached for something in his back pocket, revealing a bouquet of something that resembled balls of aluminium foil. "Chocolate roses. I know you aren't really a fan of actual flowers, and I know how much you love chocolate." Sherlock blushed and took the sweets, grinning at the shorter boy.
“Ow! Damnit Molly Hooper!” Sherlock shouted, whipping off the sofa and tripping, falling unceremoniously to the floor. The medical training in John kicked in and he leapt to Sherlock’s aid, gripping his arm and pulling the mass of limbs and curls up. The lanky man stood, looking pissed and furiously straightening his dressing gown. He glared over John’s head at Molly, pushing John out of the way and stalking over to the mousy girl. “What the fuck?”
"It's uh, it's fine." John felt his own face darken and rubbed the back of his neck, offering Sherlock a shy, lopsided grin as the boy started walking away. His eyes wandered down to the boy's arse before he could stop them, and he rubbed his face with his hands, sighing heavily.
“My Grandfather. He raised me and my sister after my Dad died. He had retired long before they started teaching the automatic method, so I learned the manual way.”
“John! Stop, please!” Sherlock’s voice echoed through the empty hall, breaking John’s heart as he walked away.
“Yes Love. Just stay there Sherlock, in your condition, you won’t be able to open the door.” Lestrade and Mycroft left, leaving Sherlock alone, bleeding, and terrified.
“You know. I never thought he would do it.” A soft voice cut through the fog that had taken over Sherlock’s mind. He spun around, hunting for the source of the voice.
John sighed into the kiss as Sherlock ran his fingers along his thighs and sides. He pressed closer and moved his own hands over the Siren’s exposed chest. He loved it when Sherlock stayed in this form, human clothing irritated his skin and scales so he never wore a shirt.
“My brother’s soul was compressed into nothingness by Moriarty’s song. His lungs were destroyed when the blade pierced his chest, and his brain was deprived of oxygen for far too long. Sherlock’s body my still live, but his mind is gone.” A crushing weight settled on his heart for the first time since his men had found Sherlock and John, bloody on the floor of The Spider’s ship. “Sherlock is dead.” He whispered, feeling a sob catch in his throat.
The pale man was grinning wildly, his eyes glinting with mischief. It had been a week since they had first kissed and Sherlock enjoyed surprising John with the touches.
“As far as I can tell yes. Chemistry was never really my strong suit so I don’t really know how to test the samples.”
They were still for a while once he was fully seated, Sherlock's breathing going from erratic to slightly faster than normal. John leaned in closer, his erection brushing against Sherlock's prostate and making the younger boy's vision flash with stars. John's forehead rested against Sherlock's, their breath mingling as his hips started moving.
“Well, I guess we have a few hours to kill. Why don’t you turn back to human and I’ll show you around a bit?” Sherlock shrugged, once again starting his song and shifting back into human form.
"I'm late for practice." This time, John let him go. He didn't look behind him as he hurried away, fighting back the tears of guilt that tried to fall.
“Sherlock Holmes is a brilliant, level-headed young man, and I’m almost certain he has feelings for you too.”
Moriarty walked ever closer, each step he took sending a spark of fear along Sherlock’s spine. He tried to escape, but Moran pinned him in place with a strong hand. Moriarty stopped inches in front of Sherlock, his eyes dark and his grin darker.
"I looked for you, once I was old enough to leave the Court. No one had seen you in years at that point. Then one day, I was prepping to set sail when one of my ships was attacked. Only one survivor, and all he would say was 'three days. Brig. John Watson.'" John felt a flare of guilt. He remembered that boy, the one his former Captain had locked in the Brig and allowed his crew to rape him brutally.
John’s scream of agony drew Sherlock’s attention from his thoughts. He raced towards his friend, stumbling as he was struck with the force of static energy that was being forced through John’s compact body.
"I did! You both were amazing! I'm so proud of you Darling." John grinned at his sister, ruffling her hair and laughing as she swatted his hand away.
A high-pitched whine escaped Sherlock as one of John's fingers pressed into him. There wasn't nearly enough lubrication, and it burned to the point of discomfort. He shook his head, squirming slightly.
"Come with us and I'll stop." Sherlock sighed heavily, glancing at Mrs. Watson timidly while trying to wriggle out of Harry's grasp.
Sherlock watched John walk away, wishing he knew how to save his friend. He followed a fair distance behind John, trying to figure out the right words. There were none.
"I didn't do that. I saved him, staged a whole mutiny to get him out." Sherlock nodded, still barely moving. "I had the entire crew overhauled, killed anyone that agreed with his ways. That's when I became Captain. I had the boy returned to the Courts, made sure he well enough to survive the trip." John released Sherlock's elbow, stepping back and giving the other man some space. "Did he live? The boy?"
“Of course, I didn’t, don’t be absurd Brother Mine. I have however, seen some of the infamous Captain Watson’s videos. You are quite the presence onscreen Captain.” The other man stepped closer to John, causing the shorter man to back away. He backed into Sherlock, who pulled him close and all but growled at his brother.
“We did five videos together, Moriarty’s fans really enjoyed watching him tear me apart. The videos started off boring enough, just some simple BDSM and rough play. Nothing I hadn’t done before.” John reached back and grabbed Sherlock’s expensive massage oil, needing to distract himself from what he knew was coming. “It took us almost six months to film all the videos, and by the end of it, I was so desperate for it to stop I tried to kill myself.”
“Very well. I will inform The Master that you are awake and have reopened your wounds. Would you like some tea?” Sherlock nodded timidly, hoping that whoever this Master was, he would take pity on him and just kill him. “I will send Mrs. Hudson up. Greg, with me please?”
“I don’t know.” His hands were shaking as he tried to take John’s pulse. There was none to take. Panic set in, blurring his vison and causing his chest to tighten. He had to calm down, John needed him to be calm.
John took care to angle his hips to ensure his brushed Sherlock's prostate with every pass, drawing the most delightful sounds out of the younger man. After a while, he let Sherlock's leg fall from his shoulder, slipping an arm under Sherlock's lower back and lifting him onto his lap, thrusting up into him with firm strokes.
"I can't tell you how many times I've had to patch up Harry's feet since she started dancing." John pulled the slippers off Sherlock's feet gently, taking care to not do more damage.
"Wait, what?" Sherlock flinched, and John realized how loud his voice was in the empty studio. "Sorry."
He screamed louder and started digging at his skull, trying to pull the sight from his brain. Something in the back corner of his mind told him to stop, that it was The Spider’s Song, but he couldn’t. He had to make it stop.
"I'm stuck." John let out a belt of laughter, quickly covering his mouth and dropping his head, trying to contain his amusement. "Well, I'm definitely not kissing you now." That only made John laugh harder, and he clutched his sides as he doubled over. "I'm glad my struggles are amusing to you."
"Hey Watson, do you know who that kid is under the bleachers? He's been there since practice started." Greg asked, nodding over to the bleachers. John couldn't help grinning when he caught sight of the boy hiding under the stands.
“A five year contract.” John felt his blood run cold. “You will work for my company for five years, let us schedule your films, who you star with etcetera. You will get paid a minimum £600 per video to start, with the amount to be re-negotiated once every six months.”
"Tell your Captain I wish to speak to him, if you have the brain cells left to do so." John smirked, stepping closer to the young man and signalling for his crew to cut him down.
“I saw how much my still working was hurting you, and I hated knowing that I was upsetting you. I knew I was losing you, and the thought of that was more than I could bear.” John grabbed Sherlock’s perfect shirt and pulled him in for a deep kiss. When he finally let the taller man go, they were both flushed, breathless, and undeniably aroused. “Please don’t sign the contract John. I don’t care if you want to keep working, I can handle that, just please don’t sign the contract. The thought of you being under my brother’s thumb makes me sick.” John nodded, kissing Sherlock again.
Sherlock caught his eyes and grinned, a danger in his smile that sent a shock of arousal through John’s body. Sherlock drifted closer resting his arms on the edge of the boat and leaning close to John, brushing his nose along John’s neck.
John set Sherlock down on the bench just outside the studio and set about cleaning and re-wrapping Sherlock's feet.
“No, Mrs. Hudson! Come back- you can’t-” Sherlock pulled his blanket up to his face, biting on the soft cloth to try to hide the giggle that threatened to escape. He heard the beast sigh heavily, a soft growl rumbling through the room. “Damn it.”
“Moriarty.” Sherlock forced himself to his feet, finally catching sight of his old nemesis. Moriarty was propped against the doorway, picking at his fingernails with an evil smirk on his face.
“Actually, we’re about three hours out. We can meet up for dinner and you can collect the samples in person.” John could see the glee in his friend’s face and laughed.
“Tsk, tsk, that was a little rude. I just want to know what happened Darling.” Moriarty roughly ground his knuckle into the largest of the gashes, pulling a tortured scream from Sherlock. “Where have you been Sweetheart? Tell me, and I’ll make the pain stop. It will all go away if you tell me where you went.”
John felt the pain in his claws as he struggled to maintain his grip on the crumbling castle. Moriarty stood above him, that unnerving grin on his face as he watched John struggle.
“It’s part of the curse. Every day, a part of the castle falls, my staff becomes less human, and I get closer to damnation.”
“Stand still, I’ll make it relatively quick.” Moriarty growled as he chased John, swinging the blade after the Beast. John felt the castle crumble beneath his feet, the stone path he was standing on falling away. He cried out as he fell, scrabbling for purchase as he slid down the roof of one of the towers. “Come on John! Don’t be scared! This is what Sherlock wants!”
“Nah, but I’ve heard him wailing as I-” The Spider cut off John’s words with a harsh jab to the jaw. The doctor laughed again, rolling his jaw and wincing as he felt the wounds on his scalp tear. “What’s wrong? Jealous because I didn’t have to take what I wanted from him?”
"John, I literally live in my own filth and neglect personal hygiene in favour of playing with dead things. I am the furthest thing from posh."
“Are you okay Mouse?” She nodded, not taking her eyes off the new man. John turned back to the new man, hoping to figure out what was going on. “So, let me get this straight, you are Father Time?”
He clambered onto the animal, kicking it into action as he galloped through town, ignoring the curses and cries of the people.
"So? We can be fast." John pushed at Sherlock's shoulders, wriggling out from under the skinny boy and shifting so he was resting between his legs. "Christ Babe, your legs just never end, do they?" Sherlock blushed and covered his face, clearly self-conscious. John pulled his hands away and pressed a firm kiss to his lips, smirking as the boy sighed softly. "Don't be shy Love, I love your long-ass legs." Sherlock's blush deepened and John leaned down, pushing the sweater out of the way to suck at his collarbone. "I love everything about you." He mumbled against the skin of Sherlock's neck as he started tugging at the other boy's sweater.
It had been many years since they had last kissed, but it felt as though nothing had changed. This kiss was softer than their first, but it was equally as dizzying. When they broke the kiss, they were both breathless. John rested his head against Sherlock’s chest and giggled, feeling the taller man laugh along with him.
The cabin was small, but it was so full of memories that John felt his heart swell almost painfully as he and Sherlock made their way up the walkway.
“My Father.” John eventually whispered, his voice cracking and tears falling from his eyes. “He uh, he beat my mother to death when I was seventeen. Went after my little sister next.” John sniffled, wiping his eyes.
He looked at his hands, the hands that fought through the war, stitched together the wounds of so many men and women. He breathed a sigh of relief when his fangs no longer caught on his lips when he grinned. He ran his hands through his hair, reveling in the shortness of it. He looked around for Mary, but she was gone.
“When you reach E2, I know.” John’s heart broke for his friend, but he wasn’t going to change his mind. There was no way he would survive this trip, not with his hands in the shape they were. Mikey knew it, he knew that even if John wasn’t leaving to find his death, he wouldn’t make it through another energy storm. “What if I come with you? I-I’ll- I’ll do the busy work on the ship. You won’t even know I’m there.”
Victor never laughed at anything he said, at least nothing he was supposed to laugh at. He never had an issue laughing at Sherlock when he told him he loved him.
“We need to get you back to bed-” Sherlock grabbed his face with more strength than he should have had, and pulled him up for a kiss.
“Sorry? You ignore me for a fucking week and all you have to say is sorry?” John stepped closer to the man, feeling his heart break ever so slightly when the ghost stepped back, keeping an even distance between them.
“It uh- it means a date. Mikey and I served together, went on leave to S13 a few times. He was feeling down, I took him out, made sure he felt better by the end of leave.” John tried to hide his face from Sherlock, hoping the Siren wouldn’t figure out what he meant by that. There was a long silence and John felt as though he had successfully evaded any questions.
“Don’t you stress yourself Dear, have some tea.” The teacup slid forward, coming to rest by his hand. He flinched, scared to touch the delicate china.
“I’m sure John would disagree.” Sherlock hadn’t meant to sound bitter, but he heard the harsh edge to his words and saw the way Mike’s expression changed. “My apologies, I’m just tired from the trip.”
“I had to. Fate was killing you and the only way she would let you live was if I left. You weren’t supposed to remember me.”
"Hello to you too Sherlock. Which case? There are about two hundred open trafficking cases in London-"
They left Sherlock's house, John opening the door of his mother's car for his date before climbing in the driver's seat.
"No need to be so formal Baby, you can call me Johnny, or whatever you damned well please." Sherlock backed away as the boy stepped closer, trying to find a way out of this situation. "What do you want me to call you? Sir? Daddy-"
"Get fucked Anderson." Gavin snapped, gripping Sherlock's elbow and hauling him closer, stepping in front of him and challenging Anderson. "Sherlock Holmes is a friend of ours, and if anyone so much as looks at him wrong, they'll have us to answer to. Got it?" Anderson growled but nodded, glaring at Sherlock as he stormed away. "Mikey, make sure Sherlock gets to class okay." Sherlock flinched when he felt a hand grip his shoulder, but let himself be led down the hall.
“John can’t hear you Sherlock. You’re dead.” A spark of realization hit Sherlock as the voice became clearer.
He ran to the stables, grabbing Redbeard’s halter and dragging the horse out of his stable. He used the fence of one of the stable doors to propel himself onto Redbeard’s back, far too lost in his panic to care about a saddle.
