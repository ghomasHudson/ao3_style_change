But it’s not.  Everything is different.
“I wish I had a light to show you, Cas,” Dean says, and he can feel tears threatening.  Doesn’t care.  “If I had Grace to give you, you’d have it.”  He says it without thinking, feeling it in his bones, down to his soul if he has such a thing. Then he realizes how offensive, how presumptive it was to say.  “I’m sorry, Cas, I can’t possibly know—”
them?”
The world, shitty and cold and horrible, is clear now. It’s been so long since he saw it clearly.
Cas feels his jaw clench at Dean’s tone and allows himself the arch of an eyebrow in annoyance, but nothing more.  It’s obvious Dean’s on edge, and confronting him about small things, no matter how irritating, isn’t going to improve the situation.
“Yeah,” Jesse tells him.  “I come this way for work, I can drop you off in the morning, or if you need to head out beforehand, I can get you an uber or something.”
Cas nods, wide-eyed.  “Yes.  Dean, you must know how I feel.  It’s only…I don’t have any right to keep you—“
It’s not that Cas doubts it.  Not really.  But he’d needed this.  How does Dean always know when he really
Dean has blossomed in the time since.  He’s become a member of their neighborhood.  He greets Mrs. Zullo on her way to the mailbox, and Ms. Butler on her way to school.  He helps people change their spark plugs or their tires, tells the kids to put on their bike helmets.  He isn’t that terse, angry, suppressed twenty-five year old anymore.
“Yes.”
Dean grins.  “You’re the best studfinder ever.”
Cas licks Dean’s ear and is gratified when Dean stutters, then continues as Cas moves down the line of his jaw, his throat.
The ghost shrugs and seems to perch on the arm of the couch.  “Not that I know of.  I like it here.  I built this house.  I’d really prefer that everyone
“Thank you,” Cas says as he heads to the door.
“Ha!  I knew it!  You had a ringer!”
Cas smiles.  “Saving your life?”
“Let me know a fair price, I’m happy to pay you, though goodness knows the going rate these days.  You could look into it and let me know?”
Gabe’s voice is nasal and irritating, and irritated.
Cas laughs, relaxed, and Dean feels his shoulders drop as well.  “It must seem strange to you, now, but, yes, from Sears, and no, not Lincoln logs.  You’ll find it did prepare me well, however, for reading directions,” and he points out where Dean is about to attach the dormer out of order, and ruin any chances he has for getting the shingles in afterward.
It makes it hard to breathe, all this attention.  There’s not an inch of his body that isn’t sparks and electricity.  Dean’s hand has abandoned Cas’s and is now inching down his ribs, and if this follows previous experience, that hand is going to be sliding over his cock soon.
She laughs softly.  “Oh, I think that’s my line, isn’t it?  You parking out in front of my house and all?”
Cas reaches toward him and then draws back.  “I know.  It would be very enjoyable to see you again, Dean.  I know you must be very busy.  Work, and Sam and his family, all your friends. But I am eternally grateful for all the time you’ve been able to share with me.  It’s really felt…”  He trails off.  “It’s been very nice, Dean.  Whatever happens, however often you can stop by will be appreciated.  Truly.”
“I don’t like it, Sammy.  You’re one guy.  This is big.  This is really big and, man...I...I never thought I’d see you again.  I
Sam touches his shoulder and Dean moves forward and then Sam yanks him in and buries his face low in Dean’s neck.  Dean’s head turns into his chest, and it’s crystal clear that they’re brothers but so much more.
“Sam?”
And his heart breaks when he realizes it's just like it used to be, when Dean could only say ‘I love you’ by hanging on too tight.
“Ah, sweet!”  She peeks up over the door and grins.  “Orange, my favorite!”
“Yeah, we’d love to see you.  Stay for dinner?  We’ll make pie...”
“People change, Dean. I love you no matter what.”
Dean is staring into Cas’s eyes again, stroking his face in wonder, when a door slams and he’s jolted back into his body, back to the couch.  Cas looks equally shocked where he’s splayed against the arm of the couch next to Dean.
“Sammy,” Dean whispers, and then he hauls Sam’s head down abruptly until his mouth is against Sam’s ear.  “You better have a
Dean feels his body go limp, a new kind of release. He gives up the fight and resigns himself to more battles. Endless struggles against impossible forces, impossible odds.
Cas snorts as Dean marks off the first bracket, then the second.
“It’s so, so good to see you,” he says finally.  “Give me one minute…”  He fiddles with the machine.  It’s not something he can plug Common into and play Luminate back.  It requires knowing each of the words and meanings and structures, waveforms and color protocols.  But once he’s programmed it, he can recall previous iterations of the message.
“So,” Dean says, busying himself with his bag of tools.  “Did you need me to stain or poly or something?”  He looks over the boards again.
“Oh,” Cas says again, full of grey-blue wonder.  “I’m not...I’m not going too deep, am I?  I know your structure can…
He rolls his eyes.  “Not wanting to talk doesn’t mean I’m
to.”  Dean’s voice is brittle.  “I don’t
Charlie’s advice is useless, of course.  Cas can’t
“You know I can never remember all those quotes and things.”
The water starts running in the bathroom and Cas sits gingerly on the couch.  Remembers Sam sitting there, he and Dean wound up in each other, Cas on the couch arm, stroking Dean’s hair.  It had felt good, then.  The three of them.
Cas gets up and takes Dean by the arm.  “Dean.”
There’s nothing I want more than this.”
But Cas doesn’t care.  It feels good and he’s tired.
And then he topples forward into Cas’s arms.
If Cas could articulate anything in the moment, he might try to say something smart.  As it is, he just managed some sort of high pitched cross between a grunt and a whine.
“C’mon,” Dean says, pulling at Cas’s pants.  “Get your pj’s on and climb in for real.  We’re looking to get up at 6, swap plates at the Gas n’ Sip and then get on the road.”
“Here,” Cas offers quietly, and Dean takes the kit and rustles through it, pulling a penlight out and looking into their guest’s eyes.
“Oh, Cas.  Fuck.  You’re, ah, you’re speaking my language.”
“I shouldn’t have come here, Cas.  I’m sorry.” Sam says quietly.  “I knew Dean would help, I wanted to see him, but I should have found another way.”
“I look forward to it, Dean,” Cas tells him, and Dean tries not to grin like a fool as he heads out the door.
Charlie’s already texted they’re running a few minutes behind, so he meets Jesse at the bar and he actually asks about the guy this time, has a conversation, buys him a fancy microbrew and enjoys his wry sense of humor.
“Did you like it?” Cas asks as Dean strokes him, and he’s trying to listen but it’s so hard when Dean touches him like that.
“The raccoon baby.  The one in the attic.”
On day three, Dean stops by with a white chocolate latte, Cas’s favorite so far.  He takes the top off the cup and sets it under the tree he thinks of as theirs.  He’s planned things to say, but it’s hard to say them, so he just rambles quietly under his breath.  “I don’t know what they told you about people like me,” he starts out slowly, speaking low into the early morning light.  “Maybe that we’re broken or deviant or that...we hurt people.  And I don’t expect you to change your mind, you know?  I mean, can’t teach a dead dog new tricks, right?” He lets out one tiny whisper of a laugh and then chokes on it.
Cas admits to Dean that he's gay and that he suppressed that his whole life and now he wishes things were different.
And yet, his thoughts spin in his head, aimlessly, endlessly.
“Which is why he’s accepted that I’m going with you.”
Dean slings an arm around him as he gets up from checking the plug behind the nightstand.  “Ready to go?”
She reaches out to prod his upper arm experimentally, then gives him a coy look.  “A strapping young lad like yourself?  I’m sure I can think of something.”
Cas gets home just ahead of the storm, rain pelting the windows as he rushes inside.  “Hi, honey,” he yells.  “I’m here!”
methods of being nosy.
The angel hardly notices, his body crushing forward—his own enormous weight against the negligible resistance of Dean’s muscle and bone.
“Let’s do this, buddy. Let’s fuck ’em up.”
“Wonderful!  Come by Friday evening then, won’t you?  You still have the key?  Good, good.  I’ll leave instructions on the island and I’ll be back Sunday, but it might just be easier if you stay over Sunday night, as well.  I don’t know when I’ll be in.”
"Shotgun shuts his cakehole," Sam laughs.  "The more things change, huh?"
The man’s unkempt.  Dark hair in disarray, long trench coat and a dark suit underneath.  Fingers that move oddly—
“Well, she asked me to come along, she wanted to get a ‘vibe’ for the place, she said.”
he remembers Dean saying.
Sam looks down at his hands in sudden fascination.
Cas can feel eyes on him as he walks out.  They’re unusually silent and Cas tries not to take offense.  They seem irritatingly surprised by the fact that he has ideas and interests.
He watches her tail lights disappear and looks around once before stepping inside and shutting the door behind him.  “So weird,” he mutters.
He nods, trying not to look as excited and terrified as he feels.
“Fergus?”
He starts the impala up, chest heavy, and jumps when Cas speaks from the passenger seat.  “Dean.”
“Uh...thank you?”
The anticipation feels like it might kill him all on it’s own.  He gasps, shallow little breaths that get pushed back out with every new sensation.
“That we’re…”  Sam grimaces and scrubs his face with his hand in a familiar gesture, and Cas smiles briefly.   “We’re not the good guys, here.”
“My parents were very religious.  I was taught very young how
They don’t touch like this.  For Cas, it’s felt too fragile a thing to think about before they reach their destination.
Cas gives a tiny smile.  “Yes, your mind gives me form in a way the world can’t.”
“Oh, Dean, that smells amazing.  It must taste incredible.”
“I would be honored,” Cas says.  Despite his teasing smile, Dean believes him.
“Oh, I picked up dinner on the way over,” Dean says, heart rate picking up even as he keeps his voice nonchalant.  “I had a long day, I just wasn’t up to cooking.  You know how it is.”  He closes his eyes.  He keeps making the stupidest comments.  It’s like Cas brings out the dumbass in him.  “Probably not, huh?”
Dean grimaces.  “That's never good,” he says, but there’s no bite to it. It’s more...resigned.  "What’s up?”
“I’m sorry, Dean, I didn’t realize it was you or I wouldn’t have yelled.  This...whatever you brought smells truly divine.  My granddaughter used to make a latte with spices in it, it was very similar to this.  It’s wonderful, it reminds me of those happy times, when Alfie was small and the house was full of laughter.”
“Can we talk?”
Cas can’t look.  He starts the coffee and shakes his head.
His voice is soothing as he tells Dean about his siblings, his childhood.
Cas reaches out to touch his arm, smooth over his bicep, and Dean catches his hand like a lifeline, holding so tight it hurts.
Cas smiles at him and ducks his head.  “Yes, of course.  Thank you.”
“What can I get you?” she finally asks, lightening the mood.  She heads for the little kitchen and opens the fridge.
Sam seems to take that as a challenge and starts mouthing at Cas’s jaw, his neck, paying close attention to the dip just under his collar bone, one hand pressed hard at his hip.
Cas feels a curl of arousal sliding up his body.  He reaches out, one hand searching for Dean’s in the sheets, the other smoothing through Sam’s hair.  No pressure behind it.  He doesn’t want to pull him in.  He only wants what’s offered.
“Hello, Dean.”
“Dental floss,” Dean says, almost too low to hear.  “And rubbing alcohol.”
“Hey, Cas, what’s…”

, he doesn’t say.  “Closing in two weeks.  That’s super fast, Alfie will have a check in hand before next semester, no problem.”
He can hear Sam’s suspicion.  “Hey, Dean.  Good to hear from you.  What do you want?”
“Yes, of course.”
“And a good thing you
“She died when you were a baby?”  Dean had been vague about timelines and details, but Cas is piecing it together, now.
He clicks through the open tabs of the browser until he finds the article he’d found earlier in the day and reads under his breath, “
There’s a box in the depths of the bunker labeled “Christmas Decorations” that Sam doesn’t
“An excellent idea.”
“Good, thank you,” he stutters, suddenly nervous for no real reason. He catches Dean staring at his forearms.
Dean glances back down to her case and pulls his phone from his pocket. He taps into his Instagram account and easily finds the girl’s social media handle and follows her. “See ya tomorrow.”
There’s a crate in the bowels of the bunker labeled “The Nutcracker” and for all Dean’s off-color jokes about what could be inside, when the crate is finally opened, all that’s there is exactly what it says on the tin.It should have been a letdown but in actuality, it’s this beautiful solid wood, perfectly crafted traditional figure that makes its home on the bunker’s mantel.
"So… Did you? You know," Sam trails off with bouncing eyebrows, mimicking a cheesy approximation of bad porn music.
“Nah, he’s too busy serenading his new lady,” Dean admits. “Caught him with a second-hand guitar last week. You shoulda seen him. Turned redder than a tomato.”
Castiel and Dean beg off the couple’s offer to join them for dinner and instead make the journey back to their bus stop in silence. The bus pulls next to the glassed-in benches with a hiss of the breaks, and Castiel motions for Dean to get on ahead of him. They sit side-by-side near the back doors. The interior lights are blinding, and Dean leans his head against the glass, knocking his temple along with the cracks in the pavement. His mother’s guitar is wedged in the space between his knees. Dean lets out a long breath, fogging the glass and watching as the condensation recedes. Castiel reaches a hand to Dean’s knee and gives a tentative, gentle squeeze. Dean moves his hand from the curve of the guitar case to cover Castiel’s. They ride together until they reach the transit station where they met. Dean pulls the bright yellow cord for the stop and Castiel shifts beside him. He looks over, pivoting so that he can stay propped up and still see Cas.
Dean was of the impression that their first Christmas in the Bunker was cause for celebration. He had called every hunter in Bobby’s contacts and their own to Kansas to spend the holiday season underground.  He and Sam had laundered every bedspread and pillowcase, eagerly awaiting their guests’ arrival.
He once again begged off the question, and the pair spent another twenty minutes talking until Charlie hung up for baby Anson’s bedtime routine. He had opened his messaging app and tapped Dean’s name at the top of the list to type out an invitation.
On their way back, lunch in tow, they sidestep a young woman strumming a bright green ukulele, its small case set open in front of a slouchy backpack with patches sewn into it. It reminds Castiel of the quilt despite the lack of finesse. A small handwritten sign propped against the case asks for donations and gives a social media handle: @claireukes.  Anael digs into her Hermes coin purse and pulls out her phone and a few bills, depositing them into the guitar case and taking a quick video clip while the girl plays on with her eyes closed to the world around her. She hums counter to her strumming and Castiel finds himself smiling, remembering the man from the transit station with his rich voice and kind smile. He gives the girl the change from his lunch order and they carry on to the museum, humming the girl's song while they eat their cold cuts.
The air conditioning kicks off, and the room is suddenly silent. Sam taps his fork absentmindedly against the empty plastic container. Dean hides a grin. The beat belongs to a song they used to play together during warmups with their parents. Some old seventies tune that Dean hums along to openly. Sam uses his free hand to drum along the desktop and the pair's ramblings evolve into a full-on jam session, complete with air guitar provided by Dean, and an extended drum solo from Sam who trades his fork for two ballpoint pen drumsticks.
His morning tasks complete, Castiel sets about booting up his desktop and logging into the hard drive Charlie left him. He is grateful for her superior organizational methods, and quickly finds the project file for the upcoming music exhibit. He's lost in thought, jotting down potential ideas and doesn't hear the museum's preservationist enter the room.
At home, he finds Dean lounging on the large sofa, legs stretched out in front of him as he types a message on his cell phone.
He puts the candles into the frosting, carefully avoiding the lettering that spells out, “
once when he was twelve before he stated setting traps in the family home. His parents were shocked to say the least. They had no idea when Ed watched the film – they thought it was too violent.
“When we first met, I gave you the change from my coffee and you smiled at me. I went to work that first day and managed to review all of Charlie’s notes on the exhibit which I found daunting, until that point. Every day, I dropped my change, you smiled, and I got more work done than I had in a month.
Dean is thrilled for him; Castiel has been trying to secure the band for the exhibit for a month, never able to pin them down to a specific date or time. He knows from spending any amount of time with Charlie, that Moondoor was the biggest inspiration for pulling the museum’s instrument collection into an exhibit. Castiel had gushed to Dean that he secretly hoped the band would agree to play as a surprise for Charlie on opening night. Dean may have contacted them outside of Castiel’s official correspondence, admitting to knowing Maggie Zeddmore from a street they played in Wisconsin before she moved back to California to start the band with her brother. He’s happy to know his little push helped sway them to Castiel’s cause.
“Thank you all so much for taking the time to come out tonight. It’s been a pleasure seeing you interact with the exhibit. I want to give a special shout out to Castiel Novak for his work on the Bards and Buskers section, and to Dean Winchester for his help gathering the talent for tonight’s opening. Before we let you go for the evening, we would like to announce that the Board of Directors has approved funding for a summer program we’re calling The Bard’s College.” A murmur runs through the crowd and Castiel reaches beneath the table to take Dean’s hand in his as Charlie continues.
“Then you wrote me a song, that next week. That one about the bees? It was for me, right?” Dean nods his head sheepishly and he continues, “I thought so. Did you know I invited a coworker to lunch that day? I haven’t eaten outside of the museum with anyone but Charlie in
Lisa Braeden was a woman Dean had met on his way through Cicero, Indiana twelve years before. She was a yoga instructor, beautiful, and made a habit of hanging out where he played at the edge of the Gas ‘n Sip parking lot. He stayed the entire summer. It’s still the longest he’s ever spent in one place. Sometime in late August, she came banging on his motel door in tears and confessed that she was pregnant.  He was willing to stick around, do the right thing, but the timing was all wrong. She’d been with a long haul trucker the month before Dean rolled into town, and she was certain it was his baby. She called the other man and he was on his way and she couldn’t see Dean anymore. He checked out of the motel the next morning with a broken heart and hadn’t spoken to her since. He thought about the kid all the time though, wondered what it might be like to start that apple pie life someday.
“Damn it, Ed! Keep it down. We’re not supposed to know him, remember?”
"How was the station?"
Castiel is supposed to be cleaning the chimney, not in anticipation of Santa, but because he'd noticed a slight burning smell the last time it was lit and put the task on his self-imposed Honey-Do List. The colloquialism makes him smile, thinking of the bees that helped heal his mind.
It’s perfect.
“Oh, no.  I wouldn't want to interfere with your interviews.”
Finally, after re-reading the same three sentences for the eighth time, he closes the file, pushes himself to standing, and drops down on the other side of the couch, jostling Dean and interrupting the song mid-chord. Dean shoots him an affronted glare.
from the side table, flicking on the lamplight and opening to the earmarked page. At the close of each chapter, Dean peeked at Castiel: watched him nap for a bit, then wake himself up snoring, then sipping his cooled tea. Sometime between chapters eight and nine, he got up to use the bathroom and stumbled back into the living room to sit upright on the couch. Dean marked his page and got up to start dinner.
Charlie Bradbury had told him excitedly two weeks ago that she and her partner, Gilda, had finally received the green light from their adoption agency and would be bringing home the little boy they had fallen in love with months before. Castiel had been positively thrilled for his best friend and her growing family and eagerly accepted her workload as she prepared for life as a new mom. While she’s left him with plenty of planning and implementation time, the exhibit's subject matter itself is one in which he has no real interest: musical history.  He needs to put together something to tie her research into the community - a requirement of all the museum's exhibitions, but he keeps coming up dry. The topic so far only brings to mind his brother, Gabriel’s off-key singing on Sunday mornings growing up.
“Dean and I,” he corrects, then adds, “but you’re more than welcome to come.”
Dean uncaps the bottle and takes a drink. He doesn't want to tell Sam about Blue Eyes, and he really doesn't want to admit to spending the last six or so hours crafting his best work to date. It's strange how easily the man has gotten under Dean's skin.
He raises a brow, but strips down to his boxers, blushing when Dean lets out a whistle of appreciation from the bed. He avoids looking back, instead carefully pulling the tags from the sweater and putting on the outfit Dean’s picked out for him. When he does turn, Dean is sitting up on the end of the bed, leaning back on his hands with bright, loving eyes. He figures he’ll wear anything Dean wants if it gets him a look like that.
“You were definitely humming,” she replies, leaving no room for argument.
“Well, of course, he doesn’t
He spends the walk from the coffee shop to the transit station rehearsing what he’ll say to the flannel-clad man, suddenly more nervous than excited. The crowd at the platform does not part for him, but he still catches a quick glimpse of eyes he knows are green in the distance. As he approaches, the song the man plays wafts out to meet him, and it is beautiful. Different from the day before, it catches Castiel’s ear, and he already knows Anael will tease him for humming it all day. No one around him seems as captivated as he is, either too busy or hurried to stop and listen.
It’s Dean’s turn to get teary, his shoulders shaking with each of Chuck’s words. They lost Karen just before he was born. All he knows about her is that she made the best pies and that Bobby loved her with his whole self. The way his parents loved each other. Missouri, he hasn’t thought of Missouri since his last trip to Sioux Falls a year before. Thinking of her and the motherly way she treats him and Sam has him letting out a sobbing gasp. Castiel lowers himself to the arm of the bench and pulls Dean into his chest, rubbing soothing circles across his flannel shirt. The warmth of his hand seeps deep into his bones, a gentle comfort.
“Yes. I - I believe so.”
“You know her?” he asks in disbelief, “I just ran into her on my way here. Man, that girl can play.”
Dean spends a good forty minutes skipping back and forth from restaurant menu to review site, trying to pick something nice but innocuous. Finally, after a hurried text fight with Sam - Dean refuses to say why he’s skipping out on lunch, but still wants his opinion on a lunch place - he picks the Claremont Club Café. He spends the remainder of the morning strumming for the few late-morning commuters, then hops a bus to Sam’s apartment where he drops off his guitar and stool, changes into a clean undershirt and flannel, and takes the time to dust the dirt off his boots.
“Why didn’t I pick up on them?”
Knowing he would lose this fight no matter what, he conceded defeat. “Of course, Your Majesty,” Castiel said with mock sincerity. “I will pass along your summons. Though I can’t guarantee he’ll come.”
Which is all well and good until the Moondoor events start up again in the Spring.
He can hardly breathe, let alone answer Cas’s question. He’s completely overwhelmed with emotion, on the verge of tears. He feels warm and mushy and is so glad Sam is out of town with Madison to visit her parents. He doesn’t think he could reign it in if his giant of a brother knew what Cas had worked out for him.
Sam ignores him, and steps into the room, collapsing into his own chair.
He knocks out a staccato on the office door and doesn’t wait to be let in, turning the knob to bombard his brother with an over-eager smile. Sam jumps a foot in the air from the racket Dean’s made but settles once he sees who’s in the doorway.
(See the end of the chapter for
“You must be so proud,” Chuck says, and his tears have dried, but he looks no less wrecked over their impromptu reunion. He leans into Dean’s space, not wanting to remove the photos, but desperate for a closer look. “She’s just as beautiful as the day I met her,” he points to a family portrait, all four Winchesters with their instruments held aloft, mid-performance.
The little smirk that accompanied his words featured prominently in Castiel’s daydreams.  When he’d called Charlie later that evening, she’d worked out his crush in less than a minute, and really, he shouldn’t have been surprised. What he hadn’t planned on - foolish really - was her invitation to have Dean over to their Friday game night. Castiel hadn’t mentioned anything to her about the exhibit details despite her asking, so he supposed she had latched onto the next best thing to get her work fix. He was strict about fostering a clean break from work while she developed familial bonds with her wife and son.  The call didn’t last more than ten minutes before his friends were ganging up on him.
Just before the museum is due to close, Charlie takes the stage once more, gathering everyone into the lobby so she can make one final announcement. She and Castiel share a private smile.
He looks to Cas from the corner of his eye and turns fully to him when he sees the other man staring back at him. Then, the distance between them disappears and their lips meet in a gentle press. Neither vies for more until they each pull away and open their eyes. He grins, elated and Castiel swoops in for a deeper kiss. He opens his mouth in invitation for more. A few gasping kisses find him hovering over Castiel, pushed back to lay on the long edge of the couch. The space isn’t quite wide enough for them both, but he makes do with one knee wedged between Cas and the back of the couch, and the other foot planted on the floor. His hands cradle Cas’s head as an excuse to run through his thick hair and they rut against each other like men half their age.
He almost forgets to be nervous in the face of what feels an awful lot to his heart like Dean is coming home.
“Lunch sounds good. I’ll give you a call,” he quips and tucks the card into his breast pocket with a gentle pat. “I’m Dean, by the way. Dean Winchester.”
Dean sat down and put his arm around Castiel, pulling him in for a kiss, then resting his head on Cas’s shoulder, easing into a more comfortable position against him. “Yup. I really wished they’d just make out already. The tension is
Sam lifts the lid apprehensively, revealing a lump of pink fur that opens to a huge bunny onesie.
“Have lunch with ‘im every day since I got into town,” he stops short of telling Castiel about their text battle that morning, unwilling to admit how much he’s been anticipating the last several hours.
“Dean, this is awesome!” Sam exclaims, holding Dean away from him by the shoulders. There are unshed tears in his eyes and Dean isn’t sure when this little celebration turned into something serious, but Sam steps away and runs a finger beneath his eyes and offers quietly, “Mom and Dad would love him.”
They’re back at the museum before Castiel is ready to say goodbye, so he offers Dean a grand tour of the place, leading him from room to room, noting the artifacts that make Dean’s face light up: a sculpture made entirely of car parts and a hand-carved wooden mask he admits reminds him of Inigo Montoya.
“New song?” he asks, counting the freckles along the man's nose, uncaring that this is the first time he's given more than a passing thought to what's playing around him. “It's lovely,” he adds and watches as the man's blush deepens.
“Well, hey. Small world, huh,” she states more than asks.
“Hello, Angel,” Charlie replies on a snorting laugh, stepping away from the door to let the men inside.
“I don't think so,” he answers with a furrowed brow, his head tilting to the side as he considers the implication of her words. He never hums or sings along with the radio. Truthfully, he encounters very little music in his daily life.
Waiting for Dean to return his text had been some sort of torture, but just before he decided to head to bed that evening, Dean texted him back:
After an hour, he’s decompressed enough for a brief conversation. He turns his desk chair to face Anael and offers to the quiet room, “The interview went well.”
“Seriously, though, Dean. It’s been forever since you had someone. Maybe this'll be good for you,” Sam claims when they finally calm. “What’s his big quest anyway?”
“Really,” Charlie asks with thinly veiled excitement. Castiel wants to intervene, but keeps silent, hoping her questions don’t go too deep.
“What does that mean?”
“Dunno. I mean, I think Claire impacted you, too. But our bond might overshadow what you get from the other bards.”
with lead singer Ben Gibbard.
site on bards, and Castiel reads over the fantastical description, entranced by the idea of any of it being true. As he reads, though, a chill breaks out along the back of his neck.
“All right, you three, enough work. Let’s play,” Gilda chides, and pulls Anson into her lap so he can help her roll the dice.
The boy grabs for the goodie, and plops down on his rear end right beside Dean’s legs, and sucks on the corner of the tortilla chip. Dean reaches down to ruffle the boy’s hair and offers a second chip dipped in queso. Anson drops the first to the tiled floor and eats all the dip off the chip, smearing his mouth and hands with cheese sauce. They catch eyes when Dean raises up and get stuck for a moment staring at one another until Charlie bumps Dean’s hip with her own and they each grab a bowl to take to the dining room table.  Gilda sits down and reaches for the
Castiel shifts his canvas grocery bag higher on his arm and takes a deep breath. He spares a glance at Dean, and the pair are still staring at each other when the door swings open on its hinges, revealing Charlie in all her bubbly, exasperated glory. Dean and Castiel each jump, shoulders knocking, and the bag slips down Castiel’s arm to be deftly caught by Dean. They’re a little frazzled, and Charlie is eating it up with a spoon, thrilled that her best friend has been rendered nearly useless by the man next to him.
ring out through the speakers for the forty-seventh time that night. Dean, in all his red-flannel, perfectly-coiffed glory growls at them from the karaoke stage. They shut up and endure the two minutes of auditory torture.
-inspired appliances, the backsplash a combination of Charlie’s Gryffindor and Gilda’s Hufflepuff colors.  Dean and Charlie are dumping chips into serving bowls and Castiel watches Dean sneak a chip to Anson, who had sidled up to their newest house guest.
“What in god's creation is Moondoor?”
“Holy shit! It’s freakin’ perfect, Cas!”
Pissed off.
“Thanks, man,” she drawls when he raises up, and with two words, Dean knows he must hear her sing. Her voice is raspy, something caught between blues and folk, and he’s already picked two dozen songs for her when he realizes he’s creeping himself out with his own inner monologue.
Castiel wakes warm and cozy the next morning with Dean curled against his back. He has a moment to bask in the novelty of having someone to wake up to and almost wishes they were lying face to face so he can watch Dean as he sleeps. He shifts an arm from beneath the sheets and pulls his phone closer to read the time. It’s early, probably just enough time to have breakfast before he needs to be at the museum. He sets the phone back in place and pulls himself fully under the sheets, nestling back into the solid line of heat Dean provides. He feels his hair tangle with Dean’s beard and the other man stirs behind him, so Castiel takes the opportunity to stretch a bit before settling again. Dean shifts his hips back slightly and noses along his neck, running his scruff between Cas’s shoulder blades and planting a kiss just below his hairline. It tickles, and he tenses up but still offers more of his neck to Dean who smooches him right behind his ear.
Dean loves watching the transit station slowly yawn awake, filling up with all sorts of people eager to begin their day. He tries not to choose favorites among his audience, typically moves on to the next city before that happens, but Joshua keeps him tethered, and there's a little girl who darts away from her mother, through grown-up legs, right up to his case and drops a little scrap of paper inside each morning. They're little pictures: a bird, tree, and globe.  Yesterday’s drawing was his absolute favorite - his mother's guitar, complete with Sam and Dean's initials that the boys scratched into its body with a small pocket knife when they were six and ten. Dean had spent the rest of the afternoon writing her a song.
“Oh man, yeah! And I thought
Dean only uses John’s tape deck on rare occasions - he’s happy listening to the same box of mullet rock for the rest of his life, thank you very much.
Stepping off the bus, Dean looks across campus for a moment, admiring the stone buildings. Stanford's law school used to intimidate Dean; the people hurrying about in pencil skirts and creased slacks are intense. Dean is keenly aware his flannel and jeans stick out like a sore thumb, but he carries on regardless, head held high. He remembers having a case of stage fright when he was younger and his mother telling him to keep his chin up and always look the audience in the eye. She said more often than not, he would be met with a smile. He suspects the lawyers-in-training are too stressed to share a kind interaction, and once he made peace with that thought, he found he had no fear of them.
Castiel spends the remainder of his workday helping Anael with the quilt. They chat about their weekend plans and on his way home, he considers how much he enjoys her company. That perhaps his first month without Charlie won't be so bad after all. The thought buoys him for the rest of the evening.
“Honey, you’re home,” Dean announces, beaming up at him when the door closes and he returns the gesture, leaning into Dean’s space to peck him on the lips.
Dean breathes deeply and Castiel watches the place where Dean’s amulet is hidden beneath his shirt emit a gentle, pulsing glow. Castiel researched the amulet after their first meeting with Chuck. His notes are still in the file, but he remembers it as a talisman, a sort of channeling device for the bard’s power. With his suspicions confirmed, it’s easy to fill in the blanks, explain the unusual charm Dean possesses.
The night before Christmas, all through the Bunker, guests grooved to Zeppelin, partaking in hunter’s helper.
Castiel wakes early on the morning of the exhibit opening and takes the opportunity to kiss Dean awake. They spend an inordinate amount of time tangled under the sheets, until his alarm goes off and they get themselves up, sated and happy, to share a shower. Dean makes them an extravagant breakfast of bacon, eggs, toast, and jelly. They share kisses between bites and go over the plan for the day. Castiel works a full day and the exhibit opening isn’t until five that evening, so Dean will be able to give his guitar lessons and get home in time for them to change before heading back to the museum.
“Are you going out for lunch?”
“Yeah. He works at some folk museum and has an exhibit coming up on street performers. Wanted to interview me for it. And look, it’s not really like that, ok? But you know I can’t help it when I feel something.” He looks to Sam with a hangdog expression and Sam takes pity on him.
"Yeah, yeah," Dean groused, digging his phone from his pocket to text his foreman that he'd be out sick.
. I picked the band because Jared Padalecki has mentioned that he imagines Sam listening to them. I picked the song based on
Dean hands over the microphone and helps them settle in, winking at Maggie and thanking her for keeping the boys away from Charlie. Once everyone is set, he joins Cas and the Bradburys and enjoys the rest of the night. At some point, the crowd decides to make the lobby into a dance floor, and Dean pulls Castiel into his arms, swaying to the beat of the music. Ed invites Claire and Chuck to join them on stage and tries to get Dean to join in, too until Maggie pulls him back from the microphone, letting Dean continue to lead Cas around the dance floor.
The Pastor closes his book, and sets it aside, tucking into his advent supper alone still without Leah.
“That went well, I think,” he surmises.
On one monitor, he reads over his notes from his interview with Dean, and on the other is the file list for Charlie’s hard drive. He finishes proofing his notes and opens a folder titled Research from the hard drive. Inside is a plethora of information on the museum’s existing collection, including write-ups on each of the instruments Charlie is planning to display. He minimizes the file list and opens the internet browser, doing a quick search for “Bardic Tradition” and spends the remainder of the afternoon researching his part of the exhibit.
He brings Claire her second-favorite sandwich one afternoon, a hot ham and cheese from Alfie’s cafe with a complimentary cookie, and hands it over before setting up his own guitar to play for tips while she eats. The bench has become their new favorite spot to play, enough room for Claire to sit and eat while Dean strums a song that reminds him of Cas. All his songs remind him of Cas these days. Claire finishes her sandwich in record time, and they play together in companionable silence for a few hours, save for the notes from their instruments.
“Dean, I’m so sorry. That’s...terrible. Just, awful.”
, leg lamp displayed proudly next to the pawnshop television.
“Yeah, I’m here every day, same time. I’ll see ya around.”
“Wouldn’t you rather him transport us out of here, Dean?”
“I know. You’ve gotta play when the mood takes you. It was the same way with mom. Remember when dad got pissed at that English dude, Ketch, who kept showing up to our shows? Flashing all his money? And mom started coming up with original material and dad got so pissed, he punched the guy and we had to leave town in the middle of the night?”  Dean nods his head emphatically and they share a laugh. Dean motions for Sam to return the guitar and he hands it over, thumbing their initials.
“How ‘bout we get a few sandwiches and go see Claire? Maybe we can bribe her into talking with cold cuts?” Dean offers with a boyish smile. He makes everything effortless and Castiel is immensely grateful to him at that moment.
Dean opens his eyes, catching his own and speaks in a clear and strong voice, as though reciting some ancient mythology. “In the beginning, the universe was spoken into existence. The words of the gods gave the universe shape, the echoes of those primordial Words of Creation still resound throughout the cosmos. Our music is an attempt to harness those echoes, weave them into the power of our own songs. Patrons, as you know, amplify a Bard’s connection to the Words. So, each penny earned, every minute spent listening, and smile freely given makes my music stronger. A true patron ticks all these boxes,” Dean points to the bulleted list of patronage types. “The more boxes you check, the stronger the bond.”
“She’s actually much more capable than she seems.”
Cas holds up a hand.  “Dean.  It’s all right.  I promise you.  I like that you talk to me like...a person.  Tell me more about Ellen.  Your family.  About Sammy.  You’ve told me about him and his family, but you never talk about when you were younger.  What kind of a child were you, Dean?”
But Dean
Cas shrugs, smiles.  “It’s as good a theory as any I’ve come up with.”
“Sam’s room.”
Cas continues.  “Did you know that the world’s largest ball of twine is in Kansas?”
“Dean.  I’m non-corporeal.  Are you familiar with the term?”
Cas lies down next to him, hovering over the sheets.  “Dean, look at me.”
“Yeah?” Sam agrees with a shrug.
Charlie gets reservations for two weeks and it’s just as well, because Dean is busy working with lawyers and getting all the paperwork set for Cas’s house.
The house is quiet when he arrives—Rowena is already gone.
Dean grins. “Yeah, wish I could take credit for that. It was all Cas, he asked about what you guys had around here, said she’d love it personalized, and man, he was right.”
, in excitement.  “I’ve heard that’s a more advanced position.  Do you want that...now?”
Cas nods.  “I know you do.  Very much.  Do you...want it back?  What you had, before?”
The joy.
“No!”  Cas’s fingers seize in the fabric of his shirt.  “No.”  He looks into Dean’s eyes.  “Dean, I want more.
Sam turns, honing in on Dean like he has some sixth sense.  “Look how domestic you are, man!  And dad always said
how Dean would describe him.
Dean swipes his panel under the scanner for luggage and his pod is deposited with a thunk, ready to tether.  He sets it to sync with his panel, then has to try again when it fails.  He ignores the impatient huff behind him and the twisting in his stomach.
Sam tips his head in confusion and then his eyes widen.  “Oh.  Oh, shit, I’m sorry.  He didn’t...I didn’t know.  Bet that wasn’t easy.”
He turns back and grabs his empty cup.  “Kitchen table?  I’ll grab some paper from the study, I just need some visuals, I think.”
, Cas, shit, God,
He’s known it was coming.  He’s been thinking about it for days.  “You’re leaving, then?” he asks.
“Don’t do that, man.” Dean shakes his head and scrubs his fingers across the back of his neck.  “Cas…this has been the best night I’ve had in…well, a really long time.  You’re not keeping me from
God, look at all this.  Look at you.  I mean, we never dreamed anything like this was possible, back when we were kids.  You, this, it’s everything we—he ever wanted.”
“Can’t a guy plan ahead?  Just get me my food and stow the commentary, huh?  It’s been a long day.”
He releases Sam abruptly and stalks to the kitchen, starts assembling coffee with shaking hands.  The shower is still running.
“Hello, Dean,” Cas greets as Dean staggers in with the bags of food he picked up at the grocery store.
Jesse shrugs.  “I may not be in the best place for it myself,” he admits.  “You just get out of a relationship, too?”
"What?  No, of course, holy shit!  If I’d known this was an option…wait, did you
“Oh he’s not...he’s not local and it’s not that kinda hard time.”
Dean chuckles.  “Ah, Charles.”  He takes a sip to buy some time.  “Yeah, it’s Cas, but it’s not like that.  He’s just having a tough time and I don’t know how to help, you know.  From so far away.”  The feeling that’s been making him constantly queasy rises up again and he sets his beer down.
The way they touch him forces his hips to jerk forward, someone’s cupping his scrotum, someone’s got a tight grip at the base of his dick and those mouths, fuck, those hungry mouths are more than he can take, and then one of them slides down again, hot and perfect around him.  The gentle suction slides off, and there’s a shock of cold before the other’s mouth takes over and they take turns sucking him off in uniquely mind blowing ways, different pressure and shapes and techniques, different but equally as intense and he’s lost his rhythm, lost his mind.
“Yeah!”  Kevin turns back to the phone.  “He’ll meet you there, then.  Yes.  Yes.  Thanks so much.”
“Nostalgia’s a weird word.  I just wanted to have a look at ‘em.  It’s no big deal, really.  I was just thinking about ‘em and how mom used to talk about him and stuff, and I guess...I just wanted to see.”
Not that it’s saying a whole lot, really.
“I can’t.  Your Latin is terrible, and I think that’s for demons.  And it definitely wouldn’t work even if I
From his perch next to Dean, Cas somehow talks him into telling the story about getting locked out of the house when he was 12 and taking the door off the hinges.  Then the one about Sam getting the flu so bad Dean skipped school for five days and almost got suspended.  That somehow leads into the time Ellen let him into the commercial kitchen and he ruined an entire day’s worth of bread by adding sugar instead of salt.
Sam’s smile takes up his whole face.  “Thank you.”
He’s a terrible liar.
“GET OUT!!”
Sam snorts softly.  “That’s not what you said last week.”
Cas turns toward Sam and smiles shyly.  Sam touches his face.  “Good?” he asks.
There’s something about the way he says it that makes Dean look away. It’s wistful. Full. There’s some longing there that Dean finds himself wanting to fulfill.
Dean had been ready to spread his hand to allow Cas to greet him comfortably.  He’d been ready to offer a cheek if they got that far.
Dean squirms.  “Yeah, I mean…  I guess?”
“Thanks, man, you’re the best.  I have to see what happened with this inspection.”
“Leaving.  Leaving without…”  He shakes his head and turns back to the door, heads inside and goes straight for the bathroom.  Cas hears the lock twist.
Dean thinks as his eyes drift closed again.
“You could come in and find out.”
“Plenty of time.  We’ll make her something she’ll love.”
Dean stands in the doorway and watches Rowena step into the garage, the automatic door already rising.  Glancing back at the house, he sees the lights are on in welcome and when he turns back, Rowena’s Z3 is already sticking its nose into the driveway.
“Please,
Cas glances up and Dean can tell that the coffee has done it’s job — there’s no trademark eyebrow raise to indicate that Dean has said something ridiculous.
“Dean, we can’t keep doing this every year,” Sam grumbles, assembling an elaborate vignette of their last werewolf hunt with red felted elves. He grimaces at the jolly mischievous face and adds more corn syrup blood to its imaginary fangs. That’s going to stain.
Castiel can’t legally contact Charlie regarding anything work-related, so he keeps his lunch meeting to himself, but it doesn’t stop him wanting her advice on what to say to Dean. He thinks back to their brief interaction and cringes inwardly at the way he handled the entire situation, though he doesn’t think he’ll do much better this afternoon either. Scatterbrained, he nearly collides with Anael in his office who’s working on the quilt and they each apologize to one another.
“You. A, um. Date? If that’s something you might want to pursue. With me.”
Castiel opens his mouth to ask more questions, but he’s afraid of broaching the true reason for this heart-to-heart. The part of him left from before he met Dean wants to keep his next question locked away, but the part of him that has changed because of the man sitting across from him takes a leap of faith.
“And your dad. Met Mary first though, what a lady. Does she still play?”
“Depends, whatcha got?” Claire asks, eyeing the bags Castiel carries.
“That with those dark grey slacks you’ve got and the boots.”
He sees the hesitance in Castiel's blue eyes and quickly nods, their lips brushing in the narrow space between them. "Yeah, Cas. Just this. Whatever you need," he whispers, entirely content. When Castiel beams at him: a wide smile that shows all his teeth and his gum line and it is Dean’s absolute favorite thing, he can't help but capture Castiel in another kiss that goes on long after their beer goes warm.
Ed Zeddmore only watched
On his way to the park, his back pocket vibrates, and he shifts the guitar case to fish his phone from his jeans. He always marvels at Castiel’s seemingly perfect timing; he never sends a text or calls when Dean’s playing. It’s like the universe conspires to never interrupt their music. Dean unlocks the phone with his thumb, and reads the message on the screen:
from Tumblr.
box, lifting the lid and pulling out the contents. She and Castiel set up the board while Dean, Charlie and Anson snack on chips and dips.
“Chuck’s great, Cas. Little squirrely, but kind-hearted. I think you’ll really like him. He’s got that whole modern folk thing going on, perfect for the museum!”
He spends the morning assisting Anael with the quilt and she reveals she’s been doing her own research on several performers in the surrounding area; it seems Castiel’s enthusiasm has rubbed off on her, too. When Castiel grabs his wallet and travel notebook before noon, Anael makes an excuse to go up with him to the lobby and he kindly doesn’t call her out on wanting to see Dean for herself.  She chats for a few moments with the volunteer at the front desk as Castiel tries not to pace the entryway.
“Dean Winchester,” Chuck whispers his name like a prayer, reverent. “When Becky said it was...but I didn’t think - I mean. Wow. It’s you.”
Dean’s not quite ready to admit aloud that he believes it, too.
“She is really quite remarkable.  My colleague and I came upon her on our way to lunch yesterday. She’s on my list of contacts. I thought I’d reach out to her through her social media, see if I can’t find more artists in the area.”
Dean flipped the footrest on the armchair and grabbed his worn copy of
The room gives him a collectively blank look. Just as he’s about to school everyone on a solid decision, Cas beats him to it.
Charlie smacks the table in front of her and gasps out, swinging her head around, red curls flying, “You
This story was inspired by
“Cas here works at the Folk Museum a coupla blocks that way,” Dean indicates, jabbing a thumb at Castiel, then over his shoulder. “He’s got an exhibit coming up an he’s looking for buskers to interview.  Think you might be interested?” It’s not how Castiel would approach her, but it seems they’ve bonded telepathically over lunch, and she readily agrees to help them.
Thirty minutes later, they bid Claire farewell, and make their way to the museum. Castiel has a dozen pages of notes and six more names of local buskers to interview. Dean takes the list from Castiel’s hands and promises to speak with them if Castiel will email him the list of questions.
“That’s Dean,” he states, not giving in to her teasing.
"Real good, Sammy. Wrote a new song."
"I've never actually been interviewed for anything in my life, so go easy on me," Dean warns, laughing a bit and moving to toy with the cord knotted at his neck. He puts his arm down immediately, afraid of showing his nervous sweat.
“I had that approved by HR, so they’re all expecting it,” he admits, only vaguely scandalized that he went through with his own idea.
Dots bounce along next to Dean’s unsaved number and Castiel waits a moment longer before the restaurant details pop into existence. It’s within walking distance of the museum and he quickly taps out an affirmative reply, confirming the time and place. He locks the phone screen and takes a deep breath. Turning back to his desk, he catches Anael watching him with a bemused expression on her face, leaning her hip against the table. When he doesn’t immediately engage with her, she goes back to work, humming the wildflower song under her breath. He spends the time before his meeting rehearsing each question he’ll ask Dean Winchester.
Heaven isn’t what it was last time he was there.  It’s just another thing that doesn’t feel quite right, that isn’t the same...everything is just
Dean grins.  Nerdy little dude.  He loves it.  “Yeah, makes sense, let me see…”  He knocking on the wall to look for a stud when Cas sets a translucent finger in front of him.
“Thank you, Dean.  It’s kind of you to say.”
He weighs his words carefully.  Finally he says, “Sam, I’m not asking him to choose between us.  Would you...is that what you need?”
“I like it.”  Cas’s expression is soft.
Dean grins.  “Good question, no, and next Saturday.”
Cas whimpers and Sam hums, and he’s not sure he’ll even make it to having them touch him.  He might just come like this, with the promise of the two of them moving down in tandem.
“I’m sure it’ll be fine.”  He shifts his weight, eager to get back to Cas.
Dean wants to protest.  He feels massively unworthy.  But he’s afraid refusal will sound like rejection, and nothing could be further from the truth.
your ticket to the next world.”
.  His essence.  The deepest, most intimate parts of him.  It curls like something living, tracing patterns in the air.  It doesn’t move along Cas’s material form, it nestles inside it.  It is everything that Dean loves.
He makes Cas muffins the next morning with apple, caramel and cinnamon.
“I didn’t think I’d ever see him again.”
Sam laughs and rubs his face.  He takes a deep breath.  “I mean, I don’t know if we know how to do it any other way.”  He laughs softly.  “If we’re talking we’re fighting.  But we care about each other.”
“Yeah, yeah.  I mean, you said live it up, right?”  He runs through a million scenarios in his head, a million ways to say it, or lie and replace pronouns or otherwise edit this into something, and it’s insane because he’s been out for almost twenty years now, but it’s as terrifying as telling his family when he was fifteen and wanted to bring a boy home.
have you been?” he hisses.
It’s after eleven when they’re both in bed and Dean clicks off his light and turns toward Cas. The darkness makes everything a bit more intimate, so when Dean slides a hand up the outside of his thigh, Cas whimpers.
His smile feels a little strained when he looks over at Cas, who’s watching him and not looking at the cups in utter disgust, so that’s something.
Dean nods.  “I hope so.”  He looks up, hesitant.  “Cas.  You know I didn’t make them for her, right?”
You.  And, um, and—”  He looks up as if he can will the tears to stop and his breathing is ragged.  Dean can hardly breathe with the way his entire body feels ripped open.
Is this that Cas guy that you were
and he’s been dead for a long time and why his opinion should matter anyway is completely beyond comprehension.
She reaches the car while he argues with himself, and taps on the glass with one perfect red nail.
Cas raises an eyebrow.  “A ‘thing?’  He was a musician in my time if that’s what you’re asking.”
Check and mate.  That’s what he gets for trying to make nice.  He considers how to back-pedal, then shakes his head and sighs.  “Of course, what can I do?”
“Goodnight, Cas,” he says softly, fingers trailing over Cas’s form reverently.
Dean hovers over the phone for a minute, wondering if he can somehow save himself from the third degree.
“No, Cas, sorry. I have exactly none rich uncles, man.”
“Hey, there,” he says, voice a bit rough.  “I’m Sam.”  As if Cas doesn’t know who tried to bleed to death in his guest room.
He looks up and Cas is sitting in the booth across from him.
been.
His voice is barely a whisper.  “I’d kiss him slow to start, no tongue.  Just that soft way you explore someone’s lips, getting a feel for what he likes, you know.  I might...I might hold the back of his neck.  Not tight, just set my hand there.”
Cas’s laugh is bright light and a low chuckle sound, and yeah.  Sexy is
Dean’s hand spans the back of his neck, pulls him back, and then Cas is staring into Dean’s eyes.  “Cas, you know it’s not safe, right?  You know

can make up for a guy being eternally stuck inside his old home, watching people leave him over and over.  “Sorry,” he says quickly.  “Stupid question.”
“Well, they sound delightful,” Rowena says with a demure tip of her head.  “Perhaps I’ll have one after you and Cas enjoy a few, hmm?”
Dean chuckles.  “Okay, you caught me.  I did want to talk to you, though.  I...remember those weird journals you had from Grandpa Campbell?”
Freshly warmed muffin in hand, Dean heads for the living room and nearly runs into Rowena.  “Oh, Dean,” she says, in that overly innocent way, as if something
.  “What?
“Hey,” he says quietly.
Nothing
Dean swallows.  Why does this all have to be so damn hard?  “So,” he says, changing the subject, “What did Rowena leave me for dinner?”
There's a lot on Dean's mind and he can't really talk to anyone about it.  But he can mend some bridges.
” he starts laughing again and Dean snaps the book shut.
The next touch of lips is gentle, more benediction than battle.
“Dean,” Cas says, and his voice is strange and rough.  “Dean, you feel…
“Is it all right?” Cas asks quietly.  His skin is quiet.
.  Your house is an amazing feat and stop trying to tell me it’s not.”
But Dean’s got his teeth in the problem, now.  He’s invested.  He’s curious.  He’s stubbornly committed to selling this house with everyone involved feeling good.
Dean lets his gaze trace the line of Cas’s sharp cheekbones, his lips before he leans in to kiss him, hoping it says all the things he struggles to put words to.  “Not gonna rush,” he whispers.  Cas pushes in hungrily.  “We have time, okay?”
Cas looks up at him, a wide smile on his face, eyelids at half-mast.  It’s the happiest Dean has ever seen him.
Small eyes, the same glowing blue as the human form, blink into existence across his chest.  The trenchcoat becomes a cascade of something that looks like feathers, and his tentacles rise back behind and under him, and Dean reads him more easily, now, he’s been studying with Cas for a decade—position and direction of light, duration and color of the light pulses.  Cas is smiling at him, and Dean holds out his hand.
Dean reaches out and Cas withdraws from his mouth slowly.  “Dean, can I make love to you like this?”
Cas nods at him to go on.
“Yes, of course.”
(he’d considered a few words, his first choice close to ‘soulmate.’  But he’d chickened out and gone with the more broadly applicable, ‘close friend.’)
, he’s going to explode.  He’s going to die, right here.  Right now.
Dean raises an eyebrow, and Cas can feel the argument coming.  “Cas, c’mon.  You know I don’t like it, but it’s not up to me…”
He brings back the blankets from the living room.  The one with the modern lantern pattern that Dean had gotten him for Christmas.  The old tattered one with the wolves on it that Dean had lingered over at Target.
“Yeah, it’s fine, whatever,” Kevin says as the door swings shut behind Dean.
Cas nods, one eyebrow raised.  “Exactly.  Because we both get to make our own choices.  It’s what we agreed to when you got out of rehab.  Right?  I don’t get to make choices for you.  And you don’t get to make choices for me.”
He feels like the whole world is behind some gauze of Hell that came up with him, rings in his ears, clouds his vision, makes everything muffled.
“One minute,” Cas says softly.  “It’s almost ready.”
” she asks archly.
the world grinding to a halt.  He looks over his shoulder and Dean is still, almost as pale as the man who just fell into Cas’s arms, looking like he’s trying to drag air in and not having much success.
Sam shakes his head, eyebrows raised in disbelief. “I mean, you absolutely outdid yourself,” he admits. “And you

Not for long.

“Yeah.”  Dean takes a bite of his burger and moans, distracted.  “Oh my god,” he mutters, mouth full.  “Heaven.”   He curses himself again, fights to swallow so he can apologize for his afterlife reference.
“Yeah, but it’ll buy me

—a soft peach color, three pulses and a soft aurora glow.
Dean rolls his eyes.  “Ah, I’m not a
Cas stands in the doorway to the kitchen and waits for them to catch sight of him.  There’s something about watching them that makes him ache.  They stand close.  Some might say
.  They both are.
“Here?” he finally says as the waitress sets his plate down in front of him.
I wanted to post this past Monday but I just didn't have it done.  So, happy Thursday!  Fair warning, this chapter is NSFW!
Sorry this week's chapter is so late!  I'm still planning to post weekly at least for November, hopefully back to Mondays after this! I have to determine what fits best in what chapters at the moment.  Some more challenging chapters coming up, but I promise it'll all be all right!
“Thank you,” Cas says, reaching out with two tentacles and twining them around Dean’s arm.  His voice is the same, and it’s still incredible to Dean that Cas has learned his language, going so far as to learn how to make and modulate sound waves.
So when the lights fade into the soft green indicating it’s time for the passengers to clip in, Dean moves hastily to the cabin and seals into his six point harness for landing.
“Like Hemingway?”
“It sounds like they were lucky to have you,” Cas says gently.
If it had been Sam — any of his friends, really — he’d have teased them mercilessly for being such a sap.
The bathroom door opens, loud as a gunshot, and Dean steps through.  “Hey,” he says, and Cas turns, and watches Dean’s face fall, start to crumble, turn to stone, and then his chin is up and he’s looking at his brother with an intensely blank face.
Cas huffs a laugh. “No,” he says gently. “But I did move it.  You can bring it back, of course.”
Dean nods, opens for the tentacle and reaches out for more.
It’s a stupid way to go.  He knows it even as shock sets in.  The thing that hurts the most is the look on Sam’s face.  That’s the injury he’ll take with him into the afterlife.
He’s even got some low grade jitters when he parks at the steakhouse.  It’s not full-fledged teenage butterflies, but it’s more than he’s felt for a while—maybe it really is just a case of giving it a chance.
“Yeah.  I, um, I get that’s probably weird for you, huh?”
Cas tips his head, looking puzzled.
“Dean’s brother.”  Cas shakes his hand after one aimless moment of indecision.
“You too, man,” and he means it.
That grin again, wide and glowing, and then a slow unfurling of tentacles from under the trenchcoat, shining blue-purple with an undercurrent of indigo that confirms his current gender, the superimposed colors shifting rapidly as Cas talks far too quickly for Dean to understand.
“Not me, it’s you?” Jesse asks with a half smile.
, but he’s damn well not going to stop seeing Cas until Cas tells him to get lost.
Cas goes quiet and serious.  “I don’t ever want to scare you away, Dean.”  There’s no hint of humor.
foreign here.  It’s fine, though.  I’ve always liked how you look.”
Cas’s fingers fiddle with the buttons of Dean’s shirt, his body pressed along Dean’s in a way that feels completely natural.
And then Cas moves inside him, huge tentacle rocking in place and pressing relentlessly against his prostate.  “There?  Is that what you wanted?  You look amazing, I love how you perspire, how you move, it feels—”  His voice sounds like a radio that cuts out as he continues to move.  “It feel so—
Jesse shakes his hand at the end of the date, and Dean smiles at him, embarrassed.  “I’m really sorry, man.  Just got a lot on my mind, you know?”
“Yeah, man, blood pouring down walls, full on terrifying ghost stuff.”
“Did you, ah…”
Dean nods once.  “I would.  Like.”  He opens the door and turns back once to see Cas staring after him.  “Goodnight, Cas.”
Cas shrugs. “I don’t know what else to think.  My wife passed on, here.  My daughter.  Two of my grandchildren.  And this hasn’t turned into a family affair.  What else could it be?  Why else would I be trapped here?”
He reaches across the table to take the papers back and rises from the table, asking, “Would you like to stay? We can watch something before you have to go.”
“Are you humming?” Anael asks from the doorway. Castiel jolts, turning in his desk chair to face her stunned expression.
“I’m miserable but better. Thank you for taking care of me,” Castiel rasped. Dean thought he did sound less like he was on his deathbed than yesterday. “I still hate you for not getting sick.”
“If you didn’t bring me a Red Ryder BB Gun, get out,” Dean says from his recliner.
Anael leaves him alone in the workroom to disappear up to her office, and Castiel continues uninterrupted, well past his regular hours.
Then, Castiel turns back to the crowd, sweeping an arm toward Dean, “Without further ado, Dean Winchester.”
Castiel takes a moment to admire the view before answering, “We’ll have to go down to Milton’s.”
“I’ll email you the video clip I took. She’s on Instagram,” Anael answers, tapping on her phone screen.  Castiel’s inbox pings with a new email, and he is suddenly relieved to know he can reach out to her online. Perhaps later this week, after his meeting with Dean. He thanks Anael for her message and the pair work in relative silence through the morning. Anael makes good progress on her restorations and Castiel digs through Charlie’s notes, finalizing a list of questions for Dean.
“You sound great, loved the song,” he grins, managing to rein in his fanboy.
After his morning routine, he and Charlie head up to the exhibit, making one last walkthrough and setting up the brochures and guides that go along with the exhibit.  They assemble cocktail tables and set up the small bar in the lobby, ready the buffet table that will hold meat and cheese trays in a couple hours. He can feel the buzz start under his skin, a tingly feeling that makes his cheeks hurt once he realizes he’s smiling like a loon. Charlie shares his enthusiasm, letting out a little shriek of pent-up energy in the elevator on their way to the workroom. They stop work fifteen minutes early, Charlie skipping through the parking lot to her yellow Gremlin. She offers Castiel a ride home, but he declines, needing the few minutes to himself.
The rumpled lump on the couch turned baleful blue eyes upon him, and Dean took that as his cue to shut the hell up and help instead. He took stock of the living room – Castiel’s permanent residence since he’d caught a head cold from his co-worker three days before – tissues, thermometer, cough drop wrappers, and the nasty-tasting homeopathic ichor that Cas insisted he buy from the fancy grocery store across town littered every available surface.  He circled back to the kitchen, dropped his lunch containers in the sink, and grabbed the trashcan from beside the fridge.
Dean has, until recently, been happy with his nomadic lifestyle. A new place every couple of weeks, leaving his mark in small towns and big cities alike. During their last weekly call though, Sam had insisted that Dean join him in California, set up shop in the open-air transit station where street performers were welcome without the stigma of roadside buskers. It was a good spot, too. Tucked against a wall covered in mosaic glass depicting the ocean waves. Dean sits on his folding stool, guitar case laid open at his feet, adorned with photos of his mother and father when they had first started performing together in the early seventies. Mary Winchester’s golden hair in a wild mop, tamed only by the flower crown she wore, barefoot and strumming the guitar Dean now held, and John, in loose jeans and dark hair, only had eyes for his new bride, the laugh lines cut deep into his face already.
“I couldn’t resist. It’s one of Charlie’s absolute favorites, and she said the same thing the first time she visited the museum,” Castiel explains, wiping tears from eyes with the back of his hand.
Humming, Castiel replaces the watering can on its shelf and nearly has a heart attack at the wailing squeal behind him. Clutching his chest, he turns with wide eyes just as Charlie runs to him with open arms. She flings herself into him and they go careening into his desk, its contents wobbling dangerously.
“Good to see you two getting along,” Gilda sing-songs, coming from the hallway leading to their two bedrooms with Anson’s stuffed stegosaurus in her hand. She’s willowy with long brown hair that falls in curls to her waist. He knows how lovely it looks during the Moondoor events, woven with ribbon and twine and ivy, tangling in her fairy wings. Tonight, she has it piled atop her head in a messy bun and still looks absolutely beautiful.
Dean didn’t realize how huge moose were until there was one standing right in front of him.
“So, Dean. Castiel says you’ve been helping him on a project for work. How are things going?” Charlie asks. Castiel lifts his head to object to the question, hex tiles forgotten, but Dean is already talking.
“I’d like that,” Castiel says simply, giving Dean a smile that shows his gum line, even though he’s always been self-conscious about it, but Dean beams back at him and he feels warm all over again.
Sam pumps both fists in the air, a bit of cheese flying off the end of the fork to land somewhere on the floor.
He sighs again, staring at the photo he pulled from the mantel some time ago, and traces his forefinger across Jack's face, wishing more than anything they had another Christmas together. He would gladly trade places with the boy, but it seems the Empty's bargain will forever keep them apart.
“No way. Garth was always shedding glitter around the holidays. Remember that time those vamps tracked us through the woods ‘cause of the trail he left?”
He turns around with the blue fabric in his hands, letting it hang in front of himself.
…nah.
Dean has never been to an exhibit opening, let alone played one. He feels nervous but doesn’t want to trigger Cas’s anxiety, so he’s been keeping it to himself. Sure, he unloaded to Sam earlier this week, but his brother has always been good at talking him down from the ledge. Now though, as the bus draws closer to the museum, he can’t stop his leg jiggling or the compulsive way he wipes his sweaty palms down his thighs. A block away from their stop, Castiel reaches across the narrow gap between them and takes his hand. He wants to recoil from the touch, afraid of getting Cas’s hands sweaty, but the finds Cas a soothing comfort to his frayed nerves. He squeezes Cas’s fingers and they keep holding hands off the bus, down the street, and up the stairs to the museum’s main doors.
"Maybe we could play something later," Sam lilts when Deans turns the doorknob.
. Sam gives him a surprised look and Dean shrugs back in response. It’s never been his kind of music, but if it gets his brother to sing, he’ll play just about anything.
“We?”
He watches Chuck’s entire being collapse on itself, shoulders sagging and face falling into deep remorse. His eyes well up again, the tears carrying none of their previous mirth.
“I did,” he affirms, beaming at her.
“Good for her! I have no idea what you said, but I'm always up for a woman in power,” Anael admires with a smirk.
This was all discovered, of course, after the Zeddmore patriarch was found at the foot of the stairs, covered in water and feathers plucked from Maggie’s craft kit. Ed was grounded (but still opened presents Christmas day).
, Dean. And that night, I couldn’t get you out of my head. I came up with the idea of this exhibit because of you. With the…bards, uh, buskers.”
In the bunker.
“Very handsome. Now, c’ mere and give me a kiss.”
“Live Action Role Playing. It's a social club for people who wish to act out mock battles as part of a larger strategic game. Charlie is Moondoor’s current regent.”
“That’s fantastic, Castiel. So, you’ll be moving forward with the idea?”
The dots bounce along next to Cas’s name before Dean can respond:
Jack W. Lyle Park is primarily a large field where local community sports groups host soccer and peewee football games.  There is a modest jungle gym and a few benches set along a paved walking path that circumvents the entire tree-lined space.  It’s blocked in by two-story homes on three sides and the Rosen House Adult Care center on the fourth. Dean has brought his guitar along for their meeting; it’s a great ice breaker with the other buskers and he likes playing with new artists, collaborating on something unique born from their shared passion.
“Right. I read about that, too,” he gives Dean a coy tilt of his lips. An invitation. “So, it’s all true then?”
“It’s not an obsession, Sammy,” Dean grumbles, dejected. “It’s probably too early to admit to anything, but,” he cuts off to sigh and rubs a hand over his face, leaning deep into the couch cushions. “Look, there’s this guy, ok? I haven’t told you about him because it’s still new, but I’ve seen him every day since I got into town and he’s been… supporting me, you know?” Dean ends on an explosive sigh and waits for his brother’s reaction. He risks a peek at Sam and sees him speechless, eyebrows in his hairline, utterly flabbergasted.  “So yeah, man. Maybe you’re not far off the mark.”
“Charlie didn’t mention it, but the Board has asked you and Chuck to lead the summer program. If it goes well, they plan to extend it as an after-school program. Do you think you might be interested?”
Dean watches as Chuck runs his fingers over the weathered pickguard, scratched with decades of use. He traces the initials carved into the body and looks up with a question in his eyes, fingers resting over the
Dean takes a deep breath, finishes his water and looks into Castiel’s eyes, “Family band,” he starts and Castiel’s eyebrows raise in surprise. “I know, it sounds cheesy or whatever, but that’s how my mom and dad met, playing each other songs.  Mom always said dad won her over cause he knew every word to every Led Zeppelin song.”
The lobby slowly empties, a buzz of excitement leaving with them until only the museum staff and Dean are left.  Castiel turns fully to him, a wide smile gracing his face.
Dean still spends his early mornings waking up the people that make their homes at the transit station and spends a few afternoons with Claire each week after Castiel leaves him to go back to work. They make great tips when they play together. After a particularly good day some weeks before, Claire admitted her father left the family abruptly when she was ten, and her mother died earlier in the year from brain cancer. She and Dean had shared one of those ugly, snotty, therapeutic cries that clears your sinuses and leaves you closer to the person you’re with.
Castiel manages to underestimate how sneaky Charlie can get when she thinks he’s hiding something from her. He has caught her trying to hack his work email, and after a conversation on boundaries in the workplace, Castiel locks himself in the men’s room upstairs and laments to Dean during a frantic phone call, that he’s not sure he can do this anymore. Dean reminds him that he booked Ghostfacers outside of his work email, that they’ve only spoken over the phone, and that there is no real reason for Charlie to find out about their surprise.
“And that makes me your…”
“Yeah, maybe to you,” Dean mumbles and sets his fingers back to the strings. Sam leans into his space and grabs the guitar by its neck. Dean, unwilling to risk damage to the instrument, lets it be taken from him and set on Sam’s other side.
“And risk the constipation, no thanks, man.”
At Castiel’s blank expression, Dean says emphatically, “C’mon, Cas?
“Happy to, Cas. And for the record, you could do it, but it’ll be easier with help, and I’m real glad you asked,” Dean breathes, and his cheeks turn pink, bringing out his freckles. They part with a promise to meet again later in the week, once they’ve each had time to meet with some of the other buskers. Dean says he’ll check in frequently and Castiel assures him that he’ll look forward to hearing from him.
Charlie’s son, Anson, is named for
“Was it Cas? Please tell me it was Cas.”
“Oh, Chuck’s not a busker! He’s my boyfriend. He plays for the folks here that we take care of. I own the place, inherited it from my mom when she passed away. Your exhibit sounds fascinating, by the way. I’m sure Chuck would be happy to participate,” Becky supplies in one breath. Dean isn’t sure he follows half of what she says and is afraid they won’t get a word in edgewise, but Castiel seems to have woken up a bit and offers Becky a business card from his messenger bag.
“Becky Rosen,” the woman titters in a high, enthused tone. “How can I help you, gentlemen?” She leads them toward the edge of the parking lot, closer to the park where several large trees shade them. Castiel has clammed up, so Dean carries the conversation for them, explaining the exhibit and concluding with their desire to meet with Chuck for an interview.
"Yeah, Sammy," he replies, opening the door to three of Sam's students. Each one sits on chairs lining the hallway, books open in their laps, scribbling away in notebooks. One looks past Dean into Sam's office and gives him a radiant smile.
Pastor David Gideon lights the first purple candle nestled within the evergreen wreath atop his dining table. He sits in the single chair and opens his Holy Book to Revelations, reciting a passage that gives him great strength when pondering the fate God has set upon him.
Castiel has dressed up in his customary Moondoor Knight attire: knee-high leather boots, brown cotton breeches, and a maroon vest-like tunic with the Moondoor crest embroidered over his heart, worn over a long sleeve blouse. He’ll don heavy leather shoulder pads for the upcoming battle and wears a wooden sword in his leather belt.
“How's the new exhibit coming along?” Anael asks around lunchtime.
It is splendid on its perch, despotizing over all who set eyes upon it. For if the Winchesters had turned the crate around, they would have found the side label that warned:
“That’s not what I meant."
Dean pulls the bumblebee picture from his pocket and realizes, as he hands it over to Sam, that his song for Blue Eyes has outside influences.  He's immediately disappointed that he hasn't created something truly unique for him. He hasn't told Sam yet, that the man might be something more. More than just someone putting money in a case, enjoying the music at face value.
Antlers tangling in the overhead lights and rear end knocking over a bookcase. In hindsight, perhaps giving Sam a cursed firearm from the Men of Letters’ box of junk wasn’t the best idea. But when you wait until Christmas Eve to get your giant baby brother a gift, what the hell do you expect, really? As Sammoose turns to charge Dean, fire in his eyes, he thinks maybe another skin mag from the Gas ‘n Sip would’ve sufficed.
“Demonic squirrel, maybe?”
“Indeed,” Castiel imparts. “We were hoping you might want to break for lunch.”
He’s walking to one of the cafes on campus to pick up their food when his phone buzzes twice in his back pocket. He swipes over the screen and pulls down his notifications menu, tapping on Her Majesty and opening his text thread with Charlie.
“I almost forgot, there’s a girl a coupla streets over, real rock vibe, but plays the ukulele.  You should really interview her for the exhibit.”
“Thank you for agreeing to help, Ms. Rosen. Do you mind if we wait for Chuck’s show to end? We’d like to ask him a few questions.”
“I figured out the exhibit.”
“I did. There’s candles in there, too. I thought we could take it upstairs,” he suggests fishing the candles from the bag while Charlie unboxes the cake. “I’m not supposed to tell you, but everyone’s waiting to surprise you. Anael coordinated everything, I’m the ‘cake guy’ as she put it.”
“Is that your man?” she comments, knowing full-well the implication of her words.
Anson runs shrieking to Castiel and wraps himself around his knees, nearly toppling him over into Dean who rescues the canvas bag from Castiel so that he can scoop the boy up into his arms. Charlie leads Dean through the house to the kitchen to set up the snacks Castiel brought, and Castiel tries to translate Anson’s baby babble.
“Yes. There’s a man, Dean Winchester, who performs at the transit station I take into work each day. I asked him for lunch, to get his perspective on street performers as modern-day bards.”
All that, plus the bus ride to Continental, and Dean still finds himself at the café well before their scheduled time, too keyed up for a sit-down interview. He decides a walk around the block will help burn off his excess energy and heads away from the museum, not willing to risk running into Castiel before he’s ready. The streets are nice this close to campus, and he’s blissfully alone on his walk, thoughts of Castiel with his blue eyes and his morning tips bouncing through his brain. He feels empty without the weight of his mother’s guitar on his back but is thankful to move unburdened in the afternoon heat. The marine layer had burned off around the time he texted Castiel, and the sun shines hot on him.
They make their way to the main entrance and Castiel continues, “I’ll send you questions once I get back to my desk, and thank you for today, and all your help. I’m not sure I could do it alone.”
When they meet at the transit station, Castiel watches Dean do a double-take and he isn’t sure why, but he smiles to himself, all the same, placing his coffee change in the guitar case and making plans to meet at the museum at noon. The song Dean plays while he awaits his bus is lovely and he recognizes the feeling of it, if not the tune itself. He boards the bus feeling warm all over and hums it for the remainder of his journey.
“Merry Christmas, Sammy!”
He has had a very hard time keeping his eyes on anything but Dean. Dean, who has managed to pour himself into leather breeches, a loose brown tunic layered over a linen blouse, the sleeves of which are pushed up by buckled bracers protecting his forearms, and dear lord, the chainmail, draped so casually over his shoulders. He’s an actual dream if Castiel’s honest with himself.
