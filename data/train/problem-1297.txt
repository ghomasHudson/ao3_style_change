“I think I'm going to go ahead and leave, Mary.”
“Guess she isn't as unreliable as everyone says, then. You seen him since you've been back? Sherlock, I mean?”
Sherlock said nothing, but John thought his expression softened some, lost a little of its high-contrast harshness. John watched as he took one slow, deep breath.
"Then you have to let me do your stitches, because that laceration is a nasty one. I won't have you getting an infection on my watch."
The world fell out from under him, but he forced himself to keep walking, grateful that Sherlock had slowed down. He shoved his hands in his pockets and stared at the ground in front of him. “It's a city at night, I think.” When he finally mustered the nerve to look back at Sherlock, he realized that he probably hadn't ever taken his eyes off the sky.
Molly held up her hands in surrender, but all through the morning, even though she was working quietly on her own, Sherlock could almost feel all the things she was resisting saying.
KR: That would make
Molly signed off on some paperwork before leaving, and as soon as she was out the door, Sherlock was standing in his usual spot by the head of John's bed, looking down at him, hands shoved in his pockets. He couldn't seem to look at John for long. His eyes were darting nervously around the room, never settling on any one place.
She smiled. “He was a bit of a flirt, to tell you the truth. He would talk about buying me jewelry if he ever had that kind of income. And sometimes when he would talk like that he would say things like, 'Since I might not ever have that kind of money, I should just give you this.' ” She picked the ring up, turning it around in her hand. “It became a sort of joke with us, about this ring. It was the only article of jewelry he owned as far as I know. I'll check and see if his family wants it.”
Greg Lestrade's face dominated the screen as John watched backstage. He smiled broadly, waving at the audience, the lights reflecting off the metallic silver in his hair. He spoke excitedly to the people, his enthusiasm making them cheer louder and louder. He had always been a favorite host, though Sherlock had muttered something about him being “rather like a dull slapstick policeman.” His opinion was the minority one, of course. Lestrade was a bright spot in this mess. The way he played it, you could almost believe that the tributes really were just having a cozy little chat with him, instead of being displayed like cattle.
Lestrade tried to call John as well, but after hesitating, John clicked the “decline call” button and shoved his phone in his pocket. How would he even begin to explain all this to Lestrade, anyway?
There was a pointed silence on the other end of the line. John knew she would be sitting in her office, psychoanalyzing him. He reached out to still the cradle, and only then did Ella speak again.
“Isn't he sweet? I can see why you like having him around. But then, people do get so sentimental about their pets.”
“Who won?”
on his face, that wonderful one that always preceded his most impressive deductions. “Wenceslas was desperate for something to draw people to her gallery, very desperate.”
“All that stuff you said to Lestrade.”
“In its way, the life was fun,” Sherlock said. “More so the younger we were. But you're right. It does get...tiring.” Sherlock stared off into space, distracted, his face smooth as marble. After a moment, he shook his head and downed the rest of his drink.
“Yeah, he doesn't really like being in the news spotlight, really.”
Before he could back away and leave, the door opened. John wasn't sure what he had been expecting, but it wasn't the little old lady standing inside in the shadows. She was the human personification of a cozy kitchen, cookies baking in the oven. But she also looked like she hadn't slept much more than John had in the last few days.
"I've been thinking," John said.
Sherlock ran his hand over the arm rest of his chair, despising having nothing else to fidget with. “Then you tell me.”
“Who did you rope in this time?” Sherlock asked, glancing back down at a page in his book.
“Don't even
“Street? Christ, John, why not here
“I'm sorry?”
It wasn't that she wasn't fun to be around. In fact, when she'd first started working at the clinic with him, it was one of the first times he'd caught himself laugh at anything since returning from Rome. But Mary was still somehow part of a different world than he was, which admittedly was true for most of his coworkers and acquaintances. There was the regular workaday world they all inhabited, and then there was the Baker Street world that John couldn't bring himself to leave. Mixing the two in any way seemed to carry with it a sense that the world would collapse if the two ever met. And it might have. Somehow that felt like such a real possibility that John continued to keep Mary away from Baker Street, even if only so he wouldn't have to explain why he had left all of Sherlock's things in their proper places so long after he'd died.
John looked back and forth between them, his face filled with suspicion before he asked, “What are you going to do, Sally?”
.” Sherlock couldn't even explain to himself why he'd left the house, and merely for cigarettes,
“Is it too fast for you?” John explained further, “I don’t know what you want, not really, and I’m afraid of going too fast, or too slow, or in the wrong direction, or in the wrong order. I’ve made such a mess of things in the past. I’m terrified of making the wrong move now. You want to get back with me against my advice, and I love that about you, but you are going to have to take the lead on this, Sherlock. I’m in no place to make decisions like this for you. All I can do is follow along and hope I don’t hurt you too much.”
.” It made him feel good to make Danny smile, and it felt good to smile back. Sherlock hadn’t had a good reason to smile for a very long time, but like everything else, it was easy to do with Danny.
John took another round of tablets and allowed himself to be taken away chemically, sleeping in his tuxedo and shoes, simply unwilling to be awake when the world wasn’t where he wanted to be any longer. He needed his rest, at any rate. His presentation was in the morning, and he needed to be ready for it.
“Well,
John was losing it just like he was losing Sherlock. His lover would not survive, already, Sherlock’s heart was stuttering out its last beats. The detective was trying to breathe but his body was in shock and was shutting down.
He didn’t let go, not even after the tree topper was securely in place. Sherlock stood there with John standing behind him, holding him firmly. He smiled and closed his eyes as he allowed John to take the next step, the final step he’d been waiting for. John did not disappoint. Sherlock felt their bodies meet as John stepped closer still, pressing himself against Sherlock’s back, his hips neatly meeting Sherlock’s backside. John’s hands slid forward and up, slowly but firmly exploring across Sherlock’s belly and chest, “Okay?”
. Instead, he threw the deadbolt on the door and tugged all the curtains tightly closed. Once he was securely locked away, Sherlock made himself a cup of tea, changed into his most comfortable pyjamas, settled himself in his bedroom, and got high.
Sherlock’s body was already reacting to the claiming bite, as was John’s. John turned the shower on so that his omega was drenched in extremely warm water and left Sherlock standing there naked. John ran to the front door and locked it tight. He ran right back up their stairs and locked their flat door as well. John checked all the windows, making sure they were closed and secure. When he was done, he grabbed up all the bottled water he could find as well as all the packets of snacks he normally kept on hand for his bagged lunches. Once his preparations were complete, John raced back to the shower to see how Sherlock was progressing.
Sherlock was stuck on one word.
“Obviously, John!” Sherlock glared at his lover, “Who else would I love? Who else has the power to hurt me so easily except for you, John? Everyone saw how you can break me with a single word. No other being in existence can claim that. No one in my entire life has mattered more to me than you.”
John was aghast and at the same time unsurprised at how badly this was going.
“We need to shower,” John felt sticky, “It itches now.” They were covered in dried semen and slick. The air in their room had the distinctive pong of sex, and now that the musk of it was going stale, they were becoming aware of the urgent need to clean up and air the place out.
5:30 am –
. He and Sherlock were not exactly
“Talk to him. Work things out.” Mycroft sighed and sounded exhausted. “I judged him as harshly as you did, brother mine, so let us give him the chance now that we did not then.”
Dryly, the elder Holmes said, “Yes, I’d heard about Miss Morstan, though I was surprised that you’d chosen a beta.” Mycroft quickly changed the conversation’s direction, “If you are certain that you are willing to provide Sherlock with medical care I will dispatch one of my people to bring you whatever supplies you require. If I can get away, I will be there myself.” John rattled off a list that included pain-relievers, anti-inflammatories, emergency oral birth-control, and alpha condoms. “My, my, my, Doctor Watson, you are full of surprises.”
When he was ready, he popped in to ask Mrs Hudson if she needed anything and to give both she and Rosie a kiss on the head, John took himself to the store to resupply the flat with necessities. He needed to take a cab home and paid the young man an exorbitant tip to help pack everything up to the kitchen. Sherlock was out of nearly everything, including cleaning supplies, but after John was done unpacking his contributions, every nook and cranny was once again containing what it was supposed to from bog-rolls all the way to new bandages. The fridge didn’t even have experiments in it, so John took the opportunity to do a decontamination before loading up the veg, cheeses, spreads, cold-cuts, and a good-sized container of milk, as well as an assortment of juices, into the upper portions of it, leaving the lowest shelf and both crispers free for Sherlock’s potential things. The bread box was excavated of its backlog of old crumbs and re-filled with soft bread-rolls, and a seed covered loaf of multi-grain bread that Rosie enjoyed when toasted.
“I did intimate that I knew someone powerful.” Sherlock pointed out gently. Danny was gripping his hand and he seemed upset. Sherlock realized then that Danny must have been shown someone else’s clandestine operations, operations that likely had only confirmed what he’d hoped was not true. “Mycroft
Just then, the handsome man from the night before materialised, “Hi there, I’ve been looking for you all over.” John was shocked and horrified when the man leaned in and kissed Sherlock on the mouth. The sudden drop from anticipation to jealous disappointment was sickening, and John couldn’t be there.
Lestrade asked him personally.
It was. Sherlock was fascinated. He recognised the locking system. It was based on the ancient Bramah locks of centuries past, with very modern improvements. He diverted himself for the rest of the ride to consider how it might be possible to pick the theoretically unpickable locks that had sealed the entryways. “Someone must have a copy of the key,” he murmured to himself.
Sherlock was deeply touched all over again.
Their routine was set. Each day, biological samples were taken, doses were administered, all before they were brought out to fight again. The team referred to him as
.” The man paused, “We’re guinea pigs. The people who have us are using us for a human trial, a very illegal one. It’s going to sound ludicrous but they’re attempting to create supersoldiers.”
A thread of distress was re-entering Sherlock’s scent, “Mycroft, what can I do?”
Sherlock could see that John was hiding something more and simply turned his face away to sob into his brother’s shoulder. John could smell that Sherlock’s physical health had returned but that his emotional state was in tatters. John’s knees quivered for a moment and his chest throbbed. “You
. Sherlock could never forgive him for this presumption. He’d made himself clear right from the start. He’d said…
have for me. It’s over, Watson. You’ve moved on with efficient ease so leave me out of whatever conscience motivated drivel you are attempting. I
They rushed up the stairs, Sherlock nearly dragging John by his hand. The detective only stumbled on his heels once, but John was right there to keep him steady. Laughing softly with one another, Sherlock led John right to his bedroom where a neatly made bed and a less-than-discreet and a rather large container of lubricant awaited them, “Did you really think I was that sure of a bet?” John faked his outrage.
, and don’t pretend you don’t know what that is, all things considered.” John watched Sherlock blush right down to his neck, dropping his gaze to his own knees. Danny reached over, “It’s okay, just, think a bit more, okay?”
Our room. John’s face broke into a teary smile, “Upstairs or downstairs?”
,” the detective groaned deeply before guiltily adding,
Sherlock kissed her head all over making loud smacking noises and Rosie giggled, whacking Sherlock’s shoulder with a spoon affectionately before kissing his cheek and throttling his neck with a hug. “Eat!” Rosie whacked him with a spoon again, “Eat, eat, eat!”
“Yes, John.” Sherlock placidly followed his lover to the shower and stood there while John washed them both from head to foot. He couldn’t bother himself, too high on endorphins still, but John didn’t seem to mind. He was happy, content, and sated in a way he’d never experienced in his life and it was all because of John. “I love you.”
John stared, “You insult me all the time!”
John fumbled for tissue in his pocket. At least as a parent, he always had supplies on him, not that he spent much time with Rosie.
John and he couldn’t just decorate the flat and then try to re-surprise John with a tree later. He compromised and had purchased an artificial tree that came with fibre-optic lights built in. John’s shift wasn’t a full one and he knew he wouldn’t have time to fuss with stringing lights.
Sherlock looked down at him solemnly for a long time, silently considering John’s words. John’s knees hurt as he knelt, but he’d stay there until he died if that’s what Sherlock wanted. Mycroft didn’t need to bother looming threateningly behind John, but the doctor supposed it gave the older man something to do while they both waited for Sherlock’s decision, “How do I trust you, John? You made promises to others and broke them. You made promises to me and you broke those too. Your word doesn’t seem to mean much, so how do I know?”
They kissed for a long time. Eventually, John pulled away enough to ask, “Why?”
Sherlock was already two bites in before he realized that Danny was being truthful. He hated raisins yet here he was, loving the odd sandwich he was wolfing down. Danny looked proud and John looked ill as they finished their sandwiches silently. When he was done eating, Sherlock said, “You are a miraculous cook.”
Sherlock tried to smile but his face was as sore as the rest of him. He felt lightheaded as if he could drift right up to the ceiling from the emotional buoyancy.
Sherlock came back to himself the moment John’s mouth covered his.
“We’ll figure things out.” Sherlock was confident. Sherlock cleared his evidence board of the last case he’d worked and began to lay out Danny’s story. They used his laptop to search out images and names, printing off articles, and clues, stringing them together with coloured threads until the board was full once again. “It’s a start.” Sherlock kissed his lover, “Let’s eat. Mrs Hudson says we need
, Johnny. Do you want to be the one who breaks Sherlock, who destroys his spirit as much as you wreck his body? I left Clara for a reason. I never hit her, but I came close. The words I used hurt her as much as physical violence might have, I’m so sickened with myself. I’m going to therapy to get help and Clara’s willing to work things out with me, so
Mycroft was waiting for them at the flat. Not bothering to address John directly, he asked, “Any changes?” Sherlock shook his head despondently and Mycroft heaved a worried sigh, “It’s worse than we thought. Not only is Ms Moran exactly who we thought she was, but it seems that her contract has not expired or elapsed.”
Several professionals and experts examined his back, bum, and legs before he was finally allowed to sit up. It did not feel good, not at all, so Sherlock was allowed to stand. Sherlock appreciated how his best friend always managed remain right within eye-shot no matter how many other doctors were in the room. It comforted him greatly and kept him from becoming too agitated. The crowd of specialists that regularly attended him eventually reached the consensus that Sherlock could be released into John’s care by the end of the next week, providing that there weren’t any complications for finally being ambulatory.
Sherlock was sitting on the edge of his bed and he looked anxious. He took a long look at the expression on John’s face before he shuttered all his emotions away, “You don’t want to do this.” John’s mouth opened but nothing came out.
John looked hurt and even a touch offended. “I didn’t think you had,” he protested. John opened his mouth to say something more, but it was clear to Sherlock that he changed his mind and said something else entirely, “You missed your last round of meds. They need to be taken with food.”
He moved on to paperwork. Sherlock loathed handling paper if it wasn’t evidence, and sure enough, when John went through the substantial pile on the desk, he located several cheques that had not been deposited, as well as several bills that had not been paid. Digging out his own cheque-book, John squared away Sherlock’s utilities and gas, paid up their trash removal, and wrote Mrs Hudson a large cheque to cover various damages to the kitchen as well as his portion of the rent for the next three months. Once he’d hand-delivered that, and posted the rest, John took his daughter to the bank to deposit Sherlock’s earnings into the mutual account they’d shared since John had first moved in. He was surprised but gratified to learn that it was still open for them both.
John’s face was a mix of anger, disbelief, shame, outrage, and finally, blankness, “I’ve never cheated on you, Sherlock. You are being ridiculous. That you think I’d ever cheat on someone I’m with...”
Sherlock’s promise was heartfelt.
does it, why shouldn’t I, so I did. A lot. I went to clubs, bars, anywhere I might meet someone for the night. I didn’t really care who they were as long as they wanted to fuck. I didn’t care where, either. Got into a bit of bother with the police on several occasions, enough to worry Mycroft. I stopped after a few months because by then I’d talked myself back into drugs and I didn’t need sex. I left the country and partied my way across the continent. I eventually made my way back to France, and that’s where Mycroft found me. He cleaned me up like he used to, registered me in a discrete facility, and let me dry out without his usual complement of lectures.”
It took until Mary gasped the words, “It’s you!” that he finally looked up.
rose fiercely inside John’s heart.
. Leave. Let me bleed in peace. I don’t want you here. Go.” John could still smell blood and he grew confused at Sherlock’s demands. How could he leave when Sherlock was so hurt and in need? John felt remorse over his reactions of just yesterday and was paralyzed with indecision. “Why won’t you just leave?”
hurt you like that again. I will never raise my hand against you, all I want to do is spend the rest of my days trying to make up for the purely awful way I’ve behaved. I would like to know if I still have the privilege of calling you my best friend. I would understand if I can't, not after... there are no excuses. I am a complete and utter shit and we all know it. I’m going to be better from now on, for your sake, for Rosie, and maybe one day, even for myself.”
“Exactly.”
He fell into a fitful half-doze and was brought back to consciousness by the fragrant scent of tea. He felt a gentle hand card through his hair. The caress seemed to brush away some of the unpleasant tension and Sherlock relaxed. John’s voice was full of affection, “You look like shite, come on, see if you can sit up and have a bit of this.”
“What? No! Why would you...that’s not what I meant at all!”
Danny just went off to do as he’d said, leaving Sherlock and John sitting in silence. Rosie yawned, and John realized that he had the perfect excuse to leave, “Well, it looks like she’s finally ready for bed.”
“Say that again?”
John wasn’t foolish enough to believe that Sherlock was inexperienced, and he wasn’t wrong, “Never been ravaged, love oral sex, I’m an unrepentant bottom, and when I’ve decided to do so, I like to fuck hard and often.” John’s erection began to make a distinct showing, especially upon hearing Sherlock swear, something he almost never did. “I haven’t been active since I was at school last, but while I was there, I did enjoy a large selection of casual lovers. I’ve tried everything I could think of, so really John, do whatever you like most, I’ll enjoy it.”
It was annoying at first to have his libido activated without his permission, but his mastery over his transport had always been a work in progress, not that he wanted to stop letting it lose control right now, not when it meant that
fixing it, it just takes time. It takes longer to change the minds of the hidebound than it takes to draw up perfectly simple universal marriage legislation.” He glanced over at John, “You could always just continue living in sin.”
John didn’t wait for a second longer. If Sherlock wanted to bond then he needed to be in heat. If he was bitten, then a heat would follow almost immediately. John could bite him a second time during their first knot to seal them together, and that’s what he planned to do. With lightning speed, John darted forward and sank his teeth into Sherlock’s neck. Sherlock yelped and tried to jerk away instinctively but John had him in a powerful embrace, holding the omega tight until Sherlock slumped over, unresisting and compliant. John scooped him up into his arms and carried Sherlock to the loo where he stood him back up again in the shower. He knew what was coming, and it would be easiest to deal with there.
John looked at Sherlock and smiled gently, “I worry about you, Sherlock. I want to protect you, to keep you safe. You live dangerously and I’d never stop you but you were gone from me for three entire years and I missed you so much. You might disappear again. You might have no choice about it. It would tear me up all over again to lose you but if you had these things, maybe you’d be a bit safer, maybe there’d be a better chance of you coming back to me. I just want you to come back to me, no matter what.”
John felt almost like he needed to cry. This entire evening was so much more than he could ever have expected and he was awash with emotions. Sherlock was kissing him once more and it was difficult to do more than feel exultant over that fact. What he wasn’t expecting was for Sherlock to pull away with an expression of deep regret nor to hear Sherlock say, “I know you miss Mary, and I’m not trying to replace her. All I can hope for is that someday I might be able to approach her in the degree of regard you hold.”
“He deserves it, Johnny! He’s a fucking selfish prick, and you’re too good for him.” John was nearly there but not quickly enough to stop his sister from kicking Sherlock’s face, since he was conveniently bent over. With a grunt, Sherlock collapsed on the pavements, his nose bleeding, and his throat burning from accidentally re-swallowing that which he’d tried to expel. He also managed to land one hand directly over the broken Petri dishes, gashing his palm several times. He stared at his own blood in shock, “You really are a fucking
The rest of Christmas passed in a pleasantly chaotic manner. The Holmes cousins only lingered long enough to confirm that none of their names had been newly added Sieger’s will before departing. John had been toasted many times, the cousins barely bothering to conceal their amazement that their prickly younger relative had managed to find someone who could tolerate his extremes enough to actually bind themselves to him. John remained silent on the matter, but inwards, he vowed more than ever to be the best husband Sherlock could ever dream of having.
It was Sherlock who brought things to a head, as it were. Mornings were becoming a bit of an issue now that he was consistently waking up in a completely tumescent state. At first, he was able to ignore his need, willing his unwanted erection away. He’d never had much of a sex drive, and usually managed to find time in the past to masturbate whenever his body refused to demand it. In his current situation, he didn’t know how to deal with them. Wanking in bed was out of the question. He could do it in the shower, but John would almost certainly come to check on him if he began to moan and moan he would. He’d always been a bit noisy, restricting his private time to hours when the flat was otherwise empty. Unfortunately, these days John never left him alone long enough to have a bit of a sneaky wank, and after four consecutive days of a growing and continually unsatisfied need, Sherlock was getting a bit desperate. This morning, his cock was thick, throbbing, and almost pulsing with frustrated desire. Without thinking, Sherlock reached down and gave himself a sleepy stroke, exhaling roughly as a shiver of pleasure rippled through him.
.” Sherlock couldn’t help but notice how Danny’s body went tense, “When I heard what happened to him, I was deeply saddened. Now, fortuitously, my little brother presents me with someone who is equally put out by Scottie’s passing. I assume it is you who is supposed to be living in his house, now that he is gone. Curious how those pesky legal issues are keeping you from taking residence, as is your right.”
Sherlock took a quick shower. He found another pair of pyjamas waiting for him and to his surprise, they were the correct size. Pulling the soft cotton over his body, he padded barefoot to the kitchen where Mrs Hudson was serving pancakes, “Good morning, Sherlock!” She was cheerful and unperturbed when John made Sherlock kneel beside him to be hand-fed from John’s own plate. Sherlock had never eaten so much food in his entire life and he felt bloated and uncomfortable. “I’m kind of proud of you, Sherlock. It can’t be easy to be where you are but you’re taking it all so well.” Sherlock heaved a sigh of relief when John affixed a new nicotine patch to his arm, relaxing as the chemicals began to sooth him. “I’m going to be gone all day, so as soon as you’ve gone to the bathroom, I want you to douche yourself clean. After that, I want you to wear the plug I have left for you in our bedroom. There’s lube in the top drawer. No orgasms! Put it in and leave yourself alone. I won’t be back until six tonight and I’m going to want to fuck you the second I get home. Be in bed and waiting because even if you don’t use the plug, I’m fucking you. Understood?”
his belongings from Baker Street, and though it made him tear up once more, Sherlock was grateful. He’d never have to face John if he didn’t want to, and he most certainly did not want to.
stood next to Sherlock as if that were his natural place, and John left quietly, knowing he had no right to remain.
Sherlock was able to totter to the loo on his own, and with relief, evacuated his bowel and bladder in turn. He ached but it wasn’t impossible to move about. The doctor agreed, and with very little argument, wrote Sherlock a script for pain relievers, and signed him out. Anthea arrived moments later bearing a garment bag. Inside was a brand-new suit from a tailor that kept their measurements on hand. Mycroft must have ordered him a new suit as a gift when he moved away from Baker Street. She waited discretely in the hallway while the nurse helped him dress, then drove him slowly back to his brother. Sherlock scowled, “Why didn’t you come to the hospital?”
John was shaking his head in denial. “We weren’t. I thought he was a beta, we couldn’t bond.”
hurt, and he wondered if the awful feeling would ever subside. It didn’t seem to be diminishing at all. He loved John Watson and he always would, he knew it. Leaving John had been the right choice, he knew that too, but the separation was destroying him piece at a time. Sherlock felt torn in two. He couldn’t go back to John, no matter how desperately he wanted to. There was no easy fix, no fix at all, nothing. It was just...over.
. “My name is Sherlock Holmes, you may have heard of me. I’m a consulting detective.”
John smiled and laughed softly, reaching up to kiss Sherlock’s lips. “This afternoon, I promise. You can finger me, suck me, penetrate me, whatever you want.”
Sherlock felt cold inside, and without realizing what he was doing, spelled it all out for John who sat there with a look of astonishment on his face, “Do you want me to go check anything out?” offered the doctor instantly, “I can see if I can treat some of the ones who haven’t made it to hospital, or at least, get them there if they’re ailing.”
“Unless you’re in the mood for something different?”
. John loathed his own unworthy response to Sherlock’s incredible sacrifice. “What can I do?”
Sherlock looked at him with narrowed eyes, “No one says
“Mary wasn’t my bond-mate, she’s a beta, we were going to get married,” John began to explain.
. It made Sherlock feel good.
times a day and say goodnight to before you go to bed with me, and to whom you send a morning greeting after you leave me in that same bed.” John and Sherlock had finally become lovers and had spent the last three months feeling their way toward greater intimacy and commitment, or Sherlock had presumed. Clearly, he was wrong. “You can’t date us both, John. I deserve better than that.”
The warped and nonsensical tradition of enticing a romantic kiss from someone by standing beneath it,
John once again did as he was told. His eyes fluttered shut as a very particular scent filled his nose and suddenly, it was as if he could read a symphony in the notes he detected. He knew this scent, lived around it every day but never had he taken the time to understand what it was made of. John knew the taste and the nuances of this scent, it told tales of travels to far lands, of pain and isolation, of curiosity and abiding passion. It reminded John of the complexity of vanilla, the resinous aroma of pine, the odd sting of something sourly astringent that only caused the rest of it to be that much sweeter. John knew the deep musky undertones, the dark burning spice of it, foreign and familiar at the same time. It was home and it was dangerous and it was everything John craved. He opened his eyes and stared at Sherlock, “You’re amazing.”
“Yes, John.” Sherlock’s entire body was agony. His skin felt like he’d been flayed alive and his arse burned from the lack of lube.
Another message arrived. “I apologise. I’d forgotten that I’d promised myself not to let you know that I’d tried on all your clothing one afternoon when I was bored. Your legs are longer than they seem, just so you know, the hem of your kilt suits my height well.”
. We will fuck when I want to fuck, and you will never say no to what I want to do. You will do whatever I ask, whenever I ask it. You will be mine alone, trained to please only me, so don't think that you will ever know what it's like to be with another man or even a woman. I own you. You are, in every sense of the word,
Sherlock’s eyes were still bright from the laughter they’d shared over their food, and he nodded without hesitation, “That would be perfect. I probably shouldn’t have had afters. I’m going to need to upgrade my wardrobe again, and I’ve already done that once this year.” Sherlock looked a bit uncomfortable and John recollected the many times Sherlock had mocked his brother for putting on a bit of weight. Neither man was anywhere near fat, but both of them seemed incredibly conscious of their exterior appearance.
Mycroft became a daily visitor, grimly exchanging information with his agitated younger brother. The car that had followed John had not been one of his. The facial recognition software they used turned up nothing on any of the people that had been watching them, and that was a clue all on its own. Sherlock discovered that they acquired a staff, all thoroughly vetted by Mycroft and then again, by Anthea. To keep things relatively calm, Sherlock and Danny communicated with their staff electronically because Sherlock really did prefer to text. The team quickly learned that under no circumstances was Sherlock allowed face-to-face contact with them since the consulting detective had already ripped two of them to emotional shreds when they’d had unadvisedly reproached him for how he went about examining information. His stress-induced attacks helped no one, and they didn’t have time to continuously vet new members, especially since their case was so very complicated now.
Sherlock inhaled sharply at the tone.
It was divine.
. That’s the reason the rest of us get married, because we can’t do that.” The government official didn’t look very sorry. He looked annoyed but then, anyone who was being forced to say no to Sherlock Holmes wasn’t going to be enjoying themselves. “You could form a civil partnership but again, being alpha and omega means that you’ll be legally responsible for each other’s material possessions but that’s about it, it’s not even as binding as CVs between other gender combinations because it allows for the agreements to break the moment you bond with someone else. Again, your ability to bond circumvents the legal code that applies to everyone else.”
Sherlock stood up, his too thin pyjamas clinging to his also too thin body. “Unacceptable, John! We have the same blood-type! We’ve given each other blood more than once! What if you get an infection? What happens to me? Do I just get to die from lack of blood when I need it, all because of your incessant need for meaningless sex?”
For the first time, regret hit him like a tonne of bricks.
This time their cab had no other destination but home, but Sherlock wasn’t disappointed. The garlands and ornaments were welcoming instead of garish and off-putting, and their flat smelled like vanilla cookies and joyfulness. When they entered their flat, John laughed and pointed to their entryway. Mrs Hudson had strung up a large mistletoe on a bright red ribbon and they were both standing beneath it, “Yeah?”
The soldier grinned and Sherlock grinned back as best he could, wracked with paroxysms of pleasure as he was. The small man had been fucking Sherlock for over an hour already and the orgasm Sherlock had experienced was more spectacular than any he’d enjoyed in a very long time, if ever. Without taking a break, the man kept fucking Sherlock through the delightful wave of feeling and kept going. Another hour passed before Sherlock was shouting his way through another orgasm. The soldier came too, but didn’t stop, didn’t slow. He was indefatigable. Sherlock was determined to get him off, now riding the man for all he was worth, using every trick at his disposal to make the man come.
John didn’t get much time to prepare. Though he hadn’t meant to drift off, the early hours of the morning, John startled himself awake. The air was rich with pheromones and instinctively, John sought out the source. He found Sherlock now laying in the centre of his bed, his body writhing, his face flushed, his skin dewy with sweat. “Breed me, alpha.” Sherlock’s voice was husky and deep as he made his demands. “I want it to be you, John.”
John felt misgivings bubbling up. How could he get out of this? Sherlock looked...bubbly. It made John feel sick inside because he knew he was the source of Sherlock’s happiness, and it was stressful. It was just a matter of time before he did something or said something that would wipe that pleased expression off Sherlock’s face.
John made Sherlock sit up and drink the entire glass. When they were done, John got Sherlock tucked into bed. The doctor surprised him by sliding naked under the covers with him, spooning up to Sherlock’s back, and holding him tight, “John?” The sensation was as overwhelming as the almost-sex had been. John seemed to be plastered against him like living armour and it was nice.
John seemed to see Sherlock everywhere that day. He was always on the edge of John’s peripheral vision or walking past in one direction or another. He didn’t seem to spend time with any particular person, the detective just drifted around, exchanging a few words here or there, but otherwise not involving himself in any of the many intense conversations that had blossomed. They were even signed up for many of the same lectures, though John often didn’t know it until the end because Sherlock always sat behind him somewhere.
Danny strolled casually beside Sherlock and looked prouder than ever of himself. “See? Jealous and
Danny’s eyes danced, and with another cheeky wink he looked right over at John and said, “I’m his boyfriend. He’s told me a lot about you, hi John, I’m Danny.” Sherlock almost reeled with shock when Danny wrapped a thin arm about Sherlock’s waist, leaning in and whispering into his ear, “Play along, it will drive him crazy.”
“I didn’t even say good morning, either, I was chatting up someone online.” He felt so much shame and regret and he knew his sister was glaring at him.  “I just needed to be with someone, anyone. I’m so lonely.”
. Sherlock looked around, but the streetlights were mostly useless, all the buildings mere insubstantial shadows, the streets, completely empty and devoid of both name or number to differentiate them.
“What do you mean?”
It was Christmas Eve. He and Sherlock Holmes were about to celebrate their very first Christmas together after years and months of misery, angst, misunderstandings, death, grievous injury, and general pain. John had originally planned to go endure the holidays with his sister but she’d run off to the Bahamas with her latest girlfriend, cancelling his visit with her via a call from the airport, and leaving him high and dry for the holiday season.
. It could hardly compare. John had other regrets now as well. The apology part had come off far more stilted than he’d planned, certain confessions went unsaid due to the audience, and John fretted that Sherlock wouldn’t understand John’s penitence for what it was. The detective’s reactions had left John feeling jittery and strung-tight. He needed to get control over himself, fast.
The worry melted away, “Good. John. Good, very good. You’re so much more coherent now answer my question, what do you see?”
Instead of filling out the fancy card meant for the purpose, Sherlock withdrew his mobile and in unusual fashion, called his mother, “Mummy!”
John.” Sherlock’s cries were filled with sorrow as well as longing. It made John feel a jumble of hidden emotions deep inside of himself begin to unravel. He knew what Sherlock thought he had lost.
I don’t understand.” Mrs Hudson looked as devastated as Sherlock felt.
Sherlock’s actually an omega but I didn’t know that until recently. He’s been hiding his true nature to enable him to live his life as he pleases, and not under the expectations made of omegas. He never wanted to be pair-bonded with anyone.” She looked both disbelieving as well as sympathetic, but only for a moment, “I understand that now, but Sarah, when I thought he was dead, I would have given anything to have him back and him being a beta didn’t matter to me. That was the only reason I was with Mary because I thought if I could love a beta like Sherlock, then betas weren’t out of the question for me. We weren’t physically compatible,” Sarah blushed because she knew
John was loving every minute of the evening. Sherlock was one hundred percent focused on him, and it was fantastic to be the centre of such attention.

He didn’t know what else he could say. Anything he could think of just seemed lacking. John might have been a blogger who’d attracted some attention at one time but when it came to the spoken word, he’d often had to rely on speaking his mind in other ways. Moving slowly but purposefully, John moved until he was right in front of Sherlock, sinking to his knees, head down and to the side, baring his neck and submitting to the man he could never stop loving. Sherlock was shocked, “What are you doing?”
It made Sherlock miss their previous closeness even more and made him want to return to the drugs he was using so recently. There was no point wandering about. His thoughts weren’t any less muddled, so with a sigh, Sherlock returned to Baker Street.
“You love me?” Sherlock felt like his heart was going to implode. This was the last thing he expected. He knew that John cared for him, and that perhaps he even loved him but only as a friend. Instead, here he was, standing inside John’s embrace, with the taste of John in his mouth, and a declaration of love in his ears. “John?”
“Sherlock?” John sounded nervous.
Sherlock looked pensive and unsure, “John...I do not wish to exacerbate your issues. It is clearly too soon for you to engage in social activities outside of work. I’ll just call Mummy back...”
. His chest hurt enough to take his breath away. Possessive rage filled him for long seconds before John clawed it back enough to choke out the words, “Who is it? Whoever it is, needs to come here, immediately. You know what he’ll go through if he’s left alone.”
Currently, Mary was giggling her way through John’s blog. She’d never tried to look at it before but now she was sitting in bed reading bits out in funny voices and pointing out places where she thought the story had gone too far afield from believable. It was grating on John’s nerves, especially the comment about being his bestie. John cared for her deeply, but he didn’t have
“I’ve got the mobile,” John assured him, “And you won’t need your next round for four more hours.” Sherlock wasn’t allowed to medicate himself, one of the stricter rules he’d been made to live by in exchange for being released under only John’s supervision. “Mrs Hudson can help if we need to call her up.”
John was a terrible liar and Sherlock couldn’t bear it, “Shut up. Stop speaking. Leave. Now. Both of you.” John’s mouth snapped audibly shut. Donovan wasn’t so easily compelled, “Listen, we’ve got you for drugs, and for public indecency, and we’re going to throw in a disorderly as well because you were clearly fighting. You know what that means?” Donovan was just doing her job, Sherlock understood the facts only too clearly, “Your past records don’t leave us many choices, I’m sorry, Sherlock, really I am.”
Sherlock glared at his knees.

After shifting around and arranging blankets, both men were, for the lack of better descriptions, snuggling together beneath John’s quilt. Sherlock was wrapped around John, his arms and legs keeping him close. To John’s surprise, Sherlock fell asleep first, his soft snore reverberating against the back of his skull. It was familiar and soothing, and before he knew it, John’s eyes closed as his eyelids grew heavy. He faded off without a struggle, warm and loved.

John had one of his odd expressions on, one of the ones where he was emoting multiple things simultaneously. Sherlock had no idea how he did it, but his face-journeys never failed to captivate him, “I
. Sherlock shut his ears to John’s next words, walking swiftly away. He took his coat in his hand and fled down the stairs before anything John said made it through the temporary barrier he’d erected.
“Is that a no?”
It didn’t take long for Sherlock’s brain to connect the dots.
John smiled at Sherlock then left him alone for his call. He made it to the bathroom before the smile dropped from his face, and as quietly as he could manage, John heaved into the toilet. Mummy was
Shake shake shake. “Scarf.”
oozing
John realized now that some eager people were gathered near the entrance to the banquet hall and were attempting to overhear what they were saying. Flushing with embarrassment, John nodded quickly and allowed himself to be guided away. Sherlock took him to one of the small pubs that the hotel boasted and found them a small booth far in the back. Ordering quickly, he set down two mugs of ale, neither of which were touched by either man. Sherlock seemed to be gathering his thoughts and John’s nerve was breaking, “What do you want, Sherlock?”
They were at the door to their flat. John looked up and enjoyed the expression of contentment and satisfaction that graced Sherlock’s face. In no way was he expecting Sherlock to lean down and, with great thoroughness, kiss John until his thoughts were entirely muddled and his body was tense with expectation. “Sherlock?”
“Whatever it takes, John.” Sherlock nearly dragged him downstairs where he then forced John to sit on the floor in front of their small tree, “You first,” he demanded, “The device.”
This is the end of this particular experiment. I hope those who read it enjoyed it. Thank you for reading along, and stay tuned for my future endeavours to see my OTP happy once more.
“How’s that.” John was browsing the advertisements. The doctor was often amused by the items or services offered and made a point of reading through them frequently. “Sherlock?” John finally looked up.
“Mr Holmes is a man of highly discerning taste,” her tone was sharp and very nearly reproachful, “If there were a comment to be made in this regard, it should be restricted to that.”
“I only know of rumours, unsubstantiated stories, whispers.” Mycroft was trying to sound aloof, but all Sherlock heard was his guilt. “We keep one another’s secrets because knowing too much is the survival game of every empire.” Mycroft tried to pause again but something in Sherlock’s threatening silence kept him going, “Human trials.” He exhaled into the mobile, sounding exhausted and worn, “Baskerville was testing animals, and oddly enough, of all those spaces you have finally noticed, was the most…humane. John is not there, he is elsewhere.”
John was nervous. He normally wouldn’t be because, honestly, most of his romantic nights were one-offs, especially once his dates saw him with his pants off. He wasn’t ashamed, exactly, but he had learned through painful experience not to advertise what he lacked in the pants department. There had been a few girlfriends, and yes, a wife, who hadn’t minded. Eventually dissatisfied, all of them, especially the wife, had made more and more negative comments about the one body part he could not alter, leaving him insecure and reluctant.
“I don’t understand.”
Harry sat back and looked at her brother. “Can’t argue that.”
. Miserable, John smiled genially, and laughed at polite jokes, and played his role of happily dining guest. John was only pretending to eat, not that anyone was paying attention, all too busy chatting or tentatively flirting with one another. When the doctor eventually got up to leave, he caught Sherlock frowning in his direction. Embarrassed, John turned away and departed as quickly as he could.
Mrs Hudson was beside herself with joy, making off with Rosie only seconds after John arrived. John directed the assistants to the downstairs flat where they stored half the bins he’d brought with him and carried the remainder up to his old room. Sherlock re-assembled Rosie’s cot in record time while Danny un-bagged her linens and set up her small mattress himself. Before the morning was gone, John was entirely unpacked and moved in. As soon as the last container had been stored, Sherlock simply said, “We’ll be back later,” before leaving the flat with Danny in tow and not another word spoken.
The flat was awful. Already it felt cold and hollow, all the little missing details horribly noticeable. The stack of novels that John kept meaning to read. Gone. His side of the desk. Empty. All the magazines. Gone. Their pin-board with bills, their events calendar, and notes to one another. Blank. The kitchen. Completely empty except for experiments, and whatever ancient dishes Mrs Hudson had first handed over. The loo. Gutted. There was one thin towel left, and the bog roll. John’s med-kit was gone. Even when he’d been a married man, that case had remained, used sparingly during cases. He was glad it was gone and silently thanked the movers for their thoroughness. Sherlock made a note to have it replaced but
“And shagging.”
John was so tight, so smooth inside, so warm. Sherlock kept pushing until his not inconsiderable length had been swallowed down to the root. John was shaking a bit, his arse clenching as he reared back reflexively, rocking himself on Sherlock’s cock in little jerks. Sherlock held onto John’s waist and bucked forward, wringing an eager gasp from the small man beneath him, and that was all it took for Sherlock to lose control.
Furious at being compelled to leave Baker Street, John acted out with childish spite the moment Sherlock left him alone to pack himself up. He broke Sherlock’s violin bow. He burned Sherlock’s skull, or tried to, Mrs Hudson rescued it before it was more than barely scorched. John destroyed all of Sherlock’s ongoing experiments, not caring that five separate cases would now go unsolved because he’d ruined the scant evidence available. In the end, Mrs Hudson resorted to turning to Mycroft Holmes in a panic. Mycroft sent a dozen very large men to pick up John and physically remove him spitting and screaming from 221 B Baker Street, depositing him and his few boxes at a shelter for veterans.
John felt bereft with the loss, ill with regret. He was sick with it. His entire body broke into a cold sweat as a bottomless emotional abyss opened, forcing John to comprehend the incomprehensible. The region around his heart and chest felt tight and hollow inside.
Weeks had passed, and Sherlock was anxious again. He didn't need to be, why, cases practically solved themselves these days, and at the speed of light too as Sherlock spat out his deductions rapidly, barely slowing enough for anyone to follow.
“You hardly argued when I did,” Mary said flippantly but there was a barely hidden thread of anger in her voice, “You were as hot for him as I was. Don’t try to tell me you didn’t want a piece of his arse.”
“I am
John got up, immediately positioning himself behind the much taller man. They seemed to be in a kind of enormous fishbowl, a gigantic one-way mirror that curved up and away from them. John could hear people muttering on the other side but couldn’t see them. There seemed to be a lot of them. Suddenly, John understood.
Sherlock’s penis had never been so hard, and Sherlock hated it nearly as much as he hated John.
She waved away his words, “None of that, our John, call me Mummy, or Violet, if you prefer.”
, John, just as you were. I don’t think you can fail, not if you just be yourself, your
Their kiss was new and old at the same time. Sherlock knew exactly how John’s mouth fit against his, how sweet it was, how sensual it could be, and yet, this was something new, something deeper than what had existed before and he could feel it down to his bones that this was forever. Their hands roamed as they rutted slowly against each other, and peeled away the few items of fabric between them until they were skin-to-skin at last. Sherlock glutted himself on John, tasting him all over, rediscovering everything he hadn’t been able to touch for weeks, “My beautiful soldier.”
I’m merely doing my friend a favour since I certainly don’t get paid for it.”
Sherlock seemed to enjoy scrubbing John from head to toe, humming softly as he shampooed and rinsed his alpha, going so far as to towel John off and to help him into his robe. Sherlock’s contentment and happiness radiated off of him, and the heat in his chest spread all through John’s body once again. Sherlock helped him strip the sheets and remake the bed, both men laughing softly as they crawled beneath the blankets when they were done. Sherlock snuggled himself into John’s arms and fell asleep with a smile on his face, and John felt so peaceful, he hoped the moment would never end.
As quickly as he could ungracefully flounder out of it, John left the booth, ignoring the way Sherlock anxiously called his name. John checked himself out of his room the moment he finished packing and spent the rest of the sleepless night sitting on a bench at the train station waiting for morning. He had wanted to get out of the hotel before he had to witness Sherlock bringing his lover to his bed, the bed that was so close and yet so far from John’s.
Sherlock completed Mycroft's piece in one long stretch. He proceeded to stick it in his bedroom and forget all about it.
“The man from District 1.”
John burst into the Piazza della Minerva, the obelisk's shadow cutting across the rapidly growing crowd of people, lights flicking on inside the buildings, scattered screams and shouts. He came to a sickening halt behind the crowd, all the people huddled around, what, exactly? Yelling for ambulances and police.
“Yes. Or who?”
“Yes, and anything else where you appear in public. I've been talking to Anthea, the other stylist, and your mentor. We know what direction we want to take. Miss Adler told us to make sure we made good use of your pleasant personality. She said to make you feel like home. We won't be making you flashy. Except for at the Parade. We will be making a strong impression there, if we do our jobs right.” She grinned a little.
“And this has to do with violins because?”
“Yeah, well, good luck.”
“I'm actually pretty fond of the violin.”
Sherlock stepped out onto the balcony, a large one that ran the length of the ballroom they were using for the party. It was easier to breathe, and the city was lit beautifully, shining under a clear, cold night.
“That's a little odd, isn't it?” John said.
John waited for a reply, anything, but after a long silence he resumed eating, already planning what he would have to do to avoid the police.
“Well darling, if I don't, who will?” He knew she was smiling, could hear it in her voice without looking up from the indiscriminate blackness of the planetarium floor. It looked like an appealing abyss at the moment. Sherlock's own personal hell had always been people talking to him about his work, referencing it or asking questions about it. He'd had to be strong-armed to do any interviews when
“Sort of.”
“Why?”
* * *
“Sure, I'm perfectly happy. She's a good person.”
Sherlock glanced at John's vacant chair. Why did it feel like he was somewhere much farther away than any New Year's Eve party?
“...'Children of Adam.' Isn't that from Whitman? I swear I read that phrase earlier.”
SH: This idea that writers all have a certain amount of mysticism and romanticism about them is outlandish. I've met enough other writers in my days to know that. Most of them are all ego, and very little heart, despite what their work might lead you to believe.
“I am too.”
“I can't take your supplies.”
It occupied him for hours. And he was actually quite good. He stood in front of the window in his robe, playing, his eyes occasionally falling shut during slower pieces. John knew almost nothing about classical music, but it sounded nice all the same.
“Is it true?”
“I don't care about sharing my life with you in any capacity. I'm not here for you. I'm here for the wife you browbeat, the daughter you insult, and the daughter-in-law you despise with no cause.
Sherlock scored a nine, and seemed satisfied enough. He ignored a smile and words of congratulations from both Irene and Mycroft. He seemed more interested in John's score than his own.
“John, is that you?” John stood in the front hall of 221B as Mrs. Hudson emerged from the back. “I could have sworn I heard you come in a few hours ago.”
When Sherlock finally let himself sleep nearly two days later, he dreamed of painting The Man. His dreams were all colors and life. The Man was not a sketch, but a human being. In the dream, he became real, walked right off the canvas and into Sherlock's arms. His voice was a hearth, and his touch, the fire that burned within it.
It was an evening opening, winter making the world full dark early on. John took his time walking through the museum, looking at all the works, not just those lucky enough to be in the same room as the Vermeer. The white walls of the Hickman were almost clinical when combined with the cool air.
When John woke up a couple hours later, he came outside and sat down with Sherlock. He said something, probably telling him he needed to sleep, but Sherlock didn't hear a word he said.
you. And I was trying to come up with some sort of background that would explain why you are the way you are.”
doubted him. Not once." John's anger had broken, and now he just sounded defeated. He didn't want to feel betrayed, but that was what it had come to. Betrayed by the Met, yes, but betrayed by Sherlock as well. "What exactly do you want from me? He called me, gave me a voice suicide note, and made me watch him kill himself. He had no pulse. I checked."
“I'm not a psychiatrist, John.”
John let out an exasperated sigh, letting go of his arm. “He's fictional. It's a movie.”
But John could hear the doubt in his friend's voice. He decided it would be best to not mention the man again.
When they were more or less safely back in their rooms, the sunrise creeping up over the city, the texts still came. The three names over and over.
"A dream version of me would have shown up a long time ago, if at all. Unfortunately the actual me has never been known for good timing."
All he could think as he stood there letting the cigarette smoke curl further upward into the sky, was how John would have appreciated this light-obsessed phantom, and how, merely by that association, Sherlock cherished them, too.
John couldn't look away from the lavender rose. He didn't understand how anyone, especially the man who created it, could look at it with so much hate.
And with a smile forming on his face, Sherlock answered:
Standing nonchalantly on the other side of the Square was a tall man in a dark purple shirt. He looked terribly bored. John recognized him. He had seen Sherlock around before. No one in District 12 especially liked him. There were all sorts of rumors about what his actual job was, and most people thought best to not trust him at all. He had, as far as John knew, no family or friends to speak of. He may have been unlikeable, but John couldn't judge him for whatever work he did. They all did what they had to to get by.
“Do you have London memorized or something?”
All along that day.
Sherlock had made it, apparently, and the trauma had done nothing to affect his lack of tact.
“No one lives. And no one recovers.”
How could one man cheat death so well so many times?
, without comparing it to a fix? It wasn't enough anymore, being around anyone else. Something about this man, about how steadfast he appeared, how much more complex he was than the general public believed, some sort of down-to-earth charm that he carried with him in his very bones.
“John, don't talk like that. Don't. You survived something terrible. But you survived.” He didn't have it in him to argue with her. There was no way she could understand. “You know the whole Capitol is in love with you two.”
a friend.
John couldn't even remember what they'd talked about, or why Sherlock had even come upstairs in the first place. Surely it was something about a case? All he knew was that Sherlock seemed reluctant to go back downstairs, and stood for far longer than John would have expected in the doorway, hands in his pockets. Now and then he would cut his eyes to the closet door that had been in John's line of sight, but it never took much to draw his eyes away. All John had to do was speak, and suddenly Sherlock was sufficiently distracted.
