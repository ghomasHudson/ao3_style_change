‘Very few times’ Cas said ‘My mother used to sell at the Market, not me.’
“I-It’s just that I… I’ve never…”
“Ninety-nine brother, yeah, it’s real. Actually, we don’t really know what your score is, but I’d bet you’re pretty close to that”
“Well, we have a strong start this evening! There’s so much we want to ask him, so much to talk about! Ladies and gentleman, our first interview of the night, you know him as the Son of the Flames!” Dean heard the audience scream his name and closed his fists, he could do this “Welcome to the stage, Dean Winchester!”
“Not exactly. Gabriel, my brother, told me I was able to hear when I was little, I don’t remember, but he told me that I got progressively worse, and so I became entirely deaf by the time I was 5 or so.”
He was at 78%. He was surprised to see he was still quite high, he had seen many people die relatively quickly by dehydration in previous trials.
He kept his eyes closed as he enjoyed the feeling of the water on him.
Dean frowned. Cas must have been having some delirious dream.
“Are you going to get me food or what?” Castiel said after a couple of seconds went by.
Castiel slowed down to cross it, he even stopped pedaling for a while, letting the wheels of his bike roll freely.
Balthazar walked up to him quickly and tried to take his bag away, Castiel didn’t let it go.
‘I’m fine’ he said picking his bike ‘I just need to get to that bridge and then to the left and keep going until I’m home.’
‘Mom’ Cas interrupted her, she stopped walking when she saw Dean ‘this is Dean, he’s going to stay for lunch, if that’s okay.’
“I’m sorry to hear that Cas” Dean said, still, a little voice in his brain told him Cas was also well aware of the impact this would have on the public.
Dean turned around to give himself one last look in the mirror.
The question took Dean by surprise. Was he supposed to say the truth?
“I like you”
“Are you okay?” his best friend asked.
“Dean!”
“Then I’m fine too” he said.
He walked to a big tree, and sat on the floor. His back resting against the trunk.
“I’m sorry Dean, but… we only met a couple of days ago?” He said.
was allowed.
Cas lost his smile, instead he looked at him almost with the same puppy eyes Sam made.
Dean eyed him, his posture reminded him of the one Sam had when Dean yelled at him, he tried not to, but sometimes, when he was little, Sammy would do something very stupid like running just when a car was coming, or mindlessly try to help Dean if someone tried to fight him, and he had to let Sam know somehow that he shouldn’t do that.
Dean couldn’t pay much attention to his anger when he noticed that Castiel had to look up if he wanted to see his eyes.
The crowd went mad as soon as the stage lights hit him. They didn’t blind him this time, he walked quickly but surely to Crowley, to the middle of the stage. There was a giant screen at the back of the stage, behind the armchairs for the interview, his name was written on it in big bold letters. He made sure to put on his best smile.
‘No, uh, Cas is great, he’s very kind’
Some months later Benny told her about his plans for Dean. He could remember quite vividly how she looked at him, with a type of… tenderness, or even concern, she had never shown him before.
‘Dean’ when he turned, those big blue eyes were looking straight at him ‘Thank you, really’
When he looked at the crowd below him, he couldn’t help but wondering what would it be like to be down there, both as a brother and as a candidate.
Dean nodded as he heard the crowd just a few feet away from him.
Dean could do that. Plus, he was going to be telling the truth… just a little… spiced up.
He heard cheers from a distance. Crowley must have started the show. He was the first interview, same order as last time, the sponsor competitor went first.
Cas looked down, his chest was still moving quickly, and his cheeks were still flushed.
‘No problem, Cas’ he said with a smile.
“Where are you going?” Dean asked.
“Do you want to go over your interview for a bit?”
“Okay, okay” he said, hugging her back softly.
Benny opened the door to Dean’s apartment and before he could even walk in Jody ran to hug him.
His phone vibrated on his hand.
“They’ll probably show me some scenes from the Trials and ask me a few questions” he said, trying to sound calm. He wasn’t exactly looking forward to getting on that stage again.
What could possibly have pissed him about his question? It was just a question. Maybe it wasn’t genuine, maybe it was just to make a little bit of show for the cameras, but still.
He didn’t even know what he was planning to do, fuck Cas there? On the fucking couch of the apartment where his friend was sleeping? Just mess around with him? Much as he wanted to do
But it was useless, he couldn’t be neither of those things.
When he thought about it now he felt sick, a grown man shooting a couple of starving kids, but back then, he became more mindful of what he did, what he stole, and who he fucked up in the process.
‘It’s true though! It’s nice to know that after going there for all those weeks you finally got to know somebody’.
But they would never find any water or food if they kept going on the same path.
“They are hearing aids” Cas interrupted him.
Cas was probably delirious.
“This” he said as he placed something on Castiel’s ears “is a walkman. It’s a very old thing that we can use…” he smiled at Castiel and wiggled his eyebrows playfully “to listen to music”.
When he was fifteen Michael took his test. Castiel didn’t go with him to listen to the results, if Michael had passed he couldn’t risk his reputation by being seen with his bruised brother.
Castiel started to look for a tree.
They were already in the second phase, and they were struggling. They needed help.
“Oh” Dean said, ‘cause what else could he do? Ask him to tell him about that guy? That would seen very forced.
“Fuck” he had muttered, for the first time breaking their kiss.
A river, with water… just a couple of meter away.
“Yeah”
Castiel was running behind him.
“The same can be said about you, Castiel” Dean said “You didn’t sleep?”
He would wrap Castiel in as many blankets as he could, but the little kid would still shiver and wake up at night calling his brother, saying he was cold.
Dean nodded as he picked up the phone but the door at the other side of the room opened making them turn.
“Dean, they sent us something”
“Dean” the other boy answered.
He rubbed his eyes, trying to be a little more awake before getting up. Benny was right, he had indeed quite the night.
Immediately white shiny letters started to appear in the air in front of them. The were slowly forming words, and a sentence.
He remembered that sound, so heavenly for him at the time, so small and fragile. A moan, from Cas’s mouth.
Dean tightened his grip on the rooftop border.
“I guess you truly are the Son of the Flames!”
He stopped.
“You… like me?” He said.
But of course, these shows lived from the Trials, and each year a new round of competitors to look into a talk about made them gold.
A small noise.
‘Castiel told me about you! You buy our cheese everyday’
Without Cas he would be completely alone. On his own.
“You can still take him with you” Dean said “If you win, you can say you consider him your family and take him with you”
Dean blinked a couple of times. He was going to answer, say “thank you” or “you too”, but there was something in his throat that wouldn’t let his voice come out.
When the sun started to go down, Dean didn’t know if that was a blessing or a curse. Yes, the heat would be gone, but they would have to stop and climb some tree and spend the entire night there as their bodies slowly lost more and more water.
Then again, Castiel didn’t seem like he was planning to stab Dean on the back, and if he wanted to last enough to find Sam, an alliance was huge help.
Dean groaned as he gave it one last pull to rip it entirely.
She disappeared inside the wooden door again.
It was a weird name.
“You mind if I…?” he asked, not wanting to step into the machine without permission.
They grew much closer after tha—
Castiel didn’t seem more rested.
He wrapped his arms around the younger boy, hugging him strongly.
“Ahk” he heard Cas say.
“It’s okay” Cas said “I can read your lips, but you need to look at me when you talk”
It was intoxicating for both of them, but Dean had never been like that before. He had never felt that strong need, and that had his heart racing with excitement and fear equally.
In a quick movement Castiel handed Dean the metal weapon.
“Cas” he said “I hope you don’t hate me for this but…”
The younger boy laughed.
They stared again.
He couldn’t help but smiling as he walked toward the water.
“So… you were born deaf?” Dean asked.
“Well Cas, he sounds like a very nice guy. You know, maybe too nice”
He was woken in the morning by him.
“Listen” he said. Cas’s blue eyes were fixated on his, suddenly he felt his stomach falling, and the freezing cold of the snow didn’t seem so bad “for the record, I wouldn’t tell you this if they weren’t telling me to do so”
, I guess I better get going now’
“Dude?” Dean said worriedly.
Dean frowned.
Dean eyed the message again, then took a deep breath, and turned to Cas.
Was that… a compliment?
Crowley faced him excitedly, then stopped and laughed for a minute.
“This is awesome,” he said.
If he said what he was about to say, drama was going to get started on the outside world. And maybe that’s what they wanted. They wanted the viewers to go crazy.
Cas smiled at him.
“Of course you are. Dean, tell us, how have the Trials been so far?”
He sat on his bike seat when he felt Cas’ hand at his shoulder.
“I’m fine, hungry and a little bit sweaty… oh, and I’ve never been more thirsty in my life. But overall fine” he answered changing his smile to sarcastic one.
On the branch below him, Dean could see Castiel’s dark hair, it looked soft. He was sat just like Dean, he had his arrows hanging from one shoulder, his bow too, and he had Dean’s spear in his hands, he was touching the middle of it, slowly, like he was caressing it. There was a black backpack on top of his legs.
(See the end of the chapter for
They kept going at the same pace until they reached a bridge, it was an old stoned bridge, the Crying river ran underneath it. Or so he remembered from his geography class.
Dean let himself fall into the couch, and Cas followed, not wanting to separate their mouths. The boy fell onto his lap, and Dean couldn’t stop it anymore, he placed his hands on him and… felt. He felt Cas’s torso, he felt how it got bigger with every breath, he allowed himself to grip it carefully, like telling Cas he wasn’t close enough. He’d never be close enough.
“And…?”
“Shh” he said, trying to shut Castiel up.
Castiel took the cluster from Dean’s hands and turned around.
“I know” Castiel interrupted him “I’m just looking for a good tree to spend the night”.
The heat had escalated real quick, it was almost unbearable at that point. Dean had sweat dripping from his forehead no matter how much he cleaned it. His mouth was crying for water and he was hungry enough to be considering asking Castiel for the berries.
Just small helps.
The next one made him smile:
Dean frowned and looked up.
“Yeah, Castiel” Benny didn’t seem too comfortable with the topic, after all, he had avoided it until that very moment “Listen Dean, when they ask you about Sam, you just need to be honest about what you feel, love, fear, anything will be fine because he is brother, and I know you care about him. I’m not so sure what you are planning on saying about Cas”
“Cas” Dean said.
He did it, his little brother did it.
And he didn’t want to attack him.
Dean looked around “Yeah, maybe”
Of course. If he had never really been kissed, of course he had never had sex… or done anything sexual for that matter.
“Isn’t it supposed to funking rain in the jungle?” he complained looking up at the sky. The trees gave them shadow, but the heat from the sun was still there.
“What?” Dean asked.
Michael and Gabriel fought all the time.
‘Yeps’ he answered turning to face Dean ‘I told you it was a long way’
He was in the nursery. He remembered the nurse smiling at him, pushing the needle into his arm right before he woke up on the Trials.
‘You live here?’ he asked.
“You like it?” Gabriel asked.
Dean took a deep breath, throwing his head back. The mention of water made him remember how much he wanted to drink anything. The juice from the berries wasn’t enough.
Dean looked down.
So what? Was he supposed to attack Castiel? Make their time together a little more entertaining?
“Yeah, they are good to eat” he said, before he could even blink Castiel spoke.
“Ready, brother?” Benny asked him.
People cheered again.
Castiel’s hand stilled and he looked up. His eyes immediately found Dean’s, and Dean got to see their actual color for the first time in person.
Water had never tasted so good.
Castiel didn’t answer this time.
Then another man, next to her.
It took Charlie a while to process what just happened.
“Castiel?” he said.
“And?” Castiel asked as if he was tired of Dean looking at him.
Castiel gave him a very hard look.
With that, Benny hung up.
His eyes had no emotion in them, even with his soft beauty, his expression was completely hard.
Dean looked up in frustration.
“So soon?” Dean asked. Benny just sighed and shook his shoulders, he seemed as tired as Dean was, and as unwilling to do an interview that very night as Dean felt.
Dean made Cas moan in their kiss again, and then Dean felt how one of the boy’s hands started getting lower and lower into his body.
And Cas did the same to him, he allowed his smaller hands to explore Dean’s larger body. from his neck to his chest to his flat stomach.
“The sky—”
Then Dean felt Cas’s lips on his cheek. Kissing him.
. He started with girls, as most boys do, because he heard it was easier, and because there was a girl he found specially hot who seemed to like him back.
He turned to look at Castiel with a huge smile on his face.
Sam was younger, would anyone remember his age if he was stabbed on the chest?
Castiel would see them shouting all the time, he had grown up watching them fight. The difference was that, when it was over, Michael would storm out of their barely standing wooden house, and Gabriel would stay with Castiel, playing and calming him when he was little, and teaching him stuff when he was older.
Anyway, this person seemed to have been someone
Why would they ask him to do that?
“You don’t do this, Cassie! Can’t you see I want you to stay here? Am I not good enough for you so you keep insisting on going after these childish dreams?”
Dean swallowed.
And another person, and another and another.
” A blonde one responded.
He stopped laughing, but still had a smile on his face as he spoke “Don’t worry, if anyone was near us, they would’ve had to walk as much as we did, they always put competitors somewhat near to each other. That, and they would’ve had to have more luck than the screaming girl from the other night”
And then:
“I thought you didn’t have any family… or friends” He said, remembering what Castiel had said on his interview.
When the last day came, everyone knew things were going to end bloody. He was sitting on the couch next to Benny and Donna. Charlie was on the floor. She looked really bad, Dean hadn’t seen her eat for days, and when he got up in the morning she was already watching the Trials. Dean figured she had actually never left that spot.
Cas walked very slowly.
After that Castiel settled himself on the branch below, and Dean saw he was tying himself too.
“Wha-”
He was only eighteen.
“Cas,” he said.
“I don’t mind it, I guess I’m used to being on my own. I feel better on my own”
Most of the competitors were too focused and killing and surviving for that, but yeah… Neither him nor Cas seemed too fond of unnecessary murders, so their strategy was different.
But Michael entered the room, and closed the door behind him.
As he spoke, he felt Cas slowly relaxing on his arms.
He could see the wood that attached the cluster to the branch breaking slowly.
Dean liked the place, Cas’ mom was a really nice woman, and the whole house had a peaceful air that made him never want to leave. Eventually, of course, he had to listen to all the lessons his mother had gave him and decided that it was time to stop abusing of being the guest, so he said he had to go.
“You remember the deal then?” Dean knew Benny wasn’t threatening him, but they all had put their hopes in Dean for the last months, and he had to take responsibility for that.
Dean’s back hurt awfully, that was the first thing he realized as he opened his eyes. He let out a grumble as he tried to move.
“I know. That’s why I didn’t say that I loved you, I just like you. I think you are… handsome and interesting. That’s it”
Apparently people didn’t like him as much as he thought, or a present would have arrived from him, with food or clothes or anything.
‘This is very good’ Dean said before eating another mouthful of pasta.
The first Trials Dean witnessed with the rebellion were very different to those he had seen before. The atmosphere was different. There was hate, and anger, and everyone seemed more irritable at the time.
Dean took deep breaths as he wrapped the blanket that had covered his body around both of them, and covered Castiel’s chest with the top of the suit he had been wearing.
“That” he added “and your watch is going down fast”
“Yeah” he said “a bit hungover, I guess” he rubbed at the back of his head.
“Fuck” he muttered as he tried to pull the cluster out.
‘Thank you so much for doing this, Dean. I know it must have been exhausting to carry this all the way.’
Castiel tensed his jaw.
His head shot up and he looked at Castiel. He was still resting his head against the trunk. He seemed to be fighting not to fall asleep.
Dean could hear it.
It was only a couple of years, but Castiel seemed so small next to Dean.
Cas chuckled when Dean shoved more bread into his mouth.
Dean couldn’t tell if the expression on his face was of sadness or irritation. He probably was only talking about it for the cameras.
He wanted to know if Benny had sent him any messages. Those would appear on the watch screen, but there was nothing, just his percentage.
Dean swallowed. Getting into the Trials was the easy part, surviving them was the part that worried him.
So he went to his room. He looked at the gigantic bed and felt this wave of exhaustion run through his body, and he couldn’t really tell what tiredness he was feeling, the one from the Trials, or the one from being woken up from a simulation.
He gave up his friend.
His friend and coach smiled at him.
Castiel faced away and started to walk again.
Cas smiled, he looked so loosened up… maybe his percentage was still low, and he was still a little delirious.
He felt a hand grabbing his arm, some hard patting on his back as he kept coughing, he felt as if his lungs were barely opened for air.
Ninety-ni… No, it was impossible, no one ever got a higher score than ninety-five.
Dean managed to open his eyes and looked around. He was in a very white room.
Dean saw his name disappear from the screen and then replaced by an image. It was footage from the Trials, from the moment he woke up, during the countdown.
He hadn’t realized how much he had been leaning on towards Cas until he slipped from the seat and his hand fell to the floor, knocking the empty bottle over.
And for that he needed Castiel to be alive. And conscious.
Cas laughed a little.
“They were like… wildlings?” He asked.
He took a moment to look at his hands, they felt so real… just like the ones in the Trials. His body was clean, no blood, no dirt. No scratches, no scars.
Dean couldn’t imagine how it was for him to be carrying all that weight, with the backpack and the weapons, when they were both so tired.
“It was a stupid thing to do, Dean Winchester” he said “Falling asleep like that. You could have fallen”.
The shine of the moon didn’t let him see much more.
“Michael, where’s Gabriel?” he asked again.
He couldn’t help but chuckle a little. What was he expecting? A gift? A teleporter? He wasn’t in the Trials anymore, for now.
But then again, Benny had suggested he looked in love, and he had agreed, so he guessed he had done his part well enough. He turned the tablet off, reading about himself was a much harder thing to do than he had imagined.
When Dean got down from his bike Castiel reached for the metal bar, taking it off with the wheelbarrow.
In the darkness, in between the trees, he saw the silhouette of a man.
Dean didn’t say anything about it. His stomach was furiously roaring inside of his cold body.
“You know where to go?” Benny asked, as his coach they had informed him of everything that was recommended to do during the breaks, training was one of those things. But Benny had already talked to Dean about that.
Dean replied by clashing their mouths together again. It felt so, so good.
Sammy had got an eighty-three.
Dean sat down and looked at the crowd again, this time to the first few rows. Benny was there, next to Jody, they smiled at him, but Dean was looking for Bobby, he was hoping to see him, at least for a few seconds. He wasn’t there, he was probably helping Sammy get ready for the stage.
“So… uh…” Castiel was massaging the back of his neck, he looked uncomfortable. Dean raised his eyebrows, waiting for him to continue “this coach of yours…”
The idea hadn’t come to his mind until then, but now he thought of it, it was kind of obvious. Castiel was stunningly beautiful, hell, Dean thought that even the way his hair curled and covered his ears was beautiful, of course he had someone especial back home. Or had at least.
Castiel untied him and then climbed down with Dean following.
And then Castiel heard the most weird sound. It was beautiful.
“I just hadn’t seen him in so long that I thought I would be putting him in such an awful situation. I didn’t want to put him through it, not when we haven’t spoke in such a long time”
Dean raised an eyebrow at him.
Until he felt Castiel’s hand on his arm, gripping him tightly “What?” he said opening his eyes.
Despite knowing perhaps it wasn’t that good of an idea, he decided to grab the tablet again and search what was said about him now that his second interview was done. There were many sites about his reunion with Sam, Dean was taken aback by the pictures. His little brother was now so much taller than him, and the photos showed his emotional expression as he hugged Dean.
“Dean, I’m so sorry—”
shining on Dean’s wrist.
Castiel tied Dean to the tree, he took out a thin rope from his bag and tied Dean’s hands together before strapping his legs and his torso.
After moving behind Cas, he slided Cas’s top part of the suit, the boy shivered as Dean manhandled him to have him sitting, his white back against Dean’s chest.
People usually waited at the bottom of the buildings for their result. They all gathered at the park in the center of the city, it was a tradition; all the teenagers, no matter what their background was, and their families waited for their tests results together.
Castiel was shorter than him, not much shorter but still. He was slimmer than Dean, he didn’t have that much muscle. It would have been easy for Dean to think of Castiel as fragile or weak if it wasn’t because his current situation.
It was heaven.
“Sorry if I woke you” Dean whispered, trying to find the blue eyes in the middle of the dark.
“Oh uh…” Dean looked down at the berries between his hands.
Benny had brought him clothes, and helped him up as soon as Dean’s headache went away.
They were standing way too close for Dean’s liking, still he didn't move back. He allowed his eyes to sink into Castiel’s. For some reason, he was starting to look more like… a boy, like a boy of eighteen years old. Maybe it reminded him of Sam, he couldn’t really tell what it was, but he felt like somehow he was supposed to be the “older brother”.
“Benny?” He said answering it.
He was waiting for the results too. Not his results, of course, he was too old for that.
Then they jumped to the jungle. To the moment when he met Castiel.
Running towards water probably.
The crowd went crazy for it, they screamed, cheered, whistled even. Dean felt his face getting hotter.
Dean was becoming thirsty again.
Not even in those cold winter nights, when Michael would refuse to share his bed with his brothers, and Gabriel was left to take care of Castiel alone.
But he supposed people were already desensitized to all that. Romance on the Trials was new, he had never seen it before, maybe some suggestive things, but never the actual thing.
“No” he shook his head and looked right into Dean’s eyes “I want to. I just don’t know what to do”
Castiel didn’t move.
It wasn’t a rational decision, he didn’t consider the pros and cons, the possible outcomes, nothing. If he wanted to, he could have run the other way. If Castiel had given him a bad feeling, that was the moment to run. It was almost an impulse that made him gave that first step towards probably the most dangerous person in the Trials.
He had better chances staying with Castiel.
Castiel followed shortly after.
And Castiel lost his smile.
“So he is okay?” Dean asked, looking at Benny.
“What?” Dean asked, still half asleep.
His brother was being interviewed.
What would he do if Castiel faded? Take his weapons and go? Castiel had given him food… and he knew something that Dean didn’t. Something that seemed important.
He was on the ground next to Dean in no time. He had the backpack on, the arrows and the bow hanging from his shoulder, and the spear on his hand.
Dean almost jumped when he heard it.
Castiel turned to look at him with half a smile.
For some reason his mind drifted to those wild teenage years where Dean discovered there was an entire new world of things to do to
Hope filled all of their eyes, even if some tried to look self-assured.
His movements were soft, just like his face. It was hard to think that he was deadly, but Dean could remember the way that boy had threatened him, how he looked ready to shoot him.
Cas placed his hearing aids on his ears again and closed his eyes a bit, as if he was trying to get used to them.
He opened his mouth, but closed it again.
They showed them spending that first night on top of the tree, then showed them walking around. The fight on the lake, with savages.
Cas’s laugh resonated in his mind. Cas’s eyes looked at him intensely. Cas’s lips danced against his own.
Great.
He said all his family was dead.
“I’m excited to be here too,” Dean said, leaning back on the chair.
“We are safe during the day.” Castiel continued “And I trust that you know how to defend yourself if someone comes near to you”
“Well Dean, we truly want to know!” Crowley continued, forcing Dean to look up “There’s no other way of asking this, what’s going on between you and Castiel?”
He must have fallen asleep after that. And Cas must have left after that.
“You okay?”
Dean grabbed his wrist and looked at his watch.
Gabriel would always bring him gifts. They weren’t nice things to they eyes of the world, always used stuff that was dirty and half broken, but they were Castiel’s most precious possessions.
“I supposed” Castiel answered “I saw the group moving to the place that girl had been. Then you appeared”
‘Cas?’
‘You had never been there before?’ Dean asked.
‘I could stay if you don’t mind, but I need to call home’
He swallowed. The screen went dark with the picture of their kiss.
‘Pleasure’s mine’ he answered before going out, Cas followed.
“Yeah, but I’m not, ‘cause you don’t trust me, so we aren’t allies either. Allies are supposed to trust each other”
Dean was mentally prepared by the time midday came, which wasn’t much help, considering they had no water nor food left. But at least he was aware of his imminent suffering.
Dean looked at him. The smile was gone now.
They didn’t get out of the cave after that, there was no need. This part of the competition was probably about surviving the cold, and they were doing just fine hidden in there.
“Don’t do this Balth” he whispered.
Suddenly Cas moved against his chest.
Dean nodded and grabbed the trunk to start climbing.
Maybe the water was a peace offering. Maybe Castiel thought he could benefit from working with Dean.
Dean looked at the other boy again. He looked tired, he looked more vulnerable than ever before. He must have known that Dean could attack him then, when he had better chances.
His laugh was also precious, a warm feeling appeared inside his chest for knowing he was the one who had made him laugh.
Eighty-three.
Would they know if he lied? Maybe he could make something up.
“Third floor underground” He said and his friend nodded.
“I’ll be here if you need me”
“They told me everyone reacts differently when waking up” Benny said looking at him as he ate “You could feel weird for a couple of days”
Dean closed his eyes, and threw his head back.
Cas shook his head, he couldn’t look his friend in the eyes.
They were just kissing, but Dean felt like it was so much more than that. When was the last time he had slept with someone? It felt like way too long ago, and touch, Cas’s touch, was addicting for him. He couldn’t stop, he had to get closer and closer to that body in front of him as those hands travelled curiously around his chest.
He needed Cas’s help.
Then the bushes ended, and Dean saw an animal larger than a rabbit, with dark straight hair, coming out of the leaves.
For a moment, Castiel asked himself whether he was doing the right thing. The right thing for himself. Was Dean the way to win? Was Dean just an obstacle? Was any of this helping him or slowing him down?
There was no hope, no illusion, no familiar faces to cheer for. It was weird, knowing he himself could have been competing in those trials. He tried to imagine it, everytime a new challenge aroused to those competing he tried to see himself handling it, thinking what he would do or how he would do it.
Dean looked around, the sight was quite pretty; the forest was much closer now, but he was still surrounded by clean fields, and, in the middle of all that nothing, the river ran making a soft sound.
They went quickly through hair and make-up, Dean was so tired he didn’t even have the strength to complain about what was being done to him. He didn’t even respond when the make-up artist started to complain about having to cover the dark circles under his eyes.
He thought they had left things pretty well last night, given the circumstances. Was there any chance Cas was so drunk he didn’t even remember what had happened? They drank quite a bit, but not
So where was his best friend?
Fast. Moving.
His blue eyes were closed, Dean was manhandling him like a doll.
Castiel looked at the
Dean looked up at his friend and nodded for him to continue.
He sighed as he kneeled and touched it with his hands.
Sammy had passed.
Cas smiled “It wasn’t like that. And even if he… had feelings for me, we grew apart. I haven’t talked to him in a while. Maybe never would do it again”.
“There you go,” the voice said.
Dean nodded.
Dean almost bumped into him when Castiel stopped. He turned around and his tired eyes faced Dean with confusion.
Jo was quick and smart, and she had been deadly when needed.
“To the training rooms, yeah” Cas interrupted him.
No water or living animal was found. It didn’t rain.
“Well, I can hear again” he said after a couple of seconds.
“I mean, I don’t care if you don’t think the sa-”
He knew Sammy could do it.
Everyone cheered.
But he didn’t, he remained silent but still got both his feet on the couch, and leaned back against Dean. Dean smiled at the boy, and felt his eyes getting heavier while doing so, he accommodated himself, and got into that same position they had been in during the Trials, when they were in the snow cave: Cas’s back to Dean’s chest. It was funny, he thought, how the reasons to sit like that with Cas had changed drastically from back then.
He found himself breathing heavily as he regained his balance.
“Dean” Cas had said, like a whisper, a word that he breathed.
That guy he had slept with those years ago was barely a memory now, and he couldn’t even remember what he had done with that first girl anymore. He wouldn’t be that to Cas, not when he was drunk. Not when Cas deserved better.
“We don’t know if we can drink it” Castiel said quietly.
He extended his arm and stretched himself, but it was still too high for him to reach. With a sigh, he gripped the trunk strongly and started to climb it. He got himself some inches higher and secured his feet before he took one his hands off the trunk to try and grab the berries again.
“What?!” He had screamed back.
Dorothy had turned out to be a better competitor than anyone had imagined. She was smart, very smart, and her intelligence had taken her to the final moments of the Trials.
“Why do you even care?” Castiel said, he seemed to be searching answers in Dean’s face “I know what I’m doing. I know why I’m doing it, and I have no interest in risking my life, so if I decide to keep walking is because that’s best for me. I assume that since you are with me you understand that what’s best for me is probably best for you as well”
Dean hurried to walk beside him, and not behind him.
Dean was looking down as he runned, he couldn’t see the animal, just the movement of the plants it run through.
The morning was quite uneventful. Benny and him discussed some things that happened in the Trails, Dean asked to see Sam, Benny said he had already asked and that Infinity had to allow it. Dean already knew that, but he couldn’t just not ask anymore.
“Charlie?” He asked as he tried to open his eyes.
Dean was going after it.
His arms hurt like never before, the cold was penetrating him to his bones, shooting pain across his entire body.
There was nothing he could use to protect them, no trees, no caves, nothing, so by the time Cas’s percentage got to fifteen, he got desperate. He had screamed in anger as he buried his hands in the snow and started digging.
, he thought as he held his body like a death weight on his hands.
Castiel kept walking, a couple of steps ahead of him.
“If you were my slave you would be carrying all this stuff for me” he said gesturing to the backpack and the weapons.
The audience remained surprisingly quiet at that part, but things got loud when they heard Dean say:
And they had probably murdered that girl.
He tried not to look at Cas as much as he could.
Coaches usually weren’t allowed to send messages until the second phase, and all their messages were reviewed before they were sent, so nothing like
The first results that popped up were expectable:
‘Mom!’ Cas said frowning at her.
He raised his gaze. The water in front of him was reflecting the darkening sky.
“And do what?!” he said harshly “Live here? Hidden in the back of the store? Sleeping in the dumpster behind it until you get me in the morning? That’s what you want for me? Because that’s what going to happen if I stay”
He looked paler than what he actually was, and dark circles were starting to appear under his eyes.
“Stop!” He said “Stop it, Balth I’m doing this!”
He could hear birds singing at the distance, even if he lived in a small town, he had never felt this calm before.
It also had his pants way tighter than he could remember ever having them.
Dean would never be able to say no to those eyes.
Dean gave his friend a look before pressing the first button on the elevator to the first floor, his floor. He couldn’t help but notice the large string of buttons above his. Some of those apartments would be empty now. Some competitors were gone. Dead.
If they were going to have one of those
Gabriel was older, but Michael didn’t care.
, he thought,
About how soft he looked, how unprotected he seemed despite being so deadly. He thought about his eyes. His nose. His hands. The way he moved.
Castiel looked up to his brother laughing.
Still, he grabbed the tablet.
And he grabbed the water.
‘Mom! I’m home!’ Cas shouted.
Dean looked around, the walls inside the house were also made of stone, there was a sofa and a couple of chairs surrounding a small wooden coffee table. Behind it, a fireplace with a couple of pictures on top of it. Dean could tell most of them were from when Cas was a child.
So he couldn’t help smiling.
He looked down slowly.
Maybe. Probably.
Before the rebellion, owning something like that would have seemed utterly impossible for him, he liked to imagine Sammy’s reactions to everything, they must have been priceless.
They were all looking at them.
The memory of Sam came to his mind, how he would have to look up when they were younger if he wanted to see Dean, even when he was mad, and it used to make Dean laugh.
Dean looked at Cas expectantly.
Dean lifted a hand and touched his own mouth, he felt his own lips with his fingertips. He was looking for proof, something that would tell him that what he remembered was real.
“Okay” he said after a couple of seconds “Okay. Yes. Let’s rest for a bit”
They kept going for another couple of minutes before a house appeared, it seemed so small surrounded by the enormous fields, and the forest behind it.
Castiel touched one of the tree trunks with his hand, and Dean took the chance to glance at his watch.
Castiel nodded slowly.
Dean looked at his own watch. He was at forty-five percent, but he wasn’t all that worried about that. Benny worried him.
Dean just stared at the things for a couple of seconds.
He was there to win after all. He knew he could.
He hated what came after. He hated how he had left, so coldly, still in shock by the manifestation of the affection he had always known his friend had for him, but chose to ignore, thinking it would go away. Thinking maybe he one day would feel the same. Wondering perhaps he did feel the same way.
‘It’s okay, I like it’
A sound came from below him.
While Castiel had a 84% on his wrist, Dean had a 90%.
The memories from the night before came to his mind. Castiel, sleeping on the branch.
It was a test.
The first one that passed.
The rest of the day had been really uncomfortable.
Castiel looked at his wrist. His watch showed a 84%.
“I don’t know what they’ll ask,” Dean replied simply.
Castiel looked into his friend’s eyes. He could see rage on them, tears, desperation. He imagined that’s how his own eyes had looked too.
It was obvious what came next. Cas taking care of him, then leaning in, and so shyly… kissing him. Dean felt his heart race all over again. They cutted immediately to Cas kissing him again, more decisively this time.
“Oh folks, I think we have managed to make the Son of the Flames turn red!”
“Is that the same guy from before? The one you wanted to ask to be your couch?”
“Are you hungry?” Castiel asked without turning.
Dean frowned, maybe he heard wrong?
when I didn’t”
They talked about Dean’s family a little bit, his father’s job as a mechanic, his mother’s perfect pie.
Secondly, taking advantage of that situation to run away would undoubtedly lower his popularity with the watchers. And the audience was the one who send the gifts to the competitors when they were most needed.
Dean blinked a few times as he processed Castiel’s words. Was Castiel helping him?
He wanted to say. Instead, he said:
When the trials started he stopped though, after he walked into a common area. The lights were off, but the TV wasn’t. The volume was low, and Charlie was sitting on the floor, glued to the screen, watching Dorothy.
A tablet on his bedside table.
‘Well,
Cas mumbled something.
And Dean had the feeling that asking would only bring him more vague answers.
Maybe Dean could team up with him, and if they found Sam he would be working with the probably the strongest competitor. Maybe, if something happened to Dean, Sam could keep on going with Castiel.
He gave up his future life.
They started to growl at them.
And the list went on and on.
No one was screaming, he could only hear the sound of a few birds at the distance.
He knew that it was wrong, but he wasn’t a dad. He didn’t know how to be one.
“Fuck” Dean had muttered “Um…” he rubbed one of his eyes.
He touched the trunk as he got up, carefully, trying not to lose his balance. There was a branch on top of his head that had berries growing from it in a cluster. If only he could reach it…
Dean looked at the ground for a couple of seconds.
Dean walked into the elevator ang went to press the
. It was a blue plastic thing that curled in the outside of my ear. I couldn’t hear almost anything before, and I remember everything was so new, Gabe’s voice… my own voice”
Castiel immediately went back to walking.
‘Well, I’ll go add another place on the table then’
“No” Castiel said.
Dean laughed.
He couldn’t drink that. Firstly, that was the only water Castiel had left for himself, and secondly, if he drank it he would be in debt with Castiel, and he hadn’t planned on forming an alliance with anyone who wasn’t Sam.
“No” Castiel answered quickly “At least I’m here only to try and win this, and not to also protect someone I love”
‘You’ve got her eyes’
“Castiel, give me my spear” he whispered.
“All I’m saying is, if you want us to be working together, maybe you could put a little more trust on me” he continued.
Last time he had checked, he was under fifty percent.
“What?” He asked, it was hard hearing him from behind him, Dean was still with his chest against Cas’s back, and hugging him.
What is one supposed to do in a situation like that? He wasn’t going to keep going like nothing obviously.
Jody smiled at the both of them “Nothing less for the Son of the Flames” she said winking at Dean.
It was a typical TV set, a big screen, chairs, and three overproduced women with extravagant hair and clothes plugging ads in between each one of their opinions about the “topic of the day”. Dean was never fond of those.
‘I’m glad you like it’ Mrs Novak said ‘Not everybody likes homemade food’
Yeah. Dean could do that. And it would certainly be more entertaining than just sitting there silently for their audience.
“Okay, okay” he said once he got Cas naked from the waist down.
“You know, I was thinking” Dean started “what are we? Are we like allies now, or am I still your slave?”
“How is it like, you know, to be coachless?” Dean asked, and Castiel just shrugged.
He drank like a dying man.
He found it a couple of minutes later, Dean trusted his choice.
Michael didn’t even looked at him.
Dean looked down and chuckled, he massaged shortly the back of his neck.
Castiel wasn’t looking at him anymore, he was just sat there, waiting.
“It was too dangerous”
He hadn’t listened. He just kept packing his things.
“I’m sorry but I don’t understand” Cas said.
When Dean saw Castiel’s face, he noticed how tired tired the other boy was.
Dean placed himself right next to Cas, both of them looking forward, waiting for the doors to open. Dean found the silence that fell between them extremely unexpected, was Cas mad at him?
He smiled at Cas, or rather, at Cas’s innocence.
“It’s okay man” Dean said, looking away.
That was not why he was checking though.
And that made him smile genuinely.
” The other one laughed.
Dean stretched his back as he waited for the elevator, training would probably help clear his mind and give him something to do for a couple of hours at least. And he needed it, of course, if he wanted to be well prepared for the rest of the Trials.
‘Yeah uh…’ Dean scratched the back of his head ‘Castiel is a nice name but kinda long, right? So… Cas’.
Dean was taken aback by that. It was true, he himself had given that some thought, but he never imagined anyone else would judge him for it. And Cas had kissed him first… but again, he had told Cas he liked him before that, while naked…
Dean picked up the bottle. It had some weight, but not much.
Dean’s head shot down immediately, he saw a couple of bushes shaking. Something moved in between them.
“And that was your secret?” Cas asked, carefully, as if his brain was trying to precess all this new information.
Dean knew he was a bit of a son of a bitch, but he couldn’t help but thinking about how much people love a person that despite their struggles manages to be better than the rest… and Cas was exactly that. He was the best of the competitors, even deaf.
They were sat around a weathered wood table in the kitchen, most of the things in the house looked as if Cas and his mother had made them themselves, Dean found it charming. When he looked through the window behind Mrs Novak, he could see the woods at the distance, it was beautiful.
“Then no” Dean said putting the bottle down.
‘What?’
Cas mumbled to, he could indeed talk.
“It’s too early in the competition for that” Castiel said, just as if he had read Dean’s mind.
After so many years unable to see him, being in the same building as his brother felt surreal to him. He was hoping they would let him see him, but still if they didn’t, it was enough for now to know that he was okay.
And finally, he didn’t want to. He had started to believe he had better chances with Castiel. He knew it was the smartest choice.
in Castiel’s life.
They had to stop when the sun started to boil the blood inside their veins, or when it felt like that was the case. They sat under the shade of a large tree, silently, until Dean checked his watch.
And he hated the screams of the only person that had accompanied and cared for him after his brother’s passing telling him not to come back, as he walked away, decisively into the Trials.
And finally they showed him on the swamp, the moment when he got shot with the arrow. And then Cas patching him up, him falling to the ground the next day. For the first time he got to see what happened after that, some bits of Cas fighting, while he laid unconscious. Cas protected him.
“Castiel” he insisted.
There were only two competitors left.
He closed his eyes as he tried to remember clearly what had happened next. How did he get to the couch?
“I just tell you I’m deaf and you talk to me?”
Dean stared at the message for a while, he could feel Cas’s eyes on him.
Of course he had never touched another dick.
They both were tired, and slowing down.
He took a deep breath, and climbed up to the stage.
Dean had seen competitors start to fall and lose consciousness at 20%.
In the early morning Dean’s fever came back.
Castiel looked down, but Dean saw a curve on his lips.
‘It’s okay’ Dean said smiling.
It took a couple of seconds for Dean to look down, a few meters below him Castiel sat on his branch, looking at him, with the cluster of berries in one hand and the spear in the other.
for an answer.
Blue eyes looked up at him.
Dean laughed looking down at his shirt.
“Go in when the host announces your name” the man told him checking his watch “and mind the steps”
It looked so real that Dean was surprised he wasn’t burning his skin. He placed his hand on it one last time, feeling not even the slightest warm, before turning to Jody and hugging her.
It bothered him slightly, how people would throw that word around like nothing. He loved his brother, he loved the man who raised him, he even suspected he loved his best friend, even if the circumstances in which they met weren’t ideal.
“Yes”
They skipped some bits of the snowy place, just showed him pulling Cas up from the water, and then them laying on the snow. Naked. Together.
Relief invaded him with those words, he hadn't found Sam, he knew he wouldn’t so early on, but still, his little brother was okay.
He was done eating by that point, he just moved the food around with his fork.
Now, with the sunlight, he could see they were a dark purple. He checked their shape again, the way they grew from the cluster, and the shape of the tree again. He crashed one between his hands.
Dean felt the warm on his cheeks, he hadn’t even thought about it when he did it. It wasn’t anything suggestive or intentional, he just… gave Cas a nickname.
“I have a feeling about you. Maybe it’s nothing but- I don’t know”
Something hit his foot. He looked down to find a metal bottle next to it.
Dean sat next to him, but with a nice distance between them. He purposely sat there, it left Castiel’s bow and arrows away from him.
Dean turned to look at him. Cas looked worried, as if he was waiting for Dean to say he had done something awful.
Cas shook his head and stepped aside so as to make Dean more room.
noise came from the speakers that were spread around the town and the whole city seemed to go deadly silent. If someone had sneezed in the crowd all those floors down, Dean was pretty sure he could have heard it.
Cas lifted his head and Dean could see his eyes shining with something that wasn’t the desire that had been there before. Cas was... scared, or shy, he didn’t truly know.
Cas lifted his hands up to his ears, he moved the hair that covered them and took something out of them.
Maybe it was still too soon.
“I’ll fill the bottle” Castiel whispered.
And then there was another:
His movements were fast and smooth, like he had done that same thing many times before, like he knew where to exactly put each hand and feet by heart. Dean couldn’t stop looking.
“We need shelter” Cas said.
“You can stop if you want” Castiel answered “I won’t”.
“Music?” he asked.
Castiel got down from his bike and left it next to the door.
“Wh-where” he whispered shakingly “is Ga…” his voice died at the end.
Suddenly the wildlings didn’t seem so scary. Not if he was going to die in the middle of the night just because he had to hide since they could potentially come get him.
“Jesus Dean!” she screamed as she suffocated him in her embrace “You were wonderful, wonderful!”
Maybe it was something that happened during the Trials so far… but he wasn’t hiding anything. Right?
Castiel saw him shaking in his sleep, he touched his cheek softly. He was burning again.
The screen showed the last picture, Dean holding Cas’s face as he kissed the boy this time, it was deeper, longer, and suddenly looking at the picture, Dean felt himself shifting on his seat.
A small sound took him away from his thoughts.
” A brunette said dramatically, all their gestures were so over the top, it made Dean uncomfortable “
“Cas?” He asked, his voice was rough, his throat was sore.
If he wanted Castiel to trust him, he needed to show him he wasn’t going to attack him.
Gabe pressed a button on the box.
He felt the refreshing thing running all over his face, his mouth, his thoat.
He tapped on the search bar, and wrote:
“Sorry” the boy whispered.
He was at eighteen percent.
Why hadn’t Benny spoken to him yet?
A loud
“Look in love with him” Benny said, more serious than Dean had imagined “If Castiel wants to do something different then that’s on him, but if this thing doesn’t work out, we can’t allow you to look bad. You and Sam both would pay for it”
“What?” Dean asked, getting closer to Cas’s face.
“This has something to do with what we heard last night, doesn’t it?”
“Stop this! Stop this, Cassie! You don’t have to go. Don’t go”
He felt a little lost during that time, like he didn’t belong to the rebellion, nor to the Trials anymore. He never questioned his decision though, there was nothing more important than saving his brother’s life.
“Oh, so this hole thing of taking me as a hostage was planned?” he joked, and Castiel rolled his eyes.
Was he there already? Was he still recovering in his own nursery?
People were clapping.
Another figure appeared next to him. A woman.
“Winchester” a man said, Dean turned around “To the stage”
‘Oh- Uh, I… yeah, I do… it’s good’ he felt his face getting hot, blood rushed to his cheeks.
-Milena
“Thank you” he said, Jody hugged him back.
Dean was about to cry by the time he got Cas inside the shelter he had made.
Well, he had lost a precious 1% of his life during the night. It could just be the hunger or the thirst.
“And I thought you were going to be the biggest surprise this year… These are going to be some very interesting Trials”
Cas turned to him. There was nothing showing through his eyes, no hate, no fear, no emotion at all. They looked like he was calculating where to point his arrow to shoot a faraway objective.
“Here” Castiel said pointing to a tree, taking Dean away from his thoughts.
Cas laughed.
When Dean looked at the objects Cas had on his hands he frowned, they were small, metallic things.
He looked down at Castiel again, and closed his eyes with the sight of the dark haired boy letting his head fall, his pale skin barely noticeable in the darkness and his stunning blue eyes closed.
“You should eat, and rest,” Benny said “there will be interviews tonight”
His brother had a chance! Sammy had a chance to go to the Paradise!
‘Are you from the town?’ Mrs Novak asked, Dean nodded quickly ‘Good, Castiel doesn’t have any others friends there’
Everyone at the rebellion seemed a little distant with him, perhaps because they doubted Dean’s true motivation to be there with them. Maybe they didn’t want him there.
“Thank you” he said.
He took his glove off and touched Cas’s leg, the pants were still completely soaked, his fingers hurt from the icy temperature. He put back his glove and started to very carefully pull the pants off.
Dean gave his coach and his stylist one last goodbye look before following the man to the backstage. He was nervous, but not like last time, he felt better, more confident.
He had smiled for the people, the cameras, for Crowley. But he hadn’t mentioned Castiel’s name once.
“Wait what?” Dean said looking at Cas’s hands.
He got up from the floor, a smile on his face.
Dean nodded, he was starting to feel a little uncomfortable with the situation. He had expected Cas to react differently...
“Aside from a few scratches, Sam is completely fine,” Benny said, smiling at him.
Dean remembered the friend Cas told him about in the jungle.
He even tried to spot him in the crowd, but the thing about being in a high-enough building not to be seen was that he couldn’t actually see anyone either.
Dean’s mind started to jump from thought to thought aimlessly. He thought about Sammy, about Benny, about his childhood and his training. About how thirsty and tired and hungry he was. About Castiel.
“Benny,” he said, his voice was rough. Everything felt like his body was restarting, like waking up from a year-long nap.
Dean looked at Cas intensely, hoping Cas would pick on what he was trying to do.
Dean blinked a couple of times. Cas looked forward again, right in time for the doors to open in front of them. He watched as Cas walked out of the elevator.
But no. He was on his own.
Cas nodded and led him to the door, as soon as he opened it the smell made Dean’s stomach roar. Something was being baked, it reminded Dean of how his kitchen smelled when his mother baked pie.
Fuck, it was so fucking hot.
Castiel stopped walking before Dean could answer. He broke the cluster in two with the point of the spear, and then he turned to Dean and handled him half of the food.
Dean felt the muscles in his face relax, had he been frowning? He hadn’t noticed.
‘And you met at the market?’ Mrs Novak asked, Cas nodded and then her face lit up ‘Oh, wait! You are the cheese boy, aren’t you?’
It had clearly been a huge success for Infinity, huge ratings, lots of talking about it afterwards. Dean wasn’t sure about how he felt, it was something too private for him to see ir published for anyone to see.
Did they know? Did they know he was from the rebellion?
They went back to looking for food and water shortly after that, they didn’t talk anymore, Dean heard Castiel’s voice getting raspy. He himself felt his throat dry.
And Dean didn’t have a chance if they fought.
He thought about what to say, how to get out of that uncomfortable situation they were in without anyone’s feelings getting hurt.
” The other one interrupted, wiggling her eyebrows.
They walked the entire morning. Both were thirsty, and hungry, and they hadn’t ran into food. No berries. No animals that they could kill or follow to a water source.
That sounded better.
‘And thank you for putting up with my mom’
“Enough to make this very uncomfortable” the boy said.
Benny gestured at something beyond him with his head. Dean turned again, the window was there. The window seat. The empty bottle of wine on the floor.
“Dean, we don’t have to do this, really. I’m not offended or anything by what you did, I get that you just wanted to blow off some steam and I wasn’t the ideal candidate for you perhaps. That’s fine”
Castiel kept walking in front of him. He didn’t have a clue to what was going on in Dean’s brain… he had the weapons, but he seemed to have his guard down…
A living thing. An animal.
The pause that had seemed so small between the other candidates name and their score felt like ages to him now, until the voice said:
” The blonde one said.
“You are thirsty” Castiel said “Take it before I change my mind”.
The following weeks he rarery saw Charlie, Benny devoted most of his time to her, to help her recover.
“They will get you killed!”
“Happy?” Dean said.
Dean wished he could be there.
Dean nodded.
Sometimes Castiel asked him to talk to him until he could fall back to sleep, and his brother would do it for him.
No. No. It was too risky. He should just say another secret, maybe they weren’t even talking about the rebellion, maybe they were talking about Sam or something like that.
He was hungry too.
“Hey” Dean tried to lower his head to look into Cas’s eyes “What’s wrong?”
“Go ahead” he insisted.
His words were harsh, it was weird to listen to his tone when his face showed such softness. He looked delicate, like a porcelain doll.
“Don’t look so surprised, everyone knows who you are” he continued before Dean could say anything.
“I’m sorry to hear that” Dean whispered.
But when she did, she screamed, it was so loud Dean thought she was letting out all of her pain in that cry. Donna tried to hug her but Charlie pushed her away. She threw a glass at the TV. She kept shouting. She cursed everyone and she swore to kill the person who had taken Dorothy there. Benny told Dean to go when charlie started throwing a lamp at the TV.
Dean grabbed his head and shutted his eyes, everything was spinning. The surface under him felt hard and cold against his bear skin, like metal.
“Well, I couldn’t afford to fix it, and had no idea how Gabe managed to do it before. So one day, when Michael decided I should leave him alone and spend the day outside of the house on the streets, I headed to the town. It was risky and stupid because I couldn’t hear anything, not even the cars. I was planning on spending my day laying on the ground of some hallway when I saw an store that said ‘Deaf devices’, I went to the back of the store hoping they had thrown some devices that worked poorly or something like that. There was nothing. But then a guy that worked there saw me, a couple of years older than me, his name was Balthazar. Still is I guess, I just haven’t talked to him in a while”
He heard Castiel curse as he started chasing him.
He tried to get Cas off his lap and onto the couch to sit beside him, but Cas grabbed his shoulder.
Dean lowered his wrist “I know” he said “but just in case”.
“Dean! Ready for the night?” Jody entered the room with a smile.
Even if Castiel only had that conversation with him because they needed to put on a show, the things they talked about seemed real.
“Dude, don’t make this harder to me! I just had to tell you how I felt on national tv”
“You had quite the night yesterday, didn’t you brother?”
“What?” Dean asked.
He was sat on the floor near the fire when he heard the door open, and he had turned with excitement to have his family back home, so he wouldn't be alone.
Cas didn’t say anything.
Cas looked at him with big eyes.
His blue eyes focused on Dean’s eyes, he frowned, like he was trying to read something on his face.
A river.
And then at the top of the buttons, the last one… Castiel, the competitor with the highest scoring test ever.
Dean saw that Cas’s watch had stopped going down. It wasn’t exactly getting better, but at least it wasn’t worse.
Dean rubbed his eyes and looked around…
Dean took a deep breath. He was about to say something when he heard a weird
Dean nodded.
Dean smiled and shrugged his shoulders.
He was tempted to ask, but didn’t really feel like talking to Castiel. He seemed reserved, maybe even unsure about having brought Dean. When Dean had asked at night, Castiel said he knew what those screams were, and he hinted that there was something dangerous that Dean should be worried about that wasn’t himself, yet he still hadn’t explained any of those statements.
“Cas”  he whispered.
“Like me as in…?”
There weren’t cobblestones under his wheels anymore, just plain dirt. The breeze compensated a little the heat of the midday sun as they kept moving forward and forward.
He still didn’t know if it would compensate for the fact that everyone wanted them to fight to death and see who was better… but it was something.
At least he had stopped shivering so much.
Hope you've enjoyed the chapter!
Dean swallowed and slowly started to climb down.
He guided Cas by placing a hand on his lower back, it was almost instinctive, he got up and so did Cas, he moved towards the couch and so did Cas. He gently bit Cas’s lip as they moved, and then the boy let out the most wonderful sound.
Dean turned the tablet off after that. It was kind of funny if he had to be honest, how everyone seemed worried about their age gap, as if Dean was some type of abusive predator, while they still were willing to watch younger boys die live on their screens.
The elevator arrived with a
Dean thought.
Was he okay?
Cas just stared at him.
Dean turned and pointed to the other side of the river, where more animals like the one they chased were drinking “It seems to be fine for them” he said, his voice barely audible.
“What is it?” Castiel had asked once Gabriel put the thing on his hands.
The apartment was just like he left it, and he had this weird feeling in his body, this strange numbness, like he was dreaming. Somehow the simulation had seemed more real than the real world.
“Yeah, yeah he did”
“I am pretty much entirely deaf without them”
Then Cas fell to the white ground.
After the noise stopped, a voice was heard.
Castiel didn’t take his eyes off him at any moment. Not even when he swallowed.
The wildlings were moving slowly towards them. Once they were out of the trees, Dean saw they were holding spears, and other primitive looking weapons.
“I’m sorry if I did anything that annoyed you”
Castiel threw the berries at him once Dean was on the ground, and he started going down himself.
button on the board, but found it was already litten up.
“You, uh… you okay?”
Dean held him as he bled out. That was one of the moments that convinced him to chase the Trials as his only hope, in the ghettos everyone lost. The guy lost his life, Dean lost his lover, the owner of the store even lost. The older man looked at what he had done in horror, and even tried to help save that boy’s life, but couldn’t. Dean understood then that he was only trying to scare them off, after all they were destroying his modest business.
A painful forty candidates later, only two people had passed, none with more than eighty-five percent yet, and Dean was struggling to keep himself calm.
He looked around, blinking a few times. He was sat on a tree branch, his back resting against the trunk. He was still in the jungle, and the sun was starting to shine.
He didn’t focus too much on it once he heard the unmistakable noise of running water.
“Yeah, but you and I both know they’ll ask about someone specific” Benny said, giving him a look “Apart from Sam” he added before Dean could say anything.
‘Here’ Cas said next to a small table under one the windows, there was a green rotary dial phone on it ‘It’s kind of old, you know how to dial on it?’
Dean helped Cas and his mother to wash the dishes, and then they talked a little more about the town. He learned that Cas studied at a rural school that was a little far from there, but it was smaller and calmer than the town’s high school.
He knew that was all true.
‘Tell me, how’s Castiel doing in the market? Is he treating my clients nicely?’
They rested for a while, but soon started walking again.
“I don’t know you” Cas said “I don’t know if I can like you back… but I think I do”
Cas didn’t look at him, just kept looking forward.
Dean looked around. In between the trees, there were eyes. Eyes that were fixed on them.
As far as I know the society in the Hunger games (in the Capitol at least) seems to be much more extravagant than the present one, they seem to accept and embrace extreme fashion and have little prejudice against anything. Given that it's set in the future, I think it's not that weird of an idea that maybe they'd treat sexuality with way more freedom than we do now, without labels such as "straight" or "gay" but as "anyone is with anyone they like without giving it a thought", which is why we don't really see Dean questioning his sexuality ever, or why it's said that "most boys start with girls" without referencing sexual orientation at all. For Dean is not even a question whether he likes girls, boys or any other gender, everyone just assumes they can fall for anyone.
It was about twenty minutes later that Dean noticed Castiel wasn’t as unaffected as he seemed by the heat and the tiredness. He didn’t turn ti check on Dean once, and still his hands were pulling out from the cluster one berrie at a time, and taking them to his mouth.
Crowley laughed.
Strange as it may be, Dean didn’t feel empowered by that. Dean was scared, because to some extent, he felt exactly the same.
The blizzard hit shortly after that.
Cas didn’t answer this time.
Dean didn’t understand very well at the time. Then she saw Dorothy competing in the trials. He could only imagine Charley cared about her, and tried to keep her from competing, but failed.
“Whoa” he said instinctively as he put his hand on Cas’s back to keep him from falling back “easy there, tiger” he said.
Dean looked away for a second, looking for the right word.
Dean looked at Castiel’s hand, gripping the spear tightly, before he ripped a few berries. His eyes locked in Castiel’s, both boys had expressions on their face that would scare anyone. As he looked into the blue eyes, Dean raised his hand towards his face, and without any hesitation he put the berries on his mouth and started chewing.
They were waiting for Jody on the dressing room when Benny asked him:
“Dean?” Benny insisted.
“It’s not your intentions that I distrust” he said as he started to walk away.
He started following Castiel.
Benny woke him up when it was time to get ready for his interview, he hadn’t even noticed he had fallen asleep, the tablet was lying still on top of his chest when he opened his eyes.
And the audience made some
“Then let’s pretend it's already morning, and you don’t hate me” Dean had whispered back “And just lay with me”
“So much to talk about, right?”
Castiel could be very smart, and fast, but if he really came from the ghettos there was no way he was healthy enough to resist as much as someone who had trained, like Dean. His watch was proving that.
“Benny” Dean said “He’s my best friend”
Cas smiled, and Dean couldn’t help but smile with him.
She was about the same high as Cas, her hair was a light shade of brown and she had blue eyes, just like Cas’, but she also had two purple bags under them.
He remembered Cas coming in, drinking with him. But then things got a little fuzzy… he had kissed Cas.
His back shot up as he tried to stand.
Benny hadn’t sent him anything. At least he hadn’t been called off for what he said.
“Castiel! Castiel stop!”
What other secret could they be talking about?
“Is that why you didn’t sleep last night?” he asked “I know you must have rope on your bag. You could have tied yourself to the tree if you were scared of falling”
Some of them were holding things on their hands, but he couldn’t tell what they were.
“Drank that all by yourself? Pretty impressive” Benny kept going.
Cas blinked.
Dean frowned as he saw his thin figure moving in between the tall plants and huge trees. He didn’t understood Castiel. He hadn’t kill him, but they hadn’t really formed an alliance either. Was Castiel just going to get rid of him once he saw the berries were safe? Or was he planning something else?
He just… didn’t want to.
The entire country had seen that.
“Me neither. Dean, what you got going with Castiel is good for now, for both of you. I don’t know what Castiel will say, but my advice?”
“Welcome back brother” Benny said, smiling at him.
They kept walking.
Gabriel had always taken care of him. It had been a challenge, raising him, but his oldest brother had never complained or asked him for a thing.
Before he knew it, Balthazar was holding his face, firmly, as he pressed his mouth against Castiel’s.
“I saw people” Castiel said, he was resting his head back against the tree “During the day the jungle was quiet, I saw a girl, she was one of the other competitors, the blonde one, it looked like she had decided to settle down for the night. I didn’t talk to her, I don’t think she saw me. Then I climbed the tree, to spend the night there, and when the sun went down, I started hearing noises. Things moving around. They were too many to be competitors. I saw them from the tree, they looked like people. They had weapons, not metal ones like us, it looked like they had made those weapons themselves. They had no clothes on for what I could see”
“Dean?” Cas asked.
Firstly, his life was also going down fast.
And, if he wanted more gifts, and food, he probably should figure out how to make people like them as a team.
