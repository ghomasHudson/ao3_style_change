) and otherworldly blue eyes and beautiful warm soft kind smiles and beautiful warm soft kind hearts and their
When he retreated this time to look back at Cas, the angel exhaled a long breath, eyes fluttering open to meet Dean's nervous ones.
"Go ahead", Cas said, gaining confidence from the fact that Dean seemed to need as much reassurance as he had, everything else melting away inside his head besides the need to make Dean feel comfortable, feel wanted, feel
Dean knew he would doubt at some point. He'd ask himself if this was really happening, ask himself how Cas could possibly return his feelings, think about how he'd never be worthy of the angel's affection, let alone his love. But not now. Now, he pushed it down, felt his angel safe and
It had started like it always did. But when it was usually over, it hadn't ended there. He'd watched how Lucifer left, turned back into Dean, a Dean who looked at him in horror as he understood what had happened. A Dean whose eyes filled with guilt and shame and disgust when he looked at him. A Dean who couldn't stand to be around him after that day. A Dean who had left, and never returned.
, and probably not the ideal example of a caring relationship." Dean has no time to grin at the pun or the meaningfully raised eyebrows. The word
"All of it, Cas", Dean replied without hesitation. "You have all the time in the world. We're doing this for you, remember? Because you asked. This isn't for me. By which I don't mean I don't want you, I do", he added, feeling Cas stiffen slightly in his arms. "But only if it makes you happy okay? Only at your own pace."
"Yeah." Dean nodded, let his eyes wander over the expanse of black silky feathers that shimmered with every subtle movement. "Had only ever seen shadows. Or the burn marks when one of those dicks died. Always wondered what they'd look like. Yours 'specially", he added as an afterthought, because why the fuck not, he'd already crossed the line anyway.
"Oh." Cas looks at his feet and Dean's face heats up a little as he asks himself if Cas has connected the dots, if he wonders if the dream included him. Y'know, with that...
, and not just because you're attractive. Someone...." Dean smiled, overcome by a wave of relief so powerful it almost knocked him off his feet. "Someone who treats you the way you deserve", he ended, stared, couldn't tear his eyes away from Cas if he tried.
"Dean, would you please not moan my Father's name while we're doing this?", he asks dryly, looking down at a very dishevelled Dean who's just about to try and catch his breath. "How would you feel if I called you-"
Which might actually come to his benefit, seeing to that he realises just now he might have forgotten his vows after all. He learned them, he knows he did, and they were there a minute ago, but of course they're gone now, the drawer in his mind spelling nothing but
"How can I help?" His voice was tripping over itself in desperation. "I don't know what to do, Cas, tell me."
Hope you enjoy it, I'll be very excited to hear what you think about this development! Love yall, thanks for reading <3
Before Cas could protest, he took the angel's chin between his thumb and index finger, pulling him up into a deep kiss, soothing him with his tongue, silently telling him that Dean didn't need anything right now, because Cas had already given him everything and more.
with so much care and reverence, Dean could only nod mindlessly, trying and failing to grasp that this was actually about to happen.
Dean let go of Cas' hand, but only to wrap an arm around his waist and hold him closer, happy to find that Cas was sneaking an arm around him in return. The hand that was still stroking Cas' hair settled on the back of his head as Dean closed his eyes, taking a deep breath.
If the feelings had to stay bottled up and caged in then at least there was no risk of Cas walking away because of them.
Cas basically drags Dean forward, following the direction he had pointed him to as well as the path his grace lays out for him.
Dean's voice was soft and soothing, but Cas just shook his head, finally retreating, sitting up so he was kneeling between Dean's legs. The air felt too cold around him all of a sudden, without the angel's body warmth, and Dean felt himself following, drawn up by a magnetic pull until he was sitting as well, close enough to feel like he could breathe, but not too close as not to make Cas uncomfortable while he was obviously trying to put space between them.
He didn't try to stay clear of the area, neither did he make a show of touching them deliberately often, or careful. His hands didn't slow when they approached the uneven patch on Cas' back, stroked in one smooth line from untainted skin over the remains of the sigil and back to the even surface of Cas' shoulders without a single sign that he even noticed the calloused lines beneath his fingers.
He still hadn't come to terms with it. Ha! That would be far too easy for one Dean Winchester. But maybe he'd kind of accepted that it was there. In his defence, it was quite hard to completely deny something that was staring you in the face every damn day. How could you argue away that no matter how much (decidedly not gay) porn you watched, the pictures in front of your inner eye insistently transformed into long, slender fingers, deep blue eyes and a familiar voice, whispering words of passion, safety and lov- ok,
And it's already too late. He knows he's already hurt Cas, so many times he lost count. It's already too late to ever repay the debt he's in. The only thing he can do is see to it that the list doesn't get any longer.
Of course he'd ask and make sure before following his own needs. Of course he would. Dean felt his love for that angel like a physical ache in his chest.
"Okay, okay." He lifts his hands to let them fall down to his lap in defeat. "Yall win." He lets his right hand wander over to Cas' thigh, placing it over the angel's hand that rests there, delighted when he feels Cas hold his in return.
Dean doesn't understand it. He's long given up trying. But if he's what Cas wants, hell if he isn't going to offer every last broken piece of his self on a silver platter. His arms wrap around Cas' back by instinct, drawing him down, recapturing his mouth, every inch of bare skin flush together, and he arches up into him, needs to be closer,
The little retrospect part in italics is for my friend Chelsea. Thanks for the suggestion and location idea, dearest!
with those words reverberating around him in the air and the smile that reflects in them, it's damn near impossible.
They talk about Sam and Eileen, how happy they seem, how happy they are for them. (Dean doesn't mention the jealousy that has buried its ugly teeth in that happiness. He knows he's not entitled. He knows it's not fair to them. He promises himself that none of them will ever notice.) They make fun of how Sam looks like a love-sick puppy whenever he looks at her and Cas laughs, unaware that Dean is directing the same sort of look at him. They talk about Jack and what they think Heaven might look like now. They tell each other stories about the kid and smile. They laugh together and for the first time in weeks, maybe months, Cas feels at ease.
Pushing down the hunter’s anxiety about having lost sight of Miracle, he turned around, forcing himself to look at the little creek that ran through the woods instead. It was picturesque and perfect, and it should have made him feel at peace. He should have been at peace for weeks now, after they had killed Chuck and he’d woken up in the hospital alive despite that last disastrous hunt. He should be happy that Miracle was back, and Sam was still there, and that while he’d been in the hospital Eileen had somehow found her way back to the Bunker. He should be happy that his little brother was happy and that for once in their lives they had some damn peace.
Dean swallowed, a dark feeling churning in his stomach where relief should have set in by now. If Cas already knew, he wouldn’t have to stumble over the biggest hurdle in all of this: Actually putting into words what he wanted. But the way Cas had said it, the rigidity with which he still pressed against the railing on the other side of the bridge, didn’t suggest Cas knew. Whatever Cas thought he knew, he must have come to the wrong conclusions.
Cas said nothing, standing still as a statue. He was only two steps away, but it felt like miles. The silence that ensured was unbearable.
But Cas is a little shit with no shame, so, of course he won’t let Dean off the hook that easily. “Want to elaborate on that?”
It takes every ounce of willpower he has to stay where he is, to let Cas comfort him and comfort Cas in turn. Somehow he does. It’s Cas who separates them, kissing his shoulder and then the corner of his jaw as he pushes Dean away just a little bit. Just enough to look at him. He reaches up, thumbs brushing away something wet from the corners of Dean’s eyes.
So he continued. Slowly, carefully, gentle rubs of his fingertips, cautious not to cause any pain or discomfort.
Dean sighs, stopping in his tracks, pinches the bridge of his nose before rubbing his tired eyes. He can't look at Cas. Not while he's saying this. Not while he forces him to say this.
Cas sounds calm and serious as ever and Dean sputters slightly at his words, both in an attempt to suppress a chuckle and in surprise about the...the-
"You're going to come back", he found himself saying instead, the sentence hanging between question and statement.
"But you're not-" Dean struggled for words. "You're not human", he blurted out, and no those were not the right ones, not the ones he'd wanted to say, not the ones he meant-
If he drowned and died, perhaps he wouldn't have to face the damage he'd done, the damage he knew he could never undo.
"Oh yeah, sure, don't worry." Dean grins at him, because yes, he is alright. Now he is. "It's not that I'm getting cold feet or somethin'", he jokes as he smoothes over inexistent wrinkles in Cas' shirt, just to be touching as well.
"Cas? Sweetheart, open your eyes", Dean asked, "Please, look at me." And the worry in his voice urged Cas to follow, relieved to find the stinging in his eyes gone once they opened to meet Dean's.
, pervert), and if he'd had any hesitation it was certainly blown away a second later when dream-Cas
"It's only been a few weeks, Dean." Cas' thumb strokes soothingly over the skin right under Dean's elbow. "I don't expect you to-"
"Yeah." Dean breathed out at that, but it was barely a second before his features tensed again, brow furrowed and jaw tight. "Guess he got what he came for."
They need a fifth chair now, Dean realises, and for a second an image flashes through his mind, the thought that he could just scoot over to Cas' chair, sit in his lap under the cover of having to make room for Jack. Sam would probably tease him, but it's not as if he hasn't already, Cas wouldn't mind, Dean's sure he wouldn't mind, maybe he would even welcome it, would enjoy the stolen moments of closeness as much as Dean would. He wouldn't even need to ask, could just move and do it, just reach out and...
"So...we won't..." Cas still seemed hesitant, he lowered his eyes, stroked a thumb over the back of Dean's hand as if seeking reassurance. "We won't go back to the way things were?"
"Oh." Cas seemed to recoil into himself once more, which should have been nearly impossible in his crouching position against the headboard. "I see."
Dean presses the heels of his palms against his temples and listens to the water splashing in the sink. It's the middle of the night, and he's had one of those dreams
"I gotta-" Dean pressed his lips together in a thin line, opened his mouth, sighed. "I can't go on like this, I shouldn't-"
"You could have", Cas heard himself say over the blood pounding in his ears. "I went there with you. I came there with
So he'd held back. He'd stopped Dean, stopped himself, stopped whatever had been happening between them before it went too far and ruined everything.
"Being touched." Cas tried to sound casual, as if the thought didn't terrify (and excite, and scare, and thrill) the shit out of him. It didn't work. "In...ah. Different ways", he said vaguely, trying not to lose his nerves. He focused on Dean's eyes, followed them as they lowered to where Cas' feet were tucked under Dean's calves.
Dean wanted to kneel down next to the bed, bury his fingers in his hair, smooth out the crease on his forehead with his lips, kiss those bruises until they were nothing but a faded memory. He wanted to keep kneeling on the hard floor and hold Cas' hand until he couldn't feel his legs anymore, wanted to tell him how sorry he was, wanted to beg for forgiveness he didn't deserve.
Dean's eyes widen at that thought and he breaks the kiss, panting in surprise. The realisation had come uninvitedly, but now that it's there, Dean's sure he'd actually felt that way for some time now. So what if it
"You're so beautiful", Dean heard himself say, couldn't care because it was so damn true. "So good for me, Cas."
"Thank you, Dean." The corner of Cas' mouth twitched, and Dean wanted to kiss him so badly.  "That was...very thoughtful."
He instinctively lifted their hands to his lips, brushed them over Cas' knuckled in a featherlight kiss, and indeed, that drew the angel's attention back to his face, eyes snapping up, green meeting blue, and Dean almost thought to notice a light hitch in Cas' breath.
Instead, he focused on the remains of his grace, let it surge through his body and into his back, out of this plane and into his wings on the other side to draw them through the veil. A drop of sweat rolled down his temple from the mixed ache in his body and the effort of using power he was barely able to scratch together, but he concentrated and it worked.
Many days will find Dean and Cas shopping together as they had before, only that Dean is confident enough to take Cas' hand on his own by now, leading him down the aisles with sure steps and a warm grip. Cas still always wears his trenchcoat when they go out, even now that Dean has been stocking the closet in their new bedroom with a bunch of everyday clothes for the angel. He likes to see Cas wearing them, not as much as he likes Cas wearing
. And I'm sure of this, this life, with you. I love you...and I will keep loving you until I take my last breath, and beyond."
"Sorry." Dean shakes his head, curses himself under his breath. "That wasn't- I had no right to ask that-"
"Cas..." He forced his eyes up, knew the words bubbling up in his throat weren't enough, would never be enough, but he had to say it anyway. "Cas, I'm so sorry. I'm so-
"Oh", Cas looks down, pretends having to watch his feet while he steps over a root, "it wasn't important."
He just kept going, kissed along Cas' jaw, down his neck, hips rocking, thighs trembling under Cas' palm.
. I needed to know that I mean something to the one person that I care about like no other", he heard himself say, knew the words to be true as they left his mouth. "I needed to be loved. But not just by anyone. I needed
I was at my parents' work today. Waiting a lot. Used it for writing. So here you go;) Thought you wouldn't mind the early update, ehe.
"No, Cas!" Dean throws the vial on the bed and gets up, pointing at it in accusation while he crosses the room. "Why would you do that and- without even asking me? I thought we're-"
There's a flicker in Cas' eyes as Dean slips out of his reach. Hurt, Dean thinks for a split second, but it's gone so quickly, he can't be sure. He's never been sure about anything concerning Cas and feelings, Cas's feelings, his own. He should be sure now, shouldn't he. He should, with those words still reverberating in the air around them, echoing in his ears. If Dean could only understand them, he wished... But he's picking them apart in his mind, unwrapping each impossible word, tries to arrange them in a way that makes sense to him, fails miserably.
(I'm also terribly behind with answering all your wonderful comments, the end of lecture time is crazy rn, forgive me. But rest assured that I love and appreciate every single one of you and literally live on the lovely things you bless me with in the comments.)
He's moving through the group of people like in a trance, barely aware who or what he passes, solely focused on that one point in the universe, that one man his own universe has long been built around.
"It's not your fault", Cas says, because of course Cas would tell him that. He knows about the unreasonable sting of guilt inside him before Dean even noticed it himself. "It's just nice to see you without worry or pain written all over your face. And at night...I guess I can just enjoy that look for a while, get lost in the fantasy that you could always look as...free."
"I know." Dean nods, but there's resistance in his voice. "I mean in theory, I know, it's just..." Dean looks at him, and the look in his eyes shatters something inside of the angel. There's desperation there, a question, the longing for an answer, the fear to get one. "I don't really know how to do it, Cas", Dean admits, trying to hide the vulnerability by looking away. But Cas knows. He's seen it, he hears it,
What's wrong? Is there something wrong? But there's no time for that right now. Hug first. His body moves of its own when he steps forward and pulls Cas tightly against him, soaking in the solid warmth in his arms. The angel is stiff for a moment before he relaxes a little, hesitantly placing his arms on the hunter's back in return. He feels reserved, Dean can't help but think, it's not the same way it usually is, with the two of them basically melting into each other's touch. Not that Dean has studied their hug-development over the years or anything. Haha. Yeah. No. Anyway.
"I love him" Dean's voice was barely a whisper. "I love him, and I always have. I didn't say it back. He doesn't know".
Sam thought for a moment before replying, trying one of the fries tentatively. “Dean knows better than to lash out like that, but your right, he isn’t ok. That isn’t an excuse, but I can’t imagine any of this is easy for him.” Sam shook his head sadly. “This is all much more complicated than him losing the love of his life, because that love….” Sam trailed off as if in memory.
Rowena looked at him carefully before replying. “Well, I might have known a few witches while I was alive that used to commune with Freyja. None were ever able to summon her though, the ingredients for the spell were too rare”.
"We have always known he was in love with you, Dean. Hell, there were times I was pretty sure you loved him back" Sam tried for a chuckle, but it fell flat. Dean had shifted and was looking intently at his mug. "oh," Sam breathed.
Warm water was falling over Dean’s head and back, wrapping him in a comfort he didn’t quite feel. It helped, though. Sam had told him he had to shower and eat, and then they could visit Rowena in Hell. So Dean was showering. Dean turned and opened his eyes, spotting Cas’ shampoo. Before he could think about what he was doing, he was lathering the smell of sandalwood and home into his hair. The familiar scent comforting him. It smelled like all those times he had stood a little closer to Cas, or Dean had sat next to him talking for hours on end. Now that he thought about it, it really had been obvious. Completely blindingly obvious how much Cas loved him, and more still, how desperately Dean loved him back. He was still showering, basking in pleasant memories, when he heard Sam Calling.
Neither Sam nor Jack looked surprised. They exchanged reassured looks as if they had already known or suspected, at least, what had happened. "You don't look surprised," Dean stated, more of a question.
“Dean, this is hardly the time to be drinking!” Sam seemed adamant and stern. Dean didn’t like it one bit. He was so confused, he couldn’t process all this. Soul bonds, no soul bonds, great new cosmic entities…It was all just too much.
Sam shook his head, dejected. “We have everything we need, everything except the blood, and there is no way to get it. We had better tell Dean. He is going to be devastated.”
Dean’s heart was racing again, in the way it only ever did around Cas. “Well, thank you, … for…um…stepping in when you did,” Dean swallows, looking to Cas’s lips briefly, before looking back up to his eyes, and taking a half step closer. Cas is nodding slightly, a soft, sad smile on his lips. Dean shakes his head, breaking the tension of the moment with a joke as he turns away from Cas. “What did Sam say? Does he want a divorce?” the chuckle didn’t quite reach his eyes.
The Empty had been making Castiel replay all his worst moments. His failures and shortcomings, the times he let Dean down. All the times he left for the greater good even though it broke his heart. She would always laugh maniacally before making him relive a truly happy memory, only to interrupt it with taunts and physical pain, the likes of which Cas had never felt before.
Sam was sitting in the library, reading another book on the mythological origins of love. Another book about using witchcraft to make someone fall in love with you and how it is impossible. According to the text, temporary infatuation could be achieved with a well-placed hex bag, but nothing genuinely love. How will this ever help us? Sam sighed and closed the book, placing his head in his hands. From the looks of it, Jack and Dean weren’t doing much better. Dean had outright fallen asleep, his face planted firmly over the open book on the table before him. Dean must be dreaming because he kept muttering to himself.
“How does that change anything?” Jack seemed perplexed. “People love who they love. Why does it matter that Cas’ vessel is male?”
“At least temporarily, it’s a long story…Crowley, stolen grace…there’s a female outside in the car.” Cas stumbles slightly on his words, eying dean affectionately. Dean is standing closer now and cocks his head in confusion. Why is there a woman in the car? “Another time,” Cas adds, looking into Dean’s eyes.
Dean was holding tightly to the tie in his pocket, running the smooth blue fabric between his fingers. Slowly, he withdrew it from his pocket. Somehow it seemed bluer here, not as blue as his angel’s eyes, they were more of a sapphire colour, but the tie was a rich navy. He held it out for Rowena to see, but would not let it go.
Castiel was screaming inside as the angel blade slipped down his forearm and into his hand. His limbs were outside his control, moving to strike Dean.
“You get anything?” Sam turned to ask Jack, who was lounging on a chair, his feet up on the armrest while reading a lore book on Celestial Bonds.
“How are you, Dean?” Jack’s voice was calm and kind, but tense. Jack was eying Dean closely, as though assessing if the trip to Hell had damaged him.
When Dean got home from his drive, he didn’t do much, fetched a beer from the fridge, and went to sit in Cas’s room. It seemed to be a habit lately. Dean would retreat to Cas’s room, sit on his bed and think. He felt closer to Cas there. He had stored his Jacket, the one with Cas’s handprint on it, in the drawer of Cas’s bedside table. Dean took a swig of his beer and pulled out the jacket. Holding it close to his chest, he began to pray. “Cas, I don’t know if you have your ears on, or if you can even listen from in there, but if you can hear me…” He paused, clearing his throat. “I want you to know, no…need you to know…I love you too buddy, and I’m coming for you. I don’t care if I have to rip through every freaking wall in the universe to do it. I just…I need you, man. I love you, and I don’t know how much longer I can go on living without you. So…Hang in there. I’m coming for you.”
Dean was headed back to his room when he suddenly realized he wasn’t in his own room, but Cas’. It looked the same as always. A neatly made bed laid in the center of the room, and there was very little to distinguish it from any of the other empty rooms in the Bunker. The neatly hung suites, blue ties, and bedside table were all that was left of Cas. Until Dean managed to bring him home, of course. A small gleam of hope bloomed inside him, though he was not overly optimistic. The only beings powerful enough to take a soul from the empty are Chuck and Death, and neither would do it.
"That's how love feels, Dean, being able to see the true person, for all that they are, for all of their flaws, and still think they are amazing."
Dean slowly retrieved the tie from his pocket and looked at it. “This should work” he gazed at the tie, again picturing his angel wearing it, pulling in those sapphire eyes towards his own, and holding his angel close to him. “But I’m keeping it until it’s time for the spell.”
Dean awoke screaming, pleading, calling for Cas. He was covered in sweat, vaguely aware of people rushing in around him.
Sam just stared, dumbfounded, and then said, “Dean, Cas rescued you from Hell, rebelled against heaven rather than kill you, more than once, you went to Purgatory to find him when you had the mark of Kain you nearly killed him, but you didn’t. Chuck has never been able to control your story. It’s part of what he hates about us so much. He can’t figure out why he doesn’t have complete control over you or Cas.”
“Yes, Dean, you are.” It was Rowena who spoke this time. “When Castiel first met you, you were torturing Souls in Hell. He flew in and grabbed you by your soul, rebuilt your body and raised you from perdition.” She paused for a moment to let that sink in. “He has seen you torture, and Kill, he has seen you bear the mark of Kain and murder endlessly, he saw you gallivanting with my Fergus as a daemon, and yet, he still loves you” Rowena paused, looking closely at Dean “What is in your pocket?"
“Cas, Cas…Torture…Couldn’t reach him….kept running… Dream… black everything…Couldn’t reach him,” Dean babbled, looking around frantically, gripping Sam tightly as he did so. Jack, looking concerned, got up from the chair and walked purposefully over to Dean placing a finger to Dean’s temple. There was a brief white glow, and Dean calmed, head resting on the table again, almost asleep.
Jack took a tentative bite “it’s not that bad Sam” he said. He chewed on another bite of the burger before asking “Dean doesn’t seem ok. I don’t think he meant to invalidate your relationship with Eileen, but sometimes I think he is so caught up in his own pain he can’t see past it. What happened with Rowena?”
Hi folks, I have the rest of the story outlined now and hope to have the rest written by the time I go back to work on the 11th. As always, your comments and feedback are appreciated. I hope you like what I have so far. :)
As he turned around he could see Sam standing there, fists clenched, eyes livid. “You aren’t the only one who lost someone, Dean.” Sam’s voice was full of hurt and sadness. “In fact, I have lost someone more than once, so maybe I don’t get exactly what it’s like to lose an angel… but I lost Eileen twice ok, so you can take your drink and shove it if you think you are the only one who is suffering.”
Darkness, complete and utter darkness surrounded him. He was looking around frantically but the darkness was so uniform and thick it was impossible to tell up from down. It was completely quiet. He turned around and then “Hello Clarence” a woman resembling Meg appeared on a throne in front of him. Her face was far from merciful, bent with loathing and enmity. “Bet you thought it was cute, sacrificing yourself for your little boyfriend”. She pulled the last word out, dragging it out for emphasis. “Oh right, not really your boyfriend was he? Tell me, was it worth it, pining forever and dying, all-knowing he would never love you back?” Her face contorted into a wicked smile.
"It didn't work." Dean smiled sadly, his voice soft. "The reason I went there. I did it as a distraction, but...it didn't work. I still couldn't stop thinking about you."
He cast a last sad glance towards Dean as he turned, ready to walk away, away from this mess, away from Dean.
But he also knew that he couldn't have done anything differently. At the end of the day, he'd always go with Dean, always return to him, follow him, wherever he went.
The images kept trying to invade his mind, but the fear, guilt and worry shining from those green eyes kept him anchored in the present.
Dean didn't exactly make a show of taking his boxers off, just a few quick, efficient movements and they were gone, and Cas could just stare, admire the last part of Dean's body they hadn't revealed so far. It was not his first time seeing Dean in all of his naked glory, despite the years that had passed since he'd put Dean's body back together in Hell he remembered every detail like yesterday, could tell the exact amount of freckles...but the purpose behind it gave this moment a completely new meaning, and Cas a whole new insight and admiration.
What is it, that peculiar power Dean seems to have over him? It has been very uncomfortable at first. A smile could clear his head of all thoughts. A touch let his throat go dry. An image popped up in his mind at night, unbidden, refusing to be banned. And his vessel, weak, human thing that it is, acted appropriately to those thoughts...
you go! I have to warn you though, it's built around a rape/non-con scenario, so even though it will be heavily focused on the healing process, if that's not your cup of tea or you might be uncomfortable with that, please heed the tags and warnings and look after yourselves first!
Sometimes along the way, it had made him feel lost. He didn't even know his purpose anymore. As an angel in heaven, he'd loved and served God. That was his purpose. As an angel first on earth, he learned to love humanity. That was his purpose. But then, he'd fallen. Fallen from grace, and fallen in love. And as a fallen angel, he'd discovered a new kind of love, love for a single human being, love that was different from everything he'd experienced before. The love he'd known, it had been nothing but a pale imitation of the real thing. This love for Dean, it was overwhelming, all-encompassing, frightening. It was beautiful. Like...Dean's love for pie versus his love for Sam. Even though you used the same word, the meaning behind the feeling was entirely different.
"Don't..." He knew he shouldn't do it, shouldn't hold Cas back, not when there was nothing waiting for the angel here, nothing worth staying for. Still, he couldn't stop himself. "Please, don't go home with him."
It was him. It was always him. Everything in Cas' life leads to him. All his words, all his days, all his decisions, all for him.
Also, I'm a sucker for soft Sam and Cas, ok? Don't judge me. That's all I'm saying as excuse for this.
He took the hand resting on his face and entwined their fingers for emphasis, leading it to his mouth so he could press a tender kiss to Cas' palm. The angel's eyes filled with tears, but he quickly blinked them away, resting his forehead against Dean's.
, Dean has said, and how on earth is Cas supposed to choose what to do out of all the things that word makes possible. He goes for the closest thing at hand and presses his lips to the hunter's once more, harder, hungrier than before. Dean lets him, matches Cas' pace. The first kisses had been slow, chaste almost, just lips pressing together, lips moving in unison, sweet and perfect.
Dean lies on his back, blanket drawn up to his waist, his head settled on one of his arms. He's staring at the ceiling, but Cas can see the frown furrowing his brow before his head turns around to lock eyes with the angel.
doesn't want to. His breath hitches in his throat when he watches Cas' hand move instead, fingers slowly and carefully threading with his.
He just wishes it'd be that easy to find the perfect means of communication for everyone. (And with everyone he means Dean and Cas. Obviously.)
"I like how the light catches in your feathers", he said, because he didn't know what else to say. "It's like the reflection in motor oil. Bet they look awesome in the sun."
It isn't something he'd had to deal with in the past. Because Dean Winchester, in general, doesn't get rejected, no one turns down sparkling green eyes and a seductive smile. It's been enough to get him through most doors and into most beds. But this is not a random hookup.
So Cas nodded, not bothering to hide the tears of relief and gratitude in his eyes, and Dean smiled, pulling him into his arms before the tears could start to fall, a hand driving soothingly through his hair.
, Cas hisses, and Dean wastes no time before he frees them both of the last remaining items of clothing. He pushes Cas to lie on his back and the angel instantly reaches for Dean to follow, welcomes him in his arms and they moan in unison when their erections brush together. They enjoy the pressure for a moment, perfectly lined up, the feeling of skin on skin. Then Dean reaches between them, takes them both in hand, and Cas bucks his hips and throws his head back with a moan of something that could be Dean's name. He leans down to capture the angel's mouth in a kiss, swallows all those sweet sounds Cas is making, because why shouldn't he, they're his to own, anyway.
Dean sat on the bed and looked at the bedside table. A picture of himself looked back at him. Dean was smiling; one arm draped across Cas’s shoulders. Beside it lay a mixed tape, Led Zeplin top 13. Dean had given that to Cas a while ago, but yet Cas kept it so close. Dean wondered how Cas had missed what he meant by giving it to him. He supposed he could have been more direct about it.
Dean looked up as Cas spoke. “No, it wouldn’t kill me…I…just…you…” Cas trailed off, looking at Dean with his clear sapphire eyes, trench coat open to reveal his white button-up shirt and black pants.
Sam ate the last of the fries, shifting slightly in his seat while he thought. “Dean doesn’t know I know what happened. It was one of the only times I saw Dean really cry growing up. So, the fact that he thinks there is something wrong with him, that he is broken, irreparable, and useless, really comes down to him hiding who he is until he couldn’t love himself, or know himself anymore.” Sam looked around at the eerily empty restaurant. “So, the fact that he is in love with Cas, that he lost him, that he thought he lost the ability to ever be himself, that he loves Cas, and hates himself for loving him, and hates himself for hating that he loves him, and may be bound to him stronger than any of us previously thought…..I think it’s just too much to sort through right now.”
He shouldn't be the one that needed soothing now, Cas shouldn't have to comfort or explain or- wait. What was that?
Most of Cas' body was thankfully hidden beneath the blanket, but there was an arm splayed out on top of it, scratch marks across the shoulder, a hint of the bandages visible that covered his back, bruises, some displaying fingers that Dean knew fit his own hand perfectly, a grotesque mirror of the handprint he had once worn himself. But that had been a mark proclaiming an act of saving, whilst this was just a stain, a leftover reminder of an attack, a violation. It didn't even help to know that the marks would fade, leaving the skin as if it had never been blemished in the first place, because that would be nothing but an optical illusion, a mockery of the true damage that lay underneath and could never be undone. Even in the dimly lit room Dean could clearly see the dark circles under Cas' eyes that stood out even more against the paleness of his skin. His face was twitching in his sleep, features contorted in discomfort.
"You know what, never mind." He just wants to disappear through the door as quickly as possible when a sigh from Cas stops him.
It was the only thing left, the deepest cuts the angel blade had carved into Cas' skin, lines and shapes Dean hadn't really seen ever since it hadn't been necessary to bandage them anymore. Dean had known they would probably leave scars but...
to start, and as soon as the first notes fill the air, Cas feels like he's floating. He would recognize that melody anywhere, has been listening to it countless times, and it's one of Cas' favourite songs, one of the songs he didn't even think Dean would remember. (He'd given Dean a mixtape of his own (Sam helped him with it), but he hadn't been able to resist and made it Cas' Top 13 Taylor Swift Traxx. And even though this song isn't part of it, it's so perfect he doesn't even mind it's not one of the Taylor Swift songs.)
His tongue suddenly felt too heavy in his mouth as he stared at Dean, watched how he sighed, drove a hand over his eyes and finally turned to face him.
He shifts slightly, still half lying down but turns enough to look at Dean. He watches how the hunter's expression takes on a doubtful shadow, insecurity nagging at the hopeful shimmer in his eyes and making him nervously bite his lip.
He couldn't tell, though. Something behind Cas' eyes had hardened, his grip on Dean's shirt loosening until he drew back completely, putting space between himself and Dean who had to lean against the wall for support.
"Okay. Stay there", he ordered, shifting until Cas' tip was lined up with his entrance. "Just like that. Just stay still, okay? Can you do that for me?"
He hadn't even been aware of the touch before Dean drew his attention to it, and now his skin seemed to be burning at the contact. Just for a second, he had to suppress the need to draw away. If Dean noticed his legs shifting, he didn't let it show.
Note that in the middle part, everything in italics happened before the first part of this took place, that's why it's in past tense and emphasized this way bc I was afraid the timeline would be confusing...
"I know we never-" Cas stared down on his hands in his lap, his brow drawn together. "A-And if you don't want, that's fine, I..."
Dean had reached for Cas' hand, traced his thumb over the ring before pointing at the middle part, a slightly rougher and darker-coloured stripe of metal, separated from the outer silver of the ring by two shallow grooves.
"I'm gonna sit over here, okay?" He pointed to the chair he'd previously occupied. "I won't come closer than that, promise."
"And yes, I am more than okay with this being permanent. I've gone on long enough without the gift of your touch, the comfort of our closeness. I know this love has existed a long time before we dared to express it, and I was content, getting to love you from afar, I saw it as a privilege."
And what for? What was the purpose of all that masquerading, all that trying to be someone you're not, just to find out that all your efforts have been for fucking nothing because your undertaking had been doomed to failure all along?
Cas' fingers clenched down more tightly around Dean's, just like the clench Dean could feel in his chest.
"Oh don't be like that." Sam gives him a scolding glance, but there's fondness underneath, visibly breaking through in the smile that hides in the corner of his mouth. "Come on, dude. It's not as if I could possibly have missed those creepy longing gazes and touching for no apparent reason...", he teases, the smile growing wider.
"Oh, I wasn't worried." Sam's eyebrows shoot up at that, but Jack just shrugs his shoulders. "I just noticed that something was different. I can't really describe it. It's just something about the energy of their bond, that's slightly-"
He suddenly felt very tired, mentally drained somehow as he got up and walked over to the other side of the room to slump down on an empty barstool, staring at the bowl of peanuts so he wouldn't be tempted to look back, counting them like he'd spent nights and nights counting Dean's freckles.
"Geez, Cas, no!" Dean tightens his legs around Cas' waist, pulls him in, doesn't care how needy he looks. He intertwines their fingers, squeezes the angel's hands. "Please, anything, but don't you dare stop!"
those simple words do things to Dean. Decidedly uncool things he's not ready to get into now, or later, or ever.
"Please", Cas breathed, and Dean was sure he couldn't have waited for another second if he tried. He surged up, a hand curled around Cas' neck pulling the angel down to meet him in a kiss, hungry and reverent at the same time as Dean's tongue searched and found reassurance in his angel's mouth.
Silence settled between them for some time after that, and Dean couldn't help but be grateful for it, a break from remembering things he desperately craved to forget, from having to give answers to questions he didn't have an answer to.
He stares at the glass in his hand, lets the liquor sway around. It's been his friend, alcohol. The one thing that doesn't ask questions, doesn't judge. It's merciful. It makes him forget. It makes the feelings go away, if even for just a little while.
who he cares about more than anyone besides Sammy, this is Cas who had saved him more times than he could count or ever repay, this is Cas, his best friend Cas, sweet, innocent, brave, strong, perfect Cas - this is Cas who Dean
Oh fuck it, no more pretty lies. He's just kidding himself, anyway. He's far from unaware of his feelings for Cas. He just knows there's no point. They're inappropriate, they're impossible, they're fucking
"I know this is too much to ask of you", Cas' mouth went on, apologetic and pleading for forgiveness Dean probably didn't even know he needed, "and I wouldn't have if I thought there was anyone else, I'd-believe me, Dean, I-"
Dean held the angel's gaze, stared into the blue depths, searching, looking for anything that showed him signs of hesitance, doubt, fear. He didn't find any. Just nervousness, determination, love. And want.
"I'm as happy as I have any right to be", he told Dean truthfully. "You and Sam have given me more than I could have hoped for. You invited me into your home, your family. And I'm very grateful."
"Fuck." Dean broke their eye contact, driving a hand over his face, and Cas had to blink a few times. "I wish I could come over and comfort you right now, Cas, you have no idea. But don't worry, I won't", he added hurriedly when Cas flinched involuntarily (and cursed himself for it), "I won't touch you. Not as long as you don't ask me to."
He desperately wanted to touch Cas, to comfort him, to love him until all that self-doubt was gone and forgotten.
"'m fine", he mumbled against the skin of the angel's neck, wanted to hide there, to stay here forever, but when a hand tangled in his hair, gently guiding his head back, he still followed despite the slight whimper leaving his throat.
"I admit it wasn't the most...thoughtful way, perhaps", Cas interrupts him, "but I- I was afraid you'd try to talk me out of it."
There. His fingers close around the square object and he peeks one eye out of the white softness to find the pause button. Ripping the headphones out of his ears, he lets everything fall down on the floor next to his bed and slumps back down into the mattress.
A small smile appeared on Cas lips at that, quickly transforming into a whimper of Dean's name when he let his thumb swipe over Cas' tip through his boxers, spreading the damp patch that had formed there.
Dean hums in acknowledgement, buries his nose in Cas' hair and just breathes him in for a moment, seeking confirmation once more that all this is real, that all this is his.
"Dean, you- you still misunderstand me", he says, keeps smiling. Dean can't quite decide if it's a happy or a sad smile. "It's not that I don't
He tried to give the angel an encouraging smile, and maybe it worked, for Cas let him guide their joined hands down, placing them on his chest, just above his heart. (Total coincidence, of course.)
He breaks off when Sam closes his eyes with a deep sigh, the hand that had been a warm, grounding weight falls from his shoulder, leaving it cold and empty like the void in Dean's chest. His brother shakes his head to himself, almost invisibly, but when he speaks again, there's a smile in his voice.
He knows he has no right to feel like this. He has no claim on Cas, none. Cas has never been his to lose.
"Dean." And finally, the angel's hand reaches out to lightly settle over Dean's. The hunter stares at it for a second, his brain failing to catch up with what's happening. But he can't look for long. He has to look at Cas' face again, he
There had been plenty of offers, but he couldn't go through with it. Even flirting felt wrong. His faked smiles were painful, their eyes shamelessly checking him out from head to toe made him wish they were warm and blue instead of dark with desire. The fleeting touches of slim delicate hands made his skin crawl.
"I'm an angel", Cas explains, "so I'm technically agender, but I'm still in a male body, and he..." He trails off, shrugs again.
"Yes", Cas said, and then he stepped back. Dean almost slipped a whine at the loss of warmth and contact, but Cas was unbuttoning his shirt and Dean's eyes were glued to the stripe of tan skin it revealed, and then the white fabric was gone completely and
"Oh..." Cas still sounded surprised, but was full-on smiling up at him now, making Dean's insides all gooey and fluttery. "I'm...glad you think so."
Was this the way Dean behaved when he cared for people?, he asked himself, resting his head against Dean's shoulder. Or could he be foolish enough to hope it was just the way he behaved when he cared for Cas? Staying night and day, tending to every need with thoughtful consideration, kind words, careful touches.
With his heart rate returning to normal, the memory ebbing away, Cas slowly regained consciousness of where he was, what he'd been doing, what had happened. His eyes filled with tears, his throat choked as the first one trailed down his cheek.
The angel looks at him for a moment, that typical unreadable Cas-face, squinted eyes and head-tilt that Dean has long given up pretending doesn't drive him crazy. He feels scrutinized, but can't look away, his tongue darting out to unconsciously wet his lips. For a second he almost thinks Cas' eyes may have flitted down to his mouth, but he quickly dismisses the thought as a game of his imagination. The blue eyes blink, and the moment is over.
he was. He didn't mind that Dean couldn't voice his needs yet. Cas would make it good for him, in whatever way Dean would let him.
"I'm sure whatever her name was who appeared so enthusiastic earlier is eagerly awaiting your return as well."
Dean gaped at him, thunderstruck, Cas could basically watch the wheels in his head turning, attempting to process Cas' words. He just wasn't sure if he wanted Dean to get the real meaning behind them or not.
Cas loved it. Despite talking to Dean and how he'd assured Cas that he didn't want to hide in front of Sam or anyone else, Cas knew his beloved well enough to be aware that it might be easier said than done. He was delighted to find that Dean seemed as affectionate in front of Sam as he'd been in the previous months they'd spent alone at the bunker.
"I need you as my wingman!", Dean had said, clapping Cas on the shoulder. What Cas didn't know was that in subtext it translated to something along the lines of
Castiel, the angel who had fallen for him (in more ways than one). Castiel, the angel who had died for him (more than once). Castiel, the angel he would die for. And, he discovered, Castiel, the angel he would live for.
Not that it was uncomfortable. Far from it. Dean was actually totally on board with it, especially when Cas released a breath against his neck and unconsciously rolled his hips in a tiny movement to grind against Dean in his sleep. Oh
"Yeah." Dean quickly interrupted the angel's stuttering, smiling calmly despite the fluttery feeling in his belly. "Yeah, okay. Sure."
"You sure there isn't anything else you need?", he mumbled, pressing a little kiss to whatever skin he could reach.
"Dean?" Cas furrows his brow when Dean lies down next to him, urging the angel to roll over on top of him again. His hand feels for one of Cas' and he bites his lip when he guides it down, up his thigh and to that place to indicate what he doesn't know how to ask for with words.
The reply was sure and immediate despite the breathiness in Cas' voice, and Dean just couldn't help but kiss him again before he leaned over to retrieve the bottle of lube from the nightstand, making sure to warm it between his fingers. Cas was watching him, swallowed thickly, but he left his legs open and relaxed, once Dean's hand returned to its task.
The end of this with Cas cooking (and failing) was inspired by something Misha said (in a cameo I think?) about how he would imagine Cas planning a date. Needless to say I loved his answer too much to let the idea go to waste.
It's a bit awkward, the same kind of awkward that had been lying over the room ever since Dean asked him to stay, and still, it's not
Instead of an answer, Cas kisses him, but it conveys all the hunter needs to know. He gasps into the angel's mouth as soon as he feels Cas slowly easing in, buries his fingers in Cas' back, sure to leave marks. But the angel keeps kissing him through it, distracts him until the initial burn is replaced by pleasure, a sense of connection and unity once Cas is settled inside him.
"No", he said, because how could he possibly deny it any longer? "I...couldn't stand the thought of you being with someone...someone else", Dean admitted, small, quiet, as close to the whole picture as he could manage right now.
"You kissed me", he simply states, eyebrows drawn together. "I'd like to think you'd only do that because you love me. And that's all I need to know, Dean." Dean manages to look hope- and doubtful at the same time, causing a fond smile to spread over Cas' face. "Because..." He bites his lip, swallows the surge of embarrassment. This is nothing to be embarrassed about. This is a time of truth, of sharing his truth with Dean the way he's always wanted to, so he does. "Of course I'm drawn to you, physically. But that's not- Not why I'm doing this. What I said, back then. I meant it, Dean. I meant all of it. I love you. I'm
Cas looks up from his book when he hears the dog whimper. He'd been lying next to Cas' chair, but has grown increasingly restless over the last half hour. When Cas puts Jane Austen aside, Miracle jumps to his feet, looking at him expectantly.
He'd left with Dean, had followed him outside, had slid into the Impala's passenger seat, and he'd sat through the drive in silence as the road flew by, taking them home.
Dean let his fingers close around Cas' erection and swept his thumb over the tip to spread the precome gathered there, smoothing his strokes.
All names are made up by somebody else and Dean had, without knowing it, stripped the name given by his father of its heavenly duty. The
Or inappropriately. Considering it's his best friend we're talking about. His best friend who'd definitely not want him thinking those thoughts.
"Dean, are you alright?" He carefully moved closer but stopped when the hunter gave him another look, something in those eyes freezing Cas to the spot. "Did I do something wrong? Did I somehow hurt you?"
"Shit, Cas." His arms were already reaching out to pull Cas back in, even the few inches between them suddenly too much distance to bear. "Okay. Okay, c'mere."
"How bad is it?", he asked instead through gritted teeth, eyes lowered to the mattress between his knees.
He liked it when his partners enjoyed themselves at least as much as he did. To be honest, he could even get off on pleasing the other person, it made him feel powerful and...worthy.
you accepted that you loved me, Dean. And it saved me. Don't you see? We are connected so deeply that the Empty couldn't take me, not as long as you remain here on Earth.
"You say that as if it were a reprehensible thing", Cas says slowly, watching Dean intensely. "You've done so much, for so many people. And most don't even know that they owe their lives to you." Dean closes his eyes and Cas feels the need to touch him but holds back. "There's no shame in letting it rest now, Dean", he softly tells him instead. "You've done your share, more than that."
He wonders if it would get better if he could just follow those needs, just reach out and touch when he desires to do so instead of the desperation that comes with fighting those urges. It would be incredibly liberating, the knowledge that he's actually allowed to, that his attentions are not only tolerated but wanted. It's a wondrous thing to him, Dean wanting him back that way - in any way, really. So it's no surprise that every sign of Dean's appreciation for Cas' touch fills the angel with a fuzzy warm sensation, and may it just be this sleep-driven search for comfort. It's one of the reasons he enjoys watching Dean sleep so much. The lack of restriction that comes with unconsciousness, the freedom of showing desires that the hunter keeps so carefully hidden, even denies their existence, in the realm of waking control. Cas revels in those moments when Dean lets his guard down like this (even more so when he does it
He had to tell him. He knew he had to. He had no right to keep it to himself. Cas deserved all the facts before he decided how to proceed with him. It hadn't been fair to hold it back in the first place. Dean had been selfish, too scared to lose Cas if he knew. But he couldn't be selfish anymore, not when Cas looked at him like that, not when Cas had trusted him with this. He'd betrayed that trust long enough.
Dean released a shaky breath, but the tension of worry seemed to seep from his shoulders as his eyes closed momentarily before settling on Cas', open and awed.
And I was always prepared. And it has been really helpful, but I don't- I'm not sure it's enough. I don't want to flinch every time someone touches me unannounced", he tried to explain. "Maybe you could start and...try to touch me from time to time? Just little things when I don't expect it. Brush my arm maybe. Pat my shoulder, I don't know. And don't stop just because it startles me. It might take time, but...I hope I'll get used to it again, if we just keep going."
A smile graced Dean's lips. He pressed it into Cas' skin, his jaw, his cheek, tangled a hand in the hair at the base of his neck to pull their mouths together.
"Hey, while you're out...do you mind getting dinner?", he asks instead, turning a page that's larger than his face.
In a wave of instinctive desire, Cas lightly bit down on Dean's bottom lip, reveling in the groan it pulled from Dean's throat, and the angel just wanted to wind his arms even tighter around the wonderful warm body above him- when that warmth suddenly vanished.
And finally, Dean loosens his hold, buries his fingers in the angel's shirt instead as he leans back with raised eyebrows, a smile he can't hide destroying the impact (not that he would care right now).
So as the day draws to a close, all the books and shelves in the library are dusted off, the furniture polished, and Cas is halfway through a book Dean hopes is not the one the angel has been reading to him last week (he won't admit how much he likes that, nor what the title of that book is, not now), he slumps down on the armchair closest to the one Cas is occupying and rubs his tired eyes.
Cas could just nod, his gaze flitting down to their hands as Dean carefully brought Cas' fingers to brush the delicate skin around his rim. His eyes flickered up to Dean' face when he heard him release a sigh at the contact. He seemed completely relaxed, encouraging Cas to move his fingers in exploratory circles, not pushing him, just guiding.
"Yeah. Yeah, I'm sure." Dean reached for him after he'd withdrawn his fingers and slicked up his length (both too far gone to think about a condom - not that Dean would have wanted anything separating them anyway) and helped Cas to roll over him and position himself between his legs.
"Thank you", he hears again, and he just tightens his hold in return, keeps his eyes closed and breathes.
Cas himself didn't push, but he didn't hold back either, and he was content watching Dean rediscover himself, rediscover them, and whenever he saw that Dean didn't reach out, didn't take his hand, didn't link their fingers together in front of strangers, he knew it would just be all the more special whenever he actually
"You should be watching the sunset, Dean", Cas says (presses out), aware how weak his protest sounds, cursing himself when Dean's teeth scrape his earlobe and his own eyes flutter closed involuntarily.
Dean's TALKING you guys, can you believe it?? We're not there yet, obviously, but I wanted to leave them on a happy note for once... hope you enjoyed that and still found it ic. That's a bit tricky once we're taking our boys out of their comfort zone, but I'm doing my best.
"Alright", he says quietly, nods to himself. "I see." He waits a few more moments for Dean to react, give him something, anything. But there's just a turned back, slowly moving with the in- and outtake of breath. Okay, then. Cas drives a hand over his face. He's tired. He doesn't feel physical exhaustion, but this is an emotional sort of draining. You can't help someone who refuses to let you, no matter how hard you try.
He'd hoped there was something he could say to make it all stop hurting so much. It killed him how Dean's mind could make him feel so worthless. Maybe he'd be better off at last if Cas let his walls finally down. Maybe he'd find some peace, maybe he could make peace with himself if Cas just told him, told him everything he was, told him everything Cas knew him to be, told him everything he was
This cliffhanger was not planned I SWEAR but as I said it kinda got out of hand and I didn't think the conversation leading up to it would be this long and then the characters developed their own will and demanded of me to write whatever is written in this chapter now I don't even remember and yeah. Almost 5k all of a sudden and I had to split it hhhhhhhhhhhh. I'm sorry, I really am. Blame the boys.
He let his hand carefully creep up towards Cas' crotch again, watching his reaction, how his breathing picked up and his hands tightened in the sheets, but he didn't tense again, so Dean dared to lightly press his palm against the bulge in his black boxers, eliciting a groan from the angel. Encouraged by his reaction, he slowly began to stroke up and down, long smooth movements, gradually increasing the pressure, finding out what would draw the sweetest sounds out of Cas.
, Cas hears in the echo of the door that flies shut behind Dean, leaving him with nothing but an empty silence, an empty heart, and the faint glow of grace in the darkness.
Relief floods Dean, much more than would probably be appropriate. Let's not think too closely about the Why here, shall we.
"Hey, you-" He drives a hand through his hair, strokes it back the way Dean knows he does to gather himself. "You don't need my approval, man, but know that you have it either way. I'm not
"I need you", Dean heard himself say, words that formed in his heart, crawled up his throat and tumbled out of his mouth, couldn't even tell what suddenly had him so desperate. "Please, Cas. Make me feel like I belong to you, only you. It's never gonna be anyone but you, Cas. Please, angel...make me yours", Dean said, immediately feeling stupid for saying it. Why had his mouth to spill out such embarrassing chick-flicky shit??
He thinks about going for a drive but he can't. It's painful to look at Cas, to only look at him when he's looking away, how they spent years looking at each other. Only, it's worse now that he knows how it is to meet that blue gaze without restraint and how it is to be given a loving smile in return. It's painful to look at Cas and know his eyes would be hard if he were to meet them. But he still can't look away. Can't leave his presence, even if it's a cold and distant one.
"Okay, good." Dean nodded to himself. "'Cause I want you to heal as fast as possible, but...I'd understand if this is too much."
The room was silent for a while after both had settled down and Dean had switched the lights off, just listening to Cas' quiet breathing, hyperaware of the patch of skin where they were connected, the warmth radiating off of Cas' skin, little squeezes from time to time when he shifted.
even though Dean was his friend and nothing more was no reason for Dean to feel like there was stuff exploding in his mind right now. He'd chosen Dean because he was his friend. Because he needed someone familiar, yet neutral. Someone
Dean watches as Jack's eyes brighten immediately and he follows the invitation, flopping down at the table like the child he actually is, underneath all that. Man, Dean hopes he'll still get to be that child. He's only 3 for fuck's sake! Yeah, he's like..upgraded with God-juice now or something, and with great power comes great responsibility (just shut up), but he's still the same kid he was before,
He pulls another pan out of a drawer, deliberately aiming for the biggest they have, watching Dean's reaction from the corner of his eye when he pours the whole pack of bacon inside at once.
"I mean...yeah." Dean blushed at the admission, shy and beautiful. His gaze fell on Cas' trembling hand, a small smile on his lips.
"Can we just...stay like this for a bit?", the angel asked, painting a smile on Dean's face as he stroked a reassuring hand down Cas' back.
"But...why?", Cas heard himself say, a perfectly valid question as far as he was concerned, but Dean just lifted a disbelieving eyebrow at him.
strength. Add that to his list of unexplored kinks, Dean thinks as the angel pins him down, blue eyes raking over his body.
"Nono." Cas gave him a tentative smile. "Don't apologize. I...I feel honoured that you would choose me for this, Dean."
Rage made its way into his body, set it on fire, cell after cell, until he was burning up and breaking apart. It made his blood boil, fuelled his energy and made it surge through his limbs.
touch no less, let alone something like this. But he wouldn't complain. It was so much more than he'd thought possible, so much more than he would've dared ask for, and it gave him hope. Perhaps...
He's probably lying on his side too, or on his back, head turned to face Dean. He can just imagine it, the soft look in those blue eyes that are resting on him now, have almost constantly been resting on him for the last couple of weeks.
Dean let a soothing hand comb through Cas' unruly hair, instinctively pressed a kiss to his temple. He took the little whimper it earned him as consent, peppering light brushes of lips all over Cas' face, his hair, his cheeks - desperately wanted to kiss his lips again, but they hadn't talked about that yet, he didn't have permission to just go for it, especially not in a moment when Cas was as vulnerable and fragile as right now. Permission once didn't mean permission forever, and he'd never presume, he'd never take what wasn't granted, so he restrained, like so many times before, just concentrated on the way Cas melted beneath the light presses of his lips to his hairline, how he relaxed with a sigh.
, Dean. I'm sick of being controlled by those lies Heaven tried to impose on me. That's not how I want to experience love, that's not how I experience my love for you. And I can't keep acting as if I don't love you. Because I do. I know there are parts that you believe are... too dark and...shameful. But you forget that I've seen you at your worst, Dean, I've seen your soul, and even after all those years in Hell, it still shone brighter than any other I'd ever witnessed. Those things you're ashamed of? Those have been
Dean kept sinking into him, occupying space Cas never even knew he wanted to give, pausing once he bottomed out, their kiss breaking, Dean's heavy pants ghosting over Cas' face like a soft caress.
"Cas." Dean bit his lip, reaching to grab Cas' hips and stop him from moving, "Hey, hold on. Slow down there."
Sam was the relentless rock to Dean's overpowering waves, steady and comforting, keeping him on his feet until the flood slowly retreated, the hands that had been placed on his back slowly gripping his shoulders to guide him backwards. For a second Dean felt the urge to give his still unsteady legs some rest, sit down on a chair or the bed perhaps, but a glance around the room reminded him that all the furniture had fallen victim to his earlier surge of rage. So he simply wiped his embarrassingly damp cheeks, willing his legs to obey and hold him up, finally gathering the courage to meet his brother's eyes again. His expression was unreadable, and Dean was just expecting him to comment on the uncharacteristic meltdown he'd just witnessed, a sarcastic retort about chick-flick moment ready on his tongue-
, he breathed because what else would he be saying but his name, and he was there, right there, leaning down to kiss the breath and the name right out of Cas' mouth.
He clenches his hands to fists by his sides and fixes his eyes on the floor. This is awful. He should be happy that they're happy, and he is. He really is. But...y'know.
They were still hunting, he still worried about Dean, Dean worried about him, and Cas could almost have gotten fed up with the way he was fussing over him now that he could just do so, but it was simply too adorable to behold to actually consider making him stop. There would always be new monsters around, new apocalypses to prevent, Cas knew, and perhaps they wouldn't get out of the life for a long time to come, but perhaps they would eventually. Cas dearly hoped so. He could just picture it, a nice country house in the middle of nowhere, white picket fence and all the apple-piey things Dean always denied he wanted, and him and Dean, cooking together, reading to each other, going for walks as the sun set, falling asleep in each other's arms, in their own bed, in their own home.
"We're a couple of dumbasses", Dean says, the grin on his face mixing with the regret he feels about wasting so much time. When he thinks about how long he could have had this if he just hadn't been such a coward, how long he denied himself, how long he denied them
"Okay", he says, making a soothing gesture with his hands, "look. Jack came to me, okay? He wanted to know if everything's alright between you and Dean."
"The wings. The grace. All that." Cas shrugged his shoulders. "I know you said you liked them but...they're just another reminder of how different we are."
"Cas!" He doesn't like the way his voice gets louder, pitched higher. He doesn't like the way his chest contracts, the way he finds it increasingly harder to breathe with every empty room he comes across. He doesn't like the feeling of panic he can't seem to swallow, no matter how much he tries.
The angel seemed relaxed, pressing back into Dean -his hands, his chest, his mouth- seeking more, so Dean dared to slowly trail a hand up, settle on his hip, fingers skipping out to cup the swell of his cheek. He immediately noticed the slight hitch in Cas' breath, a second of pause in their kiss, but Cas made no move to draw back or stop him. Encouraged but careful, Dean left his hand there, kept his touches light, stroking the skin, squeezing a little.
Dean shook his head, unable to suppress his own smile though, lightly bumping Cas' shoulder with his in a failed attempt to seem nonchalant.
"Slept at a motel. He...he came into my dream, Cas. He used- He used you." He couldn't stop his voice from cracking at that, didn't have the strength to try and hide how lost he sounded, how pleading. "I thought it was
"Could you-" The craving inside him forms words before he's even finished the thought. He blushes slightly, grateful that Cas' head is still tucked under his chin so he won't see. "Maybe hold me while you do it?", Dean presses out in a rush, biting his lip when Cas lifts himself up on one elbow, smiling softly.
"Not the point I'm tryin' to make here, Cas." He backs off a little, creates his sacred personal space so he can continue breathing.
"I mean...sure." Dean shrugged, hoped it came across as the lighthearted, dismissive gesture it was supposed to look like. No need to show Cas how much of a deal it actually
Dean's brow furrowed in worry, a hand coming up to touch his shoulder, stroke soothingly down his arm. Cas released a slow breath, nodded.
Anyway, I just hope you're still interested to see the end of this fic even after the long time, I'm certainly so grateful for every single one of you amazing people who've been sticking with me til the end! You're all awesome!! Hope you enjoy this:)
He was still getting used to eating at all, and the strange mixture of taste and the molecular structure on his tongue that was created by his slowly recharging grace didn't leave him particularly eager to consummate food, but the empty feeling in his stomach demanded attention.
"You've not been married?", Jack goes on, eyes squinted in confusion. "This whole time? Since my birth?"
"Of course, sweetheart." He nodded, not even aware of the pet name that slipped his lips. "If you feel up to it."
So he nodded, didn't even question how Cas managed to turn them over until Dean lay on his back without separating them, looking up at Cas with desperate, pleading eyes.
Cas smiles. He smiles like he knows Dean is lost. He smiles like he's waited for this. (If Dean only knew what
What does he mean to say? How do you express something you can't even grasp in the world of feeling. How do you put down in words what seems intangible?
Cas lay with Dean tucked into his side, head resting on the arm Cas had slung around his shoulders. They had decided to stay in bed the rest of the day, neither feeling the urge to get up (or the will to separate), just content to stay right where they were, resting their tired limbs and enjoying the comfort of this new kind of unhurried, innocent intimacy.
You know the procedure. Just finished in the middle of the night, no betas available. I should really get a grip on my writing (and sleeping) habits.
Cas is nicer than Sam though, and offers him a hand. Cas is also fucking magic, because somehow they get Dean out of the trunk, and his body doesn’t even protest too much during the entire process.
“I know,” Cas says. And somehow that’s what makes his anger disappear -- completely and at once. Because love is scary and Cas knows and he can say it anyway. Because Cas is fucking brave and so much better than what Dean deserves and he loves him anyway. Because Dean’s actually really fucking grateful that Cas exists and when he stops overthinking the situation it’s actually really nice that Cas loves him. Cas is the best, and if Dean can’t say it then he can at least try, because that’s what Cas deserves. So, he tries.
If there was any kind of wriggle room in the trunk Dean would probably bang his head against the wall. This is just so indescribably, utterly stupid. All because he’s an idiot. All because he can’t man up and just say something, just for once in his life. Because he’s a coward and fucked in the head and just-
Dean wants out so badly, it’s bordering on pathetic. This is why he usually doesn’t stop to think about things too closely. Because one second he’s flying by the seat of his pants and doing a good thing and then he stops, and he thinks, and the next thing you know he’s trapped himself inside Baby’s trunk with no way to shut Cas up. Things were going so great right up to the point where he started thinking them through, and it makes him angry..
Cas’s grin is mischievous, and Dean likes it that way. He grabs Dean by the neck and yanks him forwards the last couple of inches so he’s standing between his legs. Dean half expects Cas to go all the way and just crush his lips to his, finds that he wants Cas to go all the way and just kiss him, and is sorely disappointed when Cas only drapes his other arm loosely around his neck too. The benefits of Cas kissing him would be that Dean wouldn’t have to think about how close they’re standing right now, that his hands kind of casually landed against Cas’s thighs on their own, and the fact that they’re in the parking lot of a pizza restaurant and about the cars filled with people passing them and passing them and passing them. He wouldn’t have to face that fact that, honestly, Cas and his stupid feelings were only half the reason he crawled into that trunk in the first place, because this entire goddamn situation is scary as hell.
Dean swallowed again, all the Cas had said that night running through his head at once, creating chaos. Until the chorus of
He wants to curl around Cas and hold him close and never let him go so that he can keep hearing that sound forever. “I don't think that's going to work,” Cas says. “I know ASL and it's just going to make me and Eileen gossip more. I would also prefer not to die of dehydration, that sounds uncomfortable."
as if Cas dropped his hand to the top of the lid, and Dean wants to press his hand against where he thinks Cas’s is. Maybe he does that. There’s no one to see, so who cares. Certainly not him. He’s fought God himself for the ability to do whatever the fuck he wants, and if this is what he wants, why shouldn’t he do it? He’s got free fucking will.
. Since he can’t, he does the next best thing and simply hugs Cas again. Cas’s arms tighten around his shoulders almost automatically, holding him just as tight as Dean wants to hold him. He should be panicking about doing this in public too, but all he wants right now is to never stop. Good luck trying to take Cas away from him again, world. Dean’s
“That’s scary,” he says, finally. Because it is. Cas loves him and that’s the scariest thing he’s ever had to face in his life.
On the street, a car honks. Probably not even at them, his brain supplies a moment too late, right after a shot of adrenaline spikes through im. His heart is running a marathon, threatening to fly right out of his chest any second, and it has nothing to do with Cas. He turns towards the noise and finds nothing there.
Cas’s laugh sounds teary, and it makes Dean only want to get out of here and just- he doesn’t think he’s ever wanted to hold someone in his arms as badly as he does now. He wants to crawl
He didn’t turn around immediately, letting the relief wash over him. Even seeing Chuck die, knowing they were finally free hadn’t had this effect on him. Was this what peace and quiet were supposed to feel like?
It’s hard. Cas is warm underneath his hands, and Cas’s fingers dragging against his scalp is a distracting sensation. But it’s still hard.
“I fucking went to get you from the Empty, that’s how much I don’t want that, Cas. I- Cas, I- I couldn’t bear it if you died. Couldn’t bear it
kick me out. And after my confession and my now, unfortunate, powerlessness, I didn’t see why you wouldn’t do so again. I was admittedly surprised that you refused to. But you also seemed to refuse to talk about anything that had happened, so I didn’t really know what to think.”
His back, mostly healed but still a pain in the ass, already protested as he got up. He threw the stick anyway, hissing in pain and instinctively pressing a hand to the offending spot as Miracle bounded away, blissfully unaware of such human problems as a recent stab wound. Falling back against the railing of the bridge, he watched as the dog lost sight of his stick, grabbed another one, and then went chasing after some squirrel, trying to bark around the stick.
And Dean really is in deep, big capital L gay feelings, because he’s just crawled out of that trunk in front of his brother
Cas smiled in answer before leaning in again for a short kiss. Then he pulled him closer, wrapping his arms around Dean’s shoulders this time, and rested his head on Dean’s shoulder.
As Sam disappears in the distance, Cas shuts the trunk, then sits back down on it. Dean must have given him a confused look, because he says, “It’s a precaution.”
he think was going to happen? That they would both forget? As if that confession didn’t haunt his every waking moment that Cas was gone? If he hadn’t wanted to confront this, he should have left Cas in the Empty, but that’s, as established, not an option. So much for free will. This is why Dean normally doesn’t talk about his feelings.
Cas doesn’t answer that, and Dean regrets it immediately. He doesn’t hope Cas dies. Cas dying is the last thing he wants, the fucking opposite of what he wants. He’s like this to Cas always and it makes him a really bad fucking person, because there’s boundaries you don’t cross, and they’re not joking anymore right now. He’s wrong. Taking a deep breath, he forces himself to say: “I’m sorry, I didn’t mean that. I don’t- I don’t want that. Not ever.”
Cas is quiet, apparently taken aback by his admission. Dean rather enjoys that, so he plows on. “I got my hand pressed against the lid right now, where I’m pretending your hand is. So it’s like we’re holding hands, ‘cept we’re not. But I, uh, I do wanna do that for real with you. Once I’m out of here. And I wanna kiss you again. And, uh, hug you. I wanna kiss your temple. And your forehead. And your hair. And just like everything, really. You look really kissable. In like a general sense. Is that a weird thing to say?”
“Dean,” Cas whispers. He leans his forehead against Dean’s and his thumbs start running along the lines of his jaw. And Dean’s world narrows down to Cas and just Cas.
Dean wants to make a quib whether he really needs clarification for that, but bites his tongue. Cas deserves the entire gravity of the situation. “Yeah.”
It’s only the sound of another car pulling into parking lot that finally makes him take a step back. He runs his hand down Cas’s arm, letting his touch linger before tugging at Cas’s hand to pull him off the car. Cas doesn’t budge.
There’s silence outside of the car, and he prays that Cas doesn’t actually go through with his threat. The parking lot stays quiet.
He paused, letting the finality of that decision, now that he had told someone else, settle in. Relishing, briefly, in how good it felt. “I haven’t told Sam yet. I don’t even know what I’m gonna do next. Probably stay in the Bunker for now, and then-“ He paused again. “I don’t know. Open a bar, maybe.” He took another step towards Cas. “But I know that I want you to be there for that. I want you to be there with me.” He grabbed Cas’s hands, holding them between the two of them. It sent a thrill through him, because it felt like, although he was just holding Cas’s hands, he was baring his entire heart to him now. It was a thrill he never wanted to stop. “And I know that you’re busy with heaven right now, just- promise me that you’ll come back now and then. And that you’ll stay once you’re done.”
“Okay. This is not gonna be pretty then, alright?” Sam said, gripping his shoulders tightly. It took some of the weight off his injured back, but the movement made the pain flare up. Sam counted down before pulling him forward, off of whatever it was that had impaled him, but nothing could have prepared Dean for the flames of pain shooting up his spine. He hissed and groaned as he stumbled forward. Sam caught him, immediately pressing his bunched-up jacket to the wound.
“Once I’m out of here I’m making sure you never get to say a word ever again in your life,” Dean threatens him.
Dean shrugged. “Yeah, like a roadhouse with an apartment in the back, selling cheap beers and mediocre burgers. And maybe I help out the occasional hunter that stops by, like Bobby did for us. But I’m never killing another monster.”
will let you live this down,” Cas says. There’s humor in his voice, and honestly? Dean will take the teasing he will get for this if Cas can get him out of here. He’ll take it gladly. He’ll even admit he deserves it.
“I keep thinking about what you said before the Empty took you, you know,” Dean said, barging ahead. “I thought when we defeated Chuck, you’d show up with everyone else, but then you didn’t, and I’ve been- I’ve been thinking about what I would want to say to you when you finally came back every day, Cas. And I keep thinking about how I should have said it then already and- “
you did. I-” This is too fucking hard. It’s just three words, three syllables, nothing big, and it would already make up for so much fucked up shit he’s told Cas over the years. So why can’t he say it? “I couldn’t fucking sleep because I couldn’t stop thinking about you dying. Thinking about
“I don’t know why Sam or Jack or Eileen would ask you this,” Cas says, and god Dean’s so angry at whoever taught him sarcasm right now. He’s being a little shit and Dean’s just- Dean’s fucking- this just isn’t fair. It was probably Dean himself who taught him, which just- Good job, Winchester. “But there’s pizzas getting cold on the backseat and our family is waiting for said pizzas at home, while you decided to climb in and lock yourself into Baby’s trunk.”
he doesn’t want that to happen now. Words he can’t fucking say, because he’s Dean Winchester and he doesn’t fucking say those things. Because it’s only a matter of time until he loses Cas again, and then
“No,” Sam said, shifting him in his arms and turning his face with his free hand, so he had to look him in the face. “You’re not going to die. Not today, not like this. We’ll fix this, okay?”
have an answer to that. It’s just not one he can look at directly without burning his eyes out. It’s especially not one he can just tell Cas.
Miracle wagged his tail excitedly as he stared up at him with his perfectly adorable puppy dog eyes that Dean knew he was never, ever going to say ‘no’ to.
Dean is fine. He’s splendid, even. Totally a-okay, not in need of help in any way, shape or form, just absolutely peachy. Really, he’s doing good.
It makes him wish he wasn’t locked in Baby’s trunk right now, so he could actually put his hand on Cas’s. Palm to palm, maybe even entwine their fingers. He thinks that’s called holding hands, not that Dean has ever done that much before all of this. But, well. Capital L gay feelings and all. He can’t even think about it without wanting to cry, and that? It’s a fucking bitch of an unsatisfactory situation, is what it is.
“Closer,” Cas says when Dean stops just close enough that he could easily put his hands on Cas’s knees. He kind of wants to. Instead he takes another half step forward.
He barely managed to grind out the truth between his teeth, too scared that if he opened his mouth he’d just start howling in pain. “Something’s got me, Sammy.”
But Cas is merciless. “I thought, at first, that you didn’t want me to stick around. I’m human now, and the last time I was you
Dean’s still mad about that. Cas got better, obviously, and Dean’s glad about that. Dean’s worked his ass off to make sure he did, after all. Risked his life wading into the personification of a bad acid trip of nothingness to pull Cas out of Angel Purgatory and all that. But he’s still mad. Because Cas died and Dean didn’t, and then they defeated God and he still didn’t die and that meant he had to face a world without Cas in it. And that’s just not something that he wants to happen. But because Cas just couldn’t shut up when Dean asked him to, he’s got the exact words for
Dean stayed quiet for a moment, surveying the run-down barn while he waited for his lungs to start working again despite the pain. Their fight had knocked over old crates and busted planks of wood. Blood splatters and vampire ashes covered every visible surface. It seemed almost funny that this was how he was going to go out. He’d always thought he was destined to die guns blazing, but now that he was, this time for good, he wanted anything but this. “Sammy-“ he started.
He took a step towards Cas reflexively and shook his head. “No. That’s not-“ The words already failed him, and Cas didn’t seem to realize what he meant, making no move towards him. He looked around the woods surrounding them, trying in vain to figure out how to adapt what he had meant to say to this situation. It all seemed so inadequate now. More than he would ever admit to anyone, and yet not enough by far.
Dean grumbled something that he hoped Sam would take for ‘no’. He probably could move; he was pretty sure he still felt his legs – the pain was just too much. And it would only multiply if he didn’t hold still.
“That’s the last one,” Sam said, getting back on his feet. Dean stiffened, trying in vain to breathe around the pain, and Sam’s eyebrows puckered. “Dean?”
His happiness, although long lived, only lasted so long. Something pricked his calf, and he let go of Cas to find the dog looking at the two of them expectantly, tail wagging. Miracle had returned from his squirrel hunt and was now proudly presenting them with another stick he had found.
Dean wanted to reply that he was and that it didn’t matter. That Sam was wrong. But he stayed silent as Sam shifted him again, lifting him up so he could carry him to the Impala. He stayed silent too, as Sam muttered “Just hold on, okay? Stay with me.” And he stayed silent as the Impala rumbled to life, jostling him in his seat as Sam reversed back onto the street. And he tried to do as his brother said.
“Would it hurt you to just examine and then acknowledge your feelings once? Just one time. For my sake?”
it?” he asked as he crouched down to take the stick Miracle had found while frolicking through the nearby clearing. “Alright.”
He ran his hands over the railing and listened to the creek burble. And the world felt so incredibly empty that he couldn’t help but speak.
He took a deep breath and then just went with the first thing he needed Cas to know, hoping he would get to the right place eventually. “When I was dying, I looked around and I thought: Not like this. I don’t wanna die today. Not here. Not like this. And then I woke up in the hospital, and I realized I don’t have to. No one’s gonna force me to go hunting ever again, and so I won’t. I’m gonna retire.”
“Closer,” Cas says again, apparently still not satisfied with where Dean’s standing. Dean shuffles a bit on the step, not really sure he can get closer. His knees are touching Cas’s.
Cas responded in an instant, lightly cupping Dean’s jaw with one hand and wrapping the other arm around his back, pulling him closer. Dean went willingly-
He just wanted to get the pizzas for his family, and asked Jack to come because he wanted to spend time with his damn kid. Baby steps of showing affection. He knows he’s bad at that and he wants to do better because the kid deserves it. His whole family does. And then Jack, the traitor, said no, and
It was like this with the first kiss too, Dean putting the pizzas on the backseat and then turning around to find Cas just so stupidly close, and himself just so stupidly happy that Cas was here, and then he’d just kissed him.
Cas and he should be really embarrassed about everything, but all he wants is to get closer to Cas. So he does.
He doesn’t say that because he wants to get out though. It’s just to prove that he’s fully in control of this situation. Dean’s very comfortable where he is. It was his choice to get in here in the first place, so this is all exactly what’s supposed to happen.
“You cannot, under any circumstances, let Sam know about this,” Dean says, desperately wracking his brain to come up with a different solution. “He’ll never let me live this down.”
He fumbles for the lock and comes up empty. Pushing against the top also doesn’t do the job. “No,” he admits. “But there’s a lever by the driver's seat that will let you unlock it.”
Dean laughs with relief. They’re both quiet again, not-holding hands through the top of the trunk and just enjoying each other’s company. Cars drive by or onto the parking lot, filling the silence while they wait for Sam. When the car moves again, the trunk whipping upward as Cas slides off it, Dean knows he’s here.
“Maybe Sam has a point,” Cas says, completely ignoring Dean’s deflection. “He is the smarter one of the two of you when it comes to these things.”
"We can't change the past." His angel's mouth twitched. "But do not worry about the future, my love. You make me very happy, Dean", Cas said, as if he knew it was just what Dean needed to hear.
"Okay, okay." Dean looked to the door, shuffling to his feet. "I'm gonna get Sam. He can take a look and-"
He closed the rest of the space, pressing their lips together in a deep kiss, only breaking away once his need for air demanded it.
evenings. When it was just too much, that feeling inside him, that nagging, longing, craving of something (someone) he didn't dare put a name to. It had been there for a very long time now, only getting stronger over the years the more Dean tried to push it down. And try to push it down, he
They sit in silence for a moment, listen to the wind in the trees, the birds and the dog barking occasionally. Dean has shifted in his seat, is leaned against the back now, right next to Cas, yet so far away.
He's writhing in his own skin, torn in his anger. He's angry with himself, because he always is, he knows how to do that, and it's easier than any of the other options swirling in his head, like guilt and shame and
Sam had come by some time ago to offer help, which Cas gratefully declined, determined to put all this together on his own. Which, in retrospect, might have been a highly unwise decision, but now it's too late to dwell on his folly. It's been a couple of hours since then, actually, but Cas has sort of lost track of time, as well as that initial sense of resolution. He's been a little busy searching around for kitchen supplies he doesn't know where to find, reading the instructions of a recipe he looked up on the internet but doesn't really know how to follow, and generally standing (or running) around without much of a plan.
Dean raised his eyes from his own book, and without further ado, he reached to place it on the nightstand.
Cas swallows, looks at him for a long time, but then he nods and wordlessly slides into bed and under the covers, and Dean silently releases the breath he's been holding. He lies on his back, staring at the ceiling, nearly crushed under the relief crashing over him when he feels the mattress dip down in that way that has become so familiar and indispensable to him.
He couldn't look away from his own hand, from the way it was cupping Cas' face, a hand that had been covered in the blood of countless people, a hand that had been raised to hurt and kill, a hand that Cas had miraculously chosen to trust.
"I appreciate you trying, but...you don't have to pretend, Dean." Cas averted his eyes, let them settle on his own hand where it was placed on the mattress. "How could you not? They're a reminder. Of...him. Of what happened. Of what you had to see." There was no accusation there, just plain, sad acceptance.
The man sat down next to him, placed his elbow on the counter. He was good looking, Cas supposed. Probably in his mid to late thirties, short brown hair to go with the eyes, maybe a bit taller than Dean, with laughter-lines in the corner of his eyes and a kind line to his mouth when he smiled.
Cas closed his eyes for a moment, gathering courage, his hand stroking down down down until it stopped just short of its destination, held in the suspense.
"What?", he asks, grinning despite having no idea what happened. He just loves hearing her laugh. He hears it far too rarely of late.
Cas takes his time, lets Dean a few moments to adjust to each new intrusion, the slight burn that comes with being stretched. But it's a pleasant pain, smoothed over by the powers of angel grace until it's reduced to a slight sting that wakes anticipation for what is about to come after. By the time Dean can easily take three fingers inside him, he's breathing hard and writhing against Cas' hand, his own fingers twisted in the angel's hair or the sheets. He groans when Cas hits that spot again that sends a jolt of hot pleasure through his body, and he pulls the angel into a kiss, desperate for more, more closeness, more connection, more
Dean swallowed, tried to get rid of the sudden lump in his throat, prayed Cas couldn't hear the tears in his voice. He quickly wiped his eyes with the back of his hand, making sure the movement wasn't visible from Cas' angle (and that he didn't get oil on his face).
There will be days when Dean takes Cas to the garden centre and learns about types of soil and watering and solanums, and he'll make sure to especially inquire which flowers attract the most insects so they have bees around.
He's beautiful, Cas thinks not for the first time. In fact, he's thought it so many times and on so many different occasions that he lost count. Because Dean is always beautiful. He's beautiful when he laughs and beautiful when he hunts and beautiful when he fights and beautiful when he saves the world. He's beautiful in joy and in anger, in sadness and determination, in fear and exhaustion. He's beautiful every minute of every day, when he smiles just as much as in the depths of despair. Even when death had been knocking at the door, he'd still been beautiful.
Two weeks of hour-long conversations. Two weeks of not enough sleep. Two weeks of sitting in a chair and sleeping on a mattress on the floor and getting up only for food and showers. Two weeks of hoping and worrying and longing.
No. They aren't twelve for heaven's sake. He knows he just uses the age bullshit as an excuse, it shouldn't be an issue, lots of people go by it. But it doesn't feel right when he tries to wrap his tongue around it, the idea of introducing Cas as his boyfriend making him cringe.
, and Dean can't wait to hear all these spoken in the angel's warm voice, but they'll have time for all that later, so he lets his own gaze say as much.
"No." Cas shook his head, a strand of messy black hair falling into his forehead that had no business making Dean's silly heart skip a beat. "I want this. I'm fine." Cas raised a questioning eyebrow. "Are you?"
He bit his lip to hold back a groan of his own as Dean flicked his thumb over his tip on the upstroke, smoothing the way down with his own precome, his hips bucking up into his hand.
"I know that's not...like the other things we- it's more intimate, a different kind of intimate, and I'd understand if you didn't-"
And then, finally, after years and years, when their children's children have grown up, and Dean and Cas have watched it all, side by side, a day will come when they know. They won't be sure how, maybe it's something Jack arranged so they have time to say a temporary goodbye to their friends and family. And that's what they will do, returning to their bedroom after a day spent with all the people they love.
So yeah, lyrics from All Of Me by John Legend, obvs. Didn't wanna put it in the notes at the beginning bc spoilers xD Also yeah we're just gonna assume Cas can sing.
When Dean steps out into the warm air, the sun shining down on the green grass, a light breeze moving the trees, he has to take hold of Sam's arm for a second. This is real, this is happening, everything seems to be fucking perfect, which should be a sign that it's in fact not real, because this is not the reality he's used to, and yet it is. It's perfect, and it's real, and it's
"Dean, I- I'm sorry, I can't..." He stumbled over his own words, ringing for breath. "I- I'm sorry, I'm
"Sit." Dean pats down on what he's come to think of as Cas' side of the bed, and that thought alone is enough to make a new wave of pain rush through him at the prospect that Cas might refuse to occupy it, might not know that it's his to own, that it's gonna be bereft of all its purpose and meaning if he's not there to keep it warm.
Some day along the way will have Dean standing in front of the bedroom mirror, smiling when he sees grey in his hair, because he simply can't believe he actually made it this far, and Cas will come up to him, hugging him from behind with his chin on Dean's shoulder and painted with some grey of his own. And he'll point out with a smile that most people wouldn't rejoice about this, but what could bear more truth than Dean replying that they certainly aren't most people.
"Look at my eyes now", Dean repeated, nodded encouragingly when their gazes met. "What do they look like now?"
His life sucks tremendously. And that's saying something, considering they'd been faced with the literal Endtimes. More than once. There's no possibility of imminent death lurking now, but he almost wishes there was. Easier to shut out your personal life when you got your survival to focus on.
When Dean dares to open his eyes, the first thing that greets him is an all-encompassing silence. The first glance tells him that they are indeed still in the dungeon of the bunker. His first instinct is to turn around and see, make
"It's gonna bruise", Dean explained, quiet, small. "I'm sorry, I didn't think. I'm sure you don't wanna see any marks on you, not after..."
"Cas, just answer the damn question", he breaks the angel off, closing his eyes, pressing his teeth together.
(He always tried to calm himself, tried to close his eyes and think of something else - but all he could see was blue.)
"Sam found it", he mumbled, didn't dare look up. "Some sort of sigil, he thinks. On your back. It's..."
"I'm fine, Dean", Cas assured. "It's...unfamiliar. Maybe a little uncomfortable but...not unwelcome. Not even unpleasant, really. Just give me a moment to adjust."
"No." Dean shakes his head. "I'm sure. Fuck, I've been sure for so long. Please, I..." He presses his lips together, gaze open and vulnerable. "I want it to be you."
"Dean." Cas reached out and took Dean's hand, entwining their fingers, making sure he captured Dean's undivided attention. "I told you, it wasn't your fault. You've been used too. You're allowed to be hurting. Just because you're helping me heal doesn't mean you need to be fine."
"Dean", Cas said, and just the way he said his name made Dean feel like the air had been sucked out of the room. "Do you still not understand? I already
"I don't want to make you uncomfortable. And not just because of-" Cas swallowed. "-what happened. I know this would be easier for you if I inhabited a female vessel-"
It's the most adorable thing Dean has ever seen, this stained angel, illuminated by candlelight, surrounded by the evidence of his endeavour to make a romantic dinner, knowing full well that he has never cooked anything to speak of, yet glowing proudly with the effort he puts into everything he sets his heart on.
"You're the love of my life, Dean Winchester", that smiling mouth says, and it sounds so easy, falling from those lips. "And my life has been very, very long. I would give up anything for you, and you know that, but...this, this is something you can give to me." And fuck, there are tears glistening in Cas' eyes now, and Dean is almost sure there are some in his own eyes as well, even though he can't be sure, focused as he is on the angel and his voice that seems to grow more desperate by the second. "Let me have this, Dean", he asks, pleads. "Please. I have thought about it and I know what I want. I don't need your permission, but I would hate to have to do this without your consent, so please,
He didn't want to look up, but the desperation driving Cas' hurried words made it impossible not to.
The sound of his panting is loud in the silence of his room, the wall cool against his heated skin. He doesn't know how long he stands there like this, lets the anger flow out of him like the liquor he'd spilt, leaving him with nothing but emptiness.
Dean exhaled into his mouth, his shoulders releasing some of their tension, and when Cas broke their lips' connection, Dean smiled back at him.
"You're alright." Dean kissed the corner of his mouth, his lips, just stayed there, waiting for Cas to tell him to proceed, always waiting for Cas to be ready. "So good. You're so perfect, Cas. Take your time."
This is still unbetaed, sorry if I have typos left, I can't proofread on a screen if my life depends on it.
"Breathe, it's just me." Dean kept his touches light, only applying more pressure once Cas nodded at him to go on, concentrating on deep, calm breaths.
Before Dean can move to go hug her as well (not that he's absolutely fucking craving a hug right now or anything, that'd be ridiculous) she turns, directing her beaming smile and kind eyes to the angel she's spotted in the corner.
So Dean had forced his shame into a cage and locked it to the best of his ability. And it worked better than he'd thought it would, once he understood that he wasn't just doing it for himself, because he was tired of the bitter taste of self-hatred - he also had to do it for Cas.
"You would?" Dean swallows, watching Cas get up from the bed as well, watches the muscles play under his skin when he walks over.
He watches Dean play with Miracle, the way the hunter jumps around, squats down with his hands on his knees, laughs at the dog barking and running around, chasing his tail. It's the most carefree Cas has seen Dean in a long time, maybe ever, and he feels his heart flutter. He gets to witness a side he always knew to be there underneath all that responsibility and worry burdening Dean, a side he'd only ever caught glimpses of.
Cas has figured that out a long time ago. And not only stupidities like sacrificing your own life for the ones you love, though his family has quite a tendency to do just that. It's just as much in the little things.
Now, I hope this will bring the fic to a satisfying (pun not intended - or is it) conclusion before we bring it to a close soon. I am terribly sorry this took so long, at least it is indeed the longest chapter we've had in this entire fic. 5.8k (and two paintings) of smut ahead, obviously, as it is my custom, very fluffy fluffy wordy smut. And lots of emotional emotions. They're so SOFT yall ahdgasdadafg.
How pathetic. He should be ashamed of himself. (He is.) Not only that he's too much of a coward himself to admit to what he wants and to fucking go and ask for it, dammit, he can't even watch others have it and not be a jealous ass about it.
The sun feels nice on his skin when he steps outside and he watches with a smile how Miracle excitedly sniffs around in the grass. It reminds him of the day he'd gone out on the walk with Dean, the warm air moving the trees above them, the smell of earth, growth and life filling their noses. He can see the picture of Dean before his inner eye, smiling and peaceful.
The words sent a hot surge of pain and guilt through Dean's body, but he drowned it out. It didn't matter. There was nothing to do about it now. All that mattered was the present. He couldn't change where they came from, but he could choose where they went from there.
When you're falling in a forest and there's nobody around, do you ever really crash or even make a sound? All that energy he'd put into isolating himself. And what for? Putting himself in a position where no one can see, no one can hear, no one can help? How is he supposed to know if they would? How is he ever gonna know if someone would take interest if he just let them? How is he gonna know if he wouldn't have to be alone if he allowed others in?
That was all the permission Cas needed. His tongue licked a broad stripe where his lips had lingered, and Dean's back arched off the mattress, seeking more.
At least Cas hadn't led him on further. It was hard, controlling his vessel's -no, his body's- reactions to Dean's touch, he remembered how he had to ball his hands into fists to keep them from reaching out and winding around Dean, twitching at his sides with the impossible need to pull Dean in, hold him close and never let go. He had wanted to move his lips in sync to Dean's, explore the way they'd give beneath his when he pressed closer, flick out his tongue and get a taste...
"Ah, screw that, come on." Dean pats the other side of his bed in a surge of recklessness he hadn't known he had in him. "But lose the coat, dude. And please, for the love of God, don't ever put it over PJs again." He has just now realised what Cas is wearing. He's ridiculous and Dean loves him so much he doesn't know what to do with himself. The coat is hanging over a pair of baggy cotton pyjamas, sky-blue with a bee print. Dean had gotten those for him. It had been a Christmas present.
"You...ah. You comin' too?", he says cautiously, deliberately keeping his back to Cas who he knows is splayed out on the bed -his bed, no, their bed- in the most Cas way (read: obliviously sexy way) possible.
"Promise." He can't stop himself. He's lost him too many times. Too late, he registers what he's actually asking here, realizes what he's demanding.
The worried, questioning look in those blue eyes brought Dean back to himself, his eyes ripping away from the magnificent feathers to find the angel's.
"It's okay", he said, but if more to Dean or himself, the hunter didn't know. Still, Cas seemed sure.
The admission leaves Dean more speechless than he anticipated when he asked, but that's just what Cas does. Whatever he expects, the angel always manages to surprise him with something more, larger,
"For you?" Dean tried to sound nonchalant, probably failed spectacularly. "'Cause, Cas. You're more important", he added then, not sure where it had come from. It was true, of course. It was just another one of those things he wouldn't have said. Usually.
His head snaps up in sync with the dog's, eyebrows raised in surprise. It would look funny if she didn't know about the thoughts he'd most certainly been ripped out of by her entering.
He kisses Dean again, deep and unhurried, before placing an arm on the backrest behind him, his fingers grazing the hunter's shoulder as they look out over the glittering water that reflects the colours of a sky painted in yellows and pinks.
"Is that why you usually engage in that sort of relation, Dean?", he asked back, saw the second something closed off behind Dean's previously probing eyes.
"Dean." There's the hint of a question in Cas' hesitant voice, and no, he absolutely fucking will not let Cas see the state he's in. He hears the rustling of fabric as Cas moves on his chair, moves
"Shhhh." Dean swallowed to make his voice work. "I get it. It's okay, Cas. You're alright." He buried his nails in the edge of the mattress to keep himself from reaching out again. "What about I stay on here, huh? No touching."
Hello my dears!! This was rather fast, but I didn't think anyone would mind xD Not sure how happy I am with this one overall, but sometimes we just need to get a few chapters out just to get to the part of the plot that we wanna reach...
The road is his friend and slipping into the Impala's driver seat feels like coming home. At least that's what it had been like, in the past. (But he has a different home now, a home not made of a place, but people, brothers and friends and angels and-
"Dean." He's barely doing anything, Cas is well aware of that, and yet this is more than mildly distracting. "What are you doing?"
There's a revealing mixture of emotions in Dean's eyes, fear infused with excitement, amazement, awe. It's the exact mirror of what Cas can feel brewing inside his own chest and it calms him to know that he isn't alone in this. It makes him think of how
Dean wants to remember the sound of his voice like that the way he remembers everything in his dream.
Speaking of it, with this chapter we cross the 80k line which makes this officially the longest fic I've ever written, wahoo to me and to all of you who keep me motivated! Seriously, I couldn't have done it without all of you, you're so awesome.
, Dean, bound in ways neither of us can even begin to comprehend. I didn't understand it before, but I think I do now." The smile widens, and suddenly there are hints of tears sparkling in the blue, and Dean is spellbound. "It was
Eileen gives him a thumbs up and smiles a smile Sam tries to engrave in his memory until the next evening. He smiles back because it's impossible not to.
He recoiled into himself, drew his knees up to his chest, buried his hands in his hair and tugged too harshly at the strands as if the physical pain could take away from the one inside his chest. The splinters that littered his hands were driven deeper into his skin when he clenched them tightly, the blood coating his fingers mixed with the tears on his cheeks, smearing all over his face and dyeing his hair.
"Here, let me." Cas reaches for him instantly, pleased when Dean meets him half-way, as if giving himself over to Cas' care. At least that's what Cas allows himself to believe for a second. He takes Dean's chafed hand in one of his and places the other on top, careful not to touch the raw patches. The light of his healing can be seen shining through their fingers and maybe Cas holds on just a moment longer than would have been necessary before he releases Dean's hand.
"You won't do anything to drive me away, Dean", Cas said, and fuck, of course his angel knew that too, knew exactly what Dean was so terribly afraid of.
Dean had to remind himself this wasn't the first time he'd seen Cas shirtless, there had been multiple occasions while Cas had been human and needed stitching up after a hunt, but this? The way he looked at Dean while he shrugged out of his clothes, the
Cas forces his eyes away from the shards of glass on the floor and fixes them on Dean instead, stares at him for a moment, intense and motionless. Dean swallows as he watches Cas pressing his lips together as if biting back words Dean isn't sure he would have wanted to hear, but then he blinks and slowly sits down, never breaking eye contact.
(When had he done that anyway? Cas couldn't remember. He shouldn't have done that, not without asking. Not without a reason. It looked so...easy.)
"Dunno." Dean couldn't help but smile, cuddling deeper into the angel in return. "But God, I hope it doesn't."
Dean looked actually relieved, and even as his own heart was contracting painfully, he couldn't help but be glad he'd made Dean look that way.
"I hate that my body doesn't react to touch the way I want it to. It's very...frustrating, to say the least."
