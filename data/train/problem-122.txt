"What did he want?" asked Draco as Harry left the office. He, Hermione, Fred, and George had followed slightly behind Harry.
Harry 's first class was Charms, it was quite fun, but he missed a homework assignment. In spite of that, Professor Flitwick did nothing but praise him. It was unbelievably frustrating.
Cowering in the back of the cave was a massive white dragon covered in scars. It raised its tattered wings weakly before retreating even further. There was a bloodied chain wrapped around its neck and manacles keeping it firmly in place. Even though it was a terrifying creature, the sight of it made Harry so sad. It retreated back further and further until it was attempting to climb the wall. It was trying to get away from the noise, or rather what it associated with it.
When the evening came, Sherlock and John were dressed their best, both trying very hard not to blush.
Sherlock was already waiting in a taxi with the client. Hermione and Harry joined them, Draco, Fred, George, and John finding another.
"Are you coming?" asked Draco, already standing in the doorway of the Great Hall. Harry nodded and they walked in together. A few whispers followed them. Many students thought that Harry Holmes might be The Boy Who Lived, but most weren't convinced. Even so, Harry flattened his fringe over his scar, making sure no one would see it. It was unlikely he'd be able to keep the secret for long.
"Ollivanders: Makers of Fine Wands since 382 B.C.," Harry said, reading the gold lettering above the door. "2403 years ago." He pushed the door open and stepped inside the dim shop. The shop appeared empty.
Usually, I would not risk my job and credibility by telling you this, but if you believe that Albus Dumbledore is attempting to protect this, then you must keep a close eye on it. I know most would disagree, but Dumbledore is not to be trusted.
"Hello," said Harry. He seemed quite a bit happier than he had yesterday. Sherlock smiled at him and handed him a tray of food. The boy looked shocked and Sherlock's smile faltered.
"I’m sorry to say I sold the wand that did it," he said softly. "Thirteen and a half inches. Yew. Powerful wand, very powerful, and in the wrong hands … Well, if I’d known what that wand was going out into the world to do …"
A pink-faced girl with blonde pigtails stumbled out of line, put on the hat, which fell right down over her eyes, and sat down. A moment's pause –
"And why are you here?" The man asked. Sherlock sighed. He recognised the man as Vernon Dursley. Hardly surprising, as that was the reason he had taken this case.
Harry woke up at 6 on the dot. Even though school didn't start for nearly two hours, he got up immediately and got changed into his uniform. It took him a while to figure out how to tie his tie, but once he did he ran out of his room and into the kitchen. John and Sherlock weren't up so he ran into Sherlock's room. The last thing he expected to see was both of them fully dressed tangled in each other's arms on top of the duvet. He didn't think too much about it and instead woke them by yelling rather loudly.
There were dozens of colourful shopfronts, all of them adorned with enchanted decorations floating or dancing to attract customers. The customers themselves were just as interesting, all of them wearing long robes that brushed along the cobbled pavement. A lot of them had large hats that looked like something you would find in a costume shop.
When they reached the Hospital Wing, McGonagall quickly explained everything to a confused Madam Pomfrey. The moment she realised what had happened, she healed Dumbledore and conjured some handcuffs which she then handed to Lestrade. Dumbledore stood up and turned on his heel as if trying to dissipate, but a frown appeared on his face when he realised he could.
"First-years should note that the forest in the grounds is forbidden to all pupils. A few of our older students would do well to remember that as well."
Draco didn't say much for a while, instead deciding to stare out of the window. Harry chose this time to grab a book out of his trunks and starts reading. The two remained in a comfortable silence until the compartment door was slammed open and a bushy haired girl with large teeth and her brand new Hogwarts robes on stepped in. Harry looked her over. She was eleven, a first year, and magic was completely new to her. She was also smart, right-handed, and almost always reading.
“Sherlock? Like, Sherlock Holmes?” asked Hermione, reading the letter over his shoulder. “How do you know him?”
"I'm Rubeus Hagrid, Keeper of Keys and Grounds at Hogwarts. And this," he said, reaching into one of his hundreds of pockets, "is for you." he brought out a slightly crushed box and handed it to Harry. The young boy analyzed it quickly and, once he saw that there were no traps or dangerous things, opened it. Inside was a large chocolate cake with 'Happy Birthday Harry' written on it in green icing. Still wary, Harry closed the box and put it down on a side table.
"I just wanted to make sure you weren't poking your nose in places it doesn't belong. I would hate to have to send you back to the Dursleys," said Dumbledore. Harry saw a glint in his eye and his brow crease in concentration. Harry immediately threw up walls around his mind, concentrating to push out the invader.
‘The Boy Who Lived Shall Die’ was burned into one of the walls, embers still glowing around the letters.
"We don't have all day," said Draco from behind him. Harry jumped slightly, not realising the boy had crept up behind him. He scolded himself slightly. He would not let his observation skills slip. Especially not in a place with so many secrets.
Harry soon forgot what he had been thinking as he arrived at the charms classroom, and the lesson began.
“This has been the best Christmas ever,” said Draco when they arrived back at the flat, all fairly tired. “It’s nice to be around people that actually care about you,” he said, sitting down on the couch. Harry looked at him sadly before sitting down beside him.
Mr Ollivander cried, "Oh, bravo! Yes, indeed, oh, very good. Well, well, well … how curious … how very curious …" He put Harry’s wand back into its box and wrapped it in brown paper, still muttering, "Curious … curious …"
“So, what happened?” asked Harry. The client was shaking and stuttering, so Sherlock answered for her.
"That bloody kid," said John. They shared an awkward laugh, then relaxed slightly. "So," said John, "Was he right?" Sherlock sat silently for a moment.
"Everyone in?" asked Hagrid, who was sitting in his own boat at the head of the fleet. When there were a few weak replies, Hagrid nodded and adjusted his seating. "Right then - FORWARD!"
The first-years lined up behind her and she walked out of the small chamber, back into the hall and through a pair of double doors, into the Great Hall.
“The trial’s in half an hour, so you better get changed,” said John once he saw his son was awake. Harry nodded and stood up, slowly regaining balance and consciousness as he walked up to his room.
Less than a minute later, Hagrid was on the ground, blood streaming from his nose and John being held back by both Sherlock and Mycroft.
"That's Hagrid. He's from my new school!" Harry began to explain everything he knew about Hogwarts and magic, and everything he picked up from the way Hagrid looked and acted.
The next day, Sherlock hired a van and they drove all their stuff to the new flat, 221b Baker Street. They unpacked and spent the day settling in. Harry explored each and every corner, searching for secrets and treasure. He didn't find much and soon grew bored of this endeavour. Then he curled up on the new sofa with a book and practised reading. He was very good at it and only had to ask for Sherlock's help a few times. The book was kind of boring though, and Harry soon switched to practising his writing. Sherlock said that he was going to start school in a few months, and Harry did not want to be behind.
"Well, I am not your uncle," said Sherlock as he slowly approached Harry. The boy flinched again, then relaxed as Sherlock wrapped his arms around him and pulled him into a hug. Harry hugged back and sighed.
There was another boom, shaking the floor they were standing on. Sherlock grabbed his gun from inside his jacket and raised it at the door. It was hit another time and Harry saw cracks forming in the surface. He could see that it would only take two more hits of the same force before it was broken open.
"I've got school today!" exclaimed Harry. Both men sat straight up. They looked at each other, slightly confused. Then they groaned and rubbed their heads.
“Y’know, a few months ago I would’ve wanted this less than anything, and now I want nothing more,” said Draco, smiling slightly tearfully. Harry briefly wondered how bad his parents were, but decided not to ask.
"Hello?" called Harry, his eyes scanning the stacks of thin boxes behind the counter. A man with silver hair and unblinking, grey eyes appeared behind the counter.
After all the presents had been opened and everyone had been thanked, the seven of them went out for lunch, as no one in the Holmes-Watson family could cook.
"You okay, Sherl?" asked John. Sherlock shook his head. John pulled the taller man into a hug and they stayed there for a moment. "I know it's confusing, but we'll sort it out. We always do."
This continued for around seven years, then Sherlock proposed. John, of course, said yes. Everyone was in high spirits as the wedding was planned. It was a glorious occasion. There were only around thirty guests, as neither John nor Sherlock had many friends, but they didn't mind. Harry was so happy to finally see his dads getting married. It had been years since he'd called either by their names and was excited that they were both going to be his legal fathers.
"Sure. A point from Slytherin." Harry wanted to protest, but knew it wouldn't help. Instead, he took a seat next to Draco. A few seconds later, a redhead burst through the door, panting loudly. The professor looked at him with disdain.
As he watched the owl go, Harry felt as if he shouldn’t have sent it. Well, he couldn’t exactly stop it. It seemed odd that he would get that letter. As common as his name was, there weren’t any other Harrys at Hogwarts. Maybe the letter was meant for him, but he didn’t have a dad. That he was sure of. Right? Now that he thought about it, he wasn’t so sure. How could he remember calling someone Dad if he knew he’d grown up with the Dursleys? One of his memories was wrong, but the one with no proof felt so much more real. What had Fawn said? Just remember and the charm will be broken? It was something like that.
Snape paired each of them up. Harry was paired with Draco, something both of them were happy about. It turned out that Draco was quite good at potions. Things seemed to improve for Harry once the lesson began properly, but he saw that Snape would take every opportunity to pick on and insult the Gryffindors.
When he reached his dorm, everyone was asleep. He got ready for bed as quietly as he could, lying down and setting his glasses on his bedside table far too loudly for the time of night. He shut his eyes and willed himself to go to sleep.
"Wizards are old-fashioned. I'm sure it'll sort itself out one day. You're a very difficult person. An incredibly sharp mind, Plenty of courage, I see. There's talent, oh my goodness, yes – and a nice thirst to prove yourself, now that's interesting ... So where shall I put you?"
"Morning, Mycroft," he said cheerily to the eldest Holmes. Mycroft said nothing, not even bothering to look up from his newspaper. Harry walked up to the table and saw a large range of cereal boxes and a jug of milk. He made himself a bowl of coco-pops but felt too excited to eat.
"Yeah. It's called Legilimency. But it isn't supposed to hurt unless the Legilimen wants it to." Draco looked at his friend worriedly. "You don't think Dumbledore is using Legilimency, do you? Because I'm pretty sure it's illegal. If I tell my father, he'll put a stop to it immediately." With those words, all emotion dropped from Draco's face as he put on his Malfoy mask.
"You too, John," he replied. Mrs Hudson tutted and ushered them out of the door into a waiting taxi. They drove off into the night. Mrs Hudson turned to Harry.
“I did it! Dumbledore’s gonna be in prison for the rest of his life!” he exclaimed, before passing out on the carpet.
A few minutes later, Hermione came into the living room, joined moments later by Fred and George. Neither of the twins looked particularly well-rested, but they both looked quite happy.
"No. Father never told me. He said he wasn't able to. It must be something that you cannot be prepared for." Harry suddenly felt very nervous. While Slytherin sounded like a perfectly good house, one of the best perhaps, the way McGonnogal said its name made Harry think being a Slytherin was something that was frowned upon.
"Okay," said John. He kissed Sherlock on the cheek and left the room. Sherlock stood there, dumbstruck for a few seconds, then he came back to his senses and told Harry to get himself some breakfast. Harry obliged happily, thinking about the interesting people he was going to meet today. As he reached the kitchen, he saw there was a box of Coco Pops on the bench. There was a note attached.
Harry had all but gone into shock after discovering the missing wand and—the slightly more pressing issue of—the missing headmaster. It took mere minutes before Sherlock, John, and Harry were piling into a police car. Lestrade turned on the sirens and sped through London, not taking his foot off the accelerator until he screeched to a stop outside of 221b. Everyone sprinted out and up into the flat, Harry summoning his trunk and all his potions things before making a tracking potion faster than he ever had before.
He looked at the boy closely and did a quick deduction. Rich, proud, right-handed, and heavily influenced by his parents. Harry had a feeling there wasn't a single thought that went through his mind that someone else hadn't put there.
“This court case is going to be quite difficult, as the only evidence is in your head, so stay strong, but there’s no guarantee he’ll be charged.” Harry nodded, already with a plan beginning to form. As he followed everyone else out of the school, he began running through laws and protocols in his mind, switching between muggle and magic until he had what he hoped was the perfect case.
"What are you guys talking about?" asked Hermione. Harry explained the events of the previous night, getting more and more excited with each word.
"RAVENCLAW!" The table second from the left clapped this time; several Ravenclaws stood up to shake hands with Terry as he joined them.
It took a lot longer for the cart to stop, but once it did, Griphook grabbed the clankers and handed them out.
When they came home later that afternoon, Sherlock began the rather small task of packing. They had bought some boxes and were done in a few hours. It tired them out, and they both fell asleep quickly that night.
It was dim and loud, the only light reflecting off of the eyes of owls. Harry spent a while looking at all the different owls until he settled on a snowy white one.
Harry arrived home and flopped onto his bed, sad and bored out of his mind. Sherlock knocked lightly on the doorframe.
There was a grand gravel driveway fringed with a traditional English wood. Where the wood ended, there was a massive lawn with a hedge maze and statues all around. The driveway split and went around a large fountain made of white marble. The Manor itself was three stories tall, made of red brick and covered in ivy. Harry could tell that each branch of the vine had been perfectly guided to give the nicest possible result. The dozens of windows were all in perfect condition and there was not a shingle was out of place and there was a small amount of smoke coming out of every chimney.
"Have you asked Mycroft to look into Hogwarts? That could give us a lead," suggested Harry. Sherlock nodded and took out his phone.
"I meant no disrespect," said Hagrid, holding his nose in an attempt to get the blood to stop. Sherlock and John ignored him. Mycroft just looked at him disapprovingly.
"Really Sherlock, just think about it. Do you really think you're the most suitable candidate for the boy's guardian?" Mycroft asked for what felt like the millionth time.
The car slowed to a stop and the doors were opened by the chauffeur. Harry stared in awe at the massive building before him. He had never seen it before, as the relationship between Sherlock and his brother was far from familiar.
It took no more than half an hour before Harry was dipping the needle in the potion and casting a spell he’d made up to begin the tracking process. The needle swung around for a few moments before jerking violently to one corner of the room and firmly embedding itself in the paper of a map. Harry ran over to the map. Upon seeing where it was, he grabbed a more detailed map of the same area. The pin once again pierced the paper and Harry was able to see the exact address; Shieldhill Castle Hotel.
"Be careful," said Draco, "they mean every flavour, including vomit." The small, blue bean in Harry's hand looked slightly less appealing. Then Harry reminded himself of that time he had to walk through the London sewers and found a decaying body. Nothing could be worse than that. He popped the jellybean in his mouth and bit down, pleasantly surprised when instead of anything horrible, the bean tasted of blueberry.
This went on for a while, the pile of wands slowly growing larger. Harry was becoming impatient when Ollivander brought another one. The second it touched Harry's fingers, a warmth spread through his arm. He brought it down in a swishing motion and sparks burst from the tip. Harry smiled and turned around, laughing slightly at the shocked look on Sherlock's face.
"Well, he won't dare bother me again," said Harry as he began walking back to the Slytherin common room.
Harry had never been to London before. All the sights and sounds were awesome, if slightly overwhelming. When they went on the London Eye, they got a pod to themselves. Harry stood right up against the glass, staring, awestruck, at the city below. They went higher and higher and Harry looked at everything. He ran around the pod, looking at all the views of London city.
"YOU'RE HARRY POTTER!" Immediately, every student in the hallway ran towards him. He dodged their outstretched hands and ducked under their arms before sprinting away at top speed. They followed him until he reached his class. A few kids followed him into the cold classroom, but upon seeing the teacher, quickly backed out.
"I'm fine Professor. I just have homework to do." Harry tried to walk past him, but Dumbledore subtly blocked his path.  "I've really got to go," said Harry, ducking under Dumbledore's arm and making a break for the door. Dumbledore didn't pursue him, but Harry didn't bother slowing down. He sprinted down the many stairs into the dungeons, stopping only when he was outside the common room. He caught his breath before saying the password and stepping inside.
When they reached the platforms, Harry took a deep breath before walking quickly toward the barrier. He wanted to speed up, but knew that he could risk losing control.
"Yeah. Do you know why I'm famous?" Harry asked, knowing it was a stupid question, but needing the answer. Draco nodded.
Around an hour later, the younger Holmes's family were being driven through the grounds of Holmes House. House was quite an understatement, thought Harry.
"Give me a minute, Malfoy." Harry slowly got up and pulled on his uniform. Hedwig's cage was still sitting on top of his trunk and she hooted softly. Harry opened the cage and she flew onto his shoulder. He grabbed a treat and fed it to her before grabbing his school bag and leaving the dormitory.
"There was no posion on them if that's why you ask, but go ahead." I nodded in thanks and moved over to the clothes, ruffling through them. Nothing on the clothes but a small strand of blonde hair. Irrelevant. I shook my head and continued my search.
"No. You get restless without a case. We are going." I said. I wasn't going to have my mind changed either. He sighed and put his violen up.
"Wait... if you can't study the DNA how could you know it was Mary? And secondly, why would Mike let her in?"
The door of the apartment opened slowly with a creak as Mrs. Hudson walked in. She hurriedly made her way over to me and wrapped her arms around me. She said nothing as I cried and I was grateful for that because I didn't think I'd be able to talk if I tried.
"You too Mrs. Hudson." He called and I rolled my eyes. Mycroft looked to be enjoying himself but why?
Once we pulled up to the hospital, I passed the Cabbie some notes before clambering out after Sherlock. "So why exactly are we here?" I asked. He continued as though he didn't hear me, which would make sense because it's Sherlock and he tends to do that.
Closing my eyes, I mapped out the quickest route to Wilson and Kyle. It was only a few streets away. Wrapping my coat tighter around me, I sprinted off towards the factory. I never actually met the person behind the number and I was curious to find out what they looked like. Was it a male or a female?
Lestrade sighed. He walked towards me. "He was found dead in his bathroom this morning. No signs of a break-in. Sherlock... we're stumped. We could use the help." I shook my head. I refused to leave John's side.
"Good." he whispered. When the cab stopped I gave him the notes and climbed out of the car, Sherlock in tow. It was getting dark out and I realized we stayed out a lot longer than we thought.
We sat in utter silence, not the awkward kind of silence but one that's comfotable. Each of us glad the other is there. We sat like that for a few hours before Sherlock finally shuddered and I realized we were still outside in the snow and he had no scarf.
I groaned, sitting back on my heels. What the hell? "Can you please get out?" I snapped. I couldn't think and I was frustrated. Lestrade stayed behind. I didn't really mind though. Partially because I liked Lestrade and partially because if Mycroft was going to call anyone for any changes, Lestrade would be the first. "Do you mind?" I asked gesturing towards the body and he shrugged.
"What is it? Is he alright?" I asked quickly, despite knowing that I was right and he was gone. My deductions were hardly ever wrong. She sighed slowly and shook her head.
"This is a crappy first date... I can't stop crying but... at least we're in this together. I miss you so much and I don't know how much longer I can live without you here. It hurts to know that I won't hear that beautiful violin at the ungodly hours of the wee morning. I won't hear your chuckles in amusement and will never see your eyes twinkle when you win."
"Him or me? M" Lestrade mumbled and I saw John shudder. I wrapped my arms around him. "What does that mean?" he asked turning towards us. John's eyes were closed and he was trying to breathe normally.
"I suppose we wouldn't." he said, lowering his voice. "And I wouldn't be able to do this." he chuckled as he pulled me down on top of his as we fell to the couch.  "Or this." he whispered as he stroked my face lovingly. "And I most definitely wouldn't be able to do this." he whispered pulling me down and kissing me.
I spent two years, trying to get rid of the network for fear of losing the man I loved but it seemed that I had already lost him. He tried to kill himself, multiple times and it was my fault. Now he was here in a hospital bed because of me, because he couldn't let go. He couldn't move on. A tear ran down my cheek and I wiped at it furiously, chuckling. God, this man changed me so much. "Why did you have to go?" I asked sadly.
"Oh my goodness. You are so adorable." I said jumping on the bed and kissing him again. "Maybe that's why I love you."
"Molly and I ended our relationship just before she left. We were just awkward and she likes another person. Anyway, I need a place to stay, can I stay here?" he asked. Looking over to Sherlock to make sure he was okay with it, John nodded.
When I woke up the next morning John wasn't there and for a second I thought I was back in Molly's house. I couldn't bear the thought of losing everything I had just dreamed about. I had wanted it for so long and I thought I had it but... none of it was real.
"Hey, Sherlock. I found all of this wedding stuff on your table. You're solving a case. I have nothing to do... do you mind if I..." she trailed off.
"No it doesn't but I have people who care enough to help me get through it. Hey, can I ask you a question?"
"You're not stupid and it is my fault. If I hadn't 'died' in the first place, you wouldn't be here right now."
A warm pair of arms wrapped around me and I freaked out. I struggled to get away from the person holding me but in vain. He whispered in my ear, trying to calm me down and once I recognized the voice I froze.
The stall opened and John walked out, twirling round in his shorts, making me chuckle. "They look great now go back in." He nodded, chuckling as he walked back into the stall.
I took a shaky breath as I stood up. I gazed down at the man who, even in death, looked perfect. "I'm so sorry for getting you killed." I whispered as I leaned down, planting a kiss on his forehead. I felt so guilty about it and I turned to leave. I couldn't look at him any longer or I'd break down again.
"Yeah. Pretty much." John started laughing an I joined I moments later. John put the trays on my bed so he wouldn't spill them, hunched over laughing.
"I do mind and I won't move. I was told not to let you out of the flat anyway." I groaned. Of course he was and since John didn't exactly have any henchman I knew it had to be Mycroft.
"Why did you choose Mycroft's place? He isn't the best person. He is more cold-hearted than Sherlock."
"Well as we both know Mike was alone in the shower. He wasn't killed and then dragged in here. You can tell because there are no scrap marks or blood on the carpet. He did't commit suicide because there would have been a weapon in here. He had to have died in the shower because he is wet and his hair still has shampoo in it. The wound on his abdomen could have killed him if it had been laced with poison but the skin color is the same and there is now odor of it. The rust on the pipes is mainly on the front because the water runs down it but if you look closely you see that the rust is facing the other direction. The pipes were tampered with. Mike doesn't mess with his pipes he calls a plumber that's why I called Mycroft. No plumber in the past two days. I know it was the past two days because the rust was facing the right way two days ago when we all went to the bar. Head has a bump on it so he was knocked out by the trophy closest to his arm chair. Not in the right position you can tell because you can see a slight part that wasn't covered in dust where the trophy was previously. The shower water was poisoned during this time he was knocked out. The poison was in his throat that's how I knew there was a poison in the first place. Red throat, bumps, thick and swollen neck. He wouldn't drink the water but two days ago when we were at the bar he told us he sang in the shower. That's how he died."
He tilted my face up to his and I closed my eyes. "Please go away. I know you're not real. Just like all of my dreams, you would never actually be here, touching me as though I was important. Even if you were alive right now, you would never talk to me or look at me the way you are now."
A nurse walked in and giggled. "You two seem like you're having a moment. I'll come back." Then she turned to leave.
"I tried to move on without you. I have ended up in the hospital a few times. I couldn't find it in me to move on no matter how hard I tried."
Once dinner was over we sat by the fire and told jokes. Sherlock had his arm wrapped around me with a blanket shrouding our shoulders. Mrs. Hudson sat closest to the fire with a blanket and Lestrade and Molly were doing the same thing as Sherlock and I were.
"Oh no. It was truly a great idea. Though you could have made the whole thing better." Mycroft was fully awake now, staring at me.
"It's not your fault. These things happen you know. You just need to learn to live and move on." I mumbled.
"I love you Sherlock Holmes and I hate that it took me so long to realize it. I wish I could tell you in person but I'm stuck talking to your grave." I chuckled. "It's quite funny actually but... I want to ask you... well now this sounds so much stupider out loud than in my head... Will you be my husband Sherlock Holmes?" I asked chuckling as tears continued to slide down my face.
"Please look around and see if you can find out where he went. He could be in major trouble.... thanks" I hung up and scrambled down the stairs, bumping into someone at the base. "Sorry dude." I mumbled as I tried to manuver around him.
Groaning again, I pulled my legs out of bed and sat hunched over, rubbing my eyes, trying to get rid of the haunting thoughts that plagued my mind. I pulled myself out of bed and stumbled to the kitchen to prepare my tea.
I sat there, staring at the wall for quite a while. Occasionally telling John whether to keep a pair of shorts or not.
Slowly starting to drift off, Sherlock noticed a glimmering heart-shaped locket on her neck that wasn't there at the start. Slamming his hand down and startling a sleeping John, he gathered the files and his phone.
I smiled and turned to look at the bodies, suddenly wishing that I didn't. All the air left my lungs and I stumbled back against the wall, my smile falling. "Are you alright?" Lestrade asked. Sherlock whipped around and glanced me up and down.
A loud creak resounded through the empty warehouse as I swung the door open, making me cringe. I stepped forward, the door slamming shut behind me and making me jump. "Don't worry sweetheart. He's not going to hurt you." the man said chuckling. I may not have met the person I was meeting but I most definitely have met this one. I never cared to learn his name but he was the best sniper I knew.
He rubbed the back of his neck nervously and I smiled widely. "Seriously. It's fine. Now how long are we going for?"
"I didn't expect you'd have a guest." he mumbled, eyeing Lestrade quickly. Lestrade didn't seem to notice but it was noticed by John. "You probably wouldn't like Sherlock's violin playing at 2:30 in the morning."
"I knew you two were gay." Anderson cackled. I glared at him and he visibly gulped, turning and going to find Donavan no doubt. I closed my eyes and took a deep breath, wiping the tears from my eyes.
A plate of eggs was placed in front of me and a small plate of bacon along with it. I silently thanked Mrs. Hudson as she left the apartment. I picked at the food for at least an hour before throwing it out and grabbing my jacket and Sherlock's scarf before heading out.
"Well in that case I should just go." I chuckled, getting up and purposefully swaying my hips as I walked towards the door. I turned to see him bright red as he looked up at me. I started laughing and he turned even more red.
"Stop pacing brother, you're making me nervous." Mycroft muttered and I sighed as I sat down, running my hands through my hair. I bounced my leg up and down in anticipation, biting my lip and hoping that they would come soon because the longer they took to come give news, the smaller the chance of him waking up.
"Unfortunately I do." He sighed. I playfully hit his arm and huffed, pulling his scarf off and twirling it around my neck.
I was really excited to see where we were going. There were so many amazing places in Laughlin. Lots of resorts and casinos.
"Neither did I." The Cabbie pulled over and I got out, handing him some notes. "Thanks." I mumbled as John got out behind me. I jogged over to Lestrade and when I noticed the body I quickly turned to John.
When no more tears could fall, I looked up and smiled sadly at Mrs. Hudson who returned the sad smile. "You  really need to eat something." she finally said. I shook my head, still not trusting myself to speak.
I smiled as I watched Sherlock sing, a large smile plastered on his face. After the song finished he turned towards me. "What?"
"Whatever." I mumbled, rolling my eyes. We spent all afternoon playing the game and I was growing aggravated. John. Kept. Winning.
I stood stock still, staring at the scene before me. A man holding a knocked out Mycroft at gunpoint. He was tied to the chiar, phone broken to pieces on the floor and the camera's in the room shattered to pieces on the floor.
"We have the autopsy reports. You were right. She did bleed and he was choked." Lestrade paused and I looked over to him. "Sherlock... they were..."
"Congratulations again Sherlock. You solved yet another mind boggling case." He clapped me on the back. His phone started ringing and I stared at it anxiously. "Y-yes?" he asked, silently cursing himself for the stutter. I heard him sigh in relief and I felt relief as well. "We'll be there as soon as possible." he said and smiled at me.
I growled as he won again. "I was so close." I whined. He stuck his tongue out, a smile on his face.
"Oh well... it would have looked so much better if it were you instead of Mike. Perhaps I could put you there myself. It would make the art a masterpiece." I said smiling even bigger now. John stared at me in horror but I didn't care. Let him see this side of me. Let him see what he did.
"Just come on." he whispered, grabbing my hand. I hid my face in my scarf and quickly followed him. We walked into the Cafe and took a seat in the back corner so that no one could see my face. When the waitress showed up, I looked at the picture on the wall so she couldn't see my face.
I slowly sat up, my back and neck aching due to the hunched over position I was sleeping in. Quiet beeping filled the otherwise silent room, the only indicator that he was still alive. He looked so peaceful. I could almost imagine he wasn't lying here in a hospital bed. I smiled slightly to myself, grabbing his hand. He was brave, braver than anyone I have ever known. No one would be willing to do meet someone who continuously hurt them. No one would continue to work on something, despite the pain, so long as others are saved.
"I'm here. Omg." I fumbled for the button next to his bed and smiled widely as the nurses rushed in.
"John... John... look at me. Please look at me. Does this feel fake to you?" I asked wiping a tear from his cheek. I pulled him closer before finally kissing him. I couldn't believe this was actually happening right now.
"He... he's alive." one of them exclaimed and I nodded because I knew if I opened my mouth I would laugh in delight. "You need to leave for a bit but he should be fine." the nurse said, ushering me out of the room. I stood in the hallway, surprised about what had just happened.
Please don't say what I think you're going to say. Please tell me that for once my deductions are wrong. "Mr. Sherlock Holmes?" she asked sadly. I felt my heart breaking again, tears filling my eyes, but I refused to cry unless she told me he was dead. Shaking my head, I slowly got up.
"Everything is wrong with me. You broke me and now... I'm going to break you... and I'm going to enjoy every single second of it. But that's not why I called you here."
"Y-yes. Yesterday when we were there... in the graveyard. I had snuck closer to hear what you were saying. There was something different about you yesterday and I crept closer to hear. I saw the blade in your pocket and my heart stopped. I was so terrified." I shook my head. "We best get going so that we aren't late to the dinner you're hosting."
He stretched and pulled me down as he did so. He pressed his lips to mine. A smooth, slow kiss to show that something was there but we weren't in a hurry. Molly squealed and he smiled lightly againt my lips as Lestrade walked in, smiling widely.
Hailing a cab proved to be more difficult a task than usual. Sliding into the sleek black cab, Sherlock told the cabbie where to go. Ringing resounded throughout the vehicle as he waited for a voice on the other end.
"They really are. Wait... did you just say you liked the otter?" I asked as we put the book on the counter.
"No thank you. I don't need fingers in the salad." Mrs. Hudson chuckled. I nodded and Sherlock stumbled slightly.
"I'm still sorry. Maybe if you went on and found someone else. A new flatmate long before Mike found you, maybe we never would have been in this situation. Maybe you... after we get through this.... maybe you should find someone who won't hurt you like I do." I smiled sadly, tears in my eyes.
"I don't care why you did it John. I trusted you with every fiber of my being. I wanted to believe you actually cared because I love you but you were lying all this time. You don't care about me or my emotions. You probably find them disturbing. Maybe I'll just go back to being a Sociopath. Shut myself off to everyone. At least that way, you won't have a look of disgust on your face everytime you look at me."
"Well I was hoping we could leave today..." he started, but seeing the look on my face, he quickly added, "but I wouldn't mind leaving whenever you want."
"Or maybe it's your brilliant mind." I said kissing his temple. "Or you beautiful smile. Maybe it's the way your nose sometimes crinkles when you laugh. I don't know what it is, but your adorable and I love you anyway."
"It's perfect. Thank you gusy so much." I smiled hugging them all at once. This was an amazing Christmas and to think, I was going to kill myself tonight after saying my goodbyes and yet here I was with the love of my life having a great time. What a turn of events.
"It's alright. No need to kill such a useful pawn." the man muttered and the yellow-toothed man took a step back, crossing his tattooed arms and leaning against a pillar. "Anyway... let's get down to business. The real reason you're here." he then paused and I waited patiently for what he had to say. I had a feeling he wouldn't particularly enjoy me interrupting him.
At last when the ringing stopped and a voice answered on the other end, he knew where they were headed. Slightly angry, Molly awaited there arrival and showed them into the morgue. Studying the female, Sherlock noticed nothing different aside from the locket.
John watched, a bemused expression gracing his tired features, as the lithe man slipped on his navy blue coat. Studying the files he had just been given, he notice the locket around her neck and quickly followed Sherlock out into the oddly warm winter night.
He told me to get in and pushed the canoe out into the water and hopped in after me. "Uh... John..."
"Unless there's a reason she wants to be found." I said. John looked at me like I was crazy. "What?"
He turned to find John smiling widely and when he asked why John just smiled even wider. Sherlock stood on his side of the bed and John grabbed his waist pulling him down into the bed with him.
John punched my shoulder and chuckled. "You sound like a cheesy romantic, but I love you too." He leaned over and kissed me before slowly drifting off to sleep. I smiled as I breathed in his scent, glad that I finally had John.
I couldn't breathe for a second and my knees hit the snow. When at last I caught my breath, I sat there in the snow, hunched over. I don't know what I'd do if that actually happend.
"The only reason you are in this situation is because of me so you should have let her." I whispered.
"Fine." He huffed. He played back on the bed, pulling me on top of him and we cuddled up watching bBeauty and the Beast.
"You looked tired. You needed the sleep. You should go home, have some proper rest. I'll be fine." he said and I instantly shook my head "Oh well. It was worth a try." he sighed. I grabbed his hand and smiled widely. "The doctor said I should be out of here in a day or two. I need to be careful for a bit though so I don't open the stitches." I nodded eagerly. I couldn't wait to get back home.
"Because I, John Hamish Watson, have fallen for you hard. I love every single thing about you and making you happy, Sherlock, is the only thing I could ever wish for." he said in between kisses. Then he pulled away and open the files leaving me breathless. I chuckled and sat up to look at the files too.
Both boys were a little tipsy as they giggled about John's little hiccup. They watched as the flames licked the logs which melted away to nothing but ash. The warmth washed over the two, leaving them in a peaceful silence, enjoying the other's company.
"John... John... look at me. Please look at me. Does this feel fake to you?" he asked but I wouldn't open my eyes. He grabbed my chin again and wiped a tear away from my eye. He pulled me close and I breathed in the scent that was just so inexplicably... him."
The hand marks on her neck aren't bright red so it couldn't have been there too long. Lestrade thudded up the stairs, handing me the scalpel. I made a cut on her arm. Thinner cut after death, no blood, skin sticks up. These cuts were made when she was alive.
The handle hit my back making the door rattle and Mary's head snapped up. When she spotted me, her smile grew and she watched me. John turned his head towards me, smile falling. My heart thudded in my chest. "John..." I choked out.
"Normally I would think that seeing Sherlock getting slapped would be the funniest thing ever," I spun around to find Lestrade talking to John who was nodding slightly. "But I agree with her this time. Don't you ever do that again."
"No. It's not Harry but you do know who it is." I said. He frowned in confusion and pushed past me. I closed my eyes and sighed as I waited to see his reaction. "I'm so sorry. John." I whispered. My phone rang and I picked up, walking away from John, giving him a moment with his dead therapist.
Once I entered and found Sherlock's grave, all of the cold I felt was gone and nothing was left but despair. I fell to my knees before his grave and a wretched sob escaped my lips. I pressed my head to the headstone and tears streaked down my face.
"So not only do put looks compare to an otter and a hedgehog, I don't see it but the fans do, but our personalities too." Sherlock muttered. I chuckled.
Reading his mind as usual, Sherlock replied. "I would have forgotten that I saw it." Chuckling, John leaned into Sherlock. Upon arriving at their flat, John noticed a figure sitting on the front step.
"There's always a place at my manison." Mycroft suggested. John's brows furrowed in confusion. Mycroft never showed kindness to anyone.
It took him a little longer than it took me but in the end I got John and I think that's all that mattered.
"No... I can't find my shampoo." I muttered. I wasn't lying either. I hadn't been able to find my shampoo for a few days.
I groaned, feeling a slight shifting next to me. Where am I? There was a slight beeping and I slowly opened my eyes to find myself in a plain white room. I groaned again. I was in the hospital. Why couldn't I just die? I felt a slight shifting again and I turned to find John waking up. He looked so adorable. Then I remembered what happened yesterday and I scowled, pulling my hand out of his.
I put my fingers to his throat, a small lump. Odd. I pulled his chin down. His throat was bright red and bumpy. So it had been poison of some kind and because of the bumps and redness, as well as the thickness of his throat, it killed him immediately. So it couldn't have been given to him before he got in the shower because he would have been found in his room. He wasn't dragged in here either so he was definitely poisoned in the shower. But how?
"It's about time Jo..." she started as the door swung open. I pulled away and turned to her smiling.
"Of course I'm willing to help out everyone. I love you too." he said leaning up and kissing my my cheek. "I am willing to do this because it'll help the people. It will help me figure out who did it and why and most of all, because as much as you don't want to admit it, you want the case. You need it and I want you to be happy."
"Oh no. I have another reason. I'm not going to kill everyone you love. I just had to so that a case would start. I will win in the end and you will be so utterly destroyed that ... well I can't reveal that now can I?" I growled at her.
"DON'T MOVE!" She yelled and I froze, terrified of what would happen if I moved an inch. Sirens went off in the background and I silently cursed Sherlock. She chuckled. "You clever little arse. Calling the cops." She smiled and I knew something bad was gonna happen.
Christmas Eve. One of the most heartbreaking days ever. Today was going to be the day I tell him, even if it's way too late, how I felt about him. The snow slid down my coat and I shivered as I quickly walked to the graveyard.
Harry put down the letter and laughed. All this worry and it was just a prank. He chucked the letter into the bin and went back to watching TV.
By the time the front door opened, the sun had risen and Harry was shaking. John and Sherlock both apologised for taking so long, promising to tell their son what had happened once they had slept. Harry agreed and waited on the sofa, too jittery to sleep, but too tired to do anything.
Then something happened that almost took his mind off of his nervousness. Several pearly-white figures were floating into the room, through the walls and ceiling. Just about everyone gasped, there were even a few screams. The figures glided across the room, talking to each other and ignoring the students below them. They seemed to be arguing.
"It was one time," he said, raising his hands in defence, "and we made a deal Harry." Harry smirked and got up to grab another cup of coffee.
"It has come to my attention that the two of you are avoiding something. It is something that even a blind man could see. I will be starting school next week, so you two will be spending a long time alone together. Might I recommend you put aside your pride and admit you have feelings for each other?" John opened his mouth to protest, but Harry kept on talking. "John, every single one of your girlfriends has been tall, slightly boring, and will almost always be wearing a dark overcoat, much like my father sitting next to you. I have made reservations at a restaurant somewhere, ask Mrs Hudson, and you are going to stop ignoring your feelings and confront them like the adults you are. Thank you." Harry stepped out of the room and went to read on his bed.
"Anything from the trolley dears?" she asked in a sweet voice. Harry thought for a moment before nodding and grabbing a handful of each and depositing a large number of galleons in the lady's outstretched hand.
"I think so. It's never hurt like that before. Probably nothing." He picked up his goblet and took a sip of pumpkin juice. "This is so gross," he decided, putting it back on the table. Harry looked up at the top table. Quirrel was talking to Snape. There was another spike of pain through his scar.
"Well then," said the Professor, "we need to buy your school supplies. John, Sherlock, would you care to join us?" They nodded.
"We should get going," said Griphook. Everyone agreed, and a while later, they had rejoined John and were standing on the steps of Gringotts, all ready to explore Diagon Alley.
Mycroft told his brother all he had found and also asked him if he thought adoption was really the right choice. Sherlock, of course, told Mycroft that he could do what he liked, besides, Mrs Hudson could help out.
They talked in length about all they had found out, quieting only when a teacher or student walked past.
"Ahem - just a few more words now we are all fed and watered. I have a few start-of-term notices to give you.
"Jeez Sherlock, what did you do that for!" Sherlock said nothing, only pointing at the cupboard. "Oh my god," Lestrade whispered. He turned around and faced Mr Dursley, who was holding a bleeding nose. "Mr Dursley, you are under arrest on suspicion of child abuse and neglect. You do not have to say anything, but it may harm your defence if you do not mention when questioned something which you later rely on in court. Anything you do say may be given in evidence." Mr Dursley was so shocked he didn't even try to stop Lestrade from handcuffing him. It was at this time that Mrs Dursley entered the foyer and let out a scream at the sight of her husband.
Harry was too tired to hear what was said, but the wall slid back to reveal a warm common room bathed in green light. He looked up and saw the lake and the giant squid just outside. The new students were directed to their dormitories. Harry pushed open the door and found his trunk next one of the five four-poster beds. He pulled off his robes, out on his pyjamas and collapsed onto the bed. He was asleep in seconds.
"I wonder what that dog is guarding," said Draco as they walked back down to their common room. They had decided to leave it for another day. Neither of them wanted to be eaten, and it was also nearing the end of the day. Over Filch finding them out of bed and being attacked by the dog, the latter was preferable.
"He's a bit odd, isn't he," said Draco. "Hogwarts really has gone to the dogs. Potatoes Harry?" Harry's jaw dropped. The empty gold platters that covered the table were now filled with food of every kind. There were roasts and Yorkshire puddings, and peas, carrots, chips, sausages, bacon, and, for some reason, mint humbugs. Harry piled his plate high, the massive amounts of food reminding him of Mycroft's home. The thought of his family made him slightly sad. He missed them already.
“Do you guys wanna come?” he asked his friends. Everyone was quick to say yes and they all followed John down the stairs and back on to the street.
“Honestly, not your best joke, Fred,” said George, cracking a smile. Fred smiled back, mirroring his twin exactly. Draco sighed and turned to Sherlock and John.
"Uncle said it was because I cried too much." Sherlock scowled. He hated that man even more. He hoped that he would be imprisoned for the rest of his life, but he knew it was unlikely, as Harry wasn't a justifiable witness.
"Where did you get this?" Sherlock asked. Harry didn't know what he was talking about, so he shrugged. "The scar, on your forehead." Harry still had no idea what Sherlock was referring to and told him just that. Sherlock frowned. Most children, even two-year-olds, would notice something like that. Unless there was something impairing his vision.
"It's a school where kids with magic go to learn how to use their powers. You're a wizard Harry." Hagrid looked at Harry expectantly, looking for surprise or disbelief. Instead, Harry had a wistful expression on his face.
When they came to the living room, Fred and George stopped in shock. A young man of around thirty was splayed out on the floor, a look of pure terror on his face. There were a few footprints in the dust, leading from the centre of the room to about a meter away from the wall before disappearing entirely.
After ordering some furniture from IKEA, Sherlock made a new room in his mind palace and began to fill it with information about raising children. It seemed that it would be fairly straightforward, but also quite time-consuming. It also looked as if his current living arrangements were inadequate. Perhaps it was time to move. He quickly went through all of his contacts, trying to decide who might be of assistance, and settled on an old lady known as Mrs Hudson.
Albus Dumbledore was now on his feet. He was smiling at each and every student, though Harry saw it become ever so slightly forced when looking at the Slytherin table. He had his arms open wide, welcoming everyone into his school.
“I don’t blame you, but I don’t think I forgive you yet. I want to, but I don’t think I can.” Harry took a step back from Draco and nodded.
Hedwig was just waking up when he arrived. She flew down quickly and stuck her foot out, allowing Harry to tie the letter on and tell her who it was for before she flew off.
"I can see them too." Harry turned and saw Neville clutching his toad. "Not everyone can. They're pretty scary though."
"I'll be a better guardian than the Dursley's." And this was a point that Mycroft could not disagree with. Sure, his brother was often cold and emotionless, but whenever he was around Harry, everything about him changed. He became like a regular human. Not a highly functioning sociopath as he put it.
Professor McGonagall reached the front of the Hall and placed down a three-legged stool and a dirty wizard's hat. Harry looked at it closely, as did everyone else in the hall. It was covered in dirt and patches, with a few tears here and there.
Stuff happened, as it so often does, and I barely had any time to write, so I’m sorry this took so long, but I hope you enjoy it, and thank you so much for reading. It really means a lot.
"Wingardium Leviosa." Harry's glasses flew into the air and collided with the ceiling, crumpling up and smashing. Then they dropped to the floor.
“We slowly walked through the house, checking each room before arriving at the final one, right on the top floor. The door was open and the dust masked all footsteps. The aurors went in first, wands raised, ready for trouble. And trouble they met.
John and Sherlock would basically sit outside of his door, waiting for the inevitable screams before running in to comfort their son. It only got worse when Dumbledore reminded Harry of Fawn and Voldemort. His dreams soon became warped nightmares of a red-eyed Vernon Dudley standing over him while Fawn stood laughing in the corner, though they somehow appeared concerned at the same time.
Slowly, the seven of them moved down to the hospital wing, all of them asking dozens of questions, few of which could really be answered.
"I don't know. You'll have an answer in a few months," Sherlock replied. He and John looked at each other then quickly looked away. The rest of the walk was in silence, no-one really feeling the need to talk.
“It’s awesome,” said Harry, slightly out of breath. He looked out the window briefly and saw a woman at the front door, looking hesitant. “Client,” he said, going back down the stairs to open the door. Just as the doorbell rang, Harry opened the door and invited the client inside.
"See you later Dad, John," he said while hugging them. Then he sprinted back to meet up with the other kids. They were led into a large, colourful classroom and the day began.
Harry received a new chemistry set from Sherlock, three books on solving crime from John, several books on magic from Hermione, a large amount of sweets and chocolate from Fred and George, and an enchanted crystal magnifying glass from Draco.
“She came home one day to find her fiance dead on the floor. There were no signs of forced entry and no obvious causes of death. Also ‘The Boy Who Lived Shall Die’ was written on the wall.” Harry gulped. Hermione paled slightly. Sherlock looked at them questioningly, but they both shrugged.
“It was at this point we realised we were slightly out of our depth. As Sherlock silently investigated the house, I texted Mycroft, who in turn informed the magical section of the government of our location. Less than a minute later, Sherlock and I were joined by two others, aurors I believe they were called.
Draco came into the room first, already fully dressed, but without his hair slicked back. It was the first time Harry had seen him without copious amounts of gel in his hair. Harry reckoned he looked a lot better without it. Draco looked at himself in the mirror above the fireplace and sighed.
"Uh, okay then," said Hagrid, awkwardly shoving the sausages back into his coat. Mycroft didn't look overly happy at the unhygienic food handling but didn't comment. "I'll follow you."
Harry yawned and got up, grabbing a dressing gown as he left the room. He felt like he was in a hotel, there was nothing personal or homely about Mycroft's house. It was strangely sterile even though there was nothing that wasn't a priceless artefact that was at least a hundred years old.
"A sleeping potion so powerful it is known as the Draught of Living Death." Snape looked disappointed.
“So, what happened with the case?” he asked. John sat down in his chair and got ready to tell a story.
Standing at the top of the steps was a stern-looking woman wearing emerald green robes that reached the floor. Her dark hair was in a tight bun at the top of her head and she looked very impatient.
"They used to be. They once controlled the ministry, then they died out, or so we thought. Their fortune is yours now, Harry," said Griphook. Then the goblin whistled and a small cart came along the tracks in the ground.
"Sleep now," Sherlock said softly. The boy happily complied, falling into a deep slumber within minutes. Sherlock then brought out his phone and dialled a number.
“We’re going to the scene. It’s a murder. Do you want to come?” John asked. Harry nodded and grabbed his gun from under his mattress. He put on his holster and covered it with a hoodie.
"Who are you?" asked Sherlock. His voice and hands were shaking. "You're trespassing on private property. I will warn you, I am armed!"
Mrs Hudson, the landlady, was very nice to Harry, constantly giving him sweets and hugs. Harry found it a bit annoying, but put up with it. The toffee was worth it. Sherlock went to the Hospital alone that day, Mrs Hudson agreed to look after Harry on the condition that she would not become a nanny for him. Sherlock smiled, nodded, and left.
“We missed you too,” said John as they let go. “Who’re your friends?” Harry quickly introduced each of them. Fred and George stared at Sherlock in awe.
Everyone finished singing at different times. At last, only a set of red-headed twins were left, singing a slow, funeral march. Dumbledore conducted the last few lines with his wins, then once the twins were finished, he was the one who clapped the loudest.
Investigations continue into the break-in at Gringotts on 31 July, widely believed to be the work of dark wizards or witches unknown.
"I'll be off then. I do not want to anger my father. I'll write to you," he said. Harry waved goodbye as Draco walked towards a blond couple. They looked happy to see him, though his father scolded him slightly.
A while later, it was declared that breakfast was over and that all students should begin making their way to class. Draco and Harry said goodbye to Hermione and began walking towards their first class.
"All of it. I was just around the corner." John and Sherlock quickly stood up and enveloped the boy in a warm hug. "I'm fine," he said, pulling away. "I don't really care what that guy says." He was lying and everyone knew it, but they let go anyway.
Finally, after a month of inspections and questions, it was the day of Harry's adoption. The process leading up to this would usually take around six months, but Mycroft had pulled some strings to make it go faster.
Harry had never seen such an incredible place. It was lit with hundreds of candles, floating high above the heads of the students. Harry looked at them in awe, then saw the ceiling. There must have been some sort of enchantment to make it look exactly like the night sky. Harry could see every star, every constitution, every little detail.
While this was happening, Sherlock was working frantically to get the paperwork complete to finally adopt Harry. Many council workers had come over to inspect the flat, all saying that it was adequate but small. Sherlock would assure them that he was looking for a new place to live. Sherlock hated the people and the intrusions that they provided. A few had given him stern looks when Harry had gone up to them and told them everything about them. One of the many ways the two were similar was their lack of filter.
"Well, there was this one crazy case where these guys came in claiming that their comic books were coming true-" Harry launched into the story of what John had dubbed 'The Geek Interpreter'. While there was very little illegal activity and no dead bodies, it had been a most interesting case.
The giant ma stepped through the doorway and looked at the ruined door sadly. He picked up the two pieces and placed them back in the doorway. Then he muttered something under his breath and pointed the pink umbrella he was holding at the door. Suddenly, the door looked brand new. Sherlock and John gasped. Harry smiled slightly. So magic was real, he thought to himself.
"The Dursleys were deemed unfit to look after me. I'm fairly sure they lost custody of my cousin as well."
The next day, Harry woke at around midday. Sherlock and John had already left for their honeymoon. His suit was lying crumpled on the floor where he had left it last night. He picked it up and hung it back in his wardrobe, then he went to the living room and watched TV with a bowl of Coco Pops.
After the thirteenth suspicious death surrounding this vault, no one dares use it. It remained empty for decades, until Nicolas Flamel decided he would try to break its supposed curse. Though no one knows what he put in there, many have theorised that it holds the-
"If you are an example of the average wizard in your society, then it is not one that I wish my nephew to join," said Mycroft, his voice laden with hate. Hagrid hung his head in shame but did nothing to defend himself or other wizards.
“EXPELLIARMUS!” yelled Harry, pointing his wand at the startled headmaster. The wand flew from Dumbledore’s hand and Harry caught it, shoving it in his pocket before running to the headmaster and shoving him into the wall.
Sherlock was silent for a moment. "Well," he said finally, "if you want, you could become Harry Holmes. You could become my son." Harry contemplated this for a second, then nodded.
They were particularly bad one Wednesday morning, the same morning that Malfoy decided to talk to him.
The second they arrived, school began, and Harry almost forgot he was in a magical place. Though the term had only just begun, teachers gave out more work than Harry had ever had to do in his whole life. He had never had a formal class before, and decided a few minutes after the first one started that he was pretty glad he had been homeschooled.
“Alright, but my dads are gonna be asleep for the rest of the day, so we’ll have to go alone,” said Harry as he picked up his wallet. Mycroft had been giving him over a hundred pounds every month since he’d been adopted, but hadn’t given him access until only a few months before. He also grabbed his bag full of wizarding money in case they went to Diagon Alley.
"Here's your post," she said as she threw a pile of envelopes onto the sofa. Harry thanked her and picked up the pile. He skipped through all the congratulatory letters from friends that couldn't make the wedding and all the bills. All that was left was a thick, yellow envelope that smelled faintly of lemon. The envelope was sealed with a wax insignia. A badger, an eagle, a snake, and a lion curled around an H. He flipped it over and in neat, green cursive, his name and address were written.
"I need answers as soon as possible, and I knew someone who will hopefully give me some," he replied. Draco looked at him oddly, but Hermione smiled. There was little more exciting than a mystery.
"I'm gonna go back to the room," said Harry. John and Sherlock nodded and said they'd see him later, then the doors closed and Harry immediately started to shake uncontrollably.
An hour later, he was halfway through the book and had a rather in-depth knowledge of occulemency and legilimency. It took a few more hours for him to fully understand every aspect of it. He got out several books so that he could begin learning occulemency that night.
Harry and Draco sat down at the empty end of the Slytherin table, perfectly happy to only talk to one another. Harry looked at the coffee-free table in front of him in dismay. Already he was feeling tired. He pushed the thoughts of caffeine aside and instead looked over at the Ravenclaw table. Hermione was sitting alone and not looking overly happy about it. Harry waved at her. She came over immediately and sat opposite Draco and Harry. A few Slytherins glared at the new addition to the table, and Draco looked slightly uncomfortable, but Harry immediately struck up a conversation. All three of them grabbed some breakfast and began to talk.
Malfoy swaggered forward when his name was called and got his wish at once: the hat had barely touched his head when it screamed, "SLYTHERIN!"
"The Chocolate Frog card," Harry whispered, finally remembering where he had seen Flamel's name before. "Here you go. I have to go." He dropped the ball in Neville's hand and sprinted down the hall, back down to the common rooms.
"Good morning, Harry," said Sherlock as the young boy woke. There was a flicker of panic in the boy's face when he couldn't recognize anything, then he looked at Sherlock and relaxed.
A few minutes later the two boys were standing back on the street, their new robes wrapped up in paper. They ran around Diagon Alley, buying all their school stuff while avoiding Draco's parents.
"So find someone who is." He was getting agitated. Molly nodded and called some people. Soon there were nurses all around the bed. Harry was starting to get afraid. All these unknown people and unknown environments were making him nervous. Upon seeing his discomfort, Sherlock held his hand. This had the desired effect and Harry relaxed.
'But we're not telling you what was in there, so keep your noses out if you know what's good for you,' said a Gringotts spokesgoblin this afternoon.
"Sorry," they said in an odd accent as they continued walking. Harry said nothing and forgot all about them as he stepped into the owl shop.
Harry led her up the stairs into the lounge. Fred, George, Hermione, and Draco were all standing just outside the door, trying to be inconspicuous.
Finally, the day arrived and Harry was able to go home. He practically sprinted to the train, his friends following close behind.
"Good morning, Dad, Dad," he said. They didn't say anything, both too tired to think straight. He turned all the lights on and left. The two men groaned and got up.
"Well then, I think we should wake up Hagrid and give our guest some breakfast," Mycroft said, leading Harry into the sitting room where Hagrid was snoring. "Excuse me, sir," said Mycroft softly. The giant man stopped snoring and opened his eyes slightly. His face was filled with confusion, then his beetle-black eyes settled on Harry and smiled.
"He also wanted to send me back to the Dursleys, the people that starved me and locked me in a cupboard when I was three," said Harry. Fred and George looked at him in disbelief, but Draco only shook his head, disappointed.
"And finally, I must tell you that this year, the third-floor corridor on the right-hand side is out of bounds to everyone who does not wish to die a very painful death." Dumbledore wasn't joking. Harry stared out him. Who the hell says that going into a corridor will kill you? Was it locked? Why were there deadly things in a school?
When the train pulled into Hogsmead station, the sun had set and the night was beginning to cool down. Students were rushing onto the platform, glad to be out of the confinements of the train. Harry and Hermione were so wrapped up in their discussions they didn't even notice until Draco clapped loudly to get their attention.
"If you're not an uncle, then what should I call you?" asked Harry. Sherlock thought for a moment, then said,
"Cool," said Harry, examining the remains of the vase. He looked at his fathers. "Can I go?" he asked.
"Your father, on the other hand, favoured a mahogany wand. Eleven inches. Pliable. A little more power and excellent for transfiguration. Well, I say your father favoured it – it’s really the wand that chooses the wizard, of course."
“We’re literally at the station already,” replied Harry. Just as the words left his mouth, the train slowed to a stop. Fred and George cheered and leapt onto the platform. The other three were quick to follow, dragging their trunks behind them. Hedwig was already at the flat, having flown there to drop off a letter and needing no reason to return, so her empty cage had been shrunk down and shoved inside Harry’s trunk.
Three days later, it was Christmas. Everyone, aside from Sherlock and John, were up bright and early, earlier than they would even get up for school. They waited for Sherlock and John by watching TV, something that utterly fascinated Draco, Fred, and George.
John eyed it warily. "I think I'll stay up here, if that's alright." Everyone else nodded and climbed in. The second they were seated, the cart trundled off into the dark cave, leaving John behind.
“Why can’t you take a hint, Malfoy?! Just piss off and leave me and my friends alone! God, I hate you so much. Piss the fuck off!” Harry realised a moment too late that he’d been telling. Hundreds of eyes burned into his back as he glared at Malfoy.
“This was one of the first things we learnt in History of Magic this year,” said Hermione indignantly.
He woke up an hour or so later, John sitting beside him worriedly while Sherlock read the case against Dumbledore.
Draco must've seen his face as he began talking all about what he hoped would happen at school. Harry was glad for the distraction and the two of them talked until all meals were finished and desert had come and gone. There was a ghost hovering over the pair for most of the meal. He was covered in silver blood and chains, but he didn't say anything, just watched with cold, dead eyes.
Sherlock sighed. If a child was going to live there, it would need to be cleaned up. He began tidying and soon found a rhythm.  Only an hour later, the flat was cleaner than he'd ever seen it. Sherlock sat cross-legged on the bed, pleased with his work. He had never been a huge fan of children but raising one of his own excited him. He would teach Harry everything he knew. New experiences were rare, and life was short.
“I reckon Ron’ll quite like this,” said Fred, holding up a maroon hoodie. “It’ll be a nice change from his regular gifts.” George burst out laughing, and the rest of them could do nothing but join him.
"Heads down!" yelled Hagrid as the first boats reached the cliff. Everyone bent their heads and were carried through a curtain of ivy which hid a large opening in the cliff. They floated through a dark tunnel that seemed to take them right underneath the castle.
"HUFFLEPUFF!" shouted the hat. The table on the right cheered and clapped as Hannah went to sit down at the Hufflepuff table. Harry saw the ghost of the Fat Friar waving merrily at her.
Around an hour later, the bell went and Harry went off to his next class, trying his best to avoid other people. The news of his identity had travelled like wildfire and he was met with someone wanting to see him at almost every corner. Everywhere he went he was followed by whispers and pointing fingers. He was glad for the distraction that work provided, but he knew he had made the wrong decision when it came to Snape. Maybe it had been a mistake to come to Hogwarts at all. The house system didn't seem too smart, as teachers had favourites. The whole school had something off about it, but maybe it was just all the antiques giving Harry the creeps.
"We'll start with your uniform. Madam Malkin's it right over there, but I think I might get a drink. I'm not the biggest fan of those carts," said McGonagall. Harry nodded and the witch walked off. Sherlock and John followed her, leaving Harry alone in the street. He smiled, the money bag heavy in his pocket as he raced over to the shop.
"DAD! DAD!" he yelled. Sherlock and John sprinted into the room, then stopped when they saw the letters. John grabbed Harry's arm and pulled him out of the room.
Once she had disappeared from Harry's view, he left the owlery. Distracted by thoughts of the third-floor corridor, he didn't notice a fellow student running towards him. He collided with a very puffed Neville Longbottom and they both hit the floor.
The ornate rug in the landing was scratchy and kind of ugly. Harry wasn't a big fan of old-fashioned things like castles or oil paintings. He liked learning about them, but seeing them in real life was weird. They had been made by people long dead. It just made him uncomfortable. Especially the suits of armour.
A few minutes later, John and Sherlock came down, hand in hand. They each grabbed a plate of toast and a cup of coffee.
The tables were laden with breakfast foods and drinks. Harry saw a pot of coffee and was pleased to find it was actually not instant. He poured himself a cup, then piled his plate high with pancakes and waffles, then drowned them in syrup. He also grabbed a glass of orange juice then sat in an empty table in the back corner of the room.
They arrived back at 221b at around 8. It had taken a long time to convince Harry to leave when the aquarium closed. There was an unexpected guest in the flat. A short man with grey, close-cropped hair, and the way he held himself showed he was a military man. At that moment, he was quite out of breath.
Four hours later, Sherlock and John made their way up the stairs to the flat, holding hands. Both of them were more than a little drunk. The stumbled through the hallway and into Sherlock's room. They then collapsed on the bed and passes out.
"He's our son," he said, his voice breaking. He collapsed into Sherlock's arms and Mycroft stepped away, offering Hagrid his hand. Hagrid shook his head and slowly got to his feet, backing away from the couple in front of him.
The common room was pretty empty, only a few older students were hanging around. The giant squid was visible in the lake. Harry looked at it for only a few seconds before walking out of the common room and into the dungeon hallway. He pulled his robes tighter around him, glad that the uniform was well-suited for living in a castle.
Even with this position, there was little he discovered about Harry Potter. All he could find out about was that his parents, James Potter and Lily Evans, died in mysterious circumstances in a place called Godric's Hollow. There was no record of them going to school or having jobs.
"I've seen it all, dear Harry. All aside from an intelligent Griffindor," he replied, sending a dirty look towards the loud students in red behind them. They were shoving each other and yelling as they made their way towards awaiting carriages drawn by black, skeletal horses with wings.
When they finally arrived, Harry and Hermione practically leapt out of the cab, followed closely by Sherlock and the client.
"I think Hogwarts will do," said Harry. "It's much closer to home." If anyone had an issue with Harry's decision, they didn't make themselves known.
He walked to his dorm, annoyed about how little he had found out. For some reason, Flamel didn't show up in Modern Alchemy: Everything You Need To Know, or in The Greatest Discoveries in 20th Century Alchemy. A few of the books had mentioned him, but never saying anything more than his name.
“What have you done?” Harry turned and looked at Professor M, standing next to Sherlock, John, Mycroft, Lestrade, and Draco.
i doubt anyone here was seriously invested, as slowly they story has gotten worse and less believable (the most in character part taken from the bbc sherlock series)
"My father reckons he's off his rocker, but I think he's pretty okay. He's let a few too many mudbloods-" Harry looked at him, disappointed, "-sorry. He's pretty okay, but apparently very slack when it comes to rules," finished Draco, looking slightly guilty.
"Canticum," he whispered, the runes on his wand glowing gold. A soft melody started, the sound not seeming to come from anywhere in particular. Harry recognized it as the national anthem and began humming along. The dog's eyes began to droop closed and it slowly lowered itself to the ground. Harry kept the spell going as the two boys edged around the massive canine.
Ten minutes later, the nurses left, leaving Harry with a small meal, a drip, and a heart monitor beeping steadily. Sherlock was still sitting next to him, a slight look of worry on his usually emotionless face. Molly was just about to leave when Sherlock turned to her.
“Who made you do it?” Harry knelt beside the wizard’s head, his voice calm, but anger etched on his every feature. Dumbledore said nothing, now looking afraid. “Who made you do it?!” asked Harry again, louder this time. Dumbledore flinched as Harry moved closer, but still didn’t answer. Harry jammed his knee into Dumbledore’s ribs.
"Wait up!" called Draco as he and Harry took off after her. Fred and George exchanged a look before following.
"I am Professor Snape. You are here to learn the subtle science and exact art of potion-making," he began. He had the ability to capture the full attention of every student in the room without even trying. "As there is little foolish wand-waving here, many of you will hardly believe this is magic. I don't expect you will really understand the beauty of the softly simmering cauldron with its shimmering fumes, the delicate power of liquids that creep through human veins, bewitching the mind, ensnaring the senses ... I can teach you how to bottle fame, brew glory, even stopper death – if you aren't as big a bunch of dunderheads as I usually have to teach."
"Hello, Harry. This is John Watson. He might be staying with us soon." Harry nodded and turned to John.
“Nothing,” replied Harry, inspecting the footprints. “Three days old, size eight, uk, around 170 cm tall, and-” he picked something up off the ground- “shoulder length hair, ginger. And, judging by the footprints, we have a wizard on our hands.” Sherlock swore.
Harry checked his pocket for Dumbledore’s wand countless times over the course of the day, not trusting that the headmaster would be unable to get it back. He considered breaking it a couple times, but couldn’t remember if it was legal or not. Eventually, he decided against it and just kept the wand in his hand.
The month leading up to his the first day of Hogwarts was spent reading and memorising all of the books Harry had bought. Using what he had learnt about wandlore, Harry had taken his pocket knife and carefully engraved the wooden surface with protective wards so that people couldn't steal it, he couldn't lose it, and he couldn't be disarmed. He also made sure that it wouldn't be broken, but to work properly, the runes would need a specific spell to be cast, and Harry knew it was illegal for underage witches and wizards to use magic outside of school.
“Draco!” he yelled. The blond turned, and was shocked when Harry ran into him, holding him in a tight embrace. “I’m so sorry for everything I said. My memories were all messed up. I thought you hated me.”
He slowed only when he reached the library, carefully reading the spines of each book he walked past before coming to a stop at Madam Pince's desk.
"You're pretty cool," said Draco. Harry smiled at him, then began looking for anything that could indicate a secret. He found one pretty quickly. Half-covered by the dog's massive body was a trapdoor. Draco and Harry tried to push the dog off, but it was too heavy.
“I didn't mean about Moran. I meant…you.” She paused for a moment as if uncertain as to whether to continue, but then pressed on. “I had a friend on the force once, when I was younger, a good friend. We both were just out of Hendon. Graduated together. Seemed fine at first; everything you do is exciting when you first start."
He is relieved that his argument seems to shrivel the spluttering about a lack of openness, and they can get on with the other points on the agenda.
"No, just getting a result faster than your forensic lot ever could." He watches as Steiner's laptop comes to life. "Who logged in last and when?"
He uses the syringe needle to drop the cotton filter at the very edge of the spoon. It's a medical grade IDUSF; too many addicts use cigarette filters, which eliminate less than half of all particles above 10 micron. He draws the drug into his sterile syringe slowly, making sure that he compensates for the amount that will be absorbed by the filter. A quick tap to release bubbles, a flick to cast off the tiny drip of fluid at the tip of the needle and he's ready.
Sherlock's own digging, those hours locked away at Montague Street had turned up something that Mycroft's minions had missed. On the day that Moran had graduated from Sandhurst as an officer, Jim Moriarty had been defending his dissertation at Trinity College in Dublin.
still ringing in his ears. What did he expect? Moriarty would have found a way to get to any of the undecided jurors. The echo of that final verdict is erased by the braying questions being shouted by the journalists clustered at the edge of the pavement.
"Um… noted?" Edgar suggests, taking turns to side-eye both Sherlock and John, unsure who to address. He rises to his feet slowly, as though expecting permission. "Sherlock? Um… Mister Holmes?"
questions, the ones that lit up Sherlock's mind and allowed him to find the answers that had eluded them both.
You consider whether it’s worth heading off to the Tesco Metro to buy another bottle of whisky. The predecessor bottle had gone in the bin, too, emptied too quickly over the past few days. Hating yourself for the desperate need to drink yourself into oblivion, you argue with yourself, throwing the memory of your father and sister's drinking in front of the wallet that sits on the table, promising a way to stop what is going on in your head. You've woken up too many mornings with a hangover to know that this is going to be a long-term solution. If you want to end it, then there are better ways of killing yourself.
"He's not the only one whose opinions you'll have to face. I doubt Anderson will be happy about you slipping off, leaving him having to do all the simple cases — I agree that King's can't probably afford to put you on anything but stuff like your posterior fossa stuff if you're only here for three days a week."
Sherlock is still tense; John can feel the muscles under his fingers are taut. In the dark, he wants to be reassuring but knows that there are more things Sherlock needs to vent before he will be able to relax. "What's really bothering you?"
Sherlock takes a moment or two to put his thoughts in order. This conversation is still not going that way he wants it to. He doesn't feel as though John is helping him make a sound, informed decision based on facts, just trying to shoot the whole thing down. "You seem to be implying that I would have a problem?"
There is sound above. For a moment, I am unsure whether it is coming from the phone or not. Then, the blue in front of my goggled eyes seems to turn whiter.
There it is in a nutshell. How can Sherlock possibly explain how he interacts with the Head of Neurosurgery? "Um… in what way? Obviously, one could say that he is the equivalent of my line manager."
Jim rounds on him in instant. “Excuse me?” his words icy cold and his eyes completely black pinning Sebastian to the spot.
Watson had been delighted at Sebastian's capture. "Red-handed," he had crowed to the copper who showed up to arrest him. "Red-faced, too; now how does it feel, Mister oh-so-superior Moran, to have a lowly former army doctor get the drop on someone like you? All that training and you still got caught."
John picked up a pillow from the arm chair by the bedroom door and threw it at the surprised, very naked man standing next to the bed after scrambling up and away from Mary. The man's expression was a curious sort of defiant panic as he used the pillow to cover his withering genitals.
I don't need to be fluent in French to understand that comment, and I nod before running to catch up with my husband.
Jules' mother speaks up. "It's impossible to predict what'll happen in the future, and people tend to assume that if someone's ASD, then they won't be able to cope with much of anything. All those old books and movies and maybe some kid that someone's grandparents knew who didn't even talk — all that made people shove these kids away and assume that trying to get them to manage like the rest of us is just too much hassle for a very uncertain result." She nods towards Moses' mother. "They think that it's not
your alone time while we’re gone. No paperwork. Watch something brain-rotting on the telly. You like that.” Sherlock smirks as he walks to collect his coat and scarf from the hook, narrowly avoiding the towel snapped at him. The sound of John’s laughter lights him up from the inside.
The fragments are dissipating, the way dreams do, tendrils of memory that thin out and disappear even as you reach for them. What the dream means and who said those words to you escapes you now; leaving only the thought that the moment of agony felt so real, the way that nightmares do.
Taking a deep breath, he scrawled the word next to the corresponding numbers on the paper and flipped quickly to page 70, counting and cursing aloud when he lost track and had to start over.
Objectively, John doesn't need to be there. So why does the thought still feel so insurmountably impossible to accept?
"Four years, now." Pride swells in John as he recalls their wedding day. It was a rush job, really, since they wanted to do it before leaving for Malosa, but it was still lovely. Even Violet Holmes had seemed to relax and enjoy the day; possibly because she was happy that Sherlock had found someone who would, in her world view, take over her duties of managing her younger son.
Sherlock grunts as he uses his cuffed hands to push himself back into an upright position. He has to keep hammering away at this. Gasping through his pain, he draws a couple of deep breaths before he spits out “Useful until he wasn’t — so you got rid of Jim, did you? He'd outlived his
As relief floods into him, John battles with other sensations. The dim light, the earthen floor, the stench of blood, vomit and urine, the sight of Sherlock slowly, painfully levering himself up on an elbow. For a moment, John’s legs start to give way under him, and he stumbles, but then he’s back up and over at Sherlock’s side, laying his gun on the floor and crouching down beside him.
Sir Edgar is not amused. "Tell that to our American friends. I gather, Holmes, that they are none too happy with this situation."
Nowadays, nothing and no one seems able to propel you into motion. Walking is no longer a synchronisation of yourself with him. It's no longer a prescription for setting aside annoyances and resolving your differences, leading you back to him. Walking has no meaning anymore. Sometimes, when the ache in your leg reminds you of the time you needed a crutch, it's positively painful. You try to ignore it; it's only transport.
He strokes the glove down Sebastian’s face one more time and then spins away, grinning. “And this duel. It's not about guns. It's about brains, not bullets. The death? The drama? Wouldn't miss it for the world, Tiger."
"Ebay it is," he announced. "Got to remember to tell whoever buys it to bring something to haul it out with."
The Coroner presses on. "In your opinion, is the volume of blood found at the scene consistent with a fatal wound?”
"We might see Sherlock on the black run;" he points out as we wait to board the six-seater, "keep your eyes peeled. The red run is nearest to our route but another fifty meters to the north, we will be able to catch occasional glimpses of the black run."
Soon, the man and the wagon were gone, and the heavy rectangle box was in the middle of the downstairs foyer.
When it's my turn, I keep it short: "Holmes, surgeon from England. I did off piste at Pischa and Rinerhorn last year at Davos."
Gasping at the order, Sebastian can only hang on, knowing that if he comes before Jim, then the boundary between pleasure and pain will be well and truly crossed.
Mycroft tuts, "Patience, brother mine. At least the new six-seater chairlift to La Chaux is in operation now."
“I was at school for three years and learned ballroom dancing for one term per year. It beat football or rugby any day.”
Whatever ideas I had about a quick march to the super king-sized bed, that was not his plan. "More heat and massage; your shoulder is still tight as a coiled spring. This will help and keep you from waking me up at night with tossing and turning and then padding off to knock back an ibuprofen."
" He says this quietly as if someone might overhear him admitting to having an unlicensed illegal weapon in the house. "It's just not on. And damages? Let's talk about those. Who put that scratch across the kitchen table? Who put the scorch marks on the ceiling? Who put acid down the sink without checking whether the pipework was plastic rather than metal?"
, Sherlock interprets. For what part of what he's just told his husband, he is not certain. His first instinct is to flee the conversation, but he reminds himself that he's done nothing wrong. He's had an offer, that's all. One on which he wants John's input.
John sighs. Terry has been a brick for helping out at short notice in the past, so he can hardly blame the guy for this occasion. "Well, I'll have to keep looking. Have fun."
Mike is looking at him with growing alarm and reaches out to lay a hand—soft, comforting fingers on his arm. “Look, don’t get me wrong, I’m not saying he’s alive, just that there may have been another way for this to have happened. You need a professional opinion, not my guesswork.” He looks down at his watch and then back up at John. “Look, sorry about this, but I have to go; that consult won't wait forever.” Then he gets out a pen and hastily scribbles a name and a phone number on the back of report. "Here, give Mary a call, she’s an A&E consultant, so she should be able to tell you if it really is possible and what the mechanics would be. She’s pretty busy but usually responds to a text quite quickly.”
Suspension of disbelief alerts: 1. I wished the coffee shop into existence for this fic, and unwished it again at the end. It doesn't exist and couldn't afford this neighborhood if it did. 2. I drew on Shiny Sherlock's invaluable "Sherlock Series 4 Timeline, or, 'It is what it is'" (https://archiveofourown.org/works/9411503). In canon the dates are blurry, but I'm setting this in February 2016 and calling it six months after TLD (TFP does not exist).
Still gripped by an overwhelming mixture of seething anger and crushing resignation, it takes Sherlock a moment to realise silence has descended.
"Third floor, follow the signs for the Koala Ward and turn left at vending machines. You can't miss the new signs from there."
Here it is. The moment he has dreaded. If he wants this project to work, then he is going to have to be honest about his conditions, even if they don't fall into the usual category that these people are used to dealing with.
of him, so he's decamped back to his old one at the top—reached by another set of steps, which also have their own catalogue of creaks and groans.  John stares at the ceiling, waiting for… something,
Dr Pichler takes time to consider this, biting her lip. Eventually, she nods and says, "Will this new unit affect your research if you turn the position down?"
The sight of a skier face-down in the snow, unmoving, is enough to sound an alarm in my head, so I change my angle to make my way to him. Even with a helmet, concussions and head injuries happen, and spinal injuries are not uncommon. As I ski across to where he is lying, I try to re-play the crash. The guy had thrown out an arm when he landed on his shoulder, a stupid way to try to break his fall onto the first mogul, that means he's probably going to have broken some bones — an arm, elbow or shoulder most likely. If he's lucky, maybe only a collarbone.
Within a couple of months, you'd grown used to seeing it, so much so that it became a sort of East Dulwich wallpaper that you no longer notice.
“Why you?" He queries. "What makes you so special?" Why a mid-level software engineer, with a penchant for high profile gay bars but a desire to keep that side of yourself up your sleeve so to speak. Why were you chosen to deliver a message wrapped in a kilo and a half of Semtex? No one of consequence, just another run of the mill victim ... "
It’s in Mrs Hudson’s writing. He vaguely remembers Sherlock ordering Chinese takeaway from the Peking Palace; that had been right after Lestrade’s first visit, before the DI had returned with a warrant for Sherlock’s arrest. That must have been before John had told Sherlock that nobody but him could be such an annoying dick all the time.
Placing the palms of his hands on the cool surface of the double glazing and leaning forward towards the window, he drops his head. His neck hangs loosely from his shoulders as he sways back and forth in time to the title line.
As he reaches for his cup, Janine looks up with a coy smile. "Like your women hot, too?" There is enough obvious innuendo in her tone of voice to make him realise that she is giving this a sexual connotation, enough to dispel his initial confusion over why a woman's body temperature would make any difference to their appeal.
As the firemen move up the building, he can hear them shouting and banging on the doors, to see if there are any residents left at risk. Even now, they will have realised that the smoke is thinning. The cannisters would be finished in less than a minute now. Sherlock knows fire protocols; they won't let the residents back in until they try to discover the cause of the smoke. Collecting the empty cannisters from the roof, he drops onto the balcony of the penthouse flat, knowing that his action will have triggered an alarm but also knowing that the firemen below won't let Moran in, even if he does return to Royalty Mews. He should have sufficient time to do what he needs to do.
He briefly wonders what a disney is—something he’s deleted?—before returning to the reason for his call. “While you’re waiting, I wondered if you meant it about wanting to learn how to dance. I could teach you.”
“I was certainly surprised when you called. Didn’t think I’d hear from you the rest of the day. You looked such a fright when you left.”
There’s an open wound now, where the needle dragged as Moran tore it out. A trickle of blood is forming along the scratch line, a reopening of the incision made when the message was carved into his flesh. It’s painful, but a mere irritation in comparison to the world of pressure currently exerting itself on his chest cavity. His neck hurts, a pain that radiates down his arm. The stench in his prison makes him nauseated. He's both sweating and yet cold at the same time. And tired, so very, very tired. If Sherlock had the energy to roll his eyes in exasperation, he would
"Morning to you, too," John jokes. "No, I stocked up on paracetamol and ibuprofen last week, and I've got enough oxy here until Monday." He lifts an envelope out of his overnight bag.
John was quite sure that if Mycroft so much as said hello, he would break the man's nose. It might be satisfying, but would likely make John's night as unpleasant as his day had been. Not worth it.
The first time he and Victor had gone to the dance club Heaven in London had been a revelation. The music possessed him and having Victor there to share it stripped them of their inhibitions. If they had not danced first, Sherlock would never have had the courage to make love to him. Their love had been one long dance, until the music stopped and Sherlock fell apart.
She moves her eyes from the jurors to the public seating. "I call the first witness of today, Doctor John Watson."
There is a bang and the hiss of compressed gas right next to my ears—the avalanche air bag sensor has gone off and inflates around the back of my neck and head, designed to keep me above the snow. For a moment, it seems to act as a brake on the snow's downward drag on my body. The powder clears from my goggles and I see daylight for a moment, giving me hope that this is the worst it's going to get.
When the proprietor reappears, a few minutes later, it is with a cup in his hand—strong, spiced coffee, with the kick of espresso. Without sugar, it is bitter to the tongue—the taste of death or other sorrow, rather than the sweetened blend served at Moroccan weddings or betrothals. Given current circumstances, it seems the appropriate choice.
“Sorry. Old habits die hard and all that,” said Draco, running a hand through his hair. “Anyways, meet back here in an hour?” Everyone nodded and departed, all looking for the perfect presents for their friends.
Mr Ollivander moved closer to Harry. Harry wished he would blink. Those silvery eyes were a bit creepy.
Harry looked at it suspiciously, then carefully inspected it. He could see no signs that it was dangerous, but he didn't want to take any chances. Going into the kitchen, he grabbed his chemistry safety gear that he never used and pulled on some thick rubber gloves and safety goggles. He carefully broke the seal on the envelope and tipped the contents into his hand. Nothing bad happened, so he unfolded the letter and began to read it.
"How long until I can go home with you?" He asked. Sherlock picked up the diagnostics sheet and read over it. While Harry was still malnourished, there was no reason for him to stay in the hospital much longer. Sherlock was planning to pick up the stuff from IKEA later that day, but he saw no reason why he couldn't go earlier.
"This place is quite small. Don't you want your own room?" Harry nodded. "I'm going down to the hospital today. I need to do some experiments. You're welcome to come, but you'll have to stay with Molly." Sherlock may have no issue with Harry solving crimes, but he would prefer it if the boy stayed away from the morgue for another few years. Harry agreed to come and they got ready to leave.
"Freak!" He heard someone yell on the other side of the door. The name made him shudder. Freak was a name he was only too used to. "You can't do anything! Stupid child!" This confirmed Sherlock's suspicions, the Dursley's would never speak to their son that way. That meant there was another child in the house. He knocked on the door.
John was curled up in a ball on the floor, blood pooling around him. I screamed, terrified he was dead. I knelt down and felt his pulse, breathing a sigh relief when I found one. It was weak though.
"Go ahead. I hope you can get more done than we will be able to." I muttered. She thanked me and I walked back over to John. "Sorry. I hope you don't mind, we are going to be very busy with Mary and her murder spree so I let Mrs. Hudson plan."
"What are you doing here, John?" I bit out harshly. His blue eyes filled with tears and I almost felt bad. I shook the thought away.
"I'm so sorry John. I know you say you were glad you ran into Mike but I wish you hadn't. If you hadn't run into him that day, you wouldn't be... you wouldn't be... here now, lying dead in a hospital. I am so sorry." I choked out. I couldn't believe that this bright little ray of sunshine had been snuffed out. I tried everything in my willpower to prevent this from happening but it appears it didn't matter because he died anyway.
I moved over to examine the male. The hand marks were darker red, bruised just a bit. The cuts were thin so not too much blood loss and he was also wet. So he was also dumped in the water after being killed. He was cut while he was alive but he was choked first and died because of it.
"Why here. Let's relax in the room." he said picking me up bridal style and walking me back to our room. I chuckled as he collapsed onto the bed and then nuzzled into my neck, kissing me.
I didn't really know very many people but those I did know needed to be protected. I glanced up at Sherlock who was waiting for me. "Sorry did you ask me something?" He chuckled and shook his head.
"Just listen please." I nodded, shutting up. "My life was hell. I didn''t like anything. I went to a therapist everyday because I needed to get over the war but it never worked, yet I would do it anyways. My life had no meaning and then I bumped into Mike, and then I met you, and I was happy. I had a flat. I had another human being. I had danger and adventure. You saved me. I would have put a bullet through my brain long ago if it hadn't been for you. When you came back I was so happy because you killed me when you jumped. I didn't know what I was signing up for in the beginning but if I did, I still would have chosen to have this time with you because you complete me. I accept the danger that comes with your life becasue for you, I will do anything."
"I don't care what it's called right now. Anyway. There was a body in the morgue that looked a lot like mine and John needed to see a body when he turned the corner. Time was of the essence  and everyone needed to hurry. So they got the balloon out of the way and Molly threw a fake body from a few floors up so that it would land on the ground. John saw the body and our biker hit him, knocking him down so that he couldn't see what was going on. I then ran and grabbed some supplies, taking the spot of the body as everyone dumped stuff on me. Placed a bal under my armpit so that if he squeezed har denough for the pulse he wouldn't get one. When John got up he rushed towards the crowed gathered around my body while the others took the body around the building like clockwork. It was convincing and he actually saw my body."
"I should be the one apologizing. You hardly got any sleep because you thought I was dead and now that you'll finally be able to, you can't because I'm keeping you awake with nightmares. I'm sorry."
"So if you couldn't couldn't get that he was the murderer from everything above, that gave it away. But I did see that way after I said everything."
My eyes shot open and I lie there sobbing. I accidentally woke John up and he wrapped me in a hug. "Do you want to talk about it?" he asked. I shook my head, not trusting myself to speak. "I'm sorry Sherlock."
The sunlight filtered through the curtains and I groaned as I peeled my eyes open. This morning was just the same as any other morning for the past two years. It was going to be a dull day and I would probably end up back here doing the same thing before bed later today.
I grabbed the book and made my way over to the curly haired man. He pointed at sign that had a bunch of animals. "Spirit Totem Stones." I read aloud. Sherlock nodded and pointed at two specifically.
John rolled his eyes as he rolled off of me. "Please. Take a seat." he said offering Lestrade his chair. I sat up and John fell into my seat. We all just sat there in an awkward silence for a moment.
Sherlock stepped out of their bathroom with nothing but a towel wrapped around his waist. He smiled at John, his blue eyes glittering in the lamplight, as he slowly got dressed. He was being a tease and John knew he was doing it on purpose.
He wore the scarf but always seemed to be cold no matter what he was wearing. He looked exhausted and devestated. He knelt in front of it and began to cry. My heart broke into a million pieces. I couldn't bear the sight of him so broken and I knew it was because of me.
"Mary. Pleasure as always. Oh and I loved the way you decorated the bathroom with Mike. The poison was a nice touch." I said smiling coldly. Lestrade turned to me looking startled. Mycroft groaned coming to.
Mrs. Hudson got a new pair of slippers and a robe from Lestrade and Molly and she got new cooking utensils from Sherlock and I. Lestrade got an expensive watch from Sherlock and I. He got a new tellecom from Mrs. Hudson and a holiday to Paris from Molly. Molly got a brand new dress from Lestrade, a bunch of new makeup from Mrs. Hudson, and a new telly from Sherlock and I. We couldn't figure out what to get her so we decided on a new telly.
I shook my head, my chest aching. Please... don't die on me John... I love you too much and I couldn't live here if you were gone. Please, come back.
"John! Come here!" Sherlock yelled and sighing, I made my way over to him. "What do you notice?" he asked.
"I don't know whether to be upset that you tried to move on with another person or be happy that you loved me and chose me. Sorry." he chuckled.
"No one saw who it was though." I frowned at this then thought about everything I had seen before coming to a conclusion.
We were right next to each other and I pulled ahead at the last second, beating my brother who sat there stunned.
"Help. I need help now." I yelled at the top of my lungs. My eyes had filled with tears but I refused to cry in front of these people right now. "It's okay John. Everything is going to be okay." I whispered, smiling sadly. I leaned down and kissed his forehead. He smiled but it soon fell as his eyes fluttered closed.
"He said, 'we have an odd one for you. Meet me at Lauriston Gardens.' That's it." Sherlock nodded and stared out the window.
We stepped put of the black car, smiles on our faces, and new tattoos. "Thanks for going with me." Sherlock said quietly, rubbing the back of his neck.
"You brought shorts right?" He asked suddenly. I jumped, slightly startled. I thought he had been asleep.
Lestrade stood in the hallway, still wrapped in Mycroft's arms. I practically skipped over to him, barely containing my smile. Mycroft looked confused for a second before a look of understanding dawned on his features. He pulled away from Lestrade, making an excuse about needing the bathroom. Lestrade slowly turned towards me, slightly taken aback by my smile.
The door opens and I was vaguely aware of Mycroft entering the room. "I sense an inside joke." He said.] While John was distracted, I continues the game and crossed the finish line in first place.
Once we arrived at 221b Baker Street, I noticed John shivering. I waited until he finished knocking to pull him close to me, kissing him as I wrapped my scarf around his neck again.
I smiled and kissed his forehead. I then patted the bed and he crawled in next to me. "You know, my life was dull. I had fun on the cases and I didn't have to do drugs because the adrenaline rush felt the same. When you walked through the door that day I couldn't help but fall in love with the way you smiled when you talked. I could tell you liked danger because you missed the war and I realized that I loved everything about you." My mind went blank and I thought back to the dream I had earlier this morning about a child and I smiled brightly. "You flipped my world around so quickly. Before I met you I needed either drugs or a case. After I met you I didn't need drugs when I didn''t have a case because everything you did made me smile. God it was so hard not to tell you how much I loved you. I thought you'd run the other way. You are my life John. I cannot live in a world where you aren't in it or where you don't love me becaue it hurt too much."
Stab wound to the abdomen, though very fine. So he was stabbed but it couldn't have been suicide otherwise there would have been a weapon. Person was here before he died he let them in but he wouldn't have allowed them to stay if he was taking a shower. So the person would have left and because of the lack of break-ins we can safely assume that the person who was here didn't murder them but that makes no sense.
I was so unbelievably happy when I realized John had loved me back. It wasn't until after I had faked my death that I found this out though. It was so hard seeing him break down everyday. I hated seeing him so broken and tired and it was even harder to stay in hiding when he yelled at me, saying how much he loved me and how much it hurt when I left him. I know he was yelling at me, cursing me, hating me but when he said I love you,I felt my heart swell.
"John just got discharged. He healed faster than they thought he would so they are letting him out today." I sighed in relief and stared out the window until we arrived at St. Bart's. I was in a good mood. I solved a murder and I get to go home today with John. My John.
The snow crunched under my boot and I silently cursed myself for being so loud but John didn't turn around. He reached into his pocket and pulled out a black box and my heart sank. John pulled out the ring making me feel even worse. I can't believe I left him alone.
I shook my head, thanking the cabbie and giving him some notes. I stood outside for a moment before unlocking the door. I stepped in and saw Mrs. Hudson coming down the stairs. She looked at me and then smacked me across the face. "What the hell were you thinking?" she asked angrily. I moved my hand up to my face and let the tears fall. She must have noticed this because her face softened.
I am really sorry about how crappy my case was. The horrible deductions and things of the sort. I apologize again.-Levi
I started laughing. "It's fine if we leave now Sherlock. Let me just pack a bag " he nodded and plopped down on to the couch, waiting for me to return.
We grabbed our bags and hailed a taxi, telling him the address of the store and asking if he could wait a moment.
"Yup."  the guy said popping the p. I rolled my eyes and grabbed the nearest thing and hit him upside the head, knocking him out. I stepped over his body and ran out the door, dialing Lestrade.
I sighed. I felt so stupid. How could I have not known but he did make it convincing enough. "Why?" Lestrade asked. Mrs. Hudson looked just as interested as I was. I knew that we were targeted but by whom and why?
will manage. As part of his deluge of questions for both of them at the start of their business relationship, Edgar had inquired whether he should only execute requests or also suggest improvements. John had seemed a bit reluctant regarding the latter, but Sherlock had readily agreed. Clearly, Edgar is capable of some out-of-the-box thinking regarding their daily routines and clearing their calendars for some alone time.
Then, just when he thinks he might actually voice that need, Jim pulls out, causing Sebastian to wince. Grimacing as he feels a warm trail of lube and come run down his leg, he steps back into his tracksuit and pulls it and his pants back up. The wound on his leg hurts like hell now; muscles tight against the car making the sliced flesh burn anew. Turning to make his way to the elevator, he's expecting Jim to follow but the Irishman, currently tucking himself neatly back into his trousers remains by the car.
The tablets are Elvanse — lisdexamphetamine. Sherlock's interest deflates as he deduces that Edgar is trying to put him at ease through countering his secret by revealing one of his own — a drug habit. Perhaps he assumes Sherlock being a doctor will ensure that confidence is kept? It makes sense. Many students and high-powered people abuse stimulants to keep on top of things, and Edgar's boundless energy and bordering-on-manic demeanour are easily explained with this.
"Recognise this?’ Moran saunters over to wave it in Sherlock’s face. “I liberated it from Watson's bedside table. When Moriarty is done with you, I am going to kill you with it and then frame Watson for your murder. You will be dead, he will end up behind bars, and when your brother descends like some avenging angel, I will ensure he suffers a total humiliation and exposure as a fraud. He'll never work for a government again, that is, if he can manage to avoid imprisonment for treason. For the man who likes to think of himself as the British Government, that's a fate worse than death."
"Nothing. You don't really need us to search for someone who lives here do you?" John asked. Lestrade shook his head and made to get up. His phone rang and he picked it up, making his way downstairs.
"You needed to fool John." he said matter-of-factly. How could he possibly know that? "You wear your heart on your sleeve Ros..."
He was the only thing keeping me alive for those two years. I hated that I had become so dependent on him but I couldn't help it. I needed him and if I lost him, I wouldn't be able to handle anything.
"If I must." he said sighing. I thanked him before quickly following Lestrade out to the cab. Once we arrived at the crime scene, I walked into the bathroom without a moment's hesitation.
"Can we just check put the gift shop really quick?" Sherlock nodded and pulled me put of the room. This was a really nice hotel. We passed the casino and went up the ramp o  the left, dodging people, before fi ally making it to the gift shop.
"Let me call Mycroft." Lestrade said, stepping out of the room. A few minutes later Mycroft was sitting in the chair and looking ridiculously bored.
I swallowed the lump that formed in my throat and took a step back, schooling my features. "What does it mean?" I asked, hoping I sounded curious. Why would she be coming back now? She didn't say anything after that night, up until now.
Mary was sitting on John's legs, pressing her body into his and kissing him but what hurt me the most was the fact that he was kissing her back just as passionately. She rocked her hips and he groaned, a smile stretching on his face. I stumbled backwards but the door was shut at some point after I entered.
"It's true. I do. Lestrade told me he would be here all day and I got bored so I decided to come along as well."
He layed down and rested his head in my lap. "What's going on?" I asked. He looked up at me through his bangs and my stomach twisted in knots.
"I say yes but will you? Will you marry me John Watson?" he asked. Molly started squealing as I nodded. I couldn't trust myself to speak because of how excited I was. He slid the ring on my finger with a huge smile on his face. I wrapped my arms around him and kissed him.
"Where is John?" I asked frustrated when he picked up. I slid out of the bed and hurriedly made my way over to the coat rack. I slid into my coat and began putting my shoes on as I waited for Mycrofts answer.
"No you don't. You came here to give us the files but Sherlock told you that we didn't want to take it no doubt because it was to hard for me." John said quickly. I was impressed with his deductions.
"Because I was worried sick. I spent half of my time worrying about tracking down the damn hunters so that you wouldn't be killed when I came back. The other half of the time I spent squatting in the graveyard and worrying about you until my head hurt. If it hadn't been for Molly talking sense into me I would have showed myself long ago and you would have gotten killed for it."
"No it's okay. We have other people working on the case." Lestrade said. John stared at him and shook his head, chuckling.
"My name is Mary now. Don't ever call me Rosamund again." I bit harshly. There was a growl behind me and I tensed up. Great. Now I've done it. This man was going to kill me because of my own stupidity.
There was a lot to look at. They had clothes and sunglasses. There was a bunch of food and I realized just how hungry I was. "We'll go to the food courts by our room next okay?" Sherlock asked and I nodded eagerly.
I shook my head. "No. He became so serious and withdrawn. I think I lost him Mrs. Hudson. I think I lost him for good." She rubbed my back soothingly and I smiled sadly. "I should go and pack a bag. Goodbye Mrs. Hudson." I whispered. She hugged me tightly before sending me upstairs.
"Shut up." I said, playfully hitting him. He smiled at me before resting his head on my shoulder and falling asleep.
"You need this. You get antsy and bored and we all know how much you hate hospitals. You need to go out and do something productive." I was still shaking my head. "Sherlock. I'll be fine. Send someone in. Hell send in Mycroft so they can call you if something happens but you need to go." I sighed because he was right. As much as I wanted to stay by his side, I was getting antsy.
I knew he didn't want to talk about this but I knew we needed to but I nodded slowly, crawling out from under the covers. John followed not to long after and we headed into the dining room to set about making plans.
I was vaguely aware of two figures rushing towards me. One started asking me questions but I couldn't understand a word he said. I slowly turned my head towards him and realized it was Lestrade. My brother stood behind him, a little bit of pity displayed on his face.
I looked at him confused for a moment. "Don'lt look so shocked. You proposed to me remember? It was either that or Cluedo but God knows I'm not playing that with you ever again."
"I'm sorry but I couldn't live without you. I knew that I liked you but once I lost you, I realized that it was so much more and it hurt to think that it took me so long to figure it out and I was only able to say it to your dead body. I was utterly destroyed. Mary gave me a choice, him or me and I chose you because I couldn't move on. I believed that you would come back and yet everyday I died and I would see you and it would only get worse. I believed that you were here and that you were talking to me and I learned to believe that you weren't real. You were part of my hallucinations and it broke me everyday. I made extra tea, I moved into your room, I did whatever I could to feel close to you but I couldn't. No matter how hard I tried to."
Footsteps made their way back up the stairs. "Let me guess. Another murder. We are gonna be needed." I sighed. Lestrade nodded and I looked at John apologetically. He shrugged and I got in a cab with John close behind.
I sat shocked. Nothing was making any sense. My vision blurring with tears I refused to shed in front of all of these random people. "What is he still doing here? Get him out!" a doctor yelled but no one moved toward me. He sighed, walking towards me quickly. "Sorry sir, you can't be here." he said sympathetically as a pair of hands gripped my shoulders and quickly ushered me out of the room and into the hallway. My back hit the wall as I tried to steady my breathing.
"Why then?" I asked, slightly nervous to find out. She emered from behind the counter, shotgun in hand, and a wicked smile on her face. I swallowed the lump in my throat and backed up a bit. She frowned, cocking the gun.
"As if I'd ever leave you alone in this world. You wouldn't know what to do with yourself." I chuckled at that because he was right. My smile fell though when he winced.
I heard the door creak open and jumped up, excited to finally get going. When I spotted Sherlock, I froze. Wow... he looked amazing. Suddenly I realized that I have never seen him in shorts before.
Body part's did that right? Some shortly after death, twitch. I watched again, waiting to see another sign of him being alive. His hand twitched again and tightened around mine. Gasping as his eyes shot open. "Sh... sherlock?" he asked.
She smiled warmly and moved into the kitchen to prepare some breakfast. I huffed as I lied my head back down. I didn't work anymore. They agreed to still pay me some money so that I could live but I couldn't work. My free money was about to end though with the upcoming new year. I wasn't exactly fired but I wasn't fit to work.
I opened my eyes just as he leaned down and kissed me. I breathed a sigh of relief when we pulled apart because it was no doubt real. He was really here and really did just kiss me. He hugged me again after noticing that I was shivering. I relaxed back into him, still not quite believing this was happening.
"Who the hell is Greg?" I asked confused and Lestrade raised his hand silently. I nodded and we started the last race.
"Umm..." Mycroft cleared his throat and I focused back on the game. It was close. We were neck and neck. Either one of us could win at this point.
I made my way over to the chair and sat down, not daring to hope that he was fine. I didn't want to get my hopes up but I couldn't help it. I stared at him curiously, grabbing his hand. Frowning when I did so. It was still cold. I looked down and sighed, I knew I shouldn't get my hopes up. I took another shaky breath, holding back the tears. Then something twitched against my hand.
Into the cut on his abdomen. Possible but not likely. Especially since the proof of poison was in his throat. I highly doubt Mike drank shower water. So how did he get it in his throat? I frowned slightly. This makes no sense. The only way he could have gotten it in his throat was if he drank it or...
"Okay then... Mr. Holmes you can leave when you're ready." She said before scurrying out. I jumped out of bed excitedly.
