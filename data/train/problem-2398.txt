“The acrobat,” Sherlock declared. “The Chinese acrobat, who was found dead in London. They were shot with a bullet matching the gun that shot John in the shoulder. Mary killed them after discovering their exit from her flat. Likely they had been slipping in and out undetected, administering the poison.”
When he sent John out on his own for cases, it was so easy to follow him in either form. And once Sherlock had scratched an itch, his restrictions on himself only loosened further.
This chapter was meant to be the first half of one very long chapter, but once i was way past the 10k word mark I realized it had gotten to be Too Much, so it's been split. The good news is, the following chapter is almost entirely written so I'll likely get it to you sooner than in one week's time <3 AS always, a millions thanks to my beta, Solitary_Endeavor. See you on the other side........
“Oh, and you've seen her brushes, I bet you can guess which one she favoured,” Moriarty said, moving him to the dressing table, and pushing him down into the seat. He let himself be led. He was delirious, possibly as mad as the mad man dragging him around. A part of him believed that if he let Moriarty go on like this, Moriarty would finally slip up and let on to something he could use to his advantage. The other part was darkly fascinated, obsessed with his husband’s dead wife, whose ghost hung over them all. And her relationship with his husband.
John exhaled harshly, his mouth agape. John hadn’t been prepared for him to ‘have a strop’, as John would say.
The journey to BAK 2212 went without incident. John slept in one of the many available pods in the sleeping area while the ship took care of the rest. After not nearly enough shut-eye, John was woken by an older woman’s voice, encouraging him to have his afternoon tea ration. John doubted that it was afternoon wherever they were, but he appreciated the pretense.
“Well you would think that, wouldn’t you?” David sniped, the tremor in his voice suggesting he was one wrong word away from blubbering. “This has all worked out wonderfully for you, hasn’t it Watson?”
The man at least had good taste, Sherlock supposed. He evaluated his chances; fighting three (and a half) hardened road thieves on his own was possible, but not a guaranteed win by any means. If he had nothing of value on his person, which he was well aware he did not, it might come to that regardless.
> Just 'cause it’s suggested to me doesn’t mean I’m taking anyone to the Orient Express. Unless you wanted to go again?
John smiled. “He’s right, it should be for you. Though really, it’s like forcing you to plan your own party. That Lady Norton is something else,” John said, looking particularly sour as he said her name. He couldn’t help but a hope some of John’s annoyance stemmed from her flirting. “And for Lestrade as well -  are you sure it won’t be too much work?”
While John did prefer to keep to himself, even he found the desolate planet a bit lonely after a few visits. The bots were his only company while he was on tour, and he had grown somewhat attached to them, as well as BAK 2212. John’s memory for meaningless numbers and digits was also not strong, and the human names made the unenviable task of distinguishing between them much easier.
John moved through each of the reactions to his stiff neck that Sherlock had just imagined. The corner of Sherlock’s mouth tipped upward.
John kissed his face three more times, once on the nose and twice on the cheek, before breaking away to retrieve his cane. Almost as if he just remembered he needed it. John leaned on it once again, but clearly required it less than usual.
“Oh,” Sherlock says.
“No,” John said eventually, turning to give a kiss to his ear. “I’m glad I didn’t. If we’re going to do this, really do this - I mean you committing to me, like this  - I’m glad that you know everything. That I’m not hiding anything from you.”
John wanted to laugh. “Yes, only—” John needed something to act as a cane, if he was going to climb the stairs. His leg didn’t hurt him now, but he knew better than to trust it on stairs.
—Sherlock fled to his freezing bedroom (window still open) without a word.
(also really people just call them carnations, but dianthus just sounds way better?? Red Carnation just does not have the same ring to it)
John immediately flushes. “Can we just get in the damn house now please?”
The pair of hands is odd though. John feels up the wrist and realizes they’re tied together and behind Sherlock’s back. Sherlock is lying on his front and tied up. Oh God, has he been like this
It was fortunate their room was entirely shrouded in darkness, as he felt his already flushed face grow hotter than if he’d had a fever. He whipped his head away from John, with the rest of his body shortly following suit. For good measure, he scooted himself to the other edge of the bed.
“That’s one way to arrive,” John said.
John’s entire frame heaved with the force of his breathing as they stared one another down. Sherlock belatedly moved to step between them, but thought better off it.
Sherlock ushered John into his chair in their room, and then dragged the chair from the dressing table to sit in front of him. He asked John to recount again how he had covered his steps, going over the sequence of events one more time. John repeated that he had copied everything Mary would have done - leaving the dinghy on the buoy, the cottage door locked. Moriarty had knocked on John’s bedroom door once he’d returned, but John hadn’t opened it.
“My kingdom,” Sherlock said, smiling tightly. “I suppose I don’t need to ask what happens if I get it wrong.”
> I hope not, what with the sex guides. Good to know.
John was at the tail end of his evening shift as a video sign interpreter for the deaf, and had so far listened to what he could confidently say were some of the most uninteresting conversations he’d ever had the misfortune to interpret. He was bored out of his skull, the headset over his ears was starting to chafe, and his hand tremor had acted up no fewer than six times. He always apologised when his hand went rogue, but at this rate he was bound to get a client complaint, and he couldn’t afford to lose this job.
“Why did you jump on the track after me?” John questions, much more serious than a moment ago and craning his neck slightly so he can peer down at Sherlock in the dark. Sherlock can barely make out his eyes, which are presumably still very blue.
Mrs Stamford’s body sagged into her husband’s arms. “Then I imagined it all, for naught! I was so terrified of asking you Michael, I was afraid of what the truth might be, but now I am deeply embarrassed at not having just asked!”
But the scarecrow insisted, and Archie was happy to have more company. He tied the scarecrow’s stick to his waist with his jacket, and John accepted that his fate for the day was to serve others.
Sherlock bit his lip, looking down at the pavement and then back up. “Dinner?”
“I didn’t come here to yell at you,” John said. His voice was still strained. He was not quite returned to his usual self. “I’m not angry. This was obviously an innocent mistake, and I’m sorry for reacting the way I did -”
There would be time for sorting that mess later, and time for him and John after that. Years and years of it, till this would all seem like a distant dream, a flash in the pan. A strange time when they’d been silly, and awful things had kept them apart.
It was almost a relief when one of the video feeds on a bot finally cut out. John waited for the connection to return with bated breath, and had to resist the urge to pump his fist in the air when it didn’t come back online within ten minutes of shorting out.
Watson cleared his throat. “Well, all the same, it was brilliant of you to have already known, before her confession.”
John thought it over for all of thirty minutes, before leaving the clinic to return to his lodgings, wrapping cheese and bread in a handkerchief, and catching a ride out of town on the back of a shepherd’s wagon. It wasn’t that John trusted a witch’s word, especially not one who was visiting him under false—and still unclear—pretenses.
However, none of this explained his moment of selfishness, almost a year later, when something even more unexpected happened to him.
The Witch lowered her gaze, unable to respond. Whatever had happened between her and Sherlock, it appeared she at least felt guilty for it.
John was surprised, and then suspicious of the sudden change of heart. “What do you mean? You’re going to actually respond?”
“He played the violin, though not well," he responded, haltingly. "I took after him in that I suppose. He was generally not a very bright man. He dressed a lot like you.”
Before he could gather his bearings, Watson had taken over the hard chair that Wilkes had clearly meant for
“Yes, yes, of course,” the man replied, looking over Sherlock and John’s shoulders to the Colonel and David behind them, clearly wondering what matter could possibly require such a crowd. “I’ve been expecting you, come in.”
“Oh, brother mine. Your way then, I suppose.”
“You’re rather good at those deductions. Suppose you were a detective. A private detective.”
“Sherlock,” John said - his name, John had said his name, and it cut through all other thoughts like a hot knife through butter. John must have said his name before. John must have said his name many times before. He felt as if he’d never been able to truly hear him, but he was ready to hear it now.
John pointed to his chest. “Here, where it left a mark. That’s healed now, but the pain is deeper in.” John didn’t mention the insomnia, or that when he did manage to sleep, he woke near tears.
Can you believe I thought these chapters would each be 7k.
Irene’s pocketwatch and Sherlock’s jar of dust from the fireplace were placed on the floor, and around the two items Sherlock drew circles in chalk. John had been instructed to sit on top of the worktable with the dog in his lap, while Sherlock and Irene took their places across from each other in the chalk ring.
“However, as always you see, but you do not observe.”
Sherlock’s response was to grab John by his right elbow, and drag him down the alleyway at a breakneck pace.
“No clue, but at least there’s nothing to say she was pregnant,” John responded, nonplussed.
“We can continue, I was merely looking at the paintings,” he said. He and Moriarty were completely alone on the landing. How strange that what hadn’t bothered him a moment ago now felt off-putting. How long had Moriarty been watching him, while he was lost in his own mind?
“They catch flies,” Sherlock said, flipping through the book in front of him, though without touching the pages. “Leave them and the dust alone, Mrs Hudson.”
Sherlock hadn’t heard a sound, his drinking must have drowned it out. He was always at his weakest when feeding.
“Are you sure you want to, in this position?” John asked, three fingers moving and pushing inside of Sherlock, conscientious to the last, despite his own clearly mounting level of interest. “It might feel better for your first time, on your front.”
The table stretched out in front of him, separating Watson and himself. They might have stared at one another for quite some time, at an impasse, if not for the sound of footsteps on the stairs.
:~) almost done ! See you next Sunday buds !
He wondered briefly, and madly, if some of the tension between John and Harry was caused by John being overly fond of her wife. He turned to look back over his shoulder. He was being paranoid. John was being kind, that was all.
Lestrade stopped again, and seemed unsure how to fill the silence.
He provided his age, which led Watson to reminisce on the days when he too had been a young man in his twenties. He personally felt Watson was not so old, but left him to his nostalgia.
His computer pinged.
Their laboured breathing misted in the rain, mingling in front of them. John was looking up at him before his expression collapsed like his leg. John redirected his gaze down to where his cane had dropped to the ground.
His mouth quirked up at the side. Did this woman plan to flirt with everyone in the room?
“I’ll stay, and I’ll take the room upstairs.”
Of course, there was more than consideration holding John back. People were complex after all, and their motivations usually were as well.
Stamford blinked at him, before glancing back at Captain Watson standing behind him. “Yes, of course. Captain, are you—?”
“You don’t need to let me off easy,” he said, facing the window. “You can - be angry with me, or scold me, when I’ve destroyed property. You don’t need to be so careful with me. I am the one who broke it and told no one.” He realized this was at the heart of the matter. John must have been cross at him for being immature, and he wanted John to - well, to notice him. Be annoyed by him at times. Tell him off when he was in the wrong. How else would he ever be kept right?
“Of course,” Sherlock whispered. He’d never seen John’s naked torso, and maybe that was for a reason. John had been shot in the shoulder. John had been ill for several days after Mary’s death, not letting anyone see him, because he’d been hiding a bullet wound in his shoulder. John, with an amateur interest in medicine, removing the bullet, and suturing his own wound. It was a cruel irony that John had successfully concealed that rather incriminating injury, only to have his emotional and mental distress manifest itself in his leg.
“Know my name. I only gave you my initials, and I’m not exactly named Sherlock Holmes.”

Perhaps it was something friends did?
> Christ.
to do with him, and that was perhaps worse.
How he must have seemed, after Mary. The boy he’d been then - lanky and awkward with dark unruly hair, face strange with its angular features, and clothes ill-fitting from his ongoing growth spurt. His presence like an insult, stumbling about the place that she had once reigned over with grace and mastery.
Though it did not go past John's notice that he was alone on a planet very far from Earth and the main base, the definition of the middle of nowhere, and strange things kept happening to the routing bots.
To his shock, somebody was standing by the window. The sunlight reflecting off the glass at the moment made it difficult to see more than the outline of a person.
“I suppose I shouldn’t suffer under the illusion that you didn’t know what you were doing,” he commented, and wasn’t sure why he had bothered.
“Well, it’s a tad creepy I’ll grant you that, but not much of a lead is it?” Greg comments, swinging his light throughout the room. The officers peer in but seem visibly unnerved by the room. John suspects they think this entire job must be a favour their boss is doing for a friend. They’re not wrong.
Something else that had been moved in his absence. Like his chair.
Sherlock was tired of seeing John’s unconvinced expression.
Sherlock’s ability to see through them seemed to impress people as much as the actual magic of his wares. John was impressed as well, though still overwhelmed with the changing of towns, which Sherlock did with a swish of the wrist, and Mrs Hudson did by operating a manual switch at the door. Each time the door was changed, John had to step outside to see for himself, either onto the steep road of Porthaven to smell the sea salt air, or onto the busy lane of Kingsbury, stinking of motor car exhaust fumes.
“Certainly, now that you’ve convinced me,” Sherlock says, standing up abruptly, looking around them, and then swiftly making his way across the street.
“I’m a tit,” John typed, and kept it. Maybe he could salvage some of his image if he showed a little self-awareness.
Sherlock’s eyes darted to Mrs Hudson, who was busy inspecting the damage to the wall, and back to John. Lowering his voice, Sherlock said, “I wouldn’t have gone to the palace on my own. You being there—it helped.”
If his sister was worried about him, he must have looked a real sight.
, was John’s first response, to which Harry replied,
“Are you ever going to cut it with that bollocks?” John wondered aloud with a certain amount of wistfulness.
“It was my wife’s,” John replied, his voice steady. “She looked after it, on her own. If it was damaged, I wasn’t aware of it.”
> Brilliant. Except for one thing.
Watson shook his head with a chuckle. “Good to hear, though I don’t have much choice on my dress.”
But Sherlock’s turned away from him. That’s the end of that one, then. John says: All right. So you don’t like the birds. What about the flowers? You always like that one. The, uh, the peony and the—
John had always known he’d follow in his father’s footsteps to enter the military. A large part of himself was unable to rebel against his father’s wishes—beyond later setting his sights on being an army medical doctor, rather than joining the infantry. If John imagined Sherlock would have needed someone to cover his back who was not unaccustomed to danger, and who had knowledge of medicine, well, John figured it was a pleasant coincidence.
. All these people, offering their sympathies, and me knowing that everything I said was a lie.”
John was speaking. What was he saying?
“Is that...?” John walked over, and touched Sherlock’s shoulder. His hand came away slimy, and a bit green, as Sherlock began to ooze in front of him.
“How could that have gotten there? Hmm, seems to oddly match the stains on this particular waiter’s cuffs – and so you see, really quite obvious, don’t you agree?“ he concluded while holding up the waiter’s sleeve.
John didn’t press enter. Instead, he navigated to his blog, and hit “New Post.”
Watson seemed to find that amusing. “Is this your brand of kindness?”
“Boring?” William repeated, trying on the word like a new article of clothing. “It is my human name.”
There was eventually another period of silence, during which John was actually able to watch the film, before Sherlock spoke again.
The man on the video call rolled his eyes at him, and the sex line operator likely did as well.
John must have agreed, for he took hold of his arm. “I know we’ve just had a walk, but what would you say to another?”
“What do you mean?” Watson asked with genuine interest.
“You might as well.”
She appeared startled by the change in direction, but recovered smoothly. “Not since the Manderley fancy dress ball, almost two years ago now. I suppose there won’t be any more of those.”
And doors lead to rooms.
Harry losing interest in solving mysteries was the start of something far more exciting—solving them with Sherlock Holmes himself. John thought of this as a fantastic upgrade, and was inspired to de-age his favourite character by a particular recollection of Holmes from the novels. As a young boy Sherlock had been dismissed by the police when he tried to convince them a simple murder was far more nefarious than it appeared. This injustice irked John greatly, and he enjoyed thinking that if he had been present things might have gone differently. As a result, his fantasies involved setting up a detective agency with Sherlock, which became the foundation of many daydreams.
Watson ever written? Oh, he hadn’t? Not a word? Well that was hardly a surprise. How he’d pushed himself on the poor man, how kind and generous Watson had been to put up with it. How good of him.
The friction between them was just enough to be maddening, but the slick fluid removed any risk of chafing. John wrapped his hand around both of them together, though it barely spanned the combined girth, causing only more fluid to be squeezed from Sherlock’s slits.
“By all means, produce your witness,” the Colonel encouraged. Sherlock watched John, but John was staring at David.
For once, however, luck was on John's side. The next morning John had the pleasure of watching Sherlock walk across another room, and was even provided with an excuse to dine with him by the grace of an unbalanced vase of flowers.
Fifth: Mrs Wilson appeared from the depths of the house to scream bloody murder.
“I-I don't know,” he backtracked, leaning back against the window. “I suppose I don't mean anything."
“If you’d like, I can drive you there in the car,” Watson offered.
“You don’t like it,” Sherlock said, looking down at his feet, and to John’s surprise, he sounded genuinely disappointed.
A party though, he had to admit, was an interesting thought. He hadn’t considered a party seriously, at least not until the bishop’s wife of the neighbouring cathedral town was forward enough to ask specifically whether his husband would be reviving the Manderley fancy dress ball.
The second: John had it bad.
“You were with the guy in the house Sherlock, seems like a pretty important clue to have that we went without.”
The car eventually stopped. He had almost forgotten this outing had an objective. Typical of Monte Carlo, they were part of the way up a cliffside looking out over the sea. He immediately jumped from the car to squat down to the ground. As he went, he collected dirt from different areas, and placed them in test tubes drawn from his coat. He moved from spot to spot in a crouch, but sometimes lunged up and over when a different patch caught his eye.
Oh God, the dinner. There was a string of things he’d forgotten about, apparently. John had mentioned it days ago, a public dinner for the county. The date had crept up on him.
“Lucky that you already have one of those,” Mrs Hudson chimed in.
So John asked. “What were you thinking about, right before you were going to take the pill?”
His bottom lip shook. He willed it to stop. “It’s your own nosiness that got you here, John,” Sherlock pointed out, petulant in the face of John’s stoniness. “You can’t blame me for what I am.”
“I’ll be direct, so as to not waste your time Colonel,” David began, with an attempt at a strong voice. “I have reason to believe that the verdict given at the inquest is not correct, and I also have the evidence to prove it.”
On the screen, there was a press conference by the police investigating the case, with a grey-haired man and dark-skinned woman addressing the reporters’ questions.
“You mean who would hire the acrobat assassin,” Sherlock said, stalling for time. Who? And how could he know with the evidence provided? “One of your enemies. Mary was the more public face of your little organization. You’ve been busy haven’t you, Jim? Fixing crimes for people?”

Sherlock’s flapping faltered, causing him to dip slightly, before he realised John wasn’t speaking directly to him. John thought he was still in the flat, and that he was the culprit behind an animal getting into the toilet. Which was also very rude of him, though to John’s credit, not entirely inaccurate.
Sherlock stayed quiet, though his arm pointing at the door dropped, returning to his side.
John huffed a breath. “What? You mean… shoot me so I’d kill her? As what? Her last dig at me?” John’s eyes widened slightly. “That actually… makes a lot of sense. Sometimes I thought she got a sick kind of joy out of tormenting me.”
With a growl, he said, “You’d better help me bloody navigate.”
The scarecrow approached him, having somehow gotten itself an umbrella. John appreciated the gesture, though his jacket was wet before the umbrella was overhead.
“They won’t be able to save it,” Sherlock pointed out, ready for the worst.
“However?” John prompted. “As I said before, either spit it out or leave.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Sherlock looks startled. John considers his deduction a success then.
Obvious. And he’d walked right into it, trusting a suggestion from a stranger. As he’d always expected, Moriarty was no mere servant. He had strings he could pull from anywhere. And if Moriarty wanted to torment someone, they would be tormented.
The ram’s not that small. And he has massive horns.
Harry laughed with a hand pressed to her chest and her head tipped back. “My dear, you are an optimist. I can hardly ever remember bathing here. The water is far too cold, and the beach is shingle.”
When Sherlock looked at John a moment later, concern etched in his brow and obviously thinking he needed to be break it to John that the house would be lost, that relief only grew. If he had traded bad memories for the only thing that really mattered in his life, John Watson had come out on top.
“Are they letting you go? Can we go right now?” Sherlock asked, eager to be gone.
I'm back, and as always a million thanks to my beta Soli <3
Not to interrupt you, John—
“Oh no. No, no, no. You can’t be serious. You honestly want me to meet with the Royal Wizard for you?”
“Well, I had a long drive,” John said, leaning back onto the edge of the nearby armchair. “I started out at the crack of dawn, and I shouldn’t have. That drive twice in twenty-four hours -” John arched his back with a hand on his spine, which had the benefit of stretching his shirt tight across his chest. “- it’s too much for anyone. But I also had the pleasure of meeting a friend of yours.”
John didn’t know what possessed him to ask. He felt like teasing Sherlock, just a little.
If the staff complained to John about how he snuck about the place, John did not let on. Every room in the house was kept pristine as if Manderley was in fact a museum, and likely he mussed things up as he went about, but what else was he to do? Why have a home that couldn’t be lived in?
“Yeah, of course I am,” John replied easily.
Sherlock snorted, his mouth turning down at the corners. “I’m not the one who forgets,” he said. “I remember. That’s my burden.”
“What are you thinking about?” John asked, putting a sudden end to his musings.
“Henchmen not of the Crown are not allowed past these steps!” a soldier from the lowest stair called out, tapping her saber against the granite with finality.
? And, and,
John tongued at his fraenulum one last time, drawing off just as Sherlock began to come in big, aching gasps of wonder. Sherlock was at last deafeningly loud in the quiet room as John’s hand worked him through his orgasm, which seemingly lasted for ages. By the end of it, Sherlock’s chest was heaving, pressing up against his completely ruined dress shirt. John was quite certain he had never seen anything sexier in his entire life.
The dance came to an end, and everyone applauded them as if it had been a true performance. He supposed in a way it had been.
Mrs Hudson finally seems to get the idea when he starts spitting wet paper balls out at her, and leaves the tray behind.
He smiled grimly, and raised his brows, as if offering John another opportunity to confide in him.
Their eyes met, and John burst into laughter. The man began laughing with him almost immediately, both unable to control themselves once they had seen that the other knew. The man had probably known the dirty talk was John’s original material the entire time, the perceptive prick.
John also had no idea how to respond, as the man had answered his own question. Luckily, the man continued on his own with short, disjointed gestures.
“Really.”
When he spoke, his voice was low and calm.
don’t take
“I need someone on my side,” he replied, and began walking again. He needed at least one servant he could trust, after all.
“Yes Mr Holmes, that is all spot on. After his mother died he insisted we move into the old place, and as our daughter was leaving soon, the reduced size was less of an issue. I was cutting back on my clinic hours as well, and selling our place worked financially.”
He could tell he sounded too stiff, too machine-like. He was terrible at making conversation. He had also implied Wilkes was faking it, which was not exactly in line with his companion duties – was there no end to his blundering?
> It’s a “yes, absolutely”.
Sherlock raised his head, smiling softly. “That’s very astute of you John.”
“It’s not that sort of question I promise you.”
John sighed. “Being Master of this place,” he said. “Almost as demanding as you, I swear.”
In his flustered state, he ripped the page out of the book, and tore it into as many pieces as he could. But her pen had been full of ink, and the ‘M’ in Mary had bled into the next page, and the page after that…
John looked as though he understood. Perhaps, John knew everything already?
The sun was still shining on the bed, where the satin case on the pillow kept catching his eye. He moved to the bed, a part of him questioning what he was doing, and the other wondering what all this had to do with Magnussen.
He knew the terrace was beneath them, and not even that far down, but he couldn’t see it for the fog. Moriarty was right, it would be like falling into nothing. He felt as if he had actually indulged in Moriarty’s offer, that he had already plunged the needle into his vein. The thought of it was soothing. It made him forget Mary, for a moment.
“That’s right,” he murmured. He’d forgotten that detail.  “What will you be wearing, John?” They would need to coordinate.
The foyer is partially lit by a soft light coming from in the kitchen. John moves to the doorway to see the fridge has been left slightly ajar. Which is. Odd. He closes it, and somewhat regrets removing the light source.
She shot him a sideways glance, looking very pleased with herself.
> Oh my god.
John holds his breath, pushes in, and swings it open.
Sherlock conceded the point.
“Right then,” John said, clearing his throat, “lead the way.”
“Sorry, wrong, Mr Watson is attending to his duties somewhere else. I suggest calling that room,” he said, confused by why Moriarty would need to call in the first place instead of meeting in person. Manderley was one set of rules after another.
Sherlock was clutching his head, bent in half over his splayed legs. “And now, on top of everything, I’m a carrot top.”
He snorted. “I’m hardly a fresh bridegroom. It doesn’t need to be in my honour.”
“More time is fine. It’s all fine. Assuming you don’t mind me continuing to stay here, in your bed.” John cleared his throat. “I mean, upstairs. If that’s all right.”
“Sorry, deep in the mind palace? It’s just you haven’t eaten anything, well not that that’s new, but you sort of looked like you were up to something,” John said, smiling tightly. “What is it? Another mystery?”
Moriarty bowed his head before leaving the room, likely to go about preparing the tea. They were to be host, guest and servant, it seemed. He was witnessing something incredibly bizarre, but two could play at that game. Or, apparently, three. If Magnussen and Moriarty wanted to put on a show, far be it for him to break character.
“Wilkes is still waiting downstairs for me. With the loaded car.”
He made his way towards the other servant, his shoes clacking against the floor in a way that appealed to him, while also realizing he was likely making a racket. The black figure waiting for him at the bottom of the stairs was wearing felt-soled shoes, and likely thought he was an imbecile. Or so he assumed. It seemed like Moriarty had to have been thinking something – his dark eyes were ever watchful in his pale face.
“Yes, of course. Go get some rest.”
John had jumped out of the bed, likely as soon as he’d realized there was something else in it with him, and Sherlock roused himself before John attempted to forcibly remove him. He flew upwards, which only caused John to start up again.
actually,” she returned with a wink.
Regardless, he knew it must mean John was happy with him.
There was once a beautiful peacock who only used his feathers for good. Unlike other peacocks, he could change his feathers like a chameleon, which allowed him to wear many different disguises. This was not a gift he had simply been born with, mind you. He had started with a knack for it, and had honed the skill throughout his lifetime till he was able to match every specific shade and hue, even texture. By doing so, he was able to help others with all sorts of bird troubles, like missing nests, disappearing eggs, and stolen mates.
“It’s all right,” John said quickly, as Sherlock bent their body into the ship’s opening. “You don’t need to go back in.” Sherlock retreated, and closed the hatch.
She returns with a book, a plain beige journal, which she hands to Sherlock. Sherlock moves to the couch to sit next to John, which John is immediately grateful for as he is dying with curiosity.
“Nothing for it then. We’ll just have to clean you up.”
> So, you’ve answered all the same questions that I've answered? I don’t remember that.
”es. As John moved his mouth over the engorged flesh and tongued at the individual slits, Sherlock could barely do more than keen. With Sherlock’s cockhead pressed against the back of his throat, John licked along the edge of one dripping slit near the base, working the tip of his tongue as far as he could manage into the thin opening. Sherlock came with a shout, accompanied by another veritable river of fluid pouring from the slits. John’s mouth was completely flooded, forcing him to draw off with dripping lips as soon as Sherlock’s hips stilled their final jerky thrusts. John felt incredibly dirty, and incredibly hot. He’d never been harder in his life.
As he’d learned, Irene Norton’s seductions turned on and off like a light switch.  “I’d rather not find out anything of the sort, Lady Norton.”
“I’d love to,” John replies, a hint of laughter in his words. “I just need to get my cane from wherever it went.”
“Well,” Mrs Hudson said, now placated. “I suppose I could open an herb and flower shop, if that’s what you mean.”
“What are they, and why are they following you?” John was still looking back; they were gaining on them, and gaining in numbers.
He had to valiantly keep himself from vomiting on the rug at the thought. As if Sebastian cared about who gave him away! Odious Wilkes just wanted to be present at John Hamish Watson of Manderley’s surprise wedding. Luckily John was prepared to dissuade him of this idea.
It wasn’t Watson. Or rather it was, but the modern one. He would need to work on better sorting out the Johns, but first to gather his bearings. Intravenous line in the junction of his elbow, ECG leads sticky against his chest, lying back against well-washed and well-used sheets, lights dimmed, the rattling of a cart fifteen meters away—
Yes, wonderful, he thought. Get out already.
John’s relationships with real people always inevitably failed, and he was well aware that the blame lay on his own disinterest. It was still troubling that he could maintain a lifelong obsession with a man who didn’t exist, when he couldn’t even fake interest in a living person for more than a few months. He still imagined the long term trajectory of his life ending with marriage and  settling down, distantly planning to imitate his upbringing.
“I thought you said he was out?” a man’s voice responded. There was an accent there, but he’d need to be closer to detect it.
Better him than a servant, he supposed that was true.
“For a reasonable price of course,” Magnussen continued, as if discussing any business transaction. “Everything would need to look clean on paper.”
“Sherlock!” John called again, now walking past the kitchen.
But more than that, he hated that he was right.
“Not as such, no." His deep chuckles seeming to reverberate out from his chest.
“And you weren’t thinking it?” Sherlock asked, not entirely sure.
Visitors were never taken to the West wing. Ergo, the figure in the window was no ordinary guest, and certainly not anyone he knew. However, as he continued across the lawn to the house, he supposed he was about to.
“My past relationship with royalty has been
Sherlock glared down at him from the hallway light fixture. Sherlock then swung their legs down from the ceiling, still holding their upper body up by the tips of their fingers, before dropping to the floor.
While John had managed to remove Mary’s bullet from his own shoulder nearly a year prior, John had always been aware of the possibility that fragments from the bullet had been left behind. However as no one else could know of his injury, and with the risk of lead poisoning so low, John hadn’t spared it another thought. And he wouldn’t have ever thought of it again -- if not for Sherlock palpating the area surrounding the wound recently, conscious of the possibility of shrapnel still within the soft tissue, and discovering he could feel them, just beneath the skin.
Magnussen’s eyes trailed his body, as they had on their previous encounter. “You can interest me in a great many things, Mr Watson.”
John eyed the man on his screen, thinking of how to best describe him to a professional dirty talker. “Well, he’s got brown, almost black, curly hair. Sort of blue eyes. A bit posh. Looks tall.”
John never returned to the subject of feeding, not after the night of the discovery. Apparently all John had wanted confirmed was that Sherlock didn’t drink from humans, and that he still wanted to have honey in the morning. John, of course, had no cause for thinking this was unusual. He had no way of knowing that Sherlock’s practices were particular. (
“So, you’re saying you didn’t bum a cigarette off him?” John asked, doubt evident. “When you’ve been crawling out of your skin with cravings lately?”
In response he hummed noncommittally, and covered the turned up Queen of Spades with his own Jack of Hearts.
John signalled that the phone was ringing. The man rolled his eyes at the gesture.
“Yes,” he said.
“Robert went to the post this afternoon, and isn’t back yet,” she said, twisting her hands in her skirt. “But sir, if you want tea now, I can get it for you? I don't think it's quite half past four yet.”
“As I’ve already explained,” John started, feeling the beginning of a headache coming on, “I’m a sign interpreter for the deaf. So it’s not for me.”
“Yes,” Lestrade confirmed, looking like he greatly regretted entering into this conversation.
John still clung to enough optimism to hope Sherlock could feel the same. John lived in the moment in Monte Carlo, and he tried to continue this lifestyle past it when they returned to Manderley. Unfortunately, he had left Manderley in a sorry state, just as he was to bring a young husband into it. John tried desperately to correct the natural turn of the tide against his class and his own neglect of the estate, all in the hopes of keeping his new life intact. Ironically, in an effort to not neglect the estate, he neglected the very man he had wanted the estate for.
As if he needed his older brother’s protection.  And what did he even mean? How was he not safe with John, of all people? He could easily overlook his brother’s poor outlook on his own character, but his brother’s firm dismissal of John as someone not worth anyone’s time he absolutely could not forgive. Was he actually suggesting he was with John for his money? The thought alone made bile rise in his throat.
John sat back down on the couch with drink in hand, his focus drifting to his reinstated armchair. Where had it gone while he’d been away? Clearly hadn’t got very far.
John missed quite a lot of what the man had just signed in a whirlwind of gestures, but had gotten the gist.
John kissed him again while his eyes were closed, but broke away as soon as it started, almost embarrassed.
When they reached their room, he locked the door behind them. If John thought that was strange, he didn’t comment. John mostly appeared unclear on what to do next.
The moors were as dreary as ever, the mist outside more like rain. John’s eyes stung as he stared out into it. What was he doing with his life, playing live-in assistant to a wizard? What was that ever going to get him? John had wanted to believe there was more to Sherlock than flashy clothes and charming smiles, but perhaps the only thing Sherlock knew how to do with hearts was keep them in jars on the shelf.
He did not respond, and only smiled tightly. He wouldn’t rise to Moriarty’s bait.
“What do you mean?” John whispered. John’s voice was pure anguish, anguish of which he was the cause.
Sherlock ran the palm of his hand over the scorched table, his dark hair rising up away from his face and purple smoke crackling beneath his fingers, till nothing was left of the witch’s mark in the wood.
John couldn’t undo his zip fast enough, opting instead for opening the flies on the coveralls, and pulling his cock out through the opening. Sherlock’s legs were weak and flushed bright violet, but two sets of arms dragged John up from the floor, just as John reached down to fist himself in his slicked hand. John groaned loudly at the first brush of contact with his own palm, barely aware of Sherlock’s hands grabbing at his arms listlessly, active but not reaching down to help as John stroked himself.
Sherlock dove for the other side of the bed, landing with grace. The covers were already partially lifted, making it easy to wiggle underneath. The sheets themselves were only satisfactory, but they felt much better when he had folded his wings around himself, forming a tight cocoon.
Mrs Hudson had retired for the evening. He thought to remark on it aloud, then wondered why he felt the need to state the obvious.
He had visited with Wilkes’ the day before, and found that he couldn't stop prevent the conversation from creeping into his mind.
He saw John ambushed by people near the library, presumably performing similarly, accepting thanks and ushering people out. The great hall eventually became vacant once again.
Which meant they were adaptive, which was… brilliant. And still did not rule out the creature being a machine. A tall, long-limbed, naked machine. John couldn’t see anything else unusual about their body, besides the lack of genitalia, which was perhaps in favour of the robot theory.
“Your proposed witness does not seem to be a witness at all,” the Colonel commented dryly.
Sherlock sighed. He hated having to make promises he didn’t want to keep, but would now have to. “I won’t come into your room or the toilet as a bat any more.” There. That should do it.
“Is that how you usually learn how to speak then?” John finally thought to ask—but Sherlock was already re-immersed, and despite seeming to only need hands for reading, did not look back up from the book.
Gladstone was running about, which the dog was welcome to, as he himself was going to investigate the cottage.
“Then what? Why not?”
> I just figured you’d probably get them to swot up first beforehand, so you’d already have some readers at your disposal.
“I don’t handle loss well. I’m…. I’m afraid of – losing things.”
“I’m sorry,” John said, barely containing his laughter, “but
Sherlock considered it.
“Sherlock, is that your final answer?” Mycroft asked. “Once it’s done, it cannot be reversed.”
Moriarty turned away from him, continuing his progression smoothly through the archway of the gallery to the long, broad carpeted corridor beyond. He followed after him, traveling down a narrow staircase, and up another. He was beginning to wonder where he was being led.
Had John overheard them? He studied John in return, but after a beat, decided John could not have caught their conversation. John was inferring. Was there something about his demeanour that suggested their conversation had made him troubled? Or was John merely referring to his own negative reaction earlier in the morning room?
Sherlock continued to climb back up the side of the crater, and John followed behind shortly after. John understood Sherlock’s hesitance now, as Sherlock had indirectly answered his earlier question. If anyone knew what Sherlock’s kind was capable of, there would be a high price on their heads to be sure.
Worry grew in the pit of his stomach, remembering Sherlock’s hushed words about the witches and wizards who served in the war.
“Look, ‘Madame Glinda’, can you tell me where my–“ he draws up short momentarily not sure what term to use and feeling idiotic before continuing with “–Sherlock. Can you tell me where Sherlock is, or can’t you?”
“Those things you observed about me, I’d like to know how you figured them out. I have a feeling it’s brilliant. Also, your voice is deeper than I was expecting.”
It was just a public dinner. Something to do with the county. Only, accidents happened all the time.
He was blinking again, but instead of confused he only felt angry. On many occasions he had held his tongue despite the scathing remarks that bubbled beneath the surface, not able to be said, but now he found he could speak them very well indeed.
“The war goes on whether I fight in it the way the Queen wants me to or not,” Sherlock said, almost spitting as he spoke. “They’ll drop bombs from the southern coast to the northern border whether or not I—”
Test tubes scattered across the ground in a clatter as he moved swiftly forward to grab the back of Watson’s jacket.
“I haven’t taken any of it, as you can see. If I had, I would most certainly not be speaking with you at this moment.”
, there’ll be time for that later,” Sherlock snapped, growing impatient.
“The police, I solve crimes, and I’ve deduced your military service as an army doctor, that your leg injury is psychosomatic, and that you work as a GP. You’re bored with your current life, you’re a romantic –“
“No,” John answered, his voice gruff with disuse. “I don’t think it touched the bone. Thank God.”
Watson stood from his hard chair following this biting comment. He watched Watson lean and shift his weight on his cane, while Watson excused himself.
Sherlock turned around neatly, pivoting on his heel. “I’m afraid I have no idea what you mean.”
“Mr Moriarty wondered, Sir, whether you would like to see your room,” Lestrade inquired, addressing him specifically. The man was a good servant then, aware of his master’s apprehensions.
” he asked, looking down at the ring on his left hand. Not to mention the amount of product he had in his own hair. He blinked several times. “Does she not know -”
And that's all folks. Hopefully this is what the person who asked for it was interested in - I seem to have ended up going from start to finish lol As always, thanks for reading <3
Sherlock spluttered, and then—“Next time?”
John could just see the outline of the creation through the translucent panels of the device, which Sherlock now reached into, pulling the newly printed object out to show him.
“I might suggest that I find that rather… agreeable,” he hazarded, and was rewarded for his bravery.
He had tied this knowledge up so tightly, and yet the words left his lips with surprising ease. Neither had ever discussed or acknowledged Watson’s wife before. Your wife.
“Yes, thank you Captain, we appreciate your sympathies,” he interrupted, at last moving to John, and taking hold of his arm. “My husband and I need a break from all the activity I think, in light of the news.”
The proclamation was followed by a slight dip forming in Sherlock’s chin, with the lower lip turning out into a pout. Just like when he had been texting him, John found himself wanting to laugh.
“What if they don’t enter the house?” Sherlock whispers back.
“Anything would be,” he said. John was grinning at him as if mocking the nickname of landmarks around his family’s estate was a true delight.
John knows he’s being mocked, but it’s the kind of joke that makes him feel in on it. They’re lying under a new duvet. It’s long enough to drape over the end of the bed, but Sherlock’s toes are between his thighs any way.
John stared at him as if he couldn’t believe him, before shaking his head. “If it comes to it, I will fight this alone. I’d rather that than newspapers backing me, I promise you that.”
He attempted to steer Harry and himself away from the midst of the dance floor to allow them a modicum of privacy, but this was to little effect. Her words were hardly fair, but he was wracked with guilt by them all the same.
As he was now very familiar with John, he could see even before the usual tells that John found this all rather painful. Wilkes was speaking to John now, pumping his hand enthusiastically while gripping his forearm with the other hand. Wilkes began to usher him about the room, showing him off to the others. John smiled tightly and inclined his head with each introduction. John hated it, he hated this – and yet, he had come. Why had John come?
“If you wish to open up the rooms I will have it done,” Moriarty said, speaking over him slowly. “You have only to tell me. The rooms are all furnished, and can be used.”
“As I’ve already told Greg, no, I haven’t found anything here,” John replied, his spine straightening as his body instantly rose to the perceived challenge.
“Very nice sir. We were a bit worried it might not be done in time for your arrival, but miracles do happen. I think you’ll both be very comfortable there,” Lestrade responded.
He at once became aware of John’s approach, signaled by the sound his shoes and the clack of his cane on every other step. He wondered if Moriarty had heard John first, and left before he arrived. Moriarty would need to be very observant for that to be the case.
“God!” John exclaimed, rubbing his hand across his forehead. “These people can’t be stopped. And this is front page news, for this area anyway. I told them I didn’t know anything about the body, who it could be. And that I’d be much obliged if they never rang again!”
“If the powder is for the brown-haired one who brought in the tea tray, I wouldn’t bother, have you seen the amount of product he puts in his hair?
“I’ve done nothing,” Anderson repeated, “I’ve never told anyone, anything.”
John’s thumbs returned to their earlier placement, pulling back to reveal where John had liberally rubbed earlier. Nosing his way down the side of one cheek, John ducked down to lick a stripe over slicked skin. A groan and buck of Sherlock’s hips, and John nearly got knocked off track. At the loss of contact, Sherlock pressed backward, and John got the hint. There was another moan after a second lick up the middle, and a sound not easily characterised after his tongue pressed against the loosened muscle till just the tip dipped in.
When Sherlock released his hold on him, John stood back up on wobbly knees, and admired his work. Sherlock’s cock was still out, his trousers around his thighs, two sets of come drying on his torso, and his mouth and chin were still wet from sucking on John’s finger.
John’s unease from the first day he’d arrived returned in a flash. His current situation at once felt dangerous. Which was to say, John was having the most fun he’d had in a long time.
“You’re a nuisance,” he called, though if he were being honest, he was only pretending he didn’t want to return to the other beach. John wasn’t with him now. There was no one to be disapproving. And he was rather curious.
True to his word, John stayed, though Sherlock did not.
“Sorry,” John said, though he wasn't sorry in the least. “Can you take it off me, or not?”
“What?” Sherlock asks defensively.
He was not prepared for this question, and attempted to make his face devoid of any expression. Haughty, even. He should endeavour to seem as though a question of such a personal and emotional nature was beneath him.
The tea arrived, Moriarty bringing it in him himself, and even pouring them each a cup. He thanked Moriarty, and sipped the tea while holding the saucer beneath. Magnussen didn’t reach for his, or appear to have any intention to.
> Yes. :^)
“Yes,” John agreed, “but he wasn’t a very
“Clever. Jim had mentioned you were a bit of a detective,” Magnussen murmured, his tone entirely patronizing.
Except that soon after, another knock sounded at his door. Odd. Wilkes would usually have given up trying with him by now. That, and the knock had been off. Not forceful and incessant like Wilkes. A steady solitary rap against the wood.
“I’ll take the orders,” Sherlock declared, hands folding behind his back. “Archie, fetch me the usual supplies. John, let’s get started on these spells.”
“John, do I need to also be worried about your memory? She came in, sat in our client chair, and you were on the sofa right behind her…” Sherlock trailed off, before realization took hold. “Oh! Of course, that wasn’t you.”
“About,” Sherlock said with dramatic flourish, “Captain John Watson of the Fifth Northumberland Fusiliers.”
“Brilliant suggestion Jim, have Watson’s husband try it out, as if he isn’t in on it too!” David interjected, but the Colonel was already holding the diary out to Sherlock saying, “By all means, tell us what you make of it.”
Sherlock would have asked more questions and probed further, but John had largely returned to his senses, and had the wherewithal to remember that them staying outside for so long would begin to seem bizarre. Sherlock had to agree. Their behaviour would be under constant scrutiny from there on out, and nothing they did could seem suspicious.
Driving with Watson about Monte was surprisingly refreshing in comparison to how he normally spent his days – namely, holed up in hotel rooms or in the forced company of Wilkes and his ilk.
Watson had missed a spot while shaving (had he been in a rush to eat?), the bags beneath his eyes had receded (was the quality of his sleep improving?), and his lips were dried from frequent licking (meaning of this was unclear, perhaps just a habit). But these observations would hardly impress.
“My situation,” John repeated, annoyed that he had already given the truth of it away.
“Are you honestly giving me relationship advice right now?”
John still looked unconvinced, his forehead crinkled in its funny way. He leaned forward to kiss it.
“What?” Moriarty asked, “What is it? What did I miss?”
. John used his slicked hand to lube his cock once more, and slipped it between Sherlock legs, which pressed it up against the underside of Sherlock’s still erect cock when pushed all the way through the gap.
“Very mature Sherlock Holmes, are you about five years old,” John murmurs, continuing to rub his hands down Sherlock’s sides.
John is relieved when Sherlock verbalizes this for him by asking, “You never thought to question the dianthuses before?“
He made to break away, still unconvinced, until John tilted his face upwards and cupped his jaw, just like in the first dream. While he was frozen in surprise, John tilted his head further and slowly, ever so slowly, he watched John’s face move towards his until it was a blur. He was frozen, unbelieving, with eyes still wide open.
He noted Sherlock did not mention the fourth segment of the diamond, which was black.
Sherlock listened to John busying himself in the kitchen. He was making a show of putting away the shopping, banging items down and shelving them with vigour, even though they both always left Mrs Hudson do the rest of it in the end. Sherlock rolled his eyes.
“Yes, of course,” someone else interjected, one of Lady Norton’s yes-men, and someone whose name he hadn’t bothered learning. “Everyone missed out on the wedding, which is such a shame. Let’s take a vote - hands up for the Manderley fancy dress ball!” Everyone raised their hands, besides the hosts, and they all began laughing and clapping their hands, clearly thinking the battle won.
“Did you think about that?” John asked, just shy of smug.
It was written in a decidedly confident hand, clearly a woman’s. The ink had dried by the end of ‘from’, and the nib had needed to be dipped again. The M in Mary was written with thick, fresh ink. It stood out dark and strong, the tall sloping arches of the M overpowering the other letters on the page.
“Well,” Moriarty said, returning to his slow, bored drawl, now that his bedtime story was done. “Now you know why Mr Watson doesn’t like the sea all that much any more.”
_______
“The data we collected yesterday,” Sherlock said, staring at the game board. “Has it already been sent back?”
Sherlock’s eyes closed, but when he opened them again, he was still in the Victorian furnished sitting room.
Sherlock had allowed himself to be distracted by Magnussen’s presence, and had missed the telltale signs of John’s arrival. Magnussen obviously had not, and seemed delighted that he had been able to inspire John’s aggression.
Another meaningful silence from the other end.
And Sherlock says, not exactly.
“Right, yeah, I think you should apologize to him if you get the chance, though really it should be Moriarty doing the apologizing,” John murmured, trailing off as he looked studiously back down at the paper.
A very small part of him had hoped that John might offer, as a joke, to get rid of Moriarty, if he didn’t like him. Perhaps that was wishful thinking, and terribly trying of him.
“Blackmail!” the Colonel exclaimed, turning back to David. “This is all an unpleasant business. Sir, once and for all, have you any actual proof to back up your accusation of Mr Watson?”
He’d never been more overwhelmed in his life, and John continued kissing him through it, pressing his thin lips against his own, and saying his name over and over whenever he broke away. John was saying “Sherlock,” softly, desperately, repeatedly. It was as painful as it was perfect.
“Oh, God!” David cried out, and Murray looked up from his notes in response. “You mean she was pregnant!” David turned towards John pointing at him. “Pregnant - and you killed her!”
“Well, this is mine,” Mycroft said. “And here is my peace offering.”
With a secretive smile, Sherlock said, “You decide.”
. That’s what they’d said in the book, anyway.
The response time was almost negligible.
This, the most decisive moment of his life, all occurred within a few seconds. Moriarty was still watching him, curious. Wondering if he would still go through with it. Moriarty still thought he’d won.
“Do you happen to know what day it is?” John asked. He’d been a bit curious if there was any significance to being invited over on international day of feeling like shit if you were single, and feeling pressured to be romantic if you were not. Maybe it had been intended as a sign…?
John met his eyes with defiance, daring Sherlock to scorn him, call him an idiot maybe, or a coward. Something Sherlock could not have done, even if John had begged it of him. John’s family had ingrained in him that honour and the family name were to be prioritized over the individual, and John had taken whatever measures were available to do right by them. Sherlock’s admiration for John Watson, if anything, only had cause to grow.
He knew the painting she was referring to of course, it was the first one that had caught his eye when he’d arrived at Manderley. “Isn’t that more of a pair costume?” he asked. “Besides, isn’t it going too far to dress as one of John’s ancestors?”
“Shut up!” he whined, partially turning in the tub to look over his shoulder, and John laughed, helplessly.
“You didn’t have to say it. You didn’t like them.” Sherlock declared this, as if it was only a matter of fact.
“Pardon me sir, but it was you who brought him in,” Moriarty said, and it was darker than his earlier voice, and he could hear the smile in the words. He could imagine Moriarty’s skull-like face, with lips pulled back across his cheeks.
“It wasn’t for
> That you did. Well, I’m calling it a night.
Either way, John would leave. Though John was currently in his doorway, hand gripping the doorknob, in reality he was already gone. All of Mycroft’s warnings had come to fruition, and he should have known the clock was ticking down on them, and he should have known to never have gotten
John was confused, but above all, curious. If Sherlock Holmes lived and breathed, he wanted nothing more than to see what he looked like. However, John already felt like a bloody stalker reading the website of a man who had ostensibly never met him.
The woman on his right with her nose in a book: one – no, two – cats, works as a bank teller, just broke up with her boyfriend, her makeup is still slightly smudged from the crying, she’s highly considering getting another a cat –
“You can’t just—do that,” Sherlock managed, hand flapping to indicate John’s skin. Pale, he’d been back from overseas for so long, and blue veins visible along his wrist.
She would have written it time and time again, careless and familiar. She would have called out “Hamish” when she wanted him, and so that John would always know it was her and no one else. Mary would say it decidedly and purposefully, as it was written on the page. Hamish.
“So, where is your … Mr Wilkes?” Watson asked, unevenly. He was obviously still unsure of their relationship, seeing as Sebastian had never actually answered the question.
Before he gathers up his courage a voice rings out overhead causing everyone, including Sherlock, to look upwards. The train is apparently now out of service and all passengers have to exit at the next stop to wait for the next one. A nuisance, Sherlock thinks, reminding him why this mode of transport is terrible to begin with. Everyone shuffles out of the train shortly when the doors open, the voice overhead reminding them all to take their belongings. Sherlock keeps a close eye on John while maintaining his usual safe distance.
Sherlock raised his head, a small smile about his lips, though his eyes were still lowered.
John’s head snapped back to the Queen, only to find that the older woman from before had been replaced with Sherlock, currently peeking out from beneath a grey-haired wig.
John was still glaring at his grey hair and sagging face in astonishment and annoyance. “Am I pretending to be your father?”
They had stopped walking momentarily. Lestrade obviously did not want to continue their little talk. It was possible this was cruel of him. He continued regardless, like a dog with a bone.
“Yes,” he said, “and I want to take him back to the house.”
“It’s a surprise,” he said, and Clara smiled, delighted.
Sherlock’s arms now once again hung useless by their sides, and a glance up at Sherlock’s face made John groan. Their eyes were unfocused, completely blissed out, and their cock twitched each time John gripped particularly hard, with more pre-come dripping out onto his hand.
“You’re so easy. So easily
John was bored, alone, and contemplating ending things with the only person who wanted anything to do with him. He figured emailing the writer of a sex guide he had enjoyed might be a laugh, or at least better than the alternative. Why the hell not? The least he could was thank the person.
“You know I sprained Wiggins’ arm once,” John remarked, “should I look forward to being hung out over a railing sometime soon?”
, he said, “If you didn’t sleep well, you shouldn’t exert yourself.”
“Hmm, I don’t think I will actually,” John muttered darkly, spoken between short huffs of breath.
He doesn’t elaborate further. John assumes Sherlock falls asleep, but his breathing never quite evens out.
“What was – Actually, never mind. Honestly I don’t want to know.”
“It’s fine,” John said, unable to stay angry when Sherlock acted so pitiful. “We’ll just have to mop the stairs later.”
“What? Oh my God,” John gasped, understanding dawning, “I broke it off. God, Sherlock, I broke it off.”
“John, how truly absurd of you to say we are not companions,” he scolded.
He smiled tightly in response. Moriarty seemed to enjoy that, before turning his gaze back to the bed.
Bound herbs hung by string from the ceiling, and there were window frames with no windows, covered with maroon paisley patterned drapes. The mantle above the fireplace was well-decorated, including bat wings pinned to corkboard and a human skull, but the grate beneath it was empty, explaining the chill of the place. By John’s head, to the right of the door, there was a staircase, which John assumed would lead him up to the wizard.
The man was sitting with his laptop placed on a desk, in what appeared to be his living room. John worked with the visual.
Any eloquence John had ever possessed at signing had apparently left him. In his defence, he’d never had to describe
“All right, all right,” John said, as he was pushed out the door. It was a joy to be in the sun again, and to see the cobblestone streets outside of the Kingsbury store front, the aircrafts flying Ingary’s colours overhead, and one spire of the gleaming palace just visible over the tops of the buildings.
John did not test this theory, knowing that he shouldn’t, and hadn’t planned on it either. A brief and chaste kiss pressed to the top of the other man's head was the most that would ever come of it, and the most that he would allow himself. John had dark secrets, ones he could not in good conscience put on the shoulders of an unsuspecting person, and which also happened to be the very same kind of secrets that an aspiring sleuth would have loved to dig his teeth into.   In summary, there were many reasons why exploring his interest was a bad idea.
The pair of John’s coveralls that Sherlock wore as intended didn’t fit them well of course—the garment was too short in the arms and legs, and the waist sat too high. The overall effect was almost cute, or so John thought, while also really wishing he would stop thinking things like that about a person he had found in deep space.
“Perhaps you haven’t noticed John, but I only have the two arms at the moment,” Sherlock replied with, to John’s surprise, obvious sarcasm.
He’d done this before, but never gone past one finger. With his investigative nature, of course he’d explored his own body to its fullest. On past attempts, the discomfort of it had always caused him to lose his erection. However, now there was hardly any resistance at all, his arousal barely waning. He wondered if this was from practice, or from the thought of it being John.
Dreaming isn’t really the trouble, Sherlock says. It’s the waking up.
“What does that even mean?” Sherlock asked, raising one brow, and the scalpel. The next piece was pulled out easier than the one before it, and they were finished. As easy as that.
Mrs Hudson made the two of them supper, though they had to eat by the fire once the potion in the mixing bowl started to smell. When Mrs Hudson turned in for the night, it was with a passing squeeze to his shoulder, and a worried look in his direction.
“No, you’re right, I didn’t want to go to the other beach. Will that please you? I never go near the bloody place, or that God-damned cottage. I don’t - ,” John squeezed his eyes shut in frustration, and breathed in to calm himself before continuing.
“Excellent question, no and no,” Sherlock said, hands clasped behind his back.
But when John stepped past the stoop, a door at the other side of the room swung open to reveal an older woman with a broom held aloft.
John might have fantasised about saving Sherlock Holmes, but now that he had the chance, he had no fucking idea what to do.
The thought of Sherlock taking that pill had plagued him for months, driven him mad wondering what Sherlock could have been thinking. It occurred to him that he now had Sherlock at his disposal, to pick his brain however he chose, so long as Sherlock was in the mood to answer.
“A stray cat? We’re in a cellar John.” They were, in fact, in a partially underground and locked cellar. Their only link to the outside world was a small, barred window in the room’s top corner, much too tiny for a person to fit through.
Sherlock could hear the question before it was asked, and John, not a stupid man, knew it too. The Coroner would ask about Mary.
It seemed they’d come to an understanding.
, was John,
“No." Realizing Moriarty could probably now tell he was lying, he recovered by saying, “I just opened a door, but didn’t go in. I expect you like to keep all this shut up. I'll just be on my way  – “
John laughed, and it felt like they were back to their old selves. Or rather, where they had once left off. Before all this marriage business.
, well then –“
“It’s hardly an obsession,” John protested, likely still trying to relax him. “Back before we got ourselves sorted, you not being able to puzzle something out reminded me you were flesh and blood. Can you blame me for being fond of them, when in my mind they were all connected to that?”
Little did he know, John wasn’t about to interpret any of that.
“Well, it’s a good thing you don’t take much stock in rumours, as I think I might know someone who can,” she said, turning to face the window overlooking the train tracks. The moors loomed in the distance.
“Never mind what’s happened to the ship, Mr Watson,” the Captain replied. “That’s already being settled. There’s other news, from the diver.”
John was looking at the actual reason, and Sherlock’s silence spoke volumes. As John continued to stare, Sherlock continued to scrape. John wondered if Sherlock knew their pale skin was starting to turn blue-purple, as if attempting to blend in with the crater. John wondered if Sherlock was doing it on purpose, and that Sherlock was subtly communicating they’d bolt if John didn’t reconsider his chosen conversation topic.
than the poems to your girlfriends at any rate.” His hands dropped from above his head with dramatic flair, and John was on the receiving end of an exasperated and expectant look.
At once the scene changed, and it was him watching as the sheet was lifted.
Anderson was terrified, which he felt was rather unwarranted, given that they’d met before. “Look, I just borrowed a bit of fishing line! I swear, I didn’t see nothing and don’t want any trouble!”
Sherlock’s arms had been outstretched in an aborted ‘ta-da’ gesture, but they now dropped to his sides. Sherlock’s face fell. John was really being quite unbelievable about this.
Like months after writing this chapter I feel the need to share the first thing that comes up when you search 1930s nightshirts,
John’s head twisted towards the door to the study, left open by the woman who had led him in, thinking of how best to strategize his escape. John didn’t know what would happen when the doors were finally kicked in by the Queen’s guard, but he had a feeling it either meant Sherlock would be in trouble, or that John no longer had a way home.
The Man’s left hand suddenly spasms, causing him to drop his novel. He moves quickly to catch it before it falls, the back of his neck slowly turning red. Intermittent hand tremor. Interesting. He’s embarrassed. And angry too. He’d previously been able to work as an army doctor, but is now forced into general practice at a city clinic. Bored out of his mind at work as well then. Sherlock would be.
anywhere, as you bloody well know –
Wilkes might have taken more offence to the parting remark, if he hadn’t been so shocked by the abrupt departure.
“Let’s get this over with, shall we?” Mycroft asked. Snapping his fingers, a gold chain flew out from the Witch’s pocket.
“Speaking of my hound, when might we expect you for a hunt? It must be awful for you, keeping to the house always,” Harry commented. Ah yes, the insinuation that she had the better lot in life despite not inheriting the place. He assumed the rivalry over that had been present since birth.
“It’s John H. Watson,” Wilkes declared, the volume of his voice making his companion cringe. “The man who owns Manderley. Even you’ll have heard of that. He looks positively wretched, doesn’t he? They say he’s completely gone to bits over his wife’s death…”
“Oh no, I’ve just been digging for shell,” the other man responded. “No shell here though, been digging all afternoon.” The man appeared to now be talking to himself.
John hadn’t felt this alive since he’d been in a warzone.
for—”
John could have done without the mention of Sherlock.
John’s brain was terrible at the moment, lust-addled, no filter. He kept returning to the idea of Sherlock always being distant from feelings and attraction, resisting all other advances his entire life—except for when they were from
John looked bemused. “Things?”
A single “Ready?” and Sherlock flipped onto his stomach in one smooth, unquestioning motion. John was left with a view of Sherlock’s back and five different kinds of edible lube, which John had to assume was a subtle suggestion.
“John, no, I’m not hurt. I didn’t seize up because of that.” Sherlock wiped at his face, but all John could see were tear tracks. “John, listen to me: I’m not actually. A sex guru.”
“Never heard of it,” John heard him say before drifting off.
John’s mouth quirked up at the side. Sherlock never could remember Lestrade’s name. John thought out his reply carefully. Better to answer the first question rather than the second.
John scoffed. “What the hell did she expect?”
John seemed to take his silent reminder to heart, as he then replied in a much politer tone, “I’ve been shocked throughout this entire process, starting with learning that I had made the wrong identification a year ago. That I am being now told that my wife’s boat also had holes driven into it with the intent of having it sink is, yes, quite the shock for me.”
Sherlock was a great actor, John had seen him put on crocodile tears time and time again to get what he wanted. And Sherlock always got what he wanted, always his way. If grand emotion like crying was easily in his range, affectionate boyfriend probably hadn’t been much of a stretch.
“Regardless, I’ve solved this one,” he said, with not a little smugness.
“I have a secret.” John snuck a kiss to his ear lobe. “I still think you’re a sex guru.”
“John, are you hurt? John?”
A muscle in John’s jaw twitched, but he did nod his agreement, albeit reluctantly.
We're back, and I think this is the longest chapter yet ! As always, this would not be possible without Soli basically coaching me through it, and cleaning up after me <3
Must have been her then. Like with the coffee.
“A ship,” John surmised. Admittedly, he would have never been able to guess that if he hadn’t been somewhat expecting Sherlock to show him how they had come to be on a deserted planet. The ship itself appeared more organic than machinelike, as if made from naturally-growing materials. It was roughly in the shape of any single-passenger ship John had piloted, with the front narrowed, and the back designed for propulsion. The outer shell was however flesh-like in a dark shade of green, and the window for the pilot to see from, while translucent, seemed to be oozing.
“To be fair Dr Watson, that is normally what’s asked of me.”
It was nonsense of course, and he opened the door with unnecessary vigour because of it.
“Hardly begging, and that’s why I’m
—he couldn’t keep John with him like this. Shutting John out and operating alone was his greatest mistake, repeated time and again.
John blinked. “Do you mean that literally, or figuratively?”
The conversation became circular after that. John was unable to believe the evidence in front of his own eyes. Which, while better than John running away screaming, still wasn’t enjoyable.
“No more planning,” John replied, and began cupping water in his palms to pour over Sherlock’s head. “I think we do best when we wing it. Don’t you think, drama queen?”
“I was the one who owned that property in Kingsbury!”
Perhaps this was all for the best. John had been distant with him the night prior, and his response had been to dream about – things he should not be dreaming of about a widower. Even if he hadn’t been leaving, he felt he had irreparably damaged the nature of their friendship. John had called him a brat and had comforted him after he’d almost had a cry in his car. How would John feel if he knew how the comfort he had offered was interpreted?
“No! I think quite the opposite if you must know,” Sherlock said, leaving the poker where he’d found it, and returning across the room. “I am, in all honesty, delighted to meet with your approval.”
“I know that,” Archie said. “But it’s only a riddle.”
“How do you know if it works?” John asked. “We don’t even have the second verse of the spell.”
Unpleasant thoughts were starting to creep in, and he absolutely couldn’t have that. Busy, busy. He needed to be kept very busy.
“You’ll never know if you don’t come back to my flat. So, dinner?”
“Jealous?” Sherlock quipped.
“Mr Watson, please understand that as sympathetic as we are for you, I will need to question you on your personal life.”
> Excellent? Are we sure it’s excellent?
Watson cast a smile his way, and he couldn’t help but feels his lips twitch in response. Oh, but Watson was a bit glib. He found he rather liked it.
> Then why didn’t you respond for a day?
The gold pocketwatch landed in Mycroft’s palm, and was then held aloft. “Storing all your reserve power in one item? Risky, risky.”
“I’m to bed, I think,” Mrs Hudson said, returning to the door she had appeared from, “but feel free to stay, John.”
“I’d rather hear it from the source,” Sherlock said, bristling. “Rather than biasing you with my interpretation of the spell.”
“Um, Sherlock?” He cleared his throat. His voice had warbled. God, what was he about to do?
> Sorry in advance if this is a gross misunderstanding, but are you asking me to meet you?
John smiled, imagining a young Sherlock spending his summers inside a cottage near a marshy pond, working on spells, and deciding to make up his own in the process. John’s smile slipped a fraction when he noted there didn’t seem to be anything around them for leagues, and the cottage was too small for his uncle to have stayed with him.
Right. That was no help.
There are always two sides to every story, or so people always seem to say. While that’s debatable, this so called other side will be presented as a list of crucial details that have been in the past excluded.
John lifted him immediately, slinging Sherlock’s arm over his shoulder to assist him. Sherlock turned back, and could see just the silhouette through the fire of Moriarty retreating, dragging his right leg behind him, reminiscent of his long ago mockery of John. Sherlock had one last glimpse of Moriarty’s turned head, with his gleaming smile and dark, dead eyes, before he was lost to the flames.
However, when John finally reached the exact mark of Mike’s dropped signal, there was no sign of any routing bot. In fact, there was no sign of anything at all.
John can’t help but be amused that they had both shared the exact same thought for each other, but then suddenly realizes -  “Hey, wait a minute, isn’t he that the bloke from the family photos?”
