"It's not a line," Dean protested. "It's amazing just laying here and watching it. I won't try anything. I'm the one who said the sex stuff had to stop remember?"
Taking a deep breath, Dean felt the nervous flutter of butterflies in his chest at what he was about to do. Then, ignoring them entirely, he grabbed the phone off of the table and held it closer to his mouth.
Despite his words, Dean's hand closed tightly around Cas' fingers, holding on as if Cas was his only anchor to the world. He closed his eyes.
who I need to hold in my arms to feel safe enough to close my eyes at night. You're everything, Cas. It's been you from the moment your sexy, angelic ass blundered into that barn, all white light and freakin' fire hazards."
Cas didn't need to look, but he did it anyway. The devastation was written all over Dean's face, in every tense muscle, and it made his stomach clench. No one knew how to tear apart their characters like the author who created them, and Chuck knew exactly where to hit to do the most damage, without ever raising his fist.
He tried hard not to let his eyes find his parents to see if they had noticed his moment of weakness. He
Dean smiled against his lips and wondered if Cas had realised he was calling them his family now. He'd have considered mentioning it, reinforcing to Cas that he was right,
"You have no idea how much better Heaven is now. It's so much bigger than Earth and there's much more to see. You could spend forever exploring and never run out of new places to visit. Or you could spend months just on a beach - sand between your toes, cocktails appearing next to you one after the other. It's all individually geared to your wants and needs. It
Cas away for so long that Dean started to panic. Was Cas full of regret over what happened? Was he freaking out in there? Dean was just about to get back out of bed to check on him when Cas appeared in the doorway.
Dean fucking hated that they had to talk in code, but they'd discussed it the morning Cas had been getting ready to leave, and they'd agreed that there was no way Amara wasn't watching them. Half of Heaven's angels were missing, completely off the grid, and Cas suddenly going on a world tour without Dean—well, she wasn't stupid.
"Alright, this ain't gonna be a long speech, because I don't know about you, but I'm here for the drinking and the music, not for the sappy shit." A cheer went up amongst the hunters
Unfastening both of their jeans, he quickly and roughly pushed them out of the way. Then tearing open the packet of lube with his teeth, he coated his fingers in it, sliding over Dean and finding him still pretty well prepped from earlier.
"No. He's not dead—I would know. Rowena would know… his soul would have moved on. He wouldn't… he's not…"
to be gone again. So believe me when I tell you that I'm not reading anything long term into anything to do with you."
"It was perfect," Dean reassured him in between kisses. "Seriously fucking perfect. But with your mouth on me when I've waited this long to feel it - it was gonna be over in seconds."
Cas picked up the beer that Sam had made sure was waiting for him, and he had to admit that this was the perfect venue for something like this. The walls were high, trees dotted around the edges, full of fairy lights that twinkled prettily in the darkness. The tables were upturned barrels, placed on the paving stones that covered more than three quarters of the garden. The sound from the huge speakers carried well from the band at the back, and the makeshift dance floor was packed, bodies writhing, dancing, jumping, some just swaying and watching the band.
"You can have that birthday then. September the 18th is when we met in that barn and you scared the crap out of me. It's your day now."
Any errors in this are purely my own, as I've posted without it being edited. So sorry for the long wait xx
"How can you possibly know that when we haven't tried?" Dean asked. "I've tried to keep away from you, to leave you be. I've not called, not turned up when I've known where you were meeting Sam. I left you alone because I thought it was what you wanted."
Maybe their dad had changed? A man could change on his deathbed after all, that's what they say, don't they? They repent, reflect on their mistakes and change. Maybe...
Cas closed his eyes as if he'd been physically struck. When he opened them again tears shone brightly, threatening to spill over.
“Then don’t let it stop,” Cas gasped. “We’ll do this for-fucking-ever, Dean. Nothing else—just this.”
“Yeah, well he’s God’s dad now, ain’t he? Maybe that makes him too big a deal to look in on the hairless apes?”
"Sam was just telling me about you guys hunting together with your dad when you were young,” she said, leaning back in her chair and stretching, her t-shirt riding up to expose her bare midriff. “I’m sorry you lost him—he’d be so proud of you, though, and how far you’ve come.” She smiled, seemingly unaware of the way Dean had tensed, his expression becoming blank on his face.
"Dean, are you trying to kill me?" Cas was glassy eyed, panting, his hands clenching and unclenching on Dean's shoulders.
here and it could well be permanent. We have to deal with that, even if… if the consequences might not be what we might have hoped for."
But instead of running from him, Cas had pulled Dean even further into his arms, so Dean was laying on his unbruised side. They'd been slowly sinking down until they were almost completely laying down on the bed, and Cas' arms were so tightly wrapped around him that it was hurting him to breathe as every breath put pressure on his bruised ribs.
Cas nodded, looking down at his feet instead of torturing himself by letting him look at Dean's beautiful face. Chuck
Cas was fairly sure he could get the blanket over him without incident. Nights were getting cold, and thanks to the constant air conditioning, the Bunker was always on the chilly side even in the height of summer. He couldn't just leave Dean to get cold - it was Cas' fault he was out in the hallway instead of in his warm bed.
Dread filled Cas as Dean reeled like he had been punched, his eyes locking with Cas', devastation written all over his face. He shook his head, 'no' as if denying Chuck's words, needing them not to be true.
"Some people have a very strong belief in the afterlife," Cas shrugged. It wasn't a lie exactly, but he'd never wanted to tell her who he was more. She probably wouldn't have believed him anyway - he couldn't really perform any epic miracles these days to convince her either.
Thank you so much to Masonic for their incredible editing skills and to ValandraEvans for her help and honesty xx
"Yeah, okay. So I'm a bit distracted today, but even you have to admit that Cas looks shit hot in that suit!"
Dean stood back, but didn't sit down, hovering near them instead, as if he could transfer his skill to Cas through proximity alone. Glancing over at him Cas realised that Dean wasn't taking his eyes off him, and the warmth he saw there made Cas feel all the things he had been trying so hard to avoid.
He clung tighter, holding onto Cas like he was the only thing keeping him on this earth. His addled brain was screaming at him, shrieking that this was Cas underneath him—
"I'm getting us to Bobby - he'll know what's going on. What's the worst that can happen? The car flips and we die? Again?" Dean glared determinedly out at Heaven as a flying branch hit the windscreen, making him flinch. “Can we even die up here? This is Heaven for fuck sake. I almost prefer zombie-on-a-loop mode.”
Dean ran his fingers through his hair over and over again - it was a sure sign that he was close to breaking point and Cas felt his legs tensing with the effort of not going over to him. He couldn’t get close - he couldn’t trust himself not to give himself away.
How difficult was it to get a little time alone together? Now that his mind had finally caught up with his body and figured out what was going on, it felt like they’d been apart for decades already, and these extra hours felt like years.
Dean frowned. Cas was burrowing like some sort of needy kitten or maybe a demented ferret, trying to get into its burrow. He was wriggling and snuggling, digging his way under Dean's chin, into his arms, as close as he could possibly fit, arms wrapping around his body in a way that now made him think of an octopus, or a boa constrictor instead.
"Don't get too cocky - it took you long enough to work it out and even longer to lure my foolish, suicidal brother here."
Kate was looking stunning in a long, flattering pale blue dress that followed every curve of her body, her hair tied in an intricate style that suggested she’d spent an inordinate amount of time trying to make it look so effortless and casual, her perfect makeup hiding any sign that she might even have had a sleepless night over what she had done.
Dean quickly dropped an arm down, closing his fingers around the hand that was stroking him, stopping Cas just in time. One more flick of that wrist and he'd have been coming all over his own damned feet.
Cas didn't say that what terrified him the most was that if they talked and Dean rejected him even further, he wasn't sure he could cope with everything they'd done, every memory he had being tainted irrevocably. He wasn't an idiot, he knew that what he felt was unreciprocated, but that didn't mean he could cope with having to see it on Dean's face every day.
Cas looked away again. He shouldn't have felt sorry for Chuck, but he did. The former deity was being used, a means to an end, and whatever reason he'd had for coming here, he didn't actually deserve this. It wasn't up to them to punish him, this was just horrific and cruel.
Sam had hung around until Dean started to contemplate physically maiming him. Dean had threatened him repeatedly, including giving Sam a graphic description of exactly how he would be dragging him out of the Bunker by his balls using an oven glove and a spatula.
be feeling this too. There was electricity crackling between them, and a feeling that was so very like falling even though Cas' feet were still on the ground. He had never felt more alive than he did in this moment.
"When Kate was prying, which by the way was purely so you'd admit that you liked me," Dean said, his hands in his pockets, serving to both protect them from the cold and evidently to keep him from throttling Cas, "you said you'd never had anything in your life that you would count. I don't know about you—or maybe now I
"I'm quite certain that they weren't invented for mastabatory reasons. And it's cold in there. If you're uncomfortable, why don't you go and make yourself a cup of tea? Talk to Nigel, check the news. I'll be as quick as I can."
"I get it," Dean finally replied. When Cas dared to sneak a glance at him, his stony expression had given way to familiar anger, his eyes flashing. "I know it was a goodbye - your Swan Song. It was a decent farewell, Cas. Real touching."
Cas tried to sound friendly, but the tension in his voice was obvious and Dean narrowed his eyes at him, before getting up.
He sucked his gut in and took a photo, showing Cas how his fingers were wrapped around his aching length.
"If the wrong decision was made, I still know Angels," Cas said. "They'll always be my brothers and sisters, even if they're forbidden from talking with me. We can sort it out, it can be changed."
"We were so damn broke," Dean couldn't stop the words bubbling up and out of his mouth. Now he'd started, he couldn't stop. "Stealing got me caught, poker games and pool didn't always go my way. Sammy was a teenager at that point and hungry all the frickin' time. I didn't know what else to do."
"You can't sit up with him all night. You've got your best man duties to perform in seven hours time, and you'll need a clear head for it."
Dean watched Cas as he carefully chewed, frowning as he did. There were so many things his friend hadn't tried and Dean found himself hit with the urge to make a list so they could test out each and every one in turn. That was something he could happily fill his days with. And nights.
The hand that had been holding Cas' wrist in a death-grip softened and gentled until Dean was cradling Cas' hand almost tenderly instead. He drew it to his chest, forcing Cas to step closer, and he pressed Cas’ sore hand against his chest with a tenderness that there had been no sign of at all moments ago.
"Run that by me again?" Kate asked, pronouncing her words slowly and carefully, as if talking to someone who wasn’t quite all there.
sorry," Cas said to Claire, who responded with a growl as she attempted to shove past Dean to get to Cas. "I was in Heaven and I had orders not to interfere on Earth. I didn't realise my not coming back would have caused this much upset."
Gabriel got to his feet and bent down in front of Cas. He placed two fingers on the back of his hand, healing the blisters that covered his stinging palm.
“It’s not because of all you’ve done - you’ve saved the world so many times, saved so many people. But it’s not that - it’s not about what you’ve done, it’s about who you are, and who you are is incredible. You are worthy of so much love, and you
He had felt an inexplicable pull towards Dean since the first moment he laid his hands on him in Hell, what felt like a lifetime ago now. In a heartbeat he'd felt both lost and found all at once and for the life of him, he couldn't explain any of it. It was like their souls were linked irrevocably from that moment on, and however much he fought it, nothing would unlink them. He belonged to this man, this fragile, breakable, beautiful human.
The barely suppressed anger made his words come out harshly, but Dean was too distracted by the noises in the background, sounds Dean thought he recognised.
“Yes, Dean,” Cas agreed meekly, his speech slow now, he no longer reminded Dean of a chipmunk on speed.
how much I care," Cas said, his eyes wide and honest, letting Dean see, refusing to keep pretending. Dean's breath caught in his throat.
Cas knew he was hugging too hard, that anyone but Dean would have complained by now and shoved him off, but Dean just smiled, dropped a kiss into his hair and squeezed him back just as tightly.
"Are we going to make this snowman, before I lose all feeling in my feet?" Kate asked, holding up the carrot and thankfully distracting Sam.
"We've got through years of misunderstandings, arguments, tragedies and deaths, and we've always found each other again," Cas tried to reassure him. "You don't need to do anything to keep me here, I'm already pretty invested."
"Chuck fished him back out of Heaven and gave him a body! He didn't recreate Cas' soul, because you can't do that! You'd never get it exactly the same. I can make a copy—someone who sounds like him and talks like him, but it won't
“I promise that when I leave today, I will come back,” Cas said, the hand he had on Dean’s waist stroking gently, in a way that Dean assumed Cas meant to be comforting. Instead it was driving him insane.
The familiar sound of the kettle boiling was oddly comforting. Dean searched through the kitchen cupboards,
"Dean, it was fine. Good enough to make me let my guard down enough to end up tied to a chair and stabbed with my own Angel blade. I'm finding this an awkward topic of conversation."
It took Dean several moments to wake up enough to register that the sound of ringing wasn't just part of his nightmare. He blindly reached and groped at the bedside table for his phone.
Patience shook her head, eyes wide. She flinched backwards when he stepped towards her. Dean looked unnerved and Cas immediately went to stand by his side.
“It’ll be okay,” Cas said, putting Dean’s hands on either side of his own waist. It wasn’t their usual way to hug, but usual had gone out of the window over the last few hours. Maybe even years, and he’d somehow just not noticed.
Dean reached across the table and put his hand on Cas' arm, making him jump and look up from his lap to meet Dean's eyes. The heat radiated from his hand and Cas stared at it as he assessed this new sensation. His skin was so much more sensitive now he was human, and Cas had to fight to stop his eyes fluttering closed at Dean's touch.
Lots of love and thanks to the awesome Masonic for making me laugh, fixing my mistakes, and never yelling at me when I choose to keep any of them 😉
"-no Cas! I haven't slept. I've been up all night, and I need to talk to him. I can't just pretend I don't know what he did for me. I need to
he wants. Do you remember the first person you slept with, Sam? Remember how dewy eyed and delusional you were about them? Cas is brand new."
He was screwing some woman in the back of Baby and half way through he opened his eyes and she was actually a corpse, her skin grey and cold. Dream Dean was scrabbling away frantically as she stumbled after him screaming at him, demanding to know why everything he touches turns to ashes.
Cas reached down between them, his hand shaking as it wrapped around Dean's length, fingers fluttering along it, making Dean's breath catch in his throat. Dean didn't know if it was Cas' nerves, or if he'd got him so close to coming so many times with his mouth and fingers that Cas' nervous system was just overloaded.
"Hell really fucked me up," Dean admitted. "Not that I was a fan of torture before, but I wasn't adverse to some tying up, a little spanking, some… playing. You haven't lived until you've had someone on their knees, begging-"
Saying no to kissing Dean was torture. It went against everything in him, but one of them had to keep their heads.
"You have a lot of making up to do - not just to me," she said to Cas, who nodded readily in agreement.
"Maybe talking to Sam and Eileen will help to convince you that we're not insane," Dean offered, opening the door for Kate to step out into the hallway.
He pulled his knee up underneath him and turned to look at Cas properly. He was staring straight ahead at the blank TV screen, no expression at all on his face.
"Do you think Jack somehow created this whole place while Amara wasn't looking?" Cas asked as they drove along the pebbled lake edge. It was a perfect, beautiful sight  and it made him think of how much Jack would have loved to be here with them.
Cas didn't have a chance to answer before Dean stepped back out into the room to the sound of drunken cheers and greetings from their friends.
Cas hummed thoughtfully. “It is very comfortable. Egyptian cotton sheets, pillow-top mattress. Can you really compete?”
“Dean,” Sam said, dawning horror spreading overtaking his features, horror and recrimination evident in his voice. “You… you meant to die? You meant to leave me?”
Their hug was brief but heartfelt, but his eyes never left Cas', drawn to him like he was under some sort of spell, as if his connection to Cas was more important to him than the air he was sucking into his lungs.
"How come everything becomes less confusing the moment I put my arms around you?" Cas murmured, echoing the same thought that was going through Dean's mind.
Cas was hard-wired for rejection, but he wasn’t sure how he would have coped if Dean had pushed him away. Thankful that Dean trusted him enough, needed him enough to let him this close, he stroked his back with one hand, while the other buried itself in his hair, massaging soothingly as Dean’s tears fell, soaking into his collar.
"Just… just let me hold you for one minute and I'll never do this again. I promise. I don't have the right to do this, and I promise I'll stop. One more minute and you'll never have to deal with this side of me again, I swear. I'm sorry—
Cas’ tongue slowed and finally, with one last incredible swipe, he lifted his mouth from Dean’s damp skin. He blew softly and the sudden sensation of cold made Dean’s entire body shiver as he let out a gasp.
What Cas didn’t mention was that it had taken considerable persuasion, bribery, and blackmail to get it done, and that he’d had three different covens on three different continents add their own protections to it. It warded against mind control, possession, curses and even had a spell woven into it that would speed up healing. It was Cas’ way of making up for the fact that he couldn’t heal him, couldn’t protect him, couldn’t bring him back from death anymore. It was a drop in the ocean, really, but if it helped at all, Cas had been willing to rack up as many debts as necessary to do it.
"Cas!" Sam and Eileen both greeted him warmly, gesturing for him to sit down on the cushioned bench next to Dean.
"Eileen," Dean murmured, reaching out to tap her hand to get her attention. She looked up, a kind smile on her face. "I'm sorry. What I did was thoughtless. I never meant to hurt you."
Things weren’t normal. Everything was upside down. He’d kissed his best friend, and if Cas hadn’t had the presence of mind to stop him when he did, Dean would have done far more than just kiss him. Was Cas even interested in that? He'd said he loved him, but love didn’t equal sex. He’d never seen him interested in a guy before, but then he’d barely been interested in women either, for the most part at least. Was he only interested now because he was suddenly chock-full of human urges and raging hormones that his Grace could no longer suppress?
"It doesn't matter now. It didn't work - it couldn’t work. The point is that I'm not a danger to anyone now. But if you're worried, I understand and I can go back to my apartment. It’s late and we can talk after we’ve rested."
Cas scowled at the black printed letters in front of him. "It either says that we have to sacrifice a chicken, or give away a penis. I'm unsure how to do either of those things while trapped in this room."
Dean took in a deep breath and tried not to think about how it must be for Cas to suddenly be able to feel all of this, all at once, with only a smattering of Grace to dampen it down.
Cas dropped kisses on the top of Dean's head, then leaned back so he could drop them on his forehead, his wet cheeks, the tip of his nose, then finally his mouth.
Warning: This chapter has (non-graphic) mentions of past, potentially underage sex-work. It's a bit rough going, but I need to show the depth Dean has - he's not all Baby, women and pie. I promise our boys will get their happy ending.
like it was. He felt sexy and wanted, and he hadn't ever felt like that in his life before. When Cas sat on the edge of the bed and Dean immediately wrapped his arm around his waist, pulling him into his arms, that didn't feel fake either.
"Dicks? He made Angels complete dicks." Dean seemed to register that he was saying this to a group of Angels only when all three of them turned to him with various levels of annoyance clearly written on their faces. Dean caught Cas' eye and shrugged unapologetically.
Would it really be such an awful thing if they disappeared for ten minutes? Twenty at most? Would anyone even notice? Dean needed this, needed something to ground him, reassure him.
Chuck leaned over the table and scooped his finger through the mound of rapidly cooling mashed potato, bringing some to his mouth to taste. He looked up at Dean, reading his momentarily unguarded expression of shame correctly and his eyes widened in understanding.
Cas eyed him knowingly and the fingers that were lazily running up and down Dean’s arm started sparking again. Much stronger, thicker ribbons of light were pouring into him, making his muscles twitch and jump, like those ridiculous electric muscle stimulation pads Sam had once tried in a half assed attempt to get fit without any work a few years ago. But while those had been painful (yes, Dean had sneakily had a go), this was more like his skin was being brought to life rather than merely shocked. His arm tingled, and his nerves seemed to fizz and vibrate, although try as he might, Dean couldn’t see any physical difference in his actual arm.
Dean rolled his eyes. It wasn't the first time James had offered, and once or twice Dean had actually considered taking him up on it. He was a good looking guy, pretty funny if you caught him when he was sober, and Dean had to admit the accent was a turn-on. But even if Dean
"Why don't you taste for yourself?" His eyes glinted, his eyebrow arched, his entire focus on Dean's mouth, hot and wet around his fingers.
His hands stroked desperately, his mouth dropping kisses onto the top of Cas' head as if he was so eager to soothe him, he just couldn't stop himself.
Dean nodded in silence, at least acknowledging him if nothing else. They'd reached a river and he wound his window down to hear the roaring of a mini-waterfall just to the right of them, so close Dean could almost reach the water with his fingers.
“Cas… did you see…? Of course you did. Look man, it’s not what it looked like. I wouldn’t… I didn’t…”
"Look, can we leave the kink shaming for our next family gathering? Maybe save something for Christmas?"
"That would be a very bad idea," he said to her, pulling Cas even closer into him, as if trying to reassure Cas that it was him he wanted. His hold was almost possessive and Cas desperately wanted to let go and revel in it.
"Dean!" Claire called out, the first to spot him. He forced a smile onto his face and if he hugged Claire a tiny bit too tightly as he took in a shaky breath, she didn't point it out or make a big deal of it. Instead she poured him a glass of whisky from the crystal decanter that always made him feel pretentious, and patted the seat next to her.
The gentle movements started again and Dean wondered if it was possible for him to come without being touched at all, just from being this close to Cas while he was doing this.
Cas caught the sheepish look on Dean's face, like he knew he shouldn't have said that out loud, and his heart stuttered in his chest. Staying apart wasn't ever going to help him get over Dean. He would be in love with him in this world, and in the next. He knew that now. All he could do was bear it.
"I swear that when all this is all over, I'm taking you back to my bed and I'm not letting you out of it for a week."
The single shapeshifter Dean had gone after had turned out to be not one but three, and he'd very nearly got his head hacked off with a meat cleaver for his troubles. But then, it wasn't the first time. No need to mention it to Sammy and get him nagging at him again. The cuts and bruises on his chest and hip were enough to remind him that he'd been a little reckless, he didn't need his brother joining in with reminders too. It was going to take him a while to heal up - he wasn't as young as he used to be and he couldn't just shrug off injuries like he once could.
Cas' sigh was long-suffering. "I can't say I know what's going on with us, Dean, but I can say that I wasn't expecting it, I'm not expecting it even now. Every time I see you I expect it,
Cas, because who could deny the images that played in his mind as he touched himself in the shower or in his bed? But tonight Cas just
said that. I've always known that this wasn't going to end in wedding vows and His and His matching bathroom towels. I don't know what you were getting out of this, but exploring my sexuality was fun. Exploring it with someone I trusted, someone who wasn't going to tie me to a chair and try to kill me - that was even more fun. It didn't stop being fun - we were absolutely fine until Chuck spewed his crap at you and you chose to believe it all."
"So I'm not leaving, and you're not letting me leave either. Can you trust that I'm here for good, that I meant what I said when I said I was yours? That won't change, Dean. Nothing will change that."
"Dean…" Cas stepped closer, grabbing hold of Dean's hips and pulling him towards him by his belt loops until he was so close that his firmly folded arms pressed awkwardly against Cas' chest. "You
It normally took Dean a moment or two to come to his senses when he woke up in the bunker. The lack of windows sometimes made it difficult to tell night from day and his first move was usually to reach for his phone. This time, however, he was instantly aware of his surroundings. Cas had turned over in the night and had burrowed into him again, his head under his chin and his arms wrapped tightly around his waist.
Ten minutes later, he was padding into the main room to greet Cas with a manly, unemotional, pat on the back. He could totally do this.
Dean stared at Cas in the darkness, utterly perplexed. Then he decided to ignore what Cas' body language was saying, instead deciding to go with his quite recent knowledge that Cas liked cuddles pretty much whatever was wrong with him, he scooted towards Cas. Wrapping his arms around him, he yanked him backwards across the bed, holding him tightly against his chest.
Cas was lifting Dean’s hand, raising it until his wrist was at Cas’ mouth. Holding his gaze, Cas pressed a chaste kiss to Dean’s oversensitive skin and Dean bit back the moan that was rising in his throat. This touch was different, still intense, but like all the little sparks of pleasure were starting at Cas' lips and spreading out all over his body, right down to his toes. Cas pressed another kiss to his wrist.
After Cas wasted most of the song stiffly moving out of time, looking increasingly more and more uncomfortable, he raised pleading eyes to Dean.
There was a silence and Dean winced in anticipation of the shutdown he deserved. He sank further under the covers, as if it made him somehow disappear, even though he’d taken his phone under with him.
Chuck was staring intently at Dean, taking in his clenched teeth, his set jaw, the tick that was twitching in his cheek that only came into being when he was really riled.
"I was hurtin' then too," Dean murmured absently, his concentration still on Cas, who was laughing at the victory dance Kate was doing, and had started joining in with it, big goof that he was with a couple of drinks in him.
"I've done so many things," he said, ignoring the tightness and trying to take in a deep breath. He felt sick. He couldn't do this.
"This isn't going to be weird, okay?" Dean didn't think he could stand it if Cas went cold on him now.
“It’s not a… I can’t believe you’ve not seen Elf! I feel like I’ve left your education severely lacking. It’s only a few weeks until Christmas - it’ll be on Netflix! We’ll have a Christmas film night!”
Sam's eyebrows practically disappeared into his hairline and he gave Dean a look that very clearly said, 'Are you fucking kidding me?!'
The sky flashed above them with another fork of lightning, then another. The rain was so heavy that it was bouncing back up off the road they were driving down, so dense it was like a sheet in front of them. Dean could only see a couple of meters in front of him and was now crawling along the road, back in the direction of the bar and Bobby, who could hopefully throw some (literal) light on the situation.
awake, he slept ridiculously soundly for a man with intimate knowledge of what was out there to go bump in the night.
Cas smiled at him - it was only the second time all day that Dean had spoken specifically to him. "I think that’s where my fondness for cats stems from."
“I won't stop,” Dean vowed. He didn’t think he could if he wanted. "Say it, Cas. Tell me." It was selfish when he couldn’t say it himself, but he needed to hear it again.
Dean wanted to lean into Cas, to close the gap and draw comfort from him. But he couldn't. He didn't deserve to.
Dean folded his arms and settled himself against the counter, as if readying himself to be entertained. He really was a dick sometimes.
The grass on the riverbank was soft and warm, tickling his skin. Not caring that he was stark naked (who was there to object anyway?), Dean lay on his back in the sun, letting the sun and wind dry his body.
“Sorry Sam, you’re going back!” Jack said, and then with a click of his fingers, everything faded to black.
Dean could feel the rage rising to replace the hope, fighting with the despair that was already filling him, overwhelming his senses. His hands clenched into fists as his body tensed, preparing to release weeks of pent up frustration and aggression. It wouldn't be an evenly matched fight he knew, but he was fairly certain he'd get in a good few swipes with his blade before she took him out.
no orders. When Castiel was in Heaven he was trying to broker a deal between us and 'Jack' to get us off our backsides and back in the game. Then he chose to leave us in the lurch…"
Cas wondered briefly if this was his Hell. Punishment for all his sins - a lifetime on earth of being around Dean Winchester and never actually getting to be with him.
"If you've never had a blowjob before, you're going to need more than a quickie in the shower for your first one. A guy's first blowjob is special, man! Maybe
"We need to get ready anyway," Cas protested weakly and Dean groaned into his neck when Cas scraped blunt nails down his sides.
The beauty of the sky, framed by water and trees and hills - it made his problems feel momentarily insignificant.
"Still no!" Cas ground out. "You're just trying to live out your Dirty Dancing, Patrick Swayze fantasies!"
Patience didn't take her eyes off Dean. Fumbling in her pocket, she pulled out a bottle of holy water and splashed it straight in Dean's face.
Cas was going to say no, point out that they should be nowhere near a bed together, but he was bone weary and all his resolve was gone. He wanted to be with Dean so much and he was done fighting against it. Whatever happened, he would deal with his emotions later.
Dean swore under his breath and threw open the car door, nearly taking out Mrs Findley who was taking Jasper on his morning walk.
As Cas recalled, Kate had quite enjoyed their Marvel marathon. They'd stayed up for two nights in a row, munching their way through snacks and drinking far too much wine, debating which hero was most likely to beat the others in a furious head to head battle. Kate had insisted that Captain Marvel would have been rightfully victorious and Cas had been torn between agreeing with her, and standing up for Doctor Strange, who’s confidence and constant sarcastic quips had reminded him of Dean, although he’d insisted that was nothing to do with his reasoning. They’d had fun watching the movies together, but now Kate was looking at him like she wished he'd choked to death on his popcorn.
Usually Dean would be using his hands to grip, cup, scratch, press or tease, but Cas had pinned his hands to the soft pillows above him, and although he wasn't holding them up there now, Dean was absolutely not moving them. Wherever Cas wanted them was where they'd stay. Hell, right now he'd follow any order Cas gave him, verbal or otherwise.
At Sam's words, Dean looked over at his brother, panic in his eyes. Who would have guessed that Dean Winchester of all people would be feeling claustrophobic? Cas wondered if it had happened after or because of the creation of the horrific reinforced box he had planned on sinking himself to the bottom of the ocean in. He'd admitted later that he'd had nightmares about that in the past, and who could blame him?
"Well then you can thank your lucky stars you no longer have to put up with them!" Cas sniped back. But his head was reeling, he felt dizzy and like all his nerves were on fire, and it wasn't from the sudden warmth of being back inside.
"You know we're not buying this house? We're breaking in - there's a big difference," Cas called to Dean as he abandoned the fireplace and poked his head through to look.
"Sam and Eileen looked real happy up there, Cas," he said softly, meaningfully. "I know you're worried about things changing, worried that
Dean rolled his eyes and grabbed at Cas' hands impatiently, taking them roughly in between his own unfairly warm ones, rubbing them briskly to warm them up.
The rich sound of Dean's laughter carried easily to Cas' ears as the little girl asked for 'kisses' and Miracle licked her face with his long, wet, pink tongue. She rolled on the floor in fits of giggles, like it was the most hilarious thing that had ever happened to her, laughing even harder when Miracle bounced around her, picking up on her excitement and wanting to join in. When she sat back up and handed Dean a Barbie Doll to hold, he took it without hesitation, holding it up, and making it say something that had Gertie in more hysterics.
Cas pulled Dean's hand away from his mouth and glared at him. He shoved Dean's hand away from him and folded his arms protectively over his chest.
"I'm pretty sure that none of us turned out the way you wanted," Dean said, reaching and turning to lay a palm flat against Cas' chest, half soothing and half restraining. Cas realised he was trying to deflect Chuck's attention from him.
I've had messages and reviews that genuinely made me burst into happy tears. I love you guys so much.
in you. I thought you were good and kind and benevolent, but you were just… bored. You say I stole him like a child taking my brother's toy, but you were a bored child whose toys weren't interesting enough for him any more. You were setting fire to ants with your magnifying glass just to see what they would do while they burned."
Cas drew a hand slowly down his face. Would Claire want to know how her parents were? Would it help for her to know what they were doing now? Should he try to talk to her, or would it be like offering her scraps and just make everything worse? He felt a lot like he'd chosen one child over another.
Lifting himself onto his stool, Cas warily eyed the food Sam was preparing on the stove in front of him. With humanity very slowly building in him, he wasn't sure if he needed to eat yet or not. He felt queasy, achy, raw and tired, and he imagined this was a bit like how humans felt when they caught the flu. His head hurt and his arm had a scratch on it that he didn't want to waste his remaining Grace on, but it had started itching as it healed and it was tiresome.
Dean's fingers hooked into the top of his jeans and pulled them slowly down, sinking down with them as he did until he was crouched by Cas' feet. Cas swallowed thickly, watching Dean through hooded eyes as he dragged the denim down each leg in turn.
"The snow has cleared," she said finally. "You promised I could meet your family. Will they be coming to the wedding, or will I get to see this beautiful Lake House of Dean's when I meet them?"
"You've got people arriving in-" there was a rustling and the sound of Cas rattling around in a drawer for his watch -"six hours. And
"Hunting ends in tragedy and death, and you know it!" Cas' tone wasn't gentle anymore. "It doesn't matter how careful you are or how much you have to live for—you and Sam left it for just that reason! I can't bring you back again!"
She turned on her heel, seemingly blissfully unaware of the devastation she had left in her wake. Cas raised a shaking hand to cover his mouth, as if that would somehow stop him breaking down in front of everyone.
"I'm your son," Jack said simply, and Dean saw a flash in his eyes that was hard and unmoving. The three year old Nephlim that Dean had worried about handling all this, it seemed that Dean didn't need to have worried, this wasn't the same gentle, awkward kid they'd raised. This wasn't the kid who needed velcro shoes because he couldn't tie laces. This was God, and his word was absolute on this.
Cas pulled back enough to smile dopily up at Dean. He leaned in to kiss him, nearly missing his mouth entirely, his lips landing half on Dean's chin.
tell Cas how he felt about him without the words just getting stuck there, his lips moving, no sound coming out. He couldn’t. But Cas knew, didn’t he? Surely he knew?
"I remember a time when you liked to hear from me. Your voice would be warm and welcoming. You'd ask how I was…"
"You're so fucking beautiful," Dean told him, every emotion he was feeling in his voice. He loved the sharp pull of Cas' fingers, tangled in his hair. Then finally, he slid his hands under Cas' ass, tipping his hips up towards him.
"Have you ever tried to write a story?" Chuck asked. "Any of you? Where you have this one character who just won't do what they're told and they go around destroying every single plot device you've put in place? You were my greatest disappointment, Castiel."
"I think you'll survive." Cas was smiling, eyes crinkled, pearly white teeth showing. It was absolutely fucking gorgeous.
"Have you decided what you want?" Kate had appeared silently next to their table and her knowing look made Dean wonder just how much she knew. Torn between his innate need to stake his claim, and his conditioned urge to hide, Dean pulled his hand out from underneath Cas' to lift his drink to his lips.
his thoughts. It was made all the more ridiculous when Dean compared it to his behaviour with anyone else he'd ever fancied, where he'd always been the one to keep his emotions in check. Controlled, calm, collected, never needy - who he had become since he'd kissed Cas was barely recognisable and it needed to stop.
"Of course he is." Chuck said, nodding exaggeratedly with wide eyed condescension. "Heard from your little Ray of Sunshine lately?"
"I'll help you sleep," Dean vowed, and to Cas' ears it sounded like Dean thought he was a knight that had accepted a quest, and on his very honour he would fulfil it.
Cas knew he shouldn't be hard right now, knew it wasn't why they were actually going to bed together - he had to explain to Dean. But when Dean drew the zip down with deliberate slowness, brushing lightly and inadvertently over his aching cock, Cas' fingers clenched on Dean’s shoulders as a shock of pleasure shot through him. He sucked in a shaky breath of air.
Another sharp tug had Cas reaching out blindly, grasping Dean’s shirt tightly in his fists, clinging on for all he was worth, partly so he didn't overbalance and partly because he needed something solid to ground him. His breath was coming in audible pants, his body almost constantly shuddering now. He'd been fighting an erection from the moment Dean had pressed him into the door earlier, but now he was properly hard and he desperately hoped that Dean wouldn't notice.
Dean had wrapped multiple items together, and when Cas tore the paper, several things fell into his lap. Dean’s eyes lit up in excitement, his own woes seemingly forgotten in an instant as he was overtaken by the thrill of Cas finally seeing what he'd got for him.
"You said this was dangerous," Dean reminded him. Potentially fatal if Dean's heart-rate was any indication. It was practically pounding out of his chest.
"I like it here," Dean said, his breath tickling the back of Cas' neck. "We could just forget about the world. Stay here. Pretend today never happened."
Arms folded, Claire responded to Dean's order without question and stalked off towards her girlfriend. He had no idea how Dean managed to do that.
"Did you know that after I put you back together, I had to repaint each and every freckle back onto your skin?" Cas paused, looking like he was debating whether or not to keep talking. "Only, I sort of messed up.”
He knew she was there before she spoke. Stepping over to his crumpled naked body, she dropped to her knees in the dirt next to him.
Dean could think of nothing but bucking up against Cas, lifting his hips and closing the gap between them, where Cas' ass was hovering just an inch above his lap. If Cas sat down exactly where he was, he'd be right on Dean's rock hard cock.
"Promise me…" Dean repeated, his Adam's apple bobbing as he swallowed, his gaze dropping to Cas’ mouth.
Kate had actually surprised Dean today with how pleasant she was when she wasn't hanging all over Cas. That being said, he was actually more than a little concerned that she was trying to live vicariously through him, given the amount of interest she was showing in his and Cas' now likely non-existent sex life. She'd asked a lot of questions and left Dean feeling a little bit like his brain had just been ransacked by a particularly thorough and messy burglar, and he'd never been more convinced that she fancied his ex-angel friend.
"I want to fuck you until you can't fucking walk. I want to make you moan my name around my cock." Dean watched Cas' unreadable expression and wanted to shake a reaction from him. Why wasn't he angry?
"I know it doesn't help you right now, but I swear to you that they'll pay for what they did, Dean. They won't get away with it. They can't stay in hiding forever, and I am going to burn them from existence. They had no right to ever touch him."
Cas let his gaze drift over Dean's face and he was surprised to see the undisguised pain in his moss-coloured eyes as Dean looked back at him. Their eyes locked and held for a second too long and Cas swallowed. He couldn't read Dean's face or work out what he was thinking, but the dark shadows underneath his eyes showed just how badly he'd been sleeping - Sam wasn't lying about that. Had he been like this before Cas had arrived, or had Cas done this to him? A pang of guilt hit him.
Kate's eyes narrowed, her lips pressing together in annoyance. Rowena began nodding to herself, looking like the cat who had got the cream, and then some.
"We can always do this again - we don't have to fit everything into one night." Cas sounded unsure for the first time since they'd started this, insecure even though he was on top of Dean, pinning him down, in control.
The kiss was hard, almost punishing in it’s frustration and Dean wasn't kissing him back - his lips were frozen in a hard, firm line, hands braced against his chest. He wasn't pushing him away or even holding him back, just putting up an unconscious barrier. When Cas finally pulled back his eyes were drawn to Dean's lips, swollen from the bruising kisses and turned down in disapproval.
Panic was overtaking him now, seeping through his body, the drumming in his ears deafening him to anything else, although he registered in the back of his mind that Dean was saying
It was probably for the best. Dean never failed to get a boner when Cas started throwing him around, and that was exactly the sort of situation he was trying to avoid. Instead he padded into the bathroom, putting space between them while he tried to steer his mind towards less x-rated thoughts.
Three days was as long as Cas managed to last before, in desperation, he walked out of the bunker and rented the first apartment he was offered. It had a shower, a bed and most importantly it was void of persistent hunters and their personal space issues. Oh, the irony.
"No. I know what you're gonna say, Cas and I don't want to hear it. Chuck was wrong - I'm not… look, he was wrong, alright?"
"Some of us here aren't writing our own stories," he said, looking around the room at the room full of people. "I can sense the manipulation, and
"Give her some space for now," Dean advised, reading him like a book. "And remember later? Later is what we hang on to today, okay? Whatever happens, we're gonna end today naked in bed together. The things I'm going to do to you later, Cas… you won't be able to form a single thought to worry about any of this."
Cas had practiced this. He could do this. It would be easy. He would use his words and ask for what he wanted—what he
"And what if we never leave each other's sides? What if we end up in Heaven together for an Eternity and you never get him?"
Not seeing Cas was painful, but they texted almost every day, and Dean clung on to that. He didn't flirt, he didn't push and he didn't ask to see Cas again, despite their agreement that he would. He was terrified he was going to chase Cas away, so he held back. Most importantly, he never ever texted Cas when he was drunk, which, to Sam's often vocalised disapproval, was most nights.
He'd vowed to kiss Cas any time he asked and that was a promise he would thoroughly enjoy never, ever breaking.
For a moment Dean's expression was frozen, then all at once he was throwing his head back, laughing so loudly that everyone stopped what they were doing to look at him. He clutched his stomach as he bent double, and Cas stared at him, utterly perplexed.
“I was never interested in strangers,” Cas shrugged. “I felt sexual attraction - connections to… to people. But not any that I could act on. I'm not asexual, Dean.”
"What makes you think neither of them are mine?" Dean asked defensively. He grabbed a couple of cold beers and handed one to Cas. "I buy food."
"I'm not avoiding you," Dean denied, leaning one hip against the door frame in a position that exuded attitude and insolence.
The mouth on his skin wasn't gentle—little nips and bites making Dean's breath catch and his cock twitch in his jeans; Cas' hands pushed impatiently at the material, like he wasn't above tearing it from Dean's body entirely, just to get it out of his way.
Maybe after a quick fuck, they'd both have agreed to watch The Witcher with him - he was only on the second episode. He could start over. Maybe he should just have screwed James there and then, on that sofa that had seen more than a little action over the years. What were the chances of anyone finding out, really? He needed to take the edge off this thing he had for Cas and maybe that was the way?
"Kate is planning on going tomorrow night - it's her weekend without the children, and she did ask if I wanted to join her," Cas mused thoughtfully.
"Cas," Dean hissed his name, threading his fingers through his hair. "I need you. Show me I'm not… not
“There’s nothing special about any of you," he slurred. His laugh was a wet gurgle. “Haven't you seen it yet? I made you special, but without me you people are nothing!”
"I can't turn back from this," Dean rasped urgently—desperately. "If we do this, I can't just let go, I can't… this changes things, Cas. I can't have you like this once or twice and then stop, and just pretend it never happened. You're under my skin, man. I can't just make that stop—I can’t even pretend I can anymore."
The shower just reminded him of everything he didn't need to be reminded of. He wondered if he should be thankful they hadn't had more sex to ruin other everyday activities for him. The fresh clothes did make him feel a little bit better, and in the ten minutes he'd been gone, Kate had dug into tidying his apartment, which Cas had been too down to do. It had been strewn with trash, food packets that he hadn't bothered to put in the bin and leftover food he hadn't been able to force down. It looked like a different place entirely by the time she'd finished.
"Yeah," Dean nodded in agreement. "And you looked like you were sitting there with a stick up your ass."
Sam shifted his feet behind him. "It's a bit spur of the moment, isn't it? We fall out and suddenly you've found a house?"
There was a moment where all Dean could feel was Cas' breath against his lips. They were so close that it would only take the smallest movement and they would be kissing. One tiny movement.
Kate appeared next to them with the ridiculously alcoholic coffee, cream and bowl of packeted sugar.
"You were protecting Sam. You've always protected Sam." Cas had moved closer, his shoulder brushing against Dean's.
"Chuck, no one gives a rats ass about your book," Dean ground out, still looking shaken from Chuck's announcement.
"That's adorable. I always knew you'd be an awesome dad." Dean wasn't blowing smoke up his ass - Sam had always been good at anything he tried his hand at, but he was made to be a husband and father - protective, kind, took just the right amount of shit before getting ratty. He'd been practicing on Dean, keeping him in line and out of real trouble for years.
"You hid Dean's misery from me, so I wouldn't try to save him, so he would end up dead and in Heaven with you sooner!"
“It was sex. Twice. Afterwards I showered, and shortly after that, I was stabbed. There was no cuddling. I'd have to feel safe with someone to let my guard down enough for that.”
"Fresh eggs every morning sounds real good," he found himself saying with not even a hint of passive aggressive sarcasm. "Why not?"
Despite Cas' bravado, Dean knew him well enough to be able to see how nervous he was. The hands that had found their way back to pulling up that damned t-shirt were trembling again, even while his eyes challenged him. He did his best to hide it, but Dean knew that underneath it all Cas was a ball of emotion. This was anything but casual for him, which was another reason why Dean had to take things slow. He owed him that.
Maybe Cas wasn't the right person to approach him? For a moment last night, when Dean had held him in his arms, it had felt so close to coming home that he could have wept from the sheer relief of it. But as always with Dean Winchester, the happy moments were fleeting and inconsistent, like the moment Dean became aware of their very existence he banished them away, never allowing himself more than a moment of happiness. Last night, just minutes after pulling him close, Dean had barely been able to look at him without trembling in anger. In contrast, Dean's regard of his brother was unwavering and constant - he needed to get Sam on board.
"Get off me!" Dean snarled, shaking Cas off him roughly. The sudden ice cold anger in his voice chilled Cas to the bone. It was like, with just a handful of words from Chuck,
Except for that time you were with me." Protectiveness warred with arousal, and Dean experienced an odd mix of wanting to wrap Cas up, making him feel safe and warm, and wanting to press him up against that tiled shower wall and fuck him into next week.
Cas turned away, walking to the other side of the room, putting more space between them as he silently sent up a prayer. After a moment, Dean turned, panic in his voice.
“Cas told me to expect you!” she greeted with a friendly smile. “I’ve saved the best table for you guys. It's really private - only the fish can nosy at you there."
"You'll sleep far better in that cloud bed of yours than you will in mine at the bunker. Or, you know, any of the beds at the bunker at all," he added hastily, backtracking on how presumptuous he sounded. "I'm not saying you would want to sleep in my bed, but us, uh, being close… that worked pretty well last night. For your sleeping."
It had been a while since Cas had been completely powerless and he hated how useless he felt. If he couldn't work out a way to get Dean to change how he lived his life, chances were that he was going to die on another hunt, sooner rather than later. Right now Cas truly was no more useful than a baby in a trench coat, so there would be no bringing him back a second time. Third time. Fourth? Alright, maybe Jack did have a point about him interfering.
While Cas was gingerly looking through the tins before moving on to a downstairs toilet, also in desperate need of updating, Dean disappeared upstairs.
be the one sitting with Dean, laughing with him, leaning into him, touching his arm as they talked. He'd be the one who Dean was smiling at with that crinkle at the edge of his eyes that made Cas melt every single fucking time. He'd be the one leading Dean around a big shelf full of books, just out of sight and—
He wasn't in control. He wanted to scream and more than that, he wanted to spin Dean around and shove him against the door that he was himself trapped against. He needed to kiss him. Not just kiss him, Cas wanted to do so much more than that - he wanted to hold him in place and fuck him until he couldn't remember his own name, let alone what they had been talking about. Cas bit back an oath and turned his head away, his hands clenching in his effort to control himself.
"There's no happy ending to factor anything into anymore!" Dean shouted so loudly that his voice seemed to bounce and echo against the mountains around them. "It's gone! It's over!
Cas had been running for a good seven or eight minutes solidly, his foot thuds on the pavement an oddly comforting sound, the wind drying the tears on his cheeks as it whipped his face. The panic was receding, despair taking its place. This was worse than when Dean had blamed him for Mary, this he couldn't come back from. He couldn't keep piecing himself back together again.
He bent to kiss Cas' mouth, then his jaw, then that spot just behind his ear that he now knew would make Cas shudder and shiver against him.
“There’s nothing wrong with you,” Cas pressed his forehead to Dean’s, closing his eyes tight against what Dean guessed was the same wave of emotion that he was riding. “Not one single thing, Dean.”
"Okay, so which cowboy movie do you think I should start with? Picking a favourite might take so long you'll be asleep before I start."
"Not to up the 'gay' in the room even more," Claire announced a few seconds later, "but we wanted to let everyone know that Kaia and I… we're engaged."
Dean smiled. It was a small smile, but after all the fake ones he'd flashed earlier, it made Cas' heart sing to see it.
"I'm a man," Cas offered dazedly. He still wanted to wallow, and Kate was entirely too bouncy to wallow with.
Dean lifted his head and took in the girls wine glasses, both almost full to the brim still, condensation collecting in tiny beads on the outside.
shit. And frankly, I don’t think he believes most of what I’m saying, but we’ve agreed to work in metaphors.”
Cas' eyes crinkled in a smile so large that it was all teeth and gums. Dean hadn't said the words, but Cas was sharp and perceptive—he knew.
Dean opened his eyes to look at Cas, watchful and wary, like a dog that had been kicked one too many times and had finally given up on the entire human race.
The plan, yes. Where he stood back and let Dean do all the dirty work. Only the plan seemed insignificant now he was watching Chuck tear into Dean, undoing any and all good that they had managed to do together since Cas came back.
Cas seemed to perk up at this. Judging by his contented sigh, he was considerably happier with this plan than he had been with the boring him to sleep one.
Cas nodded again, hiding a smile behind his hand. They had slept in the middle of the bed last night, wrapped around each other, so Cas was unsure how the size of the bed would matter at all. If they slept like that again, a single bed would have room to spare.
Dean threw back the blankets, utterly unashamed of the tent in his boxers, despite Cas' eyes on him. He walked over to his chest of drawers and started digging through it.
for Dean to sit at the same time, but over the past month they'd got into a routine where Dean would sit, and his ridiculously sensory-seeking boyfriend would crawl into his lap, resting his head on Dean's knee. He would angle his neck so it was in the perfect position for Dean to stroke and tickle with his fingertips, and they’d go through the entire film with Cas sighing quietly and contentedly under his hands.
"Popcorn?" he asked, opening a Cupboard and spotting some microwave bags. "We have salty, because that's the best kind; and sweet, because Eileen clearly has no taste."
"Well, I don't know if he said it, but thank you," Sam said, watching him chew. "He's been taking a lot of risks…"
Reaching out, Cas allowed himself to run his knuckles down Dean’s cheek in a caress. It wasn’t a kiss and it wasn’t enough, but as Dean leaned into his touch, Cas felt his lips curving up in a smile.
. Cas was incoherently murmuring Dean's name against his skin, clinging to him with his free arm wrapped around Dean's neck.
"'All you have to do is close your eyes, and just reach out your hands,'" Dean sang softly along with the song into his ear, and with a small groan Cas obediently closed his eyes.
“Yet here you all are, living your tragically mundane lives, yearning for the days where I injected a bit of spice into them.” Chuck walked over to the table, reaching across it to pull a piece of steaming turkey off the cooked bird. He popped it into his mouth, chewing slowly.
"Even if I did want to draw attention to myself with something like that, there's no soul to bring back! He's gone!"
“Cas, what are you wearing?” Eileen asked, obviously having the same sort of thoughts Dean was having about what Cas may have spent the night doing, although Dean hoped not quite as vivid and filthy as his thoughts had been.
Dean didn't think it was wise for him to point out that if Cas hadn't opened the door to his pain in the ass of a friend earlier today, they could have been on their second or third round by now.
"Alright, Fight Club," Dean said, putting himself between them. "Kiddies are present and Cas really doesn't deserve this. Lay off the Angel."
Cas fixed his most exasperated look on Dean, and then seeming to have become annoyed with his own bullheadedness, he sighed resignedly, conceding that Dean might have a point. He started to shrug out of his coat, glaring at Dean as he did.
Dean shrugged off his coat in the back room, greeted the guys and took the beer that Luke was holding out to him. He was sure he’d participated in some sort of banter, because he could remember laughing, but he couldn’t have recalled what was said if his life depended on it. He just wasn’t in the right headspace. Then he was up onstage, guitar in his hands, performing to the cheers of the already half drunk audience.
"You tried to set fire to his business and you punched him in the face! I had to agree to let him come to the wedding to placate him!"
didn't sound like some cheesy tale of romance come true, did it? It was the first time in his life that Cas wished his life were a predictable, trashy romance novel—the kind you picked up for a dollar from the bargain bin, a woman on the front cover with a heaving bosom and a shirtless man with perfect abs wrapping her up in his steely embrace. Not that Cas would ever admit to anyone that he sometimes bought and read them.
Kate’s hands were still on his arms, and he shrugged her off angrily, finally past being tactful or polite, not caring when Kate let out a small noise of surprise and stepped back.
They shared a long look that Dean wished was more, then resolutely their hands untangled and they broke apart to greet their friends like everything was normal.
"The concept of days of the week and calendar months is a relatively new one. I was around in the days when your ancestors had gills, Dean."
“You can't blame him,” Sam said, leaping to Dean's defence, dragging his eyes away from Cas' shimmering wings to his furious face. “It was an accident.”
Dean’s quiet sigh was enough of an answer by itself, but Dean nodded anyway and flashed Cas a smile. It didn’t reassure Cas at all.
"Nice crop-top, Sammy!" Dean grinned, feeling in his pockets for his phone to take a picture. "Dammit. I left it in the kitchen!"
Dean laughed. "I’ll take that as a hint and get on with it. Well done again Sammy. Proud of you." He pulled Sam in for a hug, then Eileen, and gave the rest of the group a wave before heading back for the stage. He was halfway across the room before a familiar voice stopped him.
Dean was already turned away, leaning on the counter with both hands, his back bent, his face hidden.
"Do you trust me?" Dean murmured in his ear again, his tone utterly demanding and so fucking sexy that Cas had to fight an audible groan.
There was a long silence and Dean wondered if he was supposed to still be touching himself, or awaiting instructions. Should he say something? What did Cas find sexy? Why was Cas the one person who could make him feel inept at this shit?
The journey home from the club took longer than any of them had thought it would. Dean had had too much alcohol and couldn't drive, and while walking with Cas should have taken less than fifteen minutes, Cas kept stopping to touch every plant, every tree, to sit on every single bench and stroke each and every fucking cat.
"Fuck, yes." There had been no question really. Dean was never going to stop Cas, and educating him in this moment just wasn't going to happen. Consequences be damned.
Dean helped Cas shower and scrub all the dried-on paint off his skin, then found him his most comfortable t-shirt and sweatpants to change into. Cas, still practically bouncing off the walls, chattered non-stop the entire time. Every thought that came into his head was relentlessly verbalized, and most of them were embarrassingly romantic and soppy. Dean filed them all away in the back of his mind to play back later—when Kate wasn't standing outside the door, offering her ‘support’ every few minutes.
Christmas in itself was fine, and he was actually cross with himself for allowing his own jealousy and insecurities to ruin this specific one. One thing he had learned long ago though, was that no one—human, angel, or demon—could control their own emotions. You could control how you responded to them, but beating yourself up for how you felt wouldn’t help anyone.
"No," Cas whimpered. "The Poughkeepsie move is great, but I don't think either of us are, um, flexible enough for it. I'm sorry."
Cas lost count of the times he checked his phone that night. When it hit 3am and he was still waiting for a reply, he stomped across his apartment to the microwave, opened the door to it and shut his phone inside so he couldn't check it for the hundredth time. He was tempted to turn it on and watch his phone explode.
“How the fuck can you stop anything happening to him?” Dean hissed. “You couldn’t even stop him getting fucking drugged!”
And with that, Cas was back to sitting on the bed. The only difference this time was that Cas was no longer keeping to his side - their arms were brushing, their legs touched.
"I mean, if you had this sexual superpower, why weren’t you in bars every night getting laid? I sure would've been.”
Cas’ eyes softened, and his mouth broke into one of his rare smiles. Dean found himself smiling back. It was going to be okay. Cas would make it okay.
"I never knew being able to touch you would feel like this," Cas pulled back to whisper against his lips. Then all thought left Dean's head as Cas slid one hand under the elastic of his waistband.
"Oh, that's where you got to! Sneaky McSneakerson, toddling off to get Dean and Cas!" He blew a raspberry on his son’s belly as he scooped him up and dropped him into the cot.
“Hang on,” he murmured, sliding his hand around the back of Dean’s neck to steady himself, before dropping easily to kneel between Dean’s legs. He wrapped his arms around Dean’s waist, and Dean immediately pulled him close, burying his nose in his neck. Cas melted into his arms, a whimper escaping his throat as relief and pent up emotion overwhelmed him.
Here, like this, Cas was different and Dean had no idea how to handle it. He wasn't just what you could see, touch and hear - he exuded something more than that, he radiated a feeling that enveloped Dean from head to toe. Power filled the air around him, beating with anger, with sadness, with disappointment and the dull ache of a pain felt for far too long. It was enough to take Dean's breath away.
It wasn't a public declaration, it wasn't the words he wanted to say out loud so much that he ached with it, but he was laying his soul bare in front of every living person he knew, in front of family and friends alike—in front of the man he knew he was going to propose to one day soon. And it had him forcing his trembling hands under control, before he ruined the song entirely.
"Alright, food." He rifled through the leftovers in the refrigerator. A nice ham sandwich would probably do wonders for Cas right now, and if he couldn’t manage that, then maybe some soup. He heated the soup and set about buttering the bread and slicing up the ham. Politeness dictated that he should offer Kate something, but he wasn’t having any himself and to be brutally honest, he worried that if he fed her, she might stay all night.
"Okay?" he agreed, quite obviously having no idea what he was agreeing to, which just served to frustrate Cas even more.
"Not yet," Sam said, amusing himself so much that he had to turn away and open the fridge, shoving his head inside to try to hide the laughter.
Dean's fingers tore into the pretty green wrapping paper, that had been chosen purely because everything green reminded him (rather embarrassingly) of Dean's eyes. Cas' fingers went numb as he looked on, and he stopped nervously picking at the cellotape on his own gift, thinking that for Dean's birthday, the hunter would be getting gift cards.
It was several minutes of teasing and stroking, before Dean applied any pressure at all. Feeling Cas tense momentarily, Dean ducked his head low over his cock and let his mouth trace over it from base to tip, barely touching, just letting his breath ghost over it. On his third pass, he used the very tip of his tongue, tracing a long, thin wet path right to the tip, where he dipped his tongue into the slit, suppressing a chuckle when Cas let out a strangled sound. He loved having Cas like this, spread in front of him, so very responsive and eager.
He should have talked to Claire a long time ago, but even if he had, what on Earth could he have said?
Dean lifted his hand to turn Cas' face towards him. Cas shivered as much from the fact that Dean was touching him in front of so many people as from the touch itself.
Cas had reached out to pick up Dean's unused swan napkin and was turning it around slowly in front of him. Then his eyes widened.
"That night my dad sent me on my first solo hunt. I truly thought he was sending me away to die, that I'd let him down so much that he didn't want me to even exist anymore."
Dean nodded as if this could well be true, and then peered at the newspaper adjacent to Cas' elbow, opened at the job section with various ones circled.
The breathlessness, the hitch in his voice, it was the sexiest thing that Dean had heard. He pressed a little further, moving with almost glacial slowness so as not to hurt him, giving him time to adjust to the burn he knew he'd be feeling.
Cas stared at him, not blinking, not reacting and dread filled Dean’s stomach. He was going to lose Cas. He’d fucked up again. He
He looked up to find Dean and Kate standing behind him. Before he could refuse, they had each grabbed one of his arms, yanking him reluctantly out of his chair. He could have resisted, he probably
"You're family, Cas," Sam added, seeming to realise that sorting things out with Cas was more important than beating Dean over the head with a Monopoly board for ruining his winning streak.
Cas was sucking on his neck, hard enough to mark, holding him still as he tried to arch and writhe. He stopped and pulled back enough to look quizzically at Dean.
"Eileen has an ex hunter friend she thinks Dean might get on well with. Maybe setting him up on a date would help?" Sam was looking at Cas, obviously gauging his reaction and Cas made sure to keep his expression as neutral as possible.
I just wanted to say thank you all so much for the Kudos and reviews. I'm rubbish at replying to them because my social awkwardness extends just that far, but each and every one gives me fuzzy feelings and has me refreshing my inbox obsessively. You're all awesome 💙💚
"It's good," he answered shortly. "Did you enjoy watching?" He hated how his stomach twisted at the question, how important Cas' answer was to him. Whatever Cas claimed, even over the phone this wasn't safe, not for him.
"Dean, stop." This time Cas' voice was steadier, more sure. He pulled his hands back and took a step backwards, away from Dean.
The young man materialised in front of them, still dressed the exact same way as the last time they had seen him.
It wasn’t that Cas had wanted Dean to suffer. On the contrary, Cas never wanted Dean to suffer for a single moment of his life. But Dean acting like his loss didn't matter - it stung. He wasn’t a bad person because it had stung, he reasoned. He was missed so little that Dean was flirting, laughing and seemed far happier than when he'd had Cas by his side.
"You've got such pretty hair, Kate," Cas told her earnestly. "You think you're all darkness and pain, but your aura is so beautiful and pure."
my brother. Free will might need a little push sometimes, but without it everything is empty, like playing with dolls. Dean will choose me. I have nothing but time to wait for that."
“Every day just feels empty,” Dean finally said, his voice thick with tears and muffled by the material of Cas’ coat and jumper. “I can handle pain, I’m used to it. But not this emptiness all the time."
The music changed again and Dean led the three of them in the next slow dance. His mouth was still pressed against Cas' ear as he murmured encouragement and praise in a low gravelly voice, in between quietly serenading him.
"I don't have a rabbit, or any pets at all," Cas said, frowning in confusion. His eyes landed on Nigel, still safe in his pot. He glared at Dean, hoping he would understand the visual warning.
Then they were smiling at each other in a way that made Dean so very grateful that Sam wasn't in the room anymore, because there wasn't enough money in the world to bribe Sam to not make fun of the sappiness of that moment. Dean cleared his throat.
"I'll make a few phone calls and see what I can do. No promises though. Don't get your hopes up, but it's worth seeing if we can get you a proper identity now you're here to stay."
"I truly didn't think I'd be coming back here, Dean. It was meant to be the last thing I ever said to you. You're saying all this, giving me warnings like I don't already know that you wouldn't want to be with me. I know you don't!"
"If my mind is filthy, you are entirely to blame." Cas leaned a little closer to Dean and lowered his voice even more. "How do people control themselves when they feel like this?"
He'd seen Cas talking to his dad, but the conversation had seemed brief. How much damage could the man have done in two minutes? Cold dread filled Dean's chest and a wave of nausea hit him violently. The feeling that he'd been experiencing all day rolled over him again. The hair stood up on the back of his neck, his skin prickled—he was still being watched.
"Cuddling? Yeah, kinda," Dean shrugged. How could he tell Cas that in all the months he'd had with Lisa, he'd never once forced himself to stay awake, just so he could listen to her breathing like he'd done with Cas last night? That he'd never felt inclined to spend precious minutes just touching her hair, basking in the feeling of having her body close to his, the way he had with Cas' body. What happened to him last night was completely different from anything he'd experienced before. Dean wasn't even sure what last night was meant to be. Anyone else, they'd have been on their second or third round of sex by now, yet somehow this had felt like more. Fuck, he was getting sappy in his old age.
of the loud, obnoxious Christmas music beat rhythmically through the kitchen wall, assaulting Cas’ ears as he sought refuge there. It wasn’t that Cas wasn’t having a good time—he actually really loved the concept of Christmas. Not for the religious side of it, but for the social aspect of it all. He liked the kindness, the coming together, the spending time with family, whether blood or otherwise. It was nice.
"I've never had anything good happen to me when I've been tied up," Cas admitted, "and it would be nice to replace those memories with something pleasurable. I think I would like to try that with you."
Going to bed alone wasn’t unusual for Dean these days. This had been his life ever since Chuck had been defeated. He was on the outside of his brother's life, with barely a life of his own to cling to. He sighed, filled a glass with water and downed it in an attempt to stave off tomorrow's hangover.
“Yes, we have.” Dean had heard that tone before - stubbornness, defiance. Cas wasn't changing his mind.
"I'm going to need you to lie flat on your front. I'd use oil, but I don't want you to have to get up for a shower after."
. He was incredible. With his sex hair and his eyes that shouldn't be allowed to be that blue, and those hip bones that he'd only just got to run his fingers over. What if Cas said no to just sex and Dean never got to explore those little dents and dips with his tongue?
Once Kate had asked him outright how he felt about Cas, it had been a bit like trying to use a straw to plug a hole in a dam—once he'd started he just couldn't stop talking. Eventually she'd made the point that if he didn't try, he'd live out the rest of his life in a permanent state of stasis, his life on hold forever, never giving himself a chance
"Firstly, you're in the way," Dean said to Sam, ignoring Cas and shoving the Monopoly board to the side. Little cards, houses and hotels scattered everywhere, to a cry of horror from Sam and a suspiciously pleased smirk from Eileen.
"So, ironically," Dean said with false cheer that fell spectacularly flat, "my dad was actually responsible for a good third of the men I screwed. If he'd have left us enough money to live on while he was gone I wouldn't have needed to do any of it."
"You are going to be singing on that stage in a minute aren’t you? Because comedy ain’t exactly calling your name here, brother," Sam finally said.
"You said that you left, but I didn't stop you. And you were right, man—I didn't stop you. But I'm never making that mistake again. I'm not letting you walk out, not without fighting for you."
"Then having sex on said couch." Kate sliced the Yule log into large, sticky, chocolate slices and handed them out.
"I don't understand why we're still alive and you haven't just taken Dean?" Sam asked. "You're God now. Or… Goddess. Whatever. So you could just take him, couldn't you? Or… make yourself a copy?"
“If it helps at all,” Eileen said. “The accountant usually figures the sword out by the middle of episode two, and by the end of the season he’s pretty bad-ass.”
"Fine." Sam didn't look happy, but there wasn't much they could do about it. Cas didn't think he would get away with fake seducing Sam into bed to surreptitiously spell words out on his palm for an hour or two. Eileen would likely object.
Cas had seen a billion sunsets. He'd actually lent a hand in the creation of some of the mechanics and the colours that had gone into sunsets and sunrises. But this was spectacular even to his somewhat jaded eyes. The pinks, oranges, yellows and gold filled the sky above the lake in a kaleidoscope of colours, each and every one of them mirrored in the lake below.
“I always said you were the ultimate killer. It’s all you’re good for - it’s nice to see you embracing it.” Blood dripped steadily from the side of his mouth, staining his shirt.
Dean had never wanted to fuck someone more, but had also never been more reluctant to calm things down enough to do it before. He needed to prep Cas—he couldn’t just fuck him without opening him up first, however impatient he was—he was the kinky fuck who could get off on pain, not Cas. He liked the burn of the stretch, the way he would feel it for hours afterwards, but not many people dealt with pain the same way he did, courtesy of his years in Hell. This was Cas’ first time and he wanted to make it perfect, so he had to slow this down enough to do it right.
Cas felt that his lack of culpability was debatable, but now really wasn't the best time to start listing the mistakes he'd made. Maybe he would write them all down and furnish Sam with a nice laminated copy and see if he would still smile at him so kindly then. Knowing Sam, he probably still would - Cas had never met anyone as kind or forgiving as the younger Winchester brother.
"Are you listening?" Sam asked urgently. "I don't know how to… They just appeared here, in the middle of our living room. They've never even been here before, so how did they know where I was? I suppose that's not really the point, but they're in the guest room and they don't know how it happened either. But I couldn't just let you turn up today without warning you."
“It’s free will, Castiel. We don't interfere.” The words held no emotion, not hint that Jack was moved by Cas' anguish, that he would back down in the face of his father's desperate pleas.
"You said yourself what a good job I've been doing. I've fixed so many of the errors my brother made when he created this universe. It's better this way and you know it. This isn't some big fight where you have to defeat the evil monster to win. I'm not harming anyone."
"I don't mind." Cas was sliding his hands up Dean's arms, lifting them until they were above Dean's head, pinned to the pillow above them, his weight holding them in place. "I
Dean gave up on being upright and collapsed painfully on the bed, scrubbing his face with the heels of his hands until his eyes hurt and he saw stars.
Cas could just make out the glint of his teeth and the upturn of his mouth as Dean grinned at him in the darkness.
"There are absolutely no Hitler fantasies here," Dean denied emphatically. "I'm into some freaky shit, but Nazi uniforms are not my bag."
Tonight he had gone for a plain blue shirt, underneath a bright blue jumper with two annoyed looking snowmen on it. He'd combed his hair, but hadn't bothered shaving off his now almost beard-like stubble. He'd vowed to shave it off if he ever got invited for a job interview, which at the moment wasn't looking imminent. Maybe he would end up with a beard like that Headmaster in that wizard series that Dean had made him watch last year. He could plait it, maybe use it to hide his Angel blade in.
interested, this was way too close to home for him. Ever since he was a teenager, his one big rule for sleeping with men was that it needed to be kept on the down low. Sammy came into this bar fairly regularly, people knew him here and people talked. It was what they did best.
"How long were you in the Empty for before Jack pulled you out?" Dean's voice was now quiet, so low that Cas had to lean in to hear him.
Dean stood up and gave Cas a pointed look, tipping his head towards his room. If Cas didn’t want to stay the night it was fine, but even just getting Cas alone for five minutes to really talk to him would be amazing. Dean went down the hallway to the bathroom to very quickly relieve himself and brush his teeth. He was half expecting Cas to be sitting on his bed when he had finished, but to his disappointment the room was empty. Cas' room was also empty, so Dean sat on his bed and waited.
Eileen, not reacting at all beyond a small smile, took a sip of her drink and said, "Oh no! That's really bad timing - it’s at ten. But we're pretty sure we're going to put an offer in, so we'll be back there again soon. Sam and I are going to need your free labour for painting and putting up shelves."
"Hey, if the cowboy boot fits…" Sam grinned, unaware of the potential danger in the form of his brother, who was seconds away from abandoning the burger to pin his brother down until he apologised to Cas for being such a douche.
Dean bent to kiss him. “You’re mine, Cas. Say it.” he demanded gruffly, licking and sucking at his throat.
Dean’s hand snaked down between their bodies, cupping Cas’ cock through his jeans. He didn’t have the coordination to undo Cas’ jeans and belt while he was being touched like this. It felt like his fingers had grown thick and numb, rendering them useless for anything other than blindly clawing and grabbing at Cas through his clothes. How did Cas do this to him?
He maneuvered them, spinning them both until Dean was the one pressed into the wall, grabbing his wrists in one large hand and pinning them roughly over his head. Refusing Dean had never been in his nature, but if he wanted this here, it was absolutely going to be on Cas' own terms.
"It will," Dean soothed. "Look." He dropped back into the soft pillows and put his arm out, patting his chest with his other arm. "Here. Lay on your side and put your head on my chest."
Thinking about it, had what had happened in Cas' bed even counted as sex for Dean? He hadn't reached orgasm, or even let Cas so much as touch him intimately. It had upset and worried Cas at the time, but he was pretty sure he'd figured out what Dean was doing, and he didn't like it. Dean being willing to sacrifice his own wants and needs for Cas' happiness was touching and beautiful, but utterly misguided. He didn't want that from Dean, and maybe they needed to talk about that? Before Dean tried to do any other things he didn't actually want for himself, just to make Cas happy.
How Cas had somehow learned to verbally top from the bottom, Dean wasn't quite sure, but he wasn't complaining. His thumb was already spreading the leaking precum over the end of his cock, making his breath quicken so that surely Cas would be able to hear.
. Maybe not to you, but fuck, Cas—I've been tearing myself apart ever since you made that damned confession of yours and now you're saying nothing between us mattered?"
Each day Cas would go to the same booth, order a cup of coffee and pour over job listings, circling ones that sounded most like they would satisfy him. He'd learned from his mistakes - it wasn't enough anymore to just earn money, he wanted to help people, and while he had no idea how he would go about that, he knew that it was something he would need in his life if he was going to make the most of his next fifty or so years as a human being.
Cas was more than flagging, his body was swaying as he struggled to keep himself upright in the hard-backed chair. His argument with Kate instantly dismissed, Dean rushed over to Cas and grabbed his wrist to check his pulse, feeling his forehead with the back of his hand.
"You were so sure that I’d react badly to your confession, that you threw it at me when you knew you’d never have to face me again and would never have to know how I’d react. Then when Jack set you free and ruined that, you were too terrified to talk to me, so you made excuses.”
Briefly Dean had contemplated asking Cas to come with him. Fine, they were being watched, but who would care if they were on a hunt together? It would be a way to still be around Cas and let off some steam at the same time.
He felt Cas' thighs tremble, his legs struggling to hold him up. He fell forwards then, supporting himself against the wall, thrusting with far less control than he had been seconds earlier.
"Yes," Eileen nodded. "It's a good job we love you. Now go and make people jealous of mine and Sam's epic romance."
There was the sound of Cas swallowing and a cup being put down on a counter or table. Cas had evidently become on edge enough that he couldn't just lie in bed any longer and by the sound of it he was pacing around his flat.
“I was only trying to distract her for the first five minutes. After that, I think it’s more that she’s trying to counsel me into being a better person,” Dean explained ruefully. “I keep expecting her to get me to lie down on the couch while she holds ink blot dicks up in front of me to ask me what I see.”
“Sam,” Dean growled in warning. He was watching Cas, seeing the tiny, barely perceptible signs that he wasn’t altogether happy with Sam's words. Maybe Dean picked up on it so easily because lately he had been the one to upset Cas so often, but he was feeling so protective over Cas right now that the feeling was borderline overwhelming. No one was allowed to upset his Angel.
"I wasn't thinking clearly,” Cas defended. “Someone had just thrown a load of new information at me, out of nowhere!”
Dean shifted awkwardly, his eyes flashing to Sam and then back to his own fingers on the strings. He couldn't do this. He really fucking couldn't do this.
"Help?" he mouthed at him as he clumsily turned Kate, not quite sure what to do with his feet as he did.
Cas reached out a shaking hand and slid it down Dean’s cheek, across the roughness of his jaw, cupping his face in his hand. The stubble he’d fantasised about earlier was scratchy against his palm, exactly how he'd imagined it would feel. He caressed his cheek tenderly, tentatively, expecting Dean to push his hand away at any moment.
Dean felt Cas’ eyes on him and he pushed his jeans down his legs purposely a little slower than he would have done if he was on his own. He stepped out of them and then looking Cas in the eye he slowly ran a finger from ankle to knee, pouting and waggling his eyebrows in a comically suggestive fashion.
Still with enough forethought to realise that Cas shouldn't see his bruises, Dean reached out to pull the cord on his lamp, plunging the room into darkness. His heart thrilled at the disappointed breath that left Cas' lips - his Angel wanted to see him, and that fact alone was such a fucking unbelievable turn-on.
Sam's hand on his shoulder made him jump and reflexes honed by a lifetime as a warrior, Sam's wrist was in his grip and twisted behind his back before Cas had realised what he was doing.
Dean's smile returned, warmth spreading through him as he wrapped his arms around himself, imagining it was Cas' holding him tightly instead.
Inspired to join in, Sam pulled Eileen up and dragged her into the middle of the room to join them, and a few seconds later Kate got rather unsteadily to her own feet.
"Yep," agreed Dean with a nod, his beautiful face passive, entirely expressionless. It gave nothing at all away to Cas, who was desperately scanning his face for any sort of clue to how he felt.
Dean turned and pulled his hand free from Cas', leaving him feeling momentarily adrift without Dean's touch to anchor him. Then Dean's hands were on his shoulders, squeezing, sliding up to cradle his face. Cas felt like swooning into his touch, letting his eyes drift shut, but he couldn't tear his eyes from Dean's earnest, serious, 'I fucking mean what I'm saying' expression.
"We can definitely come back to that," Dean croaked, his resolve rapidly diminishing at the vivid image in his mind. "I'm trying to be the good guy here."
change because my parents are back, but do you know what I got lost imagining when I was standing up there next to my brother today…?"
Cas' sweater was on the floor in a colourful heap of wool, but Dean wasn't done. He slid his hands down Cas' sides until he reached his waist, and then he followed the belt round to the buckle at the front. Cas' hands came down to stop him, resting his own hands on top of his.
"Do you think you'd have me pinned to this wall right now if I didn't trust you? But can you blame me for worrying? This feels really fucking familiar, Cas. If you're going to kill me, then I wish you'd get it over with. I won't even fight it this time."
Despite his thoughts and without even realising it was happening, he began to relax a little, the constant presence of Cas like a balm on his raw emotions, soothing and healing. Throughout the ceremony, Dean had barely been able to keep his eyes off the angel—
"Couldn't you do this in the bathroom or something," he choked. He could feel the movement of Cas' muscles as he stroked himself literally inches from his arm. He should let go of him. He really, really should let go. "That's what bathrooms are
"Hey, man," Dean said, talking a step towards Cas to hug him, but having a crisis of confidence at the last second, not knowing if he was allowed. After a moment of leaning towards each other, both of them dropped their arms and into an awkward, forced and overly enthusiastic mutual shoulder pat.
When Cas traced one finger over the delicate skin of his wrist, Dean jumped so much that his knee hit the table with a bang, rattling the unused cutlery and making Cas' untouched beer spill.
Dean smiled, his eyes crinkling at the corners. "Honestly, I just pointed out all the times you've put your ass on the line to save us all - that you're human now because you saved me, which makes you anything but selfish."
He gave Cas a sheepish look, and he looked so guilty that Cas found himself reaching out his hand to squeeze his arm reassuringly. After all they had done before Cas fell asleep on him, surely Dean knew that he didn't have to feel bad for doing something as innocent as laying in bed next to him?
"Because you're the clumsy one," Dean observed rather unfairly. "You fall over your own feet in those big clown shoes of yours. Just try to deny it."
Cas hadn't been lying, he really did have no control left. He'd straddled Dean's hips and unceremoniously dropped himself into his lap, his hands cupping Dean's cheeks, cradling his face. Seemingly determined to show Dean how much he wasn't alone in this, he was kissing every single inch of exposed skin that was within his reach. His forehead, his cheeks, the scratchy stubble of his chin, his eyebrows, eyelids, nose, neck - Cas was placing kiss after kiss
delicious—Dean had decided to put his chef skills to the test and had created an absolute feast. A beautiful honey-baked ham, perfect roast potatoes that were crisp on the outside and fluffy on the inside, cranberry sauce that was just on the right side of sharp-tasting, and there was an array of multicoloured vegetables that even Sam couldn't find wanting. He'd baked a spiced caramel apple pie for dessert too, and by the end of the meal Cas was so full he could barely move. He'd never before understood how humans could eat until they were literally in pain with it—but then, at that point in his life he'd never tried Dean's cooking. It turned out that despite Sam's ribbing, Dean actually had a real talent and although he wouldn't admit it, he actually enjoyed doing it.
"You'll always be mine," Cas growled in his ear, slamming into him to punctuate each word. "I raised your soul from perdition, pieced your body back together—it's mine now. Every inch of this body is mine now. Do you understand that?"
"Harder." Cas' eyes were squeezed tightly shut, his face set in an expression that could just as easily have been pleasure or pain. As Dean snapped his hips and dove deeper into his lover, he knew by the sharp intake of breath and the way Cas' lips parted to let out low, needy moans that he was hitting his sweet spot perfectly with every thrust.
Dean couldn’t tear his eyes away from Cas’. Despite his calm regard, his hands were nervously tearing at his napkin, fingers trembling slightly.
"I've got nothing left to give, Sam. I feel like I'm this shell, with nothing real inside. This empty
Dean took a breath. "For the right reasons, that would be great. But I don't need a babysitter, Cas. I need a friend, and if you're not coming here because you like being with me…" Dean's voice trailed off.
"You really hate me that much?" His red rimmed eyes were filled with so much pain that it brought Cas back to himself and all he wanted to do was hold his friend. "Really? Because I'll go, Cas. If that's what you want, I'll go."
Dropping onto a stool that Sam had saved for him, Cas smiled and greeted them, having to shout over the sound of the music. It would have been easier if Sam had learned to sign fluently, then they wouldn't need to shout at all. But although Sam was learning, he wasn't quite there yet.
"You really need to try this," he mumbled around a mouthful of chocolate. "It's even better than the cheesecake."
feel is all some cosmic plotline, that someone told Barbie to love Ken and neither of them get a choice in the matter."
"I'm sorry," Dean said, and the tears that were threatening to spill over testified to that. "I'm really fucking sorry. I regretted it five minutes after I ended things, but by then it was too late."
He watched Cas shredding his napkin with a contemplative look on his face. Running his hand through his hair, he sighed.
They had stepped into the hallway, voices coming to their ears that definitely weren't either Eileen or Sam's. Just as Dean was about to step out of the hallway, Cas grabbed his hand to stop him.
Cas sighed tiredly and looked over at the man who had caused him to rebel, to lose armies and, until they met, fight for a world he hadn't even known he cared about.
Cas squirmed under Dean's suddenly accusing gaze. "I swear to you, I didn’t do it on purpose. You moved just as I was creating it and it just… happened.”
"Open your eyes," he whispered, and Dean immediately obeyed. Cas was on the knife edge, about to tip over and for whatever reason he was stopping himself, just like he did with his sleeping. His Angel needed to learn how to let go.
"No. Even if he could love me the same way I love him, he's worried about what his parents, and the world in general would say - he was brought up by a homophobic dick of a father. And then there's the issue that he feels like the direction our relationship would go in is already predestined and will end in misery, and he doesn't need more of that."
"It's not a date!" he'd bellowed from the bottom of the stairs for the fourth time in an hour, only to look up to find Cas standing at the top of the stairs with timing so perfect it was almost comedic.
Dean's mouth brushed over Cas' lips again and again, each almost-kiss more firm than the last one, each one stealing Cas' breath away, making him light headed, making him forget everything except Dean's perfect mouth, the hand sliding up from his hip, under his t-shirt and sweater.
"Let him go. You don't need to hide behind his face - the work you've done since you took over from God, it's good. It speaks for itself. You don't need Jack as a disguise - the angels would listen to you without it."
"Did I do something you didn't like?" Cas murmured, when Dean finally let him up for a breath. "I can try again and you can tell me what you like, guide me?"
Dean pulled back, watching Cas intently as he fell back against the pillows to take in shuddering breaths of air. Dean traced his fingers slowly up the inside of Cas' arm, twisting uncomfortably to lean over Cas, not paying the pain in his side any heed. He let his fingers explore every line, every dip, every swell and ridge of muscle, thrilling in the way that Cas' breath caught and hitched as he did.
This was going to be him and Cas one day. They would stand somewhere just like this, with all their friends and family around them, and they would vow to love each other forever, pledge their souls to each other, bind themselves together for all eternity, in this life and the next. There would be no more doubt, no more denial, just them,
"Yeah, yeah. We've talked about this - it's not for me." Dean was tired of explaining. He'd tried with Lisa and it hadn't worked. If it hadn't worked with her it wasn't going to work with anyone.
“Alright, Dean. Yes. Whether here, or the bunker, or the Lake House—I don’t want to be without you either.”
Sam was such a good kid. Not that he was a kid anymore, but Dean sometimes struggled to let go of the image of that lanky, headstrong, desperate-to-please kid he'd dragged up in motel rooms. He was supportive and kind, and Dean was so fucking proud of the man he'd become.
"No," Dean groaned as Cas' hands slid down his sides, grabbing hold of his hips and pulling them firmly against his own. "But I'll take what I can get."
Because there was no natural light coming into Dean's bedroom, Cas had no idea what time it was. All he knew was that around fifteen minutes earlier, Dean had woken up, stretched and then slid a hand into Cas' hair. He'd been playing with it ever since.
He dropped to his knees in front of Cas, his hands on Cas’ knees, eyes pleading with him for understanding. What they had together—this new stuff—it felt so fragile. Dean being happy and having something good for once in his miserable life felt like it was crumbling. He could feel everything he’d been building his future on, everything that he’d so tentatively been holding onto crashing down around him. It was deafening, pounding through his veins in time with the beating of his heart as it crashed against the walls of his chest, feeling like it was going to burst free at any moment.
Dean nodded. “I’ll show you where I put all the alcohol. You’ll have to help me identify which bottle it is.”
"Cas?" he whispered his name again, this time much more quietly, his mouth pressed to Cas' ear. "Whenever I have anything that's actually mine, whenever I have something I really care about, it gets taken from me." He held him more tightly, pressing a kiss to the skin just behind his ear. "Don't get taken from me, okay?"
"Do you know when the last time I slept was?" Cas asked, then before he could answer, "it was that morning I fell asleep in your arms. That was the last time I felt safe and cared for and happy enough to fall asleep. I've only ever felt safe and—"
Angel. Chuck was right. I'm a fuck up, a mess. I'm not cut out for relationships, and Cas should be with someone who isn't like this, someone who can hold his hand walking down the street, someone who looks after him instead of it constantly being the other way around, someone who doesn't hurt him every five minutes."
“I think it’s excellent he’s making healthy choices now he’s got a body that needs taking care of,” Sam said, giving Cas an approving smile. Dean remembered quite clearly now why he used to occasionally kick his brother in the shin at meal times. It was worth the ass-whooping he got if it trained even some of the smugness out of him.
Cas rolled his eyes. Even on the floor, bleeding and physically broken, Chuck acted like he was in charge.
Cas chose a plain ring donut, loving the way it seemed to almost melt in his mouth. Kate held the box out to Dean and he shook his head, making Cas narrow his eyes in suspicion. Dean turning down food was always a warning sign.
Eileen nodded in agreement, then she took a deep breath and put her hand on Cas' arm. "I'm so sorry about Jack. I know you miss him."
The light had started to break through the tiny gap in the thick curtains, extra bright because of the snow reflecting it around outside. Dean was starting to feel almost as exhausted as Cas looked.
way I like?” It just slipped out, alongside a suggestive eyebrow wiggle. Dean really couldn’t be blamed for that.
“I don’t want to stop you.” He slid his hand through Cas’ hair and then cupped his cheek, helping to tip Cas’ head up to meet his eyes. “I swear I don’t ever want to stop you, but Cas, I need you, man. I really fucking need you. I’m falling apart here.”
Cas took the cookie dough tub, grateful for once that his Grace was low enough that he could finally enjoy the taste of food. Kate threw herself down on the sofa next to him and flicked on the TV for background noise.
Sam was following him, and so help him, Dean wasn't going to break down in front of him again. He would be strong, he would make sure Cas was okay and he wouldn't let himself feel another moment of self pity.
“Castiel has fallen,” Jack said shortly, a scowl on his face. “Rebelling once again for Dean Winchester.”
And she was right, Dean knew she was right. But then she hadn't seen the pain in Cas' eyes that evening when he'd begged Dean to stop pushing, and she had no idea what sort of hell Cas had been through in the years that Dean had known him. It wasn't as easy as just 'giving it a go'.
For the purpose of this story, Cas either doesn't remember being or was never married to Daphne when he was Emanuel. The Supernatural writers seemed happy to pretend she didn't exist once Cas got his memories back, and I am too.
"Of course, Dean. Thank you for a lovely evening." Cas put his hand on Sam's back, leading him back out. The last thing Dean heard before the door slammed shut behind them was, "So Sam - how
Amara wrapped her arms tightly around him and soothed him while he sobbed. And unable to do anything else anymore, Dean let himself collapse against her. He had no idea how long he lay there for, half sprawled on the ground, trying to remember how to breathe, but when he eventually sat up it felt like hours had passed. His eyes were raw and aching, and somehow while he'd been sitting there Amara had dressed him, probably in the first clean clothes he'd had on since he'd come out to this hell-hole to find Cas.
She grinned at him, letting go of his arm to dim the light above their table. She lit a candle for them and handed them their menus, chatting with Eileen about her sparkling diamond engagement ring as she did.
"I'm gonna go," he said. "I was just meant to serve you the food and wine anyway. I don't think you need me for this and I want to check on Eileen—make sure she's eaten."
"Alright, can we assume that if I'm gonna go psycho, it's not going to be on any of you and that I'd have a damn good reason for it? Please."
"Shit, Cas. Stop. Stop." He sat up, reaching for Cas' face, cupping it in his hands and gently guiding Cas back up his body to his mouth. He kissed him, groaning into his mouth at the taste of himself on Cas' tongue. It was sinful and so fucking sexy that he was worried it might push him over the edge.
"Not… for that. I mean, just to sleep - there's no pressure at all. I know there's whatever the hell this is between us, and it's complicated. But, I really don't want you to go."
"Yep. Damn near perfect," Dean said, looking at the little red dot on the map that was open on his phone. "Are they meeting us there? Do we need to go inside?" Dean sounded suspiciously excited at the prospect.
Dean wasn't in the kitchen where Cas had expected him to be. He wasn't in his own bedroom, and Cas noted that Dean still hadn't found his presents—they were still sitting on his chair in their brightly coloured paper, fancy red and gold bows untouched. The bathroom was empty and the Dean Cave was occupied by Alex and Patience who were watching Dean's third favourite Christmas film, Love Actually. It was one of the films that Cas wasn't allowed to tell Sam they'd watched together, and he was never again allowed to mention the fact that it had made Dean cry, even to Dean himself.
"Have I asked you to leave? Did I tell you I didn't want you living with us? Living with me?" Dean took a breath and when Cas didn't respond he carried on. "I'm sorry for what I said all those weeks ago. I shouldn't have lashed out at you and I regretted it the moment I did, but dammit Cas, I was really hurt."
Cas' eyes seemed to sparkle in the candlelight and Dean was hit for a moment by how much of a fucking cliché he was when he was falling for someone. This was so dangerous. He shouldn't want this, shouldn't be looking at Cas like this, shouldn't be obsessing over the way the shadows played over his skin and how he wished he could uncover more of Cas' skin just to see how it would look.
Pulling their clasped hands apart, Dean reached in between them, stroking Cas in time with each thrust of his hips. It took less than a minute to push Cas over the edge, and he came with a shout, his cock spasming between them as he moaned Dean's name over and over again, like a desperate chant or prayer. Seconds later Dean's own orgasm ripped through him, and his body shuddered, his hips jerking in uncontrollable spasms. His vision went black around the edges, the white-hot pleasure so much, so intense that it could almost have been described as pain. His arms shook, trembling before giving way entirely, and he collapsed on top of Cas for the final few stuttering, reflexive thrusts.
"Don't answer," Dean whispered urgently against the material of Cas' shirt, surprising him. "C'mon man, we were just getting somewhere."
happened to the dinosaurs - that was some weird shit - and it puts right all the homophobic crap that people seem to interpret out of their own twisted prejudice. It might actually be my finest piece of writing to date. No offence."
"Hilarious, Sam," Dean glared up at his brother, who was smiling back at him smugly. "Haven't you seen two platonic friends sharing a bed before?"
"I agree - you don't have to label yourself if you don't want to. But your anger towards your brother when he said-"
The rough, bare bricks of the wall scraped against his back as Dean pressed against him, his mouth on his throat, hot and almost frantic in his need. He could feel Dean's cock pressing through layers of denim, sliding rhythmically and insistently against his hip.
The response was a satisfied, lazy, "Mmmm," that sounded so sexy to Dean's ears that he felt a new stab of pleasure go through him just at the sound of it.
"Here." Cas handed Dean a glass of water from off of his bedside table, as if he could read his mind. Dean sincerely hoped he couldn't.
"Gonna come," Dean panted, and before Cas could wrap his hand around him to help, Dean was spilling onto the ground below him, shivering, crying out, uttering Cas' name over and over until Cas couldn't take it anymore and he followed him over the edge with a shout. He pulled out just in time to paint Dean's perfect ass with his own cum.
Lost in reliving how lost and unwanted he had felt that night, Cas had drifted out of the conversation. He jumped back to reality only when Dean raised his voice.
As he walked past their door on his way to the bathroom, the sound of over the top, scripted moans came to his ears. Either they were watching porn, or they were re-watching Game of Thrones again. Either way, he definitely wasn’t going to knock on that door, any more than he was just going to sit at the table in the library and drink alone. Not tonight, anyway.
Dean squeezed his eyes tightly shut, his jaw set, but his bottom lip trembling in a way that made Cas want to slide his thumb over it, kiss it, soothe it with his own mouth. He understood the conflict inside Dean - nothing was ever safe and simple. Everyone betrayed him, even Cas himself in the past. It was so difficult to just let go and trust. Maybe it was too much to expect.
"You like it," Cas stated, and Dean couldn't have disagreed if he'd wanted to—the proof was pretty evident if Cas just looked down, though the inadvertent lapdance had been a definite factor too.
brought his angel blade!" Dean countered, comfortably throwing Cas under the bus to deflect Sam's ire. Cas narrowed his eyes and gave him a look that promised retribution. Dean waggled his eyebrows suggestively back, unabashed.
. Simmer down," he chided himself under his breath, obviously not quietly enough if the quizzical look Cas gave him was anything to go by.
It was 7pm in a bright, bustling, busy restaurant. Families were laughing, couples were chatting and cheesy music was playing in the background. The air was buzzing with chattering and happiness and everyone was relaxed and having fun. Everyone that was, except Dean, who was seriously wondering what the hell was happening to him.
"That's who she was texting," Dean muttered darkly, as he, Cas and Sam pulled away from the women who were deep in conversation. It sounded like he felt Kate had committed some evil atrocity instead of simply texting her friend.
“I was kidding,” Dean said, ignoring the twitch his cock had given just at the thought of Cas talking dirty to him in that already practically pornographic voice of his. “Mostly.”
"You know what?" Dean said, grasping Cas' wrist in his hand. He dragged him back up the hallway and into the living area again.
“I’ve barely seen you today,” he said, his teeth worrying his lip, like they often did when Dean had something to say that he was too scared to speak out loud. “I’ve been talking about you instead of to you, and I just felt like… like I needed to see you. Alone.”
Dean made a strangled frustrated noise as Cas pulled his hips back against his own, making him bend. Cas was rock hard and sliding against his ass again, but still not pushing inside.
"I came back! More than once! You and Sam were free, hanging out in bars like you did before things got complicated. Hunting, drinking, women - there was no place for me anymore and that's okay. It wasn't meant to be forever."
“How aren’t you mindless with this?” Dean groaned, lifting his head and almost wishing he hadn’t. Cas somehow got sexier the more crumpled his clothes and the more ruffled his appearance. “I don't like being the only one in this.”
"I can see that talking to you is pointless." Without hesitation or fear, she easily pushed the blade away from where it trembled against her throat. The blade slipped through his numb fingers and fell with a soft thud into the grass just as his control slipped and a howl ripped from his throat.
"I'm at a loss," Sam continued. "All I can do is have his back on hunts, and I can't keep doing that. I'm so done with living that life."
"Hey, it wasn't me who thought right now would be a good time to play an impromptu session of truth or dare." Dean leaned back against the counter, pouring himself a glass of wine, as Cas hadn't bothered to get one for him. It actually turned out that before lunch was a perfectly acceptable time to drink wine. Who knew? "I was all for going out and building us a Jack Frost."
Cas placed his palms flat against Dean's chest and pushed him backwards. Dean stumbled, resisted for a moment, and then, eyes locked with Cas', he allowed himself to be walked backwards until his back hit the wall.
Cas didn't reply. His hand was wrapped tightly around an angel blade, but he was almost positive he wouldn't need to use it. He could sense nothing powerful coming from the man in front of him, nothing that would make him dangerous in any physical sense.
Cas felt the forehead pressed against his wrinkle in a frown. He felt Dean take a sharp breath in through his nose.
Dean narrowed his eyes. “No,” he said firmly. “I’m not letting you put the rest of your name on my ass.”
“You’re really great,” she said. “If you ever feel like giving me a private performance, here’s my number.”
"So plan number three," he said, his voice sounding strangely high pitched to his ears. Nigel would love it. "Is going to involve some touching. Innocent touching I swear."
"You okay?" he mouthed, looking up from where he'd been bending to scratch behind Miracle's ears. Dean momentarily considered rolling on the floor in front of Cas to see if he'd get the same attention. He gave him a lopsided, half smile and hoped Cas read it correctly as, 'not really. Need you.' Then he could come and snuggle up and make it all better.
When Sam wasn't hanging out in his apartment with him, Cas spent a lot of time in the restaurant below. The apartment was furnished with a small kitchenette, but Cas very quickly discovered that cooking was not one of the life skills that he would excel at. He'd managed to burn toast, turn porridge into one solid smoking lump in the microwave and somehow he'd set fire to a bowl of soup. Soup - a liquid - on fire.
Cas moved as close to Dean as he dared, standing in the space between his open knees. He knew he was too close, but he needed to be - Dean needed him to be. He reached out a hand and lightly, tentatively put it on Dean’s shoulder.
Touched by the gesture, Cas smiled warmly at Dean. He couldn't see why not. That was pretty innocent - they'd be in a shop full of beds, but the chance of Cas being tempted to shove Dean down on one was pretty slim when they were in public. Probably. It would be fine.
Sex-work holds far too much stigma in our society. When chosen freely, sex-work is just work, just as valid as anyone else's job. What Dean was driven to do in this chapter is not the same thing.
Trees lined the road, some thick, green and dense, others bare and sparse, having lost almost all their leaves for winter. It was a cold but sunny day, but there was so little light coming through the densely packed trees, that it was almost dark inside the car. Cas would have called it gloomy but it was too
"Sam and Eileen will take Miracle, they've already said. And I can get him back when we, um… when the Lake House is ready. So I can stay here until then, if you want me to? Or we could play it by ear—take it a day at a time?"
Cas' thighs had fallen apart, trembling as Dean slid a hand down his side until he could grip his hip, guiding himself with his other hand.
A shock of something went through Dean, and he was lost. All control left him and he stopped being careful or gentle, stopped thinking of anything but the moaning angel underneath him, as he pounded into him. Each of them fed on the other's urgency, on the passion and fire between them, matching each other thrust for thrust, touch for touch, each driving the other higher and higher until all there was was pleasure, smothered by the white noise of harsh breathing, gasps, and pants.
Spitting out mouthfuls of the white snow that had fallen in on his face, he laughed. No amount of cold could bother him when Dean's body was pressing him into the ground like this.
It was spoken gruffly, but the words shook Cas to his core. He swallowed twice, trying to regain control, but he felt himself trembling far worse than before, and he could do nothing to stop it. His body so firmly pressed to Dean’s, there was no way Dean could miss what he’d done to him.
Dean sighed. For whatever reason, his gut clenched whenever he thought of taking Cas back to his apartment and walking away from him. Like it would be the last time he saw Cas if he let him leave.
As Cas leaned closer to Chuck the smell of stale liquor and cigarettes assaulted his nose. Chuck hadn't come across as drunk, but Cas had lived with Dean, so was more than aware of the fact that it could take a lot of alcohol to tip someone over the line from sober to inebriated. Besides, alcohol wouldn't make him this reckless, this blasé about being beaten to death.
"Yes, probably. But I'm tired, Dean. And I need time to think. Do you really need me there for you to tell them that you can't explain where we went and that nothing is going on between us?"
"As I said, it was very time consuming. I left not long after I met Sam and Dean, when I realised that blindly following orders wasn't for me anymore."
"How about building a snowman?" Cas asked suddenly, turning to Dean who had got up to look out of the window. "I've never built one, but I'm told it's an experience that every person needs to have."
"We'll be living at the Lake House together before you know it," Cas reassured him, knowing instinctively that Dean needed it. "I was thinking that we could get chickens—Sam was telling me about a protection spell that would keep away predators, so we could section off half the garden and they'd have so much space to roam."
His thumbs swiped at the tears on Cas' face, brushing them away with such tenderness that it set off a whole new batch of tears.
"I'm very glad you and Sam found each other," he told her, meaning it wholeheartedly. Epic revelations about his childhood notwithstanding, Sam had an innate inner peace about him since he and Eileen had fallen in love, and aside from how good she was for Sam, Cas found Eileen to be one of the very few people he actually enjoyed spending time with.
"I swear I've never done that," he muttered unsure of who he was convincing. "I sing to Nigel, I don't dance with him!"
Sam caught his arm just as he reached the dance floor in front of the stage. He was standing chatting to a group of his Law school buddies and it was so good to see him relaxed amongst his friends. Dean reflected again on how far his brother had come. He was so much better than the life they’d had, this was where he belonged, surrounded by slightly stuffy suits, helping people this way instead of putting his life on the line day after day.
Still not looking pleased, Kate allowed Rowena to take her hand and lead her away, giving Dean the impression of a predator leading its prey off into a cave.
Dean's face fell back into a scowl and pushed himself up. He reached down for Cas' gloved hand, helping him up. Then seconds later, while Cas was still finding his balance, Dean smushed a handful of snow in his face, before darting off towards Eileen to do the same to her.
"Why are you so obsessed with coupling us up?" Dean growled. If Sam hadn't made him this pretty delicious burger, Dean would have opened a can of whoopass by now.
When he reached the library where everyone was still gathered, he knew he couldn't just sit down with them like nothing had happened. He was shaking—his entire body trembling, betraying him completely. And he couldn't let people see him like this. He needed to hide until he'd calmed down. No, he needed to go home. He grabbed his coat from the back of his chair.
“No, Sam,” Cas answered dryly, which made Dean suddenly wonder if Cas didn't sometimes 'misunderstand' entirely on purpose. “I would in fact be naked for sex. Aren’t you? Do you have sex clothes?”
This was different though. He'd never imagined that Cas would make little noises in the back of his throat in pure pleasure and joy, just because he was kissing
"What? Where the hell did you go today? Secret house hunting with Cas?" Sam lowered his voice. "What's been going on between you two?"
Dean was going to end up bawling like a baby if Cas kept this up, and he really didn't want Kate to be there to witness that. He mopped up the puddle on the floor with their towels and dropped them into the hamper.
and Dean wondered why he wasn't more upset about it. His worst secret had gone from an audience of one to an audience of four overnight. He felt quite suddenly oddly lighter, like a massive long-dreaded disaster was finally over with and now he could stop worrying about it, stop trying to prevent it and just take a breath and deal with the fall-out.
"Only sexually, obviously," Cas clarified, as if Dean wasn't having a minor panic attack. "I'd never put you in charge of my food choices, or my…"
"I've sworn off men for a while," Kate shrugged easily. "Controlling, abusive, arrogant arseholes, every single one I've known. Present company excepted, of course. But then maybe gay men are nicer?"
"Yeah. I figured it was the least I could do, and it's good to have a bit of the normality that other people take for granted. I think it's good for Claire and Kaia too - they're barely home these days."
Forcing the pancakes down really hadn't helped the nervous rolling of his stomach and Cas's feet seemed to drag more and more the closer he got to Dean's bedroom door. He didn't want to fight anymore, but with Dean so obviously angry and resentful towards him, Cas wasn't sure how to avoid it. Last time he became human Dean had pushed him away entirely and this time they were hardly on a good footing to start with. He fought his every instinct to turn back and avoid conflict, and knocked.
Being in love with Cas was the most aggravating thing. He didn't see anything clearly, because all he could think about was how much he wanted that frustrating, perfect angel to be his. He'd thought that living with him would quell some of the craving, calm it all down to a dull roar at least. But it hadn't done that, and now he couldn't tell if Sam was right or not because all he could see was Cas—beautiful, addictive, incredible Cas, who he loved so completely that he said it to him in his head a hundred times a day. He just wished he could say it out loud.
Dean's head fell back against the wall as he seemed to look to the Heavens for assistance. He let out a long, weary sigh and looked at Cas.
"Are you telling me that Gabriel is the original Crazy Cat Lady?" The snort that escaped from Dean’s nose was as undignified as it was amusing. "Oh God, that's the best thing I've heard in years!"
Cas knew with absolute certainty that he wasn't going to ever get this out of his system. His body was burning, screaming with the need to touch Dean.
Dean rubbed his chin, which usually signalled that he was about to try to have a serious conversation. Cas watched as the stubble scraped against the tips of Dean's fingers as they dragged over the tiny hairs. He wondered what it would feel like if he touched them, let the tips of his fingers slide against Dean's jaw. Would it be soft or rough? What would it be like to kiss him? He'd never kissed anyone with stubble before - how different would it feel?
Dean's fists had clenched automatically, his body understanding his need to punch something before his head had even registered it.
Dean pulled back a couple of inches and Cas looked past him to Garth, Bess, Claire, Kaia and Eileen, who had all gone silent and weren't even pretending not to be watching them in undisguised interest.
Dean hated that idea, but he realised that he'd come to a decision the moment he'd driven into that clearing earlier in the day.
Chuck opened his mouth to answer and Dean fell on him before he could, punching him with such force that Cas winced, pretty sure he could hear the crack of something breaking.
"I know what he said! Look, where I come from, the upbringing I had-" Dean covered his face with his hands, dropping the phone to his pillow to take several deep, calming breaths. After a moment he picked the phone back up, and put it back to his ear to find Cas patiently waiting for him.
Dean's hands had found their way down the back of Cas' pyjama bottoms and he was pulling Cas hard against him, kneading, massaging, committing the feel of Cas' taut ass in his palms to memory.
Their chests were pressed together as they kissed long and hard, pent up emotions pouring into the kiss from both sides. Every movement hurt Dean's already bruised and battered ribs, but Dean didn't care. Cas was furious, protective, loving and
"Are you okay?" she asked gently, pulling back and searching his face with eyes narrowed in suspicion.
Cas was aware that a small groan had escaped his lips in response, and Dean's face broke into a grin as he heard it too. Oh, he knew how absolutely fucking irresistible he was.
Cas groaned at yet another reminder of the last time he showered, and at Katie's confused frown he shook his head.
Chuck shrugged casually, dismissing Sam's threat entirely as he turned to look at Cas and Dean, both of whom had come to stand as a physical barrier between the entire group and him.
"You know you're every bit as smart as Sam, don't you?" Cas informed him. "I know what it's like to compare yourself to your siblings, but honestly, your mind is just incredible, Dean."
