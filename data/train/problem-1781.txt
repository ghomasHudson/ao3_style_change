“Fuck! Shit! Oh! Sherrrrrrlock!” Sherlock felt John’s release burst inside him. They held each other until their breath came back to them.
.' The man had zero clue at all how caring and nurturing he could be. John would do his best not to tell him since that could be misconstrued as teasing. John loved every moment of Sherlock’s attention. He just wished it was for a better occasion than his current predicament.
“Sherlock! Oh, fuck! Yes!” John managed four more thrusts and then he was emptying himself inside him.
“Yef, Daddy!”
He walked through the kitchen and realised he should grab a glass and brought that and the plate with him down the hall. Halfway down the hall, he realised that John would need a new ice pack, so he turned around and made his way back to the kitchen and grabbed the spare one from the freezer door. He juggled all three items as he made his way back to his bedroom. He pushed the door forward with his foot and John was still on his back, a grimace on his face, despite being asleep. He walked into the room quietly and set the plate and fork on the night table beside John’s head. John stirred at the noise. As a former soldier, John slept poorly at the worst of times; always on the listen for the slightest noise; ready for action. Since becoming a parent, those senses were on an even higher alert.
He seemed rather upbeat. But I wasn’t in the same headspace.
John knew it felt miraculous, but Sherlock was already beyond words. His throat produced a sound that could only be described as a growl.
“You were wearing gloves.”
Molly was going to have to prod him along. “And what else?”
“Do do do do. Hm hm hm hm hm hm. It’s all right.” In between the words he was singing and humming, Sherlock could also here John puttering about; getting the mugs down from the cupboard. The utensil drawer opened, a jostling of metal. A spoon for Sherlock’s sugar. The drawer was closed more gently than it was used to. He tried to place the song John was crooning. After several seconds of replaying the sounds he’d heard John make, he had his ‘Aha!’ moment.
“Yes?” John answered from his chair in the sitting room.
“I would never mind any part of your body against any part of my body, at any point, ever.”
“I wish I’d have thought of it myself.” They settled together after that, a decision reached. The silvery-gold moon painted the room in peace.
Sherlock mewled against John’s neck as he pressed clumsy kisses wherever he could reach. John’s chest; his neck; his other shoulder; his open, gasping mouth. John’s ankles made their way to Sherlock’s ass, pushing Sherlock further inside. Their current position wasn’t stimulating John’s prostate, but Sherlock’s stomach sliding blissfully up and down his cock was enough. That and the sounds Sherlock was making.
“John! Come here for a moment, please!”
“To what?”
It was a good thing Cara’d finished her sandwich because she’d have probably choked on a piece of it.
“Let me get to the broom! You back out of here and into the sitting room. Your hands are shaking. I don’t want you cutting yourself!”
“He usually goes into his Mind Palace when he’s trying to work something out. We’ve no case on right now. So either he went in there to get some quiet, or he wanted me to think he was in there.”
“You mentioned it. I didn’t want to push. I figured you’d tell me if you could. Someday.” Cara moved her hand from underneath her chin and crossed her arms on the table between us.
“I just don’t want there to be a huge argument when I need to help you with something, and your pride and ego step in between us. I couldn’t stand it if something happened to our new relationship because of something so idiotic.”
They’ve been sleeping together for five years. John was Sherlock’s first intimate partner. They’ve been married for three years and known each other for ten. And Sherlock still got shy when the subject came down to sex. It was very endearing.
"I thought she was our daughter."
Two hours later, while eating takeaway on the couch, John and Sherlock were watching telly while Rosie absentmindedly missed putting noodles in her mouth.
“Nonsense. I will check on her, see how she’s doing, and come right back.”
“You go, I go.” John settled against Sherlock’s sweaty back, not caring about the mess they’d just made of the bedding.
“I’m going to sit here and you’re going to pretend to forcefully pull me from the seat. I’m not going to let you, and that should pop my shoulder back to where it’s supposed to be.”
“That woman was in my house. Sat on that sofa Rosie is sitting on right now. My boy was shot and he sat in this kitchen, the first time he was able to travel so far from home after his recovery, and she sat under the roof of our home as if nothing was amiss.”
“She did what she thought she had to do to remain with John. While most of you deem her actions unforgivable, I made peace with her decision. She was backed into a corner and made a bad choice. By harming me, she alienated John further than the truth of her situation ever could. One of the few times Mary made a mistake so grave.”
“I’m a cynical dick, Sherlock. I’ve been to therapy. You’ve met both of my therapists. I don’t know how to be happy, Sherlock. I’ve tried to let myself enjoy people, things, events; but I’m always waiting for the rug-pull. Nothing good in my life ever stays. I don’t know if I’ve ever actually been happy. I don’t know if I know what that actually feels like.”
“If I never made it perfectly clear that you’re more important than anything else could ever be, I’m sorry for that.”
“No! Don’t!” John could hear the tears on Sherlock’s cheeks in the sound of his voice.
“Can I see your finger? You mean that long, thin, pointy thing that looks like an icicle? Yes, Sherlock, I can see your finger. Even when you move it side to side, and especially when you come closer and move it away. Going cross-eyed hurts concussion sufferers, by the way.” John is lying on his back now, Sherlock looming above him.
“We could hand her off to Lestrade for a few minutes? He has child-rearing experience. She seems to not hate him when he comes around to deliver us cold case files.”
“Pardon me?” Sherlock looked stricken, but in the best sort of way.
“Because he’s had failed relationships? Many failed relationships?”
“If we’re lucky.” John understood his meaning.
That was all it took to get them to giggling and suddenly they knew that they were on the right road. At least they were trying.
Sherlock reached tentatively for John’s wrist, his long fingers wrapping loosely around the knobby bones there. John returned the gesture but had a tighter grip around Sherlock’s right wrist. “You need to really have a good hold of me here, Sherlock. This isn’t a halfway type of thing.”
“Because. You've got me, Sherlock. I know you do. I’m still right here. Always here. And you’re here. And I’ve got you. I’ve got you always. That’s all that really matters to me, in the end. Everyone has their own aches and pains. Is this going to be hard? You bet it is. It already is. But we’ll deal with it. Like every other thing that comes at us. We’ve already been handling it for almost six months. If it’s you and me, it’s already handled.”
“I don’t want it to simply be ‘good enough’ for you. I want this to be fantastic.”
“A Freudian slip, more like.”
John’s head tilted. “Of course. Of course, I want you around. For her and for me!”
“Do you think you can do five more?”
John took two steps back from me. “Sherlock are you all right?” Even through his anguish, his doctorly instincts managed to surface.
“I knew who you were when I met you. I’m still here, 10 years later.”
“John, I haven’t known you for very long, and I know virtually nothing about Sherlock. But what I have seen or intuited here, I can only say it looks to be one of the most ridiculous tropes that usually only exist in shitty rom-coms. Mutual pining, but, in this movie, each person thinks the other doesn’t love them back.”
“I’m okay, bee. See?” He pulled a silly face to make her laugh. It worked.
“Tea for me, thanks.” John helpfully supplied.
“WE absolutely were. You most certainly were there. I have the scratch marks on the backs of my shoulders to prove it.” John was grinding against him with more gusto than he’d intended. Sherlock always brought out his passion, no matter the sort.
“I don’t know what to say.”
John’s whole body jerked at the touch. “Oh, Sherlock...”
Sherlock was waiting in the car park, sitting behind the wheel. John got in the car and there were no words spoken during the ride home.
“Can you take her in the kitchen and give her a biscuit to calm her down and bring me an ice pack when you’re done?”
“Truly, John, I'm all right. But I think there may be something else going on here that needs to be said.” I stared at the coffee table and waited.
Sherlock pressed his forehead against John’s neck:
“I wish I had my phone in here. To get a picture of you like this, all sweaty and debauched. Your mint-coloured eyes; dark hair on that pillowcase. Your body is covered with our pleasure. If you could see yourself, you’d know that you've clearly settled in your life if you're willing to spend any parts of it with me."
John’s face curled into a smirk. ‘
Sherlock gently squeezed John’s shoulder. “That lip-lick of yours was very confusing. Quite a mixed-signal, that.”
“This is going to take less than five seconds, Sherlock. A quick yank, and a scream and then I’ll need an ice pack. I’ll be fine by tomorrow morning.” Sherlock didn’t seem convinced.
“I didn’t forget. I just think it’s time to move past it. It happened. We dealt with it. It will probably happen again.”
"Well. That says a lot, doesn’t it?”
“Life just feels heavy sometimes, ya know? I can feel my entire life on my shoulders some days; gravity just having its way with me in that metaphorical sense. I’m so tired, Sherlock.” John turned back to facing the sitting room, but he slid closer to me and leant against my left shoulder. I got my arm around him and pressed a kiss to his right temple. Start slow.
“Well, I’m not a neurosurgeon, but I do know that the surgery is going to lay me up for a bit. I’m going to have some restrictions: Things I shouldn't lift. No twisting, bending, or lifting. I’ll have to take it easy on the stairs. Maybe get a walker frame for the first few weeks.”
“I didn’t,
“WAKE UP, JOHN!!!” John stirred.
“Come with me this way, yeah?” John put his left hand at Sherlock’s nape and pushed against it and scooped Sherlock towards and then on top of his chest. Sherlock bent his neck and kissed John’s chest.
John received another bit of good news at his six-week post-operative checkup. He was allowed to take off the sling! He was instructed by his surgeon and her Physician Assistant to do a few things he hadn’t been able to do before, but to not do anything too risky:
“Oh, I think he’d love that very much. Almost as much as he loves you!” He tickled her right hip and she pressed herself closer to her father’s side as she laughed.
John looked pointedly at Rosie as she obliviously toyed with Sherlock’s hair.
“There you are.” A relieved smile crossed John’s face. “I’m fine. Rose is in the bath, safe and sound. You’re unscathed, and I’ll be okay once I get the bleeding to slow up. You give me your gloves and I’ll pick up the glass. I’ll give the floor a sweep, and when I’m done, I’ll go get my kit and stitch this up. You can go get Rosie out of the bath. Don’t need to be getting the fresh dressing all wet!”
Both bottles of wine were consumed by the end of that evening. All four of them hugged each other before heading off to bed. Mrs. Holmes patting John’s cheek in confirmation of their unspoken familial intentions. He kissed her on the forehead, then hugged Mr. Holmes in thanks; for their support, understanding, and now, their love. Rosie just acquired, her very own grandparents, whether officially or not. That day may come for them all.
“What do others say?”
“Take all the time you need, love.”
“This isn’t a crime scene, John.”
“‘wacomb, Daddy!” She patted her palms against his cheeks and tugged at the hair hanging over his ears. Daddy. Daddy? Sherlock was dumbfounded. He looked over at John who’d seemingly forgotten about the flower.
It was a Saturday morning, only just; a bit before noon. Looked like pastries for lunch instead of the fruit they were planning on feeding Rosie.
“I don’t deserve you. I hope you never realise it. I hope you’re stupid about this relationship for the rest of my life!”
to her, tickling her ear and neck as they spun:
“I’d hate to slip and fall in the shower and hurt my shoulder again. Could use your help soaping up my right side and washing my hair.”
John laughed against my chest at my pronouncement.
John sagged back against Sherlock’s chest and waited, giving his genius time to register everything John just said to him. After about ten seconds, Sherlock reached to his right side to squirt a glob of shower gel on John’s upper belly. He gently lifted John’s left arm, bent it, and set his hand to the centre of his belly, and brought his own arm to join it, supporting it from below. He dragged his right palm and collected some of the shower gel and slid his hand past John’s belly button and into the nest of curls cushioning his cock.
Sherlock stood, rooted to the floor in front of his own chair. ‘Well, this is certainly a turn-up.’ Sherlock thought silently, ‘Didn’t expect the evening to take this turn.’ He stood there for the duration of John’s shower, which was only six minutes. John walked into view and stood under the arch of the kitchen entrance.
“Bloody buggering fuck!!!” His right hand was curled in a tight fist, his knuckles turning white. But they weren’t nearly as pale as his face.
"Lean back against the pillows for a mo'. Let me see you. I don't deserve this. Don't deserve you. You are tremendous. You've always been tremendous.”
“My level of flawlessness should not be something to which you should aspire. Leave that to the perfect amongst you.” He kissed John’s hair. He spoke softly against it: “Just because you had contention in your relationship does not, and should not, mean that you erase all the good things you’d had with her.”
“I am Godfather to Rosamund, am I not? I thought that immediately made us family, but I am also not good at those things. Haven’t had much practice, so please, do correct me if I’m mistaken.”
John broke the silence after a few minutes. This had to be said. “It was worth it. To me. If me getting hurt was the catalyst we needed to finally get here, I’d have done it a long time ago.” Sherlock looked chagrined as he reached for John’s healing shoulder.
“Are you all right, sweetheart? I’m ready to keep going if you are.”
“John!”
Sherlock came back to himself rather fast: “It’s not the first time, and I’m sure it will not have been the last.”
“That’s good to know. So listen up then: rest against me tonight. Let me hold you the way you held me for so long these last few weeks.”
“John, please.” Sherlock’s tone was suppliant. The worry tinging just those two words was enough for John to raise his foot off the accelerator a bit.
Sherlock’s brows disappeared behind his fringe.
“Yes, John. Remember I said that I have Bi-dar? What else could I have possibly meant?”
“Don’t want you to stop it. Want to watch you. Want to feel you grip my cock inside your pulsing heat. Come on. You come, I come. You first. Always you first.”
“Oh. Of course! Let me get your pain medication and I’ll be right back.”
He shuffled off to the bathroom to fill the glass for John. Upon his return to the bedroom, John was trying to get himself to a sitting position but was failing miserably. He was biting his lower lip, appearing to want to keep the frustration and pain from his face. He should’ve known better than to try to fool someone who was basically a lie detector in human form.
“You’ve done it again. That lilt at the end of your sentences, involuntarily punctuating statements into questions when they clearly aren’t grammatically correct.”
“I’ve gotten more nasal mucus on you. This time on your collarbone.”
"We took her to Kew Gardens. She seemed to have enjoyed herself."
“Figured out what exactly?” I felt like a piece of the conversation was had while I wasn’t sitting at the table, but I didn’t remember having an out-of-body experience, or leaving the table since I’d sat down.
“Ohhhh, God, John. Oh, John.”
“I should hope so. I told him several years ago when I asked him to be best man at my wedding to Mary.”
“Fuck, this exercise hurts like hell and back.” He’s already done ten, but he’s supposed to do fifteen. He bites his bottom lip and presses down on it, as he performs the range of motion exercise.
“Come sit with me. I might need you to help me at some point here. I’m a little dizzy.”
It was John’s turn to blink. When Sherlock then decided to lick his sauce covered thumb, John shook his head like trying to clear an Etch A Sketch.
Two hours later. “Can you see my finger? Follow my finger?”
“I assure you, it is still indeed flabbergasting. I don’t know what to say to that.”
“I think this is pretty bad, Sherlock. I can’t feel my legs and my spine feels as though parts of it are misaligned.” A grimace worked its way across John’s face and then he schooled his features.
“Never? You’ve never been with a man?”
“Are you feeling all right?”
“I see at least two things right here.” John pretended not to know the implications of Sherlock’s statement.
“Sherlock’s not afraid of you.”
“She can’t see me laughing in here, Sherlock!”
“You both are. Is it okay if I call Sherlock that once in a while, Rose? I love him very much. Just like I love you.”
Sherlock reached across John and brought the lube between them, opened the cap and poured a bit onto his forefinger. John planted his feet and spread his legs for Sherlock. “Take one of those beautiful fingers of yours, and massage me a bit and then press inside when you think the muscle is relaxed enough, okay?”
“That, right there, is how I know you’ve been great. Because you’re you. And we’re us.” Sherlock collapsed on John then, giving in to finally being on the other side of the pressure he’d placed upon himself. The situation had turned a corner. A positive one.
Sherlock nodded, but he looked flustered. “Are you? All right?”
fish, all at the same place!”
“He’s panicking because we are a family, hopefully forever, and he doesn’t see anything happening to make us stop being that. There’s no exit. No reason for one. He wants us to all be safe because we’re all going to be here forever. No more explosions or accidents. This is our home and homes are supposed to be safe.”
“Oh no. You’ve just realised it, haven’t you?”
He sat down and patted the cushion beside him in invitation. I sat beside him and let out a soft groan of discomfort. Out of the corner of my left eye, I could see him lower his head, focusing on the carpeting under his feet.
“To be fair, life threw you and me together, so I can’t really be too fussed about it.”
“You know what I’ve just realised? John was surprised by something.
“One.”
“Please tell me if I hurt you.”
Sherlock knew what he meant.
Sherlock moved his left arm out from under John’s back and pushed it under his neck. He brought his forehead to John’s and he opened his eyes and exclaimed “John!” as he spasmed and released inside John. He kept rocking inside him, pushing his belly against John’s cock.
“I know I’ve said, many times, that I’m not gay. And I stand by that. I do think I could be bisexual. I’ve never really felt for another man the way I feel for you. There were a few crushes in my younger days, but you? My eyes found you in that lab and I knew I had just met someone who was going to be one of the most important people I was ever going to meet. You had me at ‘Afghanistan or Iraq?’ You had me at ‘Goodbye, John.’ You had me at ‘Forgive me for all the hurt that I caused you.’ You had me as soon as we met. You had me when I thought you were dead. You had me the moment I saw you at that restaurant. You had me while I was married. You had me when I became a widower. You have me now. If I haven’t made you wait too long.”
“Not really the point.”
“I think I need to tell you some things. About my family. We don’t really talk about our pasts very much, do we? I avoid it at all costs in therapy sessions. It’s a well I’d rather not fall into, to be honest. But, we’re addressing some things here. And I think this is good. We normally don’t do this, but I think we should start.”
“John. Hello. Oh. Ew.” John felt Sherlock’s large hand drag across his hair. “Apologies. I appear to have unintentionally sprayed nasal mucus into your hair.”
(I took a bit of creative liberty with the flowers they see during their excursion. The flower wouldn’t have been in bloom at the time of year they were there, but for fun’s purpose, I said it was.)
“Not much you can do right now.”
“How about we stay like we were, hmmm? I think you’ll like it this way. If I do this right, you will be very happy that you have a prostate.”
“This morning, you were right. I wasn’t just preoccupied with our future. It was really difficult to see you lying there like that. Hooked up to machines, looking so tired. I could see the pain you were in; it was all over your face.” John swiped at the bit of crumbs that settled on his chest from the last scone on the plate. He turned to face Sherlock on the sofa.
“Christ. Thank you for that.” John gave the best version of a smile that he had available in his current state. “Could you meet me in the bathroom? I’d like to do this behind another door, in case I make too much noise when you help me reset my shoulder. Don’t want to scare the wee one upstairs.
“Yes, love! With me and papa and nana!”
“All done, if you’re ready to get in there!”
Mr. Holmes brought up two bottles, just in case.
John gave no shits about Sherlock’s exasperated nonsense. “I don’t feel comfortable having them in the flat while Rosie’s here.”
“I always listen to you, John.”
John backed them down the hall, past the kitchen and towards the bathroom and Sherlock followed. Once inside, Sherlock locked the door behind himself, and took a step forward and helped John out of his sling and set it on the counter by the sink. John made for Sherlock’s dressing gown ties and managed to untie it and push it over Sherlock’s shoulders one-handed.
“John. Oh, John. You feel so good. Every time. You feel so good every time.”
The easy part of the extended weekend happened on their first full day. They’d been on a nearby beach, Rosie between Mr. and Mrs. Holmes, dipping their toes in the sea as it lapped at the shore. John and Sherlock trailed behind them, at what they thought was a safe distance. They held hands as they watched Rosie, as she ran towards and then away from the rolling waves, squealing in delight. The bank of The Thames would never be good enough for her again. Mr. Holmes turned to see where his youngest boy had managed to get to and he saw what he’d never dared hoped for: his boy, in the arms of someone he loved, be kissed and held on the beach he played on as a child. He tapped his wife’s arm and jerked his head behind them. Mrs. Holmes squealed louder than Rosie had a few moments before. She jumped in the air in glee and leant down to pick up Rosie and spun her around as well. The trio all turned to see John and Sherlock holding each other while stealing glances between the horizon and each other’s faces. Their detective senses tingled: They felt eyes on them and turned to see the rest of their family dabbing at their eyes, Rosie bouncing on Mrs. Holmes’ hip. “Daddy ‘n Papa kissin’!” Mr. and Mrs. Holmes just stared at Rosie, her declaration stunned them both. She looked as confused by all the fuss as they looked surprised. The jig was up.
“It’ll be quick. Just a fast pull on my arm and I’ll be raring to go.”
“If we can’t work anymore after this… I’ll be sad about that. But not as sad as I would’ve been if I’d lost you tonight. That almost happened.”
“Do me a favour from here on, yeah? Do not be ashamed for saying what you want. Don’t cut into yourself like that. I can’t bear to see you do that anymore.”
“Sherlock.” John bumped Sherlock’s left shoulder with his right. “Hey. You in there?”
“It happens a lot more than I’m proud of!”
“All tied up like a gift for me. Oh, sweetheart. You’ve got yourself all ready for me, too. You look lovely.”
“Yes, darling!”
They’ve not yet passed ‘second base’ in that time, but that’s further than Sherlock’s ever been in his life. John had wanted to keep things slow. Still does. But despite wanting to wait for ‘the good stuff’ to happen when he was feeling up for it, it was becoming more difficult with every second he was around his genius. His. What a lofty thing.
John kissed his nose and stepped out of Sherlock’s embrace. “I’ll be out in a few ticks, okay?” And with that, he turned and headed for the loo.
“Thanks, S’lock.”
“God, I love you.” John kissed Sherlock’s chin and got his right arm around his back and hugged him close. “You know, while the commercial was still playing, I glanced around the flat looking for you.”
“I wuf Papa vewwy much!”
“I don’t know if I’ve ever been this sure about anything before. And that’s after our first time showering together.” John winked at him. Sherlock smiled in return.
“Finally.” Sherlock rolled his eyes.
“Yef, daddy?”
*******************
“This is really nothing, Sherlock. As I said, this is the easy part. When I wake up, things are going to be very different and pretty difficult. We both read about the before and after of this surgery... our eyes are open. We prepared ourselves the best we could. We bought everything we’d need for a few weeks; Rosie’s going to hang out with Mrs. Hudson or Molly during the afternoons in case I need to have a kip. We’re good, Sherlock. Everything’s going to be just fine.” He pulled Sherlock’s hand to his lips and grazed them with a dry, chaste kiss. He returned their hands to the rail between them and searched Sherlock’s face.
Sherlock looked relieved once more; John was guiding him, as was their modus operandi. Sherlock leant forward and helped John get his legs around Sherlock’s lower back and bum.
“John! Come to the kitchen; quickly, please! Make sure Rosie stays away from here!”
“John!!!! JOHN!”
“John? Are you all right? Sherlock shook his head from side to side on his pillow, trying to understand why they were stopping.
“No rebuttal?”
“If that’s the case, then we are, at this moment, talking about the same thing. Besides, my hair is really dirty.”
“Have we still that bottle of wine in the cellar, dear? I think we might be needing it tonight.”
“Oh. I meant to ask you if that was okay a few days ago. I’ve been teaching her to call you papa when she and I have been alone. It was meant to be a surprise, but I suppose I’ve ruined it.”
“I know, John.” He brought their joined hands to his mouth and kissed John’s knuckles.
“I want this to be good for you, John. You’ve been saddled with someone with zero experience in these matters.”
“Ow!!! Fucking hell! Shit!”
“What’s this?”
“No problem. I. I’ll go serve up dinner for Watson and bring you an ice pack. Go settle yourself and I’ll be there in a minute.” With that, Sherlock hurled himself through the door and saw Rosie standing there looking up at him.
Sherlock opened his arms. John set the mugs down on the night table and let himself be held as they swayed. Here comes the sun, indeed.
Sherlock crouched next to the corpse and pulled a set of gloves from his pocket. He ran a finger across the victim’s face and glanced past John and then right back to the body.
“She was, last time I saw her. She was engrossed in that Disney movie about the ice sisters.”
“You really won’t.”
They held each other for a few minutes in the center of their bed, naked and sweaty. And they were so very much in love.
John slid down Sherlock’s thighs and then he knelt between them. “It’s okay, Sherlock. Give me a minute.” He ran his left hand up and down Sherlock’s right thigh to soothe him.
“Who? Who are you like?” I continued to rub his back and pressed my chin to his soft hair.
"Can I kiss you?"
John turned to walk towards the exit, and Sherlock jogged to catch up with him, high-fiving Rosie behind John’s back.
“What are you going to say?”
John craned his neck to see as much of Sherlock as he could. “I’m in your arms, naked, in our shower. This has already been fantastic. Anything else that happens is ice cream on top of a brownie. Enough small talk, let’s get to it then. I’m recovering from surgery and I need to be comforted by my partner.”
“Is that a question?”
John sat back for a moment and slicked up his neglected cock. Without preamble, he lined up and pressed inside. And Sherlock wailed. Sherlock bit his right palm.
“Always.”
“John, I’m going to skip her bath tonight and get her ready for bed. I’ll be right back.” Sherlock left the sofa and lifted Rosie from her high-chair. He took her into the kitchen and wiped off her face and hands, then took her upstairs to change her into her pyjamas and read her a quick story. Sherlock was usually the one to put her down at night. His voice would lull her to sleep; usually without having to even finish one book.
“See? I told you. I’m okay. I'm a bit more concerned about you at the moment, truth be told. This is a pretty common thing around here; what’s going on with you?” John decided his left hand would be better served to thumb across Sherlock’s ghostly-white cheek. Sherlock eased into the touch and let out a jittered breath.
“But, John, there’s absolutely no…”
John took in a large breath and exhaled it with force. Sherlock circled the body, not missing a beat. John stood back from him, watching him hover. To be able to observe Sherlock at work was always something special, but after the last two months, he’s shown no ill effects of being case-less.
It was time for me to toss a nonsequitur at him. “She doesn’t mean anything to me. Irene, that is.
“After what we’ve just done, I think you’ve thanked me enough.”
John’s right hand went to his mouth to try to stifle the laugh that tried to escape. Laughing at Sherlock when he was completely serious would most certainly cause a row.
“I’m glad you listened to me for once.”
“We’ve committed to each other. Long-term. For the rest of our lives, if we understood each other correctly.”
*********************
“That’s my job. Let’s go before I change my mind.”
“You weren’t paying attention, so I figured I’d help you out a bit.”
“I thought I asked for tea a few minutes ago. Whatever happened to that? I’m handicapped, don't forget.” He aimed for serious, but a chuckle followed his words.
“Is your arm all right?”
John could only stand there and vainly try to control his breathing. Lestrade and his team screeched to a halt at the mouth of the alley to head off the suspect as she ran away from the blogger and his detective. She intended to distract, not to kill. At the sight of Sherlock’s blood dripping onto his Belstaff-clad shoulder, John forgot everything they’d been doing that night. Her mission had been accomplished.
“I’m a bit concerned at the amount of swelling I’m seeing here, John. Especially since we’ve iced the injury twice since it occurred. I think you might have underestimated the severity of your injury.”
“You are a knockout, you know that? Look at you. Just, lying there, being perfect. Being mine. Fuck. Sometimes I can’t believe it. That it finally happened for us. I waited so long. And I know you did, too.”
was that nice. “A couple of strokes; if we need more, the bottle’s right there beside us.”
He returned to the flat two hours later, which was earlier than I’d expected. I didn’t hear Rosamund’s lighter footsteps or her laughter. I was lying on my back across the length of our sofa, my right arm across my eyes and the fingertips of my left hand scratching across the carpet. I’d been deleting and reorganising my Mind Palace while I waited for John to return home. If John decided to grant me my last wish, I’d need all the available space I could locate in my Mind Palace.
John didn’t even look up before saying succinctly, “Nope.”
Sherlock clamped his fingers around John’s wrist but took a few seconds to take John’s pulse as they stood there. Elevated. A bit more sweat shone on John’s forehead. A weariness to his face. His right shoulder pressed back, approximately twenty degrees behind his spine. Unconsciously trying to back away. It’s a good thing they’re in the bathroom, then.
When John awoke from his surgery, he was already ensconced in his
“Would you happen to have something else, Molly? The ‘thing’ we were talking about yesterday?” Sherlock’s attempt at nonchalance was noticed immediately.
Sherlock went back to the kitchen, coming through the door John had entered through a few moments before. “What’s happened?”
With that, Sherlock reached underneath John’s pillow, retrieved their bottle of lubricant and then the aforementioned pillow. He sat up, reached for John’s hand and thrust the lube into John’s palm and then laid back and shoved the pillow under his hips and ass. He spread his legs, giving John a tremendous view of the shiny, glass dildo.
John just watched him blink. He released Sherlock’s hip and leaned against the back of the toilet. He went on like that for close to thirty seconds. With a final, pronounced blink, he came back to himself.
“Sherlock, of course you are. You are my family. And I hope I’m yours.
“Welcome back. Where’d you go? Lost you for a bit.”
“I’ve never done this for anyone other than myself, so I’m a bit apprehensive to pursue this endeavour.”
“Sherlock? If you’d like to, I’d like you to take me to bed.”
“John. Please slow down.”
“I’ll meet you in there?”
“That was the first time you told the man you loved him? In the same sentence when you were asking him to help you get married?”
“I’ve always had a complicated relationship with my family. My father was a right bastard. Treated my mother and Harry like they were employees. Harry wasn’t home much as a result. My mother was a cook, and a maid, and his nurse. It never seemed to me that she was ever looked at as an equal in their relationship. He worked, she stayed home and did all of the house things. That arrangement continued long after he retired. He’d be sat in their living room, and she’d be all over the house fussing over everything. Just sipping at his tea, watching her. She always felt guilty if she wasn’t cooking, baking, or cleaning. Never took a moment to herself, at least none that I ever saw. Never mind how he treated me like I was a virus that wouldn't go away. There were times he looked at me like he wanted me to liquefy and slide through the floor.”
“Are you ready to go home, Watson?” Sherlock asked as he took the hand Greg had been holding in his.
“I’m fine, you two. Just tweaked my shoulder a bit on the cargo exchange there.” He bent his neck and winked at his little girl. “I’ll be just fine in a mo’, love. Just need a little ice!”
“Of course, family! Of course, us. You and me. You and Rosie and me. We’re a team, the three of us. A blogging doctor, a mad genius detective and a three-year-old that manages to repeat every bad word she hears.”
She clapped her hands and shrieked with glee. John looked at him with gratitude. Sherlock winked.
“If you’re having reservations, it’s probably best not to bring that up now.”
“But why all of a sudden? This is hardly the first time I’ve had things of that nature in the flat in the last three years.“
“Nope! Not an adventure. Not even close!”
Sherlock tried to sit up, always trying to follow John wherever he went, but his body hadn’t quite caught up to his brain. As usual.
They were finally able to hold each other after the specialists left the room.
“Sherlock?”
John knelt in between Sherlock’s knees and pushed inside in one slippery slide: Sherlock looked like he was about to convulse.
So John did. Sherlock growled.
“If it’s all right with you, I’d like to work on that with you, sweetheart.” John reached for Sherlock and scratched his scalp with his trimmed nails. Sherlock hummed in agreement.
to naked, save for his crooked pants, which rested on his bony left hip. Legs for a mile. What a lucky bastard he was.
"What’s he say about it? What rating would he give it?"
“Let me see if you’re ready for me. Gotta make this nice and smooth and slick for my husband. Don’t wanna do anything to hurt his beautiful body.”
“I’m going to hold you to that.”
He heard another squirt and heard Sherlock sigh. That was the first time he’s touched himself since they started. Sherlock pushed himself between John’s knees and kissed each one. He leaned forward and pressed a kiss to John’s erection and it twitched in response.
“Do whatever you do to yourself. I’m sure that will be plenty good enough for me.”
"Oh no. I just realised. I’ve not hugged you at all, properly, since we started, um, being us. I would like to remedy that immediately, if you don’t mind.” He put his glass of whisky on his tea table and smiled at Sherlock. Sherlock did the same, the base of his wine glass sounded delicate as it tapped against his table. They sat on the edge of their chairs and looked at each other. They weren’t able to hide behind the glasses anymore."
"I see you, Sherlock. I see everything you are and everything you've done for me."
(See the end of the chapter for
“What do we have?”
John spent the first thirty-six hours waiting for the nerve block to wear off. He waited and stared at his arm as it lagged in its sling, useless and droopy. He willed his fingers to wiggle, but it was no use. Medical science was a marvel. Until it wasn’t. The burning and painful tingling receded over the course of a few hours, but then the pain from his six incisions roared to the forefront. Sherlock set a timer on his phone and gave John his Co-Dydramol every four hours. Sherlock was never further away than the kitchen. At a few points, John wanted to be left alone, to suffer in silence, and not worry Sherlock. Knowing Sherlock the way he did, John should’ve known better. Sherlock just spent the hours they were apart listening with a keen ear for a moment when he could sense John would need him. He was right every time.
I shook my head again. Had to keep denying. “He’s my best friend, Cara.”
“Not like that. I know you like me, but you don’t LIKE me.”
“What should I do?” Sherlock tried not to panic.
John pushed his right arm from under the pillow and placed his hand on Sherlock’s right cheek, pushing him to turn his neck. Sherlock obliged and John nipped under his ear and kissed his cheek.
John got his right arm under Sherlock’s back for leverage and brought his left up to Sherlock’s face. Instinctively, Sherlock’s arms and legs wound themselves around John’s back and arse and squeezed, as he mimicked what John’d done all the times they’d done it that way.
Sherlock took a deep breath to try to relax. “I put her to bed about fifteen minutes ago. She’s fine. Let’s worry about you right now, shall we?” With that sentiment, John vomited again. Sherlock got on his knees beside John and ran his fingers through John’s hair and then up and down his neck while he was bent over the toilet. Sherlock reached for a flannel from the nearest towel rail and wiped the sweat that had accumulated along John’s hairline. He kissed John’s nape.
“I am definitely okay with waiting until later.” His breathing was laboured and was escaping him in forceful puffs.
“I just told you. I’m going to lie down for a bit, upstairs so she doesn't see me hurting like this.”
“Oh! He’s sleeping, love!” He was surprised at how easily the lie came to him.
“John? Are you sure you’re okay?” Sherlock took a step forward and placed his left hand between the wings of John’s shoulder blades.
Sherlock looked at the ceiling for a few moments. “Oh dear.”
John’s hand on the back of Sherlock’s nape pushed at his neck, pressing him as close as they could be. John whispered as Sherlock resumed thrusting:
“I’m fine. Just needed to catch my breath there a minute before I stand up. Don’t need to get wobbly and swoon like a Disney princess.”
“Angelo was a bit overly enthusiastic that evening.” Sherlock rolled his eyes and snickered at the memory.
. “Would you mind if we sat on the sofa?”
“Thankfully, not literally.”
How do you tell someone that the biggest mystery of your life has just worked itself out so simplistically on a picnic bench in Regent’s Park?
“I’m not very good at accepting help, but you’ve made me better at that. I promise to let you help me.”
“This is going to happen. I’m going to unwrap you, and thank you for being here with me, ten years after we first met.”
“John. You’re lying down. You’re going to fall asleep.”
It was nearing eight o’clock, Rosie’s bedtime.
“Banooooffeeee!” It was one of the only words she was able to pronounce correctly at her age.
He could only shake his head. “You're lovely, Sherlock. I can’t believe this. This is happening. You’re so lovely, and you’re mine, at least I hope you’re mine, and I’ve never loved anyone like I’ve loved you and you’re doing this with me, and I’m not sure how I should feel about it.” He gasped for breath, the enormity of their circumstance pushed all of those words out in one go.
. And he would be trapped in it for the majority of the next six to eight weeks. Sherlock managed to wrangle John and his newest appendage into a cab and back to their home. As Sherlock fiddled with the lock at the front door, John sighed.
“Oh, sweetheart. Oh no.” John’s left hand drifted over the raised lines and then suddenly stopped. He pressed his front to Sherlock’s back and draped his left arm across Sherlock’s belly.
“I think I misspoke last night during my little diatribe about how amazing you are. I forgot to mention the night Rosie was born. That was one of the most beautiful experiences of my life. I was the first person to see her. I delivered her on the backseat of my and Mary’s car. I’d have to say that’s got to be tied with you.”
John couldn’t hide the grin on his face as he sat next to Rosie and waited for Sherlock to bring the pot to the centre of their table.
Sherlock gathered John to him and held him, John’s resolve dissolving, and he let himself be held and began to cry against Sherlock’s chest. “Disappoint me? There is nothing you could possibly do that would disappoint me. I know what kind of man you are, John. You’re the most tenacious man I know. You will come through the other side of this an even better version of yourself. You’re not alone. You are loved. Please don’t give up.”
“It’s all right, Sherlock. I love that she loves you as much as she loves me. I would never discourage her love for you.”
They managed to get Rosie settled into bed around half-seven. After they both gave her a kiss goodnight, they made their way down the stairs together.
“Nice and slow, Sherlock. I love that sound. Am I hitting that spot for you? Deep inside you? Am I, love? Let me hear that blissful sound again.”
“Did you leave the lube under the pillows like I said last night?”
“All of this drama will be over in a few hours, Sherlock. Stop fretting.”
“It said on a website to make sure the sufferer was able to answer basic questions, to test visual cognition, to make sure they rested and had ice applied to the injury.” Sherlock looked frazzled and a bit sad.
“Christ. Do we really think that’s okay to have in the flat with Rosie?”
“I know, love. I know. I love you, Sherlock.”
“Here comes the aeroplane!!!” Sherlock had the audacity to make engine noises as he approached John’s open mouth, the fork poised at his open mouth.
“You’re not making any sense.”
“Did I ask you a question?”
“I’m not surprised! I’m angry! I’m angry for you! I’m angry for us! I’m furious that life keeps handing us shit to deal with!”
Sherlock smiled at the compliment and rubbed his hand, with a bit of pressure, along John’s shoulder blade. He’s been making great strides with his therapy. According to his therapists, he’s meeting or exceeding all the normal expectations of his surgical recovery. Sherlock’s went to as many of John’s sessions as he’d been able. He watched the therapists and asked questions. They even showed him a few at home that he could help John with. This was John’s favourite:
“Sherlock! Where’s Rosie?”
Rosie was still giggling until she turned around and saw her father’s face. Her lips began to pout and her eyes immediately became wet.
“John! Oh, no. John. I’m going to come. I’m sorry. I don’t think I can stop it.” His head thrashed side to side on his pillow.
At John’s words, Sherlock’s procession to the door halted.
“Jesus Christ, I already want to rip this bloody thing off and watch it get run over by a lorry and dragged down Baker Street!”
John pushed inside and Sherlock released a whine that he would deny making if you’d asked him.
“Are you saying that is something you’d be interested in pursuing with me?”
After unlocking the door and kicking it open with a gentle push from his left foot, he put his left arm around John’s back and helped him inside, being extra careful not to bump his shoulder and brace against the door’s frame. He let John lead the way up the stairs but stayed close behind him in case he became dizzy during their ascent. The staff in charge of him at the hospital gave him a snack and some water and let him go home two hours after he woke from the anaesthesia. Sherlock told them John was in good hands and that there was someone else at home who would be able to help him look after their patient. Now, John was Sherlock’s patient.
“It’s been quite the day, hasn’t it?”
"It’s a good thing I won’t stoop to your level and make jokes about your height."
John came up for air and wiped his lips and chin. “Sherlock. I think I’m okay. This is normal for concussions.”
“I could stay awhile; hold this thing there until it melts. Let you get some more sleep.”
“I can help out a bit now. I promise.”
“And? Why are you so confused by that?”
“I go with you if it’s time for you. Not gonna be apart from you again.” John’s thrusts intensified, his aim for Sherlock’s prostate unerring.
Forty-five minutes later, Sherlock returned to the kitchen to find John sitting on his stool and watched him tie off the last stitch. He dragged another stool to his workspace and sat next to John.
“I’ll get you sorted, for once. It’s my turn now.”
Sherlock woke first. He’s been unconscious for only a few minutes. A bump on the head and a cut to his brow. An icepack and a plaster. John, on the other hand, caught the worst of their accident. The bus was lying on his side of the vehicle and had severely pushed in the driver’s side of the car.
“John. You already said that. A few hours ago.” Sherlock's jaw immediately set itself.
John knew the best way to get Sherlock out of his head was to get him talking, and if getting him to be a smug prat was the way to achieve that end, those were the means John was prepared to traverse.
“I’m going to tell him that I love him and that I know he loves me too.” For the first time since the conversation started, I felt my spine straighten. I hadn’t felt that sort of determination in a very long time.
Three and a half hours later:
“It’s all right. I’ve plenty of them.” John smiled. For the first time in a long time, he genuinely beamed.
“No. You just said you would have two geniuses in the house for the rest of your life.”
“And why the hell not?”
“I have done nothing to repay you. I’m such a shit. I punched you, kicked you. I didn’t even realise I’d not apologised to you until a few seconds ago! I look at you now and see the stitches on your brow. I see you withdrawing from whatever cocktail of drugs you were taking to get me to notice you weren’t okay.” He began to rock back-and-forth in a self-soothing motion, his disgust with himself on full display. As dismayed as I was to the whole of it, I was honoured that he’d let me see this side of him.
Sherlock spent a few minutes massaging John, as John’s eyes closed and he sighed. Sherlock saw him settle and then turn his head to face him.
“Was that all right?”
“John, Sherlock? If you guys would like to talk to a counselor or…”
“If, at any point, you both decide that you are willing, to put as much of the situation aside as you’re able to, she and I would be truly honoured and blessed to have you as part of her family.”
“Right here, darling. What’s up?” John leant to his right side to face her and forced a smile for her.
“Hello, John!” Her eyes fell upon the sling: “You’re looking, oh my! That thing is rather cumbersome, isn’t it?”
“Just because you’re an arrogant git doesn’t mean you’re not right almost all the time. You’ve rubbed off a bit.”
John sighed, knowing exactly what I meant.
“Jesus Christ. Look. At. You.”
After the heartbreaking events of Sherrinford, Molly and Sherlock had a few coffee and lunch dates to talk through some things. He was able to explain to her what happened that day, and they’ve been all the better for it. Over two years later, she was now one of his closest friends. A role she’d already mastered, but neither of them truly realised it. I guess there was one thing to thank Eurus for after all.
“I think we owe Mike a night out, our treat. As a thank you, don’t you think?”
“Hello, Sherlock.” John felt so much love for him at that moment, he wasn’t sure he’d be able to conceal it.
“Yes, thanks for the reminder. I was married to Brad for eleven years. Sometimes, the person you’re supposed to be with doesn’t fit with your pattern. Before Brad, I’d only ever really been with women. You fall for a person, not a gender. I’d only dated one man before I met Brad, but when I met him, it was instant. I knew that he was going to be someone who was going to be important to me for the rest of my life. Even though we’re not together anymore, he’s still my son’s father, and I love him very much. And I always will. Just not that way, now. We’ve made peace with it.”
“Nothing. He said nothing.” I could only stare at her across the table.
Sherlock slid his arms around John’s shoulders instead, and John’s settled around SHerlock’s waist.
“That is a wonderful idea. Give me one second, darling. I’m going to ease the plug out. Hold on for me.” John grasped the circular base and gently eased it out of Sherlock's hole. As it slid free, Sherlock sighed. He was so content.
John’s head tilted in that adorable way that some canines have.
“Just keep an eye on me and make sure I don’t present with any concussion symptoms.”
“Now just lie back and think of England.”
For the following three days of his recovery, he laid about on the sofa, watched telly, and became frustrated with his situation. It seemed to him, that every task he tried to attempt was more laborious than the one previous. There were even more things that he and Sherlock didn’t think of that were to prove themselves difficult or impossible. John was able to perform a few of the easier tasks around the flat when he realised he was able to slide his arm forward in the sling to free his fingers to help him hold onto things. Mainly Rosie.
Sherlock walked, in spite of himself, to the far side of the bed. He laid next to John on his right side and brought up his left hand to securely hold the ice pack to John’s shoulder. He tucked his chest behind John’s neck, so he was able to curl himself around him. He rested his right temple on his right fist on his folded arm and he held the ice pack in place. He watched the rise and fall of John’s back as John fell asleep.
John sat up and looked at my eyes, disbelief all over his face.
“Then stop talking and get to it before she wakes up!”
“If you need anything, Rosamund, I’ll be down the hallway looking in on your father.” She nodded but didn’t seem to really hear what he said. He figured he had about fifteen minutes before she was seeking him out. She usually wanted company while she watched telly.
“Oh, John. That display back at the flat? That was a man who was trying to keep secret the fact that he’s bloody terrified. And he was absolutely horrid in his attempt.”
John could feel the scars again on Sherlock’s back as his right hand flitted across the injured expanse of flesh. Sherlock lifted his head and looked at John, realisation finally hitting him. They’d never had this conversation. Sherlock had made it a point of keeping this from him. He never walked around the flat shirtless after he came home from Serbia. Even during the last few months, even while sleeping together in the same bed, Sherlock made sure to never expose his back to John. He wore a t-shirt every night and never changed in front of him. Even during their liaison in the shower, Sherlock never revealed his back.
“All right, my little flower, let’s get you upstairs and into your own bed.” Instantly awake, Sherlock rose to help John sit up.
“Dinner’s ready!” Sherlock yelled out to the sitting room. And then he promptly blew his nose.
Sherlock stood, peeled off his gloves and pulled his phone from his pocket. He tapped at it for a few seconds and waited. John looked at him, completely perplexed. A few seconds later, he heard Rosie’s voice accompanied by Lestrade's. As the duo approached, a few members of Lestrade’s team moved in around the woman across the street and brought her to a panda car to be questioned.
“I think I’ve always wanted that with you. But you’ve always tried to say you weren’t like that; you didn’t do things like that. You putting me off didn’t really work, you know. Just because you turned the extinguisher on me doesn’t mean you got all the fire, Sherlock. I’ve been smouldering for you for a very long time. I’ve been interested in you, in that way, since I first saw you. I admit, I didn’t make my feelings for you very clear. In fact, I made them quite the opposite of what I’m trying to do right now.”
“You are too good for me.”
“If you keep your hand on my shoulder blade, I can. The heat from your hand is helping.” John is at home, lying on his belly, his left arm hanging off the side of the bed. Sherlock is kneeling on the floor, his right hand supporting John’s left shoulder blade.
Sherlock blushed, just like John expected.
Sherlock was only able to nod.
“I know how much you like it when I do.”
He scrambled from his seat next to Rosie as John walked towards her. “My little sweetheart, you get up here with me and have a little dance, yeah?”
As if Sherlock hadn’t said a word, John tiptoed into the room, paying close attention to the placement of his feet.
“With his typical Sherlockian sass. Or nonchalance. Or silence, like he’s not heard me. None of those things are atypical for him.”
Their romantic coupling began as many in their life had thought it would: There was a case, a cornered suspect, and a poor decision was made when her liberty was threatened. When the suspect brandished and fired a pistol at the pair, Sherlock did as he has always done when John’s safety was in jeopardy: He stepped in danger’s line of sight. As he pushed John from the path of the weapon’s bullet, he was grazed by it, causing a small sliver of skin to be torn from his right earlobe. At the sight of it, John’s face immediately paled as his hands grazed all over Sherlock’s face and neck. He removed his own scarf and put it to Sherlock’s bleeding ear.
I pulled him closer to me. “Stop saying that. You’re putting me off.”
“Of course, love!”
John glanced up from his laptop and felt his stomach swoop. He swallowed hard and tried to tamp down the flashes of memories he was having. His little girl was sitting next to him on the sofa, going on excitedly about fish and sharks, not knowing that her mother
“I’m allowed to take a shower tonight, right?”
“I’m going to take the less pessimistic route for one of the few times in my life and say that I am happy that this ever happened at all.” Sherlock sat back and kissed John’s forehead. John leaned back, his eyes looking a bit dazed. Fatigue was beginning to settle in his bones.
Sherlock starts
“Come here, Sherlock. I haven’t hugged you in a very long time. And now I can do it adequately."
“I don’t think so.” John thought Sherlock looked confused. He sort of liked that, since it was such a rare occurrence.
“Interesting choice of words, by the way. You’re obviously bi-sexual. It’s all over you.”
“For ages. Go ahead. You’re not going to hurt me.”
Sherlock’s face looked impossibly sad. “I’m sorry, John.”
Sherlock actually hopped on his feet as John worked to convince himself to go along. He daren’t interrupt.
A sudden shot of empathy ascended my spine and settled at the base of my skull, a headache trying to fester itself into existence. I wished that Mary and I could’ve reached that level of maturity instead of me stooping to an emotional affair and the two of us constantly sniping at each other before she died.
"I’ve not received many of those, so I couldn’t really comment."
“Cara, I don’t know what to do.”
“I dropped a flask on the table and it bumped into a few pipettes and they all landed on the floor! Stay where you are; you’re barefooted!”
“Thank you, John. I really hope you like my present for you.”
“You need to ask yourself something: What has recently happened that would make John have such an about-face about something that hadn’t been an issue before today?”
“It should feel weird, this. But it doesn’t. It feels new, but not weird. This should be awkward, shouldn’t it? Me and you, sitting here like this? It just feels like we’ve been doing this for ten years instead of three weeks.”
“I just want a part of you inside of me. Preferably the part you promised me a few minutes ago!”
London Zoo it was.
“Yes, John. I am. I bumped my head and I think I might be bleeding a bit. Something feels sticky on my forehead. Otherwise, I’m fine.”
“Would you like some more?”
Sherlock stayed in the loo for fifteen minutes until he felt comfortable enough to go into the bedroom. True to his word, John was already in bed. He glanced over to the night table to John’s right, and saw a bottle of lubricant, a package of Rosie’s nappy wipes, and a box of tissues. Sherlock stood and stared at the items while draped in his burgundy dressing gown.
“Watson? How would you like to go on a really boring case with us?” He said it in such a way as one might to a pet to make them do something they’d regret doing. As long as the tone is positive they’re usually up for it. Rosie turned out to be no different.
“Of course. You’re always right. I agree that we should keep the more precarious experiments out of the flat. Especially as Rosie gets older.”
*******************************************************************************
Sherlock didn’t need to be convinced. John kissed the back of Sherlock’s neck and pulled him tighter to his chest. He settled in John’s embrace and sighed contentedly. “You’re like a giant house cat.” John tangled their legs together. “There you go. We need some rest now.”
On every forward drag, the head of John’s cock pressed against that sensitive nub of nerves. Each time, a wave of pleasure pushes itself through Sherlock’s veins, circling through his body like a shot of cocaine. Sherlock’s hands tingled with pleasure as they made their way softly up John’s sides.
"I’m most excited to not have to sleep on my back tonight! I must thank you again, for the arrangement you conceived to help me with that."
“I hate you so much.”
“WHAT’S THE MATTER? WHAT’S HAPPENED?” Sherlock yelled.
“I’ll go get you some water. Be right back.”
“You have to be able to laugh during sex. Funny shit can happen.”
“You’ve been distracting me for years. Okay. Stop it now. No more giggling.”
“I’ve been a guest here for five days, and you’ve yet to let me help! My physical therapists said it was all right, as long as I don’t get involved with dishes that need a lot of scrubbing. Too much pressure on the shoulder joint for where I am in my recovery. But I can handle that!”
“You couldn’t possibly think you’re faster than a bullet? Do you?” The exasperation was fond.
“I know that. You’re the one arguing the point. I offered to assist you. Instead of having your self-worth debate internally, you’ve chosen to voice it out loud.”
Sherlock did as John said. After a few chaste presses of lips, John traced Sherlock’s bottom lip with his tongue. Sherlock bucked against him. John’s left hand went to Sherlock’s lower back and slid back and forth, helping him to further relax. John continued the kiss, but began to nip and his lips. The flood of sensations were very new to Sherlock, and he began to rut against John’s stomach. By this point, John was already hard, but he wanted to make sure Sherlock was loosened up enough to proceed.
“I mean it. The first HINT. We go and let Lestrade and his team handle it.”
“I'm so sorry, John. I'm so sorry I hurt you that profoundly. That was never my intention. I want to talk to you about that someday whenever you’re able. I don't think today is a good day for that, I agree with you.” I winced and wished, not for the first time, for John to be as unobservant as I always tell him he is.
“Daddy?”
“While you were away?”
“It’s all right, John. I wanted to check on you and see if you wanted something to eat.” He shuffled his feet as John blinked up at him.
“And you did?”
John’s hips stuttered, and he collapsed on Sherlock’s sweat-slicked body. Sherlock’s arms tightened around him and crushed John against him. They held each other until oversensitivity threatened. They reluctantly disentangled themselves. John went back to kneeling between Sherlock’s legs, and he sat on his heels.
“Is a counselor going to be able to tell me why John and I keep getting shit shoved down our throats?” With that, he exited the doctor’s office and slammed the door behind himself.
“John, that flower contains a genome fifteen times larger than a humans! I have to see what it look like on a microscope’s stage! Thank you, Watson!” Sherlock kissed her forehead and then her cheek.
He queued the song up on his phone as he heard John tinking the spoon around in Sherlock’s mug. He got out of bed and slipped on the dressing gown he’d hung on the back of the bedroom door last evening. He opened the door as John was walking down the hall, still humming, his phone still in his hand.
“John.”
“Hello, my darling! How’s my niece this morning?”
“Sweetheart! Wait! Stop for a second!"
“It’s fine.” Sherlock barely blinked.
"More importantly, are you all right? You’ve had a bit of a big day."
“It’s okay, Sherlock.” He leaned forward and claimed Sherlock's lips and swallowed down every gasp as he began a slow drag inside him. They’ve done this hundreds of times. In so many ways. But it never gets old.
Rosie was too busy splashing in the bathtub to hear the panic in Sherlock’s voice. “Sure, Da! I’m not a baby. I’m eight-years-old!”
“Well, that remains to be seen.”
“I didn’t want the sauce to go to waste. For frozen lasagne, I’m still surprised it tastes as good as it does. A serviette didn’t deserve that sauce.”
“Cara? Hamish? This is my friend, Sherlock Holmes.” Hamish waved timidly from the floor where he’d settled with Rosamund.
“You’ll be the first to know.” Sherlock pinched his right knee. Then kissed it for good measure.
“What?”
“WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT?” Sherlock was not only angry, but he became defensive.
