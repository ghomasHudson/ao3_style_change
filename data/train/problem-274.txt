“But we love each other.”
John shrugged. “You said you didn't want a mate.”
When John repeated his blame for the tenth time, Mycroft stepped forward, hanging his umbrella from his left arm and gave John a good clap across the cheek. “Now is not the time to die in self-pity, John, Sherlock is still out there, in danger, and he needs his mate sharp!” the taller man snapped and John wondered briefly, woken a little by the unexpected action, just what it was Mycroft did for a living.
Sherlock regarded him in mild surprise. “You are going to accept an
The grin turned into a loving gaze, followed by a dreaming gaze directed in front of him as he tugged his mate along on their way until their rhythms evened out and they marched in step, taking a moderate length of a detour to Angelo's. The further they went, though, the more Sherlock started to lean into John either unconsciously or in the hope of not being found out.
“Mrs. Hudson!”
“Alright,” he said, ordering the other men to set Sherlock's legs back down, ”Mr. Holmes, your after is neither swollen nor dilated, only reddened. As long as you don't excrete any larger clumps, I don't see your pup in necessary danger, however, I would advise you to see your doctor as soon as possible. When is your next regular check-up?”
He, in return opened up expectantly, enjoying the feeling of John's tongue exploring, warm breath against his lips. God, he was already aroused again. Surely that could not be the standard of his life now, could it? Laying in bed for days and marvelling over being kissed, internally begging for more like a pathetic, little, dependent Omega with the need for his Alpha to take care of him, spoil him, toady him like he couldn't take care of himself. The thought alone was revolting enough for him to shove John back and shuffle out of his bed to pad off to the bathroom. John's concerned call he only answered with some mumbling. He didn't follow him, however.
John's expression fell and he felt a weird sense of disappointment and sadness. He hadn't expected Sherlock to suddenly like his kids. He couldn't explain why he was so unhappy in that moment. Kat noticed it and was confused. She made a noise that was their version of 'papa' and he looked back into her confused face. She was a clever girl. He pulled her into his lap and cuddled her, wearing a fake smile. Luckily, their bond to him was not as sharp as the one they shared with each other, so they couldn't detect the lie just yet, though it would only be a matter of time.
It was John's turn to frown. “No,” he quickly put the cutlery down. “no, not at all. Sherlock- no!” he emitted a deep sigh. “I do
! John was a soldier, had been to war. Stupid.
The speed with which John propped himself up on one elbow to stare at Sherlock in sheer horror was frankly quite remarkable, even if worryingly so. “It's just- I mean... Nothing to fret, John... Did I agree to bond?”
He let go of the knife and reached behind himself, carding his hand into Sherlock's soft curls. He turned his head around and Sherlock pulled away a little, looking back at John for a long minute. The kiss that followed was short and apologetic as well as grateful, from both sides. When it ended, they lingered, breathing each other in. John gave him another quick peck that felt like a little promise before turning back to his vegetables.
Sherlock was boiling across from him, he could feel it through their bond, if he was blind enough not to see it on the man's face. “Good God, John, you are behaving like an idiot! I WANT SEX!” he boomed, slamming his fist on the table. John barely flinched, however there was an unmistakeable squeak coming from the living room. Mrs Hudson's footsteps on the stairs were expectedly quick in their retreat.
Sherlock nodded lightly. “Good.” he said just for the sake of having said something.
“Your fathers love you. I say that just for you to know and to never forget. Whatever happens, however much you might hate us sometime – we will always love you and we will be there for you.” he said to the cells inside his body, feeling like it was a confession to make.
One-handed, John freed their necessary parts of their clothing, grabbed a bit of lube, pretended to prepare Sherlock for half a minute and then slammed his cock in to the hilt. A sigh, a quick breath and the Alpha was hammering into Sherlock, who could only keep his position just so by trying to push back with his hands grabbing at the bedsheets. His lower back hurt from the position and John seemed eager to carve a map of London into his back and arse with his fingernails.
“We'll have to ask Gunther then.”
Sherlock, whilst already risen out of his mind palace, remained in his position, not reacting to John, not because he didn't want to speak to him, but because he wanted the Omega to initiate the conversation. After a while, John cleared his throat carefully. It would have to do, Sherlock thought and opened his eyes to look at him, but still not speaking. He looked at John with a clear expression of expectation. John turned his head slightly as if checking Sherlock wasn't addressing someone else. Eventually, though, John did speak. “I, er... can I ask you a question?”
So astonished was I that it was several agonizing moments before I ceased my fish-like gaping and answered, “Certainly not. Even if I had a million shillings, they would not be up for borrowment from you.” I had thought to be a rather keen bit of dispute but he seemed unbothered by it and merely pulled a rumpled piece of pound from his trousers. The boy’s jaw drops as it is placed into his open hands.
“No. Lie back down if you please.” He obeyed, disgruntled, and threw an arm across his eyes. His forehead and cheeks were decorated with a panoply of bruises and smaller cuts like a child’s shell adorned sandcastle and, in order to reach them, I removed his arm, heavy with muscle in my hand.
“Hmm?” Holmes had left my presence to scrounge through my coat pockets and found my cigarette and matches and was in the action of lighting one. “Oh yes. I seldom am incorrect.”
“I’m moving out. I was here to return my keys.”
“I’m sure your wife wouldn’t mind serving us. Let’s wake her up, shall we? I think there’s an interesting conversation to be had with her about one Lila Poseybloom, of Olyphants’ Music Hall fame.”
Honeycomb threw an elbow over his nose, edging around the room to be as far as possible from the scene. “That is disgusting.” He held himself back from retching. I couldn’t blame him; I was equally nauseated.
I retired to what remained of my whisky, intending to get ridiculously drunk with the little cash that would have gone towards my winnings to pay my landlord. If I was to spend the night on the street, there was no reason for me to remember it.
“The bastard’s stolen my dog!” I cried. I made for the front steps only to be jerked back by a strong arm around my middle, knocking the wind from me.
“Yes,
Swiftly, I knelt, my knees hit with a shock of pain from the hard floor, and took him by the waist, pushing up the hem of his shirt to see the dreadful cut adorned with dried blood and half-scabbed; obviously, it had not been treated. I interrupted his protestations. “Have you seen a doctor yet?”
The smaller man took only the briefest of pauses before charging at his opponent, bypassing him entirely with a spin to land a kick on the back of his knee. The larger man collapsed flat on his ample stomach, but managed to thrust himself from the dusty ground and, faster than I would have given him credit for, twisted and sliced the smaller man across the stomach. Rubies trailed in seedlings down his stomach and my breath caught in my throat.
“The whisky you have so generously offered Watson and myself is a poor brand. Cheap. And your furnishings are quite bare. There aren’t even any pillows on your bed. Yet you still have the funds to have a fresh suit and to have attended the barbers' recently. A man who tries to look his best and spend the time he could be in bed with his wife in his kitchen with a dog. Rather odd don’t you think.
Loyal to a fault, he leapt up and moved back enough for me to enter, fall to my knees, and rub his ears.
In my average day, I had little interaction with children. Even before my unemployment, rarely were my clients ever below the age of fifteen and when they were of ankle-biting age, they at least did me the courtesy of speaking to me directly.
“These deductions led me to mistake your lawful wife as your paramour, Lila Poseybloom. For only a woman who is not concerned about the welfare of vulnerable children, who leaves a key free in the hallway for someone who possessing such a key on their person would be a suspicion, who lives in a squalor that shows they are unbeholden to another person’s comfort led me to believe this apartment belonged to a bachelorette. Obviously I am wrong.
“Sorry Lila,” said Holmes, poking his head through the door. He brought with him a sheaf of light that not only blinded myself and Honeycomb for a split second but illuminated the fearsome countenance of Mrs Honeycomb which sparked with fury.
“Know what?”
I was chatting - shouting, rather - with the chap next to me on the champion of last night’s brawl when a deafening holler drew our attention to the ring. A puff of dirt flew up from the ground and in its place lay a knife - a blunt, craftless thing, perhaps was seen as harmless by whoever threw it, but my profession had taught me the danger of blades of all keenness - which was promptly snatched away by the larger man.
There was a low murmur, shuffling, but no one answered. The man shrugged.
“That’s it,” said Honeycomb, regaining some semblance of dignity, “get out.”
“You mean you’re going to go?” Holmes said, his voice soaring with hope.
“What if-” another laugh, “we went in together? As a united front. Two against one would have a much better chance of convincing your landlord to free his hostage. Besides, you might need someone skilled in the art of combat if things get hairy.”
“My god. He really did, didn’t he?” said Holmes, unable to suppess a bemused smile.
I spun to find Holmes offering up a sheaf of pounds, an arm wrapped around his middle. At first, I was quite perturbed: I
With a suspicious lift on my chin, I asked, “And how did
“I suppose that makes it mine now.” As soon as he left the ring it was swarmed by men ready to spirit away the infirm to a hospital. I was swept up in the rabble and was able to communicate my profession to the crowd - not without sincere effort however, the rumble of talk had returned ferociously and people were attempting to tug him up by the broken arm; I had to knock a few patrons about to get close enough to scream - in order to set the wounded arm for the ride away. It was a clean break and once it was wrapped up, the man could limp on his own out of the place.
It was a decidedly jolly way to spend my evening, oscillating between the barrier of the ring and the makeshift bar, cups of brandy and neat sprays of blood from connecting fists. I did stick closer to the bar, not out of any sense of intemperance, but because viewing the needless violence of the fight went against my good nature: it was a doctor’s office to heal maladies, not facilitate them, so I comforted myself by believing the money I would earn would go towards my career of doing such good and that was
“Yes, Daddy.”
Fosberry popped his head past the doorframe. “Upstairs is a bed and a basin,” the fellow conveyed brightly.
“Doesn’t matter. You never said ‘e ‘ad to be gone, only that I ‘ad to tell ‘im.”
Halfway to tipsy, a reluctant fist tugged on my sleeve and I, in a garish display of flailing limbs from out of a contemplative stupor, nearly hit the child who was the owner of the fist. A scruffed up urchin it was, somewhere in the valley of eight to ten, no doubt hired to sweep sawdust over bloodstains in the ring for a tuppence, but with a pair of keen eyes that gripped me acutely.
the day of eviction instead of ahead of it? But he lets his mistress stay rent-free, next door to his
“So, due to the complex nature of your personal life and the amount of cash it would take to feed this beast of a pup, I dub Mr Watson the better home for Gladstone to attend.”
“But to punch one must be orientated on one’s feet.” Again, in excitement, he swung his legs over the side of the bed and leaned closer so we were nose to nose and the waft of his whisky breath crept inside my nostrils. “Another instance you failed to noticed was the length of his legs, the nature of his gait. A fraction shorter was his right leg to the left. You may be forgiven for such a mistake had he been wearing his boots as the base of the right shoe was stuffed with stockings to even out his mismatched steps. To get him to his knees, all I needed to do was exploit this weakness. The fight would have been decisively mine had that blasted knife been thrown into the mix, forcing me to improvise. And, like all good games, something might require sacrifice to win.” He ran his palm over his bandaged torso. “Luckily that sacrifice did not result in my victory being Pyrrhic.”
“You aren’t taking him anyway,” Honeycomb said.
“Old man,” I spluttered with some indignity. They both ignored me.
“He’ll leave soon, don’t worry.” Honeycomb swept over to her and lifted her under her arms up onto the table like she was as light as a kitten and handed her a cup of milk. She drank it all in one go, and Honeycomb, crouching down to her level, looked her straight in the eye. “Are you ready to go back to bed now?”
The trunk, my trunk I should confirm before I continue, was split open on the street and pools of clothes, my clothes, were scattered about the grit of the cobblestones. Shirts, trousers, suit jackets out of sorts like severed body parts in a gruesome murder scene.
I attempted to climb over the barrier to aid the poor man, but I was wrenched back by my collar and watched helplessly as a rasp told me I’d get myself killed if I didn’t stay sharp.
“Watson, you’re just in time. You wouldn’t happen to know where this gent keeps his teabags? It was my idea that a little nip would do us all some good.” He turned to me, and his face lit up. “This must be Gladstone!” He knelt, rubbing my boy’s ears. “We’ve gone through an awful lot of trouble to get you, haven’t we? Haven’t we? I’ve got something for you.” Out of his pocket, he drew the soggy piece of meat he had been using on his eye at the boxing match.
“Gladly. Watson, Gladstone.”
“Very well. You drive a hard bargain, my short friend.” He rifled around in his pockets, the rustling of paper was louder than any clinking of pence. He glanced at me. “You wouldn’t happen to have a shilling I could borrow.”
“Unhand me.” My voice came out strained. “I need to rescue my dog.”
“I’ve never heard that rule before. I do believe I shall stay until I myself choose to live. You may take it up with your employer should he take umbrage with my decision.”
“Yes, of course, my dear,” he said sheepishly.
Instead of releasing Gladstone onto the floor where I could scoop him up and make a run for it, he opened a second door and tossed him inside. Rather roughly as my poor dear fellow made quite the squeal when he landed.
“But why is he in our house?”
“It must really be Monday by now,” Holmes mused.
“Strong! Yes!” He cried and sat up with the speed of a jack-in-the-box so that my hands flew to my throat with the shock of it. He peered at me. “You see but you do not observe. While the specimen of which we speak was my superior in both height and width, his health was not one to trifle with. If you had the look at him I did you would have recognized the telltale signs of cataracts in his left eye thus my first goal was to attack the right, effectively blinding him and giving the game over to me.” Satisfied, he fell back against the bed, sending a minute puff of dandruff which I waved away absentmindedly.
“You will do no good with intimidation,” he said, muffling his voice in the adipose on Gladstone’s neck. His small eyes, like pinpricks of light in the dim, burned through me with a genuine hate.
“We can take whisky, too.”
Setting my shoulders in a more sober manner, I strutted up to the man. “And who might you be?” So said with my chin suck out at an audacious angle. I wasn’t looking for a fight but the booze coupled with my impending homelessness was doing wonders for my gall. He turned completely so he could see me with his uncovered eye and offered me his free hand, an offer I didn’t take him up on.
“If you need an official diagnosis, you’ve barely escaped being stabbed and I recommend a rigourous round of visiting a hospital after such an occurrence. I-” I gave him a look of reproach and pushed his money back at him. “I don’t need your money. Please. You’ve earned it fairly; I did not.”
Quick as a hare, I snatched Gladstone from his steak and took off through the door and round and round the tenement stairs and didn’t stop running until I was thoroughly out of breath and I could hear Holmes’s triumphant cheers gaining on me.
“I don’t need your charity. It was my own fault, my own failure to observe, as you so eloquently put it, the obvious loser in our fight. Keep your spoils for the orphans.” Doused in the few centimetres of water, the cloth returned to a shade of heavy grey while the water turned a salmon from what little blood diffused through the liquid, a colour I was sure matched the back of my neck with how it burned.
Honeycomb stepped forward. “Mr Holmes, I can’t say you’ve presented a single fair argument. You focused on all the negative on me and nothing on Mr Watson.” He was playing the role of the sympathete, a role assumed whenever he evicted someone for an arbitrary reason - falsely understanding, dripping with an irony that the person on the business end of it was often too in their cups or their emotions to notice.
“So, it appears we have a predicament. There is a dog you both profess ownership to. Now, I, for one, have little knowledge of the realm of the canine and so cannot speak to the value inherent in this hound, but he has a pleasant temper which should be enough. Yet, despite the level want for this dog, I have decided there is only one correct path we can take. Watson, please, my dear, hold your peace.
“Daddy?” A small voice came from the shadow of an open door. Honeycomb’s attention immediately left me to focus on the sopranic tones. “Why are you shouting?”
Throughout my care of him, Holmes emitted theatrical grunts of fabricated pain to my consternation. Driven to the breaking point I cried, “Would you stop that! I don’t have to be doing this, you know.”
Her glare, so gorganesque, her husband was rooted in place like a stone statue until Holmes attempted to rectify his mistake by saying, “I apologize Mrs Honeycomb. Couldn’t see you well in the dark. Goodnight, my lady,” and by taking Honeycomb by the wrist to whisk him from the scene.
“No, you didn’t my love. Everything is alright, just go back to bed.”
“Blast!” I exclaimed upon witnessing. “The bastard’s gone and thrown my things from the window!” For confirmation, I glanced up to the imposing building to see the window to my flat wide open, muslin curtains flapping in the wind, clear evidence of the defenestration.
“Bobby, darling. Please, would you shut up? It’s very late. If you want to argue with Mr Watson, would you do it out of the bedroom?” Another woman’s voice came from the lump on the bed I’d hardly noticed when I’d slipped in. Though I couldn’t see Honeycomb’s face, I was sure he was colouring.
Sherlock looks up from his phone just long enough to roll his eyes. “Over my dead body. Get me a new case, and I
“I said there’s no need.” He stood, and covered the distance to the door in swift purposeful strides. “I quit.” Sherlock did not wait for a response as he left the office.
“Well, I--”
“It's not without some sacrifice on my part, I assure you.” Sherlock had replied, arrogant even then.
“I’ve brought tea.” She stated the obvious. She placed the tray of teacups on a table by Sherlock, and sat in an armchair opposite him. “So John, tell us about yourself.”
Clarence, his landlord, lived upstairs. Generally, Sherlock would just leave an envelope of cash in his mailbox, but he knew the alpha wouldn’t take well to being given notice by mail. With a sigh, Sherlock climbed the stairs, and knocked on the door down the short hallway. It smelled of alcohol and wallpaper, but Sherlock was almost noseblind to the scent after having inhabited the flat downstairs for five months.
Her eyes lit up, and she stepped out of the way. “Up the stairs, don’t bother knocking. I’ll go make tea!” She directed him, as she hurried off.
We finish everything up with a very dramatic encounter
“Of cour--”
“Uh. The morgue.” John reiterates. He turned to Sherlock. “Why are we going to the morgue?”
“What was your counter offer?” John was looking more uncomfortable.
They were also the nosy sort that wouldn’t be put off by some rapid deductions on his part. His legs were still aching, but adrenaline blinded him to it. Fight or flight. He wouldn’t get very far trying to run.
The two startled alphas dropped their hold on the man. He was clearly injured, and why he needed to be forced into the building for his own health was beyond John.
“I still don’t think whatever random kid you met in middle school is the murderer. You’re drawing conclusions with no proof.” John had reluctantly followed Sherlock to the cafe he was bent on investigating. The place was abandoned, and everything was dusty. He had sneezed twice already, hence the grumbling.
“Is this Sherlock?”
Sherlock felt his breathing go ragged again. He knew the ladies were only trying to help, but the smell of another Alpha was too much for him. It smelled like danger.
Willing to do no such thing, Sherlock assessed the situation.
“Number three. This is the most important one.” What could possibly be more important than a death threat? John asked himself. “Never EVER use compulsion on me.”
Her voice came out strangely. Her accent still existed, but it was as if someone had underlined it heavily. There was an undertone of something else, like her voice had developed the remarkable ability of cutting through flesh.
“You know where to find me.” Sherlock reminded him, as he headed for the door. His hand paused above the handle. “Actually, I’ve been thinking of moving out of my flat.” He shook his phone in the air, reminding Lestrade to reach out, and then he exited the building.
“I hardly think what you did to the jocks can be considered a good primer for homicide.” Sherlock informed him cautiously.
“Morgue. We can talk on the way. You were saying?”
John wasted no time scouting it out.
Coffee had been the catalyst.
The police came to the same conclusion that the Alphas had. The curly-haired man had been raped. His supposed flat was completely empty.
“A series of murders. The most recent had a slit in its left cheek perfect for taking blood discreetly once the victim is dead. But why is that necessary? It wasn’t so they’d know to hide the body. The body wasn’t hidden. So why did the murderer need to draw blood before the police found the body, and why did they have to hide their intentions? I have to check if the other bodies match.”
He did, however, have the dignity not to be dragged.
“I’m afraid so, dear. You’ll be good for him.”
“We have a new seating arrangement today. Max, you will be sitting with Sandra at Helium.” Children shifted around with the directions. Sherlock zoned it out. The tables were arranged and named by elements of the periodic table. He had occupied the Oxygen table since day one, and had not had a partner since Jenny the first week.
“If that is what you want.. We'll manage somehow, I guess.” John replied and folded his hands in his lap. “I'll just work extra hours for as long as possible and-”
“You know nothing about me. You don't even know what you're talking about!”
With a grip on both the Omega's shoulders, John asked Sherlock to turn around and come chest to chest with him to not strain his neck.
Sherlock tried at a “I
“At least get some sleep then..”
Sherlock immediately flung himself over John again as soon as he was within reach and held him even closer, tighter. If he were strong enough right now, he might as well have hurt John. It limited his mobility and taking off the cuffs took longer this way, but that didn't matter now.
John hadn't noticed yet, though. He'd been stressed and distracted most of the time and it was a very minor change after all. However, Sherlock Holmes wouldn't be who he was, if he couldn't make use of it. He lay down with his back to the door and started to prepare himself until John walked in moments later.
Mycroft leaned forward against his black umbrella, his expression patronizing. “I think you will find your mate will agree that being an Alpha is not quite as.. 'relaxing' as you seem to think.”
“You won't touch me at all. You aren't even reacting to any sort of approach I try on you. You keep telling me that you love me, so, naturally, I have to assume that my physique is putting you off.” Sherlock explained, rather angrily.
Thank you to whoever is still reading this. I'm sorry this last chapter took so long. I was off the grid for two weeks, and couldn't finish edits before I left. This one in particular needed a lot of clearing up.
John was beginning to second guess the wisdom of soul mates.
“You’re early.” He stated questioningly.
To compound upon the problem, Miss Scott did not remove him from the table the entire year. It was a bit like she was matchmaking. They weren’t a couple, in fact they didn’t talk to each other once until two months in.
“Yes rules. You agree to my terms, and we can attempt to get to know each other. You don’t adhere to my terms, and you get ghosted. Do you follow?”
“No, and it's not the sister either.”  Lestrade let him go out the door first, and then followed.
He always kept a gun on him, and he took it out now. Desperate times called for desperate means. He pointed it at the couple.
Hanging up his coat at five o’clock, his phone began to ring. He picked up. “Hello. This is John Watson.”
The moment was broken, when Moriarty began slow clapping. Sherlock blinked, then turned to him, whipping out a gun, John hadn’t known he had. A growl rippled from his mouth, as he leveled the gun at his old friend.
“Here’s the month’s rent. I’m moving out.” Sherlock held out an envelope. Clarence didn’t take it. Sherlock shook the paper a bit, wondering if his landlord was as daft as he seemed.
A kind, grey-haired Alpha came to the door. She smiled at him patronizingly.
“I’ll have a large coffee. Black, two sugars.” Sherlock answered as John spluttered at the use of the word ‘husband.’
“Put your hands up, and walk back the way you came.” His voice came out higher than he would have liked, but it was authoritative. Their hands flew to their heads. Neither backed away.
Hoping to grab the stuff he needed and get out, he stopped dead in his tracks when he got into the lab. The blood samples Molly had promised him weren’t there. Sherlock narrowed his eyes at the room in confusion. Catching himself, he turned the expression into a glare, and left.
“It's absolute BS. I met your brother.” John said as if that was an explanation.
He took a step closer. He nodded, knowing he couldn’t really say anything meaningful before this started. Reaching up, he placed both hands on the back of Sherlock’s neck, covering his name.
And then? Hot. Everything was hot. John’s hands were burning off, and tendrils of the fire were hurtling down his arms, searing the flesh off his bones.
Sherlock’s eyebrows climbed with each sentence until he finished with narrowed eyes.  “That's a rather long way to jump.” His voice was a sheet of ice.
Sherlock being Sherlock
“Right. Well I enjoy going out with friends on friday nights and, I don’t know, a good cup of tea.” Apparently seeing the futility of such stilted conversation, John switched tactics. “Why did you quit your job so many times?”
“John must truly be working wonders if you haven’t hacked their database yet.”
John looked at her in surprise. “It's been a week!”
“Scotland yard doesn’t consult amateurs.”
Molly materialized from a door on the left. “I do have a job y’know, Sherlock.” She pointed out.
Sherlock took the device, and started typing far faster than John could ever hope to manage. Eyes on the screen, he asked “Afghanistan or Iraq?”
Sherlock stood, and grabbed the coat on the back of his chair. “Perhaps not, but I am.”
He didn’t get five steps before a wave of nausea overtook him, and he saw nothing.
Moriarty looked confused for a moment, before breaking into a grin. “Oh, no, no. You’re not dying by sniper. Sherlock is going to kill you. And you’re going to make sure he does it.”
Then, with surprising swiftness, he grabbed Sherlock’s wrist, and pinned it to the wall above him. Sherlock dropped the cash, and used his free hand to swing a punch at Clarence’s face.
In three hours, Sherlock was all packed. He’d had to abandon two experiments that required refrigeration. That was unfortunate. However, beyond his chemistry set and other devices, Sherlock had surprisingly few worldly possessions.
“He’s an Alpha doctor named John. He’s a veteran and has recently gotten in a fight with his brother. Maybe because he’s an alcoholic, but probably because he recently had a fight with his girlfriend. It is extremely likely that he is my mate. And most importantly, he was just leaving.”
“Of course, I have every intention of adding one, but it doesn’t have to be both of you.”
Sherlock awoke in the back of a cab.
“How did you know that stuff about me?”
One used his arm to help him to a standing position.
John slid in, and Sherlock followed.
“Sherlock you’re not likely to get your job back by messing with investigations.” John warned him.
Mrs.Hudson stood as well. “Sherlock!” she exclaimed.
“I accept.” Suddenly, he realized something. “Wait, how did you get my number in the first place?”
“Put the gun down,” said the eldest calmly.
“What are the results, doctor?”
“...and then I didn’t die. I’m actually lost for this part of the story. Sherlock, care to explain?”
“Afghanistan. How did you... “ he trailed off as the landlady entered with a tray.
A knock came at the door. Sherlock strode back into the living room.
consider making you tea.”
“What?”
“The universe wants you to get to know your soulmate.” Mycroft hung up. Sherlock chucked the offending device across the room. It bounced off the couch and onto the floor.
Sherlock had given the ladies this power. He had leveled the gun at their heads, thus making it a situation compatible to such an order. That didn’t mean he had to like it.
John closed his eyes, and took a deep breath. This was what the bond was for. Protecting his mate. “Sherlock.” he said quietly. “Pick up the gun.
“You’re hurt. You need to get to a hospital.”
“WHAT?” John repeated.
Spinning to face the door, he plastered on a smile. “How can I help you?”
A man stepped forward. He was encased in the shadows at the back of the establishment, and Sherlock’s flashlight couldn’t reach him. “Moriarty at your service. Although Sherlock would know me as Jim.” John could hear the smirk in his voice. “Yes, I’m the murderer. I’m sure you saw it coming, Sherl. It's been in the works for a very long time.”
When he was satisfied with their retreat, Sherlock holstered his gun, and turned to leave.
“Me.” Sherlock spoke as if resigned from his seat. John looked between the two ex-friends.
“I’m sorry?” John replied.
“Not again, Sherlock. You know we need you.”
Confoundingly, Molly wasn’t in the morgue either.  Sherlock paused for a second, then cupped his hands to his mouth and shouted “Molly!”
“Three-hundred types of tobacco ash, hmm?” John looked amused, but Sherlock caught the awe behind it.
However, instead of using his newfound freedom to register himself at the desk, he flipped up his collar, nodded at John, and marched out, acting for all the world as if he owned the place.
Bored. Bored, bored, bore--
“The problem is the world, not you Sherlock.” He said softly. “There’s nothing wrong with you.”
“Deducing you,” came the reply. John said nothing more. He simply continued his strange observance, wrinkles intermittently creasing his brow.
He removed his scarf and coat methodically. This unbundling left his neck bare. On the back of it, John knew, was written his own name.
“I’m on a case John. Three murders. It's like Christmas. Come by tomorrow at three. We can talk then, and maybe I’ll have found the--” Sherlock hung up again, as he delved into talking to himself.
The space was remarkably lived-in for having been inhabited for just a week. It was far more spacious than the last space the man had had, and it seemed comfy. Although, there was a skull on the mantle.
The energy was going so fast, it seemed to solidify. Then, it settled. Dissipated. John felt their mingled energies sink into a latent stillness, and a cool wave washed over him.
“What are you doing?”
“Oh no. Are you alright dear?” “What happened?” the two of them exclaimed.
“On me.” John grunted his assent. “What did he tell you?”
The woman looked at him with confusion. “Who are you?”
“Yeah. O. Why?”
“I really am sorry to have to kill you. You were very entertaining.”
“I quit again.” Sherlock informed him, as he scooped up the coat on his chair. Lestrade groaned.
“O. Oxygen’s abbreviation on the periodic table of the elements. My table. Jim. Cafe with a bad pun. Gotta go Lestrade. I wish you good solving.”
“You have family issues, many of them concerning your gender.” John frowned. “He wouldn’t give details. Talked about your intelligence. You hate the world. But you never take it out on the people around you. Never go all criminal mastermind. You take it out on yourself. You’ve knocked yourself up on drugs pretty bad a couple times.”
“Rule number one. You will treat me as an equal.”
“I told you it wasn’t likely to be. Her ears were newly pierced.” Their voices became more faint as they went down the stairs.
“You heard me order, John.”
“Get your hands off me,” he said, yanking his arm from the woman’s grasp and trying to back away.
“I’m impressed. He’s not one to do that, you know.” Sherlock downed a third of his coffee. It was true he didn’t care for the taste, but he cared even less for those creams. Easy to poison.
It was strange how at home John looked in Sherlock’s apartment. Sherlock had his eyes trained on his mate. The man was sitting on a chair not far from him, reading a magazine. It didn’t make sense for him to be so casual.
“Yes we had a… talk.”
His landlord had been apprehended, and was being interrogated about the Omega’s identity.
“You two are going to take the bond.” Moriarty, walks casually forward, and as his face comes into the light, John does a double take. He looks like your average British man. And yet, something's off about him. Maybe it's the way his eyes are opened a bit too wide, or the way they glint with a manic light. This was not the face of a sane man.
Leaving his three bags of belongings on the floor, Sherlock went to turn in his rent.
Sherlock had laughed “What, have you researched what it would take to open a cafe? You? Own a cafe? Next you’re going to tell me you're going to use puns to name it.”
It was a normal looking building. It was in a neighborhood of Alphas, but then, his last place had been too.
John didn’t question how the man knew his name. “Get your bloody hands off him,” he growled.
Sherlock’s gaze was fixed on the darkness where Moriarty stood, and both his hands were clutching his blue scarf. John narrowed his eyes.
“Good gracious Sherlock was that really necessary?” asked John, rubbing his ears.
Pain shot up and down his limbs. If Sherlock had not had a history with drugs, he would have been far more unsteady getting up. As it was, his legs protested at the top of their lungs. Fumbling with his pants, Sherlock stumbled down the hall and out onto the streets where he collapsed, breathing heavily.
He was sorting files in a cabinet on the far wall when the door opened. He was slightly embarrassed that his back was turned, and the newcomers could see the Mate Mark on the back of his neck. But he had been the one who hadn’t worn a turtleneck that day, so it was his own fault.
“Anderson has reported that you were acting less than friendly towards him today.” He gave Sherlock a long look. “I told you to try and get along with him.”
Assuming they were taking him to the hospital- and in truth there was no proof- Sherlock’s best bet was to wait until they arrived.
John’s eyes flicked to his mate. Sherlock’s eyes were squeezed shut, his scarf’s knot coming undone as he tugged at it in stress.
“Boys, settle down.” Miss Scott had interrupted with a twitch of her lips. They’d been friends all that year. Sherlock hadn’t kept track of Jim when they left for different high schools.
“That's why you are wearing those shoes. I knew that was strange. Usually you’d go home and change. Cab!” A cab pulled up to the curb almost immediately.
John noticed his heart rate increasing. Moriarty continued, “That’s why I’ve planned a bit more entertainment before I leave. I think it is a much better option than dying. Although I’m not sure if Sherlock would agree.”
“Where to?” Asked the driver.
John was detained long after he should have gone home for the day, but he was eventually let go. The hospital ‘failing to treat a patient’ was seen as not his fault, and the issue was dropped.
“Sherlock,” John said as calmly as he could “compulsions are not something that we have control over. They just happen.” He took his key out of his pocket, and shut his office door.
“He’s always like that?”
He was an Alpha, so that was not possible. Still, it was strange.
Sherlock’s face was a lesson in rage. There was no room for shock, or obstinance. He was absolutely livid. It wasn’t quiet, calculated anger. It was a bulldozer of hatred taking down the whole world with his steel eyes. “NO.” he said.
“No John, three. I’m still unemployed.”
Both men were now distinctly uncomfortable with the conversation. Sherlock was stock still, and his eyes were boring into John. He was squirming under the gaze. Still he powered on.
John called Sherlock back.
John rolled his eyes. He might not get the traditional Alpha/Omega relationship, but this would certainly be an adventure.
“Tell John it was not part of our deal that you be informed of the meeting.”
“Ummm.” He sighed. “Information.”
John paused to take this all in. “Why are you even investigating this? You quit your job.”
This was a common speech. ‘Act like a complacent Omega, or I’ll fire you.’ Sherlock was sick of it. Anderson had had it coming. Sherlock was routinely dumped on useless cases, far below his abilities, and his coworker loved reminding him of this fact.
hope you enjoy:)
The Omega picked up immediately.
“Jim, you will join Sherlock at the Oxygen table.”
“No, but we are not treating it as a missing persons case. He has just moved out. If you have no further questions? Alright. Thank you for your time.”
It was horrible to watch Sherlock lose control. Through the bond, John felt Sherlock seize up. It felt markedly
John’s smile widened. He turned to the officer. Hilariously, the man looked gobsmacked. Lestrade ignored him, and took out his own phone.
“Have you solved your case yet?” It was a clear ploy to change the subject, but Sherlock let it slide.
Compulsions, put simply, were orders from an Alpha that an Omega was physically incapable of resisting. They were generally associated with bonded mates, because any and every order from the Alpha of a bonded pair was a compulsion. However, in scenarios in which someone’s life is in jeopardy, Alphas could use compulsions on Omegas regardless of mating. Scientists believed this was developed as a survival mechanism to protect the Omegas. This could, obviously, be a load of dung. Fields of study were dominated by Alphas, as Omegas were seen as unfit for such jobs. It was just another way Omegas had less power.
“Well, your coat is the most obvious sign.”
“I get to bring my dog.”
“I don’t think I will.” He stepped towards me, a living shadow in the pitch of the bedroom. Gladstone whimpered next to my ankle. I crouched to comfort him. With his dog’s eyes, he could see much better in the darkness than either of us humans, and what he saw he clearly didn’t like. His warm body trembled against my leg.
He was still carrying around the bloody steak. I had offered to create a makeshift eyepatch for him out of bandages but he waved me away, saying it would be a gift for my dog meanwhile icing his bruised eye with the meat.
The nightgowned form shuffled sleepily into the light. One little fist rubbing an eye, the girl was rather short, no more than five years old at my modest estimation, and had flaxen, sleep-rumpled hair crowding the spaces in front of her eyes.
“But it isn’t Christmas,” she protested.
“Finally your presence here is the deciding factor. It rather much like an ouroboros when you think of it. Your lack of funds drew you here in desperation for money but it also blinded you from selecting the choicest contender. The shallow strength of our fallen friend seemed like an easy method for earning enough money to, if not pay your rent entirely, find pleasant lodgings for tonight.”
“He’s my dog.”
“That I needed rent money. I never mentioned a thing.”
“I heard shouting.”
“Pardon me?” A manic grin appeared on my face. Babbling incoherent threats, Honeycomb, with his obscenely long legs, pushed back in his chair like he was pedaling a penny-farthing at high speeds until he hit the far wall with a smack. I hadn’t moved an inch.
“If you won’t let me pay you for your services let me at least give you a place to stay until you find your way back into your our privacy. You would have had half of this had you been straight enough for analysis.” So earnest and imploring was his expression, I could hardly say no (no matter how much I shouldn’t have; staying with a ruffian was hardly the ideal place to be guest).
“Now, having an extra key on hand is certainly no crime, but it is strange why it would remain without for anyone to take while young children sleep within. The key must then belong to someone who is confident they could fend off an intruder and used by someone allowed entrance at hours of the day where knocking is an unavailable option. Not to mention the height of the door. Mr Honeycomb, I’m sure you have suffered no shortage of diminutives based around your stature, but it is true that no one but yourself, or someone who owns quite a lot of pairs of tall shoes, could reach the height required to reach said key.
Continued glaring.
“Don’t bother. I can’t deal with a row. Not tonight. Look, I’ll pay him next month if he hasn’t shopped out my room by then.” Silently pleading with a grave look in my eyes, I dropped his arm and he stepped back. With a resigned sign, most of the anger gone out of me, I went back to gathering up my wardrobe. Holmes joined me on the ground.
“Damn you Fosberry,” mumbled Holmes into his cup. Sighing, “I suppose you won’t leave me to my peace until you have conducted an examination.”
“May I see the letter?” Nebulous to the order, I passed it to him anyway, hoping it would give me the opportunity to break from him. A false hope, he was much stronger than he looked. I could feel the curves of his muscles dig into my ribcage in not a wholly uncomfortable sensation. He finished reading with a satisfied hum of intrigue and put the letter in my pocket so it rested securely against my thigh.
“My mistake Mr Honeycomb. Watson, do you have to say anything in your defense?”
I would have answered, but honestly, there was something in the child that unsettled me. Perhaps it was her disheveled appearance or her probing gaze that seemed to look through me and pierce the very heart of me at the same time or the way she sprung from the darkness like a ghost.
She nodded and again he swooped her up to deposit her in the room. I heard the theatrical smack of a kiss as I snuck over to the other door - Gladstone’s prison - and turned the knob. Silent as a burglar, though with much effort, I pushed open the door a crack. As I peered in I saw Gladstone lying against the door, his head on his paws, pouting.
“No, sweetie. Would you go back to bed if I gave you another kiss?” They looked a strange pair together, an oak tree and the baby chipmunk pawing at a knot in the trunk.
“I’m sorry, ma’am,” I said. My hand was curled around Gladstone’s collar, ready to drag him to freedom as soon as I was able.
I recoiled. “What are you doing?” I didn’t want him to irritate his wound and he was bent over folding a shirt of mine.
“When Watson led me upstairs, I remained outside of your flat while he entered. While on my own I felt on top of the door jamb and found a key which, upon experimentation, I found fit into your lock. Again, dust is a key assistant, for the amount of dust on your door jamb is next to nil, so unless you, Mr Honeycomb, are an avid housekeeper, or your wife is, which, judging by the state of your flat, isn’t something either of you two are used to, the explanation for the absence of dust is if someone is fumbling along the top of your door jamb for the key.
“Yes. It’s quite out of fashion, wouldn’t you say? Its current length is obviously not its original cut and, while well tailored to your size, was not made for your ruling girth. There are patches of varying colouring throughout the inner lining so unless you are very careless, they can only mean a long time of wear and repair. And though it is a splendid piece of costuming it is not recently made. In addition to the quality of the coat, there is an embroidered name on the back of the collar: Yisrael. Thus, I can only surmise you have bought the coat secondhand from a Jewish gentleman.
“Ghastly,” he said, though prostrate as a penitent, “I can’t even lay my arm where I choose. Have I, being abducted by the wrong sort of doctor, been taken for a lunatic for the asylum?”
John worked overtime the next day, trying to focus on something mundane to keep his head from exploding.
“You’re right. The problem isn’t me. It's my colleagues who won’t give me access to the dead bodies I need.”
John frowned. He wasn’t prejudiced. Alphas and Omegas were suited to different things, but that didn’t mean that he saw Omegas as less-than.
“Lestrade. What was the blood type of all the victims? Were they all the same?”
Sherlock’s foot assaulted the floor in a rhythmic, belligerent fashion. It was 2:58, and he needed to get to the morgue to reexamine the bodies, but he had told John to meet him at his flat at three.
Pretty much just them meeting again...
“John, I-- stop it.” Sherlock bit out.
He finally understood how couples could die if the bond wasn’t completed. He was draining Sherlock’s lifeforce, and it was too much for his body to handle alone. He was being roasted like a slightly gooey marshmallow.
“I was asking the Alpha.” The driver said dismissively.
“No. You’d think they’d just get over their pride and let me on the scene.”
He opened his mouth to complain again, but was interrupted.
“Can’t. The authorities are in there. It's why I wasn't here.”
“May I help you?”
It was John. He was early. It was strange enough to catch Sherlock’s attention. His mind latched onto that fact. As if he had just been released from prison, Sherlock grabbed his coat and headed out the door.
“About needing a case. I just might have something good for you…”
” he hastily added on. Tension accumulated on Sherlock’s brow, but he responded to the command.
Yet Sherlock could find nothing- no twitches, or out of place breaths- to suggest he was anything but perfectly at home. Unbidden, the coffee conversation welled up in his mind. Before the topic had shifted to Mycroft, John had seemed perfectly at ease. He hadn’t so much as blinked while giving the  sugar speech.
Sherlock was texting Lestrade their location as John went over to the stirring Alpha and held both her hands against her back to prevent her from standing up. Within a few minutes, in which Sherlock wanted nothing more than, at the very least, a cigarette, the Alpha was taken away and no one but her, Sherlock and John knew what had happened just then.
John shook his head in dismiss, he wanted to get up again, but felt he wouldn't make it to the door. “I'm telling you, Greg, something happened to Sherlock.” he insisted, feeling his breathing speed up, knowing what followed would be a panic attack. “I can feel it. Something's wrong.” he panted, voice giving in slightly.
“Tomorrow?” Sherlock asked hopefully. “I'm tired.”
John surely wanted this pup and, technically so did Sherlock. But it meant a great change to both of their lives.
“Neither of us has been in heat for decades!”
Sherlock rapidly fixed an anxious look on the other man. “Don't.... Don't-...
The Alpha looked back at him blank-faced. “How.. do you know that?”
“Okay, let's say I'll call you in an hour. If you don't know any more by then, I'll send a cab to pick you up. Deal?” Not that Sherlock wouldn't want to be alone with them for more than two hours, but he also didn't want John to be stranded forever.
John frowned a scowl at his partner. “Air? What air?”
“Either the parents made a comment about how the police couldn't help, or our client is scared to ask help from that kind of force.” John snorted. “What?”
Sherlock studied both of their faces for a moment. “We'll see.” he then simply stated, brushing the topic off. He didn't like hospitals. Much less did he like having to lay in one, unable to do anything and besides, how hard could it be? A bit of cramping, a bit of pushing, out comes a baby. He could do that. Shouldn't be worse than heat.
“Listen, mate, we don't need your cooing; we don't need your arrogance, we have been doing very well on our own these last 15 months. If we needed or wanted an Alpha, we'd both have gotten one before we started a relationship and most definitely before we got pregnant, get that?! Good, now get your sorry arse away from here before I break your arms and your stupid alpha ego!” with that, John let go of his arm. The Alpha bumped into his belly on his first attempt of fleeing the aggressive Omega, rounding it on his second and cursing back at him, calling him a 'filthy Omega slut' among other things, to which John reacted by almost going after him, though Sherlock held him back by the shoulder.
John and Sherlock went straight home from there. In the cab, the Omega turned to his companion, feeling able to breathe properly for the first time since Lisa had announced her arrival this morning. “Thank you.” Sherlock turned an inquiring eye on him. “For listening earlier and not just brushing it off. I had nothing to really base my accusations on, so you could just as well have told me to sod off.”
“Everything alright, Mr. Holmes?”
This chapter almost wrote itself, I'm a little stunned. I started two nights ago and here it just is..
He was half-carrying Sherlock again by the time they arrived at Angelo's, but once there, the detective straightened back up – he had a reputation here, no need for emotional displays. Oddly enough, John was absolutely fine with that. He had expected it and it would have had him worried had it been any other way. He found himself smiling brightly as he held the door open for his pregnant mate.
“And that's me.”
The Omega turned around from where he was stacking some paper on the desk. “Oh, er, I... Are you naked?” he asked, looking mildly disturbed.
John gave one of his 'you're an idiot' smiles and while they should be offensive to him, they really were nothing but adorable on John. “You know, it won't hurt you to make yourself a sandwich once in a while...”
Sherlock stayed silent throughout breakfast and John didn't try to bring him to eat more than a single slice of bread, jam anything but generously spread on it.
“Thank you, for, uh..”
“Yes, John. Is that an issue?”
“John?” Sherlock's hand on his shoulder and his voice startled him. He hadn't heard the Omega approach him.
Anyone hoping for some dark!Sherlock or non-con/rape between the two, will be disappointed. That was never my plan and will not happen in this fic! I'm sorry to have potentially mislead you in that way.
From the living room came the voices of children babbling to each other while, one after another, they were exchanged. Usually, John would do multiple at once, but, Sherlock had to admit, there was only so much room on the wood surface at the moment and John, as ever, didn't want to bother him too much. He wanted to snap at the silly man for thinking so little of himself. For a clever man, John could be very stupid.
When an Alpha, a bit taller than John, rounded the corner and, on sight, stopped to start flirting with the shorter Omega, Sherlock was instantly alerted. “What does a pretty, little, pregnant, unbonded Omega like you do all on your own out on the streets?”
The Alpha looked at him in awe and somehow John's hand on his abdomen made something click inside his head – they were alive. He and the pups. Alive and in John's loving hands. The pups were alive and growing. They were growing again.
“Let me finish. I know this must be way off anything you expected for your life, especially with it coming so very late-”
“Four to eight times.”
John draped his arms around Sherlock as the call was finally answered. “Hello? Yes, we need an ambulance. 221B Baker Street. My mate is possibly having a miscarriage. Yes, thank you.”
Also, can we please appreciate the fact that, if things had gone John's way, the canon baby would actually have been called Katherine? You know, like Kat in this story? Am I awesome???
“Your bond is still very young and strong.. But I s'pose that never seizes in a soul mates' bond anyway...” the DI mused. Taking a good look at John's figure again and drawing conclusions from the cold coffee, the reddened eyes, darker rings under the eyes and overall slumped and lifeless posture, he asked “have you slept at all?”
Lestrade consults with Sherlock and John about a case that reminds them of what lives they are actually living.
“ ' Nursery.. I want it yellow. With some asymmetrically placed lime green, vertical stripes; two per wall, leaving one completely yellow. Lemon. It ages rather nicely.” Sherlock continued to mumble, waving a hand as if indicating the positions in the intended room whilst sitting himself up.
“You're seeing your therapist again.”
“You tell me.” the Alpha answered very seriously, giving John the time to answer. John took it and turned, beginning his walk back to the black car.
John leaned forward, standing up and approaching him over the one foot distance. “Sherlock, are you al-... Jeeeesus!” he breathed, swaying in his step even though it was the only one he needed to take. His scent was released, then.
“I'll leave you to it for some minutes.” the brunette excused herself, exiting the room.
Any questions: same means of contacting me :)
John and Sherlock exchanged a look and approached them further. Lisa was in tears as she spoke. “Thank you so much! I didn't expect you to find him so quickly.”
“No. Nonononono.” John protested, battling his hands away and climbing out of the bed, denying he had to steady himself on the nurse for a moment. “Sherlock. I need to get Sherlock. I need to get him out of there.” he mumbled on, brain dizzy, still caught up in the haze of final rest after having gone too long without it.
“Very well. Please make sure to inform reception and urgently see your omega physician.” she insisted. “Have a nice day!”
He didn't know why it bothered him so much that they would be having a disabled child. He didn't think there was anything wrong with disabled people, why would there be? It just somehow made him feel weak, powerless. Like he'd failed as this pack's Alpha.
“I'll have to move.” John answered, voice tinged with with a little dare. It worked, as Sherlock gruffed out his protest and pulled John's body closer, hugging him tighter. Again, John made his amusement known, but flung his left arm around the taller man as well, using his right hand to idly card it through his offending fluffy curls – it seemed like they never got greasy, while John's short hair tended to look terrible 'the morning after'. Well, honestly, he did most of the work actually, so, never mind that.
“Well, for me she moves a bit too fast. For her, I move too slowly.” he sighed, knowing he'd have to be more specific, but not wanting to go into more detail. “She wants to meet them. They don't want to meet anybody.”
are you!”
“Alright. Now, if you would follow me, please, I will have a look at you now to determine what has happened and if your pup is ok, yes?” she asked calmly and they all got up and moved to the examination room.
“She is an athlete, she has the strength. I'm surprised you didn't notice the fact that she wore no lipstick, despite the rather large collection of colours and brands.”
True to his word, John applied to various surgeries and hospitals all over London, sending them his letters via email just as he started consulting a doctor himself to start his journey for suppressants. Getting on the list when he was a young boy had been much easier; an OP in his mid-thirties put on suppressants after a two-year break in which he'd had multiple pregnancies and only five still with him – it wasn't really a safe case for prescriptions. He was, no doubt, expected to relapse at any moment, like the slut he was. Back with his old doctor, he'd had to agree to undergo examinations every week for the next month to keep track of his development. He just hoped they'd get there before his heat returned, which could be anywhere between one month to two months after his last pregnancy.
“Proof shmoof. Doesn’t matter so long as he’s right.” said a new voice. It was neither John’s nor Sherlock’s. John stubbed his toe on a chair in surprise. He cussed, then hopped around to face the voice.
“John. You can’t get shot. You’re needed by a lot of patients”
Moriarty cackled. “How sweet. But it doesn’t matter Sherl. John gets to choose.” John tensed his jaw. He recognized what this man was doing. He was taking every bit of control from Sherlock that he could. John would have thwarted this in any way he could, if it didn’t mean Sherlock’s death.
Then, it stilled into a mask, and he began pulling at the arms restraining him.
Sherlock frantically pulled up a map on his laptop. “John. I think I have a lead.”
“Not quite three-hundred.”
The Clarence that came to the door, was wearing ratty sweatpants, and nothing on his upper half. Sherlock was quite a bit taller, but Clarence bridged that gap with imposing body language.
“For the caffeine then? Tea is much better, although coffee is a better business.”
“Four?” John raised an eyebrow.
At first nothing happened.
“Mhmm. He said the truth might spark a reaction from you.” Sherlock huffed. Before he could reply, John spoke again. “I am not going to be a messenger. Any conversation you want to have with him can occur without my services as a middle man.”
Hesitantly, John removed his hands. They had formed a death grip on Sherlock’s neck, and sometime in the process, their foreheads had met. Finally able to process the grey eyes boring into his own, John took a deep breath.
John smiled. “Hey Sherlock. Blow me a kiss.” he said cheekily.
“You summoned?” Sherlock deadpanned. It was the third time that week he’d been called to his bosses office, although it wasn’t entirely his fault.
“Yeah, of co--Agreed.”
His boss had the large office at the end of the hall, so Sherlock popped into his joint workspace before clearing out.
An officer came out of a nearby room and hailed him. John walked over.
The rest of the ride was wethered in silence. It was not much longer until they arrived. Sherlock left the bill for John to pay, and raced into the building.
“I don’t understand,” a bearded officer said. “You’re an Omega. Was the order to kill him not a compulsion?”
“Sir?”
“How dull.” Sherlock replied.
“That makes one of us” Sherlock responded, undeterred.
In truth, Sherlock had been meaning to move out for some time. His neighborhood consisted of Alphas. None of them approved of his presence as an Omega.
“I have rules.” John thought he recognized the voice.
“Ah, my dear brother.’ Sherlock’s voice switched to one of a weary traveler.
John personally scoffed at the idea. An Omega part of Scotland Yard? It sounded pretty outlandish. The story also went that the man had resisted a compulsion, so clearly it was all muddled up.
Moriarty laughed. “Sherlock. Tsk tsk. You think I don’t remember what you’re like? You didn’t call the police. You came with your little mate, and thought it would work out. Well I’m veeery sorry to disappoint you, but I’m afraid this time you’ve been beat.” Laser sights appeared on Sherlock’s chest. Looking down, John saw the same lights on his own shirt.
The Omega fled to the stairwell. Clarence caught up only enough to grab Sherlock’s arm. It threw him off kilter, and he tumbled down the stairs.
Just then, another man entered the flat. “Lestrade. Right on time. It's not the postman.” Lestrade didn’t blink at Sherlock walking briskly past him to the door.
Both men were silent as John paid, and they waited for their orders. They arrived quickly, because both men had ordered simple drinks.
“Yeah. I-- where are you going?”
“Serial killings. Playing the violin. Anything with sufficient mental stimulation.” Sherlock met Jon’s gaze head on, and waited for a reaction. The man blinked.
“I don’t trust you. How do we know you’ll spare us?”
“Don’t give me that. You don’t see Alphas and Omegas as equals. You will repress these prejudices when with me.”
He met John who was just getting to the top of the stairs. Sherlock inclined his head a bit at the man, but was moving much too fast for any sort of exchange. Sherlock swept down the hall, assuming John would follow. He did, although with louder footsteps than were necessary.
After some digging, John unearthed a blog by one Sherlock Holmes. The claims he made seemed far fetched, but it listed Sherlock's new place of residence: 221B Baker Street.
“We have.”
It was a compulsion.
John worried his bottom lip, and slipped a hand to the back of his neck. “I umm. Well, I might be his soulmate. But don’t tell him I said that. He doesn’t seem very open to the idea.”
“Asked you to keep an eye on me. Probably for money.” It wasn’t a question.
The officer shook his head. “And why should I believe you?”
“They’re probably looking for the wrong thing, idiots.” He was already walking to the door on the left.
It collided, making Clarence swear.
It was the new kid’s first day. Not that Sherlock had really noticed. He had taken the ten seconds it took to deduce him, and had then turned back to his book.
Lestrade sighed. “He can resist them. Has been able to for years, although he prefers to keep it quiet.”
“Right.” John muttered, turning to look out the window. Sherlock smiled a bit. “I still don’t know why we couldn’t just go out for coffee.” John grumbled, as they passed a cafe.
“Sorry dear. No visitors, he's still moving in.”
“You don’t. But you currently have snipers aimed at your heart. You are not in a position to negotiate.”
He’d asked Miss Scott, in private, why she separated him like that.
“Ah, Mrs. Hudson.” Sherlock greeted her.
He was mildly surprised when they did indeed pull into an Omega hospital drop off. He was far less surprised when the Alphas thought it necessary to ‘escort’ him into the building.
“I still won't sleep. I can't.”
Over dinner, they hardly said a word about it, but Sherlock kept hinting back to it.
“Your deodorant told me that.” he said arrogantly and John, knowing the burn that was about to befall this poor sod, readied himself to be able to follow Sherlock's train of thought.
He answered with a weak wobble of his lips. It wasn't convincing, but she seemed happy enough, wiggling in her chair and giggling a little.
Sherlock clapped his hands together and got up. “Let's go talk to her parents, then!”
Fortunately, he wasn't showing any signs of heat by his fourth appointment yet, they reckoned it was because the pups had come so early and his body hadn't caught up all the way yet. He got the prescription. On his way back to the flat, John dropped in by a pharmacy and got his pills.
that marked John's anger. Instead, he slumped forward into Sherlock's arms, who reflexively embraced him and held him in a hug-like position. Looking down at the head against his chest, he saw the miserable creature that was John Watson. His John. The ever-fighting strong individual; the soldier. He'd never seen him give up on a fight; never seen him broken. Even when he had returned from war, PTSD, tremor and limb on him, he had still held himself strong and proud. Now, here he was: newly bonded, madly in love, expectant father and an emotional wreck.
Please don't ask or pressure me about other stories. If inspiration doesn't come to me, I won't force myself to write. I do this for free for your enjoyment, I have a real life and real problems and you're not helping me want to work on my stuff with that kind of behaviour. Thank you.
“I say that. Now, calm down, it will be fine. Disabilities are neither an automatic reason for bullying and unhappiness, nor are they necessarily life-threatening. Autism, she speculated. Autism isn't a bad thing.”
“Look down, John, does it look like I'm finished?” Sherlock was serious; his eyebrow was pulled up, the corners of his mouth pointing down – his serious-face, definitely. He expected John to actually look down.
“I'm sorry Greg. I just wanted to help that little boy.” Thinking of himself and imagining his pups, John couldn't hold back any more and shielded his eyes with his hands, elbows resting on his thighs. Sherlock had been hovering by his side and now laid a hand on his shoulder. Light at first, as always asking for permission, then with a certainty, squeezing it briefly. John used the backs of his hands to wipe away the dampness on his cheeks, sniffling once. “I'm sorry, I never meant to get you in trouble.”
“Nah, thanks, I've just had some before I finished my shift.”
. None of them in danger.

“You know love,” John began as one of his hands carded through the dark curls, massaging the scalp, “it's not so much that I resent the idea of having you take me or even, though I don't particularly fancy it as far as I know, carry your child, should that even be compatible between us. No, it's you trying to decide my life all by yourself-”
“Sherlock, did you listen to Dr. Field? It will be almost impossible for you to have them naturally.”
“Great, then go get us some.” said the younger man, eyes focusing back on the telly – one of their few entertainers these days as neither could bear to go out with the other for more than two hours any more.
He nodded, less to agree with something and more for a lack of any other possible reaction. “What's your name then?”
John stumbled over that. He'd always been expected to do housework and leaving a mess like the living room would usually have gotten him some punishment, and not of the sexy sort. “Oh.. Sorry, I-”
“Bloody hell... I don't suppose you'll come along for the case, then?”
Also: This chapter is, for once, more John's POV - it felt right this way :D
When he opened his eyes again, the room was dark. And also not the living room. In fact, he dimly recognised it to be their bedroom. It was dark outside and John's steady, deep breathing a warm feeling in his chest. He rolled around to where his mate lay on his back, one arm on his belly, the other trapped beneath Sherlock's back. He regarded John for a moment, then draped himself over more than half of John's body and fell back asleep within mere minutes.
Sherlock has been captured and is struggling to stay calm
To all 269 Subscribers of this story: I would apologise for making you wait 5 months, but honestly, who would believe me? I wouldn't believe me because I'd be lying.
He leaned forward to make John lean back against the cushions, hands gliding down his Alpha's muscular front to unbutton his shirt. Doing the same for himself, Sherlock freed them both from their tops, Sherlock gladly so because his shirts were almost all painfully restraining him now, John's hands automatically coming to pull him closer by his hips, so that their upper bodies were flush together.
“You've really- mmmhh.” he lost his sentence in a hearty growl as one end slipped out of his hand and he had the final proof that there was no way even these pair could be worn any more. “Ten weeks and you've finally done it.” John praised, massaging the small bump as Sherlock grinned at him proudly. “Well, at the rate you've been growing recently, it's hardly a surprise.. And you'll keep growing at a faster rate for the next six months, ohh, I can't wait!” The admiring tone had given way to a very aroused, very predatory one. Sherlock found he didn't mind it in the least. “Maybe I should go on holiday for a couple of months, so the surprise is bigger when I come home to you all big and immobile, my pups keeping you pinned to the last cushion you managed to lower yourself onto before you grew simply too heavy to get up again.”
Focus, goddamned! Infuriating!!
“Yeah, but why? I get that you're an Omega and a father, but this was a bit extreme. How am I gonna explain this? This case will go to court and you can bet he'll press charges for that!” John didn't immediately reply and cast his eyes to the floor. “Look, if there's something serious on your mind, you should tell me before I let you question a suspect. Both for their safety and yours. Now, will tell me what got you so riled up?”
“Stop treating me like an object!”
“Yes, that. Which one won the girl in the end?”
“You look.. awful....” Sherlock said and John knew what he meant, though the pauses in his speech concerned him more as he was aware that was to suppress audible proof of his pain.
He withdrew his hand, Sherlock protested.
“Uh, Anthea.”
“For God's sake, you were panicking at the possibility to lose our children
Sherlock didn't even think of looking at the other man like he was. He turned his face into the cushions to hide the screwed up expression his broken mask had left behind.
“Wait for me to digest the load of food you've just shoved inside my mouth?” John suggested, smile spreading wide at the little nibbles.
John looked up from his noodles. Perplexed, he asked back “what?” through his mouthful.
I'm not your pet.
“Never felt so bloody alive and tired at the same time.” John chuckled, taking a large bite of his own. “Sherlock-...” he started, but never continued.
