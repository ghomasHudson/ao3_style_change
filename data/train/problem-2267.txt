“I’m sure you can find a clinic close to here. Not to mention that if you’re here, we could potentially take on more private cases and that would be a source of income for you if you can’t find something right away,” Sherlock reasoned, and John nodded.
The bags were awkward with the plate in hand, so he walked into the kitchen and placed them down on the table before he started unloading the bags. Once the groceries were all put away, he pulled his mobile out and placed an order at the local Chinese for delivery. He couldn’t be bothered to cook anything and was too hungry to just skip eating like he sometimes did. He grabbed a biscuit, ginger nut, and ate the whole thing in one bite.
John leaned over him, his lips kissing up Sherlock’s throat, and with the efficiency of a man who was intimately familiar with giving pleasure, he patiently worked Sherlock open.
“Damnit, Sherlock, are you okay?” he asked as he ran to the closest window. Sherlock had stumbled out of the kitchen by the time he had wrestled the first window open and went towards the next.
He fished out the teabag and tossed it in the bin, poured in milk, gave it a quick stir from the spoon he had pulled out from the drawer, and then took an appreciative sip. It was too hot, of course, but that didn’t stop him from enjoying the warmth that went down to his belly and then seemed to spread throughout his body. Mug in hand, and cane, he turned and made his way over to the desk with the laptop. He pulled out the chair and sat himself down, still staring at the the laptop as if he expected it to do something out of the ordinary. He sipped his tea, then finally dragged a finger across the mousepad to wake the screen.
“Oh,” she replied, the pleased and surprised tone back in her voice. “Well, then.” She smiled, then glanced at her cup. “Do you want a coffee?” she asked.
It was after, when he was in his room and getting dressed in his pyjamas, that he realized that there was absolutely no way that Sherlock hadn’t known what John was doing in the shower. And if he realized that, then he likely knew exactly what he was doing when he complimented John.
Joy walked contently ahead of him and he let her lead the way with a few detours when she caught the scent of something interesting and wanted to investigate. He was fine with following her for a while and she was happy to find different things to explore. They walked for nearly 40 minutes before John thought they should start heading back. The weather was still fine, but it was London, and he didn’t fancy having to walk back in sudden rain.
“You’re clean. I’m clean,” Sherlock replied, and John didn’t bother asking how Sherlock knew that he had recently been tested. And he trusted Sherlock when he said he was clean.
“There are rooftop hives in lots of cities now, but I imagine it would be easier in the countryside.”
When his tea was done, he took it to his office and closed the door because he didn’t feel like talking to anyone else.
When John got home the hallway smelled amazing. He figured Mrs. Hudson must have been cooking until he realized that the lovely smell got stronger as he climbed the stairs to his own flat. When he walked in the warm scent of tikka masala flooded over him in the most delightful of ways. He followed his nose to the kitchen and took in the rare sight of a clean table. It was covered with a tablecloth, though, with two plates and wine glasses set. Sherlock was in front of the stove and turned as John came in.
“Did you know about John?” he asked her and the way she bit her bottom lip told him more than her words ever could have.
Exactly the same as the last time he saw him, alive, in a lab. Not at all like he really saw him last with his head broken, blood seeping into the pavement under his body.
“Mrs. Hudson!” he called out, knocking carefully on the door to her flat, a tray laden with breakfast held precariously in his other arm.
Her mouth opened in an excited “o” at the idea of starting a new collection and she nearly vibrated in her skin at the prospect. She turned around in a circle, looking for something. “Where’s my pail?”
“The winds are about to change, Dr. Watson. A storm is coming. There have been threats to the Kingdom that can no longer be ignored. A...specialist is being recalled to the country and should be arriving soon.”
He didn’t see anyone or anything out of place. He frowned down at the stone again, at the flowers left there, and took out his phone to take a photo of the bouquet to try and figure out what they were later.
Sherlock’s lips quirked up in a small, private smile, and John knew he was recalling the same memory. He stood up, cleared his throat, and walked over to them. Rosie reached up and he carefully held her out to not get mud all over his clothes. A glance down at Sherlock confirmed that his trousers were nearly as muddy as Rosie’s now.
He walked down the familiar corridors of his Mind Palace until he stood before the wing devoted to John. He was somewhat hesitant to open the door out of fear of the chaos he would find in there, but when he pushed open the door, there weren’t drawers thrown around, papers scattered haphazardly across tables and the floor, or an elephant standing inexplicably in the middle of the room. The lack of disarray perplexed him. This area should be in pandemonium with the new intelligence he received, but it simply was not. It was exactly as he had left it the last time he was there.
The air was bitterly cold as John made his way to the Tesco after his shift at the clinic. If he hadn’t promised Mrs. Hudson he would pick up a few things for her that morning, he wouldn’t have bothered, but he had so now he felt obligated to not put it off just because he was tired and it was cold out.
“Move, please,” Sherlock urged, and John gave a careful roll of his hips which left them both groaning.
So why had John said no to the flatshare? He thought they had gotten on rather well, which was surprising in and of itself. They shared similar dark humour that was refreshing to find in another person. Yes, there was the moment of “a bit not good”, but surely that alone wasn’t enough to completely turn him off from sharing the flat.
John looked down at his daughter’s bright and pleading eyes, then glanced at Sherlock with his completely see-through innocent expression, and sighed.
“Jesus, Sherlock! Get the fuck out of here!” John had shouted at him, but he didn’t seem to care. Of course, he didn’t.
Sherlock sighed at the intrusion, his skin erupting in goosepimples, and John carefully slid his fingers out and then back in once more. He watched in fascination as Sherlock’s spent cock twitched in interest. Oh, he wanted Sherlock in his mouth again, and he had just come.
“What, why? Was it not a date?” Sherlock asks, and he seems genuinely confused now, and John doesn’t know what to say or do.
Sherlock turned back towards him, a slightly skeptical expression on his face, and John arched his brows. “What?”
He frowned thoughtfully at the display and a moment later found himself pushing the door open and the small tinkling sound of the bell rang through the shop above his head.
“Grab a towel,” Sherlock called out as John walked across the kitchen to the garden door. “The bench might still be wet.”
“True. Missed opportunity, there. Never thought to consider you might be sweets motivated,” John grinned.
He wasn’t sure what Sherlock had in mind. If he saw this being a recurring thing or just this one night.
Lestrade rattled off a location, and Sherlock waited until he left before spinning on the spot, and he can’t help it, he really can’t, so he spun around and did an excited little jump in the air. All that pent up giddiness from before has an outlet, and he was out the door and halfway down the stairs before he realized that he was missing an amazing opportunity.
Sherlock drew the bow down, pulling one long note that faded into the silent flat, and he put the instrument away with the same methodical precision and care as he always had. His head bowed, shoulders rounding inward slightly, before he turned, the mask that John always hated in place. He crossed over to his armchair, picked up the teacup, and took a sip.
“Seriously, Sherlock. This is the third time in two weeks you’ve run off without me,” John said, but then shook his head. “I mean, run off without backup. I’m worried you’re going to get yourself hurt beyond what a few stitches can heal.”
John sighed as he rubbed his hand down his face. “You’ve seen the news. I’m pretty sure we’re heading towards a quarantine situation.”
The ride was slow through the traffic of the evening, with the holiday shoppers and late-night parties, but he didn’t mind. He rested his head back against the seat cushion and closed his eyes, letting the hum of the vehicle wash over him and put him in a hazy state of mind.
Besides, John isn’t the type to go barking up a tree that has told him “no thanks”. Apparently, he was the kind of man who would sit at the base of that tree and beg for whatever attention the tree would give to him, though. Wait, he wasn’t supposed to be thinking about Sherlock anymore.
They were watching a decent comedy. He would have preferred the new horror film, but his date hadn’t been too keen on that idea, so comedy it was. She was leaning in towards him, sharing a bucket of popcorn, their hands occasionally touching as they reached for more. Entirely accidental, of course.
He reached down and waited to see if the dog would disagree with his actions before carefully lifting her.
“It was a date,” Sherlock says softly, his tone the same as when he’s deducing a crime scene and the pieces of the puzzle are all falling into place. John holds his gaze and something shifts in his friend’s eyes. Something shy and uncertain, but there was a heat there that caused John’s breath to quicken in response, and if he felt overwhelmed by Sherlock’s proximity before, then he was now drowning in it.
“I have this fantasy,” John began, voice soft and slow in the darkness that has settled around them, “where we wake up like this every day. We have breakfast together before going to the clinic or going on cases, and in the evenings when we go to sleep, it’s in the same bed. Like this.”
Sherlock’s voice, low and needy and demanding, the sharp slap of skin against skin, the scent of sex and sweat in the air, Sherlock’s hands clutching and scratching and holding him, was coming together in such a perfect symphony of lust and desire that John knew he wouldn’t last much longer.
John sighed at himself. God, his thoughts were so convoluted he wasn’t even making sense in his own head anymore.
Sherlock had smiled when John poured the wine and sliced the cake and accepted the wine without a word spoken between them. As the bottle emptied, they moved on to the scotch, which was how they found themselves in front of the fire, the evening slowing down around them and the warmth of each other's presence surrounding them.
A coffee shop might not be the fanciest place for a first date, but he knew she enjoyed coffee, and it seemed like a great choice for an afternoon date. John didn’t want to start anywhere too serious, such as a dinner date, seeing as they worked together. This could, if needed, be passed off as just two coworkers getting coffee together.
The only potential drawback was the shared bathroom, but he decided to be optimistic about the situation. Maybe the other room wasn’t let. Or, if it was, that person was a quiet recluse who just wanted to enjoy the holiday. He double-checked that the door to his room locked, and satisfied that it did, he brushed off any other concerns. The room had a small lockbox for anything truly valuable, and while a person could theoretically just pick it up and walk off if they wanted, he decided that they most likely wouldn’t bother.
A string of failed dates and a handful of one-night stands stretched behind him, but there was no one on the horizon. He just didn’t particularly care anymore and though he missed the intimacy, both physically and emotionally of being with another person, he couldn’t be bothered to put any effort into any relationship. Not yet, anyway. Maybe one day.
“Well, if you tell her, she’ll be less likely to fuss about it. She’ll do pretty much anything you ask,’ John wheedled.
Sherlock arched his brow at that, and John couldn’t help the huff of laughter that escaped him. He shook his head. “Never mind. I suppose you couldn’t do it without complaint.”
There was an arrangement of evergreen and candles on the table in front of the couch, a garland wrapped around the kitchen doorframe, another wreath decorated with pinecones was hanging over the mirror above the fireplace, and another garland wrapped around the banister that led up to his bedroom.
As it turned out, returning from the dead did earn a man a free meal, which John found more amusing than he probably should have. Angelo had stared for 30 seconds at the two men as they sat in the window seat they had so often occupied before, then exclaimed so loudly that the boy cleaning tables near him dropped the glasses he had just lifted from the table and they shattered on the floor.
“Because you didn’t want people thinking we were together,” Sherlock said quietly as he observed him.
When he was halfway up the stairs, feet falling exactly as they needed to remain undetected, he heard a quiet humming, and the adrenaline that a moment before had been coursing through him left, leaving him completely deflated.
He smiled into his mug as John settled onto the couch beside him with a muffled groan. John adjusted the blanket over their legs before leaning back and into Sherlock again. He took a bite of his biscuit, crumbs falling haphazardly. John lifted a hand and brushed the crumbs away.
“Don’t mention it, dear. Now what are you working on?” she asked as she lifted her cup of tea and settled into John’s chair.
“I haven’t given you a number. It would more than cover the cost of your share of the flat and anything else you could possibly need,” he said, and John shook his head hard.
“You weren’t answering my texts. I need your help. Lestrade called in a case. At least a seven,” he announced, a gleam in his eyes and John felt his heart rate jump in a way that it hadn’t been a moment ago.
A sharp rap on the door to the flat accompanied Mrs. Hudson’s call and John walked out of the kitchen to find his landlady standing with a plate of biscuits in the doorway and the dog wagging her tail so enthusiastically her entire body moved in an almost serpentine motion. He couldn’t help the smile that came to his face as he watched her sniff excitedly at the plate Mrs. Hudson held.
Sherlock nodded thoughtfully. It made sense, he supposed. It didn’t completely answer his question on why he never dated a man, though, and he craved answers. He set that one question aside for something else, though.
Looking around the room, he noticed a small table with an electric kettle, a french press with coffee, and an assortment of tea bags. He poured the water left from the bottle he bought at the airport into the kettle, pleased that it was enough to make to the minimum fill line, and flicked it on. He could use a cup of tea after traveling the morning. It was only early afternoon, so he had a few hours of daylight left. He would have his tea, then head out for a bit of sightseeing and dinner.
He did a turn in the middle of the sitting room. Already the flat felt more like home than his old one ever did, but there was something missing. He frowned in thought as he stared at the mantelpiece above the cold fireplace.
Sherlock wasn’t sure how, but they somehow managed to make their way to his bedroom through a series of pushing and pulling, leading and following, and when his knees hit the back of his bed he sat down on the mattress and it was the first time their mouths parted since they had begun.
While the water boiled, and then the tea left to steep, he took a moment to pull back the curtain covering the window. It looked out onto a small back alley. Nothing special or unique about it, but John liked it. There weren’t obvious signs of Christmas being a few days away, and he appreciated that. Luckily the room wasn’t in any way decorated, either. Well, not for Christmas, anyway. There were a few prints of paintings on the wall, just color blocking, but they looked nice in the room and gave a pleasant contrast to the white bedding.
On their walk, Sherlock had told him about where he had been these past two years. How he had tracked Moriarity’s network and people with the aid of Mycroft, infiltrated operations, been captured a handful of times, and escaped with some injuries. It sounded like a bloody Bond film, which John loved as an observer, but the reality had always seemed a bit far-fetched. John had been a military man, but the story Sherlock wove wasn’t straight-forward and had so many twists and turns in the dark and shadowed places of the world that John almost wished he would stop talking.
Joy followed after him, whining softly as she seemed to catch on to his mood, and John bent to pat her head to reassure her she hadn’t done anything wrong. He put the kettle on to boil, then went to fill Joy’s water bowl. Anything to keep from looking at the man that was now standing in the kitchen with him.
“That doesn’t mean anything,” she dismissed with a wave of her hand. “You will be having a ceremony, though? With a cake after?”
Of course, this was all assuming Sherlock was interested in engaging in any kind of relationship with John beyond what they already had anyway. A romantic one. With or without sex. Solitary shower wanks had served him well and he saw no reason why they wouldn’t continue to do so.
Sherlock held his eyes, a small smile on his face, and John felt far warmer than the weather and the rising sun could account for. He cleared his throat before turning back to look at Rosie and forced himself to take a fortifying sip of his coffee.
“Old habits,” Sherlock’s deep voice spoke softly by his ear and John turned his head for the first time to glance at him.
“Knowing how to make snow from sodium polyacrylate and water is a life lesson for a three year old?”
John’s smile fell as his muscles went lax and the bag in his hand fell to the ground. The heavy thunk of a glass bottle hitting the floor filled the silence of the room, but John heard nothing but a deep resonate baritone reverberating in his skull and the heavy thud of his own heartbeat.
John had been concerned that the incident with the wanking would make things awkward between them and perhaps keep Sherlock out of the room when John was showering, but it wasn’t a concern. Two days after the incident Sherlock swanned into the room while John was just getting into the shower after waiting for the water to warm up. He had had enough cold showers while in the army. He’d be damned if he was purposefully going to wait under a cold spray of water if he could help it.
Oh, he’s desperate. Sherlock hesitated a moment, his gaze flickering to John again before he turned back to the silver-haired man and nodded. “I’ll follow behind. Where at?”
“Is it even worth going for ‘truth’? You probably know all the answers to whatever you would ask anyway.”
His eyes were closed as the feelings crashed over him and he let them for just that moment. He could do this. He would do this. He would do anything for John Watson.
“Would you like me to tell you one of my favorite fantasies?” Sherlock asked. “Or I could show you.”
“Well, not just fish. Decaying seaweed and other marine plants. The bacteria that gather there and consume those products produce a gas called dimethyl sulfide and that’s what you’re smelling.”
He looked back down at his list, the fingers of his left hand tapping a rhythm against the tabletop, as he debated adding another name to the list. He grabbed his mug and gulped down the lukewarm tea, unconsciously pulling a face at the temperature, before he put it down and grabbed his pen again.
Sherlock had read the signs. Saw the flirtation and the subtle body language clues.  And then what had happened?
He felt like he had stood at the water’s edge all of his life; always standing at that brink of constantly shifting footing beneath him, just an illusion of solid ground, or allowing the tide to pull him into that bottomless fathom. The world had moved around him while he stood there as a boy who tried to avoid drunken fists, as a young man who went off to war because it was the only option, as an invalided soldier whose hands could no longer perform surgery. Then Sherlock had come sweeping into his life and he almost let him pull him into the ocean, but he hesitated, in fear or mistrust, and he was left standing there as Sherlock fell from a rooftop, and he told himself he was grateful that he never let himself be swept in because he would surely have drowned without Sherlock there.
“I believe I did what was necessary, but I see now that my actions may have been more hurtful than I intended,” Sherlock spoke formally, his voice lacking any kind of true emotion, and John frowned.
John’s attention fluctuated between the movie and the woman at his side, who John couldn’t help but notice smelled very nicely, especially when her hair brushed over her shoulders as she leaned closer for another bite of popcorn. Some kind of flower, he thought. Jasmine or gardenia, maybe. Whatever it was, she smelled lovely.
Rosie eyed him warily, small lips puckered out in a thoughtful pout. “Pinky swear?” she asked, sticking her whole hand out in offering.
John stared at it a moment before he reached out and took his hand in his own. His warm palm pressed against his, short fingers clasped tightly, then released after a quick shake.
A fresh wave of searing tears overtook him and he accepted his fate, knowing there would be no relief, that it was time to let it happen. Logic had no ground to stand on here.
“Well, dinner should be done in about 10 minutes or so. Would you mind putting those dishes in the fridge? Mrs. Hudson brought them up for Christmas.”
John smiled and sat down at the table across from his landlady. She poured them both mugs before he had a chance to pour for them, and he thanked her before he drank his tea and picked a biscuit.
By the time he resurfaced to the present and reached for his tea, he found it had gone cold. It was nearly noon which meant John would be off work soon and he would need to force his attention on the case. He shook his head vigorously from the quagmire that thoughts of John had left him in and focused again on the laptop.
He pulled on his warmest pajama bottoms and thickest jumper he could comfortably sleep in, then grabbed his duvet and pillow before heading back downstairs. The air grew steadily warmer as he made his way to the living room and he closed the doors that lead out to keep the heat locked in the room.
They continued to watch each other for several moments, just breathing, before John’s hand came up and tenderly caressed his face. His thumb traced just under his bottom lip and Sherlock caught it between his lips in a warm kiss before he released it.
They were in the middle of a serial murder investigation and he was trying to figure out why Rachel was significant. He didn’t have time to deal with meddling detectives, quietly judging ex-soldier doctors, his own convoluted feelings, eyeballs in the microwave, Mrs. Hudson’s nattering, and good god could everyone just shut up!
“Sherlock, no. I’m on a date,” he whispered furiously, eyes glancing towards his date who was watching the two men with round eyes.
John was slicing the mushrooms when the familiar call of Mrs. Hudson rang through the flat, followed by an excited bark from Joy, as Sherlock’s music played on. John called out that he was in the kitchen and a moment later she walked in, arms full with two casserole dishes, which she promptly placed down on the table.
Then Sherlock hooks his leg over John’s hip and twists, sending John tumbling down to the mattress and Sherlock on top.
“Thank you,” he forced out, his voice far too rough, and Sherlock’s hand dropped away from his chest as if electrified. He looked up and their eyes locked for a moment before Sherlock looked away again, color tingeing high on his cheeks.
There was even a sprig of mistletoe hung from the middle of the kitchen door jamb and John felt his eyes roll in exasperation. That was a complete waste of money, no matter that it was tradition. There was no one he was kissing and he didn’t see that changing anytime soon.
His brother made a reply, but he was already finished with the conversation and his meddling. He turned and began walking away. He heard John say something to Mycroft, but it wasn’t important and he kept going. A moment later John caught up to him.
John was walking at his usual pace, hands held loosely at his sides, as he made his way down the pavement. Londoners were out in droves thanks to the approaching holiday, crowding around storefronts and cafes, causing foot traffic to occasionally come to a standstill as people had to maneuver around.
“Going to sleep, John. It’s been a long day,” Sherlock replied nonchalantly, but his eyes took in the sight of John as he stood there and he felt himself grow harder under that look alone.
He pushed himself to sit and glanced into the kitchen where he saw the bags of takeaway scattered over the table, but no sign of John. Once he pulled the plate over he saw that the food was still warm, so John was either in his room again or had gone back out. He listened for a moment for any movement anywhere in the flat and decided that he was out.
John’s heart had thudded hard in his chest as he watched the little tableau in his small bedroom. The quiet loveliness of Sherlock singing a lullaby to an infant, John’s daughter, as he rocked her to sleep in his arms made his chest ache with fondness for the man. He had been so worried that Sherlock would grow tired of him and the restrictions having an infant in their flat would necessarily put on them, but he had slowly begun to accept that maybe it would be okay. That maybe he could have Sherlock and Rosie.
Once in his room, he picked out a dark suit and blue button-down and dressed himself as he forced his mind to turn to the actual case. Alex had provided Sherlock with all manner of information that he thought might be relevant to his case, and he felt fairly positive it would be an easy problem to solve.
Somehow, John wasn’t surprised when he found himself outside the wrought iron gates that marked the entrance to the graveyard where an empty box laid in a hole in the ground.
He sighed, unable to explain to her the importance of John’s smile and how Alexander Campbell was the one who could get him to smile like that again. His shoulders rose and fell again in a shrug.
“If having Mycroft as a brother-in-law is the price to pay for being your husband, then I’ll gladly pay it.”
“It’s always been you, Sherlock,” John's voice came out muffled from where he had turned his head into Sherlock’s neck.
“What? When I asked if he was seeing anyone?” John asked and Sherlock nodded. John seemed to realize when he had left, but he didn’t know how much Sherlock had heard of their conversation before that point.
He wants Sherlock to know that he sees through the game he has been playing. A part of him wonders if Sherlock even realizes what he has been doing.
Sherlock let out a sound that sounded almost like a sob as he started to come. Long ropes of come shot out and splattered over his chest and stomach as his back bowed, head thrown back and mouth open on a silent cry. His arse clenched around John and he pulled Sherlock’s hips tighter to him, fucking into him faster.
They both managed to hold a straight face for roughly five seconds before breaking out into laughter. Sherlock’s deep chuckle and John’s high giggle mingled together in a bubble of mirth around them and John let himself live in that moment for a while. A happy Sherlock was truly something to behold and he would hold on to that as long as he could.
He needed to get past whatever these feelings were. John did not belong to him. John had a past. Apparently tall, attractive, very gay Alexander Campbell was a part of that past, and he needed to accept and move on from that knowledge. He was well aware that these feelings weren’t unfamiliar to him when it came to John. A veritable parade of women had been in and out of John’s life during their friendship, and Sherlock was honest enough with himself at least to admit that all of those women had caused similar reactions in him. The introduction of Alex was a much stronger feeling, though. It wasn’t that he disliked him, not exactly. He had no reason to dislike the man. He was reasonably intelligent and seemed at least genuine in his regard for John. It also wasn’t jealousy, not at its core, though the jealousy was certainly there.
He wanted to believe him, to have faith in him. Wanted to take this second chance and make the most of it. Wanted his friend back.
“Oh Sherlock, what have you done?” she exclaimed. A sudden crash from the flat above forced their attention upwards as they realized they weren’t alone in the building.
“You won’t. I’m afraid you’re rather stuck with me now,” Sherlock promised, and John smiled before he wrapped a hand behind his detective’s head and pulled him down for another kiss.
“Good. I’m glad,” Sherlock replied, then opened and closed his mouth, as if there was something more he wanted to say, but didn’t know if he should. Or how to say it.
He pulled out his phone in an attempt to keep his hands busy. He had been sitting here for nearly an hour now. He had noticed, though he tried not to, the occasional glances from other patrons that had come in at the same time he had. Pity and “poor sod” were clear in all of those glances, as it appeared that John had been stood up.
“John, you’re thinking so loudly I’m surprised the whole restaurant can't hear you,” he says, and John huffs out a breath of a laugh.
When he forced his eyes back to Sherlock’s, he saw that Sherlock read every thought he had had the way he used to. He wasn’t completely convinced that Sherlock wasn’t able to read his mind, actually. The man wasn’t a mind-reader, in general. Just a John-reader.
“We come home from a case, both high on the adrenaline, the rush, and you can’t keep your hands off me. You grab me. Pull me close to you. You want me and you can’t wait. You drop to your knees as you pull at my belt, my trousers. You don’t even push down my pants before you have your mouth on me.”
John looked up at him, his brow furrowed slightly as an emotion crossed his features that Sherlock couldn’t name, but then he looked down at his tea, and Sherlock wondered what he had missed.
The shadow that had been following him doggedly since his day had begun took its opportunity to start clawing its fingers into his mind. He swallowed convulsively around the lump that formed in the back of his throat as his thoughts started to spiral out, but his mouth had gone dry. Chest tight, he kept his pace and tried to focus on the steady tread of his legs on the pavement. The cold air on his face. Blaring horns and angry shouts, crying babies in prams and the screech of tires as traffic slowed yet again. Anything to focus on but the shadow that lurked and prodded his defenses, searching for a way in, any weakness.
Love. They all spoke of love. Romantic love, besotted love, promised love, true love. He didn’t know every flower's name, but he understood their message.
So he watched more videos, Mrs. Hudson supervised when he asked for help in baking biscuits or bread, and several months passed as he threw himself fully into his new hobby, for lack of a better word.
It was an unfamiliar feeling. Needing someone. Wanting someone. And he did want him. As a flatmate and friend, yes, but the more time they spent together, the more the idea of John’s precise hands on his skin invaded his thoughts. Hands that caressed flesh for the purpose of pleasure rather than healing. The hair on the back of his neck rose as his mind supplied images and sensations and he suppressed a delightful shiver. He forced his attention back to the present and the man in front of him.
“No need. Mrs. Hudson brought up a casserole earlier,” Sherlock said as he left the kitchen with his still full mug and headed back to the couch.
“She helped. With everything. She knew. She knows I’m back, too. I saw her after I visited Lestrade.”
Rosie ran up to the table and climbed atop a chair in front of one of the plates and stuffed a whole slice of apple in her mouth.
John looked up at him from his knees and Sherlock’s heartbeat thundered in his ears as all the blood in his body rushed to his cock, causing it to twitch, and John’s eyes shifted at the movement. He watched as John leaned in and pressed a delicate kiss to the inside of his thigh as his hands caressed his calves and up to his knees, then down again. John trailed warm kisses up his thigh and stopped right at the edge of his black pants. John looked up at him again and he forgot how to breathe as John drifted forward and buried his nose into the side of his cock and inhaled deeply. John sighed, and his breath was hot against him through the fabric. He briefly wondered if the sight of John Watson breathing him in would be enough to kill him.
Instead of hailing another cab, he turned and walked down the pavement. His mobile pinged with a text in his pocket, but he didn’t bother to check it. It was at least an hour walk back to Baker Street from here and he settled into his stride. The flats, shops, restaurants, people, businesses he passed were blurred and non-consequential. His stomach roiled, twisting and coiling in on itself and he rode out a wave of nausea.
“Why do you think I was chasing someone? I just got here,” Sherlock answered, and John knew his face showed his disbelief.
John bit back the smile that wanted to come across his face. “Deal,” he said instead as he reached out and clasped Sherlock’s hand firmly and gave it a shake.
Sherlock turned back towards his doorway. Let his eyes focus on the corner of the window that he could see through the open doorway. John’s hand fell away from his back, but he stayed where he was. He heard John take a deep breath, then exhale slowly as he prepared to say whatever it was that he needed to say.
“That’s the spirit,” John laughed before swiftly hooking his thumbs into Sherlock’s pants and pulling them down and off Sherlock’s legs. “God, you’re beautiful.”
“I’d rather stand,” he replied, his tone matching the coolness from the stranger in front of him. He didn’t want to play games tonight. “Who are you? What do you want?”
Suddenly, Sherlock’s warm hand closed over John’s ankle and he yelped loudly as his foot started to slide.
“Goodnight, honeybee,” his rich baritone whispered and John’s chest tightened at the endearment that fell so genuinely from his lips. He realized that he was witnessing something he never had before; the small routines that were followed when Sherlock was the one to put her to bed rather than John. It was a private moment, and John almost felt like an intruder, but neither Sherlock nor Rosie seemed to mind his presence.
He would have to pay her back. He hadn’t planned on getting a tree, but then, he hadn’t the last year either. One had turned up then, too.
She was pretty, he could admit, and rather charming in an aggressive kind of way, and he didn’t completely hate the ten minutes they spent talking. She supplied him without another drink and when John was half-way through it he realized he was hovering rather close to the edge of overindulging in alcohol, more so than he had meant to, given it was a work event.
“You cook?” she cut him off in surprise, and John wasn’t sure whether to be offended by the tone of her voice or not.
“Thank you, John.” Sherlock blew across the surface of the steaming liquid before he took a careful sip and John had to force himself to look away from the pout of Sherlock’s lips as he did so.
I hope you enjoyed this second day at the beach! Kudos and comments are always appreciated and treasured as much as sea glass. 💜
Sherlock had deduced John’s previous sexual experience with men, but he figured it had been something that he had experimented with during his years at war with his fellow soldiers. Perhaps a drunken encounter during his days at university. Rather innocent and innocuous incidents, he assumed. He never thought it had gone further than physical interactions.
The sound of bags and boxes being opened in the kitchen drifted down the hallway into the bathroom. The fridge door opened, then closed. The click of the kettle as it turned itself off. Soft thumps of two mugs set down on the tabletop. He let himself slip further under the hot water, over his clavicle, his neck. His eyes drifted closed as he breathed in the lavender-scented steam, the gentle lap of the water as he shifted his body, resettled.
“I mean that I love you, Sherlock. I love you, and I’m sorry if that’s not what you want to hear. I know that,” but what he knew was cut off as Sherlock suddenly leaned forward and pressed his lips to his in a warm kiss.
John suspected that it had far more to do with the man beside him than the physical address that woke such sentiment in him.
Sherlock didn’t respond, but he saw him move in the corner of his eye to put them up, and neither of them said a word about the bag. A moment later Sherlock was pulling down dishes and utensils, then pouring out two glasses of wine from the bottle John had opened to make the risotto. There was a silence about them, but it wasn’t uncomfortable. It was a gentle silence that spoke more of healing than hurting. John felt his shoulders relax, unaware that he had been tensed up in the moments before.
“Goodnight, Sherlock,” he called out as he stuck his head back out of the kitchen. His friend was still sitting on the couch. He seemed lost in thought.
“Of course, I forgive you,” John replied, recalling those painful minutes when he was convinced that he was about to die after just finding out that Sherlock was still alive. How unfair life had seemed in those moments. Even then, he still couldn’t give voice to the feelings in his heart. No wonder he still held them so close to his chest this far down the road. He was definitely not a fearless man.
She shrieked and danced around excitedly. “Thank you, Daddy, thank you! You’re the best daddy in the whole wide world,” she proclaimed with absolute conviction, and John tried to keep the sadness out of his smile at her praise. She was 3 now, almost 4, and while she accepted her life with the ease of the young, she had started questioning things as she learned more about other families from her daycare. Her family looked different than her little friends, and while she asked the questions with innocent curiosity, John couldn’t help the feelings of guilt that went through him every time they came up. He wanted to be enough for her, and sometimes he worried he never would be.
Ha! Mycroft tried to sink his claws into John Watson and the man shook him off. That was fantastic! He could just imagine the look on Mycroft’s face when John had rejected his offer of money, and he was almost sad he missed the exchange. Yes, there was definitely more to John than met the eye. He needed him to move in!
“No...I pretended I had a body I needed to examine and I left them there,” he said, and Molly shook her head at him.
When the water began to cool he turned off the tap and quickly toweled off, then went into his bedroom to dress in his pajamas and blue dressing gown. He wasn’t going back out tonight, so he might as well be comfortable.
“You knew. The language of the flowers, didn’t you? Asking for forgiveness and new beginnings. It was on purpose.”
She stood up when her tea was gone and took her mug over to the sink. He glanced at her as she gave it a quick wash before placing it face down to dry on the little rack beside the small sink. She turned to leave as John looked at the clock on the wall behind him to see if he had time for a cup of tea before the end of his lunch break.
John ate his dinner in his chair by the fire, not even bothering to remove the chow mein from its carton while watching a Doctor Who reruns on the telly. He watched another rerun while waiting for the room to warm before finally conceding defeat to the ache in his muscles and the heaviness in his eyes.
Unfortunately, the pub was about as awful as he had anticipated. Whether it was a self-fulfilling prophecy or not was beyond the point. He found himself tucked into a booth between one of his fellow doctors and one of the clinic’s receptionists, sipping on a lukewarm beer, and he wasn’t completely confident that he could recall the names of anyone that he was sitting with and worked with on a daily basis.
The man’s head tilted slightly as he looked at John, a hint of something almost like approval on his features before his face went still again.
He hooked a leg over John and flipped them so that he was on top. The image of John smiling up at him, his upper body and his cheeks flushed with his arousal, was instantly catalogued, put in a frame, and placed on a pedestal in his Mind Palace without any conscious decision on his part. This John was the most beautiful creature he had ever seen, and he was the reason why he was smiling like that, and Sherlock had to taste it. John hummed his approval at the kiss, then groaned when Sherlock rolled his hips against him.
“No,” he replied honestly. “I don’t. I am, however, a very observant man which I’m sure comes as no surprise to you.”
John stood up, and Sherlock grabbed John’s coat from the back of his chair and practically threw it at him as he ran out of the door and John was forced to run out after him to catch up, with the new nurse left sitting at the table by herself.
“Bed?” he asks, breaking the kiss just enough to let out the single word, and Sherlock answers with a press of his hips into John’s body, and John’s brain temporarily stops at the feel of Sherlock’s arousal against him.
His muscles were burning, his skin uncomfortably hot and too tight, but he felt none of it. He was adrift in his mind; anchorless; drowning. Madness held him, swaddled and unable to move, picking at his sanity and unraveling whatever was left. There was nothing he could do. Nothing. No one to save him. No one.
“Thank you,” Sherlock murmured as he took a careful sip of the hot beverage. He hummed in appreciation. “Perfect, John, as always.”
Then Mary came, and he let himself be carried in a bit, thinking she would be a reliable life vest, but she did the unthinkable and he was suddenly struggling in the water with a baby in his arms and left wondering why he ever bothered to trust anyone.
John quickly turned his snort of laughter into a cough and Sherlock really did send a glare at him for that. He held back the desire to stick his tongue out at him.
John stared at the glowing red numbers of his alarm clock in his still dark room. It wasn’t quite 5 yet, but he knew he would get no more rest. He was too familiar with the feeling in his gut after years in a war zone and nightmares and late nights following a madman to ignore. His body and mind were too awake now.
John smiled at the words and appreciated the blush that crept up Sherlock’s cheeks when he realized what he said.
It was raining by the time they left the restaurant, full of delicious wine and dessert they had shared. Sherlock flipped the collar of his coat up, eyes cutting across to John, and John couldn’t help the smile that comes to his face at the look.
All of the windows were open to let in the breeze. The house smelled of the garden and the sea. Golden light shone through the glass and white linen curtains and cast the rooms in the soft glow of the warm afternoon. Rosie’s song as she sang to herself among the trees filtered through the open window and John was fairly sure he never wanted to leave.
He turned and made his way to his bedroom while John pulled out his mobile to call the Thai restaurant that was on his speed dial. The one near Baker Street, not the one near his bedsit, to place their usual order. Their usual order, because they were so often together and sharing meals and this space. He let the smile come to his face then as he closed the door to his room to take a quick shower and change.
“Please, do tell me what brings you here, and try not to be dull,” he said swiftly, ignoring the small John-sounding voice in his head that told him to stop being rude.
“Where on earth did someone find daffodils this time of year?” he asked the black stone with a frown. “They aren’t in any of the flower shops I’ve been to.”
He tried to ignore it, but the thing growing in John’s chest felt horribly like hope and he didn’t know what to do with such an emotion anymore.
“Saw a lot of injuries. Violent deaths. Had your share of trouble too, I’d wager,” Sherlock continued, and John felt like he was being set up for something, but he wasn’t quite sure what.
Unbidden images of John sexually satisfying men then assaulted him, and it took far more self-control than he liked to rid the images from his mind again. It would have been far too easy to insert himself in those mental images and in the middle of a coffee shop was neither the time nor place for such thinking.
“Come up here,” Sherlock says, and John stares in appreciation for a moment before crawling up over Sherlock’s body, his knees bracketing his hips and his hands over his shoulders as he leans over him before claiming his mouth in a kiss, tongues meeting and sliding against each other. Sherlock’s arms came up and pulled him down to cover his body, and they both shivered at the sudden warmth and contact.
There was a bag in the fridge that he had not put there. A bag he would have never put in his fridge, ever. A bag of something that used to belong to a someone, or several someone’s, judging by the contents that he really didn’t want to examine too closely as he finally reached around the offending bag and grabbed the container of mushrooms that was behind it. He pulled out the butter and parmesan, as well, because he didn’t want to open the fridge again any time soon.
He glanced down at the mess on his stomach and sighed, then carefully pulled his pants and trousers back over his hips. He tucked his still sensitive cock into his pants but didn’t bother to zip or button the trousers back on. As he pushed himself to sit and then stand, he felt a brief flicker of guilt over masturbating while he thought of John, but his post-orgasm chemical reactions were still too high for the guilt to last long. Serotonin and dopamine flushed through his brain and he let himself enjoy it.  He’d take a shower and sort through any guilt that remained after. He doubted there would be any. It wasn’t the first time he had climaxed while imagining it was John who brought him to it, and he highly doubted it would be the last.
He hated the way the ponce spoke in fucking riddles. Why couldn’t he just be straightforward and say whatever it was he seemed to expect from John so John could tell him to fuck off without any inconvenient curiosity because there was no fucking way he was doing anything for Mycroft Holmes.
The song had entered into an instrumental interlude as John began to lead him in a slow sway to the music rather than a waltz. John’s hand was warm and dry in his own, the one on his back was steady, and applying gentle pressure as he pulled their bodies closer.
“Why ever not?” he exclaimed in surprise. John blinked at him, surprised in his own right, at the reaction.
The cabbie nodded and fell blessedly silent after that. Sherlock watched London blur past the window as his thoughts raced themselves. The restaurant had looked a bit busy when they had stepped up. Were John and Alex talking now? Had they managed to get a table or were they still waiting? Were they flirting, getting to know each other again, sharing lingering looks and not-so-casual touches? Was that smile on John’s face?
“Did you see this card from Lestrade?” Sherlock asked as John handed him a glass filled with the cocktail that Mrs. Hudson had insisted they needed to provide for the gathering they would be having later. It was red and festive and filled with gin, so John figured it would fill the requirement Mrs. Hudson exacted on them.
They both fell quiet after that and remained that way for the remainder of the taxi ride. Sherlock found himself in the rather unanticipated situation of being surprised by someone. No one had ever called his deductions extraordinary before. Especially when they were about them. That was...different. Interesting. He glanced at the smaller man beside him, eyes narrowed thoughtfully, but then the taxi pulled up outside the crime scene and they climbed out of the car and made their way to the police tape.
“In the way of what, exactly, Sherlock? Did you think I was going to jump the man in our living room if he said he was available? Do you honestly think I’m that desperate to get a leg over?”
The buzzing ring of the bell had that perfect amount of maximum pressure just at the half-second. “Client,” he called out loud, only to realize he was alone in the room. Oh, yes, John said something about needing milk or eggs or a new jumper or something. It didn’t matter what it was, really. Mrs. Hudson had already answered the door and he could hear her voice mingling with a man’s deep baritone. Scottish, but one who had been living in London for some time.
His brother was quiet for several moments. “Well, I look forward to meeting this person,” he eventually replied.
“Can I help you look for anything in particular?” the woman at the end of the aisle asked after John had looked up at her greeting.
He had pulled it out to wrap Sherlock’s gift when Sherlock had gone upstairs after Rosie had called down that she wanted a bedtime story when she was supposed to be asleep.
“Thank you,” he forced out, his voice barely catching on the way out, but even that was more than enough of a tell for Sherlock to pick up on. He didn’t mention it, though, and John relaxed a moment before turning to him. “Shall I get you, then?”
“I’m sorry, John,” he uttered quietly. And he was. It wasn’t a big lie. A small one, barely worth even calling a lie, but denying he had returned apparently qualified as a lie to John Watson, and they had promised no more lies.
When Mary’s past came creeping up on them and she killed Sherlock, no matter how briefly, John became numb. The woman he had told himself he loved, who was pregnant with their child, had shot his best friend. He had almost lost Sherlock again. And Sherlock kept trying to defend her, which John never could understand. He went back to her because Sherlock insisted that he needed to be there for Mary and the baby. But he went back mostly because a large part of him was terrified that Mary would kill Sherlock if he did not return to her. She was dangerous and he couldn’t chance her taking off with their child or finishing off Sherlock. He went back to his lying, murderous wife for Sherlock, and didn’t that just speak volumes?
The ride on the Tube was atrocious. It was always packed with commuters, of which he was one, and he often found himself standing between people cursing the lack of proper WiFi on the Tube when important calls cut out or their emails wouldn’t load, and it was almost enough to make him want to pay the fees for a taxi to drive him. Or even learn to drive himself.
He walked out of the flat, following the cabbie, and climbed into the back of the taxi. He needed to know. Why was he killing strangers? How was he getting them to take the poison? The cabbie was clever. He was playing him, Sherlock knew he was, but he had to know. The murderer promised him answers, and he would do what was needed to get them.
“John?” Sherlock called out after a moment, and John bit his lips tightly together to keep from making any noise.
An attractive dark-haired woman was in the car, and other than giving him a name, which was most likely fake, she stared and tapped away on her Blackberry. John sat back, resigned to at least get somewhat comfortable for the ride. If nothing else, he didn’t have to pay for a taxi.
“No, I don’t think so, miss. You’ll eat your lunch, and Sherlock and Daddy will eat their lunch, and then we’ll go,” he said, and she rolled her eyes before she took another bite of her lunch and turned towards the open door to look out at the garden.
“Well, it will be infinitely easier keeping you alive if I just go ahead and live there,” John replied after a moment of silent contemplation.
“John, I think you should know I consider myself married to my work and while I’m flattered by your interest,” Sherlock began.
“I wasn’t expecting you today. Did you text? I left my mobile at home. I have no idea how I did that,” she fired off quickly as she stood up, but Sherlock waved her back down.
Freshly brewed coffee and sizzling bacon brought Sherlock to consciousness the next morning. The aromas and the pop of the bacon in the pan on the hob had invaded his dreams, leaving him with the odd sensation of having been making breakfast while standing on a rooftop before being tied down and strapped to two poles. He hadn’t been having a nightmare, it hadn’t quite reached that point, but curls sticky with sweat clung to his forehead and he was grateful he had skipped putting on a shirt to sleep in last night. His chest was slick with sweat and he didn’t like the sensation of wet cotton adhered to his body.
“Well, it’s Valentine’s Day. Cupid and love and all that. Everyone is thinking about sex and fantasies today.”
He quickly wetted down a flannel once the water was warm and cleaned his stomach with perfunctory proficiency before he went back to the bedroom. The sight of John Watson laid stretched out on his bed looking completely debauched and thoroughly ravished was the most beautiful he had ever seen. He crossed over to him and gently cleaned him with the flannel while John watched him with a small smile on his face.
At some point, and John wasn’t sure exactly when it was, but he started to always assume that Sherlock would make his way into the loo while John showered. It didn’t happen every day, but it was more often than not.
He didn’t like the feeling of sitting in a taxi anymore. Of trusting that the person driving him will actually get him to his destination instead of something far more sinister now that he would inevitably be alone whenever he would travel. And honestly, the idea of driving made his stomach twist uncomfortably. He had never seen the point in learning to drive when he lived in a city with (mostly) reliable public transport and when he was in the RAMC there had been no need for him to drive, either.
He needed John to be his flatmate. He sat in that chair one time, two months ago, and Sherlock had  filed it away as “John’s chair”. If John wasn’t there, then whose chair was it?
“About how he might have been part dog, I think. He and Joy share a lot of similarities,” John grinned and Mrs. Hudson tutted in that gently chiding way she did.
He knew it wasn’t maybe the most healthy thing to do, but he often found himself there when he had something on his mind and wanted to talk. Sherlock listened just as well in his grave as he did to John when he was alive. He figured it was only fair that he got to talk to Sherlock when he wasn’t there considering all the times Sherlock talked to him when he hadn’t been there. In some weird way, it seemed to work out in his head.
“The door should be unlocked. Mummy had the kitchen stocked this morning,” Sherlock told him as they turned to walk up the path.
“I’m ready!” she announced as she ran into the kitchen, bare feet slapping loudly on the tile floor.
John ground his teeth at the repeated statement. No. He wasn’t a doctor. Not anymore. A bullet in Afghanistan saw to that.
They stayed there for several minutes, their quiet breathing and the muted traffic outside the windows the only sound in the room.
“John. It’s perfect. We can drive down Friday morning, spend the weekend there, and drive back on Monday. If it’s going to be this hot we might as well enjoy it properly. Besides, look at how excited Rosie is,” Sherlock drawled with a hint of a smirk on his lips as Rosie turned to look at him as well. Sherlock whispered in her ear again and she nodded enthusiastically before he placed her down and she ran up to him.
Sherlock took a deep breath in through his nose, then released it slowly. “Nowhere. I was just out walking.”
Sherlock smiled as his free hand came up to cup John’s cheek, his long fingers curling around the back of his head.
John had managed to fall asleep for an hour or two at the kitchen table, which was truly unfortunate for his neck and shoulder. At the time, he supposed that if that had to happen, at least it was on the day when he didn’t have to work. There was the office party that evening, but that had been plenty of time for paracetamol to kick in, and he was relaxed enough after spending the day picking up around the flat, playing with Joy, and eating more of Mrs. Hudson’s biscuits when she came up for tea.
“Oh, Sherlock…,” she said. “Why?” she questioned, seemingly unable to come up with anything else to say or ask.
Sherlock looked up at him with an expression that John couldn’t quite make out, but then his brows drew down in curiosity.
Luckily, the conversation drifted away from anything that he needed to reply to and he finished off his pint with the bare minimum of interactions possible.
John felt his mouth as it opened slightly under the feeling of Sherlock’s thumb as it trailed under his bottom lip again.
The pickle was, thankfully, an ornament and not the real pickle she had initially insisted on. Her giving up without fight had been a Christmas miracle.
“You with me?” John asked with a smile, the playful mood Sherlock had managed to destroy earlier apparently back.
She huffed and relaxed further, accepting or waving off his apologies he supposed, and he sighed in reply.
“Mrs. Hudson moved it last night after she brought in the food. I think she thought there was a better chance we’d find ourselves standing together here.”
At some point during their discussion, Sherlock heard the downstairs door open and the familiar gait of John climbing the stairs. He saw the doctor come in and head straight to the kitchen, his arms full of bags from the grocer.
No. Better to bury this down and continue on, as before. Sherlock couldn’t make him happy, but there was someone who did, once upon a time. Someone who could do it again. He pulled his mobile from his pocket and fired off a quick text to John.
Sherlock let his fingers curl around John’s shoulder as the shorter man led them in a tight circle in the available space of their small kitchen. Their feet barely shuffled as they moved to the smooth, bluesy rhythm of the song, the pluck of the guitar against the steady beat of the background drums. Sherlock leaned down just a touch to let his nose brush against the silvery-gold strands of John’s hair and breathed in the scent of lemon-verbena shampoo, which caused a smile to pull at his lips. When they had first moved in together, John had used the cheapest shampoo he could buy with some atrocious artificial coconut scent. The one he used now was more mid-range and the scent far more subtle. It didn’t mask the natural scent of the man he held in his arms. That blend of shampoo and tea and the dish soap he had used, then the scent of deodorant and clean sweat, and underneath that the sharp tang of gunpowder. The scents that made up the man.
Sherlock gave a small smile. “I hardly think chocolate is the worst thing I have had stain any of my clothes,” he reminded him and John let out the laugh that bubbled up at that.
So he laid out the facts. How quickly he was now able to solve cases with John at his side. How that time had proved crucial in several cases in just the past few months. John seemed skeptical at first, but Sherlock could see the moment he finally began to give in. To accept and believe what he was saying. That John was important to the Work, which was true. If John understood that he was also important to him, well, that was harder to read.
“Originally, I had thought we’d have some wine while we talked in the garden, then come in, go to bed, and keep ignoring what has been growing between us for years.”
“Everything ok?” John asked curiously and Sherlock almost wanted to scream at the nonchalance in his question.
A quick bath with as many bubbles as Rosie could ever wish for, then snuggly PJs, and Rosie was tucked into the soft pink sheets and duvet with her new rabbit held safely in her arms. He heard the shower running as he read her a bedtime story, and as usual one story turned into three, which was why he was still reading when Sherlock finished with his shower and came into the room just as John put down the last book.
John wanted. His body was alive with it, his heart beating heavy in his chest as the blood rushed through his veins and his skin tingled.
He heard the click of the door being shut and turned to hastily wipe down the tiles in the front of the shower that he had somehow managed to decorate. Damn. That had been one hell of an orgasm.
He was glad for that, though. He wasn’t sure he could give Joy up, even though it had only been a week. She had wormed her way so intrinsically into his heart and life, filling holes he knew was there but didn’t think would ever be filled again, that the thought of not having her there was almost painful.
He watched as a blush rushed up into Sherlock’s cheeks, pinkening the pale skin, which only added to the beauty of the man. In lieu of a reply, though, he turned and rummaged in the beach bag for another towel. He found one and stepped up to John, brought the towel up, and dried his hair with a tiny smile.
Sherlock looked at him, likely reading all of his thoughts, and he frowned slightly. John turned his eyes to Rosie, who was oblivious to the scars under her palms, and silently vowed to himself that he would do whatever he needed to do to show Sherlock that he was not his scars. They told a part of his story, but they were not his whole story. Like the sea glass they had found. It looked different than it was before, frosted and textured instead of clear and smooth, but it was still glass.
He didn’t often let his mind wander in that direction, but the strong drink in his blood and Sherlock’s closed eyes gave him the confidence to ignore how dangerous those thoughts could be.
Sherlock eyed him for a moment, then placed the board in the basket he had already filled with a few lunch and snack items. John walked over and found a few water bottles to toss in the basket, and an ice pack in the freezer to help keep everything cold while Sherlock continued to look through the fridge.
Sherlock’s brows arched up, but he didn’t reply or even open his eyes as John settled down in his chair and bit into one of the ginger nuts.
The limp was interesting, and Sherlock filed that away for later dissection. It wasn’t important at the moment and could be dealt with in the future. Right now he needed to draw this man in. Use the information he read off of him to his advantage.
“Want to see some more?” Sherlock asked and almost smiled when he saw the way John’s eyes lit up at the invitation.
Sherlock shook his head and closed his eyes against the concerned look in John’s steady gaze. John’s hands slipped away and a whoosh of cold air filled the space between them as John stepped away to turn off the music. Silence filled the kitchen.
They walked into the flat at Baker Street, pulling off coats and hanging them on hooks, before collapsing against the wall. John giggled, and he couldn’t hold back a responding chuckle at the delighted sound. A knock at the door interrupted their laughter and Sherlock grinned.
He crossed over to the bed, dutifully removed the duvet that covered her small form, then carefully replaced it and tucked it in around her. She smiled at the familiar routine and John watched the interaction thoughtfully.
Sherlock stared at him for a moment, attempting to hold back the smile he felt tugging at the corners of his lips until he finally gave in to it. He glanced down, biting on his bottom lip to get his smile back under control before he looked back up at him.
“Obviously,” Sherlock replied as he gestured towards the empty chair where all their clients sat. “Have a seat.”
He shook his head at himself, even as his feet started to speed up, his eyes locked on the dark head of hair that was now further away. John knew it was impossible, that it had to just be a resemblance and nothing more, but his body followed instinctively. The man never looked back, and John lost sight of him several times, but just when he was about to give up, he’d spot the swirl of a greatcoat again and pick up speed. He got stuck at crosswalks and behind holiday shoppers, but he kept going, trying to catch up and just see.
“Find anything out about the case?” John suddenly asked with his head turned slightly in Sherlock’s direction, though his eyes remained facing forward, when they were about half a block from the restaurant.
John turned to look at him with a curious tilt to his head as Sherlock pushed the blanket off of his legs and walked back to their bedroom without a further word. He returned a few moments later with a wrapped box and handed it to John with a smirk before sitting down on the table in front of John.
His mind wandered back to his visit to Sherlock’s grave as he watched the small flame wave flicker and move. Mrs. Hudson’s hip had been bothering her that morning. She had stayed home to rest it, but had insisted that John leave Joy downstairs with her to keep her company. He agreed after taking her for a quick walk and had left the two of them sitting happily on the couch watching some game show, Joy’s head resting atop Mrs. Hudson’s thighs as she scratched her ears and waved John out of the door.
Three careful strides placed him right in front of John. He wasn’t completely in his personal space, but he was on the edge of being closer than strictly necessary. John watched him carefully.
The man appeared to find the page he was looking for. “‘An intermittent tremor in hand as a result of PTSD’,” the man read out before he looked back up at John. “Your hand has been completely still the entire time we’ve been here. You aren’t afraid,” he said.
He watched Sherlock’s shadow throw a hand up dramatically. Could envision the pointing finger. “I know you heard me! I’m giving you one more minute to get out, or I’m flushing the toilet,” he threatened.
Sherlock moaned beneath him, pushing up into his mouth, and John pulled away to blow across the sensitive flesh.
Mrs. Hudson did not, in fact, murder John or the dog when she had ventured up the stairs to 221B the morning after John found her. He had washed off the mud as well as he could, which wasn’t very considering the size of the tub and the lack of dog shampoo, but she was cleaner than she had been. The tawny shade of her fur was at least separate from the brown patches that wrapped around her eyes and down her face. He had wrapped her leg in an attempt to help alleviate the pain she was experiencing, then he had gone to sleep on the couch because he didn’t want to leave her alone in a strange place. She had curled up on the floor near his head and that was where Mrs. Hudson found them.
Sherlock blinked. That wasn’t at all what he expected to come out of John. While his statement might be factually true to his experiences with Sherlock, they were incredibly wrong. No, he hadn’t dated because he saw no point in it, but he had been in a couple of relationships before. Years before, but still. He didn’t understand what that had to do with anything, though. He
Sherlock threw a hand in the air and waved it frantically as if trying to cleanse the air of the statement. “It’s not the same.”
He would accept his miracle and be grateful for that second chance at the most fulfilling friendship he had ever had.
He watched as Sherlock’s mouth stretched into a soft smile, but he said nothing, so John turned back to watch his daughter again. They were quiet for several more minutes before Sherlock stretched his arms out, pulling John’s attention back to him as he pushed himself upright.
Sherlock took the phone and fired off a quick text. The flash of a flesh-toned patch on his skin caught John’s attention.
They started with breakfast foods because she insisted that it was the most important meal of the day, and since he could reliably make some breakfast foods already, then it would be a good place to start because he already had some experience.
Sherlock’s voice was deep and low, barely audible over the crackling of the fire. John’s eyes flicked up from his examination of Sherlock’s feet and just how close he could let his own feet come to them without touching, but Sherlock’s eyes were still closed.
“Just try to not jump in the mud!” he called out through the open door, but he knew even as he said it that it was a lost cause.
He liked this pub because it was within easy walking distance of Baker Street. It gave him time to stretch his legs and sober up a smidge, plus it had the added benefit of allowing him to reminisce in a causal way other walks he took on London nights.
John just shook his head with a half-smirk on his face. Sherlock scowled at him, and John laughed outright.
With a plan in mind, he forced himself to sit up. He glanced over at the table beside his bed and smiled. It appeared Sherlock had left him a gift. Paracetamol and water first, then. John grabbed the two tablets on the nightstand and knocked the back with the help of the glass of water. He finished the water as he pulled on some pajama bottoms and an old RAMC shirt before heading down stairs.
“I’m not trying to make you fall, I’m just trying to get to Right Hand Blue,” Sherlock snarked as he finally finished turning his body, released John’s ankle, and reached an arm between John’s legs for the empty blue circle.
He found the front door to Baker Street unlocked when the car dropped him off and made his way up to the flat. That door was wide open and John walked in.
John closed the flat door, went into the kitchen, and pulled down the bottle of scotch he had on a top shelf. He poured a glass before he went back to the living room and put the DVD into the player. He settled onto the couch and Joy stood with a stretch and a shake before she came to join him. She hopped up onto the couch beside him, circled once, then plopped down with her head in his lap. He scratched her ears.
They made their way down the pavement and walked the five minutes to Angelo’s, which was placed rather conveniently near the address that had been texted from John’s phone earlier. They made their way in and took the table beside the window. Angelo came by, introductions and small talk were made, and then Sherlock turned most of his attention out the window to the front of the building just down the street while John ate.
The shorter man had stopped in the doorway and leaned carefully against the doorframe. Sherlock’s eyes flicked over him in the way he so often tried not to observe his friend. John didn’t necessarily mind his ability to see things, in fact, he often heaped verbal and even physical praise on him when he did, but Sherlock didn’t always like what he saw on his friend. Especially when he had been on one of his many, many dates. What he saw tonight wasn’t a date, though. He had been at the pub, most likely with Lestrade, or perhaps Bill Murray.
John smiled, once again finding himself grateful for his landlady. He had taken her for granted when they had first met, but he knew better now. She was a strong, brave, graceful woman. She didn’t take any shite from anyone. She was caring and loved to dote on Sherlock when he was alive. She had doted on John, too, but he had been too blinded at the time to see it. He saw it now, though, and he was thankful for her steady presence in his life. She got carried away sometimes, sure, but who didn’t? She had stood by him and held his hand, both literally and figuratively, several times since Sherlock fell. He appreciated her and felt guilty for all the times he hadn’t in the past.
It took over two dozen eggs before John was able to recreate the dish to the standard that he had begun to hold himself to, especially when he was going to be sharing the dish.
John sat at his kitchen table, Joy’s head keeping him warm, his thoughts racing and driftless at the same time, as his tea went cold and untouched.
It had been a perfect Christmas. No emergencies, no running after anyone, nothing more troubling than the punch running low before they expected, but luckily, they were well-stocked in good scotch.
“Dr. Watson, I know there is no love lost between us,” Mycroft began after the silence stretched for several minutes and John snorted. “Despite that, I know that we both have at least one thing in common.”
“I’ll be out in a minute,” he said and was surprised at how calm he managed to make his voice come out.
“Indeed we did. He’s up in Rosie’s room as we speak,” Sherlock said with a smile towards Rosie, who nodded vigorously as she grabbed a carrot stick.
How had he missed this? Or did he? Had he somehow known all along without even realizing he knew? Is that why everything was the way it was before John had announced it so clearly? Was this just a confirmation of the information he knew without utilizing it?
“Oh, I hope it wasn’t awkward for John, the poor dear. It can be quite uncomfortable to run into an ex when you aren’t expecting to. But then, I’m sure he liked being able to show you off, dear, as you are quite a catch.”
He couldn’t have said what was in the sandwich other than bread. He tasted nothing as he chewed and stared at the wall across from him.
“Sit. It’s going to get cold if you just stand there staring at me,” he huffed, and John gave a small laugh as he pulled out his chair and sat down. Sherlock put the wine down on the table and sat in his own chair.
“We both care for Sherlock. We want what is best for him. He doesn’t always make the best choices when it comes to that, but he chose to return to London and to Baker Street. He’s going to be needed in the days to come. The threats that rise against us.”
John could now hear Sherlock’s voice coming down the stairs, the sound rising and falling in a simple melody. He couldn’t help the small smile that rose to his lips. This was his favorite part of Rosie’s naptime when Sherlock took point. Rosie always wanted Sherlock to sing her to sleep, and Sherlock always did. John wasn’t always there to hear it, though, as Sherlock often handled nap time while John was on his shift at the clinic. Sherlock often preferred to keep her at the flat when he wasn’t working a case rather than send her to daycare, and John didn’t have the heart to argue that she should be there. So he made as little noise as possible while he finished preparing the cups of tea in order to hear what he could.
“Harry’s your sister. Sister! It’s always something,” he bit off, annoyed at getting something wrong.
John jumped up speedily, not willing to be left behind again if he could help it, and chased after Sherlock.
A few hours later saw him leaving an emergency vet that was open on Saturday’s with a dog that no one had reported missing, wasn’t microchipped (he hadn’t even been aware people put microchips in their dogs these days), and had a sprain that would heal in a couple of days. He had been instructed to make sure she didn’t spend too much time on her feet and to keep her from running if possible. He had left his number in case anyone called to report a missing dog, but they didn’t think it was likely.
“You can just sit there and watch me if you want. Probably won’t take more than an hour,” he said thoughtfully as he considered how few possessions he had.
“They might be a bit long, but they’ll work,” Sherlock proclaimed, but John caught the hint of shyness in his tone.
They fell back into a comfortable silence. After about ten minutes, their taxi pulled up to John’s address, and they climbed out after John tossed him the fare. They made their way up to the bedsit, and Sherlock followed John inside.
As always, thank you for reading! Your support and kudos and kind comments mean the world to me. 💜💜💜
Mrs. Hudson ushered him to the couch in her living room and went back into her kitchen where we heard her bustling about with the kettle and a few minutes later, she made her way back into the room with a tray filled with tea and biscuits. She set the tray down and settled down beside him after pressing a cup into his hands, prepared just as he liked.
There was no milk for his tea, but that was alright. He sat down at the small table in his room and took a moment to just sit and relax. His eyes took in the room, the window with its pulled back curtain, the brick of the wall adjacent to his. He actually felt a bit funny, if he were being honest with himself. Almost like he was having an out of body experience. He was not exactly the type of person who just did things like book a flight and leave the country for no real reason, but here he was, sitting in a rented room in a flat for a week, having done just that.
John had watched carefully as Mrs. Hudson explained each step of the dish she made. How to poach the egg and time it for a perfectly runny yolk, sliced ham, and the sublime revelation that turned out to be a sauce known as hollandaise that turned out to be even more egg yolk perfection.
Sherlock lifted his glass, silver eyes intent on John, and John mimicked his action and lifted his glass. The fairy lights that decorated the windows refracted off the glass, sending shards of light sparking off Sherlock’s face and the hand that held his glass.
John internally sighed as he put his fork down. He should have taken his food to his office rather than stay in the breakroom and be pulled into conversations that he didn’t want to get into with anyone, nevermind someone he hardly knew.
“Sherlock! What are you doing here?” He did grab at his half-open shirt and started hastily redoing the buttons.
He lost himself for a few minutes in the mindless process of making tea, the automatic motions of pulling down a mug, putting in a teabag, pouring the boiling water over the leaves, waiting the four minutes for optimum steeping, tossing the used bag in the rubbish bin, the addition of milk and sugar, the stir of the spoon and the scrape of the metal against the ceramic mug. Grounding, predictable motions.
Actually, he should go for a visit soon. He would see if Mrs. Hudson would like to join him. Perhaps he would leave white lilies for love, with red carnations for heartache, if he could get them from the florist.
“Well, who am I to stand in the way of tradition?” Sherlock groaned and John smiled as he felt Sherlock harden against his stomach. He pressed more kisses down his body as he shifted further down.
He dreamed of shimmering water in a darkened pool and woke with the smell of chlorine still in the air. He dreamed of circus assassins and bomb vests and a man with dead eyes.
When he was finally fully inside him, both of them breathing hard, John stilled to allow him to adjust. John’s breath was hot on his neck where he kissed him. Sherlock’s arms were wrapped tightly around him.
“I’d wish for you to kiss me,” he whispered, surprised at his own breathlessness and boldness at admitting it. “If I could wish for anything, I’d wish for you to kiss me.”
He pulled out the plate and set it on the table behind him before he closed the door. He pulled a glass down from the cabinet and filled it with water from the tap, then he sat down at the table, removed the wrap from his sandwich, and took a bite.
The sound of the rings sliding against the metal rod that held the shower curtain up cut through his thoughts, as did the unexpected gust of colder air. He turned and blinked in shocked surprise as a very naked consulting detective strode into the shower behind him.
He wasn’t sure who said it first. Him or John. It didn’t matter. They pulled just far enough away to look into each other’s eyes. John’s smile was radiant as he looked up at Sherlock, a hand coming up to cup his jaw. Sherlock leaned down as John pushed up slightly onto his toes. Their mouths met somewhere in the middle, a sweet caress of lips and gentle exploration.
His hand shook as he reached out and placed it tentatively on Sherlock’s chest. His friend’s heart was beating wildly beneath his palm, his thumb tracing over the raised edges of the bullet hole there beneath the thin cotton of his shirt.
“It’s fine, Alex. Doesn’t make much of a difference now,” John said, and there was something in his voice that Sherlock couldn’t quite place. He wished he could see his face in order to read him better. Relying simply on his speech patterns wasn’t enough when it came to John. The man revealed so much more with his eyes than his words ever did.
“When you’re loved. Shouldn’t you be told? To know that you’re important to someone?” Sherlock asked. His eyes were on his hands, twisting on themselves in his lap.
John had glanced at Sherlock once during the endless chatter and after nearly biting through his lip to keep from laughing at the expression on his friend’s face, he rolled the window down and watched as they drove past homes and eventually entered the town proper.
“Fifteen. He was my best mate in school. Met when we were 12 and were inseparable. When we were 15 he started going out with this girl, Isabelle, and she was nice enough, I suppose, but I hated her. I kept telling everyone it was because she was taking my friend away and we never got to hang out anymore. Really I was just jealous. She ended up breaking up with him. Some stupid reason that kids break up over for, you know how it is. Anyway. We were in his room after and he was crying about losing the ‘love of his life’, and I just leaned over and kissed him.”
Sherlock sat completely still, stunned, staring at the back of John’s head. Did he really hear him correctly? John wanted a relationship with him? Wanted. Past tense. Did he still?
He went to take a step back, concern in his eyes where lust had just been, but Sherlock pulled him close and refused to let him move.
He was numb. Anger, disbelief, frustration, hurt, relief, rage all simmered under the surface of his skin, but all he felt in that moment was numb.
The kettle flicked off and John poured the hot water over the bags, then went to the refrigerator for the milk. The contents of the fridge were nearly a shock, even though he knew what would be inside as he did most of the shopping. Of course, it wasn’t what was in the fridge that was surprising. It was what wasn’t. There were no tissue samples, no organs, no experiments. Those had all been moved to a small fridge that was kept in Sherlock’s bedroom. He still experimented in the kitchen, but he usually did it during Rosie’s naps or at night now. Just another physical reminder of the changes that have been made, the way Sherlock had changed, to accommodate Rosie and his return to Baker Street.
“I want to spend Christmas with you. I have a couple to make up for, I think,” Sherlock murmured quietly.
John wasn’t entirely sure he was breathing as Sherlock explained the flowers, but he assumed he was as he was still conscious when he had finished.
“I’ve wanted you since the beginning,” Sherlock confessed and John’s eyes widened at the unexpected admission.
Thank you so much for reading! This is the longest fic I've written (so far), and I had a lot of fun writing and sharing it with you all. I appreciate all your comments and kudos more than I can say.
And John would have been amazed, as he always had been, when Sherlock was reading the world around him in a way that no one else did. That no one else ever could.
John shrugged and Sherlock mentally cursed him for not rising to the bait of correcting him. He really was learning Sherlock’s tricks of the trade and he felt a mixture of frustrated pride at his friend’s cleverness. John smirked in response to the scowl Sherlock felt move across his features. Damn.
“I didn’t want people making you uncomfortable, Sherlock.” John’s muffled voice came from behind his hands.
Rosie found the pickle ornament after several encouraging hints from Sherlock and Mrs. Hudson while John went to cook up a full English fit for Christmas morning. The pop and sizzle of bacon and sausages filled the kitchen as he sliced tomatoes and opened a tin of beans to heat on the hob. He filled the kettle with water to make tea and listened to Rosie as she played with her new toys, the excitement of finding the pickle already faded.
They were progressing nicely, his date having already unbuttoned the first few buttons of his shirt when there was a knock on the door.
John closed the curtain and went back under the water. He got his soap and loofah and started to wash his body.
He decided to not mention that he could just walk upstairs and get his pyjamas. He would come back down if Sherlock wanted him to. Instead, he reached for the clothes provided and slipped them on. The bottoms were too long, but the shirt fit surprisingly well. He looked up and saw Sherlock had finished dressing and was back in the loo brushing his teeth. John followed him in there, stood beside him as he readied his toothbrush, and scrubbed his teeth clean. Their eyes kept meeting their reflections in the mirror, and they smiled around their toothbrushes. When they were done and made their way back into Sherlock’s room, John didn’t hesitate but pulled the duvet and sheets back before he climbed right into the large bed. He settled down on his side and watched Sherlock as he got in beside him. They laid down facing each other, and John pulled the bedding up around their bodies, cocooning them in the warmth of the soft cotton, their bodies pressed gently together, and the humidity from the shower being dispersed by the open loo door into the bedroom.
John’s heart broke for his friend, and he wondered, not for the first time, if he was the first person that Sherlock had ever told his stories to.
“Your choice for dinner,” he said as she came back to the door, pulling on her thick winter coat. Letting her choose was the least he could do after all she had done for him. Especially since the smell had strengthened as he stood outside the open door.
When Sherlock had fallen, John grieved like a widower. His life came to a complete standstill and he felt more broken in those early months than he had from his return from Afghanistan. Mary came in and seemed to accept those broken pieces and shoved them back together into something vaguely John Watson shaped through sheer force of will and sellotape. When Sherlock returned, all of those old feelings came rushing back, along with hurt and anger and confusion, and he had lashed out in anger because anger was easier to accept and manage at that moment.
“Oh, that wasn’t going to happen. I told you she’s already claimed you,” Mrs. Hudson proclaimed with a flippant hand gesture.
“Of course, darling. Let’s get you in the bath real quick and then we’ll get ready for bed,” he said as his eyes quickly took in the mud that splattered her entire bottom half and the smudge on her cheek from her hands.
When they arrived back to 221B, John had gone to the kitchen to make tea, and Sherlock had gone to his chair. John could hear the familiar click of keys on a laptop as he poured boiled water over the tea bags and he wondered what Sherlock was looking for.
“It’s fine, I know what you meant,” he said with a gentle squeeze and a smile. “I don’t mind.” He didn’t mind the doting, or that she cared, or that she considered Rosie a grandchild. He would surround Rosie with as many people as he could that would love her the way she deserved to be loved.
“Into battle,” Sherlock threw over his shoulder, and John laughed as he bent to pack away the sandwich wrappers and napkins, the water bottle and the cups they had used, then carefully folded the blanket they had commandeered from Mrs. Hudson after he shook off the bits of flower and grass that stuck to it. He tucked the blanket under his arm and grabbed the basket, also commandeered from Mrs. Hudson, and stood up. He looked over in the direction his friend and daughter had been in and saw them walking back towards him. Sherlock had Rosie propped on his hip and she was giggling excitedly as she stuck dandelions in his hair.
Rosie led the way into the living room, chattering excitedly as she bounced on her toes and then ran up and down the hallway several times with repeated pleas to just move a tiny bit faster to see what Father Christmas left beneath the tree.
He gasped, his mind and body finally coming together to react to this moment. His hands came up and fisted into Sherlock’s shirt as he pulled him closer. He tasted the tea and sugar on Sherlock’s lips, and he wanted more, to taste the sweetness of Sherlock’s mouth. He gently flicked his tongue against Sherlock’s bottom lip to get that taste. Sherlock made a sound in the back of his throat and his lips parted. John pressed up and deepened the kiss, just a bit, just a careful slide of his tongue against Sherlock’s. Both hummed their pleasure at this, then John broke away with a breathless giggle. He felt light, like a boy again, the one he used to be before the world tried to beat him down. Sherlock smiled down at him before he rested his forehead against John’s and he began to giggle as well.
Sherlock and Rosie returned before dinner with five new pieces of glass to show off. John smiled and praised her on her hard work. She smiled proudly and ran off to play somewhere in the house. John turned back to find Sherlock observing the kitchen.
It was one of the pieces Rosie and Sherlock had collected during their visit to the beach that morning. His thumb ran over the cloudy surface in small, unconscious circles while he listened to the sounds of Sherlock putting Rosie to bed. The familiar pattern of requests for tucks and kisses and a song drifted down the stairs. After a few moments, he heard the gentle tune of
Except that he wasn’t just washing dirty dishes. John was standing at the sink, swaying slightly side to side, and Sherlock could tell his eyes were closed as he scrubbed a plate clean. The song had changed from when he had first come in and now that he was closer Sherlock could hear John singing along to the unfamiliar song.
He pulled his head back down and leaned down to kiss Sherlock, his tongue delving inside without preamble as Sherlock’s hand began working on him more purposefully. John’s thighs began to shake from the strain of standing and he let his hands fall to Sherlock’s shoulders and began to push him down onto the mattress. The kiss broke as Sherlock let his hand fall away from John and they both panted heavily at the loss of contact.
John glanced at the mobile, then quickly slipped it back in his pocket. “Yes, yes, sorry. I thought I…” he trailed off again, his eyes going back to the window when he saw a flash of movement. A flash of movement in the shape of a certain consulting detective running in the opposite direction that he was running in a moment ago. What on earth was going on?
Sherlock let his legs fall to the side and pulled himself up. He felt lightheaded, almost dizzy, as he stood up, but the moment passed. From inside the bathroom, he heard John turn the taps on, the groan of the pipes as the hot water worked its way from the furnace through the old building, and into the tub.
He strode into the flat and stopped short at the sight of John standing in the kitchen with his head in the refrigerator, seemingly on the hunt for something to make for dinner judging by the chicken breasts that were already set out on the counter. Why was John back already? He had been relatively certain that lunch would have gone well and that he’d still be out. But then again, perhaps not? Would lunch and then a dinner date be too much for one day? Maybe.
One of the nurses, a new one that John couldn’t seem to ever remember the name of, kept attempting to engage him in conversation and plying him with more of the gin cocktails. He couldn’t help but think she was flirting with him, with the way her eyes kept looking up at him through her long lashes and she kept bringing attention to her mouth by sipping at the dainty straw from her own drink. He smiled and interacted with her whenever she pushed into his space, but he was silently starting to wonder when he could leave without seeming completely rude.
When he was about five minutes from the clinic, he felt a familiar tingle on the back of his neck. Something he hadn’t felt in a long time. He felt like someone was watching him.
Sherlock was slightly surprised when the first few hits were actually the Alexander Campbell he was searching for. It was mostly places where his name was found in conjunction with the clinic or fundraisers. A couple of hospitals had him listed as being able to perform surgery on their premises. There was nothing that Sherlock saw as being helpful to the case, at least right now, but he read through a couple of different sites.
John turned back to his soup and gave it a stir with a wooden spoon, then put a lid on the pot and lowered the temperature. When that was done, he turned back to the kettle and reheated the water, and went about the task of making tea. Sherlock went and cleared a space for the two of them to eat at the kitchen table. He finished just as John set down two cups of tea, and they sat down across from each other.
Sherlock turned his head to look at him, then flipped gracefully onto his back, slipping a pillow under him to prop his hips up.
John turned his attention back to his friend, who was tearing off bits of the bread and dragging it through the tomato sauce on his plate before eating.
“We have more in common than you like to believe. This petty feud between us is childish. People will suffer. You know how it always upset Mummy.”
He walked through the wrought iron gates that marked the entrance to the cemetery, his eyes automatically cataloging the presence of a black car parked on the other side of the street that he quickly ignored because it obviously meant nothing, and made his way towards the black stone that marked his friend’s resting place.
“I understand, John. I’m just asking for forgiveness. I’ll understand if you can’t trust me again, but I am truly sorry,” Sherlock apologized, sincerity clear in his voice.
The song ended and moved into another with a short instrumental opening and when John didn’t let him go, but rather continued to hold him close, Sherlock opened his eyes to look down at the doctor. He recognized the song as the rich voice of Etta James broke out over the speaker.
Rosie shifted between them, and John lifted his hand to brush back the curls from her eyes as she settled into a new position. His hand then reached out tentatively to brush the curls from Sherlock’s eyes, as well. Sherlock leaned into the touch.
Mrs. Hudson snorted, turning away from Sherlock and coming up to John. She patted his cheek with a gentle hand. “I’m going to make tea. I think you’re going to need it.”
“‘We’ don’t need to do anything. ‘We’ aren’t doing anything right now. You are going to talk with her because she deserves more than you ignoring her. You have no idea what she’s been through.”
John stayed calm in the face of it, for the moment, at least. “That’s because I’m not gay,” he reminded him like he would need a reminder, “but it was also because I didn’t want people thinking the wrong things about you.”
His hands went to the waistband of John’s pajamas and without breaking the steadily heated kiss they shared, he reached in and ran a finger up the length of John’s erection through his pants and John’s hips jerked forward, seeking further contact, and Sherlock had never felt so powerful in his life.
“My number is on the website. Never know when someone might recognize it,” he explained, sort of, and John sighed quietly before he stepped closer and handed Sherlock his phone.
Every attempt he had made towards getting a taxi was futile and he kept walking as quickly as he could, his satchel slung over his good shoulder as he tore through the London streets.
“I wasn’t an unbiased party. I didn’t know if I was seeing what I wanted to see or what was really there.”
Sherlock’s eyes opened and his eyes flashed silver in the flames of the fire as he looked at John. Observed John.
He went about cleaning up their dinner and lunch dishes, then went to check that their swimsuits were dry so they would be ready in the morning. When he went back into the sitting room in the front of the house, he picked up the novel he had been working on and settled onto one of the chairs by the empty fireplace. His mind wouldn’t focus on the words in front of him, though. Instead, he found himself listening for Sherlock and Rosie. He shifted, trying to find a more comfortable position in his chair, and felt something sharp poke him from his pocket. He reached in and pulled out a small amber-colored shard of sea glass.
“This is a gift, John. I know it hurts right now, but so few people get true second chances with those they love. It’s okay to be angry, but let it go, and then talk to him.”
John pulled back and looked into Sherlock’s eyes as their giggles slowed down and eventually silenced. He couldn’t have stopped the dopey smile he knew was on his face if he wanted to. Especially when Sherlock looked at him the way he did right at that moment.
“Bites, Watson, if you please,” Sherlock said as he rounded the table across from her and she nodded.
“Left foot green,” he called out, then looked around him to try and figure out the best way to actually get there with Sherlock’s arm between his legs.
“Happy now, sweetheart?” She nodded, and John smiled. “All right, then, no more delaying. Off to nap with you.” He handed her over to Sherlock, who he still couldn’t look in the eye, and watched as they went up the stairs to the room John and her shared. If he was honest, he was getting worried about how fast she was growing. She wouldn’t be able to share a room with him for much longer, and John didn’t want to leave 221B. But what choice would they have when it came time? He supposed he could maybe rent 221C from Mrs. Hudson. It wasn’t ideal, especially with the mold issues and a young child, but they could make it work.
“You went to look at a flat with him this afternoon and now you’re going to crime scenes with him. Might we expect a happy announcement by the end of the week?” the man asked with a sardonic eyebrow raise, and John couldn’t help the flare of anger that he knew passed over his features. He knew he was nothing more than a broken man now, but he didn’t need the fact that someone like him would never be good enough for a man like Sherlock to be thrown in his face.
He licked another broad stoke over him before focusing his attention on Sherlock’s entrance. Sherlock tasted of salt and musk and John felt his cock twitch and leak as he tightened his tongue and circled Sherlock’s rim. He licked and sucked and prodded his tongue, feeling the muscle twitch and loosen under the assault while Sherlock practically mewled into his pillow.
“You’re beautiful,” John said as he grabbed his cock and lined himself up to Sherlock’s entrance. He looked into his eyes as he slowly began to push into him.
John raised a hand to cover one of Sherlock’s as he held his face, turned his head to kiss the warm palm. “I can’t lose you, Sherlock,” he confessed, unable and unwilling to hide the sincerity behind the statement.
Thank you all for following along and reading these 221b chapters! I had a lot of fun writing these fluffy boys at Christmas and I hope you enjoyed them, as well. 💜💜💜
When John was dressed in the provided suit, they made their way into the room, and immediately things started coming together for him. He crossed over to the body, pulling on latex gloves, and he was already taking in the details that he knew that idiot Anderson had missed. He noticed in his periphery that John was standing rather awkwardly, leaning on his cane, while he watched him.
He had just finished reheating one of those meals in the microwave at work (no stickers attached to that one), when one of the nurses came in, sniffing at the air in interest, as he was tucking into the now warm chicken korma he had made the night before.
Sherlock leaned towards him across the table. “John, I…” he started, but Rosie had chosen that moment to run back into the room, and John wasn’t sure if he was grateful for her timing or not.
“It’s a classic, Sherlock,” he replied. “Besides, I know you like this one.” John sat down on the other end of the sofa and leaned back into the soft leather. “Pirates, poison, torture, sword fights. True love. You can’t fool me. You love this movie,” John teased good-naturedly.
The cold air hit his face and he turned down the pavement without a thought in his head beyond getting as far away as he could.
The man’s eyebrows lifted in a flicker of what could only be surprise before it settled back into the mask the man seemed to perpetually wear.
John couldn’t keep up with Sherlock Holmes. Not with his leg and his tremor and his brokenness. He was broken, he knew that, and there was no use denying it to himself.
He is the most beautiful person John has ever seen and John feels like the luckiest man in the world at that moment. They should talk. They need to talk. Before this goes further, they should talk. John needs to know if this is what he hopes it is. The beginning of something more, and not just this once.
