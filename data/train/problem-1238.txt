Sherlock looked at the spread in the magazine, he and Willa on the steps of the Notre Dame Cathedral in skimpy little outfits that were practically blasphemous to the religion of the historic building.  How the designer and magazine got permission, Sherlock did not know, and actually didn’t care.
“I am off to see what I can find out” Mycroft said. Mary just nodded and stared down the corridor of the flat.
"I'm here." A voice said from somewhere in the stands. "I just can't stand right now. Hit my head I'm a little dizzy."
“Battery is dying, stopping the video chat, will call back.” John said “Going to have to put phone in pocket to climb stair case anyway”
Mummy took and deep breath and moved to sit on the edge of his bed. She held his hand tight in hers.
John looked at the food in front of him. He could do this, he could eat it all, and the garlic bread that smelled so good, and drink the wine, maybe not any wine. But he could eat this meal and keep it down. He was going to tell Sherlock the truth about where he had been going on Wednesday night and he was going to get help.
Anthea had even been in theatre longer than her, plating put on her ribs to keep the shifted bones from moving more and causing further damage.
“Had a few run ins with him on base in the month leading up to the ambush. He and his team thought they were pretty important. They botched a mission up near the Pakistan boarder and it killed civilians. So they were to be sent back, dishonorably discharged. Sebastian didn’t take kindly to that so he joined with the militant group. Looking back and knowing what we know now. I believe Moriarty had a hand in that.” John took a deep breath and squeezed Sherlock’s hand.
"OH, he is fit!" Willa smiled, Riley smiled, John blushed. "It's ok. Riley was telling me what was going on. No shame is blowing your train money on a nice dinner. We've all been there. But really two nice army docs like yourselves selling yourselves for a ride home!"
Molly looked around the room, she had never been in a private ICU before and wasn’t even aware that the hospital had one. She wasn’t even sure if she was qualified to be in even a normal ICU, but she guessed on orders from Anthea all were to be kept together under guard.
“So, what does it feel like to know you’re on the losing side,” Moriarty asked in almost a sing-song tone.
John finished his biscuit and put his laptop on the ottoman and retrieved the phone from Sherlock’s pocket. The text preview simply said the text was from W- and it said that Sherlock was in danger.
“It’s the truth” Greg said leaning against the wall at the opening of the elevator as his head started to swim again
“Yes, the youngest, locked up for the crime of being smarter. And perhaps a murder” She smiled the same eldritch smile as before. “Moriarty had such confidence in you. I see it was misplaced.
For as much hate that Jim could project towards others, for all his blowing up old ladies who veered from the script to poisoning children for the fun of it, Jim could be loving, from caring for Sebastian after a recruit turned on them, shooting Sebastian in the leg to cooking amazing dinners for two. Plus he was a beast in bed. That man had stamina that lasted for days.
“My mother, my second mother, was the secretary to one of the most powerful men in the British government, my well at the time friend Mycroft was also powerful. My child hood wild days were never put on record. I was a terrible teenager. I shoplifted more than once, had a few ASBOs in my time. But none ever stuck. I even got arrested once for escaping from police, it where I learned to tuck and roll. I learned to get out of handcuffs, though my hand are bigger now, had to break bones but I’ll heal.”
John had been hesitant at first he hadn’t been fully naked in front of Sherlock before, yes they shared a bed but John was always in his pyjamas. But Sherlock was gentle, this was about getting John clean and settled and ready for bed.
“Why. Isn’t that what you like to do to those who are beneath you? Belittle them, talk down to them, and call them goldfish? You treat others with diminished mental capacity those who are not a clever as you as less than equals” Eurus said. “Granted Wilhelmina has never been tested, she is the recipient of a major head injury with traumatic brain injury as a young developing child. So she is more diminished than I.”
Greg like the rain, he found it peaceful, calming. Well as peaceful and calm as one could get in the bustling city. But in the country side, sitting on a porch with the rain, some good music and a lager, that was heaven.
“Yes. I thought I was losing my natural high after the wedding. As for the plane, well I thought I was never going to see you again so I planned to overdose. And I am ever glad I didn’t” Sherlock gave a small smile.
“When I was five years old I had a dog, a beautiful red Irish Setter. I called him Redbeard. He was the first mate to my Pirate Captain Yellow Beard. We had many adventures together. He was my best friend. He am my little sister, Wilhelmina, we called her Willa. She was two years younger than me. Redbeard was used to playing with me, he wasn’t use to playing with Willa. He didn’t understand that her smaller stature meant that she couldn’t play the same way he and I played. He didn’t mean to hurt her. He was just excited to greet her after he nap. She fell down the stairs. Hit her head on the way down. She was dead before my mother found her, Redbeard sitting beside her. Redbeard had to go. The city deemed him a dangerous dog. So in one week I lost my precious little sister and I lost my best friend.” Sherlock stopped and sipped his tea more.
Never would, Andrew and Elizabeth were too close to their father. Not that Greg was boastful about that or had done anything overly special. He just made sure he was there for them. No matter what, school function or sports event, didn’t matter how bad work was he always tried to make it there on time, or close too. He’d missed a few, but compared to their mother who was never there, it made a difference.
Greg groaned as he rolled onto his back, he had passed out after pulling himself out of the elevator, he’d hit the floor hard his head that had only had a slight throbbing pain was now pounding. He tried to get up but his leg was not cooperating. His hip refused to move and pain radiated though him when he tried to bend his knee.
There was movement on the catwalk and a man peered over as he knelt. His brown greying hair was sticking up at weird angles as if he'd just ran his hand through it.
“Yeah. Seb will be leaving for his little journey in the morning. Private plane private airfield, no passport needed. When he goes to try and head to London though he’ll notice it’s not in his gear” Jimmy said laying the passport on Irene’s desk along with the envelopes.
They wove a good story about how some other private firm was trying to do a frame up on them. The Wilshire just stared at them blank-faced as they spoke. He then held up his hand to stop them.
“You do know it’s lunchtime right?” Janice asked with a smile. “But I mean we do have the day off so if you want to lounge about that’s fine, you two deserve all the sleep you can get.”
Greg learned to bake from his mum and grandmother. They said it was a skill all men should have, no better way to woo a lover then with a fresh baked treat.
Sherlock jolted away by the screams tried to sit up only to have Daddy place a reassuring hand on his chest as Mummy went and sat on the bed next to John.
Eurus sat in her cell, she watched as the doors leading in opened. She gave a small smile as he neared the glass wall of the cell.
Seemed Irene would never give up either. Records of the hotel computers searches showed she still kept a keen eye on Sherlock. That she had texted him a few times over the years as well. Mostly a Happy Birthday or an I know you aren’t dead what are you up to text.
“I am going to see if I can move any of the debris blocking to doorway or see if I can get a line out” she said standing.
Sherlock jolted awake as the crash echoed in the quiet flat. He looked to his left only to see the spot where John slept empty. Sherlock hurried out of bed and out into the living area.
“You know I can’t wait till tonight. That little inn, the honeymoon suite, all my strength and stamina back” Greg nipped at Mycroft’s neck.
He leaned down and nipped at Sebastian’s neck before biting down hard on the former marine’s collar bone.
“Oh the DCI is awake, Hello Gregory. I can’t believe my brother finally found a goldfish he wanted to keep.” Eurus gave an eerie smile. “Sherlock and Mycroft are safe, for now.”
“Sherlock I think you should rest.” John said standing. “You have a lot in your system and you need to take it easy.”
“That would be a viable solution but the murder scene, the bodies laid out just so, the splatter everywhere.” Sherlock mused
Willa’s wrists had healed nicely and she was back playing with the symphony. Ashton had proposed to her after her first concert back.
“Sir, there has been some movement in 221. We have watched no one has come out and per your orders we have not gone in.” The man said
“There is one more thing, and I really wish I could tell you but I can’t. years ago maybe but now it has become a matter of the government. But I can reassure you that it is contained and that nothing will come from it” Mycroft replied taking Greg’s hand in his.
Judy real name Eurus Holmes tossed her wig into the back on top of “Karen’s” clothes. She strapped The sleeping child into the car seat and got into the drivers seat. The drive back to the house was not long. 44 Eaton Square, The previous owner was well still the owner.
Sherlock carefully felt the metal slats, they were not that thick. He couldn’t’ bend them but maybe if they could find bolt cutters they could free him.
“Just a little knock on the head and a few bruises I’ll be fine.” John said looking around. There was lots of debris on the stairs. The blast had torn through part of the stair case leading up to 221b.
Ashton left to visit his family in France a week ago. He had checked in with Willa when he got there but not since. Not unusual, their relationship did not need constant monitoring. It was early stages, dates but no cohabitation yet. He did check with her before coming back, she didn’t respond but he figured she was already at the hall getting ready for the practice. He went straight from the train station to rehearsal. He text her and got no response so after a mandatory dinner meeting with the conductor he headed to her flat.
"Deep breath," Willa said Sherlock inhaled and as Willa pressed he slowly let out the air holding in a scream as the bones moved back into place.
Riley was still in one of the operation theatres working on the last of less injured who had been left to wait, not that it was fun waiting with a broken arm. John couldn’t help but think of how many had died simply because the doctors just couldn’t go any faster, how many died while waiting.
“He has dealt with PTSD.” Sherlock answered. “He was injured in Afghanistan six years ago. It went untreated for a while but he was doing well till the explosions four months ago.”
“Give me the photos again” Sherlock said disposing of the blood and washing his hands. Since the arrival of Rosie, he was a little more careful with how he handled the hazardous materials at home. John handed him the crime scene photos. Sherlock began to look them over.
Willa and John just remained where they were, Irene struggling to breathe on one side of them, and Greg moaning in pain on the other. Both wanted to help but were too fearful to do anything more.
“It is nice to have someone else here to spoil” Tabitha replied. “When you are done, just leave it here, you don’t have to bring it back”
Mycroft did up his seatbelt and looked out the window. There was no place like London. Once upon a time, when he was younger Mycroft may have agreed with Sweeney Todd that There's a hole in the world like a great black pit and it's filled with people who are filled with shit, And the vermin of the world inhabit it. But now that veil of loneliness and bitterness was lifted. And he saw London for what it truly was. It was a bright shining star, a cultural melting pot. Some would want to see that fall but London was a progressive town, it always had been from its first settlement as Londinium in 43 AD by the Romans. Mycroft turned and looked at Greg. Greg didn’t like landings, or take offs, but he was doing well.
Sherrinford was no fun at first. She spent all her time in her cell reading and playing her violin. Until just after her 25
The shouts from the crowds were near deafening, People calling for Sherlock, wanting a picture of him or a picture with him, even an autograph. The cheers only intensified as his twin sister Willa stepped out of the limo and on to the tarmac of the private but unfortunately not secluded airport just east of Paris. The Holmes Twins were on their second European tour. Berlin, Lisbon, Madrid, Milan, and Paris, leading up to the high fashion twins walk in the London Fashion Week. (Bumped back to CLOSING the month of the major fashion weeks due to security concerns). They were part of the headlining show for the newest hottest designer, Marisol Wright. Her Rock On collection inspired by her rock star husband was perfectly suited for the gender-bending twins.
Sherlock smiled as he entered the flat life had been going along nicely. Another case closed and he was looking forward to the quite night in with John and Rosie. My how she’d grown, She’d be two soon, and was quick to tell everyone she was getting a princess tea party in the palace. Mycroft was being super secretive but Sherlock was quite certain that one of the real royals would be there, Mycroft did like to spoil all of the new Holmes generation. Elijah was even enrolled in the same preschool as the royals, Rosie certainly wanted for nothing, Brianna Holmes- Everett already had a rather large education fund already started, and even young Charles Alexander Wellington-McTavish was spoiled.
The guard dragged Victor out and down to the solitary confinement area known as the pit. Eurus slowly walked down towards the hall towards the room that now held the unconscious Sherlock, Mycroft and Willa. When she entered she looked over them. How easy it would be to just kill them now. But where was the fun in that.
Mycroft sighed, He couldn’t tell Greg the full truth he couldn’t know about Eurus, no one could she was better locked away forgotten by the world in Sherrinford.
The others had long since gone home. Sherlock just couldn’t help but smile. They had gone through so much but now life was steady, and Sherlock felt settled and safe, Baker Street had always been his house, a comfort zone, but now with John and Rosie, it finally felt like a home.
“The victims had a black light as the main light source in the living area.” Sherlock answered “Could they have injected themselves with Luminol prior to being murdered?”
Greg sighed and leaned on the wall, he could hear Mycroft talking, Hindi if Greg wasn’t mistaken, he had heard Myc speak it before while ordering at a small Indian restaurant they had went to on a date.
Irene looked back out over the water. The rain was in no hurry to let up and go away. She hoped it would soon. The calendar on the wall said it was Friday. Saturday was the wedding Greg and Mycroft becoming one in marriage. Singing, dancing, and festivities no one there had any idea of what was coming.
He would tell Sherlock the truth, he would tell him everything, he knew Sherlock’s past, the education, the drug use the abuse at the hands of his dealer, how he met Greg Lestrade, his relationship with Mycroft, his relationship with his parents. Sherlock knew nothing of John’s past before the war, well before he got shot in the war. He knew about Harry but he didn’t know anything else. Then again maybe he did, maybe he deduced it. No he would have told John. Sherlock liked fact checking his deductions with people.
“Yet she didn’t know about Moriarty and Moran?” John asked. Mycroft looked down. “She did didn’t she?”
To his right was his little sister, the first bullet had hit her lower leg shattering her fibula and coming to rest in the tibia. There were now rods and pins holding that together.  The second bullet fractured her collarbone, as well as her first and second rib, causing her lung to collapse. There was also muscle damage, and fragments of the bullet had cut up her esophagus and larynx which warranted a tracheotomy. Mycroft had been told that it would be temporary only for her to heal.
John was next to Sherlock. He’d been on the operating table for quite a long time. He’d been bleeding internally for some time his liver, spleen, and gallbladder had all been damaged. He no longer had his spleen or gallbladder and only had about half his liver left.
The door of Irene’s room opened and the inmates came and Marco and Fredrick led John and Willa away while Denny carried Greg over his shoulder.
“Nonsense, you look amazing.” Jim said stepping forward. He put his hand up to Sebastian’s face and gently caressed it before grabbing the back of Sebastian’s neck and pulling him in tight for a kiss.
“Oh I can defiantly go for that” Greg said kissing him “But what should I do with you for this hour and a half ride back to London”
“You’ve seen me before. Standing in the gallery of the courthouse, watching the farce of trial you made my sweet Jimmy through.
Marisol was crying, Willa's leg was throbbing, she looked to see the blood on her leg, the bullet hole just above her ankle.
John and Sherlock could barely make it through dinner always pausing to kiss when glasses were clanked; Greg and Elijah leading the charge along with Molly, Willa, and Mrs. Hudson.
“Save that photo I want it printed and put on the mantle” Sherlock chuckled as he turned back to the microscope. “The blood found at the crime scene was glowing, even before the forensic team went to spray luminol.”
“Nonsense, no such thing.” Sherlock smiled “But if you would like we can burn some sage or call in an exorcist”
Mycroft hadn’t been too keen on Greg going back to work in the first place, he thought it was too soon, yes Greg had been medically cleared to work and the MET had been rebuilt but to step into that office to ride those elevators what would that do to Greg’s heart and mind? Mycroft was worried about Greg mentally and emotionally. It caused much fighting between the two of them Mycroft didn’t think that a person could work while struggling through guilt and grief. As much as Mycroft had warmed and the Iceman melted he still struggled with emotions and showing them. Mycroft felt he’d shown too much in the hospital with breaking down about almost losing Grey and the warm tender proposal. Not to say that Mycroft wasn’t loving and caring just for so long he had to keep it all happen keep it tucked away caring was not an advantage. How they even wound up together now engaged still could baffle some.
At the end of the street he could see two of the large garbage trucks; they were parked along bend where Baker Street became Park road. Two more were parked blocking where Baker Street met Allsop Place. Each barricade also had some tank stoppers in front, a glance the other way saw that Baker Street was barricaded at Malcolmbe. Each barricade had several what looked like soldiers armed with guns. Anyone trying to get near them was gathered into a holding area off to the side.
“How well do you remember our case you so kindly named the Blind Banker?” Sherlock asked digging through a desk drawer.
Molly stopped talking an bit her lip, there she was again spouting off at the mouth making things worse.
John sat in his chair looking across the ottoman at Sherlock. Mrs. Hudson had agreed to take Rosie for the day. She also made them tea and sandwiches and other assorted snacks for their talk.
“If you want to save him yes. Solve the riddles and he lives. Remember don’t get too fancy don’t get too complicated.” Eurus answered. “Let’s start with an easy one. What is harder to catch the faster you run?”
Angelo was over the moon. Had been telling everyone how he had been the one to give them the first little nudge with the candle on the table during their first dinner there.
Sherlock had been a little shocked at first to see how much his big brother doted on his fiancé. Mycroft’s proposal had been very sweet, or so John had said so, Mycroft asked him the day he brought Greg home.
It does represent Greg and Mycroft who will be together forever. They have weathered the storms and will hold strong together from now on.
“I don’t remember the funeral. I only remember the time after it, the loneliness. Mycroft was different too. He no longer wanted to play. He started calling himself the smarter one. Constantly put me down. When I would step out of line he would just whisper Redbeard, and soon I just stopped playing with him. Mycroft was the first to go away to boarding school. Left when he was 14. By the time I reached Eaton, Mycroft was in Oxford, and we talked only at Holidays. By the time I reached Cambridge we never talked. He would pop round occasionally, to gloat about his position with the government. Meanwhile I was trying to figure out my place in the world. You know about myself as a child trying to solve the Carl Powers murder. I didn’t know how to use this deduction thing as people called it, without angering people. I didn’t know how to turn it off. Until I met Victor. Victor seemed to be the only person who understood me. That need for action, to solve things, to well to be me. He was the one who first injected me with cocaine. It settled me. I didn’t need the thrill of the chase, the action of the case. Cocaine got my blood pumping and my heart racing in the same way. And all within the comfort of Victors flat. Mum, Dad, and I think even Mycroft thought I would take my chemistry degree to the PHD level. Work in a lab, criminalistics, or teach.” Sherlock chuckled. “Could you imagine me a professor or a teacher”
“But you do!” Greg said sitting on the edge of the desk. “The Mycroft I saw sitting beside his brothers bed in the hospital, holding his slightly less injured hand and telling him that he was there for him and would get him all the help he needed. The Mycroft I met at the Roadhouse, downing shots and shooting billiards while singing along to Eric Clapton, The Yardbirds and the Rolling Stones. I’m not saying you have to do all that in public, but please especially now, I need that Mycroft in my life”
“This as you know is Irene Adler. Now isn’t she supposed to be dead?” Eurus gave a chuckle “She could have stayed hidden the world would have never know she was still alive. But no, she had to call to try and tip you off to Moran’s plan. She hides a deep dark secret. She is the mother to the heir of the Moriarty criminal empire. Now don’t worry. Her son is safe.”
The Iceman’s hear was finally melting. Mycroft had always been so weary of letting anyone close, Sherlock was the same but not to the extent of Mycroft. It was nice to see that he was softening.
John stood and walked with his patient to the hospital. This young Corporal was going to be in for a bit of discomfort as John was going to need to remove all the little bits of shrapnel in his leg.
“Well then no pictures no more getting any help for anything from me.’ Eurus turned and headed back towards her bed. “How about one, a small picture, to keep on my wall.”
“Whose life is worth more to you, the woman whom holds a special place in your brother’s heart, or your lover?” Victor said before making a ticking noise with his tongue.
A second government operative and a paramedic came to stand before him as the landlady and baby were led out.
John headed back to the sitting area. He asked Mary if she would prefer to move up to the second bedroom. She just shook her head and yawned. John quietly hummed as Mrs. Hudson entered with the tea tray.
John was still asleep they said he would be for a while with the medication. The bullet had entered through his 6th rib, skimmed along his lung and though his diaphragm and liver, ricocheting of the 7th rib in the front and coming to rest in the 8th rib at his side. He’d been in surgery a while. Repair work was done to his diaphragm and liver. Sherlock was grateful they were able to save what was left of his liver from the attack by Moran.
“Don’t force yourself to stay if you feel overwhelmed.” Sherlock said “Diane said you could leave at any time, so don’t feel obligated to stay if it’s making things worse”
Sherlock flopped himself down on the couch of the private plane. While he enjoyed his work he hated the spectacle of it all, the people in his face and the constant screaming of the fans, the shrill voices of the women especially annoyed him when they threw themselves at him.
John was starting to struggle more now. His feet no longer could touch the bottom of the well and he was starting to float.
The building or rather what was left of it, that housed the pathology unit of St. Bart’s came into view.
Rosie giggled, the butterfly that had landed on her arm was tickling her. Sherlock smiled, her laugh made the worries of the world nearly melt away.
“Yes.” Josie continued “Could you imagine what would have happened if Sherlock Holmes and John Watson hadn’t been there to stop him”
“Hello Molly, you look very nice today” Brodie said with a large smile, but a quiet calm voice that one would not expect from a man with a brawny Scottish highlander physique as he possessed.
He moved his hand from his side and placed it on her shoulder as he pulled down on her arm where he was now grasping her above the elbow.
“Now Sherlock. Listen closely. I only need two of you for my next little test but I don’t think it is my place to choose, so go to the hatch, retrieve the gun, and shoot one of our siblings. Shoot either Mycroft or Wilhelmina.” Eurus instructed.
“But she does, now she does, it’s amazing what techniques exist to unlock memories even from someone who was so young when they lost them.” Eurus gave an evil smile. “Now she has to deal with knowing that They all thought she was dead. Uncle Rudy always did think he was doing the right thing when really he was making it worse. You see. She now knows that I pushed her down the stairs. And she knows why. I hated her. Sherlock always wanted to play with her and that stupid dog. So I pushed her. Oh you should have seen the blood. She was in the hospital for weeks. During that time did Sherlock spend any of it with me? No he and that stupid dog made cards to take to Willa. So the dog had to go.”
“Oh ok” Greg said looking back at the folder “Late night crepe station, late night cheese board of cheese tower, late night nachos. After all that food earlier having all that seems overkill”
John sort of figured it was another reason why he and Riley didn’t publicly show their relationship on base. It almost felt like they were rubbing it in the Majors faces. Most of the camp knew there was something between the two doctors, but no one said anything. It didn’t matter to anyone. The men did their job, and that was all that mattered.
Sherlock woke. His head felt fuzzy, no doubt from the tranquilizer dart that entered the back of his head. His head also felt heavy. There was an odd sensation of cold metal on his cheeks, as he opened his eyes even in the dim light he could tell there was something over his face, metal slats sitting on either side of his eyes just brushing his lashes at the corners.
“He wouldn’t have stopped Moriarty or Magnusson, He wouldn’t have met you, and he wouldn’t be the wonderful caring papa to Rosie. The actions of the past cannot be changed. Mycroft is trying to better himself to make up for all he did in the past.” Anthea said moving to stand by John.
Mycroft just looked at her like a lost child. The head injury was getting to him and now with his leg bleeding more it would lead to high blood loss.
“Well, it seems these guys worked out of a base near Kabul where Kerns and Dewitt were stationed on their last tour. Supplied when missing and a majority of the base blamed these guys, said they sell it on the black market. But no proof could be found, and it didn’t matter anyway they were long gone.” One of the nurses, Janice, said from John’s other side. “These guys said their names are Moran and Moriarty, but Kerns said they were going by Wallace and Shaw in Kabul.”
“Like what. From the age of 5 Sherlock believed that his dog killed his baby sister whom he loved dearly. He in turn blamed himself for her death, and for Redbeard needing to be put down. He became a drug addict, involved with Victor Trevor. Nearly died multiple times and was beaten senseless by Victor. He was so casual with his life because he didn’t think he was worth living, even after he met me even after Reichenbach even after Mary shot him. He put others first because he thought he was unworthy to live all because of Eurus, because of her actions. If he had been allowed to remember, process it, then he wouldn’t have gone through hell and back more than once.” John ranted.
Irene turned and watched as Elijah cheerfully played with the action figures he had been given. Their captor was a cruel woman but she had been taking good care of Elijah, no doubt just wanting to keep him happy till he fulfilled his role within her plan. They were all here to be her toys.
Greg reached over with his free hand and gently touched the bruise on Mycroft’s head that was finally starting to fade.
John headed down to the tube platform with a smile on his face. Thoughts of Sherlock two nights ago at a crime scene Rosie in the snuggly cooing and giggling away as Sherlock waltzed around the crime scene making his deductions. Sherlock was of course showing off. There were several new officers moved to the division and there was a new Detective Sargent, a Devon McLaughlin. He just stood and stared in awe as Sherlock showed off. Even Dimmock had to laugh.
Willa looked at Marisol and the two hurried over and hugged him gently. He furrowed his brow but allowed it.
The weather outside was perfect not a cloud in the sky, and it wasn’t supposed to change anytime soon. The guests were gathered in the garden. The chairs were under the shade with a spectacular view of the surroundings.
“Don’t worry Irene he is fine, just gave him a bit too much made him sleep. He’ll be fine” Eurus said laying the child on the bed.
John stared at his hands as he poured his heart out to the woman in front of him, Diane. It was the first time he had been able to fully open up to anyone in the four months that had passed since he and the others had come under attack. And this was still jus the top of the pile, there was so much more, stuff he hadn’t thought about in years. His father, his childhood, the war, and his first real love Captain Riley Sutter, a fellow doctor in the British Army, the 3
Mycroft tried but he just couldn’t hold back the smile as John and Sherlock entered the restaurant to loud applause and shouts of joy. His little brother had finally taken a step that Mycroft never thought he would. He was now officially a married man. Not only that but he was a family man. Mycroft’s wedding gift to the happy couple was the new official adoption papers for Rosie. She was now officially Sherlock’s daughter. It was encased in a memory book Anthea had helped him get made. In it were pictures of Mary so that she would never be forgotten, along with pictures of Rosie with John and Sherlock. There was plenty of space to add photos as the years went on.
The middle TV changed to show Sherlock and Mycroft were also just waking, they were in a room together but were not tied up.
Sherlock returned to the bedroom and put on his slippers. John was sweeping up the glass into the dustpan.
“We can bring by some clean clothes for both of you tomorrow and more of Rosie’s bottles.” Mycroft said
The heat of a warm Kobuleti, Adjara, Georgia sunset brushed over the face of the former ex-royal military man. He lounged his 6 foot frame on the cabana bed, his 174lb athletic frame clothed only in the small black speedo. Napping next to him on the bed was the love of his life.
“Thank you” She said taking her son from Sherlock, She held her son close then turning and hugging Sherlock. “Thank you so much. I know, I know he should be in a stroller but I don’t have one and he just loves to run”
“There’re not a lot of room on those, we’ll follow behind.” the medic said getting Sherlock to lay on a stretcher.
“Mycroft won’t like that. Even with sunscreen he’s going to freckle, always has and always will. It’s why he hides indoors so much” Sherlock laughed. “I do hope he or Gavin don’t burn, would hate for their honeymoon to be ruined”
“I think we should go away. But we also need to go to Wells. There is someone we need to visit. Someone who was very close to John” Sherlock said quietly
“No he bakes, wonderful delicious cakes and pies and tarts” Mycroft looked longingly out the window “If he stayed at home I would put on seven stone in a month.” Mycroft gave small smile “Best keep the hobbies till the weekend”
“There was a man here, speaking in another language, said something about Sherlock and the Met” Molly said as a paramedic got his gear ready
Greg’s fingers started to twitch; Mycroft raised Greg’s hand to his lips and gave his fingers a gentle kiss.
Mycroft took a log drink of the lemonade. It was then he noticed why Albert was told not to let Andrew have any. The gin gave the lemonade a nice bite.
Greg thought back to those years ago when he first met Mycroft. He’d known Mycroft as long as long as he’d known Sherlock. Mycroft was the one that Greg called when he found an almost overdosed and severely beaten Sherlock in his tiny little bed sit, left there by his controlling abusive dealer. When Mycroft arrived at the hospital he was almost as a mess as Sherlock, not beat up not drugged out but emotionally. That was Sherlock second overdose by his fourth that panic and emotional response from Mycroft was gone. You couldn’t call him stoic cautious or reserved he was just plain unfeeling not uncaring that’s different he still cared what happened to Sherlock he just didn’t let himself feel anything really.
“Thank you.” Lestrade said heading to the door “And thank you for the flat. Remember, don’t rush through those cases.”
“Just leave him John it will be fine till the paramedics get here” Mary said, there was pain in her voice.
“J, John?” He managed to mumble out from behind the bridle asked reaching down to see if he was breathing.
Sherlock wasn't here. He's been high at the fitting but he nailed his practice. He couldn't miss the show.
“Mycroft is not my boyfriend, and he doesn’t tell me anything” Greg replied “Please, she isn’t part of this just let her be”
“Well in that case, I say we stop at Baskin Robbins on the way home and get some ice cream. We can pick up some Rum Raisin for Mrs. Hudson to have with her medicinal brownies” Sherlock smiled as they started to head home
“Mike where are you.” Sherlock asked as Anderson’s eyes went wide at the realization of what was happening.
“Now” Greg said moving closer to Mycroft. “Doesn’t that feel better to get that all out in the open?”
“I, I don’t know if I can be who you want or need right now” Mycroft said eyes turning red but still they refused to tear up more.
“I knew you wouldn’t be gone long” She said giving him another hug “I’ll put some tea on” She said headed to her flat as the others headed upstairs.
“And Wilhelmina how is our darling little Wilhelmina. A little bird told me she had a bit of a break down. Quite sad really, all that fame and responsibility and what does she do? She freezes.” Eurus smiled “I read about that in the paper to dear brother.”
John put the phone in his trouser pocket and studied the staircase in front of him. The bottom stair was gone; the one above it was only partially there. The rest were in various states of damage. John grabbed the railing that seemed to be mostly intact and pulled himself up onto the third step. He swayed as pain shot through his head, stomach and his shoulder.
“She lives downstairs, my guess is she is dead too, elderly lady surviving a blast like that is highly unlikely” John said pushing himself to a standing position.
Karen hugged him. Her tall stature meant his head rested on her chest. Karen reached up and put her hand on his back.
John lay on the kitchen floor, the world around him spinning, in a fair fight he may have been able to hold out longer against an opponent such as Sebastian but not today.
Greg still felt bad for bringing it home with him, but wasn’t like Mycroft didn’t bring work home with him he did all the time in fact tonight he was currently sitting in his home office on a conference call with the United States something about a lead from Moran to an organization there. The MET even had put together special task force looking into everything that had gone on with Moran. There had to still be some more links and loose ends out there. Moriarty’s network had been big, but not that big and not that well-funded not without links to some criminal organization or another and no such link could be found tied to this latest attack.
“Mycroft, I give you this ring as a symbol of my love for you. Let it be a reminder that I am always by your side and that I will always be a faithful partner to you." Greg said sliding the ring onto Mycroft’s finger.
“Sherlock didn’t kill Moriarty, He blew his own brains out on the roof of St. Bart’s before Sherlock jumped” Greg replied
“Please don’t go Greg.” Mycroft quietly said through tears that were now streaming down his face. “I, I can’t lose you. I love you Greg. Please help me become the man I can be”
John had turned and threw up, blood now running from the side of his mouth confirmed his worst fear, he was bleeding internally, probably had been since the initial explosion, then the last blow from Sebastian made it worse.
"They are merely bruised, I ran here. I, I ran away." Sherlock said, "I called Mycroft, he send he would send someone."
Sherlock stood in front of the screen, he glanced beside him, Mycroft stood in front of the other TV just watching Greg as he tried to free himself from the chair.
Molly teared up, all this death all this destruction all from the anger of one man and all born from revenge. She knew revenge could be a powerful thing but this, this was beyond comprehension.
Sherlock looked down at the sleeping Rosie and over at John. His head and stomach hurt but he was not going to give in. He was not going to throw this all away.
“Good Moring. Breakfast in bed just like you asked for Mr. Holmes” Tabitha smiled as they set the trays on the small table between the chairs at the window. “Oh sorry, did you forget” She smiled knowingly. “I’ll just leave that here. Remember your car is at nine”
“How about Rosamund Alice, your name and my grandmothers” John said still cradling his new born daughter in his arms
“Well you aren’t the dumbest person in the building but you are the dumbest in the family” Eurus stated.
He woke. No, no he couldn’t’ have these thoughts. He may be getting a divorce, he may have liked her the first time she appeared in the magazines, but now was not the time for thinking about stuff like that, no was for focusing on the kids.
John’s mind started to race, this was it, and this was how it was going to end, separated, tortured, and alone.
“To Greg, The best and the brightest, not only in Scotland Yard but in London” John said raising his glass.
“Willa is gone. She’s moved to America and has severed all ties with Ashton and I. The specialist I talked to said she had a professional break down caused by stress. That we are to leave it and she will reach out when ready.” Mycroft replied finishing his drink and pouring another.
“A burrowing explosive, comes in handy, but the ground shaking seems to be a giveaway” Anthea replied as she started moving some of the smaller debris chunks
“If you don’t be a big girl and do as you are told, I will send Victor over to Ashton’s and make sure his death is prolonged and painful.” Eurus replied.
Molly took off her blindfold and looked around the empty dance floor slightly confused. She turned and saw Brodie.
“Guess I gave you a little too much medication in your juice. Sleeping already.” Judy said as she pushed the stroller towards the street. “All that work to redo my make-up and John wouldn’t have even been aware if I had still been Karen and looking him in the eye.”
“Remember when I said I was this way because of something I would rather not discuss?” Mycroft asked as he pulled a coat from the closet.
Modeling didn’t do that for him, well not anymore, at first he loved it the travel, learning new things, but soon he started to hate it. He was just a living mannequin for people to dress up. No one cared for him. Sure there were fans, but no one really loved him for anything other than his body.
One of his men approached, they said the outlook inside didn’t look good. Sebastian nodded and followed.
“Could their main dealer be trying to get rid of them, lacing a drug of choice with the luminol to kill them from within?” John asked.
The plane circled around and landed, the three rushed aboard to see Sherlock there. John looked closely, he had been crying, or at least on the verge of tears. His phone was next to him, Mary said he was reading John’s blog, about how they first met.
Mycroft had many new subject to talk about at social events. Parasailing and tubing with Greg at the Disney watersports center, watching Greg learn how to waterski, the over friendly otter that climbed on board his jet ski as they did a guided tour of Bay Lake and Seven Seas Lagoon.
“Oh, if you don’t do this I won’t kill you. I’ll kill someone else, maybe John, or Greg, maybe Ashton.” Eurus said coldly.
“Your fiancé.” She replied “I am allowed a newspaper now and again. And what do I see listed in one this week. I saw an engagement announcement placed by Mummy and Daddy Holmes congratulating their son Christopher Mycroft Emil Holmes on his engagement to Gregory Alexander Lestrade. So will you hyphenating or will it be Mycroft Lestrade, or Gregory Holmes. Detective Chief Inspector Holmes. Hearing that some officers will cower thinking it’s our dear Sherlock. How is our little brother?”
“In a minute the hatch will open. Sherlock, Mycroft I want you to pick someone from this lovely group to retrieve what is in the hatch” Eurus said.
“No not quite as spectacular or glamour and movie worthy as that” Mycroft allowed himself a small smile. “It is smoothing dangerous but I assure you it is well contained far away from us.”
All the single and just dating people were called out onto the dance floor and were instructed to put on the provided paper blindfolds from the children’s party section of the pound store.
“Sherlock’s not normal” Eurus replied “None of the Holmes’s are normal. You’re going to be a Holmes and you are not normal. The Doctor injured and sent home from war, the man who missed the action and the danger. You’re a thrill seeker. Forged by your upbringing, it forced you into needing that adrenaline.”
“Why are you doing this?” Sherlock asked as he starred at the monitor in front of him, he couldn’t take his eyes off the lifeless body of Henry Knight.
He kissed Sherlock and Rosie’s foreheads before setting the pot down on the night stand and cuddling in with the two.
“You are very welcome. You are going to enjoy married life, I know it’s done wonders for me, being with the right person and you are going to be so happy.” Greg replied as Mycroft approached.
Willa stumbled into the room. Sherlock and Mycroft were standing by the monitors watching John and Anthea in the infirmary. The turned and looked as the door closed. The woman stood timidly still by the door looking at the floor. The shock collar was gone, large red welts marred her skin from where the collar had made contact.
“That’s, that’s not all.” Sherlock said. He closed his eyes and entered his mind palace. “There’s something else you aren’t saying.”
Molly was still close to her own parents and made a mental note that she would have to introduce them to the Holmes’s. They would get along famously.
“I am sick of your lies and hiding things from me Mycroft. I have been 100% honest with you about everything and now I find that you have a sister who was signed into adoption after an accident. That you tried to erase all traces of her from the Holmes line, you were denied the authorization of course. But now, You look after her. This is her place. Dora Wilhelmina Anne Holmes became Wilhelmina Anne Masterson on February 19
Greg sat in the hall of the hospital. His jacket, shirt, and pants in the laundry bag by his feet, the loaned scrub top and pants were a little bulky but the only one they had available at the time.
How could he have been so stupid? How could he have ignored her? He studied the woman in front of him, the breathlessness, the labored breathing, and the weakness. Whatever was impaling her under her arm, the pushing of labour shifted it and it had hit her lung, she may have been fine had he treated her first, but now, the pushing, the shifting it was killing her.
John agreed, but he didn’t like being fussed over and had snapped at Sherlock and Mrs. Hudson a few times. They had just smiled and kissed his forehead.
“How are we going to get you to stop chewing for pictures?” John smiled as they entered the small foyer of the to wait for the guests to head to cocktail hour so pictures could be taken
“She won’t win,” Sherlock said not looking up from the file. “You and your kids will be happy. If you are still looking for a flat for the three of you, there’s one in Westminster, close to your place of work.”
“Little shaken but fine dear” She said as he helped her sit. She studied the pile of ash and wall in front of them “oh dear” was all she could manage to say.
“Just take a deep breath in honey, then let it out” She rubbed his check as he did “I know it’s a lot to take in. Deep breathe sweetheart. There we go”
“Well, I know an excellent Lawyer, the daughter of the man who represented me. She will help.” Carols said pulling Greg into a hug.
“I can’t say much but I know there was a planned attack on Parliament” John said “Rest is still very hush hush.”
“Well there were explosion at the Met, and Baker Street as well as one on Carlton House Terrace.” Mike replied.
He hoped to get the blood off his jacket and pants, the shirt he would probably just toss out. He watched as a dark haired woman stopped at the room at the end of the hall before heading over to him.
“When did you say your cousin is back from his work term in America?” Mycroft said taking Greg’s hand.
Willa had no answer for that. She never told Ashton about the gifts from the agency, the affairs. She wanted to; he was never supposed to be more than a fling, not something going on a year, now it was too far along, how would she tell him? She had so many one night stands. She'd tried to stop but after trying to kick her addiction to the drugs Victor and Raquel had always supplied, the other addiction started, the need for well not love, not sex, but just someone there with her, so she wasn't alone at night.
Sherlock sat next to the hospital bed. John was sleeping now Rosie curled up beside him. Greg and Mycroft had come the moment they heard.
John looked up as water started pouring in, not very heavily more at a rain showers pace, the well would fill up slowly, but it would fill. The chain on John’s leg was long, but not enough to reach the top, a half full well and his head would be under.
Then screamed again, Willa with her eyes closed and arm shaking had missed and instead of hitting Irene in the head she had hit her where her chest, collarbone and neck met.
Sherlock picked up the phone and looked. “Luminol was found present in the blood. Molly is starting the autopsy at 3. She is also inviting us to an engagement party. Her parents are throwing it next Saturday, Rosie is also invited.”
Daddy took the box labeled with Mycroft’s name and removed the jacket.                         As he turned to take it over to his son’s bed a small bag fell onto the floor. Daddy bent down and picked it up, the black velvet bag was embossed with silver lettering BVLGARI.
“No, Anthea is meeting me at the flat. We can handle it.’ Mycroft said putting on his jacket and heading to the door.
“That is of course if Graham wants to go back to work, he could quite easily be a house husband living off the wage of his husband and attending footie and rugby matches at leisure” Sherlock smiled
“They will have a lot of help with little Rosie. That’s what Grandparent do, and Mrs. Hudson will be helping too” Daddy Holmes smiled.
“Eurus understood right and wrong but she just didn’t care. She wasn’t sociopath, she is clinically a psychopath. Mum and Dad tried to help her, but she was beyond help, at least what a family could provide. She had you convinced that Willa was dead and that is why she wasn’t home anymore. Children after all were not allowed in ICU wards. It all came to a head when she took Redbeard and hid him away. She wanted you to find him. She had this song she made up she would sing it constantly. “ Mycroft paused then sang “I that am lost. Oh, who will find me. Deep down below. The old beech tree? Help succour me now. The East Wind’s blowing”
Mycroft furrowed his brow as Sherlock just looked up at the monitor at John. The three other prisoners looked between the Holmes brothers and the screen where Henry was starting to slow.

The group was roughly the same size as it had been the day John joined. A few had left. Karen remained. She didn’t talk much still but she looked to be getting better.
“John will still be haunted by it, that he couldn’t save his wife, mother of his child. Every time he looks at the little one he’ll remember” Sebastian said as the woman dug around in the bedside table.
“Dear Willa this is a controlled burn, it should be slow. Should, these old pre-burnt buildings can be so unpredictable. Outside the window you will see Elijah precariously hanging over the bluff. Below is an elaborate set up thought up by one of my fellow inmates. The wind will blow and will slowly saw away at the tree. If enough time passes, the tree will fall over the bluff Elijah will go and he can join his mother in the sweet there after… if such a place exists. Which it doesn’t”
Her dark hair hung in curls framing her face and making her skin seem like it was flawless porcelain, her blue eyes and red lips stood out in contrast to her fairer skin.
“I wanted to play I just didn’t want to play the childish games Sherlock insisted on playing because you were too stupid to play the one I wanted to play.” Eurus snapped.
Greg had jumped up to try and brace himself by holding the grated top of the elevator, he jumped just as it jerked to a stop, legs already in the air he tucked in tight as he hit the floor of the elevator, the air was knocked clean from his lungs, and the first few moments were spent painfully trying to breathe. After that it was assessing the rest of his body, his hip hurt but he could move it, a bit, and stand on it, not his full weight but enough to move around, his side was sore, and he had a wicked head ache. Sally was on the ground beside him. Both her legs were misshapen and bloody, and she had a large lump on the side of her head. Greg had removed his coat and laid it over her.
“In a way you do.” Mycroft said. “As I said in every move you make case you take. She was jealous. As Willa got better, came home and grew up Eurus became jealous. Redbeard would not play with her. But loved Willa, and Sherlock. Sherlock took it upon himself to teach Willa well everything. How to eat, dress herself, even brush her teeth. So Eurus seized her opportunity and Willa was left unsupervised and was able to bypass the child gate. You tried to tell her stop but Eurus gave her a shove. And down she went. Mum witnessed the whole thing. She watched and Redbeard stood over Willa protecting her and as Eurus stood at the top of the stairs grinning.”
This was not just about them, this was about Marisol, getting her line out there and seen, making her the top in the world.
“No, No leave her! Leave her alone” Greg’s cries echoes though the upper floor of the house. His body thrashed and lashed out as if fending off an invisible attacker.
Someone would have to find her, though the voices in the corridor were not exactly what she was hoping to hear.
“I was thinking a banana royale with chocolate, chocolate chip and chocolate chip cookie dough as the base” Sherlock said with a wistful look in his eye
“I have been well. Thank you for asking. Not many do. Elijah has decided that he wants to behave and not run all over. He had a nightmare about getting stuck in the pond the night after we first met you. I had wanted to come back and see if you were here the following week then the week after that but life as it was had other plans.” Judy said taking the empty berry container from Elijah and putting it in the bag on the back of the stroller.
“This is one part of it. I promise I will tell you all but for now I can’t.” Mycroft grabbed his umbrella and headed to the door. “Work on the task force materials or get some sleep. I will see you in the morning.”
“No. I need to do this now. It’s only fair, you opened up, my turn.” John took a deep breath. “My father kicked me out of the house when I was 14. He caught me with another boy up by the rugby field. We weren’t doing much, just kissing. But it was enough. My father had been abusive all my life. Mostly to my mother, then as Harry and I got older he started in on us too. It’s sort of how I decided to become a doctor. I would watch them work every time we were at the hospital. I’d watch in fascination as they set my arm or stitched up Harry’s cheek. How gentle they were tapping up the broken ribs of ten year old me or talking Harry away from suicide when she was 12. Father had already kicked Harry out of the house a few years earlier. This was after she brought home her first girlfriend. So it wasn’t too jarring to me to get kicked out. I know my mom was disappointed. I had a girlfriend at the time who she adored. But I didn’t really know what I wanted. And Frank was a good friend from school. We were on the rugby team together. We were young and curious. Frank is now happily married too Angelica Waterrose and have five kids. His parents really didn’t care who he snogged. As long as his marks stayed good and his performance on the rugby field didn’t falter that was all that mattered.” John stopped and looked out the window. It was starting to rain.
John watched Sholto leave, John couldn’t imagine what was going through his commanders’ head. Sholto and D’Helley were close. As close and John and Riley were. But unlike John and Riley, their relationship was not public. Major Ronald D’Helley had a wife back home, a few kids. The relationship he shared with Major James Sholto was an old one, way back from their time in basic training as new recruits. Neither man was “out” as they say. In fact, they were such army diehards that neither thought they would have a career if they were out. So they hid it from everyone. D’Helley going as far as finding a woman and marrying her and starting a family. Sholto remained the bachelor, he’d go with women when the men were on their leave in various part of the world. But his heart belonged to Ronald D’Helley. James Sholto would be the one to call Faith, to tell her the horrible news, he would be the ones the kids, his godchildren, would call to vent and to cry to. He would mourn Ronald alone.
“For now, I have seen where it doesn’t fully hit a person until the rehabilitation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  phase starts”   Daddy Holmes replied as he went to the closet to find Mycroft’s jacket. They were going to send everything to laundry but hadn’t got around to it yet.
“They are trying to get near it” The other paramedic said as he leaned towards Paul “The girl in the elevator is black tag” he whispered before turning back to Greg. “Once are network started to come back up so did the military’s they’re getting ready to mobilize”
Mycroft was grateful for the concierge service that would pick up their luggage and deliver it home. They had went with one suitcase each and returned with three each. Greg’s second suitcase was filled with items for Rosie. Mostly princess dresses she could grow into and even a pirate costume for her to play in. Not to mention all the stuffies, they has a small suitcase filled to the brim with nearly hundreds of little stuffed logs called Tsum Tusms that they were told all the kids loved. So of course Greg had to buy every single cute one for Rosie and then an oversized on of Chewbacca for himself.
The oversized, four post king bed sat on a circular pedestal in the off to the one side in the middle of the wall with a small canopy over it. Jim pulled Sebastian onto it and began to undo the buttons of his fatigues. As he peeled off Sebastian’s undershirt Jim paused and studied the body beneath him.
“No, they didn’t bother to talk or anything, each in their own little world. By default, Wilhelmina my sister, be a dear and retrieve what is in hatch.” Eurus instructed.
"Seven and a half months." Riley replied, "longest that it normally can be, they warned us our first tour would be the shortest, that was 4 months, this is our second deployment."
The first notes of the song started. Thank You-By Led Zeppelin. Greg turned his head to look at the stage as the curtain rose. There sat Robert Plant, Jimmy Page, and John Paul Jones with Jason Bonham on drums, playing the song live. Greg’s smile grew from ear to ear as he kissed Mycroft as hard as he could.
“Ok I have all your paperwork. Just need a few signatures” She said setting down the papers as Greg put a date square into his mouth.
Sebastian smiled and introduced himself. He was escorted to a waiting limo and taken to the Burj Al Arab hotel, also known as the sailboat, and up to the 25
“Leave her.” Eurus said over the intercom. “I was trying to give her a swift painless death but now because you are too stupid to do it right she will have to suffer.”
The little one pulled away from his mother and took off towards the pond. The woman went to follow but fell.
Sebastian gripped Jim’s waist again, tight, and pulled him down tight against his body, burring his face in the crook of Jim’s neck. The smell of mint, ginger, bergamot, juniper, thyme, and vetiver mixed with the subtle sweet musk of human skin filled his nostrils. Sebastian breathed in deeply as he bit down on Jim’s neck enough to bruise but not puncture. Jim giggled.
“So how will we tell you apart on your next tour?” Sholto asked “Captain Sutter or Captain Watson Squared. Unless one of you gets promoted, but that will be awkward having to salute in bed.”
After cake came a spin on the bouquet and garter toss. Most wedding couples would be horrified to have someone take away from their night. But for Greg and Mycroft the formalities were over they were married and this was just the after party. So why not help someone they care about find happiness.
There had to be people searching the building for survivors, why hadn’t they come. Something wasn’t right about this. It was an explosion, that’s usually links to terrorists; the government should be all over this. Mycroft would be texting, or sending agents to check on him. Why was no one here? Would there even be anyone coming?
Eurus gave a small smile as she carried the child into the house. She entered the room where his mother was. Irene glared up at Eurus.
She reached over and cranked up the water flow on John, he’s start to float sooner and then he would drown.
“Sherlock tried to solve it.” John said quietly “He was eight and the police dismissed him as a nosy child. It’s why he’s so insistent now. Why he makes himself heard. He never wants another case to go unsolved, let a killer go with no justice. So he makes himself heard. I started blogging about it. Not only to help me though my own issues but it spread the word about Sherlock more. So he could help more people.”
John just nodded and continued to examine Sherlock. His shirt was charred; a large shrapnel filled burn ran from the base of his neck to mid back. John carefully palpitated around Sherlock’s neck something felt off.
Three days had passed since the explosions and they were still digging bodies out of all the wreckage sites. 372 dead at the MET alone, so many of the names sounded familiar to Molly, but the ones that hit the hardest were Dyson, Macintyre, Foyle and Donovan. They were ones who worked many of the major crimes she dealt with as well. Many more were administrative support that worked in the records keeping as those floors had sustained the most damage.
“Oh they’ve all gone” She said looking around “Well more biscuits for you.” She smiled setting the tray down. She pulled the blanket up over Mary then left.
“I am listening in too.” Eurus said the three stopped “Don’t fret, Sherlock is nearby. But he has a very hard decision to make. He needs to solve my riddle, to save you, but the more time he takes to solve it the less chance he has of saving you all. And did I mention he has to do all this without uttering a word. I know how he loves to talk so I have taken precautions to make sure he remains silent.” Eurus gave a chuckle.
“yes. Detective Sargent Gregory Lestrade of the MET. He and Sherlock have had some run-ins. Seems Sherlock has fancied himself an amateur detective in his spare time. Apparently, he helped solve two nasty murder cases and three cold cases.”
Perhaps they should go visit. John watched as the others started to leave, Karen gave him another small hug and headed out. Diane looked down at John then knelt beside him.
Mycroft’s doing no doubt. But that was for the best. Sherlock needed Victor to be far, far away and VERY unreachable, or else there was no doubt that Sherlock would run right back to him.
Mrs. Hudson looked at the mobile phone in her hand she had text everyone in John’s contact list and no one had responded.
“Greg Please” Mycroft said trying to follow, but by the time he reached the street Greg was in his car and heading down the street. Mycroft reentered the flat and glared at Anthea. “How did this file get into the task forces hands? This is high level security, this has everything in it and thank god Greg only read the first few pages.”
“Let’s just say he won’t win any best butt contests” Anthea gave a small smile as she looked over at the doorway where Denny and Marco stood. Her smile fell. “What is Eurus’s end game?”
But he didn’t need to worry about the little one going into the system. Elijah seemed drawn to Greg. When Greg was brought out of surgery Elijah, who had been sitting with Willa, got up and went and curled up by him.
Mycroft reached over and gave Greg’s hand a small squeeze as Sherlock approached the podium for the start of the speeches.
Greg was always into sports and by the time he graduated he was a pro-footie player and married to Margaret, his high school sweetheart. He played for four years. Then an injury occurred, so he decided to change gears, be a police officer like his father.
Anthea screamed as the bones shifted back into their proper place. She slid down and sat back against the wall next to Mycroft. She carefully moved her shoulder testing it to see if it would stay in place.
Brodie’s back was broken, and his spinal cord severed. He spent a month in hospital then another two in rehab. He hit a low spot during that time. But after meeting with some great therapists he pulled himself back up.
Sherlock looked at the magazine again, then at the television. What was that Sargent’s name, Sherlock had committed it to memory, but the meds mixed with the concussion and withdrawal were making his mind a bit fuzzy. Lester, Strand, Lestrade.
“Where did your chew ring go?” Sherlock asked as he looked around the immediate area before seeing it down in the snuggly. Rosie giggled and cooed. Sherlock smiled “The meeting must have helped; your daddy is just staying for a little follow up with Diane”
Elijah had been told what happened to his mother. Not the full truth but that she was dead. It had taken a while for him to fully understand what that meant. Then the topic of who would become Elijah’s guardian was brought up. Sherlock would have loved to volunteer himself and John. But with John needing care and little Rosie due to arrive home soon from her and Mrs. Hudson’s protective vacation, Sherlock was unsure of his ability to care for the little one.
Mrs. Hudson had sat holding Rosie in her arms, still wrapped in John’s shirt but now also his jumper, just trying to keep the little one warm.
Sherlock sighed as he flipped through the magazine a fifth time. Just because he was in these things didn’t mean he liked them. The agency had sent over a stack of them for him and Willa. Willa wasn’t even awake yet, they were keeping her sedated until her throat healed more and the ventilator could be removed.
Greg headed up stairs to the bedroom he shared with Mycroft, at least when Mycroft was at home. He had wasted no time getting back to work. Even before he got his prosthetic leg there was no stopping him. Then when he transitioned from crutches to having the new leg, Mycroft was right back fully immersed in the world of the British government that he helped run.
“Well I’m running out of mastermind criminals for you to have conversations with.” Mycroft said not moving his eyes from her.
The job took Mycroft all over the world, and by proxy away from his family. Sherlock’s struggle with drugs got worse as his boyfriend used him. Mycroft was in Ghent, Belgium when he got the call that Sherlock was in the hospital.
Now Mycroft wondered what life would have been like if he had defied Uncle Rudy, if Willa had been welcomed back into the Holmes home. Would Sherlock have gone down that dark path? Would they have still become entangled in that deadly game with Moriarty?
“You going to stay sober from now on?” Lestrade asked. Sherlock gave him an almost insulted look. “I ask because my offer still stands,” Lestrade said revealing a stack of files. “As part of my new position I have all the access you want to cold cases.”
Sebastian turned from the rubble in front of him. Was sort of sad to see Molly laid out there, all the blood and a blank stare at the ceiling, done in by one of her tools of her trade. If Sherlock survived this little assault, she would have been good to use against him.
“Hello Sherlock, Hello, brother.” A trembling voice said on the line. “You will find Mike, or rather what’s left of him.” The voice paused you could hear the fear and the crying in her voice. “At 44 Eaton Court. The former resident is not to happy, but then again she was never going back there?”
“Yeah, just made the poor choice of trying to watch the news” Greg replied grabbing a bottle of beer out of the fridge.
You think after the scandal in Dubai with him and the prince's betrothed son it would have been obvious to the masses which team he played for.
“And get me that camera footage form the CCTVs” He hollered as he exited anger radiating though the walls.
“It’s ok. John this is Judy and Elijah I told you about them. We can head home it’s ok” Sherlock said taking John’s hand.
Greg stepped out of the shower as the water started to turn cold. He would have to try and sit down with Mycroft and have a serious conversation.
Sherlock stood in the open field between the house and the bluff, he held Elijah close. The young boy gripped onto Sherlock tightly. He had been startled and cared of Sherlock when he first saw him. Sherlock couldn’t blame the poor child. What he must look like.
“Not bad, it got a hard head, minor concussion and I was a little discombobulated and didn’t realize I fell off the bleachers and hurt my back, just a sprain I’ll be fine,” Robbie answered looking at Sherlock at Willa. “Blimey, they don’t look good, they were already so pale and now….”
“I’m going to head into the office see if Moriarty has started any of his usual tricks” Lestrade said heading out.
“God, complex wanted to make life…” Sherlock closed his eyes tight “Anthropic rock or man-made rock!”
“Perhaps you and John should take Rosie out of the city for a few days once he is better.” Mycroft said moving to sit next to Greg “Go see Mummy and Daddy.”
“The truth about your family Sherlock. The truth about your dear little Willa.” Mike said. With that the phone call ended.
He was in a chair, arms and tied to the chair arms. Greg was Next to him in a chair, he still seemed to be out, on John’s other side was a woman, one he had come to know only from pictures, Willa Holmes. She was in the chair same as he and Greg but she was awake.
Greg’s eyes opened and he smiled though the kiss, playfully running his tongue along Mycroft’s lips. Mycroft responded by pulling Greg closer and slipping his tongue deep into Greg’s mouth, Greg gave a small growl and his moved the duvet and pushed his hips against Mycroft’s.
January 1st the world as he knew it was going to end for John Watson. The man who made him strong, the man who saved him was going away again. John watched him board the plane, the knot in his stomach getting tighter, he didn’t get to tell Sherlock the truth. That is was him that he loved, and not Mary. Yes Mary was the mother of his child, and he said last week that he would stay with her no matter what. But he’d had time to think now and Mary was not what he wanted, he would love their daughter, and he would still help Mary sort out her past, but he didn’t love her, not the way he loved Sherlock.
“I am still me just diminished” Jim replied walking away from her and starring out the window. “And I want to go out on my own terms while I still can”
“And we have so much to do. Finalize the menu, pick the flowers, I’ll handle the band” Mycroft started as they finished with Flora and headed back to the waiting car.
Eurus Holmes had no emotional responses, she would observe but she would not respond in any perceivable emotional way. Just with question, asking them about their thoughts and emotions. Like she was trying to understand feelings and emotions and how they affected people thought process.
Anthea nodded as she watched Sherlock make his way thought the file. From top to bottom it went from most recent information to oldest information.
Sherlock stood in front of the screen watching Irene. She was still bleeding heavily. Victor no doubt had given her something to prevent coagulation, a fast bleed; even if it had been a shot to the head it would bleed out more upping the gore.
Sherlock went and sat in the corner, back to the wall, knees up face buried in his hands. He was crying.
He settled in nicely and he liked his coworkers well enough. Then two months ago he met Molly and while he always liked coming to work. Having her there made him LOVE coming to work.
John was pretty sure Sherlock didn’t need help with the recipes anymore but it had become a tradition. After they ate John and Sherlock would move into the sitting room and work on cases. Molly would tidy up and play with Rosie for a bit. Sometimes Mrs. Hudson would come up as well and she and Molly would play cards. Once or twice Greg and Mycroft had also come. Greg once brought a double chocolate cake that could only be describes as decadent death by chocolate. Sherlock had even mushed up a little and fed it to Rosie.
“Look at our little angel.” Eurus’s voice echoed over the speaker. “Well she’s no longer the littlest in our family is she? She surpassed me. No wonder you liked her more Sherlock. She’s like a prettier you. Well beauty fades. Better to have brains.”
“Shall we go for another walk; the frogs are out by the pond we can listen to them sing.” Sherlock continued as he stood. Rose gave a cheer like coo. He smiled, and headed down to the pond in the park. He was correct the frogs were making plenty of noise.
Mrs. Hudson nodded and headed into the bedroom. Rosie fussed but was soon soothed by Mrs. Hudson rocking her as she walked.
There were about a dozen people there, sitting in the chairs and loveseats that were arranged in a sort of squished circle. Diane came over.
“Fine so you weren’t in on the killing of Moriarty, Mycroft just wanted to protect his little brother. Didn’t want his boyfriend getting involved. But I know major crimes handled the body, and the aftermath. Where is Jimmy buried?” Sebastian asked
“I will text” John replied “No sense bringing the two of you into this. Take Rosie to the park. Feed the ducks”
Molly wiped her eyes as she heard the click of heels on tile flooring, coming near the entrance to the room. She heard voices. A man entered and went to Anthea who looked shocked but carefully got up and headed to the door. There was more discussion before Anthea returned followed by another woman, she was beautiful.
“Well then we must enjoy the feast so that we both can maintain for as long as possible” Mycroft replied as he turned his head and bit down on Greg’s lower lip.
“Mycroft came to talk.” Albert said as he motioned for Mycroft to sit in one of the garden chairs “It’s been a week, and I know the fight was a bout a lie and Mycroft said he wants to come clean. Give him the chance to make things right.”
“It’s awful quiet” Mrs. Hudson spoke up as John dug though the kitchen cupboards for anything he could use in helping to deliver his own child.
“I really don’t care right now.” Sherlock said removing the pink phone from his pocket. He dialed. And put it on speaker phone.
Documents signed and passports noted, they headed off to the arrivals area to meet their car. As they exited the doors there were people lined up behind the barrier waiting for their loved ones. Mycroft spotted a familiar face in the crowd. He was excited, Had Sherlock and John brought Rosie to greet them. They did miss her so.
Eurus turned and gave a nod to one of the guards still in the room. The guard stepped forward and smacked Victor across the face with a baton.
"Ok, that's it then. I'm off." Brody said giving the place a once-over. No one else was there but for how long. "You need anything just call. I'll see you on Monday for the first fitting."
"The one in Milan was the last," Willa replied. "I can stop. I have Ashton I don't need anyone else."
John put Rosie’s bib back on and the wedding party along with Mummy and Daddy headed into the reception room to prepare for the newlywed’s grand entrance.
“Willa’s friend childhood friend Leon is a lawyer in family court, he saw you case, mentioned it to me when he came to visit her yesterday,” Sherlock said revealing his source. “You ex is pushing hard. I hope when she loses that she is able to leave you and your children alone.”
“Yeah, well not really, I mean she was bleeding and looking for her boyfriend... he didn’t make it,” Greg said looking down.
Eurus with a little makeup, a short wig, a compressing body stocking and corset over baggy clothing Eurus easily became Karen, the sickly widow of an explosion victim. Add to that a dead child and the stories and memories were enough to upset John greatly a few key trigger words and he was shaking. The added injection of a drug designed by a friend of hers and it was enough to send John into a full blown cardiac episode presenting as a panic attack.
"No. Aston deserves to see you," Sherlock said pulling his hand away from her. "You don't have to protect me. I'm fine Victor will take care of me."
Sebastian looked at the ring on the chain around his neck. They joked about marriage, but Sebastian never got the chance to ask Jimmy. Why did no one care who Jimmy left behind? Why celebrate Sherlock?
Mycroft carefully got in on the seat next to Greg as John helped Sherlock in to the seat facing them.
“Everyone, all 12 of them, lost someone because of us. Karen, she’s a frail young thing, lost her husband and her son in Speedy’s, she’s a cancer survivor, planning a trip to Paris Disney to celebrate. And she lost her world in an attack meant for us” John said voice cracking “She recognized me, told me it wasn’t my fault, Diane said the same thing. But they are wrong, it is our fault. WE seek the danger we crave it, and now so many others have suffered for it. Lestrade, Molly, even Mycroft and Anthea, tt’s all our fault they got hurt. And more importantly it’s mine. You dove off the roof, you jumped to save me. And that is what angered Moran the most. That I got you back and he didn’t get Jim back.”
Sebastian stared at the growing stain of blood. It didn’t hurt much; He’d been shot before and knew that if it wasn’t hurting then he was in shock.
“Go get Doctor Watson, pack up him and Wilhelmina along with Sherlock. I am going to put my dear brother though his ultimate test.” She said as she made her way out of the control room.
John didn’t know what to say, or if he should say anything. He decided to let Sherlock compose himself and continue.
Irene pulled at the cuff that chained her to the bed. “If you hurt my son, I swear I will kill you.”
“I am due to start physio in the morning one of the first things they will do is move he to a fully sitting position this will be easier for everyone involved if it is done using the chair. So since the aides are already here and they are trained to move patients like me, they can do it while they are here.” Sherlock said.
He stared up at the ceiling, perhaps he hadn’t failed, just because the paramedics arrived didn’t mean that John and Sherlock had survived. How long had he been out? They could already have been long dead and buried, the child shipped off to relatives, Sebastian honestly didn’t see Mycroft raising a child.
“I’m sorry the correct answer was… Tombstones… Which is what dear Henry will be needing shortly” Eurus said as a shot ran off.
The Diogenes had the least collateral damage. Most of the rooms were reinforced for defense against such attacks, so just the office and the panic room were damaged.
“I, I love you too” Sherlock said “From the minute you locked eyes with me in the lab. It was solidified when you shot the cabbie” Sherlock smiled
“She knew she wouldn’t make it” Mrs. Hudson said coming into view, she had Rosie in her arms. “Her last words to John were for you and he to raise the child together”
Moriarty and Moran hopped into the near buy security van and sped off out of the base as behind him Sholto heard a sickening boom. He looked back to see D’Helley, or rather what was left of his upper torso against another truck. He’d grabbed a nearby sandbag to try and defuse the blast. It may have worked if had been quicker. The sandbag protected his upper half while the powerful homemade device effectively removed his lower half, a few men from near the rec area lay on the ground. Medical personnel rushed in.
“Take Rosie into Sherlock’s bedroom and hid behind his bed, take my mobile and try and text everyone in there to see if we can get some help.” John helped her up there was a growing pain in his stomach. “Do not make a sound”
“Um, Hello Sherlock. I was in the area and thought I would check on you and your sister.” Lestrade said from the doorway.
Sebastian made his way down the stairs to the ground floor. He was met at the bottom by some of his men.
There was some shouting. Sounded German, then a Far East dialect, Farsi maybe? She had heard Sherlock speak that once, it sounded like that.
“But if she was 9 when you found out Sherlock would have been 11 surely old enough to be told and to deal with the fall out.” Greg asked. He was slightly in shock about the whole thing.
Sherlock smiled as tears freely fell down his cheeks. John just beamed. This was Rosie’s first time saying love and he was so happy it was to Sherlock. Sherlock needed to hear that at this exact moment, and John honestly believed that Rosie knew that.
“I have a stack of cold cases waiting for him when he’s up to it. You just know he’ll drive everyone else bonkers if he doesn’t have anything else to do while bedridden.” Greg smiled
“I never let anyone close for fear that my job would endanger them as much as it endangers me” Mycroft said eyes reddening. “Never thought it would be family that hurt him”
Mycroft Holmes was Sherlock and Willa's older brother. He was a government official and seemed to have vigilant surveillance of his young siblings. It was at Mycroft's wishes that Sherlock's close friend Victor Trevor not accompany them on any trips.
“Listen to this menu.” He smiled “The Gold Menu Roasted tournedo of salmon on a cucumber, radish and asparagus ribbon, salad dressed with hollandaise, Confit chicken and smoked ham hock terrine, pickled baby beets with a light mustard dressing, Warm goats cheese spring roll with red onion marmalade, roasted hazelnuts and micro herbs. That’s just the appetizers”
“Could this Victor Trevor be working with the tong now?” Dimmock asked. “I mean if he has an empire to rebuild, he’d need operating capital, working with a tong would give him that. He moves stuff in for them and they give him the money he needs to rebuild.”
Anthea just nodded as John moved about the infirmary, hooking Greg up to a monitor and administering some medication.
“They’re all married.” Sherlock answered with exasperation. How stupid was this trapped in this building and force to play stupid games for lives of others.
“Actually.” Josie spoke up “it would have, and it would have been worse. Moriarty didn’t exist because of Sherlock Holmes. He already existed. People Say he committed his first murder when he was still a child. It was the talk of the MET back when Moriarty came on the scene. A Carl Powers.”
John tossed a towel over Greg’s shoulder before handing him Rosie. Rosie squealed with delight and planted a sloppy “kiss” on his cheek.
“Yes, but his breathing has been improving so he may be off it soon” Daddy replied as Mycroft teared up.
“No, I’m not leaving you Sherlock, You forget I did lose you, and almost lost you two other times. We’re in this together, We’re the detective and the blogger, Sherlock Holmes and Dr. John Watson.” John said pulling Sherlock in close. “I know this new emotional side of you is all flooding out, but let’s not be rash. We are in this together. I’m staying”
“Came out for a drink.” Sherlock interjected, John hung his head “That was a full bottle yesterday.”
John’s body shook as he cried harder. Sherlock rubbed his back and hummed. He kissed the top of John’s forehead.
Sherlock watched the scene in front of him. Willa raised the gun her arm shaking. She closed her eyes and pulled the trigger. The others jumped Irene screamed.
Greg slowly pulled himself up to a sitting position. He winced as the muscles in his side and stomach started to spasm; they were still not ok after having the wind knocked out. He reached up with his hand and gently touched his face, it was sore. There was something under his nose. He wiped and looked, blood, he gingerly touched his nose, yep broken. His cheek, and by his eye was swollen too, he didn’t even want to think about how it looked.
“I had my orders,” Sholto replied. “And in all honesty, I was so numb from, from seeing him. I didn’t notice till Hendricks asked me why I was bleeding on his floor.”
“Get out of the flat and get as far away from Baker Street as you can, do not go to MET or the Diogenes club in fact if Mycroft or Lestrade are at either of those location tell them to leave and tell Molly to leave St Bart’s.”
“In a position like mine caring is not an advantage. Emotions have no place in politics” Mycroft stated
“Shut up” John said bluntly. The water was at his chest; soon he would start to float. He could hear Willa coughing looking up even in the moonlight he could see the smoke filling the air.
“Went after that asshole former commander of ours too, Sholto. You were one of his favorites, you and Riley, you would do anything for him, and he would reward you handsomely” Sebastian smirked aiming his gun at John. “It was fun leading those Afghan forces against Sholto, didn’t get to kill him, was upset at first, then I watched him being roasted in the media, was even better then death.” Sebastian kicked Sherlock’s foot drawing a moan from the man “Ah he is alive”
“I thought it was going to be just family and close friends at Angelo’s” John smiled as they got into the car.
“I will” Anthea replied studying the glass in her other arm. “I can take this glass out if I can bandage it that would give me a more working hand.”
“Oh it’s not just that Sherlock. I monitored you. I know that what happened formed who you are. Memories can resurface; wounds can re-open. The roads we walk have demons beneath ... and yours have been waiting for a very long time. I never bullied or teased you. I used – at discrete intervals – potential trigger words to update myself as to your mental condition. I was looking after you.” Mycroft calmly said.
Mycroft tried hard to keep the man away even when they were at home in London but it was hard. Sherlock was crafty and knew how to shirk the watchful eyes Mycroft set on him. It's why Mycroft had hired Brody. He'd wanted more security but the more he pushed the harder they pushed back. It didn't help that the agency meddled, they wanted happy models which meant they caved to the twins every wish. Brody and Mycroft suspected this included the dugs when Victor was not around. Brody had foiled several delivery attempts but still, the stuff made it though, and he would find them high and passed out in a hotel and green rooms, usually draped over other people and naked. They had taken to searching the people that were brought but was no effect.
Now John was on a mild sedative and left to sleep. The doctors wanted to monitor his heart a little more, just to see if this was a one-time thing.
“And I think you should be open and honest with Sherlock, from what you’ve told me he’s really been opening up as a person, starting to show, feel and understand emotions. Your little sociopath is fading and a new Sherlock is emerging. I think if you were honest with him he would be there for you.” Diane smiled
She gave him the ice pack she created with a resealable plastic baggie that she then wrapped in a bar towel, and knelt with the belt she stopped to take from Agent Keinfeld. She gently slid it under his leg just below his knee, looping it around she pulled it tight.
“I’m his mother” Mummy smiled, John gave a weak smile. “And you are going to be fine, bit of bleeding then scaring us all with a fractured skull and internal bleeding, a walking wounded”
“Worked a messy case, had some blood on me, the hospital gave me these to wear. I am not injured” He said as the kids checked him over. “There was a shooting the lady was bleeding, and I held pressure on the wound until the paramedics arrived.”
“I’m still awake; sorry was trying to go through my memories and files to see what militant group we should have kept a better eye on. Mind is a little fuzzy however, nothing seems in order.” Mycroft sighed.
Sherlock sighed as he looked at the picture. It was not a combination or a padlock; this was a lock that only opened with a finger print. Who’s finger print though?
“They are bracing the floor beneath you so they can walk on it, bloody miracle that it’s still up with you on it.” Mike said with a smile.
Sherlock looked down at the now yawning Rosie, he and John would have a lot of that in their future probably. Rosie even a 4 months, almost 5 months of age was already showing her father’s determination. She was already trying to grab the spoon from them and feed herself and she when having tummy time on the floors she was trying to pull herself up, not to crawl but to stand.
He looked back at the interior of the elevator; Sally was lying on the floor, she kept fading in and out of consciousness. They had fallen 10 floors, and Greg still wasn’t sure what stopped the elevator from falling more. It seemed to slow just a bit then finally jerked to a stop. The jerking stop was rough.
Sherlock looked up to see Judy and Elijah coming up the path. Elijah happily sitting in a stroller eating some raspberries.
“I didn’t expect Mycroft’s little second to be so, unhurt” The voice said “It was Anthea Lawrence’s credentials that got back into the system and kicked my man out”
“You killed people; you messed up people’s lives, all because you didn’t like HOW your family loved you.” John was fuming.
John and Riley came out of the rec center and over to some of the injured men as more went to work on D’Helley, there was not much they could do for the man now. The damage and blood loss was extensive.
“Well that would be wonderful, I would love to see Dr. Watson’s reaction to just watching a person die before him again while he cannot do a thing to help. But that is not my plan. Jim and I put this little game together five years ago. The last five years have all been a wonderful act. From getting Magnusson to make his rare mistakes that led him to you, to kidnapping John and sticking him in that fire. That was Jim’s idea. Pity he could see all this come to fruition. Jim was a great mastermind. And to have something so common as cancer bring him down. We could have made an even greater team. Just had to get rid of Moran, he was too unleveled headed. Never mind that now we start to have our fun.” Eurus said as her face appeared on the third screen.
Sebastian made easy work of bringing John down, he took out his legs then a punch to the solar plexus had John reeling.
It's why Brodie accompanied them now instead of their former assistants Monty and Raquel. The enablers as Mycroft called them.
“I was in an elevator that dropped, I was shot, I saw my partner die, I attended more funerals in a matter of weeks than most do in their entire lives. It’s too late for this protection shit” Greg said as Mycroft stood
“No” Sebastian replied voice dripping with anger “We got to St. Bart’s and to the Met but the military is back online, you said the city would be shut down for the day. We showed up at the Diogenes and the military is already there.”
John took a deep breath and pushed himself to a sitting position. A wave a pain and nausea and pain hit him, but he pushed on, much to the protests of Mummy Holmes, Once he swung his feet over the edge of the bed she gave up stopping him and shifted to helping him, making sure his IV bag and line didn’t get pulled out. John weakly shuffled across the small gap between the beds and started to climb up next to Sherlock.
There had been a lot of MET personnel funerals to attend over the last few weeks. Most had been held off till the injured had healed more and so full investigations could be done.
“Hello.” He started “I know we’ve used only first names here but I feel that if I am to be a part of your group then it is only fair that you should know who I am. I am John Watson and I was the target of the explosion on Baker Street, me and my partner Sherlock Holmes. We are friends with Gregory Lestrade the target at The MET. Mycroft Holmes, Sherlock’s brother was the target on Carlton Terrace. And our friend Molly Hooper was the target at St Bart’s.”
“Your breath.” Mycroft answered with an exasperated tone. He could not believe he was being held in a prison forced to play childish games.
Sherlock nodded. “Very true, but Brodie is very good at what he does and having someone like him on call is very helpful to me… us.”
John stood between Mary and Sherlock his head pounding. The floorboards in the hallway creaked as a shadow moved on what was left of the room in front of John.
The officiant handed the first ring to Mycroft. A simple silver ring with diamonds inlayed, silver to match the engagement ring he’d given Greg which Greg had now moved to his right hand.
Sherlock was Mycroft’s best man. John was Greg’s. Greg had originally thought of asking one of his cousins to be his best man. That would undoubtedly have set off in-fighting between the cousins and he didn’t want that. Molly and Anthea were their grooms maids, a term Mycroft had seen on the internet.
“Hello” he smiled “You gave us quite a scare laying there eyes open and saw in your chest, when I neared though you flinched and passed out. But The firemen are working on getting you free.”
