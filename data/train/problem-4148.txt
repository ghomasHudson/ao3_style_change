"Wow that's awesome." Sam replied.
Gabriel laughed, "I have my days." he replied.
Dean didn't know what to do so he reached out slightly and Castiel lashed out at him,
Dean rocked his hips slightly, letting Cas take over more as his mind cleared. He kept his hand with Cas's, knowing he still wasn't totally with it, but definitely needing release and wanting more. He was still holding Cas with his other arm, his fingernails slightly digging in to the skin of his back.
"Well it'll be nice being surprised. Probably." Dean added with a smile, leaning down to kiss Cas on the cheek. "That's no problem, we can swing by your house tomorrow if you want." He offered. "There's not much else for us to do I don't think."
They checked his head and said it was fine. The bruising has faded already since it had been a little while already. Dean got a physical exam too, make sure everything was okay for him to go see Cas. They said he was fine again and he seemed happy with that.
"Cheater!" "Whore!" they yelled at him and he didn't understand why.
"Hm, I don't know, the chance of getting caught might just add to the excitement." Dean replied with a smirk, arching a brow slightly. "Yeah, the cat ears count as role play. I mean, I don't exactly know all the guidelines for this sort of thing, but yeah I think so." He added.
The little guy climbed out of the vase and made his way to the pancake and he poked it and prodded before he plopped on top of it. Dean was going to correct him before he saw the glee on his face as his tentacles started tearing little pieces as it stuck to his suckers. He picked them off and started stuffing his cheeks. Dean poured out just a little syrup for him before offering it up to him.
“What?” They both said.
"Thanks, Cas." Dean smiled slightly, feeling a sudden surge of emotion for Cas. He twisted his hand to catch Cas's, walking forward and kissing him softly on the forehead. "So can I ask what you said?" He murmured with a hopeful grin, raising their hands to press a kiss against his knuckles. He didn't know if Cas was okay with all the kissing but he just felt the urge to kiss him. It was something he still wasn't used to, but he was trying to figure it out.
His mind drifted back and forth on what he should be doing, things that he should have completed, and of Castiel. He was probably already there in the water and just waiting for him. Dean smiled at that before he heard the floor creak and he looked over to see Sam running his hands through his hair to smooth it out.
Benny ate his lunch, "He doesn't ever fight back but when he does, he tends to stump you." he commented.
"Where are you going?" Castiel asked.
"No you haven't...maybe you should say it again." Castiel smiled and mumbled his reply against Dean's lips. He laughed softly before kissing Dean again. He tangled his fingers in Dean's hair and stroke it.
'I seriously hope he doesn't think I'm creepy for being this forward or anything..'
Castiel swatted at Dean's hands, trying to cover his sides. He rolled onto his side, curling up as he held his sides. His face was already rosy from laughing, he tried to get away from Dean's scribbling fingers but Dean always found new spots to tickle. "NyahAHA! DEAN!" he arched away from his touch, breathing quickly.
Castiel glanced over at Dean, he didn't know what to say to that but he felt a bit better at the words. He never expected Dean to comfort him with words since he knew Dean wasn't one to voice how he felt. He looked back at the mug and drank whatever was left before he put it aside. He started scooting closer to Dean, pressing their sides together. He was more awake now and calm. He knew that Dean wouldn't hurt him, he knew that now, but not when he first woke up. He leaned against him, "I know...you're here." he said softly.
Dean looked at the text for a moment before he replied. He could understand why Cas might be nervous about admitting it, but really Dean just felt an odd sense of relief that he couldn't understand.
"A little extra luck shouldn't hurt." Dean replied with a smile, grabbing his bag as well. "See you in gym, then." He added, giving Cas a half wave before turning and walking towards his shop class. He was still a little worried about the kids in gym, but he figured he could deal with that once they got there. And at least he would be with Cas.
Dean closed his eyes as Cas's hands roamed across him, just enjoying the his touch. He opened his eyes and turned when Cas finished, putting his finger under his chin and tilting up his face for a soft kiss. Then he moved them around and got the soap, lathering across Cas's body and gently cleaning him out.
"Good point, I hadn't thought of you being raised like that." Dean replied. "It does sound more like us. I just want it to be special for you, yknow? I know we'll both enjoy it no matter what just cause it'll be us, but I want it to be memorable. But no judgemental, fancy places." He added.
"It's a little vibrating thing. I like you better, your fingers are more magic." Dean explained and laughed. "You touching me is pretty great, and the other way around is awesome too." He agreed, resting his hand on Cas's shoulder and stroking his thumb across his neck.
Kevin made a weird face by the doorway, "I think one of you guys just touched my butt." he stated.
Dean frowned slightly at Cas's hesitation, wondering what was up with him. Did he not want Dean to walk him, but also didn't want to hurt his feelings or something? He didn't comment though, figuring he'd wait to see how he was the next time they walked together. "Of course you have a good effect on me at school. I actually do homework and stuff with you now." He replied with a slight smile.
Dean glanced back at him, "Can't make it up?" he asked.
"I don't think I ever made you a spare." Dean arched a brow at him over the rim of his mug.
The other guys tsked before walking off. Benny just leaned against the bathroom door, standing guard around it to make sure no one bugged them. "It's okay, you two take the time you need. I already told the teacher where you two will be, you two are covered." he told them.
"I know." Castiel replied and Dean smiled bigger, glad Castiel was picking up references. He leaned up and kissed Castiel softly before lying back into his neck. "Now go to sleep."
Castiel made an embarrassed sound in the back of his throat, blushing. He glanced down, "It...it would only make sense for after...since I am..I am currently filled with...with your semen..." He got progressively softer as he talked, feeling shy now.
Castiel was a bit flustered, not sure how to deal with this situation. He saw Dean coming in, "Dean. Who is this? I don't really know how am I supposed to treat him." he said.
"I'm absolutely positive." Dean replied easily, giving him another soft, reassuring kiss. "Trust me." He murmured, pulling Cas into a deeper kiss and starting to lead him over to the room with the mirror.
"Cas, you're not a burden." Dean said quickly. "If this is about Benny, I'm sorry I locked you in here. You can't just bite people because you wanted to protect me, I can do that myself." he told him.
After what happened, Dean avoided bringing it up or saying anything about it. Castiel had asked him if they could sleep together again but he just said no. Anything that he leniently did before, like taking a bath with him, he just stopped.
Castiel smiled up at him, "Good morning Dean." He said softly. He stretched out a little before hugging Dean again. He traced shapes into Dean's back, humming quietly.
Castiel rest his hands over Dean's as he leaned his head back so it was resting on Dean's shoulder. He slid down a little so it was a bit more comfortable. "Maybe they're not always gentle but they are still fueled by love so I don't mind the roughness, mostly to how you treat me after. You don't treat me roughly and then continue after, you take notice on how I am and take care of me. That is why I'm not scared to let myself go when I'm with you because I trust you. I know you'll take care of me." he said softly.
"You're welcome to stay though, I'm not going to kick you out just because Cas seems okay again. I'm sure he'll be sad that you left without saying goodbye. So just stay for dinner at least." Dean offered.
Castiel just hugged Dean's face, nuzzling against it and purring. Dean slowly pulled himelf out of the water and sat on the dock edge. "Did you want to swim around for a little more?" he asked.
Castiel glanced from the muffins down at his fingers before back up again. He was still twisting them a bit before he felt someone staring at him and he glanced sideways to see Dean watching him and he stopped twisting his fingers. He looked down instead, not wanting Dean to notice.
Castiel chuckled softly, "I actually thought of the same thing just now. I thought about us sitting outside, not really doing anything. Just enjoying each other's company." he said. He was slowly eating his food, not really bothered about classes for once. He didn't feel the worry about getting in trouble for missing any, because when he was with Dean he was more confident about going against orders.
Dean lifted his hips to help Cas remove his pants, shifting with pleasure under Cas's touches. Dean smiled slightly as he kissed his palm, and he looked up to find Cas's vibrant blue eyes looking back at him. His breath caught slightly, feeling Cas's gaze all across him.
"Just let him be. He'll get over it. You can lend him a hand. Literally." Ash told him seriously.
Castiel glanced at him with a smile, "I find cooking relaxing, but this is special. I get to spend another holiday with you guys and not be home alone. It is better in every aspect, since I would have Dean helping me cook, I would be cooking for people I feel grateful to, and I'm happy here." he chuckled a little, "It actually just seems like this is more of a benefit for me than for your guys." he said.
Dean rested his hand on Cas's shoulder, afraid that if he kept stroking his hair then he would definitely fall asleep. "Well, they'd understand, but it's up to you." He replied. "I know it's hard, but it'll get better." He added in an attempt to be reassuring.
They were standing by the door before there was a little note stuck to the window, "Meet us in room 004 - C&K" it read.
Lisa sat down on the bed with him in her hand and held him up so they were eye-level and they just talked. It was mostly about Dean.
Dean opened his eyes fully as he felt the sudden cold where Cas had been before he grinned and chuckled. "That's a good idea." He commented as Cas settled back onto him, wrapping his arms around him when he felt him shiver to help him warm up again.
Dean woke up starving, having worked up a good appetite from earlier. He glanced down at Cas and smiled, feeling warm, comfortable, and content. He moved over slightly to lightly kiss Cas's forehead, debating on whether he should let Cas rest longer.
He hummed softly, looking down at Dean. "We'll have to change that won't we?" he smiled.
Dean was unsurprised to wake up first, knowing Cas would still be dead tired. He laid with him for a while, tracing across Cas's bare back with his fingertips and lightly stroking his hair.
"I'm glad it's still good enough. Not quite up to par with the things you usually cook, but not bad." Dean replied with a laugh as he ate. He thought of school as little as possible, though the constant nagging in the back of his mind made it difficult.
Sam laughed before they got their menus and talked over their foods and everything else. Sam had listed out things they needed on the trip, had things planned, even more so than Dean was. He didn’t know if he should be impressed, feel stupid, or glad that his brother did this instead of him.
Dean glanced up to see Cas's face and moaned softly around him, his expression and the tug at his hair sending a wave of want through him. He began taking more of Cas in his mouth slowly, swallowing continuously to move all the way down to the base before pulling back again and repeating the process.
Castiel smiled at him, rolling his eyes endearingly. "Food fanatic." he mumbled.
Dean pressed up against Cas, his hand moving from around Cas's waist to clutch against the wall. His hand trailed down from Cas's hair down over his shoulder and across his chest.
"It's nice to hear you compliment my teaching." Dean replied with a smile. "Although you're a pretty good student too. So do you want to try to hit a few more?" He asked, gesturing to the other few cans.
Dean leaned into the touch despite himself, placing his hands over Castiel's. "Why Cas…." he said quietly.
“It’s not an IT, Sam. It’s Cas.” Dean retorted before staring at his brother. “I know him. Better than you and I know that this is better for the both of us.” he said. “You saw how I was and now I’m getting myself back together. If things go wrong, I’m sure you’ll be the first to tell me.”
Dean continued to rest his forehead against Cas's while he caught his breath, slowly raising his head to glance at Cas and smiled slightly. He slowly eased himself out of Cas with a soft exhale and rolled onto his side so that he could wrap his arms around Cas loosely.
"That's alright, I like your normal hair anyway." Dean replied with a smile, slick in Cas's hair down again. "Then again, more showers wouldn't be so bad." He added with a grin, rinsing his hands under the water again.
Castiel chuckled, "I don't believe there would be bears around here." he said at Dean's exaggeration. "And yes, that would have ruined thanksgiving." he added before getting into the impala and looking over at Dean who smiled at him. "I believe you have to sing to me as payment for today." he said while he smiled.
Dean drove out to the store quickly, getting out with the list in his hand. Thankfully, there wasn't much on the list, and he knew where it all was. He made his round through the store, occasionally glancing at the time and wondering how Cas was doing, before he had everything they needed and went to check out. He glanced at his phone again as he waited in line, relieved that it hadn't been /too/ long.
"I like that thought too." Dean replied with a smile, wrapping his arm with the ice cream around Cas's middle to hold the bowl while he picked up the spoon with the other. He scooped some up and made like he was going to feed it to Cas before moving it around and tasting a little himself. "Gotta make sure it's still good." He teased before he actually held it out for Cas.
"I heard that." Charlie pushed him.
"Anytime." Castiel told him. He kissed Dean's forehead again. "You're so wonderful Dean." He murmured. He hugged Dean closer with his free arm while he brushed his hair with the other.
Dean made a face at Sam's smile, glad he didn't comment on their position. "Yeah, I think it's be best to order something in. I dunno how long Cas is going to sleep." He replied softly. "He had a pretty bad attack today." He added even more quietly.
"Okay let's go." Charlie smiled. "Should we take one car or no?" She asked.
When the door opened, he smiled a little. "Hey Lis." he said.
"Yeah, of course." Charlie grinned.
"Mmm, maybe we can sneak out somewhere together one day and not worry about it." Castiel offered. "We did probably have a lot of want pented up from not having much sexual activities in for a month I believe." he told him. They were still holding onto each other, still feeling Dean inside of him. He was riddled with bites and hickies, they were all over his neck and shoulders while Dean only had a few. "We were in such a rush we forgot about condoms and I was too far pleased to realize that you hadn't. You've cum in me 3 times today, 4 if I count the impala." he said, wiggling his hips a little to show his point. He could feel some dribble out and he let out a soft sound. "I don't feel disgusted though. It's different. A lot more intimate..."
"Well, the food is definitely a plus." Dean teased lightly wrote smiling softly. "I don't know if I can pick just one thing, but your love is definitely the best thing I have. Everything that comes along with that, the confidence, food, gifts, all of those are bonuses." He answered.
Dean blinked, adjusting again to the light. He just ate and drank his coffee in the silence. He occasionally eyed the guy, he didn’t even know his name. He looked down at the name tag on his lab coat but he couldn’t read it all. “Cas.” he said.
Dean rolled out of bed a good deal later, groaning that he had only a few minutes to go catch the bus. He jumped up to go get ready, inhaled a bowl of cereal, and showered quickly before jogging downstairs to his bus stop.
Dean smiled slightly against his skin, rolling it between his teeth and kissing it. He rose again to kiss Cas to help him stay quiet, teasing the other nipple with his fingers as he continued to stroke Cas and run his thumb along the underside.
Castiel laughed with him, "I can show you, if you would like to put me down." He smiled. "I don't mind either but I was wondering why you picked me up." He commented, looking at Dean affectionately. "Plus we have to pick up our clothes, hopefully I won't leak too much."
Dean poked him again, "Buddy, wake up. Time to get back in the tank." he said.
"No of course not. He knows that you love him." Castiel smiled a but as he reached up and stroked Dean's cheek. "I love you Dean." He said softly. "I really do." He glanced at him with sincerity and honesty. His voice was quiet but it was just them.
Kevin sighed, going with her and laughing at her weird dancing. Sam bumped them and they danced, laughing at their weird dancing. Castiel glanced at Dean, twirling his fingers a little.
Dean nodded, picking up a shirt and starting to fold. "Yeah, we'll probably get done in no time. Thanks again, by the way. You helped clean my room, made me food, did my laundry- I almost feel kinda guilty for you doing all that." He said.
Dean hummed in pleasure against Cas's skin, looking up through his lashes to see Cas's reactions. He moaned softly, always aroused by seeing Cas so clearly affected. He moved his hand against the panties, rubbing Cas slightly through the soft fabric and rocking his hips slightly against the bed. He continued to kiss and lap at Cas's nipples, knowing those were always so sensitive.
Dean thought of it before nodding slightly. "But remember to keep hydrated."
Dean pulled away from the hug to look Cas in the eye, but kept close. "Cas, it's not possible for me to ever be disgusted by you at all." He hooked his finger underneath his chin to stop him from looking down. "I don't care about the bruises or anything else. I just care that it's you." He replied, tightening his arm around Cas.
Castiel smiled at the gesture before taking his bag and the pie before getting out of the car. "Are you planning to save your pie or are you going to eat it?" He asked. They were walking back to the house when he asked.
"I am!" Castiel replied a bit too quickly. "I'm just waiting to see how you like it." he added more softly, looking up at Dean.
"Yeah." said Dean before going to the staircase and calling up for the two who came down a few moments after he walked back in the kitchen. Castiel has set up plates as Dean called them and set them on the table with silverware.
Jo nodded a little. "Alright. Okay. Well I'll be back. Ash will bring your drinks." She said, leaving.
"Sorry, sorry. Hold on." he said before draining the water a little and put warmer water into the sink after taking out his toothbrush. He was a little confused on why it was there but figured it was the little troublemaker that was sitting in his hand.
Balthazar smiled, hearing Cas laugh a little. "Yeah you? Kidnapping Dean? Please." he rolled his eyes. "So things are...better between you two?" he asked.
"Clearly I'm sitting next to the most attractive, and I'm almost swooning." Dean murmured to Cas with a grin as the movie started.
Dean felt a shiver run up him at Cas's words, more than ready to take him up on that. Dean pressed into the kiss, not wanting to be able to think of anything other than Cas's hand in his hair, his lips against his, just Cas. He focused solely on the taste and feel of him, completely willing to have Cas keep his control over it.
Dean glanced over at Cas, brow furrowing in concern as he turned back to the road. "Are you okay?" He asked, wanting to know what Cas thought he saw but not wanting to push him. "You can talk to me if you want to." He offered.
Sam glanced at his laptop, "I'm going to start booting this up and setting it up. Really, thanks guys." he said gratefully. He sat down on the couch and started to plug it in before he started setting up.
Castiel's eyes widened a little and he made a small surprised sound and the tug. He slowly smiled after that and kissed Dean back. He opened his eyes a little before leaning back and away from Dean's kiss. He smiled the playful smile he had before. He just leaned back as Dean held his arms away from the kiss and Dean's face.
Dean felt a sudden fear grip him, and he tried to get a Cas to meet his gaze. "Cas, stop, don't say that. It's going to be fine, okay? I don't want anyone else." He said desperately. Cas couldn't leave him. He just couldn't. Dean wouldn't be able to handle knowing that Cas had left him on his own free will, with no one else forcing him. "Cas, please." He whispered, wishing he would meet his gaze.
"You're the biggest dumbass ever Dean." Pamela sighed, resting her head on her hand. "You never gave Cas at all a change during this whole project did you? You didn't even attempt." she started and Dean started to speak up before Pamela just rolled on. "I seriously don't get why you couldn't see it. Ever since you started that project, Cas has never once said that he wanted a new partner or that he felt awkward because he wanted YOU to be his partner and do this project with him. Dean, do you even know the name of the baby?"
Castiel whimpered, dropping his head onto Dean's shoulder and panting. His body twitched in the aftershocks and he was dazed. He shivered, holding onto Dean a bit more loosely now. Making soft sounds at the small bursts of pleasure after and whining at the lost of his fingers.
"Why would I take the biggest slice? If I cut it, I would plan to cut them all evenly." Castiel looked at Dean with a slight head tilt.
Castiel glanced up at Dean before holding the last bite of muffin he had to Dean and cradled his other hand underneath it so it would drop any crumbs. Sam glanced at the, before smiling a little. "Yeah, thanks for the muffin guys. I'm going to take it upstairs and finish my homework then." he said before walking upstairs with a small laugh.
"Mm, how about we take it home?" Dean offered.
Dean smiled and laced his fingers through Cas's as they left the arcade. "Okay, ice cream it is. That definitely sounds awesome right now." He added with a chuckle, only letting go of Cas's hand to get in the car.
"What you're going to ask me to serve him some drinks next? You just said he was welcome here any time, shouldn't that say enough already?" Bobby looked at him with a certain look.
The more he talked about it, the clearer the memories came to him and he realized how cruel life was to him. How much he had gone through and he was only 17. Why was life so difficult? Why did people want to put him down? He felt the emotions well in him, anger, sadness, hatred, confusion. Why? Why him? He sat there, trying to collect himself. He wasn't used to expressing so many emotions, even when he was by himself. When he was with Dean, everything just came to the surface, the worst and the best of him would bloom. He took a few deep breaths, trying not to let the emotions get to him. He felt Dean squeeze his hand and rubbing his thumb across his knuckles. He found the strength to continue.
"I know you would, Cas, but I wouldn't want you too." Dean replied quietly. "I don't want you to have to go through this. Besides, less people will try to bully me than they would to you. And if I wait to go back with you and they do what they did today, you might have an attack before we can get away. That would only make it worse for you." He said. He knew Cas wanted to save him from what he had been through, but Dean was determined to protect him from this.
"Oh yeah, I can see that." Dean said with a grin, following Cas's finger. "Oh hey, that one kinda looks like a bee!" He said excitedly, knowing Cas would like that- even if it was a little bit of a stretch.
"They took care of me that night, I fell asleep next to Jo, having a blanket curled around me. I didn't go to school for the next few days. I just spent it at the diner with Jo, Ellen, and Ash. I helped around and they fed me. Everyone was nice there, everyone was different than what I was used to. They were so...open, full of life, kindness. Once there was a fight that broke out, Ellen would be there to break it up. She was so…" Castiel stopped for a moment to think of the right words to express his feelings. "Powerful and confident that people just... listened. I wanted to be exactly her. Strong and brave, being able to hold myself up with pride. I would come by there every night after that, from gymnastics and to have someone to spend time with..but then I was forced to transfer schools again. I was a junior. I didn't talk much to Jo after that, I would try but I didn't have time to."
"Well one dance couldn't hurt. Plus...if he was such a great date, he would be able to keep your attention anyways." Balthazar told him. He spun Castiel and caught his other hand and leaned over his ear, "I'm pretty sure, somewhere in this crowd. Green little eyes are watching." he teased.
"Sounds good to me." Dean replied with a smile, walking with Cas back out of the bedroom. "I'm really glad you arranged all this, Cas. It's incredible. I feel like I got a whole birthday weekend to celebrate instead of just a day." He said, amazed at how different everything was from just one year ago.
"Oh...that's good to hear." Balthazar shrugged.
"Yeah, thanks." Dean replied with a chuckle, glancing over at the clock and packing away the containers back in his bag. Only a few more periods until gym, and he was more eager than ever to get this over with.
Castiel slowly started again after a few more moments, "They had gagged me and I was held face down, they held onto my hands... They...They were taking pictures of my face but they had put a wig on my head so that I looked different...They just cared about my blue eyes, they would say such revolting things to me... Even compliments sounded disgusting. I thrashed around, kicking and squirming...They had just punched me to tell me to shut up. I bit through the pain and caused enough racket where a teacher found them. I transferred schools again."
The little octopus clicked and squealed before swimming a little circle and pressing against the glass again at Dean with a smile himself.
It was ridiculous that he felt this way- he and Cas would have a good time. It was that simple. He fidgeted with his tie again before deciding that he looked the best he possibly could and heading out the door, a glance over at Cas's room telling him he should wait downstairs. He stood at the foot of the stairs with his hands in his pockets, trying to ease the fluttering of anticipation in his chest.
Castiel smiled, scrunching his face up slightly and shied away from the kisses with a giggle. "No, that tickles." He said, lightly pushing Dean's face from his neck and face.
"Okay. It's a draw." Castiel replied. He was looking down at Dean and he was just staring a bit, "Your eyes change colors for the season..." he stared, noticing it a bit. "They're aren't actually that green now, they're almost like a whiskey brown color." he said. It was contrast to the snow around them and he was just staring down at Dean with a wonderment look. He smiled a bit, "They're still very captivating." he complimented.
Castiel looked at him, "If you would like...Anna comes home in an hour or so, if you don't need to be home right now then she would give you a ride home." he offered.
"It's very courteous of you, but I have offered Dean. It's no problem to me. If you can help me cook and help me carry some of the bags, we can call it even." Castiel smiled. They had pulled up to the store and were just waiting. "I think I know what most thanksgiving dinners have but what do you think that you guys will like for it?" He asked, reaching for the handle.
Castiel spit out the blood he drew, he looked up at Dean. "I will not apologize for something I didn't do wrong."
Castiel smiled up at him, "That was a really fantastic date...but I don't know. Do I kiss on the first date?" he asked, eyes flickering down to Dean's lips before back to his eyes. His free hand was playing with Dean's tie as he licked his lips a little. "I guess I'll make an exception for how much of a gentleman you are. I think you've earned it. I expect a second date." he laughed lightly before tugging on Dean's tie to kiss him.
Castiel stretched out a little before it finally sank in. He sat up, "It's Christmas." he repeated. He grinned over at Dean, "I'm awake." he said, feeling the excitement from Dean rubbing off on him.
Castiel didn't look at Dean, he just continued to his next question. "Yes. That's what I told you. For all the times I have been bullied or you have gotten close to hurting someone, what did I do?" he asked another question.
Dean moaned into his mouth, surprisingly turned on by Cas taking some control. He got to the bed, putting one knee on it and leaning forward so that Cas was partial sitting and partially holding on to him still. His hand stayed firmly on Cas's back as the other skirted up and down his thigh.
Bobby smiled, glad Cas liked it, before looking over at Dean. Dean arched a brow, wondering what the gift could be, before he pulled back the wrapping carefully. He grinned as he held up a totem necklace from the top, looking at the totem before smiling at Sam. "This is great, Sammy. I love it." He replied, putting it on and glancing down at it happily, also seeing a few shirts. He walked over and grabbed Sam's gift and handed it to him. "I'm pretty sure you'll like this." He said, fiddling with the necklace idly as he sat back down.
Castiel huffed, "What is it Balthazar?" He said before looking up at the teacher and she had her hand out. He sighed before handing her his phone and she said to get it back after class.
"I usually wake up early, now I wake up in the middle of both our times." Castiel laughed. He pressed his face against Dean's neck and blew a light raspberry and kissed the skin after with a bright smile.
“What do you mean?” Dean asked with a cheek full of food.
Dean looked over at Sam fondly, wondering if he really did know. He hoped so. He turned back to Cas and smiled. "Yeah, I really do. I was kinda freaking out." He admitted with a chuckle.
They walked into the house together and Sam popped into the kitchen. Castiel glanced up at him as he came in. "Do you guys need help cooking? I'm not really doing anything, just wondering if you guys need another pair of hands." he asked.
"You." Dean replied teasingly. "Okay, how about chest? Is that specific enough?" He asked, sitting forward as Cas crawled over to him.
Castiel looked at Dean with a slight tilt of the head and a little bit of a disbelieving face. "You don't realize how much you really teach me do you?" he laughed a little. "Confidence, bravery, family, affection, self-worth, strength, and a lot more things. Dean, you might not notice but you've taught me a lot of things already. I haven't even been able to teach you much besides a few things about cooking. You're doing a lot more than you think you are and I feel that you should know that, you have a lot more to offer than the few things that you think." he told Dean. "You're a good person Dean, you just need to be able to see it yourself."
Dean immediately stopped, feeling a rush of guilt. He didn't think about how Cas felt about all of this when he was too busy consumed with lust and want. This was Cas's first time, he should have taken it slower. "We can wait it's fine. I'm sorry for rushing you. Did I make you uncomfortable?" He asked concerned. He leaned back slightly, trying to calm down Cas and give him space.
Castiel smiled at him, "Thank you for ordering." he said.
"H-HEY!" Dean protested in surprise as he fell back against the bed against the bed again, laughing. "Now- you're- ch-cheating!" He managed to splutter around fits of laughter, trying to roll away from Cas and his fingers.
They chatted a bit, laughing a little and smiling. They only had brief contact here and there and both of them were very aware of them touching each other. Eventually Castiel got pulled away and he reluctantly left Dean.
I'm very sorry for the super late update, writer's block and homework and everything. Hectic. But most of the time, It's because I can't sit down and write so thank you for sticking by the story and I'm sorry again for being late.
Dean laughed as he watched Cas get their work. "Yeah, I wasn't technically a boy scout, but whatever." He said. "I think I can get a lot of these right. Especially now that I have some motivation." He continued, feeling pretty confident.
Castiel arched a brow, "Distracted by me? What were you distracted by?" He asked. They were just standing in the kitchen together and it was nice.
Castiel laughed a little in his neck, "Did you wanted to get them now? Then you don't have to worry about them later." He offered. "Or get them later." He said. "Once I have you and I'm comfortable, I wouldn't want to let you go." He added.
"Yeah, we're really glad you're here." Dean chimed in with a smile. "Hopefully it'll be the best kind of obnoxious a holiday can be." He added, chuckling. "I know it'll definitely be more fun with you here."
"Good. You belong in my arms." Castiel looked up at him and smiled brightly. He leaned up and gave Dean a kiss on the cheek. "Are you complaining about being in my arms?" He asked.
Sam laughed, "This place is going to get lively huh?" he said.
Charlie laughed a little, "Why did he have to bend over backwards Dean? Is there something you want to say?" she arched a brow with a devious look.
Dean scratched his chin too and Castiel melted into his hand, his color changing back to his happier one. He cooed softly and clicked. He rubbed his head against Dean's finger. "Dean..."
Castiel was grinning, his eyes crinkled around the corner just slightly and his eyes were bright. They were nothing like they were this morning or how he was acting. He kissed the corner of Dean's smile. He just hugged Dean and smiled at him. He gently kissed Dean's bruise and the rest of his face. "I love you Dean." he smiled. "I should have said Dean Winchester." he teased lightly.
"Okay let's go cook." Dean said before going to the kitchen.
“Oh really? I doubt that, you haven’t been in a relationship seriously since Lisa.” Sam pointed out.
This was was harder to swim for Castiel, harder to see and slower than how he usually does but even then, he swam quickly. Dean saw the place they came from get smaller and smaller before Castiel turned and it was cut out of his sites. The area was by cliffs.
Castiel let out a deep breath after they were done before looking over at Dean, "That...that was AMAZING!" he said excitedly before pulling Dean out of the car with him. "Oh, I hated the pause before it dropped and then the feeling of my stomach dropping but seeing everything look so small and the wind, and everything. Wow." He babbled with adrenaline.
"Well I've had a lot more practice, but that's still really impressive. I mean it's been a while since you've even held a gun and it's your second time, but you managed to hit a can." Dean replied, grinning. He was proud that he'd been the one to teach Cas and that he was already so good. "No problem, I like showing you, especially when you turn out to be this good."
Castiel smiled in delight, glad that Dean told the truth. He kissed Dean's forehead before mouthing against Dean's neck.
Dean sighed softly, petting Cas once before closing the lid of his tank and started heading to the bathroom. "I'm starting to think I'm spoiling you too much Cas." he laughed slightly under his breath.
Oh god...what just happened?
Castiel gasped in his mouth, holding onto Dean more tightly. He moaned softly in his mouth, feeling excitement bubble with a bit of anticipation. He tangled his hand in Dean's hair, kissing him back with some roughness. He scooted closer and adjusted his legs apart on either side of Dean.
Castiel swallowed a bit before opening his legs in front of Dean slightly and bent his knees a little. He timidly reached in between his legs and lightly rubbed his index finger over the head. He hadn't ever touched himself before and it was different. He looked at Dean to see if he was doing okay before lightly stroking himself and sighing a little at the feeling. He felt more aroused now and he continued to keep a soft stroke as he became slightly harder. "Ah...what do I keep in my pockets for Gabriel?" He asked.
Dean followed behind him. "We definitely want to hear you sing." He said as he walked up beside him. "Besides, you got to hear me sing like three times now. Only fair." He said.
"She's really beautiful so I hope that you think of your frustrations being paid off when she's finished." Castiel smiled. "I think too much. Sometimes it's nice but sometimes I just want to stop." He said, stopping in their tracks. He gently took Dean's other hand and leaned up to kiss him. "You're the perfect distraction and getaway." He said softly.
"Alright, I need to try some of this incredible pie." Bobby said, going over and cutting himself a slice. "Mm, that really is pretty impressive. Thanks for making it." He said to Cas. Dean nodded in obvious agreement.
They all stayed in their costumes that night. Sam was a moose, one because he lost a bet and he thought it was funny. Charlie was a queen warrior and she had a lot of girls come up to her to tell her how great she looked. She really enjoyed Halloween that day. Kevin was dressed as an agent, he wanted to look really cool. Gabriel just went as himself and put on a devil's ear headband and tail and called it day. Sometime during that night Castiel and Dean slipped away. They somehow ended up having sex. Castiel kept the wings after that, figuring to keep it as a souvenir and because Dean liked them a lot. They spent the night just cuddling and fell asleep upstairs when everyone fell asleep downstairs.
"Goodnight Dean..." He said softly.
"I'll be waiting for you when you get back. It's only a few things." Castiel told him. He felt his heart squeeze a little at Dean saying that he didn't care for what others said. He kissed Dean's cheek before getting a small post it and writing a few things on it with a pen that was connected to the fridge. He handed Dean the small note. "If you need help finding them, or have any questions on it, call me." He said.
Dean returned the soft kiss tenderly before breaking of and meeting Cas's gaze. "I love you too." He replied, taking a slow breath of contentment. He kissed Cas again, still hardly believing that Cas would want to spend so much time with him or would be so thrilled to be a part of their admittedly strange family.
Castiel caught them, "I don't mind." He chuckled. He slipped the t-shirt on and then the boxers before taking off the towel. They were a little loose on his hips but the t-shirt covered it hanging on his hips. "Where should I put the towel?" He asked. "Also I'm sorry about your pillowcase." He said.
Deans grin widened, setting aside the work without a second thought. He reached up and grabbed a lower branch, pulling himself and on top. He smiled down at Cas and offered him a hand. "Alright, let's climb your first tree!"
Dean arched a brow slightly at Cas's explanation, feeling a blush rise to his cheeks. "As a moan, huh? I have to admit, I think I like that the most too." He replied with a smile, liking Cas's explanation more than any of his nicknames for him.
Dean grinned. "That sounds like a challenge." He replied, arching a brow. "Are you challenging a customer?" He joked.
Castiel sighed softly, "I'm okay...when did they say we were going to...?" he asked. He was still a bit flustered, but he wanted to know what the others thought.
"It's alright, if I minded then I would have insisted we go inside." Dean replied with a shrug, leaning his chin on Cas's shoulder. "It won't be hard to clean up, anyway." He added, taking a slow breath.
Dean smiled, wrapping his arm around him. "I'd be okay with that." He replied with a grin. "You're pretty comfortable, so I don't mind."
Dean smiled when Cas covered his eyes and returned the kiss softly, not bothering to try to pull away the blanket over his eyes. He grinned as Cas kept kissing, feeling a rush of warm affection and love. He didn't mind not being able to see Cas, because of course he trusted him completely.
Kevin laughed, "It's okay if you don't, it's not that big of a deal. It's just funny." He told him.
Castiel hugged Dean closely, putting his head into Dean's neck. "I did. It was very sweet of you to cook for me." he said. "I'm very touched." he added, smiling a little. "Besides, your pillow can't talk to me like you can. I would be even more lonely." he replied.
"Yes sir." Castiel smiled softly, squeezing Dean gently before they slowly drifted to sleep.
Castiel blushed a little, twirling his fingers a little. He glanced at Dean, "Did you want to share with me? I can ask her not to bring it if you don't." He said.
Dean wrapped his arms around Cas's shoulders, holding him against his chest. He'd never been as miserable as he had been when Cas was away, spending the whole time wondering what had happened to him and if he was even coming back. "I missed you too." He replied softly, his hand rising to rest against the back of his head.
Dean met Cas's eyes with a soft smile, feeling more sincerely hopeful. "Yeah, we'll make it." He agreed, glancing around at them all. If there was anyone who could make this year enjoyable, it would be all of them. He couldn't say for certain if they would stay as close as they were now, but he knew that they would always be friends when it mattered.
Castiel smiled, holding onto Dean. "It sound great. Anything with you sounds great." he chuckled a little. They were just lying there, breathing quietly. Castiel was thinking now that he was lying there in Dean's arms, stealing a glance at his desk over Dean before looking up at him." Do you want to read some of my writing?" he asked after a few moments. "I know you're not much of a reader and it's okay to say no, but I just thought of it." he said. He kept his notebooks filled with words in his desk, stacks of them.
"Sounds good to me." Bobby replied with a smile, moving beside Dean to get a plate.
Castiel hummed softly, "Let's make chicken noodle soup." He said. He started walking around, glancing at things. He grabbed carrots, celery, onions, and garlic as he went. He looked at Dean as he checked between two onions on which one he wants more before bagging it up and putting it in a basket. "Do you think we should make a side dish?" He asked.
The guys looked at each other, "We better get the fuck out before someone catches us." the buzzed hair one said.
Charlie could be heard squealing upstairs. Charlie practically gleamed when she came back, "This is the best thing ever! Gentlemen Cassie." she said. She bounced a little, gesturing over. Castiel slowly stepped in, blushing deeply. He was wearing cowgirl boots a pair of shorts and a cropped tied white button up. Charlie applied makeup to him so they couldn't see the bruises. He had accessories also on his wrist and necklace. He had a bow in his hair too.
Sorry for the extremely late update, I've been in a writing slump and didn't really want to write for my longer series but I finally pushed through it! Got the chapter out and am trying to get back into the writing jazz. Thanks for anyone who continued reading this and the support.
There's obviously sex in this one, Cas has both male and female parts, so if that grosses you out, ya probably can just skip it. It's just smut at the way end anyways. -shrugs-
"You certainly are hostile for just meeting someone." Benny commented.
Dean kept himself up with his elbow, his other hand carding through Cas's hair. The bites sent a shiver down his spine, stirring his arousal.
He took the chicken out and ripped it into small pieces. He had cut up potatoes from earlier and put them in a separate place before he poured some eggs on the lightly oiled pan and watch the bottom cook. He put all the ingredients on top of it and waited for them to cook a little before he took the spatula and flipped them over slightly and rolled it up. He turned it down a little and flipped it again to let it cook. He had set up another pan beside him and had the oil cooking and had put the potatoes in it.
"I started another school in the middle of the year, I was more reluctant to talk to people, but I had a cousin who went to school with me. Samandriel. He was just as an easy victim as I was. He kept to himself and didn't involve himself with others. He would occasionally talk to me and we became friends. News from my other two schools caught up with this one and I started to get bullied again. Once people knew I was friends with Samandriel, they would bully him too. Threaten him. He stopped talking to me. I couldn't have been upset because it was rational. It happened many times. Any friends I would have would get caught in the bullying too." he looked down, squeezing Dean's hand.
"Of course." Dean replied with a smile before he reached up and grabbed the first branch, pulling himself up and leaning down to offer Cas his hand much like the first time they'd climbed up. "So now this is your second time climbing a tree."
Dean frowned, trying to think of a way to simplify it. "Okay, so you've got two things that make you connect with someone- how hot they are to you and how they think. If you've got just the hotness, there's not any real feelings and it's just for fun. If it's just thinking, then it's friendship. And if it's both, it's an actual relationship." He said, thinking it through as he talked.
The bell rang and Dean was immediately out of the classroom, walking in the direction of Cas's classroom before he even realize where he was going. He stopped, hesitating, before he turned and walked towards the class where they were going to eat. He felt completely empty without Cas by his side, and he immediately regretted not going to walk with him. He was completely confused on what was going on, but he hoped having other people around at lunch would somehow help.
Kevin looked at Castiel, "Just get it started." He said.
"Hmm, so a back rub..." Dean began, stroking his hand across Cas's back a few times before moving up to brush his fingers in his hair. "Hair petting... And a kiss." He added, tilting Cas's chin up gently with his other hand to kiss him softly. "Is it working?" He asked with a smile.
"I don't want that either. I want you, and no other girl- or guy for that matter. You're the only one for me." Dean replied softly, kissing Cas's cheek tenderly. "I'm sorry I hurt you. I never wanted that." He apologized again, rushing away his tears as they fell.
"I am not making a rash choice. I know what choice I am making." Castiel replied. "Take me back to the water." he said.
Dean's jaw clenched as he glared at them, bitter hate rising in his chest. "Get the fuck off of me, or you won't have a dick for anyone to ride." He threatened, his hands curling into fists around the grocery bags. He wanted to get home, to Cas, and there was no way he was going to let these assholes stop him.
Castiel slowly peered out and looked at the many things before he was sitting on the edge of Dean's shoulder to look. He was pointing at a particular rock thing that was kind of like a cave, it was for hermits but Castiel wanted it. He squeaked at Dean, pointing his tentacle.
Castiel looked at him after, staring into Dean’s green eyes that held a fondness that made his stomach jump. That look was for him. That Dean was looking at him like that. He snuggled in for another hug.
"Scouts honor." Dean replied solemnly, holding up two fingers. "Now let's go get started so I can see just how interesting you're going to make it." He added with a grin.
Dean thought about it, remembering the first day Cas had gotten beat up under the tree in the courtyard. "Yeah, if anyone ever tries to grab you or something, try to jab them with your elbows or kick them in the shins. Other than that," he shrugged, "You should be good, hopefully."
Castiel smiled, Dean always loved making him happy. Giving into his little requests. He loved the sweet side of Dean, he loved all versions of Dean that he has come to know, protective, jealous, playful, sad, angry, all of them. He wanted to figure them all out and love them. Dean loved to take care of him and it made his heart flutter at such kindness.
Castiel smiled, leaning forward and taking another kiss. "I guess I needed just a bit more." he laughed softly.
After Castiel left Dean and Sam to go search around for John, he would always come up empty. He didn't give up hope and optimism, he continued searching, following the stores that Sam had told him to. He mentally crossed them off as he check around, as he was walking down around the corner, he bumped into a group of people. "Oh excuse me." he apologized. He looked up to see a group of older teenage boys.
"We can take one if you want. We all fit last time and no one messed my baby up as far as I could tell." Dean replied with a little chuckle as he grabbed his keys and went outside. He walked quickly to the impala and got in, starting up the engine to let everything warm up while he waited for everyone to get in.
Castiel panted, making soft sounds as Dean kissed his skin. He listened to what Dean told him to do and turned around, placing his hands on the wall. He shivered in anticipation, he glanced over his shoulder at Dean, trying to calm his breathing.
Dean rushed through the crowd of people, pushing out of the doors and glanced quickly around. He saw Cas's figure hurriedly retreating and started jogging after him. "Cas! Cas, wait up." He called, picking up his pace to try and catch up to him more quickly.
Dean wrapped his arms around Cas, hugging him close. "It's okay. I'll make you breakfast whenever you want and they can come back some other time. You didn't ruin anything." He told him softly.
“D-Dean….Dean, you’re….you’re so deep…” Castiel could feel the other against his hilt and he was trembling, his hole going wild at the feeling.
"Mm, right. Let's wash up then." Dean replied, sitting up slightly and stretching out with a hum of satisfaction at the feeling. "D'you want a shower or bath?" He asked, glancing back at Cas as he sat on the edge of the bed, figuring he could get the water running if Cas wanted either.
Dean pressed his lips together, "Alright thanks Ash." he sighed, already hanging up before Ash could tell him that he doesn't really know what happens if he tried to tell Cas he wasn't his mate.
Dean smiled as the story progressed, all his worries and troubles forgotten for time being as he continued to read each message that Cas sent. He didn't have much to say between Cas's messages, but Dean wanted him to know that he was still reading and legitimately curious about how the story was going to continue.
It's a short chapter, sorry friends. I'll try to update soon.
The others stood in the doorway after catching up, Charlie, Kevin, and Sam grinned at him. Castiel quickly put aside his book, jogging over and wrapped his arms around Dean's neck, embracing him. "Yes. I'm very surprised. I'm also really happy." he muttered into Dean.
Castiel looked over at Dean with a bright smile, "Today is going to be fun." He said happily.
"I am a series of objects." Castiel laughed, smiling after Dean kissed him. "I am needed for your bedroom to be perfect." he teased. He looked at Dean before just feeling a bubble of affection and just wanting to kiss Dean. He started placing soft kisses over Dean's face and peppering his face in kisses as he giggled.
"Well, we /can/ be apart. I just don't want to be." Dean replied with a chuckle, lacing his fingers at the small of Cas's back to hold him as well. "But I'll see you every passing period and at lunch. And this time you can sit by me." He added, not wanting Balthazar to get between them like he had yesterday.
Castiel whimpered against the wall, he pushed his hips out more, taking more of Dean in. He panted at Dean's words, feeling a shiver run through him again as his cock spurted just a bit more precum from the strain. He bit the gag, moaning as he met each of Dean's rocking with his own.
"Are you sure you can handle all of me?" Castiel asked, smiling bashfully at him. "Are you substituting your pie dessert for me?" He asked. "I don't taste as sweet nor am I topped with whipped cream." He said as he tried to figure out what he wanted to eat.
"...Truth?" she said again.
Castiel walked in the class when he heard his phone go off, he looked to see Dean's text. He sat down at an empty table.
"I wish we could too...it's only a few months. We'll make it." Castiel murmured. He placed soft kisses on Dean's neck, "Mmm, sorry for today...I still feel bad that I didn't trust you enough." He said quietly.
"You...you aren't disgusted or anything are you?" Castiel asked softly, not looking at them. A look of shock went through all their faces.
"What no way! What did he do?" The person with a ponytail asked.
Castiel quickly jumped up and shuffled over to Dean and quickly embraced him and brought him close.
"Good. We all can be, together." Sam laughed, putting on the brown reindeer one. "Sorry if they don't fit, I was measuring by eye." he said.
Castiel stared back at Dean, feeling the soft flutter in his heart. He leaned forward slightly and kissed Dean, his eyes still slightly open to look at Dean. He pulled back after, "I know what you mean when you say the way you look at me." he replied. "I love the way you look at me." he told him.
Castiel smiled a little before he thought about it, "You have expected only the worst to happen?" he asked. "Why?"
Dean followed Cas as quickly as he could, nearly losing him a few times because of the turns he made, but always able to figure out which way to go after a few moments. His breathing was becoming labored, but he knew he had to get to Cas, figure out what exactly he was thinking and reassure him of whatever he was afraid of. Dean was falling slightly behind from trying to find his way after Cas, but he kept going regardless and hoped Cas was heading to his house like it seemed.
Samandriel bowed, taking Castiel's hand and leading him to the dance floor and placing his hand on his waist. Castiel stood apart from him and put his hand on his shoulder and they talked a bit as they danced easily across the floor. Samandriel spun Castiel a few times and dipped him and made a few comments that Castiel blushed and stood back up and stood his distance.
Dean deepened the kiss for a moment, wrapping his arm around Cas to hold him close before he broke off again, moving to kiss his jaw. "So... What are we going to cross off our list first?" Dean asked between a few kisses trailing down Cas's neck.
Dean didn't make any more comments, deciding not to test Cas's more dominant mood. He just focused on the bites Cas left on his skin and enjoyed it. He opened his mouth obediently when Cas instructed, glancing at the can and back to Cas.
"I hope so. I don't want to have a bad one on you." Castiel replied. "Unless having intercourse is a bad influence, then I would let that one slide." He laughed.
"I can't spend the day naked Dean." Castiel laughed lightly. "I still need to cook later." he told him. He snuggled in closer to Dean and pressed his head into the crevice of his neck and sighed softly.
"Mm, yeah." Dean agreed, waiting another moment before he sat up and gently untangled himself from Cas. "Need a lift?" He asked with a grin, slowly moving off of the bed and standing as he glanced back at Cas. He figured Cas wouldn't be as exhausted as some of the times, but he might as well offer anyway.
"No way, I'm going to let you get with the shit end of the stick. Being shoved with whoever is last because they aren't wanted. No way." Dean shook his head.
Sam shook his head, "You're on your own." he said.
Castiel tipped his head a little to the side, "It suits you in a way. You look very beautiful Dean." he smiled. "Though it's a little upsetting that you're more than 4 inches taller than me now." he said.
Kevin hummed before he shrugged, "Whatever." he ran and jumped, making a star jump before tucking himself in and landing. "Dean, your turn." Kevin said as he resurfaced. So far Gabriel made the biggest splash and best entrance.
"Mmmm." Castiel moaned softly. He felt good, tilting his head to the side a little as he lifted his hips again. He pulled at his hair, running a hand up his back and tracing his skin.
Dean felt slightly relieved as they started to jog- safe for now. "So we're just doing drills. Shouldn't be too bad."
Castiel nodded, "I'm sorry. I can get it." He said.
"I won't. As much as I want to, I won't." Dean replied with a soft sigh. He was reluctant to agree to not hurt the guy, because he definitely deserved it, but he didn't want to make Cas upset. "I'm not sure how willing he's gonna be to sit down and chat about his feelings, but I guess I'll give it a try." He said, not sure of how good he was going to be at that. He wasn't the best talker and it would be difficult to stay calm, but he figured he'd give it a shot if that was what Cas wanted. Anything to keep the guy off of Cas's case.
“You think I have some sick kink with Cas? That I’m twisted?” Dean’s brows went up before nodding and scoffing.
Dean's eyes widened slightly and he laughed as Cas hugged him. "Of course you knew it. I'd feel bad if you didn't know just how cute and amazing you are because that would mean I don't tell you enough." He replied, wrapping his arms around Cas again and giving him a kiss.
Dean relaxed and smiled, feeling sincerely glad that Cas felt that way about just his presence. "Then I guess I'll just stay here. Not that I had plans of going anywhere else, though." He added with a chuckle.
Castiel looked at Dean, completely disheveled, hair sticking out in all different directions, kissed lips, light sweat with uneven breathing, and bites scattered across his neck. "Ah...Dean..." He softly moaned when Dean took his hand away. His eyes trailed downwards, looking over Dean. He was a whole different body structure than himself. He glanced down and his breath hitched a little. "Dean...I...haven't...done /this/...before." He managed out.
Sam kept a straight face, "You can keep it to yourself or get the out." He said coldly. He was taller than John so he towered slightly over him. "C'mon Cas. Let's go." He said, ushering him out.
Dean made a face, “Not really, but alright.” he said as his brother pulled out a list and he had to go and locate everything.
Castiel looked at Dean, before he looked down. "I suppose you are right, there's nothing to be worried about. They haven't treated my wrongly for being a gymnast." He said. He stepped away to turn off the stove, everything was done. Then right on time the oven went off. He put on a mitt and took them out and put it on a cooling rack. He cut them out and put them into a plate, they were gooey on the inside but firm enough to hold. He smiled a little, "Okay we can go back now." He said.
“Hello Sam...it’s been a while.” He smiled slightly.
Dean moved closer to him, still not touching him. "I'm here Cas, really. Its me. You don't have to be afraid." He said desperately, wanting to find some way to comfort him. "Look at me, it's Dean. You're in my room, on my bed, completely safe." He said quietly. "You can believe me." He added.
Dean's eyes felt crusted around the edge, heavy. He moved his toes and fingers, nothing hurt. He just rested against the cool rocks and fell unconscious again.
Castiel prickled, lunging forward and biting his finger sharply. Benny yanked his finger back, wincing slightly at the bite.
Charlie grinned, "Come by and join us any time Benny. You're always welcomed." she said before leaving with Kevin.
Dean grinned and nodded. "See ya then." He replied, turning and walking towards his class.
“Tomorrow, I’d like to take you two swimming with me.” Castiel said delightfully as they headed back to the cave.
"Now Gabriel. There's no point in wasting time." She said.
Castiel nibbled on his food, blushing a bit still. "Well...I didn't really expect things to go that way to be honest...My gifts to you were panties and the little book I gave you. Then whatever else Gabriel gave to me." he said. He played with his fingers a little. "I'm sorry I didn't get you the perfect gift. I should have thought more about it..." he said sadly.
"Yes well, I'm glad you didn't but don't hurt yourself." Castiel looked at him. "I'll wrap your hands after and treat it." he said. "Do you have a first aid kit?" he asked.
Charlie looked around the car, "It's really clean and well kept. My car is a cluster." She laughed.
Dean looked over at Cas with a smile. "I like the way you think. That's a good idea." He said, glancing up to catch the waiter's attention and order. "We'll take a slice of cherry pie, extra whipped cream." He said, grinning at Cas as the waiter left again.
The hot water washed over him but he didn't relax, he was tense. He washed part of his face to get rid of the tear streaks on his cheeks. He washed his hair first, scrubbing it tiredly. He felt the suds wash away as he stood there. He had to clean himself. He grabbed the soap and started scrubbing his skin, again and again. He had to clean between his legs and inside of him. He started crying again once he started cleaning there, not because it hurt, but how disgusting it was. He felt it run down his legs and it was cold and he felt sick. His tears were washed with the shower. Once he felt that he cleaned it all out, he was completely done, he fell to his knees and started scratching his skin around his neck and shoulders. He didn't want them there, he wanted them gone. He started crying harder, constantly scratching his skin, feeling it burn hot and puffy at his scratching. He dug his nails into himself, just wanting it all gone. He wasn't even sure if Dean could hear him but at this point he didn't care. He wanted Dean to come hold him, tell him he was okay no matter how much he was against it, he wanted Dean to take it all away. He scratched at his skin even harder that it broke skin.
Dean glanced over at Sam. "Uh, yeah." He replied somewhat uncertainly, shrugging as if it wasn't a big deal. He'd never told anyone else about their dad, but he didn't want to make a big deal about it, though he knew Sam would think it was.
Over the next few months of measuring Cas, he had become more of a cheater, one time he stood up on all his tentacles, right on the tip so he could be taller. Dean laughed at his attempts and always told him he wouldn't know how tall he would be if he would cheat. Castiel would always pout and sink back down so Dean could measure him. He was slowly getting a little bigger but not much, now he fit perfectly on Dean's hand but it wasn't enough for Castiel.
Castiel sat in her hand, wanting to ask more questions but he heard Dean come back in. Over the time Dean left, Lisa and him bonded in a way. He still thought of her as a possibly threat and rival but he enjoyed talking to her, she listened and was sympathetic. It was nice to have someone to talk to about his frustrations about Dean.
Charlie perked, "Oh this is going to be cute." she said, scooting closer to hear.
Castiel rarely ever said anything when Dean tended his wounds, he learned after the first time and the glazed look over Dean's eyes, the thinly pressed lips, the crease in his brow, that he knew that he asked something wrong. That it was good to stay quiet.
"Dean! Come here!" Castiel squeaked.
Castiel took the firecracker and lighter and lit it up before he tossed it away from everyone and it set off, this time it was green and Castiel made a delighted sound, bouncing. Charlie and Kevin were sitting on the edge of the truck with Sam standing off the side, watching Castiel acting like a child.
Castiel shook his head, "Nothing's wrong. I was just staring, thinking." he replied. He moved his legs a little to adjust and catch one of Dean's legs under the table. They couldn't hold hand but this could make up for it.
Dean used one hand to support himself over Cas, kissing him deeply for a moment before glancing out of the corner of his eye at the mirror, making sure they would both have a good view. The image of them kissing, even fully dressed, sent a spike of arousal and anticipation through him as he thought about what they would soon be able to see in the mirror. He used his free hand to start working his way down the buttons of Cas's shirt, pulling it open as he did.
Castiel put his hand over Dean's, leaning into it. He closed his eyes and let out a shaky breath. He needed to take in those words to make those thoughts in his mind silent. He slowly opened his eyes again to Dean's gaze. He nodded just slightly. He could get past this, like he always had. He had Dean this time, he's not alone and he won't have to face it alone.
"I haven't wrapped many of my gifts, but there's a couple." Dean said as he came down with a few messily wrapped things. "Wrapping is a pain in the ass, by the way." He added as he set them down by the others and stepped back again. "Now that's a tree." He said, grinning proudly.
"Do you ever think about it? About the past? About Mom?" Sam asked. "I sometimes wonder about it, what was mom like, what if we had a normal family, what if she hadn't died..." he told him. "I think about it sometimes, but I try not to a lot."
Castiel glanced at Dean. "You guys can start eating before it gets cold." he said, looking back at the two.
Dean looked at him, “He’s worried about me.” he said. “Since I was gone and he didn’t hear from me, he’s worried I’m doing something rash and stupid.”
Castiel stroked Dean's hair, moving his lips against his. He felt his lips tug up into a small smile as he kissed Dean, wanting to say every little affection he felt to Dean but he would never stop. He just pulled Dean closer, saying it was okay to lay more on him, just expressing himself through his body. He was willing to let Dean lay on him because he was there to hold him up and he liked the feeling.
"That's enough Cas." Dean told him. "If you don't want to apologize, fine. If you want to throw your hissy fit and won't play nice, you're going to stay in the tank until I think you're ready to come back out."
Castiel laughed lightly at them, spinning again so they wouldn't have to wait. "Left hand blue." He said.
Dean chuckled. "Yeah, normally." He said, standing so that he could hit the light switch off. "This okay with you?" He asked, maneuvering the dark room back to the bed.
By the end of class Castiel had caught up with what they missed but he still needed to do the homework. He picked it up after and put it away into his bag. Balthazar caught up to him and started walking next to him, "So why were you away for so long?" he asked.
Charlie glanced at them, "Oh take your love somewhere else." She laughed lightly. "I'll just go hug Sam and Kevin then." She said before squishing Kevin against Sam.
Castiel nodded slightly. "Of course." He said. He opened the door of the room and they were still there, oblivious to the situation. Castiel lead Dean in for a moment but didn't wake them up yet. He looked up at Dean, sighing softly. "I'll come visit later if you want me to." He said. He stared at Dean a little before he touched his cheek and leaned up to kiss him.
"What are they saying that's so detailed?" Dean asked, now paranoid. He told himself he didn't care what they thought, but he also knew it could be trouble.
Dean grinned, loving Cas's enthusiasm. "Yeah, that sounds good. Then it'll be like we get two Christmases." He added with a laugh. "It's funny, everything feels more Christmassy this year since you're around. And we'll get a tree and decorate, and it'll really be a pretty awesome Christmas." He told Cas happily, knowing he'd appreciate all the holiday activities.
Castiel leaned into the touch and closed his eyes, wanting to be closer but he didn’t want to wet Dean’s clothes.
Dean smiled and nodded slightly. "Okay." He murmured before kissing Cas one more time and pulling away. "I'll be back in no time, you'll hardly know I'm gone." He said with a grin, winking at Cas before he pulled his keys out of his pocket and grabbed the list, heading back outside to the impala. He was determined to get this over with as quickly as possible and then get back to Cas again.
Kevin nodded, taking a seat across from Dean. Dean twiddled his fingers a little, "Yeah, sorry this was such a weird request. I know enochians are rare and people are trying to keep them a secret but...I just kind of wanted to know more about them." he tried explaining, failing miserably since he wasn't sure how to bring it up.
"You're welcome." Dean replied simply, sitting down beside Cas again. "Are you feeling a little better?" He asked, knowing that it was a good sign that he was talking again. He hoped the tea would help as well, and the cats always seemed to.
Dean shrugged and chuckled at Sam's comment before going to the door of the kitchen. "Bobby, dinner's ready." He called before walking over to where Cas was standing with the pizza. "Looks just as good as it did for lunch." He said with a smile.
Castiel still looked weary and nervous. He was so worried for Dean, even though he knew Dean could handle his own but this was more than one person and it wasn't physically. He sat up before resting his forehead against Dean's, "Okay. Come home soon. I'll be here." He said before looking at him. "Let's go make breakfast." He said softly.
Castiel grumbled a little while he sluggishly undid his pants and tried to wiggle out of them. He groaned halfway through. "Bad decision..." He grumbled. "M' too tired..." He sighed as he gave up.
"Cas, enough!" Dean snapped at him and Castiel immediately stilled. "What's gotten into you?" he asked.
It was just smooth sailing, other boats out and about, further out and away from where they were going. Dean was kind of nervous but the thought of seeing Cas again, seeing him happy and everything made the feeling dwindle.
“Me too baby….c’mon, cum for me…” Dean coaxed, kissing him again before castiel broke the kiss, arching back as he orgasmed, clamping down on the other and cumming over his tentacles and hand from Dean stroking him.
Dean watched the exchange between them, wondering how often Cas must come here to know Jo's mom. Castiel looked over at Dean, tilting his head a little.
Castiel nodded a little, "Then come eat with us, I make our lunches and I'm okay with sharing mine." He offered.
Dean smiled softly, moving his hand to thread into the hair at the nape of his neck. "You more than make up for it. You more than make up for everything that's sucked." He said, kissing his hair.
They all put their foot down. 5 minutes later they were all tangled in sorts. "Red, right hand." Castiel chuckled, looking from the spinning wheel to them.
"Nerds." Lisa commented.
Dean held up the panties and let out a breath, setting them on the bed while he undressed. He slipped them on, the softness familiar against his skin. "Okay Cas." He called after taking a moment to prepare himself. He stood by the bed, somewhere between nervous and excited.
Castiel looked at him, "I never want to stop touching you." he smiled slightly. "I think I would be okay if it was just with my hands." he said. "You said I was allowed to use those things we have on you anytime. Am I still allowed to do that?" he asked, tracing his fingers around Dean again. He watched his fingers for a moment before looking up at Dean. "I'm not going to gag you. I don't want that so if we can't be quiet I think we would have to stop." he told him. "No tying hands either so this would be all on your own willpower. So be aware of where you put them." he continued. "You can touch me, but you can't urge me to do something. No shifting your hips, no grinding, not telling me what you want unless I ask. If you think you can listen to that, we can continue." he finished, looking back at Dean with his hand flat against his chest again.
Dean Winchester: *Rolls his eyes a little* I'm sure I can handle my own Cas. I can just jog home, but if you're so worried of me walking home alone, you could always call me and talk to me as I walk. *He laughed a little.*
Sam nodded, "What else would I say to him? He's older than us. I don't have anything else to connect to him with." he added.
"Yes, sir." Dean replied jokingly with an arched brow, not minding Cas's bossiness. After the past few days, he could understand him feeling sore and possibly grouchy. He sat up, stretching before moving so that he could massage Cas's hips the way he had the previous morning.
Castiel looked over at Dean and tilted his head slightly, "Did we have plans?" He asked. "I'm sure we have a free day don't we?" He said. He slowly continued to eat, sipping on his drink occasionally.
Castiel nuzzled against Dean, "I will. I want to see what you look like." he said. "But maybe when things have calmed down." he added. He glanced at the timer over Dean, they still had an hour and a half.
Castiel nodded, "Yes, I love being high up. It makes the world seem so much bigger." he replied. Slowly the ride came to an end and they walked off the ride. Castiel checked his phone for the time then back at the group. "We can get on another ride before going to go eat, it's already past noon." he told them.
"O...kay?" Dean said questionably.
"I'm glad you had fun, I had a lot of fun too." Castiel smiled. "I think we're going back home to eat with everyone but let's escape a little before we go home, I'm sure they won't mind. Do you want to go get ice cream with me?" he asked. "I want to share ice cream with you." he said.
Sam arched a brow, "Long time to ask a person for a date. Why, didn't have the courage?" He teased. Castiel smiled softly, tracing a bee in the window. He drew a small heart next to it and glanced at Dean. He laughed lightly, deciding to leave it on his window.
Castiel had his eyes closed, resting against Dean. "We should invest in one..." he murmured. water was becoming foamy and started forming bubbles. The smell of vanilla started filling the room and Castiel made a pleased sound, "I think I chose a nice scent." he said.
"...What do you do on New Years?" Castiel asked after a few moments, still having his eyes closed. He wasn't exactly sleepy but it was nice to lay there. "Can we go back to the hill?"
"I really like them." Castiel replied, looking up at Dean. "They just look so good on you. I shouldn't really be surprised, seeing at how well you can pull off female clothing in general but this...this is. It suits you." He said. "It might sound odd but I think they compliment you." He smiled a little, keeping his hands on Dean's hips.
When Kevin and Dean walked in the house, Charlie, Gabriel, and Sam were already working. Gabriel glanced up at them when they came in and motioned for Kevin to the computer. Kevin put down his bag before going over to Gabriel.
Dean awoke a little while later, blinking drowsily and trying to figure out exactly where they were before he remembered the previous evening and smiled, glancing down at Cas. He moved just a little to be able to kiss his head, figuring Cas had probably woken up first as usual but not stirring yet.
Castiel shook his head, enjoying Dean touching his hair. He scooted up a bit to put his head onto his shoulder and lying there. He turned his head slightly and placed a soft kiss to Dean's neck and laid there. "I just want to touch." He told him.
Dean smiled and looked around, nodding. "Yeah, we got here just when I wanted to. We still had some sun to eat and now it's dark and lit up. It is pretty amazing, huh?" He asked, pausing so they could both look around before walking forward again. "It's even more awesome on the ice." He led the way over to where skates were being rented, each of them getting a pair and lacing them up. "Okay, you ready? I can help you if you need it." He said, offering his hand to Cas.
Gabriel could be faintly heard from outside, he was arguing. Sam looked at Dean, "What if this doesn't work? Then what will happen?" He asked.
Sam touched his chin thoughtfully, "Hmmm, why are you a hacker?" he asked.
Dean looked at the message for a moment before sighing. Maybe he'd be able to talk to him more tomorrow.
“It’ll come back to you, besides, you have me and Cas. A man who can breathe underwater and me, a man who knows first aid.” Dean pat him on his shoulder. “Okay, let’s go suit up. Cas, keep the water nice for us, will ya?” he called to his boyfriend, leading Sam out.
“Dean---” Castiel’s eyes were brimmed in tears as he felt choked up at hearing those words.
Cas: There's a bet going around where the winner is whoever can become friends with me and I tell them about what happened between my disappearance, wins. I don't understand why it matters so much.
Dean watched, transfixed and excited by Cas getting the toys, before glancing up when he realized Cas had asked him another question. "Uh, enochian." He answered, looking down at the paper to force himself to get some more done before watching Cas again.
Dean's mouth fell open as his head fell back, his body just shook before his cum shot up and landed onto his stomach. His chest was rising and falling quickly as he came. Castiel groaned, pausing just a moment to admire before thrusting into Dean quickly to help him finish.
"You have slightly bigger hands than mine. You are taller so I would think you would but you also have callouses on your hands because of the hard work you have done before. All the work you've put into the impala, any other car, taking care of Sam, they are an indication of you doing so many things with your hands." Castiel replied as he continuously rubbed his thumb back and forth. He glanced up at Dean as he turned the shake toward him. He leaned up, catching the straw as Dean did. Their faces were really close and Castiel smiled against his straw, laughing lightly once he drank a little. He leaned over a little more and kissed Dean on the nose. He couldn't resist not kissing Dean so he settled for a small one.
Castiel sighed, sitting down at his normal spot. He glanced out the window, wondering how he was going to be able to do this. He felt like he was missing things already from not touching Dean whenever he could and the gap between them made him feel sad, but what could he do? Maybe he should talk to Dean about it, but what if he really would be annoyed with him? Dean didn't comment about their space, maybe he didn't notice. Castiel frowned sadly in his seat before putting his head down. He didn't want Dean to get sick of him.
"That's true." Sam nodded. "But it's still fun to play with them." he said.
“Cas, I don’t get why…..how long?” Dean asked him, reaching out and pulling Cas’s arms away.
"Nope. You're an angel of pie. No exaggeration." Dean replied as he opened the container. He took a large forkful, head leaning back on the tree behind him. "Castiel. This is the best thing I've ever had." he told him as he chewed slowly and letting out a breath as he closed his eyes. He was savoring the taste.
Castiel nodded, closing his eyes and taking a deep breath. "New years..." he said softly. He would be starting a New Year with Dean. He smiled a bit at the thought as he laid quietly. He could hear Dean's heartbeat and his soft breathing, it was lulling him to sleep. He wanted to sleep a bit but he knew that they would have to be leaving soon and he didn't want Dean to be doing everything by himself, but even when thinking that, he was slowly drifting back and forth between sleep.
"Meep." it chirped at him.
"Yeah I got your order. Afternoon, how many-" she stopped once she knew it was them.
"But if you never talk of it, he won't ever grow. He probably wants to know. As a kid it would have been good not to tell him but now he's older, he will understand. You don't need to bare the burden alone anymore, you can talk to him. You don't need to deal with it by yourself." Castiel told him. "He's here for you. As am I." He said.
Castiel had a shiver run through him, having Dean kissing him like this. He had one of his hands resting on the side of Dean's neck, cupping his face as he traced his thumb around his jaw and the other in his hair, helping him kiss him as he played with the hairs. Their few minutes were going to be extended to a longer time. Not that anyone else cared, they should expected that much once Dean told them a few minutes.
Dean moved their hands to either side of Cas's head, brushing against him and feeling the contact between them in waves. He broke off their kiss to tenderly kiss away each of his tears as they fell, knowing how overwhelming the intense feelings and passionate love between them were.
Castiel hand slid down and around Dean. He touched the lower edges, slipping his fingers right inside the hem. He just rested them there, kissing Dean back. He could feel Dean's arousal stirring a little. He pressed against him, urged on.
Castiel took the M&M happily, "I didn't think you would feed me, but I'm not complaining." he let the M&M melt in his mouth before eating it. He wanted to settle in Dean's lap but he kind of hurt so he thought against it, just in case.
Castiel wrapped his arms around Dean's waist and snuggled into the junction of his neck and breathing in softly. He lowered himself a little to wait for the water to fill more but he was warm with Dean pressed against him. He gently squeezed Dean as he snuggled more into him.
Dean was trying to gauge what sort of mood he was in, and part of him desperately hoped that he was just stopping by to see everyone before disappearing watched Dean and saw different emotions bounce across his face and none of them seemed happy. He slowly shifted his gaze to the man that Dean called dad.
Castiel sighed softly, he pulled Dean over again for another kiss. "All of it will calm down eventually." he said. "I thought you said we had unfinished business we would attend to after we've finished eating." he laughed lightly. "Should we leave it unfinished?" he asked.
Sam took the stick and draw antlers on his and he looked pleased. Kevin took the stick last and just wrote weirdos into the snow. Castiel laughed a bit more, before looking at everyone with their rosy cheeks and noses, "Ready to go back inside. I can make more hot chocolate." he offered.
Castiel glanced at Dean, then back at the road. "Dean." He said first. "I would advise you not to drive quickly when there's snow out. It's dangerous." He told him. "I do not understand your hurry but we could have left earlier."
Castiel nodded, "Yes I did, thank you." he said.
"No, that'll just ruin his punishment if he thinks at the first thing he says that he'll get to come back out." Dean shook his head, going back to his cooled mug and drinking some. "Let's just eat breakfast. He'll calm down eventually." he said.
Dean held on to him, rubbing his back soothingly. "It's okay, it was a dream. This is real. I'm real, and I'm here." He said, surprised at how affected Cas was by the dream. "And I'll still be here when you wake up tomorrow."
Castiel was stunned for a second before he started laughing as Dean scrambled to turn it down. He stopped laughing after a few moments and listened. He could hear Dean humming the tune next to him. They were both sitting on the ground with their backs to the bed. He scooted a little closer to Dean to listen to him hum. The music wasn't the romantic type but Castiel didn't mind.
"I'm sorry about how I was talking to that girl. I bumped into her and made her drop all her papers and stuff, so I was trying to help her. I know I was probably a little too friendly, but honestly I didn't mean to. I swear, it was just like a reflex or something. I know that doesn't make it any better, but... I'm sorry." He explained quietly and quickly, watching Cas the entire time though he hadn't looked at Dean yet.
"Yeah, I know what you mean." Dean replied, thinking for a moment before smiling. "Remember when that girl was flirting with you on your first day, and I told you about relationships and stuff?" He grinned at the memory. "I always assumed I'd just have the physical kinds- but I definitely like having both sides more."
When it was time to go home, Castiel took the baby home because no way was Dean going to show up at home and let Sam make fun of him. Castiel didn't seem to mind, but every time Dean seemed to blow off their project, he could have sworn he would see a flash of hurt past in Castiel's eyes, but why?
Dean smiled slightly and kissed Cas before replying, supporting him to hold him up. "No, it's not weird." He replied, still moving his fingers carefully. "I like hearing that. Knowing that you like it... And that you want to tell me." He added.
Castiel paused a bit, not liking the idea of them not walking together but he nodded. "Okay. I'll see you at the classroom then." He replied softly. "See you at lunch Dean." he glanced up at Dean and waved a little before walking into his class. His heart felt heavy not doing what he actually really wanted but if he could keep Dean from being sick of him or bored, he'd do it.
"Of course I want your reactions." Dean replied, still smiling because Cas burying himself into his neck was also pretty cute. "I like knowing how you feel when I say stuff, and your blushing is a dead give away. They're good reactions, and I like knowing when you enjoy something I say."
Dean watched him curiously, having no idea what Cas was doing most of the time but not minding. He frowned slightly when he heard Cas sigh. "Something wrong?" He asked, hoping he wasn't in the way or anything.
Dean smiled softly and closed his eyes, cherishing Cas's words. He definitely didn't believe in himself, but he believed in Cas. And if he really saw him as that amazing, maybe he could believe in that too.
Dean blinked, unaccustomed to being studied and looked at the way Cas was. He seems to like what he saw, however, so Dean smiled in response. "Hey, Cas." He replied, eyes tracing the curve of his lips, along his cheek, and meeting his eyes again.
Dean reached up with his now cleaner hands, carefully untying the tie and pulling it gently out of Cas's mouth. It was completely soaked through, but he honestly didn't care; it had definitely been worth it. He realized, now as he calmed down, that exhausting Cas might not have been the best idea here, but he still didn't regret it. He felt completely satisfied, no longer as insecure as he had felt earlier and not jealous of anyone else. After all, none of them got to do what he did.
"Okay let's go." he chirped.
Gabriel looked over at Castiel, "No. It's fine. I was stepping out of line for trying to force you into something. I was acting just like everyone else in the family. Sorry." He looked over at Castiel.
Castiel smiled, "It seems so." he replied. He glanced over at the stereo, "Do you just play music in your room?" he asked, moving over the bed to get closer to the stereo. He looked at the music, "Maybe we can take some to my car." he said.
"No, no, no Cas." Dean replied quickly before running a hand through his hair and sighing. "It's..." he couldn't find the word or a way to explain.
Charlie twirled the gun, "Okay. Alright Dean, game on!" she grinned.
Gabriel sighed, "We could have done this later." He mumbled under his breath.
'Oh my god did he really say that?'
Castiel laughed, glancing over to Dean. "Maybe. We'll see." he replied as they walked into the kitchen.
Castiel nodded a bit before glancing at Dean and leaning closer to him, "Are you okay? I don't think we've been in public together with you wearing those before." he said. "You haven't worn them out since we've been together." he commented. "Well mostly since I found them that we talked about it." he looked over at Dean.
Dean glanced up with an arched brow when he heard Cas's giggle. He laughed when he realized Cas was wearing his clothes, rolling his eyes in amusement. "What, your clothes aren't good enough?" He asked with a chuckle and as he plopped down on the bed beside Cas.
"That's great news Cas." Lisa smiled. "You were a great help when I cooked so I'm sure Dean will appreciate it too." she said
"Spring." Castiel replied. "Life begins again in spring. The snow melts away and the animals start making their lives again. The flowers start budding as the trees grow leaves. The world is becoming lush again as the life cycle continues. I enjoy all the seasons but I like spring the best." he told him.
Castiel turned back to the pasta he cooked, "Thank you." he said. He had another small pot going, steaming the broccoli and carrots. He had turned it on low. He turned it off, deeming it to be done. He stirred the pasta around a little to keep it from sticking to the bottom then pouring it out. He ran a some cool water over it, before getting out another pan. "Okay, you can pass them to me when you're done."
Castiel glanced up at him as he placed the bread on the table. He smiled up at Dean before giving him a kiss on the cheek. "Okay, omelets and toast it is." He said before he started pulling out supplies and got to work. It was a quick make and he slid the plate to Dean when he was done.
"I know who Cas is, Dean." Sam sighed, "But what do you mean you found him?"
Sam glanced at Dean, "Do you want to talk about this?" He asked. "I mean it's not really our business but you look upset." He said.
"Then I guess you'll be happy, because I'll be here every day to be your pillow and to love you just like every day before." Dean replied with a soft smile before grinning. "Yeah, love turns us into sappy, cheesy fools, but I don't mind." He added, chuckling.
Castiel relaxed slightly, looking up at Dean. "Really?" He asked. "I mean we do have lunch together and walk to class so I guess that counts." He said. "But it's fine. I'm okay with you making friends. We can't always be glued to the hip I guess." He glanced away.
