lose you. I can’t, If you were to pass from this world I would follow you soon after. I cannot survive another day without my doctor.”
But here he was….not fine. He was lying in a hospital bed in a dark room with tubes and wires coming out of him this way and that. Sherlock swallowed down a sob as it tried to erupt from his throat; closing his eyes to try and stem off the tears that stung hot in his eyes.
“I have to get you into a bed. My Place? I want you to take me home and fuck me into the mattress. I want your hands all over me. I want you to control my every move.” Sherlock’s eyes were blown wide with arousal as his blood send sparks through his veins. This was better than any high he had ever had.
Greg took a long swig of his beer as he sat back in his chair in the crowded pub, glancing at his watch. He had invited Sherlock and John out to drinks with some of the yarders earlier that evening after they had wrapped up all the paperwork for the latest case they had worked. He knew John was good to show, but wasn’t holding out hope for their favorite consulting detective; seeing as he was in a stroppy mood over Greg and John agreeing to drinks instead of their usual “shag each other’s brains out” night in at 221B.
“I am going home Sally. I haven’t been home in days. I will finish this paperwork tomorrow. I won’t be in til late afternoon.” The DI tried to keep his voice steady as he spoke. Donovan gave him a look of pity and nodded.
Greg instantly pushed his office chair as far into his desk as he could manage with John underneath it as Sally walked into the room nonchalantly, looking at Sherlock puzzled at the consulting detective (who had just brought his belstaff over his lap to hide his own erection). “What’s the freak doing here?” Her voice was laced with the usual distain when she spoke to or about sherlock.
Mycroft…..John glared at his shoes as he laced them up quickly. That great pompous git. John still held the man greatly responsible for Sherlock’s fall. The man had given Moriarty everything he needed in order to destroy the consulting detective. Who the hell was Mycroft to tell him what Sherlock would or would not have wanted John to do? Besides, it no longer mattered. Sherlock was dead and had been for three years to the day.
“Thanks for the offer ma’am, but I think I’d rather take this gorgeous arse home and suck his cock.”
Sherlock refused to turn around to look at his brother; certain that he would be wearing a smug look.
The doctor walked up to the desk, setting the drink carrier down before handing one to the detective inspector. "No more tonight love. We've come to bring you home. We haven't seen you in almost two days. The paperwork can wait til tomorrow. This case has been hard enough on you. Time to go." The doctor moved up behind Greg and wrapped his arms around the DI's chest and planted a soft kiss behind his ear. Greg let himself relax back into the embrace, the weight from the last few days finally hitting him hard; his entire body feeling heavy.
Sherlock’s attention was completely drawn away from where Patrick sat as he spotted the back of a golden haired man moving on the dance floor. Slowly he studied the man as he danced. His hair was golden blonde with a few flecks of grey here and there; late 30’s. Compactly muscled with back and arms toned and tanned. On the man’s left shoulder was an exceptionally beautiful tattoo of a clear midnight sky with stars littered all through it; an obvious depiction of a sky not in London. Sherlock continued to survey the man’s tattoos. On his right shoulder the letters “R.A.M.C” with a caduceus right below it. Military man then, the night sky undoubtedly a representation of the one where he served. The man was dressed in a tight white vest and even tighter black jeans that were tucked into his black combat boots. Sherlock felt his cock twitch in his own leather trouser constraints at the sight of the army doctor’s arse; and what a fine arse it was.
He didn’t bother taking off his jacket or wet shoes, the rubber squeaking as me made his way to the bathroom to collect the pill bottle along with the bottle of whiskey that was resting on the back of the toilet. Holding the plastic bottle in one hand and the whiskey in the other he walked towards the room that had stayed shut for the last three years.
“I have been trying…I really have Sherlock. But….it’s just too hard. I would much rather leave this world and be with you than try to continue on without. Your name is cleared now you know? Lestrade and I spent months and months going over your cases you worked and each and every one of them were proved legitimate. Anderson and Donovan were shocked, and they even apologized to me. I punched Anderson in the face.” John chuckled and sobbed at the memory. “Oh Sherlock….I would trade….everything….all of it….just to see your face and tell you all the things that I should have…”
How had it come to this? How did John fall so far while he was gone? If only he had heeded Mycroft’s words when he tried to warn him that John was struggling.
“Four shots of whiskey please?” the busty waitress flashed her best smile at the ex-soldier, no doubts in an attempt to flirt and hopefully to get a better tip.
If it wasn't for the curls and those prominent cheekbones, I might not have recognized him. He's dressed appropriately for the evening in a black suit, purple silk shirt, but no tie. His hair is still wildly curly but with a soft sheen.
Mike's opening the door to my office jolts me awake. Getting to my feet I lose my balance, drop back down, wincing.
I whirl to face him, "lay off it, Mycroft," my hands flapping aimlessly in the air, "I haven't indulged in anything more potent than nicotine patches.
We're the only ones within two rows of the screen, so it affords us some privacy. The previews are beginning. John is giggling as he throws some icky popcorn at me. Growling, "John, grow up," I clean the popcorn off me with a napkin.
right, so he just let it read and avoid the CCTV cameras or crowded places like a plague. The night he spends in motel, subway, or parks feels like bachelor lonely club regardless of how much coffee or sandwich he eats, he misses London so bad, and ultimately the only consulting detective in the world. If people notice he sleeps with a coat that bigger than him or sniffles coat on his face, they don’t call social service but rather let him alone. That’s nice.
mind that’s what Sherlock would say, keeps haunting him day and night that he ever had the opportunity to meet an amazing man and now he lost him. That man is infuriating when demands things from others as well as throwing tantrum when boredom is too great to tackle or basically when John tried to have a life outside the nutshell of
I open my mouth, shut it, try to initiate once more, shocked at my inability to convey--to deliver this as a normal--.
He's savage as the lash sinks onto my back, ass, and thighs. Choking on my saliva as I shriek and holler, tears and mucus from my nose soak the pillow. I hear the whip hit the floor.
"Instead, he shook his head, walked closer, and clutched me in a bear hug. He whispered for me to see a doctor. Give me a tranquilizer. His voice broke, and he left me turning back to his desk saying he had work to do."
I pop two Xanax into my mouth, open the cabinet, and remove a long-sleeved top, and a scrub bottom. Exhausted both physically and mentally, I plop onto the sofa in my office. I pick at the tattered seams on the couch as I attempt to fix the remaining parts of my confidence. It could have been worse. Much worse. I shudder at what that could have been, and fall asleep.
"Let me guess. He thought you had gone back on cocaine, called Mycroft, who came rushing over. And what did your brother do?"
She lays a hand over her mouth and whimpers, " oh, my. You are having illusions. Take two paracetamol and go to bed. And I'll call--no, just go to bed," waving both hands in evident distress, " and makes a swift exit out the door.
A corner of Sherlock's mouth tilts up, watching my expression as Bill explains the nature of our clinic. Sherlock's studies me, releasing my hand.
Sherlock is sitting in a leather armchair, a silk dressing gown over his trousers and shirt. He uncrosses his long legs," I estimated you'd arrive here tomorrow," he sighs, “always something. But here you are.”
During my speech, his eyes never dropped, never shifted, and I admit to shivering at the intensity of his gaze.
He burrows through the various papers on the desk, digs out a pad and a pencil and scribbles an address, rips it off, and lays it in my outstretched hand.
To give your flatmate, your only flatmate a reason to breathe. To feel relieved that he knows where you are and/or when your approximate time home will be.
His tongue, his bites, his voice, and his demands arouse every sexual atom that is running through my body. My breath quickens, my head dips to his shoulder, my left-hand reaches down and awkwardly unzips, keeping the button on my jeans intact.
"Mycroft entered this flat and proceeded to invade every aspect of my private life. And, to console you, my dear doctor, "rolling up my sleeve," here. Satisfied?"
So preoccupied with my tirade, the water begins spilling over and onto my hand. I drop the pot into the sink, shake my hand, and stomp into the parlor.
I did not expect to see John Watson this evening. Regardless of my attempt to ignore him, I can still feel his throbbing pulse all the while holding his hand. The closeness of his person was upsetting. I knew Mycroft was silently questioning how and where had I interacted with John. That is the issue with us as siblings. We know how to read people, especially each other. This boring gathering is going to be more captivating than I first envisioned.
The craving to represent me in a better light to the doctor and ask his pardon is immense. Twice this week, I have entertained the thought of visiting him and apologizing. In any case, would he welcome my statement? I approach him, not certain how to begin this discussion, "Would a stroll around the house be appropriate for this moment?"
"Sir, you don't have to raise your voice. I can hear you. That ladder that was there yesterday? They took it with them last evening when it started to rain," and shows me her back.
My breathing is heavy, but the pressure I'm under, the pressure he's putting on me, is only making it worse.
I poke Mike in the ribs, my head jerking in the direction of the bar. "Wow! Take a look at that kid!" fascinated at the sight of the tall, angular young one leaning his back against the bar, his eyes down, examining the floor.
I know, beyond all doubt, that at two or three in the a.m., he'd bounce into my bedroom, waking me and coming up with all sorts of viewpoints--of course, which would be wrong.
“To resume, Sherlock. We continued and there in front of us, against a building, stood a ladder. Yes, you git! Exactly like today,” drawing a breath, “ I was never one for stupid folklore, and I walked under it, laughing. Once on the other side, which of course took milliseconds, you were gone. You had been on my left, and now you were missing.”
But here, walking beside me, is the man himself. From the top of those curls to the polished hand-made shoes.
"So, no cocaine, no heroin. Quite a tale," his amused countenance very telling, he asks, "is there a happy ending to this story?"
He slides open the dresser drawer and discovers the baby blue jumper neatly folded. Did John not take it on purpose?
Out of the corner of my eye, I see a young girl stumble over a bench, her head hitting the ground. Whimpering at first, she shrieks in her pain and fright. Before anyone, Sherlock is sat on the ground, holding her head in his lap. "There there, it's not so bad," cradling her, pointing at a tank across the way, he says, "see the big shark over there?" His honeyed voice and smile detracting her.
Drawing nearer, he reaches out to touch me, then withdraws his hand," go home. I can handle it here."
I have no coherent understanding, and for me, Sherlock Holmes, to have a riddle that can't be settled, well- - .
I sit down, taking into consideration that my nerves are shot to freaking hell, and it's time to tame them.
Say it. So ahead. Because right now, there are two choices. Either my flatmate, the detective, throws you out or he--but he won’t.
My heart pounding heavily and with dread, my legs begin the walk towards the offending piece of equipment.
“Highly unusual it is,” Sherlock's eyes agleam, " I would remember it-- if the circumstance warrants it."
He's merely jesting, and my fisted hands stay in my trousers pockets. Better not to reply. I feel equivalent to the energetic children weaving in and around us, as I have no perception of social relationships. Particularly with someone as respectable as the doctor.
I'm as yet unequipped to speak in a softer tone due to the unnatural circumstance," I must know where--.
"Doctor John Watson. Mrs. Hudson. You know--the man, the doctor, who--who at present lives with me upstairs," jabbing my finger towards the ceiling.
John has picked an alternate life, and his happiness is most dominant. If the doctor professes to need Mary for his significant other and if it means a wedding, then Sherlock resolves to create a perfect soiree.
His face registers his surprise, "but I'm sure that's not what this is all about. I Grimms fairy tale. Am I right?"
“You're assuming lots. But, to be honest--you do look like you're asking for action. A proposition maybe. I would seriously consider--,” my insides bubbling.
"So that's what you were doing just before. Of course, that's impossible. How was everything gone? Why would I do that without reason? And it would take, no, let me rephrase that--I would never leave you."
He grunts. and I'm humiliated. "That's it. If it's going to be like this, I'm leaving," heading for escape.
"Envision my uneasiness when the entirety of your possessions was absent from our flat. You had left your teacup unwashed in the sink that morning, but it was not there. I raced up the steps to your bedroom and-- no pistol."
My flatmate of six months, Sherlock, has taken to regarding me with veiled eyes. Trying to deduce what is wrong but afraid to ask, to invade my privacy.
"She gathered me in her arms, squeezing me in a vise-like grip, 'Ohhhh, Johnnnnn.' She began sobbing, her face deep into my shoulder. Why was she crying? Not understanding but knowing how sensitive she was, I patted her back and, as gently as I could, asked her where you were."
I'm sick of visiting King Richards pub on Thursdays with Mike. The same crowd, the same beer, the same everything. Two of our younger staff have been meeting at the Hound Dog. The joke is always about its being a hole in the wall. But fun. I'm intrigued. It's time I checked out alternatives. I've been in the same pattern for a few years, and the change would be good.
“John. You sound like a petulant child. Yes, I do indulge. I do anticipate and read them thoroughly beforehand and keep a strategic distance. Very well aware of what humans are capable of, I always have a weapon handy,” striding over to stand close, I plant my hands on his shoulders and he shrugs them off just as quick.
With a sigh, a voice laced with disdain. “I thought we had an appointment. What in hell are you doing here?”
"Sherlock Holmes," she pulls back," how dare you to suggest I have anything other than your--," her hands vanish into her apron pockets--which is a sure signal of her agitation.
"Not possible, I said. I couldn't speak of how, to me, you had gone missing. He'd think I was over the hill--"a finger circling round near my ear.
"Aha, just like you," reversing my position, stomping to the kitchen to pick up the teapot from the stove, all the while talking, no sputtering is more like it.
"I was also astonished. Would not believe that he would demonstrate sentiment. He even told me he would not explain anything until I ate."
"John it's time you started dressing like a gentleman of class like me, accept my offer and we'll have dinner at an Italian restaurant called Angelo's"
Johns's mouth opens, preparing to give out a remark; however, I lift my hand, “no, don't. This isn't as simplistic as you suspect, and if you insist on cutting in with your own theory, I will stop.”
The flat's stuffiness ultimately drew me out of my stupor, however light-headed from lack of food and sleep, but well aware of the need to run.
My patience, fragile as it is, rebels, and I strike my fist on his desk, causing the documents to shuffle as I simultaneously bellow, "simply answer me."
I see two fingers dip in the bag, come out, and before I know it he has smeared the butter on my lips. It was the way he did it that brought me up short. Sensually slow, looking into my eyes!
Sherlock bends his head off to the side, runs his hand through his mass of curls to show his amazement and confusion.
My coat slides off one shoulder and as I whirl about-- I see--the damn fuck sitting in his chair, legs crossed, holding a book.
I pick up on his door banging open, again the heavy footfall down to fling my door open, so it crashes into the wall with a thump.
The noises of traffic outside, and the hum of a vacuum from downstairs, held my attention for a few minutes.
Days went by, and the silence, the demise of a life that held me in its grip, exciting, ever-challenging, and the extra--which couldn't be named--ultimately grew unbearable.
I close a large number of unsolved cases that sit on my table, which is at least an ointment that soothes my mind.
But it's me that's more disturbed. At myself.  Maybe I should have left this in the dark. Keep it in the depths of the ‘strange things happen realm.’
"You shit, you piece of dirt," moving my head closer and closer, I touch his lips. A light glance, and I spring instantly up and away.
"At the specified period I'm alluding to, we strode out of the police headquarters and commenced to walk. Precisely identical to today.”
Waiting for the pot to boil, I lean out, "and when will this happy event occur? The wedding, I mean," as I bring in the cups.
Tugging at his sleeve, he turns to look at me--those eyes--those eyes. "Sherlock. Can we--oh, I don't know," brushing my fingers through my hair, "how about friends. And this time I mean it."
He shrugs his shoulders, "Ah, that's very strange, but--Abbott and George took the ladder up to Northhampton."
"A lab in California was investigating fish from diverse coral reefs. Bringing in several varieties and setting them in fish tanks in a spacious room. A diver captured a Caribbean octopus and donated it to the laboratory. They put into a separate tank. The technicians noticed fish had disappeared when they arrived each morning. There were wet streaks on the floor.  Who was doing this, and why? Cameras were installed and strategically placed. In the morning, they watched the footage and had the shock of their lives. The octopus left his tank at night, slithered to the fish tanks, and took his fill. Putting covers on all the tanks, they arrived the next day, watched in amazement as the octopus removed his and two other tops, and returned to his tank."
Thrashing, pulling at the bindings, I strain to rise, and the cuffs tighten as I strain, tearing the skin.
Peering into the case, my breath catches as I recognize Johns favorite--those sweet chocolate rolls.
The sign on the drab brown building was once a deep red, the name Pinkys in shocking pink. All faded now. Inside pink and purple strobe lights swivel, permitting limited visibility throughout the room. Wall sconces succeed in illuminating both the floor area and the bar. The music is low and mellow and has a tinny sound. Probably cheap speakers and a CD player.
Such a tiring and aggravating day! I'm already out of sorts as I stomp up the stairs, and open the door.
He seated the violin on the music stand and delicately closed the music sheet. A keepsake for them. Tossing his dark blue coat about him, as though to buffer him from the celebration that isn't his, he strolls out.
“Mycroft mentioned you would be his guest, and I took the time to do some research. Both about you and your center--both quite-- interesting.”
"No, Sherlock. I--I don't know how to explain. I like your company and your intelligence, and I'm sincere when I ask for your friendship. Please. Let's continue around the rest of the gallery."
“I recollect the building," he says, "they are still in the process of repairing the roof. The persistent rain has kept them from completing the work."
In the seconds he's relating her status, the little girl has stopped crying and is looking at the shark and back at Sherlock.
Nothing is right anymore. It's all about the fucking nightmare that I can't wake from. One that has shaken me-- derailed me. Was it for real? How could it have been?
“Have a seat, Doctor Watson," settling my body into a green, dark green, armchair. These Holmes brothers always seem to unnerve me. I don’t know whether it’s their wealth or their damned self-assured selves.
"You know I don't pick up just anybody,” however, I keep tabs on him as something unknown hits my innards. He casts a spell that butchers my confidence. He's stunning! He's striking! He's hitting every button. I'm lightheaded, off-balance.
I splay my palms on my trousers and stare at each finger as if to will them to stop me from speaking the unspoken.
Sweeping the magazine and the remote for the television off onto the floor, he again reiterates,” leave, Mycroft.”
John swallowed all of Sherlock down contracting his throat a few times before pulling off entirely and pinning the younger man to the bed; hands held tight above his head as John straddled his chest.
Everything he had done, he did to save John. To save the man he loved more than anything else in the world. But things had gone too far. Why couldn’t he have just allowed Mycroft to take out Moran for him? Why couldn’t he have put aside his need for up close and personal revenge on the sniper assigned to John?
Without a word John sauntered away from him and up to the bar where he was placing an order. Sherlock couldn’t help but follow the glorious man to the bar where he observed a woman was watching John carefully as she adjusted her breasts in her dress. He watched as she checked them once more before plastering on a sickeningly sweet smile and tapped John on the shoulder. The blonde turned and smiled kindly at her and listened as she whispered in his ear; completely unaware of Sherlock’s approach.  He just stared at her as she continued her desperate advance on the man. John turned to her with two shots in his hand, causing the woman to smile and hold her hand out; only to be left staring as the man turned to Sherlock and handed him one of the glasses.
Letting out a long sigh Mycroft slowly made his way across the room to grasp his brother’s shoulder squeezing it gently.
Pulling off with an obscene pop he glanced up to where John’s head was lolled back against the pillows with a blissed expression on his face. Sherlock grabbed the man’s hand and thrust it into his dark curls and positioned his mouth over the good doctor’s cock. “No gag reflex, now fuck my face.” Sherlock began sucking again in earnest as he felt John’s fingers tighten in his hair while groaning and rolling his hips forward.
A soft knock on his office door startled him out of his memories of the gruesome way the malnourished children had been beaten so severely. No one else from his department was in the office, or at least shouldn't be, not at this hour. When the door cracked open he was met with a familiar bright smile and blue eyes that were full of compassion and understanding. John always knew where his thoughts were at when they traveled to the dark part of his mind, the smaller man was a huge strength to the DI after a particularly brutal case. The stocky ex soldier waltzed in with a drink carrier filled with what was undoubtedly tea, John made the best tea, followed by the consulting detective ducking in right behind him.
Both men gasped as they tried to catch their breath as they lay bonelessly on the bed; not caring that they were laying in a puddle of Sherlock’s cum. Both their bodies completely drained of their strength they could barely turn themselves on their back while their chests heaved. After a moment of silence Sherlock let his head flop to the left so he could stare at John who was watching him.
John continued his kisses and nips along the DI's thighs. "Keep it up Sherlock," the doctor warned as he stayed completely focused on the task at hand.
Sherlock thought his heart might stop from the overwhelming joy he felt racing through his veins at the simple connection of lips, and couldn’t help the smile that spread across his face as they separated and rested their foreheads against one another.
Also, no beta. Just me typing it out. All spelling, grammatical and punctuational errors are my own. But I kind of dont care. XD
Both men were moaning and panting as the sound of flesh slapping against flesh filled the hot and humid air of the bedroom. Sherlock clutched at the headboard with white knuckles when John’s hand found his way in a tight grip to his hair, he could feel his release on the edge again; but couldn’t quite tip over. He needed to stroke himself, but he was determined to obey John’s instructions of keeping his hands to himself. His heart beat pounded in his ears as John continued to fuck him, and tears began to leak from his eyes while his nerves hummed in desperate pleasure.
Sherlock nodded softly as he let the tears pour from his closed eyes while clutching John’s hand in his while his brother gave his shoulder a final squeeze before leaving. Slowly the consulting detective slipped into an exhausted dreamless.
“Picking a song of course! John it’s a duet so I expect you to sing as well. Don’t worry. You know the song.” Sherlock spouted off with a dismissive wave of his hand.
Gently he pulled himself up to sit in the silence of the flat staring at the mostly empty room that he slept in. He still climbed each of the steps to the smaller room upstairs, he couldn’t bring himself to even touch the door to Sherlock’s room. No, that was a sacred place. No one was to enter that room. Mycroft had tried to come and box up Sherlock’s things and take them away but John had chased him out of the flat.  The doctor threw his legs out of the bed and stood on his feet with a grunt; the pain in his leg causing him limp along as he made his way to the bathroom. Shucking off his pajamas and pants he spared a glance at the shattered mirror on the wall before turning on the shower. The glass was cracked, each line spidering out from the initial point where John’s fist had made contact with it 5 months after the fall.
“I am just simply John Watson, a useless invalided doctor who can’t find a job anywhere. A pathetic excuse with no direction left in his life. I don’t see why anyone would want me to stay with them.”
“Here let me walk with you since it’s just a little ways away and I have some time before I need to be at work.” John nodded and started to make his way to the next building over where Ella’s office was.
Sherlock breathed through his nose in an attempt to slow his breathing as John slipped his fingers in the waist of the trousers and pulled them down quickly, along with his shoes, leaving him bare and spread out on the sheets. Kneeling beside the bed John began to press soft kisses up the inside of the taller man’s thighs; making his way to where Sherlock’s cock was waiting for him. Sherlock shuddered as he felt John’s breath ghosting across his balls and making its way up his shaft. Closing his eyes, he dropped his head down on the pillow as John took the head of his cock between his lips and began to suck on it.
The entire bar erupted into cheers and laughter at the duo’s amazing performance that could have filled Royal Albert Hall. There were big pats on the back from members of the drunk crowd as Sherlock and John made their way back to the table of their colleagues.
“Yes, Sally. John was busy and I deemed it necessary to do a good deed today. So while you and Anderson were shagging in the conference room, I have been here helping Greg do YOUR job.” Sherlock sneered at Sally as her mouth gaped open in shock. “Do close your mouth Donovan, that face on you is very unbecoming. If you wish to keep your affair with Anderson a secret you really should pull yourself together more before going into your superiors office.”
“Bottoms up!” Sherlock threw his drink back as John did and found himself being snogged by the army doctor as soon as the glass left his lips. Running his hands through Sherlock’s hair he gripped it tight and kissed him fiercely. His tongue sliding into Sherlock’s mouth as he deepened the kiss and drew a low groan from the younger man. Giving Sherlock’s hair a tug, he released his mouth but held tight to his hair as John turned back to the woman who was staring in shock.
It's been three days. Since... since the f-fall. John has yet to leave the flat. The walls haunt him, taunt him. But hope- hope breaks through all of that.
“John?” A hand is rested upon his shoulder. He looks up towards the priest. Ironic really. A man who believed religion to be the delusion of the small minded man (an evolutionary flaw designed to give humanity a supposed purpose), an atheist to say the least, having a religious ceremony to mark his 'passing'. Ludicrous.
“Do you read the papers?” He knows she knows. A slight anger burns within his chest. She knows so why is she forcing the words from his unwilling mouth.
His paces are small, timid and uncertain. He reaches his post and shrinks almost immediately beneath the weight of the eyes. He has a speech, but right now it doesn't seem enough. Sherlock Holmes deserves more. He has never felt so small; he has never felt so inadequate; and he has never felt so lonely.
He tries to stand but his leg gives way almost immediately. Sherlock seemed to be his antidote but he has decided to take a break. John is feeling the full and complete effects of his distance right about now.
And maybe it's the alcohol. A glass of scotch stuck permanently to his hand. It took him four days to reach for the booze. If nothing else then just to block out the voices. A simple breeze, that's all it takes for John's head to snap up in search of his detective. He just wanted a distraction.
A black car pulls up in front of him. Greg Lestrade climbs out of the front seat to hold the back door open for John.
Perhaps it's the lack of sleep. He has been plagued by insomnia. Every time he shuts his eyes, he is forced to watch Sherlock fall again. He tries to look for plot holes in his dreams- any way that Sherlock could have escaped- but he knows he's hanging on hopes.
“No comment.” He growls a little more assertive than previously. His hands ball into fists by his sides. He wants nothing more than to pull the gun from his breast pocket and shoot each and everyone of them square in the face. Sherlock's advice: a gun is necessary for any occasion, and by Job he is beginning to believe it now. “We just want to be left to grieve in peace.” He ensures his vowels are steady but he knows they won't give in. They are hunters searching for their next kill.
The flat still smells like him. A strangely comforting aroma that burns thick in his nose. The scent of a man who had gone without a shower for days but still managed to present himself as clean. The faint smell of nicotine and tar despite his adamant protests he had given up. But most prominent of all are the voices, the sounds he hears in the middle of the night. His very own ghosts.
“This phone call – it’s, er ... it’s my note. It’s what people do, don’t they – leave a note?” Confusion but also a strange sense of familiarity. A note? What for? Sherlock, he never could understand people, perhaps it was because he had transcended them or perhaps it was his overbearing arrogance. But by now John has begun to feel just as clueless.
Much like a shadow of Sherlock's previous actions, John sits cross legged in the middle of the room. He ties a small piece of elasticated string he found within the floor around his arm. Sherlock, being the compulsive perfectionist he is, has labelled each and every syringe exactly. A seven percent solution of cocaine? Not today. The highest dosage of morphine readily available? Why of course.
“Well…if you can handle my playing the violin at all hours of the night and occasional outings to act as a consultant for the Scotland Yard….then I would like you to stay John Watson. You are the first person to find my deductions ‘amazing’. Stay with me?”
"Besides, no one is here anyways." The doctor continued his quest by mouthing at his clothed erection and nuzzling it with his nose gently before unzipping the dark gray trousers and urging the older men to lift his hips so John could slide them down fully to pool at his ankles.
The moment the door clicked shut Greg leaned back in his chair and covered his face. “Bloody hell! You two are gonna be the death of me!” when he looked down beneath the desk, a fit of giggles erupted from him at the sight of John crammed awkwardly in the small space with a wicked grin on his face. John began chuckling right along with him as he tucked the DI back into his pants and he began to pull the man’s trousers up before crawling out from under the desk.
Carefully John crossed the threshold into the room and sat himself on the edge of the bed and listened to the rain beat against the windows, the only sound in the flat.
"Well then, we must find a way to relax you then won't we. Put your mind at ease. To make sure the paperwork is done properly." The shorter man made his way in front of Greg and captured his lips in a filthy kiss. "I have not had my hands on you in three days." The doctor's voice whispered across the older man's lips as he spoke. "And that my dear detective inspector is completely unacceptable." John dove back in, running his tongue along the seam of the DI's lips before thrusting his tongue past the barrier; burying and licking his way all around the man's mouth. The groan that erupted from the DI was positively obscene as the doctor ran his hand down his chest to lightly palm at the silver haired man's cock that had begun tenting his trousers.
"I have to at least get this stack finished before I go. Otherwise I'll be tearing my hair out tomorrow. I just want this case to be over with." Greg shut his eyes as he felt John rolling his chair out from the desk and running his hands up and down the detective's chest slowly in a calming manner.
“Now let’s get you home Detective Inspector. I know you need sleep, and probably won't be able to, but at least you will be in our arms and able to relax.” John’s eyes were full of understanding and sadness as he took Greg by the hand and walked them towards the door and waited til Sherlock peeked his head in for the all clear and the three of them left hand in hand towards Baker Street. Towards Home.
“Please!” he just couldn’t take it anymore. “Please, fuck me. I need your cock in me! I need to feel that bar dragging across my insides! Please. JUST FUCK ME!”
That single ashtray was just one of the many happy happy memories John had of his time with Sherlock. Though living with Sherlock had been a difficult trial a great deal of the time it was what he loved most about him. Every second with that man was an adventure, a new experience.
“Tell me what you want.” John said in a hushed voice as his lips continued to lather attention to his neck
“Fancy to pick up where you left off?” John had a mischievous glint in his eyes before he closed them again and began swaying to the music; turning his back on Sherlock who just stood in shock. No one ever flirted with him unless there was ulterior motive; almost always drugs or money.  Finally his body and brain caught up and stepped forward again running his hands over that gorgeous arse and gripping John’s hipbones. He was rewarded as John pressed his arse back into his groin and began to grind back against him as the music pounded through the air. The moment their bodies connected Sherlock’s usually busy and frantic mind calmed to silence. All there was, was he and John and their bodies moving. It was a calm that he had only ever been able to achieve when he poured himself into drugs. Nothing had tamed the storm that raged in his head.
Sherlock shook his head and waved the man off as he stood and approached the dance floor where army man was still enjoying himself as the song changed to Cryptex and the soldier changed the way he moved. Slyly, Sherlock slid himself up behind the man who was now bouncing slightly with the beat as he swayed back and forth, his head tilting forward and back as he danced. Unable to stop himself as his he came closer to the man, he crowded himself up close behind and placed his hands on the blonde man’s hips moving in sync with him.
“Oh my John…” Using his other free hand he brushed the too long fringe out of John’s face before tracing his fingers over and along the features of the man’s face; relearning each detail of the man now changed.
Sherlock’s mouth began to water at the sight of the doctor’s cock; he was very well endowed and there was a studded bar running through the head. Moaning loudly he dove forward and took John into his mouth and began to suck him in earnest, enjoying the salty tang of precome that had begun to pool in the slit of John’s cock. The man was absolutely delicious and perfect, Sherlock cataloged the way how the warm metal felt against the roof of his mouth and his throat.
Silently Sherlock made his way into room 109 of the Intensive Care Unit at St. Bartholomew’s Hospital; the room dark, save for the soft glow of the lights in the hallway. Standing just barely in the room he absorbs all of his surroundings out of habit from the last three years taking down Moriarty’s web on his own; never being able to let his guard down. He listens to the soft pattering of the rain beating against the window to the right of the bed, it hadn’t stopped raining since the day he got the call from Mycroft of the dire need for him to return home.The beeping of the heart monitor mixed with the hiss of the ventilator breathing for John causes his heart to lurch in his chest.
Sherlock pressed back onto John’s fingers seeking more sensation as the doctor pumped his fingers in and out of him while lapping around the digits as they worked. The young man’s head was swimming as his vision whited when John’s fingers crooked and the pads of his fingers began to gently stroke his prostate. Sherlock was lost now as he panted into the crook of his elbow, torn between begging him to stop and fuck him, or keep going.
John played with his fingers as he sat silently in the chair across from his therapist. It was a familiar scene, one that had been played out many times in the last three years at the insistence of Mycroft after John’s incident on the roof. John simply looked up from his lap at Ella who sat there, pen in hand, watching him expectantly.
“Doctor Watson was very lucky dear brother.” Mycroft’s voice broke through the silence of the room where he stood in the doorway.
“I find that you calm my mind in a way that no drug, drink, or other individual has in my entire existence. I feel connected in a way to you that I can’t explain and I feel extremely safe with you in my presence.”
Ella sat in her chair, her face schooled and composed as John ranted at her; watching as he began to tire. The exhaustion was written plainly on his body as he slumped back into the chair again with his head in his hands. “I just need some sleep is all.”
The John he left behind kept his hair neat and trimmed with military precision. Now it hung long and flipped out slightly about his ears and jaw line that was far too prominent due to the shorter man’s self-malnutrition. The face that was normally tanned, bright and cheerful was pale, a sign that he had not stepped foot outside in months. The dark circles that surrounded his sunken eyes telling the story of many sleepless nights.
"What about Sherlock? Doesn't he want in on the action?" Greg whispered as he allowed himself to recline back in his office chair; his eyes drifting closed in relaxation.
“What matters is that you are here now. The doctors said that he will be off the dialysis machine this afternoon and that they have cleaned all traces of the drugs from his blood and he has no liver damage and will remove the ventilator then as well. All we can do now is wait.”
When John looked again it was with a watery smile, and Sherlock could not handle sitting any longer. In a heartbeat he was on his feet and carefully but firmly wrapped himself around the smaller man’s chest; his own heaving with emotion as tears of his own pooled in his eyes.
“Well if you had done your job and just offered to do the paperwork for Greg, who has been here for the last three days if his stubble on his cheek is anything to go by he wouldn’t be so stressed.”
Silently he stared at the distorted reflection of himself until steam began to fill the bathroom before stepping into the scalding hot stream of water. He made no attempt to cool the temperature, the pain of the heat didn’t matter. He just stood and let the liquid cascade over his hair and flesh to mingle with the tears that were steadily flowing from his eyes as he silently wept. He knew that today was going to be difficult. He knew that it was going to hurt. Firmly he pressed his hand to his chest over his heart; the muscle pumping the blood through his body as it always had. Who would have thought that he would come to despise that one muscle so much for all the pain it caused him to feel. He makes no attempt to clean himself or wash his body. Only standing there in the shower with his forehead pressed against the tile til the water had begun to run cold.
John withdrew his fingers and Sherlock felt empty, but was relieved when he heard the tearing of the foil of a condom and braced himself as he felt the cold slick of lube being pressed into and around his hole.
John slapped Greg on the back before grabbing Sherlock’s hand and pushing their way through the crowd to bring themselves up on the little stage that had been set up on the end of the bar. Greg sat up a bit taller on his bar stool to see over the heads of the other patrons as a swinging jazz music started to fill the bar and his pair of lovers grinned at each other and started to sing.
Obediently he climbed onto his hands and knees as John slid in behind him. The blonde man ran his fingers gently over Sherlock’s back; fingers tracing the tattooed black wings that covered the pale flesh. Then Sherlock felt him press his palm flat and firmly between his shoulder blades urging him to lean forward on the pillows. He followed the silent order with his arse in the air as he felt two kisses placed softly right above his arse on the dimples lay there.
Sherlock brought himself closer to the doctor so their lips were just a hair away from each other and their noses bumped. “I know what you mean.”
The blonde hopped off him and set about taking off his boots and tossing them before pulling off his jeans and vest to reveal a pair of tight red pants, and climbing up the bed to settle himself on the pillows. His arousal was apparent in his pants where a damp spot had begun to develop at the head of his cock where…..wait a minute… was that? Sherlock looked up at John’s face and was met with a smug grin as he realized the taller man was thinking. Immediately interested Sherlock scrambled between the doctor’s legs and pulled the pants down off his hips, and off his legs throwing them over his shoulder.
John will survive for Sherlock, to say things he always meant to say but never say it when the consulting detective was alive.
He didn't even hesitate anymore to answer like those early times they did this. Sherlock made sure he always spoke his feeling and thoughts freely. The years of repressed feeling made him frustrated at first, but slowly, with Sherlock's patience -- the feature that still perplexed John taking Sherlock's occasional tantrum into consideration, he told him what he liked and what not. At Sherlock's part, he took it seriously and respected his 'no' as well as he treasured his 'yes'.
He thought the comfortable darkness of Sherlock's hair. The luminous light on Barth's laboratory when he first met Sherlock. The pink plump of his lips. The light brown trace of Sherlock's freckles on his back. More than that --
As the ringing bell inside his body rings, John kicks himself into action and brings himself out of Battersea Power Station. He will get an early train to Baker Street and he will think about how in the hell name he can collect 300 souls to bring Sherlock back. For now, he needs the energy given by their home.
In the breeze of the wind, the smell of upcoming people closer to the alley bristled John's raw emotion. He still saw red on his periphery and the kid's agitation was not decreasing in any moment. John hid the little boy behind his back when two men approached his alley, completed with a team that resembled cops.
he likely still be consulting detective who needs a case from Greg and whether Sherlock admits it or not, John could see how much Sherlock respected Greg although with occasional insult here and there to the entire Scotland Yard team.
Although he is not stupid enough to not know the people Mycroft places around Harry’s flat to watch Watson siblings like it would be enough to mend his broken heart
that watching him now, that he is not alone. A breeze passes him on his side and what he finds when he turns around sending a terror through all his body. A dark shadow that illuminating by moonlight through the window has a bird shaped – head and claws on his hands crawling into the pentagram slowly. Feet from him, the shadow grumbles with the voices of many people with crows’ sound in every hitch, then with a stare of deep black eyes and a smirk plastered on dark shadow’s face, John Watson cries.
. That if he opened his eyes sooner, he saw that they were in fact as good as the couple would be, Sherlock would not need to go down alone. No need to go down in the first place.
Estranged is underestimated word for describing his friendship with Greg now. Since Sherlock’s fall, he’s been avoiding Greg and Mycroft like a plague. The betrayal and the sadness when he senses them around him are overwhelming that he can’t help himself to feel angrier. Yet, those two men always tried to coax John into meeting them until Harry spoke for him and left them threatened.
His friends have assured him that surveillances around Battersea are hacked and tricked, to keep himself from Mycroft’s meddling nose of course, and his equipment are placed near the sewage planting, a big square empty room that smells like the rusty and humid place. He draws a pentagram with serpent’s blood that makes John cringing and curling his toes, but when the draw is complete, he feels the room’s temperature drops significantly which absolutely does not make sense. After he makes sure that yes no one else is in the room or God forbid in the area of summoning, he pours pure salt around the pentagram and lit perhaps a half of dozen jasmine candle from Tesco. The Belstaff coat is opened on the pentagram floor as the base of a wooden bowl filled up by Sherlock’s grave soil, feather of falcon, and fur of bull, well basically every other things that smell weird or shape so out of John’s normalcy but he tries to not put so much thought on that. The last is the blade which he bought in middle eastern somewhere through his colleague weeks ago.
I know nothing about this individual holding me prisoner. What sort of insane person is he? What does he plan to do?
"Oh, stop that! Stop giving me those--I don't do that type of thing--look. You know damn well you do that lots of times. Leave me without a fucking word!"
The tick-tocking of the clock on the mantle and the swoosh of vehicles outside only reflect my loneliness back at me.
Staring at the whip that was as of late an object of torture, I try my best to conceal my mortification. I intentionally hurt another human. What made me think it was a correct thing? The whip drops from my hand as though in contact with a scalding pot handle. I gaze with revulsion at my palm, fingers curled, and splayed out. Agitated, I twitch it. What have I done?
"He motioned for me to occupy my chair, his polished shoe first shoving it further from him. As if I had some virulent form of a disease."
Straightening up, sounding like a squeaky unoiled wheel, “oh no, we can’t do that. We’ll be a joke. No, I would be. No, no.”
If only Sherlock knew. If only I could be honest right now and utter the words needed to open up to him.
Perplexed and incapable of focusing, I race to the kitchen, knowing that John, in his scramble to leave, had left his unwashed teacup sitting in the sink.
John was the reason he had to embark on the crucial mission to foreign countries. The reason he slept in tents, on the hard, wet ground, didn't eat for days, ran through jungles barefoot, chased by howling dogs and men with rifles. Persevered through all varieties of privation.
Shutting the drawer as promptly as I opened it, my breathing erratic " I--I need to make known to you, a--story, " weak from the effort just to articulate this.
Sliding in, I casually bring my thigh against his, my hand rests alongside. As my hand leaves the seat to rest on his knee, his arm wraps around my shoulder. Suddenly the tension breaks, we both laugh, and as quickly go quiet. Is it my inhaled breath I hear or both? Closer our heads meet, my eyes never leaving his lips. His thumb strokes my lower lip, his tongue follows. It's not important or relevant, which is the first to place lip to lip. Only that it happened and it feels like it never should stop.
A sound that is overwhelming, that touches my heart and says, "will this story end before midnight?"
"We ought to focus on--" his hand secures my jaw, those strange greenish eyes gazing intently, "Necking is the fitting word, am I correct?"
He's puffing heavily, albeit not from ascending the stairs, but from some situation that has taken place only an hour, no forty-five minutes exactly.
I feel and hear the reaction: stiffness, an intake of breath. Touching the popcorn bag my hand moves ever steadily down until I'm at the crease in his trousers. A bulge is beginning.
There could be no other answer for the knowledge I possess of his characteristics, his habits, his sound.
His eyebrows raise, his smile condescending as if belying the truth,  "well, if what you say is true, and if I jumped off a roof, I guess he missed the ' looking after me' part."
The unforeseen softness in Sherlock's voice is startling, "Do you know that a shark must keep swimming while he's sleeping?"
" Sherlock, if you want to use my laptop could you please do a load of dishes for me? I'm tired of seeing your dirty dishes around the house, and Mrs. Hudson will not always be here to help. Besides, why bother her."
Overcome, I climb on, my legs astride his hips. Crushing my body onto his, I brush my lips on his neck. "No," his voice firm," no kissing." Pleasure floods my limbs. I shudder, and my hand extends down to sheath our members together. I can't control my urgency. The mere touch, this simple sensation of his body, his member touching mine, brings me to a closure almost instantly. His hip lifts, trembles, and his semen swirls onto our bodies.
Confounded at all that happened, I endeavored to comprehend how it is that John is now sitting before me.
A ladder-a fucking as hell ladder-and abruptly halt as the birth of my nightmare is presently before my eyes.
Eventually, I'll hear her climbing the steps, those lovely buns stacked on a plate just waiting for me to devour them with tea.
"Alright, go. I'm sure you have more significant things to do than gossip," she waves her hand in dismissal.
“You were too cock-sure of yourself. You found me in an undesirable environment and knew nothing of my background. Assumed I'd behave myself.”
The doctor who stepped into his life from the first encounter at Bart's Hospital and effectively grew to be an indispensable component of Sherlock.
"For what reason would you make that supposition? People are reprobates. How and for what reason did you guess I'd comply with your notions of expectation? I could have stolen, ravished you, and left you there to wallow in your excrements. It could have been days before the proprietor found you. If you persevere in these ventures, your life is in question,” drumming my fingers on the arm of the seat, mindful of his displeasure and at same moment covetous of his approval.
“It began two months ago. It was a day just like today weather-wise. Really nice, it was. We had concluded with the police paperwork on the Finelli jewelry robbery."
"I was supposed to meet Moriarty on the roof. He had threatened to eliminate my friends--," he sighed acidly," yes, John--friends. Molly, Greg, and Mrs. Hudson--and you. Mycroft and I calculated the odds of my compromising myself. We instituted a series of codes on my phone by which I knew the events of the moment. I ascended the steps instead of the elevator, and by the time I reached the third floor, the awaited signal came. By eliminating the assassins, I was safe to return home."
“Nothing shocks me coming from your mouth,” John snickers, his fingers dance a tune on the arm of his chair.
He could not err in Doctor John Watsons' perception. If he did, John was, as always, prepared to rage at him, to uncover his deficiencies. And attempt to rectify them.
“Walk,” he says, as if he reads my thoughts, “It will only make you value the beverage and the respite even more.”
“Those pictures,-- my fantasy. How I wished it would be if we were more than flatmates. I, no, don’t interrupt -- fancied you years ago but scared shitless to admit it. You can toss me out right now,” giving it my all.
He paces from his chair to the kitchen, over to the window, and back to the leather armchair, then sits.
"She took out a handkerchief from her pocket and wiped her eyes. I couldn't comprehend her words. What caused her to utter something so ridiculous? What would possess her to tell such a story? She continued to fuss. She didn't know what to say or do and asked if I needed help in removing all of your--at which she began to cry. I stood and gently ushered her to the door, saying I could manage alone.
I'm happy watching the children while they call each other to come to see the fishes. Their commotion, their steady running between us, appears to be irritating Sherlock. I can hear his under breath snarls.
"Call out as much as you chose. The proprietor is apathetic concerning what occurs in these rooms as long as there are no dead bodies. I have engineered this for your benefit. You are naive with regards to requesting sex from strangers. You have been exceptionally fortunate in those undertakings. Up until now."
The memory of it choked, and I covered my face. Beyond being careful of what Sherlock thought of my behavior. Beyond worrying what he would read into this.
"I thought of calling Lestrade. If anything was the matter, I know Greg would have called. Even picked up my phone and almost hit your brother's number but stopped. If you were--."
Be nice, John. Patient. Somewhere in my heart, it is something more- - something that keeps drawing me in. Something that enjoys being near this ever-changing person.
I suck in a breath! That's an incredible amount for someone I've only met and in a grimy pub. No guarantees he even knows what he's doing.
"Dinner with me, you were going to ask. Boring!" drawing near, sniffing, “Your cologne. Run of the mill."
"Goodness, yes," breathless. I rise, very reluctantly, smooth my pants do my best to conceal my erection, and, "I'd prefer to return home. I need time to process this. Also, to discuss this new situation with Mike."
He looks at both myself and the teacher, and whispers, "she's excellent. I felt her head, and it's a minor impact."
"Well, since you are challenging me, here goes," John assuming his military stance, chin up, chest out, shoulders back, stomach tucked in.
Mike chooses that moment to come down the hall. "Wow! Who the heck sent those? Who? Who?" He's gazing at the roses in a ceramic blue and white vase.
“ At the time in question, we strode out of the police station and began to walk down the street. Exactly like today.”
" He's near mid-chest on me, military-cut blonde hair, blue eyes," articulating nearly an octave higher.
Even more startling is the two cups, sugar bowl, two spoons, and a plate holding croissants placed on the table.
Sherlock's mouth opens, ready with a remark, probably one of ridicule, but I bring up my hand, “no, don't, don't go there, don't even try.”
If there was something he needed to say to redirect the approaching marriage, some essential awareness that nudged at him, that was nearly at the edge of being spoken; he suppressed it.
Lunging at him with both legs, smacking him in the chest, I'm enough of off-kilter as not to affect. My kicks are like taps on his body.
“And for what purpose was the research done?” I ask, crossing my arms. She strikes me as self-indulgent. Colored red hair, a silk flowered long-sleeved shirt, and white palazzo pants and certainty about life that money bestows on one.
"I knew I had left it someplace easy to find. Here," stretching over the counter, clutching a card between her fingers.
“John,” never taking his eyes off the disarray in front of him, “come look at this,” and gingerly picks out one photograph.
When we enter the old pubs' establishment, the odors of cheap beer and wine are strong. The crowd is more youthful then we are. I should have figured that into the equation. After all, our staff is young. A cacophony--between people talking, televisions blaring sports events, the glasses banging on wood and the hip-hop music. Talking becomes shouting, becomes leaning into someone's ear to gain attention.
"Oh dear," her hands dancing from face to dress and back, "you are ill, aren't you?" winding her fingers around the edges of her apron, she replies timidly, "you moved in here over two months ago. And you've been searching for a flatmate. Do you remember the two nice gentlemen that answered your advert last month? You all but threw them out--thought they were idiots--to quote yourself."
He nods a yes and I stretch my hand out for him to continue, "months ago, she asked me out, and we've been seeing each other almost every night. I was quite frank with her about my sexuality. And she's okay. It seems she has no interest in sex. Claims to be asexual. All she wants is a husband and a good home. We've agreed to marry and adopt a child. And Dad probably won't mind about adoption."
“Stand back or I'll have to hold you in contempt.” A small smile tugs at his lips, as if trying to reassure John.
He needs something to block out the pain. Over the counter drugs never did work but the sheer euphoria of an IV pumping morphine through his bloodstream comes to mind. Suddenly he craves the feeling of weightlessness all over again, but he isn't sure whether to get rid of the pain or to get rid of Sherlock if just for a while.
“Into the mind of a sociopath.” Beneath the mattress? Too obvious. In the pocket of a spare coat? He has lots of coats but alas no. Too simple. John never proclaimed to be a genius, in fact for from it. He is but a simple minded, subservient man but now is his chance to declare a new found intelligence. If pain can do anything, it can motivate him to find the gold.
“Whatever happened to 'you and me against the rest of the world'”. Everyday John writes. Every godforsaken day he takes out his laptop and types what ever is on his overly intoxicated mind. “You promised.” Some days he is just one drink away from posting his entire internal monologue but he never does. His blog was for his and Sherlock's adventures, he doesn't want to ruin that. His creative space is reserved ready for when Sherlock returns.
Two weeks and one day. His leg itches. The pain returns. It feels as if a bullet is attempting to claw its way out. His limp- psychosomatic. The bullet never resided within his leg. His shoulder was the victim but the agony is returning.
The shattered carcass of a phone, tossed onto the ground, sits near his feet. He is frozen still. His body shakes. That phone, his note, all of it. He can't do this anymore.
Every morning Mrs Hudson would set a cup of tea in a space beside John (wherever he would be) and at noon she'd return to find it stone cold and untouched.
“Was it really suicide?” One of the vultures shouts over the noise. A microphone is thrust towards his mouth but he has no intention of answering the question. 'No it was not a suicide. Sherlock is not dead. He isn't dead.'
“I'd be lost without my blogger.” THEN WHY AREN'T YOU HERE NOW. John is lost without his arrogant, annoying dick of a consulting detective too. Their lives are part of one eternity. Without the other, John is incomplete. He is like the Earth without his sun. Drifting, with no centripetal force to to steady him; no heat to give him purpose. He has no friends, no job, nothing.
It is not at all out of place to find Sherlock's stash here. This is where he sits when he sets himself up on a high.
With one hand he knocks lightly on the wood trying to find a hollowed out section in which one could hide all manner of things. Funny how an addict's mind works when denied the thing they crave most. With each tap the echo seems to increase ever so slightly. It is clear when John hits his mark. The dullness in the background of the knock has gone.
“No comment.” John mutters but the syllables catch in his throat. He has barely spoken since that day. He was always afraid of what might come out.
“Sherlock Holmes” written in a gold font across a black marble headstone. A headstone approximately two foot high- that's all he gets. Maybe its because they know. If he is dead, which John is sure he isn't, then of course he deserves better.
Clad in a black suit, he walks out of the door of 221b Baker Street. Cameras strobe and flash in front of his face. Reporters scream his name, the kind of attention he once lusted for but now despises. He would rather be a recluse. He wishes no knew his name, or his identity.
“John? John?” The scream, all eager for the scoop on one of the hardest days of Watson's life. They can't even give him this one day in peace. It's all, always about Sherlock.
The priest signals towards the head of the coffin, suspended above a six foot pit in the ground. Six feet deep seems unnecessary. He's hardly going to claw his way back out... and even if he does, at least he's alive.
The thought alone raises him to his unsteady feet before lowering him to his knees atop the ground. He knows Sherlock better than pretty much anyone and he is certain his stash is somewhere close.
Two weeks. Mrs Hudson began to notice more and more that John wasn't coping. His brave face had failed. He barely ate, he barely slept, he barely got dressed. His diet consisted of a litre of scotch and two hours sleep a day.
“Look, I find it difficult... I find it difficult, this sort of stuff.” He has to say something but the screwed up speech within his pocket isn't enough. For the great Sherlock Holmes it never could be. No amount of words can ever describe the impact the detective has had on John's life. “You were the best and wisest man...” He breathes in deeply. The words feel wrong within his mouth. He shouldn't be saying this. None of this. Sherlock is not dead. “that I have ever known. And I forgive you.” Of course he does. That is the most profound thing he can say in that moment. If Sherlock is alive, John is sure he'd be listening in. He has to known. He has to know it's okay.
“And the fighting! Drove me up the wall with all his carryings-on!” John turns to look at her out of the corner of his eye. This is supposed to be his moment of self acceptance but all he seems to want to do is defend Sherlock. He is supposed to be moving on.
