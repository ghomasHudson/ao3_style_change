Dean shakes his head and gets out of bed. He’s fully dressed including his boots. What the hell? There’s something in his pocket. He pulls it out and finds a few lines of smudged writing that he can’t read except for two words: “Love, Cas.”
“I’m sorry you’re so lonely.” Castiel stands up. “May I touch you?”
“Go through the drawer.” Cas curls up on the bed.
The windows are down and the sun shines brightly overhead as they drive.
It’s becoming hard to breathe and not because of the tightness of Dean’s hug. Tears sting Castiel’s eyes and any remaining words get caught in Castiel’s throat as he hugs Dean back tightly.
Next Time:
Castiel freezes. If Dean shoots him, he could kill him. And if Dean kills him now, will
“It looks a lot better than it did. I mean, you still need to take care of it, but you’re healing.” Dean says.
Castiel turns heel and runs back to Dean’s dorm. He fumbles around with his card a few times before finally getting the stupid door open. He sprints through the dorm, nearly running into two people, and skids to a stop in front of Dean’s door. He knocks.
“Do you
“I will see you soon,” Cas says. “Close your eyes, Dean.”
“That sounds fun.”
“Thank you.”
, Benny wants to watch
It’s how Castiel feels about his father. No matter how much he wishes he could just hate him, he can’t.
“I don’t know why I’m so nervous.” Benny says as he adjusts his bowtie. He keeps fumbling and messing it up.
Dean nods. “Yeah, let’s go.”
“Cas!
“No, I suppose it’s not.” Castiel smiles at Dean.
Dean groans. “This is so frustrating. If he
Castiel kicks himself for his suggestion.
“See? There’s a good thing right there. Here’s another.” Dean smiles and then kisses Castiel.
“Yes. People of the same gender are allowed to get married in the U.S. in 2021.”
Castiel feels like he has been hit. Dean’s question is asked in a soft voice but that doesn’t stop the guilt from pouring onto Castiel like rain. “I did my best. Something happened.” Castiel says.
It’s Cas’s turn to play a song. Cas claimed this would be a fun way to get to know each other in terms of taste in music and Dean figures that’s true. It’s also…a little revealing in a way Dean hadn’t expected. Dean feels like he has laid down many cards he didn’t mean to today. But he knows that Cas did too, so Dean doesn’t mind going through all the songs they’re both willing to share. It’s all about sharing anyway. Nobody’s revealing anything they don’t want to.
“You’re only twenty-two?” Castiel whispers.
“Still. Let’s get you some warm clothes just to be safe.”
An hour later, Castiel is sitting in a bar that he cannot recall the name of, pulling a pile of money towards him. “Thanks everyone,” he says.

He knows Castiel from Hell. He must be a demon.
Everyone else is in the living room having a spirited debate over which movies to watch for the marathon. Charlie wants to watch the

“Oh, I’ve had him. He’s nice in a gruff sort of way.” Castiel says.
if you want.”
Castiel wishes he were with Dean right now so he could stare into his beautiful eyes. They’re so green they look fake. Sometimes Castiel gets distracted during their conversations because Castiel’s trying to figure out the exact shade of green. They always look different when Dean wears different colors too which makes the study of Dean’s eyes all the more confusing. Dean’s eyes remind Castiel of the stems of wildflowers on his father’s estate with their various shades of green and hints of yellow.
Castiel copies Dean’s exhale.
Cas tilts his head to the side, “Like the Hootie and the Blowfish song?”
Dean.
good and there really isn’t that much good in this world which is something that’s hard to remember when I’m surrounded by all of these truly good people who have gathered here today to celebrate with us. We’re fortunate to have such an amazing family.”
“Sure?” Dean replies.
“Um, well, kinda.” Dean tries not to squirm as he speaks. “I mean, Sam and Eileen have each other. And Jack’s in Heaven doing God-stuff. You and I should stick together.”
They get coffee. Castiel gets an iced coffee peppermint mocha because today is not a day when he wants to risk burns. Dean gets something with caramel. Castiel’s hardly paying attention to Dean’s order. Instead, he’s checking the time and trying to figure out how to get Dean downstairs in three minutes.
Dean grins. Cas was cute pre-cat. Now he’s just getting cuter. “Wow, I love you.” Dean says to himself.
Castiel hugs Dean tightly.
“I,” Castiel whispers. “I am willing. Of course, I am. This—you—are all I’ve ever wanted.”
“Are you happy, Cas?” Dean asks.
They stay like this for a while. Then Dean lets go and walks to the passenger seat. Castiel gets into the driver’s seat and puts the keys in the ignition.
Dean smiles. Then he frowns again and asks, “Are you really okay?”
and Dean has come home to Cas crying on the couch with books scattered all over the living room more than once. It’s a lot. Cas can do it, but it’s a lot. Dean refuses to put any more stress on Cas right now.
Before Dean can reply, the fire-alarm goes off right as Cas shouts, “Holy motherfucking fire! Shit! Shit! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fucking! Motherfucking shit-fuck!”
“Are you
“I’m not sure that would be wise.” Castiel says.
Meg-I was just about to text you. We need to have a Halloween movie-night next year. You, me, and Dean. We need to make it happen. See who gets a shitty pumpkin drawing!
Finally, Cas says, “I know you wanted today to be perfect and now we’ve got a melted microwave in the kitchen. I’m sorry for the added stress.”
Cas: You’re not supposed to make me cry on graduation day.
“Wait. What?”
Castiel is relieved that Dean agrees to go with him. He has been trying to figure out a good time to give Dean today’s gift. Sam and Eileen woke up uncharacteristically early this morning, so Castiel did not get his morning time alone with Dean.
“Okay, who’s Jack?”
Neither of them says anything for a few minutes and Castiel almost wonders if Dean is asleep, but he is not breathing deeply enough for him to fully believe he has fallen asleep.
“I wanted to see you and Sam. That was apparently a mistake.” Dean clenches his fists.
“Are we going to put anything out for Santa Claus? We’ve watched all those movies that featured him, and they all said you have to put cookies out for him! Why did he come if we didn’t put cookies out for him the other years?” Jack asks.
They stop talking for a while again.
“I know what you mean. A walk-in closet really can’t compare to memories.”
“The flowers are beautiful,” Jack says.
Dean looks at his phone again and sends Cas a reply.
Half an hour later, Dean has cleaned the floor, Cas has changed into bee pajamas, and Dean has found a trashcan and placed it by Cas’s bed.
Dean shakes his head. He’s putting too much pressure on this. He really is. And in his rational moments, he understands that, but he just…right now he just can’t stop himself from spiraling and he feels like he’s clawing at the surface of normalcy, but he just can’t reach it. He
And wouldn’t it change their relationship if they lived together?
Dean feels his face flush and he can’t help but look away. “Okay, let’s find you some cold weather clothes.”
Cas remembers them, but he doesn’t want to help. He starts to walk away.
Charlie laughs. “He was there two weeks ago. He and Garth were there last week. See?”
“Riptide” -Vance Joy
Now Dean is tired, and he wants to go to bed, but he can’t.
“Cas, we need to find you some clothes. Where are they?” Dean asks.
Meg lets go of Castiel and says, “All right, I’ll let you go to the bathroom now.”
“Cas, I was worried about you. Don’t try to make me feel bad for that.”
Dean hesitates and won’t look Castiel in the eyes for a few moments, but then he takes the present, gently puts his hand on Castiel’s face and kisses his forehead. “You’re too good to me, Cas.” Dean says.
“Oh yeah? What did Sammy say?”
And there Cas goes with that earnest-eyes-thing of his that makes Dean feel like
Benny laughs.
They play the game.
It’s still December 23, 2001 when Dean wakes up to find Cas sitting on the edge of the bed, listening to Dean’s Walkman again.
“Castiel, you’re wonderful. You’re my best friend and I love you. You are also overcomplicating this for yourself because you have such a big heart, and you care way too much. You need to chill. Try to stop freaking out about this. Dean is not going to care if you add a comma or if you don’t. He’s just going to care that you reach out. You have been talking to him fairly frequently in person already. Trust your judgement. And for what it’s worth, I would throw in a hug right about now, but I’m literally at Walmart in my two-hour break before my statistics class and you’re wherever you are, so that’s not going to happen. Just be yourself. Because you’re awesome and it’s his loss if he doesn’t like you back. Got it?”
Pumpkin meows.
Dean grins.
Dean falls asleep again.
Dean chuckles and shakes his head.
A cool wave of…something…something gentle and soft but chilled rushes through Dean. Dean’s back is no longer bleeding, the hole is closed, the bruises and gashes he has accumulated from the fight are also gone. Dean’s heart feels like there’s barbed wire around it.
“Holy shit is right,” Dean signs.
Dean looks at Cas. “You were doing it wrong.”
“Perhaps, but this will go more smoothly if we get along.”
Castiel cannot recall another time in his life when he has felt he has nothing to prove. Dean does nothing to pressure Castiel into proving his love for him. Dean just…allows Castiel to exist as he so chooses. And it makes loving Dean so easy.
Dean shrugs.
Despite the moving, Dean is a relatively light sleeper, so Castiel does not dare move or touch Dean even though he would like to. He would like to run a hand through Dean’s hair or hold the hand that clutches at his shirt. He would like to move in general because his legs are cramping, but he does not mind remaining still. He enjoys these moments in the early morning.
“I want to.” Castiel shrugs. “I enjoy spending time with you.”
Dean looks at the clock. It’s only 11AM. “We should do something fun.” Dean tells Cas.
Dean revs the engine and yells, “Get out of the way!”
Castiel sits shotgun beside Dean in the Impala. The car looks the same on the inside too. Dean takes good care of Baby.
Castiel kisses Dean back, relishing in the fact that he is here. He is
It’s Friday already. Dean still hasn’t finished his story for Ellen.
He puts his hand out for a high-five. Castiel gives Dean a high-five.
“I love you.” Dean says one more time.
“I enjoy sitting in the kitchen, drinking coffee, and contemplating life.”
It is December 13, 2020. It is 7:35AM and Castiel is frantically trying to put out the fire in the oven. How did things go wrong so quickly? He thought he followed the instructions. What did he do wrong?
“What’s not true? That you are an enormous burden on the Winchesters or that Dean doesn’t love you?”
Dean turns out the light, takes Castiel’s hand, and crawls under the covers beside him. “I’m right here,” Dean says. “And I’m not going anywhere. I’m gonna take care of you, for once. Like you’ve done for me all these years.”
It is 11:40pm on December 24, 2020. They spent the whole day playing with Pumpkin and watching Christmas movies. Dean and Jack made cookies for Santa. When Jack went to bed, everyone put everyone’s gifts under the tree, including one for Jack that said it was for Santa. Now, Castiel is lying in bed beside Dean. Pumpkin is lying on Castiel’s chest, purring as Dean scratches behind her ear.
The first image that flashes through Dean’s mind is Castiel’s wide blue eyes and he immediately types his response.
May 10, 2024
Castiel skips “Farewell Wanderlust” by The Amazing Devil. He’s not ready to listen to that song in front of Dean yet. He’ll probably cry, and he doesn’t want to do that today. The song that comes on after is “Take Me To Church” by Hozier.
Dean snuggles closer to Cas. Dean feels warm and loved and for the first time in a while, he doesn’t have any nightmares.
Castiel smiles. “Yeah, it is.”
“I’m content doing whichever you would wish. I don’t need sleep,” Castiel is cut off by a yawn.
Dating Cas is being constantly scared and happy at the same time because Dean’s so excited they’re doing this and so,
“I wish you would stop calling Dean that.” Castiel says without looking at Crowley.
the case, then Dean needs to talk to the fridge too because he’d love some help right now.
“This is,” Castiel whispers, breathless. “This is good.”
“Let’s go.” Dean says.
“Dean?” Cas whispers.
“That is one argument he has chosen not to involve himself in.”
bad.”
Sam signs.
Dean grins and takes Castiel’s hand, squeezing three times. Castiel smiles at Dean and returns the pressure. Dean’s smile widens.
Dean doesn’t know what to say.
“Okay; I’ll try to hang back. I’m just excited to take another one of your classes.”
Cas chuckles and turns the music up. Then he joins Dean.
“Yes, but not nearly as funny as the orange juice spurting out of her nose. It was the funniest disgusting thing I’ve ever seen.”
help me with my hair?”
“I wonder how long it was in here.”
Dean turns to see Cas standing beside him. “Hey dear heart,” Dean gives Cas a peck on the cheek.
“Well, thanks, Cas. I appreciate this.” Dean says.
Cas: Oh, who am I kidding?
“Oh, I need to bring my mug.” He says, grabbing the mug off Dean’s desk. “I cannot wait to use it.”
This one is a little angsty and Dean contemplates things, but it has a happy chapter-ending.
Castiel feels comforted by the idea that Bobby and Ellen are clearly supportive of Dean dating Castiel.
And then it rains. And everyone shrieks and they run to the Wawa for cover, but that’s a long run and everyone except Dean is at least a little tipsy, so by the time they get to the Wawa, they’re soaked. And they’re laughing and they can’t call for a cab because they’re soaked, but Dean’s still sober and he and Cas drove here anyway, so they all pile into the car. Only they realize there aren’t enough seats, so they do the only thing that makes sense at 2:13AM. They put Garth in the trunk. Garth goes willingly, but it’s still so awkward and funny and probably illegal and Dean really can’t believe they’re doing this, but they do it anyway. They make it to the apartment, and everyone borrows clothes from Dean and Cas.
“I have functional eyes, Dean.”
kind and funny and you laugh at all his corny jokes. If you two start a family, my brother definitely has the dad-jokes covered.”
Castiel smiles and winces at the pain in his face. He’s glad that the light is so dim; hopefully that means Gabriel won’t see the bruise on his face from where their father hit him yesterday.
Cas smiles. “
“Thank you, Dean.” Castiel takes his own sip.
Sam smiles.
Dean’s heart drops. He didn’t get Cas anything.
“How’s your head?” Dean asks.
Castiel’s heart flutters at Dean’s ridiculousness, but he rolls his eyes at Dean, unable to stop himself from smiling at him as he says, “And you’re insufferable.”
Castiel chuckles. “Then I suppose we
Dean lets go of Cas and says, “Fine, but you lead the way to the porta-johns.”
Castiel can’t move. He’s watching Dean serenade him at their wedding and wondering if this is a dream.
“Fine. I was just thinking about all the shit that I put you through.”
But he doesn’t
And Cas is just a guy. Totally human. He passed all the tests Dean could think of to make sure he’s just a human. Cas even pointed out that the fact that his skin didn’t immediately heal after being cut with a silver blade meant that he isn’t an angel because angels apparently have self-healing abilities.
Sammy: Jerk
“Yeah, that would make
“Six?” Everyone except Dean repeats.

“Sorry for what, Dean?” Cas won’t even look at him now.
the cruelty he faced at the hands of you and his father. Do not presume that you did him any favors when you abandoned him.”
“Yeah, well, driver picks the music, Cas.” Dean shrugs, glancing over to see Cas roll his eyes at him.
“Dean?” Castiel whispers, hardly able to hear himself over his racing heart.
“Well, we have cobblers—cherry and peach, we have pie—obviously,” Patricia grins, “we also have cakes. There’s strawberry, vanilla, chocolate, and lemon.”
“Wait; so, you’re telling me that you think it must be difficult for me to think?”
While he’s in the bathroom, he checks his phone. Crowley has sent him three texts checking to see if he’s okay. Castiel replies saying he’s with Dean and Crowley sends a series of sexualized fruit emojis. Because of course he did and honestly what did Castiel expect?
be this nice? What the hell does he do to deserve something this good?
“Go lie down. Go through my stuff and get my Walkman. Listen to some music; that might help. I’ll finish this.”
“Want to play a game?”
Castiel stares at the sleeping man beside him until his own eyes grow heavy. Finally, Castiel succumbs to sleep.
,” Dean says as if that’s enough of an explanation. It is to Dean. He doesn’t understand why it’s not enough for Sam.
Dean wipes the grin from his face. His dad would be furious if Dean could see him now. Not because Dean has the hots for the guy in front of him—well, he would be pissed about that, but that’s another issue entirely—the thing Dad would be
Dean smiles as Cas pulls him close. And they dance. Cas spins Dean and Dean can see Charlie crying a little ways away from the dance area. Dean remembers that time Charlie took him to a dancing class at the Rec to get his mind off Cas and who was the instructor? Cas. Dean chuckles. That was a wild birthday.
Todd nods and heads into the back. Todd comes back out with an orange kitten with bright blue eyes that remind Dean of Cas’s eyes. “This is her.” Todd says.
Dean tenses up and freezes beside Castiel.
“Um, yeah, thanks Cas.”
Fuck it.
Dean waits. He rocks from his heel to toe, toe to heel. Then he realizes what he’s doing and stops only to find himself doing it all again a few minutes later. He also starts tapping his fingers on the side of his leg.
is Cas’s safe place. This is where he and Dean have had so many talks over so many years. This is where they’ve all eaten meals together: Cas, Jack, Sammy, and Dean. This is where they’ve all laughed and cried and grown closer. At this very table. And this is where Cas has sought refuge from something…Dean doesn’t even know what’s wrong.
“Tell me anyway.” Cas’s voice is soft, and it makes Dean feel safe…like it had even before Cas broke Dean out of the beautiful room.
“Thank you.” Castiel smiles.
“What do you think about this, Jack?” Dean asks.
Cas smiles and leans forward a little. “Can I tell you a secret?” Cas asks.
Dean freezes and all he can do is stare up at Cas.
Trigger warnings: child abuse, homophobia, foul language
“You’re safe now, buddy.” Dean whispers. “That must’ve really sucked, but you’re here now. I’ve got you.”
Always asking questions, that Dean, his Dean. Perhaps forever if Castiel’s lucky. He’s got a question to ask and a piece of jewelry he’s dying to give to Dean.
There’s just something about the way Dean said that and the way he’s looking at Castiel with this big grin on his face that fills Castiel’s whole being with joy. He feels like light is shining through him and he laughs. “I’m glad we’re friends, Dean.”
. And after
Castiel lands hard on his back. He tries to get up, but he’s slammed to the ground by a rush of wind.
Dean hugs him back. Tightly. Then less tightly. He realizes he’s holding his breath and lets it out. His eyes burn with tears that he blinks away before burying his face in Cas’s shoulder. Cas wants to leave him…just like everyone else. But he promises to come back. Nobody else has ever promised to come back. Will he
SAM: You got it, Cas. :)
Castiel tries to think of the words to describe his situation, but his brain can come up with only one phrase.
Sammy: Oh? Have you met Castiel?
The woman holds up her hand and snaps her fingers.
“Who are you calling old man?” Bobby chuckles.
“Why won’t you hunt with me now?”
Cas’s eyes widen and he whispers, “Can I touch you?”
“I didn’t do it. I just thought it was funny.” Meg shrugs.
Castiel feels a rush of affection whirl around inside of him. “Thank you, Dean.” He pulls the plate towards him, gingerly picks up the PopTart, and takes a bite. “This is better than I imagined.” Castiel explains. “They’re so colorful. I assumed they would be sweet, but they all taste so distinctly different, and the colors mean things to the flavors. I have been informed that is not always the case with food. For instance, Jack swears that the colors in candy corn all taste different, but Sam says that is impossible.”
Then Cas asks, “Why are you teaching me this?”
“Well, they’re family.”
Castiel realizes he’s smiling. He shakes his head.
“Let’s sleep.” Cas says.
“Sammy?” Dean whispers.
about him.
“You being here is a good thing.”
Cas doesn’t reply. He just snores softly beside Dean.
Dean-Still devastatingly handsome
“I trust you, Cas. You know that; don’t you?” Dean asks.
“Dean, I,” Cas sniffles, looking right at Dean. His face is blotchy and his eyes are bloodshot and tears are streaming down his face and snot’s coming out of his nose and he doesn’t look like Cas. He doesn’t look like the put-together holy tax accountant Dean’s used to. He looks so human and vulnerable and seeing him like this
. Being in love feels
There’s a gentle hand pressed against his back and three taps of a finger. Cas.
Did Dean make sure to put on deodorant?
Father approaches Castiel who quickly backs away from the table.
“And I am so sorry that I made you believe I don’t love you. I’m so sorry.” Dean says in a breaking voice. “That changes now. You’re going to wake up every day knowing that I love you.”
“Cas, you don’t need to apologize for crying.” Dean says. “Talk to me, Cas. What’s wrong?”
. Jack is singing along to the music.
There’s a bright light and Cas staggers to the ground in front of him.
“Hey, we need to get you up.” Dean’s voice is soft.
“What would you like to order?” Cas asks, nodding to Patricia.
Dean wants to say that he
Dean grabs his own jacket, and they head out to Baby to find some Christmas supplies.
Dean grins and tries to ignore the way his heart leaps when Cas looks at him and smiles.
“What would you like to know?”
“It would help if you let my friend come in. He knows more about these things and I can’t think because I have a massive headache.” Castiel says. It’s not the first time he has said this and if they do not comply with his request, it will not be the last.
Castiel really is home.
It doesn’t matter. This—what’s happening right now—is real and that’s what Dean needs to focus on. Cas. His friend. Who is…warm and…and kind and has a surprisingly gentle touch for a warrior.
Castiel wonders why Dean won’t acknowledge aloud that this room is for him. Now is certainly not the time to ask Dean about this, but he’s still curious.
Castiel cocks his head to the side as he ponders Dean’s question.
It’s Dean hugging Bobby back tightly and trying not to cry.
When they get back to the motel, Castiel’s headache is becoming impossible to ignore. It has been getting progressively worse all morning.
“Okay, Cas,” Sammy sniffles. “You’re up.”
“You know it!” Jo laughs.
“What would you do to mess things up between us?” Cas sits beside Dean.
Shit. He needs to keep that to himself.
They just got into a fight. Dean received a call about a hunt nearby. He called another hunter and assigned it to them instead of taking it himself. Instead of taking it with Castiel.
“Because he gave you a mixtape which—based on the fact that it was a Led Zeppelin mixtape which was probably full of love songs—is a romantic gesture and then you two didn’t get together until you died on him again. That makes no sense.”
“Dean,”
“Well, what do I do about that?”
Dean lies behind Castiel, wraps his arms around Castiel’s middle, and rests his head against Castiel’s back. Castiel puts his arm over Dean’s arms. Castiel feels warm and it’s not just because of the cozy blankets on the room’s (Dean’s) bedding.
for making me the happiest person I know.”
“Goodnight, Dean.” Meg says in a sing-songy voice.
Castiel is touched. Once again surprised by Dean’s kindness.
Castiel trips and lands hard on his hands and knees.
Please pick up.
Dean shrugs. “I don’t know. We don’t have to do it if you don’t want to.”
“That was good.”
Castiel finds himself thinking about “Not Yet/Love Run (Reprise)” by The Amazing Devil again.
each other. It’s not a matter of earning. It’s a matter of choice—which is better in my opinion.”
“I can help you look for it if you want. It’s okay that you can’t go on our date today. We could go tomorrow or Friday or something. I don’t mind waiting.”
“Drop it.” Cas snaps, yanking his wrist out of Dean’s grasp, and wiping his eyes on his sleeve.
Dean runs after Sam, signing,
“Hey Cas, I’m gonna go. Okay? I’ll see you when you get here.” Dean says.
“Dean, you’ve been driving since 6pm yesterday. It’s 4am now. Please let me drive. You must be tired.”
“Castiel, you know the rule,” Father begins.
Dean nods along as Cas talks even though he doesn’t exactly have much to say on the subject of sunrises.
How can it be all bad if being human is also making coffee for Dean in the middle of the day? And seeing his soft smile when Castiel hands him the mug? How can it be all bad if it’s also having tea with Sam? And swapping stories from the times when Castiel remembers roaming through different people’s Heavens and finding softness and comfort in unexpected places while Sam swaps the happy moments in his childhood and time in college? How can it all be bad if it’s also drinking margaritas with Eileen, chatting about the latest nature documentaries they’ve watched and having secret dance parties when neither of them can sleep? Laughing as they dance (badly because Castiel does not know how to dance). How can it be all bad if Castiel gets to go on drives and listen to songs by Nicki Minaj and Taylor Swift and Megan Thee Stallion and Beyonce and Demi Lovato and Led Zeppelin and whatever else Castiel happens to put on at the time? Now that he’s human he wants to consume everything. He wants to savor every moment and he can’t do that if he sees everything as horrible. He just can’t. This doesn’t stop the nightmares. It can’t. But it helps the day. It gives him hope on the days when he can’t get out of bed, and it gives him peace in the nights when he can’t seem to fall asleep.
Cas sniffles and nods. “This will take some getting used to.” His voice cracks a little.
Everyone smiles and goes back to work.
His father just stares at him. There’s something akin to shock or perhaps even a little fear in his father’s eyes. Good.
Jack launches into a story about the most beautiful sandcastle he has ever made. Apparently, it was three stories tall and he built it with his older sister, Claire.
“Um, Father, he,” Castiel says. “He hit me...yesterday.”
“Sure, you can. It’s cold out. You already ran across the Sunken Garden. You can go back and do the last part when it’s not freezing outside.” Dean says, suddenly feeling weirdly protective over his dorky classmate.
“We love you too.” Meg and Crowley reply at the same time.
“Okay. And Meg? Say goodnight to Cas. He’s about to fall asleep on me.” Dean says.
“You are spending all your time with a man. You share a bed. You do unholy things with him.” Father says. He continues talking, but Castiel feels as though he is underwater.
Dean’s eyes widen at that stanza. He freezes.
“We love you too,” Charlie replies.
“It’s not just a bracelet.” Castiel explains. He goes into his desk drawer and pulls out his bracelet. “It’s a touch bond bracelet. You have a blue one and I have a green one. It’s so if we ever end up separating again, we can still share touches.”
Cas pulls away a little. His hands are on Dean’s shoulders. Their faces are mere inches apart. Dean can feel Cas’s breath on his face. Cas’s cheeks are a little red and he’s smiling at Dean.
But if Cas isn’t who he says he is, who the hell is he?
“Leaving so soon?” One of the poker players asks.
anyone who thinks there is.
“He’s lucky it’s warm here or I’d go cut his hair or something.” Dean mumbles.
Dean takes Castiel’s hand in his and pinches Castiel’s palm. It doesn’t hurt, but Castiel does feel it. Pinching does not belong in dreams; therefore, this must be real.
by Jane Austen.
“He is good to me. That was years ago, and he had a good reason for asking me to stay away.” Cas says.
“What did you mean by you remember me?” Castiel asks.
or something else?”
“I agree. Will you marry me, Dean?”
shit. I want to allow myself that. Because of the thing that I want most. Cas, it’s something we can both have—if you’re willing.”
A few minutes later, Dean crawls into the bed beside Castiel. He’s under the covers this time.
“Simple Song” -The Shins
“So yeah, these two love each other so friggin’ much. It’s nearly nauseating. But mostly it’s sweet and sincere. You can tell that they mean it. They’re not putting a show on for anyone. They just enjoy spending time with each other and that’s why they’re here. To make a promise to stay together long-term while their world watches. So now that you’ve heard from the Dean and Cas of the past, you’re going to hear from the Dean and Cas of today.” Sam says. “Okay, Dean. I’ll let you take it away.”
“Why do you ask?” Castiel asks.
“No, you don’t. I’m just a burden. Movie nights are not of import. You have plenty of friends. You don’t need me.”
Sammy: What can I say? Mom’s my favorite and she’s doing you a solid. I heard Castiel was cute.
Dean shakes Cas’s hand. Cas’s grip is firm but not painful. It’s not like shaking hands with his dad or his dad’s hunter friends. Cas has this confidence about himself—like he doesn’t need to prove how masculine he is. He just
up to?” Sam smirks.
“You gotta admit, it’s funny.” Dean yells. “So, fucking funny!”
Dean blinks. “Well, Cas, you always need food.”
to be here. That’s the worst of it. There’s nothing I want more…well, besides,” Castiel shakes his head. “It doesn’t matter.”
Cas just laughs. “Did you see his face when Crowley threatened him?”
Jack turns to Castiel and asks, “Can we Cas?”
Castiel looks at Dean. “What’s that?” he asks.
And at this point, Castiel is starting to worry about who could possibly be calling him so many times? What is so urgent that could warrant so many calls?
“Dean, you…you don’t mean that.” Cas’s voice is ragged. He takes his hand out of Dean’s and says, “This is going to hurt.” He yanks Dean from the wall and touches Dean’s forehead.
The problem is, Castiel’s not sure why Dean’s doing all this. Does Dean feel sorry for him now that he knows about Castiel’s father?
Castiel’s lying on his back in his bed reading
“Then, there’s only one thing left to do.”
Dean smiles and kisses Cas. Cas kisses him back.
“How do you feel?”
Castiel tries to copy him.
Dean lunges at Naomi. Naomi laughs and snaps her fingers. Castiel’s world goes dark.
Plus, Dean is excited right now and Castiel just wants to bask in Dean’s joy and excitement.
What did it cost?
Dean can only stare as Cas looks at him with tear-filled eyes. “Cas, I,” Dean starts.
“I know.” Meg hugs Castiel back. “I love you too.” Meg hugs Castiel a little tighter. “It’s stupid, but I feel like I’m giving you away.”
“We met in class.” Dean says.
“I…I don’t,”
“Yeah, it’s Dean—not your Dean. It’s the 2001 Dean. And I need you to breathe. Okay?” Dean takes in a deep breath and says, “In.” He releases his breath. “And out.” He repeats the process. “In. And out. In. And out. In. And out.”
They hold hands and walk outside together.
Oh shit.
“You like him, and you haven’t given him yours because you’re scared.”
“Yep,” Dean pulls out half the “tip” and puts it on the counter.
Dean laughs, “Only if you want to—obviously.”
It’s Cas laughing and joining the hug.
Castiel sighs and presses his face into Dean’s chest.
happy because he wants to do something nice for
“Dean needs us,” Charlie says. “He’s with Bobby and Ellen right now and I’m trying to get an earlier flight to Williamsburg literally as we speak, but I’m having trouble because I’m in Colorado right now and there’s a freaking snowstorm so I’m not sure I’ll be able to leave for a while. He needs us. You, especially.”
“Yeah. We had the best time!” Meg shouts.
Castiel rolls his eyes but can’t help from chuckling at his boyfriend’s antics.
Dean opens the door.
“Guys, I,” Dean’s voice cuts off.
and there are people who actually stand up in front of everyone to say stuff. Dean has no idea how they actually have nice stories to tell about his dad. Dean’s starting to think that his dad must’ve gotten a complete personality change in the past three years until he sees
Cas gently bumps Dean’s shoulder with his own. “We have a tradition to keep alive.”
“I—I did make you something though. I um…I wrote you something. It’s uh—a Christmas gift but also—just in case you believed me it’s a…a,” Cas won’t look at Dean.
“All right.” Cas nods. “I’m good. Are you good?”
Cas nods.
Dean’s not naïve. Even in this state of fatigue, he’s still aware that everything is shit, but at least Cas is holding him. At least Dean feels warm. At least he feels loved.
join that class. We should also take him bowling or something as a group.”
“That sounds,” Hot tears start to spill down Dean’s cheeks. He pretends to yawn for an excuse to cover his face. “That sounds fun. I need to check these out and clean up my mess first though.”
“Good choice.” Dean grins. “Have fun reading.”
cute and hilarious English major you’ve had three classes with—and he was just
“Huh.” Dean shrugs. “It just is, I guess. I don’t really know.”
“If I was being patronizing, I wasn’t doing it on purpose. So, sorry for that.”
“Ah,” Dean finally says. “That’s probably a little awkward for you having to leave all the time.”
“Here, I’m not cold. Wanna use my jacket?” Castiel says.
Dean looks down at the puke and tries to figure out how to clean it.
Cas looks at his hand and then at Dean. A slow smile spreads over his face. He does a little wave and then turns around and walks to his dorm. Dean waits until Cas gets inside before he walks to his dorm.
“I love you too, Cas.”
comes back. Just like he promised in that weird dream.
“What’s that?” Meg asks.
“Cas? Are you okay?” Dean asks even though he knows the answer.
“Here, let me.” Dean pushes Benny’s hands away and fixes Benny’s tie.
Does Dean wish it was a date?
Dean’s eyes fill with tears and he hugs Castiel. Tightly. “I know. And I’m yours.” Dean’s voice shakes.
“Please, I—I insist.” Dean says. Heat rushes to his face. Why is he being so weird?
Cas rolls his eyes. “Fucking Williamsburg,”
Dean feels a gentle hand on his wrist, and he looks to see Cas staring up at him.
It’s January 22
their talks.
“Of course.” Cas replies.
Bobby laughs.
“It’s a promise I could keep in my sleep. Loving you? That’s easy. It was the talking about it part that was hard. I’m sure I’ll have a crisis about it at some point and you’ll have to pick me up off the floor that day, but right now? It’s all about you, Cas. And I feel good. This feels good. Holding you like this? Best feeling hands down. Even better than sex.”
Dean: You knew about this? WTF???
They meet on the Terrace outside of the Sadler Center. The location was Meg’s idea because she had been in the library at the time that she received Castiel’s text and the Terrace is a five minute walk from the library and a five minute walk from Castiel’s dorm.
“Guys? Did you figure it out yet?” Gabriel calls through the door. “I’ve been standing out here for a while.”
Well…with some exceptions. Charlie. Bobby. Ellen. Benny.
Castiel cannot wait to introduce Dean to Jack.
“Hey Cas,” Dean says.
Meg-Love ya, you dork.
Dean prepares himself for the moment when Cas pulls away. When he releases his hold on Dean’s hand and walks out the door and out of Dean’s life without a word.
“Okay, Dean. Is it time to put on our sweaters?” Cas asks.
with Cas.
“Do you want to take a break? We could go for a walk or watch a movie.”
,” Cas says before walking through the entryway and pulling Dean into a tight hug.
Father’s grip tightens. Castiel’s pretty sure this will bruise. “We are having a family dinner.” Father says. “You are being incredibly rude. You should be ashamed of yourself.”
There’s no way Dean is this lucky.
to say, but nothing comes to mind. He turns off his music to try to signal to Dean that he is open to conversing with him.
Fuck.
“Yes,” Cas says in a soft voice. He looks the kitten in the eyes and says, “Hi there.”
Jack tries the coffee as they start to leave and says, “Oh wow, Dean! We should go back and get you one too. This is so good!”
Cas gives Dean’s hand a little squeeze and Cas rests his head on Dean’s shoulder. “I love you too.”
Castiel can’t help but chuckle at Meg’s words. He wishes his friend were here now so he could smirk at her. Meg
Cas moans and opens his eyes.
Cas adds.
“Yeah.” Dean’s voice falters.
“You watch over me. I do the same for you.”
“Okay, hospital. We’re going to the hospital.” Dean’s heart pounds as he gets under Cas and puts one of Cas’s arms around his shoulder. Dean holds onto Cas’s waist and pulls him to his feet.
“I see you two had a wild night.” Crowley says.
“Was it a big spider?” Meg asks.
Yes, the chapter title sounds a bit like a song from Panic! At the Disco. I stand by it. :D
“Whatever do you mean?” Mom asks with a sweet smile plastered on her face. This is where Sammy gets it. They’re both devious little shits. He loves them for it, but do they
They spend most of the day in the dorm eating garbage and watching movies. All their friends have work or assignments due today. Dean doesn’t have anything until his work-shift which is going to be shorter than usual because the library’s closing early for LDOC. He’s excited. They’re all going to meet up at the dorm to hang out.
Dean looks away from Castiel, blinking. Then he smiles and says, “I guess I’ll have to be enough then.”
Castiel really is an enigma inside a mystery inside a box that has no key sometimes. At least that’s how it feels to interact with him. Or maybe Dean’s just getting philosophical in his confusion. Who knows? Dean sure as hell doesn’t.
“I love you too, you dork.” Meg wraps her arm around Castiel’s shoulders. “Come on, I’ll buy you some coffee and you can tell me all the details of your confession.”
“Crowley, you little shit.” Dean laughs.
“The first son of America and the prince of England have an enemies-to-friends-to-lovers situation. There are a lot of discussions of the systematic flaws in the systems of government in the US and in England—especially in terms of the way people of different races and queer identities are treated. There’s serious content, but it’s also really funny.” Dean chuckles.
Dean’s chest fills with love and light. He pulls Cas close and kisses him back.
Castiel collects his drink and Dean overhears him thank the barista.
wants that it turns out he
“Please tell Ellen. And Charlie. I care for them both and I don’t want them to be mad at me.”
“Don’t worry about it. Stay safe, little bro. Love ya.”
“It’s a modern music reference. You won’t understand.” Cas looks away.
Castiel’s heart swells in his chest.
It’s too much like that dream he had where an older version of Cas says that Dean just
“Some combination of my peppermint mocha and your kindness. I never would’ve gotten the courage to talk to you had that not happened.” Castiel admits.
Cas replies after four minutes.
“What’s wrong with Sam? Is he okay?”
Cas looks at it and says, “Thank you. Thank you, Crowley. I appreciate your help.”
time.
No. Dean’s okay. He’s okay. He
“Yes. You really like your smart phone. We do a lot of texting back and forth. I like emojis.”
“Yeah,” Cas sniffles. “Sorry, I just keep thinking about everything and it’s leaving me…raw. I suppose.”
A wide grin spreads across Cas’s face. “You once made me a mixtape. It was your top thirteen Led Zeppelin songs only you called them tracks and you spelt tracks with two X’s at the end which I found strange. The band is kind of your family’s band. Your parents loved Led Zeppelin and they bonded over it. They passed that love for the band down to you. And you made me a mixtape with the songs you thought I should know about.”
Cas laughs and he kisses Dean.
“I don’t know why I’m so hungry.” Cas says. “I’ll help you earn the money back. I’ll earn my keep if you allow me to stay with you.”
fathers did to them when they were young and how this has probably gone on and on in both their families for generations. But now Castiel and Dean are both trying to put an end to that. Their families’ history does not know them yet; they are something new. Castiel cannot help but also think about how he is driving Dean to the funeral of Dean’s abuser. And how Castiel has been ignoring the phone-calls of his own abuser.
“You should tell him that. Not right now. Today’s my day. After he graduates and becomes the ridiculously nerdy professor that we all knew he would be the day we met him.”
“Cas, let’s let off the gas a little. The speed limit’s 45 miles per hour here.” Dean says.
Dean wakes up to an empty space beside him in bed. He turns his light on and finds a big basket on his desk. The basket is full of colorful bath bombs, soaps, lotions, a fluffy blue towel, and a sponge. There’s a note at the bottom of the basket. It’s from Cas.
“Like when Jack’s trying to open the thing he wanted the most on Christmas morning.”
He almost throws the paper in the trash, but there’s just…something about it. He puts it back in his pocket.
“I need to run an errand. Jack is going with me, but Sam and Eileen are watching a movie, so you should watch it with them.” Dean tells Cas.
I can’t sleep. I wish I could tell you everything. I miss our talks.
“Oh, wow. Thanks Cas.” Dean grins as he looks through the basket.
Dean hears Cas sniffle, and he realizes with a jolt that Cas is crying. This was not the plan.
“And I vow, in front of all of these people we love so much, to take each day to appreciate you and cherish our time together. I vow to make you coffee every morning because I am still a shitty cook and you are the only reason that we don’t eat take-out every night. I thank you for that, by the way.” Castiel winks at Dean who blushes. “I vow to treat you with respect and maintain your boundaries. I vow to laugh with you and cry with you. I vow to be someone you can trust with your secrets and your joy and your pain. There are no ugly sides of you, Dean Winchester; after all these years, you’re still beautiful,” Castiel smiles, “Still Dean Winchester. You’re always beautiful—especially on the inside. You just want to make the world better than you found it and that is the noblest of causes. I feel lucky to have found someone as steadfast and noble as you, Dean. And I vow to support you and love you even on the days when you don’t see yourself as I see you. When you can’t see how loving and kind you are. I’ve got you for those days. I vow to hold you close every night and wake up next to you every morning until the day I die. I love you. And I’m really, really excited to get to marry you right now.”
It’s 7:42PM on June 23
Dean looks at Cas, wondering why they’re not going anywhere yet.
Castiel copies Dean’s inhale.
“Why?”
Father hits him. Hard. With enough force to knock Castiel off his chair.
“That’ll be nice.” Cas says.
(2013)
“Hey, Dean?” Cas’s voice is soft.
Dean can’t help but feel bad for the Cas of 2014 who can’t use his wings anymore—who doesn’t even
“Dean,” Castiel says.
Cas doesn’t say anything. He looks at Dean like his heart is broken and he says, “I’m so sorry, Dean.”
“You are positively chipper this morning.” Castiel grins at Dean. “I don’t think I’ve ever seen you hold such a long conversation before coffee.” He pokes Dean in the side.
After he calls Sammy, he can’t help but stare at Cas. Cas, who is likely to stay with him until the end.
“Because I’m walking home from work. You’re out here running. Why are you running at,” Dean checks his phone, “2:21 in the morning? Why are you doing this to yourself, man?”
Dean-Ask Charlie
Dean’s excited. He knows exactly which present to give Cas and he cannot wait to see Cas’s face. He will either love it or hate it.
Right now, is one of the bad days. One of the worst days.
“About what?” Cas asks.
“Why the hell not?”
Dean reaches across the table and takes Castiel’s hand in his. “Cas, you’re not gonna ruin my good time by confiding in me should you choose to do so.”
“No. They won’t let me leave until they know I won’t screw up my pills or break something. I don’t understand what they want. Can you listen to the instructions so I can leave? I’m sorry for being inconvenient.”
Dean smiles. “Me too, Cas.”
Castiel is perplexed by the messages. Not their literal meaning, but their deeper meaning. Is there one? Castiel’s not sure.
Dean hugs Cas. He doesn’t think about it, he just sits on the bed, grabs his friend, and hugs him tightly.
Midway through the movie about that grinch character, Dean rests his head on Castiel’s shoulder. Castiel smiles and offers Dean his hand. Dean takes it and gives it a little squeeze. Castiel can’t help but smile wider even though they’re watching a sad part where a little girl sings about feeling confused about Christmas.
“Thanks, Dean.” Sammy smiles.
Dean laughs. He doesn’t mean to, but he just loves this little shit beside him with his whole heart and he cannot keep his feelings contained right now.
“Can you hold me, Cas?” Dean whispers, too exhausted to give a damn about whether or not he sounds pathetic for asking.
He’s not supposed to be taken care of. He’s not allowed to be taken care of. He doesn’t deserve it. He doesn’t deserve it. He doesn’t deserve—
It’s the middle of the night and Castiel is listening to Dean’s Top 13 Led Zeppelin Traxx tape that Dean gave him a few years ago and the song, “Communication Breakdown” is playing. That describes the state of Castiel’s relationship with Dean at the moment. Now that Castiel is safe again, there is no need to grip each other tight and cry. Everything’s okay. Everything is still.
Someone laughs behind him.
Castiel blinks because Crowley’s more likely to smirk than smile.
Dean looks up to see Cas handing him a Led Zeppelin bookmark.
“Pictures.” Cas smiles.
“I’m hungry; do you want to get dinner together?” Cas asks. “It’s still early, but I’m sure we can find something to bring back here.”
I get why you hate me. It just sucks.
There’s a glimmer of…well…
“What? Why?” Dean asks.
It’s “Come and Get Your Love” by Redbone.
doesn’t know what to say. Why
that voice.
Dean and Cas rush down the stairs, trying to outrun the bouncers. Dean’s laughing. Cas really didn’t mean any harm. He just felt bad for the girl and wanted to give her comfort. It was unwelcome and wildly inappropriate, but Dean knows that Cas meant well and somehow this is the most hilarious thing that has happened around Dean in years.
“You were right.” Dean replies.
Cas couldn’t know. He wouldn’t have said it if it wasn’t something he really meant. Right?
Dean starts to walk away, but Castiel grabs Dean’s arm and pulls him back onto the bed. Dean lands on Castiel with his head on his chest. Castiel hugs Dean. “You are adorable. I love you.” Castiel says.
Dean grabs Cas before he gets very far.
Dean looks at Cas who’s staring at Dean with a straight face.
“Fuck,” Cas mumbles. “Ow,”
(2010)
Then Gabriel waltzes in holding a cat-carrier.
Dean pauses as he walks. It’s such a beautiful night. The air is crisp, and it smells pleasant. Dean can’t even figure out what the smell is. It just smells
Dean looks at Cas and asks, “What sounds good to you?”
that his dad decided to waste his time and tell him that he is—what did he say again—oh yes: a pathetic coward who deserves nothing. That is really fucking funny.
“Sorry about before. I was scared.” Cas says. “I was…overcomplicating things and the fact that I’m going to my family’s home hours from now was not helping matters.”
Cas is here. Cas is
Castiel prepares for bed after the long, exciting day when his phone buzzes.
“This,” Dean can’t stop smiling. He carefully sits the cat carrier on the ground. “Is your new kitten.” Dean pulls the kitten out of the carrier and hands her to Cas.
“I know. I’m sorry.” Dean says. “I just. I don’t know what to say. I don’t want to say something stupid and then you leave again.”
On February 28, Dean wakes up to a text from Cas.
As Dean drifts off to sleep, a part of the song, “Not Yet/Love Run (Reprise) by The Amazing Devil pops into his head.
and he does
Dean-What kind of game?
“We had a bet. Charlie now owes me twenty bucks.”
Dean wipes his hair off and rubs his hand on Castiel’s face. Castiel rolls and knocks Dean to the ground. Dean laughs and rolls so he’s on top of Castiel. They roll around on the floor until they’re both laughing so hard that they have to stop. They end up lying shoulder-to-shoulder on the ground.
Dean hugs her back and spins her around, laughing.
“It might have also made for a shorter movie.” Jack comments. He’s watching the screen with his hands over his eyes, peeking out from between his fingers. For some reason Jack can watch the horrors of real life without blinking but watching someone step on a nail is too scary. That’s a little strange, but it’s okay. Fear doesn’t always make sense.
Cas smiles. “Thank you, Dean. You can tell me when you’re upset too.”
in Cas’s eyes and Dean does
The sight warms Castiel’s heart and he finds himself reaching for Dean’s hand. Dean winks at Castiel and laces their fingers.
Dean puts his hands on Cas’s shoulders. “Cas? Look at me.”
doing that to the real Cas. Right now.
about the message. He might have gone to sleep already.
The Sunken Garden is a weird patch of grass that’s literally sunken under the rest of the space. There are several brick pathways leading to stairs on all sides. There are no flowers in the Sunken Garden and people usually do homework in the shade from trees outside of the Sunken Garden. Dean walks around here all the time and sees parents playing with their kids and people having picnics or throwing a frisbee with their dog. One time, Dean saw someone walking six corgis.
Dean blinks. “Yeah, sorry. Okay, feet in.” Dean waits for Cas to get out of the way before he closes the door. Then he takes a minute to die of embarrassment because he just told a grown man to make sure he had his feet in the car before he closes the door. That’s something he did with Sammy when Sammy was five. And he just did that with someone who looks at least twenty years older than him.
“Stranger things have happened.” Dean shrugs.
. All their friends help them move in: Charlie, Crowley, Benny, Meg, Garth, and Gabriel and Jo also swing by to help. It’s a busy hour as they transfer all the stuff they already had from the two dorms and unpack. Then the real adventure begins. They all pile into cars and go to Walmart to pick up items they had ordered online. They split into teams. Gabriel, Benny, Charlie, and Garth go to put the couch in the bed of Garth’s truck. Crowley and Meg help Cas gather the appliances that Cas bought; Dean’s still not sure what all Cas bought. Before parting ways, Dean pulls Cas aside and kisses him. Cas chuckles and pulls Dean into his arms, dips him, and smiles before kissing him. If Dean forgets how to breathe in those moments, that’s Dean’s business.
“Yeah, you got it.” Dean grins.
He knows his answer.
you to feel sorry for me, Dean.”
Castiel smiles at Bobby and Ellen and Jo. They’re Dean’s adopted family. Of course, they’re here today to celebrate this accomplishment with him. Of course, Bobby has been grinning with tears streaming down his face for the past ten minutes and Ellen has been covering her mouth so people don’t hear her cry. Of course, Jo is smiling and handing tissues to her parents and dabbing at her own eyes with a tissue on occasion. Dean is their boy.
“I need to come up with something for you. Teammate doesn’t quite have the right ring to it. And it suggests there’s an enemy. Who are we competing against?”
“Secret shopping sounds exciting.” Jack grins.
“Why did you,” Dean trails off, unable to finish his question. If he finishes his question, then he will get an answer and Dean is not ready for that.
“So, I know this is real.”
“So, you’re going to be twenty-one in September?”
“Ah, Squirrel. Come in.” Crowley opens the door wider so Dean can walk into the room.
bleeding. Not a lot but just enough to confirm Dean’s theory that a trip to the hospital is necessary.
I'll try to update Saturday. Thanks for reading!!:D
Dean: blue
Dean looks away. “I was kinda hoping you were exaggerating.”
Dean sighs and rubs his face. He looks at his phone. It’s already 7pm.
“Don’t mention it.” Dean waves him off.
Cas insisted on taking a turn driving after Dean stayed up all night. Dean just needed to
“I realized today that we didn’t have any mugs here that were specifically for you. I figured it was time to change that because this is your home too.”
“Yeah but, I mean, won’t all the stuff happen once I meet you in 2008? I mean, at least I’ll believe then and you’ll get sent back home that day instead of waiting until 2021.”
Dean’s eyes burn with tears. “Nobody,” Dean’s voice cuts off. “Nobody treats me like this.”
“How long ago was that for your time?” Dean asks.
Castiel heads straight for the entrance and Dean asks, “Didn’t you want to look around?”
“What happened anyway?” Dean asks.
“Let go.” Cas snaps.
. For some reason, Castiel fits here with Dean and Jack and Sam and Eileen. With members of his chosen family. In his favorite place.
They are getting older though. Dean started wearing reading glasses two years ago…they’re really cute square ones. Dean doesn’t like them though. Castiel tries to be normal about how cute he thinks Dean looks in them but well…Castiel can’t recall a single moment when he has ever been normal about how cute he thinks Dean is. He remembers telling Meg all about the cute guy in his English class with Professor Asshole AKA Chuck Shurley (who is now one of his coworkers and still a huge asshole). He told Meg all about Dean’s excellent analysis on the stories they read and how he always turned his papers in on time and was so punctual and cute and funny. Meg’s a really good friend for not strangling Castiel for fanboying over Dean every Tuesday and Thursday especially since things did not get better in the Castiel-fanboying-over-Dean-department after Dean and Castiel started dating.
I adopt children—one day in the far away future, I—I would treat them with
“Okay, so, how do you like to sleep?” Dean asks.
Dean feels his face heat up and he takes a bite of a donut. It seems Dean’s birthday had been memorable for Cas too.
“I told you that he liked you like, two weeks ago. You didn’t listen to me.” Meg shrugs.
“I am uninjured.”
“I don’t mind.” Cas shrugs. “Perhaps Heaven will change one day.”
“Can I show you a song?” Castiel asks.
“That doesn’t mean anything.”
“Thank you, Dean.” Cas’s voice is rough. “I don’t believe I’ve…um, experienced this with the garrison. Not to this extent at least. This um, affection I have for Bobby and Sam and you…especially you, Dean. I’m glad that you—you all care about me as well.” Cas sniffles and it goes straight to Dean’s heart.
Dean smiles. “I love you too, Cas.”
, but they are
He tries “Peach” by The Front Bottoms. After listening to the first few seconds, Castiel is reminded that this song does not fit the upbeat theme of the class either. Even though he does like quite a few of the lines.
“Yeah, I just saw Dean make it down the aisle. Somehow he managed not to trip.” Meg replies.
Dean considers crawling in a hole of embarrassment, but instead looks at Cas.
Dean takes the trench-coat from Cas and starts scrubbing.
“Ooh, we have to dance to this!” Dean jumps up and starts dancing.
Dean chuckles. He tries to copy Castiel’s movements. They’re pretty easy which makes sense given that this is a warm-up.
And again.
They get married in front of the windmill.
“What?”
see you again.”
saying it.
“Yeah?” Dean can’t help but smile a little. “What are they?”

“Hey, Professor Asshat is your advisor.”
more efficient, but Castiel doesn’t want Dean to spend all his time panic-cleaning. It’s not healthy.
“Are you sure?” Cas asks.
“How’s your pain?” Dean asks.
“When?” Cas whispers. He’s staring at him with vulnerability and fear and heartbreak written all over his face.
After Castiel and Dean say their goodbyes to Bobby and Ellen, they go to Food Lion to get supplies. While at Food Lion, Castiel excuses himself to go to the bathroom.
He’s also supposed to sleep. He hates sleep. All his dreams are nightmares. Naomi reprogramming him. Metatron telling him that Dean is dead. Being killed by Lucifer. The year of the Leviathans. The months spent in Purgatory and hearing Dean’s prayers and not reaching out to him even though he could feel his fear and worry and
“That would be really nice. Thanks, Dean.”
Gabriel was always the bumper.
,” Dean signs as he pants from running. “
“Whatever we want; I guess.” Dean replies. He can’t believe he can really do whatever he wants. He’s free.
, Dean.” Cas’s voice breaks when he says Dean’s name.
“You said it, pal.” Dean puts a hand on Castiel’s shoulder—the wrong shoulder. “I’m beat.”
Maybe we can’t change the world but
Castiel looks out the window and tries to ignore the way his eyes well up with tears. He misses Dean. He misses driving around on lazy afternoons when they didn’t have anything better to do. He misses staying out late to watch the stars. He misses sneaking into sold-out concerts with Dean. The Taylor Swift concert was particularly memorable, but Dean swore him to secrecy about that one. He misses the time when Dean surprised him with a road-trip to see a honey-bee festival because Dean remembered Castiel’s long-held fascination with bees.
He’s safe now.
Instead of doing either of those things, Dean of 2001 shoves his plate with his last PopTart on it and says, “Take mine. You like ‘em more than I do.”
Dean’s face feels hot, and he has to blink back tears because when Cas says “eternally” he means it. If he lives long enough, he’s promising to remember Dean and Sammy and Bobby
Dean smiles. “Huh, maybe you
since you got your wings back.”
Castiel can see Dean’s face now and he watches the man he loves sleep. He is not sure if Dean still believes this is a strange thing to do, but Castiel allows himself this selfish action of gazing at the face of his beloved. Despite the hold Dean has on Castiel’s shirt, Dean looks peaceful. It is a nice change from the way he looks during the day as he flips between restlessness and anxiety and joy and despondency and exhaustion. Yet throughout all that, he is still beautiful, still Dean Winchester.
Trigger warnings: mentions of getting disowned, homophobia and foul language
Dean’s thoughts are interrupted by a “pop.” Pop. Pop, pop, pop. Pop.
Dean’s face heats up. “Yeah,”
“He’s going to love that.”
Cas nods.
“Hey, Dean. Hi Cas.” Sammy says.
“Okay,”
Castiel goes through a mental list of things that make a human okay: shelter—sleeping in the library is not an option because it’s about to close, so someone needs to make sure Dean finds his way to a safe place tonight, food—most people Castiel knows like pizza, so Castiel gets them pizza for dinner, and entertainment—Castiel decides to put on a movie for them to watch.
, and Crowley wants to watch
“Maybe,” Dean whispers and puts his hand on Cas’s face. “Maybe we should…maybe we should retire.”
“I’m Jack.” Jack continues to work on his sandcastle.
so much as the idea of having a loving father. Now that Castiel’s not communicating with his father, that will never happen. He will never win his approval. Not that Castiel ever truly believed he would earn it. He just…he
“Why does that matter, Dean? It’s a job.”
Dean nods. They go get Burger King and bring it back to the hotel. They change into their pjs and eat on the bed while they watch a movie Cas found on the pay-per-view channel. Dean doesn’t pay attention to the plot. He can’t. He’s just so tired and empty and cold and he keeps thinking about the space between himself and Cas and finds himself staring often. He wants to hold Cas or be held or to at least just touch him.
The clock strikes midnight and Dean takes a shuddering breath beside Castiel. “I guess we should go to bed.” Dean whispers. “Big day tomorrow.”
Castiel wants to tell everyone that he loves him right now, but he doesn’t want to disturb their movie. It’s okay. Castiel thinks about sharing jokes and gossiping about the Winchesters with Eileen, going on walks with Jack, having conversations with Sam, and sharing soft, careful touches with Dean. They all know that he loves them. Just like he knows they love him.
Cas came back.
, but it’s still strange to see Dean’s beloved Impala without any noticeable differences nearly twenty years into the past.
Dean looks at Cas who nods.
“Castiel,” Naomi says.
“Dean, I already told you that I didn’t.”
Dean smiles and kisses the top of Cas’s head.
That sounds pretty friggin’ good after everything they’ve been through.
“Why?” Castiel asks.
Castiel knows it’s only a week, but it feels like an eternity.
Dean cuts the song off early by singing one last, “I’m yours” and it’s a little exaggerated and long, but sue him. It’s his wedding day.
does Dean have to be like this?
Dean looks at Cas again and his heart aches. Spring Break hasn’t even started, and Dean already misses him. He hates this. He’s not even going to be able to text Cas because of his father monitoring Cas’s every move. Dean really hates Cas’s father. He knows that telling Cas that would only make Cas feel bad, so he doesn’t dare vocalize that opinion, but Dean really,
met Benny after all. And he knows from Lisa that relationships involve a lot of give and take and all that shit until someone gives up. Dean’s usually the one who gives up. Does he really want to try anything like this again? If that’s even what this is?
Castiel didn’t realize Dean had noticed him and replies, “It is a nice song.”
“I’ll have to take your word for it.” Castiel cannot help but wince in sympathy for Charlie’s poor nose.
“Did I thank you yet?” Castiel asks. “For Pumpkin?”
“I feel like I should do more.” Dean says.
Trigger warnings: foul language and references to child abuse
“You’re right. This
Cas chuckles. “Okay, Dean. Let’s find you some pie.”
“Hey, talk to me, Cas.” Dean’s voice is soft.
Dean puts his hand on Cas’s chest, right over his heart, and says, “This is yours. He can’t have it. Even if he tries to rip it apart, it’s
“You had a tape of favorite Queen songs, so I was listening to that. I really like that band. I have been partial to “Don’t Stop Me Now,” Jack likes “Bicycle Race,” and you and Sam sometimes sing “Bohemian Rhapsody” together, so I have good memories associated with this band. Oh, and in the future, there’s a movie that addresses Freddie Mercury’s bisexuality. You, Sam, Jack, and me saw it in the movie theaters.” Cas replies.
Castiel finishes preparing the note he wrote for Dean and hides it in the drawer of the desk that Dean gave him. Castiel looks around his room. This is a nice space. There is a bookshelf where Castiel has put the few fictional texts he has for pleasure-reading. They cover half of the second shelf. The top shelf is for pictures. He has several framed of Dean, Jack, Sam, and himself. He loves that bookshelf. His bed has a dark blue bedding on it, but lately Castiel spends his nights in Dean’s room, so the bed is untouched.
Cas walks in.
So, he doesn’t sleep.
There’s a little smile on Dean’s face and it makes Castiel feel warm seeing Bobby care for Dean. At least Dean has one reliable father-figure.
“I’m very happy, Dean.” Cas replies.
Castiel smiles broadly at Dean and Dean’s heart does a series of elaborate flips in his chest.
“What’s your favorite part of the meal?” Castiel asks.
Dean grins at Castiel and Castiel isn’t quite sure why. There’s a glint of something in Dean’s eyes. It’s strange not being able to feel the emotions radiating off this version of Dean. Castiel’s so used to the phenomenon around the Dean of 2021…he misses seeing his Dean’s beautiful soul. Castiel thinks about the Dean of 2021 grinning at him.
DEAN: Fine. No. But it was clear earlier.
Castiel remembers offering to watch over Dean while he sleeps.
Sam signs.
Dean’s heart drops. Something happened. He just doesn’t know
Dean smiles. “Yeah, me too.” Then he goes cold and adds, “I earn my grades though. Bobby doesn’t play favorites—neither does Ellen.”
Castiel nods. He feels numb.
Dean freezes. Even if he doesn’t believe Cas, that doesn’t mean he should just leave the guy in the bathroom to cry. Dean hates crying. Especially when he’s crying because he can never go home. Dean
He’s on pitch. Dean might talk with him later about joining the school chorus. He would be good.
“So, anyone gonna explain what happened?” Sam asks aloud while signing.
And Cas has had plenty of chances to get the jump on Dean to rob or kill him. So that’s obviously not the goal. So, if it’s not to rob or kill Dean, not to get to his family, then what is this Cas guy’s deal? Unless…he’s telling the truth?
Castiel chuckles and takes another cookie from the plate. They played for the cookies and Castiel won all of them. “Would you like a cookie?” Castiel gestures to the plate.
Thinking about his father is so exhausting. Castiel cannot wait for the day when he’s an English professor who specializes in queer literature and he can finally come out to his father and suffer the consequences.
Cas nods.
Castiel smiles. “Yes, this has been a rather happy Christmas.”
breathe
Dean smiles at Cas, because yes he is. And he is so utterly grateful for him.
He must’ve gotten someone’s number.
“Dean, you don’t know what it’s like to not be able to protect the man you love!” Castiel snaps.
Jo smiles. “You’re welcome, kiddo.”
Like, we at least have to include Part 2.” Charlie says.
Castiel laughs. “I guess I better be nice to you then.”
He feels like his brain has shorted.
The next chapter should be up by Friday. Thanks for reading!!:D
“But…what about your dad? What did you tell him?”
“Because it is. I love you.” Cas says.
Dean uses the bathroom in their room. When he returns, he takes Castiel’s hand and grins, “Let’s go!”
“I love you. I would travel to the ends of the earth for you.” Castiel whispers. “And you’re worth any trouble I come across along the way.”
“There was no time. The Empty was already there.”
“Do you have any recommendations?”
Jack signs. He grabs two gifts and hands one to Dean and one to Cas.
“You started hating those things even more?”
Dean’s heart jumps in his chest and he is at Cas’s side in seconds, putting his body between Cas and the on-fire-microwave.
“Mom,”
“I like this invention,” Cas says into Dean’s shoulder.
this. That…that sounds familiar. It’s bullshit, but…Dean feels like he has heard it before.
“What’s that?”
Dean lets go of Castiel’s wrist. Castiel lets go of Dean’s hand.
Cas must not have seen Dean’s text yet. That explains why Cas didn’t reply. Dean had assumed Cas was asleep. Sometimes he gets back to the dorm and finds Cas tucked into bed already. Dean’s always careful to not make any noise, but he always wakes Cas up when he crawls into bed. Dean doesn’t like that he’s disturbing Cas’s sleep, but he does live for that sleepy greeting he gets from Cas and the feeling of Cas burying his face in Dean’s chest on those nights. Sometimes he’ll just lie there, holding Cas close, thinking about how lucky he is to have him in his life. He always falls asleep feeling warm and loved on those nights.
Sam signs.
“Hello, Dean.” Castiel says as he watches Dean approach. “What brings you here?”
Castiel’s cheeks turn red and he looks down. “I got an A- in his class.”
They spend the day watching Christmas movies with Jack.
say so.” Dean grins.
“Nothing’s wrong.” Jack sniffles. “I’m just so glad that you don’t have that awful deal with The Empty anymore and you’re able to actually be happy. You deserve to be happy.”
“Better?” Dean asks.
It’s Bobby saying, “Cas, get your ass over here.”
“But the popcorn setting is evil.” Dean says.
“Of course,” Castiel says immediately.
He just wanted more time.
“Wait.” Dean frowns. “Are you saying you possessed some poor bastard?”
And if Dean falls asleep happy that he got that hug he wanted, well, that’s
“So…teaching me to drive will help me become more useful to you? For the future?” Cas asks.
Dean winks.
And Castiel feels a wave of hot anger wash over him and he pulls his phone out of his jacket pocket. He looks his father in the eyes, and without checking to see who’s calling first, Castiel answers his phone. At the dinner-table. “Hello?” Castiel asks.
“I take it you don’t want to talk about it?” Dean asks.
save the whole fricking world. Over and over and over. But not with Cas. With Cas it’s,
“What’s this one? Who’s it by?” Dean asks.
Sam found out about the time I was in a boys’ home after I stole food.
“Yes, I suppose so.” Cas replies.
Castiel knows that his friends wouldn’t call if it weren’t important and he’s trying not to imagine anyone being hurt, but of course he sees them that way. He blinks, trying not to think about that. He can’t think about that right now or he will
it’s Castiel. He’s wearing a yellow tank-top, black shorts, a white hoody tied around his waist, running shoes, and socks with a cartoon bee pattern that stretch up to just below his knees. He’s also wearing a microphone headset.
that Dean promises they will watch after the competition is finished. Dean creates a strange green creature and several colorfully clothed characters from something called
Everything is fine…for the moment at least. An hour ago, Castiel was crying in the garden wishing it wasn’t too cold for the bees to be out. But right now, everyone is eating dinner together. Well, everyone except Gabriel. Castiel misses Gabriel. He was the only one Castiel was looking forward to seeing and now he’s not sure when he’ll get to see Gabriel. He still hasn’t replied to Gabriel’s text. He has been meaning to, but he just hasn’t been in the mood to talk to anyone.
“I got lucky and found a flight,” Cas replies.
the chores. I’m actually quite fond of doing laundry and vacuuming—just to name a few things.”
Dean’s face pales. “Goodnight, Cas.” He walks over and turns the light off.
Dean blinks. “What’s that?”
trash. He is kind and funny and sweet and generally fun to be around and…and he’s good…so good. He just wants to make the world a better place. And he loves Castiel. And Castiel is in love with him.
You wish you were driving
It’s Cas.
Still.
“You don’t need to be sorry. It’s okay, Dean.”
“You’re the older sister I always wished I could’ve had.”
sweater. Castiel got Jack an adult coloring book and a pen-set with two hundred colors. Dean got Jack a box with thirteen drawers. Inside each drawer is a series of boxes.
It was two nights before Christmas
“Yeah?” Dean whispers back. Not entirely sure why they’re whispering.
September 8, 2034
“Yes.” Castiel replies. “We should.” Castiel pulls away from Dean and offers his hand.
Cas doesn’t say anything the whole way to Camm.
“Let’s go home.” Cas says, taking Dean’s hand in his.
Cas kisses him back but then he pulls away. “What was that for?” Cas whispers.
Cas is staring at the road like it just kicked him in the face and he’s completely still. There’s no swerving or changing lanes. Technically he’s perfect.
Dean chuckles. “You’re never gonna find out.”
“I was thinking of a different song. But it probably means the same thing.”
Cas kisses Dean. Dean reaches out and puts his hands in Cas’s hair as he kisses him back. He’s not sure what his fascination with Cas’s hair is. This time Cas’s hair is wet with sweat which is honestly a little gross, but the kiss is worth it.
Everyone ends up taking naps after they eat. Jack falls asleep on the couch. Sam and Eileen go to their room. Castiel and Dean go to Dean’s room.
Dean nods.
of creamer in his.
Dean waits in the room, wondering where Cas is. He had assumed that Cas had woken up before Dean and was taking a shower, but now he’s not sure. There’s no note, but Cas and his phone are gone. Dean waits for half an hour before deciding to investigate. Dean sends Cas a text and isn’t given a reply for twenty minutes, so he decides to see if Cas is at his dorm. He walks to Cas’s dorm, swipes in with his student ID, walks up the three flights of stairs, and knocks on the door. He is greeted by Crowley who wears a somber expression.
Castiel nearly forgets his medication on the floor of the Impala. Castiel bends over to get it but Dean grabs his arm. “Wait, the doctor said you should try not to bend like that because of your head. I’ll get it. Okay?” Dean says.
“People will. I’m not the only one who will have faith in you.” Cas is looking at him with those earnest blue eyes again. He’s so friggin’ sincere.
Castiel tilts his head to the side, trying to figure out what Dean could possibly be talking about.
Castiel looks at Dean. Dean’s eyes are wide and full of concern. It’s the face Dean of 2021 makes when he’s about to say something terrible about himself or take on guilt for something that happened years ago. Or in the case of this Dean of 2001, guilt of something that has not even happened yet.
“I know.” Dean wishes he could hold Cas close right now, but he doesn’t want to freak Cas out. Now really isn’t the time to confess his undying love for his best friend. Not when they’re talking about
“Thanks, I guess.” Dean mumbles, hugging Charlie back.
Dean grins.
“Don’t go to sleep. We don’t know how bad you’re hurt yet.” Dean says.
Dean looks back at Cas and waves at him. He runs into the wall. “Shit,” Dean laughs. “Bye!”
He still won’t look at Dean.
Dean snorts.
They get to the room and Cas unlocks it with the key. It’s a nice room. There’s a big shower, an AC unit, a big window, a mini fridge, a nice tv. The bed is made up with fluffy-looking pillows and a pleasant sea-green bedding. Everything smells nice. Dean has never stayed in a hotel room this nice before.
The next song that plays is “Club Can’t Handle Me” by Flo Rida featuring David Guetta.
A movie. Right. That’s a good idea. It’s better than a hug where Dean starts sobbing. Because he will. If he ever gets that hug. Does he even

Dean pays for the drink and they wait for it together.
Time to lie.
“Yeah,”
why Cas is crying. Dean can never go back to the time when he was four and his mom was alive, and he actually felt safe. And Cas feels like he can’t go home…even if he’s just acting or probably lying about not being able to go home. Dean can’t just leave the guy in there like that. Just in case.
Meg-Told you. :P
“Wow, that was close.” Castiel comments as he turns back around.
“I love you, but I have to go.” Cas tells Dean before kissing him on the cheek.
“Of course,” Cas smiles.
“You’re good at this already.” Dean grins, patting Cas’s arm.
What?
“I know all of “Don’t Stop Me Now” and “You’re My Best Friend” and I know most of “Bicycle” but not all of it.” Cas replies.
Dean-Benny thought it would be before Spring Break
“It’s cute that you still think you’re an asshole. I’ve been Black Friday shopping with you. Meg’s a demon. You’re a fucking angel.” Dean quips as he swipes at his eyes.
“The yellow one we got when we went to the mall a few days ago?” Jack asks.
“Sure, buddy.” Garth replies.
I guess.”
Dean sucks in a breath, “Yeah,”
Dean kisses him back. He can hear Cas taking more pictures. “You’re so cute; you know that?”
Dean speaks in a quieter voice when he says, “Tell me about home.”
Dean smiles and shakes his head. “Friggin’ peppermint.”
“Yeah, but hey, we’ll make new memories.”
“But he’s mostly your kid?”
How good of a show does Dean put on to fool everyone here into believing he is worthy of their time and consideration and their…their
“Are you reading anything?” Dean asks.
They don’t move for a while. Eventually Cas calms down and rests his forehead on Dean’s shoulder.
This theory is confirmed when the funeral director announces that Dean’s dad requested that they read the will in front of everyone at the funeral. There are a lot of small gifts given to people. Then the funeral director says, “And to my eldest son, Dean,”
“Okay, so this one’s just asking each other questions. But only the most random questions you can think of. It can’t be something normal or important.”
“Rockin’ Around the Christmas Tree” by Brenda Lee plays and Dean remembers being small and dancing with his mom to this song. There was a whole dance with special moves and everything. They did it every year.

Dean hangs up.
“Why Dean specifically?”
“I don’t know,” Meg shrugs. “You’ve never wanted to pet a fuzzy tarantula?”
“Good thing.” Dean chuckles.
Nobody says anything for a few beats. Then Cas asks, “Dean?” His voice is soft, steady, so Cas. Not so much soft, but steady. Secure. Safe. All these things Dean has yearned for but never really had with someone else. Even though he tries not to, Dean gets swept away in that voice. It’s always like this with Cas. Cas is the first friend he’s had in a while. He’s the first one he shared a long laugh with in such a long time. He’s the one who sits with him at ass o’clock when Dean can’t sleep and he’s angrily nursing a cup of coffee. Cas is
Castiel feels lightheaded and he puts his hands on his knees. He takes deep breaths and counts to four. He does that seven times.
“Yay,” Cas says in a flat tone.
“Home? You have a home?”
“Okay, no clown movies.” Dean says.
He doesn’t.
Cas nods and closes his eyes. He takes a deep breath. “I will need to cry about this later, so I would like a raincheck on that hug.” Cas says.
Cas turns around and Dean shoves the trench-coat at him. Cas’s eyes widen and he gingerly takes the trench-coat in his hands.
“You’re right. I’m just having a last-minute-panic moment. I’ll be fine once we’re actually around the kids. I mean, I
Cas is very touchy today. Dean really can’t say much though. Ever since he woke up, all he has wanted to do is put his hands on Cas. He’s just so excited for their future. It’s like he can’t believe this is really his life and he needs a near-constant touch to remind himself that this is real.
“I was quite concerned they were going to get us. Thank you for the quick-thinking on your part. Without my angel powers, I’m not sure how good I would be in a fight.” Castiel admits.
Jack bursts into the room at 6AM on the dot. This time, Dean is already awake. He’s just too excited. He’s ready to spend Christmas together as a family. This Christmas season has already been the best, but he’s ready for today to make it officially the best Christmas ever.
“Yes. But first, I need to give you your gift for today.” Dean replies. He gets up and grabs something out of his closet. He returns to Castiel and hands him a book. “It’s about bees.” Dean explains. “I know how much you like them.”
Dean hugs Charlie, “Thanks Charlie. This is nice.”
Sam tells everyone about 2025 when Castiel and Dean went to Europe for a week. They saw all the touristy sights, ate amazing foods, and Dean carried Castiel home after the wine-tasting when Castiel misunderstood the directions (one is not supposed to

Dean tilts his head back and laughs.
Dean kisses Cas. Cas kisses him back.
“Do you want to get under the covers? You might be more comfortable that way.”
“Because it’s funny and there’s no way Castiel will succeed in convincing you that you will be okay. You don’t even truly believe that now. I’m merely confirming your assumption that something terrible will happen.” Naomi shrugs. “At least you’re not waiting for the other shoe to drop.”
