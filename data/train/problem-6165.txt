Bruce, of all people, went second. It was a suspenseful minute watching him pull the hammer hard enough to almost bring the other guy out, but in the end he too had to admit defeat. He looked even sadder than Clint had.
“Why do you wanna take my photo again?” Tony asked, leaning against the wall Steve had put him before.
But he didn’t. He had manners, after all, and yes okay he also wasn’t one to deny himself the company of that man. He entered fully. “Hey.”
Reason number 1291 that Steve Rogers should’ve been able to lift that godforsaken hammer: he was the best kisser Tony had ever had the privilege to, well, kiss.
“I’m not laughing!” But he did allow his grin to grow as he stood, walking over to where Tony was frowning by the counter. “Why do you need that bowl in particular anyway?”
Steve’s hand was in his hair now, and Tony found himself humming contently. “I’m not telling you to bare your whole soul. Just realize that whatever people made you believe in the past doesn’t define you.”
He entered the kitchen fully. “I wouldn’t have it any other way.” Neither of them mentioned the other Avengers living under their roof. This moment was theirs, whatever that meant.
Tony seemed to hesitate, if only for a second. “Well, the second part of the experiment involves me asking people to describe the hug.”
broken,” he mumbled, and Steve seemed to be the only one who had heard him if his frown was any indication.
Had Steve not been so utterly lost in his own confusion he might’ve noticed just how hard Tony was trying to conceal his flustered state with nonchalance. But at the time he’d only been able to focus on the request and the air of ‘
Steve, all pure and mighty, should’ve been able to lift it. If not for his worth, then for his strength. Or so Tony thought.
Steve considered it fortunate that Tony was used to being in front of flashing lights, for each time he brought the camera with him and raised it questioningly Tony didn’t protest, occasionally even taking the time to pose as Steve attempted to find his style within the craft (or so he said).
Steve wasn’t sure when he’d heaved himself up, but he was crossing the room within seconds. “Tony, just- just leave me alone.”
Steve’s hand found Tony’s wrist, one finger touching it, as if he wasn’t aware he was doing it. “You’ve always thought too lowly of yourself, Tony.”
Tony pulled hard for show, just hard enough to almost hurt his back, and promptly found himself on his back on the floor. Hammer still in his hand.
“You’re good at this,” Tony mumbled when they broke apart for air. “You’re so goddamn good at this.”
Tony seemed embarrassed. “I need a certain bowl, but- well, I can’t reach it. It’s too high.” He pointed to the open cupboard, grumbling as he did, and Steve felt himself smile. He couldn’t help it. “Yeah, yeah, stop laughing at me and help, will you?”
“Oh, it’s fine. I’m not reading, as you can probably see.” Steve wasn’t sure why he gestured to the countless of bookcases lining up the space with very exaggerated movements, but he did, and he felt like a fool immediately. Something about Tony made him lose control of his limbs. “What are you doing here?”
Steve couldn’t look at him, but he felt himself relaxing under his touch. “I… I’m glad you’re here.”
Tony shrugged, scooping the last pancake out of the pan and onto a plate. “Wanted to see your reaction.”
Tony crossed the room and didn’t even hesitate before sitting down beside him. Steve had so many things at the tip of his tongue, ready to spill, but he wasn’t able to say a single one of them.
Tony leaned down, and Steve met him halfway, locking lips for a brief moment. “No, trust me. Everything about you terrifies me.”
Steve smiled. He had a feeling Tony wasn’t saying everything he was feeling, but who was he to push? “Thank you. That’s very kind of you.”
Steve withdrew his hand immediately. “Is everything about science to you?” He hadn’t realized how sharp his voice would be, and he almost felt bad for it when Tony recoiled.
Steve might’ve been able to pick up the phrase Tony kept using whenever he needed something from Steve, but he was quite frankly too occupied wishing the hug could get a sequel. Whatever the hell he’d babbled out when he was asked to describe it probably didn’t come close to how warm he’d felt at all.
Tony accepted Nat’s hand, bringing Mjolnir with him when he stood. He held it up, away from his body as if afraid it would explode. “I like the feel of it. It’s sturdy. Steady. Like I was meant to hold it.”
Later, Tony grabbed the camera before Steve had even remembered its existence, aiming it at Steve’s face with such glee that he couldn’t find it in himself to turn away from the lens.
It sat in his closet for a year, gathering dust as it was, until he started packing up his things to move into the Avengers Tower and found it. He blinked, the therapist’s words echoing in his mind as he picked it up, and decided to snap a photo of a pile of his not yet worn out clothes. That was the first of many snapshots.
“Steve, I make you food and make sure you have all you need and use the most stupid excuses to spend time with you. How can you be surprised?”
All valid questions, Steve admitted, but not welcome in the slightest. Especially not when they were asked so passive aggressively by someone who had only just been promoted and was finally able to give them a piece of his mind, and especially not when Steve longed to go home and possibly continue his conversation with Tony.
“Coulda fooled me.” Steve entered his workshop fully, scanning the mess of unfinished projects Tony was trying to make his way through. “I reckon I should’ve known you were here.”
“For science,” Tony repeated, and they shared their first but certainly not last breakfast together.
Tony shook his head. “Always undermining yourself.” His tone was so sad, so utterly low Steve almost wanted to hug him.
Steve silenced him. They could talk afterward, when they were both satisfied. They could talk for the rest of their lives.
“Hey.” Tony found him in the library again, only this time Steve wasn’t even pretending to find the books interesting. “There you are.”
“Smile,” Tony said, and Steve did, not finding it hard even when the flash blinded him. “You spend way too much time behind this thing. It’s a crime, really.”
Turning the camera to him, Steve asked a silent question. Tony raised an eyebrow, visibly exhausted, but seemingly not enough to deny him this. His lips twitched in response, and Steve snapped a picture of the half-smile.
Steve snapped a pic, getting a frown in return. “Just checking the light,” he said before Tony could protest. “Smile for a sec.”
“Right. For science.” Steve reached up, exposing his lower stomach to the air as he grabbed the bowl easily. “God forbid you use the other dozen bowls we own.” We own. Way to turn this domestic, Rogers.
“I honestly barely registered lifting it,” Tony said. “I didn’t feel a thing. Is it supposed to be that light?”
Tony waved a hand at him, the action not matching the appearance at all. “Yeah, yeah, just dandy. So, uh, how many people have you photographed?”
He had no idea why he even tried, really. Why he walked up to it so determined to humiliate himself like the others had. An act of solidarity? A search for the truth? To find proof of what he and the others already knew?
Tony lowered the camera, smile softening. “I think I need to buy your therapist a fruit basket or something.”
“Holy shit,” was the first reaction. Clint, as expected. He was gaping so excessively that Tony almost rolled his eyes. “You lifted it.”
Truth be told, the only picture he ever printed was the one of Tony. The others he kept on his laptop, forgetting about them a few weeks later.
“I fear I will not be much better,” Sir Anthony says. “My drawings tend to involve more mechanicals than pastorals.” He gestures around at the diagrams that surround them.
Perhaps highway robbery was not the path he should have taken. It is true that it sits uneasily on his shoulders, but he returns all that he takes - which is what he is doing right now after all. There is nothing dishonest in borrowing. Steve winces. He knows the law would not see it that way. And now he has dragged Sam - a perfectly respectable gentleman - into his madness, too.
“My apologies, Mr Stane. This is my fault,” he says. “I was feeling a little out of sorts and I needed to catch a breath of fresh air. Sir Anthony was merely enquiring after my health, as a considerate host. I assure you that he has been nothing but the picture of hospitality.”
As they step away from Sir Anthony, Obadiah says, just a little more loudly than necessary: “his mother, Lady Maria, was an excellent hostess. Her parties were the talk of the county. But Tony takes after his father more, as I’m sure you’ve noticed.”
“So you approve of me?” Steve asks, the words coming unbidden from his mouth. It’s a question he should not ask. It is too direct and far from polite.
Right. Yes. He has the mission. Sir Anthony is something he can worry about later. Steve forces the encounter to the back of his mind and returns to examining the lay of the land.
Barton nods once, his eyes narrowed, and Steve takes that as farewell, before darting off past the stable and into the woods where Liberty stands waiting for him.
“Yes, you shall smile through gritted teeth and try to bear it,” Sir Anthony says in a sorrowful tone, shaking his head in mock despair. “If you feel you are being overwhelmed give me a signal and I shall rescue you.”
“Sorry to have made you doubt yourself,” Steve says. “If it helps to assuage your ego, it did hurt a great deal.” Barton makes a face, wrinkling his nose.
“Now it is decided and we are definitely friends,” Steve says, “I hope you will take me up on my offer of coming by to see my sketches.”
Sir Anthony looks at him, his eyes are brown and deeper than Steve can fathom, looking at Steve like there is something he wants to say, something that Steve should be able to understand just from looking into those large dark eyes, but he cannot translate.
Was this a private room of Howard’s, Steve wonders, perhaps a private study that he had emptied when he left or-
Then, as quickly as it started, they’re twisting and almost floating. He can feel gravity pulling him down, but it doesn’t seem to have any power over them and Steve opens his eyes to look around.
A blue flash misses him. Steve can feel a strange crackle of air behind him as he skids over the floor and smashes, wheezing again, into the wall. He fumbles the key towards the lost and it takes him two attempts to slide it home, every second he’s expecting to feel one of those blue blasts hit him. He’s braced for the pain of it, but all he hears instead is the drone of repulsors blasting.
“Here you go, Tony,” Mr Stane says, and Sir Anthony takes the drink unthinkingly. Obadiah leans in a bit closer, a heavy hand coming up to rest on Sir Anthony’s shoulder as his voice lowers to an unctuous whisper. “You cannot monopolise the good captain’s time; he is much in demand and you have other guests to greet.” Sir Anthony nods and grimaces slightly, though the expression is gone in a moment and replaced by the bright, fake smile he often puts on in public. “Captain, we have a bridge party in the other room desperately in need of a fourth. Do you play?” His hand slips to Steve’s elbow and Steve pulls away instinctively.
“So you do not believe he is part of this conspiracy,” Steve says, frowning. “It seems unlikely that the two are not connected.”
“I liked it,” Mr Barton says, grinning broadly. “I mean, being a highwayman’s definitely got more flare than being a groom.” Steve tries not to smile, but there’s a certain energy about the man that is almost infectious, and Steve’s frown is not as hard as he would have liked.
“You haven’t seen it used for war?” Steve asks. He would have thought even the airships - especially the airships maybe, with their grand aerial battles, powered by the magical cores - would have seen the savagery of magical warfare. Captain Wilson shrugs.
“I am more than willing to speak ill of a man to his face if I believe he deserves it,” Steve says. “Believe me, it has got me into many scrapes, but you have been nothing but polite to me since my arrival. You have done far more for me than your father’s bequest could possibly have entailed. Whatever my opinions of your private life might be, it is your private life and as long as you do not harm anyone by it, it should remain private. It is not my business to pry into it.”
Things are far smoother now than they used to be. He has honed the process through trial and error, and he has no intention of allowing himself to be put in a position again like he had with Barton.
“Of course you don’t,” Sir Anthony says, shaking his head. “You are the epitome of what is good and right in this world, of course you don’t.”
“I don’t need a gun to shoot you, Mr Highwayman,” the man says. His voice sounds a little different though, a touch more refined than it had before, not very much, but as though the rough edges had been knocked off. “Turn around and hold your hands out to your sides.”
“It’s a two day ride at a civilised pace,” Sam tells him. “And there is an inn we can stop at tonight. It’s not exactly homely, but we’ve slept in worse places.”
“And you survived the war. I’m given to believe that it’s the soldiers who view their orders more flexibly who survive the longest.”
“Alright,” Iron Man - who absolutely is Tony Stark, meme be damned - says and steps forwards. “How are you with heights?”
“Ah…” Sir Anthony coughs. “That was the intention. At least it was when I set out. I thought that as you had been so good as to show me your sketches, I could do this… for you. You had mentioned previously that you would like to hear me play.”
In spite of his best intentions to fade into the background for the evening, Steve finds himself out on the dancefloor more than a couple of times. He does not, he is grateful to report, trip over his own feet, but the same cannot be said for his tongue. It seems that he still has not uncovered the secret of talking to pretty people in social situations.
And Steve would be in no position to accept such overtures even if they were made. He is lost since the war ended and his newest exploits would be unthinkable if he were connected to anyone, let alone Sir Anthony. He will risk no one else to his mission.
“If he shoots, the militia will hear it,” he tells her. He turns to Steve with a wicked grin. “They’ll be on you faster than a pack of dogs.”
“If he were part of this treason, don’t you think he would be more likely to kill you than to ask for an alliance?” Sam says. “He knows you're looking for something after all, and though he doesn’t know what that something is, he must know there is a chance it is related to his dealings.”
He winds up back at Lakefield splattered with mud and with his mind full of plans of attack. It is strange to be planning for just one person, rather than a whole team, and it hits him that he won’t have backup. That’s not something that has ever really been true before. Even when he thought he was alone, Bucky somehow always managed to be there.
“You always seem to cut through to the heart of the matter, Captain Rogers,” Sir Anthony says. “How is it that you read my mind better than I do myself? Am I so much an open book to you? Have you read me from cover to cover?”
Steve grits his teeth and concentrates hard on the clouds in front of him, the grain of the wooden rail, the broken corner of his thumbnail, jagged and uneven, barely hanging on. Anything but the stench of the dead men’s breath in his nostrils, the taste of someone else’s blood in his mouth.
And Bucky might suspect, but he does leave, which is practically permission. Not that Steve needs permission. He’s an adult. He can make his own decisions. And his decision tonight, is that he’s going to look into those creepy emails.
“You’ll be looking for something more along the lines of the bay rather than the chestnut over there,” Sir Anthony says, and Steve hums for a second.
Whatever Sir Anthony would or would not do is lost as the door swings open again, the noises of the party spilling out between them
Sir Anthony seems relieved by the change of subject and steps forwards. He gives a clear critique of Steve’s painting, although his comments tend towards the more technical, which isn’t entirely unexpected from a man who spends his days drawing blueprints. The conversation continues more lightly after that, and whatever moment had been between them before, it fades. Still there, but buried deeper now, not so close to the surface.
“I don’t think subtlety is really Captain Rogers’ strong point,” Sam says, his eyes sparkling just a bit as he smiles at Steve’s expense.
“Of course, Captain, but what I am saying is no secret. Everyone in the village knows it - and probably most of the town as well. Sir Anthony is not discreet in his attachments. There was Miss Frost, and Sir Tiberius, and it was terrible what happened to Miss Fujikawa. And then Miss Potts - or Mrs Hogan now, I should say. All of them jilted.”
“Where’s Liberty?” Steve shakes his head. He has no idea. If she’s been taken by the militia then it’s only a short while before they turn up on his doorstep demanding answers. If she evaded them, then she’ll turn up sooner or later. If anything else has happened… He sighs. She is a good horse. A friend, practically, albeit one who isn’t particularly talkative. But if she has been taken, then he’s going to need a nice explanation for the militia when they get here.
Steve feels a thrill in his chest, like the flutter before a battle. This place is secret. It is different. He sets the lamp on the desk and leans down to the chest. It is locked with a heavy padlock, but Steve takes a moment to snap it open and pulls up the heavy lid. The hinges let out a low, sad groan as they are put to use for the first time in decades.
The anticipation does nothing but prolong his discomfort. He paces the room, examines the books on the shelves and hears all the while the slow incessant ticking of the elegant clock on the mantelpiece.
Tony is mostly missing - his apologies are sent with a note that he is at a crucial stage in the development of his latest contraption. Sam will not hear of him being interrupted.
“Pompous, condescending ass,” Barton supplies. There is a laden silence where no one contradicts him.
“I think I made it worse,” he says, as though the crack had been there all along. “These tables look quite old.” Steve can only hope that Sam was not paying so much attention to the table, but he doesn’t look convinced. In a transparent attempt to avoid the subject, Steve changes it back quickly.
“I am afraid I must get some air,” he tells his current partner, and slips through the crowd to the balcony doors.
He hadn’t expected either of them to take off. But now the webcomic provides more than half of his annual income and the blog…
“He is in rude health, captain. Do not trouble yourself.” He leads Steve to the drawing room. “I shall inform him of your arrival. Please make yourself at home.” He bows again, then departs, disappearing into the house.
Mr Stane walks him to the door with a dedication that is admirable. On the way, he is careful to mention how important Sir Anthony’s work is and how it’s crucial that it not be delayed.
“I must forewarn you that I am terrible with art. And far too blunt about these things. Miss Po - Mrs Hogan, now, I must remember that - has always said I am too blunt about these things. I will speak my mind.”
It strikes Steve that he could have backup. He could tell Sam his plan, ask for his assistance. But the path he has embarked upon is not a safe one. It is illegal and dangerous for other reasons besides. Steve cannot be so selfish as to put Sam in danger merely because he wants a safety net. Sam has a family and a promising career in the aerial forces. Steve will not put that in jeopardy.
, he doesn’t say. It seems like half of all his conversations are unspoken now, like he’s forgotten how to speak. Sometimes he wonders if Bucky used to fill in all these gaps.
“I thought that as two people new to the area, we should stick together before we are overwhelmed by the locals.” She looks him up and down with a gaze that is a bit sharper than he would have expected.
Steve sleeps uneasily that night. He dreams of the cold and the screams again, but that is nothing new.
“But I'd wager that's what he heard,” Sam says. “Do you have any plans to fix things between you, at least? Our time here could be very uncomfortable if you fall out with the man who owns half the county.”
Steve checks the contents of his rucksack. Wirecutters, flashlight, pepper spray, inhaler, snacks, and the research on the few scraps of information he has: Camp Lehigh and Dr Arnim Zola. He’s got a camera on his phone, obviously, and his keys are in his pocket. Bucky didn’t take the rust bucket that they like to pretend is a car. He’s all set.
Steve knows that sound. You can’t live in New York and not know that sound, usually swooping overhead, often battling monsters down the street as you decide to stay in the coffee shop a little longer than you had originally planned.
“True. It is none of your business, I suppose, but I gather from your words you do hold opinions. I am sorry my private matters meet with your disapproval. I am sure you have no regrettable incidents in your own past.” He steps away, turning his back to Steve and going to mount his horse. Steve has the sinking feeling that he has trampled on something fragile. Sir Anthony looks back down at him once he is again astride.
“Oh, Nat and I go way back,” Mr Barton says. Steve’s eyebrows rise at the informality, even as Mrs Romanoff gives a long-suffering sigh.
“If you would like the piano, Sir Anthony, I can have it sent to the manor.” Before Tony can protest, Steve quickly continues. “There is no one here to play it and so fine an instrument should be played.”
“Certainly,” Philip says, darting in to lead Steve away to be measured before he can change his mind.
Steve grimaces. Bucky had always been the infiltration expert on their team. He had been able to sneak past an entire camp full of soldiers if he wished, and be completely unseen. He had indeed tried to teach Steve the finer points of stealth, but they had never quite caught on. Even when he was smaller, Steve had never been able to go unnoticed, although that was more the fault of his mouth than his appearance. And sneaking had never been his style. He prefers to be upfront about these things.
Iron Man is between him and the door, a shield of red and gold. There is a flash of blue and Steve hears Iron Man grunt with effort.
“You are my friend,” Sam says, cutting him off. “And travelling alone is a miserable business. I honestly can’t think of anything I would enjoy more.”
“I thought you were an honest man. There is nothing simple about you, Captain.” He runs a hand across the heavy leather cover of the treatise on termites and sighs. “I have met simple people; I know simple people. You are most assuredly not one of them.” He turns back to Steve, his eyes sharp and piercing once more. The clear intelligence in them very nearly takes Steve’s breath away. It does make his heart speed up in his chest, although whether that is from fear of those sharp eyes seeing through him, or merely in response to the intensity of Tony looking at him
He is glad that they are going home, glad that he had some part in making that happen. But he can barely listen to the praise when it is directed into the ether, to some man they know only as ‘The Captain’. He couldn’t take it if they were to direct it at him. Not when he knows that he doesn’t deserve it.
Sam finds his copy, as Steve changes out of the Nomad outfit. At every second, Steve is expecting a knock on the door below, or shouting in the driveway as the militia come to demand an explanation, but none comes.
“Oh Mr Stane!” says Miss Penelope Highcombe. “I declare you have found us the perfect bridge partner. Do sit down, Captain.”
He should dance, he knows that's true. It is rude not to, just as Bucky has always said, but it's not something he knows how to do. When he was younger, he was laughed away whenever he tried, and no one would return the favour. Now… now he feels as if he will shatter if he takes one step towards the dancefloor and the laughing couples upon it.
“Oh shit.” Iron Man says, landing on the floor. They can still hear the thud of footsteps and the shout of voices, but Steve needs his phone. And he needs to breathe. “You’re asthmatic. Where’s your inhaler?” How does Iron Man know he’s asthmatic? Steve wonders with the little bit of his brain that is just sort of… detached from the situation. His hands still scrabble at the guard’s uniform.
Sam’s parents receive Steve with all the hospitality of family, even though Steve can’t respond as effusively himself. He feels a little like he is constantly in the way as the family carries on around him. It is a pleasant atmosphere, but he cannot help disappearing to the library every so often, or for a turn around the grounds, just to clear his head.
“It does,” Steve agrees. They look at each other for a long moment before Sir Anthony seems to shake himself and bursts into movement again. He stands and reaches out a hand to shake Sam’s. Then he reaches out for Steve’s hand. The touch of skin against skin is strangely charged, warm, but sending a spike of energy through Steve’s gut. He looks into the warm brown eyes that look back at him and smiles in what must be an idiotic way. The sound of the music has settled down deep inside him, like a warm cat purring in delight.
“Don’t you start,” Sam says with a sigh, going to fetch himself a drink from the decanter on the desk. “Steve, you have to rescue me.”
“Yes, you do! And I am offering to assist you in obtaining them, or are you refusing my assistance? I should warn you that I’m not often so benevolent, Captain Rogers. You should take advantage of my kindness while you can.” He pauses and looks at Steve askance, as though he cannot figure out what to make of him. “Usually I don’t have to convince people to do so. You’re a very unusual man.” Steve frowns at the implications of that statement, but before he can comment, Sam interrupts.
He had known that it might happen in an abstract sort of way, though Tony had not left his house since Steve had moved in - not overnight anyway, as far as Steve knew. It wasn’t as if he was keeping a watch on Tony’s comings and goings.
“Coming, Nat,” Barton says cheerfully, touching his forelock with a bow that seems more insolent than respectful as he follows her out. “Your horse is in the stable, by the way. Try not to let her get away again. You never know who might have found her.”
“Thank the higher powers, or you’d be lying bleeding somewhere in the woods,” Sam says. “But you’re sure it was them.”
“I’m telling you, if someone finds out what we’re carrying, we’ll be hanging from the gallows before the sun’s even risen.”
The diagrams themselves are bad enough. He knows what they are - Tony’s latest designs for aether engines for the sky ships. He and Sam have been discussing ways to mitigate kickback for weeks. But it is the note stuffed in with them that makes his heart stop in his chest.
He finds Sam and allows the conversation to surround him in a mass of words and murmurs that fade into each other. Luckily, he is not expected to provide much conversation, just agree or laugh at the appropriate moments.
“You are going to tell me that it would not be a suitable match. But that does not seem the sort of thing that would stop you,” Sam says.
“Just me,” Steve replies. He’s aware he’s dragging the mood down. The captain is trying to be friendly. Steve would swear he used to be better at this. Maybe he never was. Most of his conversations ended with the other person walking away, or with them punching him. That’s probably not a good track record. “What about you?
No. The man is doing exactly as he said: looking out for Tony’s best interests. To question his motives would be overstepping the boundaries of friendship in a terrible manner.
“Brooklyn,” Sam confirms, he turns to shout an order to his crew, then turns back. “Welcome home, Steve.”
Tony’s face goes cold and blank and Steve notes the hard look in Colonel Danvers’ eyes and the way Colonel Rhodes’ hands tighten on the silverware. He shares a look with Sam.
“I mean,” Steve pauses, looking around at the ancient technology and the crackly image of Zola’s smug face. “I live in New York. Last week there were radio-controlled flower monsters trying to eat me. After that, a man in a computer just seems… sort of ordinary. You’re not even HD.”
Steve could not say why, but it feels as though entering the house would break some sort of spell, or a confidence maybe. The music feels like a secret that Steve has been fortunate enough to overhear, and he does not want to shatter the peace that seems to settle over him at the sound of it.
“If you were, then I would not be here,” Sir Anthony replies, then he pauses with a sigh. “Captain Rogers, you are a good man, but you are now a man of consequence and it is no great secret that all of this-” Sir Anthony spreads his hands wide - “is new to you. Allow me to make it easier, please. Clothes that fit you properly will make the world of difference, both in how the world sees you and how you see yourself.”
The words slip out of Steve’s mouth, a part of the persona he pulls on with his highwayman’s outfit. The Nomad, as he decided to style himself, is an amalgam of every adventure tale he has read. The kind of stories he and Bucky would read when they were kids - most emphatically without their parents’ permission. He is a rake, a flirt, but Steve hasn’t really fallen all that well into that aspect of the character.
“We’re heading into Brooklyn skyport,” Captain Wilson says, snapping the silence between them. “You been there before?”
But he forges ahead, not knowing where he is going in the slightest, but Liberty seems to know something, or she at least has a firm idea of where she would like to be. She picks her way around trees and through the undergrowth, sure and quick.
“True breeding and education shine like diamonds, don’t you agree, Tony,” Stane says, turning to Tony to hand him a glass.
·       He loves animals and is studying to be a vet at NYU. Right now, he put his studies on hold until they bring his baby sister home.
“I’m sorry that must have been really hard for you.” Tony didn’t mean to sound as gleeful as he did. Steve shook his head no and picked up Tony’s hand sending shocks through his body. He didn’t pull away even though he knew he should have as he kept looking at the ring on his finger.
“Come on,” Tony said, packing the album back in its box and heading towards the door. “The kids will leave soon and I wanna say goodbye. Pepper’s got gifts for them, as well.”
“Don’t worry, I’m not –” He stops when it hits him that for all they discussed their feelings and insecurities, team dynamics didn’t even skirt the edges of his mind, let alone cross it. It’s easy for him - he would and he will follow Steve to the end of the world. He’ll be honest and call Steve out when needed but his loyalties are firmly with the man. The poignant pause that makes Tony roll his eyes. “Don’t all rush in, guys.”
He offers a reassuring smile and a nod before dropping the faceplate. “Come on,” he urges. He lifts off, grabbing Steve’s outstretched arm and depositing him on the street below. The man takes off as soon as his feet touch the tarmac.
Above him, Tony was trying to catch his breath, fingers clenched in Steve’s hair. “Don’t come yet,” he gasped. “Come sit on my lap, darling. Let me take care of you.”
Steve took him into his throat, ignoring the ways his eyes watered or the uncomfortable pressure. He looked up; Tony’s mouth was hanging open, the flush spreading from his chest to his neck and jawline. His eyes were blown wide open, pupils enlarged. Steve moved. Up-and-down, up-and-down. When he needed air, he replaced his mouth with his hand, twisting it, then dived back in to focus on sucking the head into his hollowed cheeks. He could feel spit dribble down his chin, tears running down his cheeks, and amidst everything, the only sound he could focus was the frequency of Tony’s moans. He could feel his testicles tighten, the shaft pulsing in his hand.
Then he dived down, taking Steve in his mouth and sucking on the head greedily. Steve’s hips thrusted up and he lacked the will or the power to stop himself. Tony received him eagerly. The throat engulfing Steve’s dick was possibly heaven, with its heat and tightness. Tony moaned and Steve’s torso shot up to look at him.
Steve’s face hardened and he opened his mouth to reply. A police officer who was overseeing the movement away from the deflagration stepped in then. “Sir,” he said, accent present but voice commanding. “Please go and join the other journalists before you get trampled by our emergency team.”
Steve’s hand cupped the back of Tony’s head when he descended once more on Steve’s neck. He licked and bit, sucked on his pulse point, drawing loud moans from Steve’s throat. He kissed his way down, closing his lips over a hardened nipple. He flicked his tongue over it repeatedly, before switching to rolling it between his fingers.
“Nuh-uh, I’m all vanilla and shit.” He paused briefly before laughing. “I really tried to stay serious, but I lost it, sorry.”
“In me,” Steve answered instantly. “Want you to split me open and fuck me.” He had to let go of his cock for fear of coming. One of his hands pulled at his balls while the other dipped to spread some of the saliva on his hole. He rubbed on it, then pushed the tiniest amount in, enjoying the burn.
“What was?” Steve asked as they walked around some more, trying to find the next attraction to visit.
Weeks passed like that, he would spend the long sleepless nights reading people’s reactions. He replied to some. The media caught wind of that and Buzzfeed wrote a listicle about it. He wrote to Buzzfeed, a nicely worded short letter where he explained he would appreciate if they didn’t exactly
“I was determined to wait longer, but you’re so inviting. Look at you,” he said, and dived in to take one of the balls in his mouth.
with pining and with acting like an idiot. Although this definitely wasn’t acting like an idiot, but at least they were communicating. “Well, we’re not communicating, I’m just shouting and actually making everything worse.”
The train metaphor, Steve figured, came from the abruptness of the entire thing. It was all going fine. Natasha’s birthday was coming up and she made a point to not say anything about it. It was all a bit uncertain anyway – her age, her exact date of birth – all of it buried in triple classified files hidden in underground bunkers under a lake in Switzerland; or something. The intel was her birthday was on the 22nd of November, and they accepted it as such.
He did. On autopilot, driven by the need for release and by the image his mind had conjured of Tony’s throat. The man rolled over, scooted up so his head was falling back off the edge easily. Steve’s knees were weak, but he forced them to cooperate. He wanted it, but he was reluctant. Despite the hyperjump in levels of intimacy, from comforting as friends to handjobs and making out like horny teenagers, Steve felt that perhaps this was pushing it too much.
Tony smiled at him. “Don’t worry about it. Look, I’m sorry Cap. I didn’t mean it like that, I’m so proud of—“
“As long as you need.” He openly ogled Steve as he moved to get the box from their bedroom. “So what do you want in return?”
Pepper joined them, taking her heels off as soon as she entered the room. Her loud gasp and happy smile told Steve he’d done a good job. “Guys, this is so pretty!” She was handed the large box of baubles they had left and she placed a couple on before turning towards them. “Okay good news and more good news, which ones do you want first?”
Nine. “Steve once hugged me on top of a building and it was better than cookies.” Steve was now clutching the armchair, trying to stay put. Ten. “Steve Rogers smells like summer evenings and I -” He downed his shot, and swatted at Natasha’s shoulder lightly. “Pepper told you, didn’t she?”
Tony chuckled, still chasing Steve’s palm until it rested on his head again. He sighed happily when the fingers were back in his hair. Only then did he twist his wrist, just a tiny bit, but enough to make Steve shudder when he felt the pleasure again. “Like that?” he asked cheekily.
too old and his age was finally showing. He wasn’t certain he could still blush after the super serum, but it was a blushable situation. So, yeah, he had been in the army and they were all filthy and he wasn’t actually as much of a prude of people made him out to be. But it was still a blushable situation. There were things he couldn’t shake despite everything he’d seen. And jelly dicks on a tray was one of them, apparently.
“Oh, he also said ‘we’ll make up this story about you needing to fight Nazis and that’s why we’re doing all this, but you know the truth about your true calling in life, and on top of that maybe we’ll get lucky and you’ll freeze for fifty years to catch him at a prime time for astounding!’”
Steve didn’t know what he wanted to punch more: himself, Tony, Howard, the universe, himself (he deserved to be on the list twice for the sheer stupidity he exhibited), or fourteen reinforced bags. Of course Tony had some sort of thing with her before, why the fuck would that not be the case? And of course he remembered every stupid detail about the scientist, because why the fuck would he not be pathetic?
“Oh. True. Then let me change that answer: maybe, given how this goes.” He winked, though, a grateful smile blooming on his face, and Steve thought maybe he wouldn’t say no regardless of how it went. “Now get on with it, show me some skin!”
He was wide-eyed, cheeks stretched by the angle with which Steve’s cock nestled in his throat. He slid back, letting go with a pop. He kept the eye contact as his hands reached under Steve, lifting his hips. With steady fingers, he pulled his buttcheeks apart, exposing him. “Fuck, you’re perfect,” he whispered to himself.
He moved to pick them up, but Steve grabbed his hand. “Please don’t! I love the cupcakes so much,” he managed.
Tony’s eyes shone prettily in the bluish light. He kissed Steve deeply, grinding into him sharply once. “Later, please?”
The sky lit up as soon as the countdown ended. Downstairs, he imagined Bucky caught someone’s lips in a cheeky kiss. Thor had probably lifted Jane off the ground as they kissed. Bruce and Darcy were probably stood together on the side, embraced and optimistic. He rejoiced in being alone even more knowing his family were alright.
Tony didn’t even try to hide the giddiness in his posture and voice as he agreed. “You wanna put the dishes away first?” There was no judgement or teasing in his voice, just a touch of care, and if Steve hadn’t already loved him with all his being, now would have sealed it for the rest of eternity.
Tony sighed. “As much as I hate to be the voice of reason – and I hate it a lot – they’ll burn down New Jersey without us there.”
Steve maneuvered the goat and checked its belly. “Girl,” he announced. Then he saw it. “Oh, Tony.” She had no hind legs, Steve wasn’t sure how he’d missed it. She also looked young and extremely domesticated judging by the way she had settled in his arms.
“For one, I would very much like to know why you’re circumcised. Because holy shit, this is a beautiful dick!” He emphasised his enthusiasm with a well-gripped stroke.
“What is wrong with you?” and “Are you actually insane Wilson?” and “What’s next, getting him in a bin bag?” and “Pepper, now! Take them away now when he’s not looking!” and Steve was honestly baffled.
Vision let all the kids touch him, and giggled when tiny fingers poked at the Mind Stone. “I don’t think it likes the tickling,” he said trying to stifle his laughter. The kids were fascinated by Bucky’s arm, even though he wore a long sleeved top to try and hide it. They lifted the sleeve and started counting the segments, asking what it could do and if they could draw on it. When Bucky informed them crayons wouldn’t show, he offered the alternative of paper and his company. They readily agreed.
As soon as he assessed the situation, he was back on his feet, pulling the tree off Human Torch and carrying him away. Wanda kept a shield up behind them, and Reed slithered to where Steve was hiding both of them from the remaining bots while Tony hatefully disposed of them.
“The kid’s gonna be fine, it’s superficial at best,” Tony dodged the gratitude and turned to Steve, the scowl still in place.
“This is not New York, Captain. You can’t order us around. Don’t you think you’ve done enough damage here?”
happen. Steve would go to his grave claiming that. Darcy howled with laughter at his little jump, and the others were in various degrees of hysterics. Steve hated all of them. He cut through the crispy skin with a scowl on his face. This was ridiculous. Again. He pushed the leg down with the fork, then cut straight through the ball joint.
After a brief rearranging, the contestants sat or kneeled around the table. Everyone moved out of the way, and Clint made sure to put some raunchy music on before getting in position. He dished out the jelly dicks on cake plates and got Vision to count to three. As soon as the word was said, they all bent their heads and went for it.
Vision was nothing if not efficient. Within minutes he was flying away with their Christmas tree. Considering it a small victory, Steve threw himself into the hordes of people, entering shop after shop. By early afternoon, they were finally done. Ladened with baubles, and hundreds of yards of lights and tinsel and ribbon, they finally hopped into a taxi and made their way to the tower. Steve made sure to not buy Bucky any burgers.
Wanda nodded and started levitating ribbon, draping it on the smaller branches that the tinsel didn’t cover. She made it fold into neat bows wherever she thought they looked good.
If Steve could pick a happy place, he was really spoilt for choice. It helped that he found peace in simple things, in pretty things, in quiet things. On top of that, any place that contained Tony in any way, shape, or form had quickly become a happy place for him. A meadow. A bookstore. Jazz in the background while he sat and finished up dinner with Tony. He really was a man of simple taste.
Tony seemed to be aware of it, so he focused on showing Steve affection in silence. Eventually, amidst the slow kissing and soft touches, he spoke again. “I broke the glass I was holding when I saw you kissing that woman,” he admitted quietly.
“Not a horse, Tony, a mighty steed!” he emphasised. “How about you bring the box of decorations over here,” he asked the kids, “and I can get you up on my shoulders so you put them in the tree?”
“Stark!” Bucky’s voice has a sense of urgency as it reaches him. He watches the man gesture to his ear as T’Challa’s clawing at what’s left of the bots.
“Hell of a full name, as well,” Tony agreed. When Steve stayed quiet, he continued. “I read everything I could get my hands on,” he explained. “Aunt Peggy used to tell me bedtime stories from the war, and then from SHIELD. I used to sneakily drink coffee when no one was looking so I could stay up and listen to her. She figured it out one night, made me promise I wouldn’t do that anymore. But she’d come earlier and spend more time with me. When I was old enough to drink coffee without getting in trouble she was exasperated.”
“That’s the thing. For someone so fucking smart, you’re being an idiot.” She turned to Steve. “Now, you. Both this dummy and myself and kinda drunk and I need you to bear witness to all this for when he’s trying to deny it all in typical fashion.” Steve nodded solemnly, trying to hold his laughter in. Everything was surreal. His entire life was a joke. “Now, you’re gonna get up,” she said, pulling at Bruce’s hand, “and walk with me over to that massive armchair. I’m gonna climb in your lap and you’re gonna tell me every reason you have for not wanting me –"
“I want to see you…” He had to, his sanity depended on it. “I want to see you fucking me with your fingers. Oh, Jesus!” Tony had plunged back in, sliding Steve’s dick into his throat yet again. “And – oh, fuck!”
So, Steve’s life was hectic. He was fine with it. There was a lot to be grateful for, mostly being alive, so he took it all as such and using Fury’s words compartmentalized the shit out of it.
“I think the fuck not, I want us to leave here still friends. Try explaining to Fury that the Avengers are splitting over a card game,” Tony settled it.
“Mhm,” the scientist offered from his glass. “Chloe, sit down and get something to eat. And ditch the lump on your arm, he’s about as useful as a hole in a condom.”
“Mhm, don’t mention it.” He checked the stick and threw it away when he realised Steve had finished the cotton candy. “I used to get bad days a lot,” Tony offered. “It’s better these days, but the feeling stays with you.”
“I would grip my cock hard — yes, like that!” Steve mimicked what Tony had said with surprising precision given how unbelievably clouded his mind was. “And I’d whisper it to myself, I’d say ‘darling darling darling my darling Steve’ and I’d think about that perfect mouth of yours and the way it would look like wrapped around — fuck.”
She scoffed. “You should know better,” she told him, wiping down the burns on his arms. Steve looked at her work. She seemed to be in her forties, and the motherly air around her comforted him.
He wasn’t ready for the constant bouts of insomnia, alternating with sleeping for sixteen hours. He tried his best to act like nothing was out of the ordinary. He was constantly wired, even on days when he hadn’t slept. His mind was beyond loud, it had become constant background noise.
without his suit on. Asshole. Once more, he almost flies there, but there’s a fresh wave of robots and Tony’s ready to use the heavy weaponry and get it over with.
“You will be if you keep this up,” Steve replied. “You have no business with these nice people, leave them alone.”
They were dropped off in front of what could easily pass as a sumptuous building of sorts, but to Steve’s artist eye looked at least as garrish as the room back at the hotel. Steel beams and glossy windows stood out in the overwhelming surrounding architecture – a collection of fluid lines and gargoyles, with high windows and wooden frames, with old school roofs and rich gardens. Steve was used to taking in his surroundings for tactical purposes, but at that moment it seemed like a good distraction. They were to be welcomed by some committee of mostly men, suits not fitted properly – and Steve was not one to judge, the ill-fitting suits weren’t the problem. But the people wearing them, strangled by their crooked ties and red in the face as if they had been running up and down trying to seem hard-working. Steve hated it.
She snorted and went on to rummage through a drawer. When she returned she held out a pair of silver Iron Man cufflinks. Steve took them and tried not to stare. “You know how to use cufflinks, I assume?” she asked.
Natasha stepped forward and knelt by the end of the coffee table. She looked up at Tony with a smirk. “Well, it
“It does,” Steve said. He could feel the cold retreat to its small place in the back of his mind. He was safe, safe in Tony’s arms, cared for at the tips of his fingers. He blocked the thoughts of being a burden, of being weak, of being anything other than loved. He dared to think the word, despite knowing it would backfire terribly once he had full control of his mind again.
Steve’s hips seemed to have settled on presenting to Tony of their own accord, and he pulled his knees towards his chest, lust overtaking self-consciousness. Tony kept at his frantic licking, alternating broad strokes and sharp-tongue incursions.
Vision floated through the wall covered in colourful paper chains. They were hanging around his neck and shoulders and arms, and he was holding even more in his hands, making him look like a kindergarten art project gone extreme. “I watched a tutorial, and people said these are popular around this holiday, so I made some.”
He wants to get Steve to hold the shield up and do another reflective strong beam. They’d rehearsed it before, it works well, and the number of enemies asks for it. Steve’s arm is pulled back and he looks ready to launch the shield again.
“What if - and feel free to say no, always feel free to say no to me, Steve,” he added more seriously, “what if I find ways to, encourage your storytelling, shall we call it?” His hand cupped Steve’s heavy balls, moving up to grip his hardening cock.
He sighed. “Bucky’s supposed to send food up, but he’s also a dickhead so I’m not sure what he’s doing.”
She blushed. “Steve, then. I…” she faltered. “I would like to say that this was a very nice thing to hear and that it gives us hope that we can still fight the good fight.” She then said something in rapid Russian and Steve blinked. “Shit, sorry that was not English. Just thank you,” she added, wringing her hands.
“Clearly.” There was a pause. Steve figured he deserved the impatient tone. He wished he could get up and go back to his bed, in the solitude of his room, where no one would see him like this. “I’m sorry, that was uncalled for. How can I help?”
Things settled down for a bit. When Doombots attacked, Reed Richards called Tony and when Tony ignored it, proceeded to call Steve who also wanted to ignore him but was essentially a good person. It was just to inform them that they got it, and Steve really wanted to stay out of it, but the line went dead right after a horrible scream and he sighed, suited up, grabbed Wanda and ran out to help.
He headed to Tony’s lab as soon as he made sure Wanda was not hurt. It was uncharacteristically quiet, even if the lights were on. He used his access code and endured the accompanying song that played when he entered - Steve still didn’t know what he was, and he always had more pressing matters than to find it afterwards. Tony wasn’t in there; he had half expected to see him on the corner sofa that was more comfortable than anything Steve had ever slept on. In fact, Steve could easily sit down for a bit. And he could even recline and maybe just fall asleep for a couple of minutes. The last thing he saw was the hole in the ceiling, the rubble on the floor, and with an affectionate “Fuck’s sake, Stark,” he fell asleep.
“Fucking perfect,” he mumbled. He started brushing his collarbones, then his shoulders. “I’ve always had a weakness for you, but I’ve been obsessing over your chest and arms for so long now. After your little bench pressing marathon, this has been all I could think about.” He bent to kiss his heated skin.
Steve’s skin was on fire. A good type of burning, nothing like the panic induced stifling heat he had recently woken up to. He was tingling, small electric shocks that stemmed from his mouth and bloomed throughout his entire body. Tony pressed into him, his frame fitting onto Steve’s perfectly. He could feel the man’s tongue timidly advancing into their open mouthed kiss and he met it with his own, licking it slowly in return. Tony moaned then, quietly, almost restrained. His dick twitched in his pants, and given how close they were, there was no way Tony hadn’t felt it. He pulled back, putting some distance between them.
“It’s the serum,” Steve muttered, embarrassed by the way his dick twitched as Tony’s hand touched lower on his hip bones.
Steve brought the mug from his bedroom, where Tony spent the night definitely not debating ways of kissing Steve’s collarbone. Steve could definitely not say the same. “There you go. I’m taking a shower, getting dressed, and if you know what’s good for you, you better be in the lobby in thirty minutes.”
“Nah,” Steve confirms, but his voice is distant, like he’s only half replying. Tony regrets ever mentioning Storm’s name. “Not really,” he adds quietly.
Back in the drinking den, the tv was still on, showing something that looked exceptionally dramatic judging by the number of slaps that happened in the span of a minute while he watched. It must have been one of those soap operas that Darcy told him about. He’d watched a couple of episodes with her one night when she couldn’t sleep. It was in Spanish, and while he wasn’t fluent, he understood enough to make him want to both watch some more and go to bed at the same time.
He ran all the way to his room, forgoing using the elevator altogether, fearful of meeting anyone. He lost track of the time he spent in the shower. It had been very early morning when he got there, if the hues of the sky were accurate. He spent what felt like hours rubbing at every inch of his skin, eager to clean himself of sweat and all the embarrassment. Had it not been enough he fucked up so royally mere weeks ago? Had it not been enough there were people still dealing with the fallout from that while he, incompetent and good-for-nothing as he was, couldn’t even control his fucking brain to at least make sure he was alone when he broke down. Maybe they should have given him brain serum as well, what good was his strength if he cried in the shower as he thought back on every single thing he’d ever done wrong?
The snarky tone prompted Steve to palm his dick, too desperate for release to be embarrassed by openly touching himself, through his pants nonetheless, in front of Tony. “A fan, yeah?”
There was a pause. “Well, no. But I’m making a conscious decision to not get her caught in this even if she thinks it’s what she wants.”
“When was the last time you touched the washing machines? Actually when was the first?” Steve whispered-shouted back.
Thor and Jane were holding hands on the table, both of them trying to accommodate as much as possible down their throats. Jane seemed to be doing better, but it could have been the fact that she wasn’t smiling like an idiot. Thor… not so much. Darcy kept her eyes trained on Bruce. The scientist still had his small smile on, Steve was glad to see. Even if it looked vaguely pained, like he didn’t know what to do with his hands, or how to lean on the sofa better. Darcy pulled back, smirked at him, actually had the audacity to wink, and wiped at the corner of her mouth before taking most of the thing down her throat. For the first time since their competition started, Steve felt some inkling of arousal.
“Yeah, how dare you not reciprocate my thoughtful gift of an improvement on the shield that isn’t ready because I didn’t get round to manage to steal it from you and now it’s too late cause you already know so can you bring it downstairs soon?”
“What kiss?” he asked Natasha, then Steve and tried to hurry everything along as he was expected on stage.
are not here to do politics. We stay away from that due to the nature of our jobs. We don’t run for congress and we’re not here to toss around your democracy. Have you seen my costume? I’m all for democracy. But not corruption. Not even sanctions that international forums may impose – these would only affect your people. Keep your promises and neither our support nor our friendship will be retracted. In hindsight, asking me to do this was a poorly calculated decision. Really, a statue?” he asked the prime-minister directly, leaning towards the podium involuntarily and catching himself when he realised he was doing it.
“You were parallel with time,” she started. She held Steve’s hand in both her own while she kneaded his fingertips. “But not anymore. You are here, now.”
The man held Bennu up next to his face. “Look at us together, how can you break us apart like that?”
“Yes, Lady Darcy,” Thor said and Steve couldn’t stop laughing when Darcy shouted, “Golly! A talking horse!”
“I started working for you,” she replied and pushed the box towards them. “Come on, grab a sweater, put it on, stand around the tree. Someone help Pietro, please,” she instructed quickly. “We need a photo of the official team - Rhodey go next to Tony, maybe some of your maturity will rub off on him. Photo for the auction first, and then we can take some for us.”
It was true. He’d practically moved into Tony’s massive suite. But there was a sort of reinforced security in having his own room somewhere in the tower, a safety net just in case everything went to shit. He didn’t like entertaining those thoughts. Steve had no time to reply before the string of messages started pouring in, making him laugh.
“Hey, remember our talk about a working HR? This is one of those things that can easily be added to –”
Steve cuddled him, cupping his head to kiss him gently, unhurriedly, enjoying the time they had together away from the world. Eventually, it got heated again. They’d moved from innocent to hungry tongue-heavy kisses, to hips bucking uncontrollably, to Tony sliding back next to Steve and prompting him to continue talking. His hand resumed his previous action, providing too little to get Steve off, but enough to get him hot and bothered.
Tony laughed. “That’s my fault. If I’d asked if you had a crush, I’d have known if you were lying. Next time I’ll ask.” Steve chuckled. “What’s the matter, darling?
“Good memory,” he said instead of all the ramblings in his head. Tony nodded in understanding and the quiet stretched between them until it became uncomfortable despite the noise in the room. “Are you still mad at me?”
and Darcy just sighed and took a step forward too. Steve recognized it for what it was: solidarity. He’d done enough stupid shit for Bucky to know it intimately.
thing. And yes, it could be hurtful not to have actual family around this time of the year, but Steve thought a surrogate was better than nothing. So they’d all gather round, watch crappy holiday movies, drink and eat, and just do newly-regular things. He’d never properly had that. Besides, it would be Thor’s first real celebration. Not to mention the twins – yes, they came from a different culture, but the sentiment was genuine. And he knew for a fact Vision interrogated Clint about the true meaning of the holiday, so at least he was curious, if not excited.
“Okay. I understand. You need to do this, and I will support you in every way I know how to. Besides, it's only two years. It’s not that long.” Steve pulled Tony in for a kiss. He didn’t know how he could have been so lucky to find the love of his life. Tony was the best thing in life.
“Would you like to see your new blessing?” Tony wiped away the tear he didn’t realize was streaming down his cheek. He nodded his head yes. Tony leaned back lifting his shirt up. He never realized how much his stomach had grown. He’d done this two other times and knew he would be fully showing in two weeks. Crazy he thought one minute he had two almost grown boys and the next he was starting all over but this time alone. His thoughts faded away when he heard the thumping echo of the heartbeat.
·       He is dyslexic. He’s very smart; it just takes him some time to put all of the pieces together.
“What do you mean you can’t do this anymore? You can’t love me. I’m trying.” Steve’s voice rose with anger. “Why can’t you see I’m trying!”
“Steve, I realize you just got home from a nine-month-long mission but.” Tony sucked in another breath trying to push through the next contraction. “We are having a baby.” Steve went into a hyper mode not knowing what to do. He was going to be a dad like now.
“Wait, I’m sorry. I shouldn’t have asked that.” Steve stood up and walked over to the counter adjacent to Tony as not to push him away any farther. Tony kept his back turn towards him fiddling with an empty bottle in his hands.
“You know I can’t do that. Bucky will be asking questions and I want to break things off with him in a gentle way. It’s just not the right time. You understand right.” Tony looked over his shoulder at Steve not knowing what he would find but his heart broke when he didn’t see Steve looking at him. That Steve wasn’t begging to stay.  Most nights he would just bite his tongue. Then Steve would kiss him on the cheek, and they would meet again on a night of Steve’s choice but tonight was not that night.
“Whatever. I never heard of a guy turning down sex before. I’m going to go take a warm shower.” Steve began to follow but Tony stopped him. “It’s fine. I can shower on my own. If I need anything I will yell.” Tony leaned down and kissed Steve on the cheek. Steve didn’t protest knowing he would never win against his very pregnant husband.
“Great minds and all that,” he heard, and even if he didn’t know all aspects of that voice already, the way his heart soared made it all clear.
“Right, right. Cap, you didn’t fuck up. The team, Nat and me, we’re all in this with you. These assholes need to know they can’t do this to their own people.”
But Tony laughed, held him even closer. “Consider it lifted. After your performance? Steve, I’ll agree to a ball. Like, evening attire, dancing, fancy hors d’oeuvre ball.”
The pages were filled with black and white photos of young Maria and Howard, of baby Tony, of Jarvis holding Tony, of Peggy cuddling him on the floor, of a toddler Tony sleeping with a toy Captain America shield. There were photos of Howard trying to calm Tony down as he was holding a meeting with what looked like officials. It spread out over years, and Steve had to persuade Vision to put in a good word with Friday to get some photos of teen Tony, and he was now torn between regretting everything and moving to the depths of the Arctic Ocean, and kissing the man’s watery eyes.
Steve was tired. Perhaps the demons would be appeased and he wouldn’t dream once he fell asleep, but regardless, his last conscious thought before drifting off was telling them he was safe and warm and in Tony’s arms and honestly, they should fuck off.
It happened extremely quickly. He was pulled away from the bar gently but firmly. He knew to differentiate threatening touches from his teammates’. So he allowed himself to be maneuvered a couple of steps back. As soon as there was more room around him, he felt them close in on him. There was definitely Bucky, Natasha who was chuckling next to his ear, Bruce (even in hindsight he didn’t see that one coming) and Darcy (he definitely saw that one metaphorically running towards him because prank plots always involved Darcy), Thor, and Clint who seemed to coordinate the mayhem. Sam was late to this very invading reunion, but he emerged in between Thor and Darcy and closed in on him quickly.
Steve speaks at the same time. “Wanda, come in!” Then he turns to Tony as much as he can, smiling sweetly. “Sorry, I didn’t –”
“Not yet,” Tony said, and he was back to rimming him. His tongue hot and wet as it slid inside him mercilessly. And when he moved away, he was mouthing at his balls, sucking one in his mouth, then the other. Sloppy kisses everywhere he could, at the base of his cock, up the shaft. And in an instant he had Steve in his throat, three fingers deep inside him, prodding at his prostate insistently.
Steve sighed. He couldn’t even remember if he’d apologised before, but once more couldn’t hurt. “I’m sorry, Tony, I didn’t mean to be so —“
They looked at each other, trying to figure out what he meant. Tony was surprisingly the one to answer, not even lifting his head from his potato salad. “You, of course. And hurry up, I want to get to that crisp skin sooner rather than later.” When no one said anything, he looked up. “What?”
He must have fallen asleep at some point because Tony shook him awake gently when they’d landed. He felt like he’d been through a grinder of sorts, there was restlessness gripping under his ribcage, the tingles rippling outwards. He clenched his fists. He was groggy, quiet as they disembarked and headed inside the tower.
Steve lets go and lands more gracefully than Tony thought possibly. He’s up in no time, rushing to help. “Vision, what’s Thor’s status?”
The trip was uneventful, he’d kept his eyes firmly planted on his phone, avoided eye contact, the usual. It still felt like he was doing something clandestine, a forbidden thing of sorts. Which was ridiculous, really. He was over a hundred and a superhero —again, Darcy’s words for whenever he tried to make a point that maybe something wasn’t really okay to do. The trip back to the tower was even more of a thrillride, the parcel burning him through the backpack where he’d stuffed it quickly before heading home.
you carved for him any more you’ll tear up space and time.” He turned to Bruce, “You might actually be the least interested, given your little tradition, but you want to birthday hug him so you should be thinking of a bargaining chip too.” He paused to inhale deeply and opened his mouth to go on. “Pietro, you —“
Pietro’s eyes widened. “Really?” he asked Steve, who was always the man he turned to for confirmation and orders.
Also, this is not Yank-wanked (how fucking funny is this term, oh my god) - I forget to spell words the American way like 90% of the time, so excuse words that look odd.
“Oh, child. And so we tried to entertain ourselves but it got old quickly and we agreed that you’re extremely important to both of us and we wanted you to come join us for some fun and -”
“Stark,” Clint started quietly, now half lying on the kitchen island, staring up into the camera. Steve knew a drama queen when he saw one. “Where. Is. the. Ice cream?”
Tony took the head in his mouth - loosely, not even sucking on it yet, and Steve was certain he would die. The heat was gone as quickly as it came, and Steve’s eyes flew open. “Look at me,” he heard Tony instruct and he propped himself up on his elbows to watch. Satisfied with the audience, Tony went back to the task at hand. He moved his tongue out purposefully slow, thriving on the way Steve’s body shook with anticipation. Not taking his eyes off Steve’s, he lowered his tongue enough to lick into the leaking slit. Over his own moans, Steve heard him speak. “Tell me about the dream, darling.”
Tony was curled up in the armchair, one knee up to his chest as much as possible in the smallish seat. He was trying to reach a throw with his other leg, toes stretched inside the sock he still had on.
The car ride was oddly quiet compared to the madness Steve experienced before. Inside his mind, however, the war waged on. He fought himself. Hard. He fought memories of being blamed for things. He fought losing his friends and family. His mind supplanted the worst of scenarios and during all of it he stayed quiet, eyes shut and containing the explosions behind his lids.
“Best news I got all year! And refractory period or not, being with you is… I guess ‘intense’ is the best word.”
“Remember when I had that bartending thing in Vegas? Well, there were a shit-ton of bachelorette parties and this was popular with the ladies.” He shimmied a little and promptly burst into laughter.
One. “Rhodey can beat anyone in the world at Mahjong.” Two. “Jane has the nicest handwriting out of all the scientists, possibly ever.” Shot. “Ugh.” Three. “Bruce’s smile can light up a room.” Four. “You’re the kindest person in the world - I will literally do twenty more pushups if I don’t have to drink this stuff.”
“Promise? It’s been so long since I’ve –” He stopped mid sentence, just as Steve opened his mouth to swear at him. The sound of a gun being cocked made them both turn and look at Natasha. “Really? And you all call me dramatic?”
Steve forced out a laugh. “On that note,” he started, and got up to put the bowl away, “I’m going to bed.”
There had been hints, and even half formed thoughts when in between insults and petty arguments, Steve thought Tony was above average. Which, he thought, as he recovered from the train running him over, was complete bullshit. And not only was Tony above average, he was god damn beautiful. Steve just gave up: his mind was a mess, and he figured this was what happened when people survive train trampling. Which was no one. Except for Bucky, but that was falling off a train, and Steve just gave up
When she left them Tony was already on his phone. Bruce made a vague noise, gesturing wildly with his half empty glass. After several failed attempts at words, he nodded and followed her general direction. Once he was far enough, Steve turned and punched Bucky as he promised himself he would.
Tony started walking them towards the door. “I thought we agreed that was our secret.” There was a pause that Steve knew was for dramatic effect. “But yes, with the nice blueberry jam.”
But now that he’s alive when Steve isn’t, it feels a million times worse. He hears Steve’s laugh ring in his ears, over the background of despair and chaos below him. He hears Steve’s moans and pleas and whispers. He hears Steve’s confession over and over again. He hears the quips they exchanged and the smile that accompanied them only minutes before.
Steve couldn’t say no to people, Bucky always called him out on it. It was a weakness Steve was aware of, and it was easy to exploit if one knew what to look for. But his pilot looked trustworthy, and Steve was already there so what would ten more minutes be. So he nodded and got out.
Steve sighed. “I honestly doubt that, but I’m not going to discuss this now.” Or ever, if he had his way. Bucky would push, because Bucky knew how he got, but Bucky was safe. Back home was safe, in his room where he could hide and fake sleep for the foreseeable future.
The second thing he noticed were the thick ropes that held his arms back and securely tied to dark wooden bedposts. He tried wiggling them, but there was no room. Then he tried pulling at them, but they wouldn’t give. Steve’s heart sank. He dreaded looking down, but braced himself and was relieved to see the body he was used to. Missing a shirt.
Steve tried really hard not to be embarrassed by the video. He was clearly visible in the back, gentle smile on his face and an expression he could only class as loving. His saving grace was that he occasionally looked at Natasha the same way, but it was more than clear his heart eyes were for Tony. Perhaps the man wouldn’t see it – he was often uninterested in watching things sent of their various group chats.
Tony turned to look at him for a long second before patting his shoulder and pointing towards something. “Come on, let’s get Natasha. I left her talking to a ringmaster, if we’re not careful she’ll run away with them.”
Steve handed him the riffle with a small bow. Psychotic break or not, he cherished every non-conflictual interaction with Tony. He watched as Tony assessed the situation carefully over the top of his sunglasses, then proceeded to shoot every single target row the master gave him. It was done methodically, a clinical detachment that Steve shouldn’t find appealing, but he did nonetheless. The calculated look, the stance, the taut muscles; absolutely beautiful, Steve thought.
I'm not entirely sure where this rant is coming from, no one's come after me to scold me for doing this or that, but I do get in my head sometimes (much like Steve does), and when that happens I get paranoid and so on and so forth.
The taste was identical, but the way it was being fed to him made Steve’s cock twitch. He sucked Tony’s fingers unhurriedly, licking in between them, flicking his tongue on the skin connecting them at the base. He enjoyed the calloused fingertips pressing on his tongue and the way Tony moaned when he took them down to his throat, fighting not to gag.
He’d planned for this, so when he shook Tony awake he ducked, careful not to spill coffee all over the bed.
He felt small, in a way he only felt before the serum and whenever he did something wrong. He felt cold, a fraction of what freezing all those years before was like. He felt like he wanted to be protected. He tried focusing on something else, anything else. There would be the right time and place for over analysing this entire interaction. For the moment, Steve was forcing himself to not do any of that. Perhaps he could steal the jet and run away. He’d get maybe an hour alone before they’d descend on him like vultures and drag him back into their shared home. As he distinctly avoided locking eyes with Tony, he noticed something in the far back, on a shelf.
“Of course I was listening, you stomped in and started scolding the shit out of me. I’ve been hard since I first realised you weren’t actually really mad at me, not like I feared.”
There was a sharp poke between his shoulderblades just as he was bending to rearrange some plates. It didn’t hurt, but it was uncomfortable enough to make him turn and look up.
It was Tony’s turn to snort slightly. “Yeah, I know exactly how that feels.” They were quiet for a while. “Anxiety is horrible, Steve. But again, if you wanna talk about it, I’m here. Up to you, soldier.”
Steve thought he looked adorable, with the frosting smear still on his cheek. Without thinking, he reached up slowly and gathered it on his fingers, eating it greedily. Tony was still, watching him. “Can I?” Steve asked, pointing to the cupcakes. Tony nodded, humming his approval. So Steve picked one up, biting half in one go, the flavours exploding in his mouth. “Oh my god!” He was talking with his mouth full, speech muffled by the dessert.
“Oh, you mean my added presence in this room didn’t cure your boredom? Are you not entertained?” Steve asked mockingly.
The music changed to something more familiar to Steve; Bucky stopped by his side on his way to the dance floor. “Watch this,” he told them with a shit eating grin. He quickly grabbed Darcy and pulled her close. Steve groaned again.
He methodically cleaned the entire workspace Tony had used for the cupcakes, foam-wipe-rinse-wipe-move on until his hands were pruney. By the end of it, he was neither more calm, nor less anxious. He had, instead, resigned to always be a pitiful moron who had broken down in front of Tony, and who’d embarrassed himself beyond redemption. How could he ever wipe the shame of being
They hugged two more times before Steve heard the door lock behind him. His heart was heavy with the feeling that he would never see her again. It was her age, and also a first hand experience of losing people he cared about. It was emphasised by his job, and the way some of his teammates were more vulnerable than others. And while the thought occurred to him before, it was just in light of this that he acknowledged that perhaps Tony was just as affected by these thoughts. Sure, Steve had benefitted from the serum, and he was hard to take down, but to someone who had lost people before, this was not a factor. For Tony, whose parents were dead, whose friends betrayed him, who lost civilians before, this was not a factor. Steve had put himself in danger, and yes he could survive a lot more than the average person, but he could also die, and at the end of the day that’s what stuck with Tony. Tony, who had such difficulty showing his positive emotions; who relied on sarcasm, quips, and insults; who may or may not have flirted with Steve as a joke; who felt was responsible for the entire world and then more.
He had made it clear to himself that it was not a competition on who came up with the best date ideas. He entertained the thought for a while, but it came with a toxic layer that he could not and would not enable. So he was simply putting a bit of effort into a date night with the ever-present hope that nothing would come up and ruin it.
Clint approached him at lunch a couple of days before with a smile (first sign of trouble), a notepad (signs two-to-five of trouble), a pen (!), and confetti on his shoulders. Steve nearly turned around and walked away. He might have looked young, but he was starting to think he was essentially an old man – what was that line in the film? Too old for this shit?
“I swear to god,” Darcy said and lifted her head to kiss Bruce again. The warmth in Steve’s chest was back, and maybe he wasn’t dead inside yet. She broke their kiss again, and stayed glued to Bruce’s side as she walked them away. “Thanks, Steve, you’re the best!” she said loudly, and Steve wanted to duck. Everyone who heard her turned to look at him.
“But I want to know,” he pouted, kissing the top of Steve’s cock playfully, smacking sound and all. He took the head back in his mouth, inching down slowly. When Steve was still nonverbally enjoying himself, he groaned, the vibration echoing throughout Steve’s veins, all the way to his brain and back into his hard cock.
“Knowing you, it’s something outrageous and –” Tony’s face fell a little. “Shit. I meant it as a joke, Tony.”
Saturday seemed as good a day as any. He’d received the much awaited text regarding his order first thing in the morning. It put a spring in his step, getting him through making breakfast and an endless video conference with some folks from the Navy. All he could think about was the damned parcel.
Tony had jeans on, Steve noticed, his blood racing with appreciation. Denim blue, thick denim. They showcased his strong thighs, leading to –
To Steve’s endless frustration, Tony anchored his hips down with his hands. He cupped them under Steve’s heavy testicles, pushing them up. “Tony, please!”
He pulls back immediately. “I missed you,” he whispers. When Steve smiles he has to shake his head to clear it. “Okay, okay, I’m ready. What do your elf eyes see?”
Bruce sat next to him, and if Steve were to choose, the man was probably his safest bet. With his kind eyes and gentle demeanour, at least he wouldn’t get chewed for being less than subtle. Steve handed him the bottle and they shared it between them in companionable silence. When Bruce pulled a second one from seemingly nowhere, Steve nodded his thanks.
Tony smiled at him, the beautiful smile that could melt Steve’s insides. He rubbed his cheek on Steve’s inner thigh, making him shake with the way his facial hair tickled. “And what do you want to see me do, darling?” Tony slowed down, expecting an answer.
“Nonsense, don’t worry about it. We all have our demons and we all deal with them the best we can.” He poured batter in a cupcake tray and Steve wanted to hug him forever. “I do think you should consider talking to someone. We can screen them, I can write an algorithm to match you with someone suitable. It’s ultimately up to you. I’m not gonna make you go talk to a therapist, but you can’t be surprised if I’m gonna keep a closer eye on you.”
awkward. I mean, we do, cause I’m ancient and you fidget a lot, but,” and he kissed him, “but whatever it is, good or bad, you can tell me. Now or when you’re ready.”
It dawns on him, a sign that perhaps he’s closer to being at least a tiny bit in control. A thought that is clear and useful and that he can actually mould. It takes mere seconds and he’s out of the suit, leaving him back with Barnes. And he’s running, the air breathable again, even if his spit is thickened with concrete dust and bile. Bucky could catch him, but Bucky wasn’t cruel and Bucky knew he had to do this.
Steve was not rude. He absolutely wasn’t. In the war he had to gently fend off affection from heart eyes girls who thought he was God’s gift or something. The propaganda machine worked, and they were disillusioned by how the world portrayed Captain America. Steve was terrified of them. He was also not rude, but he was rapidly reaching the end of his patience.
The first moment Steve touched his cock, he was certain he would come. He was high-strung from his little solo play before dinner, then Tony drove him insane without even touching him that much. He was needy and it took all his willpower to not come. He slowly rubbed the head of his cock with his thumb. “You do this to me,” he whispered. “I’m so close to begging, Tony you have no idea.”
Tony pulled back, biting into the massive pile of popcorn on Steve’s lap. “What new things have you discovered, Cap?” he asked slowly.
Tony was on the floor, wearing a Christmas hat and his Christmas sweater, surrounded by children who rallied around him. There was a little girl on one of his knees, and a little boy on the other. They both kept touching his beard and his face, as if to make sure he was real. Steve had a very distinct urge to do the same. Behind him, the tree was revolving slowly, and Steve checked around the room for Wanda. There was no one else there except for Tony and the children. Wouldn’t that be a great band name? Even a great superhero team name.
It was Steve’s turn to burst into laughter. “We could probably make it go viral on youtube or something. We’d get Thor to narrate it. I’d make some snazzy animations for it. It could work!”
“True.” He seemed to deliberate for a minute. “Then I’ll stay up and watch the tv. I’m not tired anyway.”
“Enough to know you’re my favourite!” She walked them back to the coffee table and looked around. “Now, not to seem ungrateful and I’m definitely not eager to see you go in the cold weather, but…”
“I’ll ground you first,” Steve tells him, accusing finger poking at his chest. There’s a shadow of a smile in the corner of his mouth, so he can’t be that pissed off.
Once they make sure the twins were settled in their new positions, Steve turns to Tony. “Can you take me up? We need to reassess.”
Every “darling” and “I got you” echoed in his head, raced through to his heart and settled there uneasily. It felt amazing to be held, to be protected. Steve had always been a tactile person, but circumstances made it so that it had been a long time since it happened. Even more so by someone he had such a connection with.
Tony materialised to their side with two more shot glasses. “He’s an honest guy, Natasha. Of course he won’t let you win.” He downed his and gave the other to her.
Some of the kids looked up and their eyes widened dramatically before they ran up to him. They all stopped just shy of jumping up into his arms, and turned back to look at Tony. “Go on, he’s not gonna get mad at you! Are you kidding me, this is Captain America! You could shoot at him and he’d still hug you!”
“But Steve nothing, it’s probably someone’s pet, have you thought about that? How would you feel if someone took… oh, I don’t know, me –” he paused for the briefest of seconds before he realised what he implied, “– any of us away from you?”
“You know, there is an underlying quality to me. One you all seem to dismiss, and if I’m honest it’s a bit hurtful.”
“What about…” His hand touched Steve’s forehead, prompting his eyes to fly open. He wasn’t aware he’d shut them again. The calloused hand felt wonderful on his skin. “Is this okay?
There was no way to nod without disobeying, so he blinked in response. Tony’s spit in his mouth almost burned him, such was its importance. He hadn’t expected this, but it was most welcome. It was a type of play they’d touched on before. They’d discussed it at length, too. So to have it happen – it was fantastic.  His muscles were tense; not painfully so, but he was hyper aware of them. He did his best to stay still, counting seconds until Tony’s steps returned. Spittle escaped at the corners of his mouth.
Tony was next to him now, whispering above his cheekbone, right next to his ear. Almost touching him. It tickled and burned. “You can come now, my love. As soon as you start I promise, I promise I’ll touch you. You want that, Steve, don’t you? Go on, come for me!”
“Okay, who told you about the car?” the man asked turning around, hands on his hips, something smeared on his cheek.
“I mean, if you did see them it would have to be from way below as you fell to your death,” Steve said with an eyeroll.
“So not in the mood,” he replied and dropped his shopping on an armchair. “How is this so difficult?”
