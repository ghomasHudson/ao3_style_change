"What did he say?"
“She's right in the house,” he responded.
"Dierdre and Kieran."
"Is she going to meet with you?" John asked, knowing that if she was he would have to leave.
"Not even to encourage her to talk to you?"
"When you found out in hospital what the problem was, how did you feel?"
"Lemonade, milk, orange juice, water, and ammonia.  I wanted to use bleach but me dad said that was taking it too far."
"Um," John managed to say, at a loss.  "No," he finally added.  "His brother told me something."  He didn't feel right discussing all of this without Sherlock's permission, even if Lestrade knew from the interview with Phillip what had happened to him.
Once the judge was back in his seat and Mr. Ogbeide was in the witness stand again, Lou spoke.  "You never asked her what she meant by that?"
"The next week, when I had Jennifer with me again."
"Is his mother still alive?  Your husband's, I mean?" asked Jason.
“They’re used to send coded messages.  To spies, presumably, although I don’t think anyone has admitted to running one.”
He shook his head.  "They told me she didn't talk.  No matter who tried to interview her, she just sat there without saying a word each time."
"When does this group meet?"
Peter shook his head. "Married. For a year and a half now." He looked at Dr. Dodson. "She told me therapy is going well."
Only a few minutes after Dr. Dodson came in, Mari walked through the door. A heavyset woman with bright red hair, she had attended the group the second longest. "Peter!" she said as she searched for a chair. "How was Europe?"
John blinked.  "My middle name?"
"But she did tell you something about whatever had happened to her?"
Sherlock decided he did not like being looked down on. The body he was in now was about John's height, so he wasn't very short, but Douglas was at least an inch above six feet.
“Some of it.  Not the whole thing.”
"What is your area of practice?"
"Small Russian girl, long blond hair.  She's been a part of my homeless network for the past year or two.  Doesn't speak much English."  His words were tinged with fury.
"I suppose breakfast is in there too?" she asked.
"I assumed she was in love with him anyway."  Mycroft suddenly turned and headed for the door.  "Forgive me.  It's -" The rest of the sentence was cut off as he shut the door.
"Most of the time when someone comes early there's a crisis.  I live down the street and I make sure to get here a half hour early, in case someone shows up."  When John gave him a puzzled look, Eli went on.  "I'm the elder statesman here.  I've been coming to this group for nine years and some look to me as much as Dr. Dodson."
"Yes.  I knew that it was a bad idea to come to court today but I just wanted to see my boy again."
"That will be fine."  At least he didn't have to make conversation with the man.  He didn't want to sleep, either, but maybe there would be some book he could look at.  Or he could go into the upstairs room and see if that computer could go online.
"That's fine," John said, and turned his back.
"I will."
"As I said before, Sherlock was bored silly for most of the time he was here.  He took a look at the newspaper archives for the past year or so to see if he could solve any of the crimes.  He found a string of murders, all of older, short, dark-haired women.  The police weren't sure if they were connected because the cause of death was different in all the cases, but you know Sherlock.  He found out all he could about them from the paper and from asking questions."  She looked at K's picture again.  "He turned over all the evidence to the police with a description of the killer.  Two days later they knocked on my door and asked for Edwin.  Sherlock knew about the arrest, but he went back to England before the trial started.  The police thanked him and said without that evidence they'd have never found the killer.  He was tried, sentenced, and executed.  It was all fast because he never appealed."
In fact, it was three days later before they were able to talk again.  John had been busy at the clinic and Sherlock was taking an endless set of case notes on his laptop.  When Lestrade contacted them to say the foster children were willing to be interviewed the next day, there was still no conversation, but John knew the silence would be broken the next day.  Even then, the cab ride was silent.
Oh, that hat.  He couldn't escape the damn thing.  "That was just for a picture.  I don't wear it otherwise."
"The court will adjourn for five minutes," he announced.
Lestrade takes John and Sherlock back to the Yard.
"Some times.  Some times it's more like hiding under the bed or the desk."
“Not quite correct.”
"Sherlock Holmes."
John paused with his hand on the fridge door. "Did Victor Trevor ring you today?" Victor Trevor had been a friend of Sherlock's from secondary school, and had been a surprise witness at the trial. He had also been the one to out K to Sherlock's mother. She, rather than being concerned for her son, burned the stuffed bee Mycroft had given him, planned to send him to boarding school, and when Mycroft himself came home she defended herself by saying Sherlock had been "telling horrible lies." She refused to tell Mycroft who Sherlock had been supposedly lying about, and had died a few months later from a stroke.
"Ten, seven, and eight months."
"I didn't think I'd like it as much as I did. But I like how it sounds. Nice and sweet." Another pause, this one longer than before. "You know, we've been talking for a while and you haven't asked me any questions about how I broke my arm yet."
"When did you talk to him next?"
"Did you mother ever say you spent too much time there?"
This was clearly not the answer Harvey had been looking for; she frowned.  "Did you want physical affection from Dr. Martin?"
"Even if you were breaking the law?"
"Dr. Martin," she corrected him.  "You knew that, though.  Remember all those times you went to the clinic with me after school?  I wondered if you'd be a doctor yourself, since you always seemed so interested in my medical books."
"I sit up next to the judge and the solicitors ask me questions."  While her smile didn't return, she seemed more at ease talking to Sherlock.
This time when she grinned it stayed on her face. "Yeah. It's my favorite show. Kieran and Dad like it too but Dierdre doesn't like it. I think she's too little for it."
"No."
"I just want to ask you a few questions, okay?"
"I've got something for you," Phillip said as he handed Sherlock a piece of paper.  "This might help."
"It's been a good week. Almost like before I found out."
"I'm sure people would wonder who I was, but we could both go back to our normal lives until we figured out how to switch back."
"I can't stop thinking about Her," Sherlock said while still looking away.
"Me too," said Peter.
"You know perfectly well that She's not the one who's making this happen."
When he'd heard the first, he hadn't thought anything of it, other than Sherlock was apparently uninterested in sex or romance. As rejections went, it beat "You're not my type" or "I'm straight," (usually said in an offended tone). The second, well, it wasn't too odd to assume that anyone who was uninterested might get the "you're just afraid" response, but the defensive tone had made him wonder, and how Mycroft had just given him a look of disbelief in response. (After all, he had been the one to say "Don't be alarmed," right?) And the third…he certainly hated his brother, but never explained why.
"And there's more." Peter used the same tone he had before. John knew that he and his wife had intimacy issues and hadn't actually had sex, but he hadn't thought of their situations as similar.
"That they suspected she'd been sexually abused."  Mrs. Bena looked away.
Up until this point everyone had sat in silence to listen to the tape. Lestrade broke the silence by blurting out, "What does the poor boy think he did that he'll be arrested for?" Sherlock glared at him sharply in response, and he said no more.
"Yes.  For almost a year."
"We can install it."  He turned back to his mobile.  "Give me my laptop."
The title of the story comes from a book about missing people in the USA, The Last Place You'd Look, by Carole Moore. It seemed to depict the uncertainty in a lot of child abuse cases very well.
"Not one that I can see, but I think it's connected to something.  Something he's remembering, probably."
"The father or Dr. Arthur?" John spoke up.
"Darren's eight, Josie's six, Shane's five, Aubrey's three and Blessing's a year and a half."
"You see," Sherlock said.
"Where do you live?"
"Sherlock's going to help you with that, right?"
"Do you want coffee?  Because I'm going to make some before I go."
"Did your brother find out about it?"
"Do you remember what happened after she rang your mother?"
While this was part of the previous bit, I decided to address it separately. I did not actually plan for Phillip's father to be in the story at all for a while - in my original idea he never showed up and Phillip was taken out of his mother's home by Mycroft getting him into a good boarding school. Phillip's one big difference from Sherlock is that he truly has no one at home to care about him and is both more vunerable to K because of that and at the same time more willing to talk about what's going on then Sherlock because he's got no one to talk to.  Every time I thought about this I kept going back to that if that was the case Phillip would still be as vunerable to predators as he was before. Bringing in his father later came up as a solution, but that took more writing.
"Does she ever go out without supervision?"
"Yes."  John saw him glance to where his family had been seated before continuing.  "Two sisters and a brother."
"What's the bleach for?" John asked as he took off his coat and sat down.
"What did you think he thought?"
"No further questions," Susan said.  She walked to the prosecution's table.
A midnight reunion.
"Yes, but Sherlock here wants to ask you a few questions," Lestrade said. "I'll try to make this easy as possible."
"We're going out to dinner with his best friend and his son."
"Do you think you can at least make it up the stairs?" John asked.
She shook her head.  "I don't think they knew.  I can give you their number so you can ring them up, but there's only Mrs. Forrester and their three kids now; Mr. Forrester died two years ago."
“What did she say?” asked John.
Peter nodded knowingly. "And?" He didn't want to seem to let John abridge.
"Some clothes and my art supplies."  He picked the bag up and opened it.  A bin liner stuck out of the open space.  Phillip reached in and grabbed a few things.  "Here are my colored pencils and my watercolors.  I want pastels but I've never been able to get them."
"She..."  He stopped.  "She, after that said we could kiss like grown-ups and She showed me how.  Between my legs and Hers, with your lips and tongue."  His discomfort was palpable, and John noted that he couldn't seem to make himself say "penis."  "And we did that for a while when I came over.  But when I'd been going there for a few years I said that I loved Her and I'd done that before, because She liked it when I'd pretend She was my mother, but this time I said I wanted to marry Her when I grew up."
"Look, I might only know a lot about airplanes. But even I know who Sherlock Holmes is." If he hadn't seen so much other weirdness by this point, he'd have still been thinking this was some sort of prank of Douglas'.
"Not today."  Just like that, all the anger seemed to have drained out of him.
"No. He just ran out of the house, threw up, and headed home. It eats at him still that he didn't do anything."
"Your dad and your brother are going to testify too.  You know that, right?" Lestrade broke in.
"Several forms of false identification, including one for Dana Lester.  Almost fifty thousand pounds, hidden in various places.  Magazines containing child pornography. Two computers, a desktop and a laptop, containing thousands of pornographic images and videos involving children."  He shut his eyes.  "And a very large collection of photographs of children in various sexual acts.  Most of them are unknown, but several resembled Jennifer Ogbeide-Bena, Moira Aherne, and Phillip Rodgers.  Lestrade was able to identify one other person from the photographs, and he felt I should not work on this case anymore."
"You live on the ground floor?"
When John woke up in the morning, Sherlock was no longer there.  Hamish was also missing and John figured he'd find both him and Sherlock in the living room.  He was right; both of them were on the sofa.  "I have made some inquires about Phillip," he said once he saw John.
Mari was the one sitting next to Jason, so once he fell silent she spoke.  "The birthday went well.  We all had a good time."
Before I came up with anything but the title, I decided the abuser was going to be a woman. Just a lone woman, abusing children because she was sexually attracted to them, no one else forcing her. It almost never happens in these kinds of stories. To the Sherlock fandom's credit, they've actually dealt with it a few times, so points to that. I also decided that Sherlock would have been abused by a woman as well, and he'd be the only one to not assume the serial child abuser was male. Until the big reveal in chapter seventeen, I kept going back to re-read sections to make sure Sherlock was the only one who never referred to the abuser by gendered pronouns (not counting the children). Even some of the commentators would refer to K as "him," which I expected people would do.
"The school is really big.  And the flat didn't have a garden.  The school was so big that I got lost."  She shifted her gaze from Lou to the ground.  "I was too scared to talk to the other kids, most of the time.  They didn't seem to notice me."
"Both," he curtly responded. "Take away your assumptions and there are more places to work with and look in." After that apparent non-sequitur, he walked back towards the counter and started working just like he had before, like there had been no significant conversation in between. If this was a preview of things to come, John was not looking forward to tomorrow. But the die had been cast; there was nothing to do but wait. And perhaps that strange fury Sherlock had shown before would make this somehow work.
He looked again at the photo. Kieran looked a bit like Sherlock, with black shaggy hair, although his was straight. Dierdre was clearly the youngest; she still had a round baby face, surrounded by bright red hair. "That's your dog in the picture?"
"Yes."
"Good morning," she said cautiously in response.  She pulled Brownie closer to her.
"What else happened?"
“So that’s K’s mistake here?”
Moira looked at the folder with wide eyes.  "She really did that much?"
"Thank you." Phillip sounded shy.
"The one who lives with the blogger," Sherlock said in exasperation.
What?  He read it again.  This was saying he was a fictional character.  Not just a fictional character, but one created almost a hundred years before he had been born.  Wikipedia helpfully informed him the complete works of Arthur Conan Doyle were available at Project Gutenberg, so he headed there.  The first story written was apparently "A Study in Scarlet" and that seemed to be a good enough place to begin.
"Did you have particular times you stopped in?"
Once again, sorry for the delay in the update.
"Yes." John seemed a little paler.
While John expected all sorts of unusual tangents in conversations he had with Sherlock, this threw him for a loop.  “I would call social services, for one.  Even if his arm really was broken accidentally, someone clearly intended to harm him.”
"Sometimes," he whispered.
Monday and Tuesday went by both slowly and quickly.  On the plus side, Sherlock didn't even attempt to leave the flat.  He didn't do much of anything else, but he made no effort to try to escape.  Instead he spent hours on the sofa, or in his chair, or even in his bed, staring off into space.  He ate nothing and only drank a few sips of tea or coffee.  He didn't even try to turn the television on.  But he did appear to fall asleep at night.  He only spoke once on Monday, to inform John that Mr. Rodgers had been successful in court that day and Phillip would be going home with him.  For most of Tuesday he didn't say anything at all.
"Your husband," John said.  "I don't know more than that.  Did you hire him?"
"I've never had a chance to have one."
He was almost out the door before she spoke again.  "One more thing.  Even if your flatmate won't talk to a therapist, at least be willing to listen to him if he ever tries to talk to you about the abuse.  Breaking the silence is usually the hardest part."  He flushed - of course she'd known he was talking about Sherlock the whole time - but nodded in understanding before leaving.
"Yes, you're a very brave girl."  He smiled at her.  "Sometimes people are too afraid to talk about being hurt." John wondered if Sherlock meant himself.
I am sorry this is so long in coming. A Million things have come up. I hope to try to update more regularly.
"How?"
"You're afraid of her."  John wasn't being disparaging; he knew why Sherlock felt that way.
"Did you ask him about that?"
"If I don't get PT my legs stay crossed and they might come out of the hip."
"Since you talked to Phillip," John responded.
"You were interested in a relationship with me when we first met," he abruptly said.
"He would have known about the bruises on his thighs.  Possibly he was hoping to pass them off as the result of rough sex."
"I'm a citizen and I was born here, but my mother's family is still in India and as a result I've spent a great deal of time there as well."
"No.  She still hadn't said anything and I thought that if she didn't want to talk about it that much I wasn't going to bring it up."
"She would no doubt be interested in dating you."
"Do you think they were victims?" John asked.
"No."
He swallowed.  “With most teenagers his age, I would give him a quick reminder of the importance of birth control methods.  However, with the fact his arm was broken I would wonder if the two events were related somehow.”
"What happened next?"
"It's been considered, John, and while it hasn't been ruled out since there's no one who she says has done it, but it's not the working theory." Lestrade seemed a bit choked up, and John remembered he had small children of his own. "Whoever did it, he's clever."
"Even though you didn't understand English then?"
This was enough to spur Lestrade into action, and he pulled a sheaf of papers out from a drawer.  "Here is what was taken at the hospital.  As I said, there were translation issues, so I'm not sure how much is reliable." He handed them over to Sherlock and John.
Martin looked down at the floor.  "You don't want to know."
John related to her the events of the last few days, starting with Moira Aherne and ending with the case file and Sherlock's angry brooding. Once he finished, she frowned. "I do remember that boy. He's a big kid, about your height already, but he looks like an overgrown child and not a teenager. He was a sad one, too – I don't think he smiled once."
"We'd talk about things.  She liked it when I showed Her all the tricks Rory could do.  Sometimes She'd give me sweets or lemonade."
"Then why would he be so concerned about you turning him in to the police?"
"Just keep mentioning it," Peter added.
"Was there anyone to play with there?" Lou gently asked.
"You've been given permission by the police to discuss it with her, then?" Lou asked.
Moira shook her head.  "No.  He's got more time because he works for some other people instead of by himself so he doesn't have to do everything."
"You were doing the same things she did?"
"He doesn't want the whole thing to come crashing down on him."
"May I have a word with Mr. Clark?" Harvey said.  Clark reluctantly shuffled over to the defense table.  The two seemed to argue, including furious hand gestures, for several minutes.  Once that was done, Clark went back to the stand and said "No further questions," in a dull tone.
Busy, no other excuse.
"The trial of Dr. Kelly Martin entered its sixth day with testimony from the victim referred to as Victim Ten and his family," the announcer said.   John expected Sherlock to turn off the television, but instead he stared glassily at the screen.   "According to court transcripts from the trial, Victim Ten said that he had been victimized while receiving care at a clinic for the homeless in King's Cross.  He said the accused used a physical disability as the front for weekly assaults and threatened to abuse his younger siblings if he did not comply.  His parents testified that they only heard about the alleged assaults once he was told that the doctor no longer worked at the clinic.  Defense solicitors argued that his physical disability would complicate the alleged acts to the point where they were nearly impossible to do and that Victim Ten had a potential hip dislocation that needed to be carefully monitored.  Dr. Martin is accused of a variety of sexual assaults against fourteen different children going back almost twenty years.  She maintains her innocence."  The announcer moved on to news about Parliament, but that was not enough to break Sherlock out of his trance.  When it continued for almost thirty minutes, John got up out of his chair and tapped him on the shoulder.
"The first one.  I explained the procedure to the victim in hopes of reassuring her."
John could only nod in understanding.  "Look, though, about the two victims that aren't supposed to talk to each other.  Couldn't they meet with you two, or some third party to make sure they didn't talk about the trial?"
"Yes.  You... know about nightmares."  He looked away.
This chapter is really a short bridge towards the rest of the story. I knew Sarah was going to be part of the story, but I didn't know to what extent. Having her be the doctor who examined Phillip at first was my way of doing so, but the more I planned out the story I realized how much she could be used as a character. Even though she doesn't have a big role on the show, I find her character interesting and wanted to explore it.
Susan nodded at Sherlock and walked back to the prosecution's table.  Judge Foster banged his gavel and said "The court will recess for one hour," and Sherlock took a few very obvious deep breaths before he was led off by the usher.
"No," said Phillip.
"It was pretty bad for the two of you last year, right?" Rodney, a man with short spiked black hair with blond tips, asked.
"Mr. George told me to catch up with you.  He'll try to explain everything later."  Victor offered his hand.  John shook it, and Victor spoke again.  "You must be a remarkable person if Sherlock has let you get so close to him.  I'd have never thought he could live with a roommate when I knew him."
Sherlock took a few more circles around the flat before nodding to himself, apparently satisfied with something.  "I don't think there's anything more to be seen here.  Mrs. Murray, I know you said before you have copies of all the starter checks Dana Lester has given you.  Do you have those here right now?"
, he thought before going right back to sleep. When he woke up in the morning Sherlock wasn't there. He looked at the clock, realized that it was past the time the morning papers would be delivered, and immediately went to the sitting room, not even bothering to get dressed. The room was empty, but there were scattered newspaper pages all over the floor and furniture. He looked in the kitchen, but wasn't surprised to find Sherlock wasn't there.
"You're going to help him fight for custody."  It wasn't a question.
“Does he know a last name for K?”
"Are all the victims testifying?" John asked.  They went through the doors and out into the city.
"Quite a few children that have come into care for neglect have later told us about some form of abuse."
"I'll finish the book when we come back. A walk would do us all good even if we don't stop at the gift shop." Mr. Aherne tucked a bookmark inside the book, placed it on the table, and rose from his chair. "I'll be back as soon as I can, Moira," he said. Moira reached out her arms and they hugged. He kissed her forehead, took his children by hand, and walked out of the room into the hall.
"You're still sure we can't have it at the airfield?"
She nodded.  "They're in my flat on the second floor.  I'll go and get them for you."  After a few minutes she returned with a manila folder in her hands.  "This is everything; the checks but also anything else I noticed about my little mystery tenant.  As I said before, I'm not sure it's all on the up and up but the rent was paid every month and the checks never bounce so it's not like I can ring up Scotland Yard and tell them that my tenant only pays me with starter checks."
"Lestrade and Donovan? Why did they call Scotland Yard for an abuse case?" Sherlock's voice was strangely flat, as though he was trying to bite back a flood of anger. Was it because they hadn't bothered to ask him to help them? He really couldn't imagine another reason; Sherlock thought of crimes as puzzles to be solved, not as emotional events.
"Yeah." Her voice was so faint that it was almost inaudible.
"Why did you call me in?" John wanted to get straight to the point.
"I'll always be there," John said firmly.
"Five.  Three brothers, two sisters.  And Mum's going to have a baby soon."
He always signed his emails with that, more to reassure himself about the friendship than anything else. Sherlock knew he needed the contact, but also didn't want to seem as desperately alone as he still felt. He hadn't even mentioned his birthday, also in January, because -
"They've been harsh?"
"Other symptoms?"  She was still relaxed, much calmer than him.  John supposed she had to be.
"I think so.  His mother left him alone this weekend and apparently she's done it before."
"After you left her there, when you came back the next day, did she act any differently?"
"Do you know what he said?"
"Emotional reasoning," Dr. Dodson said. He looked over at Eli.
On Saturday afternoon John, Sherlock, and Lestrade journeyed to the Aherne's flat once more.  Lestrade had come along to show Mr. Aherne some of the more recent photographs, both so he could positively identify any of his daughter and in the faint hope that he might be able to identify some of the other children.  All three of them were silent for the whole trip, which was a blessing.
Although John knew it was important for them to talk, and to talk now, he was not sure where to begin.  He knew Sherlock told some things to Phillip before, but otherwise had not spoken about the bee incident (he still couldn’t call it anything more horrible in his head, even now) to anyone.  Finally he decided to start with a more neutral question.  "When K mentioned a friend of yours she had known, who was she talking about?"  John thought it was good he was sitting beside him and not in front of him; it seemed far less confrontational.
I have no excuse for how late this is other than I've been doing a lot of writing elsewhere.
Mrs. Bena hung her head.  "That hopefully some day she'll find it in herself to forgive me."
“I know She had a camera in her room,” Christine said.  “I’d have to do things to myself and She would record them. Said that either I’d do it when I knew the camera was there or She’d hide it in Her room and I’d never know when it was recording.  But She never made me do anything to my brothers.”
"Fiancé, but you know that," Gloria said.
"Is this group expecting me?" he asked her.
"That is correct. I haven't." Sherlock's voice was level, calm. "Do you want me to ask you about it?"
"I talked to Sarah a few days ago and she said he was a sad child." He didn't expect this comment to be acknowledged, but to his surprise Sherlock nodded sagely.
"This is why I talk to you." Phillip paused. "You understand." Another pause. "And don't tell me I have nothing to be ashamed of, because I know I do."
"Mycroft is talking to you tomorrow," Sherlock said, like this naturally came from what they had been doing before.
“Correct.  He said to others he had sold the house because it was too big for one person.  A few years later, he married and started a family.  Other than those suspicions I could not find that he even interacted with Sherlock.  I also discovered he didn’t let children there without a parent with them.  While I never stopped investigating him, I privately thought he was unlikely to be the suspect.”
Mr. Aherne stared at Sherlock without saying anything for a minute. "Yes," he finally replied. "She'd gone to work; she was a fitness instructor. I can do most of my work from home, so that's where I was. She was pregnant, twelve weeks pregnant. She collapsed after arriving. The doctors said there was nothing that could have prevented it because she hadn't had any of the symptoms."
Sherlock rose into a sitting position. "No, no, no, no no.  I don't.  I swear to you I don't.  Never." He sounded like he was begging.  "I promise I don't want to."
"Last May.  It was after dinner and I was watching the news.  Jennifer was in the room coloring.  The announcer said something about an investigation by the Yard into multiple reported cases of abuse.  They showed a picture of the suspect and Jennifer looked up at that moment and started screaming."  Even now he looked stunned.  "She ran off to her room before I could say anything."
"Oh, we were talking about the - thing Mum and Herc were going to do."  As soon as Arthur said that, someone's mobile rang. It had to be Carolyn's, because she got up and moved towards the door, pulling a mobile out from the bag she took with her.  "Mum said no butterflies.  Only people."  He blinked, oddly enough.
"That's a complicated question," he said, aware he was stalling but truly not sure where he should begin.
“Why did you talk to Mr. Holmes and not the DI?”
"He's so much more cautious around me."
"He couldn't have done much himself," said Dr. Dodson. "In those days it was hard enough for most people to wrap their minds around the idea of incest, much less the idea the perpetrator could be a woman."
"Did the Forresters say anything about why he was away?"
"Did the accused ever tell you a nursery rhyme?" Susan asked, obviously remembering what Jennifer and Phillip had said.
"Why would you want to do that?"
One of the things I felt the need to balance in the story was Sherlock's personal feelings in regards to the case in contrast with his more detached crime-solving nature. This is probably most present in the trial scene with him, but this is where the contrast starts. If he thinks of it as "just another case" he can work more effectively, but at the same time the victims (especially Phillip) stir a lot of emotion that he can't brush away. It's sort of a form of disassociation, but since I don't use that term often in the story he can seem almost chameleon-like.
If they had both really been spies, Mycroft would have undoubtably known more about them, and he was the logical person to contact.  John knew better than to bring this up.  "Anything else?"
"She can stay if the others agree to it," Lestrade said.
"Because She told me to."
"Yes, all the time.  But She wouldn't always want to do that.  I'd have to do a lot of different things to Her before I got a hug at the end."
"I'm your friend.  I have a right to be concerned," John said evenly.
Martin stepped out of the bathroom and into the hall, and then into the nearby bedroom. He self-consiously began going through the clothes in the wardrobe. Almost all of them were made of silk or other fine fabric and looked like the sort of thing that would cost him a year's salary. He finally settled on a white button-down shirt and dark blue trousers that didn't look quite as costly as the other clothes. That done, he headed back to the hallway where the other man was standing. "Come on, I'll bring you into the sitting room." He led Martin down the hall and into a comfortable looking room with two chairs and a sofa. Martin sat gingerly on the sofa. The man took a seat on one of the chairs and said "Well, that proves you're telling the truth. He'd never look so uncoordinated."
"Not intentionally."
"No.  One at a time.  But there was more than one finger when She did."
"Which makes me the second elder statesman, or stateswoman," Mari added.
The sun was starting to rise when Sherlock got through the last of the stories.  He heard an alarm go off in another room.  "Pilot, of course, needs to rise early," he said to himself.  Would the other man make him go to work with him?  He couldn't imagine something more dull than sitting in a plane for hours on end.
"No further questions."  Susan walked back towards the prosecution's table.
"Yes, and I know you are attending it every day.  I was wondering if you could do me a favor?"
John was completely certain that Sherlock could have gone on about this for a great deal longer, but when he heard, "You brought him here, of all places?" and turned towards the sound of the voice to see a very indignant Gregory Lestrade, he was startled enough to not resume what he had been saying. All John could think was that he hoped this would not be considered his fault.
"How old are they, again?" Peter, a man with long dark hair, a beard, and glasses, asked.
"I shouldn't have hugged you without asking first. Me dad does that when I'm sad, though, so I forgot."
"Arthur, get back here and sit until we take off," the woman said.
"And what did you tell him then?"
"Is he still working?"
"Not very well, to be honest.  This trial is hard on him, as I'm sure you know."
Phillip looked up briefly before speaking.  "That.. She asked me if my mum knew where I was.  I told Her that she knew and didn't care.  She said it was horrible when your mum or dad didn't love you.  I liked hearing that.  Because even when I was little I knew Mum didn't love me.  I'd pretend my dad would come to take me away sometimes, but after Mum told me he'd run off and didn't want anything to do with me a bunch of times I stopped that.  She said She could try to do things like a mum would for me."
"Enough," ordered Mr. Aherne. "Both of you find something to do that's not in this kitchen." They scampered into the living room and were soon sitting on the sofa, engrossed in the TV's soft glow. Apparently satisfied, he turned back to Sherlock and John. "Moira's in her room with the dog. It's just down the hall; the door should be open." He gestured down the way. "She will probably want the door to stay open while you talk to her."
"I know. He's just so obsessed with it and he keeps saying he can't give me what I need."
"I hope you're all doing well."
Sherlock was quiet for the whole cab ride, although he clutched Hamish with white knuckles.  However, as soon as he got out at the court, he stumbled on the curb.  "I can't do this," he said as John helped him up.
Phillip went from red to ghostly pale in an instant.  "I didn't."
"I said that before."
Dr. Dodson's presence was enough to make everyone else sit down to wait.  Mari was the next to arrive.  She had such a big smile on her face that even Eli didn't ask her about a crisis.  "Good to see you here again," she said to John.  "A lot of people don't come to the next meeting."
Part of the reason he's smiling here is that Moira is starting to trust him.
To his surprise, Sherlock hadn't just left him behind and was standing at the end of the hall. "Was any of that useful? I'll admit I was wrong about you being too abrasive, but it didn't seem like you got anything to help catch the guy who did this." John wasn't sure if that was the right thing to say, but it came out before he could think about it.
He shook his head.  "She's wealthy; when her parents died while she was in university she inherited all their money.  Her husband was also wealthy and even though she only inherited a portion of his money on his death that was still a significant amount.  She can easily hire a solicitor who could get those charges reduced to a slap on the wrist."  Whatever Lestrade was going to say next was cut off by the phone on the desk ringing shrilly.  He picked up the phone. "Hello?  Oh, good.  We'll set up and meet you in the other room.  You know where it is?  Good, I'll see all of you then."  After setting the receiver back down he turned to face John and Sherlock.  "That was Mr. Aherne.  He's leaving now.  I have to get the lineup sorted.  Do you know where the room is?"
Sherlock trailed off, and Susan finally prompted him with: "What happened then?"
"So you love your daughter, but not enough to prevent her from being prostituted out?"  Harvey seemed more furious than she had ever been before.  John wondered silently if that was because Mrs. Bena was such a good witness or because even Harvey found her crime appalling.
"Not all of them.  Most of them."
"We'll get to that later, then. Mari?"
"Touch her."
"That stage?" John could remember when Harry had been like that in one of her failed attempts at sobriety.
John decided that now was not the time to push the issue.  "All right, I'm going back."  His head was spinning.  Part of him just wanted Mycroft to conveniently vanish K and make the whole stress of more evidence finding and the trial go away.  Even if that happened, though, John knew that nothing that the case had stirred up would go away.  Truthfully, it was a miracle that Sherlock had gone this long without collapsing.  Maybe it was the fact that he was being brought face to face with his abuser as well as living with someone he was clearly interested in a relationship with, sex or no sex. As much as he wanted Sherlock to see a therapist about all this, he knew he couldn't force him.  They were both too far on the rollercoaster at this point to get off.
"No, you would not.  However, that you would might be easier to convince the jury than someone like She would."  Sherlock's mouth formed a tight line.
"Yesterday.  Friday, I mean."
"And you would pretend She was your mother because?"  Sherlock gently asked.
"It's not what you think," Phillip responded, slightly defensively.
"While it might be convenient to blame John for my presence here, this was entirely my idea. Last night he mentioned he'd been involved in a disturbing case where the Yard had been called in, and I told him I was coming here. After attempting to talk me out of doing so he insisted he accompany me as to not cause further trauma to the child." He crossed his arms over his chest. "She asked if I would be coming back, so I assume that nothing of the sort occurred."
"Not really. His brother's living with us now though. He's detoxing. He's really good with our son, which is nice. Not all of it's nice. They talk to each other a lot. Sometimes they both start crying. I think when I'm not around they talk more about their former foster mother."
"Yeah."
"Did she ever explain what those meant?"
"Cocoa for all of us," Christine said, gesturing to her brothers and Gloria.
"Don't worry about it."
“No.  I kept my mouth shut most of the time.  The next time I saw Her She said She was sorry though.  It was a little better for a while after that.  I got to cuddle more and there were no kids or ropes or sticking things in me.”
They went several floors up and she unlocked one of the doors near the lift.  John went into what looked like a typical small office suite – waiting room with chairs and one door leading deeper inside.  She knocked and after a moment Mycroft emerged.  He gestured for John to follow him.
Since there was in fact almost nothing to eat in the flat, John made coffee and as soon as eleven-thirty rolled around, he headed out the door, got a sandwich from Speedy's, and ate it in the cab on the way to the meeting.  When he got there, he saw the Ahernes walking down the street.  They were dressed in a fancier way than normal, so they had probably just left church.  Moira apparently saw him; she waved her hand frantically and ran up ahead of her family.  "Mr. Watson!" she cried out.  "I was going to drop this in the mail but now I don't have to!"
"Shall we go and eat?" John interjected. He wasn't sure if this exchange was going to lead into a fight, but he didn't want to find out.
"K periodically starts checking accounts and closes others.  Doing so enables K to have a constant string of starter checks with no identification on them.  K uses false identification to open and close these accounts, of course, and has probably used that false identification to obtain credit cards in their names.  This also gives K plenty of resources if a victim dares to speak and ample means to flee the country.  All of these things point to some form of independent wealth.  If K had worked for all that money K would still have many demands at the job, even at a position passed on from parent to child or one that was largely a figurehead position."
"Yikes," said Tammy.
"Yeah."
"On the mouth.  Lips open, tongue out."  He said it in a monotone.  "Then She asked me about my brother."
"Almost four years ago."
As usual, once he got up to Dr. Dodson's office, someone was already there. Eli, the group's self-proclaimed "elder statesman" always showed up before anyone else. Today John was also greeted by Peter, who had apparently returned from his delayed honeymoon in Europe (the first one had been delayed by some sort of hospitalization of his wife).
Sherlock opened the can and downed the pills with a large swallow of the soda.  He rested his free arm on his bee.  He looked exhausted and John wondered if he had slept at all that night.  For a few minutes all he did was take large gulps out of the can.  Once he was done he set the can down on the table, making a metallic clank.  "I can't get the taste out of my mouth," he said.
Sherlock's only response was a grunt of acknowledgement.
So the roller coaster begins.
"No. It would have happened anyway." Sherlock sounded like he didn't quite believe that. Of course it was probably the truth, and he knew that factually, but he hadn't convinced his feelings otherwise.
If Sarah was annoyed at not being given all the details, she didn't show it. "It's not very busy, so I can let him go for the rest of today. I hope you can get to the bottom of whatever this is." She ducked out of the room and the Yarders and John left the clinic and headed up to the wards above.
"I understand," said Sherlock, although John had no clue whether he really meant it or not.
"And what happened after that?"
"Even the males?"
"G-E-N-E."
"That She - whoever did it - was just mean and liked to hurt me.  And it wasn't like that at all."
"I'm next if we're going by age," Graham said.  He clearly wanted to sound strong, but his voice wavered.  "You already know what it was like at first.  I thought living with Her was going to be all right.  Until one day.  There was a big bookcase in Her room with all sorts of books and magazines.  The other day She had gotten me a football magazine and I couldn't find it, so I went to see if it was in Her room.  I couldn't find it and was about to look someplace else when one magazine fell on the floor.  I picked it up to put it back on the shelf and then I saw it was a girlie magazine.  I'd seen them before but hadn't looked at one close up.  When I'd gone through a few pages She came in the room and asked me if I was having fun.  I figured She'd get mad at me but She said that I was just interested like everyone else.  Then She asked if I'd seen anyone naked like that in real life.  I said my sister and brothers and my dad.  She said anyone besides my family and I said no.  Then She asked if I wanted to see someone else.  I said yes before I could think about what I was saying and the next thing I knew She had taken Her blouse off.  There wasn't - She didn't have a bra on.  I couldn't help but look, and I really hadn't seen something like that before."  As he spoke, his face turned red.  "I just looked, and She said I could look all I wanted.  After a few minutes She put her blouse back on - She never took off her skirt - and left the room with the magazine.  I went downstairs then and found the football magazine on the couch.  For a while I couldn't stop thinking about how I'd done something wrong, even though I didn't know what it was."
John shivered.  He had seen those jurors, and although he already knew that you couldn’t tell that from looking at someone, he still couldn’t believe he had been fooled.
"I do."  Even though the question was easy to answer, Phillip still shrunk back in his chair.
"Why not?  You knew he was working with the police to find this person."
After that, an uncomfortable silence fell between the three of them, and they did not talk as they took the lift down to the ground floor and headed towards the exit. Donovan did tell him "Thank you anyway, John," before they separated, and John was left only with his thoughts as he hailed a cab and headed home. It seemed like a very long ride.
"That was all he said?"
John yanked away his hand. "Sorry."
"I wasn't planning on it." Sherlock took a good look at the man again. Mid-fifties, divorced three times, two children from different marriages. Currently in a serious relationship with... Oh, why hadn't he seen it before? He was in a relationship with whoever was typically in this body. That was why he was so sharp with Sherlock - he hates having to look at a lover and somehow see a stranger. And he fears that the situation might be permanent. Sherlock didn't see any reason to think that - if they'd been able to swap in the first place, they'd be able to switch back some way. If it wasn't anything they'd done and was rather on some third party, that would complicate things, but it would all be sorted out somehow.
"Ten years ago or so. They've checked out all the past offenders in the area, and apparently they've all been ruled out. None of the victims have talked – in fact, they all insist nothing happened. Whoever it is, he's got a real hold on all of them."
"What happens after I testify?"
"Not after only six months. No."
"Sort of."  It was as diplomatic as he could make it.
“And how is that going to help us?”
"She would send the pictures to Mycroft."  From the brief look of surprise that crossed Sherlock's face, John guessed that wasn't what he had intended to say.  Fortunately, he didn't try to run away again.
"Why?" asked Harvey.
"He probably smells this." Papers rustled.
"What about the starter checks?"  John asked.  Truthfully he wasn't sure they had any relevance at all, but it was such a strange detail it stuck with him.
"It really depends on the case," Mrs. Henderson replied.
"Bad week," he confirmed before sitting down in a chair.
"Did you think you liked it?"
"Tell us what happened."
"In your own words, can you tell me what happened the night of Thursday, February 10?"
"Yes."
"No, they don't," Susan confirmed.
"Lestrade. Good to see you," Sherlock had managed to recover from his surprise and change subjects like this was just some chance encounter between the two of them. "I hope you heard at least some of what I was saying before; I hate to repeat myself."
"Of course I discipline them."  Mr. Aherne sounded offended.  "I don't do that by yelling and screaming or make it so they're afraid to tell me the truth about something.  It's not needed.  Kieran and Moira sometimes tease Dierdre and telling them to stop is usually enough.  If that doesn't work I can just take away time with the telly or pudding.  That never fails."
"They thought that if we met the defense might argue the witness was contaminated."
John nodded in response.  Mrs. Hudson rarely called him by his first name, and the use of it combined with her well-spoken advice was a bit jarring.  He headed upstairs.  Sherlock was sitting on the sofa, a blanket draped over his shoulders.  His bee sat next to him.  All of the curtains were drawn and the room was dark.  Before saying anything, he walked over to the refrigerator and pulled out a can of Coke.  He noticed that there weren't any experiments in there and realized that Sherlock hadn't done a single experiment since this case had begun.  That was enough to make him stop for a minute to compose himself.  Only then did he reach into a cabinet, pull out a bottle of aspirin, and put two in his hand.  He carried the can and pills over to where Sherlock was sitting and set them down on the table in front of him.  "Take these with the Coke," he told him.  "It'll rehydrate you and the caffeine in it will make the aspirin work faster."
"You're listed as both victim and witness.  Any witness not related to the victims can be identified in the press.  Any victim is protected by a court order and can only be referred to by number in the press or related documents.  You are currently covered because your testimony will establish a pattern of behavior.  Unless you want that restriction to be removed?"  Lestrade looked Sherlock directly in the eye.  After a few seconds, Sherlock broke eye contact and looked once again at the paper on the desk.
"Then Mr. George should come to the front to present opening arguments."
Mrs. Henderson thought for a moment before speaking.  "Well, I wasn't present at most of them.  I just dropped her off at the center and picked her up an hour later.  But I did usually talk to her parents before or after the visit."
"I'd rather set myself on fire." And of course after sounding innocent he would say something that revealed how not-innocent he was.
"No, but I saw her give the clerk the money, and I said thank you.  And 'English bad' so she'd know that I couldn't really talk much to her."
“This is Gloria Yellowfox.”  Immediately John remembered the woman who had come in with the Spencer family.  “I know this is forward, but since the trial’s going on…”
He'd never be able to eat if he thought about that. He shoved those thoughts away and made his way to the kitchen. He'd eat a few bites, but space them out. When he got there and sat down to eat, John didn't say anything. Usually if Sherlock sequestered himself in his room he would at least ask "Is everything all right?" Not that he got a response from Sherlock very often, but he asked. In fact, John looked uncomfortable. Was he finally sick of Sherlock's company? Everyone else got tired of it, and didn't stay even if you begged. Hearing about all those things he'd done with Her couldn't have helped matters.
"What She said is not relevant.  I want to know how you tell it."  John could see Sherlock fold his hands over each other and place them in his lap.
"All right." This John looked like he dealt with odd situations all the time, but this was unique. "What were you doing before you woke up here?"
"Are you the oldest?"
"You know that the trial is closed today, right?" John hoped the prosecution would have mentioned it to him, but in the furor it might have slipped their minds.
“Where?”
"I didn't want to hurt anyone else."
"Looking for the boss?" he said.
Sherlock can be intimidating, to put it mildly, and at first I had horrible visions of poor kids traumatized even more by his manner. On the contrary, he was never anything but kind and open to them. And when he talked to them, they opened up. The police were frustrated because none of the victims would admit they knew who had hurt them, but Sherlock knew how to let them tell without being afraid. And the stories they told were not pretty. To keep some privacy, I won't go into what they said had been done. I can tell you the effects, however - children who lived in terror that if they said anything their family would be murdered, ones who were afraid they were the ones who were about to be arrested, children who parroted crude sexual requests to a parent.
“Yeah,” she said in a whisper.
"Is that all you wanted to tell me right now?"  Sherlock's voice was soft.
"Remember when you were a child.  Did you ever doubt that your parents would serve you meals?  Did you ever doubt they'd give you clothes to wear?  Did you ever think they would seriously hurt you?  Did you ever doubt their love for you?"
"Older."
"I can't let K get away with this."  His voice was so quiet John wasn't sure he had spoken for a minute or two.
"This is John Watson.  He's helped us with this case," was Lestrade's clipped response.
"I did a few times. I told him I loved Her."
"She's been on the streets since she was eleven."  Sherlock looked like he could say a lot more, but didn't.
"Because of the poison in the sugar bowl and Rory and his meatball."
The trial wasn't first in the news as John hoped it would be and while the stories that came on beforehand were normally things he'd follow with great interest, he was so preoccupied that he couldn't remember any of them later.  He would never forget what happened after he heard:  "One of the most talked-about trials of the year came to an abrupt end today."  All three of them fixed their eyes on the screen as the reporter went on.  "Kelly Martin was accused of a wide variety of sexual assaults of children, some as young as three years old.  The CPS has released a statement that says a plea agreement has been accepted by the prosecution.  The details of the agreement are not yet known, but prosecutor Lewis George said he was 'very pleased' with the results.  Sentencing information will be released within a week.  She faced up to fourteen years."
He only checked his mobile then, and just as he thought, there was a text from Sherlock.  “Come home as soon as possible.  New clue delivered.”
"I was in the back seat of her car again and she opened the door and took me out.  I was in a park but a different one than before.  I couldn't really walk so she helped me to a bench there and I just fell down on it."  He had lost his earlier hesitation and once again spoke calmly and confidently.  "I lay there for a while but I'm not sure how long."
"How are you?"
"Hi," he said quietly.
Sherlock then came to sit in the chair Mr. Aherne had been sitting in. He took in the framed photograph at her bedside and asked "Is your dog allowed to sleep in your bed, or does he have to sleep on the floor of your room?"
As soon as Harvey asked that, Sherlock visibly snapped back into detective mode.  "All he had were some vague claims that I had said something unflattering about a neighbor.  There were no witnesses, no confirmed statements, and the alleged victim hadn't said anything.  You cannot prosecute someone for what is essentially a rumor."  Obviously he had distanced himself as "the victim," but if it helped him get through the trial John wasn't going to argue with it.  It was at least good to see him act more confident.
Secretly glad for the "we," John nodded.  "Like what?"
For once he didn't bother to make coffee before leaving, just headed out the door and hailed a cab. If he really was going to sit with Dominic and Martin all day they'd most likely be eating together.  John really didn't know either of them well; the only thing he'd heard from them after the interview was at the support group, where Gloria had mentioned Martin now lived with them.  All he could remember were their haunted looks and ragged appearances.  Fortunately the cab driver didn't try to chat, so he could be along with his thoughts.
"So you didn't make any friends?"
"Because they were pictures of you," John said, feeling sick even though he had known what they were before he even asked.
Mr. Aherne arrived twenty minutes later with all three of his children in tow.  John was reminded of his comment that he'd sleep with a knife in his hands before letting K get at his daughter again.  He must have looked surprised, because Mr. Aherne said,  "I'm not leaving them with anyone else again.  Not for a long time," as he came through the doorway.  Moira was right behind him, clutching her bear.  Her whole face lit up when she saw Sherlock, and she came to stand right next to his chair.
"Last time I saw him he was throwing up in the bathroom," Susan replied.  "He asked me to leave him alone."
Harvey deflated like a balloon.  "No further questions," she said with a sigh.
She shook her head.  "No.  Me mum and me dad were both in care when they were little, so there's just us."
"Our advantage is that K does not know at this time about the investigation, or the flat would have been vacated.  K washes the bedding on the one bed every time a sexual encounter occurs so no forensic evidence is left.  The fact that something like that is still going on, even after the incident at the Aherne's, indicates that K is confident no one will talk or has talked."  He now had both hands in a white-knuckle grip on the folder.
"Yeah," Phillip said.
John assumed this had something to do with collecting the records of K's victims.  "I think I know what you're talking about," he said reassuringly.
"Touched.  Just a bit.  I was just curious what it felt like.  She said I was a naughty boy, but She laughed when She said it so I knew She didn't mind.  Then I sat down on the sofa and She gave me a kiss."
"Are you going to make me eat that?" he asked, looking at the frying pan with distaste.
"I suppose I'll see you then," he said.  Susan nodded and walked back towards the room Lou was in.
"I'd pick Her over you!" Sherlock all but spat out in his fury.
"Oh, you like dogs?  Brilliant!  We can build the obstacle course!  I saw it on the telly!  They have poles and a tunnel and this bridge thing!"
"Different things."
"But you didn't tell him who did it."  Harvey stared directly at his head as if that would make Phillip look up.
"When you got there what happened then?"
"Anything might be a clue."
"You've seen the coverage of the current case."
“Yes.”  His eyes darkened.  “I am sure you recently saw the news headlines about someone we both know.  It may interest you to learn that several jurors, before the trial, received inheritances from recently deceased relatives.”
"Yeah."
"I knew a little, but not enough to really talk to other people."
"Do you know why she left the position?"
Lou paused to answer his mobile.  "Hello?  Good, I'll tell them that."  He put the mobile away.  "I think that you three should go," he said.  "Susan's on her way."
As soon as he walked through the door, Mrs. Hudson called out "I didn't expect you home this early."  She headed into the hall, looking anxious.  "Sherlock rang me to say his testimony was over and not to expect him tonight."
"I can't give you what you need."
"Not feasible."  Sherlock's tone made it obvious he considered the conversation closed.  He turned around and put his head back on Hamish.  In a few minutes he was asleep again.  John suspected his fatigue came from his cocaine usage.  Whatever caused it, he didn't stir again until John made dinner.  Even then he only ate a few bites before heading upstairs again.
I've disabled comments for obvious reasons, but I hope you can think about those children today and think good thoughts for them, in hope their futures will be better than this past.
Moira went even more rigid, if such a thing were possible.  Her eyes widened.  After a moment of silence she whispered: "The park near our flat with the play yard."
"How many children have you fostered?"
"Nightmares."  Another word that echoed in the air.
"Do you have a particular preference as to where you would like to eat?" Sherlock said before he could leave the room.
The woman gave him an exasperated look.  "Not everything at the airfield is a business expense."
"Both," Moira said, looking away as she spoke.  At first John wondered if she knew what that meant but remembered Mr. Aherne's comment at the beginning of the case (it seemed so long ago) about answering those questions as they came up.  He figured that a child like Moira, who was so interested in science, wouldn't have settled for vague slang terms.  He was also glad Sherlock could carry on with the questioning; he couldn't think of anything to say at all.
Sherlock scanned the first sheet.  "He didn't know street names."
"I pretended to be ill and stayed home from school.  Then I went to Sherlock's house.  I thought about telling my parents or even the police, but I didn't want to break that promise I had made.  I thought it would be the easiest to just tell his mother, like I had said he should.  So I went to her house and knocked on the door.  She took one look at me and asked what I wanted.  I asked her if she knew Dr. Martin, and she said she did, that one of her son's was friends with her.  I asked her if he spent a lot of time with her, and she said yes.  Then she asked if he'd gotten himself hurt again, and I said 'not really' and then I told her that she'd been assaulting him for years and I didn't think he should spend time with her anymore."
He must have noticed Martin's hesitation.  "I can get something else."
"I rang Sarah and she's going to give my number to Dr. Arthur, so he can get in touch with us," he tried this time.  Still no response, and John felt a twinge of unease.  "Sherlock?" Nothing. "You don't have to do this all at once,” he added.  "You're allowed to take a few days off."
"Oh."  John took in a sharp breath.  It made sense from the prosecution's perspective, of course.  Considering the defense was keen to blame Sherlock any interaction between him and a witness might jeopardize the case.  But it was also very clear that both Phillip and Sherlock benefited from their friendship.  Sherlock was essentially Phillip's first friend, and Phillip looked up to him.  Their shared experiences and mutual love of music cemented it.  "That's going to be hard on him.  He admires you."  If he phrased his concern as being about Phillip it might be easier for Sherlock to digest.
“What would happen when those other children came there?”
"Do you mean you don't know if what you did was a crime, that you don't remember if you did commit a crime, or that you're not sure if someone else will say you committed a crime?"
Sherlock didn't say anything more; he merely finished his coffee and went back to lying down on the couch.  After John finished his coffee, he said "I'm off," and ducked out the door.
"Yes it does."
"Yes,"  Mrs. Henderson said with a sigh.  "Mrs. Bena was not always fully there.  The supervisor wrote down that she'd fall asleep in the visits at times.  Mr. Ogbeide seemed more alert, and more concerned.  He'd ask about specifics with Jennifer, made sure I knew what foods she liked, what time she went to bed, how much light she needed on when she fell asleep.  He'd bring food from home, too, since the visits are usually for dinner or tea.  Homemade things they'd heat up.  Mrs. Bena brought burgers, fish and chips, takeaway type things.  He also rang the police several times.  He wanted to know about the investigation into Jennifer's abuse.  Of course Mrs. Bena got arrested a month later and that stopped those visits."
"Well, one of them was an elderly couple.  The wife died and the husband moved to assisted housing right after I started there.  Two others were in the process of moving out at the time.  They put their keys in my mail slot, since all the paperwork was done, and that was that.  And of course there was the mystery tenant in 102."
Sherlock gave a half-nod and looked back at Moira.  “How long was K in here?”
"Why then did you make the assumption that it was of a sexual nature?"
After two cups of coffee that morning, John wasn't thirsty in the slightest, but to his amazement he was now starving.  He reached into the bag and took out a bagel and an apple pastry.  In a few short minutes, he had devoured both.  Everyone else reached into the bag and took out bagels and pastry.  Despite her petite stature, Susan ate three pastries and a bagel that looked like it had chocolate chips in it.  Lou was the one who took only half a bagel (he gave the other half to Lestrade).  Only when every crumb of food had been finished did Susan speak again.  "You should probably go get a seat in the courtroom now, John.  With a case like this there's going to be a mad rush for seats and you don't want to sit right behind the buffalo."
John decided that he'd come downstairs again after twenty minutes or so; plenty of time for both Phillip and Sherlock to talk and still be there when Mr. Rodgers arrived.  So he sat upstairs and waited.  Once the time had passed, he went downstairs again.  Phillip and Sherlock were still on the sofa, but Phillip had moved closer to Sherlock, almost leaning on him.  His eyes were red.   "You can stay down here now," he said when he saw John.
"That's true," John responded.
Of course, when he got to the room and shut the door, Martin suddenly had no desire to read.  He had even less desire to go back into the sitting room and make awkward small talk, so he just flopped down on the bed and stared at the ceiling.  He might know why the Comet failed so often in its first years, or the instrument panels of  sixteen types of aircraft, but he had no idea how to solve this.  Eventually he fell into an uneasy sleep.
John had no idea what to do; he merely stood speechless in front of the two of them.  Sherlock seemed to have some idea, however, and put a hand on Phillip's shoulder.  "Were you at the Yard today?" he said gently.  Phillip nodded.  "And they had you look at a lineup?"
"Tired.  Not just tired like you want to go to sleep, but my arms and legs felt heavy and my head was fuzzy."  The symptoms clicked in John's head and he knew then Sherlock had been right about what he'd confronted Dr. Arthur with; it sounded like he had indeed been drugged with a benzodiazepine. K had probably put it in his drink when she had opened it.  He wondered if she was hoping the drug would cause anteretrograde amnesia like they often did or was just counting on his lack of English skills to keep him from reporting it.
"Yes, relatively."  He smiled.  "We've gone back to church, as you can see.  I fell out with God after Nora died.  Now it seems the right thing to do.  The priest there is good with children.  Not that I let anyone be alone with them anymore, you understand."
Unbidden, another image came to mind.
"No.  I came back myself."
"Phillip, you've done a lot of good work today. I would like to talk to you again if that is all right."
"February last year.  Dad and Mum couldn't get enough money for work."
"He's not going to testify," said Lou.
Once he had finished his tea, John headed back upstairs.  He rang Sarah to say that he thought the trial would be wrapping up soon and he hoped to get some shifts again, and then spent a quiet evening by himself.  He texted Sherlock once to say that he hoped he would be back home soon, but predictably got no response.  He wondered if he should sleep in Sherlock's room in case he  came back, but instead he walked up the stairs and made himself fall asleep in his own bed.
Jennifer is cross-examined, and her mother testifies.
He kept his back turned until Sherlock said quietly: "You can turn around." He was wearing pajamas, long ones John had never seen before, and the mattress was bare.  The sheets were piled on the floor.  "You first," he said, and John lay down on the side.  Sherlock climbed into bed as well and lay down close enough that their heads were touching but so Hamish was close enough to his chest that their lower bodies couldn't easily touch.  He pulled the blankets over himself and said, "Good night, John."  While he had planned to stay awake until Sherlock fell asleep, the truth was he fell asleep shortly after climbing into bed and never found out if on that night Sherlock slept at all.
"He and me mum didn't have any parents growing up. They were both in care."
"No.  She said She'd looked it up."
"Why are you asking?" she responded without blinking.
"I'm sorry," John said, not knowing what else to say.
"Yes, and he left a unbearably polite message." Sherlock practically spat out the words.
"I know," John responded.
Mr. Aherne actually laughed, although it seemed driven by nerves.  "No, they don't.  Dierdre's got the sewing room as her room.  It's tiny but she doesn't mind at all.  She'd rather play where everyone else is anyway.  Moira likes to be by herself at times."
They started towards the lift.  As they were waiting, John commented, "I hope you were recording that conversation with Dr. Arthur, just for the record."  Sherlock grinned wickedly and reached into his coat pocket, pulling out the same tape recorder he had used for Moira's questioning.  Suddenly all this seemed hilariously funny, and John burst into peals of laughter.  Sherlock looked at him for a second before starting to laugh himself.  It was a relief to have something to laugh about.  John was glad for anything that diffused the horrible nature of the crime, and Sherlock more than anyone else needed something to laugh at.
"I don't know."  He sighed.
"Yes," John replied.  "I won't be testifying though."
As soon as Lou turned to the prosecution's table, Judge Foster banged his gavel and said, "The court will adjourn for one hour."  The crowd appeared to be in a special hurry to leave.  John scurried out with the rest of them.  After hearing all that, he needed fresh air (as fresh as any air in London could be).  Once he was actually out of the courthouse, he was seized by fatigue and spent the next hour sitting on the steps, trying to blank his mind.  He wasn't surprised when it didn't work.
When he fell silent Susan prompted: "Go on."
"At least it wasn't your dominant hand. It's hard enough being left-handed, and being forced to use the other arm wouldn't be much fun." Sherlock had adopted a similar tone to the one he used when sharing his deductions, but instead of the faint air of superiority he usually used, he was matter-of-fact like Lestrade had been.
He dodged the question.  "Somewhat.  If you add no-strings-attached sex to that, the total is probably quite a bit bigger.  Medical students like to party."
"Was there a point where you noticed her behavior was starting to change?"  Lou sounded as relaxed as he usually was, but that didn't stop Mr. Aherne's face from blanching.
While John wasn't sure this was the best time to question Sherlock about the case, he felt that starting a conversation would at least prevent one of his silent moods.  "K took Moira to her flat, like she did with Phillip.  But she let Moira see where it was; she didn't tell her to keep her eyes shut the whole time.  Why is that?"
"Does everyone stay?"
"She started asking me a few questions about my family and my brothers and sisters and where we lived now."  Another twitch.  "I told Her about them and the motel we were in then."
"Knapp-Shappey."
"Daddy's always nice to me even when he makes me eat my vegetables.  Mummy didn't make me do that but she was nice too, except she slept a lot."  John guessed the reason Debra Bena slept a lot was because of her drug addiction.  He did feel relieved that apparently the drugs hadn't turned her violent or horribly neglectful, so Jennifer's memories of her would be positive.  Of course there was still the horrible shadow of what she'd agreed to in exchange for the drug money.
"Yeah."
"How old were you then?"
"Maybe that's behind his worry now?"
"I desired something caffeinated," he replied without looking away from the screen.
It finally dawned on John that Sherlock was so overwhelmed by the trial that he couldn't even make the simplest decisions.  "You don't have to eat anything."
"What happened then?"  Susan glanced at K briefly before returning her gaze to the witness stand.
"He had always been fascinated with them, and in town there was a store that contained almost every kind of stuffed toy imaginable. I told him every time he saw it he could think of me. At the time, that seemed to make him happy." He shifted his glance again, from the window to his lap. "When I came home from school on the summer holiday, my brother had… changed. Not in any way I could really define. He was quieter. Not as bold, not asking questions, not following me around chattering. I'll admit I didn't notice this myself, not in a conscious way, until I noticed he had a book about insects I had never seen before. I was sure our mother hadn't given it to him, and I asked him where he got it. He told me that he had found it. Obviously this wasn't true, but he got so uneasy when I asked I didn't press him further. But that was what made me notice he had changed."
"I did."  He nodded.
"How old are you?"
"He was holding his right arm to his chest.  He had a black eye as well.  Boys his age roughhouse a lot, so that sort of thing doesn't alarm me on its own, but he hadn't mentioned it on the intake form.  Before I looked at the form I asked him how he hurt his arm."
"Do you work outside the home?"
"What's so mysterious about this tenant?"  Sherlock inquired.
"Well, right now I'm back at Bart's to collect some things Sarah saved for me, and if you can be there in an hour or so I suppose I can speak to the both of you."  The fact Dr. Arthur had addressed him by title but had referred to Sarah by her first name was not lost on him.  There could be several reasons for that, but John felt it was probably the old failsafe reason "he's a sexist git".  That would explain why Sarah apparently held him in such low regard.
"Not always."
"Well, last night there was an incident..." John began, and before he knew it he was telling the group the whole story. And the whole group sat there and listened, and that broke the floodgates and then he was talking about the drunken kiss and the flashbacks and the knife to the sheets and Hamish the bee and how it was obvious that Sherlock wanted a relationship with him but just as clear he couldn't make himself be intimate. When he finally stopped, he looked at the clock and realized he'd been talking for over twenty minutes. John then looked back at the group and none of them looked surprised. In fact, Peter and Mari were both nodding sagely.
"I'm glad I'm not in there now," Martin said with audible relief.  Dominic looked away, like he didn't want to hear anything about why they were there.
"How many relationships have you been in?"  Sherlock was clearly trying to use the detached way of questioning that he used on cases, but there was a clear note of emotion.
A visit to the Aherne's.
"No," he said simply. "There were several people who had lived in the immediate area for some time, and several also moved around the time of our mother's death. Sherlock insisted he had no idea what she was talking about. Our relationship has been so strained for so long I have never asked further. That is why that bee is my greatest failure."
John couldn't have been asleep for more than an hour when he heard what sounded like the doorbell.  At first he thought he'd imagined it, but no, Sherlock was awake as well.  "The door," he said.
Sherlock starts to testify.
"She told me to take my clothes off and lie on the bed with him.  I did, and She said that he'd really like it if I kissed him on his penis.  I didn't think he would, since I didn't like it, but when I didn't do it right away She said that if I didn't She might not want to be my friend anymore.  So I did it.  I could hear a camera click while I did it.  I'd seen her taking pictures of us before and..."  He turned away from the microphone and said something to Lou.  Lou motioned to the judge and he spoke.
"That'll be at least a few weeks," John said.  "I know they're trying to get all the others to testify first."
"You're hungry."
His face wrinkled in thought.  "It's a hotel.  I don't remember the name."
"When did you start seeing her?"
"Yes.  Frank had just left for work when I got the notice from the local caseworker.  She rang me to say there had been a girl who'd been taken from hospital to care and she wanted to know if we could take her.  We hadn't had a foster child for over a month, so of course I said yes.  A few hours later they brought her to our house.  Once she got here I knew why they wanted us to take her - Frank is Jamaican and we've fostered many children of dual heritage like her."  Mrs. Henderson paused, clearly remembering something.  "She was horribly upset.  Crying, saying she wanted to go back to her mummy or her daddy.  I learned from the worker who brought her that she'd been taken straight from hospital and she didn't have anything other than the clothes she came in, so that made sense."
"Touch the girl?"  Sherlock nodded.  "Where were you supposed to touch her?"
"Yes, the tragedy of a rich old man who rewrites his will to leave all his money to the airdot that's kind enough to fly him to his rugby game, because he doesn't want to leave it to his wife.  Positively Shakespearean," Douglas said dryly.  He shot Sherlock a look that was presumably loaded with meaning, but since Sherlock hadn't met him until today, he couldn't tell precisely what the look was supposed to mean.  Fond exasperation, as far as Sherlock could infer from his body language.
Before John could say anything, Rodney spoke up. "And I'm sure he loves that other person. He has to; otherwise he can't rationalize any pain he was caused."
"Feet?"
"Not all of it."
“She said, 'Fuck me.'  I said to her, 'What?'  Children pick up all sorts of phrases they don't know the meaning of, and that's what I thought this was.  So she says it again.  I sat down on the edge of the bed because I thought I might pass out.  Jennifer crawled into my lap and said, 'Please fuck me.'  My whole body was numb but I managed to ask her what she meant.  She took a few of her fingers and pretended to jam them up between her legs.  'Like my friend does,' and she looked at me like I had to know what she was talking about. That's when I picked her up and told her we were going for a ride.”
"I didn't notice," Sherlock said, suddenly no longer relaxed.
"John?"
"It was a few months ago.  I think it was right after the new year.  It was late in the day and Moira'd gone to the park a few hours ago and me dad said to walk down there and bring her home before she froze to death.  So I walked down there and she was sitting on one of the benches with this lady I'd never seen before.  I was going to yell at her to come home but then that woman got up to leave and kissed her."  He scowled.  "Not like how me dad kisses us, on the cheek or the forehead.  On the mouth, like you see in those silly romance movies."
again and again.  Of course he wasn't that fortunate; the cab driver went on and on about the trial until they got to his destination.  He had several ideas about why K was being falsely accused, amongst them the former foster children wanting to sue and at least two of the fathers having really committed the crime. As John got out, he shoved some pounds at him, pointedly leaving no tip.
John had already heard the whole interview, so none of it was a surprise to him. Mr. Aherne, of course, had not heard any of it. He laughed when the dog came up to Sherlock and Moira and smiled fondly when she offered Sherlock a piece of the chocolate bar he brought her. His eyes widened with the conversation about the fate of the bee, however, and when Moira expressed her fear of her father dying his eyes filled with tears. John half expected him to demand they stop the tape at that point, but he didn't say a word. He briefly smiled when Sherlock told her that she didn't have to say the person's name or what they looked like, but that melted off his face with Moira's account of her trip to the park. The "'Are you a boy or a girl?'" line caused him to audibly sob, and tears streamed down his face for the rest of the tape. When it clicked off he had buried his face in his hands, muffling the sounds of despair he was making.
"I see."  It sounded like Lestrade had already figured it out, or at least suspected it, because there was no surprise in his voice.  "Well, once I find out when the Ahernes can get down here tomorrow, I'll ring or text one of you with a time."
"French, German, Russian, Latin, and some ancient Greek and modern Czech."  Sherlock made it sound like it was the equivalent of reading a picture book.  "Mycroft is the one with the gift for languages."
"Yeah."  For the first time Jennifer seemed uncomfortable; she slouched slightly in the chair.
"How do you know this isn't something he made up to get back at one of his clients?"
"What did you do then?" Lou patiently asked.
"She said so."
"What do you remember clearly next?"
"And he didn't go to the police?"
"Well, you'll be able to catch up today, since you're not going anywhere."
"I started the drugs because I knew I was too old and there wasn't a way to make Her take me back."  The self-disgust in his voice was clearly evident.  "I'd have made myself younger to live with Her forever if I could have."
"I already said everything," Gloria simply said.
"Do you know who the prescription was written by?"
"Like I said to Phillip before, it's not like this isn't something I've ever experienced."
"Did he say where he was going?" John asked, a horrible sinking feeling beginning in his stomach.
He shook his head.  "No crisis.  Quiet week actually.  She slept every night.  When I left she was listening to the BBC world news on the radio."
"Yes."  He moved his gaze from his lap to his feet.  "We did not see each other again."  After a few minutes of silence John was ready to ask another question, but before he could do so Sherlock spoke.  "She was right, you know."
Once the court was reseated after lunch, Lou came up to the stand.  "The prosecution calls John Aherne."  As an usher led Mr. Aherne to the witness stand John could see the terrible effect the case still had on him; he had lost weight and looked somewhat like a man condemned.  John assumed Sherlock's warning that the defense would try to savage him on the stand weighed heavy in his mind.
"They let you see the scene, just like that?"
The steward dropped the rest of what he was holding, and took the dog off its leash.  "I have board games!  And all of the
“Did you say anything to anyone else there about it?”
"Hello, Moira," Sherlock said kindly. "Is there a chair I can bring in here?"
"When did you talk to the next victim?"
"Well, you're going to have to drink it anyway."  He poured two mugs of coffee and brought them into the other room.  He hadn't made anything else on the assumption that Lou and Susan would be giving him something for breakfast like they always did.  And true to be told, what they brought was always better than what he could quickly make at home.
"Since you said you draw, I assume you're using pencils or something similar to that."
"Not in the specifics, of course, but he needed to be reminded he was doing the right thing."
"That She - nothing important."  He had clearly caught himself mid-sentence in something he didn't want to reveal.
"If that was all it was I wouldn't be so bothered by it."
“All right,” said Sherlock in a tiny voice, like the child K still wanted him to be.
"Or do you want the books?  Or the board games?"
“That is an excellent idea, provided you can get permission to do so.”  He shifted in the chair so he was facing the window and not looking in John’s direction anymore.  “I am curious about the family dynamic in that case.”
Eli, a man about ten years older than him with dark curly hair, appeared to notice John's discomfort. "I know this can be all a bit overwhelming," he said.
"Thursday.  She'd been out of hospital for a few days at that point.  He came to our flat and talked to her in her room.  I wasn't there, but I heard the interview the next day.  It had been recorded."
He shook his head.  "Not right this minute."
Kieran looked relaxed, but Moira obviously tensed, and John expected he would volunteer.  Instead he said "Moira first.  She's got the big stuff."
"Apparently," John said with a sigh. "It's not really a new thing, though."
"When does your mother come home?" Sherlock said as soon as Phillip released him.
"Did they?"
There were more questions, a long trial, and Sherlock started to use drugs again. John had been to most of the trial and was still haunted by the stories of the victims, even the ones he hadn't known beforehand. Still worse was the memory of Sherlock's testimony. He'd clutched the stuffed bee one of the other victims had bought for him the whole time, and had looked like a frightened child. The only way he kept coping was the support group. The then fiancee of one of K's victims had invited him to a support group meeting, and John was suprised to find it was exactly what he needed. He hadn't missed a meeting yet.
"Well, a child that age needs some freedom.  You can't wrap them in cotton wool their whole lives.  And Rory is bigger than she is.  I never considered that whoever wanted to harm her wouldn't use force to do it."  He took off his glasses and wiped his eyes with his hand.
Whether it was a result of that comment or not he didn't know, but suddenly a great fatigue showed on Sherlock's face.  "I'm trying."
"It'd be nice to know," John admitted.
It was pouring rain when John left the clinic that day, pouring so hard that he got soaked in the short walk to the cab stand. Normally he didn't work on Saturday, but he'd been called in to substitute for a sick doctor. It had been a trying day, and the only thing that made it look up was that his support group met tomorrow.
Sherlock narrowed his eyes.  "Let me look at more of those medical forms you have," he said and without waiting for permission dragged the folder from the desk.  He flipped through the sheaf of papers, pulling out a few of them.  "The girl with the father who moved to Manchester, is this her?"  He held the paper in front of Lestrade's face.
He looked down into his lap, and only when Sherlock told him, "Go on," did he do so.
"If what I asked you yesterday was too intrusive, I apologize.  I just thought you might feel better if you talked to someone."  That sounded neutral enough.
Before he could ask anything else, there was a knock on the door.
"No.," Sherlock said again.
“I had been keeping an eye on everyone who recently moved from the area after my brother’s bee was taken away.”
The first time John woke up was when he heard noise coming from downstairs.  It sounded like a howl of pain.  He blinked in the early light of dawn and he listened further.  He suspected that it was Sherlock, and headed downstairs.  It could just be a nightmare, but even if it was one it was a bad one.
As Harvey asked "Do you know why the social services people seemed so reluctant to return your daughter to you?" John wondered if the defense would call Dr. Arthur when their time came.  He'd be able to cloud the argument of who had abused Jennifer a bit, but he'd also have to admit he didn't bother to do any basic testing when Sagnik Malakar had come in to A&E.
************************************************************************************
"No."
The office itself was small, dominated by a dark oak desk and several shelves of books.  A few lounge chairs faced the desk.  The curtains were half shut.  Mycroft sat himself down in the desk chair and without preamble said “Do you know that the past few months have been the first time in years that I have not been intimately tracking five different people’s finances?”
"What went on while she was in hospital?"
John stared at him for a moment. "But you know you got the numbers right."
"When you are addicted, the drugs always come first."  Mrs. Bena's voice remained surprisingly calm.  "I told myself she was only three and wouldn't be able to remember it later anyway."
Sherlock let out a loud sigh and picked the laptop up.  "I want to see the year when the city of Agra was founded."
"I'm awake," he heard Sherlock say before he could even make himself a cup of coffee.
"Your mother or the woman?"
"I've got it," Douglas said.
"What are you doing for it?" asked Peter.
"No," Phillip whispered, still looking at the ground.  "Then he asked if I'd been telling the truth when I said on the form when I broke my arm that I was having sex.  I said I was."
"No.  He was too new to the city, apparently."
"If I didn't want to go out to eat somewhere I wouldn't have suggested it.  Since when have you known me to do something I don't want to do just because someone else wants it?"
"Well, yeah, but I saw what it did to my mum and other people. I'm not thick, I know better than to mess with all that." His brown eyes bored into Sherlock as he spoke.
"We'll be all right," Mr. Rodgers said.  "Thank you for all you've done.  I don't know how to repay you."
"I will ring you again once I have testified," Sherlock told Phillip.  "Stay well."  Phillip smiled at him and he and his father exited the flat, together once again.
“Well, I’ll make up something.”
"Invite him here," Jason said.  "I didn't think I'd say this, but it's really helped so far."
"You forgot your umbrella," Sherlock said without looking up.
"What was it?"
Lou sighed again. "She can't, no, but others can make a plea to release her." He looked again at the wall of the people he'd helped. "I'm making a few calls like that today, but I thought it would be better to talk to you directly, since I never got to know Victim Three that well." Victim Three had been what Sherlock was called in all the trial documents.
"Can't they get a council flat?"
"Belly?"
"I wanted one when I was your age, but I never did have one. My mother and father didn't care for pets." John had moved during the conversation and was now on the other side of the room, so Sherlock couldn't see his eyes widen. Normally Sherlock was as tightly wound as a magnet and about as expressive. Even after living with him for over a year John still couldn't tell you much about his past. Why was this girl, of all people, getting him to open up? In fact, his whole appearance was softer, less imposing angles and more warm empathy. The really astonishing thing was that the empathy was real, as far as John could tell. He was genuinely concerned for Moira Aherne.
"No one's here but me.  You're in your own bed.  You're safe.  Please wake up."  John wondered if putting a hand on his shoulder would make things better or worse.
“Yeah.  That’s me.”
"I know where this flat is!  From what the boy said about the design of the building it has to be in one specific part of London, and that part should be near where both Phillip Rodgers and Moira Aherne live.  If I go to that area in the day, it should be easy to find."  He snapped his fingers.
"What else did you do?"
"No, I don’t hate you," John replied.  What he wanted to do next was to refute his reasoning, but he realized he didn't have the energy to do so.  "I'm going to make dinner.  I'm willing to bet you haven't eaten anything today so you're going to join me for supper."  He was seized with a sudden urge to give Sherlock a hug, or otherwise physically comfort him, but he knew that it wouldn't be received well.  Instead he got up and headed towards the kitchen, trying to think of something he could make that would only take a few minutes.  Almost all of the few things he could think of were unavailable due to lack of ingredients, so he gave up and just made up some pasta.  When he gave Sherlock a plate he actually finished all of it, much to John's surprise.  After that he remained curled up at his end of the sofa while John sat through an hour and a half of crap telly.  John was glad he didn't have to go in again tomorrow.  At least if he was at home he could keep an eye on Sherlock.  The very thought that he had to "keep an eye" on someone that a few weeks ago he considered unwilling to show any sort of weakness was almost enough to make him start crying again.  Wisely, John didn't do so until both of them had gone to bed.
"Between her legs.  Use my hand there and kiss her on the mouth."
"No, because he's not part of the charges, just to indicate a pattern of behavior.  After he's testified we'll bring in the investigators and some others.  It'll be a while in any case.  Victim One's going to be testifying next."  Lou motioned for a cab.  When one pulled up to the curb he said "I'll see you tomorrow," as he climbed in.  John hailed a separate cab and rode silently back home.  He considered picking up some takeaway, but there was enough food in the flat to eat now, and he wanted to get home as quickly as possible.  He needed to see how Sherlock had done with all the trial coverage.  Knowing him, he'd have picked up every newspaper in the city and watched every broadcast about it online.
"He thinks it's about the sex.  He's told me that he orgasmed when they were having sex."
"When did you last eat?" John asked.
"Is your dad busier than he was in Ireland?"
“All right.  Have you eaten?” He didn’t sound angry or irritated, more resigned.
"We talked," Sherlock said after a short silence.
"It will," Eli said firmly.
John sighed, although he wasn't entirely surprised. "Is that all?"
John knew he wasn't supposed to make his presence known, but he couldn't resist looking into Moira's room. She was sitting on the bed with a book, a veritable wall of stuffed animals on one side of the bed. The dog (tan, huge, and wrinkled) was lying down on a large round cushion. A Doctor Who poster and a Star Wars poster were on adjacent walls, and a large poster of some astronomical object hung over the bed. He noticed that the room had a window right by the bed, and with a twinge of unease realized it was on just the right level for someone to enter by it. He ducked out of the way as Sherlock walked into the room, pulled out the recorder, and pressed the button.
Sherlock was still asleep when John headed out to his group meeting. He'd still been up when John had gone to bed, but had also indicated that he still wanted John with him in his room. They'd begun doing so during the whole horror of the case with K. It wasn't exactly platonic, but it wasn't sexual, either. Sherlock usually used Hamish as a large fuzzy block that kept the two of them from touching. On top of that, he sometimes told John to sleep upstairs, and when Sherlock wasn't there John slept upstairs as well. So John had fallen asleep alone, but woke up to a Hamish barrier. He tried not to make a lot of noise as he got ready and headed out. It was only ten-thirty, and the meeting wasn't until noon, but he was going to walk there. It helped clear out his brain.
"What did your parents do while they still worked?"
"Gloria got married while you were gone," Eli said to Peter. Gloria was Gloria Yellowfox, the person who had introduced John to the group. John knew the man she'd married, Graham, slightly from the K case.
"Go on," Sherlock said after a minute of silence.
John managed to find his previous seat and settle himself before the prosecution entered the room.  Lou came up to the front as the usher led Phillip back up to the stand.  Even from this far back John could see he had a ghostly pallor.  Lou remained his usual relaxed self.  "You mentioned being taught how to kiss before.  Did she teach you anything else?"
“Hello John,” Sarah said to him, sounding as friendly as always.  “It’s very slow today, so you don’t need to come in.”
"Did they discuss taking your children into care?"
"Had you told her where you lived?"
"A few days later.  It wasn't at the clinic, though.  Mum'd been yelling at me all day and I walked out of the flat.  There was a park down the street and it didn't have a play yard or anything but there was one of those little round shelters there and I liked to go under it and daydream.  I'd been there a few minutes and I heard Her asking what I was doing hiding under there."  Phillip broke eye contact with Lou and looked at the floor.
"Meet Martin.  This morning he was here and Sherlock was gone."
"Tell me about it."  He handed back the flash drive.
"You liked talking to him because he didn't ask you any questions?"
"And how did you use that to find Dr. Martin's address?"
"Yes."
"Very convenient," John said in a tone heavy with meaning.
"They said we couldn't talk until the trial was over and I tried to just wait but I couldn't."  He moved a little closer to Sherlock.
"Why did you go there, then?" Lou inquired.
"Including you?"  John dared to ask.  If Sherlock had been half as abrasive back then as he could be now, he couldn't really imagine anyone trying to be friendly with him.
"Because," she finally whispered.
"Dr. Arthur?" said a bewildered John, who wasn't sure why this was coming up or why Sherlock had picked now to say it.
“Remember how spooked Ms. Morstan’s father was after interacting with whatever this group is.  Anyone trying to put a light on them wouldn’t want to be known.”
The cab ride back to Baker Street had to be one of the most uncomfortable John had ever experienced.  Sherlock might as well have been a mannequin with a head that moved.  Even when they reached the safety of home, he merely sat down on the sofa and stared.  He wasn’t sulking, he wasn’t lost in thought, he was just blank.  This unnerved John so much that he retreated to his room, not wanting to do anything about it other than hope it would go away.  Before the case it wasn’t something he would have ever done, but this had sapped so much of his energy.  A thought occurred to him: if this case drained him so much, how must Sherlock feel?  He banished it quickly as it came.
"No," Lou said.  "He asked to be excused from it."
"How many times did you go there?"
Mr. Aherne stopped leading them into the kitchen and turned around.  "Not possible, I'm afraid.  I've got bread in the oven."  He didn't need to point that out; the smell of it baking wafted from the kitchen.  "Our Saturday suppers haven't been as good as they should be recently, so I decided I'd go all out today."  He looked at Sherlock's left arm, where a nicotine patch was visible between his hand and coat sleeve.  "Trying to quit?" he asked.  "I gave it up myself when Nora first got pregnant.  They say it's harder than with hard drugs."
"Good morning," he responded in a hoarse whisper.
She continued on like she hadn't heard the question.  “Are you still friends with that boy I saw you with?  Was he your boyfriend too?  Nosy little thing, he was.”
"He's probably going to get high," John said with a sigh.
"I did it too," he quietly mumbled.  "And Her flat... sometimes She had other people there.  Little kids."
John knew then he should change the subject.  "Is there really a way to put something on a flash drive but not make it visible to anyone?"
"I can give him your number and tell him to ring you, but I don't know if I can just give his number to you," she said.  "Is whatever you saw in the records something you can discuss?"
"Has that protocol actually been changed at this point?"  From Sherlock's tone it was obvious that he didn't think so.
"And that was it?  You and her hadn't had a disagreement near that period of time?"
"A few times when the weather was nice we'd stay there but we usually went to a flat nearby.  I thought it was where She lived but She said once it belonged to a friend.  Sometimes I got biscuits and ice creams.  If Rory was with me when I went to the park we'd stay there.  Then we'd just go in the bathrooms.  Sometimes I'd walk Rory home and come back after."
"That was all she did?"
After a minute or so, he felt calm down enough to ascend the steps and unlock the door. When he entered, the air in the flat was heavy with the smell of formaldehyde, and knowing that Sherlock was still at one of his strange experiments was improbably reassuring. John even managed to crack a smile when he saw Sherlock inside alternately typing on his laptop and observing a set of animal organs spread on the counter (thankfully, all of them were resting on pieces of wax paper).
"Wife," Eli said in response.
"But he didn't bring her up when he came home?"
"How were the other victims brought to your attention?" At this point John realized that that flat repressed anger he'd seen in Sherlock when he'd told him about Moira was back. Perhaps less repressed, if the shaking of his hands were any indication.
"Do they even know it exists?  From the way they stopped going after her father, I'd guess they didn't think he had anything of note."
“The sugar bowl.”
"Someone I knew from school," Sherlock said in response.
"I'm not Martin.  I'm Sherlock Holmes.  I went to sleep in my room and woke up here in someone else's body.  Is it not obvious?"  Perhaps this Douglas wasn't the quickest one in the room.
He almost expected Sherlock to retort that it wasn't any of his business, but instead he looked away.  "Off.  Doing things," he muttered.
"Because she wanted to tell someone already; she just didn't know how to do it safely."
The first thing that John noticed was the minimal furniture.  It wasn't a particularly large flat, so there wasn't really room for a lot of belongings, but all that was in the living area that bordered the kitchen was a couch, a throw rug, and a coffee table.  The kitchen had no microwave, or for that matter any other appliances; all that was there was a stove, refrigerator, and some cupboards.  The second thing was how clean it seemed.  If K really didn't live here, he still had to put some effort into cleaning the place.  Of course, if he really brought his victims to this place cleaning it would effectively remove most evidence.  Mrs. Murray shook her head in silent disapproval before leading them down the hall to the one bedroom.  It was also furnished minimally; there was only a king-size bed with no headboard or footboard tucked in the corner and a chest of drawers.  There wasn't even a bedside table with a lamp and a clock.  Sherlock strode up to the bed and bent over the covers, sniffing audibly.  "These sheets were recently washed," he said.  "Is there a laundry in this building?"
A conversation with Sherlock and John.
Sherlock reached into his coat pockets and pulled out a tape recorder.  It didn’t look like the ones the Yard used, so John assumed that he’d bought it earlier that day.  “I’m going to record our conversation so you don’t have to tell everything to the police again.  Is that all right with you?”
Sherlock said nothing, but stood up with Hamish in his arms and went up the stairs.  John got dressed for bed in his own room, thinking that Sherlock needed the extra privacy more than ever, and when he went back down Sherlock had already curled himself around Hamish under the covers.
"Speaking of women, as you all know my fiancé is going to testify against the woman who abused him in a week or two," Gloria said.
"Can you state your name for the record?" Susan asked first.  It wasn't something she'd done before in the case, and John figured she asked it so Sherlock could compose himself.
"Almost six years now."
"I don't remember," Moira quickly replied, making it obvious that whatever it was she didn't want to discuss it.
"It got taken away," he tersely replied. John wanted to ask why, but he knew better than to try, and merely stared out the window. Rain was spitting down from the sky, casting a dull sheen on the ground. The sound was the perfect dismal soundtrack for the two people who were in the same space, and yet both alone.
"That's true," he admitted.
"Hi," she said cautiously.
Back, yes. But in what kind of condition?
While he didn't specify what he meant, John knew.  "You can bring Hamish if you want."
"Are there any identifiable adults in these photographs?" Sherlock tightly asked.
"Just a John." She looked up towards his face. "Do I have to have another needle? Or a pill or more stitches?"
John could only manage to be shocked for a second or two, because Lou once again spoke.  "Do you remember when you saw her next?"
"I did," Rodney said quietly.
He shook his head.  "No.  We've only been here for three years.  We came from Bangladesh."
“What did he leave the police for?”
"And you thought there was something wrong with that?"
(See the end of the chapter for
He went into the bathroom, took off his clothes, and turned the shower on as cold as it would get. A few minutes of that, and he could get out and dress again. As he dressed, his mind drifted to Victor again. Before he could think another
“Sometimes they were younger than me and sometimes they were the same age or a little older.”
Around three in the afternoon, John heard someone coming up the stairs.  Considering all that had happened over the last few days, he wouldn't have been surprised if it was Mycroft, but in a few seconds Sherlock came through the door.  He looked even paler than usual, dark circles under his eyes.  His coat and the rest of his clothes were dirty; the only thing not dirty was Hamish, who was tucked under one arm.  "Can you not be too angry at me?" he said before John could stand up.
