Sherlock’s cheeks heated, and he smiled. “I could say the same thing about you, John Watson.”
[3 September, 7:41PM] I think I may need your services after all. SH
Sherlock smiled politely as if this information was new to him. “Sherlock Holmes.”
John led him outside with a hand on the small of his back, just as he had done the night before on the way to the party.  The restaurant was only a few blocks away, so they chose to walk. They remained silent for most of the way, though the quiet wasn’t as awkward as it could have been.

All this time, John had been imagining that Sherlock had had countless casual lovers before. That was the way of their people, after all. But, no, John was the only one. A new wave of arousal punched through his stomach. He shouldn’t have been so turned on by the revelation. Christ, for all he knew, Sherlock could just be going along with this because they thought they needed to based on that cliché romance novel they’d read a week earlier. John took a steadying breath and tried to keep his arousal under control before he asked, “Do you want us to have sex right now?”
In the morning, yes.  But not just yet.
The man nodded. “Sígueme. Teléfono para usted.”
This in part fulfills
Sarah seemed reluctant, but she eventually nodded and left with the rest of the researchers.
I understand that sort of boredom.
Feeling bold, John texted,
He pushed himself into a sitting position and took a moment to simply rub at his temples, hoping to rid himself of the headache he could feel lurking there.  When he looked around the room—fully determined to commit it to memory in case he was never invited back—he discovered a folded piece of paper perched on the coffee table.

Sherlock bit his lip to stifle his moan, but even that didn’t do much to decrease his volume.
By the time he showed up at the crime scene, he was nearly an hour late, as he’d had to shower and change and help John clean up a bit.
John pulled back a bit, and Sherlock pouted. That earned him another quick peck, so it wasn’t all bad. “Well, to start, I’d love to move in with you,” he said. Sherlock opened his mouth, brow furrowed, but John continued before he could speak: “And I mean that. I’m not just saying it. Just because I hadn’t thought about it before doesn’t mean it’s not a good idea. I mean, it’s a bit fast, but you already know everything about me, and I know enough about you, so I think it might work.”
John ordered a whiskey, and Sherlock rolled his eyes. He would have to get John to actually experience life outside of the confines of masculinity and give his taste-buds a break from such unpleasant cocktails.
Sherlock held tightly onto John as they moved—
John’s smile faded. He rubbed a hand over his face. “Are we going to argue about me going over there again?”
He even considered calling home, but he knew what Mummy would say.
As soon as Sherlock reached out to take it, John’s newly free hand came up to rest on his hip.  Sherlock nearly choked on the sip he’d taken, startled beyond belief at the contact. They were in public. John was touching him.
[10:28AM] I love you so much. SH
John pulled almost all the way off before sinking down again, setting a steady rhythm that was far too slow in Sherlock’s mind. He tried to say so, but when he opened his mouth, all that came out was a breathless moan. John apparently didn’t like the sound, as he almost immediately moved one of his hands to cover Sherlock’s mouth, one finger slipping inside. Sherlock moaned again, unable to help himself even if John hated it, and did his best to imitate John’s movements with the finger in his mouth.

“Mrs. Hudson makes you breakfast?” John asked, examining the spread.
Subject: RE: You never do this
Sherlock merely stared at him, trying to sort out the meaning of all of this. John had taken it upon himself to find Sherlock’s flat when Sherlock had failed to arrive.
John blinked and straightened up a bit. He had been staring, he realised. While the team had been interrogating his date, he’d just been caught up in looking at him, in thinking about him. A bit embarrassing, that, but he wasn’t sorry about being caught. “You’re incredibly captivating,” he said, and he knew it sounded overly romantic, but he figured that Sherlock could use a little more romance.
“Christ,” he breathed into his now-empty flat.
Sherlock shook his head vigorously.  “
John laughed lightly but didn’t let himself be swayed from what he needed to know. “Is that the only reason you would get all quiet when I brought up the military in our texts?”
John actually blushed at that, and it was ridiculous. He’d never been shy talking about sex before, but with Sherlock, it somehow felt different. He wasn’t sure how to explain that he’d gladly spend hours cuddling on the sofa with Sherlock and would have been just as happy to spend an entire day in bed with him. God, he was infatuated.
“Sci-fi. You know, science fiction.” Sherlock continued to stare blankly at John. “Science fiction is all aliens and robots that become sentient and weird impossible things happening,” he explained.
Sherlock frowned.  He hadn’t known that there was a game scheduled for that evening.  That would certainly explain why John had left early. Perhaps he hadn’t scared the man off, after all.
“Boyfriends,” Sherlock said again, and this time it wasn’t a question.
And there was just enough of a command in John’s tone for a shiver to roll down Sherlock’s spine. He immediately set about undressing, carelessly tossing his clothes in a pile. He, unlike John, was not a quitter, and so he didn’t stop at just removing his shirt, instead stripping down to absolutely nothing, leaving him standing in his room completely nude in front of a man still half-dressed.
On the weekend, he repeated what he had done before and merely worked through as many cases as he could get access to without being invited by the police. A few of the tips he called in were actually taken seriously, and he was asked to come in and give a statement. No one commented on his age when he went down to Scotland Yard, and one of the DI’s actually took down Sherlock’s number in case his assistance was needed on another tricky case. It was far more gratifying to be recognised than he had expected, and Sherlock even went so far as to give the man a parting smile on his way out of the building.
He had never been treated the way John treated him. He had craved that sort of admiration and respect for so long, but now that he had it, he wasn’t sure how to react. He would have to figure that out, though, if he was going to survive an entire night undercover with John.
And one day, when they were both nearing thirty, they were no longer boyfriends but now husbands.

Sherlock wrapped one leg around John’s waist and tried to pull him down, but John refused to move. Sherlock whined and tried to rock his hips up against John’s, but there was too much distance between them for him to get any friction.
“I’ve got to go,” John said, gesturing to his teammate, and Sherlock couldn’t tell if that disappointment in his tone was real or imagined. He turned to leave, before adding, “I’m John Watson, by the way.”
John held his hands up in front of him. “Sorry. Didn’t mean to offend.” He dropped the flannel he’d been holding in one hand back onto the countertop. “So, if you don’t work for the Yard, what sort of detective are you?”

They had put on clothes that must have been stashed in one of the bedrooms. Slender black trousers that might have belonged to a very tall woman and a pale green button-up field shirt that appeared to be a size too small. They stood there, newly dressed and barefoot, staring at John intently. Then, they started to whistle.
“He’s the guy,” John said. “He has to be the guy. Let’s call Lestrade.”
He would have regretted making that sort of assumption about the longevity of their relationship, but before he could do so, Sherlock’s entire body seemed to emit a turquoise glow. “Really?” they asked excitedly. “We could do that?”
Indeed, Sherlock’s cheeks turned the lightest shade of pink, and he smiled—a real, soft smile, not the stiff one he’d been wearing while talking to John’s teammates. “Flatterer,” he accused, but he was still grinning.
“We might want to start getting rid of these clothes,” John noted, pulling back just enough to strip his vest off.
Sherlock nodded.
“Is that so?” Sherlock murmured, his words ghosting across John’s lips.
you are.”
He hesitated for only a moment before catching another cab, this one taking him to the café and bakery.  It would be better, he told himself, to simply get this all over with. Besides, John hadn’t seemed overly angry in his text.  The use of emoticon certainly indicated that he was in a good mood.  It was possible, then, that this wouldn’t be overly painful. Perhaps John would even agree to let them stay friends.  That would be far more than Sherlock thought he deserved after forcing himself on John, at any rate.
“Pity,” Sherlock said. “You could use the additional income.”
[6:27AM] You know why. JW
I’m very good.
His thought process ground to a halt when Sherlock surged forward and kissed him—just once, just a hard peck, but it was enough to bring him back to the present.
“Yes, that is so.”  John approached the pair of them.  “Now, if you’ll kindly leave him the fuck alone, we can get on with our evening.”
Sherlock shut the door and hung up his coat. “I was late picking you up.”
“Let me in there and I can confirm whether or not the body found in there was victim to the same murderer that struck three days ago on the other side of town,” Sherlock argued. “I’m a consulting detective. I work on my own. You wouldn’t be liable if anything happened to me in there. Just let me do my work.”
he thought, ducking his head away so that they wouldn’t see him when they walked in.
Lestrade had the decency to look a bit embarrassed, and Sherlock only offered him a tight-lipped smile to indicate that he didn’t take offense.
You’ve essentially wasted my time to tell me what I already know.
John was still smiling. He leaned forward and kissed Sherlock sweetly on the nose. “Now we move into the bathroom so that I can finally fix your shower,” he said.
, he thought, awed at how lucky he had gotten. Had John not been shot when he was, they likely wouldn’t have met. John would have been in someplace like Afghanistan, and Sherlock would have been stuck in London, and they never would have known about one another. Or perhaps they would have met, but after John’s tour, and that probably wouldn’t have been very good, either. John would have suffered from PTSD in all likelihood, and Sherlock would have been alone for too long, and there would have been too many rough edges to fit together. Under those circumstances, he didn’t know how long it would have taken John to start touching him, to start calling him those sweet names.
John laughed and jogged to catch up with him. “Eager?” he teased, reaching out to take Sherlock’s hand.
Sherlock opened his mouth, but the words wouldn’t come.  As he tried to formulate an accurate response, he found that what had happened the night before seemed too far-fetched to be real.
[5:05PM] I just did a bit of reading on an army wives’ website, and there was some discussion amongst the women there that they were concerned about that sort of thing. SH

The new position meant that their lips were pulled apart, but John immediately began to attack his neck instead, sucking love-bites there that would last for days.

There was no part of this that indicated that John was lying to him merely to make him feel better. If that had been the case, he doubted that John would have been attacking his mouth quite this vigorously. Sherlock relaxed, his arms wrapping around John’s neck to keep him close. His lips were practically bruised from the force of their kiss, and yet he relished in that tangible reminder of what they were engaging in.
“You are
Sherlock pouted at that so adorably that John could feel some of his own grumpiness fade away.

Sherlock assumed a haughty expression and didn’t meet his gaze. “I didn’t
John laughed, eyes sparkling. “Eager, are we?”

John was quite charmed by those simple desires. “Bees are common where I’m from,” John told them, “and there’s plenty of dogs back there, too.”
Sherlock groaned and tossed his head back.

There was no electric kettle at the research base, so John had to make do with the stovetop one that had been provided. Hot tea was rarely the sort of thing one craved in the Tropics, but it would be familiar enough to keep him sane as he tried to process what was happening.
John’s hopes for a possible reconciliation were dashed, though, when Sherlock led them into a little clearing (a man-made one—or, in this case, alien made). All the trees in the area had been knocked down by what could have only been the ship Sherlock had used to get to Earth in the first place. It looked very much like something out of a sci-fi film (though, as Sherlock reminded him, science

There was only one thing John could think of to cause this distance. Sherlock was growing bored of him. They were probably planning on where to go next, having exhausted their enjoyment of their time with John. It stung a bit, knowing that. Well, more than just a bit. John’s heart felt nauseous. Christ, he’d gotten attached. Sherlock hadn’t even left yet, and John was already feeling it. He’d never been so upset over any past failed relationship, but Sherlock was different.

Sherlock let out a relieved sigh.  “I’d appreciate that.  I’ll see you a little later, then.”
John let out a startled laugh.  “My girlfriend?  God, no, Sarah isn’t my girlfriend.”  When Sherlock continued to look sceptical, John added, “I mean, yeah, we used to date, and we’re pretty close still, but we’re just friends.”  He furrowed his brow.  “Is that why you freaked out two weeks ago?”
Sherlock let out an aggrieved sigh. Really, that bit had been painfully obvious. “The first victim—Richards—was wearing a brand of pants that caters specifically to gay men. Clarkson had a collection of eyeliner, mascara, and lipstick in his bedroom, and statistically that indicates someone who isn’t straight. McGrew owned a collection of sex toys which, again, statistically speaking suggests a gay man. And this man—Jason Murray—still has photos of him and his ex hanging up over the flat. A recent break-up with a long-time lover does lead some to seek out strangers at bars. He still has the entry stamp on his hand. The killer is flirting with these men, getting their phone numbers, and likely offering them company back to their flats. That’s how he knows their mobile numbers and addresses. It’s the only explanation that makes sense.”

Sherlock walked into the library at five minutes after two—a carefully calculated five minutes so that he wouldn’t seem too eager but would still arrive early enough so as not to discourage John.  Luckily, Seb was dealing with a student when he entered, so he was spared from having to put up with the man.  Sherlock took up his usual table and pulled a few books out before glancing up at John. He flushed and looked away when he realised that John was already looking at him.  When he peeked back up, John offered him a smile, which Sherlock carefully returned.
Sherlock shook his head and pulled John back down. “Shut up,” he murmured, and then their lips were touching again, and neither of them saw fit to say anything else for quite some time.

The air in the room felt too cold on his heated skin, and he wrapped his arms around himself, partly to ward off the chill and partly to take back some of the modesty he’d just discarded. It had seemed like a good idea at the time to just rid himself of all clothing, but he was now feeling a resurgence of self-consciousness.

There was the sound of movement on the floor beside Sherlock’s ankle, and John pulled the detective away from the perceived threat. “Do—not—move,” John growled down at the man, whose initial fear of John had apparently turned to angry acquiescence.

In which Sherlock and John go on a (group) date.
“What?” Sherlock asked.
.  He suppressed a wince.  Yes, that would certainly not go over well, especially not when he was still uncertain of John’s interest in men.  At the game, it had definitely felt like John had been attracted to him, but he couldn’t guarantee that the man was comfortable enough with his sexuality to want to pursue anything.  Sherlock had gone down that path before, and he wasn’t keen on repeating those experiences.  “I just thought I needed a bit of fresh air.”  He remembered that John, too, was walking around the grounds on a Sunday evening.  “And what are you doing out here?”
Sherlock’s entire body froze, which had the effect of making John freeze as well. He suddenly remembered what he had felt the last time he’d drifted off to sleep. A slight pressure on his forehead. That same exact slight pressure he’d felt just then. John had been kissing his head. He forced himself to relax in the face of this earth-shattering revelation of very romantic contact he had apparently missed. “So sleeping in my bed isn’t allowed, but you’ll do that while I’m drugged?” Sherlock said, not unkindly, as he pulled his hands away from his face. He was starting to reconsider his ban on kissing John before brushing his teeth, because he very badly wanted more than just a forehead kiss now that he knew that John was comfortable with that.
John looked momentarily ashamed at being caught out, but even that wasn’t enough to take away his smile. He’d smiled essentially the entire time he’d been there. He’d even been smiling as he’d told Sherlock off that first night for being such a prat about picking him up from the airport. For a man who clearly had a bit of a temper, John seemed to be in remarkably good spirits now that he was no longer at war, at least for the time being. Sherlock would need to make a note to bring that up toward the end of John’s scheduled tour to discourage him from signing up for another one.
Yes. Bedroom. They would be able to do so much more in the bedroom. He at least had lubricant in there. He shivered at the thought of all they could do with that. This certainly wasn’t moving fast enough. He shoved at John, urging him to get up. John did so with noticeable confusion but didn’t seem concerned that the events of the night were stopping. Good. Sherlock didn’t want John to worry about that. He pushed himself up from the sofa and said, “This way,” before walking down the hall toward his room. He felt unsure of himself right then. It was easy when they were pressed together, but walking together was strange. Should he have been holding John’s hand? Should he have been giving John more space? He really didn’t know.

John stared at it. “What’s this, then?” he said, and his voice had lost any of the friendliness that had returned to it earlier.
Sherlock didn’t bother trying to deny it. “Do you always sleep so soundly?” they repeated.

It wasn’t in a cruel way—no, in their brief time together, John had never been cruel. Instead, it seemed that he knew precisely how to get Sherlock’s mind to shut down, to focus solely on their physical attraction to one another.

Anyway, I hope you like it!
John was even sexier like that than Sherlock had previously imagined. Sherlock licked his lips and reached out one hand to rest on John’s chest, moving it slowly down the man’s front and simply feeling the muscle and slight traces of subcutaneous fat. Sherlock noted the scar that peeked out from behind one side of John’s vest. He knew that too much attention to it might make John uncomfortable, so he merely passed his fingers over it gently before moving on.
Sherlock sat back down beside him. “It’s a good thing I have a boyfriend to take care of me.”
One day after their night together.
Hearing John’s voice like that, low and dark and unbearably sexy, caused a new wave of arousal to sweep through Sherlock’s body. He moved more quickly against John, chasing that pleasure he’d gone without since they had last been together.
Sherlock hadn’t even considered the possibility of a one-time thing. Had John propositioned him when they’d first met, he surely would have assumed that a single night was all the man wanted, and he likely would have turned John down as a result. Now, though, after growing increasingly close to one another over nearly two months, Sherlock couldn’t fathom the thought that this might have all been in pursuit of a quick shag. “Neither am I,” he told John.
Sherlock nodded, eyes fixed on John.  “Yes, they really are.”

“Poison,” John announced from where he was crouched over the body: a white male, mid-twenties, lying on the floor of his own apartment. John pulled apart the victim’s toes with gloved hands. His medical abilities had not rusted in his time as a handyman, Sherlock had discovered, and it was ridiculously attractive to watch him work. “Injected between the toes here. I don’t see any other indication that this man used drugs, so this mark seems to be from the killer.”
Sherlock did look up at John then, his confusion winning out over his distress. “Because you indicated as much when we first started this.”

He wasn’t used to it, and he was quickly discovering just how complimentary John could be when in a relationship with someone. “You look nice as well,” he murmured.

“All right, John?” Lestrade said, patting him on the back.
Later, when they had collapsed in bed in a sweaty heap, Sherlock considered that he might have been wrong about John. He could hear John’s heartbeat, steady and strong, where his head was resting on John’s chest. John was sleeping, but Sherlock couldn’t seem to get himself to do the same. He wasn’t willing to get his hopes up, but the fact that John had come to Baker Street and wanted to have sex with him in spite of Sherlock’s tardiness earlier that day

“Sorry,” John cut in, “but are you about to go track down a serial killer?”
There was nothing but silence for a moment on the other end of the radio, and Sherlock began to worry that he had perhaps put yet another person off with his deductions. That hadn’t been his aim, especially not with someone as interesting as a retired army captain turned firefighter.
Sherlock stared up at the ceiling. One of his arms dangled over the edge of the sofa, and one was placed carelessly over his head.
He pulled his laptop toward him and opened up a new browser window. He wanted to look this kid up online to see if they were even remotely in the same area, or at least if they were close enough to meet. He stared down at his phone in frustration for several long minutes before he finally got a reply.
) before he set about trying to figure out what he was going to wear.
After first spotting him that Monday afternoon, Sherlock had looked up the rugby team on their university’s website.  It had taken all of two minutes to find the name of the captain. John Watson.  What a boring name for a decidedly not boring man.
Sherlock, at the mention of that, mimicked what he’d done all those weeks ago and simply didn’t respond.
John’s mouth dropped open, and his eyes raked over Sherlock in a way that sent a thrill down his spine. “Gorgeous,” John breathed.
Then, in a perfect imitation of John’s voice, the alien said, “I can modify it if it’s upsetting you.”
“I think I’d like to solve crimes,” he answered.
He felt as if an electric shock had gone through him. It was maddening and arousing and he couldn’t get enough. “
Sherlock rolled his eyes and tried to act self-assured, but his hands were trembling a bit.
In which they enjoy the morning after.
The old woman’s eyes lit up. “Oh, I’ve heard so much about you,” she told him.
John’s blood ran cold. This man knew about Sherlock. Keeping his eyes trained on the alien now prodding at a mosquito that had somehow made its way inside, John repeated, “Not interested.”

“Yeah, that’s it, baby,” he said, watching as a flush crawled up Sherlock’s neck and into his cheeks. “So hot. Just like that.”

It's safe to say that this is going to be following the female model.  I can never deal with angst for very long, so whenever it shows up, it's always dealt with fairly quickly, so rest assured that there will be more minor angst in the future as well as thorough resolutions to all of it.
Sherlock gave a shrug, not looking up at John.  He went to take another sip from his drink but found that it was empty. He frowned down at the cup.
He knew by then when to make an exit, so he slipped away from the group before any physical harm could come to him.  As he headed back toward the tables, he heard Seb say, “It’s freakish, that trick, but damn if it isn’t spot-on.”  Sherlock’s steps only faltered for a moment, long enough for him to shut his eyes and take a deep breath, before he continued walking back toward the table he’d taken up in the past week.

“That sounds a little…unfeeling.”
“Never have I ever been shot.” Now Sherlock and John both had nine fingers up, meaning that one of them would lose at any moment. John nudged Sherlock’s shoulder with his own and jokingly murmured, “You’re going down,” and Sherlock was starting to relax a bit more. That was, until he realised that it was Donovan’s turn next.

I won’t mind your presence entirely.
“You were trying to be a hero, weren’t you?” That seemed in keeping with John’s nature. Sherlock had to admit that he was irrationally jealous at the fact that John had gone out of his way to save someone else.
Sherlock rolled his eyes at the emoticon, but he couldn’t help the slight smile that rose to his lips.  It seemed that he found everything John Watson did to be endearing. Before he could think of a response, another text came in.

Three separate blurs, to be exact, which consisted of
Everyone seemed interested at that point, most other conversations dying down, and Sherlock seemed to be a bit less tense at that point, perhaps because he really was confident in his abilities.
Sherlock was starting to regret not having a conversation about his feelings earlier. This would have all felt different, he was sure, if he had been certain of where he and John stood with one another. As it was, he was unable to call upon more pleasant memories of being groped or called “baby,” as John hadn’t really done either of those things with him yet.

This time, the reply was instant.
God, now he was blushing again.  His heart was hammering in his chest, that fluttery feeling branching out from his stomach and into the rest of his body.  “That’s impossible,” he heard himself say, but his voice sounded odd. He sat down on the edge of his bed. A date?  With John Watson?  Definitely impossible.  There was no reason for John to want that when he could have anybody.
John shook his head. “I don’t understand. If you’re Sherlock’s sibling, why did you threaten them if they didn’t leave?”
He had kissed people before. There had been Susan when he was five, though that had merely been the two of them tripping and smacking against one another. The touching of lips had been accidental and painful. Then there was Victor in sixth form. That had been wet and sloppy and not entirely comfortable. The only people since then had been persons of interest in cases he was working. So he had done this before, yes, but his experience was still far too limited to have prepared him for kissing John Watson.
Hey. Done with your ban on cases?
“You’ve been texting that girl, haven’t you?” Stamford asked. “The one we met at the pub, right?”
Sherlock carefully stored away this new information about John.  Lived a few blocks from campus, likely with a party-loving roommate, but did not enjoy being at parties for too long at a time.  That was interesting.  Then again, any information about John was interesting.
[3 September, 7:12PM] Any need for my services around the flat recently? JW
[5:06PM] God, no. I’d never want anyone else. SH
Sherlock rolled his eyes. “It’s hardly that bad.”
[5:12PM] I might like that. SH
He decided that Bird Girl was the absolute worst, not that he hadn’t already suspected as much beforehand. He put his phone down, expecting it to just remain silent from that point forward, but instead, it pinged again after only a few seconds.
John’s look of incredulity might have been amusing in other circumstances, but as it was, it only served to confuse Sherlock even more. “I never said that,” he countered.
“Yes,” he found himself saying, in spite of the rational reasons for turning John down. He cleared his throat and set his wine glass down on the coffee table. “That is to say, yes, I want this.” He wasn’t one for casual sex—or sex at all, really—but John had paid for dinner, and there was something about their interactions that indicated more than just carnal interest.
The man smirked, and Sherlock found that he quite honestly never wanted anyone else to smirk at him aside from John, because this was nauseating. It left a bitter taste in his mouth rather than the intended sweetness of the rosé. “You found it, baby.”
[3:58AM] Are you in a lot of pain? SH
Howlers sounded in the distance, and Sherlock’s antennae immediately flicked in that direction. John found that he didn’t like when Sherlock’s attention was diverted away from him. He told himself that he was merely worried that he would lose this opportunity to talk to an actual extraterrestrial being because they’d run off again to chase after howlers. He was by no means jealous of a monkey. That would be ridiculous.
So, going shopping with Sherlock was very much like going shopping alone at first. John went about picking up his standard, monthly ration of rice and beans, (though this time he took care to also buy ingredients for a cobbler,) while Sherlock flipped through a soap opera guide (and they were lucky that about half of the magazines were in English and were therefore legible to them).
“On my planet, people only keep information that’s
“Wait,” John said, and Sherlock stopped immediately, relieved. “I know we haven’t known each other that long, but you kind of disappeared recently, and I’m not sure when I’ll get to see you again.”  He took a breath, obviously steeling himself for something.  “So I was just wondering if you…”
Sherlock scowled. “Don’t be absurd.
“I was planning on being overseas with the army at this point,” John explained distractedly as he simultaneously picked up the table’s collapsed legs to determine their viability. “And then suddenly I had a bullet wound instead of a job, and you kind of need a job, so here I am for now.”
And he thought and thought and thought about it for the rest of his day, nearly exhausting his three-year-old self.  Finally, he came up with something.  When Mummy returned that evening, Sherlock walked up to her, the dog close behind.
Sherlock nodded, though it wasn’t true.  His head was aching a bit, but it was only minor, and he didn’t feel the urge to vomit at all.  He had only had two drinks, after all.  It was embarrassing that he had even gotten drunk that quickly in the first place.
Mrs. Hudson merely laughed and patted his arm, as if to say,
He was so absorbed in jotting down the relevant information in his notebook that he didn’t even notice that anyone had approached his table until someone cleared their throat from above him.
“She was cute,” Stamford said cheerily.
John rubbed a hand down Sherlock’s arm, trying to soothe them through any awkwardness they were feeling. “Right,” John said, “but what do you personally do?”
“I’m just going to go…”  Lestrade pointed over at Molly.  “We were going to grab pizza.” He hesitated.  “Oh, you can come, if you want.  I mean, you’re more than welcome to join us.”

, John thought. He could see Sherlock’s antennae peeking up from under his hair now, and he decided it would be brilliant if he could get Sherlock to lose control of their ability to mimic the human form entirely.
“I see you’ve found the fruit,” John commented as he walked into the kitchen hours later. He looked around the room. “And the library, apparently.”
That depends entirely on whether or not you’re as good as you were last time. You might have gotten rusty in the last few months.

Molly gave him a strange look, clearly suspicious of his behaviour, but she thankfully didn’t push the issue.  “They’re all rather fit, aren’t they?”
Sherlock popped his head up after a short while, his hair soft and frizzy, his eyes groggy with sleep but still somehow bright with concern. He studied John for a long moment, and John wasn’t entirely sure what he was looking for. There was a pinched frown on his lips, as if preparing himself for disappointment. John might have been worried that he was unwelcome in Sherlock’s bed, but the man was still clinging to him. Eventually, Sherlock seemed to relax, and his frown softened into something else entirely.

The two of them pushed their way up to the bar. Crowded as the place was, they still managed to remain beside one another.
John leaned back, and when he did so, he ended up sitting with his hips pressed right up against Sherlock’s. It was obvious at that point that they were both incredibly aroused, and knowing that he wasn’t the only one in this state sent another spike of need through Sherlock. John groaned at the contact, too, and Sherlock was certain he had never heard a more erotic sound in his life.
“I didn’t think you’d appreciate being slung over my shoulder,” the firefighter told him with an obvious smile. Sherlock recognised that voice, but when he tried to say as much, he only ended up coughing more. “Don’t try talking just yet. I’m John Watson, watch manager for this group of men. We talked on the radio about a week ago. You called me Captain.” Sherlock nodded to show that he remembered the man as they started moving toward the exit. “I’ve been tracking your progress on this case, you know. You’re brilliant. Really, quite impressive. I knew you’d be amazing after we talked, but I didn’t expect you to actually put everything together like this.”
Sherlock blinked for a long moment before looking up at John. “You’d do that?” he asked, as if surprised that John would even consider putting in that minimal effort in order to keep them connected during his military career.
And that was how Sherlock ended up leading a soldier on leave into his flat on Montague Street.
Sherlock fixed his eyes firmly down on the table.  John would surely side with Seb on that one.

“You’ll be good at that,” John said, staring again, and he meant it, though he was fairly certain that Sherlock would have been good at anything, clever as he was. He turned to his teammates. “When we first met, it was because I’d texted the wrong number, and this one”—he nudged Sherlock with his shoulder—“was able to tell me what I’d been doing the night before and all sorts of things about myself. Bloody genius, he is.”
Sherlock blinked down at the radio for a moment before tentatively saying, “I could have done better in person, you know.”
To: Sherlock Holmes <sh@thescienceofdeduction.co.uk>
He wore thick boots, dark jeans, and a checked shirt. He had a slight hunch in his shoulders that indicated that he worked at a computer for most of his day. He obviously hadn’t shaved in several days, probably hoping that his stubble would make him look more masculine in spite of his soft jawline and long eyelashes. Gay, clearly, but struggling with it, as he had attempted to make himself outwardly appear just like any other straight man. If Sherlock had to guess, he would bet that this was the sort of person who would feel so threatened by their attraction to men and so emasculated by their profession as to lash out at those he found appealing. A solid bet that he was the killer, then, although there was still no proof.
The kiss started almost gently, as if John was testing whether or not it would be permitted. When Sherlock kissed back, John made a sound low in his throat that set Sherlock’s blood aflame. After that, “gentle” wasn’t really a key factor anymore.
John snorted. “I certainly hope so. Next time this happens, we’re just going to show up, make out in front of everyone, and leave. It’ll be our cheapest night out yet.”
Sherlock’s head snapped up, and he was prepared to shout at the person who had so rudely intruded on his space.  The words died in his throat, however, when he saw that it was John Watson himself standing there.
With Sherlock’s cheeks now a charming shade of pink, and with that furrow in his brow still there, John went up and ordered them two fresh cups. When they came up, he realised that he’d forgotten how Sherlock took his coffee, something that had been revealed during their text conversation but had slipped through his memory. Damn. He’d been doing so well at deducing Sherlock. John made sure to grab several packets of sugar and cream in order to account for any possible preference as he brought their drinks back to the table.
Hell, John felt sorry for Sherlock, too. He heaved a sigh. “I know. I wouldn’t want to talk to me, either.”
John grimaced. “That sounds like something out of a sci-fi film.”
“Oh,” Sarah said, and John forced himself to look away from Sherlock and over at her. She was clearly adjusting to this new information. There was no trace of her usual subtle flirtation anymore. She was clever enough to recognise that there was something going on between John and his new associate.
John didn’t end up making Sherlock sleep in the upstairs bedroom. When Sherlock had informed John that he’d made the bed up there in case John wanted to sleep alone, John had been so horrified that Sherlock had thought he might want that that he took him to their bed and kissed him softly for nearly an hour.
When he started to move, he was slower than he usually was. Previously, they had fucked. They had had sex. They had done all sorts of wicked things to one another. This, however, was something sweeter. Perhaps it was because this was John’s last night with him. In the morning, he would accompany John back to the airport, and they wouldn’t be able to see one another until the end of his tour. That must have meant something to John, for this was—as far as Sherlock was concerned—the first time they had ever made love rather than just had sex.
John kissed him again, and this time it was a bit sweeter than before. John was gentle, his hands simply stroking Sherlock’s skin, as if trying to soothe him, and Sherlock let himself be soothed, eyes falling shut and arms coming up to wrap around John’s waist. He let out a gasp at the feeling of John’s thick and sturdy trousers brushing up against his exposed cock. John smiled against his lips at that and nudged Sherlock back onto the bed. Sherlock went easily enough and propped himself up on his elbows so that he could look at John.
Everyone in the room, including the forensics technicians who had been busying themselves in areas of the flat as far away from Sherlock as possible, stared at John, who was standing there as if he hadn’t just offered a profound insight.
After they had both changed, John into a jumper and jeans he’d owned for ages and Sherlock into a well-fitting suit that Mycroft had apparently purchased for them, John took Sherlock out to the closest available park. It was a pleasantly warm day outside, the sun shining, a gentle breeze rolling through, and John was confident that both bees and dogs would be in abundance in the park. God, he couldn’t wait until he saw Sherlock’s face when they finally laid eyes on the creatures they so loved. Their walk to the park was a quiet one. It had been a long time since John had been back home, but this was Sherlock’s first time ever in a major city, and their eyes were darting around, taking in all that there was to see in this metropolis. John admired how they were able to become so absorbed in observing London while still maintaining their outwardly human appearance, and he fell a little bit more in love.
John Watson could be. Granted, John hardly seemed to put much effort into being good for anyone else, but with Sherlock, he was a veritable white knight. Sherlock had the sudden urge to kiss him, and he might have done it if he hadn’t been so worried about the fact that he hadn’t brushed his teeth in three days.

On their second round, though, Donovan smirked at him and said, “Never have I ever been in love with my best friend.”
“You don’t strike me as that type, either,” he told John, clearing his throat one last time.
“Oh, come on, you don’t even
[12:07AM] You’re such a sap, counting our first interaction as the moment to celebrate every year. JW
Sherlock scoffed. “Right, well, I suppose that’s why your species hasn’t yet managed to travel to the edge of the galaxy.”
“You said you weren’t finished with me yet,” he explained.
Sherlock merely glared at him. “So you mean to tell me that my skin is only halfway done burning off,” they muttered.
Feeling a bit bold, John put his hand on the small of Sherlock’s back as he led them into the restaurant. Sherlock didn’t appear to object, though he did stiffen momentarily before relaxing again. John wondered if he’d ever been on a date with someone who truly fancied him before, or if he’d just been with withholding men. Well, though John had never been good at expressing himself openly, he could at least offer Sherlock tactile acknowledgements of his affection. He wasn’t going to screw up a second attempt at a first date with someone as incredible as Sherlock by being too reserved.
[4:50PM] It’s possible that I was slightly aroused. SH
Sherlock should have anticipated that there would be some resistance at this crime scene. For the first arson in this investigation, Lestrade hadn’t even gotten the call about a potential murder victim until the body was already in the morgue. Their visits to the scene had taken place long after the fact. This time, though, Lestrade had been notified right away once the body had been located in the flames, and he had called Sherlock in only to find that the firefighters weren’t yet done.
“That’s not it at all,” Mycroft informed him calmly. “Our parents had an unconventional pair-bond. They’re monogamous. They lived together and raised us together, and they openly loved one another.”
John wondered about Sherlock’s parents. He imagined that Sherlock had only met one of them at best. They’d likely grown up in a distant household before being sent out on their own. “Well,” John said, “I think Sherlock Holmes suits you.”
John shook his head. “No, I mean go out on dates.” He smirked. “But if those dates end up the next morning with us sharing breakfast, I certainly wouldn’t complain.”
“We really need to work on your ability to whisper,” John said between giggles. “Did you see her face when you deduced her illegitimate child?”
John got better, and Sherlock got better.

“Maybe he’s embarrassed,” Mike offered over drinks on a Wednesday afternoon, because John was
“You’ll like it,” John assured. “You like fruit, and it’s just a lot of fruit warmed up with a crust.”
He pushed Sherlock’s cheeks apart licked a broad stripe from their testicles to their perineum. Sherlock whimpered, the noise growing louder the closer John got to where they wanted him most. John looked up to find them twisting their upper body around so that they could look down at John. John smirked and, keeping eye contact with Sherlock for as long as possible, flicked his tongue over that tight little hole. Sherlock’s whole body shivered at that, and they let out an entirely inhuman noise. Encouraged, John licked again, now spending more time simply teasing Sherlock’s rim. About a minute in, Sherlock was already a quivering mess, letting out
“Morning,” Sherlock said, marveling at his ability to speak without feeling totally drained. “You slept on the sofa.”
John had merely smiled. “That’s not the point of this,” he had said.
Sherlock stayed where he was, pressed against the wall, because he wasn’t entirely certain what else to do.  He didn’t go to parties often, and he had no interest in socialising with anyone else that was in attendance.  He merely hoped that John actually planned on returning to him at some point.

Confused, John nodded. “Sí, es mi nombre.” How had this man known who he was?
[3 September, 7:17PM] Don’t be ridiculous, John. I could never find a better price than yours. SH
When Sherlock looked away from his retreating form, he noticed that Donovan was staring at him with something akin to a devious smirk on her face. “What?” he demanded, not liking that expression at all.
John narrowed his eyes. “You mean to tell me that for twelve of the twenty-four hours you’ve been here, you’ve been capable of speaking to me, and yet you haven’t bothered to do it?” That felt like some sort of sick mind game, and he didn’t appreciate being kept in the dark with something like this.
The alien scurried off into one of the rooms, and John let them go, figuring that they would want to explore the place before settling down. Later, though, he would have to double-check all the rooms to make sure they weren’t laying eggs in a bed or something. He’d surely lose this job if alien larvae started hatching while the researchers were attempting to conduct their work.
John smiled, seeming relieved at Sherlock’s show of intellect. “That I did, yeah.”
And that was as much as Sherlock could handle. He dropped his head back against the door and cried out John’s name as his orgasm ripped through him. He rode out the waves, grinding against John’s hip as he did so.
The Yarders used to invite John out fairly regularly before Sherlock had fallen, and while John had gone a few times, he had never seemed overly interested in attending. “They just play teenage party games all night,” John had told him, and Sherlock had no idea what teenagers would even play at parties, so it sounded doubly unappealing to him.
In which they catch a killer.
As he sat back, though, he noted that the world seemed to spin a bit more than it should have. He had only had one drink, and he had eaten earlier that day in order to prepare his body for the consumption of alcohol. There was no reason for him to be feeling drunk.
[4:26PM] Spoken like a true romantic. SH
To: Sherlock Holmes <sh@thescienceofdeduction.co.uk>
John did laugh, then, but how could he not? Sherlock sounded so incredibly petulant right then over something that was hardly a great concern. It was rather cute. “I’ll tell you what,” he said, “when we get to town, the first thing we’ll buy will be an umbrella for you to use. That way you can block the sun on the way back.”
John didn’t seem bothered in the least by Sherlock’s tone. Instead, he smiled a bit, bringing his eyes up to meet Sherlock’s. “If it’s all right with you, I might just look at you all night,” he said, clearly teasing.
John couldn’t help but smile. He shouldn’t have been so pleased at Sherlock’s apparent desire to take on a human name or the permanence that it implied. “Do you not have surnames where you’re from?”
—” And then he was coming without a hand on him. His eyes wide, pure pleasure flooding through his veins, he cried out as he made a mess of himself.
“Please,” Sherlock gasped out, squirming underneath John. John’s mouth was close enough to his cock at that point that Sherlock could feel every exhale against it. He whined again, hips moving seemingly of their own accord.
Sherlock wasn’t entirely sure of anything after that. Given what he knew about himself, he was fairly certain that he had just remained in that spot, going over what had just happened again and again and again, all while John carried about his business and eventually departed. When Sherlock’s blinking eyes focused on the physical world once more, he noted that John and his tools were gone and that he was still holding his wallet.
