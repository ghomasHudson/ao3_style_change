He opens his eyes slowly, finding himself swathed in a set of thick winter jackets, standing in the middle of what seems to be like a forest.
YQ: You haven't updated your fic since i last checked haha. Why not um break the chapters up into smaller chapters.
At that time, it'd felt like butterflies had filled his stomach, his body filling with a golden warmth. But now… it just feels hollow and empty, an embrace filled with sorrow and loss.
John flings himself onto the bed, curling up into himself as multiple scenarios of Sherlock leaving him race through his mind.
John strokes the smooth skin with his palm again, his fingers outstretched, bracketing them as he bends to press a kiss to the dip of skin at the top of Sherlock’s buttocks.
There’s another long pause before John rips his phone away from his ear. He gives one last fiery look at the piece of metal before setting it on silent and stuffing it roughly into his shirt pocket. His resentful look morphs slowly into one of resignation as he heaves a little bit, eyes fixed resolutely on the carpet as he does so.
“Is this about Jem?” he questions timidly. His eyes are a glossy red, synonymous with at least several hours worth of tears. He looks absolutely distraught.
Sherlock heaves a deep sigh as the rope finally comes free, his wrists and ankles sore and an angry red as he pushes himself away from the chair, falling into John’s open arms.
They’re on a highway of some sort and judging the flow of the traffic, they’re not going towards London, but rather away from it, the scenery rapidly morphing from that of a concrete urban area to that of a vast countryside…
Now it’s Sherlock’s turn to tear, his vision going misty as he wipes away the streams of tears that are streaking across his cheek.
“That was a moment of weakness,” John responds, shaking his head, “That was the night before I left for Har- I mean Mycroft’s. I was really regretting having married Mary at the time, because god I had you back and all of a sudden, I realised that you had legitimately all I could have ever asked for in a partner and I’d let you slip through my fingers.”
He’d believed wholeheartedly that the two of them would make it back from Appledore whole and well. That that would be the end of an endless cycle of unhappiness for both of them.
And with that, John plops down onto the bed, rolling onto his side as he covers his head with his blanket.
Sherlock all but yells in response, his body hanging taut like a string on a bow before he all but explodes, sparks going off behind his eyelids as his hips rise up off the bed, his cock pulsing into John’s mouth as he moans breathlessly, his chest heaving.
Smirking gleefully, Sherlock flashes John a wide grin before grabbing the pillow, proceeding to bring it down right over John's head.
John smiles up at him, giving him a thankful nod before retrieving his suitcase, hauling it into the room with him and out of sight.
“Uh, yeah, about that,” John said, motioning at Sherlock’s fingers that picked at the green material. “I just thought you’d appreciate saving some modesty. Hope you don’t mind.”
“Good Omens? Hell yeah! I loved that show last year!” he said, seating himself into a cross-legged position in front of Irene.
Cage didn’t cry out, because he wasn’t human and possessed no nervous system. Instead, he saw it as victory, no matter that he had to use his arms to crawl around, and an angry vengeful Alex Hirsch beating him with a piece of elongated wood.
Silence. John was the first to break, shortly followed by Sherlock. The bed was creaking under their shaking bodies, their laughter bouncing off the walls. The crickets and frogs outside croaked undeciphered conversations as the boys calmed, clinging to their embrace.
“Why did I just see a man marry a beaver?” Irene asked no one in particular, wishing to erase this from her memory. If only there was a serum for that…
She found Mike and Molly effortlessly, the two of them standing at a stall that had giant stuffed hybrid unicorn-crocodile-bears hung up. They were standing shoulder to shoulder, laughing. Oh, adorable twats. They have no idea that a train called Irene Adler is about to hit them harder than that slap Hermione gave Malfoy in the prisoner of Azkaban. She debated whether to announce herself, just in case it ruined the mood and Mike wouldn’t ask, but he can pop the question after he wins Molly over by getting her the abominably cute creature, no?
“Thank you, Greg,” John said, hoping to convey enough gratitude in so few words. “I… I’ll consider it. You gave me the weirdest deja vu feeling ever. Like we talked about this before, hah.”
In addition to his improved mood by this spectacular development in the lore of Reichenbach Falls, he got to relive his second happiest memory twice in a row! The first one was, obviously, conquered by a number of fragments concerning John: namely those when he’d asked Sherlock out on a date, when he’d patiently reassured that he did want to pursue him and have a date, and when they’d kissed in the rain. Irene might have a point. Perhaps he
She left for the prison cells, and Sherlock’s steps trailed towards the exit. Out in the fresh air, he absentmindedly walked down the stairs and stopped on the sidewalk. He was so sure his plan was going to work out, but basic human interaction has failed him.
“Accident, Wilson?” a ruff-ruff of a doberman said, transcribed in the subtitles of the show. He walked to the body and sniffed at it with its pointed snout. He turned his damp head at Wilson standing by. “Or is it…. Mur-dur?”
of all places, Irene lost her balance and eeked as she fell backwards, fingers digging into Sherlock’s white shirt. He caught her by the arm, her karate leg thumping painfully to the ground, much to his satisfaction.
“We were fourteen, Irene,” Sherlock reminded her, plopping down on his bedding. The mattress below creaked. It was a matter of time until one of the springs tore through and caused an injury. Fun.
“Hm…. No, I don’t think I’ll let you,” Freddie said cheerily, leaning on the microphone stand. “After all, you can’t even move unless I allow you two.” To demonstrate his point further, he snapped his fingers and it felt as though invisible weights sat on their laps, immobilising them.
He watched her from the corner of his eye as she put her headphones into her hoodie pocket. It looked atrocious. The hoodie was
“I just had the weirdest deja vu,” John said, basking in the sunlight. “As though we already were at such a party before.”
Sherlock swung back into the hall, leaving the girls to their devices. As they walked back to the theatre, he paused, head turned to one of the racks standing slovenly on the side. Bubble wraps hung over the top, reaching the ground. Most of the air pockets had popped or expired.
They returned to the living room together only to discover Irene dumping a bottle of red glitter on top of the coffee table. Sam was nowhere to be seen. Dean hissed and hurried to the girls side, telling Cas to make sure the dogs were in the kitchen behind the barrier so as not to ingest the material.
Driving around the streets aimlessly for a while allowed Seb to think his plan through in stages. The most important task was to time everything perfectly. Magnussen’s fake charity fundraiser will take place on the twenty-fourth of August, and if Seb wants to take Greg Lestrade out of the equation and kindly evict him from his shaky house, he’ll need about two days in advance. Technically, he’d be able to get the deed by the twenty-third and subsequently have the catering agency and the rest done in less than a day thanks to the help of a special
Sherlock’s shoulders sagged, fingers toying with the extinguished candle in the middle of their table. “Why are you friends with me? I’ve always been the odd one out, and the few ‘friends’ I thought I had always gave up on me when they realised I wouldn’t simply change my personality to something they considered ‘normal’.”
“There you are, Watson!” said Greg, grinning happily. He was also carrying a bag. So no luck with finding Sherlock or anyone else yet. Greg seemed to be reading his mind. “I walked from the back here, no sign of Sherlock or Carl.”
Sherlock hummed and walked over to his step-sister, long fingers carefully dividing her thick mane into three even parts. Irene could do it herself, but she preferred when somebody else could overlook the process. Sherlock practised braiding her hair since they were children, and he became quite good at it. He flipped one thick strand over another, rhythmically tying the hair in place so that it wasn’t too tight, but neither too loose. He tapped Irene’s shoulder once he got to the end, palm turned upwards as she placed a rubber band in it.
Sherlock smirked and his back straightened a little. “Transfiguration is one of the more interesting subjects, and McGonagall is a very competent teacher. Though I have suggestion on improving some of the old-school techniques…”
“Nope, I want Rosie to have a trip. She likes the lights and decorations, and you do too, you closeted sap.”
“You’re no fun,” Sherlock frowned, but tugged him closer. “Ooh, there’s apparently a bird colony to the west of here. They’re harmless, but very chatty. Should we pay them a visit?”
Just as she left the living room, the man Sherlock guessed to be Mr. Lestrade came in from the other side of the room, carrying a can of soda. He acknowledged them with a nod as he stepped closer, and Sherlock observed him.
As soon as Sherlock came into view, she shouted an excited, “Dada!” and she outstretched her own tiny, thin arms as Sherlock ran forward and pressed her against his chest.
“All the world’s a stage, darling,” Freddie said, flipping the microphone from one hand to the other. “I moved in as soon as people thought vampires or whatever those fuckers were started residing here. And look around, it’s lovely!”
Aunt Martha appeared in the kitchen shortly, wiping her hands on her apron. She was the sweetest person Sam had the honour of knowing so far. He was careful in his approach to her; a part of him was paranoid that there was a catch, that she’d turn out to be a ghoul like that unfortunate case with Adam, or something else of that nature. He treaded carefully, and while Dean loved her ever since her shocking revelation, Sam wanted to be cautious, even if it made him feel torn.
Sherlock smooths his fingers over John’s face gently, blushing slightly before moving on to examine Major Sholto.
John sighs. It’s not the “oh god Sherlock why would you do such a thing” kind of sigh but rather the joking “what am I going to do with you Sherlock” kind of sigh so Sherlock smiles in response.
“You’re so tight,” John moans, pistoning his cock in and out of Sherlock’s body, “So fucking good, god-”
“Because it contains such ingredients. I try to choose products that weren’t tested or made immorally. Thankfully more companies consider the vegan option nowadays.”
“Good thing I’m studying fashion,” Irene said, pursing her lips and whirling on the balls of her feet to push through the crowd. “Excuse me! Your future designer is coming through! Make way unless you want me to go full Sharpay on you!”
“Any clue why that is?” John asked, looking at him in the rearview mirror. His brows furrowed minutely before he returned his attention to the road. “I can’t believe your wings fit in the car.”
“If you wish. So, what’s up with you two? How’s your date going? I half expected you to be snogging on the couch by now. Amateurs.” Sherlock groaned; John giggled.
There was a petroleum lamp on the table opposite, its warm light illuminating the limited space Sherlock found himself in. Peculiar, he’d never seen one before. The shoddy hunter that captured him hadn’t been given one, which was a disappointment to Sherlock’s innate curiosity. Oh!
“We’ve got two shovels, one is broken in half,” Dean started naming their arsenal. Sherlock glanced inside the bag which was full of guns as well, but he didn’t care to inspect the types. “A rake, a hatchet, this weird rounded scythe you connect with communists, hedge shears, flower shears, and a bulb planter.”
“You okay?” Andrew asked, a concerned furrow deepening his bushy eyebrows. Molly nodded, corners of her mouth lifting, but then she winced when her cheeks moved upwards and pressed on the assaulted area. “Good thing I have this ice pack with me. Hey, how about we sit down for a while? We haven’t talked in ages. How are you doing?”
“Back up,” she patted John’s shoulder, leading them further from the pit for a moment. When she was sure it wouldn’t shoot hellfire at them, they peered in. “How are we feeling, Nicky?”
“That woman over there by the cat food has forty-seven of them,” he said, pointing a finger at the older lady in a huge, pink coat. “People would say she’s crazy, but that’s just a stereotype. And why? Because most people are quick to judge and cling to societal judgement that ostracizes anyone who isn’t like them. Crazy cat ladies are said to have lost their marbles, which is an idiom for implying someone who is bonkers, but that lady over there is the CEO of a fashion company. You can tell that by her outfit, and the brand, plus the way she confidently carries herself around. She likely has no children and the cats are a replacement, but she takes great care of them. She has the means to do so.”
to take Rosie while he went to pay for food and then presumably buy their daughter a toy for Christmas! And she was
“Irene’s new rival,” Sherlock said, chin jerking in Janine’s direction. “She’s insecure, you can see how she keeps readjusting her clothes and tucking her hair behind her ear. It’s a facade.”
Sherlock grabbed the tennis ball and walked to the windowsill, standing up on the narrow piece of wood. He maneuvered himself so that his back was turned on the red and purple glass stained triangular window, the rest of him facing the room. He was directly in front of the closed door, John on his right sitting cross-legged on his thin duvet. They looked at each other, smiled, and John nodded.
Sherlock blinked, a faint blush climbing up the length of his neck. He cleared his throat and walked up to John. “How do we get to the other side, then?”
He received an invitation for a secret meeting of pure-blooded Seventh Years last week. It took place yesterday, and he refused to attend. It was managed by a Slytherin Head Girl whose ego skyrocketed Mycroft and Sherlock’s combined. She had tried to recruit him over the duration of their final year, but she just simply wouldn’t get the memo. At first he brushed her off as obnoxious and an idiot, but it turned out she is far more dangerous than expected. That’s why you never underestimate your rivals and enemies.
The bathroom door creaked open, and wet footsteps, one, two, three, echoed until the door burst open and a beam of light illuminated the room. John flipped the lightswitch on and froze like a deer in headlights. Sherlock propped himself up on an elbow and saw that he was clutching a white towel around his waist, still semi-wet from the shower.
Sherlock leaned on his shoulder, and John rested his cheek atop his soft, lavender smelling curls. He loved that shampoo on Sherlock. “John?”
The wind was knocked out of him before the realisation settled in. Sherlock registered a thump against the hard wooden floor and a pair of hands pulling him up. His torso
With the sun so high up in the sky, the temperature had gotten unbearable with every turn John took, no matter that his face was caressed by the soft breeze he ruffled by swinging to and fro in the glade. Once he’d had enough, he stopped and hopped down, face flushed with droplets of sweat on his hairline.
“Sorry again,” John repeated his apology, and Sherlock suppressed the urge to roll his eyes. Yes, he didn’t want to get attached to John Watson, who shamelessly invaded his mind after one short interaction. Unfair. But. He didn’t want to be rude to John, so he kept his mouth shut about tedious repetition.
Cas rolled his eyes but stayed put. It was nice having Dean this close to him, comforting even. Not quite a hug, but it might as well be one. Irene smiled at him when their eyes locked, but her mouth was tense. Dean dug into his jeans pocket only to realise he left his phone at the Shack. He pointed at Irene and dictated his brother’s number.
Sherlock stirred and smacked his lips, but he didn’t wake up. If anything, he tucked in closer to John’s side. The arm wrapped around John’s chest tightened for a second, then relaxed again. John pressed a kiss to Sherlock’s temple and arched his neck to see where his phone was. It rested on the coffee table, a little off-bounds and out of John’s reach, but with enough mindful extrication so as not to wake up Sherlock he managed to get a hold of it.
"We're sorry for breaking the school rules," John said, eyes on his shoes. He was genuinely sorry - and he felt bad for waking his Professors up.
The sky outside changed from a bright yellow noon sun to an orange dusk, sun rays shifting their angle to match the time of day. The stained glass of the windows coloured the beams further and Sherlock watched them penetrate the stilled air inside with primary colours of the rainbow. All six were aligned in such a way they ‘cut’ across the vending machine.
Mr Ripper went on, and the camera followed him as he sat down on a gym bench. Blurry figures of men doing their exercises using available equipment moved in the distance. Mr Ripper licked his mustache and pointed a beefy forefinger at the audience.
Night was in its wake and something malicious hung in the air; wicked even. Suspense could be cut with a knife, that’s how much of a trouble this has been. A click of heels rattled the staling air as the police officer’s shoes glimmered in the artificial light supplemented by the forensics team.
“Don’t take this the wrong way,” Lestrade said, appearing from behind Sherlock as he slammed today’s fresh print of newspaper, circling the table to sit next to his nephew, “because I appreciate your thoughtfulness,” - he took a bite out of a rolled up pancake - “but you do more than enough as it is. I don’t need you cooking breakfast for us.”
“You know, that’s another good point,” she continued, stepping down from her stool. She had to tilt her head up to look Sherlock in the eyes. There were crinkles around her dark brown, welcoming eyes. “If the girl does turn out to be a vampire, and a dramatic one who bites the dust
John rolls off him, landing back down on the bed. He sighs happily, the corners of his lips upturned but his reverie is cut short by a mouthful of cotton.
It also didn’t help that ever since the third week of their acquaintanceship, something in their relationship had undergone a dramatic change, giving John something he couldn’t have possibly dreamed of when he’d first met Sherlock.
Interestingly, Watson seems to come to a quick conclusion on… whatever it is he was thinking of because his eyes light up all of a sudden. He flashes a knowing look Sherlock’s way as he turns to face him square on once again.
He finishes with a huff, waiting for John to respond, silently seething even though he knows he’s responding irrationally.
Thankfully, John answers his question for him. He shifts to face him, eyes widening slightly before quickly morphing his expression into something more neutral. Is his wound really that ugly? Sherlock angles his face downwards. It’s a mess of rough, pink-ish skin with a shallow crater in the centre, same as it’s always been. Sherlock has no issue with this, he really couldn’t care less about his transport. But does John find it repugnant? The thought makes him cringe. No, he can’t possibly, he’s probably seen worse on the battlefield. But then why had he given Sherlock
Something must have happened last evening, something that had startled John so much that he’d decided to call the clinic to take leave… But what could-
“Look, Sherlock, all I’m asking you is why you cared about my wife so much, or at least appeared to-”
Sherlock can’t look away even if he wants to, not this time. He watches John as his features shift and morph in shadow, his chiselled chin beautifully defined as they move closer to the lamplight.
“You’re extraordinary,” John grins, wiping up the mess in between them, “You really are something else.”
There’s an uncomfortable silence as Cameron’s glare seems to falter. “I,” he stutters, “I. No. I- She never told me about her, about that.”
Sherlock pores over the package, observing the the quality of the envelope and type of adhesive that had been used to hold the flap in place.
Come to think of it, Mary might even abscond from the country with her daughter, leaving John wracked with guilt in the wake of her absence. It seems a likely possibility, since she’s lived overseas before and Sherlock cannot afford to risk that.
“Thanks,” John replies, giving her a thumbs up with his face still plastered to the table, “I appreciate it.”
“Sherlock it’s okay really,” he shakes his head, turning around to face his roommate once again, “Just go off with Victor. I’m okay on my own-”
John had turned to him just before they’d walked through the threshold, smiling as he pulled the door open, waving Sherlock in. Their eyes had met for a moment, a brief moment, but Sherlock remembers it all too well. When their eyes had connected, it had felt like a zing of electricity had passed from John’s body to his, sparking a warmth in Sherlock’s chest that he hadn’t felt in a long time.
John frowns, his brows furrowing as he opens his mouth, as if about to say something but Sherlock hurries on, cutting him off.
There was something about his father, something about the openness and the sincerity of his gaze that had drawn him towards him, a gaze that parallels the looks that John gives him now.
“So Sherlock, dear brother,” Mycroft starts, pivoting himself on his elbows and leaning forward, “Do you know why you’re here today?”
John closes his eyes, concentrating for a moment, fixing his mind on the walls, the bed, the curtains…
He wants the room to look as inviting as possible. After all that John’s been through, after that whole ordeal-
The room begins to rock once again, startling Sherlock as the intensity of the shaking seems to have increased substantially from the last time.
Sherlock fixes his brother with a dirty glare as he rises from his seat, maintaining eye contact till Mycroft turns his back to him, affording Sherlock one last grave nod before stalking down the hallway.
“John,” is all Sherlock says before he reaches for John again, pulling him down against him. His lips move in time with John’s, his kisses tinged with desperation as his tongue slips past John’s parted lips.
“Here, let’s share,” he says, handing the pair of chopsticks to Sherlock as he shifts the packaging towards Sherlock’s side of the table.
Ugh, there are two likely answers - Moriarty and the drugs that he took. And since he’s not particularly in favour of discussing the latter...
“They’re such a vibrant shade of blue,” John breathes when Sherlock opens his eyes once again, staring up at him with something akin to wonder, “So bright and dazzling and - there are galaxies in your eyes I swear. Nebulas and supernovas and fuck if I could count the number of times that I’ve gotten lost in them…”
John’s brain seems to come instantly back online, his eyes widening as they finally focus on the room around him.
Sherlock picks up the clear glass photo frame, wiping away the thin layer of dust as he peers at the photograph.
He wipes his eyes and they come away wet, inciting him to scoff softly at his transport’s annoying and unwanted display of emotion.
Forensics determined that they had died on the bed, side by side, stating clearly that their bodies hadn’t been moved post-mortem. The pictures on the other hand, indicate that they had died with their fingers laced together, their faces inches from each other.
Sherlock sighs into the kiss, surrendering himself to John’s lips as the man proceeds to kiss the corner of his lips, then the middle… then the top lip… followed by a prolonged suck on the bottom lip.
He makes towards his bedroom but feels a sudden, warm weight on his shoulder. “Stitches remember?” John says, resting his palm on Sherlock’s shoulder as he waits for him to turn around. “Don’t want them coming undone, do we?”
“JOHN PLEASE- I-” Sherlock continues to whine as John slicks up his cock, aligning the head with his entrance, “Oh god-”
Sherlock motions to John who takes his cue and rises from his seat. Sherlock walks over to Cameron’s front door and holds the door open wide, waiting for John to stride past him before finishing, “This is hardly a suitable place for a conversation dealing with the death of your best friend.” He pauses for dramatic effect before continuing, “I suspect the interior of a police station might be a tad more conducive.”
He’s nestled comfortably in John’s arms, tanned skin meeting pale white as John’s arms stretch around his torso, holding him close.
John buries his nose in Sherlock’s curls, inhaling deeply as Sherlock gasps, his hands instinctively reaching for John’s sides.
John presses Sherlock’s hips down with his other hand in response, his fingers digging into his hip as he turns to Sherlock, smirking.
“John, god please touch me-” Sherlock whimpers, reaching for John’s hips. But John shifts out of the way, deftly avoiding Sherlock’s grip as the man whines, thrusting up into thin air.
3. Past perfect tense is a bitch. I literally gave up at one point. This is when a beta would come in handy HAHA. I'M NEVER DOING THIS AGAIN
But John either doesn’t seem to remember or ignores the connotations behind the words entirely. He chuckles softly, before replying, ”No, we’ve had a scan. We’re pretty sure it’s a girl.”
Well, there’ve been some experiments that he’s been meaning to try, but they no longer hold any appeal now that John isn’t around.
John shifts his thigh all of a sudden, moving his body upwards to gain more leverage on him, his groin brushing against Sherlock’s navel and that’s when Sherlock realises that John is rock hard, the bulge in his pants pressing firmly down onto his stomach.
The house is at least a century old, but for such a relic it’s surprisingly well kept. The brick exterior of his house still a spongy red, unaffected by moss or mildew or even wandering ivy. The garden has clearly been well cared for too, even though Mycroft has no interest in gardening.
Which is strange, since this has never happened before - him waking when the light outside is dark. Normally, he’s the only one who has the power to change the time of day in his world.
Looks like I'm not gonna make it HAHA. (soz like if you follow my tumblr you know I've been away for most of the month)
And just like that, Sherlock had gone stiff. From the thrashing wild mess of a few moments earlier, his whole body had suddenly gone ramrod straight, his breaths stuttering.
“I’m here,” he whispers when they part for air, John sobbing loudly now as he gives in fully to his sorrow, hiding his face in the crook of Sherlock’s neck as he begins to howl, his voice raised to the heavens as tears begin to roll hotly down Sherlock’s cheek.
He doesn’t elaborate further and Sherlock doesn’t probe, watching as John shuffles toward the bedroom door.
He’s never been good with words either and he hopes that John can similarly feel the pain, sorrow, hope and love in his kiss that he’s feeling from every press of John’s lips to his.
“I had all the details perfect,” he says, trying to ignore the dark look that Mycroft currently has adorning his face as the man takes a seat next to his, glaring down at the ground as if it has personally offended him. “I was there, all of it, everything! I was immersed.”
He gives one final sideways glance in Sherlock’s direction before letting the door slam shut behind him.
John had licked his lips, his eyes riveted to Sherlock’s, their gazes locking as Sherlock stared at him with something almost akin to hunger.
It contains a bottle filled with pills of shapes and sizes. The colours all belonging to drugs that Sherlock recognises.
“But you’ve only just been told,” Mary interjects, taking the seat opposite his, “We’ve only just found out. He’s on every TV screen in the country.”
“John,” Sherlock whispers. John really sounds angry this time, is this when he decides to leave? Sherlock can’t take it. He’s sure that his face is revealing way too much right now. He draws his legs up to himself, burying his face in his knees. Dammit, John wasn’t supposed to find out this way.
He steps forward, over to the edge of the cliff, his footsteps sure and certain. Going by the thread of his subconscious, which is taking risks and facing his fears… This seems like the best and only option.
John's emotions are extremely complex, fluctuating within mere seconds. He could be angry one moment and sad the other and Sherlock wouldn't be able to figure out exactly which was which.
His eyes are starting to close, fatigue starting to overtake him and before long Sherlock finds himself floating off to sleep.
“Sounds like a good idea,” Sherlock intones as he carries the mugs towards the sink, “would you prefer Thai or Chinese?”
Sherlock debates the possibility of lying to John. After all, talking about “The Fall” could only possibly aggravate the situation rather than make it any better. He goes over it for a while before replying.
They’ve changed so much as people… more so as a unit. There’s a tether of trust tangling the two of them together, a shared love that had always existed now brought to the light of day.
“Come on Sherlock, you know exactly what I want to talk you about,” the harsh voice at the other end of the line says. “I know he’s staying with you,” she finishes.
Sherlock comes first, followed by John, the two of them groaning into the shared space of their mouths before John crumples, tumbling forwards onto Sherlock’s body.
“Your room?” John murmurs against Sherlock’s skin when they part for air, his face now buried in Sherlock’s neck, “Do you have-”
“I… Well…” Sherlock stutters before forcing his face into a tight lipped frown, his right eyebrow twitching slightly with the effort as he barks:
He whines softly at the loss of contact, saliva cooling on his reddened lips before John is there, on top of him, pressing his lips firmly to Sherlock’s again. Wrapping a hand into Sherlock’s hair, John’s fingers tighten around dark curls as he runs blunt teeth over Sherlock’s bottom lip, biting down gently, mimicking what Sherlock had done before.
“Go ahead and take a seat in the armchair while I set things up,” he finishes, stepping towards the bathroom as John smiles wearily, making his way towards the window.
“Can’t explain right now,” John answers, his tone clipped as he steers Sherlock towards the stairs, “It’s a long story and I think you’ll want to have a full presence of mind when you hear it.”
“Did you really love Irene Adler that much?” he blurts out, still refusing to look Sherlock in the eye.
There will be one short epilogue following this. IDK when on earth it will come out... but it will... eventually HAHA. I might end up writing more stories in this verse though. Maybe one where John acts out all the naughty things he suggested to Sherlock and vice versa when they were texting each other. Who knows?
John frowns, still seated as he turns to face the mantel. Sherlock narrows his eyes as well, scrutinising the package from his seat.
John smirks, turning to face the glass casing as he struggles to rein in giggles while Sherlock continues.
One of his hands is clutching the neckline of John’s singlet. His fingers are curved and digging into John's skin, stretching the neckline down to rest level with his own chin. He must have done this during the night because he would never have done this consciously. NEVER.
“If we know where the stars are, we’ll always be able to find our way back home,” he always called to Redbeard, his faithful first mate, who yelped in response every time he proclaimed it...
And come to think of it, he’s infringed on the sanctity of John and Mary’s marriage enough already, allowing himself to partake in semi-dubious activities with John. He’s shared a bed with him, cuddled with him and even kissed his wrist once. But if they were to dance, without even “marriage preparation” as an excuse- That would be way too intimate, even for Sherlock, bordering on even coercing John into infidelity in his terms.
“It was foaming at the mouth, clearly infected with rabies, so I ran, calling Redbeard to follow me.”
“Stop talking and start doing,” he purrs, stroking the right side of John’s face and pressing his lips to John's once more.
It was the adrenaline rush, the deductions, the dry wit... everything! Everything that was Sherlock Holmes just seemed to resonate with him on some higher emotional plane that John had yet to give name to.
“Sherlock, please,” John pleads. His voice breaks, losing its firm tone, leaving it hollow and empty. Sherlock would go so far as to say that John sounds… afraid.
He sighs, reaching an inquisitive finger to a small puddle of come, swirling the sticky fluid in something akin to awe before bringing it to his lips.
5. If you follow me on tumblr you would know that I said this chapter would be over 10k but no it's not. That's because I decided to divide the plot up a little bit more which means you guys are getting the next chapter sooner than normal! Yay! Hopefully by next week if nothing goes wrong uwu
John thankfully relents, withdrawing his fingers slowly as Sherlock hisses, feeling the loss viscerally.
He’s about to toss the shirt and jacket away before Sherlock rests a hand on his arm, tugging at it gently.
It has a full page advertisement for a weight loss programme printed onto it, with a smiling woman in the centre. Sherlock upends the bottle, allowing some of the liquid to drip onto the sheet of newspaper. They watch as the lady’s smile starts to swiftly disappear, leaving the spot where the liquid had fallen a dirty white.
“That's nice to hear,” John answers, leaning forward, like a predator leaning for the kill and Sherlock has to rest a hand on his shoulder to prevent him from doing anything stupid.
John is silent for a moment before clearing his throat. “I knew you always had a thing for Greg,” he says.
He blinks sleepily, watching John's face swim into focus. Their eyes meet, their gazes locking. There's an expression there in John’s eyes that Sherlock’s never seen before. His pupils are blown wide, the whites of his eyes a mere afterthought. His mouth is slightly agape and his cheeks are flushed and Sherlock finds that he's drawn to this undisguised look of… something…
The hinges creak from disuse as Sherlock shoves the door open roughly, the wood from the top of the door flaking off as it brushes against the door frame.
He flits through the store, pausing and staring at the array of gems up for sale, each glimmering brightly in the show lights.
Sherlock can tell that John is struggling to hold back tears so he threads his fingers through one of John’s hands, holding it close to his thumping heart. John seems to sober a little in response, the “lub-dub” of Sherlock’s chest tethering and grounding him back to reality.
At this, he raises up Sherlock’s deerstalker, tossing it towards him. Sherlock catches it easily, slipping it on with a smile on his face, a warm, fuzzy feeling settling in his chest at Watson’s declaration.
“HE HATED YOU,” she all but yells, “He hated your drug habit, hated the way you always seemed to care less about him, he hated you, Sherlock. He fucking. Hated. You.”
“I’m certain you noticed it, or at least guessed something,” John chuckles sadly, pressing a kiss to the shell of Sherlock’s ear. “We were sort of on and off during our time in Afghanistan. We became friends after a particularly dangerous mission got us talking.”
“No,” he murmurs, lifting his lips to John’s shoulder, pressing a firm kiss to the skin there, “No it isn’t.”
But then again, he'd suddenly brought up the fake suicide again yesterday, causing Sherlock to second guess himself on whether John had really made peace with the situation.
“David doesn’t clean and he definitely would have no reason to even clean this bathroom unless someone came over. And almost no one comes over. In brevi, it would have been extremely easy for Mary to hide something here if she wished.”
“I’m there for you John,” he continues as John starts to sob, his voice loud and pained, tears staining the front of his shirt as Sherlock continues to hold him, “I’ll always be there for you.”
“So Victor is doing fine?” he queries, his eyes fixed on the table before him. He doesn’t feel hungry anymore.
“Your lips,” he moans, dipping a finger down to Sherlock’s entrance, circling the raised skin there for a moment before pushing in.
Sherlock moves to stand, rising from his seat as he lifts his gaze to The Bride, schooling his face into an impassive mask of indifference.
He wants it more than anything, wants breathy exaltations whispered into the shell of his ear, wants to lose himself in sweet, gentle caresses and soft moans, wants to feel the searing pain of being marked and loved and taken and oh god he wants it all, all of it.
“Nothing so far,” Mycroft answers, “We’re currently doing a sweep, my agents will notify me immediately if they find anything.”
He’s obviously not hiding is very well because John sighs softly as their eyes meet, his blue eyes mellow as he bends to press a pregnant kiss to Sherlock’s forehead.
The hand in Sherlock’s hair tightens at the sound, tugging at the tuft of curls there gently as Sherlock whimpers, his eyes screwed shut as John chuckles, shifting off to press a soft kiss to Sherlock’s lips.
He looks on as Victor says something, prompting Sherlock to shake his head, shushing him quickly as Victor laughs.
He gets two pots of water boiling, one for the noodles and one for the soup, waiting till the water bubbles over before dumping in the noodles and seasoning.
John chooses that moment to slip in his finger up to the hilt of his knuckle, the rest of his fingers continuing to stroke the rim of Sherlock’s entrance and Sherlock very nearly screams, his cock filling out to full hardness.
“So you did do that experiment on purpose!” he says, his eyes sparkling humorously, “I knew it! I knew you did it on purpose”
“C’mere,” the man murmurs and Sherlock obliges, sliding up the tub so that he’s resting up against John’s body.
He steps towards the aisle, fumbling slightly. He’s still a little disoriented but that can be fixed. He shakes his head, standing up straight and regaining his balance.
He drags his nose across the seam of scalp that denotes Sherlock’s parting, closing his eyes and taking a deep breath as Sherlock’s moans.
John’s lips are trembling as he struggles to talk. He moves his jaw, his lips but no sound escapes. John puts his arm forwards, reaching for Sherlock, before hastily withdrawing it. He turns his face away from Sherlock, looking down steadily at the white bedsheet.
“I’m assuming that the only reason the head of the British government is unable to coerce necessary information out of a respondent is because they hold similar power themselves,” Sherlock mocks, glaring contemptuously.
He stops counting, his brain going temporarily offline. One of John’s hands is clutching the torchlight and moving dexterously over the surface of his skin but the other hand, The Other Hand, is currently resting, palm-down, on Sherlock’s chest - right over Sherlock’s heart.
John has always given Sherlock a particularly hard time when it comes to picking out his true feelings.
“Murdered. In his own home,” Sherlock intones, watching as the images eventually cycle back to the huge block letters, “Killer unknown.”
“Do you know how much I love your nipples Sherlock?” he begins, his eyes focussed on the puckered nub of skin there, “God they’re so sensitive...”
“It’s just that you were tearing a bit there,” John continues, finger moving to imitate a falling teardrop. “Are you really alright?” he says, still looking slightly worried.
Sherlock shuts his eyes at the memory, a single tear falling from the corner of his eye as he ploughs on.
“Elementary, my dear Watson,” is all he says before he pulls off his deerstalker, flinging it down into the rushing water below.
He picks at the drawer handle absent-mindedly, listening to the tapping of his nails on the wood before tugging on the handle, sending the drawer flying open with a rattle.
“Mo… morning,” Sherlock replies, his response punctuated by a particularly loud yawn as he struggles to gather his wits.
“When he died, she lost her protection,” Mycroft segues in, “And to make matters worse, there was a business conglomerate who knew all her secrets… so she went into hiding.”
Nodding his head in reply, Sherlock turns his attention back to his phone, watching as John does an exaggerated yawn out of the corner of his eye, collapsing onto their bed with a loud ‘thump’.
He steps out of bed gingerly, feeling the warm carpet shift under his feet as he makes his way to the bathroom.
Sherlock lets out a soft sigh, turning to face the window instead. He watches as Mary beams and waves at them as the car trundles away, her smile unwavering even as they turn into the intersection.
Sherlock sighs, twisting over on the sofa so that his dressing gown twines around him like a blue, silk cocoon.
“You’re beautiful,” he murmurs just as before, except that this time, he’s fully expecting Sherlock to bolt.
The sky is a beautiful pastel blue, airbrushed with fluffy, cotton-candy clouds that stretch far off into the horizon. The air is crisp and chill, smelling sweetly of grass and wildflowers, although that could possibly be because they’re in the countryside away from the foul London air.
John had done this before, a long time ago. When he’d just arrived back and Sherlock had cooked him breakfast. How times have changed.
But enough of that- Sherlock remembers his childhood in fragments of happy and particularly bad moments but there was always one memory that had always been one of his favourites. He remembers watching his parents as a child, half-drunk and giddy with delight one Christmas evening as they swayed to slow music, swirling circles around each other. His father sure-footed and graceful and his mother fumbling precariously every now and then as they waltzed around the room.
“Well,” Cameron chokes back a sob. “She’s my best friend, or she was.” At this, he drags a sopping wet tissue out of his pocket and blows into it quite vociferously. “We’ve known each other since kindergarten. We met one day playing on the swings and…”
“I- I” Sherlock stutters, his face growing redder and redder as he sinks further into the chair. “Look, we did actually get caught in a traffic jam, alright? Victor wanted to go to this Pokestop on the other side of town so we drove down but ended up getting caught in a traffic jam coming back-”
There's a taut, uncomfortable quality to John's gait, as if the man is filled with crackling energy he’s been repressing for a long time.
The lift door dings as it opens, the steel doors revealing a rather worn out looking John Watson, startling Sherlock for a moment.
“Oh god,” Sherlock moans as John begins to draw deep circles with his fingers on his scalp, his brain short-circuiting immediately with the sensory overload.
“That’s alright, you always make the best tea anyway, regardless of the blend. What was it you tried to teach me the last time again? About the temperature? Something about-”
But he’s back here now, back in his childhood home, surrounded by familiar scenery and smells, comforting him in a way that the atmosphere of 221B Baker Street has failed to do in the past three weeks.
“What do you mean?” John pipes up, confused, “David’s already explained it all, she just needed to shower and rest-”
He panics a little, wondering if John will realise that he’s using borrowed words, mistaking a simple joke for a statement that he’s still not ready to give. Oh god, even his subconscious is trying to wrestle him into a confession.
Fuck. He’d opened that blog post just after he’d taken off, hoping to find some solace in John’s old writing. It had worked, for a while. Well… until Mycroft had called him at least.
Sherlock doesn’t need to think twice, his fingers shaking as he hastily unbuttons John’s shirt, button after button popping till John is left in nothing but a singlet.
And as an added bonus, Victor must be pretty cerebral as well, one has to be to discuss anything Chemistry-related with Sherlock Holmes.
He closes his eyes, breathing in the scent of the flat one last time before shutting the door, each clunk of his boots on the wooden steps sounding far more ominous than usual as he traipses down the stairs.
Contrary to popular belief, Sherlock does know how to cook. After all, the process of cooking does adhere to similar principles that chemistry does. He retrieves 3 eggs from the fridge (which were originally meant for a salmonella culture), 2 slices of bread from the bread box (which were actually meant for a mould-related experiment) and an onion (which still smells edible but has been there for ages)
“What a pity,” Sherlock replies, his voice still sounding rusty. He shifts so that he’s now sitting up, facing John. “I never liked that jumper. I thought you would have at least thrown it away after that fiasco.”
John moans in answer, his thrusts speeding up as Sherlock gulps, a little unsure of whether he’s going in the right direction.
Hope you guys like this chapter! And also in light of recent events, hey, nothing is going to stop me from writing more of this. Regardless of what TPTB says, these characters may belong to them but they are shared with us, and I'm going to do whatever the hell I want with them.
He’s half out the door when he hears the rustling of bedsheets, signifying that Sherlock has gotten out of bed.
He takes one last look at John, flashing the man one last grin before bending his knees, launching himself off of the cliff.
He didn’t even get to dance that day, didn’t even get to drown his sorrows in flighty, giddy footsteps that would have helped him to forget John, forget Mary, forget everything.
“John,” Sherlock starts, watching as Mycroft stalks off, leaving him and John alone in the foyer, “John, why the hell am I here.”
“So, here we are,” he begins, his eyes flickering around the airfield before they alight on Sherlock’s, their gazes locking and Sherlock finds that he’s at a loss for words.
“I don’t want to miss anything,” he says, “Sherlock, I honestly do not give a shit about my reputation. I don’t fucking care if Mary attempts to incriminate me.”
“I hope you’ve figured out what you’re going to say to them,” Mycroft breathes, flashing Sherlock a forced grin, “We’ll be forced to depart soon after they arrive due to the air traffic, so I do hope that you’ll make optimal use of the short time you have left.”
“Didn’t you hear me?” John says assuredly, his voice remaining bold and resolute while carrying an undertone of affection.
John huffs, watching as Sherlock grabs a napkin, wiping his chin swiftly before passing the container over to John, handing him the chopsticks.
“Sure,” Mary answers, flashing John a wide grin, “It’s okay, I understand… So you’d like to drop me off at home first?”
John drops his bag beside the door and stands at the threshold of 221B for a moment, gaze sweeping hungrily over the surface of the flat, as if committing it to memory. He takes a deep breath, smiling softly and Sherlock suddenly feels a burst of warmth in his chest. John is back... he is finally back where he belongs and Sherlock feels like his insides are being coated with molten gold.
Stepping onto the crisscrossing steel grating of the second-floor platform, Sherlock gulps as he tests the rusted floor before him. It should hold, hopefully, otherwise gravity will do Mary’s job for her.
John flashes a wide grin at him in response and does he… does he wink? At him? Before leaving the room?
He’s positive that Sherlock has never mentioned a “Victor” before and as far as John knows, there isn’t any Victor in their year.
The only way is forward and hopefully, he’ll be able to fix this, fix all of this and have his and John’s lives back in one piece. However, righting his wrongs seems like an impossible venture right now and Sherlock isn’t sure if he’ll ever be able to completely reverse the effects of his actions.
John takes another shuddering breath before burying his face deeper into Sherlock’s shoulder, his arms coming to clutch him tighter as if he’s afraid that Sherlock will disappear into thin air. Sherlock places a hand on the mesh of John’s hands that have wound their way around his waist. His breath stutters for a moment before he replies, “You’re welcome.”
John reels back the moment Sherlock mentions the word “Mary”, the disgust in his posture clear as he visibly retreats inside himself, struggling to come up with a response to Sherlock’s declaration.
But no, it had been necessary at the time, to hide himself away from the world, way before John Watson had come into his life and shone a bright light on him, encouraging him to express himself as the shadow of a human being he used to be before Redbeard had passed away.
“Oh god that explains why he was so terrified of you at the wedding,” John laughs, “I had been wondering-”
“I mean… do you think things would have turned out better for us if we’d made different choices earlier on?”
Sherlock, seemingly sensing a disturbance in the force, opens his eyes. He frowns at John for a moment before pressing a kiss to his lips once again.
At this, he motions to Cameron who scowls unhappily. He drags his feet towards the open door, sneering at Sherlock who promptly shuts the door behind them.
“Then we’ll be ready,” Sherlock answers firmly, squeezing John’s shoulder, “I promise you, John, nothing will ever keep us apart.”
Making his way towards the car, Sherlock feels the December chill eating its way into his bones so he flips his coat open, slipping it on dramatically.
And that’s when the room really begins to shake in earnest, sending books and ceramics tumbling to the floor with simply the force of it.
“But one afternoon, I saw the reeds rustling by the side of the creek. Thinking that it might be a nesting bird, I went closer to check. But when I parted the reeds, there was this dog there…”
“That’s really nice of you John,” he says, his voice cracking, and John almost forgets how to breathe.
They’re both dressed in their army fatigues (hell John really looks fit in them) with an off-white concrete wall as their background of choice.
There was nothing then, nothing else to keep them apart. With Mary and the baby sorted out and Moriarty finally dead and gone, there had been no more reason to hold back, no more cause for hesitation.
He pauses for a moment, wondering if Mycroft will finish this deduction for him. However, Mycroft remains silent so Sherlock continues.
He’d been positive that Sherlock would complain about the stench, that he’d try to chase John out the moment he’d stepped into the room, so John had made a mental map prior to his entrance as to where all his bathing materials and clean clothes were, ensuring that he would be able to make a quick getaway.
“Yeah, it was because of that and… a few other reasons,” John cuts him off once again, except that his cheeks are now flushed a little pink. It doesn’t take a genius to figure out what one of the other ‘reasons’ was and Sherlock dips his head in embarrassment, “One of them being the fact that she gave me a dud thumb drive. That really tested my patience.”
John goes silent. He uses his shirt sleeve to wipe away the tears that have gathered at the base of his face before continuing, “You could have at least told me, could have at least contacted me somehow…”
“Controlled usage is not usually fatal, and abstinence is not immortality,” he says, although his voice sounds a little softer than before.
“Sherlock!” he yells one more time before the sound of his voice is muffled by hard wood as Sherlock slams the door leading to his bedroom. He bolts it in place, sinking against it as he heaves heavily.
Sherlock groans, the sound muffled by John's lips as he reaches around John's torso, fingers raking up and down his back as he arches up to meet John chest for chest.
“And yet she had no singing lessons,” Sherlock grumbled, grimacing painfully as she failed to hit a note. Even John flinched at that too, while Irene smacked Sherlock’s arm.
Lestrade looked inside the fridge for a can of soda which he promptly drank in a few long gulps. He pinched the bridge of his nose and sighed.
"He's yours, so figure it out. My boss doesn't know about any of these magic shenanigans and I don't want to risk my promotion in case things go South."
“Explains a lot. But what does that mean? For us and for you, Cas? It’s one thing for a town like the Falls to exist, but having an angel hibernate in an exotict, hidden bird sanctuary is the single most random thing I’ve ever heard. And I’ve been hunting for
He opened his eyes, and when he looked up, Dumbledore was smiling at him. He took the Sorting Hat and put it in its place, returning to his desk.
“Easy there, Sherlock. But good, at least we know your legs didn’t give up on you. Do it again, right leg. That’s much better. Take it slow.”
Mrs Hudson blushed crimson, and both Kate and Greg giggled. Irene fetched Greg’s phone which lay on the table and handed it to Mrs Hudson. “Let’s call Angelo, hm?”
"Just be careful yourself," John added, disappearing into the kitchen. Sherlock swooshed past Harry over to the coffee table where a small mountain of papers and documents was spread out. He fished out a wallet and a pocket knife.
“My ass sold it, huh?” John laughed, getting an eye roll out of Sherlock. “Also, another thing. I want to persuade Greg to go on a vacation and take Mrs Hudson with him. Maybe Florida. He’s burning out and I want to see him taking better care of himself. He’s been working like a dog for years, he deserves some proper peace and quiet.”
Sherlock exhaled through his nose. There’s no getting out of it now. Besides, they did share things with each other, they were always there for each other. They survived their studies in Canada by sticking to each other, how was this any different? “Fine. But let’s go somewhere more private.”
“The circumstances weren’t exactly joyful. He and… his partner helped me get away from my abusive husband, you see.”
“So you were the first to activate it,” Cas said, arms crossed. “Then Irene, and then John. This can’t be coincidental, but I have never heard of such a phenomenon. I’m absolutely out of my depth here. All I know for sure is that my instinct tells me you three are significant in this scheme, on paper or literally. The triangle inside especially seems forthcoming and taunting and familiar.”
"John, help me!" he hissed as he struggled on the ground. If this happened, say, during Transfiguration or Defense Against the Dark Arts class and a teacher was present to easily diffuse the situation, the whole ordeal would be funny - unfortunately, that wasn't the case.
“She’s a relative from our mother’s side of the family,” he explained, thinking of the tiny scratch their father scribbled at the back of one page in his very own journal. He never mentioned her, never sought her out… why not? Now that he and Dean knew that their mom was from a hunter family, was it possible that their aunt knew their way about the supernatural world like them? “But we’ve never met her before. It was a coincidence when we went over our dad’s journal shortly before the Gloria Scott case. But then the Disneyland case came up and we couldn’t stay for longer, so we decided we’d come around.”
“Yeah, why not? Sherlock may scoff at it, but I like to give things a chance before writing them off.”
“But you haven’t even read it properly,” Irene pointed out, nodding at the shreds of useless paper in his palms. He scattered them outside the window. The pieces flew into a bin strategically placed right under it. Greg usually threw his finished cigarettes in there. Irene was being a smartass, but that was an Adler-Holmes family characteristic he knew very well.
He nodded at the TV where Dean got up in the face of the camera, raging, poking the screen and yelling at Gabriel to zap it. Sam was in the background facepalming and wearing a t-shirt sporting a logo of some medicine for genital herpes. Cas had his angel blade out and ready to throw hands (or grace?).
“If you think for one second I’m going to judge your own confusion over John and you, then you’re wrong,” she said sternly. Sherlock bit on the inside of his cheek. “You’re scared to get hurt if you attach yourself to this. You made it clear you don’t want a casual fling, but you’re being an idiot ignoring the
so fidgety. And something told him he knew what was going on. The helpless, cute look he gave to Sherlock betrayed him enough, in fact.
Redbeard jumped around them, barking, begging to be included in the game. Grace’s paws and nails dug into the floorboards as she walked up to John who aimed it to the kitchen. He crouched and petted her gently, scratching her behind the ears. Her eyelids fluttered and she tilted her head to enjoy John’s ministrations. She reminded him of Jasmine a lot.
Not waiting for definite answers, Irene rushed to where the supposed soda stall was. A woman in her thirties operated it, handing out drinks on request, all non alcoholic. Irene stood in the queue for a good five minutes before she could order. In the end she decided to buy two bottles of cooled mineral water and one more cup of the delicious lemonade Molly had brought her. She thanked the woman and deposited both bottles in the pockets of her shorts (she had to sew them on herself, stupid modern fashion still hasn’t comprehended that women want POCKETS in their clothes) while she held the cup in her left hand.
“You have nowhere to hide,” Cas said, drawing nearer to the muddied Barbie doll. The actor’s picture on the doll’s face was soaked wet and tearing apart. Cas flexed his fingers. He might tear his limbs apart piece by piece just for the sheer satisfaction of it. Sadistic? Maybe. But he deserves it for attacking John and the rest of the house and causing a racket. Cage’s plans were poorly thought out.
“I thought you were going to snatch her wig with that file?” John said, an adorable crease forming between his eyebrows. Sherlock wanted to kiss it away.
“Sounds good,” Carl nodded, finishing his slice of apple pie. “To be honest, I can’t believe how come she’s teaching here. Her style is so…. uncharacteristic.”
! Sherlock didn’t want to face that. Not yet. He can’t have his happy bubble pop and shatter today. Not when he opened up his small, shy heart. What did people do when they wanted to have a serious talk? Speak in private. Exactly! Sherlock will be able to avoid it as long as they’re in company… And he won’t have to listen to John take back what he’d said, or talk down to Sherlock because he thinks he’s weak…
John shrugged. “Lots of them are,” he muttered ambiguously. Irene thought she should ask a question to explain what he meant, but decided against it. John mentioned his parents weren’t the most supportive, maybe it was for the best if she didn’t dig it up.
Irene and Kate crouched and started showering Jake with love and affection, cooing over him and petting him whatever they could reach, scratching him behind the ears, his back, rubbing his belly, under his chin…
“That’s nothing new with Sherlock,” Irene smiled fondly. Sherlock and his experiments -- at least he had someone to talk to about it now. Even better that John took interest in it too. Or maybe not the dirt so much as Sherlock… “We still haven’t bet on them.”
“Is that all?” Sherlock asked monotonously, his blue and green eyes boring into the angel. Cas nodded weakly. “This is the first time you’ve been contacted, yes?”
Simple statement. That didn’t prevent Sherlock from snarling back the usual retort, “Obviously! I’ve never even met him!”
“Smartass. Why would I break up -- not scratch that, it’s ridiculous. I’d never break up with you. And this is nothing! Seriously, we just wanted to have fun and it went a bit wrong, but no harm no foul. You’re not the only one who messed up today.”
Fortunately the trapdoor collided with the wooden figurine, trapping Cage in-between. Unable to move into either direction, the demon cursed, swinging the axe in the process. Just as John’s legs twitched in his direction to kick him six feet under, Alex beat him to it.
“Feels better, doesn’t it?” asked Irene, smiling at Grace who had tiny water droplets stuck on the fur under her chin. Sherlock wiped his hands on his jeans; they were dirty enough already for him to care about their state. Git, it’s not even like he’s going to wash them himself.
John facepalmed, startling Irene next to him into a pained gasp of sympathy. In that moment, a cracking sound prevented him from swearing out loud -- the trapdoor evidently had enough of Cage blocking their way and snapped shut despite his obnoxiousness.
“It’s not even the season?” he said, casting her a quick glance before limping his way to the front door. Kids these days. Mixing up events of the year, though he can’t blame Irene. Opening the door, Greg welcomed the local postman, Elwood Rogers. “Hi, El. What’s up?”
“Yeah, we’re social like that. But hey, hugs help. Sherlock and I have this unspoken rule we pick up on when we need a hug, so we can have one, too! Just holler if you feel like crap and I’ll give you the best hug ever, alright?”
Irene descended down the hill and picked up her pace so that she arrived precisely at one o’clock. No sight of Mary, however. Should she wait outside? She scanned her surroundings for anything that would indicate Mary already came there. Sherlock would undoubtedly pick up on clues already, but not everyone could be a Consulting Smartarse of a genius.
Greg’s and Irene’s shoulders were almost touching, and she suddenly thought it would be great to take a picture of this scene playing out in front of them. She creeped up closer to the hole in the fencing through which the racoon got in and took her phone out as sneakily as possible.
“We’re here, guys,” Mike said, stopping the minivan. John let out a relieved sigh. Thank God, he needed fresh air. Once the courteous goodbyes were exchanged, he hauled one Irene’s hand over his shoulder, Sherlock mirroring him on her right side.
"There is a man on the corner of the street watching the flat," the detective said matter-of-factly, and Harry heard John mumble something in agreement, not surprised.
How are you peeps doing? i was thinking of starting a collection flowers once spring kicks off and press them later, tho we will see how restrictions go
“I’m not sure that’s a good idea,” Sherlock said, crossing his arms over his chest, shoulders slumping forward. “I’m not exactly an extrovert.”
Suddenly, Mary’s demeanor shifted to a more cheerful one. “Why, of course not! Don’t you worry, I’ve no grudge against y’all! I appreciate the honesty, and I’ll think about it. You… Your words do resonate. Thank you. Say hi to John from me, yeah? Tell him I’ll keep in touch.”
“We wait.” Seb shuffled in the narrow width of the sofa to find a comfortable position before flipping Mirage off. “Now feck off somewhere else. I hate when you creep on me while I sleep.”
He promised himself he would never, ever, EVER AGAIN watch this TV show. How was it still on, anyway? It ran like, what, the fifteenth season? Did the actors even age?
“It’s merch. It’s Karkat and Dave from a webcomic called Homestuck,” Irene replied dryly, crossing arms over her chest. She slapped Janine’s hand away when she attempted to grab at the material.
“Is this about your made-up profession again?” Irene sighed, massaging her temples. Sherlock has been musing about it since he was ten years old. He used to watch criminal shows all day long when Mummy allowed it and if he did his chores first. He had always liked to solve the impossible, and he did get better at it with age. But with his maturing came displeasure when the realisation that not everything was as good as it seemed had hit him. Thus began his journey to become the best crime-solver in the world. The world’s only
thought Sherlock bitterly. But John was right, it wouldn’t help anybody if he kept going off tangents. In a way, he was like his conductor of light, shining through the fog of his mind when it clouded and showed the correct direction. Yes, it still made him tetchy when he was in John’s proximity (Who wouldn’t be? Have you
“Hey Blake,” Draco said suavely, watching him collect tomes and newspaper articles five centuries old. Did seriously anyone read that? “Need some help?”
of Irene for this,” John giggled, accepting the smack on his back from her for such an atrocious pun. “I’m not even mad, this is hilarious. Sorry.”
Greg let out an affirmatory sound. “Yeah! Devil Wears Prada was a great movie. Explain yourself, Dean.”
Sherlock assessed the area. He focused his senses on what was before them; the distant sound of foamy waterfall hidden by the rock formulations surrounding the lake, the mist that receded further down the beach where it met the water, and the absence of any wind whatsoever.
“Let me think,” Irene said, sitting down on a log. Mike’s hands absently drummed a rhythm on the wood and Billy beatboxed. “Nicolas Cage has got to be the biggest weirdo we’ve met. He’s basically this vengeful spirit that can possess humanoid objects like dolls, and he has tried to knife us on three different occasions since the first week of July. He has this weird obsession with Greg, saying he wants to be his best friend, but we get rid of him before he can do shit about it. Fuck that guy.”
Sherlock ignored him for the sake of his food, and John made it a  point to bring him some fresh water. Keeping the merfolk hydrated was essential. So far, Sherlock seemed to be adjusting just fine to the land, but John feared what obstacles might arise as they go on. What if someone is looking for Sherlock? Is he important? The next International station from where he could send a message was two weeks away, which could be two weeks too late if politics are involved. Welp. He will talk to Sherlock about it later.
“Yeah, I think it could be fun,” John agreed, looking at Sherlock. He looked genuinely happy at the thought of Sherlock coming along. “I don’t want to leave Irene behind, but maybe you two could use some time apart from each other. She did try to stab you with a fork for the past three days whenever you got on her nerves. And that was…. At least five times a day.”
“I guess we understand more than you expected,” John said, amused by how the tables have turned. He and Sherlock exchanged mischievous glances.
"I thought that was quite clear," Sherlock said dryly. Harry looked at his feet. It still felt surreal that they had an ally to help them. He couldn’t be sure enough.
I'm tempted to post quicker than just every five days, but that would fuck up my schedule, so I guess we all have to suffer and wait until the 30th and so on together, eh?
“I mean, if you want to,” John said hurriedly. “I don’t particularly like when there is an avalanche of people stepping on your toes. But I could fetch us a drink or some food?”
“And here I thought you liked taking risks,” John teased, only to find himself being manhandled on the next step and kissed again. Not that he complained. “Mhm. But really, I should go change. It’s only half past eleven, wanna do something else when we get into pyjamas?”
“When Greg lost his fishing permit -- Jake took it because he was curious what it was. And while I tried to get at Jake for stealing my phone too, I told Greg to tell tourists that we’re de-ghostifying the porch. And he gave me the whole of it for rolling in dirt and dust for half the day.”
“I’ll get it,” John said, throwing the dish towel at Irene as he passed. He called Grace and Redbeard back, but he had to pick the tiny guy up. They had to work on his training. John had an idea of who it was at the door, and the two tall silhouettes confirmed his suspicion. And lo and behold, the Winchester brothers greeted him.
Sherlock shook his paper bag to demonstrate its emptiness. John licked his lips, nodded, and started shelving cereal boxes and crisp packets, either unaware of Sherlock willing him to pay attention to him or willfully ignorant, so Sherlock watched him dance around the kitchen in automated steps and patterns. First John shelved the boxed stuff, then he put the cold things, whatever they were, Sherlock didn’t care, into the freezer, and lastly he shelved the expendables, depending on their origin. The bread belonged in a cupboard a bit to the left of the sink and the ham and sliced cheese into the middle shelf in the fridge. If applicable, bottled liquids were stuffed in the cold too, but otherwise they lay on the counter or under the dining table.
“You know me too well,” he mumbles softly, his cheeks reddening as he buries his face in his jacket, extremely embarrassed.
This isn’t power play, he thinks to himself, not like how it normally goes in these type of situations. Rather this is a prey at the mercy of its predator, the latter toying with its food before it gets eaten alive.
“You must know that he’s dragged me to every single rugby game you’ve ever had, just because YOU were there-”
“GOD FUCK I’M GORGEOUS ALRIGHT. BEAUTIFUL AND PRETTY AND AMAZING AND GOD WHATEVER YOU WANT JUST FUCK ME ALREADY,” Sherlock all but yells, his voice throaty and hoarse and well… that does it.
, he thinks as John’s kisses taper off, his lover moving off to lave attention over his neck instead.
“John, all it says is that he’s going to be hanging out with Victor for a bit longer and might be slightly late for dinne-”
He hadn’t misread them, had he? John had been so full of euphoria over Lily the past few days. What could have possibly happened?
“Don’t worry, I wouldn’t dream of it, I interact with him more than enough on a monthly basis. I wouldn’t put myself in a position where I would be forced to endure more,” Sherlock replies, taking a swig from his water glass.
“No one can hurt you now,” John whispers, his voice echoing around the room as Sherlock shudders at the promise of John’s words.
Pocketing his phone, aware that Mycroft might very well have his phone tracked via GPS, Sherlock rises from his seat, padding slowly over to the bedroom.
His eyebrows furrow for a moment as he turns towards John, his body winding him up tighter and tighter under the weight of his own failure…
“I’ve got to go,” he says almost sadly, his voice weeping through the receiver and Sherlock sighs in answer.
He raises his hands, one hand on one cheek as he squeezes them, his fingers stretching the skin and Sherlock lets out a loud moan in response.
Also your kudos and comments have really spurred me on to write this chapter. Thanks so much for them. They really mean a lot to me.
Sherlock shivers, a wave of finality hitting him as he turns away from the dirt track, his eyes brimming over with tears.
Which means that he will have to relinquish his hold on John at some point. He will have to let John go when the time comes. He will let John go. He will.
. He’s just been shot for crying out loud, not to mention the fact that he’s suffering from morphine withdrawal. However, social norms dictate that he should respond in such a way so he shall oblige John this one time, anything to make John comfortable.
It’s then that John turns around abruptly, the shock in his eyes evident as he stalks over to the sofa.
“Not at all,” he answers, watching with unabashed glee as Watson steps forward, raising a booted foot. He aims a swift kick at Moriarty’s back, his boot colliding with the man’s body with such a force that Moriarty stumbles and flails and finally… topples over the edge of the precipice, down into the pool below.
“Didn’t know you’d be so vocal,” John chuckles, raising a hand to brush away Sherlock’s sweat slicked curls from his forehead as he sits up, surveying his work.
He glances past John, turning his gaze to the block of flats towering over them just outside the car window.
“I’ve had fucking enough!” she cries, her fingers shaking with barely suppressed rage as she sets her finger on the trigger.
He traps the puckered skin between his own, pulling roughly and repeating the movement again and again and again and slowly Sherlock starts to get the hang of it, giving back as good as he can get.
He kicks at the rough gravel adorning the unkempt road with the toes of his boots, sighing as his breaths materialise in puffs of white.
Groaning in answer, Sherlock relegates his fingers to John’s hip, stroking the skin there slowly, as if asking for permission.
To cut a long story short, John knew very well that Sherlock was only ever interested in guys and guys alone. But even though he knew of Sherlock’s sexuality, Sherlock technically didn’t know about John’s.
Sherlock’s breath hitches, his eyes going glassy as he steps back, getting a better view of himself.
“But you can’t do that,” another set of voices in his head cry, “John loves you, he loves you so much. Can you imagine how horrible he’ll feel? How wrecked he’ll be if you tell him the truth? You don’t want that. You don’t want to go off to Eastern Europe knowing that you’ve ruined the best man that you’ve ever had the pleasure of meeting.”
Shivering slightly, Sherlock notes that his head is still covered in sweat, his hair matted against his scalp. John notices this and rushes to grab Sherlock’s shampoo, lathering it up between his hands before hurriedly kicking a stool in front of the bathtub, sitting down and gently massaging it into Sherlock’s scalp.
“Right and wrong,” Mycroft sneers, picking up a sheet of paper from the table, “We’ll get to that eventually but first, your drug test results.”
“I’m FINE,” Sherlock berates, his curls sweat soaked and sticking to his forehead, “Just FUCK ME ALREADY- OHMYGOD.”
“That’s the guest bathroom,” Sherlock explains as he rushes in through the door, inspecting the tiled floor carefully, “David would hardly have any reason to use it. There isn’t even a proper towel rack in this one.
Sherlock kisses him like a drowning man seeking air, like a dehydrated man seeking oasis, kisses him as if the world will end the moment their lips part. He only allows himself small sips of air when they separate, desperate for contact, desperate to have John’s lips back against his.
A dead woman who has supposedly risen from the grave to wreak havoc upon her male counterparts? It’s literally Christmas come early.
He looks happier than he has in ages, definitely much happier than when he had been married to Mary. So much has changed since the day that Mary was finally out of their lives forever. David had taken in baby Lily, caring for her as a single father (Mycroft had helped make some financial arrangements for him to ensure that Lily was well looked after) and John had moved back into Baker Street… permanently. And this time, he had moved all his stuff into Sherlock’s room.
The flat is cold, especially since neither of them had the presence of mind to turn the heating on. And now that Sherlock's chest is exposed, it’s even more noticeable.
Oh so she hadn't heard him after all, thank god. Sherlock heaves a sigh of relief before Mrs Hudson’s eyes lock onto his, her razor sharp glare boring into his retinas. He can't help but choke back a gulp.
John seems slightly taken aback by the gesture. He looks down at Sherlock’s hand, confused, before he stretches out his arm, grasping Sherlock’s hand firmly, gripping him as if he’ll vanish the moment he lets go.
He sighs as the water engulfs his legs, swathing them in warmth as he bends down, adjusting himself till he is lying down in the tub. He grabs some soap from the dish built into the wall, rubbing it against his skin as bubbles begin to fill the top layer of the tub, hiding his body from sight.
“Wait… Sherlock how long have you been playing for exactly?” John interrupts, his voice tinged with worry as he whips his face upwards, peering anxiously at him.
“Hmmm… didn’t know you were sensitive here,” John murmurs, kissing the arches of both of Sherlock’s ankles as the man in question moans, “I’ll have to keep that in mind for future reference.”
Sherlock’s eyes travel down his compact frame, southwards towards the bulge in his pants and upwards towards the muscles on his chest. Sherlock’s gaze lingers on his jeans for a moment before he gulps, his pupils expanding as he fixes John with a pleading look.
He sighs deeply as he makes his way into the bedroom, hurling the pillows into the corner chair as he removes the sheets, dragging them off the bed roughly and dumping them onto a pile on the ground.
“Oh god, I can’t take it anymore fuck her, oh god,” Sherlock croaks, on the precipice of a meltdown.
“You’re beautiful, your voice, god, it's so deep,” John groans, burying his face in Sherlock’s collarbone as he continues to roll his hips, thrusting up into Sherlock’s body, the man clearly wrecked beyond the point of return, “You’re gorgeous… MINE.”
“No, that’s not the issue,” John blurts out, sighing deeply, “I’m fine with the prospect of being a father now. It’s not something I’m uncomfortable with but it’s just something I don’t quite… want anymore, especially with Mary.”
“You’ve got a question,” he says smoothly, straightening his back as he turns to face John, his friend’s eyes’ wide.
“No, I wrote all that,” Watson says, interrupting Sherlock’s thoughts as he sits up a little straighter. “You’re quoting yourself from The Strand Magazine.”
However, John has somehow obtained a notebook and pen (Sherlock should really clear out the mess that is their kitchen table) and is staring at Greg with rapt attention, ready to take notes at the tiniest notice. Sherlock smiles at this, relaxing slightly in his chair. It seems like John has made his decision.
“Okay,” Sherlock responds softly, shifting backwards into the house, giving John an invitation to come in, which he takes gladly.
And when had the music stopped as well? Because the flat is now silent, save for the sound of John’s breaths, coming harsh and fast from exhaustion...
He reaches into the fridge, listening as the shower clicks off as he dumps a ready-made sandwich into the oven.
He is seriously so sick of her patronising attitude and frankly, his patience is starting to wear thin.
“Well what is most interesting about this case is not the abundance of evidence… but the lack of it,” Sherlock starts with a grin.
“Professor, if you wouldn’t mind stepping away from my friend,” Watson says firmly, “I do believe he finds your attention a shade annoying.”
as they appeared to come to a deadend. He prodded the wall before them only for it to yield softly under his fingertip. “It’s tapestry,” he said, walking to the corner and gently pushing forward until a weak beam of orange light peaked in. Sherlock cautiously peered out to see whether there’s anyone waiting. “All clear.”
to get interesting. Two can play the matchmaker, as Irene had pointed out. “You haven’t called Harry in a long time, as far as I’m aware.” A very, very long time, in fact.
Castiel’s grace held up the lily pads long enough for them to backtrack to the pier unharmed. Marina the bitchy cursed mermaid disappeared to, presumably, sulk or throw a tantrum in her underwater cave, and they could breath freely. That is, if Castiel didn’t erase her from the face of the Earth.
Sherlock flopped back on his chair, his good mood flattened by the undignified entrance of John’s grunkle who didn’t offer much in the form of aesthetics this morning. He slept in, but it did no service for the bags under his eyes or his greying hair. If anything, it seemed to have silvered further since the beginning of summer. Old man, his grunkle. John rolled his eyes and continued eating his toasts as Greg walked over to the coffee machine and considered the stale brown liquid that floated in the glass carafe.
Blake was in a frenzy, lightly said. In other words, he spent most of his waking hours in the library researching dragons of all shapes and sizes. He was up to
Sherlock rolled his eyes, but the sharp edge wasn’t there. He locked the doors behind John, huffing as he stood up. John knew it wasn’t his fault he couldn’t keep Sherlock from getting harmed, but he couldn’t help himself but to curse at the thought of something worse happening to him. They knew each other for a short amount of time, and already he couldn’t picture life without Sherlock. God, he makes it sound like he was going to die today. Well, almost. But John had it close too. The scratch on his clavicle proved that.
John opened the bathroom doors and peered out to see Sherlock sulkily leaning against the wall opposite. “Sorry,” John said, “forgot to mention Irene has new friends over.”
Irene carefully turned the knob and invited herself in. She saw Greg rest his forehead on the door’s flat wood, his shoulders sagging as he exhaled. He didn’t hear her come inside.
“Sherlock, you delicate, utterly dummed dummy-dumbass. I recognise mutual attraction when I see it, and this is it. You’re both adults to make a committed relationship work, whatever it takes. Plenty of people date in uni and they’re happy. Why shouldn’t you? Don’t let fear stand in the way of your happiness.”
. He couldn’t care less about dying right now, he achieved happiness beyond the realm of this universe.
Sherlock gave a shrug, the voices outside becoming louder the closer they approached the house. “I can easily beat her. We’re both stubborn, but at least I’ll test her limits.”
A dangly hand rose from the closing secret entrance, and soon Cage’s head and half of his torso popped up into view as well. “
"Hurry up, John!" Sherlock whispered to the Gryffindor who found it difficult to walk silently if he had to run since Sherlock's legs were so damn long.
John patted his ankle and lightly massaged his lower calf. Sherlock purred. “I’ll spoon feed you if necessary. But I liked it too. You did great with your deductions.”
Later that day after John’s Mum left for another nightshift at the hospital, John finally got the chance to show his friends some
“I call it the Johnlock Roulette because they are unpredictable, the idiots. Any estimation? In days, perhaps?”
His breathing was shallow and ragged, chest rising and falling as he was calming himself down. Then he outstretched his hand to Irene. “Phone.”
Greg blew out a puff of air. He desperately needed another cigarette, but he forgot his pack at the Shack. “I don’t know. The kids can’t know that
To be honest, Sherlock’s fantasies have been frequent. Very frequent. They practically never ended, he’d be a fool to claim that falsehood, but he could also pretend to be a Victorian maiden who’s modesty has never been questioned. The fact that John was a great kisser that made him weak in the knees didn’t help. It just fueled
Yes, that’s an easy way to go about it. Draco stalked out of the library, making his way downstairs to the dungeons. He needed to write a letter. Crab and Goyle were who knows where, so he had time for himself. While at it, he may write a separate letter to his mother, see how she’s doing and whether there’s anything new that piqued her interest.
John gave him a hard look. “Yes you will. You can’t live on ice cream alone. And you have a moustache from slurping that ice cream and caramel.”
Suddenly, a feeling of fullness and expansion filled Sherlock’s insides, and the rope around him and John tensed, making it harder to breathe. He jerked his head aside to ward off his unruly curls, but they seemed to be shortening…. The potion! Its effects were finally waning!
He saw John looking at him, head tilted, chin resting in the open of his palm as Sherlock swallowed the last bit of the dried meat. They stared at each other for a few seconds before John cleared his throat, licked his lips, and came hither with more water to drink.
“We all do. He’d love to be here, and call me sappy, but I’m sure he does remember you, somewhere behind that wall of trauma.”
He slept for about four and a half hours. He put the phone down and tried to drift off to Dreamlandia, though, truth be told, he considered ‘dreamland’ to be wherever it was with Sherlock by his side. Which was now. He could die in peace, sporting a gorgeous boyfriend like that.
Irene chewed on her cheek. “Okay. So that implies angels are quite different from humans. I mean, that’s a given, but this is fundamental in itself, right?”
John wheezed for air, but that didn’t stop him from throwing creative cuss words at Cage. Another lighting struck in the distance, followed by a loud clatter of thunder. Cas’ right wing was free of restraints. And it was
“Yes, debatable, and yes. They’re conventionally hot, I’d say. Their sexual orientations, well, I do get vibes, but I don’t want to assume. With John I got confirmation right away because I pried, but in his case I just
And so, Sherlock found himself nailing DIY signs to pine tree trunks half an hour later. It was chilly, crowns of the trees shielding the forest floor from the sunshine above. There was even mist floating low above the ground in the darker places and shrubs. Sherlock held another shabby sign against a tree trunk with his left hand, taking a nail from between his teeth and hammering it roughly a couple times before it was steady.
“You didn’t think my impulse kiss to your temple was inappropriate?” Sherlock asked, confused. This wasn’t really a friendship protocol, was it? But as the fatty piece of meat that reigned his nervous system and powered his body woke up, it struck him in its completeness. “Oh…”
,” Irene said, voice low in pretense of being deadly serious. She pointedly tapped the top of the freshener to urge the answers out of the strange racoon.
Likewise, Cas gave up his consumption of human food after three bites. This ruse was for Greg’s benefit; if he came in and saw others dining except for Cas, it might raise questions. Kate and John ate their whole portions, while Sherlock played with the food, using his fork to move it around. He finished it when John glared at him, pretending he didn’t exist.
“I’d say it’s about time to hit the archives and libraries,” he said, getting a nod from John and Cas. Sherlock bounced onto his feet, scrambling towards the closet to pick out his clothes.
“Our racoon friend is doing great!” Will exclaimed giddily, pointing a thumb over his shoulder in the proximity of the book. “Has a bit of a difficulty reading a few letters and distinguishing them, but otherwise? He’s a fast learner.”
Kate did a cute, simple makeup routine for Mrs Hudson. She did the woman’s eyebrows, gave her the most perfect winged eyeliner, though it looked subtle enough to be seen as a mere highlight that brought out Mrs Hudson’s pretty eyes. And just like Greg, she chose the option of lip gloss instead of a lipstick. Kate’s colours were apparently too bold for the upkeeper, but Kate agreed with her. Overall, the touch-ups took less time than what they spent on picking the dresses, the last thing to be done being a blush that Kate gave Mrs Hudson using a feathery brown brush that tickled her nose.
“That doesn’t mean it stopped hurting like a bitch,” John argued, pulling him close to hug him. Sherlock relaxed a trifle, burying his nose in John’s golden hair. “You were what, seven?”
“‘Sup, kid,” Lestrade greeted him, taking off his suit jacket and hanging it on a chair as he came in. Finished with the tour. “Done with the signs?”
He didn’t get the reference. Well, she won’t stain his innocence this late at night. Having the birds and bees conversation after midnight was futile and confusing.
John thought for a moment. He dared look up and face the Great Hall. Was he taking too long? It didn't seem like it, the students didn't look impatient or bored and Professor McGonagall wasn't shooing him away. But what John realised that he wasn't scared or nervous anymore. The dread he felt prior to being called here was simply gone. Maybe that was a sign of bravery? Small but meaningful? He never dreamed of having so many eyes rest on him, and he'd say he was taking it exceptionally well. Maybe he was braver than he thought.
Sherlock turned the water off, air stilling and falling deafeningly silent around him. He dried himself off slapdashly, t-shirt glued to spots of wetter skin the towel hadn’t gotten to properly. He hung it up on a rack, unlocked the doors and left them wide open so that the moisture would not unpleasantly linger on the wall tiles. Though, thinking about it, examining bathroom mould would be new….
-- you have no idea what you’re playing with here. This town and I have far more resources that are beyond your comprehension and understanding to try your luck!”
“I’m sorry you had that experience,” Sam told Aunt Martha sincerely. He moved his glass between his fingers as he thought what to say. Her husband was six feet under and, by their shared knowledge, already in Hell. Sam hoped he was. “But I’m glad that you managed to get out and live a better life. I think that’s the best revenge you can have on your deceased ex-husband.”
“I saw you laugh easily, saw your happiness as plain as a nose on your face that very first day we met. James never smiled unless I tried extremely hard to say something humorous. But you, I could see you shining through the cracks and I thought to myself… I have to keep this one.”
