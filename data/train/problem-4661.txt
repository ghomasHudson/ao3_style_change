. The guard hasn’t even relayed the full story to them and he silently admits he’s already a bit shaken.
“Okay Dean, but you’ve got to know that you can’t abandon all hope and quit the job. Dad assigned these people under your care and no matter how much you want to walk out that door, it’s your responsibility. Now tell me, what does she say exactly?”
“Shikes,” Dean says, looking behind him through the slightly open door, “well, it was nice talking to you, Cas,” and he runs off before he gives him a chance to respond. Stunned at the use of a nickname, it takes a while for Castiel to get a grip on himself as he tries to fast-walk to his seat at the table, situated between Anna and Gabriel.
In all situations, he obviously tries his hardest for the other to stay, but inevitably the truth comes out one way or the other and they are either advised to stay away or decide that of their own accord. It’s frustrating, but also the sad truth. Being a responsible adult now though, he seems to have accepted this also. Does it really matter if people only approach him if they need to inform him, ask for something or use him? It’s not like anyone ever finds his company interesting anyway, so is there really a difference?
“Don’t you have something better to do other than bother me right now? I believe that in this particular moment, on this serene walk, I wish to be left alone and out of your circus tricks.”
is Dean’s sarcastic retort dripping with silent disgust, as a shrewd grimace grips his face. Ever the wiser, Sam must have noticed the long list of inaudible cursing racking up in Dean’s mind because a prominent spark of pain (due to the former’s boot contacting harshly with his toes) silences his mind, forcing Dean to focus more on muffling a whine to the best of his ability.
“I never took you as one who would miss the opportunity to dance with such fine Edenish men.”
“You know, I’m trying my best while she sits upon her high horse and tells me I’m not good enough. I must have pissed her off personally but I just don’t know how, and since you’re such an expert I could use a little help here. Anyway, screw her. And screw you. You go off and leave me to deal with all this horsecrap.”
Spotting a drowsy Garth stood post at the small side door, he strains a loud murmur which is gladly enough to catch his attention. The guards aren’t really supposed to be talking on duty, much less to the princes, but Dean is desperate to find out
Sam just laughs at that, head tilted back as he tracks down the hall. Satisfied with having made an acquaintance already, he returns to his hideout and begins searching through his chests, making a thorough check that everything is in its place. He could start unpacking now, but he already feels fatigued after the tedious two week journey, so his thoughts immediately yearn for a nice, relaxing bath. Without further ado, Castiel is quick to locate two servants whom he politely instructs to fetch him a tub of hot water in his room. Whilst the bath is being filled, he files through his assortment of clothes, picking out an outfit to wear at the evening meal. This will be the first time that the Lawrencian soldiers will view their family, so he has to be sure that he will leave a good impression on them. Not too long after, Castiel is lowering himself beneath the steaming pool of alleviating water and he allows himself to simply enjoy the feeling of the sparking heat that spreads over his worn, aching body like wildfire on dry branches. He drifts off into a warm, cosy coma as he closes his eyes and allows the numb feeling wash him clean of the day passed.
Dean POV next.
Cas is interrupted by a harsh tug on his sleeve from a raging redhead plonking down heavily beside him. The man in question turns away and sharp, quick whispers follow, just out of earshot. Annoyed, the agitated woman has flames in her eyes as she gradually raises her voice and repeatedly smacks her brother’s arm lightly in between each sentence like a misbehaving child. The whispering voices grow louder until they aren’t strenuous to hear.
“Cas, you listen to me. Don’t you dare think that what they are going to start saying is true. It’s not and you know that. You are the kindest, bravest and smartest person I know and nothing is going to change –“
Yes, he may have allies, but everyone knows those come from contracts and treaties in a community effort to keep the peace. He has had a hard time believing that any friends will ever stick around after what happened. After most of the townsfolk found out about his past, the families of his two best friends kept their sons from playing with the prince, and it obviously worked because he had no right to impose any rules upon them, despite his calm protests in trying to get them to see that there is nothing wrong with him. Half of the village swear by witches, curses and the supernatural, that it’s almost laughable. So obviously most of the commoners still think he is cursed, born to a witch or something. He would find it amusing if it didn’t hurt so much. If it restricted him from making connections with outsiders. If it prevented him from being sociable. If it meant not being able to live out a normal life by even limiting talking to other people.
When Dean finally reaches his destination, it is that of the extravagant throne room, in which John is lounging at the sidelines, as per usual with a drink in his hands. At a distance, it may seem that he is simply contemplating the placement of the fruit basket next to the pastries, but Dean has known his father long enough to notice that his face is contorted in a deep ponder, however well he tries to hide it. It’s quite frankly bizarre to see his father like this – long index finger monotonously tapping on the side of the flagon, whether in concern or impatience he will never know. Concealed may it be, the event has gotten everyone riled up, even the prestigious King, so Dean takes caution as he approaches The Lion in as collected a manner as he can muster.
Castiel cuts him off before he rambles on. “Prince Dean? It would be an honour.”
“Alright, Cas, I know. I just hate how my life is planned out from the very beginning. Where is my say in this? Maybe I don’t want to go off to some faraway land and marry an old, rich man, to whose my only function is bearing his heirs. Maybe I don’t want to leave my family.”
“Well, let’s just say my best girlfriends helped me out a bit with that one.” Cas’ face contorts into a look of confusion, wrinkling further and tilting to the side, the more she speaks. “They taught me a lesson or two,” she continues, “and since most are Lawrencians themselves and grew up with him, they know a bit about his personality. You know, his likes and dislikes,” Anael adds at the end, like it would clear his face of perplexion.
Simultaneously the two brothers lean in to one side as to better hear the heated argument currently exchanging between the siblings.
Blindsided, Anna carries on, “oh, you needn’t worry about anything else, my princes. I have already talked out what I can with the washer women and spoken to the Edenish guards. I specifically told the men to go to each member of the court and apologise on my behalf for the disruption. They were to deliver a whacky story as to why they might have heard a scream at such an early hour.”
“Oh right, you mean the girl you are taking to bed? No, it doesn’t look like she told me anything, in fact I don’t recall her speaking to me at all, of course being too busy with your antics,” he spits out the vile syllables like poison.
“Yeah, I think we can finally put the thousands of men to good use,” comes a voice from behind. Surprisingly, Sam comes over and perches on the free seat beside Anna, happy to keep them company since his brother is not here. Speaking of, he hasn’t seen him for quite a while, all of this past week really, but just as he finishes scanning the entire room, there the elder prince strides in, with a beautiful young girl on his arm which he recognises as his sister, Anael. Annoyed, jealousy pulls tight in Castiel’s chest as he watches the two laughing and skipping down the aisle, absorbed in each other’s world. All he can think of is what happened? How has their bond evolved so much over the last seven days? Surely he can remember the crude words put in place by Dean to describe his sister’s ‘annoying’ personality. Wearily, Sam glances his way after noticing the display before them, unusually stiff and straight postured, whilst Anna turns her knuckles white by choking her cutlery with a deadly grip. Castiel can tell just whom she wishes was chocking under her hold right now when the redhead’s fierce eyes strike the opponent before them.
Skip if you want!!
Dean just looks at him for a moment before clearing his throat and saying, “So, if you’re ready, we can go now, because everyone but you is kinda already there.”
“Well... she said to stick my meaningless apologies elsewhere. That she should never have trusted me, but Sammy, I’ve not told anyone. What have I done to deserve this kind of treatment?”
Suddenly a pair of green emeralds are turned his way, making Castiel falter and freeze in his tracks. The verdant groves of luscious forest hint a look of appraise, admiration and intrigue, to which Castiel fails to hide the swelling pride and choking heat that seems to be working its way up Castiel’s neck. He can feel his face redden visibly, to which the older prince only smiles and Castiel cannot help but mirror back, a small, barely there thing but there nonetheless. If at all possible, the Prince’s smile widens even further.
Dean caught chiding eyes and quieted.
Dean paused, “Yeah, I guess.”
Castiel, finally kidnapped into the moment, went less for the jazzy-rock-shuffle and instead stole away Dean’s hand as he had once in a black and white dream, snaring him in abruptly out of his fake performance and giving one close-chested, daunting leer of warning before testing the threshold of the stage in tango-swing.
“I dunno, maybe.” Dean dismissed while nosing along the angel’s jawline shamelessly, from ear towards neck.
Dean rubbed the back of his neck. “If that’s what you call it, yeah.”
Four souls sat down at a comfortable booth, dividing drinks in two pairs across to either couple.
Young Sam danced in the falling sparks, and Dean admired like a proud father. This time, the memory wasn’t violently interrupted.
“Cas couldn’t make it through?” Jack was the one interested on the other end.
“As long as you want to, Dean. All of Heaven is yours.”
“...Is this about when Jack was born or before we both died? Like for real.”
“Hopefully not terrible.” Groggy blue eyes and mussed hair blinked at Dean with dazed grin.
“So what do we do now?” Dean asked.
“Like how the Empty could only enter earth if it was summoned,” Sam nodded along.
“I can still visit.” Jack offered helpfully.
“I didn’t say they were cosmic,” the angel interceded. “But it, like every piece of soul and mind in heaven, has its own plans. And they might become something else one day.”
“I mean, yeah. Figure, why not? One less evil bastard in the world. And Rowena’s really not all about the blood and mayhem anymore. Might as well give a few a shot.”
“Yeah. But come on.” Dean returned to the banister--this time slinging one arm around his brother. “Pretty fantastic, right?”
Castiel nodded. "I'll give you two time to catch up."
“Yes.”
“We’re breaking the room again.” Affirmative.
“Yheah.” Sam huffed, hiding tears. “We’re good.”
“Was he?” Castiel challenged the hunter with a daunting raised brow, lips pursed. The idea of Dean Winchester considering much of anything 'inappropriate' was comedy unto itself.
Dean glanced to see if Castiel had much to add; but apparently, the angel was going to leave the hunter to make his own decision. “Look.” he turned back to Saileen, “My whole life… I was doing work because dad put that on me. On us, mostly, but--”
Dean found himself pulling over at the edge of a bridge; a short one over a flowing stream, not the stretch of oceanic eternity that determined a great deal of their prior trip.
Summers of Love with Crowley still had charm. Dean as a child all over again. And Castiel, bonding with Claire. Rowena chiding Castiel privately of being shattered at the altar of Winchester, and his proud declaration of the meaning of family it gave him.
Jack shiftily side eyed.
Dean emerged back from the cellar, where an ex-angel had taken to frantically pacing. When the door rattled, Castiel swiveled sharply, running up to greet him and pulling him in tightly.
“Of course,” he gravelled in the most familiar way before moving on. “When I saw the future, I saw you without me. I saw you happy. I saw… heaven, for myself, and Jack; not knowing what that meant. And then I died.”
“What?”
, Dean. There’s plans for that fish.”
Dean tossed the offline mic to Sam, who captured it from the air; and Dean himself pretended the stand still carried it, leaning in to trumpet with a brother who found himself surrendering to the raw energy of it in silent-duet.
Dean realized he had been cycling his drink in his grip, finally tossing it back on that harsh note.
” Dean!Patience muttered.
“No, I think
Dean nodded long thoughtfully. “Talk it out with her and see what she thinks. You know where to find us.”
“Wh-”
“Goodbye, Sam.” Castiel offered from the back, pulling from his own enduring hug with Jack. The nephilim was jogging to catch up to Sam and Eileen, only to swerve back and throw himself into a hug with Dean. “Thanks, dad.”
Dean collected himself.
The core family piled out into the rear garden. By command, the branches parted to expose the sky. They laid out five wide--each brother to the side of Jack, and their partners beside them-- on the small descending hill as a recliner
The angel continued. “But at some point, I’m going to need you to let go of any of the people you ate. We’ll get you better food, like we did at the fair, okay?”
He found himself standing in the kitchen, staring at the most absurd image: a freezeframe, a snapshot, of two goons and a leviathan screaming their way through a heavenly joy ride.
“Okay.” Dean repeated, shorter this time. “Like I said, I’ll stay.”
Dean knew well enough from a past heaven trip how very real shared lips could feel. He leaned in cautiously while guiding the angel towards him, finding himself lost in blues just as deep as the cosmic seas they had traveled on the day, noses brushed against each other and neither ready to move. He didn’t know if he was imagining the taste of breath -- everything there was imagined, after all, but--
Squeaky-bonk.
“Nothing about us is normal, I admit.” Said the male-vesseled self-proclaimed Queen of Heaven embodying the entire world around them as they rolled through neverending dreams in the hunter’s idea of freedom. “You know what I would compare us to?” Dean’s glimpse told the former angel that the hunter had pulled himself out of any embarrassment and was listening. “Have you ever heard of the Band of Thebes?”
“C’mon Sam!” Eileen made sure to shake in the most preposterous wiggle to challenge him forward, ensuring no performance he gave might be worth the shame. He laughed, reached out, and found himself pulled in.
No six lines of teeth or face-splitting, for once.
A problem, absolution, but no solution. Except one in a glass.
“DUDE!” Sam broke out. “EW! WHAT?”
“One more stop along the way, but it’s not far from it.”
“No other way to really get this done, is there?”
Downstairs, Jo fiddled the neck of her drink and looked up in sync with Rufus and Jody.
Dean recognized other faces through the doors in time. Jody, Donna, Claire, Alex and the others all taking a large corner table.
Young Dean checked his pockets, fishing out a lighter.
where he emerged. After all, that was where the Roadhouse was. Which he guessed was where the heart of the Garden was. Which he guessed was where Heaven’s throne was, if he was tracking all of these details of his afterlife correctly.
The roadhouse was calm, but still not empty. Even the few souls in it gave it life. Without the endless bustle, there was a sense of security--like being in the safest place in the world.
Dean has it all: Peace, and Freedom. But what does that mean?
“Dude, he
“...But you understood. You understood I didn’t want you to live in suffering over it.”
“We’re in.” Sam led once all beers were cracked.
“It’s almost too quiet.” Eileen sounded sad about it. “Don’t know what to do when nothing’s going wrong.”
“Hey. I’m pretty down with the Having and the Being right now. Pretty sure Saying it’s sailed. But you know what, you stupid son of a bitch?”
The Nightside of Eden.
“Fair ‘nough,” he jolted as his line was tugged, with both men going silent beyond the hunter’s aggressive grunting as he waged warfare on the other end of his line.
Castiel recited over the increasingly energetic jive of one of Dean’s two favorite songs resonating through the car, “And if there were only some way of contriving that a state or an army should be made up of lovers and their beloved, they would be the very best governors of their own city, abstaining from all dishonour, and emulating one another in honor;...”
Dean rolled in his lips and muted.
“Why?” Castiel sounded genuinely surprised. “It was pleasant.”
“Okay?” Jack looked between them, “I’m gonna go back to… Jod things.” Jack pointed awkwardly over his shoulder, turned, and disappeared into the aether.
“That’s kinda the point, kid.” Dean inserted. “You get to figure that out. Only rule is, no powers, no using your hoodoo stuff to fix things. Like you said, hands off. Do it like the rest of us.”
Castiel didn’t know whether to hug him again or hit him, but in the end, his gaze only softened.
“But… that means I have to say goodbye to you.” Pleading eyes looked at Castiel, then shifted to Dean. Ultimately they resettled on the angel.
“Sorry, Cas.” He imagined the angel panicking on the other side of whatever threshold he couldn’t get through the same as earth.
Dean swallowed. “I mean--”
“But what will I do?”
Dean frowned. “Look. We’re all heading out back tonight, as a family. And we’re gonna use that big open sky to watch all the best things we remember, okay? And that?” Dean poked a finger into Jack’s chest, “That’s gonna stay with you. Right here. You hear me?”
He blinked. “O...kay.” Sam closed the door, wandering through the ground level while opening the envelope.
They had been through this before. “You don’t have to actually cook it or eat, Dean,” Castiel reminded.
“Yeah,” Dean interjected as he notched up Led Zeppelin’s
“Yeah, okay Levi.” He rustled his hair. “We’ll have to figure out what to do about you.”
“Dean,” the angel caught his attention on the bridge. The hunter stopped to face him, keys in hand and ready to go but eyes full of questions. “I shouldn’t have stopped you.”
Sam raised his eyebrows suggestively, “Well, I was thinking of going out for a drive. I could swing by there, pick you up, and we do something tonight?”
Sam Winchester stood in his hoodie, shrugging with a familiar awkward grin.
Dean’s look said enough. Not the foggiest clue.
They sat Levi down at the edge of the bed. By now, the Leviathan had split open its face so many times, the woman it took the image of before was gone, leaving some blank faced and featureless monster.
Dean echoed.
Back on earth, with a newly erected nursery in earthy and forested tones, mobiles and playpens in preparation, Sam took in a breath. The doorbell summoned him downstairs, and when he answered it, the peak visual of an excitable middle-aged woman greeted him.
His front passage was entered, the device guiding the plastic up further and further inside him until he felt like he was being skewered. It would wait then, inbuilt sensors measuring his internal muscles for give and flexibility, and then it would push up again, tiny, persistent thrusts that just kept going, further and further up inside him till it felt like he could feel it in his chest. This time there was no movement out, it was only programmed to thrust up and up, deeper and deeper with no relief, just a knot when it was done. He knew they were trying to make this easier on his body, limit the damage, right now it felt like cruelty.
Dean hangs his head, watching the soap run down the drain. He takes a breath, knowing he's got a long way still to go.
Dean groans at the touch, shifting his hips against the teasing strokes, weeks of denial winning out to rush through him with desire and need.
Short angsty chapter before we drive headfirst into backstory (this chapter makes references to previous traumatic experiences, possibly triggery!)
Cas had spent hours there that night, slowly making his way around the room, taking in with quiet focus each sculpture, expression unreadable. And that time Dean, for the first time, wanted to ask another how they felt about his work. It had always been such a personal thing for him that he could barely stand to be in the room with people even looking at it, it felt like they were looking at his soul, it hurt. Mostly he hid, blending into the crowd or letting his manager or Sam answer questions.
(I've bolded the 'info dump' bits so you can easily skip them if you just want the plot).
“God, I hope so! Actually, shouldn’t he be here by now?” John leant out of the doorway to his office and bellowed, “Kevin?!”
“Lets try something else,” he suggested, his mind running a mile a minute coming up with possibilities.
Sam scratched his eyebrow and looked a little overwhelmed at the question, “Uh… its really complicated. I don’t really know where to start.”
“I think the drug lasted too long or something. It’s meant to wear off after a day or so but it didn’t. I remember them forcing me to eat and drink, arguing amongst themselves about what to do. I remember the room growing light and then dark and light again three times. I remember getting weaker and weaker till I couldn’t even lift my head up off the pillow, I think I kept begging for it.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Yeah, and this is just the first one.” Sam’s haggard look agreed, he knew exactly what Castiel must be thinking, “In the foster system, he was listed as a ‘problem child’, with many behavioural issues and minor run-ins with the law.  Nothing serious, just getting into fights, drunk and disorderly, stuff like that. But it got recorded against his name. After he spent a couple of years on the streets, he began taking odd jobs here and there, some of it was with the wrong people and the cops started to pay attention to him. That’s how we have some records of that time.
That first day had been hard on both of them, as he’d needed to set the tone for their relationship. Putting Dean through the first and most thorough of what would be his weekly physicals, he’d spent hours familiarizing himself with Dean’s body, easing his fingers and instruments inside him, stretching him out and opening him up. He’d taken samples to send away and checked his reflexes. Working him hard and long and then when he was satisfied with that, he’d brought him to the training room and run him through his physical movement and obedience exercises. When finally exhaustion had set in he’d taken them both to bed, gently and with the utmost care mated him, giving him orgasm after orgasm till he fell into unconsciousness.
“It’s okay, I already know sweetheart,” Cas can only offer so much reassurance, so much comfort, but he can offer this. He’d worked it out immediately, once the truth was plain, but he wanted to be gentle about it now.
“Just saying, I'm sure you're students appreciate the view!” There is no way Gabriel would ever even consider seriously coming on to Dean but the banter between them remained playful and Cas doesn’t seem to mind. Trusting them both entirely.
“But first, we’ve got to get rid of this.” He gestured to the rock hard length between Dean’s legs. There was no way they would get through a massage tonight without that being a problem. Dean groaned, knowing exactly what 'getting rid of that' would entail. But, he flipped himself over and grasped the headboard obediently bracing himself for the inevitable. They’d done this often enough now that the process was familiar if not easily bearable.
But Castiel also got the impression that Sam, having dreamed about having an older brother for such a long time, had unconsciously formed such high expectations of their relationship, that anyone would find it impossible to meet. Sam knew this of course, he was a rational man, but that didn’t stop the ache of unfulfilled hopes and dreams from influencing his feelings towards Dean. Castiel would need to be very careful to support and encourage a healthy development in their relationship, one based in reality rather than ideals.
“Yeah, I do.”
Through a combination of mechanical and electronic components it could be adjusted into a wide variety of shapes and configurations. Dean’s body wasn’t forced to move with the frame, in fact the the slightest resistance halted it entirely, But while it gave support, it also restrained him and once in place held tight through a wide variety of straps and harnesses, Dean could be held open and immobile in almost any position. A small collection of machines sat waiting for Dean in the corner, each could be mounted to the frame in different configurations designed to work Dean through his relentless heat. A technician had been by yesterday to check them over so Gabe didn't need to.
Gabe lifted the rest of the harness and slipped it over his head. It was a fairly straight forward process to do up the straps, Dean’s arms quickly crossed and immobilized against his own chest.
“Yeah. Last time I’ll use powers until I’m back home, pinky swear.” Jack offered.
Castiel reminds Dean it's fair to dream, even in death.
“Except not. Or at least, not digested. The light being cast doesn’t belong directly to the souls, but they’re still there. Their minds are there. So if we can locate all the leviathans and get them to disengorge the souls--”
It was easy to steal away into the mind of eternity just as much as the body of it. There was nothing they were immune to sharing in Being at this point, no memory too walled.
He swore he felt the answer. Shadows. Emptiness. Absence. Maybe the light wasn’t allowed to reach here.
Dean Winchester and Castiel had settled into the vibrantly and colorfully lit stage-flanking tables. The hunter had a face full of memories from Swayze’s, while the angel simply knit his fingers and watched him immerse himself.
“I mean, nothing’s stopping him, Dean--”
...Dean rolled on. “Passing the ball to you, champ.” Sam grinned nervously. “Look, I’ve seen you. Even before whatever you did your first run. You’re ready for that. More than we ever were, that’s for sure.”
“I think we have some catching up to do.” Sam squeaked out.
Castiel accepted his dowry, taking it in by an armful.
Many stories were shared: of John’s early childhood by Henry, who apparently dreamed of owning a hot dog stand when he was small. Of Mary’s over-willingness to talk about the gross things Dean did with what he found in his diapers to all at the table, particularly fixated on Castiel’s response. Castiel informing them of trips to Dodge City and Dean’s still-living fixation with cowboys.
Castiel set his lips firmly as the human fell into the music, somehow mastering an eyeroll without his eyes disentangling from Dean who was already point-boogying across the room with an accusatory finger to Castiel in his dramatized lip sync. The glass was deposited on the table and traded for kidnapping the angel by the bicep to yank him to his feet.
“Yeah, long story, trust me.” Dean put up a hand, cutting it through the air to chop the cord on that conversation, “Don’t try to understand. Just think Rowena and hell and leave it there.”
Castiel continued.”They were the most fearsome warriors in ancient times. There was a movie called the 300 that was given to the Spartans, but at the end of the day--the true band were the Thebans.”
“Heh. Squeak. Okay, but something else too, just in case it pops it. I do
“Maybe we should stop calling it an It or a Thing, too.” Castiel realized how it sounded coming from the gamemaster.
, he tells himself,
“Twas a mere moment ago. None of you jerks noticed me gone when I stayed behind in one of the side closets near the throne room, and that was where I spotted them.”
“I can assure you that they are excellent hosts and will continue to be so in the upcoming weeks. However, my dear sister,” Castiel inhales sharply as he quickly processes the best way on how to break the news, “I’m afraid you cannot advance on the older Winchester without father’s consent. You know how courting works in our case, and I know how unfair this is, but that’s just how the world works, Ann.” An honestly sad and troubled look envelopes Cas’ features as one of despair blooms softly on the girls’ tame face.
Storming off, Dean stalks away in the opposite direction and Sam has to double his strides to catch up.
“What are you going to do when he finds out that you have been lying to him all this time? When he finally uncovers the real you behind all the layers of lies you tell every day?” The words are harsh with the intention to hurt, but it’s the truth. She needs to see how toxic her little cunning plan is, and that if the secret ever gets out, this royal environment is far from forgiving.
Sam snorts at that, his sign of silent agreement of hearing the exact same story from Dean.
He likes how the memorial accentuates the little amount of fond memories of pure, honest joy he has of Mary. He also really enjoys seeing the reverent faces of each of the awe–inspired guests. Even Balthazar seems to have shut up.
. Resolutely, he angles his body and walks away in the opposite direction, leaving the waiting Prince behind in the cold, bitter anonymity of regret.
Castiel releases a tired sigh. Unfortunately, since the little misunderstanding that happened last week, any plans for weapons training were delayed by a whole seven days and with nothing to do, he had spent those sad, lonely hours bored out of his mind, maybe reading a book here, or sorting through his chests there, between taking visits to Anna’s bedroom too. Both understood that the time was needed to clear things up and sort them out, threaten a few people here and there to keep quiet, but by the time the week was over, they were both out of their minds, with nothing to do except hang out together, despite what others might think. It was quite frankly annoying and just wasted the time that he could have spent training already, but with the rise of the sun comes a new beginning to the day with a chance to start exercising his strength again. He just hopes that no word has reached the ranks yet. Castiel doesn’t know what he would do if he couldn’t train with Michael or worse, even at all.
“The name’s Gabe,” the offender holds out his hand in a sign of peace and good intention. Apparently, that’s enough for one to become friends Sam thinks as he takes the warm flesh between his. “Oh and skip the formalities why don’t you, after what we’re about to do next all your princely dignity will fly out the window.”
Sadly, Anna turns to him with a shade of regret tinting her features. It is unspoken, but Castiel knows she doesn’t want to leave him as much as he doesn’t want to leave her. Quickly, Anna pulls him down into a tight hug and leaves with a speech of good luck and her hopes that the session goes well for him, as he turns back to face the sea of unknown faces.
As more people join, they are literally swept away, linking arms with merry strangers or conjoining palms in an encirclement of tapping motions. The music is increasing in tempo now, Castiel trusting his feet to guide him out alive through the maze of arms, gowns and handclaps. His legs are on the verge of tripping as he spins uncontrollably fast but there doesn’t seem to be anyone nearby he could latch onto until the music is reaching its peak and he is falling into the strong, comforting warmth of royally-clothed arms. His head is spinning and he feels the nauseous rise of bile emerging but the weight of Dean’s arms wrapped around his shoulders is enough to ground him. The music comes to an end but Cas is too lost in Dean’s eyes to take notice. A few people knock into them as the large crowd navigates back to their tables and splits off to rest for a while from the vigorous jumping. The musicians return the soft mood with the hazy sound of strings and the hall returns to its chatter. As if simultaneously agreeing that it’s probably best to get out the way, they snake around the general cluster of people, still conjoined at the arms, keeping to the sides and out of sight as much as possible. Dean is leading the way, but glancing back with a shit eating grin every few seconds, as if making sure Castiel is still following. Castiel can’t help but smile back. To be honest, even if Dean’s grip on his arm wasn’t deathly tight, he doesn’t think he could deny the prince now. He doesn’t think he’d want to.
“...besides, I am convinced everyone knows by now so there’s no point. She already woke up half the castle this morning and woke up the other half in her efforts to tell them the news.”
Resignedly, Castiel deflates in his chair, clearly unwilling to speak about the matter, the touchy subject surely haunting him. Reluctantly, he musters, “uh, well it was one of the maids.”
“Maybe she doesn’t see it yet. Give her time to realise that you haven’t and aren’t going to tell anyone and in fact, want to help her. I have observed that she is quite the independent lady so give her the freedom and respect that she has fought for. I have a feeling that she is too clever to stay angry over such a petty little thing like this for long.”
“Oh, okay.” Prince Sam is only wearing a worried expression until a thought occurs to him and he changes his strategy of approach. “Well, do you mind if I hold you back for a while longer.”
As predicted, the flock follow the brothers up the smooth, stone stairs and through the dense, wooden doors of the building, finding themselves inside the belly of the main foyer. This particular part of the castle was nothing special, just a plain crossroad that stems off to lead to other parts of the castle, yet something seemed to catch their attention and halt the entire party completely. And alas, Dean Winchester knew what that something was.
“Well I am incredibly sorry but if you don’t mind, I’m feeling rather tired right now so I think I might head to my room.”
Being the solitary, stubborn man that he is who never asks for any help, he struggles in silence for a while until Anna notices and discreetly helps him grip the utensils, even if the numbness prevents him from a proper hold. After all, he needs both hands to use the cutlery in the proper royal fashion, and he wouldn’t want to lower his reputation more than it already is, with acting like the common folk, or worse eating with his one other hand, which would be plain shameful. He is a royal after all.
In the adjacent door Anna pulls Castiel in a warm, tight hug and whispers soothing words of comfort in his ear about how he is always welcome to her room at any time. It really is comforting to hear.
The surprising news silences him enough that Sam catches on before him and asks on his behalf, “well, who is it?”
Dean inhales a shaky, steadying breath as he collects himself and shifts away from the emotional moment to address the group once again. The corners of his lips lift in unison as he elevates his arms akimbo and says with a warm, genuine smile,
“Annie,” he speaks sincerely, “do you mean to tell me you are getting lessons on how to court the prince and get him to marry you against his will?”
“It’s Cas-ti-el and I do believe it has been to my greatest pleasure, Prince Dean, but I have yet to explore the rest of the castle.”
“What, you don’t want me to go? Aw, you’ve grown on me.” Gabe slaps a hard smack on Castiel’s back and replies, “You’re my favourite too.” With that, he leaves a stunned Castiel behind, reeling in a range of emotions.
Not exactly new information. Looks like Gabriel’s just trying to get on his nerves again. Not exactly new information, either.
“Dean, that’s not going to happen. I am there with you, you should know that.”
“We are gathered here today to celebrate the union of our two forces. The Edenish,” the king raises his large chalice currently clutched in his right paw in the men’s direction, “and the Lawrencians.” The king repeats the action. “As you should already know, we are approaching the battle sidelines very soon, and war is fast approaching. We must not lead astray in such dire times, so let us put aside our differences and become the men of war our grandchildren and their children will talk about, so we may live again for centuries more. So come my fellow soldiers, I invite you into my home today, so we may strengthen our battlements and soon raid those bastards off the outskirts and banish them to perdition for the rest of eternity. Who. Is. with me!?
Sam has a queasy feeling in his gut telling him that this is not going to go well. “And what’s that exactly?”
“Hey Dean,” Sam sputters between chokes of laughter, “How did it go with future Queen Winchester?”
“Looks like you’re my sparring partner,” Dean states without question, looking around as everybody else seems to have already paired off together, leaving them with no choice. Castiel tries anyway.
“The first-born Prince of the Southern Isles, Michael Novak.” A tall, sinewy warrior bows low at the mention of his name. He is much older than Dean, a thick, dark beard and mop of lengthy brown hair crown his worn, tired face. Deep gashes mark the parts of his profile and muscular arms visible to the eye; a spectacular first impression which leaves Dean ogling in awe. This guy certainly looks like he has at least a few years of experience in battle up his sleeve, and Dean would be lying to himself if he said he wasn’t at least a little excited to hear what journeys this mysterious stranger encountered in the faraway lands.
That would be a shame. He had already grown fond of Sam, having somebody else to talk to other than Gabriel or Anna who doesn’t give him dirty looks. He actually enjoyed his time with Dean too, once he got used to the spinning moves and nauseous feeling, even though it might not have looked so. Then again, he doesn’t know how long that will last until one of them finds out about his past.
“Ah, you always were the clever one. But I mean to correct you since this one peculiar time that is not the case. You see,” Gabriel drops his voice to a level of conspiracy. “I overheard Dad talking to the King.”
There looks to be more news coming his way though, so he refrains from commenting for the time being, despite how hard staying silent may be.
At that, her face falls, dumbstruck that her plans weren’t so secretive after all, before a sly smirk curls her lips upwards.
Anna hadn’t even completely curtseyed when the growingly impatient herald roars “Prince Castiel” in a bored, strident bark. The man inclines in a humble fashion, a sincere look submerged in the deep oceans of his eyes, as he inspects each Winchester in turn. He takes his sweet time, and finally the roaming globes fall on Dean as the prince straightens his posture. Their eyes lock, and Dean’s sure this guy must be a psychic or something because he finds himself in a trance he’s imposed to obey.
“Me too,” is Cas’ quiet reply as he smiles at Sam as the newfound companion is turning to head down the corridor. “And...” Castiel starts as a thought strikes him so as not to leave their encounter’s first impressions so mellow. “Good luck with Gabriel. He can be quite a hefty dose of stupidity at times.”
“That’s because she gets me, man. I dunno but she has sort of changed since our first encounter. No more talk about just her and she’s actually interested in what I like to do.” Suddenly, Dean’s tone changes to one more icy and closed off, “Anyway, why am I telling you this? It’s quite frankly none of your business what our relationship is like.”
“When was this?”
They all stand upon the King’s arrival, and are quickly allowed to return to chatter amongst themselves. Other than Balthazar standing for no reason to toast nobody in particular and the odd joke from Gabriel, it’s boring. He would rather go to sleep in his warm, comfortable chambers than be present here, but since this feast is in their honour he shall stay for the celebrations. Even better, he would rather carry on his conversation with the buoyant prince.
For the first time that morning, Anna’s eyes land on Dean and then narrow at Sam. Quickly, she affirms a mental decision and grumpily grunts out, “We are incredibly sorry for being such terrible guests, my princes, but you must have heard what happened this morning and I just have a few things I need to sort out. You know, I hope that since you have heard Cas’ side of the story, I would truly appreciate it if this could stay just between us. Of course, feel free to inform your king if you do not feel that way.” The last sentence comes out bitter and icy cold, the perfect sarcastic punchline to shut anyone up. It’s an intriguing side of Anna that Dean has never seen before, so unlike the fragile princess he came accustomed to upon their first meeting.
“psst... Prince Sam... over here... behind the curtain...” Doing as told, Sam wearily approaches the place of interest with caution as he senses the voice to be merely conversational. Adrenaline pumps through his veins as the prince slowly stalks the unknown until he gets to reaching distance and with one swift pull yanks the curtain aside to reveal the small, curled form of Prince Gabriel.
“Dang, Cassie. It’s even bigger than the one back at home,” Gabriel comments, elbowing Cas in the process. It would be a lie to say he isn’t a tad fascinated himself. He had always enjoyed sparring, training on a daily basis and taking pride in delivering swift, strong moves when thrust into action. Maybe it was due to being trained from a very young age, maybe his eagerness should take the credibility, but he has to admit that he knows enough to get through the battlefield, and apparently according to Anna, that was being humble about it. “I’ve seen you train, Cas. You’re amazing.” Being under Michael’s care and granted personal training was and still is probably one of the greatest and most unique experiences that he will forever be grateful for. It taught him the skill of agility, speed and strength, and everything else a knight needs. Obviously he is nowhere near as extraordinary as Michael, but a man can dream, right?
It must have been far too long a moment that Dean sits staring and speechless that he must have caused a great deal of unnecessary worry on their part; even Sam shifts uncomfortably in his seat. Determined to relay his decision, he shakes off his reverie and meaningfully replies the long awaited response of, “Alright, what do you want us to do? We need a plan of action if we don’t want the entire castle to have heard the story by midday.”
By the time the two brothers reach King John’s side, most of the Edenish soldiers are filing into the common hall, the horses are being lead to the stables and the servants are carrying large crates and chests presumably full of unnecessary baggage for the Lords and Ladies. They have been stood to attention for a while now, just waiting for the long line of members to come to a close, which didn’t look like it would be any time soon and Dean was getting rather impatient.
No you're not, you know everything.
Dean steps closer, still distracted. They're both focusing on a different thing here, but Cas mirrors his movement and they get a step closer to understanding.
I...I love you. I'm sorry. For everything else.
Something...new. Don't worry, I think you're gonna be fine. But I don't think I'm gonna spoil the surprise. I think you wanna figure this one out on your own.
Finish your pie.
It's quite boring, really. Just a big...dark...
Grace. No one else's but his own.
It's not just you. May- maybe - maybe it hasn't been for...for a while.
Why don't you see yourselves out. You don't belong here.
No, come on, I...what does that even mean? What do you even call that?
You hear that?
What, am I in the wrong spot? Is that not Empty over there? Because I know I'm not in the wrong spot, okay. I can
Dean doesn't know what to say to this, but he presses his forehead to Cas's. He doesn't know what he's just done, or what to do next, but they're here. Cas is solid and real and in front of him, and he's made it here.
Sammy, I'm sorry. C'mon, I'm not trying to rush ya, but we gotta go meet him, and I'm gonna have to find him first...
Huh. How 'bout that.
BlessmeCastielforI am...uh. Breaking into double hell. If you can...if you can hear me in there. I'm coming in. You wanna help a guy out? It's me, okay, I'm here for you. I'm here. Come on. Let's make a door here, okay? Open up. Open up. Open up.
Cas holds his elbow like they're going to prom together.
Beat. We realize belatedly that there is no background music, that Sam has stopped talking, and that Dean has just...stopped. Tableau frozen for a second: we've been here before. So many times. Some dark haunt, someone's body on the ground, TFW fractured and bereft. Somehow it always comes down to the same couple of elements. We pan around in a circle, slowly, taking in the details. This one's different - not tangibly, just a little more dimly felt. Feels less like an event and more like the culmination of a formula or a pattern. It has to happen, so that what comes next can begin.
“I know you do.” defeat edging the corners of Sam’s voice, this is known territory for them, a conversation that feels old and worn, “I know this is hard Dean and you’re doing so much better. I do see it. But I’m your brother, so I have a right to worry.” Sam knows he’s being overprotective but almost losing your brother will do that to you.
“More than a little,” Dean winces.
He eased Dean’s legs straight, locking the many straps tight down each of his legs till they were completely immobile.
“I should have
“No,” Castiel reassured her, “I ate earlier on the plane. I’m ready whenever you are.”
Dean nods, laying back and thinking of as little as possible. He doesn’t close his eyes, instead focussing on Gabriel’s face, familiarising himself with every inch of skin. Watching his brow furrow with concentration.
Gabe notes that down too.
“Any good?” Dean asks curious.
Gabe nods. It's never easy for omega's to bear the pheromone gas, with normal Omegas they rarely have to use it, but as usual, Dean requires a different approach. They're able to give him a short break from it, but not long, he'll need a lot more of the pheromones to get through the heat, at least now Cas wouldn't react to it so it was safer to use.
They would just have to find someone else. It didn’t matter what they offered, he reasoned, he wasn’t interested.
Everyone awkwardly chuckled. Quiet fell, until Eileen broke it. “So… I guess this is goodbye.”
The initial awkwardness of a family dinner across multiple generations eventually cracked. Castiel found himself feeling strangely welcome amidst the passing of glasses and portions -- best dreamed incarnations of Winchester Surprise and favorite beers.
And on through eternity they rolled.
Jack chirped without even looking back at the group, “I have a family.” he offered a far cheerier counterpart to something Dean once told John.
“...Did Levi barf them up?”
“Oh, yeah, says the two billion year old virgin.”
Eileen finished her shimmy-around, realizing the other three had stopped--and they had company. She blinked a few times, looked at Jack and the other three--and quickly assessed this was likely not her conversation. At this rate, she would have a lifetime to get to know the boy better, but the others were the ones who had raised him. She shuffled off the stage and returned to the jukebox. Naturally she knew little of the songs there, so she simply slammed it like Dean had before to resummon the last song to vibe with--literally. And with that she was on her way towards the back, matching Dean’s early point-leading rockin’ glide.
“Dean!”
“Uh--okay.”
Castiel continued on as he approached the table, rimming the glass with his fingers but not lifting it.
“Levi? I know you can hear me.” Castiel knew the Leviathan weren’t totally mindless. “We’re going to let you stay here a little while. Dean’s bringing in what we won at the fair. They’re gifts. You keep those.”
“Yes,” Castiel smoothly chuckled, “I saw the dog. I saw… a miracle.”
and what generally happens to you when you do.
“Don’t Ellen and Jo run it?”
“What?”
“Just having an idea.”
“Um… hello!” Jack raised his hand to greet them, bright eyed. “I was just bringing in a few of the bees that were getting glowy so Cas could figure out what to do with them.”
Castiel turned around to see the image of a young boy with a hammer. Three times his size, chewing on his fist.
“Yeah… guess I know too well how much it can mess someone up to have your parents’ problems dropped on you. Okay… so I just hang out here then? I think I can handle that.”
As the call transferred from their radio to Jody’s heaven--a system they had been developing at this point to avoid the Clown Car Patience Catastrophe all over again, Dean shot a glance to Cas.
Dean looked confused, “Does that mean Sam leaves heaven?”
“I dunno, I just never thought about us as-- whatever you’d call it.”
“I saw a world where you were happy, without me. A life you would live, able to be free to pursue your dreams.”
Dean won a wiffle bat from a stand, which was used more than once to scold the shrieking Leviathan for splitting its’ face open and screaming. Given, behind the safety of a muzzle they’d installed, just in case. “No eating people.”
Neither Bobby or Castiel were very confident in that look.
Fighting faeries, meeting Charlie; long wars through Purgatory as brothers in arms and brief flirts with domesticity for Sam that left Eileen knowingly eyeing him. Battles with cartoon logic, and nazis, and titans.  Sam's knowingness of Artemis' weakness in Prometheus, earning a belated chuckle and nod from Dean.
Dean was very tempted to argue that, but uprighted himself and popped open his car door as the final rambles faded out of the radio.
Soon enough, Castiel found himself against the wall, and the rest was history.
Castiel nodded. Dean tried to open the door, but it would only budge half an inch. Inside, there were voices--most complaining, some more abruptly with the door.
...Castiel adjusted. “So I think now would be a good time to make use of that reincarnation system.”
“Hold on a second, Sam.” Dean looked thoughtful. “So what happens then? An alternate timeline?”
Dean tipped his head back and forth while he considered the theory.
“And while I would happy to have Saint Dean, the Bouncer of Heaven’s Gates keeping everything running right here, I just thought we might want to share it?”
“Yeah, but he hasn’t done
“Heavenly… dutily… regently things,” Dean sagely offered.
Something hit him late. He crunched his eyes shut and wrenched his lips. “Damnit.”
“They’re at it again,” she tiredly mouthed her drink to various sounds of miscellaneous tinker drops and thuds narrowly made their way past organ, harmonica, and guitar solos trying to overwhelm the downstairs Jukebox of
Castiel vocalized it. “Welcome to heaven controlled by man, Dean. Try not to chew on the ants for sport. But,” he tapped him on the shoulder, “I’ll let you get away with playing with them once in a while. As a treat.”
Castiel furrowed his brows. “I think we need a new gong.”
“This glass is still a glass whether empty or full,” Castiel raised it while easing himself into a chair, Dean matching him on the other side. “The shadow is just the empty glass,” he saw Dean’s gears turning. “You’re my whiskey, Dean.”
“When did they die?” Dean asked at his private window-table with Castiel, eyeing many others--Garth and Bess; Missouri; Victor, even.
Castiel pondered. “Well, if theory so far is correct, they’re essentially a form of conscious shadow. No soul. No individual id or ego.”
“A Shadow has no malice for you of its own. It is not a separate thing. It is only where the light does not touch. And the light is--”
Dean blinked, taken aback.
“Leviathan,” Castiel repeated, minus the S. “Like Moose. Not Mooses. Leviathan.”
The back door of the Roadhouse popped open. Ellen was the first to come out, trying to figure out why it was raining men. Looking up, she found the dangerous duo and sighed, “What did you two do now?”
“Hm. They’re the same.”
“Okay, that’s… fair.” Dean looked up at the toys. “What to even get a Lovecraftian Monster…” He mused.
Dean hopped his way up onto the shallow stage, stealing the idle mic stand and making unnecessarily sweet love to it with a long raking finger up its length while continuing his exaggerated lipsync and pointing out to the others, curling up his fingers to invite them in.
“Well…” Dean searched the greyed out sky merged into the canopy. “Looks like Purgatory.”
Eileen succumbed to laughter.
He could see the river, and carved into his hunter mind the best he could the configuration of the trees and ferns around it, hoping it would react if he got near to it. He wasn’t about to try and go for soggy boots round two yet.
“Shaddap,” Dean waved down.
“Wait, there’s a Cas?” The angel, having enjoyed the sentiment of watching them from afar, simply suddenly-was behind them.
Bobby shot a knowing glance to Dean. “Yeah, I bet.”
Dean’s gaze went down to the brushing fingers, turning his hand palm-up so as to curl into the others.
Dean sensed something--something else than the silent angel admiring the distance with him.
“DOES EVERYBODY KNOW?” he hollered loud enough to cut most of the room’s din short of the jukebox.
Mistakes made with sirens; untold stories of worlds that never were with Smith & Wesson. Jack silently took it all in, watching silently. He witnessed the day his father fell in every way imaginable. Dean saw it through new eyes as well--and more, truly saw himself as the angel looked into him that day. A spark and a switch seemed to fill the air, sharing with the audience the moment the angel gave himself to man just before the light of banishing played on the nighttime screen.
“Okay?” Dean wandered to collect Castiel’s trench coat draped nearby to slide onto himself in counter to the other stealing his robe; even if cold and discomfort weren’t real here, the idea of sitting bare-assed on the roughly upholstered chair already made him itchy.
“He walked away, Sam. We let him walk away, and we didn’t stop him. He still deserved a life, a family. I dunno, to go to school and have a stupid first crush.”
“Anyway, back to your story. We can talk about what’s going on with Rowena next time.”
“...Sounds good by me.”
“So… you’re… giving birth to a bunch of bees?”
Castiel stared out the window with hands in his pockets, glancing back from the Chitaqua forest line, “Do you know why?”
“How do you leave heaven A Little Bit?”
“No,” Cas pointed out. “I’m fairly certain your brother did that.”
He approached the bar of the bridge, sensing the angel at his flank--closer, even, than in the car moments before.
Inside the Roadhouse, Castiel settled out the blossoms and stared at them, fingers knit as he meditated. Dean’s explanation of the tree was enough to connect to his previous vision through the eyes of the Leviathan stuck in Bobby’s panic room.
“Did you just call it a ‘shindig’?” Sam jeered playfully.
Dean may have been owning that a little too well, readily moving to the groove. Eileen was quickest to join him, moving with the flow of good old booty-bounce against him. Sam and Castiel stood off to the side, the latter of which found himself yanked in by the tie with one commanding grip for the most unusual serenade to his face.
“I wanted you. Son knows I wanted you. And I wanted to believe… maybe I had even thought that you and I were courting at that time, with our gifts, and movies. I even let myself start to think you might have wanted me the way I felt. That I wasn’t misreading what I felt from you.”
Dean found himself leaning into the angel, whispering feigned criticism, “This is a good memory for you?”
“What about Dean?”
“Indeed they did. Handily so.”
“Yes. But goodbye isn’t forever. You know that. And sometimes, the eagle needs to spread its wings.”
Elsewhere, Castiel and Dean looked up from their idle perch at the lakeside on a dock where Dean was fishing with the angel’s bystanding company.
The world truly came into focus as a young, blonde figure took center presence in their grotto.
“Right.” Dean still scoured the ceiling, balancing his breath. “Less dumb. Lots of ass. So that’s--that’s it? We just… bone the knot and--”
“What, so it can hit things, but comically?”
Castiel released, looking perplexed--only to find a bunched together bouquet of disgusting looking blossoms presented with the Winchester’s best shit-eating grin on display.
“Nothing, as far as we can tell,” the ex-angel remained curt.
The angel leaned away and escaped his grip, leaving Dean looking momentarily shattered, “What, was that--”
for it.” Dean slammed down carnival tokens, and it was off to the races.
The orphic child perceiving and coming to know man through the eyes of the grace-forged world who loved him too.
“Yeah, I don’t think hooking it up on blind dates is going to work,” Dean brooded, before mentally clicking--and gesturing through it with his hand to match. “I’ve got it.”
But with that, Castiel finally pulled himself to rise from the eternal entwinement he had with Dean. The shared room was union enough; the angel knew by now that it came from memories of Dean visiting another timeline Castiel had only narrowly rescued him from. Rustic walls and beaded doorways, strange artifacts and unnecessary gongs--a collection of the survivalist eccentric.
“Later.”
Castiel’s lips wrapped in a calm smile, turning to look back out into the memory of the wilds. “We had a life there.”
Angel of the Roadhouse
“Yeah, but that’s not what I mean. You know. You never really got to go to school. Or… build your own family, or whatever.”
Dean found himself staring with the same quiet intensity of the night the angel confessed before disappearing, eyes traveling every inch of his features but not knowing what to say.
“Okay--so you can’t go back. What do you think, Sam?” she took charge.
“Yeah! It’s not a thing, it’s--” pause. “Levi!”
Sam looked over, “You got anything to add, Cas?”
and wander out. There were probably answers there somewhere.
“Cas--”
“Yeah. Named him Dean. Since there was already a Sam and a Cas, right?”
“So uh--” Sam brushed down the back of his hair. “Great work with the place here.”
Junior, of course, contextually.
“Like god.”
“That world was not yet there. I considered it a--” Castiel chuckled grimly, eyes drifting to the rafters of the ceiling, “A waste of how useful I could be moving forward. I had at least convinced myself I wasn’t useless, and maybe that was an improvement. Raising a son together made me reconsider much of this. I couldn’t let him think the way I did.”
“Well that explains why it was locked.”
“It’s the best I could come up with.” Castiel admitted.
“I think--” he took her hand, “We should do it. And do it right. I’m not saying I want you to get out of the Life. But we can build something better, closer. Safer. We had something good going on there, we can do more with that. Just no more pointless deaths. I’m so tired of losing people.”
“Eating people and fighting things,” the hunter was less helpful.
Sam continued, “They came pounding on the bunker door while Claire was here. I think she did a few of them a mercy by ganking the first ones before they explained what was going on.
“I can
“Only one way to find out.”
he gestured between them.
. More than once, Sam had to clear his throat to remind them that the pair had easily taken several minutes ‘lining up a shot’ to the point of discomfort. In the end, Sam and Eileen won the gamble, and Dean and Cas won everything else.
They lost themselves, this time with Dean deciding a nice track of
“Dean. I am literally the highest power in the land, shared only with our son.”
Either way, we kinda saw a good opportunity there. For a while we just had helper demons on basic cases, which isn’t quite the same trade as an angel but you know.
“Everything but one piece has come to bear fruit,” Castiel considered, ignoring Ash moving to and fro in the background cleaning glasses.
In theory, all they had to do was confirm that this was Purgatory, cementing the building theories together and determining where the Leviathan were coming through. But it felt off to just wander in, say
“There hasn't been a monster-related death in the united states in the last eleven months.” Eileen updated over the video client while Sam stared on, a pleasant smile steaming as much as his coffee as he stared at her.
Dean mentally calculated his descent and decided to tentatively step around from
“Yup.”
“Upstairs.” Castiel growled.
“Oh, gross!” Sam shoved his own plate away.
“Well… at least they’ll just squeak if they start hitting us.”
“Yeah well.. I still would have wanted you there.”
Castiel turned to face Dean, tipping his chin up the bare inch needed to meet the other man. “Exactly.” Dean’s tiny head tilt charmed the angel if the spark in his eye said anything. “Dean, what is a shadow?”
Dean shot an accusatory look to the angel, who looked flatly unruffled.
You ready to do your part and help me blow this pop -
Well? And you didn't
While they're looking at each other, we see Jack wave a hand. They blink, turn back to him looking a little bit dazed, and we know they've got no recollection of the past three minutes' worth of conversation.
No offense, but I really don't think that's a good idea right now.
You know anybody else I video chat in ASL? She wants to know if we're headed out her way or not.
Of course. We'll do that.
...I didn't.
So who did?
You know, you've always underestimated your own power of faith. Maybe...maybe you were the last thing left to pray to.
Because Sam's girlfriend's got this idea. You and me could just - I mean, we could tag along for the ride. Or, you know, we could - you remember that bar?
I'm thrilled to be here, okay? Is that what you need? It would make me very happy to go into the Empty, okay? Just...just let me...let me get over there.
I'm pretty good. What now?
And without anything really seeming different, we see CAS. It's as if we've just had the camera facing in the wrong direction, and he was possibly there right from the start, we just didn't see him. He doesn't look that different from usual, except that there's a sort of stunned, distracted, awed look on his face.
...you're trying to tell me I was praying to...what,
So you didn't help me.
Dean, what the fu-
Should you...should you be driving right now?
...I didn't mean him.
But this is it. He's aimed himself in a direction, and against all odds, has found himself at his destination. He knows what's on the other side. We all do.
He puts his hands on his hips, as if that settles it. Cas is still holding him by the elbow. They look somewhat diminished at the moment, kids caught sneaking back home after curfew.
You're all right?
Fancy running into you here.
left before I - look, I - you could've - how long have we known each other?
Uh, yeah.
I mean, I figure...you know. Third time's a charm, right? You get me out, we get each other out. I get you out.
There you are.
Yeah, you are, for you this is wallowing, and just the other day you were saying you just wanted to get back to normal, so which is it? Do you want some time alone to process or do you want to just, I don't know, go find a job or something? Like, would a hunt really take your mind off things?
it. It's- over -
side.
SAM hunched over, applying pressure, for all the good it'll do. It's all been so sudden; but in the back of his mind he's kicking himself. Of course they shouldn't have hunted so soon. Of course. Man who takes risks at the best of times loses someone so close, someone he can't even define himself in relation to except that it's too much not to have. Man who almost jumps at the chance to put himself back in some dangerous situation. What did Sam think was going to happen?
